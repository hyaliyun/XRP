The story of an American couple who inadvertently become embroiled in a revolution, it was based on the short story \\"The Doubters\\" by George Tabori. Plot From the trailer Dr. Eugene Ferguson (Cary Grant), a renowned American brain surgeon, and his wife Helen (Paula Raymond) are vacationing in Latin America when a revolution breaks out. They are taken against their will to the country's dictator, Raoul Farrago (Jos√© Ferrer), who urgently needs a life-saving operation. Over the next few days, while Ferguson trains assistants for the delicate operation, he witnesses various acts of brutality by the regime, especially by Colonel Adragon (Ram√≥n Novarro), but his Hippocratic Oath compels him to do his best. Roland Gonzales (Gilbert Roland), the rebel leader, kidnaps Helen to pressure her husband into making a fatal surgical \\"mistake.\\" His message to Ferguson is intercepted by Isabel Farrago (Signe Hasso), the patient's wife, and the operation is a success. Helen is released unharmed when Farrago dies soon afterwards and his government is overthrown. Cast * Cary Grant as Dr. Eugene Norland Ferguson * Jos√© Ferrer as Raoul Farrago * Paula Raymond as Helen Ferguson * Signe Hasso as Senora Isabel Farrago * Ramon Novarro as Colonel Adragon * Gilbert Roland as Roland Gonzales * Leon Ames as Sam Proctor Reception From the trailer Reviews were mixed on this film. Bosley Crowther, film critic for The New York Times, wrote that \\"With such a penny dreadful story, it is remarkable that Mr. Brooks has been able to get any substance of even passing consequences on the screen. But some of his film is quite amusing and the two main performances are good. ... However, the task of surmounting the story completely and in full is beyond Mr. Brooks and his barely adequate supporting cast.\\" The Variety review noted, \\"the script [from a story by George Tabori] and direction by Richard Brooks lets it get up on the soapbox too frequently.\\" Time Out, however, had the opposite reaction to Crowther, thinking that Brooks was \\"adept at maintaining the tension\\", while of the opinion that Grant looked \\"as though he'd rather be holding a dry martini than a scalpel.\\" According to MGM records the film earned $891,000 domestically and $512,000 foreign, resulting in a loss to the studio of $72,000.

The highest point on this line is Ahju station at an elevation of . There are 33 stops.  History  The railway line was planned in May 1926 and commissioned in 1929. The line has two tunnels, one of which is and the other in length. Trains on this narrow gauge line are pulled by small and less powerful engines than on a broad gauge main line, therefore steep ascents had to be avoided. But instead of expensively boring through the mountains on a straight way, a much longer right-of-way further south was chosen that allowed gentle slopes. From 1942 to 1954 there was no train service east of Nagrota. When the Maharana Pratap Sagar was constructed, the line had to be diverted between Jawanwala Shahr and Guler into higher grounds along the eastern shore of the new reservoir. In 1973, the section between these two stations, along with Anur, Jagatpur, and Mangwal stations was abandoned, and the new alignment with several new stations opened three years later.

These roads are part of the Coordinated Regional Emergency Transportation Strategy and are intended for emergency responders when a disaster strikes and are not evacuation routes for the public. History Original DRR Sign until 2004 DRR came upon to the Province after witnessing the traffic mayhem after disasters like the 1989 San Francisco, 1994 Los Angeles earthquakes, September 11 terrorist attack. It was decided that BC will require a system to control post-disaster traffic and BC became the first jurisdiction in the world to implement a disaster response road plan in 1995.Information for Responders - Part I In the original plan, only Vancouver roads were considered but eventually expanded to marine routes, railways and air transports. DRR roads are capable of withstanding natural disasters and the roads all link to Abbotsford, more specifically to Abbotsford International Airport.Disaster Response Route Video While DRR consists mostly of roads, emergency plans also includes marine routes suitable for quick access for responders.On Guard for Thee There were confusion since the launch of the program with the general public - the original sign did not include the third tab (Emergency Vehicles Only During a Disaster) which led many to believe these roads are for evacuation when disaster strikes. Information for Responders - Part II Since 2004, the Ministry of Transportation added the third tab and increased public awareness to promote the correct use of these roads during a disaster. Operation Roads that are pre-marked as DRR are open to the general public unless a state of emergency was declared by the municipal or provincial government. Once a state of emergency is declared, DRR can be activated and the local police will be responsible for cordoning off the roads. As soon as possible, the public will be allowed back onto the Disaster Response Routes. DRR is intended for those who have the following function to access the roads within 72 hours of a disaster strikes:Short Sea Shipping and Disaster Response Route * Transport/diagnose/treat sick & injured * Transport displaced persons * Maintain law and order * Extinguish fires & control hazards * Control traffic & evacuations * Search and Rescue * Protect public health and prevent spread of communicable diseases * Assess damage * Restore damaged transportation systems * Restore communications infrastructure * Restore water/gas/electricity supplies * Manage any of the above Specifically, 'DRR users' are categorized into 3 groups:Operationalizing Disaster Response Routes in British Columbia * First Responders - designated responders ** British Columbia Ambulance Service ** Fire & Rescue ** Police ** Key management staff * Critical Service Providers - designated responder for the duration of the emergency ** Provincial Emergency Program volunteers ** Hospital staff ** Traffic controllers ** Public Works personnel ** Public Health officials ** Utility (hydro, electricity, etc.) crews * Specialist Responders - designated responder only when called upon and only when performing specific recovery- related tasks ** Canadian Forces ** Canadian Coast Guard ** Structural engineer inspectors ** Technicians ** Supply delivery personnel ** Maintenance Crews Once activated, only those who have been issued with DRR hangers (for automobiles) or DRR decals (on Driver's license, employee ID or government IDs) will be able to access the designated roads.Distribution of DRR Identification See also * Provincial Emergency Program * Emergency Social Services * E-Comm References External links * Ministry of Transportation DRR * DRR Maps * Disaster Response Routes ‚Äì DO NOT Use in Case of Emergency * Drive Smart BC * Disaster Response Route brochure * Corporation of Delta DRR * City of Richmond DRR Transport in British Columbia Emergency management in Canada Transport in Greater Vancouver ","title":"Disaster Response Route"},{"id":"18793798","text":"Anyone Can Play () is a 1968 Italian comedy film directed by Luigi Zampa and starring two Bond girls Ursula Andress and Claudine Auger.

The flame is generally propagated spherically and the radial flame propagation velocity is defined as the flame speed. In other words, flame speed represents how rapidly the flame travels from an absolute reference point, while burning velocity presents the moving rate of chemical reactants (unburned gases) into the reaction sheet (flame front) from a local reference point located on the flame front. Whereas flame velocity is generally used for a fuel, a related term is explosive velocity, which is the same relationship measured for an explosive. Combustion engineers differentiate between the laminar flame speed and turbulent flame speed. Flame speed is typically measured in m/s, cm/s, etc. In engines In an internal combustion engine, the flame speed of a fuel is a property which determines its ability to undergo controlled combustion without detonation. Flame speed is used along with adiabatic flame temperature to help determine the engine's efficiency.

Something is troubling Sylvio, but the family believes he still misses a sweetheart killed in Italy during the war. Sylvio also has an alibi for the night of the priest's murder, but Sergeant Gillen gets word to Joe that the alibi is a fake. In a ploy to encourage Sylvio to confide in him, Joe pretends to be a murder suspect himself. Sylvio breaks down and admits to having killed his own sweetheart, then the priest as well after confiding to him about the murder in confession. Sylvio runs into the street and is struck by a moving vehicle. Dying, he begs for Joe's forgiveness.

In 1971, having lived about twenty-five years Down Under, one of those immigrants, middle-aged Amedeo Battipaglia, a lineman in the remote New South Wales settlement bearing the (fictional) name of Bun Bun Ga, several kilometers from the outback city of Broken Hill, is about to meet Carmela, his prospective bride from Rome, with whom he has been corresponding. Each of them misrepresented facts to the other ‚Äî Carmela, a very attractive Calabrian woman in her early thirties, is a semiliterate prostitute seeking an opportunity to get away from her abusive pimp, with the letters to Amedeo ghostwritten by her friend Rosalba, while Amedeo, feeling inadequate about his ordinary appearance, sent Carmela a photograph, taken about ten years earlier, of himself between two Italian immigrant friends, Giuseppe Bartoni and Bampo. The arrow in the photo, however, is over Giuseppe because, when Amedeo visited his tall, handsome friend for advice, Giuseppe erased the arrow over Amedeo's head and pencilled it over his own head. In Rome, getting a ride to the airport on the back of a friend's motorcycle, with her pimp in pursuit, Carmela arrives at the boarding gate, meets Rosalba who hands her the travel documents, has a final across-the-gate shouting match with her pimp, and takes a seat in Qantas first class next to a turbaned passenger perusing Life (issue of 19 February 1971).Cover of February 19, 1971 issue of LIFE Magazine, as displayed in the scene A stewardess points out that her ticket is for tourist class with special discount for immigrants. Meanwhile, Amedeo drives his substandard auto nearly 1600 kilometers to Brisbane Airport, where Carmela's flight, filled with other Italian mail-order brides (as well as those from neighboring Yugoslavia) will land. Sitting at the airport lounge with numerous Italian men awaiting their future wives, they pass around outdated photographs that the women had sent to their prospective mates and speculate whether their appearances had changed. Still uncertain of recognizing Carmela from the black-and-white photo of her as a young peasant girl, he examines and questions a few of the newly arrived women and then is hit with realization as she slowly comes into view on the down escalator. Becoming disconcerted by her beauty, he retreats to the airport's bar where, sharing a drink with a balding Italian who sent a photo of himself with a full head of hair, he expresses his own self-doubts. Convinced that she will reject him, he returns to the arrivals area, introduces himself as Giuseppe and hands her a note, purportedly written by Amedeo, explaining that he is ill with the flu and requesting that Giuseppe, a trusted friend, provide an escort to her new home. Unable to decide how to resolve this situation, Amedeo tells Carmela that driving to Giuseppe's home in Broken Hill would take three days, but as the trip starts, they are seen riding not southwest of Brisbane, but thousands of kilometers off-course in the city of Cairns, a gateway to the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland's tropical far north. The brightly colored lush greenery provides a picturesque background for an eventful multi-day journey down the coast of eastern Australia, with one of the stops at Barrier Reef's Dunk Island,Barber, Lynden. \\"Cardinale virtues of a screen life\\" (The Australian, 10 February 2010) a popular tourist vacation spot, which provides the opportunity for the rental of a rowboat and, as Amedeo rows, Carmela strips to her underwear and dives into the warm water, revealing her skill as an expert swimmer, speedily maneuvering amidst brilliantly colored fish and corals, while Amedeo sits in the boat, peering downward with concern. As the long trip to Broken Hill continues, they become better acquainted and she learns of his hardships as an immigrant and also finds out, since it happens in front of her, that, due to a years-earlier bout of malaria, he is subject to occasional epileptic-like convulsions which leave him unable to function for a few hours. Further along, they stop for a visit to the nursing home where Bampo is a long-term patient, having become unresponsive as a result of malarial damage to his brain and nervous system. As Amedeo's small auto, unable to withstand the long journey, breaks down, they push and pull into a town and try to sell it in an Italian-speaking neighborhood, but run into some hostile local Italians who force Carmela into their car and drive away with her while Amedeo hangs on to their door handle, as the car veers off into a ditch and flips on its side. Shaken but unhurt, they go off to board a train, but when he has another malarial attack during a station stop and she rushes off the train to get help, it pulls out, leaving her behind. Seeing no other recourse, she decides to briefly take up her former profession in order to earn enough for continuing the journey. Now on her own, she takes a later train and, as it stops at the small town of Menindee, she sees Amedeo waiting at the station. Reunited, they continue to Broken Hill, which is a little over a hundred kilometers further. Upon arrival, Carmela meets Giuseppe, whom Amedeo, still pretending to be Giuseppe, introduces as her betrothed, Amedeo. After a few pleasantries, Giuseppe who, as it turns out, is himself a pimp, leaves after driving Carmela to the back entrance of what he describes as her new apartment, but which quickly reveals itself as a prostitute's walk-up house situated in the city's red light district amidst numerous other such dwellings, each with its own resident \\"working girl\\" sitting on the porch. Amedeo finds out where Giuseppe has taken Carmela, goes to the red light neighborhood and approaches her porch, hoping to offer an explanation, but she goes inside to get her switchblade and attacks him, inflicting a stab wound in his shoulder. Eventually, Carmela and Amedeo, with his arm in a sling, are on a train, as he is still trying to convince her of his honorable intentions by offering to pay for her trip back to Italy but she begins to cry that she was a prostitute there and, upon returning, would be beaten by her pimp. Dismayed and outraged, he jumps up and exclaims (in Italian) to all the passengers that she has cheated and deceived him, but when she tells him that he was equally untruthful, he says that he forgives her and she slaps him, retorting that no one needs his forgiveness. At this point, the train is slowing to a stop and, upon spotting from the window the remoteness of the outback, she refuses to disembark at the tiny Bun Bun Ga railway shack \\"in the middle of the desert\\". As she is cajoled and then forcibly pulled off the train by Amedeo and two of his Italian friends who regularly travel this route, the spectacle is witnessed, several meters further, by the group of local English-speaking residents, brandishing a \\"WELCOME CARMELA\\" sign, who had come to meet the train. As Amedeo and Carmela approach, a little girl among the greeters slips a 45\\" record into a portable player which starts to emit Wagner's \\"Bridal Chorus\\", while one of the men takes out a sheet of paper and reads a speech, which Amedeo interprets for Carmela into Italian: \\"Dear Carmela, this is a historical day for Bun Bun Ga. Carmela, you come from the noble and ancient country that is Italy. The country of Julius Caesar, the country of Michelangelo, of Galileo, the country of Guglielmo Marconi, the country of Caruso, of Bartali, and Pope Giovanni. Carmela, you come to this corner of the desert to bring us a little breath of your old civilisation.\\" As the train leaves the station, Amedeo can be seen through one of its windows carrying Carmela bridegroom-style into his/their house.

It was a flexible machine gun used in the some Polish airplanes in the beginning of World War II. History In mid-1930s Polish small arms designer Wawrzyniec Lewandowski was charged with developing a flexible gun based on the Browning wz.1928. The desired changes included raising the cyclical rate of fire to 1100 rds/min, replacing the buttstock with a spade grip at the rear of receiver, moving the main spring under barrel and, most importantly, changing the feed system. The gun's original 20 round box magazine was impractical with the gun's high rate of fire. The solution was found in developing a new feeding mechanism, which was added as a pack to the standard receiver. It contained a spring-loaded lever, which when cammed by the lock during locking would grab a round from a 91-round pan magazine located above the receiver and force the round into alignment to feed during unlocking. The weapon is the world's only specialised aerial flexible machine gun based closely on the Browning M1918, or \\"Browning Automatic Rifle\\". The wz.37 was dubbed \\"Szczeniak\\" (Polish for pup) due to its lightness and compactness compared with previous Vickers E and Vickers F machine guns.

He was impeached by the Iranian Parliament on 4 November 2008 after a doctorate he claimed to hold turned out to be fraudulent. Career Kordan was a former revolutionary guard and a veteran of the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. He previously served as deputy labour minister, president of Iran's technical and vocational organization, deputy head of the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) for provincial and parliamentary affairs, deputy head of IRIB for administrative and financial affairs, and deputy minister for culture and Islamic guidance for administrative and financial affairs. He also served in the Iranian judiciary. He was appointed deputy oil minister in October 2007, which he had turned down in 2006. In 2008, President Ahmadinejad nominated Kordan as the interior minister in a cabinet reshuffle. He was confirmed by the Parliament by 169 votes to 100 in August 2008.Iran's parliament impeaches interior minister USA Today However, during his confirmation debate in the parliament, questions arose among MPs and in the media over his qualifications and over a doctorate he claimed to have received. Kordan replaced Mostafa Pour Mohammadi in the post. Controversy During his tenure as the deputy head of IRIB in financial affairs, Ali Kordan was accused of a high-profile financial corruption (525 billion Tomans). However the judiciary system did not charge him after a long investigation. Kayhan published an article accusing Kordan of corruption in \\"The Crescent File\\". thumb Kordan claimed to have an honorary doctorate in law from the University of Oxford. When questioned about this, he released a document stating that such a degree had been conferred on him in June 2000 and under-signed by three Oxford University professors. A copy of the certificate was released. Alef, a website \\"associated with one of Ahmadinejad's critics\\", pointed to \\"typing errors, garbled English and misspellings\\". The document stated Kordan > \\"has shown a great effort in preparing educational materials and his > research in the domain of comparative law, that has opened a new chapter, > not only in our university, but, to our knowledge, in this country\\". Kordan was granted the degree \\"to be from scientific privileges\\"; \\"entitled\\" was spelt \\"intitle\\", and spaces were left out after commas.The spelling of \\"entitle\\" as \\"intitle\\" in the degree was used by some commentators as being indicative of the degree being bogus (i.e., issued by a diploma mill). but the word \\"intitle\\" is an obsolete spelling of \\"entitle\\". Responding to an inquiry by Alef news agency, on 11 August 2008, Oxford University denied it had awarded Kordan an honorary doctorate of law or any other degree. Four days later, the university published an official statement on its website that they had no record of Kordan having received any degree, honorary or otherwise. It noted that none of the professors whose alleged signatures were on the certificate were working in the field of law, and none of them would sign degree certificates. As a result, chairman of Iranian parliament Ali Larijani initiated an investigation into the validity of Kordan's degree. It was later revealed, according to news service MSNBC, that Kordan did not receive two other degrees he had claimed, a bachelor's degree and a master's degree from Iran's Azad University. Two days after the Oxford University response, IRNA reported that the Tehran prosecutor's office announced that investigating Alef news website had been \\"banned based on complaints by legal entities\\". It was reported that Alef had been blocked by the Iranian \\"authorities\\". As of 27 August 2008, the ministry of science, research and technology denied announcing any statement on Kordan's doctorate degree. On 27 September 2008, in a letter to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Kordan admitted that the degree was fake, explaining that he had been deceived by a \\"person who claimed to represent Oxford University in Tehran\\". After holding the degree for eight years, he was astonished to learn that \\"the university did not confirm (the degree) when my representative went there\\". Kordan said his search for this fraudulent Oxford intermediary had proven fruitless but that he had filed a complaint against the person, whom he did not name, on 14 September. Kordan also accused the media of a smear campaign by portraying him as a \\"terrorist\\". Impeachment On 4 November 2008, the Iranian parliament voted to impeach interior minister Ali Kordan for lying about his credentials and presenting a fake degree from Oxford University. Out of 247 MPs present, 188 voted to impeach Kordan, with 14 lawmakers against the motion and 45 abstentions. Death Kordan died of multiple myeloma at Tehran's Masih Daneshvari hospital on 22 November 2009 at the age of 51.

Subsequently, they discover the lion's cage had been deliberately opened by an animal trainer named Slade who used to work for the Bormans and whom Hank had recently turned down for a job. Slade is found, captured and eventually jailed. Harrison and Sherman are infuriated by Whirling's refusal to accept their help. Hank and Helen clash over the best way to publicize the show; he feels she is intruding on his turf because he actually IS a very good publicist. Hank and Randy clash over Randy's firing of 40 roustabouts and replacing them with a stake-driving machine that expedites raising the Big Top. The machine is sabotaged and sets a pile of hay on fire; only swift action by Hank keeps the main top from burning. Hank, Helen and Randy begin to wonder if a saboteur, perhaps hired by the Bormans, is riding with the show. Tragedy strikes when the first section of the circus train derails en route to a new stand. Mama Colino, the show's \\"den mother,\\" is killed, leaving Zach Colino heartbroken. He loses his nerve and is unable to go on. As he is the star of the show and the show's publicity is built around him, this is a major disaster. Coupled with the foul weather they have been enduring for weeks that keeps the circus goers at home, the books are looking grim. Only glib talk by Sherman keeps the bank at bay and the show on the road. Hank conceives a bold scheme. He will scrap the route he had laid out, do one show in Buffalo, New York, and then slip into New York City three weeks before the Borman Brothers Circus, stealing the audience from his rival. But to make his plan work, Whirling needs a major publicity splash. Helen proposes a stunt last performed in the 19th century: a walk across the gorge at Niagara Falls on a tightrope. Since Zach has lost his confidence in the wake of Mama‚Äôs death, Hank goads Zach into making the wire-walk by calling him a coward. Colino swears that first he will walk the Falls, and then he will kill Hank. But after completing one of the most dangerous wire walks in history, Zach realizes Hank said what he said only to help him, and they reconcile. With the bank about to foreclose, Hank goes to television star Steve Allen to seek needed publicity for the circus. Allen buys the rights to broadcast the opening night performance in New York City for enough money to pay off the show's line of credit and enable it to go on. When detectives from the New York Police Department arrive on the lot looking for Tommy, the Colino Troupe's catcher, they inform the show's management that Tommy is an escaped lunatic. Hank realizes that Tommy is the saboteur who has been traveling with the circus and who is behind Mama Colino's death. Meanwhile, Jeannie Whirling's debut with the Colino Troupe almost becomes her final performance when Tommy deliberately misses a catch, but she manages to grab onto one of the climbing ropes. While fleeing from Zach Colino, Tommy falls to his death. Down below, with the circus in the black and the saboteur dead, Hank and Helen realize what has been obvious to everyone else in the circus: they are in love with each other.

Lord was removed from the FA Inclusion Advisory Board in September 2014 after giving an interview to the Daily Telegraph in which they criticised the Association for its inaction in tackling high level discrimination in the game, citing the Scudamore incident and several others.

In July 2018, it was reported in the Sunday Times and Daily Telegraph that Lord now identifies as non-binary and uses the pronoun 'they'. Lobbying controversy In December 2011 Lord was caught up in a \\"sting\\" by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and The Independent, who posed as representatives of Uzbekistan in a meeting with lobbyist BTP. In footage of the meeting Lord described themself as having a \\"non-executive\\" role with BTP, but subsequently explained that they attended the meeting as a favour to BTP's managing director, fellow Liberal Democrat Mark Pursey, and that they had never worked for BTP. Freemasonry Lord is a freemason and is a Grand Officer and former chair of the Universities Scheme of the United Grand Lodge of England. They are a Member or Honorary Member of a number of Masonic lodges. In responding to charges of hypocrisy of being both a freemason and a diversity campaigner, Lord told the Daily Telegraph that \\"It is something I continue to struggle with and continue to think about. If it was entirely up to me I would change things, but you have to take 250,000 members with you. I‚Äôve spoken fairly freely on this subject and the fact that Freemasons could be more welcoming and inclusive The one area I would change is on gender\\".

Elena finds lodging with a lawyer named Bellocampo, who is an enigmatic landowner who knows all the unmentionable secrets of the city. At school Elena clashes with the difficulties of school evasion, while her non-conformism prevents her from tying up with her colleagues, except with Professor Belcore, with whom she starts a relationship, which he does not dare to make public.

Although concerned by this notion, she decides to use it to ask the Mayor to bestow grants to the poorest families, which he immediately obtains.

Wilhelm Molitor (pseudonyms Ulric Riesler and Benno Bronner) (24 August 1819 at Zweibr√ºcken in the Rhine Palatinate ‚Äì 11 January 1880 at Speyer) was a German poet, novelist, canon lawyer and publicist, and Roman Catholic priest. He was a chief promoter of the Catholic movement in the Palatinate. Life After studying philosophy and jurisprudence in Munich and Heidelberg (1836‚Äì40), he held various juridical positions in the service of the State from 1843-9. Feeling himself called to the priesthood, he studied theology at Bonn (1849‚Äì51) and was ordained priest on 15 March 1851. In the same year he became secretary to Nicolaus von Weis, Bishop of Speyer; on 11 November 1857, he was elected canon of the cathedral chapter and, soon after, appointed custos of the cathedral, and professor of arch√¶ology and homiletics at the episcopal seminary. He took part in the consultations of the German bishops at Bamberg (1867), W√ºrzburg (1868), and Fulda (1869). In 1868 Pope Pius IX summoned him to Rome as a consultor, ahead of the First Vatican Council. From 1875-7 he was a member of the Bavarian Landtag. His ultramontane principles made him unacceptable to the Bavarian Government, which in consequence repeatedly prevented his election to the See of Speyer. He founded the \\"Pf√§lzicher Pressverein\\", the daily paper \\"Rheinpfalz\\" and the \\"Katholische Vereinsdruckerei\\".

The riot Tibet Autonomous Region Tibetan rioters appeared to be targeting shops and vehicles owned by Han Chinese, the predominant ethnic group in China, and Hui, who are a Muslim minority. According to the BBC and The Wall Street Journal, rioters focused on setting fire to and looting businesses owned by them; The Wall Street Journal stated that first-hand accounts of their stories have been relatively rare in Western news reports, in part because it is difficult to reach people by phone in Lhasa.\\"Chinese Dismayed by Tales of Tibet Violence, The Wall Street Journal Tibetans face similar problems due to the strict controls on media reporting of events in Tibetan areas of China. James Miles, in an interview with CNN, made the following assessment, \\"What I saw was calculated targeted violence against an ethnic group, or I should say two ethnic groups, primarily ethnic Han Chinese living in Lhasa, but also members of the Muslim Hui minority in Lhasa.\\" Also according to The Economist, \\"The mobs, ranging from small groups of youths (some armed with traditional Tibetan swords) to crowds of many dozens, including women and children, rampaged through the narrow alleys of the Tibetan quarter. They battered the shutters of shops, broke in and seized whatever they could, from hunks of meat to gas canisters and clothing. Some goods they carried away, while other goods were thrown into large fires lit on the street.\\" Little children could also be seen looting a toy shop as well and mobs were attempting to ram the defenses of banks. The mobs also attacked any ethnic Chinese on the streets. James Miles reported seeing a Han Chinese teenage boy plead to a monk to help him hide because of the violence around the city. The Guardian reported that according to a foreign eyewitness account, rioters attacked Han, Muslim Hui and other ethnic minorities. Foreigners were not attacked. With the exception of Tibetan-owned hotels, many other hotels were vandalized and smashed. The foreign eyewitness also reported seeing three rioters repeatedly stabbing an unconscious man. After the Monday deadline, Chinese police announced on loudspeakers that anyone who took part in the violence and gave themselves up would be treated with leniency. According to the London-based Free Tibet Campaign, an eyewitness in Lhasa saw rioters set a mosque on fire late on Friday night and throw stones at people who appeared to be Hui. Other Western tourists emerged from Tibet with graphic descriptions of the level of violence that had occurred. Some claimed that they had seen non-Tibetan Chinese, including the elderly, being beaten and stoned to death by groups of Tibetans, supported by the crowd. Other events An eyewitness stated that police cars, fire engines and other official vehicles were set on fire after anger erupted following the police's dispersal of a peaceful demonstration near a small temple in Lhasa. According to CNN, Police used gunfire and tear gas to break up the protest. \\"The monks are still protesting. Police and army cars were burned. There are people crying,\\" she said. Tensions in Lhasa increased as the city's three biggest monasteries were sealed off by thousands of soldiers and armed police amid the largest protests in nearly two decades. Chinese authorities reportedly fired warning shots and used tear gas and electric prods to disperse hundreds of protesters, in addition to detaining up to 50 monks. US embassy officials in Beijing told the Associated Press that U.S. citizens had reportedly seen gunfire and rioting in Lhasa. Tibetan exiles quoted in the Times of London report that at least five people had been killed in police firing by March 15. According to a Tibetan who fled Tibet after the demonstrations in Lhasa, knife-wielding Chinese troops attacked Tibetan demonstrators on March 14, and several demonstrators died from gunshot and knife wounds. Aftermath In the aftermath of the riot, residents appeared to have mixed reactions to the violence. Some Tibetans celebrated by throwing toilet paper that resembled traditional Tibetan scarves over wires across the streets. However, \\"others appeared aghast at the violence.\\" Casualties The official Chinese media source Xinhua has reported that on March 14 in Lhasa \\"rioters injured 623 people including 241 police and armed police and killed 18 others. They also set fire to more than 300 locations, mostly private houses, stores and schools, smashed vehicles and damaged public facilities.\\" The official Chinese media has now published details including names and photographs of some of those they say were killed or injured during the rioting. According to Xinhua, local police have \\"confirmed\\" the identities of 14 out of the 18 \\"innocent civilians\\" killed in \\"Lhasa riots,\\" including one \\"eight-month-old infant\\" and one \\"ethnic Tibetan woman\\" in a fire, set by \\"arson\\". According to the Tibetan Center for Human Rights and Democracy, no less than 101 Tibetans were killed by Chinese security forces in Lhasa on March 14, 2008. The organization claims that a leaked Chinese government document from the \\"Criminal and Medical Examination Department of the Lhasa Public Security Bureau\\" confirms this number. Radio Free Asia and the International Campaign for Tibet reported that fresh protests broke out at the Ramoche Temple, situated in the northwest of Lhasa, March 29, 2008, as a 15-member group of diplomats from the United States, Japan and Europe returned to Beijing after a two-day visit to the Tibetan capital. However, independent verification of the protest could not be obtained.

It formed part of the 2008 Tibetan unrest and was one of two major events to happen in Sichuan during 2008, the other being the 2008 Sichuan earthquake in May 2008. Events On 16 March, Tibetan monks staged a protest against its harsh treatment by the Chinese government. The word got out and the police became involved. The monks and local residents clashed with police, killing at least one policeman, and setting fire to three or four police vans. In Aba, an eyewitness said 17 people were killed,Accounts from Lhasa and beyond, (19 March 2008), http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia- pacific/7302319.stm including a young girl that attended middle school. By 18 March, the witness described the area as teeming with police and soldiers, and the people as anxious. Protests continued for several days. On 24 March, AP reports that Chinese state-run Xinhua said \\"381 people involved in protests...had surrendered to police\\" in Aba, which was not verified by independent sources. Unverified reports As reported by the BBC, the unverified reports in Sichuan and the \\"expulsions and restrictions of foreigners, and uncorroborated reports of vast convoys of paramilitaries entering areas of unrest, raise fears that the government has created a \\"black box\\" in which its security personnel can take action without scrutiny.\\" The BBC also reports, \\"Unrest was also said to have flared again in Aba, Sichuan, where there are claims that police shot between 13 and 30 protesters after a police station was set on fire. Like Tibetan exiles' claims that at least 80 have died in Lhasa, the reports of deaths are impossible to verify because of the restrictions on journalists.\\" Crackdown on violence During the week of 22 March, authorities and security forces in the city of Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan, locked down a Tibetan neighborhood located near the Southwest University for Nationalities and the Wu Hou Temple. The lockdown comes amid unconfirmed reports of Tibetan protests earlier in the week and unconfirmed reports of a stabbing attack of a Han Chinese man by a Tibetan. Cars and other vehicles are not allowed to drive through the neighborhood, which has a large police presence. In Sichuan's Ngaba prefecture, Chinese authorities fired on protestors. The Tibetan government-in-exile's Central Tibetan Administration states the police shot and killed 19 people during the protest. The Chinese authorities denied killing anyone. Photographs of bodies with bullet wounds were released by a rights group. The Foreign Correspondents Club of China has reported \\"official interference with journalists in Chengdu\\", and that travel by foreign journalists to other areas of the province has been restricted. Arrests On 21, 27 March nuns of the Kirti Monastery in Ngawa county were arrested by Chinese police forces. The information was confirmed by the Swiss newspaper Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung after phonecalls into the region with locals. Troops also blocked roads in nearby Sertar. The London-based Free Tibet Campaign reported that troops had been sent to the county after residents blew up a bridge near the village of Gudu. Arrests have also been reported from Sertar after security forces cracked down on protests. Further clashes On Monday, 24 March 2008 in Drango county, Garze prefecture, a Tibetan rights group reports 200 monks, nuns, and ordinary people gathered to march before clashes with police began.

Independent verification is however outstanding. On 3 April new violence broke out in Sichuan as various sources report. According to Xinhua News Agency at least one government official has been seriously injured. An overseas Tibet activist group said eight people had been killed in the incident. It said police opened fire on hundreds of Buddhist monks and lay people who marched on local government offices to demand the release of two monks detained for possessing photographs of the Dalai Lama.

They were then designated as the 2nd (West African) Infantry Brigade.ordersofbattle.com: 2nd (West African) Infantry Brigade. In October 1942 command of the brigade passed to Brigadier Ernest Western who was to remain in this role until March 1945. In 1944, reorganized once more as an infantry brigade, the 2nd (West African) was attached to the 82nd (West Africa) Division and sailed for Ceylon, where the complete division was assembled on July 20. They then moved to Burma and took part in the third Arakan Campaign in December, 1944 as part of Philip Christison's XV Corps.Moreman 2005, p.268. It first advanced south along the Kalapanzin valley, then crossed a steep and jungle-covered mountain range to converge with the British 81st (West Africa) Division on Myohaung at the mouth of the Kaladan River. This move forced the Japanese to evacuate the Mayu peninsula which they had held for almost four years, and retreat south along the coast. They continued to advance maintaining pressure, on the Japanese capturing the port of Gwa shortly before the Japanese abandoned Burma. Western was wounded in March 1945 and command of the brigade was given to Brigadier Adam Wilson-Brand.

The Villa La Leopolda is a large detached villa in Villefranche-sur-Mer, in the Alpes-Maritimes department on the French Riviera. The villa is situated in 18 acres of grounds. The villa has had several notable owners including Gianni and Marella Agnelli, Izaak and Dorothy J. Killam, and, since 1987, by Edmond (1932‚Äì1999) and Lily Safra, who inherited the villa after her husband's death. History Villa La Leopolda in its current incarnation was designed and built from 1929 to 1931 by an American architect, Ogden Codman, Jr., on an estate once owned by King Leopold II of Belgium. Leopold had made the previous estate a present for his mistress Blanche Z√©lia Jos√©phine Delacroix, also known as Caroline Lacroix, and it derives its name from him.\\"Those Things Money Can Buy\\" Time. Retrieved March 16, 2010. After Leopold's death, Blanche Delacroix was evicted, and his nephew, King Albert I, became its owner. During World War I it was used as a military hospital. In 1919, Th√©r√®se Vitali, comtesse de Beauchamp, acquired the property and commissioned modifications. The American architect Ogden Codman, Jr. purchased the dozen existing structures that made up the property including two peasant cottages, and began his architectural magnum opus in 1929. It was complete by 1931, however financial difficulties (and his lavish expenditures) precluded his being able to live in it, so he rented it out to various well-heeled tenants. One famous English couple tried to lease it, but insisted on making changes that were contrary to Codman's aesthetic objectives and strict list of protective clauses. Negotiations in a Paris Hotel room broke down over the many restrictions Codman imposed, and Ogden's response was: \\"I regret that the House of Codman is unable to do business with the House of Windsor.\\" Codman's extensive designs and construction gave the estate, once a series of unrelated buildings, its current appearance. His neo-Palladian vision, coupled with his in-depth knowledge of historical precedent, resulted in the construction of a spectacular villa with extensive gardens and landscaping. Floor plans, letters, records, and stereo glass-plate views of the newly completed property still exist in the collections of the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities (aka \\"Historic New England\\") At Codman's death in 1951 the estate was sold to Izaak Walton Killam whose wife inherited the place after his death. In the later 1950s she sold it to Fiat president Gianni Agnelli (1921‚Äì2003) and Marella Agnelli. The Agnellis sold the Villa Leopolda to the Canadian philanthropist Dorothy J. Killam in 1963. Killam lived at the villa until her death there in 1965. Edmond and Lily Safra In 1987 La Leopolda had become one of the properties owned by the Lebanese born Brazilian banker Edmond Safra and his wife, Lily. The Safras commissioned Renzo Mongiardino as interior designer, while the second-floor bedrooms were decorated by Mica Erteg√ºn. The Safras held large parties at the villa, and, at a 1988 party, female guests were given an enameled box with a portrait of the Villa Leopolda. Safra's guest list was so vast that there was a party on the Saturday and a second party on the Monday. Tulips were airlifted in from Holland, the food was arranged by the famed chef Roger Verge of the Moulin de Mougins, and the music was provided by Safra's favourite musicians, the Brazilian band leader Sergio Mendes who had flown in from California with his entire orchestra, and pianist David Wood who had flown in from the UK with his quartet. The party was described by author John Fairchild as the \\"ultimate in conspicuous consumption\\". The banker Bill Browder recounted visiting Safra at the Villa Leopolda with Beny Steinmetz in his 2014 memoir Red Notice. Security was provided for Safra at the villa by a team of former Israeli commando soldiers. The Safras lived some 10 miles from the Villa Leopolda, in a penthouse apartment in Monaco. Mikhail Prokhorov The Russian billionaire businessman Mikhail Prokhorov made several attempts via Ignace Meuwissen to buy the Villa Leopolda from Safra before she finally accepted his offer for ‚Ç¨370 million (plus ‚Ç¨19.5 million for the villa's furniture) in the summer of 2008. Initial reports on the villa's sale in July 2008 had falsely identified fellow Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich as the purchaser. Prokhorov would later deny that he had bought the property, with his spokesperson saying that he had refused to do business in France after his 2007 detention by French police for allegedly providing prostitutes for guests at Courchevel, the ski resort in the French Alps. No charges were ever filed against Prokhorov in the prostitution case. Prokhorov attempted to withdraw from the sale in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, which led to a lawsuit between Prokhorov and Safra over the ‚Ç¨39 million deposit that he had paid on the villa. A French court ruled against Prokhorov in November 2012 with Safra subsequently announcing that she would donate his deposit to various global charities. Historical monument La Leopolda invokes the style of the Belle √âpoque. It is registered as a French monument historique.French classification as a historical monument In popular culture The villa was used as the location of Lermontov's villa in 1948 film The Red Shoes. The heroine climbs the steps to the villa thinking that she's been invited to dinner. Instead she would be given the starring role in the new ballet. Alfred Hitchcock used La Leopolda as a set in his 1955 movie To Catch a Thief. There's a different reference saying that the house used in the To Catch a Thief is Ch√¢teau de la Croix-des- Gardes, 145 Boulevard Leader, not Villa Leopolda. \\" Bill Browder mentions meeting Edmond Safra at the villa during his book Red Notice.

It is significant for the ruins of one of the 19th century's largest ice harvesting factories and the occasional outflow of water in two directions.  Geography  The lac de Sylans fills part of the Nantua water gap, which was formed during the last glacial era. The formation of the lake itself is much more recent; it is the result of the collapse of the cliff on the Northern side of the valley a few centuries ago.Cr√©ation du lac, sur nantua-tourisme.com This huge landslide partially blocked the valley between the ice factory and the source of the Doye, above les Neyrolles, blocking the river that was flowing along what is now the bed of the lake, causing the lake to form. Today the water percolates through the landslide debris to form the source of the Doye. In dry summers the level of the lake can fall by 5m, whereas during wet periods, the level can rise to a point where the water also flows out towards Saint-Germain-de-Joux and Bellegarde-sur-Valserine, at the other end of the water gap, via the Combet stream, which flows into the Semine then the Valserine, which flows into the Rh√¥ne.  History   Ice Harvesting Factory  Former lac de Sylans ice factory Lac de Sylans The ice factory was built in 1865 after Joachim Moinat had the idea to use the very pure ice that covered the lake every year in his caf√©. This purity meant the ice could be used as is without purification. To store the ice, he built a wooden hut. In 1875, a second building was erected. This one was equipped with cavity walls in which the cavity was filled with sawdust for better thermal insulation. In 1885, he sold the business to the soci√©t√© des glaci√®res de Paris. There followed, between 1890 and 1910, the construction of further buildings in wood then in stone. These building served as dwellings offices, a canteen, a stable and a repair workshop. Later when the Haut-Bugey railway line was opened, 20 to 30 wagons loaded with 10 tonnes each departed every day of the summer for Paris, Lyon, Marseille, Toulon and even Alger. These loads were covered with a jute mat, straw and a tarpaulin for insulation. Losses were reasonable, as for 10 tonnes shipped, about 8 arrived in Paris. By 1880, the factory was producing 300,000 tons per year on average. Machines able to make ice from water appeared around 1900. The warmer winters of 1911 to 1913 and the First World War saw an end to production in 1917. Today, only a few traces remain of what was one of the largest ice factories of the 19th century. Some restoration has taken place, revealing how the warehouses might have been.  Transport Infrastructure  Running on each side of the lake are two important transport arteries. On the south side the Haut-Bugey railway line, initially a regional line from Bourg en Bresse to Bellegarde, but rebuilt in 2010 to carry TGVs from Geneva to Paris On the northern side the A40 autoroute connecting Switzerland and Northern Italy (via the Mont Blanc tunnel) to France.

African Studies Review. September 2003 He is credited with spreading the use of the written word in his native Ghana.World development report 2009: reshaping economic geography, p.168. World Bank Publications, 2008. Though a former slave, Capitein wrote a dissertation defending the right of Christians to keep slaves. Early years Capitein, whose African name is unknown, was forcibly taken from his parents in present-day Ghana in 1725, at the age of 8, and sold as a slave to a Dutch captain, Arnold Steenhart. That same year, Steenhart gave him as a present to Jacobus van Goch, a trader of the Dutch West India Company. At the age of 11, in 1728, Capitein was brought to Holland to live with van Goch in The Hague. Van Goch treated him as an adopted son and gave him the last name of Capitein (Dutch for \\"captain\\"). Jacobus was placed in school and found to excel in the study of painting, reading and writing, mathematics and the classical languages. Capitein, who was baptized by the Dutch Reformed Church in 1735, let it be known that he wished to return to Africa as a missionary. His adopted father therefore allowed him in 1737 to attend the venerable University of Leiden in order to study theology and become a minister. Dissertation During his time at Leiden, Capitein did not challenge the general attitude towards slavery in the Dutch republic. In his dissertation De servitude, libertati christianae non contraria on March 10, 1742, he defended slavery as niet strydig tegen de christelyke vryheid (\\"not in conflict with Christian liberty\\"). He argued that slavery was justified by biblical precedent, and served evangelical ends by spreading Christianity. He stressed that a slave who becomes a Christian does not need to be freed, and that slave owners therefore should allow their slaves to be baptized. It is not clear whether Capitein actually received his doctorate with this dissertation, as he is not listed in the university's archives.

Portrait (1742) JacobusCapitein1.jpegPortrait in the dissertation (March 1742) JacobusCapitein4.jpegHandwriting in Friendship book W. Muilman (June 1742) Missionary His defense of slavery made him popular with the Dutch West India Company, and he was appointed minister of the fort of Elmina, the hub of the Dutch slave trade along the Gold Coast (present-day Ghana). After a short tour of the Netherlands, where he was celebrated as the \\"black minister\\", he left for Elmina. However, his duties as minister and missionary proved difficult. The white slave traders did not like him because he was black and because he did not approve of the slave traders' extramarital affairs. Contact with the other Africans was difficult because Capitein had become too Dutch, and his efforts to baptize the local population proved fruitless. To improve his contact with the Africans, Capitein proposed a marriage with a local girl, but the church did not approve of a marriage to a \\"heathen\\" and instead found him a Dutch bride, Antonia Ginderdros, whom he wed in 1745 - the first wedding among the Europeans at Elmina. Although he had little success as a missionary, Capitein did manage to set up a school and an orphanage at Elmina. His greatest success came in 1744 when Opoku Ware I, king of the Asantes, requested that Capitein educate his children. Capitein tried to send the children to the Netherlands to be educated, but this was not allowed. However, one of the King's sons', Gyakye, was sent on a diplomatic mission to the Dutch republic, carrying a gift of ten elephants' teeth. Legacy Jacobus Capitein's role in history has long been neglected or dismissed as a curiosity because, as a defender of slavery, he was an unlikely role model for black emancipation. However, Capitein's position on slavery should be viewed in the light of his time. Capitein's views fitted in the 18th-century climate in which the church had adapted to the slave trade, which had become one of the pillars of the Dutch republic's powerful economy. A rejection of slavery on principle was not considered an option, although some did decry the excesses of the slave trade. The primary goal of Capitein's thesis was to encourage baptism of Africans by arguing that Africans could be baptized yet remain slaves. Capitein thereby presented a counterargument to Godefridus Corneliszoon Udemans (1581-1649), a Dutch minister who had argued that slaves should be freed seven years after they were baptized. This would have effectively rendered baptism a unpopular, because slave owners were eager to keep their ownership of the enslaved Africans and would therefore have seen this as creating a disincentive to have their slaves to be baptized. Whether Capitein's goal should be judged positive or not is open to debate. Capitein's main importance is his translation of the Lord's Prayer and the Ten Commandments in Mfantse, one of the languages spoken around the Gold Coast in 1744. These translations are among the first written word in Ghana.World Bank Group, World development report 2009: reshaping economic geography, p.168. World Bank Publications, 2008.

History Rayleigh Windmill was built in 1809 for Thomas Higgs, a timber merchant of Rayleigh. Higgs was bankrupt in 1815 and the mill was sold to William Hart of Woodham Mortimer in 1817. Hart sold the mill to George Britton in 1845 and the mill passed to his sons John and Samuel in 1869. ¬£150 was spent putting the mill into repair. The Britton brothers left Rayleigh in 1884 and were bankrupt in 1886. Thomas James Brown was the next miller, and the last to work the mill by wind c1907. The cap and sails were removed c1909 and the mill was worked by a steam engine then an oil engine and latterly by electric motor until at least 1937. The mill was taken over for use as a museum by Rayleigh and District Antiquarian and Natural History Society, formally opening on 16 May 1970. The capless mill stood for many years with a crenellated top but in 1972 Rayleigh Urban District Council launched an appeal to restore the mill as a landmark. By the autumn of 1974 a new cap and sails had been made and fitted by millwrights John Lawn and Philip Barrett-Lennard. In 2005, restoration work costing ¬£340,000 was funded by the Thames Gateway South Essex Partnership. Description Rayleigh Windmill is a six-storey tower mill with a Kentish cap winded by a six bladed fantail. The mill had two single Spring sails and two Common sails carried on a cast iron windshaft. The tower has no batter until second floor level, where the stage is. The tower is diameter at base level and internal diameter at the curb. The brickwork is thick at base level and at curb level it is thickened out to . The mill is high to the top of the cap. The mill drove three pairs of millstones.

It was launched in 2004 by Robert Greubel and Stephen Forsey and is based in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland. Greubel Forsey makes timepieces with multiple tourbillons and inclined balance wheels with the aim of improving timekeeping precision. Their approach was validated in 2011 when a Greubel Forsey Double Tourbillon Technique won the 2011 International Chronometry Competition held by the Le Locle Museum of Horology.It us the most accurate mechanical wrist watch.Report on the 2011 International Chronometry Competition by the magazine of Haute Horlogerie  Corporate history  Greubel Forsey Manufacture Robert Greubel and Stephen Forsey launched Greubel ForseyHistory of Greubel Forsey, HauteHorologer.org in 2004 at BaselWorld with the introduction of their Double Tourbillon 30¬∞ (DT30). Both men had been working together since 1992 at Renaud & Papi,\\"Renaud & Papi - Design: company profile\\", Chronometrie where they developed complicated watch movements. The Richemont group acquired a 20% stake in Greubel Forsey‚Äôs share capital in 2006.Richmont/Greubel Forsey, entry in the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry In 2006 the company collaborated with American jeweller Harry Winston to make the Opus 6 model. The company has invented and presented a number of tourbillon-based watches including: the Double Tourbillon 30¬∞ (DT30¬∞), the Quadruple Tourbillon √† Diff√©rentiel, the Tourbillon 24 Secondes Inclin√© and the GMT. At the 2012 SIHH Greubel Forsey presented their first non-tourbillon model, the Double Balancier 35¬∞. Greubel Forsey specializes in designing and manufacturing high-end watches that are usually, but not exclusively, based on the Tourbillon escapement, and is reputed for their high level of hand finishing.  Inventions   Double Tourbillon  Double Tourbillon 30¬∞ mechanism ''' Double Tourbillon 30¬∞ (DT30¬∞) Vision/Secret''' The DT30¬∞ was presented in 2004 and features one 30¬∞ inclined tourbillon cage rotating once per minute inside another tourbillon cage rotating in four minutes. The company claims rotating one inclined Tourbillon inside another averages out and minimizes gravitationally induced errors on the balance.  Quadruple Tourbillon  The Quadruple Tourbillon uses two double-tourbillons‚Äîfour tourbillon cages in total‚Äîworking independently to average out and minimize gravitationally induced errors on the balance. A spherical differential connects the four rotating carriages, distributing torque between two wheels rotating at different speeds. The Quadruple Tourbillon Secret, presented in 2012, houses a modified Quadruple Tourbillon ‚Äòhidden‚Äô under a full dial. The movement can be seen through the display back and the two double tourbillon systems‚Äîwith four tourbillons in all‚Äîare configured head-to-tail and are coupled by a spherical differential.  GMT  GMT in red gold Presented in 2011, the GMT is the first Greubel Forsey timepiece to feature a complication other than a tourbillon. It displays a second time zone at 10 o‚Äôclock and the world by a rotating, three-dimensional globe at 8 o‚Äôclock. The position of the continents on the titanium globe are cross-referenced with the 24-hour chapter ring circling it for an approximate indication of time all over the world. Other indications include an hour-minute dial at 1 o‚Äôclock, a small seconds dial on top of that at 3 o‚Äôclock and at 4 o‚Äôclock a sectorial power reserve indicator. The movement was especially developed for this timepiece and features the 25¬∞ inclined Tourbillon 24 Secondes cage. Since it was first launched, the GMT has been released in rose gold, white gold, and in platinum.  Tourbillon 24 Secondes Contemporain The Tourbillon 24 Secondes Contemporain,24 Secondes Contemporain Tourbillon 24 Secondes Contemporain launched in 2012, has royal blue titanium plates and bridges with the movement architecture emphasising the technical aspects of the movement. A 24-second tourbillon is suspended by a transparent synthetic sapphire tourbillon. The T24 Second Contemporain is also notable for its round case, as opposed to the asymmetrical cases that Greubel Forsey are better known for.  Double Balancier 35¬∞ The Double Balancier 35¬∞ Balancier 35¬∞ Double Balancier 35¬∞ features two inclined fixed-oscillators coupled with a spherical differential, which provides the average of their rates to the gear train and time display. Between the two visible inclined balances, small seconds at 7 o‚Äôclock displays the running instantaneous average of the two regulators, while a 72-hour power reserve indicator at 2 o‚Äôclock keeps track of available power.

From 1939 to 1948 he taught at the University of Virginia, after which he moved to Yale University. At Yale, he became the Philip Schuyler Beebe Professor of Mathematics, and chaired the mathematics department for ten years. He was also a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, which he visited in 1933, 1938, and 1953.Hedlund, Gustav A., Institute for Advanced Study He retired from Yale in 1972, but afterwards held a visiting professorship at Wesleyan University.

It was built in the late 18th century. Today, it is listed in the National Register of Historic Places and is a New York City designated landmark. It is one of the few existing examples of Federal architecture in New York. Its ground level is the site of The Ear Inn, one of the oldest existing taverns in New York City. History The first record in New York City of the two-and-a-half-story Flemish brick house which features a gambrel roof and dormers was in 1817, the year Greenwich Village was formally incorporated into New York City. The building was originally the home of James Brown,\\"James Brown House Designation Report\\" New York Landmarks Preservation Commission (November 19, 1969) an African-American Revolutionary War veteran, who was the proprietor of a tobacco store on the ground floor of the house. At the time of the building's construction, the house was only several feet from the shoreline of the Hudson River, although subsequent urban development has since filled in land that has increased the distance to the shore. Brown sold the building to two apothecaries in the mid-19th century, and records show that a tavern occupied the shop from at least 1835; it was likely a bar even earlier than that,Amateau, Albert. \\"Ear Inn has colorful history and uncertain future\\" The Villager (August 27 ‚Äì September 2, 2003) making it one of the oldest taverns in New York City. The house was purchased in 1890 by an Irish immigrant named Thomas Cloke,Dwyer, Kevin \\"Blasts from the Past\\" New York (June 6, 2005) who ran a tavern and sold beer and spirits to sailors and longshoremen. The tavern had a brewery that was later turned into a restaurant. Cloke was reported to be a successful businessman and was well regarded in the community. Cloke sold the business in 1919 in anticipation of the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which prohibited the sale of alcohol. During Prohibition, the restaurant became a speakeasy, while the upstairs floors were variously a boarding house, a headquarters for smugglers, and a brothel. After Prohibition, the bar re-opened, but now existed as a business without a name. It was simply called \\"The Green Door\\", and catered to a clientele of waterfront workers, almost all of whom were hard-drinking regulars. The area declined sharply during the mid-20th century, as urban decay turned the once-bustling area into a nearly abandoned district. In 1969, the building was one of the earliest designations of the city's Landmarks Commission. In the mid 1970s, a group of struggling artists including Sari Dienes and Rip Hayman purchased the lease, and in 1977, they re-opened the bar. Due to restrictions on changing signage on historic buildings, however, the new proprietor Rip Hayman simply painted out part of the letter B in the \\"Bar\\" sign, turning it into the word \\"Ear\\", after The Ear, a music magazine they published upstairs. Known as an avant-garde hangout for musicians, poets, and artist, poetry readings and performances became well attended. Today Today, the James Brown House remains largely unchanged from its past appearance, even as urban renewal has transformed the area around it. Indeed, as part of the permitting process, real-estate developers have paid for thousands of dollars in repairs and improvements to the building, including a backyard fire escape. The Ear Inn continues to thrive as a bar and restaurant, under the proprietorship of Martin Sheridan; the building is still owned by composer and maritime lecturer Rip Hayman, and features memorabilia from its past.Lombino, David. \\"A Gleaming Urban Glass House Astonishes Spring Street\\" New York Sun (November 6, 2006) See also *List of New York City Designated Landmarks in Manhattan below 14th Street *National Register of Historic Places listings in Manhattan below 14th Street References Notes Other sources *Coe, Andrew.

It is found in Europe, Mongolia and western Russia. This species has become very scarce in Northern Ireland, with recent records from northern County Armagh and western County Fermanagh, and because of its rarity there, it is listed as a Northern Ireland Priority Species. Description The wingspan is . The antennae, head, thorax, legs and abdomen are shiny green (the thorax is occasionally blue green and shimmering). However, the wings may appear rusty- red in the early morning and evening. The wide forewings are less glossy than the body, mostly blue green, sometimes also green to yellow green. The fringes are blackish grey. The hindwings are moderately wide with a slightly truncated rim, They are slightly transparent, blackish grey and lightened basally. The underside of both pairs of wings is grey. The caterpillars are pale yellowish- green with a central dark stripe and fine white hairs dorsally. The wings of the green forester contains two types of colored scales, of which one contains pores of different sizes. These pores are able to fill with water, which causes the color of the scales to change from green to rusty-red.

The larvae feed on various species of Rumex, such as Rumex acetosa and Rumex acetosella. The eggs are laid on the leaf blade; the larva mines the leaf when it is small, but later moves to the lower parts of the plant and feeds on the leaves. When fully developed it descends to the ground and pupates in a cocoon among the vegetation.

It is located in the city of Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India. It is constructed on a high rock.India By Sarina Singh, Joe Bindloss, Paul Clammer, Janine Eberle There are two Hindu temples inside, the Ucchi Pillayar Temple, Rockfort and the Thayumanaswami Temple, Rockfort. Other local tourist attractions include the famous Pallava-era Ganesha temple and the Madurai Nayak-era fort. The fort complex has witnessed fierce battles between the Madurai Nayakas and Adil Shahi dynasty of Bijapur, Carnatic region and Maratha Imperial forces. The fort played an important part during the Carnatic Wars, helping lay the foundations of the British Empire in India. The Rockfort is the most prominent landmark of the city. History The name \\"Rockfort\\" comes from frequent military fortification built here, first by the emperors of the Vijayanagara Empire and later by the British Empire during the Carnatic Wars. The oldest structure in the fort is a cave temple built by the Pallavas in 580. During the Chola period, the nearby town of Woraiyur was their capital, but the Pallavas did not keep control of this strategic city and lost it to the Pandyas. The Cholas reasserted themselves in the 10th century. Trichy continued to be in their possession until the decline of the empire, after which it became a Vijayanagara stronghold. In the mid 14th century, the region was controlled by the Delhi Sultanate after Malik Kafur's raid on South India. They were ousted and the region came under the control of Vijayanagara. During the early part of the 16th century, the region came under the control of the Madurai Nayaks, who were the earlier governors of Vijayanagara Empire. However, it was under the Nayaks of Madurai that Tiruchirapalli prospered in its own right and grew to be the city that it is today. The Madurai Nayaks constructed the Rock Fort Temple Lake along with major walls as foundations, establishing the town as a trading city and later, their capital. During ruling period of Madurai Nayak Queen Meenatchi, The fort palace was occupied by the invader Chanda Sahib, as he ruled in conjunction with the alliance with the Kingdom of France. He lost this command when his uncle, the Nawab of the Carnatic along with the British, seized the fort after the Carnatic wars. This enabled the British to gain a foothold in Tamil Nadu and later all of South India. In modern times, the fort is maintained and administered by the Chennai Circle of the Archaeological Survey of India. The fort is one of the prominent tourist destinations in Tamil Nadu. Major battles Nayak era As the Rockfort was the capital of the Madurai Nayaks, the fort has witnessed fierce battles. One of the largest was the Battle of Toppur for supremacy between the Aravidu dynasty of Vijayanagara and the Madurai Nayaks. The former won, with support from the rulers of Mysore and Thanjavur in the 16th century. Later, the Nayaks faced fierce attacks from Adil Shahi, Mysorean and Imperial Maratha troops. The Fort complex formed the northwest territory to the Nayaks. During their two-century rule, they had occasional skirmishes with their neighbours, the Thanjavur Nayak kingdom, the Thanjavur Maratha kingdom, and, more frequently, with the invading Adil Shahi, Kingdom of Mysore, and Imperial Maratha armies. Carnatic Nawabs During the mid century, Chanda Sahib, aided by the French, made this fort his home base. He battled with the combined forces of the Carnatic Nawab and British. He was defeated in the Carnatic wars and was forced to cede his lands to the British. British periods In the late 18th century, Hyder Ali was a major threat to the British, as were the French who were still fighting for their colonial supremacy in this region. By now, the town was firmly established as a Cantonment town and the fort's gate was known as main guard gate. Robert Clive lived near the tank when he was in Tiruchirappalli. Architecture Tiruchirapalli Rock Fort The rock is said to be one of the oldest formations in the world. It is 3.8 billion years old, making it as old as the rocks in Greenland and older than the Himalayas.Pippa de Bruyn: \\"Frommer's India\\", Frommer's, 2010, Quartz, used in glass making, and feldspar, used in ceramics, are found in this rock formation. As the name suggests, the Rock Fort Temple is situated on 83 metre-high outcrops. The Pallavas initially built this temple, but the Nayaks made use of its naturally fortified position and designed it again. It is a long climb up the 344 steps cut into the stone to the top. The temple complex in the fort complex is a collection of three temples: * the Manikka Vinayakar temple at the foot of the hill, dedicated to Lord Ganesha * the Ucchi Pillayar Temple at the top of the hill, dedicated to Lord Ganesha * the Taayumaanavar Koyil Shivastalam, a rock cut temple dedicated to a Nayaka era saint, Taayumaanavar. Mathrubutheswarar, dedicated to Lord Shiva, has a lingam which is a projection of the rock itself. It is reached by a flight of steps on the way to Ucchi Pillayar Temple. thumb  Rock-cut temple  Interior of a Temple on the Rock of Trichinopoly (1847) There are two rock cut temples in the fort, one in the lower part of the fort called Lower Cave temple and other in the complex outside the Thayumanswamny on the way up to Uchi Pillayar Kovil, called the Upper Cave temple. An archaeological study in 2010 revealed that the layout of the rock-cut caves in the temple is similar to that of other rock-cut temples such as the Pundarikakshan Perumal Temple at Thiruvellarai and Pechipalai cave temple. The unfinished caves in the temple, along with the lower cave temples in Thiruvellarari and Tirupparankunram, each have a shrine for Shiva in the east and Vishnu in the west, separated by a central bay between them. The study also revealed that the Lower Cave temple along with Kudumiyan Malai temple exhibited unique form of pillars, which are otherwise not seen in other temples in Tamil Nadu. The rock-cut temple in the hill temple complex was built during the Pallava era and is named Lalitankura Pallaveswaram, with several inscriptions attributed to Mahendravarman I. The Cholas, the Vijayanagara emperors and the Nayaks of Madurai have made extensive contributions here. The two-storey-tall Taayumaanava temples are considered to be a masterpiece of construction.

It is usually placed in a small subfamily Scythropiinae, which is sometimes included in the Yponomeutinae of the Yponomeutidae.FE (2009a), and see references in Savela (2001) Described as Phalaena crataegella by Linnaeus in 1767, it was made the type species of Scythropia, the only Scythropiinae genus currently recognized, by Jacob H√ºbner in the 1820s. Initially (in 1796), H√ºbner had misidentified the grass moth Eudonia lacustrata - much larger and only distantly related, but somewhat similar in color and pattern - as Linnaeus' Phalaena crataegella. Similarly, a junior synonym of this species, Tinea cornella, has frequently been misapplied - and sometimes still is even today - to the fairly closely related apple blossom tineid.Pitkin & Jenkins (2004ab), FE (2009a), and see references in Savela (2001) Description and ecology S. crataegella is a small moth is widespread almost all over Europe; it is absent from Great Britain north of The Lake District, and has also not been recorded yet on Iceland and Ireland (where it is probably genuinely absent), in Portugal (where it may be absent), and in Slovenia (where it probably occurs but has not been found yet, as its range includes the surrounding countries). It is quite common throughout its range. The nocturnal adults are attracted to light sources; on Great Britain they are only commonly seen in July, but elsewhere they may be found from late May to September and have two generations per year.FE (2009b), Kimber [2010], and see references in Savela (2001) The wingspan of adults is 11‚Äì15 mm. As usual for the Yponomeutidae, the forewings have a bold black-and-white pattern: two thick but irregular black bands divide the white forewings into roughly equal inner, middle and outer parts, and the white between the bands has numerous small black spots. The hindwings are dusky greyish-brown and unadorned. The body is whitish. The caterpillar larvae feed in large groups from the safety of a silken web they produce together; young larvae are leaf miners. The mainstay food is leaves of Crataegus (hawthorn), hence the species' name. But they have also been recorded from other Amygdaloideae, e.g. blackthorn (Prunus spinosa) and other Prunus species, Cotoneaster, as well as Malus sylvestris and Pyrus (pear).Kimber [2010], and see references in Savela (2001) References * Fauna Europaea (FE) (2009a): Argyresthia (Argyresthia) curvella.

Car park to the north of the eastern end of Park End Street. This area used to be the basin at the end of the Oxford Canal. View south from the bridge on Park End Street of the Castle Mill Stream, a branch of the River Thames. Park End Street is a street in central Oxford, England, to the west of the centre of the city, close to the railway station at its western end. Location To the east, New Road links Park End Street to central Oxford. To the west, Frideswide Square links Park End Street with Botley Road, the main arterial road in and out of Oxford to and from the west. Parallel to the street to the north is Hythe Bridge Street. At the junction with New Road, Worcester Street leads north and Tidmarsh Lane leads south. At the junction with Frideswide Square, Rewley Road leads north and Hollybush Row leads south. History Park End Street was built in 1769‚Äì70 as part of New Road, a new turnpike road between central Oxford and the west. It bypassed the earlier and narrower Hythe Bridge Street to the north and St. Thomas's High Street (now St Thomas' Street) to the south. Pacey's Bridge was built to carry the eastern part of Park End Street across Castle Mill Stream, which is part of the River Thames. The street's name is derived from a wharf where coal from Parkend in the Forest of Dean was delivered by barge. From the 1840s, railways took an increasing share of coal traffic. Inland waterways' share of the traffic declined and in 1885 Park End Wharf was redeveloped for other purposes (see below). Public house By the early part of the 19th century, a public house had been opened at 1 Park End Street on the north side of the street just east of the bridge. It was named the Queen's Arms, almost certainly after Charlotte of Mecklenburg- Strelitz, Queen Consort of George III. The pub is currently called Lighthouse after being refurbished in 2014. Breweries In 1885 Park End Wharf was redeveloped as the site of the Tower Brewery, which its owner F. Phillips then expanded in the 1890s and 1900s to designs by local architect H.J. Tollit. Before the Tower Brewery was built, the Eagle Brewery was already on a site next to the wharf. Its owner William Miller renamed it the Eagle Steam Brewery to advertise its conversion to steam powered brewing, and then in 1869 sold it to J.N. Weaving. In 1871 Weaving demolished part of the brewery to build a granary and in 1872 he added a three-storey malthouse. Weaving's successor F. Phillips continued to expand the business, including the addition of a new tower brewhouse, chimney and other buildings in 1885 designed by H.J. Tollit. No buildings of either the Eagle or the Tower breweries now survive. Railway station From 1851 Oxford Rewley Road railway station was on the corner of Park End Street and Rewley Road. British Railways closed the station in 1951 and its goods yard in 1984. The station was dismantled and moved to Buckinghamshire Railway Centre in 1999 to make way for the creation of Frideswide Square and building of Sa√Ød Business School.Contact us , Sa√Ød Business School, University of Oxford Warehouse Archer, Cowley & Co's Cantay Depositories furniture warehouse was designed by Tollit and built in 1901. Behind its decorative gabled red brick facade, Cantay Depositories has a steel frame and iron columns cast by William Lucy's Eagle Ironworks in Jericho, Oxford. As a warehouse the building had of storage space and was segregated into sections by armoured, fire-proof doors that would close automatically in the event of fire. Cantay House is now Oxford Conference Centre, a nightclub, and a retail store. Marmalade factory From 1903 until after the Second World War Frank Cooper's Oxford Marmalade was made at a factory at 27 Park End Street (now part of Frideswide Square) next to Victoria Buildings. In the sixties and seventies the building was used as offices by various sections of Oxforshire County Council. The former factory is now a listed building. It is now called \\"The Jam Factory\\" and houses an arts centre, restaurant, and bar. \\"The Jam Factory\\" also houses Guardian Award-winning charity, \\"My Life My Choice\\" run by and for people with learning disabilities. Motor trade From the end of the First World War a number of car and motorcycle traders had premises in Park End Street. They included King's Motors and Hartwell's, both of which were founded in Oxford in 1919, and Leyton's, which was taken over by King's but remained a separate subsidiary. By 1930 Howard King had premises in Park End Street with showroom space for 100 motorcycles. In 1934 King's had larger premises built at 15 Park End Street with showroom space for 500 motorcycles. The 1934 showroom is a two- storey Art Deco building whose facade is of yellow Bath Stone ashlar to match the Royal Oxford Hotel next door. The bespoke etched glass panels depicting 30's motoring scenes which were above Kings main showroom windows were saved and are now on display in Bealieu Motor Museum. H.F. Temple was another motorcycle dealer in the 1940s/50s; their premises were situated at 46 Park End Street and also 69 High Street, St Thomas, Oxford. Temples was the main Oxford supplier for the BSA C11G and C12 and is listed in the 1956 BSA C12 Owners handbook as being the only BSA dealer in the city*. (*Source from the 1956 BSA C12 Owners handbook, listing all addresses/suppliers in the UK at this time). Eyles and Coxeter was another motor dealer in Park End Street in the sixties, they were sited alongside Lower Fisher Row, currently the site of Sushimania, their workshops stretched way down alongside Lower Fisher Row, in the showroom alongside, catering for the 'county' set, they sold Rover, Jaguar, Land Rover and Rice horse boxes. All but one of the motor traders have now moved to premises further from central Oxford. Hartwell's former premises are now a branch of Office Outlet, formerly Staples Inc. Only King's former premises remain in the motor trade: it is now a branch of Kwik-Fit.

It is located at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation's (ANSTO) Lucas Heights site, 40 km south west of Sydney, in New South Wales, Australia. The Institute was formed in December 2002 in preparation for the start-up of the Open-pool Australian lightwater reactor in 2006, and named as a tribute to the father-and-son team Sir William Henry Bragg and son William Lawrence Bragg, who were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1915 for pioneering the analysis of crystal structures by means of X-rays. Following a restructure of scientific operations in 2016, the Institute was split to form two distinct research platforms, ACNS and the National Deuteration Facility. ACNS operates the cold- and thermal-neutron scattering facility associated with the OPAL research reactor, including 14 operational neutron beam instruments, and one instrument in transfer from the BER-II Research Reactor at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin. It houses a helium-3 polarisation system to enable polarised-neutron experiments, two small-angle X-ray scattering instruments, an X-ray reflectometer and Physical Properties Measurement System. Neutron scattering covers an extremely wide range of disciplines from fundamental physics, through chemistry, materials, and biology, right through to interdisciplinary areas such as engineering and archaeology. Science at the Australian Centre for Neutron Scattering covers many of these areas, usually in collaboration with other groups, with a focus on the application of neutron scattering to crystallography, soft condensed matter, solid-state physics, physical chemistry and increasingly biology. The ACNS identifies 6 key scientific projects: The Food Science Project, Thermo- Mechanical Processes, Energy Materials, Magnetism, Cultural Heritage and Planetary Materials. From its inception until 2016, the Institute was led by Robert Robinson. In 2016 Jamie Schulz became leader of the ACNS. ACNS currently employs approximately 100 staff. Access to the neutron instrumentation at the ACNS is available to all qualified applications through either proprietary fee-for-service research, non-proprietary peer reviewed merit access, non-proprietary peer reviewed research program process for 3-year programs, or fast-turnaround experiments. Research proposals are accepted and reviewed twice yearly via the ACNS Customer Portal.

Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles. 614 pp. 52 plates. LCCN 89-50342. . Description G. ussuriensis on Jeju island. Adult males are 37‚Äì63 cm (14.6-24.8 inches) in total length, while adult females are 41-64.7 cm (16.1-25.5 inches). However, this information, provided by Emelianov (1929), included two males of 37 cm (14.6 in) each which may have been subadults; the next largest male was 41.8 cm (16.5 in). Based on these same data, tail length in males was 12-17% of total length, while that in females was 12-15% of total length. The scalation usually includes 21 rows of dorsal scales at midbody, all of which are keeled (although the keels on the first scale rows are faint), 146-157 ventral scales, and 39-54 subcaudal scales. There are 7 supralabial scales, with the second being the smallest and the fourth usually the largest. The color pattern consists of a light brownish gray to blackish ground color overlaid with a series of 24-33 relatively large and usually elliptical dorsolateral blotches. These blotches, which may oppose or alternate on either side of the middorsal line, are usually closed and have a pale interior with a dark smudge in the center that makes them look like a row of bull's-eyes on either side of the body. The bloches are separated laterally by one scale row, extend down to the first scale row, and may merge with blotches across the middorsal line. A dark postocular stripe is present that is bordered above by a narrow yellow or white line. Geographic range Found in far east Russia (Primorskiy Kray), northeastern China, North Korea and South Korea, as well as on Quelpart Island. Chernov proposed that the type locality be restricted to \\"Suchan River (in Primorskiy Kray).\\" Taxonomy This species has long been confused with G. saxatilis in Korea and G. brevicaudus in eastern parts of Liaoning in China, where it is sympatric with these forms. Its variable color pattern has not helped matters either.

Its formation of a vast chain of retail stores in the late 1920s is seen as the first step in the development of a UK food retail market dominated by a small number of food multiples. History Shop assistants outside the Home and Colonial Stores on Broad Street, Waterford, May 1910 The business was founded by Julius Drewe, who went into partnership with John Musker in 1883, selling groceries at a small colonial goods store in Edgware Road in London.Julius Drewe at Oxford Dictionary of National Biography He subsequently opened stores in Islington, Birmingham and Leeds. The shops mainly sold tea; by 1885 they were trading as the 'Home & Colonial Tea Association'. On the incorporation of the business in 1888, William Slaughter took over as chairman. By the turn of the century the company had over 100 stores;20th Century London Posters by 1903, it had 500. Home and Colonial bought the share capital of Maypole Dairies of Wolverhampton from the Watson family in 1924. Between 1924 and 1931, several stores, including Liptons, merged with Home and Colonial to form a company with over 3,000 branches.Supermarkets; a report on the supply of groceries from multiple stores in the United Kingdom. Volume 2, page 8, The Competition Commission, October 2000 Within this period of rapid change, Home and Colonial formed Allied Suppliers to act as a buyer on behalf of the whole group.Home & Colonial Stores, The Times, 8 March, P.19, 1930 From 1948 until 1964, the group Chairman and CEO was Sir Lancelot Royle, KBE. He had joined the group in 1928. By 1955, the company was ranked 27th-largest in UK. By 1960, Home & Colonial Stores Ltd was still a major force in the UK food industry. With retail operations in the UK and abroad and factories in the UK, it was able to report a 10% rise in profits to ¬£4,033,057.The Times, The Home & Colonial Stores Ltd, 11 May 1960 By 1961, reflecting the end of the British Empire, the group had restyled itself under the name of the company it created in 1929, Allied Suppliers. Early in 1972, Allied was acquired by Cavenham Foods, formed six years previously by British tycoon James Goldsmith. Melia's Grocers and Tea Dealers, another popular grocery chain at the time, was forced to amalgamate with the Home and Colonial company due to competition from larger national supermarkets.Practical grocer: a manual and guide for the grocer, the provision merchant and allied trades, Volume 1, W. H. Simmonds The business purchased the South East-based supermarket chain Cater Brothers from Debenhams in 1979, and converted the stores into its Presto brand.

Along with his father and brother he organized the community in the 1850s. In 1886 it moved about a mile east from its original location to its current site after the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway was built through the area. Population The population of Copeville may have reached 300 in 1915. The population estimate had fallen to 240 in 1926. It remained at that number throughout the 1920s and 1930s due to the Great Depression, mechanization of farming, and job opportunities offered in the Dallas metropolitan area. In 1943 a further decline to 150 was reported. Until the early 1970s that estimate remained constant. The town had two churches, five businesses, and a school in 1947. Copeville had 106 residents and seven businesses in 1986 and 1990. In 2000 that number remained unchanged. Education The community of Copeville is served by the Community Independent School District.

Latrun takes its name from the monastery close to the junction of two major highways: Jerusalem to Jaffa/Tel Aviv and Gaza to Ramallah. During the British Mandate it became a Palestine Police base with a Tegart fort. The United Nations Resolution 181 placed this area within the proposed Arab state. In May 1948, it was under the control of the Arab Legion. It commanded the only road linking the Yishuv-controlled area of Jerusalem to Israel, giving Latrun strategic importance in the battle for Jerusalem. Despite assaulting Latrun on five separate occasions Israel was ultimately unable to capture Latrun, and it remained under Jordanian control until the Six-Day War. The battles were such a decisive Jordanian victory that the Israelis decided to construct a bypass surrounding Latrun so as to allow vehicular movement between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, thus avoiding the main road.Kenneth M. Pollack, Arabs at War: Military Effectiveness 1948‚Äì1991, University of Nebraska Press, 2003, p. 278. Regardless, during the Battle for Jerusalem, the Jewish population of Jerusalem could still be supplied by a new road, named the \\"Burma Road\\", that bypassed Latrun and was suitable for convoys. The Battle of Latrun left its imprint on the Israeli collective imagination and constitutes part of the \\"founding myth\\" of the Jewish State. The attacks cost the lives of 168 Israeli soldiers, but some accounts inflated this number to as many as 2,000. The combat at Latrun also carries a symbolic significance because of the participation of Holocaust survivors. Today, the battleground site has an Israeli military museum dedicated to the Israeli Armored Corps and a memorial to the 1947‚Äì1949 Palestine war. Background  1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War  Area under Israeli control on 15 May 1948 After the adoption of the United Nations Partition Plan for PalestineResolution 181 (II). Future government of Palestine A/RES/181(II)(A+B) 29 November 1947. in November 1947, a civil war erupted in the British Mandate of Palestine. The Jews living in Jerusalem constituted one of the weak points of the Yishuv and a main cause for concern to its leaders. With nearly 100,000 inhabitants, a sixth of the total Jewish population in the Mandate, the city was isolated in the heart of territory under Arab control.See War of the roads and blockade of Jerusalem and Operation Nachshon. In January, in the context of the \\"War of the Roads\\", the Holy War Army of Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni besieged the Jewish part of the city and stopped convoys passing between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. By the end of March, the tactic proved its worth and the city was cut off. The Haganah then launched Operation Nachshon, 4‚Äì20 April, and managed to force through a number of large convoys. Following the death of Abd al-Qader al-Husayni at al-Qastal, the Arab League's military committee ordered the other Arab force in Palestine, the Arab Liberation Army, to move its forces from Samaria (the northern part of today's West Bank) to the road of Jerusalem and the areas of Latrun, Ramla, and Lydda.Gelber (2006), p. 95. In the middle of May, the situation for the 50,000 Arab inhabitants of the city and the 30,000‚Äì40,000 in the outlying neighbourhoods was no better. After the massacre at Deir Yassin and the Jewish offensive of April that triggered the large-scale exodus of the Palestinian Arabs in other mixed cities, the Arab population of Jerusalem was frightened and feared for its fate.Yoav Gelber (2006), p. 109. With the departure of the British on 14 May, the Haganah launched several operations to take control of the city and the local Arab leadership requested King Abdullah of Jordan to deploy his army to come to their aid.Yoav Gelber (2006), p. 140. On 15 May, the situation in the newly declared State of Israel and the remnants of Palestine was chaotic with the British leaving. The Jewish forces gained advantage over the Arab forces, but they feared the intervention of the Arab armies that had been announced for that day.Yoav Gelber (2006), pp. 138‚Äì145. Latrun area (10 May 1948)  Geography  Latrun is located at the crossroads between the Tel Aviv‚ÄìRamla‚ÄìJerusalem and Ramallah‚ÄìIsdud roads in the area allocated to the Arab state by the United Nations Partition Plan. At that point, the Jerusalem road enters the foothills of Judea at Bab al-Wad (Sha'ar HaGai). The fort dominated the Valley of Ayalon, and the force that occupied it commanded the road to Jerusalem.See this picture of the valley taken from the hills of Latrun . In 1948, Latrun comprised a detention camp and a fortified police station occupied by the British,Benny Morris (2008), p. 132. a Trappist monastery, and several Arab villages: Latrun, Imwas, Dayr Ayyub and Bayt Nuba. During the civil war, after the death of Abd al-Qadir al- Husayni, the forces of the Arab Liberation Army positioned themselves around the police fort and the surrounding villages, to the indifference of the British. They regularly attacked supply convoys heading for Jerusalem. At that time, neither the Israeli nor Jordanian military staffs had prepared for the strategic importance of the place. Prelude  Operation Maccabi (8‚Äì16 May) Latrun area (around 15 May 1948) On 8 May, Haganah launched Operation Maccabi against the Arab Liberation Army and the Palestinian irregulars who occupied several villages along the Jerusalem road and prevented the resupplying of Jerusalem's Jewish community. The Givati Brigade (on the west side) and Harel Brigade (on the east side) were engaged in fighting, notably in the Latrun area.Efra√Øm Karsh (2002), pp. 60‚Äì62. Between 9‚Äì11 May, a battalion of the Harel brigade attacked and took the village of Bayt Mahsir, used by Palestinians as a base for the control of Bab al-Wad. The \\"Sha'ar HaGai\\" battalion of the Harel brigade also took up a position on the hills north and south of the road. It had to withstand the fire of the Arab Liberation Army artillery and the \\"unusual\\"It is Benny Morris who points out. fire of British armoured vehicles, but succeeded in holding the position and entrenched there.Story of the Battle of Bayt Mahsir on the website of the Palmach (retrieved on 9 August 2008). To the west, on 12 May, Givati brigade troops took the British detention camp on the road leading to Latrun, but abandoned it the next day.Ytzhak Levi (1986), detailed chronology of the battle of Jerusalem given at the end of the book. Between 14 and 15 May, its 52nd battalion took the villages of Abu Shusha, Al-Na'ani and al-Qubab north of Latrun, thus cutting off the zone from Ramla, the main Arab town in the area.Benny Morris (2008), p. 162. Lapierre and Collins report also that a platoon of the Givati brigade fired on and then penetrated the fort without encountering any resistance on the morning of 15 May. Again to the east, on 15 May, the troops of the Harel brigade took Dayr Ayyub, which they abandoned the next day. It is at this time that the Israeli officers in the field appreciated the strategic importance of Latrun. A report was sent from OC Harel brigade to OC Palmach that concluded that \\"The Latrun junction became the main point in the battle [of Jerusalem]\\" [exact words must be taken from the source], but \\"that appreciation was not shared by the staff one week previously\\".Benny Morris (2008), p. 463 nn196. Meanwhile, because of the Egyptian Army's advance, the Givati brigade got an order to redeploy on a more southern front, and the Harel brigade to remain in the Jerusalem sector. This decision to leave the area, and the fact of not planning for its strategic importance, would later be a source of controversy between Haganah chief of operations Yigael Yadin and Yitzhak Rabin, commander of the Harel brigade.  The Arab Legion takes control  Lt-Col Habes al-Majali, commander of the 4th regiment of the Arab Legion During the confusion of the last days of the British Mandate and with the \\"entry in war\\" of the Arab armies, the position at Latrun changed hands without combat. Firstly, around 14‚Äì15 May,Benny Morris (2002), p. 152. an order was given to Fawzi al-Qawuqji and his Arab Liberation Army to withdraw and to leave the place to the Arab Legion. According to Yoav Gelber, this departure occurred before the arrival of the Jordanian troops at Latrun and the position was held by just 200 irregulars.Lapierre et Collins (1971), p. 611. Benny Morris nevertheless points out that a platoon of legionnaires of the 11th Company along with irregulars was there and took over the fort.Benny Morris, (2008), pp. 207‚Äì208.Pierre Razoux, Tsahal, nouvelle histoire de l'arm√©e isra√©lienne, Perrin, 2006, p. 73. Indeed, as auxiliary forces of the British in Mandatory Palestine, several elements of the Arab Legion served in Palestine during the Mandate. The British had promised that these units would be withdrawn before the end of April, but for \\"technical reasons\\", several companies didn't leave the country. John Bagot Glubb, the commander of the Arab Legion, formed them into one division with two brigades, each made up of two infantry battalions, in addition to several independent infantry companies. Each battalion was given an armored-car company, and the artillery was made into a separate battalion with three batteries. Another \\"dummy\\" brigade was formed to make the Israelis believe it was a reserve brigade, thus deterring them from counterattacking into Transjordan.Pollack (2002), p. 270. On 15 May, the Arab states entered the war, and Syrian, Iraqi, Jordanian and Egyptian contingents deployed in Palestine. Among these, the Jordanian expeditionary corps was mainly constituted by an elite mechanized force \\"encadr√©e\\" by British officers and named Arab Legion. It comprised:Steven Thomas, cited by www.balagan.org.uk in a full description of forces in the area. * the 1st Brigade comprising the 1st and 3rd Battalions in areas that lead to Nablus;In the Jordanian expeditionary corps, each brigade is composed of 2 regiments each of them likely composed of 3 or 4 companies. This information is nevertheless \\"dubious\\" (sujette √† caution ?). The sources are contradictory at that level. The divergences are likely to be due to the fact that the \\"battalion\\", which is generally the unit that subdivides the brigade is named regiment in the Arab Legion. * the 3rd Brigade under the orders of Colonel Ashton comprising the 2nd Battalion under the orders of Major Geoffrey Lockett and the 4th battalion under the orders of Lieutenant Colonel Habes al-Majali that took position at Ramallah; * the 5th and 6th Battalions acting independently. Glubb first realized (\\"pris conscience\\") the strategical importance of Latrun in the Battle of Jerusalem. His objective was twofold: he wanted to prevent the Israelis from strengthening Jerusalem and from supplying the city, and he wanted to \\"make a diversion\\" to keep the strengths of the Haganah far from the city, warranting to the Arabs the control of East Jerusalem.Benny Morris (2002), p. 169. In addition to the 11th Company already there, he sent to Latrun the whole 4th Regiment.Benny Morris (2008), p. 219. During the night between 15 and 16 May, the first contingent of 40 legionnaires seconded by an undetermined number of Bedouins strengthened the position, and the remainder of the regiment reached the area on 17 May., Benny Morris, Histoire revisit√©e du conflit arabo-sioniste, Editions complexe, 2003, map p. 241 et pp. 247‚Äì255. On 18 May, the strength of the Arab Legion deployed around Latrun and Bab al-Wad was sufficient, and the road was blocked again. The Israeli general staff needed several days to assess the actual disposition of the Jordanian forces around Latrun and Jerusalem because these latter were thought to be at several locations in the country.  Situation in Jerusalem  Lt-Gen Yigael Yadin, IDF Chief of Operations during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War At Jerusalem, after the successful offensives that enabled the Jewish forces to take control of the buildings and strongholds that had been abandoned by the British,see Operation Kilshon. Glubb Pasha sent the 3rd Regiment of the Arab Legion to strengthen the Arab irregulars and fight the Jewish forces. After \\"violent\\" fighting, the Jewish positions in the Old City of Jerusalem were threatened (this felt indeed on 28 May). \\"We have surrounded the town\\": on 22 and 23 May, the second Egyptian brigade, composed mainly of several battalions of irregulars and several units of the regular army, reached the southern outskirts of Jerusalem and continued to attack at Ramat Rachel. Glubb nevertheless knew that the Israeli army would sooner or later be stronger than his and that he had to prevent the strengthening of the Harel and Etzioni brigades to secure East Jerusalem. He redeployed his strength on 23 May to reinforce the blockade.Benny Morris (2008), Description of the Operation Bin Nun, pp. 221‚Äì224. The Iraqi army, at that time seconded by tanks, relieved the Legion units in northern Samaria and these were redeployed towards the Jerusalem sector. The 2nd Regiment of the Legion moved to Latrun. A full Jordanian brigade was placed in the area. On the Israeli side, several leaders of the Jewish city sent emergency telegrams to David Ben-Gurion where they described the situation as desperate and that they could not hold out more than two weeks.Anita Shapira, L'imaginaire d'Isra√´l : histoire d'une culture politique (2005), Latroun : la m√©moire de la bataille, Chap. III. 1 l'√©v√©nement pp. 91‚Äì96. Fearing that without a supply the city would collapse, Ben-Gurion ordered the taking of Latrun. This decision seemed strategically necessary but was politically delicate, because Latrun was in the area allocated to the Arab State according to the terms of the Partition Plan and this attack was contrary to the non-aggression agreements, concluded with King AbdullahUntil the last days preceding the war, the Zionist authorities and the King Abdullah of Jordan maintained a dialogue. Some historians, such as Avi Shlaim, consider that this dialogue went up to a tacit non-aggression agreement but this thesis is controversial. This decision was also opposed by the Chief of Operations, Yigael Yadin who considered that there were other military priorities at that moment, in particular on the southern front, where the Egyptian army was threatening Tel Aviv if Yad Mordechai fell. But Ben- Gurion set Israeli military policy.Lapierre & Collins (1971), events related to the battle of Latrun, pp. 700‚Äì706; pp. 720‚Äì723; pp. 726‚Äì732; pp. 740‚Äì741. This difference in strategy influenced the outcome of the battle, and has been debated in Israel for many years.See section #Israeli historiography and collective memory. Jewish convoy making its way to Jerusalem below the Latrun Monastery. 1948. Battles  Operation Bin Nun Alef (24‚Äì25 May)  Operation Bin Nun (24‚Äì25 May 1948) The task to lead Operation Bin Nun (lit. Nun's son, in reference to Joshua, Nun's son, conqueror of Canaan according to the Book of Joshua) was given to Shlomo Shamir, a former officer of the British army. His force consisted of 450 men of the Alexandroni Brigade and 1,650 men of the 7th Brigade. Of these, about 140 to 145 were immigrants who had just arrived in Israel,Collins and Lapierre talk about 450 new immigrants recently debarked (Lapierre & Collins (1971), p. 712). Ami Isseroff (2003) on the website www.mideastweb talks about 145 and Anita Shapira (2005) pp. 94‚Äì95 talks about 65 to 70 immigrants for company B. nearly 7% of the total. Their heavy weaponry was limited to two French mortars of 1906 (nicknamed Napoleonchik), one mortar with 15 rounds of ammunition, one Davidka, ten mortars and twelve armored vehicles. Three hundred soldiers of the Harel Brigade were also in the area but were not aware of the operation, but assisted after finding out about it by intercepting a radio transmission.Ami Isseroff, site www.mideastweb referring to Yitzhak Levi (1986), Nine measures, p. 266. The Jordanian forces were under the order of Lieutenant Colonel Habes al-Majali. He \\"disposed\\" of the 4th Regiment and 600 Jordanian volunteers seconded by 600 local volunteers. The 2nd Regiment of the brigade, commanded by Major Geoffrey Lockett, had just left Jerusalem and arrived at Latrun during the battle. The brigade totalled 2,300 men seconded by 800 auxiliaries. It had at its disposal 35 armoured vehicles with 17 Marmon-Herrington Armoured Cars each armed with an anti-tank 2 pounder gun. For artillery it had eight 25 pounder Howitzers/Field guns, eight 6 pounder anti-tank guns, ten 2 pounder anti-tank guns also sixteen 3-inch mortars. Zero Hour (that is, the start of the attack) was first fixed for midnight 23 May. But it was delayed 24 hours because it had not been possible to gather troops and weapons in time. Because no reconnaissance patrol was made the Israelis didn't know the exact composition of enemy forces. Intelligence reports just talked about \\"local irregular forces\\". On 24 May at 19:30, Shlomo Shamir was warned that an enemy force of around 120 vehicles, comprising armoured vehicles and artillery, was probably moving towards Latrun, urged an attack. The attack was postponed by 2 hours and fixed at 22:00. The attack was planned on two axes: * The battalion of the Alexandroni brigade had to take the town of Latrun, the police fort and then Imwas in order to block any new Arab reinforcement, and also to protect the passage of supply convoys; * The 72nd Battalion would circle the position by the south to join the Jerusalem road at the level of Bab al-Wad; it would then cross the road and climb the ridges to take Dayr Ayyub, Yalu and Bayt Nuba, and would ambush there to cover the passage of convoys. It would be supported by three armored cars and two half-tracks of the 73rd Battalion. During the night, something unexpected happened: a roadblock on the road that had to be used by the brigade had to be dismantled. Zero hour was once more modified and set at midnight. At last, the troops fought battle between 2 am and 5 am but with no benefit of cover. The attackers were rapidly discovered, depriving the Israelis of the surprise effect. The battle started at 4am. The Israeli forces were submitted to a strong fire. The artillery tried to intervene but felt rapidly out of ammunition or was not within range to provide a counter-battery fire.Counter-battery fire is a military tactic that consists in targeting, with one's own artillery, the one of the adversary. In front of the total failure of the attack, Shlomo Shamir ordered the retreat at 11.30 am. But this occurred on open ground under a heavy sun and the soldiers had no water. Numerous men were killed or injured by Arab fire. It was only at 2 pm that the first injured men reached the transport they had left in the morning. However, the Arab Legion didn't take advantage of this victory while, according to Benny Morris, it could easily have performed a counter-attack up to the Israeli headquarters located at Hulda. Jordanians and Arab irregulars had 5 deaths and 6 injured. The Israelis counted 72 deaths (52 from the 32nd Battalion and 20 from the 72nd Battalion), 6 prisoners and 140 injured. Ariel Sharon, the future Prime Minister of Israel, a lieutenant at the time, headed a platoon of the 32nd BattalionBenny Morris (2008) p. 222. and suffered serious injury to his stomach during the battle.  Reorganisation of the central front  At the end of May, David Ben-Gurion was convinced that the Arab Legion expected to take control of all Jerusalem. Moreover, after the fighting, the situation there deteriorated: the Jewish community had very small reserves of fuel, bread, sugar and tea, which would last for only 10 days, and water for 3 months.David Tal (2003) pp. 225‚Äì231. In Glubb's opinion, the aim was still to prevent the Israelis from reinforcing the city and taking control of its Arab part.Benny Morris (2002) p. 169. On 29 May, the UN Security Council announced its intention to impose a ceasefire for 4 weeks, which would prevent further capture of territory and thus prevent resupplying the besieged city.Benny Morris (2008), Description of the Operation Bin Nun Bet pp. 224‚Äì229. From a military point of view, the 10th Harel Brigade required reinforcements and Ben-Gurion dispatched a battalion of the 6th Etzioni Brigade. He considered it imperative that the 7th Brigade join the forces in Jerusalem as well as a contingent of 400 new recruits to reinforce the Harel Brigade. Weapons and spare parts that had arrived in Israel by air were also now ready for combat on the Jerusalem front. The commander of the 7th Brigade wished to neutralize the negative effects of the debacle on the morale of the troops and on his prestige. The central front was reorganized and its command given to an American volunteer fighting on the Israeli side, Colonel David Marcus, who was subsequently appointed Aluf (Major General). He took command of the Etzioni and 7th Brigades, and the 10th Palmach Harel Brigade.  Operation Bin Nun Bet  Operation Bin Nun Bet (30‚Äì31 May 1948) Shlomor Shamir was once again given the command of the operation. He sent the 7th Brigade and the 52nd Battalion of the Givati Brigade that replaced the 32nd that had been decimated in the previous battle. The 73rd Battalion was an armored force of light infantry with flame-throwers and 22 \\"military cars\\" made locally.Lapierre & Collins (1971), Events relative to the second battle of Latrun, pp. 774‚Äì787. The Israelis sent numerous reconnaissance patrols but they nevertheless had no clear idea of the adversary's forces. They expected to fight 600 men of the Legion and of the Arab Liberation Army, so a force was allocated that was not enough to hold the Latrun front. Jordanians still had in fact a full brigade and are supported by several hundreds of irregulars. Taking into account the mistakes of the previous attacks, the renewed assault was organised with precision, and the area from where the units had to launch their attack had been cleared on 28 May. In particular the two hamlets of Bayt Jiz and Bayt Susin, where a counter-attacks had been launched by the Arab militants during the first battle, and Hill 369. The attack was once more foreseen on two axes: * The 72nd and 52nd Infantry Battalions were to counter- attack on foot from the south up to Bayt Susin and then take Bab al-Wad and attack respectively Dayr Ayyub and Yalu, then head for Latrun and attack this from the east; * The 71st Infantry Battalion and 73rd Mechanised Battalion were to assault the police fort, the monastery and the town of Latrun by south-west. US Col. Mickey Marcus in 1948, the first modern Israeli general (Aluf) Around midnight, the men of the 72nd and the 52nd passed Bab al-Wad noiselessly and then separated towards their respective targets. One company took Deir Ayyub, which was empty, but then were discovered as they did so by enemies on a nearby hill. They suffered the joint fire of the Legion's artillery and machines guns. Thirteen men were killed and several other injured. The company, composed mainly of immigrants, then retreated to Bab al- Wad. The 52nd Battalion was preparing to take the hill in front of Yalu, but received an order to retreat. On the other front, the forces divided in two parts. The infantry of the 71st rapidly took the monastery and then fought for the control of the town. On the other side, the Israeli artillery succeeded in neutralizing the fort's weapons. The volunteers crossed the defence fence and their flame-throwers took the defenders by surprise. Nevertheless, the light coming from the fire they created lost their cover and they became easy targets for the mortars of the Jordanians. They were quickly knocked out and destroyed. The sappers succeeded nevertheless to make the door explode, but in the confusion were not followed by the infantrymen. Chaim Laskov, the chief of operations on that front, ordered company D of the 71st Battalion (that had been kept in reserve) to intervene, but one of the soldiers accidentally exploded a landmine, killing three men and injuring several others. They were then attacked by heavy fire from the Jordanian artillery and the men retreated towards the west in panic. The battle was still not lost for the Israelis although the wake was coming, and Laskov considered that his men could not hold in front of a Legion's counter-attack and he preferred to order the retreat. It was also time for the Jordanians to regroup, their 4th Regiment was completely out of ammunition. 73rd Battalion suffered 50% losses and the whole of the engaged forces had counted 44 deaths and twice that number injured. According to the sources, the Legion suffered between 12David Tal (2003), p. 229. and 20Ytzhak Levi (1986) p. 461. deaths, including the lieutenant commanding the fort. In contrast, the Jordanians reported 2 just deaths on their side, and 161 of the Israelis.Ytzhak Levi (1986), p. 283. David Marcus later attributed the responsibility for the defeat to the infantry, stating: \\"the artillery cover was correct. The armoury were good. The infantry, very bad\\". Benny Morris considers that the mistake was rather to disperse the forces on several objectives instead of concentrating the full brigade on the main objective: the fort.  \\"Burma Road\\"  Burma road under the control of the 7th Brigade On 28 May, after they took Bayt Susin, the Israelis controlled a narrow corridor between the coastal plain and Jerusalem. But this corridor was not crossed by a road that could have let trucks supply the city. A foot patrol of the Palmach discovered some paths that linked several villages in the hills south of the main road controlled by the Arab Legion. In the night of 29‚Äì30 May, Jeeps sent into the hills confirmed there was a path suitable for vehicles.Benny Morris, 1948 (2008), Information relating to the Burma road pp. 230‚Äì231. The decision was then taken to build a road in the zone. This was given the name of \\"Burma Road\\", referring to the supply road between Burma and China built by the British during World War II. Engineers immediately started to build the road while convoys of jeeps, mules and camels were organised from Hulda to carry mortars to Jerusalem. Without knowing the goals of these works, the Jordanians realised a game was afoot in the hills. They performed artillery bombings, that would anyway have been rapidly stopped under the orders of the top British officer, and they sent patrols to stop the works, but without success. Nevertheless, it was mainly food that the inhabitants of Jerusalem needed. Starting 5 June, the Israeli engineers started to fix the road so that it let civil transport trucks pass to supply the city. 150 workers, working in four teams, installed a pipeline to supply the city with water, because the other pipeline, crossing Latrun, had been cut by the Jordanians.Dominique Lapierre et Larry Collins, O J√©rusalem (1971) pp. 827‚Äì828. In O Jerusalem, Dominique Lapierre and Larry Collins talked about heroic action, when during the night of 6‚Äì7 June, in fear of the critical situation of Jerusalem and to improve the morale of the population, 300 inhabitants of Tel Aviv were conscripted to carry on their backs, for the few kilometers not yet ready for the trucks, what would be needed to feed the inhabitants of Jerusalem one more day.Dominique Lapierre et Larry Collins, O J√©rusalem (1971) pp. 806‚Äì809.They report one Israeli fatality a Civilian who died of a heart attack The first phase of these works was achieved for the 10 June truce and on 19 June a convoy of 140 trucks, each carrying three tons of merchandise as well as numerous weapons and ammunition, reached Jerusalem. The siege of the city was then definitively over. This Israeli success was punctuated by an incident that became marked in memory: the death of Aluf Mickey Marcus, accidentally killed by an Israeli sentry during the night of 10‚Äì11 June.Pierre Razoux, Tsahal, nouvelle histoire de l‚Äôarm√©e isra√©lienne, Perrin, 2006 p. 78.Zeev Schiff, A History of the Israeli Army, 1985 p. 37.

Between 30 May and 8 June the status between the Israeli and Arabic armies became a stand-off.

It was in this context that David Ben-Gurion took the decision to withdraw from Galilee the elite 11th Yiftach Brigade under the orders of Yigal Allon to launch a third assault against Latrun. He had at his disposal an artillery support composed of four mortars and four guns that were part of the heavy weapons recently delivered to Israel by Operation Balak. Operation Yoram. Bombardment of Latrun in fighting before the first truce. 1948 This time, the general staff decided on an attack concentrated on the centre of the Legion disposal, with several diversion attacks to the north to disrupt the Jordanians. While a battalion from the Yiftach Brigade was performed some diversions attacks on Salbit, Imwas and Bayt Nuba, a battalion from the Harel brigade was to take Hill 346, between the fourth and second Legion regiments and a battalion from the Yiftach Brigade was then to pass through it, take Hill 315 and Latrun village and the police fort by the East.Benny Morris, 1948 (2008), Information relative to Operation Yoram pp. 229‚Äì230. The Israeli operation started with an artillery barrage on the fort, the village of Latrun and the positions around. Hills 315 and 346 occupied with a company from the Legion, were not targeted not to alert the Jordanians. The men of the Harel brigade made leave on foot from Bab al-Oued but took a wrong way and mistakenly attacked Hill 315. Located by the Jordanian sentries, they launch the attack of the hill. The Legionnaires were outnumbered but counterattacked with violence, going as far as requiring an artillery bombing on their own position. The Israelis suffered some heavy losses. When the Yiftach arrived at the bottom of Hill 346, they are targeted by firearms, grenades and artillery. Thinking that Harel men were there, they called by radio to the headquarters to ceasefire, and laid down arms. They refused, not believing that account of the events and Harel soldiers stayed in place. Confusion among Jordanians was as important as among Israelis with the attack on Hill 315 and those of diversion. With the incoming morning and unable to evaluate properly the situation, the Israeli HQ gave orders at 5.30 am for the soldiers to retreat to Bad al-Oued. The losses were also significant. Indeed, the 400-strong Harel battalion numbered 16 dead and 79 injured, and the Yiftach an handful of dead and injured. The Legion numbered several dozen victims. The following day, Jordan mounted two counter-attacks. The first was over Beit Susin. The Legionnaires took several Israeli guard posts but could not keep them more than a few hours. The fighting took lives and some 20 injuries on the Israeli side.Ytzhak Levi, Nine Measures: The Battles for Jerusalem in the War of Independence (1986) p. 283.Description of the events on the official website of Palmah (retrieved on 10 August 2008). The second was at Kibbutz Gezer from where the diversion attacks had been launched. A force the strength of a battalion, made up of Legionnaires and irregulars and supported by a dozen armoured vehicles, attacked the kibbutz in the morning. It was defended by 68 soldiers of the Haganah (including 13 women). After the four-hour battle, the kibbutz fell. A dozen of the defenders escaped. Most others surrendered and one or two were executed. The Legionnaires protected the prisoners from irregulars and the next day freed the women. The toll was 39 dead on the Israeli side and 2 on the Legionnaires' side. The kibbutz was looted by the irregulars and the Legionnaires evacuated the area after the fights. In the evening the Yiftach Brigade retook the kibbutz.  Attacks organised during Operation Danny  After the month of truce, during which Tsahal increased forces and re-equipped, the weakest point of the Israeli dispositions were on the central front and the corridor to Jerusalem. The High Command decided to launch \\"Operation Larlar\\" with the objective of taking Lydda, Ramle, Latrun and Ramallah and relieving the threat on Tel Aviv on a side and West Jerusalem on the other.Benny Morris, 1948 (2008) p. 286. To achieve this objective Yigal Allon in entrusted 5 brigades: the Harel and Yiftach (now totalling five battalions), the 8th armoury brigade (newly constituted as the 82nd and 89th battalions), several infantry battalions from the Kiryati and Alexandroni brigades, and 30 pieces of artillery. The 7th brigade was sent to the northern front. In a first phase, between 9 and 13 July, the Israelis took Lydda and Ramle and reasserted the area around Latrun by taking Salbit, but the forces are exhausted and the High Command renounced to the objective of taking Ramallah. Two attacks were launched against Latrun.  On the east of the Jordanian positions (16 July)  On the night of 15‚Äì16 July, several companies of the Harel brigade laid on an assault against Latrun by the east, around the \\"artillery ridge\\" and the villages of Yalo and Bayt Nuba. They carried on to the hills by way of the villages of Bayt Thul and Nitaf transporting their armoury using pack mules. After several hours of fighting and counter-attacks by armoured vehicles of the Arab Legion, they were finally pushed back but could keep control of several hills.Benny Morris, 1948 (2008) p. 293.Description of the assault against Beit Nuba on the website of the Palmach (retrieved on 2 May 2008).Description of the assault against the \\"artillery ridge\\" on the website of the Palmach (retrieved on 2 May 2008). In total, the Israelis lost 23 dead and numerous injured.Ytzhak Levi, Nine Measures: The Battles for Jerusalem in the War of Independence (1986) pp. 466‚Äì7.  Frontal assault against the police fort (18 July)  One hour before the truce, the High Command decided to try a frontal assault against the police fort. Intelligence indicated that, in effect, it was \\"more likely than not\\" that the Legion's forces in the sector were \\"substantial\\".Description of the assault against the police fort , on the website of the Palmach (retrieved on 2 May 2008). In the morning, reconnaissance patrols had sized up the sector, but could not confirm or deny the information that had been gathered by the intelligence. At 6 pm two Cromwell tanks driven by British deserters, seconded by a mechanised battalion of the Yiftach and supported by artillery launched the attack of the police fort. When the Israeli forces arrived from the fort, they were shelled by Jordanian artillery. Around 6:15 pm. one of the tanks was hit by a shell (or sustained a mechanical damage) and had to retreat to al-Qubab for repairs. The remaining forces waited for its return and the attack resumed around 7:30 pm, but was abandoned around 8 pm. The Israelis counted between 8 and 12Arieh Itzchaki (1982), Latrun. The battle for the road to Jerusalem. victims. At the same time, elements of the Harel brigade took about 10 villages to the south of Latrun to enlarge and secure the area of the Burma road. The majority of inhabitants had fled the fights in April but those who remained were systematically expelled.Benny Morris, The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited, Cambridge University Press, 2004 p. 436.  The final assault  After the ten-day campaign, the Israelis were military superior to their enemies and the Cabinet subsequently considered where and when to attack next. Three options were offered: attacking the Arabic enclave in Galilee held by the Arab Liberation Army; moving eastward as far as possible in Samarian and Judean areas, taken by the Iraqis and Jordanians; or attacking southern Negev taken by the Egyptians.Benny Morris (2008), pp. 315-316. On 24 September, an incursion made by the Palestinian irregulars in the Latrun sector (killing 23 Israeli soldiers) precipitated the debate. On 26 September, David Ben-Gurion put his argument to the Cabinet to attack Latrun again and conquer the whole or a large part of West Bank.Benny Morris (2008), pp. 317. The motion was rejected by 5 votes to 7 after discussions.Benny Morris (2008), p. 318. According to Benny Morris, the arguments that were advanced not to launch the attack were: the negative international repercussions for Israel already accentuated by the recent assassination of Count Bernadotte; the consequences of an attack on an agreement with Abdallah; the fact that defeating the Arab Legion could provoke a British military intervention because of Britain and Jordan's common defense pact and lastly because conquering this area would add hundreds of thousands of Arab citizens to Israel.Benny Morris (2008), pp. 317-318. Ben-Gurion judged the decision (\\"A cause for lamentation for generations\\") in considering that Israel could never renounce its claim in Judea, Samaria and over Old Jerusalem.Benny Morris (2008), p. 319.  Aftermath  Latrun area (19 July 1948). At the operational level, the five assaults on Latrun were solved with Israeli defeats and Jordanian victories: the Jordanians repelled all assaults and kept control of the road between the coastal plain and Jerusalem, with Israel losing 168 killed and many more injured.Taking into account the references given in the article, the sum of the Israeli losses for the five assaults gives numbers between 164 and 171 Israeli victims, without taking into account the 39 victims for the attack against Gezer, the 8 of the Jordanian counter attack against Bayt Susin and the 45 of Qirbet Quriqur. Strategically, the outcome was more nuanced: *The opening of the Burma Road enabled the Israelis to bypass Latrun and supply the 100,000 Jewish inhabitants of West Jerusalem with food, arms, munitions, and equipment and reinforce their military position there; *If the control of West Jerusalem by Israel hold some of the Arab forces, the Arab Legion control of Latrun, from Tel Aviv, was a thorn in the side of Israeli forces;Benny Morris, The road to Jerusalem (2002) p. 169. *Latrun was a pivot point of the Legion's deployment; Glubb Pacha massed a third of his troops there; its defeat would have caused the fall of Jerusalem and probably of Cisjordan as a whole.Benny Morris, The road to Jerusalem (2002) p. 241. At the discussions of the Israeli-Jordano Armistice at Rhodes, the Israelis requested unsuccessfully the removal of the legion from Latrun.Yoav Gelber, Palestine 1948 (2006) p. 250. It subsequently remained under Jordanian control until the Six-Day War.  Historiography   Israeli historiography and collective memory  According to Israeli historian Anita Shapira, there is a gap, at times quite wide, between the 'facts established by historical research' and the image of the battle as retained in collective memory. This is certainly the case for the battle of Latrun, which has become, in Israel, a founding myth.Anita Shapira, L'imaginaire d'Isra√´l : histoire d'une culture politique (2005) p. 91. = The clear-sightedness of the Commander-in-Chief = David Ben-Gurion, Tel Aviv's airfield. The first version of the battle of Latrun was contrived by David Ben-Gurion and his entourage. Initially, the governing power within Israel remained silent. However, on May 27, the Israeli daily Maariv printed a sceptical coverage of Arab accounts, which spoke of a great victory by the Arab Legion, involving some 800 Israeli dead. In response, the Israeli press stressed that the aim of the operation was not to take Latrun, but to strike the Legion and, on June 1, it published casualty figures of 250 deaths for the Arab side and 10 deaths, with 20 badly wounded, and another 20 lightly wounded on the Israeli side.Anita Shapira, L'imaginaire d'Isra√´l : histoire d'une culture politique (2005), pp. 97‚Äì102. From 14 June, the press shifted its focus to the 'opening of the Burma route' and, in the context of a conflict between the military's senior command and Ben-Gurion, Yigael Yadin called the operation a 'great catastrophe' while the latter replied that, in his view, it had been \\"a great, although costly, victory\\". The \\"official version\\" entered in the historiography in 1955 following the work of lieutenant colonel Israel Beer, whereas adviser and support of Yadin at the time of the events, who published 'The battles of Latrun'. This study, considered by the historian Anita Shapira as \\"the most clever ever written on the topic\\", puts the battles in their military and political context. It concludes that given the strategic and symbolic importance of Jerusalem, \\"the three tactical defeats that occurred at Latrun (...) permitted the supply [of the city] and were a diversal manoeuvre (...) [and] are the consequence of the strategic clear- sightedness of the Commander-in-Chief, able to identify the key points and subordinate to his general sight the tactical considerations, limited, of the military command. Ber put the responsibility of the tactical defeats on the failures of the intelligence services and on the \\"absence de commandement s√©par√© sur les diff√©rents fronts.\\" He also points out the badly trained immigrants, the defective equipment, and the difficulty for a new army to succeed a first operation targeting to capture a defended area that was organised by advance. He gives the first estimates for the losses: 50 deaths in the 32nd battalion of the Alexandroni brigade and the 25 deaths in the 72nd battalion of the 7th brigade (composed mainly of immigrants). Finally, Ber founded the myth and pictured the events of Latrun as \\"an heroic saga, as the ones that occurs at the birth of a nation or at the historical breakthrough of movements of national liberation\\". = Criminal negligence = 3rd Alexandroni Brigade memorial 7th Brigade memorial [About the First Battle of Latrun:] \\"the Jordanians broke the attack by noon, with fewer than two thousand Israeli deaths.\\"Kenneth M. Pollack, Arabs at War: Military Effectiveness 1948‚Äì1991, University of Nebraska Press, 2003, p. 277. Whereas many events in the war were more bloody for the Israelis, like the massacre at Kfar Etzion with 150 deaths or the one of the Mount Scopus with 78, the Battle of Latrun is the event of the war to provoke most rumours, narratives and controversies in Israel.Anita Shapira, L'imaginaire d'Isra√´l : histoire d'une culture politique (2005) pp. 103‚Äì112. The main reason is that Latrun had still been the mainstay for the road to Jerusalem until the Six-Day War, keeping the Israelis at the margins and having to go round and maintain the town, but struggling to bypass it, which played each day on their minds. According to Anita Shapira, the primary reason was nothing but people's grievous memories, of David Ben-Gurion and the veterans of the British Armies on one side and former Palmah and Haganah soldiers on the other. In this sphere of influence during the 1970s and in the controversies that continued until the 1980s, the \\"Strategic Necessity\\" was said, if it were not done, it would be \\"Criminal negligence\\", with a heavy toll on bring in immigrants to the battle, and forging a new founding myth. On one side, the opponents of Ben-Gurion attacked his \\"moral authority\\". They said that the intrusion into Latrun by the \\"scum of the earth\\" immigrants who died had changed the situation for the worse. And the number of victims, and the proportion of immigrants, inflated in the narratives: from \\"several hundreds of dead\\" to \\"500 to 700 dead and even \\"1,000 to 2,000 dead\\". The proportion of immigrants making up this total of victims was up to 75%. His opponents accused Ben-Gurion of wanting to take out the myth of the \\"invincible Arab Legion\\" and to justify the abandonment of the city of David to Abdallah. (Anita Shapira considers this story to be at the origin of the theory of Avi Shlaim who brought forth what she considers as the myth of the collusion between Ben-Gurion and Abdallah.See also: Avi Shlaim, \\"Collusion Across the Jordan\\".) On the other side, those supporting Ben-Gurion put everything to advance the case of the \\"historic sacrifice\\" by the immigrants, laying the failure to their poor training. Many contemporary books about the 1948 War were published at this time: John and David Kimche, The two sides of the hill (1960) (the more reliable); Dominique Lapierre and Larry Collins, O Jerusalem (1972) (the best known internationally) and Dan Kurzman, Genesis, 1948 (1970) (the only one that got reviews in the Israeli press). With this political writing, historical research on Latrun tends to concentrate on the 1980s with the work of Ari√© Itzhaki, \\"Latrun\\" (in 2 volumes). It gives the exact number of victims, but contrary to Israel Beer (meanwhile caught as spying for USSR),Anita Shapira, L'imaginaire d'Isra√´l : histoire d'une culture politique (2005) p. 108. it depicts the battle as \\"The hardest in the history of Tsahal\\", and it puts the responsibility of the defeat on Ben-Gurion, who panicked about Jerusalem, and tactical errors on the brigade commanders and not on the immigrants who received (from his point of viewAnita Shapira, L'imaginaire d'Isra√´l : histoire d'une culture politique (2005), underlines that Itzhaki thought wrongly that the immigrants had got training before in Cyprus.) a sufficient training. = The drama of alienation = Yisrael Meir Lau (aged 8) in the arms of Elazar Schiff, survivors of Buchenwald concentration camp on their arrival at Haifa, 15 July 1945 In the first years after its foundation, Israel met a problem with social integration of new immigrants who had arrived after the war, who had received much trauma from their exodus from Arab lands or from the death camps, and had suffered six years of war.See Tom Segev (1998), 1949. The First Israelis. Their integration was difficult with Sabra Israelis, born in the Palestinian Mandate, and taking the essential jobs and around who Israel had built an image of \\"Sabras, strong and courageous, fearless heroes, disdaining feebleness and trouble\\". The phenomenon rose up again with the Israeli victory of the Six-Day War.Anita Shapira, L'imaginaire d'Isra√´l : histoire d'une culture politique (2005) pp. 113‚Äì121. All the while, these uncertainties and the reparations from the Yom Kippur War polished the sheen on the Shoah. The collective memory resurfaced and looked to reconcile its history of difficulties, suffering and sacrifices. A new elite arose from the Sephardic Jews and the \\"can-do\\" of Menahem Begin. In this context, the \\"myth\\" of Latrun derived from the frustrations and the death of the new immigrants and was catalysed by their integration in a society where \\"the survivor of Shoah carried the new collective memory, immigrant refugees who had troubled pasts, and then were confronted with hostility and threat and still took their place with their blood and taking part in the war\\". This myth was founded in the factual knowledge of the immigrants' participation in the battles, and the mythical knowledge because of the differences in the number of victims, the leaving of the injured on the fields of battle, and that the Latrun battle was the hardest and most important in the war. The influence on written history appeared primarily in books and commentary, where \\"the immigrants wanted only to make sure that their contribution at the battle was written in the collective memory with a plus sign\\". It didn't bring new documents but it expressed itself in memoirs, reminiscences and obituaries by or of those involved in the events. It was a view that was seldom heard in polemics giving two preceding versions of events but that had a life of its own, given to it by the immigrants. = Myth of guilt = Survivors of the W√∂bbelin concentration camp (1945) In the 1980s, a schism arose within the post-Zionism movement, and the history of the battle of Latrun came to represent the culpability of the Israeli state and a way of pointing out that it was born in the context of massacres and the exodus of the Palestinian population. It shouted \\"hypocrisy\\", \\"false truths\\", and \\"the blood of the escapees of Shoah who came to find a new life and yet found death\\".Anita Shapira, L'imaginaire d'Isra√´l : histoire d'une culture politique (2005) pp. 122‚Äì131. This version was put into several poems by the celebrated provocative poet Gabi Daniel (pseudonym of Benjamin Harushovsky-Harshav) and entitled \\"Peter the Great\\". Themes in the poem include dehumanisation and how Ben-Gurion got Shoah into his pocket, by the work of the other \\"innocent young Jews of the Superior Race, who, without name or vision, found themselves the saviours of Israel\\". :Peter the Great :Paved the city of St Petersburg :In the northern seas :On the backs of his serfs. :David Ben-Gurion :Paved :The Burma Road, which turned around :The road, by the road to the capital Jerusalem, :With the backs of the young refugees from Shoah. Anita Shapira considers this \\"New myth\\" was necessary not to reject identity with the past and to be able to renounce their common memory. While Israel in the 1980s was under much criticism from myths about the state's founding, the reception of this idea was mitigated and \\"this version of Latrun that was destined to blow up the myth that the regathering was solely in the hands of a group of radicals in the middle of the [Israeli] intellectual community\\". = Qirbet Quriqur = A battle fought in this zone and tragic for the Israelis was completely eclipsed from their collective memory. On 18 July, a company from the 1st Battalion of Yiftach Brigade received the order to capture Qirbet Quriqur, an outpost protecting the only way for the Legion to get to Latrun located several kilometres to the north of the place. Intelligence services had not informed the responsible officer that nearby there was another outpost, occupied by a reinforced company of the Legion. From there the legionnaires could observe all the operations of the Israelis and called for reinforcements, notably armoured vehicles. When they mounted the counter-attack, the Israelis were taken by a lightning strike in an encircling movement. No troops were available there to reinforce them, so they had to retreat in plain daylight. 45 Israeli soldiers, nineteen of them aged 18 or less, lost their lives.Anita Shapira (2007) p. 234. Despite this bloodbath, Anita Shapira underlines that this battle didn't remain in the Israeli collective memory. \\"If success has numerous fathers, [...] defeat remains an orphan. [...] The deaths of Qurikur did not enter into the pantheon of the Israeli national memory. [...] [While there were numerous polemics about Latrun], that 45 soldiers perished [...] should have begged a question. But they died in a side of the arena that proved to be unimportant, given it was not to decide the outcome of the campaign. = Commemoration = After the Suez Crisis and the Six-Day War, the army came to arm the most important place. For technical reasons (distance of communication with bases) and because new places of historical interest were accessible, the top brass debated whether to transfer the postings of new recruits at Masada to a more appropriate place. It was Latrun that was finally chosen. In the 1980s, a commemorative site and a museum was built on the old police site. The complex has a wall listing all the names of the fallen soldiers since the 1947‚Äì1949 Palestine war, and a monument to the glory of the heroes and another for reverence. The museum has nearly 200 tanks and other armoured vehicles of many kinds.  Jordanian historiography  According to Eug√®ne Rogan, the Jordanian history of the war is essentially that of the recollections by Jordanian officers who took part in the fighting, or of nationalist historians. He states that these \\"non-critical\\" works are largely loyal to the Jordanian regime and quotes My memoirs by Habes al-Majali, commander of the 4th Regiment; The battles of Bad al-Oued by Mahmoud al- Ghussan, one of the High Command officers; On the road to Jerusalem by Ma'n Abu Nuwar, an officer of the Arab Legion, Jordanian soldier and Soldier with the Arabs with John Bagot Glubb.Eug√®ne Rogan (2001) p. 96. Jordanian historiography declares Latrun as a great success of the Arab Legion in the defense of Jerusalem, where a contingent of 1,200 men resisted an assault of 6,500 Israeli soldiers,The Arab Legion and the Defense of Jerusalem , on the website of the Jordanian Embassy to the United States. and claiming Israeli casualties of between 400 and 800 killed.Benny Morris, 1948 (2008) p. 439 referring to Mahmoud al-Ghussan. Glubb claimed 600 deaths on the first assault and 600 others for the two after.Benny Morris, The road to Jerusalem (2002), p. 169, referring to John Bagot Glubb, A soldier among the Arabs p. 132. Habes al-Majali is quoted as the only Arab commander to have defeated the Israelis in 1948 and who restored a little honour to the Arabs.Biography of Habes al- Majali at the website www.salaam.co.uk. By his version of events, he would even have caught Ariel Sharon in the course of the battle and it is Colonel Ashton (his British superior from 3rd Brigade) would have forbidden him to use the artillery against the Burma road, action by which he could have prevented its construction. After the war, he was appointed bodyguard of Abdallah and in 1957 Chief-of-Staff of the Jordanian Army. He became Jordanian Minister of Defence in 1967.Entry of Habes al-Majali on the Encyclop√©die Britannica.  Palestinian historiography and collective memory  Palestinian refugees during the 1948 exodus The Palestinian account of the battle is much the same as the Israeli one. It is, after, all, based on the Israeli one but gives no weight or symbolic character to it. In his work \\"All That Remains: The Palestinian Villages Occupied and Depopulated by Israel in 1948\\" Walid Khalidi refers to Operation Maccabi as the first assault.Khalidi, Walid (1992), p. 276. He reports that the resistance offered by the Arab Legion and the volunteer army were \\"inspired by Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni\\" (who had been killed a month before).Narrative of the battle of Latrun on the website www.jerusalemites.org based on Walid Khalidi (1992). Nevertheless, Palestinian historiography and collective memory point out that during the exodus of Palestinian Arab population of the 1948 War the massacres and forced expulsions that happened could be seen as ethnic cleansing.See, for example, Nur Masalha, Expulsion of the Palestinians, Institute for Palestine Studies, 1992 and Ilan Papp√©, The ethnic cleansing of Palestine, Oneworld Publications Limited, 2007. In the Latrun zone, this affected about 20 villages and ten thousand Palestinian Arabs. Some inhabitants fled during the fights of April but most fled when the Israelis attacked their village during the following operations. After capturing a village, the Israeli soldiers systematically expelled the non-combatants, intimidating them to leave and demolishing houses. A massacre of between thirty and seventy ArabsBenny Morris, The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited, Cambridge University Press, 2004 p. 257. took place some days after Abu Shusha was taken. Most villages were levelled, so as not to be used by the Arab volunteers and to prevent the inhabitants returning. In some cases Jewish settlements were established on village land.Khalidi, Walid (1992).Ayr Ayyub (371 inhabitants), Saydoun (244 inhabitants), Deir Mouheizin (232 inhabitants), Saris (650 inhabitants), Beit Far (348 inhabitants), Abou Shousha (1000 inhabitants), al-Na'ani (1705 inhabitants), et Abou Qoubab (2297 inhabitants), Beit Mahsir (2784 inhabitants), Beit Jiz (115 inhabitants), Beit Sousin (244 inhabitants), Latrun (220 inhabitants), Khirbet Ism Allah (23 inhabitants), Deir Rafat (499 inhabitants), Sar'a (394 inhabitants), Islin (302 inhabitants), Ishwa (709 inhabitants), Kasla (325 inhabitants) and Deir Amr (719 inhabitants).

Daniel Coit Gilman, Harry Thurston Peck and Frank Moore Colby, (Dodd, Mead and Company, 1902), 767. Biography Leopold Philippe was the son of Duke Philippe Charles d'Arenberg, who fell in the Battle of Slankamen against the Turks on August 19, 1691, when Leopold Philippe was just one year old. He fought in the War of Spanish Succession in 1706, including the battle of Malplaquet and in the Austro-Turkish War of 1716‚Äì18 as General-major in Hungary. He distinguished himself during the Battle of Belgrad, leading the infantry on the right wing. In 1718, he became governor of Hainaut in the Austrian Netherlands. At the outbreak of the War of Polish Succession against the French, he served again under Eugene of Savoy on the Rhine. He became Field Marshal in 1737 and was appointed Supreme Commander of the Austrian forces in the Netherlands. During the War of Austrian Succession, he forged a military alliance between Austria, Britain and the Netherlands. He led the Austrian Army in the Battle of Dettingen.The Encyclopedia Americana: a library of universal knowledge, Vol.2, (1918), 191. After the war he returned to the governorship of Hainaut and died in 1754 in his Arenberg Castle in Heverlee. He was an advocate of science, a friend of Voltaire and mecenas of Jean- Jacques Rousseau. He married on March 20, 1711 with Marie-Fran√ßoise Pignatelli, princess of Bisaccia and countess d'Egmont. They had six children, amongst whom was Charles Marie Raymond, 5th Duke of Arenberg (1754‚Äì1778). Another child was Marie Victoire Pauline d'Arenberg, wife of August Georg Simpert, Margrave of Baden-Baden. A third one, Marie Flore, was the wife of Jean Charles Joseph, Count of Merode, Marquis of Deynze. Together with this son-in-law and the Duke of Ursel, Leopold became one of the co-directors of the Th√©atre de la Monnaie in 1750‚Äì1752.

It is analogous to the dioxygen molecule but rarely occurs at room temperature. This violet gas is the dominant species in hot sulfur vapors. S2 is one of the minor components of the atmosphere of Io, which is predominantly composed of SO2. The instability of S2 is usually described in the context of the double bond rule. Synthesis This violet gas is generated by heating sulfur above 720 ¬∞C, comprising 99% of the vapor at low pressure (1 mm Hg) at 530 ¬∞C. Disulfur can be produced when an atmosphere of COS is irradiated with UV light using a mercury photosensitizer or when CS2, H2S2, S2Cl2 or C2H4S, PSF3 or COS are irradiated. Natural occurrence Gaseous disulfur has been detected emanating from the surface of Jupiter's moon Io, from the vicinity of Pele volcano. Properties The ground state of S2 is a triplet: a diradical, with two unpaired electrons like O2 and SO. It has the S-S bond length of 189 pm, much shorter than the S-S single bonds in S8, which are 206 pm long. Its Raman spectrum consists of a band at 715 cm‚àí1. The corresponding O-O band for O2 is found at 1556 cm‚àí1.

He was born in Germany though he immigrated to the United States and he spent his career painting in the western United States and Canada. Active primarily in the first half of the 20th century, he earned a reputation as the most important big game painter and the first career wildlife artist in North America.  Early life in Germany Rungius was born in Rixdorf, now a part of Berlin, Germany, to Pastor Heinrich Rungius (1833-1922) and Magdalene Fulda. Rungius spent most of his childhood in Britz, also part of Berlin. Rungius had seven sisters and one brother. His family had interests in art, nature, and taxidermy, and from an early age, Rungius enjoyed hunting and knew he wanted to be a wildlife painter. Upon reaching school age, Carl was sent away to live with his widowed grandmother in the village of Burg bei Magdeburg. He demonstrated a passion for hunting from a young age, and it‚Äôs this passion which would dominate his later life and be a tremendous influence on his artwork. From an early age, Rungius also showed ambition to be an artist. In his teenage years, an exhibition by Richard Friese, Germany‚Äôs foremost wildlife artist, reinforced Rungius‚Äôs ambition. He had several obstacles to overcome though before he would obtain his objective. Rungius had a tremendous dislike for school. Despite this, he completed his academic coursework and passed his examinations, qualifying for a mandatory year of military services. He served his one year of military service in 1891. His father also had strong oppositions to him becoming a painter. Eventually his father did relent, but only on the condition that Carl would start his profession in an acceptable fashion, by learning the trade of a house painter. For the next three summers, Rungius apprenticed as a wall and woodwork painter. Rungius studied art at the Berlin Art Academy from 1888-1890. Rungius‚Äôs art education began with a course in ornamental design. He was not very interested in this however, and he increasingly spent his free time at the Berlin Zoo sketching and studying the animals there. Zoo animals were not subjects he could handle physically; he could not get under their skin and see for himself how muscle, bone, tendon and tissue melded together to form the living animal. In order to get a better look at the anatomy of animals, Rungius made frequent visits to the local glue factory to study animal anatomy in its most basic form. Rungius‚Äôs father often shot stray cats in his garden and would turn the carcass‚Äôs over to Carl. Although his work in the glue factory and with cats was unpleasant, Rungius felt it was critical to his artistic development.Jon Whyte and E.J Hart, Carl Rungius: Painter if the Western Wilderness, (Salem, New Hampshire: Salem House, 1985), 10. Trip to the United States left In 1894, Rungius's Uncle Clemens Fulda invited him to hunt moose in Maine. Shortly after, in 1895, he traveled to Wyoming, which for him was an exotic experience. Open skies, mountain scenes and big game abounded. He made extensive studies of his trophies, and stalked game, which allowed him to gain a better understanding of the animals he painted. His summer in Wyoming persuaded Rugius that the United States would be his new home; ‚ÄúI painted from the collected material and later in the spring of 1896, I went back to Germany...My decision to cut all ties with the Old World and to live in America got good was due in no small part to this first Wyoming trip. For my heart was in the West.‚ÄùJon Whyte and E.J Hart, Carl Rungius: Painter if the Western Wilderness, (Salem, New Hampshire: Salem House, 1985), 36. In 1896, Rungius immigrated to the United States. After hunting and painting trips to New Brunswick in 1900-1909 and to the Yukon in 1904, Rugius‚Äôs fascination with the North American moose began. Carl Rungius - Big Horn Sheep on Wilcox Pass (1912) Rungius found work, as hunters and naturalists commissioned wildlife illustrations for their magazines, books, and campaigns to protect endangered animals. Rungius‚Äôs arrival in the United States coincided with the recognition of the plight of the continent‚Äôs game animal and bird populations. Several concerned sportsmen had turned their energy to correcting the deteriorating situation, the most noteworthy being Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt was a leader in Conservation, fighting to end the waste of natural resources. Roosevelt established the United States Forest Service, signed into law the creation of five National Parks, and signed the 1906 Antiquities Act, under which he proclaimed 18 new United States National Monuments. He also established the first 51 Bird Reserves, four Game Preserves, and 150 National Forests, including Shoshone National Forest, the nation's first. Around 1909, Rungius gave up illustrating to pursue a career as a full-time easel painter. His illustrations, however, stayed in circulation long after, playing a large role in spreading information about ethical hunting. In early twentieth-century North America, there were few major zoos and photography was still in its infancy, so illustrations from books and periodicals were the public's main source of information concerning wildlife. Trip to the Canadian Rockies Bear, 1911 In 1910, Banff tour guide Jimmy Simpson saw a reproduction of Rungius‚Äôs painting Wary Game, a painting of six Dall rams on a high spur of a wind-swept Yukon mountain ridge, in an issue of The Bulletin put out by the New York Zoological Society. Upon seeing the painting, Simpson declared ‚Äúthat fellow knows his animals and he knows his sheep.‚ÄùJon Whyte and E.J Hart, Carl Rungius: Painter if the Western Wilderness, (Salem, New Hampshire: Salem House, 1985), 7. Simpson wrote Rungius a letter in which he extended a generous invitation; if Rungius could get to Banff, Simpson would take him out on a sheep hunt at no cost. In 1910, Rungius accepted an offer to visit the Canadian Rockies, and would go on to paint a large number of his paintings there. He enjoyed the opportunities for hunting, exploration, and sport to such an extent that 1921, he built a studio in Banff, Alberta called \\"The Paintbox.\\" Rungius said that ‚ÄúI could not think of any more suitable place than Banff in Alberta. A province which has practically every species within its borders. Easy to reach and a cosmopolitan, broad-minded town right in the wilderness, at the same time offering all the comforts of a big city. My wife who had been with me here a couple of times also liked Banff and approved the idea.‚ÄùJon Whyte and E.J Hart, Carl Rungius: Painter if the Western Wilderness, (Salem, New Hampshire: Salem House, 1985), 115. Rungius worked in his Banff studio from April to October every year until his death in 1959. Art Roaring in a frenzy, the older bull upreared, wavered, and crashed backwards Rungius was an avid sportsman, and spent more time in the wilderness than other artists. By direct observation in nature, he was able to gain an exceptional insight into the animals and their environment. Rungius painted both landscapes and wildlife, often with both into a single picture. He situated animals in their natural environment, a practice that was new to painting in early twentieth century North America. His paintings are highly romanticized, and represent an Eden- like world without any signs of a human impact. Among other places, his works are featured at the American National Museum of Wildlife Art (which has the largest public collection of Rungius work), the Dutch Rijksmuseum Twenthe, and Calgary's Glenbow Museum. His work was also part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1928 Summer Olympics. Associations and clubs Rungius was made a member of The Camp Fire Club in 1896 (Runguis was in Germany when the club was founded but he was elected in absentia as one of the original twenty members). Rungius was also a member of the Boone and Crockett Club (member in 1927), The Salmagundi Club (1907), Outfitter for the annual climbing camps of the Alpine Club of Canada (1910), Associate Member of the National Academy of Design (1913, member and in 1920 he was elected as a full Academician), Honorary Scout with the Boy Scouts of America (1927), member of The Century Club, member of The Painters of the Far West, and a member Society of Animal Painters and Sculptors. Scouting In 1927, the Boy Scouts of America created Honorary Scouts to distinguish \\"American citizens whose achievements in outdoor activity, exploration and worthwhile adventure are of such an exceptional character as to capture the imagination of boys...\\". Rungius was one of eighteen who were awarded this distinction. Death Rungius died October 21, 1959 in New York City. After his death, Eric Harvie, the founder of the Glenbow Museum in Calgary, bought the entire Rungius estate including paintings, sketches, photographs, personal belongings and mementos, and the entire contents of his Banff and New York studios. This huge collection of 1,404 items makes Glenbow Museum the premier research centre in the world for Rungius scholars. Rungius had his ashes scattered on Tunnel Mountain in Banff, Alberta, loving the view overlooking the town and the Bow Valley.

Life After finishing his classical studies in the school of the Hieronymites, he studied philosophy, theology, and canon law at the Catholic University of Leuven, but refused to take his doctor's degree. In 1530 he was ordained priest, and then settled in Cologne in order to devote himself to higher studies and the practice of Christian perfection. There he became the private tutor of a number of young men, mainly university students. Peter Canisius and Lawrence Surius are noted among his pupils. In Cologne, too, he made close friendships with several members of the Carthusian Order, among them Johann Landsberger, Gerhard Homontanus, and Theoderich and Bruno Loher. Though his health did not allow him to become a member of the order, he lived in the monastery, for a time at least, and followed its rule of life as closely as possible. In 1538 Nicolaus was appointed pastor of the B√©guinage at Diest; after a year he surrendered his charge for a time, but took it up again, with such success that after his death he was commonly spoken of as the saintly Father Eschius. He was also instrumental in founding several diocesan seminaries according to the rules laid down by the Council of Trent.

The members of the CISF Unit at Bokaro had formed an all-India association in March 1979 and Sadanand Jha, was elected as its General Secretary. Thereafter, a country wide agitation was carried on for recognition of the said association. In June 1979 some of the members of the said association were called upon to meet the Home Minister at Delhi. A delegation of the said association went to Delhi. While there ; they staged a demonstration. Some of the demonstrators, including Sadanand Jha, were arrested, but subsequently released on bail. At Bokaro Steel Plant, the agitation which was going on and the situation aggravated from 27 May 1979. Whereas a large group of members of CISF Unit, Bokaro Steel Ltd, Bokaro took out processions and raised slogans such as INQULAB ZINDABAD, VARDI VARDI VARDI BHAI BHAI LARKE LENGE PAI PAI, JO HAMSE TAKRAYEGE CHOOR CHOOR HO JAYEGA and PUNJAB KI JEET HAMARI HAI AAB CISF KI BARI HAI, participating in the gherao of Supervisory Officers, participating hunger strike and 'dharna' near the Quarter Guard and Administrative Building of CISF Unit, Bokaro Steel Ltd. since 27 May 1979 in violation of the provisions of CISF Act, 1968. Out of 1900 persons belonging to CISF Unit, Bokaro Steel Plant, Bokaro about 1000 persons participated in the processions and violent demonstrations. The said agitation and the violent activity reached a very serious proportion in the last week of June, 1979 with the result that Army had to be called by the State Authorities on 23.6.1979, so as to restore normalcy in the area. The State Government had also deployed 9 Magistrates to assist the Army authorities as also the CRPF for restoring the normal conditions at the Bokaro Steel Plant. On 24.6.1979, on seeing the arrival of the Army, the agitators started making preparations for armed resistance by putting up sand bags, flood lights and barricades in the CISF Lines. They had gained the control of CISF Lines and the Officers were not allowed to have any access to the Lines or to other ranks of CISF. On 25.6.1979, the Army along with 9 Magistrates took up positions round the CISF Lines in the early hours and called upon the agitators to give up charge of the Armory. In spite of giving repeated warnings by the authorities to give up charge of the Armory, the agitators did not give up arms, but, instead, resorted to violence. The agitators started firing at 0320 hours at the Army. The Army returned the fire. The said exchange of fire continued for 3 hours before the Army could spell out the violent retaliation of the agitators. The said violent exchange of fire resulted in the instant death of one Army Major and 2 more Army personnel were also killed as a result of firing by the CISF personnel. It may also be stated that there were 22/29 deaths in the course of the said pitched battle, which went on for three hours between the violent armed agitators and the Army.

She was armed with guns and depth charges and was used as a weather patrol ship, a convoy escort, and as a patrol craft. She experienced action in the dangerous North Atlantic Ocean, but returned home safely after war's end. Constructed in Maryland  Manhasset (AG 47) was built by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, Sparrows Point, Maryland, in 1923 as merchantman Wilton; acquired by the U.S. Maritime Commission from her owner, Eastern Steamship Lines, Inc., in 1941; transferred under time charter to the Navy 2 January 1942; renamed Manhasset and reclassified from YAG-8 to AG-47 on 30 May 1942; converted for use as a weather patrol ship by Sullivan Drydock and Repair Corp., Brooklyn, New York; and loaned to the U.S. Coast Guard and commissioned 8 August 1942, Lt. Comdr. P. L. Stinson, USCG, in command. World War II operations  Equipped with specialized meteorological instruments, Manhasset joined the weather patrol in the North Atlantic Ocean to gather vital weather information used in compiling forecasts for Allied European operations against the Axis. She braved the dangers of stormy seas and the menace of German U-boats while operating her assigned and isolated patrol areas out of Argentia, Newfoundland, and Boston, Massachusetts. She averaged about one patrol a month, usually about three weeks long. Manhasset also patrolled and searched for German submarines. While cruising midway between Flemish Cap and Cape Farewell, Greenland, she depth charged a suspected U-boat, with no positive results, 27 April 1943. My father, Clarence A. White, was one of the Meteorologists on this ship. He was working for the government Weather Bureau in Evansville, Indiana, when the Coast Guard requested volunteers for their weather ships. As the USCG Manhasset being one In need, Dad volunteered. He has told me of this suspected U-Boat attack on their ship. Everyone onboard had a job to do defending the ship. His was to \\"man\\" the .50 Caliber machinegun on deck. It was a tense time, he said, as the depth charges were all dropped hoping to destroy the enemy submarine thus saving their lives. They had a \\"sister\\" weather ship which was less fortunate than they were as it was sunk a few months later. Dad passed away on Veteran's Day, 11 November 2013 at the age of 102. The following week convoy ONS-5 (Outbound from Liverpool to Nova Scotia, Slow) steamed through her patrol station, and on 5 May she provided support during one of the largest convoy battles of World War II, the convoy included 43 merchant vessels, 7 escorts, 2 trawlers, and a fuel ship and was joined by other Allied ships as the battle progressed. Attacking them were members of three Wolfpacks, Specht, Meisel, and Amsel, including 58 U-Boats. The battle raged between late 4 May and early 6 May. Although the convoy lost 13 ships, the escorts sank five U-Boats and repulsed the remainder. Occurring in \\"Black May,\\" the month marking the dramatic decline in the U-Boat effectiveness in WWII, when Allied efforts repulsed or sank most opposition, the Battle with ONS-5 was the final wolfpack attack against the northern merchant trade routes in the Battle of the North Atlantic. As Manhasset patrolled near the British merchant ship Dolius, torpedoed and abandoned earlier in the day but still afloat, she made sound contact with a submarine late in the afternoon. She made six vigorous depth charge attacks and sighted first a periscope wake followed by an oil slick. However, she sighted no wreckage and broke off attack to guard the torpedoed ship after more than 2 hours of searching.  Transferred to the Coast Guard  Manhasset contained her weather station patrols during the rest of the war. The Navy transferred her to the U.S. Coast Guard 22 October 1943, and her name was struck from the Navy List 30 October 1943. Post-war dispositioning  On 15 October 1945 she was decommissioned by the Coast Guard, and, on 16 October 1946, she was sold. Entered merchant service as Manahasset (Cia de Navigacion Maritima Cassipio SA, Panama), 1946. Wrecked on Sable Island, Nova Scotia, 4 July 1947. My father, Edgar Warren Stevanus USN was one of four weathermen on the Manhasset the last 18 or so months of the war. He was the only Navy person on an otherwise all Coast Guard crew. The weathermen worked in 2's, 12 hours on and 12 hours off seven days a week. Edgar Stevanus is a retired Postmaster and lives in Sugarcreek, Ohio. Edgar Stevanus died November, 2013 at age 94.

He attended Diocesan College and Cambridge University, where he graduated in 1930 with Honours in Law and was called to the Bar at the Inner Temple. After practising law for a time in London, he returned to South Africa in 1932 and was admitted as an advocate to the Bar of the Cape Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa. He was made a Q.C. in 1952 and practised at the Cape Bar until 1964. He was also President of the Cape Bar Council from 1961 to 1963.rel=\\"nofollow\\" http://www.lib.uct.ac.za/mss/index.php?html=/mss/newaids/BC579.HTM&msscollid;=168 Political career Molteno was involved in anti-Apartheid politics from a young age. In 1937 he was approached by the ANC, who asked him to represent them in the House of Assembly. He was elected a Member of Parliament at the age of 29, representing the Western Cape constituency for 11 years until 1948. During this time he was an exceptionally prominent and active MP in the opposition. He was a member of the Civil Rights League, Cafda and the Cape Joint Council of Europeans and Bantu. He was also the regional representative on the South African Institute of Race Relations in the Western Cape in 1936, and was its president from 1958 to 1960. It was partly due to his fight against the segregationalist policies of J. B. M. Hertzog that he acquired the Xhosa name Dilizintaba (\\"Remover of mountains\\"). He went on to become the first chairman of the Liberal Party of South Africa's constitutional committee before he joined the Progressive Party (South Africa) and became chairman of its constitutional policy commission as well. He was also one of the Counsel engaged in the constitutional cases questioning the powers of the Union Parliament of South Africa after the passing of the Statute of Westminster in 1931. Molteno was a supporter and the main legal advisor of the Black Sash movement, from soon after it began in 1955. The movement later wrote of him: \\"He taught us all we had to know about Civil Rights, about the inequities and iniquities of the pass laws and influx control...; and so very much more. His knowledge and experience illuminated all our efforts to inform and educate ourselves and the South African public.\\" (The Black Sash, Feb. 1973) Academic career and later life Mr Molteno was a member of the University of Cape Town Council (from 1951 to 1960) as well as a part-time lecturer in Constitutional and Administrative Law at that institution. He lectured full- time at the Department of Roman Dutch Law from 1964, and in 1967 was appointed Professor of the newly created Department of Public Law. Molteno was appointed Dean of the Faculty of Law in 1970 - a position he held until his death in 1972. He left two children by his first wife Veronica Str√∂ms√∂e and three by his second wife Mary Fleet Goldsmith. The Dictionary of South African Biography (Vol.5, p. 515) described him as, \\"a man of great humanity, as well as of brilliant intellect.\\" He appears as a character in the novel Ah, but Your Land is Beautiful by his colleague and contemporary Alan Paton.

Penned by several authors, the series takes place during the Horus Heresy, a fictional galaxy-spanning civil war occurring 10,000 years prior to the far future of Warhammer 40,000. The war is described as a major contributing factor to the game's dystopian environment. The books are published in several media by the Black Library, a Games Workshop division, with the first title released in April 2006; the series consists of 56 published volumes, with more in the pipeline. The series has developed into a distinct and successful product line for the Black Library; titles have often appeared in bestseller lists, and overall the work has received critical approval despite reservations. It is an established, definitive component of Games Workshop's Horus Heresy sub-brand, and authoritative source material for the entire Warhammer shared universe and its continuing development. Overview The Horus Heresy is a dark, far future military space opera concerning an intergalactic civil war within the nascent Imperium of Man, and which constitutes a cornerstone event of the dystopian science fantasy Warhammer 40,000 universe. The Horus Heresy is presented as a major chapter of conflict in the Warhammer 40,000 lore: it is caused by a Chaos plot to foil the Imperium's leader and founder, the mysterious Emperor of Man, by fomenting rebellion and internecine warfare in the expanding Imperium of Man. The story focuses on the Emperor's 21 genetically engineered lieutenants, the Primarchs, and the legions of genetically-enhanced superhuman soldiers that they lead, the Legiones Astartes, which find themselves divided into loyalist and traitor factions as they struggle for religious hegemony. The shared universe was originally created in 1987 by Games Workshop, parent company of series publisher Black Library, as the campaign setting for the Warhammer 40,000 tabletop miniatures wargame and in 2006 Black Library began publishing The Horus Heresy series. The series consists of full-length novels, and novel- length compilations of novellas or short stories, written by a number of authors. The series includes new characters as well as establishing the background of previously-established Warhammer 40,000 characters who play an important role in the post-Heresy fictional universe. The first three novels in The Horus Heresy are an opening book trilogy. This trilogy presents some of the background and causes of the Heresy, and describes the start of the conflict. The arc's focus is on Warmaster Horus, the principal antagonist, and covers about two years in the overall Heresy timeline; most of this period elapses before the rebellion begins. Following the trilogy, the narrative is not strictly sequential and is often presented in nonlinear fashion from book to book. Apart from the initial trilogy, the stories often concern events that happen earlier or later than their position in the series would suggest, or may include time periods already covered in other series titles. The majority of stories in The Horus Heresy are set around the start of the fictional universe's 31st millennium, in contrast to most Warhammer 40,000 material, which takes place in the 41st millennium. The stories in The Horus Heresy routinely cover the conflict's background, with some going back centuries before the war (and the 31st millennium) begins. In narrower scope, the entire conflict (including the Heresy proper and its proximate formative period), is depicted as having lasted less than a decade. With few exceptions, the sequence and dating of Heresy events is implied rather than stated in The Horus Heresy stories.

Originating from Terra (Earth), it is an interstellar crusade that claims the galaxy as the rightful domain of Humankind, and aims to reunite the multitude of scattered human colonies remaining from earlier space exploration under the domain of an \\"Imperium of Man\\". Organised in numerous expeditions, the Crusade fields huge fleets and vast armies; at its forefront, led by the Primarchs, are Legions of Space Marines genetically-enhanced supersoldiers numbering in the millions. Over the course of two Terran centuries, the Crusade has reached star systems more than 50,000 light years away from its original staging point in the Sol (Solar) System, has assimilated millions of worlds into the Imperium, and has given Humankind a dominant position among the galaxy's species. Its grand mastermind is the \\"Emperor of Mankind\\", a mysterious superhuman of unknown origin. The Emperor, founder and head of the Imperium, is a being of towering charisma, prowess, conviction, and ability. He has declared an agnostic worldview, the \\"Imperial Truth\\", which promotes science, rationalism, and human primacy. Unknown to the common citizenry, he is also the most powerful human (or humanlike) psychic, referred to as psykers, and is overall one of the most formidable psychics in the galaxy. Officially, the Imperium denies the existence of psychic phenomena, including its manifestations as witchcraft and sorcery, and punishes its belief as ignorant and superstitious; yet the Imperium is also dependent on psychic activity in order to achieve faster-than-light travel between its scattered dominions. The Emperor knows that psychic phenomena originate in The Warp, a parallel dimension reflecting the events of the material world at its most emotional. Within the Warp exist Daemons, sentient vortices of concentrated feeling that are chiefly malignant. The Daemons are themselves in service to the Chaos Gods, also known as the Ruinous Powers, titanic collectives of dark will whose rulership over the parallel dimension is supreme. These malign immaterial entities forever seek to breach the material universe and subject all life within it to foul and debased whims. Awareness and perception of the Chaos Gods and their Daemons serves as the basis of numerous faiths and religions in the setting, both human and alien in origin. Knowing followers of the Chaos Gods, though rare, refer to their faith as the Primordial Truth, or the Primordial Annihilator. Humankind's continuing biological and psycho-spiritual evolution includes the gradual development of widespread Warp-related psychic abilities that will make the species far more susceptible to Chaotic influence; united under the Imperium of Man, the Emperor seeks to protect all of mankind by using faith in the Imperial Truth as a shield. The powers of Chaos desire change and conflict by nature, and seek to destabilise and subvert the Imperium's order over the galaxy from within. Book 1 to Book 10 1\\\\. Horus Rising: The seeds of heresy are sown Horus Rising, the series opener, starts in the early years of the 31st millennium, during the 203rd year of the Great Crusade. It describes the rise to power of Horus Lupercal, Primarch of the \\"Luna Wolves\\" Legion of Space Marines, and the most versatile and favoured \\"son\\" of the Emperor. The Emperor has recently appointed him Warmaster, overall commander of Imperial military forces, while also leaving him in charge of the rest of the Crusade; the Emperor meanwhile returns to Terra, where in relative isolation he undertakes a secret project to which not even Horus is privy. The focus and perspective of the novel centres on a Space Marine Captain, Garviel Loken, leader of the Luna Wolves' 10th Company. He becomes a member of the Mournival, an informal advisory body to Horus, and participates in Crusade campaigns against anti-Imperial human populations and aliens, referred to in the series as \\"xenos\\". The story also hints at tensions in the nascent Imperium, exacerbated by the Emperor's absence and contentious actions and inactions these are common themes in following books. 2\\\\. False Gods: The heresy takes root False Gods picks up a few weeks after the conclusion of Horus Rising in the series timeline, and tells the story of Horus' fall. In a complicated conspiracy implemented by followers of Chaos, Horus is mortally wounded during a Crusade mission by a Chaos-tainted xenos weapon. In a desperate action by his lieutenants to ensure his survival one taken in strict contradiction to Imperial doctrine Horus is brought to a local temple with a reputation for healing. The temple is the seat of a powerful Chaos cult, and both Horus' wound and its supposed healing makes him susceptible to Chaos' influence. He ultimately turns against his \\"father\\", the Emperor, and sets in motion the entire Heresy. This novel further highlights the institutional and personal tensions that accompany the Imperium's maturity into the preeminent power of the galaxy; they include rifts among the Primarchs, as well as both between and within their Space Marine Legions. Conflicts and characters flaws are repeatedly and effectively manipulated by Chaos in pursuit of their agenda throughout the series. A parallel storyline, also present in several other books, involves the growing influence both within the Crusade Expeditionary forces and across the wider Imperium of a forbidden religious cult, whose members, while loyal to the Emperor and Imperium, defy the Imperial Truth by worshipping the Emperor as a god. 3\\\\. Galaxy in Flames: The heresy revealed Galaxy in Flames starts shortly after the end of False Gods. It outlines the corrupted Warmaster's descent into madness, which leads to the fomentation of his plot to betray the Imperium. Horus pursues his secret planning of the rebellion in earnest, seeking and finding allies among his disgruntled fellow Primarchs, their Legions, and the Imperium's other organisations and key personalities. The novel details the first open move of the Heresy, the \\"Betrayal of Istvaan III\\", wherein factions of four Astartes Legions who were deemed unconvertible by their traitor brethren are ambushed during a planetary invasion of the fictional star system. The novel marks the first distinguishment of the \\"Loyalists\\" and \\"Traitor\\" factions within the Legions and other rebel forces, including the unmodified soldiers of the Imperial Army. 4\\\\. The Flight of the Eisenstein: The heresy unfolds The Flight of the Eisenstein follows the eponymous Eisenstein, a space frigate of the \\"Death Guard\\" 14th Legion of Space Marines. The story follows the ship's escape from the Betrayal of Istvaan III, crewed by surviving loyalists of the four Legions present at the battle and commanded by Battle‚ÄëCaptain Nathaniel Garro of the Death Guard 7th Company and one of the few Commanders in the Traitor Legions that remain loyal to the Emperor followed by the perilous voyage the vessel must take across the galaxy in an effort to reach Terra and raise the alarm over the developing rebellion. Garro and the others on board the vessel face suspicion and incredulity from Imperial authorities; apart from the inconceivable news of Horus' betrayal, the situation is complicated by the fact that many of the travellers on the Eisenstein now openly proclaim their belief in the Emperor's divinity, itself a heresy. 5\\\\. Fulgrim: Visions of Treachery Fulgrim centers on the eponymous Primarch of the \\"Emperor's Children\\". Characterised as flamboyant perfectionists, the novel tracks the descent of Fulgrim and his Legion into the service of Chaos roughly simultaneously with that of time Horus in (Book 2). Fulgrim is delivered a warning about Horus' imminent betrayal and the disaster that may follow by the alien Eldar race, but he and his staff dismiss it. The Emperor's Children eventually become the \\"Chosen\\" of Slaanesh, one of the four Gods of Chaos, with which Fulgrim is slowly and unwittingly drawn into grotesque communion. Primarch Ferrus Manus and his \\"Iron Hands\\" Space Marines (the 10th Legion) also play a prominent role in the novel as Fulgrim attempts to lure them into betrayal, and several other Primarchs and Legions make appearances. Described in passing is the pivotal Battle of Isstvaan V, also known as the , where several entirely Loyalist Legions are slaughtered in another Traitor ambush in the Isstvan star system. The battle fully reveals the scale and ferocity of the rebellion. 6\\\\. Descent of Angels: Loyalty and honour Descent of Angels is a pre-Heresy story that concludes about 50 years before the start of that conflict. It introduces the \\"Dark Angels\\", first of the Space Marine Legions, and their Primarch Lion El'Jonson. The story is mainly told from the viewpoint of Zahariel El'Zurias, a native of the fictional planet . Caliban is an isolated, low-technology world that resembles a feudal medieval fantasy setting. Zahariel is introduced in the story as an Aspirant of the Order, an organisation of techno-barbarian knights. The first half of the novel is set on Caliban and covers the final battles of the Order under the leadership of Jonson, the future Primarch. The book's second half describes Caliban's unification with the Imperium of Man as well as the actions of the Dark Angels during the early years of the Great Crusade. In this part of the story, Zahariel, selected as a candidate Space Marine, is accepted as a Dark Angel . A future schism within the Legion is intimated towards the end of the book. 7\\\\. Legion: Secrets and lies Legion focuses on the \\"Alpha Legion\\", the of the Space Marine Legions. Characterised in earlier publications as clandestine and inscrutable, the book constitutes a major development of the entire canon of the setting with the revelation that the Legion's Primarch is actually a pair of twins, Alpharius and Omegon. The book also features the Imperial Army, the regular unmodified human fighting force of the Imperium, covering several officers and their units. Lastly, the novel introduces a new organisation to the setting, the enigmatic and ancient an interspecies organisation opposed to Chaos. The human John Grammaticus is introduced as a prominent Cabal member. The story takes place over roughly a 6‚Äëmonth period, about two years before the Heresy starts; it describes the events that eventually lead Alpharius and Omegon (publicly a single figure named Alpharius Omegon) to support Horus. 8\\\\. Battle for the Abyss: My brother, my enemy Battle for the Abyss concerns the lead‚Äëup to a Traitor invasion of , a remote star system and the home base of the unshakeably- Loyalist 13th Legion, the \\"Ultramarines\\" (Book 19 and 24). Early in the Heresy, the Traitor Word Bearers Legion is tasked with organising and leading the invasion; they plan to use an immense, secretly commissioned warship, the , to spearhead the surprise attack. The vessel, commanded by Fleet Captain Zadkiel, launches from shipyards near Jupiter around the time of the events on Isstvan III (Book 3), and sets course for Macragge, Ultramar's capital world. Leading the cast of Loyalist protagonists is Cestus, Fleet Commander and Captain of the 7th Company of the Ultramarines. They become aware of the powerful capital ship's true purpose, and engage in long pursuit; they will seek to prevent the Furious Abyss from participating in the invasion and from reaching Macragge. 9\\\\. Mechanicum: Knowledge is power Mechanicum is the first book in the series not to focus on either the Primarchs or their Space Marines Legions. The novel centres on the eponymous \\"Mechanicum\\", a cult of machine- worshipping technologists based on the real-life planet Mars and which serves as the chief engineering authority in the nascent Imperium. The machinations of Horus and the Chaos-worshipping Traitors affects the Martian cult as much as every other Imperial organisation, leading to a civil war on Mars itself. Kelbor-Hal, Fabricator General of Mars and the technocracy's supreme leader, declares for Horus, and together they carry out a coup d'√©tat to eliminate Techpriest and Magos adherents of the Cult who are loyal to Terra and the Emperor. As the Mechanicum is the sole power responsible for all civil and military technology in the Imperium, the conflict has vast implications for whichever side of the broader intergalactic civil war receives Mars' crucial support. 10\\\\. Tales of Heresy Tales of Heresy is a collection of short stories introducing and expanding upon numerous threads within the greater happenings of the Heresy. Various stories centre on the , the elite Praetorian Guard- esque retinue of the Emperor, and the , a classified Imperial organisation of anti-psychic warrior‚Äënuns originally introduced in Book 4. Most stories are concurrent with the Heresy, with some occurring in the years prior. It includes two stories that take place on Terra, one of which occurs long before the Heresy and adds to the background regarding the Imperial Truth; another entry in the compilation is a Primarch origin story, covering the contentious circumstances under which the gladiatorial Primarch Angron takes command of the , which he renames from the \\"Warhounds\\" to the \\"World Eaters\\". The book contains seven stories by various authors; several stories relate to full- length novels in the series. This anthology contains the following stories: Blood Games by Dan Abnett, Wolf at the Door by Mike Lee, Scions of the Storm by Anthony Reynolds, The Voice by James Swallow, Call of the Lion by Gav Thorpe, The Last Church by Graham McNeill and After Desh'ea by Matthew Farrer. Book 11 to Book 20 11\\\\. Fallen Angels: Deceit and betrayal Fallen Angels continues the Dark Angels tale begun in Book 6, Descent of Angels. The novel starts around the time of Book 6's conclusion, about 50 years before the Heresy, but forwards to just about the time of the Heresy's beginning in the opening chapters. It tells two stories: one concerns the effort of Primarch Lion El'Jonson and a small group of Dark Angels to deny a (a planet devoted to manufacturing, especially of weapons) to Horus' forces; the other is the story of Luther (Lion El'Jonson's second), Zahariel El'Zurias (by now a full Space Marine), and a Dark Angels contingent sent back to Caliban, the Dark Angels Legion home world. They get involved in the fight against a growing insurgency that seeks to free the planet from under the Imperium's thumb. 12\\\\. A Thousand Sons: All is dust... A Thousand Sons is the story of Primarch Magnus and the \\"Thousand Sons\\" Space Marines, the 15th Legion; it mainly takes place before the Heresy begins. Following a reprimand by the Emperor for dabbling in sorcery, Magnus and his Legion secretly continue to study the forbidden subjects. Then, around the time of Horus' corruption (Book 2), Magnus learns through sorcery of his brother's impending betrayal. He tries again through sorcery to warn the Emperor, believing that the gravity of the news justifies his disobedience. However, he overreaches with his powers and damages the vital and secret project the Emperor is undertaking (Book 1), endangering the safety of Terra itself in the process. The Emperor is enraged and orders Leman Russ, Primarch of the 6th Legion (the \\"Space Wolves\\"), to , the Thousand Sons Legion's in‚Äëseries home world. The Space Wolves, accompanied by other Imperial forces, are to bring Magnus and his Legion to Terra to account for themselves. 13\\\\. Nemesis: War within the shadows Nemesis is set about two years after the events on Isstvan V described in Book 5, Fulgrim. It is a look at the war behind the war, the covert operations undertaken by the opposing sides in order to influence the visible conflict. Specifically, it deals with a plan by a secret Imperial organisation, the , to eliminate Horus; an \\"Execution Force\\" consisting of operatives from all of the Officio's disciplines, and led by top-rated sniper Eristede Kell, is tasked with the mission. There have been several previous unsuccessful attempts against Horus' life, and this gives a high-ranking officer of the Traitor Word Bearers Legion the idea to field a nemesis weapon of his own: a highly specialised assassin, who is to be used in an audacious scheme to kill the Emperor. 14\\\\. The First Heretic: Fall to Chaos The First Heretic details the fall to Chaos of Primarch Lorgar and the the \\"Word Bearers\\". Decades before the start of the rebellion they become heretics relative to the Imperial Truth by introducing religious worship. This results in public and humiliating censure of Lorgar and the entire assembled Legion, by the Emperor himself. The despairing Lorgar is subsequently swayed by two of his most trusted lieutenants, who are in secret allegiance with Chaos; eventually both Primarch and Legion covertly embrace (and promote) the Primordial Truth, many years before Horus' corruption. The story is largely told from the point of view of Argel Tal, a Captain of the Word Bearers, who becomes commander of a Chaos-possessed elite Legion unit. It spans several decades, starting 43 years before the events on Isstvan V (Book 5) and concluding around the time the Word Bearers are on their way to assault Calth (Book 19). 15\\\\. Prospero Burns: The Wolves unleashed Prospero Burns is part of the story arc of Book 12, however it follows a different but related timeline. The story begins more than a century before the Space Wolves-led mission to Prospero, and the concurrent start of the Heresy. It is presented from the point of view of Kasper Hawser, formerly a noted Terran academic who becomes a Crusade Remembrancer, and then the Oral Historian or of the 3rd Company of the Space Wolves Legion. On the surface it is his story; the important understory concerns the long-term machinations of Chaos, whose aim is the destruction of both Space Wolves and Thousand Sons. Chaos attempts to exploit the weaknesses of the Primarchs and their Legions in order to pit them against each other the ultimate result is the confrontation on Prospero. While this confrontation is taking place, Horus' previously covert rebellion becomes visible (Book 3). The novel also adds background to Horus' fall and to the planning of the Heresy campaign by Chaos and its forces. 16\\\\. Age of Darkness Age of Darkness is a compilation of nine short stories by various authors. They take place during the seven‚Äëyear period between the Dropsite Massacre on Isstvan V (Book 5), and the conclusion of Horus' campaign. The stories present various facets of the unfolding conflict, as suspicion, insecurity, and paranoia spread through the galaxy on the wake of the Warmaster's betrayal. Subjects include: a Primarch prepares for the end of the Imperium; a Traitor PSYOP topples an Imperial planet; an unusual diplomatic contest will decide which side will be chosen by a world on the fence; a non-combatant may be a rebel agent or a herald of unpalatable truths for the Imperium; a Loyalist Space Marine in a Traitor Legion holds his own against his erstwhile brothers. Several of the included stories are linked through continuity; some are also prequels or sequels to stories in other series books. This anthology contains the following stories: Rules of Engagement by Graham McNeill, Liar's Due by James Swallow, Forgotten Sons by Nick Kyme, The Last Remembrancer by John French, Rebirth by Chris Wraight, The Face of Treachery by Gav Thorpe, Little Horus by Dan Abnett, The Iron Within by Rob Sanders, Savage Weapons by Aaron Dembski-Bowden. 17\\\\. The Outcast Dead: The truth lies within The Outcast Dead is the first novel-length story in the series to take place almost entirely on Terra. It covers a relatively short period, starting several months before Magnus' catastrophic psychic visit at the Imperial Palace (Book 12), and concluding several months after this event. The unauthorised visit is central to the story: apart from damaging the Emperor's top secret project (Book 1) and the planet's defense, it massively disrupts Terra's long-range communications infrastructure. The ensuing isolation and confusion cause indecision and delays for the Loyalist side. The story's main character is Kai Zulane, previously a gifted Imperial attached to the Ultramarines Legion. He unwittingly becomes the keeper of a secret that could decide the victor in the developing galactic civil war. The secret has additional implications regarding the Heresy's conclusion and the future course of the Imperium of Man. \\"The Outcast Dead\\" are other protagonists: a small, disparate group of Space Marines suspected as traitors, with whom Zulane falls in during the second half of the book. 18\\\\. Deliverance Lost: Ghosts of Terra Deliverance Lost is mainly concerned with the actions of Primarch Corvus Corax and his Space Marine Command, or \\"Raven Guard\\", during the year following the Dropsite Massacre (Book 5). However, operatives and the Primarch of the Alpha Legion play a prominent role. The story starts about 3 months after the Dropsite Massacre, with the unexpected rescue of Corax and the remnants of his Legion (at less than 5% strength due to casualties in that battle). Arriving at Terra a few months after the events described in The Outcast Dead take place, Corax convinces the Emperor to impart to him the knowledge and material that may accelerate the rebuilding of his Legion. The second part of the novel describes the effort to reconstitute the Raven Guard, undertaken on (its home world in Warhammer 40,000 fiction), and the pursuit of opposite objectives by the Alpha Legion. The novel features the reappearance of The Cabal (Book 7), and of other well-known characters; it also adds information about the developing strategies and subterfuge applied by the opposing sides, including reasons for Horus' timetable and for the Emperor's actions during the initial stages of the Heresy. 19\\\\. Know No Fear: The battle of Calth Know No Fear documents the rebels' surprise assault on Calth, an ascendant Ultramar system world. It is planned and led by the Traitor Word Bearers Legion, now fully and openly committed to the spread of the Primordial Truth. The narrative starts close to where the timelines of Book 8 and Book 14 converge (in their respective conclusions), with the invasion force en route to, or near the planet. The rebel mission has aims beyond just delivering a crippling blow to the Ultramarines Legion and their home system; its objectives may affect the entire Heresy campaign. The story tracks the Calth assault from its opening covert phases, and the actions of several characters. Unaware of the developing rebellion and the Word Bearers' true role and allegiance, Primarch Roboute Guilliman and his Ultramarines are unprepared for the underhand invasion: it is total, bloody war, with ritualistic undertones, scorched earth tactics, decisive use of technology, and the considerable involvement of Chaos; the inconceivable treachery and its implications forever change the Loyalists' view of reality. 20\\\\. The Primarchs The Primarchs is a compilation of four novellas by different authors, each story starring one of the \\"sons\\" of the Emperor. The novellas further develop these characters, who make multiple appearances in the series: following the Dropsite Massacre (Book 5), Fulgrim, perversely empowered by his own corruption, reveals his true nature and future plans to top officers of his compromised Legion; during a Great Crusade campaign against the enigmatic Eldar, Ferrus Manus, already beset by unsettling dreams, is subjected by alien sorcerers to stark, portentous visions and warnings about his future and role in the soon to be revealed Heresy; with Horus' rebellion in full swing after the events of Isstvan V, a suspicious and isolated Lion El'Jonson accepts the newly revealed realities of the Warp and decides on an independent course of action for the Dark Angels in the unfolding conflict; around the same time, and plotting a typically indecipherable course in the expanding war, the twinned Primarch of the Alpha Legion is involved in a unique counterintelligence operation that extends the Legion's customary deceptions inwards. This anthology contains the following stories: The Reflection Crack‚Äôd by Graham McNeill, Feat of Iron by Nick Kyme, The Lion by Gav Thorpe and The Serpent Beneath by Rob Sanders. Book 21 to Book 30 21\\\\. Fear to Tread: The angel falls Fear to Tread describes an operation by the forces of Chaos that is supposed to turn Primarch Sanguinius and the the \\"Blood Angels\\", to their cause. To succeed, Chaos plans to take advantage of a genetic flaw in Sanguinius' and the Legion's DNA. As the Heresy is getting under way, the outwardly still loyal Warmaster orders the entire 9th Legion and their unsuspecting Primarch to a remote star system. There they find themselves isolated and ambushed, fighting a new kind of war against Chaos entities and daemons designed to trigger the Legion's flaw. The plan almost succeeds; yet conflicting agendas among anti- Imperial protagonists, as well as the fortitude and unorthodox tactics of quick-to-adapt Blood Angels, narrowly result in Loyalist victory. In the meantime Horus' rebellion erupts openly and the Loyalists suffer catastrophic losses in the Dropsite Massacre (Book 5). Sanguinius and his Legion, now fully aware of the great betrayal and the reality of Chaos, race to the defense of Terra and the Emperor while buffeted by unprecedented navigational difficulties; it is hinted that these are related to the action in the Ultramar system of Calth (Books 19 and 24). 22\\\\. Shadows of Treachery Shadows of Treachery is a compilation that collects five short stories previously published in limited editions, art books, or other formats, and also contains two new novellas. Most of the stories involve the respectively the Loyalist \\"Imperial Fists\\" and Traitor \\"Night Lords\\", and their Primarchs Rogal Dorn and Konrad Curze. Other Legions and Primarchs are also featured, while one short story takes place on Mars and illuminates an aspect of the Traitor Mechanicum's conspiracy. One of the novellas is mainly about an all-out close- quarters space battle, between a Loyalist sent to punish Horus following the events of Isstvan III (Book 3) and the Traitor fleet that ambushes it; the other new novella deals with the aftermath of another naval engagement in space that cripples the Night Lords Legion. The narratives of all stories fill gaps in the series or add further details about the Heresy and its actors; they cover periods that range from several decades before the conflict to around the time frame of Book 18 (one short story is a prequel to that novel). This anthology contains the following stories: The Crimson Fist by John French, The Dark King by Graham McNeill, The Lightning Tower by Dan Abnett, The Kaban Project by Graham McNeill, Raven's Flight by Gav Thorpe, Death of a Silversmith by Graham McNeill and Prince of Crows by Aaron Dembski-Bowden. 23\\\\. Angel Exterminatus: Flesh and iron Angel Exterminatus covers a Traitor operation in uncharted and dangerous galactic space, that may purportedly decide the war in favour of the rebels. The story provides further glimpses of disparate motivations and conflicting objectives among traitor factions as the Heresy campaign continues. It is taking place some time after the Dropsite Massacre (Book 5), shortly following the events described by two novellas (Books 20 and 22). Featured are the 4th Legion of Space Marines, the \\"Iron Warriors\\", renowned siege masters of the Great Crusade, and their Primarch Perturabo. However the core plot is set in motion by Fulgrim and the Emperor's Children, who share the spotlight. The embittered Iron Warriors have aligned with Horus out of frustration with the ignominious and unheralded role assigned them by the Imperium; before the story begins, they lash out in unforgivable genocide. In the story, they are invited to the freelance operation (which is unknown to the Warmaster) by Fulgrim and his Legion, who have their own agenda. The operation's true goal is kept secret from Perturabo and his Space Marines, who come to realise that not all fellow rebels can be trusted. A side thread involves Fabius Bile, the chief medical officer of the Emperor's Children, and the Traitors' top geneticist; he is on a no-holds- barred quest to exceed the Emperor's genetic achievements. 24\\\\. Betrayer: Blood for the Blood God Betrayer returns the series to the action in the Ultramar theatre; it starts around the time the events of Book 19 begin to unfold. Unlike that story, Betrayer is presented from the perspective of the rebels, in this case the World Eaters and Word Bearers Legions, and often through the particular viewpoint of Kh√¢rn, Captain of the 8th Company of the World Eaters and Equerry to Primarch Angron. In tenuous and fragile cooperation, the two very different Traitor Legions lay waste to worlds across Ultramar; it is a \\"Shadow Crusade\\" meticulously planned by Primarch Lorgar of the Word Bearers, who deploys Abyss-class spaceships. The campaign's strategic goal is the destruction or isolation of the powerful Ultramarines Legion, its home star system, and the system's considerable resources; removing Ultramar as a factor in the war is one of Horus' primary objectives. The scheming Primarch of the Word Bearers orchestrates genocide in unprecedented scale, as a way to summon the powers of Chaos. With their help, he hopes to generate the so-called , an immense interdimensional disturbance that will create an impenetrable veil around Ultramar. As the final piece of his plan, Lorgar engineers the \\"ascension\\" into daemonhood of the increasingly unstable Angron: the event is to act as the conduit for the unnatural storm. 25\\\\. Mark of Calth Mark of Calth is the fifth compilation to appear in the series; it contains seven short stories and one novella, each by a different author. The stories further describe aspects of the rebels' Ultramar campaign, as close prequels or sequels of Books 19 and 24\\\\. \\"Premium\\" editions and the e‚Äëaudiobook version were released April 2013; text-based general release editions were expected mid-to-late 2013\\\\. This anthology contains the following stories: The Shards of Erebus by Guy Haley, Calth That Was by Graham McNeill, Dark Heart by Anthony Reynolds, The Traveller by David Annandale, A Deeper Darkness by Rob Sanders, The Underworld War by Aaron Dembski-Bowden and Unmarked by Dan Abnett. 26\\\\. Vulkan Lives: Unto the Anvil Vulkan Lives is the first book where the story of Vulkan is shown with a significant background. His memories coming back to him after his capture by his brother Konrad Curze aboard his ship modified by Perturabo himself. He learns more about his immortality, which seems to be a gift and a curse, one he preferred not to bear at all. The book adds more background concerning the battle at Istvaan V, at the same time showing the drama of a squad of his surviving sons and the shattered legions while they fight to retrieve an unknown artifact that will change the course of history in the coming days of the rebellion. 27\\\\. The Unremembered Empire: A light in the darkness Unremembered Empire happens after the events of the Battle of Phall, the Lion's capture of Konrad Curze, the return of Guilliman to Maccragge after the battle for Armatura and the Blood Angels trial at the battle for Signus Prime. An ancient device has been found on Sotha, one which could guide the mighty warships out of the impenetrable veil that cut off Ultramar from the rest of the Imperium. Strange events start to happen after the arrival of members of the Cabal organization; a Word Bearer Legionnaire seeking redemption for his Legion and the Night Lords' Primarch begin their search for an unknown \\"object\\" that fell from orbit straight to the hands of Guilliman. Secrecy between him and the Lion might bring undesired conflict between the brothers in this time of treachery, while Sanguinius manage to come back from his trial on Signus Cluster to learn from Guilliman's plan for a new Empire. 28\\\\.

Old Earth: To the Gates of Terra Old Earth tells the story of the newly resurrected Vulkan, who is compelled to leave his homeworld and his legion behind and return to fulfill his destiny at Terra.

Outside the UK, series titles are published in several countries and languages by Black Library divisions or as co-editions with local associates. , other-language renditions lagged the English-language series in the number of released titles, and had followed distinct publication schedules and release sequences. Also , editions in other languages were published in paperback and e‚Äëbook formats. Starting November 2010, new titles have often been released simultaneously in multiple media; occasionally since then, new titles' digital or audio releases have preceded the print versions, in reverse of previous practice (see table \\"Published\\" above). Stories in series compilations have also been published individually, as e‚Äëbooks, and as MP3 or CD \\"audio shorts\\". Series stories have appeared in whole or in part in other Black Library publications, sometimes before the corresponding series books have become generally available; prepublications have included stand-alone releases of compilation stories. \\"Prerelease\\" copies of series volumes have been regularly offered months before official publication, in Games Workshop- and Black Library‚Äësponsored events such as the various Games Days. There have been a number of special editions and bundles published in a variety of media; bundles have included the \\"Horus Heresy Collections\\", which mix editions and media of the same or different titles. Certain special editions are available in limited distribution months before the release of the corresponding regular, or wider-release, versions.

One of several series bundles, this was offered as a November 2011 Reception Several novels in The Horus Heresy series have appeared in UK and US science fiction charts, have occupied high positions in Nielsen BookScan genre lists, and since early 2010 have often charted in The New York Times Bestseller List for mass-market paperbacks. Critical reception of individual titles has been mixed, yet the general tone of reviews has been mostly positive. Although the series overall has been viewed favourably, there have been complaints about its length, the multitude of characters and narrative threads, and the timeline jumps or repetitions caused by the nonlinear storytelling. The evolving series is said to have gradually acquired a backstory and terminology of its own; this has led reviewers to question the accessibility of individual stories to new or casual readers. '''''' Early in its publishing history, the series became a sales success in its category. Horus Rising by Dan Abnett, the opening title, set the pace shortly after its release, topping Locus magazine's \\"Locus Bestsellers: Gaming-Related\\" list of August 2006; practically every title in the series had achieved the same or similar performance on this chart. Horus Risings January 2011 CD audiobook release also appeared in ranked sales lists: the (abridged) edition was number 15 in a related chart published by The Bookseller, covering 2011 UK sales up to September. Legion by Abnett, and Battle for the Abyss by Ben Counter, were listed in Nielsen BookScan's list of top‚Äë20 fictional works by small publishers for the year ending 23 August 2008; the books appeared in eighth and sixteenth place respectively. The next published title, Mechanicum by Graham McNeill, entered The Booksellers \\"Top 20 Fiction Heatseekers\\" chart of 5 December 2008, shortly after its release, at number 10; series titles have consistently appeared in this list. A Thousand Sons by McNeill was released in February 2010 and arrived at number 22 on The New York Times Bestseller List, the first ever novel on the Black Library imprint to do so. Nemesis by James Swallow followed, reaching number 26 on the List in August 2010. The First Heretic, by Aaron Dembski‚ÄëBowden, reached number 28 in the weekly chart in November 2010 and stayed on the List for a second week, at number 33\\\\. Abnett's Prospero Burns was next, reaching number 16 in January 2011; this title also topped a science fiction and fantasy book chart published by The Times (London) in March of the same year. The compilation Age of Darkness, edited by Christian Dunn, also entered The New York Times Best Sellers List, in May 2011, at number 31\\\\. Book 19, Know No Fear, again by Abnett, continued the trend: it appeared at number 21 in March 2012. It was followed on the List by the next series title, The Primarchs, a compilation edited by Dunn, which occupied position 29 during the week of 17 June 2012; in addition, The Primarchs had placed first in Publishers Weekly science fiction bestsellers listing for the week of 28 May 2012. In September 2012 Fear to Tread by Swallow entered The New York Times Best Sellers List at number 13, at the time the highest entry on that chart for a series novel; the book remained on the List the week after (week of September 23), at number 33\\\\. Related works Between the late‚Äì1980s introduction of the Horus Heresy and the start of this series publication in 2006, Games Workshop and affiliates released -branded products that expanded the concept's standing as Warhammer 40,000 background material. The release of such works, which include literature independent of this series, continued ; the works may relate to it as prequels, sequels, or expansions of its stories. Pre-series Horus Heresy literature and other related works may have been superseded or rendered obsolete, while other similar material may no longer be authoritative even as it remains in Horus Heresy and Warhammer 40,000 canons; still other non-series Horus Heresy material has been eventually incorporated into the work. A significant development was the 2012 initial release of the Horus Heresy miniatures wargame expansion, which repositioned the concept as a foreground element within the Warhammer 40,000 gaming system while highlighting the importance of the Horus Heresy to Games Workshop's product lineup and the related universe. The expansion is reputedly developed in coordination with the book series, and includes new material and information about the Horus Heresy and the fictional universe; it joins the series and other works as an authoritative source of Heresy material and Warhammer 40,000 background. The Black Library and Games Workshop have released novels, game rulebooks, and other products not branded or classified as Horus Heresy, yet directly relating to story arcs or events described in the series.

Career Burgess took up archery in 1998 and made her international debut in 2001. As a teenager Burgess was widely regarded as an upcoming star of British archery, narrowly missing out on qualifying for a spot at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, aged just 17. In 2007 Burgess won a bronze medal for Great Britain with Alison Williamson and Naomi Folkard in the women's team event at the 2007 World Archery Championships, defeating the Italian team in the bronze medal match following a defeat to South Korea in the semi-final. Later that year Burgess, Williamson and Folkard were medallists at the fourth stage of the 2007 Archery World Cup held in Dover, winning the women's team recurve tournament. This was however not enough for Great Britain to advance to the final. Burgess, Folkard and Williamson improved on their medal tally in the 2008 Archery World Cup, winning a gold medal in the team competition in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, in April, and a bronze medal in the same event in Bo√©, France, two months later. 2008 Summer Olympics Burgess qualified to represent Great Britain at the 2008 Olympics, competing in the team and individual events. Once again partnered by Alison Williamson and Naomi Folkard, she helped Great Britain achieve a surprise second place in the team ranking round. In the quarter-finals the trio overcame the Japanese team by five points to meet hosts China in the semi-finals. Burgess and her teammates were unable to defeat the Chinese team, missing the opportunity to compete for the gold medal. They instead faced France in the bronze medal match, but lost to their French opponents, having to settle for fourth place overall. In the individual event Burgess placed 40th out of 64 archers in the ranking round. She defeated China's Guo Dan in the first round before falling to teammate Folkard in the second round. Post-Olympics Burgess narrowly missed out on qualifying for the 2012 Summer Olympics held in London; she did however claim a gold medal alongside Michael Peart at the European Grand Prix in Cyprus in the mixed team recurve competition. In 2015 it was announced that Burgess had joined Team GB's paralympic team as performance coach for the recurve archery athletes. In 2017, Burgess also became the Lead Coach in the training and development of archers for the UK Invictus Games Team. Later the same year, she attended the 2017 Invictus Games within the role of Head Coach for Archery. Burgess continued in the Lead Coach role in 2018. Personal life On 11 January 2008 Burgess and her boyfriend - fellow archer Roy Nash - were attacked by a group of teenagers outside an indoor archery range in Cheadle, near Stockport, Great Manchester. They were treated for their injuries at Stepping Hill hospital, both suffering bruising to the face.

It was located on the East Coast Main Line. As well as a railway station for passengers, it was also the main service yard and goods yard between Newcastle upon Tyne and Edinburgh. Also Tweedmouth station was the terminus for the Tweed Valley Railway line (opened in 1849), which connected the East Coast Main Line with the Waverley Line at Newtown St. Boswells. The station lies to the south of the Royal Border Bridge. It was opened on 29 March 1847 and initially was the terminus on the East Coast Main Line as the Royal Border Bridge was not yet complete, so trains could not pass over the River Tweed. Once the Royal Border Bridge had been completed in 1850 and opened by Queen Victoria, trains had an unbroken run from London to Edinburgh. The station was designed (like all the other Newcastle and Berwick Railway ones) by Benjamin Green, but was considerably more ornate - costing over ¬£8600 to construct (due to company chairman George Hudson's insistence that it be as ornate as the North British Railway's depot on the other side of the River Tweed). The main single-storey building was on the southbound side, with a two-storey hotel and refreshment room attached to it at its northern end. Behind this were the two active platforms, which were served by loops off the main running lines. A substantial goods shed was also built, along with a four track locomotive depot in 1850. Despite this, its proximity to the main Berwick station (which was barely a mile (1.6 km) to the north) meant that it remained little more than a wayside halt for mainline local trains and the Kelso branch throughout its lifetime. However it was considerably more important in operational terms for the NER, who used it as a major goods traffic hub and locomotive stabling and maintenance facility; they expanded the original loco depot significantly in 1877/8 and added a goods warehouse and accompanying sidings in 1902/3. After the 1923 Grouping, the London and North Eastern Railway concentrated all of its shed provision there, closing the old North British depot at Berwick station as part of the rebuild there in 1927. After nationalisation in 1948, usage of the station gradually declined; by 1960, only a single train to and from Newcastle called each weekday, along with two in each direction on the Kelso and Newtown St Boswells branch line. British Railways closed the station to passengers on 15 June 1964 (along with the Kelso branch),Kelso Railway station history Welcome to Kelso website; Accessed 21 November 2008 a victim of the Beeching Axe.

Biography Roman attended New Jersey City University earning a bachelor's degree in elementary education and a master's degree in urban education. She worked as a teacher and supervisor for the Jersey City Board of Education. Roman became involved in politics as a member of the Everett Terrace Block Association where she served as a representative attending City Council Meetings.

Roman was director of the Education-Business Alliance of the Jersey City Board of Education and president of the City Council when McCann was removed from office following his conviction on Federal fraud charges. Roman continued to fill the vacancy when the city council failed to elect another candidate after 30 days. Roman served as mayor for four months until the city council reorganized and selected a new Council President. Following the announced retirement of Congressman Frank J. Guarini, Roman organized and supported a slate of candidates in the 1992 Democratic Primary. She claimed to organize the ticket to support candidates for the Democratic County Committee farther down the ballot. Roman's candidates were opposed by a slate headed by State Senator Robert Menendez and supported by Hudson County Executive Robert C. Janiszewski. Menendez defeated Robert P. Haney by a ratio of 2-1, and Roman's candidates for Democratic County Committee only won one-third of the seats. The City Council of Jersey City reorganized on July 1, 1992 and selected Joseph Rakowski as the new president. Rakowski also became acting mayor and the third mayor in that year.

Confederate Maj. Gen. Wade Hampton led a force of 3,000 troopers of the Confederate States Army on what was to become a ride to acquire cattle that were intended for consumption by the Union Army, which was laying a combined siege to the cities of Richmond and Petersburg, Virginia. Background Always lacking in supplies, the Confederate forces that were defending the capital of Richmond were beginning to run out of food. A report by General Robert E. Lee on August 22, 1864, stated that corn to feed the Southern soldiers was exhausted.Bakeless, John. Spies of the Confederacy (Courier Dover Publications, 1997) p. 342. A scout, Sergeant George D. Shadburne, informed General Hampton on September 5 that there were 3,000 lightly defended cattle behind Union lines, at Edmund Ruffin's plantation on Coggin's Point, down the James River from Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's headquarters. Believing the cattle were defended by only 120 Union soldiers and 30 civilians (the actual force was larger, but still less than 500), Hampton arranged for 3,000 Confederate troops to follow him. These men included \\"several certified Texas cattle thieves\\".Ackerman, Robert. Wade Hampton III (University of South Carolina Press, 2007), p. 67.Cattle (Beefsteak) Raid Waymarking.comWade Hampton and the Great Beefsteak Raid Lt. Gen. Wade Hampton Camp No. 273, Sons of Confederate Veterans Raid On September 14, 1864, Hampton led his men to the south of Petersburg and the Union trenches, in order to eventually turn north behind Union lines. He chose to cross where the Cook's Bridge over the Blackwater River once stood, knowing that an attack from there would be unexpected. He had some engineers reconstruct the bridge. At 5 a.m. on September 16, Hampton's force attacked with a three-prong strike, with the center directed toward the cattle. Hampton's force captured more than 2,000 cattle, along with 11 wagons and 304 prisoners, leading them back to the Confederate lines at 9 a.m. on September 17. Aftermath The total losses for the Confederates, who saw some opposition, were 10 killed, 47 wounded, and 4 missing. The official count of cattle successfully reaching the Confederates for food was 2,468.Ackerman p. 68; Wade Hampton and the Great Beefsteak Raid Lt. Gen. Wade Hampton Camp No. 273, Sons of Confederate Veterans Despite the raid's success, its strategic impact was not as great as the large number of cattle taken might seem to indicate. For whereas the Union had the resources to replace its lost cattle, the Confederates lacked hay or grain to spare for feed. They were therefore forced to slaughter the cattle almost as soon as they had secured them. The ensuing \\"feast\\" on the Confederate side might be better described as a rush to consume the beef before it spoiled. For days afterwards, the southerners would taunt the northern sentries, thanking them for all the food and inviting them over for dinner. There was so much beef available that Confederate sentries would sometimes offer it in unauthorized trades with Union sentries for certain luxury items of which the Federal soldiers had a plentiful supply, but the Confederates lacked. After the beef was eaten or spoiled, the Confederates reverted to their previous, dire food situation. Abraham Lincoln called the raid \\"the slickest piece of cattle- stealing\\" he ever heard of.Ackerman, p. 68. General Lee's adjutant, Lt. Col. Walter H. Taylor, said it made up for disruption of Confederate supply lines caused by the loss of the Weldon Railroad, a claim most historians consider to be overstated.Taylor, Walter.

The forest lies between the villages of Seliana, Perithori, Sarantapikho and Zarouchla and it is the largest forest of Achaea consisting mainly of black pine trees, firs and chestnuts. Seliana is surrounded by lush vegetation, old Platanus trees, walnuts, hazelnuts, plums, peaches, and many springs and you can hear the rushes of the running water all year round.

The explosions occurred at the Sunrise Propane Industrial Gases propane facility, located near Keele Street and Wilson Avenue around 03:50 ET. The blasts caused thousands of people to be evacuated from their homes and cost C$1.8 million to clean up, half of which was paid by the province of Ontario. An employee of Sunrise died in the initial explosions and a firefighter died of cardiac arrest the next day while at the scene.  History  Sunrise Propane Industrial Gases was a company that sold propane for commercial and home purposes, in addition to other gases such as helium and acetylene. The company had operated under a number of names since at least 1999. In 2002, a company named Sunrise Petroleum was successfully sued by First Choice Petroleum Inc., an oil and lubricants supplier, who claimed the company owed them C$54,063.73 in products and had forged a document to avoid settling their account. In that case, it was found that Sunrise had forged the signature of a First Choice employee named Thomas Tims in a 1999 document, which stated Sunrise Petroleum would be taken over by a new company called Sunrise Petroleum Lubricants and that Sunrise Petroleum would thereby not be responsible for any outstanding, unpaid, or unsettled accounts. However, Tims would not have signed the document because he was listed on it as \\"Tim Toms\\", rather than Tom Tims. As a result of the case, Sunrise was forced to pay the account owed plus interest, totalling C$93,389.54, and an additional C$34,284.71 in legal fees. Court documents also revealed a third name, Sunrise Propane & Petroleum, that the company had previously used. An Ontario corporate profile states the facility was incorporated in 2004, though a Sunrise corporate solicitor and spokesperson is uncertain how long the facility was in operation. The facility was built in a residential neighbourhood in Toronto's North York district. Toronto mayor David Miller stated that the facility was allowed to be built in the neighbourhood under zoning that was in place for over a decade. The facility had previously been warned by Ontario's Technical Standards and Safety Authority for its lack of safety by not ceasing to conduct truck-to-truck transfers at the company's facilities. During the investigation following the explosions, investigators found that truck-to-truck transfers were common at the facility. Truck-to- truck transfers are prohibited in Ontario because they increase the risk of a gas leak or a fire.  Incident  The explosion seen from the Keele overpass At approximately 03:50 ET on the morning of August 10, 2008, a large explosion occurred at Sunrise Propane Industrial Gases, located near Murray Road and Spalding Road. This was followed by a series of explosions that sent large fireballs and clouds of smoke billowing into the sky. Large pieces of metal from the exploding propane tanks were ejected onto nearby streets and properties. Many homes and offices were damaged, windows were shattered, and doors were ripped from their hinges. About 200 firefighters battled the seven- alarm fire that resulted from the explosions. The threat of further blasts and concerns about the air quality forced the police to conduct a voluntary evacuation of a large area in the surrounding community. Residents living within a radius were told to leave their homes in the early hours of the morning. Toronto Transit Commission buses were used to evacuate them to Downsview Park and then to York University. The explosions rocked the area and also caused the closure of part of Highway 401, between highways 404 and 400, for over 12 hours. Emergency crews feared another major explosion as two rail tankers continued to burn more than five hours after the initial explosion. Regular commercial air traffic was allowed to continue in and out of Pearson International Airport while smaller, privately owned aircraft were restricted from flying over the area. Six people were sent to the hospital, 18 people admitted themselves to emergency clinics, and Emergency Medical Services treated 40 people on the site. During the course of the emergency response to the scene, a Toronto firefighter was found lifeless by emergency crews. Paramedics and firefighters tried to revive him but were unsuccessful. He was then rushed to a hospital where he was pronounced dead. The firefighter was identified as Bob Leek, a 55-year-old district chief of emergency planning and a 25-year veteran. Leek, who was off duty that night, had been asked to bring some equipment to aid the activities of his colleagues, which he gladly did. He just happened to have had a heart attack at that time. Sunrise employee Parminder Saini was unaccounted for. On August 11, a body was found at the scene. On September 3, the body was confirmed to be that of Saini.  Cause and investigation  The Ontario Fire Marshal's Office handled the investigation of the explosions. While the cause of the explosions had not yet been determined, on August 21, 2008, Ontario's independent safety regulator for fuels, the Technical Standards and Safety Authority (TSSA), released a statement saying that, just before the explosion, a truck driver was illegally transferring propane from one truck to another. The agency also reported that, in November 2006, Sunrise Propane was warned about its lack of safety from not stopping the truck-to-truck transfers at the company's facilities, and that truck-to-truck transfers were a frequent and routine operating practice at the facility. An investigator with the Ontario Fire Marshal's Office stated that it could take months before the cause of the explosions could be determined. Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty also said that the province was willing to provide financial aid to residents whose homes were damaged by the explosions. On August 4, 2010, the Toronto Star reported that the massive Sunrise propane explosion in 2008 was caused by an illegal \\"tank-to-tank transfer\\" along with a gas hose leak. The report said that liquid propane was released from a hose after a \\"tank-to-tank transfer\\" was completed. The Star reports that Sunrise did not have the right licence to perform those types of transfers and that it was previously barred from doing so by the TSSA in November 2006. The Environment Ministry has argued that Sunrise failed \\"to show that there was a proper preventative maintenance system in place.\\" Leo Adler, Sunrise's lawyer, argued that the event was an unforeseeable accident because Sunrise kept their equipment in good order and cannot be held responsible for a hose failure.\\"Leo Adler in the Media\\"  Aftermath  Highway 401 was closed due to its proximity to the explosion. Due to its proximity to the site, Highway 401 was shut down from Highway 404 to Highway 400, and the local Yorkdale Mall was closed for part of the day. Toronto Transit Commission routes and the York Region Transit Viva Orange route were affected as a result of evacuation zone. Bus routes were diverted and a section of the Yonge-University-Spadina subway line between Downsview Station and Lawrence West Station was shut down for part of the day. GO Transit services to Yorkdale Bus Terminal were also suspended. About 15 hours after the first explosions, some residents were given the go-ahead to return to their homes. However, many people returning to their homes were stopped at police checkpoints and turned back, or not permitted to take their vehicles into the immediate area. Approximately 100 of the 12,000 evacuated homes were left uninhabitable. On August 11, almost all residents who had to be evacuated were allowed back, though about 35 families had to wait while tests by health officials were conducted over concerns about airborne asbestos. As a result of the explosion, Toronto officials planned to review all industrial areas that could pose a potential threat to residential neighbourhoods to prevent similar situations. As part of its investigation, TSSA officials and the Ontario Fire Marshal reviewed past inspections of the facility to determine the cause of the explosions. The explosion caused damage to one of Toronto's oldest Jewish cemeteries, the Mount Sinai Memorial Park. The cemetery is over 100 years old and has more than 11,000 graves, of which at least 20 were damaged. Various residents were angered because the municipal government allowed Sunrise to build a propane facility in a residential area. Some residents claimed the community was not consulted or notified about the facility when it was being built. However, Shelley Carroll, Toronto's acting deputy mayor, suggested that the facility had been zoned before many of the homes were built. The TSSA, which regulates fuel safety in Ontario, originally said it had only inspected Sunrise once since the facility opened in 2005. TSSA later contradicted this by stating it had issued stop-work orders in 2006 and 2007 over safety violations. On August 19, nine days after the explosions, Sunrise issued a short news release, stating that the company regretted the loss of life and that they were co-operating with authorities' investigations. The news release also said that they would not be making any more public comments in the near future to prevent speculation and misinformation. On August 21, 2008, the TSSA issued a notice that Sunrise Propane should immediately have its authorization revoked. Six other propane facilities in the province were shut down as a result of an audit prompted by the explosions. Facilities in Kitchener, Waterloo, Cornwall, Ottawa, and two in Toronto were ordered to shut down after failing to show that their employees had been properly trained at the facilities. Parminder Saini's father was granted a visa to travel from Punjab to Canada to aid in the investigation, but his brother and mother were initially denied visas by the Canadian Consulate. This decision was later changed after the Department of Citizenship and Immigration was informed of the situation. Felipe De Leon, an employee at Sunrise, stated that he had completed an illegal propane transfer when he noticed smoke at the north end of the facility. De Leon said he then went inside the facility's office to warn Saini to flee the building, who however refused. De Leon then fled from the facility while Saini walked towards the smoke. Cleaning up cost the city of Toronto C$1.8 million, half of which was paid by the province of Ontario.  Charges and lawsuits  On August 5, 2009, the Ontario Ministry of Labour laid two charges in the incident: one relating to the failure to protect Saini and another alleging failure to operate within mandatory industry standards. These had potential fines totalling up to C$1 million.Police charge Sunrise Propane after last year's deadly explosion www.cp24.com, published August 5, 2009 Eight charges by the Ontario Ministry of the Environment carried potential fines of more than C$6 million.

Primary contributions have been (a) liturgical compositions for the Passover Haggadah and Sabbath prayer service, (b) translations into English as well as the setting to music of several internationally acclaimed Yiddish poets, (c) an (ongoing) project to write an etymological dictionary of Yiddish, and (d) proprietor of the second branch of Hyman's Book and Art Shoppe. Early life Gurion Joseph Hyman was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and lived above his parents‚Äô bookstore on Spadina Avenue, Hyman's Book and Art Shoppe, until marrying Ruth Alice Warner in 1952. The son of prominent Jewish community activists, Ben Zion Hyman and Fannie Konstantynowski (a descendant of Rabbi Shabbatai ha-Kohen), Gurion Hyman graduated from the Pharmacy program at the University of Toronto in 1946. During his early years, Gurion Hyman was exposed to multiple languages and developed fluency or significant proficiency in English, Yiddish, Hebrew, Russian and Polish. At the same time, he received formal piano training.  Death  Gurion Hyman died of old age on December 2, 2017, in Toronto, Ontario, at home, surrounded by members of his family. He had been married for more 65 years, and leaves 3 children and 10 grandchildren. Career highlights After graduating in Pharmacy, Hyman worked for a time as a dispensing pharmacist, most notably at Halpren Drugs on Spadina Avenue in Toronto. In 1952, Hyman, along with his wife, Ruth, opened a branch of the family bookstore business on Eglinton Avenue in the Cedarvale/Forest Hill area of Toronto. In 1962, the couple sold the bookstore and Hyman returned to the University of Toronto to pursue a career in Linguistic Anthropology. His primary area of scholarship was the reconstruction of Proto-Semitic, with particular emphasis on demonstrating the relationship between Hebrew and Aramaic using Noam Chomsky's deep structures theory. In 1973, Hyman resumed his career as a dispensing pharmacist, working until 1990 at The Sheppard Pharmacy (owner: Sidney Brown). Sheppard Pharmacy was located at Bathurst Street and Sheppard Avenue in Toronto's North York borough, and through most of the 1980s had the largest volume of senior citizen prescriptions in Canada. Hyman's role was to facilitate communication with the large and linguistically diverse client base of this pharmacy. During this entire period, Hyman pursued an avocation as a composer, primarily of liturgical music, and by 1975 had completed his major work, a complete musical score for the Haggadah of Pesach (Passover), which was eventually published in 1999. A second major liturgical work based on the Sabbath prayer service is due for publication in 2009. In the 1990s, Hyman began working on compositions (and in some cases translations) of the poetry of Yiddish and Hebrew writers. Prominent among those has been Peretz Miransky, Simche Simchovitch, Avraham Sutskever, and Natan Alterman. Two collections have been published to date (see below), and the music has been featured in a number of venues, primarily performed by the Toronto-based Klezmer/Yiddish band De Shpeelers. More recently, Hyman has begun working with Spanish poetry and translating Yiddish poetry to Spanish. He has also completed several translations of Sherlock Holmes into Yiddish. Etymological Dictionary of Yiddish An ongoing project is to produce an Etymological Dictionary of the Yiddish Language using multiple resources to 'best estimate' origin of word (Germanic, Semitic, Slavic, other). An intensive study of the 'word' in the original language is made. After compiling 'all' information available, the material is separated into three sections (a) Dictionary Entry with evolutionary path (b) Cross- referenced to Dictionary of Indo-European Roots and cognates, where applicable (in planning is a similar section for Proto-Semitic roots) (c) A definitional section of Yiddish-English correspondence. Presently completed are words starting with 'aleph-bais', also prelimina ry work on words starting with 'aleph-yod', as well as some with 'shin-aleph'.  Works  *Songs of Joy and Consolation.

Jewish life in Miƒôdzyrzec  Since the 16th century Miƒôdzyrzec was home to a large Jewish community. At the end of the 1930s in the reborn Polish Republic approximately 12,000 inhabitants, or 75% of its population, were Jewish. Architecture The congregation, founded in 1888, originally worshiped in a building on Clinton Street. The building which now houses the synagogue was originally built in 1841 as a 2 1/2-story house for J. B. Murray. Herman Horenburger designed the conversion into a synagogue in 1910. It is similar in style to Congregation Kolbuszower Teitelbaum Cheva Banai at 622 East 5th Street, which was also built in 1910; both have sunburst pediments. pp.7,126 The synagogue is unusual in being a very small, urban congregation on a narrow lot that has an extremely beautiful Neo-Classical facade, and is the last operating \\"tenement synagogue\\" in the East Village.Staff (August 15, 2008) \\"Preservation Alert from the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation: Congregation Mezritch Synagogue\\" Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation Andrew Berman of the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation called it \\"an intact historic gem.\\"Dobnik, Verena (August 14, 2008) \\"Old Manhattan synagogue is in danger of demolition\\" NewsdayFriedlander, David (August 15, 2008) \\"East Village temple may be demolished\\" AM New York Architectural historian and New York University professor Gerald R.

It is absent from Iberia and probably the entire Balkans, and generally ranges southwards only to the northern Mediterranean region; a possibly isolated population occurs in the Caucasus region. Where it occurs, it is usually not rare and may be abundant. The nocturnal adults are attracted to light sources; they are on the wing around June/July or somewhat later, depending on the location.Kimber, Ian (2010): UKMoths - Argyresthia curvella.

As usual for Yponomeutidae, the forewings have a bold black-and-white pattern, which fades easily in museum specimens though. The pattern consists of a thick oblique black line running from the center of the forewings' dorsal margin to somewhat nearer the apex on the costal margin. From the apex, a thinner and often somewhat irregular black band extends to meet the first one. The remaining areas of the forewings are generously sprinkled with small black blotches.

The MLR were active from 1973 until 1979. They had supporters in a few cities but they always remained a small current with fewer than 200 members. The MLR had close contacts with the Chinese Communist Party and other Nordic Maoist parties. The MLR were founded early in 1973 to unite local Maoist groups that had been founded around Finland. The Marxist-Leninist Society of Helsinki (HMLS), the first such group, had been active since the late 1960s. The HMLS (like the whole MLR) was mainly active in the radical youth and student movement. The activities of the Maoists were closely followed by the Suojelupoliisi, the KGB and the Communist Party of Finland (SKP),Kimmo Rentola: Vallankumouksen aave (Otava 2005), pp. 155-157. which fiercely condemned the anti-Soviet movement. The MLR were founded after the SKP began expulsions of Maoist cadre from its ranks. The organization published two papers, theoretical Punakaarti (Red Guard, 1969‚Äì1977) and agitational Lokakuu (October, 1972‚Äì1978). MLR had book shops named Lokakuu in Helsinki, Turku and Rauma.

Jonathan lives in North London. He is a cousin of army officer William Thomas Forshaw and film director Cy Endfield. Education He attended Wath Comprehensive School, The University of Birmingham (where he emerged with a first-class degree), and completed a Ph.D. at The Shakespeare Institute. Career For six years, he taught Drama at Royal Holloway, University of London, leaving as a Senior Lecturer in 2007. During his time there, he wrote two books: Merely Players (about the rhetoric of classical acting) and Refiguring Mimesis (with Adrian Streete, about aesthetics). He also set up a new degree programme in Drama and English. During this first career, he became an expert in the work of John Donne, and organised the first live performance for four centuries of several of Donne‚Äôs songs at St. Paul‚Äôs Cathedral, in 2005. Performers included Dame Emma Kirkby, Carolyn Sampson and The Sixteen. The event sold out, and the proceeds were donated to the charity Peace Direct. In 2011, he also wrote and directed Into Thy Hands, a biographical play on Donne. In 2007, he wrote, directed and produced the play Fallujah, starring Harriet Walter, Imogen Stubbs and Ir√®ne Jacob. It ran in a specially tailored space on Brick Lane, with a score by Nitin Sawhney, and design by the conceptual artist Lucy Orta. At the time, it was the only significant account of the sieges of Fallujah, and is composed entirely of verbatim testimony. In 2008, he collaborated with the choir and period instrument orchestra The Sixteen and actors Alan Howard and Virginia McKenna in a series of concerts at the South Bank Centre. He has also written and directed two short films starring Rebecca Lenkiewicz, Elliot Cowan and Julian Ovenden, and is nearing completion on a feature documentary, Perpetual Peace. This last includes interviews with peacemakers around the world and features contributions by Harold Pinter, John Berger, Karen Armstrong, George Monbiot, Tony Benn and Noreena Hertz, among others. In 2008, he set up The Jericho House, a movable performance venue specialising in cross-media collaborations around the theme of hospitality. The Jericho House is groundbreaking in its use of sound and music, leading Holmes to set up a partnership with The Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience examining the effect of sound on the brain. In 2009, Jericho produced a critically acclaimed site-specific testimony play about the neglect of New Orleans after the hurricane. It was called simply 'Katrina,‚Äô and the run sold out completely. In 2010, Holmes began a campaign for continuing state support for the arts with an event called ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs the point of art?‚Äô attended by many influential people from the creative industries. The resulting public debate led to all three main parties committing to maintaining arts funding at 2009 levels at the next spending round.

Morgan was the first Indigenous Australian to be selected to play in a recognised rugby league Test match. He primarily played on the wing. Rugby League career A New South Wales' Schoolboy representative player, Morgan moved from Tweed Heads to play for Wynnum-Manly in the Brisbane Rugby League premiership. In 1960 he was selected for the second and third Tests of the French tour of Australia. He scored two tries on his international debut. At the end of the 1960 season, he played one match for Australia in the 1960 World Cup, again against France, at Wigan. Morgan's selection for the Tests made him the first Indigenous Australian to represent at an international level in any major national sporting team. In 1962 he was named Queensland's Best Back. A representative of Brisbane in the Bulimba Cup, Morgan scored 24 tries and 147 points in just 18 games between 1959 and 1963. In 1962, he scored 5 tries and 6 goals in a single match against Ipswich. Morgan was subjected to racism throughout his career. He has described an incident in a match against Ipswich. \\"I was tackled over the sideline, and apparently the whole Ipswich team jumped on top of me,\\" he said. \\"I woke up in hospital.\\" In another incident he was hospitalised after being punched by a spectator.

Forewings are white, with golden or brown markings, while hind wings are grey. Legs and antennae are white. They fly in a single generation from May to August, depending on location. Biology Eggs are laid on willows and the larvae overwinter in leaf-buds until April when they bore into a shoot, causing it to droop. They can also feed on catkins. When full grown in May or June the larvae are 11 mm long with a green body and dark-brown to black head, prothoracic and anal shields. Pupation takes place either in the feeding place or on the ground in May or June.

It was published in 1921 in Kagans Neueste Schachnachrichten. It demonstrates how a king can make multiple threats and how it can take more than one path to a given location, using the same number of moves. It is covered in many books on the endgame (see chess endgame literature). The procedure is known as the \\"R√©ti Maneuver\\" or \\"R√©ti's Idea\\" , , . Endgame composer Abram Gurvich called the theme \\"The Hunt of Two Hares\\" and it appears in many other studies and games . It is also called \\"chasing two birds at once\\" . The study White is to move and draw in this position. At first inspection, it appears that White has no hope in drawing. His king is well outside the \\"square\\" of the black pawn (see king and pawn versus king endgame) and the king is a long way from supporting his own pawn. However, White can draw by making king moves that have dual purposes. One goal is getting in the square of the black pawn, so it can be intercepted, and the other is getting to the d6-square to support the promotion of his pawn. The black king will have to spend two tempi to stop the white pawn from promoting, and this is the number of tempi the white king needs to gain in order to get into the square of the black pawn. The second diagram shows the number of ways that the white king can get to various squares in the minimum number of moves. There are nine ways to get to d6, but only one of them allows him to get into the square of the black pawn. The solution is for the white king to follow the path on the diagonal marked by \\"1\\" and then follow the dots to intercept the black pawn (if necessary): :1. Kg7 h4 1...Kb6 transposes. :2. Kf6 Kb6 Black has to spend a tempo on preventing the white king from reaching his pawn. If 2...h3 then 3.Ke7 h2 4.c7 Kb7 5.Kd7 and both pawns promote, with a drawn position. :3. Ke5! Kxc6 Black has to spend another tempo to the pawn, to prevent the white king from protecting it. If 3...h3 then 4.Kd6 h2 5.c7 h1=Q 6.c8=Q, draw . Now the white king has gained enough tempi to get in the square of the black pawn and intercept it. :4. Kf4 Draw, since the white king can stop the pawn from promoting (e.g. 4...h3 5.Kg3 h2 6.Kxh2) . Another study with the same idea R√©ti used the same idea in another study. The solution is: : 1. Kg6 Kb6 : 2. Kxg7 f5 : 3. Kf6! f4 : 4. Ke5 f3 : 5. Kd6 f2 : 6. c7 f1=Q : 7. c8=Q Qf4+ : 8. Kd5 Examples from games Yates versus Marshall In this game between Frederick Yates and Frank Marshall, Black draws using the same idea: :60... Kb2! If 60...Kc2 61.f4 wins. :61.

In essence, this method is used to find the value of a unit from the value of a multiple, and hence the value of a multiple. Examples For example, to solve the problem: \\"A man walks 7 miles in 2 hours. How far does he walk in 7 hours?\\", one would first calculate how far the man walks in 1 hour. One can safely assume that he would walk half the distance in half the time. Therefore, dividing by 2, the man walks 3.5 miles in 1 hour. Multiplying by 7 for 7 hours, the man walks 7x3.5=24.5 miles, or consider the distance traveled by the man be X, then divide it given distance that is 7 (x/7). It is equal to the time taken to travel X distance that is 7 hours divided by the time taken to travel 7 miles, that is 2 hours (7/2), therefore x/7=7/2, hence X=24.5 miles. The same method can be applied to the problem: \\"A man walks at 4 miles per hour. How long would it take him to cover 5 miles?\\". Dividing by 4 shows that the man covers 1 mile in a quarter (0.25) of an hour. Multiplying by 5 shows that the man, therefore, takes 1 hour and a quarter (1.25 hours) to cover 5 miles. Similarly, by the second method, we can find the value of time taken to cover 5 miles. The first method is preferable and easier.

He has spent the past ten seasons playing for different clubs in Denmark. False name and birth date Emannuel Ake entered Europe with a temporarily visa because of the fact he had to play a testmatch in the Netherlands. When this turned out wrong for him, he left the Netherlands all of a sudden to go to his father in Denmark without a regular Visa. When Ake first came to Denmark in 2000, he identified himself as \\"Ali Rajab Akida\\", or just \\"Ali Akida\\", born 20 December 1982. It was later discovered that the information was incorrect and that his real name was Emmanuel Ake Richard Muttendango, born 11 June 1980. Ake was subsequently fined 7,000 DKK by the Gladsaxe City Court. After a number of rulings and subsequent appeals from the involved parties, the Sports Confederation of Denmark (DIF) suspended Ake for three months. Ake's club at the time, Akademisk Boldklub, was also awarded a 50,000 DKK fine, and all the points AB's first and reserve teams had collected in matches in which Ake had participated were lost. Club career  Early career Ake's mother is from Kenya, and his father from Seychelles. His parents divorced and his father moved to Denmark. He started his senior career with Black Panther in the Coast Provincial League (3rd level in Kenya). He then moved to Mombasa- based Coast Stars in the Kenyan Premier League. A Dutch tourist and his son met his mother in Kenya and found out about his football-skills. In Kenya he wouldn't be able to get a living out of playing football. The Dutchman tried to give him a future and arranged a temporarily visa for Ake and invited him over to the Netherlands, to stay with them and to play a test match with FC Oss (second division of the Netherlands) (team formerly known as TOP Oss). After the unsuccessful trials he left the guest-family and travelled to his father in Denmark.Daily Nation, 10 January 2004: Mulee's best 22 for Tunisia Denmark As a 20-year-old, Ake was signed by Akademisk Boldklub, where he spent four seasons from 2000 to 2004. He then moved to FC Nordsj√¶lland for the 2004‚Äì05 and 2005‚Äì06 seasons. Ake was loaned out by FC Nordsj√¶lland for the second half of the 2005‚Äì06 season to √òlstykke FC. He was the club's top scorer with 14 goals. In the next seasons, Ake was loaned to second-division side Holb√¶k B&I;, where he also emerged as the club's top scorer with 11 goals. In the 2007‚Äì08 season, Ake was on loan, this time to First Division side Hellerup IK (HIK). He scored 13 league goals, tops on the club, but the team was still relegated to Division 2. Ake then signed a three-year contract with Herf√∏lge Boldklub. He joined the club after he was declared a free agent by FC Nordsj√¶lland. HB K√∏ge Ake was a part of the new HB K√∏ge team, founded in 2009 after a merger between Herf√∏lge and K√∏ge Boldklub. The new season started very well for Ake, who scored five goals in 13 league matches. However, he was severely injured in November 2009, rupturing his achilles tendon. Ake inspired a lot of people at HB Koge including the well known Will Holmes. Lyngby BK In September 2010 he signed with Lyngby Boldklub. N√¶stved BK In February 2011 he signed an amateur contract with N√¶stved Boldklub. He left the club in the summer of 2011. Sveb√∏lle B&I; On 1 February 2012 he agreed to play at Danish 2nd Division club Sveb√∏lle B&I;, because the club was managed by his old team mate from Holb√¶k B&I;, Erdogan Aslan. Unfortunately this story came with a rough ending because of the fact Ake was denied a working permit for Denmark and was forced to leave the country only a month after signing with Sveb√∏lle. FC Djursland In September 2012 he returned to Denmark to play for FC Djursland in Danmarksserien, the fourth tier of the Danish football system. International career Ake was part of the Kenyan National team, the Harambee Stars, at the Tunisia 2004 African Cup of Nations. He made three appearances for the Harambee Stars. He scored the third goal against Burkina Faso, earning Kenya its first-ever win at the Nations Cup.

Gardner is well-known expert and author in the area of PLL's. The first, second, and third editions of his book Phaselock Techniques have been highly influential and remains a well-recognized reference among electrical engineers specializing in areas involving PLL's. In 1980, F. Gardner was elected IEEE Fellow \\"for contributions to the understanding and applications of phase lock loops\\". Garner's conjecture on charge-pump phase-locked loops He has written a remarkable IEEE paper dedicated to the description, the mathematical modelling and the characterization of the widely used Charge- Pump Phase-Locked Loops (see references below). This paper constitutes a major tutorial for scientists and designers who want to discover this very widely used mixed-signal system. In this paper Floyd M. Gardner derived a linear mathematical model of CP-PLL and, based on its analysis, conjectured that transient response of practical charge-pump PLL's can be expected to be nearly the same as the response of the equivalent classical PLL. Gardner's problem on the lock-in range  Floyd M. Gardner introduced a lock-in range concept for PLLs and posed the problem on its formalization (known as the Gardner problem on the lock-in range). In the 1st edition of his book he introduced a lock-in frequency concept for the PLL in the following way: If, for some reason, the frequency difference between input and VCO is less than the loop bandwidth, the loop will lock up almost instantaneously without slipping cycles. The maximum frequency difference for which this fast acquisition is possible is called the lock-in frequency. Later, in the 2nd and 3rd edition of his book, Gardner noted that despite its vague reality, lock-in range is a useful concept and there is no natural way to define exactly any unique lock- in frequency.

The refuge is located in Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana, east central Louisiana. The refuge is named for its most prominent water body, the Lake Ophelia that was at one time a channel of the nearby Red River of the South. Habitat The land surrounding Lake Ophelia was once part of a vast bottomland hardwood forest that stretched along the Mississippi River. Much of this forestland, including large areas of what would become Lake Ophelia National Wildlife Refuge, was cleared for agriculture in the 1970s. Levees have changed the hydrology of the refuge, but the underlying ridge/swale topography supports a variety of habitat types. Bottomland hardwood forest, croplands, fallow fields, moist soil units, and cypress-tupelo brakes are intermixed with meandering bayous, pristine lakes, ponds, sloughs, and the Red River. This variety of vegetative communities in turn supports a diversity of wildlife. Due to its location in east-central Louisiana, the refuge is served by the Mississippi and Central Flyways. Wildlife Lake Ophelia National Wildlife Refuge supports a wide variety of wildlife species. Though established primarily for waterfowl, the refuge also is a place for all or part of the year for mammals, songbirds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians. Many of these animals are difficult to see. Hiding throughout the refuge are creatures great and small such as bobcats, alligators, red and grey fox and wild turkeys. River otter, beaver, raccoon, mink and nutria also make the refuge their home. Other animals that are more frequently seen include white-tailed deer, squirrels, little blue herons, night herons, and barred owls. Many songbirds and wading birds arrive in the spring, and the waters are full of game fish such as channel catfish, largemouth bass and crappie (white perch). Due to its location in east-central Louisiana, this area is influenced by both the Mississippi and Central Flyways. These highways in the sky are the route for millions of duck and geese each spring and fall. Although mallards, gadwall and green-winged teal are the most abundant waterfowl species on the refuge; wood ducks, blue-winged teal, northern shovelers, northern pintails, and widgeon are also plentiful. Diving ducks such as scaup and ring-necked ducks use deeper refuge waters. Canada, snow and white-fronted geese can sometimes be observed feeding in harvested croplands. Although mallards, northern pintails, and wood ducks are the most numerous waterfowl species on the refuge, blue- and green-winged teal, northern shovelers, gadwall, and American Widgeon are also common. Primary diving ducks are scaup and ring-necked ducks. Canada, snow, and greater white-fronted geese are present, though less common. Several hundred native species of mammals, reptiles, amphibians, birds, fishes, and insects are found on the refuge. Common, though often difficult to see, species include bobcats, alligators, red and grey foxes, turkeys, mink, and otter. More frequently encountered are white-tailed deer, raccoons, fox squirrels, beaver, marsh hawks, and wading birds. Many neotropical migratory songbirds use the refuge at various times. Refuge fisheries are composed largely of largemouth bass, gar, crappie, bowfin, bream species, buffalo, carp, and catfish. Endangered species numbers are few and their presence is always marked with special interest. The arctic peregrine falcon is an occasional visitor, and thanks to the refuge's three- year bald eagle reintroduction project, bald eagle sightings are common. The threatened Louisiana black bear is rarely sighted moving through the area, but is expected to reestablish as the Tensas River bear population to the north and the Atchafalaya River population to the south increase. As young bears look for new homes, the refuge and surrounding woodlands can play an important role in its recovery. Not only will this area serve as a corridor linking these two existing bear populations, but also as habitat for additional bears. Two centuries ago the Lower Mississippi River Valley contained over of bottomland hardwood and swamp forests. Today, only of wetland forests remain, most as islands in a sea of agriculture. Gone from Lake Ophelia National Wildlife Refuge are the Florida panther and red wolf, lost forever are the ivory-billed woodpecker and Backman's warbler. Management Lake Ophelia National Wildlife Refuge is actively managed as part of the Central Louisiana Refuges Complex, along with Catahoula National Wildlife Refuge and the Complex headquarters at Grand Cote National Wildlife Refuge, to provide a diverse habitats for the myriad of animal species that abound. Croplands, reforested uplands, bottomland hardwoods, cypress swamps and permanent waters are molded to benefit wildlife. Refuge croplands are farmed on a share basis, leaving part of the crops in the fields for refuge wildlife. Moist soil areas are managed by lowering and raising water levels to promote natural vegetation favored by ducks and geese. During the fall and winter, croplands and naturally vegetated areas are flooded, thus \\"setting the table\\" for wintering waterfowl. In late summer, wetland pools are dried to create mudflats for migrating shorebirds. In efforts to restore large forested block and re-link fragmented forest, several Federal and State natural resource agencies are promoting reforestation of marginal privately owned land and replanting cleared forest on public land. Lake Ophelia National Wildlife Refuge is part of these efforts. Many agricultural fields on the refuge have been planted with hardwood trees that once dominated the land. These native oaks, cypress, ash, gum, and pecan trees will help restore the bottomland hardwood and swamp forests that supported such a large diversity of wildlife.

Introduced in 2005, this payment method allows customers to buy on the Internet using direct online transfers from their bank account. iDEAL remains by far the most popular method for online payments in the Netherlands, well beyond credit card use, and was used for 54% of all Dutch online payments in 2014.http://www.internetkassa.nu/ideal-blijft-creditcard-en-online- achteraf-betalen-ver-voor/ ‚ÄòiDEAL blijft creditcard en online achteraf betalen ver voor‚Äô The service processed 4.5 million transfers in 2006, 15 million transfers in 2007, 28 million transfers in 2008, 45.4 million in 2009, 68.8 million in 2010, 93.8 million in 2011, 117.2 million in 2012, 142.5 million in 2013, 180.2 million in 2014, 222 million in 2015, 282 million in 2016 and In 2019 655 million transactions. iDEAL payments including numbers of transfers iDEAL is owned by the Dutch organization Currence, which also owned PIN and Chipknip. As of April 2016, the total amount of payments exceeded one billion. The participating banks in iDEAL are ABN AMRO, bunq, Friesland Bank, ING Bank, Knab, Rabobank, Triodos Bank, Van Lanschot and De Volksbank. Together they serve the vast majority of the Dutch online banking market.  Process  iDEAL offers merchants a real-time payment method (publicized as low-cost and virtually risk-free) to accept internet payments. For customers, iDEAL uses the same environment as their banks' online banking sites. A high level of security is realized by using two-factor authentication (2FA), such as a challenge-response access token based on the chip embedded in the debit card or ATM card. Furthermore, no sensitive information is being shared with the merchant, such as credit card numbers. There is no chargeback right however, which can be considered a disadvantage for the consumer using this payment method. This is considered an advantage to the merchants. iDEAL works as follows: * Merchant offers iDEAL as payment method * Consumer selects iDEAL and selects their bank * Consumer is redirected to their bank's login page * Participating bank displays transaction data * Customer enters account number and signs the transaction digitally using a 2FA token * Bank authorizes transaction in real-time, deducting the amount directly from the consumer's account (if there is not enough balance, the transaction will be refused) * Merchant received real-time confirmation of the payment by the bank * Consumer is redirected back to the merchant page with a confirmation that the payment has been successful  Criticism  iDEAL payment makes use of the online banking environment of participating banks and therefore makes use of the extensive safety measures of the individual banks. While the transactions themselves are widely considered to be safe, iDEAL transactions could technically be regarded as cash payments between customers and suppliers, to which the bank is no party and offers no insurance. This means that iDEAL payments cannot be reversed when, for example, a webshop fails to deliver.Can I reverse an iDEAL payment? If a user suspects fraud, their only option to get paid money back, is to make a case with their bank, in which the burden of proof lies with the customer and results are unsure. For purchases from untrusted suppliers, other methods of payment can have benefits. Although banks have been joining efforts to limit technical failures of the system, users (especially sellers) have complained about regular down time. In 2014, the average availability of iDEAL was 99.5% for most customer banks, equivalent to 1.8 days of downtime per year.Banken-komen-met-site-die- storingen-ideal-toont  See also  * Payment Service Provider * POLi Payments  References  External links * official website E-commerce in the Netherlands Payment service providers Financial services in the Netherlands ","title":"IDEAL"},{"id":"18797227","text":"USS YAG-9 USS Muskeget (AG-48) ‚Äì originally USS YAG-9 ‚Äì was a former commercial cargo ship acquired by the United States Navy in 1941 for use during World War II.

She was converted at a cost of $250,000 for use as a patrol vessel by the Sullivan Drydock and Repair Corporation of New York City, classified as a \\"miscellaneous district auxiliary\\" (YAG), and commissioned as the patrol vessel USS YAG-9 on 3 January 1942.

U.S. Coast Guard service  On 30 June 1942, the Navy transferred Muskeget to the United States Coast Guard for service as a weather ship. Commissioned into the Coast Guard as USCGC Muskeget (WAG-48) on 1 July 1942, she was assigned Boston, Massachusetts, as her home port and to duty with the North Atlantic Weather Patrol. Meteorologists used weather balloons launched from her deck to gather data on pressure, winds, temperatures, and humidity to support weather forecasts in support of Allied military operations.Ruane, Michael E., \\"Lost at sea during WWII, weathermen to get their Purple Hearts at last,\\" washingtonpost.com, November 18, 2015, 8:07 p.m. EST. Muskeget departed Boston on 6 July 1942 for her first weather patrol, which took place at Weather Station No. 2 in the North Atlantic Ocean off the southern tip of Greenland. She concluded this patrol on 27 July 1942. On 24 August 1942, Muskeget departed Boston for her second weather patrol, under the command of Lieutenant Commander Charles Ernest Toft, 35, of South Portland, Maine,Associated Press, \\"Coast Guard Cutter Believed Lost\\", The San Bernardino Sun, San Bernardino, California, Saturday 10 October 1942, Volume 49, page 1. again at Weather Station No. 2. She issued the first weather report of her patrol on 28 August and arrived on station on 31 August. After she issued a weather report on 9 September 1942, Allied forces did not see or hear from her again. Loss At 14:54 hours on 9 September 1942, the German Navy submarine U-755, operating as part of a wolfpack, sighted Muskeget emerging from a rain squall in a heavy swell about 400 nautical miles (740 km) east of Newfoundland and misidentified her as an auxiliary merchant cruiser. U-755, commanded by Kapit√§nleutnant Walter G√∂ing, fired two torpedoes, heard the sounds of Muskegets boilers exploding and bulkheads collapsing as she sank, then surfaced and found a life raft and survivors in the water, but little wreckage. U-755 departed the area, but returned a few hours later to find a large oil slick and two life rafts tied together with eight men on them. As they shouted at U-755, G√∂ing thought he heard them say that they were from an American ship named Muskogee, Mukited, or something similar. U-755 then again departed the area. Muskeget was due to be relieved on station by the Coast Guard weather ship USCGC Monomoy (WAG-275). Monomoy reported on 11 September 1942 that she could not contact Muskeget, and arrived at Weather Station No. 2 on 13 September 1942 to find no sign of Muskeget. When Monomoy again reported her inability to contact Muskeget on 15 September, Allied ships and aircraft were ordered to search for the missing ship. Their search, on 16 September 1942, found no sign of Muskeget, nor did Monomoy find any trace of Muskeget or her crew while operating at Weather Station No. 2 continuously until 22 September 1942. When Muskeget was overdue in returning to Boston later in September 1942, she was presumed lost with her entire complement of nine officers, 107 enlisted men, one United States Public Health Service officer, and four civilian United States Weather Bureau meteorologists. Monomoy concluded her weather patrol on 1 October 1942 and, upon arrival at Boston on 12 October, reported 20 to 35 German submarines operating within striking range of the weather station, shadowing the two or more Allied convoys which passed through the area in which Weather Station No. 2 was located each day. No bodies were ever recovered, and Muskegets wreck was never found. On 10 September 1943, the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard officially declared all on board Muskeget to have been killed in action, and on 26 October 1943 she was struck from the Navy List. Only later did it become known that U-755 had sunk her. Muskeget was the only U.S. weather ship lost during World War II.

His involvement in pugilistic prizefighting is generally seen to have coincided with a renewed interest in the sport. Although a strong man, his success was largely attributed to his technical abilities and his calm, analytical approach to despatching his opponents. But Johnson was less prudent outside the ring; he was a gambler and considered by many of his acquaintances to be an easy mark. He is thought to have earned more money from the sport than any other fighter until nearly a century later, but much of it was squandered. Johnson's first fight probably took place in June 1783 against Jack Jarvis, after he had unintentionally slighted the wagon driver and professional fighter. Jarvis challenged Johnson to fight him as a matter of honour, and was comprehensively beaten in the resulting match. Johnson's success encouraged him to take up the sport professionally. By June 1784 he had declared himself to be the champion, although whether of England or the world is uncertain. In the later years of his fight career, and for some time after it ended, he acted as a second for other prominent fighters and ran a public house. His dissipation outside the ring appears to have resulted in his decision to leave England for Ireland, where he continued to tutor other boxers but eventually resorted to gambling to earn a living. He died a broken man, both physically and financially. Johnson was inducted into the Pioneer category of the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1995. Life before boxing Tom Johnson was born in Derby, England in about 1750, although Pierce Egan, an early historian of boxing, states that Johnson was born in Yorkshire. His birth name was Thomas Jackling, but he used the name Tom Johnson throughout his fight career. Johnson moved to London at a young age and spent the next twenty years or so working as a corn porter, loading and unloading sacks of corn from a wharf near to Old Swan Stairs, (Upper) Thames Street. His selflessness and strength were exemplified during this period by the assistance that he gave to a fellow worker who had become ill. Johnson would carry two sacks of corn on each journey between the wharf and the grain warehouse, rather than the usual single sack, up an incline so steep that it was known as Labour-in-vain-hill. He gave the extra money he earned to the family of the sick man until he was able to return work. Background to 18th- century prizefighting Prizefighting in early 18th-century England took many forms rather than just pugilism, which was referred to by noted swordsman and then boxing champion James Figg as \\"the noble science of defence\\". But by the middle of the century the term was generally used to denote boxing fights only. The appeal of prizefighting at that time has been compared to that of duelling; historian Adrian Harvey says that: From a legal standpoint prizefights ran the risk of being classified as disorderly assemblies, but in practice the authorities were mainly concerned about the number of criminals congregating there. Historian Bohun Lynch has been quoted as saying that pickpocketing was rife, and that fights between the various supporters were common. However, the patronage of the aristocracy and the wealthy ensured that any legal scrutiny was generally benign, in particular because fights could take place on private estates. This patronage also explains why London was the centre for the sport; people of wealth tended to congregate in the city during the winter months and in the summer dispersed to their country estates. From 1786, just as Johnson was rising to prominence, there was increased support for the sport because of the interest shown in it by the Prince of Wales (later King George IV) and his brothers, the future King William IV and Duke of Kent. This renewed interest followed a period of malaise which had in large part been due to corruption in the form of \\"fixing\\" the fights. Jack Broughton, a celebrated boxing champion (and another who was also a swordsman), had gone some way to defining the rules of prizefighting in 1743, based on earlier work by Figg, but by Johnson's time the rules were still interpreted very loosely. The style of fighting was also very different from modern boxing; the contestants stood facing each other squarely with their feet in line and their fists raised level in front of them, rather than the present-day stance of generally having one foot slightly in front of the other and one fist leading. Brute strength was the primary factor for success and knock-downs were frequent, a consequence of the instability inherent in the positioning of the fighters' feet. Rounds were not timed but instead lasted until a man was knocked down, with fighters permitted to wrestle each other to the ground. Moving around the ring, known as shifting, was deprecated and sometimes explicitly prohibited by the rules for a fight; going to ground without being hit could lead to claims that the man still standing had won. The fighters usually each provided an umpire of their choice, and there might also be a third, independent umpire present, to adjudicate between them. Career as a fighter Early period Tom Johnson fighting Isaac Perrins at Banbury in 1789 Johnson probably began fighting in June 1783, at the age of thirty-three, although Brailsford suggests it was 1781 or slightly earlier. Johnson had unintentionally slighted a carman (horse-drawn wagon driver) and fighter called Jack Jarvis, who then called for Johnson to fight him as a matter of honour. Johnson comprehensively battered the experienced Jarvis at Lock's Fields, and his name came to the attention of professional fighters. At that time Johnson had no intention of earning a living from the sport, but he became so goaded by a professional known as The Croydon Drover that a fight was arranged for March 1784, at Kennington Common. Johnson beat the Drover to a pulp in 27 minutes and decided to become a professional. The success against the Drover was followed by a victory against the ageing professional Stephen \\"Death\\" Oliver in June. The fight, which took place at Blackheath in front of thousands of people, was over in a time stated as being either 18 or 35 minutes. Johnson subsequently declared himself to be the champion and challenged all-comers. Most contemporary and near-contemporary accounts, such as those of Egan, regard this title of champion to mean Champion of England but Barrett O'Hara, writing in 1909, listed Johnson as the fourteenth World Heavyweight Champion. At the time of Johnson's victory, the holder of title of champion was disputed. The previous holder, Duggan Fearns, had disappeared and Harry Sellers, the man Fearns had beaten to win the title in a fight that lasted 90 seconds and was alleged to have been fixed, had died. Johnson did not fight again until he beat Bill Love, a butcher, at Barnet on 11 or 13 January 1786 in a contest that lasted five minutes and offered a prize of 50 guineas. He then beat Jack Towers the following month at the same place. The final fight of Johnson's early period, during which the stake money was relatively low, was his comprehensive win over a ponderous fighter called Fry for a prize of 50 guineas at Kingston. The fight, which lasted less than 30 minutes, ended with Fry badly beaten up and Johnson with barely a scratch on him. This fight did not attract many supporters of the sport; it took place on 6 June 1786 and was therefore during the period when the wealthy were away from London. Consolidation Johnson had developed to be an exceptional fighter, and a rarity in his day because he used his brain as well as his strength. A barrel-chested man, he weighed around and his height was variously stated in the range of 5' 8\\" (1.73 m) to 5' 10\\" (1.78 m). He was known for his coolness under pressure and he took time to analyse his opponent's strengths, weaknesses and technique. He did not retreat from the fight but avoided risk and was careful not to expose himself too much to attack, although his guard was described as \\"inelegant\\" by Egan. That writer also explained that he \\"worked round his antagonist in a way peculiar to himself, that so puzzled his adversary to find out his intent, that he was frequently thrown off his guard, by which manoeuvring Johnson often gained the most important advantages.\\" All of this meant that his fights were not usually of short duration; he made certain of the outcome rather than risking anything. Having exhausted challengers in London, he took on Bristolian professional Bill Warr for 200 guineas at Oakhampton, Berkshire on 18 January 1787, although the manner of his victory on this occasion was \\"scarcely worthy of being called a fight\\", according to The Sportsman's Magazine. Warr had to resort to shifting and falling to the ground in order to stay in the contest, and as both tactics were regarded as underhand he attracted the ire of the crowd. He survived for almost 90 minutes until a choice blow from Johnson caused Warr to run from the ring, despite the protestations of his second. A hiatus in Johnson's boxing career followed, with no challengers coming forward until the Irish champion Michael Ryan took an interest. The fight at Wraysbury, then in Buckinghamshire, on either 18 or 19 December 1787 saw Richard Humphries (\\"The Gentleman Boxer\\") acting as Johnson's second and Daniel Mendoza as his bottle- holder. Ryan was the favourite to win before the fight, and he had Johnson reeling against the rails of the ring with a blow to the head after almost 20 minutes had elapsed. Humphries' second stepped in to prevent a second strike and this enraged the crowd because they believed Ryan could continue hitting until Johnson fell to the ground. They encouraged Ryan to declare himself victor as a consequence of this foul but he refused, as he wanted to win by means other than a technicality. He allowed Johnson to recover and then, in the space of the next ten minutes, lost the bout. Financial security The nature of the fight with Ryan led to a much anticipated re-match at Cassiobury Park, Hertfordshire on 11 February 1789. At stake was prize money of 600 guineas, as well as Johnson's title of champion. Humphries again acted as Johnson's second and a man called Jackson was his bottle-holder. The fight consisted of one round of mutually displayed skill, during which Johnson was felled, and thereafter was brutal passion. Egan described it as It was over in 33 minutes, when Ryan gave up the fight. One spectator, a Mr Hollingsworth, who was a corn factor and had at one time employed Johnson, was so impressed and pleased with how much he had made from betting on Johnson that he settled a ¬£20 per annum gift for life on the fighter. A proposed bout later in the same year against Ben Bryan (sometimes known as Ben Brian, Ben Brain or Ben Bryant) came to nothing. Bryan had been a collier in Kingswood, Bristol before moving to London to fight. He was seen as a strong potential challenger, having already won two fights in the provinces and then won against John Boone (known as \\"The Fighting Grenadier\\"), a man called Corbally, and Tom Tring. The prize money was set at ¬£1000, but Bryan became ill and had to withdraw, forfeiting his staked deposit of ¬£100. Later in 1789 fighters from the Birmingham area issued a series of challenges to opponents based around London, intended to demonstrate the level of organisation and confidence among the Birmingham boxers and their supporters. Three of the challenges were accepted, including that from Isaac Perrins to Tom Johnson. Perrins, who has been described as \\"the knock-kneed hammerman from Soho\\", had already issued a general challenge, offering to fight any man in England for a prize of 500 guineas, having beaten all challengers in the counties around Birmingham. The Perrins‚ÄìJohnson fight took place at Banbury on 22 October 1789, billed as a battle between Birmingham and London as well as for the English Championship. The venue had been intended to be Newmarket during a race meeting but permission could not be obtained. The two men were about the same age but physically very different. Perrins stood 6' 2\\" (1.88 m) tall and weighed . It was claimed that he had lifted of iron with ease, and he was \\"universally allowed to possess much skill and excellent bottom\\". That is, it was acknowledged that he was skillful and courageous. The physical mismatch was later described as a fight between Hercules, in the form of Perrins, and a boy. The first five minutes of competition saw neither man strike a blow and then when Perrins tried to make contact Johnson dodged and felled Perrins in return. Although Perrins recovered to hold the upper hand in the first few rounds, Johnson then began to dance around the ring, forcing Perrins to follow in order to make a fight of it. This was the first time in his career that Johnson had found it necessary to resort to this tactic of shifting. It confused Perrins because of it being contrary to the custom at the time, but the rules for this particular fight did not prevent it. Nor did they specify what should happen if a contestant fell to the ground, which is what Johnson did in order to avoid being hit ‚Äì this action was thought by the spectators to be unsporting but was permitted by the two umpires. Before long both fighters showed signs of their opponent's attacks, with first Perrins and then Johnson suffering cut eyes and then further damage to their faces. By the fight's end Perrins' head \\"had scarcely the traces left of a human being\\", according to Egan in his history of boxing. The contest lasted 62 rounds, which took a total of 75 minutes to complete, until Perrins became totally exhausted. Tony Gee has said that Perrins' supporters had gambled heavily on him because of his reputation and his advantage in size. In the event it was a major supporter of Johnson, a Thomas Bullock, who gained; he won ¬£20,000 (equivalent to ¬£220,000 as of 2010) from his bets in favour of Johnson and gifted the victor ¬£1,000. The event was recorded in The Gentleman's Magazine of that month: The contestants received 250 guineas each, with Johnson also receiving two-thirds of the entrance takings (after costs) and Perrins receiving the other third. The net takings were ¬£800, and the number of spectators was variously stated as being 3,000 or 5,000. Johnson called on Perrins and left him a guinea to buy himself a drink before leaving Banbury. The fight had proved to be \\"one of the hardest, cleanest and most brilliant encounters that ever took place\\". As O'Hara put it, \\"The stevedore at 33 has become at 39 the Croesus of the ring.\\" Copper medals were struck to commemorate each of the contestants. The obverse side of these contained a picture of the respective fighter; the reverse had the Latin inscription Bella! Horrida bella! (a quotation from Virgil which can be translated as \\"wars, horrible wars\\") and the words \\"Strength and magnanimity\\" in the case of Perrins, and \\"Science and intrepidity\\" for that of Johnson. Chaloner has speculated that these may have been produced by Perrins' employers, Boulton and Watt, and says that they bear similarities with the work of a French die maker called Ponthon who was supplying the firm with industrial items from at least 1791. The National Portrait Gallery holds two pictures of the Banbury fight, one an etching published by George Smeeton in 1812, and the other by Joseph Grozer in 1789. Last fight Ben Bryan now challenged Johnson once more. He had recovered from his previous illness and won a fight at Banbury against Jacombs, another of the Birmingham challengers, on the day after Johnson's victory against Perrins. Subsequently, Bryan had drawn a 180-round contest with Bill Hooper, also known as \\"The Tinman\\", regarding which The Sportsman's Magazine claimed \\"A more ridiculous match never took place in the annals of pugilism.\\" The Duke of Hamilton supplied Bryan's stake to fight Johnson in a contest for a prize of 500 guineas held at Wrotham, Kent. Although it is thought that he held property worth ¬£5,000 by the end of the 1780s, and had earned the equivalent of US$125,000 in 1789 alone (including money earned from betting on himself), Johnson had to rely on friends to provide his stake because he had spent all of his money. He was a gambling man and an \\"easy mark\\", attracting people who gladly took his money from him. Brailsford has commented that this dissipation in his personal life was at odds with his cautious, calculated approach when in the prize ring. Johnson was a clear favourite to win the match, which took place on 17 January 1791 and attracted even more spectators than had been present for the Perrins fight. He had Joe Ward as his second and Mendoza as his bottle holder, with those roles for Bryan being filled by Warr and Humphries. The brutality of the initial fighting was shared by both men. Johnson's nerve failed him, as did his command of the techniques that had served him well. O'Hara describes that he fought \\"like a wild man\\" and, throwing caution to the wind, broke a metacarpal in his middle finger after the momentum created by throwing a wild punch caused him to crash into the ring rail and then to the floor. This was the turning point, and O'Hara describes the situation as, \\"Frightfully beaten, his fists useless, his eyes closed, bathed in blood, and without the chance even of turning the tide with a lucky punch, he refuses to surrender.\\" He had to resort to shifting once more and eventually to wrestling with the hair of Bryan, which generated much disapprobation among the crowd. Eventually Bryan forced Johnson to the floor and beat him unconscious. Johnson had lost the fight, and his status as champion, in 21 minutes. Egan speculated that Johnson's change in style, evident from the outset of the fight might have been due to either genuine concern about Bryan's abilities or from his gambling problems; either way, \\"there was a miserable falling off in him altogether!\\" Egan wrote that Johnson was the nearest any boxer had come to matching the skill of Jack Broughton. He was thought to have earned more money during his reign as champion than any other fighter until John L. Sullivan almost a century later. Jack Anderson, a modern historian of the sport, has summarised the early boxing writers as agreeing the period of Johnson's reign as champion \\"rescued the declining sport and heralded the beginning of a golden age\\". Life after boxing Johnson acted as second to various fighters around the period of his rise and fall. He performed this duty for Tom Tyne (\\"The Tailor\\") at Croydon on 1 July 1788 and at Horton Moor on 24 March 1790, having previously done so for a fighter called Savage who had taken on Jack Doyle at Stepney Fields on 22 November 1787. He also acted twice for Humphries, in his fights against Mendoza at Odiham on 9 January 1788, when Mendoza sprained his ankle on the slippery surface, and at Stilton on 9 May 1789. There was much controversy at the latter, with O'Hara reporting that this caused Mendoza's second, a Captain Brown, to call Johnson a blackguard; Johnson responded by threatening \\"to punch Brown into Eternity.\\" Johnson switched fighters and seconded Mendoza against Humphries at Doncaster on 29 September 1790, and again in a contest against Warr near Croydon in May 1792. Similarly, he acted as second for Hooper when he fought George Maddox at Sydenham Common on 10 February 1794 and for Tom \\"Paddington\\" Jones at Blackheath on 10 May 1794. Other occasions when he acted as second include for John Jackson (near to Croydon, 9 June 1788; and against Mendoza at Hornchurch on 15 April 1795), and Joe Ward (at Hyde Park, date unknown). After his defeat by Bryan he bought and ran a public house, The Grapes, in Duke Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields, London. Retired prizefighters at that time often received the proceeds of a financial collection from their supporters to enable them to buy a licence to operate such premises: \\"today's fighter was merely tomorrow's publican in waiting\\". In a 1901 review of sporting prints titled The old and new pugilism, which lamented the passing of the style and the discipline of prize-fighting, \\"the goal of the successful pugilist was a sporting public house ... they were generally in side or back streets, where the house did not command a transient trade. Most of these sporting \\"pubs\\" had a large room at the back or upstairs, which was open one night a week (preferably Saturday), for public sparring, which was always conducted by a pugilist of some note.\\" The Grapes soon became known as a haunt of gamblers and criminals, which probably lost Johnson his licence to operate the premises. Subsequently he sought wagers at horse race meetings and cockpits, refusing to pay if he lost and instead challenging the victor to a fight. Johnson moved to Copper Alley, Dublin, but had to leave after magistrates determined that his premises were \\"not proving so consonant to the principles of propriety, as was wished\\". He then went to Cork, where he tried to earn a living by teaching boxing. Finding that unrewarding he turned once again to gambling, and according to Dennis Brailsford \\"His deterioration was rapid. Both his health and his spirit were broken\\". He died in Cork on 21 January 1797, aged 47. Johnson tutored George Ingleston (The Brewer) and was at least a supporter of Jones, on whom he once bet ¬£100 to win a fight. He also taught a man called Simpson, who went on to fight Jones in 1804. Johnson's brother, Bill Jackling, also did some boxing. He lost to Elias Spray some time prior to Spray's 1805 fight against Joseph Bourkes, a perennial challenger for the championship.

Origins Born at Berry Pomeroy Castle, Devon, of a family greatly influential in the Western counties, he was the son and heir of Lord Edward Seymour (died 1593), by his wife Margaret Walsh. He was the grandson of Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset (c. 1500 ‚Äì 1552), Lord Protector, in the elder but lower ranking line of his descendants. Because of the alleged adultery of the Duke's first wife Catherine Fillol, the Dukedom had been entailed with preference to his sons by his second marriage. Career Aged 20 he was appointed Deputy Vice-Admiral of Devon. In 1586 he was Vice-Admiral of Cornwall. In the late 16th century there was concern at the threat of a Spanish invasion and he received a commission as a Colonel in 1595, in charge of 1,600 men, and responsible for an area of the south Devon coast from Dartmouth to Plymouth. He was appointed High Sheriff of Devon in 1595 and 1605 and returned as Member of Parliament for Devon in 1593 and between 1601 and 1611. Berry Pomeroy Castle,Devon He spent a large sum extending Berry Pomeroy Castle, over ¬£20,000 according to John Prince in his Worthies of Devon, 1697, particularly in the building of the north range in about 1600. In 1604 he tried to claim part of his grandfather the Duke of Somerset's estate, but was opposed by his half-cousin Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford and was unsuccessful. From around 1611, as a result of the large expenditure on his home, the cost of supporting his eight children and legal expenses, he was apparently short of money.He wrote to his son Walter, who was studying at Oxford, urging him to be economical because a \\"cross fortune in the law\\" had added ¬£2,000 to his debts and the total was crushing. Despite his financial problems on 29 June 1611 he was created Baronet Seymour, of Berry Pomeroy, the patent for which cost him ¬£1,095. Marriage and children Arms of Champernowne: Gules, a saltire vair between twelve billets or At the age of 13 on 19 September 1576 he married Elizabeth Champernowne, having been betrothed to her for about ten years. She was a daughter of Sir Arthur Champernowne (died 1578) of Dartington, Devon, Vice-Admiral of the West under Queen Elizabeth I.

Berry, 113 U.S. 465 (1885), was a writ of error to review the action of the Supreme Court of Arkansas in refusing to restrain officers of that state from levying a tax on property of the plaintiff in error.St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. v. Berry, . One section in the charter of a railway company authorized it to consolidate with other companies. Another section provided that the The court held that a new company, created by the exercise of the power to consolidate, took the property and franchises of the old company subject to the organic law as to taxation at the time of the consolidation. A consolidation of two railway companies by an agreement which provides that all the property of each company shall be taken and deemed to be transferred to the consolidated company (naming it) \\"as such new corporation without further act or deed\\" creates a new corporation, with an existence dating from the time when the consolidation took effect, and is subject to constitutional provisions respecting taxation in force in the state at that time. The high court assumed that the consolidation as made was authorized by, and must be referred to, the tenth section of the charter of the Cairo and Fulton Railroad Company; but we do not admit, what is assumed as an inference from that, that the consolidation took effect, by relation, as of the date of that charter. The consolidated company, the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railroad Company, the plaintiff in error, is not the identical corporation which was the Cairo and Fulton Railroad Company. The terms of the act and agreement of consolidation, which, by the express language of the charter of the Cairo and Fulton Railroad Company, became, on adoption, the charter of the consolidated company, created a new corporation. It was spoken of as \\"the new company\\" in the resolutions of the board of directors, submitting the agreement to the stockholders for their approval, and directing the president to cause the same to be carried into effect, when approved, by calling in \\"the certificates of stock in this company outstanding,\\" and exchanging them \\"for stock in the new company, according to the terms of the agreement.\\" The two corporations agree to become one corporation, and a new name is given to the \\"new corporation.\\" It is spoken of as such throughout the agreement of consolidation. The whole organization is changed and made new. The capital stock is made different from that of either, or the aggregate of both, each share of stock held in the Cairo and Fulton Railroad Company being exchanged for sixty-hundredths of a share in the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway Company. The act of consolidation is declared to be a conveyance of all the rights, privileges, and franchises of each of the constituent corporations, and of all other property, real, personal, and mixed, and all debts due, on whatever account, belonging to each corporation, to the new corporation, without further act or deed. This new corporation did not come into existence until May 4, 1874. It came into existence as a corporation of the State of Arkansas in pursuance of its Constitution and laws, and subject in all respects to their restrictions and limitations. Among these was that one (Art. 5, sec. 48, of the Constitution of 1868) which declared that \\"The property of corporations, now existing or hereafter created, shall forever be subject to taxation, the same as property of individuals.\\" This rendered it impossible in law for the consolidated corporation to receive by transfer from the Cairo and Fulton Railroad Company, or otherwise, the exemption sought to be enforced in this suit. The case is thus brought within the rule declared and applied in Louisville &c.; Railroad Co. v. Palmes, 109 U. S. 244. The court found that it was not an answer to this conclusion to say that the act of consolidation, having been made in pursuance of the tenth section of the charter of the Cairo and Fulton Railroad Company, was the exercise by that company of a right secured to it by contract which no subsequent Constitution or law of the State of Arkansas could impair or defeat. For what was the contract? Construed in the most liberal spirit in favor of the company, it cannot be extended beyond a stipulation on the part of the state that the Cairo and Fulton Railroad Company may at any time thereafter, by consolidation with any other railroad company, form and become a new corporation, with such powers and privileges as at the time when the offer is accepted and acted upon may be within the power of the state to confer, and lawful for the new corporation to accept. If acted upon before the law was changed, it might well be that all the powers and privileges originally conferred, in the charter of the Cairo and Fulton Railroad Company, including the exemption in question, would have vested in the new company. But, as it was not accepted and acted upon until a change in the organic law of the state forbade the creation of corporations capable of holding property exempt from taxation, it must be presumed that when the original company entered into the consolidation, it did so in full view of the existing law, and with the intention of forming a new corporation, such as the Constitution and laws of the state at that time permitted. That at least, we must hold to be the legal effect of the transaction. In that view, the language used by this Court at the present term in the case of Memphis & Little Rock Railroad Co. (as reorganized) v. Berry, 112 U. S. 609, is strictly applicable and is now reaffirmed. The conclusion is unavoidable that the exemption from taxation declared in the eleventh section of the charter of the Cairo and Fulton Railroad Company did not pass by the act of consolidation to the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway Company. The judgment of the Supreme Court of Arkansas was therefore affirmed.

It sits within the civil parish of Penton Grafton, which includes the village of the same name. The village is famous for having a medieval fair and then later a livestock fair, with up to 100,000 sheep a day being auctioned. The fair owed its existence to Weyhill being positioned on 8 ancient trackways, including the Harrow Way. History The Church of St Michael and all the Angels dates back in part to the Norman period, with a 16th-century nave. It is on the site of an earlier Saxon church, itself possibly a successor to a heathen temple in Roman times, being close to the Roman road. It is a Grade II* listed building The fair has been held on the site since the 11th century, with the first written records from 1225. By the mid-19th century the fair had stopped attracting large crowds, as communications and business changed, reducing the variety of items for sale. The last fair happened in 1957. The parish council bought the fairground after it fell into disrepair and converted it into small independent craft studios and shops in 2005. Communications Weyhill railway station was opened on 1 May 1882, by The Swindon, Marlborough and Andover Railway, and closed on 11 September 1961.Aerial photo of station site The village is just north of the A303 dual carriageway. The A342 Andover to Devizes road runs through the town. Attractions Nearby attractions are Thruxton aerodrome and motor racing circuit to the west and the Hawk Conservancy Trust just south of the A303. Popular Culture The historic Weyhill fairground was the site used by Thomas Hardy in his book The Mayor of Casterbridge where Michael Henchard sells his wife. Hardy called it Weydon Priors.

He was born in Peterborough, New Hampshire, United States, and is the son of Jonathan Blanchard and Sarah Goggins. With his parents, he went to Truro, Nova Scotia in 1801. The family later settled at Pictou. Blanchard was educated at the Pictou Academy, went on to study law, and was called to the bar in 1822. He became editor of the Colonial Patriot in Pictou in 1827. In 1832, he married Margaret Spears. Near the end of his term in the assembly, Blanchard's participation was limited due to poor health and he died in Truro at the age of 39.

Also often referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, this initiative is a growing body of federal and state legislations intended to collectively address all or some of the following goals: :(a) Provide transparency with regard to who, in the life sciences industry, is contributing what benefits to which physician; :(b) Mandate statutory reports at least once a year; and, :(c) Limit spend per physician. Organizations monitored include pharmaceutical, biotechnology and, in some states, medical device organizations. U.S. federal laws On September 6, 2007, Senator Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) introduced the Physician Payments Sunshine Act of 2007 (S. 2029). In March 2008, Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Oregon) and Rep. Pete Stark (D-California) introduced a slightly different companion bill in the House of Representatives. (H.R. 5605). These bills were reintroduced in 111th Congress as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act of 2009 (S. 301 and H.R. 3138), again by Senator Chuck Grassley and in the House of Representatives by Rep. Baron Hill (D-Indiana). The bills all aimed to replace the differing state legislations with a single law, common to all 50 states. According to Ashley Glacel, the press secretary for the Senate Aging Committee, whose chairman, Herb Kohl, co-sponsored the bill, the Senate bill is more expansive because it also include Medical Device makers. The bills would amend the Social Security Act \\"to provide for transparency in the relationship between physicians and manufacturers of drugs, devices, or medical supplies for which payment is made under Medicare, Medicaid, or SCHIP.\\" The bill proposed that each quarter, beginning on January 1, 2008, companies or their agents which manufacture drugs, medical devices, or medical supplies would be required to disclose all payments over $25 in value made \\"to a physician, or to an entity that a physician is employed by, has tenure with, or has an ownership interest in\\". The bill would also require manufacturers to provide details on the date, value and nature of the payment, such as whether it was for \\"food, entertainment, or gifts\\", \\"trips or travel\\", \\"a product or other item provided for less than market value\\", \\"participation in a medical conference, continuing medical education, or other educational or informational program or seminar, provision of materials related to such a conference or educational or informational program or seminar, or remuneration for promoting or participating in such a conference or educational or informational program or seminar\\", \\"product rebates or discounts\\", \\"consulting fees or honoraria\\" or \\"any other economic benefit\\". Companies would be required to submit a summary report in electronic format. The proposed penalties for breaches were \\"not less than $10,000, but not more than $100,000\\", for each such failure. The proposed federal law would undermine a stronger Vermont law if passed, according to state officials and advocacy groups. The reporting threshold under the proposed federal law is $500 - much higher than the $25 threshold found in a similar Vermont law passed five years ago. If passed, the federal bill would preempt the state law. In May 2008, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America stated that they supported a revised version of the bill, but only on condition of \\"the continued inclusion of the provision that preempts state law\\". In a media statement, the PhRMA president, Billy Tauzi,n stated that \\"PhRMA believes that preempting local and state marketing reporting or disclosure laws that have been enacted or are pending avoids a confusing myriad of local, state and federal requirements that confuse patients accessing the information and are overly burdensome and costly for those required to report.\\" PPACA The federal bill was finally passed on March 21, 2010, as a provision under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care (PPAC) Act (https://www.cms.gov/LegislativeUpdate/downloads/PPACA.pdf), and several states ‚Äî including California, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Maine, District of Columbia, West Virginia, Vermont and Nevada ‚Äî have already passed their versions of the Sunshine Law. The federal law was due to go into effect from January 1, 2012, with the earliest reports (covering January - December 2012) mandated on or before March 31, 2013. The penalties range from $10,000 to $100,000 for each violation, and can go up to $1 million. In February 2013 the planned dates for implementation were changed to: earliest reports to cover August - December 2013; submission by March 31, 2014. In February 2014 CMS (The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) advised the planned submission dates and what would be submitted were changed. In essence this was because the required registration process, for those who would submit data and attest to the accuracy of that data, was not ready for use, nor were the supporting systems, people and processes for receiving the data On February 18, Open Payments registration and data submission for applicable manufacturers and applicable GPOs opened with a two-phased approach for the first reporting year of the new program: Phase 1 (February 18 through March 31) includes user registration in CMS‚Äô Enterprise Portal (the gateway to CMS‚Äô Enterprise Identity Management system (EIDM)) and submission of corporate profile information and summary aggregate 2013 (August - December) payment data. Phase 2 (begins in May and extends for no fewer than 30 days) includes industry registration in the Open Payments system, submission of detailed 2013( August - December) payment data, and legal attestation to the accuracy of the data. After Phase 2 submission is complete, physicians and teaching hospitals will have the opportunity to register with OpenPayments and view the transactions reported under their name, prior to it being made available to the public. During this review period, any reported transactions may be disputed by the recipient. If a transfer of value is disputed, it will still be publicized, but remain flagged as disputed, until the dispute has been resolved. U.S. State Laws Aggregate Spend compliance has been affected by individual state law compliance, which requires healthcare manufacturers to address and collect distinct spend types to comply with disclosure requirements at the HCP/O aggregate level. Minnesota, West Virginia, Vermont, California, Nevada, and Washington D.C. all have some type of gift-giving limit or disclosure law. Starting in July 2009, Massachusetts and Vermont Gift Ban Law became active with bans of $5,000 and $10,000 per violation respectively. Other states are evaluating similar options as well. On June 29, 2011, the Maine legislature passed House Paper No. 530 which was subsequently signed into law by Governor LePage on July 8, 2011, effectively repealing Maine‚Äôs aggregate spend reporting requirements (22 MRSA ¬ß2698-A) See also *Bad Pharma (2012) by Ben Goldacre  References   Further reading  * \\"What's All the Commotion Over Aggregate Spend?\\", Thought Leadership Sales and Marketing Compliance, Volume 3, Issue 1, Fall 2009 * ‚ÄúSales & Marketing Compliance: Keeping up with Global and Local Challenges‚Äù, PharmaVOICE, January 2007 * ‚ÄúPharmaceutical Company Payments to Physicians: Early Experiences With Disclosure Laws in Vermont and Minnesota‚Äù, JAMA, Vol. 297 No. 11, March 21, 2007  External links  * \\"Tracking of Spend Data Widens\\", Pharmaceutical Executive, February 20, 2008 * United States Senate Special Committee on Aging, June 27, 2007 * Surgeons for Sale: Conflicts and Consultant Payments in the Medical Device Industry * \\"A Free Lunch\\", Forbes, February 25, 2008 * ‚ÄúMinnesota Limit on Gifts to Doctors May Catch On‚Äù, The New York Times, October 12, 2007] Healthcare reform in the United States Life sciences industry ","title":"Aggregate Spend"},{"id":"18797409","text":"Horalky is a Slovak wafer bar with peanut filling and cocoa coating made by I.D.C.

On April 18, 1813, during the fortification phase of Fort LaMotte, two barrel coopers Isaac Brimberry and Thomas Kennedy went up 'Africa Point', a knoll surrounded by swamp on the Wabash River, to procure some wood. They came across Indian canoes pulled on the shore of the river. Both Brimberry and Kennedy reported their sightings to the Fort LaMotte commander, Captain Pierce Andrews. Andrews sent up a squad of skirmishers with the timber party to look after the Indians. The rangers divided themselves into two groups, a six-man party going in advance while the other stayed back and acted as a reserve. On 'Africa Point' the advance group was ambushed and fired upon by the Kickapoo Indians. During the ensuing battle, the American party retreated suffering 4 dead and the 2 badly wounded who escaped back to the fort. Upon hearing rifle fire, the rear guard fell back to the fort as well.

History In the late 19th century the predominant team sport in Rochdale was rugby, in contrast to nearby towns such as Bury and Bolton where association football was the dominant code. The town did not have an association football club until 1896, when the Rochdale Athletic Club and the Rochdale Athletic Ground Company formed Rochdale A.F.C.

He has also played on many other recordings, including those by his first group, the Hampton Grease Band. Career Phillips was a founding member, guitarist and songwriter for the obscure Hampton Grease Band, which formed in 1967. Their double album Music to Eat was released on Columbia Records in 1971 and went on to become a much sought after collector's item. It was also cited as an influence by later groups like Widespread Panic, Phish, and Pere Ubu. In 1996, it was rereleased by Sony to a great deal of acclaim (In June 1996, Spin magazine gave it a 9 out 10 \\"Near Perfect\\" rating). Over the course of the band's six-year career, they played with a wide variety of groups, including the Grateful Dead, Jimi Hendrix, The Allman Brothers Band and Frank Zappa. Zappa was a big fan of the band, and they played with him at the Fillmore East; Phillips jammed with Zappa that evening, as did John Lennon and Yoko Ono. Phillips' solo career began in 1973. He frequently sat in with Little Feat back then, and in an interview, Lowell George called him \\"the most amazing guitarist I've ever seen.\\" Phillips recorded his first solo album Lost at Sea in his home and put it out himself in 1975. The record anticipated the do-it-yourself movement that later overtook rock music. The highly influential British BBC Radio 1 disk-jockey John Peel regularly played the album, at the time available in the Uk only as an import; it subsequently came second in a reader's poll held by Britain's leading music paper Melody Maker. Phillips was then contacted by the head of Virgin Records, Richard Branson (later to start up further companies under the Virgin brand) who signed Phillips and released Lost at Sea on Virgin's subsidiary Caroline Records label. To support this release, Phillips toured Europe extensively - including a show at London's famous Rainbow Theatre. Since then, Phillips has toured frequently, and the fact that his music fits into no particular niche has led to a wide spectrum of double-bills over the years with groups as varied as Captain Beefheart, Eric Johnson, Bo Diddley, Patti Smith, Roy Buchanan, Talking Heads, Albert King, Joe Satriani and The Ventures. During that time, his albums have garnered a great deal of critical acclaim, and those reviews focus on the unique, unclassifiable nature of his music; its intensely emotional impact; and his seemingly limitless virtuosity. Guitar World (Nov. 1983) compared him to Hendrix and Jeff Beck, and his double-CD retrospective Echoes 1975-1985 received a 4-star review in Rolling Stone (Jan. 21, 1993), as did his Supreme Court album with Jeff Calder (of The Swimming Pool Q's). Phillips has also collaborated with Bob Weir of the Grateful Dead and Pete Buck of R.E.M., who said this about him in Musician magazine: \\"One of the reasons I don't play solos is because I grew up listening to Glenn Phillips. He never ceases to amaze me.\\" He's also recorded several albums with Henry Kaiser (one of which received San Francisco's coveted Bammy award). His music has regularly been played on NPR since 1990. In 2015 Mike Holbrook interviewed Phillips on his radio show and followed it with a live performance of \\"Dogs\\" from the Lost at Sea album. Phillips was able to explain that the tune had been inspired by the first dog Phillips had owned as an adult, given to him by Holbrook.

History Current Claypole train station on the Roca Line. The lands were purchased by the Franciscan Congregation to establish a farm and provide produce to their convent in Buenos Aires, and after a few years it was purchased by the Obligado family. Julia Obligado, by then married to Pedro Claypole, donated the land for the local train station in 1876 upon the announcement of plans for a Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway line in the area. The station was thus named for Pedro Claypole, and the arrival of the first train on April 15, 1884, became the establishment date of the town itself. The town's first school, Ej√©rcito de los Andes, was opened in 1906 at the home of a Mrs. Hebbel, later operated at the home of the Baile family. The Peque√±o Cottolengo Argentino de Don Orione school opened in 1935, transforming the previous school into a Christian center for the needy. Furst-Zapiola, a prominent local realty, later donated lots for local institutions such as School N¬∫ 10, the Police Station, the Local Development Society, the Post Office, and City Delegation Hall.

They were originally intended for services on the island of R√ºgen as replacements for Class T 12 and T 10 engines. They emerged when a class of locomotive was conceived in 1912 that was to handle express and passenger trains in border areas or in shuttle services on short routes. A tank engine design with symmetrical running gear was envisaged because, unlike a tender locomotive, it could run equally fast forwards and backwards and could be operated on return journeys without having to be turned on a turntable. Its power and top speed were to be the same as those of the P 8. Robert Garbe designed this 4-6-4 (2'C2') tank locomotive for 100 km/h with a 17-ton axle load and contracted the Vulkan Werke in Stettin to build it. It was given the designation T 18. A total of 534 engines were built from 1912 to 1927, mainly by the Stettiner Maschinenbau AG Vulcan and, from 1923, also by Henschel, of which 458 alone went to the Prussian state railways and, subsequently, the Deutsche Reichsbahn. The Royal W√ºrttemberg State Railways received 20 T 18s in 1919, the Imperial Railways in Alsace-Lorraine 27 also in 1919, the Saar Railway (Saarbahn) 27 between 1922‚Äì25 and the Eutin-L√ºbeck Railway (Eutin-L√ºbecker Eisenbahn) one in each of the years 1936 and 1939. The Reichsbahn took over 460 vehicles from Prussia and 20 from the Royal W√ºrttemberg State Railways, incorporating them into DRG Class 78 with operating numbers 78 001‚Äì282 and 78 351‚Äì528. Of these, number 78 093 came from Alsace-Lorraine and numbers 78 146‚Äì165 from W√ºrttemberg. Later the engines from the Saar Railway were numbered 78 283‚Äì328 and those of the Eutin-L√ºbeck Railway as 78 329 and 330. The Deutsche Bundesbahn took over 424 engines and the Deutsche Reichsbahn in East Germany 53 examples. In 1968 only 35 engines remained with the DR in East Germany. In 1965 the DR fitted the majority of its engines with Giesl chimneys and Witte smoke deflectors. From 1968 the DB locomotives were reclassified into Class 078; in 1970 the DR regrouped its locomotives into Class 78.1. The PKP took over some locomotives, classifying them as OKo 1. The DB converted several Class 78s for push-pull running e.g. between Frankfurt and Wiesbaden. Because the engine driver in the driving coach could only work the brake, operation of the regulator and reversing gear was carried out by specially trained stokers as signalled by the engine driver. The last locomotives were retired by the DB in the mid-1970s at Rottweil locomotive depot (Bahnbetriebswerk or Bw). The farewell journey for this engine class and, at the same time for the Class 38s (Prussian P 8), took place on 31 December 1974. The event was organised by the Zollern Railway Friends. The trip was even reported on the German television channel, ARD.

Wildlife and habitat For a number of years, there has been only one islet at this location. This islet is composed almost entirely of shell fragments. It is extremely dynamic and builds or recedes with passing storms. Vegetation is almost entirely lacking. Birds known to nest here include royal terns, sandwich terns, black skimmers, and laughing gulls. In addition, the islet is used at various times as a loafing area by white pelicans, brown pelicans, and various other species of terns and gulls. Recent hurricanes and storms have eroded the island to such an extent that no nesting has occurred since 1992. Public access to the refuge is restricted due to its remoteness.

He currently holds six Swiss national records (long course and short course). Meichtry has won 31 individual Swiss national medals, 25 gold, 6 silver. He has been competing on the international stage since the 2002 European Championships in Berlin. He was voted as Switzerland's top 10 male Athletes in 2008 and won athlete of the year in his canton of St. Gallen. College Meichtry committed to the University of California, Berkeley in the spring of 2004 and started school in January 2005. He was a multiple All-American for the California Golden Bears swimming and diving team, and placed 2nd at the 2007 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAAs) competition. He was voted team captain of the CAL men's swim team his junior and senior year guiding the bears to a 4th-place finish at the 2008 NCAAs. Meichtry graduated in spring 2009 with a degree in psychology and sociology. Meichtry trained at The Race Club, a summer swimming camp founded by Olympic Swimmers Gary Hall, Jr. and his father, Gary Hall, Sr. The Race Club, originally known as \\"The World Team,\\" was designed to serve as a training group for elite swimmers across the world in preparation for the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games. To be able to train with the Race Club, one must either have been ranked in the top 20 in the world the past 3 calendar years or top 3 in their nation in the past year. The Race Club included such well known swimmers as Roland Mark Schoeman, Mark Foster, Ryk Neethling, and Therese Alshammar.http://www.theraceclub.net/mission-statement/history/world- team/ 2008 Meichtry broke out on the international stage at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, where he swam the 8th fastest time ever recorded in the 200m Freestyle event. In the process, he beat the likes of Michael Phelps--who may not have been swimming his fastest in a quarter finals--to become the first Swiss swimmer to be the top seed going into semi finals. In the 200m Freestyle final he finished sixth in the event (Phelps won the event, finishing more than 2-1/2 seconds ahead of Meichtry). Meichtry also became the first Swiss to break the 49 second barrier when he led off the 4x100 Freestyle relay in 48.96. Later in the competition he lowered his own record to 48.55 in the 100 Freestyle event. In December 2008 Meichtry won his first international medal at the 2008 European Short Course Swimming Championships in Rijeka, Croatia. He won the silver medal in the 200m Freestyle and missed out on the European crown by 0.02s. 2009 ‚Äì present Meichtry moved his training base to Southern California in fall of 2009 to train with Dave Salo for Trojan Swim Club out of the University of Southern California. Under the guidance of Dave Salo, Meichtry qualified for his 3rd Olympic Games at the 2011 World Aquatics Championships in Shanghai, China. There he placed 7th in the 200m Freestyle in a time of 1:47.02 and swam a new national record in the 100m Butterfly event.

He was a scholar of Wadham College, Oxford, earning first-class honours in the Final Honour School of Theology in 1908, and in 1910 being elected Denyer and Johnson Theological Scholar and receiving the Ellerton Essay Prize. He studied briefly at Wells Theological College in 1908 and was ordained deacon the same year, when he had just satisfied the canonical requirement for candidates for ordination to have attained twenty-three years of age. Both his youth and the brevity of his training were quite normal at the time. His first appointment was as Chaplain to Wadham (1908‚Äì10) and he was ordained priest in 1909. From 1910 until 1920 he was Fellow, Dean, and Chaplain of Pembroke College (Honorary Fellow 1934).The Times (1910) He was Temporary Chaplain to the Forces 1917-18 and Chaplain to the Royal Air Force 1918-19.

It is one of the exploitation units for the Lockheed U-2 (operated out of Beale AFB), MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper (operated out of Nellis, NV) and RQ-4 Global Hawk (operated by the 12th Reconnaissance Squadron, also at Beale AFB) unmanned aircraft conducting reconnaissance and surveillance missions. Mission The mission of the 13 IS is to operate Distributed Ground Station-2 (DGS-2), and conduct exploitation of intelligence data collected by the U-2 and Global Hawk and Predator unmanned aerial vehicles, while providing actionable, multisource combat intelligence to combatant commanders.AFISR Agency FOIA request ‚Äì 13 IS Mission Statement History Activated in 1994, the 13th has exploited intelligence from the deployable, long-endurance RQ-4 Global Hawk (which is operated by the 12th Reconnaissance Squadron to fulfill training and operational requirements generated by the Joint Chiefs of Staff in support of unified commanders and the Secretary of Defense). Organization The 13th Intelligence Squadron's history dates to the Second World War. Originally constituted on 1 February 1945, as the 13th Photographic Technical Unit at Maastricht, the Netherlands, in April 1945, the unit reported to France. In May 1945 following allied advances, the 13th reported to Germany where it was assigned to the 363rd Tactical Reconnaissance Group. On 20 November 1945, at the close of World War II, the 13th was inactivated. The unit was reactivated as the 13th Reconnaissance Technical Squadron on 10 April 1963 at Ton Son Nhut Airfield, Republic of Vietnam. The 13th conducted tactical reconnaissance photo- processing and exploitation focused on Vietnam. On 15 June 1967, the unit moved to Clark Air Base, Philippines until it was again inactivated on 15 June 1971. In 1992, the 548th Air Intelligence Group (AIG), Detachment 1 was activated at Beale Air Force Base, California to prepare a site for the Contingency Airborne Reconnaissance System (CARS), Deployable Ground Station Two (DGS-2). On 29 September 1994, the 548th AIG, Det 1 was re-designated the 13th Intelligence Squadron. At that point, the unit was charged with conducting near-real-time imagery exploitation and all-source analysis of U-2 derived intelligence. Using state-of-the-art ground and satellite relays, DGS-2 crews pioneered the practice of \\"reach-back\\" collection, using sensors on board a U-2 aircraft operating half-way around the world as if they were virtually on board the aircraft. In August 1995, the 13th IS, as part of DGS-2, supported Operation DELIBERATE FORCE, a brief NATO air campaign in the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. In November 1995, DGS-2 participated in Operation JOINT GUARDIAN supporting multi-national peacekeeping forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Because of its outstanding performance, completing over 450 successful missions, the 13th Intelligence Squadron was awarded the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency's National Intelligence Meritorious Unit Citation for 1996 and 1997. In January 1998, the 13th IS conducted the first Joint Chiefs of Staff operational tasking utilizing the Extended Tether Program (ETP) architecture. ETP provided DGS-2 with a worldwide, quickly deployable two-way satellite link to the U-2 aircraft. The operation, known as Operation BITTER DISTANT, was a counter-drug operation in the USSOUTHCOM area of operations. In October 1998, DGS-2 began round-the-clock surveillance and reconnaissance operations to monitor the deteriorating situation in Kosovo. On 24 March 1999, NATO-led Operation ALLIED FORCE was launched with the aim of expelling Serbian forces from the province of Kosovo. DGS-2 participated in this operation for its duration, supporting 190 U-2 sorties over 78 days. In addition, DGS-2 conducted processing, exploitation, and dissemination for the Predator unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) during the first combat employment of a UAV to laser designate targets for precision-guided munitions. DGS-2 is credited with the destruction of 39 SAM systems and 28 aircraft during this operation.

He was especially known for his steam locomotive designs, 150. and is described as one of the greatest authorities on the locomotive., 498. He was the first to suggest the use of superheated steam, universally. However, he saw superheated steam as competing with other innovations such as double expansion compound steam engines (he held a grudge against Hannover's August Borries that his pupil Richard Paul Wagner inherited) or combustion chambers. His designs were, on the one hand, simple to maintain and operate; on the other hand, he blocked innovations that every other pre-Reichsbahn state railway used successfully. He held the belief that two coupled axles were enough for any express engine (his masterpiece being the Prussian S 6 class) and trailing axles as in the \\"Pacific\\" configuration were unnecessary. The Prussian P 8 class had to be re-designed almost entirely from his design to become successful, and he envisaged it as an express engine. In that way, he is known as one of the key pioneers of locomotive design because of his achievements concerning the use of superheated steam; his image is tarnished, however, by a conservatism that was proven wrong time and again contemporarily (e.g. by the Bavarian S 3/6, and thereafter Andr√© Chapelon designed highly successful modern compound locomotives, proving the success of every single innovation Garbe rejected).  Childhood and Education  Born in Oppeln (present-day Opole, Opole Voivodeship), in Prussian Upper Silesia on 9 January 1847, Garbe was the eldest son of the master locksmith, Ferdinand Garbe. He went to elementary school in Oppeln and learned his father's locksmith trade. The desire for further education led him to the technical school at Breslau, where he worked in the main workshops of the Upper Silesian Railway and passed his exams as an engine driver in 1867. He also visited the provincial trade school in Brieg, passed the leaving exams with distinction and went, in 1869, to the Royal Prussian Trade Academy in Berlin (later the Berlin-Charlottenburg Technical High School and, today, the Berlin Technical University). He finished his studies in 1872 with top marks in all disciplines. Prussian Railway Division  Afterwards, Garbe was the director of the Central Railway Workshop in Frankfurt (Oder). In 1877 the Ministry entrusted him with leading the main workshop in Berlin-Rummelsburg. In 1895 Garbe was nominated simultaneously as a board member of the Prussian Railway Division at Berlin and Head of Department for the Design and Procurement of Locomotives. In this capacity he also chaired the locomotive committee that had to make recommendations about future locomotive procurement to the Ministry of Public Works. In 1907 the Prussian Railway Central Office was founded in Berlin. Here, Garbe took over the sphere of \\"Construction of Superheated Steam Locomotives and Tenders\\". Inspired by the work of Wilhelm Schmidt ('Hot Steam Schmidt') from Kassel, Garbe was already in 1893 of the view that the use of superheated steam would give steam locomotives a power advantage.  Locomotive Development  The locomotives developed on the basis of the policy issued by Garbe were characterised above all by good performance and simple construction. Consciously, he did not strive for high performance with his designs, but gave priority to reliability and ease of maintenance. By the time Garbe retired, a total of 13 superheated steam locomotive classes had been developed along those lines for all the important locomotive duties, together with a number of experimental designs. Garbe's design fundamentals had been so much part of Prussian locomotive development that they continued to be used even after his retirement. The Prussian P 8 symbolises to a great extent Garbe's design principles. A total of 3,948 examples were built (including the Rumanian copies) and they were working German railway routes until the end of the steam era around 1972‚Äì1974. Garbe's major achievement in the field of technical steam locomotive development was the introduction of superheating, for which he was a keen advocate., 150 He disapproved of compound working; he saw superheating as a total replacement for complicated and maintenance-intensive compound systems, not as an enhancement of them to produce increased power. The most significant acknowledgement was granted to Garbe after he left the service of the state. The Berlin-Charlottenburg Technical High School awarded him an Honorary Doctorate of Engineering for his services in developing the superheated steam locomotive. He died on 23 May 1932 in Berlin.

On 2 February 1942 the ship was delivered to the War Shipping Administration, allocated to the United States Army and operated by Burns and Alaska Steamship Company under an Army charter agreement. On 9 June 1943 Lurline Burns was purchased by the U.S. Navy and commissioned on 22 September 1943 as the miscellaneous auxiliary USS Besboro (AG-66) assigned to duties transporting cargo and troops between Seattle and Alaska. Besboro decommissioned on 3 May 1946 and on 1 July 1946 turned over to the Maritime Commission for disposal. After spending time in the Maritime Commission reserve fleet at Suisun Bay the ship was sold commercial and later was under Panamanian registry as Shapur.  Construction  Caddopeak was built by the Albina Engine & Machine Works as a United States Shipping Board (USSB) Emergency Fleet Corporation Design 1049, a particular design also known as the Albina type, in 1918 at Portland, Oregon. In a departure from the usual practice of launching a hull at about 75% completion the ship, Albina's hull number 8, was launched 98% completed on 18 October 1918 at 4:30 p.m. sponsored by Mrs. George Rogers whose husband was the builder's superintendent.  Commercial service  Until 1922 Caddopeak was owned by the USSB and then sold to Cook which operated the ship briefly until 1923. The ship operated under the Charles Nelson Company from 1923 to 1937. In 1937 Caddopeak was sold to the Burns Steamship Company and renamed Lurline Burns.  World War II service  Lurline Burns was delivered to the War Shipping Administration on 2 February 1942 by the Burns Steamship Company and operated under a United States Army Transportation Corps agreement by Burns Steamship Company as agent until 11 June 1942 when the agent was changed to the Alaska Steamship Company. On 1 March 1943 the operating agent was again changed to the Burns Steamship Company. The ship was purchased by the Navy on 9 June 1943. The ship was commissioned at Seattle, Washington on 22 September 1943 as USS Besboro Classified a miscellaneous auxiliary and designated AG-66 under the command of Lt. Comdr. Robert M. Baughman, USNR. Besboro reported for shakedown training on 1 October and completed it two weeks later. She got underway for Alaskan waters on the 14th and arrived in Dutch Harbor on the 23d. For almost 31 months‚Äîthrough the end of World War II and during the early postwar period‚ÄîBesboro steamed along a resupply circuit carrying cargo and troops between Seattle, Washington, and various points on the coast of Alaska. She returned south for the last time early in 1946. After an inspection and survey at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, the cargoman was declared surplus to the needs of the Navy. Accordingly, Besboro was decommissioned at San Francisco, California, on 3 May 1946. She was turned over to the U.S. Maritime Commission for disposal on 1 July 1946, and her name was struck from the Navy list on 8 October 1946.  Subsequent maritime career  On 23 May 1947, she was sold to the Waterman Steamship Corporation which firm converted her back to mercantile service and restored her former name. However, Lurline Burns did not stay long in its service. By 1948, the Hong Kong firm, Wellem & Co. operated her under Panamanian registry as SS Shapur.

Located in the heart of the port district (Barrio Puerto) of the city, surrounded by cobblestone streets and houses it has a historical importance in the city and was declared a National Monument of Chile in 1971. History Origins In 1559, the Bishop of Santiago, Rodrigo Marmolejo, founded the first temple in Valparaiso, a small chapel that was really little more than a hut. From this point as the settlement grew a series of successive religious congregations: Augustinian (1627), Franciscan (1664), Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy (1715), Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Maryhttp://www.sscc.cl/provincia-chilena/historia-en-chile/ (1834) and Jesuits (1850) used the church. Wealthy local families developed the town and church giving it the distinctive architectural style that it has today. Destruction and reconstruction In 1578, Sir Francis Drake was said to have devastated the port and looted the chapel, taking its treasures and a chalice of silver. During the 17th and 18th century the church suffered pirate attacks. The church has also had a very uncertain history given the frequency of earthquakes which have gutted the building. Since the initial foundation, three churches have been successively erected on the site of the first chapel. Iglesia de la Matriz in 1822 painted by an English artist shortly before the earthquake In November 1822 an earthquake affected the church to the extent it had to be rebuilt stone by stone but this was not done quickly. The church remained a ruin for over a decade until reconstruction began in 1837, finished in 1842, under the direction of priest Jose Antonio Riob√≠o. This fourth construction, is the one that still stands today. In 1868, a quite unusual situation took place in the church when it was used as a voting venue for the elections. Architectural style The church of a typical basilical style, but is built in a way to represent three ships in a rectangular fashion, separated by two waters. The main facade stands out with its classic composition. Eight columns surround the body of the church and the interior walls are decorated with zenithal paintings. There are two main influences which make up the interior of the church including this classicist style of the tower, and the 18th century Creole style represented by its great heavy walls of adobe brick and the ceiling covered with clay roofing tiles.

He spent the major part of his playing career at the club, and in later life became club Chairman. Rugby career Down joined Bristol at the beginning of the 1904/05 season from the Redland club, and made his full d√©but against Pontypridd RFC in December 1905. Down rapidly established himself in the first team and gained himself a reputation as a tough and committed player. His performances were widely praised and meant he soon earned selection for Somerset. His efforts were also recognised at international level: Down was chosen as a member of the 1908 British Lions tour to New Zealand and Australia, played three matches in New Zealand but fell overboard as the boat left for Australia. He was rescued by New Zealand players George A. Gillett and Arthur 'Bolla' Francis, who kept him afloat until a rope was lowered from the ship upon which Down was about to sail. In addition Down played once for England's national side, against Australia in 1909; the first meeting between the two nations. Although England lost 9 ‚Äì 3, Down played with distinction but was never capped again. Four days later Down, then Bristol's club captain, led a combined Bristol and Clifton R.F.C. XV against the Australian national side at Bristol's County Ground. The tourists won 11 ‚Äì 3 in one of the finest games of the tour. His last game for Bristol was against Devonport Albion R.F.C. in January 1910. In all Down had played 117 games for Bristol, scoring 12 tries, 36 points. After World War II Down was elected Bristol's Vice-Chairman for the 1945/46 season, but he took over the running of the club when Chairman W.J. Houlden died in office. He served as chairman until 1953/54 but died suddenly during the close season, shortly after being awarded life membership. A memorial fund was established in his name which provided for repairs and developments to the hall under the stand. Down‚Äôs son- in-law, Denzil Golledge, was Bristol captain for the 1950/51 season.

Built in 1896, it served as the main office of the Town of Southeast, which surrounds and includes Brewster. In 1964, the town's clerk and supervisor moved to the recently closed First National Bank of Brewster's building down the street (since then, they have moved to new offices on NY 22 north of the village). Some town offices are still in the building, which also today houses the Southeast Museum. In 1979, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in recognition of its early yet mature Colonial Revival architecture. Building The former town hall is a three-story, three-bay rectangular structure of brick (now faced with putty-colored stucco) in common bond. The front facade has a distinctive, elaborate main entrance with a two-story portico framed by pilasters which go all the way to the roofline. The entrance itself, now behind modern storm doors, has four paneled wooden doors with a neoclassical surround with engaged columns, full entablature and large fanlight. On either side of the portico are sash windows, similarly trimmed, supported by aprons atop smaller side entrances on the first story. The hip roof is pierced on the front by three dormer windows whose pointed crests reflect the Moorish Revival trend of the earlier 19th century. Four corbeled chimneys rise from the top. Window placement on the other four sides is irregular. The east side still has its original wrought iron fire escape. An additional entrance, to the building's basement, is found on the south side. On the west side, a small jail wing of similar material, built shortly after the completion of the town hall, is the building's only addition. On the inside, the ground level is of stripped maple with sheet-iron walls and ceiling supported by two rows of cast iron columns. A large metal vault is located under the main stairs, which lead to the auditorium. That takes up two stories leading up to an exposed wooden truss ceiling. The three dormers provide light to the balcony level behind them. History Brewster and the area around it grew substantially in the years after the Civil War due to the construction of the New York and Harlem Railroad. The New York Central Railroad arrived in Brewster in 1849. In response to this, a Second Empire- style town hall was built on the site in 1869. It burned down on February 23, 1880 when a fire swept the entire south side of Main Street. A replacement was built in 1882, only to meet the same fate in 1893. Mindful of these two disasters, the current building was designed by the New York City firm of Child & DeGroll to be as fireproof as possible, using less combustible materials like iron and brick. It opened in 1896. Four years later, in 1900, the jail wing was added to the west. That has been the only significant addition or alteration to the building. The town government remained there until, in 1964, more space became necessary. The town clerk and town supervisor's office were moved to the recently closed First National Bank of Brewster building down the street, near the train station. The Southeast Museum had been established a year earlier, and moved into the vacated space. The Southeast Museum has been a steward of the Old Town Hall for 47 years. In 1977, prior to the building being listed on the Register, extensive renovations were done to bring it back to its original appearance, jointly sponsored by the village of Brewster and the Southeast Museum. Supervising architect Richard Brennan of New Canaan, Connecticut relied on the original drawings to guide the restoration. The auditorium's stage was extended 10 feet (3 m) to accommodate the needs of contemporary theatrical productions, and the basement was remodeled to serve as offices for some minort town offices and community organizations, and town court. No other changes were made at that time. The town's master plan update in 2002 recommended that it take measures to bring the building up to code and otherwise improve it. The town court, especially, was overcrowded., June 2002, Town of Southeast, 9.2, retrieved August 10, 2008. This led to the construction of the current town hall in the mid-2000s and the town's final retreat from its old town hall.

The brainchild of the Anglo-Norwegian explorer Carsten Borchgrevink, it was the first expedition to over-winter on the Antarctic mainland, the first to visit the Great Ice Barrier‚Äîlater known as the Ross Ice Shelf‚Äîsince Sir James Clark Ross's groundbreaking expedition of 1839 to 1843, and the first to effect a landing on the Barrier's surface. It also pioneered the use of dogs and sledges in Antarctic travel. The expedition was privately financed by the British magazine publisher Sir George Newnes. Borchgrevink's party sailed in the , and spent the southern winter of 1899 at Cape Adare, the northwest extremity of the Ross Sea coastline. Here they carried out an extensive programme of scientific observations, although opportunities for inland exploration were restricted by the mountainous and glaciated terrain surrounding the base. In January 1900, the party left Cape Adare in Southern Cross to explore the Ross Sea, following the route taken by Ross 60 years earlier. They reached the Great Ice Barrier, where a team of three made the first sledge journey on the Barrier surface, during which a new Farthest South record latitude was established at 78¬∞ 50‚Ä≤S. On its return to England the expedition was coolly received by London's geographical establishment exemplified by the Royal Geographical Society, which resented the pre-emption of the pioneering Antarctic role they envisaged for the Discovery Expedition. There were also questions about Borchgrevink's leadership qualities, and criticism of the limited extent of scientific results. Thus, despite the number of significant \\"firsts\\", Borchgrevink was never accorded the heroic status of Scott or Shackleton, and his expedition was soon forgotten in the dramas which surrounded these and other Heroic Age explorers. However, Roald Amundsen, conqueror of the South Pole in 1911, acknowledged that Borchgrevink's expedition had removed the greatest obstacles to Antarctic travel, and had opened the way for all the expeditions that followed.  Background  A cartoon depiction of Sir George Newnes. Born in Oslo in 1864 to a Norwegian father and an English mother, Carsten Borchgrevink emigrated to Australia in 1888, where he worked as a land surveyor in the interior before accepting a provincial schoolteaching appointment in New South Wales. Having a taste for adventure, in 1894 he joined a commercial whaling expedition, led by Henryk Bull, which penetrated Antarctic waters and reached Cape Adare, the western portal to the Ross Sea. A party including Bull and Borchgrevink briefly landed there, and claimed to be the first men to set foot on the Antarctic continent‚Äîalthough the American sealer John Davis believed he had landed on the Antarctic Peninsula in 1821. Bull's party also visited Possession Island in the Ross Sea, leaving a message in a tin box as proof of their journey. p. 3 Borchgrevink was convinced that the Cape Adare location, with its huge penguin rookery providing a ready supply of fresh food and blubber, could serve as a base at which a future expedition could overwinter and subsequently explore the Antarctic interior. (Introduction)Preston, pp. 14‚Äì16 After his return from Cape Adare, Borchgrevink spent much of the following years in Australia and England, seeking financial backing for an Antarctic expedition. Despite a well-received address to the 1895 Sixth International Geographical Congress in London, in which he professed his willingness to lead such a venture, he was initially unsuccessful. p. 1 The Royal Geographical Society (RGS) was preparing its own plans for a large-scale National Antarctic Expedition (which eventually became the Discovery Expedition 1901‚Äì04) and was in search of funds; Borchgrevink was regarded by RGS president Sir Clements Markham as a foreign interloper and a rival for funding. Borchgrevink persuaded the publisher Sir George Newnes (whose business rival Alfred Harmsworth was backing the RGS venture) to meet the full cost of his expedition, some ¬£40,000. This gift infuriated Markham and the RGS, since Newnes's donation, had it come their way would, he said have been enough \\"to get the National Expedition on its legs\\". p. 2 Newnes stipulated that Borchgrevink's expedition should sail under the British flag, and be styled the \\"British Antarctic Expedition\\". Borchgrevink readily agreed to these conditions, even though only two of the entire expedition party were British.Jones, pp. 59‚Äì60. Another member of the shore party, Louis Bernacchi, was Australian; the remainder were all Scandinavian. This annoyed Markham all the more,Crane, p. 74 and he subsequently rebuked the RGS librarian Hugh Robert Mill for attending the Southern Cross Expedition launch. Mill had toasted the success of the expedition, calling it \\"a reproach to human enterprise\\" that there were parts of the earth that man had never attempted to reach. He hoped that this reproach would be lifted through \\"the munificence of Sir George Newnes and the courage of Mr Borchgrevink\\".Borchgrevink, p. 25  Organisation   Expedition objectives  Borchgrevink's original expedition objectives included the development of commercial opportunities, as well as scientific and geographical discovery. However, his plans to exploit the extensive guano deposits that he had observed during his 1894‚Äì95 voyage were not pursued. Research would be carried out across a range of disciplines,Equipment and Personnel and Borchgrevink hoped that the scientific results would be complemented by spectacular geographical discoveries and journeys, even perhaps an attempt on the geographical South Pole itself; he was unaware at this stage that the site of the base at Cape Adare would not allow access to the Antarctic interior.Crane, pp. 74‚Äì75  Ship  For his expedition's ship, Borchgrevink purchased in 1897 a steam whaler, Pollux, that had been built in 1886 in Arendal on the south east coast of Norway, to the design of renowned shipbuilder Colin Archer.Borchgrevink, pp. 10‚Äì11. Archer had designed and built Fridtjof Nansen's ship, , which in 1896 had returned unscathed from its long drift in the northern polar ocean during Nansen's Fram expedition.Jones, p. 63. Pollux, which Borchgrevink renamed , was barque- rigged, 520 gross register tons, and overall length. The ship was taken to Archer's yard in Larvik to be fitted out with engines designed to Borchgrevink's specification. Although Markham continued to question the ship's seaworthiness,Preston, p. 16. she was able to fulfil all that was required of her in Antarctic waters. Like several of the historic polar ships her post-expedition life was relatively short. She was sold to the Newfoundland Sealing Company, and in April 1914, was lost with her entire complement of 173, in the 1914 Newfoundland sealing disaster.  Personnel  Carsten Borchgrevink, expedition leader The ten-man shore party who were to winter at Cape Adare consisted of Borchgrevink, five scientists, a medical officer, a cook who also served as a general assistant, and two dog drivers. Five‚Äîincluding Borchgrevink‚Äîwere Norwegian, two were English, one Australian and the two dog experts Sami from northern Norway, sometimes described in expedition accounts as Lapps or \\"Finns\\". Among the scientists was the Tasmanian Louis Bernacchi, who had studied magnetism and meteorology at the Melbourne Observatory. He had been appointed to the Belgian Antarctic Expedition of 1897‚Äì1899, but had been unable to take up his post when the expedition's ship, the , had failed to call at Melbourne on its way south. Bernacchi then travelled to London and secured a place on Borchgrevink's scientific staff. Nine men (Ole Must in traditional Lap dress) and two dogs on deck, Southern Cross, British Antarctic (Southern Cross) Expedition, 1898 His later chronicle of the expeditionTo the South Polar Regions, Hurst & Blackett, London 1901 was critical of aspects of Borchgrevink's leadership, but defended the expedition's scientific achievements. In 1901, Bernacchi would return to Antarctica as a physicist on Scott's Discovery expedition.Crane, p. 108. Another of Borchgrevink's men who later served Scott's expedition, as commander of the relief ship , was William Colbeck,Crane, pp. 232‚Äì233. who held a lieutenant's commission in the Royal Naval Reserve. In preparation for the Southern Cross Expedition, Colbeck had taken a course in magnetism at Kew Observatory. Borchgrevink's assistant zoologist was Hugh Blackwell Evans, a vicar's son from Bristol, who had spent three years on a cattle ranch in Canada and had also been on a sealing voyage to the Kerguelen Islands. The chief zoologist was Nicolai Hanson, a graduate from the Royal Frederick University. Also in the shore party was Herluf Kl√∏vstad, the expedition's medical officer, whose previous appointment had been to a lunatic asylum in Bergen. The others were Anton Fougner, scientific assistant and general handyman; Kolbein Ellifsen, cook and general assistant; and the two Sami dog- handlers, Per Savio and Ole Must, who, at 21 and 20 years of age respectively, were the youngest of the party. The ship's company, under Captain Bernard Jensen, consisted of 19 Norwegian officers and seamen and one Swedish steward. Jensen was an experienced ice navigator in Arctic and Antarctic waters, and had been with Borchgrevink on Bull's Antarctic voyage in 1894‚Äì1895.Borchgrevink, pp. 13‚Äì19.  Voyage   Cape Adare  Camp and Hut (summer), Antarctica, British Antarctic (Southern Cross) Expedition, 1899 Southern Cross left London on 23 August 1898, after inspection by the Duke of York (the future King George V), who presented a Union Flag. The ship was carrying 31 men and 90 Siberian sledge dogs, the first to be taken on an Antarctic expedition. (Equipment and Personnel) After final provisioning in Hobart, Tasmania, Southern Cross sailed for the Antarctic on 19 December. She crossed the Antarctic Circle on 23 January 1899, and after a three-week delay in pack ice sighted Cape Adare on 16 February, before anchoring close to the shore on the following day. Cape Adare, discovered by Antarctic explorer James Clark Ross during his 1839‚Äì43 expedition, lies at the end of a long promontory, below which is the large triangular shingle foreshore where Bull and Borchgrevink had made their brief landing in 1895. This foreshore held one of the largest Adelie penguin rookeries on the entire continent and had ample room, as Borchgrevink had remarked in 1895, \\"for houses, tents and provisions\\". The abundance of penguins would provide both a winter larder and a fuel source.Preston, p. 14 Scene from a hut at Camp Ridley, with Fougner, Evan, and Colbeck. Unloading began on 17 February. First ashore were the dogs, with their two Sami handlers, Savio and Must, who remained with them and thus became the first men to spend a night on the Antarctic continent. (Arrival at Cape Adare) During the next twelve days the rest of the equipment and supplies were landed, and two prefabricated huts were erected, one as living quarters and the other for storage. (First Buildings) These were the first buildings erected on the continent. A third structure was contrived from spare materials, to serve as a magnetic observation hut. As accommodation for ten men the \\"living hut\\" was small and cramped, and seemingly precarious‚ÄîBernacchi later described it as \\"fifteen feet square, lashed down by cables to the rocky shore\\".Crane, p. 153 The dogs were housed in kennels fashioned from packing cases. By 2 March the base, christened \\"Camp Ridley\\" after Borchgrevink's English mother's maiden name, was fully established, and the Duke of York's flag raised. That day, Southern Cross departed to winter in Australia. The living hut contained a small ante-room used as a photographic darkroom, and another for taxidermy. Daylight was admitted to the hut via a double-glazed, shuttered window, and through a small square pane high on the northern wall. Bunks were fitted around the outer walls, and a table and stove dominated the centre. During the few remaining weeks of Antarctic summer, members of the party practised travel with dogs and sledges on the sea ice in nearby Robertson Bay, surveyed the coastline, collected specimens of birds and fish, and slaughtered seals and penguins for food and fuel. Outside activities were largely curtailed in mid-May, with the onset of winter.  Antarctic winter  Drawing by Kolbein Ellefsen, on the wall of the Cape Adare hut above his bed, as he passed the time during the Antarctic winter Winter proved to be a difficult time; Bernacchi wrote of rising boredom and irritation: \\"Officers and men, ten of us in all, found tempers wearing thin\\". During this period of confinement, Borchgrevink's weaknesses as a commander were exposed; he was, according to Bernacchi, \\"in many respects ... not a good leader\\". The polar historian Ranulph Fiennes later described the conditions as \\"democratic anarchy\\", with dirt, disorder and inactivity the order of the day.Fiennes, p. 43 Borchgrevink's lack of scientific training, and his inability to make simple observations, were additional matters of concern. (Departure of the Expedition) Nevertheless, the programme of scientific observations was maintained throughout the winter. Exercise was taken outside the hut when the weather permitted, and as a further diversion Savio improvised a sauna in the snowdrifts. Concerts were held, including lantern slides, songs and readings. (Life at Camp Ridley) During this time there were two near-fatal incidents; in the first, a candle left burning beside a bunk set fire to the hut and caused extensive damage. In the second, three of the party were nearly asphyxiated by coal fire fumes as they slept. The party was well-supplied with a variety of basic foodstuffs‚Äîbutter, tea and coffee, herrings, sardines, cheeses, soup, tinned tripe, plum pudding, dry potatoes and vegetables. There were nevertheless complaints about the lack of luxuries, Colbeck noting that \\"all the tinned fruits supplied for the land party were either eaten on the passage or left on board for the [ship's] crew\\". There was also a shortage of tobacco; in spite of an intended provision of half a ton (500 kg), only a quantity of chewing tobacco was landed. The zoologist, Nicolai Hanson, had fallen ill during the winter. On 14 October 1899 he died, apparently of an intestinal disorder, and became the first person to be buried on the Antarctic continent. The grave was dynamited from the frozen ground at the summit of the Cape. (First Burial) Bernacchi wrote: \\"There amidst profound silence and peace, there is nothing to disturb that eternal sleep except the flight of seabirds\\". Hanson left a wife, and a baby daughter born after he left for the Antarctic. As winter gave way to spring, the party prepared for more ambitious inland journeys using the dogs and sledges. Their base camp was cut off from the continent's interior by high mountain ranges, and journeys along the coastline were frustrated by unsafe sea ice. These factors severely restricted their exploration, which was largely confined to the vicinity of Robertson Bay. Here, a small island was discovered, which was named Duke of York Island, after the expedition's patron.Borchgrevink, p. 22 A few years later this find was dismissed by members of Scott's Discovery Expedition, who claimed that the island \\"did not exist\\",Huxley, p. 60 but its position has since been confirmed at 71¬∞38‚Ä≤S, 170¬∞04‚Ä≤E.  Ross Sea exploration  The expedition was the first to use dogs in the Antarctic. On 28 January 1900 Southern Cross returned. Borchgrevink and his party quickly vacated the camp, and on 2 February he took the ship south into the Ross Sea. Evidence of a hasty and disorderly departure from Cape Adare was noted two years later by members of the Discovery Expedition, when Edward Wilson wrote; \\"... heaps of refuse all around, and a mountain of provision boxes, dead birds, seals, dogs, sledging gear ... and heaven knows what else\\".Wilson diary, 9 January 1902, pp. 93‚Äì95 Southern Cross first called at Possession Island, where the tin box left by Borchgrevink and Bull in 1895 was recovered. They then proceeded southwards, following the Victoria Land coast and discovering further islands, one of which Borchgrevink named after Sir Clements Markham, whose hostility towards the expedition was evidently unchanged by this honour.Huxley, p. 25 Southern Cross then sailed on to Ross Island, observed the volcano Mount Erebus, and attempted a landing at Cape Crozier, at the foot of Mount Terror. Here, Borchgrevink and Captain Jensen were almost drowned by a large wave caused by a calving or breakaway of ice from the adjacent Great Ice Barrier. Following the path of James Clark Ross sixty years previously, they proceeded eastwards along the Barrier edge, to find the inlet where, in 1843, Ross had reached his farthest south.Preston, p. 13 Observations indicated that the Barrier edge had moved some 30 statute miles (50 km) south since Ross's time, which meant that the ship were already south of Ross's record. Borchgrevink was determined to make a landing on the Barrier itself, and in the vicinity of Ross's inlet he found a spot where the ice sloped sufficiently to suggest that a landing was possible. On 16 February he, Colbeck and Savio landed with dogs and a sledge, ascended to the Barrier surface, and then journeyed a few miles south to a point which they calculated as 78¬∞50‚Ä≤S, a new Farthest South record. They were the first persons to travel on the Barrier surface, earning Amundsen's approbation: \\"We must acknowledge that, by ascending the Barrier, Borchgrevink opened the way to the south, and threw aside the greatest obstacle to the expeditions that followed\\".Amundsen, Vol I, pp. 25‚Äì26 Close to the same spot ten years later, Amundsen would establish his base camp \\"Framheim\\", prior to his successful South Pole journey.Amundsen, Vol I, pp. 167‚Äì68 On its passage northward, Southern Cross halted at Franklin Island, off the Victoria Land coast, and made a series of magnetic calculations. These indicated that the location of the South Magnetic Pole was, as expected, within Victoria Land, but further north and further west than had previously been assumed. The party then sailed for home, crossing the Antarctic Circle on 28 February. On 1 April, news of their safe return was sent by telegram from Bluff, New Zealand.  Aftermath  Southern Cross returned to England in June 1900,Stonehouse, p. 40 to a cool welcome; public attention was distracted by the preparations for the upcoming Discovery Expedition, due to sail the following year. Borchgrevink meanwhile pronounced his voyage a great success, stating: \\"The Antarctic regions might be another Klondyke\\"‚Äîin terms of the prospects for fishing, sealing, and mineral extraction. (Results) He had proved that it was possible for a resident expedition to survive an Antarctic winter, and had made a series of geographical discoveries. These included new islands in Robertson's Bay and the Ross Sea, and the first landings on Franklin Island, Coulman Island, Ross Island and the Great Ice Barrier. The survey of the Victoria Land coast had revealed the \\"important geographical discovery ... of the Southern Cross Fjord, as well as the excellent camping place at the foot of Mount Melbourne\\". The most significant exploration achievement, Borchgrevink thought, was the scaling of the Great Ice Barrier and the journey to \\"the furthest south ever reached by man\\". Mount Melbourne, on Victoria Land, at the foot of which Borchgrevink discovered \\"an excellent camping place\\" Borchgrevink's account of the expedition, First on the Antarctic Continent, was published the following year; the English edition, much of which may have been embroidered by Newnes's staff, was criticised for its \\"journalistic\\" style and for its bragging tone. The author, whom commentators recognised was \\"not known for either his modesty or his tact\\", embarked on a lecture tour of England and Scotland, but the reception was generally poor. Despite the unexplained disappearance of many of Hansen's notes, Hugh Robert Mill described the expedition as \\"interesting as a dashing piece of scientific work\\". The meteorological and magnetic conditions of Victoria Land had been recorded for a full year; the location of the South Magnetic Pole had been calculated (though not visited); samples of the continent's natural fauna and flora, and of its geology, had been collected. Borchgrevink also claimed the discovery of new insect and shallow-water fauna species, proving \\"bi-polarity\\" (existence of species in proximity to the North and South poles). The geographical establishments in Britain and abroad were slow to give formal recognition to the expedition. The Royal Geographical Society gave Borchgrevink a fellowship, and other medals and honours eventually followed from Norway, Denmark and the United States, but the expedition's achievements were not widely recognised. Markham persisted in describing Borchgrevink as cunning and unprincipled;Riffenburgh, p. 56 Amundsen's warm tribute was a lone approving voice. According to Scott's biographer David Crane, if Borchgrevink had been a British naval officer his expedition would have been treated differently, but \\"a Norwegian seaman/schoolmaster was never going to be taken seriously\\". A belated recognition came in 1930, long after Markham's death, when the Royal Geographical Society presented Borchgrevink with its Patron's Medal. It admitted that \\"justice had not been done at the time to the pioneer work of the Southern Cross expedition\\", and that the magnitude of the difficulties it had overcome had previously been underestimated. After the expedition, Borchgrevink lived quietly, largely out of the public eye. He died in Oslo on 21 April 1934.

Life and career  Browning started to play drums at 13 years old. His main influences are Black Sabbath, Slayer, Angel Witch, Mercyful Fate, and Celtic Frost. Browning was the former drummer/vocalist for death metal pioneers Morbid Angel. He played in the band from 1984 to 1986 and made one official recording with them, Abominations of Desolation; it was not released until 1991, years after Browning left the band. Browning had a very turbulent relationship with Morbid Angel guitarist Trey Azagthoth; Browning's exit from the band was apparently triggered by Azagthoth being involved in an affair with Browning's then girlfriend, leading to an altercation between the two. Following his departure from Morbid Angel, Browning remained active as the drummer/vocalist for bands in the Florida death metal scene, including Nocturnus, a technical/progressive-oriented death metal band featuring a keyboard player and science fiction-themed lyrics. Browning was the drummer and vocalist for the band on their album The Key (1990) and solely played drums on Thresholds before being fired from the band in 1993. The band has now revived under the name \\"Nocturnus AD\\", but it's not a reunion because Nocturnus AD contains different members from the original Nocturnus, except Browning. Other projects he participated in during the 1980s and 1990s included Florida death metal bands Incubus and Acheron. Browning's current band is called After Death, with lyrics concerned with the occult and black magic. He was also involved in Devine Essence and Wolf and Hawk, with metal singer Lisa Lombardo.

Work started in 1795, but the scheme was effectively bankrupt by 1797, and construction of the locks was never completed. History Ilchester was a Roman garrison town, built at the point where the Fosse Way crossed the River Ivel, and there is evidence that the Romans built quays on the river. There are mentions of boats using the river in the 13th century, and in a survey carried out in 1632 by Gerard. However, the Ivel was never a large river, and when there was inadequate water to reach Ilchester, goods were unloaded at Pill Bridge, which crossed the river downstream from the town. All goods moving from that bridge to the town had to pay tolls to the Borough of Ilchester, which increased the price of coal to the inhabitants. Navigation was also hampered by the restrictive size of the medieval bridge arch at Langport. The Ivelchester and Langport Navigation was conceived as a way of ensuring that boats could always reach the Ilchester town wharfs, and therefore duty would not be paid on goods using Pill Bridge Lane. Construction Following a meeting with representatives from the Dorset and Somerset Canal, which was part of a grand scheme to link the Bristol Channel to the English Channel, a number of local businessmen obtained an Act of Parliament on 22 June 1795, which made provision for improving the river between Ilchester and Bicknell Bridge, just to the south east of Langport, and then cutting through the town along the course of the Portlake Rhine, which was then a drain, and rejoining the River Parrett below Langport lock. The act allowed the proprietors to raise ¬£6,000 by issuing shares, and a further ¬£2,000 in loans, if required. Around three quarters of the share capital had been promised before the act was obtained, and so work commenced immediately. The plans involved widening the Portlake Rhine, building a lock close to the Little Bow bridge, near the centre of the town, and making a cut to join the River Parrett again near Bicknell's Bridge, which would include two more locks. A further four locks were to be constructed between there and Ilchester. The engineer was a local man called Josiah Easton, and good progress was made in the first six months at the Langport end of the scheme, but costs were escalating, and by October 1796, the scheme was in difficulty. The ¬£6,000 of share capital had all been spent, but little work had been done on removing shoals from the river towards Ilchester. In 1797, outstanding debts were cleared and the scheme was effectively abandoned. The Parrett Navigation Act Despite the scheme not being finished, some traffic continued to use the river. The Parrett Navigation Act, which was obtained in 1836, authorised improvements to the River Parrett below Langport, the construction of a canal to Westport, and the rebuilding of the Great Bow Bridge, to allow larger boats to travel beyond Langport. Normal canal tolls were charged for use of the canal, and there was a toll for trade passing under the rebuilt bridge, but some of the shareholders felt that boat users on the River Ivel should also be charged, since the water levels on the river had improved since the construction of the Parrett Navigation works. Accordingly, Nicholas Broadmead, who was a solicitor, and Philip Broadmead, both of whom were shareholders in the Parrett Navigation Company, set about tracing and buying the 120 shares of the original Ivelchester and Langport Canal Company. Philip Broadmead obtained professional opinions on the legality of the proposed action, and produced a document outlining the expected returns on such a scheme. Some shares were obtained, and a meeting was held on 26 September 1843 at the Castle Inn in Ilchester, but the outcome is not known, as the plan faded away, and the planned resurrection of the company did not occur. Today Little remains of the Navigation. The course of the Portlake Rhine and the channel from Bicknell's Bridge to Little Bow bridge can be made out in the landscape, but navigation on the Parrett as a whole has largely ceased because the locks have been replaced by sluices.

The small cemetery is now closed to new burials, and is mostly hidden within the residential neighbourhood of Leslieville. It was established in 1849 by two prominent local businessmen Judah G. Joseph and Abraham Nordheimer (uncertain if Joseph is buried here, while Nordheimer died during his trip to Germany in 1862 and is buried at Bamberg Jewish Cemeteryhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/156204893/abraham-nordheimer). At the time the nearest Jewish cemeteries were in Montreal or Buffalo, and Joseph was concerned for his fatally ill son Samuel, who eventually became the first burial in the new cemetery. The location near the corner of Pape (then called Centre Road) and Gerrard was then in still rural areas to the east of the city. It was not close to much of the Jewish community, but was a convenient location to purchase. It was one of the first Jewish institutions established in Toronto, being opened some years before the city's first synagogue. When Toronto Hebrew Congregation, the predecessor to Holy Blossom Temple, was established in 1856, it took over management of the cemetery, and continues to run it today. Over the next decades almost all the early founders of Toronto's Jewish community would be buried there. The small Pape Avenue Cemetery quickly ran out of room, and it was closed to new burials in the 1930s.

His father, a blacksmith, and grandfather were also named Preserved Fish. His extended family, prominent in New York, also gave rise to Hamilton Fish, governor, senator, and secretary of state, and Stuyvesant Fish. He was descended from Thomas Fish, who settled in New England in 1643. As a youth, the younger Preserved Fish shipped to the Pacific on a whaler, becoming its captain at the age of 21. He soon realized that fortune lay in selling whale oil, not in harvesting it. Career He prospered as a merchant in New Bedford, Massachusetts, but had a political squabble and left for New York. He, along with Joseph Grinnell, controlled a potent shipping firm named Fish & Grinnell - later Grinnell, Minturn & Company - which had its beginnings in his efforts to expand his whale oil market. In 1812, he became a director of Bank of America, founded after the charter of the First Bank of the United States was not renewed. He also was one of the 28 brokers of the New York Exchange Board, which later became the New York Stock Exchange. After his resignation from Fish & Grinnell and a brief retirement from business, he served from 1836 to his death as President of the Tradesman's Bank as well as president of the Bank of America, which was unrelated to the current institution of that name. He was also involved with Tammany Hall: along with Gideon Lee, another banker, his faction controlled the Democratic Party in New York City at the time that the Locofoco reformers attempted, unsuccessfully, to take it over. p.609 He was one of the leaders in the movement opposed to sabbatarianism in the United States. Personal life Fish was married three times. His first wife died giving birth to a child in New Bedford, who did not live. His second wife died in New York City, and he thereafter married his third wife just four months later. None of Fish's children survived, however, he had an adopted son named William Fish who reportedly \\"died a disgraced man.\\" William had one child who could inherit Fish's property predicated on \\"the youth must renounce his mother on arriving at the age of twenty-one.\\" Fish died on July 23, 1846 in Manhattan.

He was the 194th person to be executed by gassing in California (1937‚Äì67), and the only person to be executed in that state during the term of Governor Ronald Reagan (1967‚Äì1975). Both Reagan and his predecessor had declined clemency. Mitchell's case had been heard twice by the US Supreme Court and twice by the California Supreme Court. Prior to his execution, he was visited by renowned psychiatrist, Holocaust survivor, and author of Man's Search for Meaning, Dr. Viktor Frankl in lieu of last rites. Shortly thereafter, Mitchell held an unorthodox press conference during which he declared in a typewritten statement that \\"I have made my appeal to God and to the Governor. This is my last appeal to Man. Forgive me, for I knew not.\\" The San Francisco Chronicle documented him saying \\"I don't really expect clemency from the Governor and I sympathize with him. He will be under criticism either way, but under much lighter criticism if he fails to act for me.\\" He also feared that his own execution may spur \\"a long new line to the gas chamber.\\" His last words were \\"I am Jesus Christ!\\"\\"Convicted police killer is executed in California\\", time.com; accessed 10 September 2016.

Meitatsu was tutored directly by his father, grand master Meitoku Yagi himself. By training under his father for over fifty years, he was groomed and trained to carry on the legacy of Meibukan Goju-Ryu (hard-soft style) Karate. One of Yagi‚Äôs goals has been to spread Meibukan Goju-Ryu Karate throughout the world. Yagi has lived, worked, initiated new dojos and taught Meibukan in several places outside of Okinawa and around the world. Yagi lived in the US from 1964 to 1970; in Guam 1971 to 1975; in Saipan 1995 to 1997 and in the Philippines 1997 to 1998. After returning from Guam in 1975, Yagi was given the title of Renshi 6th Dan and became a Director of All Okinawan Karate-Do Association in 1976. Also in 1976, he was given the teaching responsibilities at the Hombu Dojo in Okinawa as President of Goju-Ryu Meibu-kai with Meitetsu Yagi (his younger brother) as Vice-President and Meitoku Yagi as Chairman / Consultant. Meitoku Yagi chose his eldest son Meitatsu to be the first to learn all facets of Meibukan Goju-Ryu. He helped develop and teach all the kata, Renzoku Kumite, Kakomi Kumite, Meibukan Bo, Meibukan Sai, Nihon Kumite, Renzoku form and Kakomi forms. Although many profess to be Meibukan practitioners, many have not learned or practiced the forms developed by him for his style. These forms are an integral part of Meibukan Goju-Ryu. Meitatsu was a director of the All Okinawa Karate-Do Gojyu-Kai for 20 years. He also served a two-year term as President of the Okinawan Karate-Do Goju-Kai in 1987 as well as President of the Hombu Dojo in Kume. In 1995 Meitatsu worked in Saipan and the Philippines, returning in 1998 to help care for his father who was ailing at the time. Meitoku Yagi gave Meitatsu Yagi the title of Hanshi Judan, Okinawa Karate-Do Goju-Kai in 1997. Meitoku Yagi presented only one Hanshi Judan. Meitatsu Yagi travels the world meeting and teaching hundreds of people each year in seminars in India, Canada, Israel, Italy, the USA, England and France as well as South America. Meitatsu has also been very active in promoting the Okinawa Traditional Karatedo Kobudo International Studying Center in Yomitan Village, Okinawa. He is working with Kenyu CHINEN of Shorin-Ryu and Yasuo SHIMOJI of Uechi Ryu. All three masters are traditional Okinawan teachers and are working together to promote Okinawa Traditional Karate-Do and Kobudo in Okinawa and around the world. In 2007, he published his second book on the history and philosophy of Meibukan gojyu-ryu, entitled, \\"Importance of Spiritual Karate\\".

Murray in A History of Board-Games Other Than Chess (1898), and attributes its origin to England. Several variants have been created (see Variants section) including one by Murray himself which utilizes different colored pieces with different point values. Several players can participate. In the traditional game, players take any piece on the board and use it to hop over and capture other pieces on the board. When no more pieces can be captured, the game ends, and the player with the most pieces wins the game. Murray includes it in the section called Clearance Games which includes the game Solitaire which it does resemble in many ways except that Solitaire is played by only one person. The game is also known to be spelled as one word, Leapfrog. Murray never stated that the moves are limited to orthogonal directions. The game might still work with diagonal moves.  Setup  A rectangular board with 15 to 18 squares in length on each side is used. The pieces in the traditional variant are undifferentiated. In Murray's variant, the pieces have different colors with different point values. The number of pieces per color are divided as follows: 1 green for every 2 red, for every 3 yellow, for every 4 white. In a 15 x 15 square board that would be 22 green, 45 red, 68 yellow, and 90 white pieces. Green pieces are worth 4 points, red pieces are worth 3 points, yellow pieces are worth 2 points, and white pieces are worth 1 point. The game starts with all the pieces occupying all the squares (or holes) of the board. Only one piece may occupy a square (or hole). Similarly, in Murray's variant the colored pieces are distributed randomly throughout the board occupying all the squares (or holes).  Rules  * Each player removes one piece anywhere from the board for their first capture. This first turn committed by each player need not be taken in any order. * Players then decide the order of their turns, and alternate their turns throughout the game in the same order. * All moves after the first turn of each player must be capturing moves using the short leap method as in draughts. A piece from the board is chosen by a player on their turn, and this chosen piece is used to leap over other piece(s) on the board which are captured and removed immediately from the board. All leaps must be orthogonal (not diagonal). The chosen piece leaps over an orthogonally adjacent piece, and lands on a vacant square (or hole) immediately behind it. The chosen piece can continue capturing more pieces (in the same turn) provided it is able to, but it is not mandatory to capture more than one piece. The chosen piece remains on the board at the end of its leap(s), and that player's turn ends. * If a player cannot capture at least one piece during their turn, the game ends. Players then count the number of pieces they've captured (in the old variant) or calculate the number of points they've earned (in Murray's variant), and the one with the most pieces or points respectively is the winner.  Variants  An online software variant by BrainKing called Froglet is similar to Murray's variant. The only differences are that the size of the board is smaller (only a 12 x 12 square board), the order of play among the players is determined before the game commences and only the first player may remove a piece from anywhere on the board for his or her first move followed by capturing moves by the short leap thereafter by all players, and the color distribution among pieces is different (66 green pieces, 51 yellow pieces, 21 red pieces, and 6 blue pieces) with 1 point for a green, 2 points for a yellow, 3 points for a red, and 4 points for a blue. A variant of Chinese Checkers called Capture resembles the old variant of Leap Frog, except in Capture the six-pointed star-shaped board of Chinese Checkers is used, and specifically only the central hexagon region of the board. In addition, the central point of the board is vacant at the beginning of the game in Capture, whereas the board is completely filled in Leap Frog.

Senechal is an American futurist, biologist, physiologist, applied behavior analyst, university bio-psychology instructor, gender/sexuality, biotech educator, and animal language researcher. Senechal's study interests are: 1) Developing domesticated or captive animal expressive communication (to humans), 2) Psycho-biology (including environmental) of gender/sexual diversity, and 3) Future of biotech and medicine. Senechal uses Positive behavior support (PBS) in Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) and provides ABA Behavioral and Communication Therapy to children, especially those with autism, Aspergers, and speech delays. Senechal adds this tool (ABA) to existing methods (AnimalSign) to benefit and develop skill in animals, such as dogs, horses, elephants, and cats. Education Senechal attended undergraduate programs initially in Physics (theoretical) and Math, but then, after reading the book The Structure of Scientific Revolution, moved into Sociology (of Knowledge) followed by pre-med courses UC Berkeley. Attending California State University in San Francisco in the MA program (in collaboration with the SF Army Presidio) on Biology (Behavior and Physiology), Sean continued graduate Ph.D. work, studying Animal Physiology and Cognition (attention in humans) at UC Davis. Advanced to candidacy and completed research on covert attention in humans. Around this time, Senechal met and fell in love with a yearling horse and developed a deep interest in understanding the horse, directly through the communications of the horse, itself. Senechal began research in evidence-based methods to enable animals to communicate their needs and wants to humans (modeled initially after the techniques used with Koko the Gorilla). During graduate school and shortly after, Senechal worked in the tech world in Silicon Valley, gaining experience as a Quality Assurance Tester, Manager, then Director in various software companies (startups like Planetweb, to large companies such as Borland, Intuit, and General Magic). After the crash of the industry, Sean participated in the Tech- to- Teach programs and gained a teaching credential in Math/Science, working in middle and high school in California. Expertise was in teaching Algebra as a game, leading the middle school class to beat the high school test scores. Later Sean gained experience teaching Special Needs students, which led to following the behaviorist track ABA Applied Behavior Analysis and PBS (Positive Behavioral Support) Certification Courses at the California State University, Monterey Bay. This led to further education at Florida Institute of Technology in their rigorous Applied Behavior Analysis program. Sean became board certified as an Applied Behavior Analyst. Sean Senechal practices, consults, and researches using many techniques (one being ABA), with a special focus on communication (in humans and animals), ASD and Asperger's, behavior challenges, and gender/sexuality. Another focus of Sean's interest is in current and future of biotech advances: Regenerative Medicine advances, and the biological and psychological impact on individuals and society. Sean recently teaches university courses in biology, psychology, and human development: Human Biology and Behavior, Biological Psychology, Developmental Psychology, Behavior Disorders, Microbiology.http://www.csumb.edu CSUMBhttp://www.cc.edu Carrington College Career Software QA Engineer: Senechal's career while in graduate school was as a software tech professional (Quality Assurance for software). Sean started as a tester, manager, then director of software testing in Silicon Valley. Animal Communication: Sean Senechal's major contribution (so far) has been to approach domestic and captive animals as expressive language learners. Sean has attempted to teach zoo and domestic animals additional methods of expressive communication using gestures, signs, and cards. The focus is on exploring, studying, and teaching these animals the productive-expressive language, but also includes expanded cognitive and receptive language skill development. The method applies multiple techniques, some empathetic, some formal and similar to Applied Behavior Analysis Functional Communication Training used with children has been limited but productive. These animals include dogs, horses, cats, and elephants. While many studies have focused on non-human primate language development using lexigramsDr. Susan Savage Rumbaugh and sign language,Dr. Penny Patterson Senechal focuses on promoting expressive (contrived and structured) language development in the animals. AnimalSign study Senechal founded the AnimalSign Center, a language research center and school for non-primate animals.http://www.animalsign.org Sean created the AnimalSign Language used to research and teach animals a new, structured, and gestural language, inspired by the sophisticated language ASL.

A breakthrough method for teaching your dog to communicate to you' was published by a Random House division. In 2013 the Monterey Zoo in California provided a few hours for working with the African elephants. The horse book was due out by Storey Press, who due to the economy (supposedly) decided to hold off. The self-published book is due out in 2015. Several other books will follow.Abstract from Animal Behavior Society Convention, 2012. AnimalSign Language is the umbrella method for teaching communication (productive and receptive) through gestures, like simplified ASL, Picture Exchange Communication System, PECS, tapping, and vocalization. Sean holds AnimalSign Language education classes, workshops, and seminars for human and animal students at the AnimalSign Center, and online courses will be upcoming in 2015. The next project (with crowdfunding) to start in 2015 involves raising multiple Border collie dogs with and without signing, while tracking their neuroanatomy, behavior, and communication skills for their lifetime. First life tracking study of the dog brain, and first to teach and track the impact of language training. Other Academics: During and after graduate school, Sean taught Cell Biology, Anatomy, Physiology, Biology, and related college/university courses. Sean teaches university courses in biology, psychology, and human development: Human Biology and Behavior, Biological Psychology, Developmental Psychology, Behavior Disorders, Microbiology. Future Technology of Medicine is next, incorporating interests in biotech and making it more accessible and affordable. Another focus of Sean's interest is in current and future of biotech advances: Regenerative Medicine advances, and the biological and psychological impact on individuals and society. ''' Sexuality/ Gender Studies:''' In 2013, Sean's interest expanded to studying the growing gender and sexual diversity (especially in youth), its history (especially the transgender bisexual/gay male), impact on individuals, and the psycho- and sociobiological influences. The project (book) is on the Biological Basis and Markers of Sexual and Gender Diversity. The most recent growing phenomenon 'GenderQueer', especially in youth, is of special interest. Is this growing due to biological-environmental, and/or social influences? At the Santa Cruz Diversity Center, Senechal facilitates a GenderQueer support group. Senechal's interest has expanded to teaching and studying the biological basis and markers of gender diversity, especially in the student populations which have become increasingly diverse. This interest expands into the bio/medical/genetic and imaging technology contributing to the understanding and development of timely psychological and biological treatments for gender/sexuality issues. Behaviorist: Sean became board certified as an Applied Behavior Analyst. Sean Senechal practices, consults, and researches using many techniques (one being ABA), with a special focus on communication (in humans and animals), ASD and Asperger's, behavior challenges, and gender/sexuality. Sean has also been consulting as an ABA professional for behavior programs for children, adolescents, adults with autism. Senechal has a private practice (as Coach and ABA professional) working with those with Asperger's, Behavior, and (as Coach) Sexual/Gender issues in Santa Cruz/Monterey area. Works Sean's first work was featured in a Canadian canine magazine CANIS FAMILIARIS in 2008-9 and was shown in conventions such as the Canadian Association of Professional Pet Dog Trainers.http://www.cappdt.ca Sean's book AnimalSign To YouAnimalSign To You.

He died in August 1863, as a result of wounds received in an attack on Fort Wagner, near Charleston, South Carolina. Biography St. George's, a garrison town where the oldest of the British Army Bermuda Garrison's three main camps in Bermuda was located A former clerk, probably from St. George's, Simmons joined the 54th on March 12, 1863. Many black and white Bermudians fought for the Union, mostly in the US Navy. Other black Bermudians who served in the United States Army during the war included Robert Tappin (who had previously served in the US Navy from 1863 to 1864), John Wilson and Joseph Thomas of the 31st Colored Infantry Regiment, John Thompson of the 26th Colored Infantry, Wate O. Harris, of the 6th Coloured Infantry, and George Smith.Fighting to save America's soul. The Royal Gazette. 9 August, 2008The Royal Gazette: Unknown soldier is identified May 31, 2002 (Outerbridge.com) Bermuda's links with the southern states were foundational, with the archipelago having been settled in 1609-1612 by the Virginia Company as an extension of Jamestown, with the Carolinas having been settled from Bermuda in 1670 by settlers under William Sayle, and with most of the 10,000 emigrants from Bermuda between settlement and the gaining of independence by the United States having settled in the South. The ties with Virginia and South Carolina were especially close, and Bermuda's wealthy merchant families had established branches in important Southern Atlantic ports to control trade through those cities and otherwise play important roles (examples including two of the sons of prominent Bermudian Colonel Henry Tucker (1713‚Äì1787), St. George Tucker (1752-1827), and Thomas Tudor Tucker (1745-1828)). The second-oldest surviving house in Charleston, Pink House, was built from Bermudian limestone in at some point between 1694 and 1712. Denmark Vesey also came to Charleston from Bermuda. Less wealthy Bermudians settled sometimes together, founding towns, and there are now many locations in the South that have been named after the islands of Bermuda. The close ties of blood and trade between Bermuda and the South meant most white Bermudians, at least, had strong sympathies with the South and the colony's proximity to southern ports like Charleston made it the ideal location from which to smuggle European manufactured weapons into the South and cotton out. Consequently, many other Bermudians, like Thomas Leslie Outerbridge, profiteered from the war by smuggling arms to the blockaded South. Its close connection to his birthplace was an ironic twist to Simmons' death in Charleston. The black 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment was raised in March 1863 by the Governor of Massachusetts, John A. Andrew. Commanded by Colonel Robert Gould Shaw, it sprang to life after the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation. Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton decided white officers would be in charge of all \\"colored\\" units. Colonel Shaw was hand picked by Governor John Andrew. Governor Andrew also selected Norwood Penrose \\"Pen\\" Hallowell as the unit's second in command. Simmons was introduced to Francis George Shaw, father of Colonel Shaw, by William Wells Brown, a prominent abolitionist lecturer, novelist, playwright, historian and former slave, who described him as \\"a young man of more than ordinary abilities who had learned the science of war in the British Army\\". In his book, The Negro in the American Rebellion, Brown wrote that \\"Francis George Shaw remarked at the time that Simmons would make a 'valuable soldier'. Col. Shaw also had a high opinion of him\\". Bermuda had been defended primarily by Militia from 1612 until the French Revolution, although the regular English Army (subsequently the British Army) had kept a company-strength infantry force there from 1701 until the end of the American War of Independence. The Royal Navy, however, identified Bermuda as the only available replacement for all the bases and seaports it had lost between The Maritimes and the West Indies. Bermuda lies east-southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, south of Cape Sable Island, Canada, and north of Road Town, British Virgin Islands. What would become the headquarters, primary naval base, and dockyard of the North America and West Indies Squadron was established in the colony in 1795, leading to a rapidly growing British Army Bermuda Garrison tasked with protecting the naval base, and keeping the colony out of the hands of an enemy. With the large number of regular soldiers present, the Government of Bermuda allowed the Militia to subside after the American War of 1812, and no amount of cajoling, begging, or threatening by the British Government could move it to replace the military reserve until the 1890s, when the Bermuda Militia Artillery (BMA) and Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps (BVRC) (amalgamated in 1965 into what is now the Royal Bermuda Regiment) were raised. Without the assistance or funds of the colonial government, the Governor (who was also military Commander-in-Chief) and the Bermuda Garrison of the British Army employed many (mostly short-lived) schemes during the intervening decades to recruit Bermudians into the regular army and the Board of Ordnance Military Corps for part-time, local-service, to reinforce the regular soldiers. Most of the volunteers were blacks. The relatively lower volunteering rate of whites was to be a recurring phenomenon as late as the First World War (when the first of the black-recruited BMA's two contingents sent to France numbered 201 officers and other ranks, more than the two First World War and the two Second World War overseas contingents of the all-white BVRC combined...although many white Bermudians also served in the British Home Forces, from which non-whites were generally barred). Simmons probably served under one of these schemes, recruited into the regular army but for local service only, and would have been trained in light infantry tactics. Fort Wagner The Storming of Fort Wagner, the most famous battle fought by the 54th Massachusetts. The regiment gained recognition on July 18, 1863, when it spearheaded an assault on Fort Wagner near Charleston, South Carolina. Colonel Shaw was killed, along with one-hundred and sixteen of his men. Another hundred and fifty-six were wounded or captured. The total casualties of 272 would be the highest total for the 54th in a single engagement during the war. Although they were not able to capture the fort, the 54th was widely acclaimed for its valor, and the event helped encourage the further enlistment and mobilization of African-American troops, a key development that President Abraham Lincoln once noted as helping to secure the final victory. A letter to his wife written by First Sergeant Simmons shortly before the attack on Battery Wagner was published in the New York Tribune on the 23rd of December, 1863.54th Mass.org At roughly the same time as the events that First Sergeant Simmons described took place, his seven year old nephew was murdered in New York during the four days of race riots that followed the 13 July.Workers' Liberty Magazine Black soldiers in America's Second Revolution, Submitted by AWL on 27 June, 2013 First Sergeant Simmons himself was among the casualties of the battle for Fort Wagner. He was wounded and captured by the Confederates. Although not mentioned by name in an article in the 28 July 1863 edition of the weekly Columbus Enquirer, he was described as a Bermudian sergeant, leaving no doubt as to his identity: One of the negroes is a remarkably sprightly fellow from Bermuda where he was educated as a soldier. His position is that of an Orderly Sergeant, but he has lost an arm, and probably one leg will go. A third of the \`glory' for which he says he came to fight, being thus amputated, he will in the future be a wiser man. The others are a mongrel set of trash and very fair representatives of the common type of free Northern negro. Of his own officers, Captain Luis F. Emilio, the most junior Captain of the 54th who had been left in charge during the attack by the deaths or wounding of all of his superiors, in A Brave Black Regiment wrote: It is due, however, to the following-named enlisted men that they be recorded above their fellows for especial merit: [1st] Sgt. Robert J. Simmons, [Col.] Sgt. William H. Carney... Emilio also wrote: First Sergeant Simmons of Company B was the finest-looking soldier in the 54th Mass.--a brave man, and of good education. He was wounded and captured. Taken to Charleston, his [military] bearing impressed even his captors. After suffering amputation of the arm, he died there. Simmons also received special mention by Shaw's successor, Norwood Hallowell's brother, Colonel Hallowell. As Colonel Thomas Wentworth Higginson would write in Massachusetts in the Army and Navy, 1861-65: 1st Sgt. R.J. Simmons... [was] especially complimented in the report of Lt. Col. Hallowell, who was left in command. Simmons was also awarded a private medal. He died of his wounds in August, 1863, at the age of 26.Shaw's Special MentionMilitary History Online, Civil War Genealogy Database: 54th Massachusetts Infantry USA, by Douglass R. Knight Legacy By 1989, Robert Simmons was a forgotten footnote of the history of the 54th Massachusetts. His having fought for glory was not known to the filmmakers who, that year, released the Academy Award-winning film Glory, which told the story of the unit. The film starred Matthew Broderick as Shaw, Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman, Cary Elwes, and Andre Braugher. The film re-established the now- popular image of the combat role African-Americans played in the Civil War, and the unit, often represented in historical battle reenactments, now has the nickname The Glory Regiment.

He served as bishop of the Diocese of Green Bay, Wisconsin from 1915 until his death in 1945. Biography Early life and education Paul Rhode was born in the Kashubian town of Wejherowo (Neustadt), then located in Kingdom of Prussia, German Empire, to Augustin and Krystyna Rhode. His father died while Paul was quite young, and he came to the United States with his mother at age 9, settling in Chicago, Illinois. This fact made him and his mother participants in what is called the Kashubian diaspora. He was educated at St. Mary's College near Louisville, Kentucky, and at St. Ignatius College in Chicago, where he completed his classical and philosophical studies. He completed his theological studies at St. Francis Seminary near Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Ordination and ministry Rhode was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Frederick Katzer on June 17, 1894. His first assignment was as a curate at St. Adalbert Church in Chicago, where he remained for two years. In 1896, he became the first pastor of SS. Peter and Paul Church, a parish for Polish Catholics in the McKinley Park section of Chicago. He was named pastor of St. Michael Church in South Chicago in 1897. Auxiliary Bishop of Chicago On May 22, 1908, Rhode was appointed auxiliary bishop of Chicago and titular bishop of Barca by Pope Pius X. Since he was the first Pole in America to be named a bishop, this occasion was celebrated with special joy by the Polish American community. He received his episcopal consecration on the following July 29 from Archbishop James Edward Quigley, with Bishops Peter Muldoon and Joseph Maria Koudelka serving as co- consecrators. He served as vicar general of the Archdiocese of Chicago from 1909 to 1915. Bishop of Green Bay Following the resignation of Bishop Joseph J.

Santiago Manuel de Alday y Asp√©e (1712, Concepci√≥n ‚Äì 1789, Santiago) was a Chilean Roman Catholic priest. He served as Bishop of Santiago from 1755 to 1788. He is considered the most important bishops of Santiago during the eighteenth century.  Moral diatribes  Alday is best remembered for his frequent polemics on moral issues, and campaigned against particular aspects of women's fashion at the time ‚Äìsuch as short skirts reaching down to the calf of the leg or very short sleeves. He also opposed the opening of the theater in Santiago; he claimed that attending comedies there was a mortal sin. He also condemned the game known as pal√≠n or chueca, a form of field hockey of Mapuche origin, as well as the thick winter clothes worn by some clerics during cold weather, and the use of the sacramental bread by some people as a sealing wax on letters. Alday, in a famous pastoral letter about women's fashions, ordered in 1782 that \\"...all women of whatever station or class extend the length of their clothes, employing round petticoats or half circle shaped skirts both inside and outside of their homes in a manner that reaches their ankles‚Ä¶ and also, in the same manner, that women cover their arms up to the mid-point between the elbow and the wrist every time they leave the home or when they receive visitors at their home.\\"  Administrative work  In 1780, Alday revitalized the building program associated with the Cathedral of Santiago de Chile, placing the program in the hands of the architect Joaqu√≠n Toesca. Alday was also concerned with the building of new churches in South America, including the third church built in the Marian sanctuary of Andacollo as well as the completion and consecration of the principal church in Mendoza, Argentina, in 1760. Alday founded new parishes as he traveled across his extensive diocese, visiting, for example, Copiap√≥ and Cuyo. He founded San L√°zaro (1775) in the suburbs of Santiago, and parishes in more distant areas, such as Paredones (1765), Combarbal√° (1757), Pelarco (1787) and Renca (1764). He organized a diocesan synod in 1763, hoping to enact clerical reforms and discuss the immoral customs of his flock.  Theological work  He received a good education, receiving a doctorate in Law at the University of San Marcos de Lima. He possessed one of the largest libraries in Chile during the colonial era of 2,058 volumes, which today is conserved in the Museum of Carmen de Maip√∫. He wrote various treatises and participated in a discussion on Probabilism, in the synod of Lima of 1772, in which he opposed this philosophy. He was a major participant in this synod.

The western terminus of the route was at an intersection with NY 30 in the hamlet of Paul Smiths within the town of Brighton. Its eastern terminus was at a junction with NY 86 near the Adirondack Regional Airport in the town of Harrietstown. In between, NY 192 served the hamlet of Gabriels. NY 192 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to an alignment extending from Paul Smiths to Bloomingdale. A suffixed route of NY 192, NY 192A, was assigned in the 1950s to provide a signed connection between NY 192 near Gabriels and then-NY 86 in Harrietstown. NY 192A became part of NY 192 in 1980, and NY 192 became part of NY 86 on March 28, 1989. Route description NY 192 began at an intersection with NY 30 in the hamlet of Paul Smiths within the town of Brighton in Franklin County. The highway headed to the northeast, passing Cooler Pond to the south and Church Pond to the north. Just north of Church Pond was Osgood Pond, which was accessible at the first intersection, which was White Pond Road. NY 192 then headed eastward, intersecting with County Route 31 (CR 31, named Jones Pond Road) in the hamlet of Paul Smiths Easy Street. The highway turned to the southeast, intersecting with another county route and passing Brighton Town Park. At the intersection with CR 60 near the park, NY 192 entered Gabriels. NY 86's current western terminus in Paul Smiths. This junction was NY 192's western terminus. NY 192 then continued to the southeast, intersecting with CR 55, its former routing eastward to NY 3 in Bloomingdale. At CR 55, NY 192 curved southward and passed into the town of Harrietstown. The route ended shortly afterward at a junction with NY 86 in the hamlet of Harrietstown east of the Adirondack Regional Airport. History When NY 3 was assigned in 1924, it followed a significantly different routing through the North Country than it does today. NY 3 entered Franklin County near Hogansburg and served Malone, Paul Smiths, Gabriels, and Harrietstown before leaving the county near Saranac Lake. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY 3 was rerouted east of Watertown to follow its modern alignment through the North Country. The portion of NY 3's former routing from Harrietstown to a junction southeast of Gabriels was designated as NY 408 while the segment between Paul Smiths and the vicinity of Gabriels became part of NY 192, an east‚Äìwest highway extending from Paul Smiths to the realigned NY 3 in Bloomingdale. The junction of modern NY 86 and NY 186 in Harrietstown, NY 192's final eastern terminus NY 408 and the eastern half of NY 192 were included as part of NY 365 . The new route extended from NY 5 southwest of Oneida to U.S. Route 9 (US 9) in Plattsburgh. NY 365 initially overlapped both NY 192 and NY 408; however, NY 408 was removed , leaving only NY 365 on the Harrietstown‚ÄìGabriels roadway. NY 192, meanwhile, continued to overlap NY 365 from Gabriels to Bloomingdale. In the mid-1940s, NY 365 was rerouted between Wawbeek and Bloomingdale to overlap NY 3 instead. The portion of NY 365's former routing from Harrietstown to Gabriels was not initially assigned a new designation. The Harrietstown‚ÄìGabriels highway became a signed route once again in the early 1950s when it became NY 192A. Both NY 192 and NY 192A remained unchanged through the late 1970s. On January 7, 1980, NY 192A was supplanted by a realigned NY 192. Maintenance of NY 192's former routing between Gabriels and Bloomingdale was transferred to the counties it ran through‚Äînamely Franklin and Essex‚Äîin stages. The Franklin County portion was given to the county on April 1, 1980, while the section in Essex County was transferred to county control on April 1, 1985, as part of highway maintenance swaps between the state of New York and Franklin and Essex counties. On March 28, 1989, NY 192 was supplanted by a realigned NY 86.

He published his works under the pen name Gisander. Schnabel was born in Sandersdorf near Bitterfeld, Germany. Orphaned in 1694, he was raised by relatives.Meid, Volker: Reclams Lexikon der deutschsprachigen Autoren, Stuttgart 2001 After an apprenticeship to a barber from 1706 to 1709, Schnabel worked as a Feldsher, a military barber-surgeon, in the regiments of Wolfenb√ºttel and Saxony until 1717.Biography on the website of the Johann Gottfried Schnabel Society In this capacity he took part in the War of the Spanish Succession. In 1719, Schnabel settled as a master barber in Querfurt. From 1724 he was court barber in the County of Stolberg- Wernigerode, where he was promoted to valet de chambre in 1729 and to court agent around 1737. The year 1750 shows the last record of Schnabel's life; his death date and place are unknown. Insel Felsenburg Title page of the 1731 edition of Insel Felsenburg Map of Insel Felsenburg The Insel Felsenburg (literally: Rock Castle Island) was originally published in 1731 under the title :Wunderliche Fata einiger Seefahrer, absonderlich Alberti Julii, eines geborenen Sachsens, welcher in seinem 18den Jahre zu Schiffe gegangen, durch Schiff-Bruch selb 4te an eine grausame Klipe geworffen worden, nach deren √úbersteigung das sch√∂nste Land entdeckt, sich daselbst mit seiner Gef√§hrtin verheyrathet, aus solcher Ehe eine Familie mit mehr als 300 Seelen erzeuget, das Land vortrefflich angebauet, durch besondere Zuf√§lle erstaunens-w√ºrdige Sch√§tze gesammlet, seine in Teutschland ausgekundschafften Freunde gl√ºcklich gemacht, am Ende des 1728sten Jahres, als in seinem Hunderten Jahre, annoch frisch und gesund gelebt, und vermuthlich noch zu dato lebt, entworffen Von dessen Bruders-Sohnes-Sohnes-Sohne, Mons. Eberhard Julio, Curieusen Lesern aber zum vermuthlichen Gem√ºths-Vergn√ºgen ausgefertiget, auch par Commission dem Drucke √ºbergeben Von Gisandern. The title was only in 1828 shortened into Insel Felsenburg when republished in an abridged version by German romanticist Ludwig Tieck. The title summarizes the book. It is about a seaman who is shipwrecked on the coast of an island, where he marries and starts a family of 300. It combines themes of the then-popular genre of the robinsonade with elements of a social utopia. The book was highly successful when it was published. German author Arno Schmidt wrote in a review to a reissue of the book: \\"It is attested that around and after 1750 the library of a commoner consisted of at least two volumes: the Bible and the Insel Felsenburg.\\" Review of the 1960 reissue Due to the success of the original work, Schnabel published three sequels of decreasing quality.

It lies on the river My≈õla (), approximately south-east of Boleszkowice (), south-west of My≈õlib√≥rz (), and south of the regional capital Szczecin (Stettin). It is located at the junction of voivodeship road 127 and national road 31. The village has a population of 222. Chwarszczany Chapel Facade of the church and former Templar chapel The origins of this chapel lie in the gift to the Knights Templar of 1,000 hides of land (1 hide is approximately 17 hectares) by W≈Çadys≈Çaw Odonic, Duke of Greater Poland, in 1232.Wilhelm Ferdinand Wilcke: Geschichte des Ordens der Tempelherren. Vol. 2, Halle 1860, p. 43 (in German). This land was in the Kostrzyn () region and centred on the town. This donation fulfilled more than simply religious reasons, as it provided a safeguard in a borderland and enabled the settlement of the area. The Dukes of Pomerania, however, considered this whole district as belonging to their castle of Kinice, and not to Kostrzyn and Santok. In order not to become expelled from the area they hurried to make their own donation. Thus, in 1234 Barnim I, the Duke of Pomerania, gave the Templars a further 200 hides which were centered on Dargomy≈õl (), pointing out that this land is located in his own territory.Georg Wilhelm von Raumer: Die Neumark Brandenburg im Jahre 1337 oder Markgraf Ludwig's des Aelteren \`Neum√§rkisches Landbuch¬¥ aus dieser Zeit.

It is not known where the Templars of Chwarszczany came from, but it may have been the Silesian commandery in Ole≈õnica Ma≈Ça. In 1241 the property portfolio of the Templars was expanded with the addition Lubno and Oborzany, donated by W≈Çast, a Polish magnate. By the middle of the 13th century, the Brandenburg margraves of the Ascanian dynasty gained control of the property. Following disputation, in 1261 an agreement was reached between the Templars and the margraves: the Templars ceded rights to a commandery in My≈õlib√≥rz, and gave up lands situated by the road from Kostrzyn to Gorz√≥w. In return they received confirmation of the possession of Chwarszczany with ten villages with the addition of the village of Kale≈Ñsko. In 1286 Otto VI, Margrave of Brandenburg-Salzwedel, entered the monastery in the town, giving the commandery greater significance. In the 1290s Bernhard von Eberstein became the Templar preceptor of Poland, Neumark, Bohemia and Moravia. In 1308, the member of the order G√ºnther von K√∂then sold the village of Cychry belonging to the commandery to two brothers of the rich Hokemann family of Frankfurt upon Oder.Heinrich Berghaus: Landbuch der Mark Brandenburg und des Margrafenthums Nieder-Lausitz in der Mitte des 19.

Most species occur in Guatemala and its surroundings, particularly Mexico, but the midget livebearer (H. formosa) comes from the southeastern United States. Though many Poecilidae are familiar aquarium fishes, e.g. guppies, mollies, platys and swordtails, species within Heterandria are not commonly kept as fish. Somewhat more frequently found in aquaria is H. formosa, perhaps because it is one of the smallest known fish species in the world; its diminutive males are probably the smallest fish easy to keep as a pet. Species in this genus resemble egg-laying Cyprinodontoidei such as Fundulidae (topminnows) at first glance, and are thus sometimes called \\"killifish\\" though this is technically erroneous.FishBase (2009): Heterandria species. Retrieved April 8, 2009.

This exercise is an isolation exercise which isolates shoulder flexion. It primarily works the anterior deltoid, with assistance from the serratus anterior, biceps brachii and clavicular portions of the pectoralis major. The front raise is normally carried out in three to five sets during a shoulder workout. Repetitions depend on the lifter's training program and goals. Form To execute the exercise, the lifter stands with their feet shoulder width apart and weights or resistance handles held by their side with a pronated (overhand) grip. The movement is to bring the arms up in front of the body to eye level and with only a slight bend in the elbow. This isolates the anterior deltoid muscle (front of the shoulder) and uses the anterior deltoid to lift the weight. A neutral grip, similar to that used in the hammer curl, can also be used. With this variation the weight is again raised to eye level, but out to a 45 degree angle from the front of the body.

Early years Taylor was born in Bloomington, Illinois. His father managed the Dreamland Theatre in Kewanee, Illinois, and a news item in 1916 reported, \\"Manager Chris Taylor of Dreamland at Kewanee features his son, E. Forrest Taylor, in Western pictures every Monday.\\" Career Stage Taylor was a veteran of the stage by the time he started appearing as a silent lead in both short and feature-length films. His talents extended beyond acting to include management. The Richfield Reaper, in a January 23, 1908, article, wrote about Taylor's efforts with the Empire Amusement Company, saying, \\"Mr. Taylor certainly deserves success as when he took hold of the company it was badly disorganized and in debt, but he has brought order out of the chaos and is now in good shape ...\\" A newspaper article published in The Arizona Republic on October 13, 1922, described Taylor and Anne Berryman as \\"two of the best known players in the western portion of the country.\\" At that time, Taylor headed his own troupe after having spent nine months with the Majestic Theatre Players in Los Angeles. Taylor's Broadway credits include Open House (1947) and We, the People (1932). Film Taylor essayed prime roles in the films The Terror of Twin Mountains (1915), Sunset Country (1915), April (1916), True Nobility (1916) and The Abandonment (1916), before joining the army during World War I. He would not return to films until 1926, appearing in A Poor Girl's Romance. During the 1930s, Taylor became entrenched as a supporting player in B-westerns and several cliffhanger serials, often playing either the action or brains heavy roles. As he grew older and grayer, Taylor migrated to nice guy roles, such as the father of the heroine, a lawman, or a scientist. Taylor is identified in about 400 films, including 325 sound era films and of those, 201 are westerns and 36 are chapterplays, according to the Internet Movie Database. As well, his credits at Republic Pictures number about 75 for the period 1937-1953 (most all of these are B-westerns and serials). His last film was Bitter Creek (1954). Television After the westerns and serials faded Taylor migrated to television work. From 1952 through 1954, he costarred as Grandpa Fisher on the religious TV series This is the Life. In 1960 Taylor appeared as the Minister on the TV western Cheyenne in the episode titled \\"The Long Rope.\\" He retired in 1963 after filming an episode of Ripcord. Personal life Taylor was married to actress Ada Daniels, and the two appeared together in stage productions. They had a son and a daughter.  Death  Taylor died of natural causes on February 19, 1965, in Garden Grove, California, at the age of 81.
