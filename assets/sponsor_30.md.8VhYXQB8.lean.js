Rae Rearwin was an American businessman who had developed several successful business ventures in the Salina, Kansas area in the early 20th century. Although he had no experience with aircraft manufacturing (and no pilot training), he felt that he could succeed with his solid business acumen. With his two sons, Ken and Royce, he hired some engineers and built the Ken-Royce in a garage in Salina. The business moved to the Fairfax Airport in Kansas City, Kansas, and went through several variations before it was sold to Commonwealth Aircraft in 1942, which went bankrupt in 1946. History Rae Rearwin had toured Wichita aircraft manufacturers in the summer of 1927 with his teenage sons Royce and Ken and became convinced he could improve on what he saw. He investigated buying an existing firm, but none were interested in selling, so he tried to hire Herb Rawdon away from the Travel Air Corporation. Rawdon wasn't interested but suggested an engineer who might be. The company started construction in an old garage in Salina, Kansas, the Rearwin's hometown. The company's first prototype, the Rearwin Ken-Royce was finished on January 1929. Rearwin moved the operation to the Fairfax Airport] in Kansas City, Kansas in early 1929. While the Ken-Royce prototype engaged in publicity tours and races, Rae Rearwin sought an investor to fund operations. A Kansas City oilman provided funds and Rae formed a joint venture with him, naming the company Rearwin Airplanes. Rearwin Airplanes would produce both the Ken-Royce and the Rearwin Junior, although the Great Depression ultimately caused orders for both to dry up. In 1933, Rae started a new sole proprietorship using the idle Rearwin Airplanes factory and equipment, which was named Rearwin Aircraft. Rearwin Aircraft focused on producing the high performance Rearwin Speedster and the lower-cost Rearwin Sportster. The company became Rearwin Aircraft & Engines upon acquiring LeBlond Aircraft Engine Corporation, a maker of small radial engines which Rearwin used in several of their products. The division was renamed Ken-Royce Engines Company. Rearwin Aircraft & Engines introduced their Cloudster in 1939, which was further developed into a specialized instrument trainer for airlines. To stay current, Rearwin's last product, the Skyranger adopted the new horizontally-opposed engine instead of the small radial engines the company produced and was experienced with. The company was sold to investor Frank Cohen's Empire Ordnance company in 1942 and became Commonwealth Aircraft, which would acquire Columbia Aircraft Corporation and move to their former plant in Valley Stream, New York. While Ken and Royce had always been involved in the Rearwin company, they were not interested in taking over the business. Rearwin Aircraft & Engines' investments and specialty in small radial engines left them poorly positioned for the coming age of horizontally- opposed engines that would dominate after World War II. Before selling the company, the Rearwins had negotiated contracts to make Waco CG-3A and CG-4A. This required physical expansions, and 2000 employees would eventually be hired. Other war contracts included dies and punches for Remington Arms and glider tow releases. By the end of World War II, 1,470 of the CG-4A gliders had been built, making Rearwin/Commonwealth the third-largest manufacturer of the type. Commonwealth Aircraft resumed production of the Skyranger in 1945 at the Fairfax plant, before moving production to New York. The company went bankrupt in 1946 and was dissolved by March 1947. Products=Rearwin Aircraft ;Ken-Royce :Named after his two sons (and a play on the Rolls- Royce name that meant quality products), this 2-seat biplane flew in January 1929. The Ken-Royce was powered by a 170HP Curtiss Challenger radial engine. Only one known example of the type exists today. ;Junior :This small high-wing monoplane was designed to be inexpensive and easily approachable. It resembled an American Eaglet and was produced as the model 3000 and model 4000. Only one known example of the type exists today. ;Speedster :Originally designed in 1934, this modern-looking airplane was narrow and impressive looking. However, it was unable to pass the stringent aircraft spin tests for several years. A young engineer named Bob Rummell was brought in to solve the problem (and did), but the delay to market proved fatal and only about 11 were made, since less expensive models were already available. However, the Speedster remains one of Rearwin's most exciting designs, as demonstrated by the numerous model kits that were produced for the modeling and R/C enthusiasts. ;Sportster :Many Sportsters were exported to South America, Africa and Australia due to its large 24-gallon (91 liter) fuel capacity. The Siamese (Thai) air force bought several. A Sportster variant called the GV-38 was produced by the Gotaverken Shipyard in Sweden in 1938. As many as 15 may have been built, with 4 known to still exist in museums in Denmark and Sweden. ;Cloudster Rearwin 8135 Cloudster :This side-by-side model offered more cabin room than the Speedster and was popular with enthusiasts and as a trainer (model 8135T). The trainer was used by the Rearwin flight school and also by TWA and Pan American Airways. Juan Trippe, founder of PAA, owned a Sportster and later a Cloudster. One of Ken Rearwin's largest sales was 25 Cloudsters to Iran in 1941. Approximately 124 Cloudsters were built. ;Skyranger :The Skyranger was Rearwin's last design.Juptner, Joseph P.: U.S. Civil Aircraft Series Volume 8, ATC 701-800 TAB Books, 1994 It was popular due to its easy and stable flight characteristics. Serial numbers in the 1500s were built by Rearwin prior to the company's 1942 sale. The post-warCommonwealth Skyranger was essentially the same aircraft with minor modifications. Ken-Royce Engine Company Rearwin's aircraft mainly used small radial engines, so in 1937 when the R. K. LeBlond Machine Tool Company offered to sell their engine division, which specialized in small radial engines, Rearwin bought the assets. The sale was made at a steeply discounted price, to give the LeBlond company a tax write- off, and gave Rearwin an in-house source of small radial engines for their aircraft.

This usually involves charging hydrogen as a tracer gas into the device undergoing testing, with any leaking gas detected by hydrogen sensors. Various test mechanisms have been devised. Test mechanisms= Hydrostatic test  In the hydrostatic test, a vessel is filled with a nearly incompressible liquid ‚Äì usually water or oil ‚Äì and examined for leaks or permanent changes in shape. The test pressure is always considerably higher than the operating pressure to give a margin for safety, typically 150% of the operating pressure.  Burst test  In the burst test, a vessel is filled with a gas and tested for leaks. The test pressure is always considerably more than the operating pressure to give a margin for safety, typically 200% or more of the operating pressure.  Helium leak test  The helium leak test uses helium (the lightest inert gas) as a tracer gas and detects it in concentrations as small as one part in 10 million. The helium is selected primarily because it penetrates small leaks readily, is inert and will not react with the test piece while having a naturally low quantity in air making detection less complicated. It is possible to detect leaks as small as 5.10‚àí10 Pa¬∑m3/s in vacuum mode and modern digital machines can detect 5.10‚àí10 Pa¬∑m3/s in sniffing mode.  Vacuum test  Usually a vacuum inside the object is created with an external pump connected to the instrument. Alternatively helium can be injected inside the product while the product itself is enclosed in a vacuum chamber connected to the instrument. In this case, burst and leakage tests can be combined in one operation.  Hydrogen sensor test  During the hydrogen sensor test, the object is filled with a mixture of 5% hydrogen/ 95% nitrogen, (below 5.7% hydrogen) is non- flammable (ISO-10156). This is called typically a sniffing test. The handprobe connected to the microelectronic hydrogen sensors is used to check the object. An audiosignal increases in proximity of a leak. Detection of leaks go down to 5x10‚àí7 cubic centimeters per second. Compared to the helium test, hydrogen is cheaper than helium, no need for a vacuum, the instrument could be cheaper but is not as sensitive as a helium leak detector so will not find smaller leaks. Chemo-chromic hydrogen leak detectors are materials that can be proactively applied to a connection or fitting. In the event of a hydrogen leak, the chemo-chromic material changes color to alert an inspector that a leak is present. Chemo-chromic indicators can also be added to silicone tapes for hydrogen detection purposes.

History A portrait of the younger William Penn Foundation William Penn, a son of an admiral in the Royal Navy, also William Penn, was an early convert to Quakerism, and a friend of the religion's founder, George Fox. Like many early members of the Society of Friends, Penn faced imprisonment and persecution for his beliefs, although he was spared harsh treatment in the British judicial system due to his family's stature. Penn was also an early investor in the Americas, where he co-owned much of what would later become the state of New Jersey along with fourteen other Quaker investors. Due to his investment in New Jersey, Penn developed an interest in developing another colony in the Americas, one where Quakers and other persecuted European religious minorities could coexist. Upon his father's death, Penn had inherited a sizable debt originally owed to his father by King Charles II in exchange for several loans to the crown and years of back pay. In exchange for the negation of the debt, Charles agreed to grant Penn a large amount of land, located south of the Province of New York and north of the Province of Maryland.Foner, p. 95 At 29 million acres, the land grant made Penn the largest non-monarchical land owner in the world.Kenny, p. 2 After the land grant, Penn began to exert control over his colony, which he named Sylvania and King Charles named Pennsylvania (meaning \\"Penn's woods\\"), \\"in honour of [his] father\\".Dobr√©e He now tried to attract settlers to Pennsylvania and make a profit off his newly founded colony. Penn did a brilliant job of advertising Pennsylvania, and it quickly became the most famous colony in England and the rest of Europe alike. Penn sought to create the Holy Experiment in Pennsylvania and did so by creating a liberal frame of government, attracting all sorts of people, including many Quakers, who made up the Holy Experiment. Failure Ultimately, tensions between the Quaker population and the growing population of non-Quakers within Pennsylvania resulted in the secularization of the province's government, and the end of the Quaker-led government.Brock Since the colony's foundation, Pennsylvania had relied on a series of treaties with local and Northeastern Native American populations to ensure peace, as the raising of a militia would have defied Quaker peace testimony. As the Iroquois and tribes loyal to their Confederacy began to align themselves with the French, rather than the British, Pennsylvanian citizens demanded the formation of a state-backed militia to protect population centers.Brock This tension led to the resignation and voting out of Quaker leaders, effectively ending Quaker rule of the colony, and the end of the Experiment.

Playing career=St. Louis Cardinals In 1969, Stein began his professional baseball career in the St. Louis Cardinals minor league organization. The Cardinals assigned him to the Tulsa Oilers, who were their Triple-A affiliates at the time.

He played the majority of the season in the outfield, but also spent limited time at third base, first base, and shortstop. To start the 1972 season, Stein was a member of the Triple-A Tulsa Oilers. With Tulsa that year, he batted .278 with 100 hits, 26 doubles, four triples, five home runs, and 36 RBIs in 103 games played. Stein was a September call-up for the St. Louis cardinals that year.

He made his season debut on April 6 as a pinch hitter, going hitless in one at- bat against the Pittsburgh Pirates. His first hit of the season came on April 17, against the Pirates. In August, Stein was sent down to the minor leagues and was replaced on the Cardinals major league roster by outfielder H√©ctor Cruz. In the minors, he played with the Triple-A Tulsa Oilers, where he batted .289 with 23 hits, two doubles, and one triple in 21 games played. While in the majors that season, Stein compiled a .218 batting average with four runs scored, 12 hits, two doubles, and two RBIs in 32 games played. On defense with the Cardinals, he played right field, left field, third base, and first base. Chicago White Sox On September 25, Stein was traded by the St. Louis Cardinals to the California Angels in exchange for Jerry DaVanon. California then traded Stein to the Chicago White Sox on April 3, 1974, before he made an appearance in the Angels organization. In return, the White Sox sent Steve Blateric to California. Stein started the 1974 season in the White Sox minor league system with the Triple-A Iowa Oaks. In 135 games with Iowa, he batted .326 with 107 runs scored, 178 hits, 32 doubles, eight triples, 16 home runs, and 76 RBIs. Stein led the American Association in hits; was second in runs scored, plate appearances (594), at-bats (554), and doubles; and was tied for second in triples. He was called up by Chicago in September. Stein made his season debut on September 13, against the California Angels, getting no hits in four at-bats. His first hit of the season came the day after, against California. In the majors that year, Stein batted .276 with five runs scored, 12 hits, one double, and five RBIs in 13 games played. Stein spent his first full season in the majors during the 1975 season. His season debut came on April 16, against the Texas Rangers, where in one at-bat he went hitless. In June, Stein was named the starting third baseman after Bill Melton, who was Chicago's regular third baseman, was benched for poor hitting. Stein also played back-up for second baseman Jorge Orta over the season. On July 20, in the second game of a doubleheader against the Milwaukee Brewers, Stein hit his first career grand slam. On the season, Stein batted .270 with 23 runs scored, 61 hits, seven doubles, one triple, three home runs, and 21 RBIs in 76 games played. In the field, he played 28 games at second base, 24 games at third base, and one game in left field. Stein also played 18 games that year at the designated hitter spot in the lineup. Stein played his final season with the Chicago White Sox in 1976. On August 17, in the first game of a doubleheader against the Boston Red Sox, he hit a game-winning single in the ninth inning to score Pat Kelly. In August, United Press International noted that it was the first time in his major league career that Stein was getting a chance to start regularly. During the season, he compiled a .268 batting average with 32 runs scored, 105 hits, 15 doubles, two triples, four home runs, and 36 RBIs in 117 games played. Stein played 58 games at second base, 58 games at third base, one game at first base, one game in right field, and one game at shortstop. He was also the designated hitter in one game during that season. Seattle Mariners During the 1976 Major League Baseball expansion draft, Stein was selected by the Seattle Mariners, who took him with their third pick in the draft. Stein stated he was \\"glad\\" that the Mariners drafted him, because he did not like playing at Comiskey Park, the home of his previous team, the Chicago White Sox. He was profiled by the Associated Press during spring training in 1977, and was interviewed about his new team and his unique versatility in the field. Stein mentioned to the reporter that although he had played a wide variety of positions in the past, he hoped he would get a chance to be the Mariners starting third baseman. In a win against the Boston Red Sox on May 3, Stein hit two home runs in the same game. In June, Stein commented on how he liked starting every day at third base for the Mariners. The Mariners manager, Darrell Johnson, Praised Stein for playing \\"good ball\\" with Seattle. On July 8, in a game against the Minnesota Twins, Stein had another two-home run performance, his second of the season. In early-September, Stein got hit in the shoulder by a baseball, which was later revealed to have caused a hairline fracture. With the Mariners that year, he batted .259 with 53 runs scored, 144 hits, 26 doubles, five triples, 13 home runs, and 67 RBIs in 151 games played. Defensively, the vast majority of his games (147) were played at third base, but he also played limited time at shortstop. He led the American League in putouts by a third baseman with 146. Stein was also fifth in the league in defensive games at third base. Stein, circa 1977 Before the start of the 1978 season, Stein re-signed with the Seattle Mariners. His contract meant he was now signed through the 1980 season. In May 1978, he bruised his left hand, which caused him to miss some playing time. On August 25, he broke up Dennis Mart√≠nez's potential no-hitter in the seventh inning of a game against the Baltimore Orioles. On August 28, in a game against the Boston Red Sox, Stein had a season-high four hits. On the season, he batted .261 with 41 runs scored, 105 hits, 24 doubles, four triples, four home runs, and 37 RBIs in 114 games played. In the field, Stein played 67 games at third base, 17 games at second base, and three games at shortstop. His 24 errors at third base was second in the American League. Early into the 1979 season, Stein was placed on the disabled list after suffering a rib injury. Charlie Beamon, Jr. was called up from the minor leagues to replace Stein during his injury. In late June, the Mariners activated Stein from the disabled list. By the time he had returned, the Mariners had already positioned Dan Meyer at his position, so Stein filled in at second base during his first game back. That year, Stein batted .248 with 28 runs scored, 62 hits, nine doubles, two triples, seven home runs, and 27 RBIs in 88 games played. As a fielder, he played 67 games at third base, 17 games at second base, and three games at shortstop. Stein's final season with the Seattle Mariners would come in 1980. On April 29, against the Minnesota Twins, Stein had a season high four hit game. He matched that high on July 26, against the Toronto Blue Jays. On July 28, Stein broke up a no-hit bid by Cleveland Indians pitcher Len Barker. In his final season with the Mariners, Stein batted .268 with 16 runs scored, 53 hits, five doubles, one triple, five home runs, and 27 RBIs in 67 games played. Defensively, he played 34 games at third base, 14 games at second base, and eight games at first base. He also played five games that season as Seattle's designated hitter. Texas Rangers In December 1980, Stein was signed as a free agent by the Texas Rangers. Stein made his Rangers debut on April 14, 1981, against the Cleveland Indians. In that game, he got one hit in two at- bats. In May, Stein set an American League record by recording seven consecutive pinch hits. Through June, Stein had a .441 batting average. On the season, Stein batted .330 with 21 runs scored, 38 hits, six doubles, two home runs, and 22 RBIs in 53 games played. In the field, he played 20 games at first base, seven games at third base, seven games in left field, three games at second base, one game in right field, and one game at shortstop. On April 16, 1982, in a game against the Milwaukee Brewers, Stein hit a game-winning double in the top of the ninth inning. In June, while playing against his former team, the Seattle Mariners, Stein praised their pitching staff. In 85 games that year, Stein batted .239, the lowest average of his career since the 1972 season where he played with the St. Louis Cardinals. He also compiled 14 runs scored, 44 hits, eight doubles, one home run, and 16 RBIs. In the field, he played 34 games at second base, 28 games at third base, six games at shortstop, two games at first base, and one game in left field. Stein also was the designated hitter during three games. In March 1983, Stein praised the Texas Rangers new manager, Doug Rader, for working on the game in a \\"serious\\" way. On May 18, in a game against the Cleveland Indians, Stein was brought in as a pinch hitter during the 14 inning, and proceeded to get the game-winning hit for the Rangers. With Texas that year, he batted .310 with 21 runs scored, 72 hits, 15 doubles, one triple, two home runs, and 33 RBIs in 78 games played. Stein played the majority of his games at second base, but also played first base and third base. He was used as the Rangers designated hitter in six contests that year. After the season, Stein spoke out against a transaction that the Rangers made, trading Jim Sundberg to the Milwaukee Brewers, calling him a \\"mainstay of the organization\\". In 1984, the Associated Press stated that Stein was one of the American League's best pinch hitters. Early into the season, he injured his wrist, which caused him to miss some playing time. In mid-June, the Rangers activated him from the disabled list. On the season, Stein batted .279 with three runs scored, 12 hits, one double and three RBIs in 27 games played. Stein played 11 games at second base, three games at first base, and three games at third base. He also spent four games as the Rangers designated hitter. Before the 1985 season, it was announced that the Texas Rangers had traded Stein to the Pittsburgh Pirates in exchange for a player to be named later, pending a physical. The Pirates later canceled the trade after team doctors discovered a \\"probable disc problem\\" in his back. Rumors then circulated that it was possible that Steins' career would be ended by the injury. However, Stein did play 44 games with the Rangers that season, batting .253 with five runs scored, 20 hits, three doubles, one triple, one home run, and 12 RBIs. He played 11 games at third base, eight games at first base, three games at second base, and three games in right field. Stein was the team's designated hitter in six games that year. In his final season in the majors, he earned a salary of $250,000 ($ inflation adjusted). At the end of the season, Texas announced that it would not re-sign Stein. Through an agent, Stein commented that if he could not play for Texas in the upcoming season, he would retire. Coaching career In 1987, Stein coached the Rockledge High School baseball team, leading them a district title with a 17‚Äì11 record. Stein was hired as the manager of the Class A-Short Season Little Falls Mets of the New York‚ÄìPenn League in 1988. Little Falls were minor league affiliates of the New York Mets. In his first professional season as a manager, Stein led Little Falls to a 39‚Äì36 record. Stein commented that when he became a manager it was difficult to learn pitching after all the years of being a position player. In 1989, the New York Mets fired Butch Hobson, the manager of the Class-A Columbia Mets, and promoted Stein to that position. At the helm of Colombia that year, Stein led them to a 73‚Äì67 record. He also served as a player-coach with the Orlando Juice of the Senior Professional Baseball Association in 1989. Stein continued to manage the Columbia Mets in 1990, leading them to an 83‚Äì60 record. The Mets had the best record in the South Atlantic League that season. In 1991, Stein was hired to be the manager of the Bend Bucks of the Northwest League. The non-affiliated Bucks had a record of 30‚Äì46 with Stein as the manager. He was hired to be the manager of the Clinton Giants in 1992. Clinton was the Class-A affiliate of the San Francisco Giants at the time. Stein led Clinton to a 59‚Äì79 record that year. After considering taking a year off of baseball in 1994, Stein eventually accepted the managerial position with the independent league Tyler WildCatters. He recently relocated and lives in Palm Coast Florida, where he has been an infielder in the Flagler (County) Senior Softball League.

Starting as his assistant in 1981, Garrin eventually emerged as one of the important collaborators of video art superstar Nam June Paik, working closely from 1982 to 1996. Since the 1990s, Garrin has carried his politicized style of action art-making onto the Internet, founding companies and projects that work to free the Internet from corporate and government control. His work spans between the highest technology available and hands-on street video, all for a common political cause. The New York Times art critic Grace Glueck describes Paul Garrin as a politically active video artist. Founded in 1996, Garrin's social enterprise Name.Space is among the earliest Internet top-level domain registries offering affordable and expressive TLDs. Manifested in the Name.Space.Charter, Name.Space champions freedom of speech, and free, self- supporting commerce as an important counterbalance to government's monopoly powers. Presently, Name.Space is challenging the status-quo in an antitrust lawsuit with ICANN. In 2003, Garrin launched WiFi-NY, an independent, cooperative community wireless broadband network that serves downtown Manhattan and Brooklyn. He continues to live and work in the Lower East Side since the borough's last decades of creative production. Early life and education Garrin grew up in Pennsauken, New Jersey, in what he describes as a 50's cheap housing boom neighborhood, like something out of an archetypal twilight zone landscape. His understanding of hard times has its roots in childhood experience, when it became necessary for his family to seek public assistance due to his father's joblessness. A registered nurse, his mother got his family through hard times. Surrounded by a conformist mindset that seemed to care for little beyond sports, Garrin studied art as a way out. He took night classes at the Philadelphia College of Art, and worked at an offset printing shop in the day to support himself. Garrin began working with video while studying fine arts at the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art in New York City (1977‚Äì82) where he enrolled after two years of classical art training in painting, drawing, sculpture, materials, and printmaking at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia (1977). At Cooper Union, Garrin studied with many well-known artists including Hans Haacke, Vito Acconci, Robert Breer and Martha Rosler, all of whom had a major impact on Garrin's aesthetics and critical social content in his works. In 2001, Paul Garrin (A'82), was awarded the Cooper Union President Citation for outstanding attainments and contributions to his profession, and was inducted into the Cooper Union Alumni Hall of Fame. Video & Media Artworks=Art Videotapes Garrin belongs to the second generation of video artists whose works mix technological innovation with social criticism. Along with Jenny Holzer, Julia Scher, Lowell Darling, Laurie Anderson, Nam June Paik, Nayland Blake and Douglas Davis, Garrin was among a promising group of autonomous artists creating far-ranging works of art within the Web, tapping into the potential of the Web as a creative medium, thereby transcending the basic nature of the medium at the time. From the time he was a student at Cooper Union, Paul's video works focused on single and double channel pieces. After graduation, Garrin's work was heavily influenced by the experimental works of Nam June Paik. This influence is seen emerging in such works as \\"A Place to Hide\\", 1985, and a series of pieces in collaboration with musician and composer Ryuichi Sakamoto and video artist Kit Fitzgerald sponsored by SONY Corporation, 1985‚Äì86, most notably \\"A Human Tube\\". In 1988, Garrin created one of his most groundbreaking videos entitled \\"Free Society\\" featuring original music by downtown composer and musician Elliott Sharp. Featuring uniquely layered digital effects and hand-cutout images edited in a staccato pace that reflects the violence and brutality of the subject matter, \\"Free Society\\" went on to win numerous awards, was featured in video and film festivals around the world, and is in the permanent collection of the U.S. Library of Congress. It also contains footage from his 1988 video of the Tompkins Square Park Police Riot. =Art Videography= * A Place to Hide, 1985 * A Human Tube, 1985‚Äì86 with Ryuichi Sakamoto * Free Society, 1988 * Man with a Video Camera (Fuck Vertov), 1989 * Reverse Big Brother & Home(Less) is Where the Revolution is, 1990 * By Any Means Necessary, 1990 Fashion Video Between the years 1984 to 1997, Garrin was among the pioneers in the field of fashion videography. He worked with a number of popular fashion designers of the day. Highly attuned to the arts, they hired Garrin because of his background in fine arts, his experimental video works and collaborations with video artist Nam June Paik. Most notably were the designers Willi Smith, Carmelo Pomodoro and David Cameron. Some of his fashion videos are in the collection of the Fashion Institute of Technology. Interactive Installations Since 1989, Garrin has been working with interactive media, and developed three highly acclaimed works, \\"Yuppie Ghetto with Watchdog\\", 1989‚Äì90, \\"White Devil\\", 1992-93 and \\"Border Patrol\\" 1995‚Äì97, all of which were produced with the technical collaboration of friend and artist David Rokeby, creator of the \\"Very Nervous System\\", evolutions of which formed the basis of \\"Yuppie Ghetto\\", \\"White Devil\\", and \\"Border Patrol\\". Garrin also enlisted Don Ritter, another friend and artist working in the same realm to create the live targets in the Border Patrol installation. * Border Patrol, 1995-1997 * White Devil, 1992-1993 * Yuppie Ghetto with Watchdog, 1989-1990 Exhibitions, Reviews, Publications Garrin's works have been widely exhibited and broadcast internationally including the, 1995‚Äì96, Kwangju Biennale, 1995, S√£o Paulo Art Biennial, 1994, Holly Solomon Gallery in New York, Musee d'art contemporain de Montreal, 1997, Galleri Faurschou, Copenhagen, 1997, Linz, 1998, Lehmbruck Museum, Duisburg, Germany, 1999, and has been reviewed in The New York Times, Art in America, Artforum, and others.

Evident in Paik's later pieces, Garrin produced hundreds of works with his richly layered and textured tour-de-force imaging techniques, where images multiply and divide within the frame; temporal and spatial shifts proliferate, visuals and sound are juxtaposed in ironic contexts. These were exhibited and remain in the collections of major museums worldwide including the Museum of Modern Art (MoMa), Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Smithsonian American Art Museum, Centre Georges Pompidou, Museum Ludwig, and elsewhere. One such collaboration was Garrin and Paik's Two Channel Music Tape Spring/Fall (1986) comprising two different but complementary videos playing simultaneously on monitors. The visual interplay creates a rapid visual assault. Scenes are multi-layered, fleeting and hard to register. Aesthetically pleasing and amusing footage of the news, pop-culture, and art world are altered and synthesized with the pair's signature image-processing techniques. This piece was acquired by the Long Beach Museum of Art (LBMA) by museum curator Michael Nash in 1989. List of Exhibitions The following is a list of exhibitions that showcased Paul Garrin and Nam June Paik's media art collaborations: 1988 * Hayward Gallery (with Nam June Paik), South Bank Centre, London 1989 * Reconstructed Realms: Recent Acquisitions of LBMA's Video Collection * Living with the Living Theatre, Smithsonian American Art Museum 1990 * Waterworks 1991 * Art of Music Video: 10 Years After Social Impact=Tompkins Square Park Riot As an early citizen journalist, Garrin's noted video document of the Tompkins Square Park Riot (1998) became iconic in exposing the coverup of police misconduct. Shot with a home video camcorder, the tape exposed through the media the willful police violence against demonstrators and bystanders, and became known as the spark which ignited the \\"camcorder revolution\\". Garrin, who was taking video pictures from atop a van was clubbed by two police officers (with other officers looking on) as he pleaded that he was climbing off the vehicle at their instruction and urged not to be hit. With his potentially incriminating video shown on many television stations, Garrin was one of the most prominent of the Tompkins Square victims. On the day after the riot, he received two anonymous threatening phone calls, and the day after that another two. He recalls the language in some of them: \\"You better get the fuck away -- they're gonna get you.\\" \\"Paul, you stupid motherfucker, you got the whole Police Department against you.\\" \\"You can run, but you can't hide.\\" The video of the police riot broke the story on the local television news and became perhaps the first instance of a viral video in the days preceding the Internet. Airing on every news channel in New York City, the footage was picked up by other programs and channels around the world for many years to come. Pummeled by at least five officersand video-documented by Clayton Patterson, a class action lawsuit was filed on behalf of Garrin. In addition to seeking damages for Garrin, the suit sought to end a longstanding pattern of police abuse, namely, interference with persons photographing and otherwise recording police actions. Popular Culture The media notoriety of the riot video with Garrin as videographer is believed to have inspired the late playwright and then East Village, Manhattan resident Jonathan Larson to create the character \\"Mark Cohen\\" in Rent (musical). Community Engagement Officially serving on the Cooper Union Alumni Association (CUAA) Communications Committee, Garrin has been an active member of the CUAA since 2011. From the fall of 2011, Garrin participated in the Friends of Cooper Union and Free Cooper Union brainstorming events, and contributed to \\"The Way Forward\\" ‚Äì a document of proposals to help restructure the Cooper Union to aid it out of the Cooper Union financial crisis and tuition protests, and restore full tuition scholarships to all of its students. In 2013, Garrin co-organized a CUAA/CUES event in the Great Hall in conjunction with the MIT Enterprise Forum of NY on surveillance. Entitled \\"Ethics, Law & Surveillance Culture\\" the program featured author James Bamford, criminal defense attorney Stanley L. Cohen, New York Civil Liberties Union Director Donna Lieberman, and independent journalist Paul DeRienzo. By January 2014, Garrin successfully crowd-funded the Cooper Lumen Design Challenge, partnering with non-profit Two Bridges Neighborhood Council to directly fund interdisciplinary student work for credit in the 2014 semester, all of which has generated positive media for Cooper Union. =Summary= * Represented Cooper Union as panel member at Ruckus NYC‚Äìa one-day conference and concert on art and the web, 29 September 2012. * Participated in the Law Affinity Group Pop-up on 6 December 2012. * Co-organized and hosted \\"Ethics, Law & Surveillance Culture\\" on 23 September 2013. * Successfully crowdfunded over 10K for the Cooper Lumen Design Challenge on 15 January 2014. * Represented CUAA as docent at the Ken Burns Charity Event on 26 March 2014. * Co-organizer of the Peter Cooper Block Party on Founders Day, 13 April 2014. From Media Artist to Internet Social Entrepreneur In 1992, Garrin was a UNESCO Fellow at the Academy of Media Arts Cologne, Germany, where he was first introduced to the Internet. Name.Space Formerly PG Media, Garrin founded Name.Space in 1996, an independent top-level domain (TLD) registry with a primary mission to develop, publish and provide registry services for new TLDs on the Internet, to introduce competition, diversity and localism in the domain name market, and support the balanced interests of commercial, non-commercial, and political speech on the internet. Through online crowd-sourcing, Name.Space was the first to create hundreds of new Internet TLDs including .NYC,. ART, .MUSIC,.SPACE, .SUCKS and .GREEN, pioneering the expansion of the Internet Domain Name System while others opposed it. Some even spread untruths that the addition of hundreds or more TLDs would \\"break the Internet\\". In reality, there are no technical constraints preventing the addition of thousands of new top-level names to the DNS root. Name.Space's creation of hundreds of TLDs predates the formation of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) which incorporated in 1998 As an early proponent of a shared TLD registry system, Name.Space helped shape the adaptation of a wholesale- retail domain registration market that is in practice today. Name.Space endeavored to bring its TLDs to market by means of an antitrust case against Network Solutions 1997‚Äì2000 (based on the successful MCI v. ATT that broke up the telephone company monopoly in the US in 1983). The Name.Space v. Network Solutions, Inc. antitrust lawsuit gave momentum to the restructuring of the domain name registration market from a single monopoly based system to a wholesale-retail one. Although Network Solutions got immunity from the antitrust law, the public benefited from the Name.Space v. NSI lawsuit with the introduction of the wholesale-retail structure that transformed the domain registration market lowering fees from $100 to less than $10 to register a domain name, depending on the TLD and the retailer. ICANN held its first generic top-level domain (gTLD) application process in 2000. Name.Space was considered in the top 10 \\"strong candidates\\" out of 44 applicants, but delegation was deferred in favor of a very limited group of domain industry incumbents, almost all closely tied to ICANN, to the exclusion of many viable new entrants. A number of ICANN Board members recused themselves from the gTLD selection process because of involvement with applications under consideration. Particularly controversial was a proposal by Afilias LLC, an organization that includes 19 registrars, including Herndon, Va.-based Network Solutions Inc., the domain registration unit of VeriSign Inc., to run the registry for a .web domain. Nevertheless, former ICANN Chair Esther Dyson supported Name.Space's application. In her syndicated column in SFGate, an online version of the San Francisco Chronicle, she wrote: > \\"... the proposal of Name.Space appealed to me precisely because it was a > mix of commerce and principle. If the company that wanted to offer .star and > .jazz was prepared to subsidize .sucks, more power to it. Name.Space exists today as a social enterprise corporation and continues to challenge status-quo entities that it views as corrupt with a current lawsuit against ICANN. WiFi-NY In 2003, Garrin launched WiFi-NY, an independent, cooperative community wireless broadband network that serves downtown Manhattan and Brooklyn. Since 2013, the WiFi-NY Peoples Emergency Network has been in partnership with Two Bridges Neighborhood Council, LES community groups, Cooper Union Alumnus, Toby J. Cumberbatch, Professor of Engineering, Cooper Union and students from the Cooper Union schools of Art, Architecture, and Engineering to design a solar-powered product that can simultaneously provide public wireless Internet, emergency lighting and a charging station for computers or cell phones to enhance community resiliency post Hurricane Sandy. Community leaders supporting the Cooper Lumen Design Challenge hope to install the resulting three-in-one power innovation(s) around public spaces ‚Äî starting near the East River waterfront, and in common areas in Two Bridges, Lower East Side, Chinatown, Manhattan East Village and other New York City neighborhoods, where many suffered after losing power after Superstorm Sandy struck.

It is not formally linked with Sacro in Scotland or NIACRO in Northern Ireland. Nacro's services cover education, housing, substance misuse treatment and the prevention of reoffending. History The Central Discharged Prisoners' Aid Society (Incorporated) was formed in 1918 as a successor to the Central Committee of Discharged Prisoners' Aid Societies, which had been formed in c.1880. It was renamed the National Association of Discharged Prisoners' Aid Societies (Incorporated) in October 1960, and the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders (NACRO) in March 1966. It developed into the biggest criminal justice-related charity in England and Wales and in the 1970s and 1980s it became involved in policy discussions with the British Government, particularly with the Home Office, which has responsibility for prisons and probation services. Since 2011, its strategy has focused on extending its high-level influence at government level, with commissioners, policy makers and practitioners, and increasing its partnership work. In 1999 the organisation officially became Nacro, the crime reduction charity. In 2015, in conjunction with Nacro's 50th anniversary year and to reflect the breadth of its work, it changed its name to Nacro: A social justice charity. Current activities  Nacro's services include: * Education: Nacro provides pre-vocational and vocational programmes, problem- solving courses and employment preparation programmes for people who are stuck and can‚Äôt see a way forward. In addition to this, in 2015 Nacro established a partnership with Totton College. Nacro Boston Education Centre * Housing: Nacro helps people find somewhere to live to give them the stability and support they need to acquire new skills and patterns of behaviour to turn their lives around and to connect to their communities. * Justice: Nacro works with young and adult offenders in prisons and in the community. It offers a wide range of services for a variety of different client groups to support people to change their lives and to prevent and reduce crime and the risk of reoffending. * Health: Nacro delivers community-based contracts across substance misuse services. Its largest contract is in Wolverhampton where it runs Recovery Near You, a consolidated and integrated drug and alcohol treatment service for young people and adults. * Nacro's Resettlement Advice Service provides specialist advice, training and consultancy to individuals, practitioners and employers on criminal records and disclosure issues. Nacro provides the UK's only national dedicated confidential public advice service for people with previous convictions. *Bail Accommodation and Support Service (BASS): In June 2018, Nacro took over delivery of the BASS service from Home Group, formerly Stonham Home Group. Commissioned by the Ministry of Justice, BASS gives people who are eligible to be released from prison or bailed from court somewhere stable to live and the support they need to move on to an independent, crime-free future. Nacro also uses its knowledge of what works to reduce crime to help inform policy and shape practice. In line with this, the charity works closely with government and public and private sector partners, using experience on the ground to establish and pilot the best ways of addressing social exclusion. Nacro is a regular contributor to government consultations and important debates on key subjects in the criminal justice sector. Totton College The entrance to Totton College In 2015 it emerged that Totton College near Southampton was in serious financial difficulty and was seeking a merger with another institution. In December 2015 Totton College became part of Nacro, with the aim of making Totton College a vocational centre of excellence. Maxine Room CBE was appointed as Campus Principal in October 2017. Lisa Capper is the current Principal of Totton College, supported by Hannah Avoth as Vice Principal. Officials Queen Elizabeth II is the Patron of Nacro.

From Whistler on up, the region overlaps with the older and more historic Lillooet Country, of which Squamish, at the region's centre, was once the southward extension in the days when it was the rail-port terminus from the Interior, via Lillooet, and accessible from the Lower Mainland only by sea. Most of the region is in the Squamish-Lillooet Regional District, although south of Britannia Beach a small part of the region is in the Greater Vancouver Regional District. The term \\"Corridor\\" refers to the alignment of the region's towns along Highway 99, a.k.a. the Sea to Sky Highway, which links together the regions' three main centres - Squamish, Whistler and Pemberton. There is little development other than resource extraction outside the immediate vicinity of the highway and the towns along it, hence the linear character of the region. As with the overlap with the historical region known as Lillooet Country from Cheakamus Canyon northwards, the southern part of the region overlaps with Greater Vancouver and also with a more general and less unified but identifiable region around Howe Sound, the islands and western shore of which are respectively part of the Gulf Islands and Sunshine Coast. Communities The Sea to Sky Country falls readily into three major subregions. These are, south to north: Howe Sound-Squamish Valley in the Sea-to-Sky Corridor in Squamish *Lions Bay *Furry Creek *Britannia Beach *Darrell Bay (a.k.a. Shannon Falls) *Stawamus *Valleycliffe *Squamish *Brackendale *Chiyakmesh *Cheekye *Paradise Valley Cheakamus-Whistler *Garibaldi (abandoned/condemned) *Pinecrest Estates *Black Tusk Estates *Whistler **Function Junction **Whistler Southside (\\"Gondola\\") **Alta Lake **Whistler Village **White Gold-Nesters **Mons **Alpine Meadows **Emerald Estates Pemberton Valley *Pemberton *Pemberton Meadows *Mount Currie **Xitolacw **Owl Creek *Lillooet Lake =Birkenhead-Gates Valley= The designation Sea to Sky Highway ends at Mount Currie , though Highway 99 continues on northwards over Cayoosh Pass to Lillooet. Locations beyond Mount Currie-Lillooet Lake along the route of the rail line and the frontier-era Douglas Road are not usually considered in the Corridor, but sometimes are even though they are not on the Sea to Sky Highway. This further subregion is defined by the lower valley of the Birkenhead River and the Birken Valley and Gates Valley towards Anderson Lake. Socially and economically this area is part of or adjunct to the Pemberton subregion, though not in the Pemberton Valley: *\\"No. 10 Downing Street\\" *Birken-Gates Valley *Devine *D'Arcy (Nequatque) Parks=Provincial *Murrin Provincial Park *Stawamus Chief Provincial Park *Alice Lake Provincial Park *Garibaldi Provincial Park *Shannon Falls Provincial Park *Brandywine Falls Provincial Park *Callaghan Lake Provincial Park *Nairn Falls Provincial Park *Birkenhead Lake Provincial Park *Joffre Lakes Provincial Park Regional *Cat Lake Regional Park *Brohm Lake Regional Park Municipal *Lost Lake Park, Whistler *Rainbow Lodge, Whistler *One Mile Lake, Pemberton External links * ","title":"Sea-to-Sky Corridor"},{"id":"6302663","text":"Ulrich \\"Uli\\" Stein (born 23 October 1954 in Hamburg) is a former German football player.

After two years, he moved to Hamburger SV where he played from 1980 to 1987. From 1987 to 1994 he played for Eintracht Frankfurt, but in 1994 he returned to Hamburger SV. One year later, he transferred to Arminia Bielefeld again. He retired during the 1996‚Äì97 season. He won the DFB-Pokal (German cup) in 1987 with Hamburger SV and won two German Bundesliga League titles, in 1982 and 1983. The highlight of his career was winning the European Cup (UEFA Champions League) in 1983, with Hamburger SV. He also went on to win the DFB- Pokal with Eintracht Frankfurt in 1988. He represented the West German national team 6 times between 1983 and 1986. He was a member of the West German squad defeated by Argentina in the final of the World Cup 1986 in Mexico. His international career came to an end when he called West German coach, Franz Beckenbauer a Suppenkasper, meaning laughing stock. In the DFB- Pokal in the 1986‚Äì87 season, in a tie between Hamburger SV and FC Augsburg in the Rosenaustadion, he was given the red card and as he left the pitch, he showed his middle finger to Augsburg's supporters. A more serious incident occurred in 1987 when he punched J√ºrgen Wegmann of Bayern Munich. Because of this incident, he was fired by Hamburger SV. He then joined Eintracht Frankfurt, where he played until 1994, when he was fired again. During this period he became one of the most popular goalkeepers ever to have played for the club. In 2007, he became the goalkeeping coach of Nigeria, in 2008 of Azerbaijan under fellow German Berti Vogts.

Biography Curtis studied at Goldsmiths, University of London and the London School of Economics, before becoming a research fellow at the Royal Institute of International Affairs (Chatham House). He subsequently worked at the international development NGOs ActionAid and Christian Aid, before becoming director of the World Development Movement. He established a consultancy, Curtis Research, and undertook research projects for international NGOs until co-founding Declassified UK with Matt Kennard in 2019. Declassified UK is an investigative journalism organisation focusing on UK foreign, military and intelligence policies. Works=Web of Deceit In 2003 Curtis published Web of Deceit: Britain's Real Role in the World. This book has been his most successful to date. It offers a new approach to the role of the United Kingdom in the post-1945 world and in the \\"war against terrorism\\", and a critique of the Blair government's foreign policy. Curtis argues that Britain is an \\"outlaw state\\", often a violator of international law and ally of many repressive regimes. He reasons not only that Britain's foreign policies are generally unethical but that they are also making the world more dangerous and unequal. Curtis draws much of his research from recently declassified documents from the UK national archives. He attempts to demonstrate the role and complicity of the British in the massacre of hundreds of thousands of Indonesians in 1965, the toppling of the governments of Iran and Guyana, and what he describes as repressive colonial policies in the former colonies of Kenya, Oman, and Malaysia.Unpeople, Dirty Wars and a Web of Deceit ‚Äì Britain‚Äôs Foreign Policies Worldpress.org 6 January 2005.

The book analyses the Blair government's foreign policies since the invasion of Iraq and, using evidence unearthed from formerly secret documents, reveals a series of British policies, including: support for the massacres in Iraq in 1963; the private backing of the US in its war against Vietnam; support for the rise of Ugandan dictator Idi Amin; the running of a covert war in Yemen in the 1960s; secret campaigns with the US to overthrow the governments of Indonesia and British Guiana; and the welcoming of General Pinochet's coup in Chile in 1973.

The book outlines the unreported attempts by Britain to cultivate relations with the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt after the fall of Mubarak, the military intervention on the side of Libyan rebel forces which included pro-al-Qaeda elements, and the ongoing reliance on Saudi Arabia to safeguard its interest in the Middle East.Secret Affairs, By Mark Curtis, Reviewed by Kim Sengupta, 30 July 2010, The IndependentBooks of the year 2010, John Pilger, 19 November 2010, New Statesman Selected publications Unpeople: Britain's Secret Human Rights Abuses, Vintage, 2004 * Web of Deceit: Britain's Real Role in the World, Vintage, 2003 * Trade for Life: Making Trade Work for Poor People, Christian Aid, 2001 * The Great Deception: Anglo-American Power and World Order, Pluto Press, 1998 * The Ambiguities of Power: British Foreign Policy since 1945, Zed Books, 1995 References External links  Mark Curtis' personal website *Journalisted ‚Äì Articles by Mark Curtis *Mark Curtis at Media Lens *Mark Curtis at CiF *Book preview of Unpeople in The Guardian. *Book review of Web of Deceit in The Guardian Alumni of the London School of Economics British male journalists British political writers Living people Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Mark Curtis (British author)"},{"id":"6302676","text":"Xu Da (1332‚Äì1385), courtesy name Tiande, was a Chinese military general who lived in the late Yuan dynasty and early Ming dynasty.

In 1368, the year when the Ming dynasty was founded, Xu Da and other Ming generals led an attack on Khanbaliq (present-day Beijing), the Yuan capital, and forced the last Yuan ruler, Toghon Tem√ºr, to flee northward.\\"Xu Da.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 2008. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. 09 Oct. 2008 Xu Da led a pursuit on the retreating Yuan forces and encountered Taejo of Joseon, the founder of the Korean Joseon dynasty, who was ordered by the Mongols to attack the Ming army. Xu Da's presence struck fear into the Korean generals, who in turn, allied themselves with the Ming forces instead. Afterwards, Xu Da's army entered Mongol territory, routed Mongol reinforcements, sacked the Mongol capital at Karakorum, and captured thousands of Mongol nobles in 1370. His army ventured to Transbaikalia and reached further north than any other Chinese army had ever before. Xu Da died in 1385 under mysterious circumstances. He was not accused of plotting an assassination on the Hongwu Emperor ‚Äì although many other generals who contributed heavily to the founding of the Ming dynasty were put to death by the emperor for allegedly plotting rebellions. According to legend, Xu Da was allergic to goose, so the Hongwu Emperor sent him a goose dish and ordered the emissary to ensure that Xu ate it and died.Deng, YinkeHistory of China Beijing : China Intercontinental Press, 2007. pp.131-132 In fiction Xu Da appears as a minor character in Louis Cha's wuxia novel The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber. As a member of the anti-Yuan Ming Cult, Xu Da participated actively in the rebellions to overthrow the Yuan dynasty under the leadership of Zhang Wuji. Zhang passes Xu the Book of Wumu, a text on military strategy written by the Song dynasty general Yue Fei. Xu benefits greatly from reading the book, becomes a brilliant military commander, and assists Zhu Yuanzhang in overthrowing the Yuan dynasty and establishing the Ming dynasty.

The driver's door is of the conventional swing-open type. __TOC__  First generation (AP10; 2004‚Äì2012)  The Porte was introduced in July 2004, but is only available in Japan, so it is only produced with right-hand drive. The Porte is based on the first generation Vitz subcompact car and is made in 4-seater and 5-seater versions. It comes with either a 1.3-litre or 1.5-litre petrol engine, with automatic transmission only, and with either front-wheel drive or four-wheel drive. It is similar in concept to the 2002 Peugeot Sesame and the slightly smaller Peugeot 1007 which has an electric-powered sliding door on both sides. However the door only slides on the left. 2004 Toyota Porte (rear).jpgRear view  Second generation (XP140; 2012‚Äìpresent)  In July 2012, the Porte was redesigned and for this generation, it introduced the variant, which features a different front and rear design, as well as a slightly different interior color. The second generation Porte is sold at Toyota Store and Toyopet Store dealerships while the Spade is sold at Corolla Store and Netz dealerships across Japan, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, starting in August 2015. Although, it still comes with the 1.3-liter 1NR-FE engine or an improved 1.5-liter 1NZ-FE engine, mated with the Super CVT-i (Continuously Variable Transmission-intelligent) automatic transmission, an available Smart Stop feature for the 1.5-liter variants has a fuel efficiency of under the JC08 test cycle (equivalent to of emissions) of the Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT). The two different engine sizes gave Japanese drivers a choice as to which annual road tax obligation they were willing to pay; vehicles with the larger engine were equipped at a higher level than the lower trim level in compensation. In 2015, the 1.3-liter engine option was dropped and a newer 1.5-liter 2NR-FKE engine was used for front- wheel drive models.

Ship history The ship was built by the Arbuthnot Sawmill at Koondrook, in 1916, as a barge, and named after the sawmill's founder. She was fitted with an engine and superstructure in 1923. The engine was built by Ruston & Hornsby of England and was once used in an earlier boat called The Glimpse. The ship towed empty barges to the nearby forest to collect logs; then back to the mill where the logs were cut up into lengths of timber. Barges towed upstream could be left for loading then floated back on the current while the steamer returned to the mill and took another barge downstream. The boat worked at the mill until the 1940s. It was then sold to charcoal producers at Barmah. Eventually in 1947 it sank. Volunteers from Shepparton raised it in 1972 for use at the International Village theme park. In 1989 the Alexander Arbuthnot was bought by the Port of Echuca for further restoration. Currently the Alexander Arbuthnot carries 47 passengers per trip at the Port of Echuca.

The second generation was released in May 2003. It was sold only in Japan at Toyota Netz retail sales channels. The vehicle's name is German for chamber, berth, room, space, expanse, scope, area, or sphere and attempts to emphasize the vast amount of space it contains relative to its size. This is because the front doors on both the driver and passenger sides open conventionally, but the rear doors slide open rearward and attach to the top and bottom of the door openings and interlock to the front doors. The Raum uses a similar door approach also used on the first-generation Mitsubishi RVR/Space Runner. There is no doorjamb between the front and rear doors that the doors attach to on the passenger side, and the passenger front seat folds flat upon itself and then can be folded forward while still being attached to the floor at the front bottom of the seat. The rear seats can be folded flat with a 60:40 split or can also be folded forward individually for a rear flat cargo floor. The automatic transmission gear selector is dashboard mounted, thereby freeing up the flat floor space between the front seats, allowing movement to the back seat from inside the vehicle. __TOC__  First generation (XZ10; 1997‚Äì2003) The development for the first generation Raum was led by Toyota chief engineer Tetsuya Tada. The Raum was equipped with EBD brakes on top level G and E packages, with a later addition to the C package. A minor facelift was done August 1999.  Second generation (XZ20; 2003‚Äì2011)  A complete body change was released for sale May 12, 2003 and shared the platform with the Toyota Vitz. Side impact protection was further enhanced. The passenger side rear door can be opened electronically and by remote control key fob. The engine used in the second-generation model is shared with the Toyota Prius. On October 20, 2003, the vehicle won the Japan Good Design Award with a special mention for people with physical disabilities.

He was married to fellow designer and amateur champion Alice Dye. Early life Dye was born in Urbana, Ohio, the son of Paul F. \\"Pink\\" and Elizabeth Dye. A few years before Dye's birth, his father became involved with golf and built a nine-hole course on family land in Champaign County called the \\"Urbana Country Club.\\"\\"Urbana Country Club\\" Urbana Country Club website As a youngster, he worked and played that course. While attending Urbana High School, he won the Ohio state high school golf championship, and medaled in the state amateur golf championship, all before entering the U.S. Army at age 18 in 1944 during World War II. Dye first moved to Delray Beach, Florida with his parents in 1933 and eventually established his own winter residence there. With his brother Andy, he had attended the Asheville School, a boarding school in North Carolina at Asheville.Notable Alumni. Asheville School. Dye entered the Airborne School at Fort Benning in Georgia to be a paratrooper in the 82nd Airborne Division, but the war ended while he was in training. He was stationed at Fort Bragg in North Carolina where he served the rest of his hitch as greenskeeper on the base golf course. Dye explained, > \\"I played the golf course at Pinehurst No. 2 for six solid months, and I got > to know Mr. Donald Ross...(who) had built the Fort Bragg golf course. He > would come over and watch us play golf, and most of the time the captain and > colonel hauled me over there. They didn't know who Mr. Ross was, but the > other fellow walking with him was JC Penney, and they all knew him.\\" After his discharge, Dye relocated to Florida and enrolled at Rollins College in Winter Park, northeast of Orlando, where he met his wife, Alice Holliday O'Neal. They were married in early 1950, and had two sons, Perry and P.B. (Paul Burke). They moved to Indiana to her hometown of Indianapolis, and Dye sold insurance.\\"When Pete Dye Speaks, People Listen.\\" Florida Golf Magazine, Winter 2009 Within a few years, he distinguished himself as a million dollar salesman, and was also successful in amateur golf. Dye won the Indiana amateur championship in 1958, following runner-up finishes in 1954 and 1955. At age 31, he qualified for the in 1957 at Inverness Club in Toledo, Ohio, but shot 152 (+12) to miss the cut by two strokes, as did Arnold Palmer; seventeen- year-old amateur Jack Nicklaus was eight strokes behind them at 160.\\"Pete Dye\\" Dye Designs website Design career Dye made the decision to become a golf course designer in his mid-30s. Alice supported his career change and became partner in the new venture. In 1961, the couple visited and talked to noted golf architect Bill Diddle, who lived nearby. He warned them about the economic uncertainty of the profession, but they persisted. The first design from Dye and his wife was the nine-hole El Dorado course south of Indianapolis, which crossed a creek thirteen times. Those nine holes are now incorporated into the Royal Oak course at Dye's Walk Country Club.\\"The Fort Golf Course-Colorful Past, Celebrated Architect Make The Fort a Must Play\\" Golfers Guide, Indiana\\"Royal Oak\\" Golf Now website Their first 18-hole course was created during 1962 in Indianapolis and named Heather Hills, now known as Maple Creek Golf & Country Club. Dye designed the Radrick Farms Golf Course for the University of Michigan in 1962, but the course did not open until 1965.\\"Welcome to Radrick Farms Golf Course\\" University of Michigan website, Radrick Farms At the time, he was using the design style of Trent Jones, but after seeing the work of Alister MacKenzie, who designed the 1931 Michigan course, Dye decided to incorporate features from two greens into his next project. Dye visited Scotland in 1963 and made a thorough study of its classic courses. The Scottish use of pot bunkers, bulkheads constructed of wood, and diminutive greens influenced his subsequent designs. Dye's first well-known course was Crooked Stick Golf Club in Carmel, Indiana, north of Indianapolis, begun in 1964. It hosted the PGA Championship in 1991, won by ninth alternate John Daly. In 1967, he designed The Golf Club near Columbus, Ohio, where he solicited input from 27-year-old Jack Nicklaus, an area local who won his seventh major (of 18) that year. The two worked together to design the acclaimed Harbour Town Golf Links in South Carolina, opened in 1969, the site of an annual PGA Tour event ever since.The Golf Course, by Geoffrey Cornish and Ronald Whitten, 1981. Nicklaus credits Dye with significant influence on his own approach to golf course design.Jack Nicklaus: My Story, by Jack Nicklaus. Also in 1969, Dye designed his first course in Florida called Delray Dunes. In 1970, he designed Martingham Golf Course in St. Michaels, Maryland, now known as Harbourtowne Resort. The owners of the project went bankrupt and Dye went unpaid; the course was eventually finished, however, and had many of Dye's signature course characteristics such as deep bunkers, small greens, short challenging par fours, and railroad ties. In 2015, the property was purchased by Richard D. Cohenhttp://m.stardem.com/business/article_2bb10e6d-e11d-538b-936f-2e6659c02b4c.html?mode=jqm who has entered into an agreement with Dye to update and redesign the course. The new owner agreed to pay the funds that were not paid during the original design.http://www.harbourtowne.com/m/golf-in-maryland/course-layout In 1986, Dye also designed a course in the Italian province of Brescia, near Lake Iseo, the Franciacorta Golf Club, recognized today as wine golf course. Dye is considered to be one of the most influential course architects in the world. His designs are known for distinctive features, including small greens and the use of railroad ties to hold bunkers. His design for the Brickyard Crossing golf course at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway utilized the dismantled outer retaining wall from the race track. He is known for designing the \\"world's most terrifying tee shot,\\" the par-3 17th hole of the Stadium Course at TPC at Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. Known as the \\"Island Green,\\" it gained wide notice in 1982, during the first Players Championship at the new course.

Sales started in June 2001. The Brevis was produced for six years before being discontinued in 2007. The Brevis was exclusive to Toyota Japan dealerships Toyota Store, while its twin the Toyota Progr√®s was exclusive to Toyopet Store locations. The word \\"brevis\\" is Latin for \\"brief, a short amount of time or duration\\". Marketing The marketing approach used for the Brevis was shared with a Toyota Vista Store sedan, called the Toyota Verossa, which used a different platform. The Brevis represented the market segment previously served in Japan by the Toyota Carina ED. The width and engine displacement exceed Japanese Government regulations concerning exterior dimensions and engine displacement, and therefore it classified in the larger \\"passenger car\\" tax bracket. Two engine sizes were offered to allow Japanese buyers which annual road tax they were willing to pay. The larger engine did offer higher levels of standard equipment and luxury features. Description The Toyota Brevis is a twin of the Progres, which was launched half a year before the Altezza/Lexus IS with a similar platform. Brevis was made with the concept of \\"Mini LS430\\". Unlike Progres, the new Brevis aims at younger customers, with Toyota saying it is intended to compete directly with imports like the BMW 3 Series and Mercedes C-Class. The Brevis has many styling cues from the Lexus LS 430, and was introduced at the same time as the Toyota Allion. Had this car been sold in markets other than Japan, it would surely have been sold as a model in the Lexus lineup. The price range would have been between the IS and the GS, which puts it in the US$30,000-$45,000 range at that time. The chassis and powertrain is similar to the Progres and the Lexus IS, with altered exterior styling and a differently trimmed interior. The headlamps consist of three round type beams. The center console houses an LCD monitor and an alloy-effect sound system which consists of an on-dash CD changer, DVD and MD playback, with seven speakers on the top model. The Brevis is based on the same rear-drive platform as the Lexus IS, using a double wishbone suspension at all four wheels, with the wheelbase extended to . In terms of size and weight, it stands between the BMW 3 Series and 5 Series. However, dynamically speaking it can hardly match the European rivals (in Toyota's brand images, that role is left for Lexus to fulfil), even though it rides on double-wishbone suspension. The suspension is set softer than the Lexus, steering is less direct, and its kerb weight also harmed handling agility. Brevis was Toyota's last new car, and one of two (along with Progr√®s) last car, to use a straight six engine. Options There are two choices of power plant: 2.5 litre or 3.0 litre straight-six (Toyota JZ engine), both front mounted, producing and respectively. Both are equipped with VVT-i and D-4 direct injection. It comes with 5-speed automatic (2WD car) or 4-speed automatic (4WD car) gearbox options, in which the 4WD option is only available for the 2.5 litre model. Other options include a power- adjustable pedal, in which pedal positions can be adjusted to suit the driver's driving posture and the position of the pedals, steering wheel and driver's seat are memorized. There is also an electric rear sunshade and a radar cruise control system to ensure a safe following distance to the car ahead in correspondence to the traveling speed. All these are standard equipment. Also included are the Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) system, ABS, and high intensity discharge HID headlamps. Model changes The Brevis was changed in April 2004 as the mesh grille design was adopted for the front grille. Models after December 2005 come with EMV (with color backing guide monitor & window shade corner monitor) and also a DVD voice navigation system for G-BOOK and NAVI.AI-SHIFT (not applicable for 4WD models.)

It is typically contested between the winners of the preceding ten Goals of the Month, although the goal can and has come from any game in the regular season, including international qualifiers and friendlies‚Äîpotentially from the opening league games of the season to the end of the European season UEFA Champions League final. In several instances, the goal has come in the final game of the domestic season, the FA Cup Final, the most recent example of which is Steven Gerrard's last minute goal in 2006. However, in 1980‚Äì81, for example, the superb goal scored by Ricky Villa in the FA Cup Final replay for Tottenham Hotspur against Manchester City could not be considered as voting had already taken place.Match of the Day: 25 Years of Goal of the Season video (1995, voiced by John Motson) In general, the winning goal has occurred for an English side within the domestic English league or cups, although there are no particular rules; Kenny Dalglish's goal in 1982‚Äì83 for Scotland being an exception. The goal usually comes from competitions to which the BBC holds television rights and which are shown under the Match of the Day banner; at present Premier League highlights and FA Cup live matches and highlights, although some have come from the equivalent Sportscene broadcast by BBC Scotland. Due to the lack of BBC European club football coverage, held predominantly by ITV, Sky and BT Sport, no goal of the season has ever been scored in European club competition despite many contenders. Due to a transfer of broadcast rights, the entries for the 2001‚Äì02, 2002‚Äì03 and 2003‚Äì04 seasons were decided on ITV's The Premiership, which have been subsequently recognised by the BBC. When the BBC previously could not show league footage from 1988‚Äì89 to 1991‚Äì92, the winning goal in each season was scored in the FA Cup which they held the rights to. League rights holder ITV had its own competition during these seasons for Goal of the Season, broadcast on the Saint and Greavsie show. Previously the channels had shared league and cup rights (showing different matches to each other) and for many years ITV broadcast its own Golden Goals competition as an equivalent of Goal of the Season. From 2013‚Äì14 season onwards, the Goal of the Season has been chosen by a Twitter poll and the BBC Sport website. Jack Wilshere is the first player to win Goal of the Season in consecutive seasons (2013‚Äì14 and 2014‚Äì15) since the start of the Premier League. and is only the second player overall to have achieved this after John Aldridge, who won the award in both 1987‚Äì88 and 1988‚Äì89 (which pre-dated the Premier League era) seasons. The 1987‚Äì88 competition was unique in that all 10 goals shortlisted were scored by Liverpool players. As of 2018‚Äì19, this is the only occasion where the contenders were made up entirely of goals scored by players for one club. For several years in the late 2000s, the winner was not subject to public vote due to the 2007 phone-in scandals. The winning goal was instead decided by pundits in the studio. 2014‚Äì15 Goal of the Season controversy On 24 May 2015, the final day of the 2014‚Äì15 season, Match of the Day held an online vote at around 11 pm GMT for the Goal of the Season award. Users were able to vote via the BBC website or Twitter. The poll was quickly skewed by Arsenal supporters, many from the Far East, resulting in Jack Wilshere winning the award for his final day strike against West Bromwich Albion, despite not being the favourite. Host Gary Lineker expressed surprise as he read out the winner, and pundit Alan Shearer suggested that Charlie Adam should have won the award for his 66-yard effort against Chelsea, while fellow pundit Danny Murphy felt former Fulham teammate Bobby Zamora should have won. The incident was labelled a \\"shambles\\" by Pete Smith of The Stoke Sentinel who also thought Stoke's Adam should have won, and a \\"concerted campaign by Arsenal fans\\" by Alan Pattullo of The Scotsman, who also felt the Scottish midfielder was deserving of the award. Mark Brus, of Caught Offside, also criticized the choice arguing that a goal in a meaningless game should not have won Goal of the Season and that Juan Mata's acrobatic effort against Liverpool was worthy of the award. The following season, before the final episode of that season's Match of the Day, the programme's producers changed the rules to prevent a similar situation. The Goal of the Season award has since been decided by the pundits on the show, who will choose the winner based on the top three goals voted for by the public.

It was founded by Dr. Govindappa Venkataswamy (popularly known as Dr.V) at Madurai, Tamil Nadu in 1976. It has grown into a network of eye hospitals and has had a major impact in eradicating cataract related blindness in India. As of 2012, Aravind has treated nearly 32 million patients and performed 4 million surgeries. The model of Aravind Eye Care hospitals has been applauded and has become a subject for numerous case studies across the world.Aravind Eye Care System:Giving them the most precious gift Aravind Eye Care System, North western University  History  Cataracts are a major source of blindness in India, with at least 4 million cases reported every year, contributing to nearly to a quarter of the world‚Äôs blind. Cataract related blindness can be avoided by timely intervention and surgery.  The Aravind Model  Dr. Venkataswamy's vision was to eradicate needless blindness in India. Dr. Venkataswamy wanted to emulate the service efficiency of McDonald's fast food and sought to adapt it to the eye care system to cope with increasing the numbers of patients treated. Aravind began performing surgeries on a large scale with treatment being free or heavily subsidized for the poor cross subsidized by the paying patients. Aravind established an outreach program wherein doctors reach out to remote villages to conduct eye camps, some times, in association with various organizations. The organizations take care of the costs of the camp, transporting the patients to surgery and their rehabilitation while Aravind does the surgery free of cost. Aravind started performing 5 times the number of cataract surgeries that were performed in the entire country and 16 times more than that of the entire U.S. Aravind focused on rotating doctors between free and paid wards, concentrating on efficiency and hygiene thus eliminating differences between the surgeries done for paid and non-paid patients. The rate of infection in Aravind was about four per thousand surgeries which was significantly lower than the international norm of six per thousand surgeries.  Hospitals and facilities  Aravind Hospital started in 1976 as an 11-bed hospital in Madurai. Aravind opened a hospital in Theni in 1985 and Tirunelveli in 1988. The hospital at Coimbatore was founded in 1997. Aravind later expanded to five more cities in Tamil Nadu including Tirupur, Salem, Dindigul, Thoothukudi, Udumalaipettai and neighboring Pondicherry. To commemorate Dr. V's birth centenary, Arvind-Chennai, the largest among all Aravind Eye Hospitals, was established in September 2017. In 2019, with the support of TTD who allocated the land at a nominal lease, Sri Venkateswara Aravind Eye Hospital, Tirupati branch was established in March 2019 to provide access to 14 million population of Chittoor, Nellore, Kadapa, Anantapur and neighbouring districts. The group also has four partnership projects ‚Äî with the Rajiv Gandhi Chairtable Trust in Amethi, another in Lucknow, Birla Corporation in Kolkata and Shanghvi Trust in Amreli, Gujarat. Aravind also set up its first overseas venture in Nigeria in 2018 in partnership with Chanrai Group which is probably the largest eye-care facility in Africa with a capacity to perform 10,000 surgeries annually.  LAICO  Aravind established Lions Aravind Institute of Community Ophthalmology (LAICO) in association with Lions International in 1992. The institute offers training for hospital administrators, hospital operations managers and other management professionals.  Aurolab  The intraocular lens (IOL) implanted during cataract surgery improves visual outcomes and, thereby, quality of life. However, the high cost threatened Aravind‚Äôs ability to provide IOLs to its poorer patients in the late 1980s. This led to Aravind establishing Aurolab, a manufacturing facility, which introduced IOLs at $10 while others were selling them at $60-$100. Aurolab now manufactures a little more than two million lenses annually and exports to 160 countries. About 60% of Aurolab‚Äôs sales go to non-profit organizations. Aurolab now produces high quality IOLs, sutures, blades, pharmaceuticals and equipment at a fraction of their cost in the west, enabling Aravind and other providers to maintain quality and equity in care. Aurolab now meets over 10% of developing countries‚Äô needs.  Aravind Eyebank  Aravind has established four eye banks viz. Rotary Aravind International Eye Bank in Madurai in association with Rotary International (1998), Aravind ‚Äì IOB Eye bank in Coimbatore in association with Indian Overseas Bank (1998), Rotary Aravind Eye Bank in Tirunelveli in association with Rotary International (2004) and Aravind Eye Bank Association in Puducherry (2005).

However, early in the ship's service it was reclassified AGS-15 and renamed Tanner. She served as a commissioned ship for 24 years and 4 months. Service history Pamina was laid down in 1944 by the Walsh-Kaiser Company at Providence, Rhode Island. The ship was launched on 5 January 1945, sponsored by Mrs. Ralph M. Johnston. The vessel was commissioned 10 February 1945 with Lieutenant Commander E. P. Teague in command. USS Pamina, 1945-1946 Following shakedown Pamina transited the Panama Canal and reported to Amphibious Force, Pacific Fleet, Pearl Harbor. After intensive training with other vessels of her type, she departed Pearl Harbor on 22 April and arrived at Okinawa on 15 May to deliver cargo and to render assistance to combat operations ashore. She operated in the South, Southwest and Western Pacific areas for the remainder of World War II. Immediately thereafter she transported occupation forces to Japan and returning servicemen to the United States. Pamina was reclassified AGS-15 and renamed Tanner 15 May 1946. USS Tanner, 1946-1969 Pamina was renamed Tanner in honor of U.S. Navy captain and oceanographer Zera Luther Tanner. After sea trials during November and December, Tanner conducted hydrographic survey operations off the east coast of Mexico. She continued similar activities in the same area, off Labrador, off Trinidad and off Venezuela for the next four years. In January 1951, she began survey work in the Bahamas in connection with a guided missile testing range, work which she continued with only occasional missions elsewhere until the summer of 1952. At that time she returned northward and after a period in New York Naval Shipyard proceeded to northwest Greenland for extensive priority survey work. She concluded the season with a survey of a small island in the Canadian Arctic where a harbor was named \\"Tanner Bay\\" in her honor. From 1954 to 1958, Tanner operated primarily off the southern coast of Turkey with steamed during 139 days in the survey area in the spring and summer of 1956. Again in the Bahamas in 1959, she became part of the Persian Gulf Survey Unit later that year. After extensive work in the Near East, she conducted research in the Barents Sea in 1963, in the deep dive area off Norfolk in 1964, and in the northern Aegean Sea 15 November 1965 to 15 March 1966. Tanner deployed 19 October from Pearl Harbor for survey operations in the South China Sea off the Mekong Delta coast of South Vietnam. She returned to the coast of South Vietnam and to the Gulf of Thailand in 1967 and 1968. Following survey operations in the Western Pacific early in 1969 and with long and distinguished service to her credit, Tanner began her decommissioning process on 14 July. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register 1 August and transferred to the Maritime Administration for disposal. Pamina received one battle star for World War II service.

It is located about 75 km to the southeast of the major city of Bandung. History The modern history of Garut started on March 2, 1811 when Balubur Limbangan Regency was dissolved by Governor General Herman Willem Daendels, because the area's production of coffee had decreased and the Regent, Tumenggung Wangsakusumah II had refused a command to plant indigo. Balubur Limbangan Regency then comprised 6 districts: Balubur, Malangbong, Wanaraja, Wanakerta, Cibeureum and Papandak. The Limbangan Regency, which has now become the Garut Regency, was founded by Lieutenant- Governor Stamford Raffles on 16 February 1813. RAA. Adiwijaya, who governed from the 1813 until 1821, was the first Regent of the Garut Regency. He was well known as Dalem Cipeujueh. The town of Suci was originally the capital of the new Limbangan Regency. However it was thought that Suci did not meet the requirements of a capital because the area was crowded and quite narrow. Regarding this matter, Regent Limbangan Adipati Adiwijaya formed a committee to find a suitable place for the capital of the Regency. In the beginning, the committee found Cimurah, about 3 km to the East Suci (currently the village is known by the name of Pidayeuheun Village). However, in this place clean water was difficult to obtain so the place not regarded as suitable to become the capital. The committee then decided that a suitable place was about 5 km to west of Suci. In addition to fertile land, the place has a spring that flows to the River Cimanuk and is surrounded by mountains, like Mount Cikuray, Mount Papandayan, Mount Guntur, Mount Galunggung, Mount Talaga Bodas, Kandangwesi and Mount Karacak. The sanatorium of Garut in the 1920s The Regent of Garut, Raden Adipati Aria Wiratanudatar VII, with his wife RA Lasminingrat (sitting) and his family. Goat fights in Garut (1921) The main street of Garut in 1936 Lake Bagendit in Garut, 1932 When the site was first found, there was a spring nearby that was said to have been surrounded by a small pond closed off by thorny scrub. According to local stories, one person in the group had his hands badly scratched by the thorns. A European in the team asked about the bleeding and was told that the problem was \\"kakarut!\\" The answer was misheard by the European visitor as \\"gagarut\\" rather than \\"kakarut\\". Team members of the committee thus named the thorny plant \\"Ki Garut\\" and the pond was named \\"Ci Garut\\" (the location of this pond now was occupied by SLTPI, SLTPII, and SLTP IV Garut buildings). The area around the pond was named \\"Garut\\". The name of \\"Garut\\" was approved by Regent Limbangan Adipati Adiwijaya to be made the Capital of the Limbangan Regency. On 15 September 1813 the development of capital facilities and infrastructure, such as residence, the hall, office assistant resident, mosques, and square was started. In front of the hall, between the town square and the hall was gotten by \\"Babancong\\" where the Regent as well as the official of the other government gave the speech in front of the public. After the place was completed earlier, the Capital of the Limbangan Regency moved from Suci to Garut around 1821. Based on the Governor General Decree No: 60 dated May 7, 1913, the name of the Limbangan Regency was replaced to the Garut Regency and had a capital the Garut city on July 1, 1913. At that time, the Regent was RAA is Wiratanudatar (1871‚Äì1915). Garut city at that time covering the three villages, namely Kota Kulon (West City) village, the Kota Wetan (East City) Village, and Margawati Village. The Garut Regency covered Garut districts, Bayongbong, Cibatu, Tarogong, Leles, Balubur Limbangan, Cikajang, Pakenjeng, Bungbulang and Pameungpeuk. In the year 1915, RAA Wiratanudatar replaced by his nephew of Adipati Suria Karta Legawa (1915‚Äì1929).

It was serialized in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine from 1992 to 1994 It was adapted into a two-episode series originally released in Japan in August 1994 by Toho and released in the U.S. on VHS in September 1996 and DVD August 2005 by The Right Stuf International. Plot The story revolves around Keiko Nakadai, who in the beginning is an Office Lady working at the perpetually last-place ATV television network. However, she is chosen to fill in for weather reporter Michiko Kawai for one night, and Keiko takes full advantage of her opportunity by blatantly flashing her panties while on live television. The incident causes the evening news ratings to jump, and because of ATV's desperation to escape the ratings cellar, Keiko is subsequently promoted to full-time weather reporter, displacing Michiko in the process. The rest of the series focuses on her rivalries with co-workers jealous of and insulted by the nature of her success. The humor in Weather Report Girl is full of sexually oriented sorority style humor, aimed primarily at young men. The protagonist, Keiko, is depicted as being exhibitionistic, first using her sex appeal to rise to the position of weather girl by flashing her bra and panties, and maintaining her position by frequently wearing lingerie while on the air. She is also very resourceful, always one step ahead of her rivals' various revenge schemes. Keiko is also extraordinarily vengeful, humiliating Michiko on the air by spiking her tea with laxatives after Michiko had attempted a similar tactic against her. Keiko proceeds to masturbate in her apartment while watching Michiko embarrass herself on television. Finally, she is sexually domineering, effectively enslaving Michiko‚Äîwho due to the on-air incident would have been fired had she not agreed‚Äîby making her lick her lingerie and perform cunnilingus on Keiko. The second episode introduces Kaori Shimamori, a reporter who uses her dad's position as a member of the Diet at Keiko's expense. Kaori conspires to have Keiko demoted after allotting her weather corner during a breaking news report. This effort fails after being flooded with viewer mail protests. Soon after, Keiko and Kaori agree to partner up on a marketing campaign for ATV, though still plotting revenge against Keiko by eavesdropping on her. She soon discovers Keiko's dominatrix relationship with Michiko and becomes friends with Keiko. The OVA ends with a stripping and humiliation of Michiko in which Kaori embraces Keiko's lifestyle and then proceeds to entice Michiko into having oral sex with her while Keiko, half asleep, listens with a smirk. Media The manga, which was serialized from 1992 to 1994, starred all three main characters with a simple plot where the women would try to fight for power and authority at the station by performing sexual acts and domination on each other. The story was remade into a direct-to-video live-action film starring Kei Mizutani in 1995. The video developed a cult following, and it was released theatrically to popular and critical success in 1996.Weisser, Thomas and Yuko Mihara Weisser. (1998).

Of uncertain meaning and presumed to be an individual's name, it is the most easterly point in Waterford.Place Names of the Decies by Rev. P. Power, Royal Irish Academy (London 1907) Historically, it was part of the \\"main road\\" from Cork to London. A ferry crossing from the headland to Templetown on the eastern side of the bay was operated by the Knights Templar. Forty hand-hewn steps, leading down to sea-level, are still evident in the rocks at the headland. It is thought that these steps were also very useful to maritime pilots since the headland is an obvious embarkation and disembarkation point. Smuggling Creadan Head was apparently used as a landing stage for certain goods from ships heading upriver to Waterford, New Ross, Granny and other small ports. Items thus landed were not assessed for taxes and other dues, in other words they were being smuggled. Creadan House is situated at the start of the headland, overlooking a sheltered cove, Creadan Cove or Walls Cove. This cove was also used for landing goods. North of the headland is a sandbar which narrows the navigable channel to the Port of Waterford. This river channel is buoyed from Creaden Head to mark the navigation. Slavery At the base of the peninsula, on the north side, is located a beach or strand known locally as Fornaght Strand or Knockaveelish Strand.

This would appear to support the story that slaves were landed, or trans-shipped, via the steps at the headland. While there are very few references to the use of slaves in Ireland, Irish ship-owners and sea captains did partake in the trade. The slaves were apparently being re-embarked somewhere on the western seaboard and would be walked from Creaden to that point for exercise. It is suggested that the slaves in this instance were thought by the Irish locals to be women since they all (both male and female) wore a type kaftan or flowing garment and in Ireland this type of dress would only be worn by women. Negros in Ireland were called Blue people since in the Irish language a Black man is traditionally the devil. Another theory is even more fanciful. It is suggested that the smugglers using the \\"Forty Steps\\" on the headland dressed as women for disguise and hence the name for the beach. These and other theories for the placename \\"Tr√° na Mn√° Gorm\\" are quite fascinating and are still open to conjecture.

Other artifacts are concerned with the process of development itself‚Äîsuch as project plans, business cases, and risk assessments. The term artifact in connection with software development is largely associated with specific development methods or processes e.g., Unified Process. This usage of the term may have originated with those methods. Build tools often refer to source code compiled for testing as an artifact, because the executable is necessary to carrying out the testing plan. Without the executable to test, the testing plan artifact is limited to non-execution based testing. In non-execution based testing, the artifacts are the walkthroughs, inspections and correctness proofs. On the other hand, execution based testing requires at minimum two artifacts: a test suite and the executable. Artifact occasionally may refer to the released code (in the case of a code library) or released executable (in the case of a program) produced, but more commonly an artifact is the byproduct of software development rather than the product itself. Open source code libraries often contain a testing harness to allow contributors to ensure their changes do not cause regression bugs in the code library. Much of what are considered artifacts is software documentation. In end-user development an artifact is either an application or a complex data object that is created by an end-user without the need to know a general programming language. Artifacts describe automated behavior or control sequences, such as database requests or grammar rules,H. Lieberman, B. A. Nardi, and D. Wright. Grammex: Defining grammars by example. In ACM conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (Summary, Demonstrations; CHI 1998), Los Angeles, California, U.S., pp. 11‚Äì12. ACM Press, Apr. 1998. or user-generated content. Artifacts vary in their maintainability. Maintainability is primarily affected by the role the artifact fulfills. The role can be either practical or symbolic. In the earliest stages of software development, artifacts may be created by the design team to serve a symbolic role to show the project sponsor how serious the contractor is about meeting the project's needs. Symbolic artifacts often convey information poorly, but are impressive-looking. Symbolic enhance understanding. Generally speaking, Illuminated Scrolls are also considered unmaintainable due to the diligence it requires to preserve the symbolic quality. For this reason, once Illuminated Scrolls are shown to the project sponsor and approved, they are replaced by artifacts which serve a practical role. Practical artifacts usually need to be maintained throughout the project lifecycle, and, as such, are generally highly maintainable. Artifacts are significant from a project management perspective as deliverables. The deliverables of a software project are likely to be the same as its artifacts with the addition of the software itself. The sense of artifacts as byproducts is similar to the use of the term artifact in science to refer to something that arises from the process in hand rather than the issue itself, i.e., a result of interest that stems from the means rather than the end. To collect, organize and manage artifacts, a Software development folder may be utilized. // POST: api/Todo [HttpPost] public async Task> PostTodoItem(TodoItem item) { _context.TodoItems.Add(item); await _context.SaveChangesAsync(); return CreatedAtAction(nameof(GetTodoItem), new { id = item.Id }, item); } See also *Artifact (UML) *Software development folder ReferencesFurther reading * Per Kroll & Philippe Kruchten (2003).

Watkins Glen, From Griswold to Gordon: Fifty Years of Competition At the Home of American Road Racing. Biography=Early life Argetsinger grew up in Youngstown, where his father, James Cameron Argetsinger, was general counsel and secretary of the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company. He spent the summers of his boyhood in Schuyler County, New York visiting his grandparents and, later, his family's summer home. He inherited a love of fast cars from his father and in 1947 bought a sports car so he could become a member of the nascent Sports Car Club of America. Watkins Glen Sports Car Grand Prix Before long, Argetsinger began to dream of organizing a sports car race in and around the town of Watkins Glen. \\"It's been said, and it's not entirely wrong, that I did it because I had an MG-TC and didn't have a place to race it,\\" he told The New York Times in 1998.Siano, Joseph. (September 4, 1998). \\"The Hallowed Ground Of Sports Car Racing.\\" The New York Times. From 1948 through 1952, the Watkins Glen Sports Car Grand Prix was held on a circuit that followed public roads through the village and around the nearby gorge. While the event was hugely popular, safety issues, namely the deaths of both drivers and spectators in crashes, forced it to move off the public roads after eight years.O'Malley, J.J. and Green, Bill (1997). Watkins Glen, From Griswold to Gordon: Fifty Years of Competition At the Home of American Road Racing. Pp. 2-4. Home of the United States Grand Prix In 1953, Argetsinger was named Executive Director of the newly formed Watkins Glen Grand Prix Corporation. Three years later, the group purchased of land and built a 2.3-mile permanent racing facility, designed to imitate the winding country roads on which the race had originated. Soon the circuit was attracting some of the world's best road racers, including Stirling Moss, Jo Bonnier, Phil Hill and Dan Gurney, for the Formula Libre races, which ran from 1958 through 1960. These events set the stage for Argetsinger's bid to host the ultimate American road racing event, the Formula One United States Grand Prix. His timing was perfect and after disappointing results in its first two years at Sebring, Florida and Riverside, California, the United States Grand Prix found a home in upstate New York in 1961, and Watkins Glen became the focal point of American road racing for the next two decades.O'Malley, J.J. and Green, Bill (1997). Watkins Glen, From Griswold to Gordon: Fifty Years of Competition At the Home of American Road Racing. Pp. 15-17.Herzog, Brad (2005). Driving Force , Cornell Alumni Magazine. In 1969, Argetsinger attempted to purchase the raceway in order to improve its financial operations. When the Grand Prix Corporation refused to sell, Argetsinger resigned as Executive Director and moved to Midland, Texas, where he went to work for Chaparral Cars. Auto racing executive Argetsinger moved to Denver in 1972 to become the Director of Professional Racing and then Executive Director of the Sports Car Club of America. In 1977, he returned to his law practice in Schuyler County, New York. He became president of the International Motor Racing Research Center in Watkins Glen in 2002. Career Award Argetsinger was a member of the inaugural induction class of the Sports Car Club of America Hall of Fame in 2005. In 2005, Watkins Glen International renamed its trophy for the Indy Racing League race champion the \\"Cameron R. Argetsinger Trophy\\".

It is one of the oldest lighthouses in the worldCommissioners of Irish Lights: \\"Our History\\" and the second oldest operating lighthouse in the world, after the Tower of Hercules in Spain. It is operated by the Commissioners of Irish Lights, the Irish Lighthouse Authority, it marks the eastern entrance to Waterford Harbour. The current structure has stood for 848 years as of 2020. History The Hook Lighthouse appears on the coat of arms of County Wexford. The existing tower dates from the 12th century, though tradition states that Dubh√°n, a missionary to the Wexford area, established a form of beacon as early as the 5th century. The headland is known in Irish as Rinn Dubh√°in, St. Dubh√°n's Head. However, the similar-sounding Irish word 'du√°n' means a fish hook, hence the English name. It is known locally as \\"the Hook.\\" The tower was built by Strongbow's son-in-law William Marshall, Earl of Pembroke, who succeeded Strongbow as Lord of Leinster. Pembroke had established a port in the town of New Ross, approx. 30 km up river. In order for his new port to be successful and for ships to safely reach their destination, Pembroke had a 36m high tower built at the mouth of Waterford Harbour. The exact year of construction is not known, but Pembroke first came to the region in 1201 and the first map that shows the lighthouse serving its function is dated 1240, so construction must have taken place between these dates. The first custodians to the light were a small group of monks whose small monastery was situated on the peninsula. The monks who lived at this monastery would have lit warning fires and beacons all through the years to warn sailors of the dangerous rocks on the peninsula. It was the monks who lived at this monastery in the 13th century that became the first light- keepers. They are also thought to have helped in the construction of the tower. Hook Lighthouse is one of the most fascinating examples of medieval architecture in Ireland. The tower stands four stories high with walls up to 4m thick. The tower itself consists of three rib-vaulted chambers in the lower tier, while the upper, narrower section would have carried the warning beacon. These two tiers are connected with a mural (within the wall) stairway of 115 steps. The tower was constructed of local limestone and the original building survives intact. The first tier is 13m in diameter at the base and has three storeys, each with its original 13th-century stone fireplace. In the thickness of the wall there are a number of mural chambers, including two garderobes (toilets). The upper tier is 6m in diameter: originally it supported the beacon fire, which was later replaced by the lantern. Fog signals were operated at the lighthouse as a warning to seafarers during dense fog which can suddenly descend on the peninsula. The fog signal was essential in days before radar and radio. Fog guns situated at the cliff edge were fired every 10 minutes. These were replaced by explosive charges set from the top of the tower on an extending arm. Finally, a compressed air horn (hooter) blasted every 45 seconds during fog. The monks left the tower and were replaced by the first lighthouse keepers in the mid 17th century. In 1671, a new, but still coal burning lantern was installed on top of the tower to replace the old beacon light. The coal fire was finally abandoned in 1791 when a whale oil lantern 12 ft. in diameter with 12 lamps was installed. This continued until new gas lights were installed in 1871, lit by gas manufactured in the enclosure known as 'the gas yard'. In the 1860s, three dwellings were built for the lighthouse keepers. Paraffin oil became the source of power in 1911, and a clockwork mechanism changed the light from fixed to flashing. This mechanism had to be wound up every 25 minutes by the keeper on duty. Finally, in 1972 electricity became the power source, and light-sensitive switches were installed to control the lantern. In March 1996, The Hook Lighthouse was converted to automatic operation, and the last light-keepers who had climbed the stairs and tended the light were permanently withdrawn from the station. The lighthouse is now remotely controlled from D√∫n Laoghaire by the Commissioners of Irish Lights. In 2001 the light was opened to the public as a tourist attraction after the old keepers houses were turned into a visitor centre. In January 2011 The Hook's fog horn was heard for the last time as all the fog horns were turned off. It was felt that the technology on modern ships was so advanced that the fog horn was no longer required. In June 2011 the structure was placed first in a Lonely Planet piece listing the \\"Top 10 Flashiest Lighthouses\\"; the author described Hook as \\"The great granddaddy of lighthouses\\".Irish Examiner: \\"Lighthouse tops guide book list as world‚Äôs flashiest\\"Ben Handicott (2011) Lonely Planet: \\"Top Ten Flashiest Lighthouses\\" See also * List of lighthouses in Ireland  References  External links * Official Hook Lighthouse and visitor centre website *Commissioners of Irish Lights Lighthouses completed in the 13th century Lighthouses in the Republic of Ireland Buildings and structures in County Wexford Tourist attractions in County Wexford Lighthouse museums Museums in County Wexford Maritime museums in the Republic of Ireland Lighthouses on the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage ","title":"Hook Lighthouse"},{"id":"6303175","text":"Glasgerion is Child ballad 67, (Roud 145), existing in several variants.Francis James Child, English and Scottish Popular Ballads, \\"Glasgerion\\"Roud Folk Song Index, https://www.vwml.org/ Synopsis Glasgerion is a king's son and a harper. He harps before another king, whose daughter arranges a tryst with him. He tells his servant to ensure that he wakes in time to make the tryst. The servant goes in his place and rapes the princess. She learns the truth and kills herself, sometimes because she can not offer herself as Glasgerion's bride. Glasgerion kills his servant and either kills himself as well or goes mad. Motifs The figure of Glasgerion was cited as a harper in Geoffrey Chaucer's The House of Fame and Gavin Douglas's The Palice of Honour.Francis James Child, The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, v 2, p 136, Dover Publications, New York 1965 Adaptations In the 1960s, when the song had long fallen out of the tradition, the scholar and revivalist singer A.L. Lloyd ‚Äòtook it out and dusted it off a bit and set a tune to it and, I hope, started it on a new lease of life‚Äô under the name of Jack Orion.Lloyd‚Äôs sleeve notes to First Person quoted in Reinhard Zierke, ‚ÄòJack Orion‚Äô, in Mainly Norfolk: English Folk and Other Good Music. This version, in which the harpist becomes a fiddler, appeared on his 1966 album First Person with Dave Swarbrick on fiddle. In the same year Bert Jansch made Jack Orion the title track of his third album. His voice is accompanied by his own guitar and that of John Renbourn; their collaboration here can be seen as one of the pinnacles of the so-called folk baroque guitar style. Jack Orion later became part of the repertoire of Pentangle, the band that they formed along with Terry Cox, Jacqui McShee and Danny Thompson, and appears on their 1970 recording Cruel Sister. Martin Carthy and Dave Swarbrick performed Jack Orion on their 1968 album But Two Came By. In the sleeve notes Carthy observed that ‚Äòthe song in its traditional form was, according to evidence at our [his and A. L. Lloyd‚Äôs] disposal, not very widespread, which serves to highlight one of the curious features of the folk revival, that is, the many songs which were not at all common in tradition are very commonly sung in the revival and vice versa.‚ÄôCarthy‚Äôs sleeve notes to But Two Came By, quoted by Reinhard Zierke. The British folk rock band Trees included a version of Glasgerion in The Garden of Jane Delawney, their 1970 debut album.

It is common in middle and high schools in the United States. Sexual or gender harassment is a form of discrimination under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. Sexual harassment involves a range of behavior from mild annoyances to unwanted touching and, in extreme cases, rape or other sexual assault.Dzeich, Billie Wright and Linda Weiner (1990). The Lecherous Professor: Sexual Harassment on Campus, University of Illinois Press.Drawing the Line: Sexual Harassment on Campus (2006), the American Association of University Women The definition of sexual harassment includes harassment by both peers and individuals in a position of power relative to the person being harassed. In schools, though sexual harassment initiated by students is most common, it can also be perpetrated by teachers or other school employees, and the victim can be a student, a teacher, or other school employee. Some have argued that even consensual sexual interactions between students and teachers constitute harassment because the inherent power differential creates a dynamic in which \\"mutual consent\\" is impossible. Statistics In their 2000 survey on 2064 students in 8th through 11th grade, the American Association of University Women (AAUW) reported: * 81% or eight out of 10 students experience sexual harassment in school * 83% of girls have been sexually harassed * 78% of boys have been sexually harassed * 38% of the students were harassed by teachers or school employees * 36% of school employees or teachers were harassed by students * 42% of school employees or teachers had been harassed by each other In their recent study (AAUW 2006) on sexual harassment at colleges and universities, the AAUW claimed that while both men and women were targets of sexual harassment, \\"women are disproportionately negatively affected.\\" *62% of female college students and 61% of male college students report having been sexually harassed at their university. *66% of college students know someone personally who was harassed. *10% or fewer of student sexual harassment victims attempt to report their experiences to a university employee. *35% or more of college students who experience sexual harassment do not tell anyone about their experiences. *80% of students who experienced sexual harassment report being harassed by another student or former student. *39% of students who experienced sexual harassment say the incident or incidents occurred in the dorm. *51% of male college students admit to sexually harassing someone in college, with 22% admitting to harassing someone often or occasionally. *31% of female college students admit to harassing someone in college. *Over 70% of LGBT college students have experienced sexual harassment. In the \\"Report Card on Gender Equity,\\" the NCWGE that 30 percent of undergraduate students, and 40 percent of graduate students, have been sexually harassed. (NCWGE, 1997) The Associated Press reported 2,500 cases of teacher sexual misconduct between 2002 and 2007. From 2001 to 2005, 2,570 teacher credentials were revoked for sexual misconduct. There were about 3 million teachers at the time.  Demographics  Gender = According to surveys conducted by the AAUW in 1993 and 2001: * While in both surveys, female students reported experiencing sexual harassment more than the male students, the percentage of male students reporting sexual harassment increased from 49% in 1993 to 56% in 2001. * In 2001, female students who had been sexually harassed in school reported male-to-female harassment that was one-on-one while male students who experienced sexual harassment reported either one-to-one harassment by a female, or harassment by a group of females. = Race = In the same surveys (AAUW 1993, 2001) it was found that: * 21% of white male students reported having had someone tug at or pull down their clothing in an inappropriate way, while only 10% of African American male students reported this. * While 51% of Hispanic and 51% of white female students experienced being touched in an inappropriate, sexual manner, 67% of African American females experienced this. * 18% of Hispanic, 15% of white, and 28% of African American female students reported having been forced to kiss someone. * 30% of Hispanic, 32% of white, and 50% of African American female students have had someone tug or pull down their clothing in an inappropriate way.  Types  There are three primary types of sexual harassment found in schools: verbal, visual/non-verbal, and physical. The most common type is verbal, followed by physical, and visual/non-verbal. In the survey conducted by the AAUW in 2000, it was found that 6 out of 10, or 58% of the students reported experiencing some form of physical harassment at some point during their time in school, and 76% reported experiencing nonphysical (verbal or visual/nonverbal) at some point during their time in school.  Verbal  Verbal sexual harassment includes unwanted sexual humor, sexual rumors, inappropriate sexual name calling, and homophobic slurs, judging or rating others' body parts, pressure for sexual relationships, and sexual harassment via phone calls.  Visual/non-verbal  Visual/non-verbal sexual harassment includes unwanted written sexual communication (notes, text messages, letters, email), unwanted sexual facial expressions or gestures, indecent exposure, and the showing of sexual pictures.  Physical  Physical sexual harassment includes sexually brushing against someone, having one's clothing pulled or tugged in a sexual manner, unwanted sexual touching, and any forced kissing or touching. Peer- to-peer Most sexually harassing behavior is student-on-student. In \\"The Report Card on Gender Equity\\", by the National Coalition for Women and Girls in Education (NCWGE), it was reported that, of students who have been sexually harassed, 90% were harassed by other students. (NCWGE, 1997) And in their 2006 report on sexual harassment in higher education, the AAUW reported that 80% of students sexually harassed were targeted by other students. (AAUW, 2006) One of the most common reasons reported for sexually harassing behavior is because the harasser thinks it is funny to do so. In their 2006 study, the AAUW found that this was the most common rationale for harassment by boys‚Äî59 percent used it. Less than one-fifth (17%) of those boys who admitted to harassing others say they did so because they wanted a date with the person. (AAUW, 2006) Other researchers assert that the \\"I thought it was funny\\" rationale is a fallacy, and the true reasons align more with that of a need to assert power and induce fear in others‚Äîmore in line with bullying. These hazing behaviors develop in school, continue in high school and college, eventually moving into the workplace. (Boland, 2002) In late 2006/early 2007 a study revealed that more than 20% of all boys had been harassed by a female student. In 15% of all cases the girl admitted to sexually harassing the boy and asserted the reasons of \\"I thought it was funny\\" and \\"I'm not doing any harm, it's what he wanted\\". High schools are addressing this behavior.1 Proceedings of the National Union of Teachers, United Kingdom, 2007 Peer-to-peer sexual harassment is three times more likely than perpetration by teachers or other school faculty. Sexual harassment between peers may also be a result of students trying to conform to expected gender norms created by society. It can also be used as a tool for gender policing. For example, this could be seen if a male is exhibiting behavior not seen to peers as being masculine, so others may label him with homophobic slurs in order to reinforce gender conformity through a form of nonphysical sexual harassment. Students may exhibit, accept, or tolerate this conforming behavior as to not cause rifts in peer groups. Developmental causes may also result in sexual harassment among students. Those who are unprepared to interact with those of the opposite sex, are unable to appropriately read social cues, or try to exhibit sexual interest in another while not understanding appropriate boundaries, may end up engaging in sexually harassing behavior. By teachers=Prevalence In their 2002 survey, the AAUW reported that, of students who had been harassed, 38% were harassed by teachers or other school employees. One survey that was conducted with psychology students reports that 10% had sexual interactions with their educators; in turn, 13% of educators reported sexual interaction with their students. In a national survey conducted for the American Association of University Women Educational Foundation in 2000, it was found that roughly 290,000 students experienced some sort of physical sexual abuse by a public school employee between 1991 and 2000. A major 2004 study commissioned by the U.S. Department of Education found that nearly 10 percent of U.S. public school students reported having been targeted with sexual attention by school employees. Indeed, one critic has claimed that sexual harassment and abuse by teachers is 100 times more frequent than abuse by priests. retrieved January 15, 2009 A secondary analysis of a series of surveys conducted for the AAUW and administered to a representative sample of 2,064 8th through 11th-grade American students in 2000 showed that 9.6% of the students reported educator sex abuse. The students were asked if and how often they had experienced 14 types of behaviors which constitute sexual harassment. They then indicated who harassed them (students, teachers, school employees). Nonphysical sexual abuse (e.g., making sexual jokes) was more prevalent than physical abuse (8.7 and 6.7%). Girls were more likely to report educator sexual harassment than boys (10.3 and 8.8%). 12.3% of black, 12.2% of Latino, 8.4% of white and 1,8 % of Asian students indicated that they had experienced sexual harassment by teachers. Regional studies found a different prevalence of sexual harassment by teachers. For example, in a survey of 148 high school graduates in North Carolina in 1989 the graduates were given a definition of sexual harassment and asked if they had experienced sexual harassment during their high school years. 43% reported inappropriate comments, looks, or gestures by a teacher, 17.5% reported sexual touching, and 13.5% indicated that they have had sexual intercourse with a teacher. In another study college students were asked to recall if they or other students had experienced sexual harassment by high school teachers. 6.5% of the respondents reported having personally experienced sexually inappropriate attention from high school teachers. Furthermore, more than 33% said that they knew of a sexual relationship between a high school student and a teacher. Psychology and behaviors of perpetrators Most complaints about a teacher's behavior tend to center around what is felt to be inappropriate speech in a class or discussion, such as using sexist or sexual references to make a point. However, in some cases, bonds and relationships can form between teacher and student beyond class discussions. Relationships between students and teachers can be often quite intimate and intense as they share common passions and interests. Students are dependent on their teachers' approval for academic success, opportunities, and later career success. They will talk about personal issues, such as problems at home, or with boyfriends/girlfriends. Such closeness and intimacy can blur the professional boundaries and lead people‚Äîboth school employee and student alike‚Äîto step over the line. Martin writes, > ...teachers hold positions of trust. They are expected to design teaching > programmes and carry out their teaching duties to help their students > develop as mature thinkers. This may involve close working relationships in > tutorials or laboratories, individual meetings to discuss projects or > essays, and more casual occasions for intellectual give and take. For > impressionable young students, the boundaries between intellectual > development and personal life may become blurred. In this situation, some > academics easily move from intellectual to personal to sexual relationships. A teacher who harasses a student may be doing so because he or she is experiencing the stress from various personal problems or life traumas, such as marital trouble or divorce, a professional crisis, financial difficulties, medical problems, or the death of a spouse or child. Even though the behavior is unacceptable, it can be a symptom of the effects of such stresses, and may stop if the situation changes, or the pressures are removed. Sexual relationships between students and teachers There has been debate over whether or not sexual interactions and relationships between students and teachers constitute sexual abuse. While sexual relationships with pupils is illegal in the U.S., this is not the case in higher education. Literature professor Jane Gallop argues that students learn more effectively in a sexually charged atmosphere. In her book, she describes the separate occasions she slept with two male professors on her dissertation committee, and when she first began sleeping with her own students as an assistant professor. (Gallop, 1997). In her September 2001 essay in Harper's Magazine, The Higher Yearning, academic Christina Nehring celebrated the educative nature of such sexual relationships: \\"Teacher-student chemistry is what fires much of the best work that goes in universities, even today\\". However, in recent years, there has been controversy over consensual sexual interactions between students and teachers, especially within the last decade.chronicle.com Like many, Gallop asserts that the relationships between a teacher and a student is very much like that of a parent and a child. (Gallop, 1997) However, it is this parallel that many say is the reason teacher-pupil sexual contact and relations are immoral because they are too closely akin to incest, and similar long-term damages can result. Many experts argue that even consensual sexual interactions between students and teachers constitute sexual harassment. The most commonly expressed concern is over whether \\"mutual consent\\" can exist in a relationship where there is such a disparity in power between the people involved. Because of this, more and more schools are adopting policies that forbid amorous relationships between students and professors \\"in the instructional context\\" even when they are consenting (Smithson, 1990). Dzeich et al. writes: In an interview with the Chronicle of Higher Education, a dean at the University of Texas at Austin stated he'd like to crack down on consensual relationships between professors and students. \\"Wait until she graduates,\\" he says he tells male professors. \\"We have a kind of sacred trust to the students,\\" he explains. \\"They're coming here to get us to evaluate what their abilities are and what their future could be. These relationships poison the whole academic well.\\"chronicle.com Dzeich argues that much damage occurs because of the betrayal by someone that the student trusted and respected. Moreover, seduction attempts which are masked by pretenses to academic and personal attention are particularly damaging because the student feels complicit in their own abuse. (Dzeich 1990) Another consequence is that, when sex is an accepted behavior between teachers and students, it can be more difficult to raise concerns about sexual harassment. For example, unwanted sexual advances by a professor may be intimidating or even frightening; however, if sexual relations between staff and students is common at the school, it will be difficult for a student to identify this behavior as harassment. (Martin, 1993) = Abuse of trust and conflicts of interest = Sexual relations between teachers and students raises concerns about the abuse of trust and conflicts of interest‚Äîand these points are not usually covered in sexual harassment policies. The question of abuse of trust comes into play when sexual relations between teacher and student are present. This occurs when the trust associated with a professional relationship is destroyed because of non-professional actions or requests for non-professional actions. Martin writes, \\"Teachers are in a position of authority and trust to foster the intellectual development of their students. When they engage in sexual relations with a student, they violate that trust implicit in a professional teacher-student relationship.\\" (Martin, 1993) Conflicts of interest can arise when the professional responsibilities of a teacher are affected, or appear to be affected, by a special personal relationship with a student. These can include showing favoritism towards a student sexually involved with the teacher, or hostility towards a student due to a past relationship. If a teacher is sexually involved with a student, colleagues may feel pressured to give preferential treatment to the student, such as better marks, extensions on essays, extra help, or academic opportunities. When there are multiple relationships between several staff and students, the possibilities for conflict of interest are enormous. Even if there is no favoritism or hostility, it can be perceived by others to be exhibited.  Special education  Like all other students, students with disabilities experience sexual harassment in school as victims and perpetrators. Some disabilities could cause a lack of control over impulses, a lack of awareness of the effects of their words and actions, and a lack of social skills needed to avoid sexually harassing behavior. In some circumstances, a student with disabilities could exhibit a behavior that would constitute sexual harassment without intentionally trying to be malicious or inappropriate. In these cases, where a disability could lead to sexually harassing behaviors, positive behavior intervention plans are often put into place by a team often including parents, school administrators, general education teachers, special education teachers, school psychologists, and counselors. These types of plans could also be made during Individualized Education Program meetings regarding the student.Young, Ellie; Allen, Melissa; Ashbaker, Betty (2004). \\"Responding to Sexual Harassment in Special Education Settings\\". Teaching Exceptional Children 36 (4). Effects= In higher education  In their 2006 report, \\"Drawing the Line: Sexual Harassment on Campus\\" the AAUW found physical and emotional effects from sexual harassment on female students: *68% of female students felt very or somewhat upset by sexual harassment they experienced; *6% were not at all upset. *57% of female students who have been sexually harassed reported feeling self-conscious or embarrassed *55% of female students who have been sexually harassed reported feeling angry. *32% of female students who have been sexually harassed reported feeling afraid or scared. The AAUW also found that sexual harassment affects academics and achievement: > Students experience a wide range of effects from sexual harassment that > impact their academic development including: have trouble sleeping, loss of > appetite, decreased participation in class, avoid a study group, think about > changing schools, change schools, avoid the library, change major, not gone > to a professor/ teaching assistant's office hours. Students may experience > multiple effects or just one. The wide range of experiences lowers the > percentage of students who experience any particular effect. *16% of female students who have been sexually harassed found it hard to study or pay attention in class. *9% of female students dropped a course or skipped a class in response to sexual harassment. *27% of female students stay away from particular buildings or places on campus as a result of sexual harassment. In the same 2006 report, the AAUW also found effects from sexual harassment on male and LGBT students: * 35% of male college students reported feeling very or somewhat upset about being sexually harassed. * 61% of male students reported feeling not very upset or not at all upset about experiencing sexual harassment. * 20% of male students reported feeling worried about sexual harassment, to some extent. * 60% of LGBT college students who were sexually harassed tried to avoid their harasser. * 24% of LGBT college students who were sexually harassed had difficulties paying attention in class and studying. * 17% of LGBT college students who had experienced sexual harassment have considered transferring to a different school and 9% made the transfer. In 2018, a national advisory report of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine found that sexual harassment is rampant in academic science and concluded that sexual harassment should be treated as seriously as research misconduct. To report such behaviour is difficult for those concerned, given that scientists-in-training often dependent on a single high-profile mentor for research funding, job recommendations and fieldwork.  In K-12 education  Studies have shown that if the sexual harassment was done by a male, both male and female victims experienced behavioral problems, in contrast to if the female was the perpetrator, where the behavioral problems occurred less. Being absent from school frequently, having difficulties concentrating on school work, and performing poorly on academic work often result. In a 2011 nationwide survey conducted by the AAUW of 7th-12th grade students, 32% of students who had experienced sexual harassment did not want to return to school after it occurred. This included 37% of female students and 25% of male students. 31% of the surveyed students felt physically sick after being sexually harassed, with 37% of females and 21% of males reporting this effect. 30% of students had difficulties studying and focusing on school as a result of sexual harassment including 34% of females and 24% of males, and 19% of students reported having a difficult time sleeping due to sexual harassment, including 22% of females and 14% of males. Other effects include getting into trouble at school, changing the route in which one gets to and from school, and stopping doing activities and sports. By teachers A reanalysis of the AAUW data found that victims of sexual harassment by teachers reported experiencing adverse health effects because of the abuse. 28% said that they had trouble sleeping and lost their appetite, 51% reported feeling embarrassed, and 37% indicated that they felt less sure of themselves or less confident as a result of the sexual harassment. Furthermore, 36% of the students said that they were afraid or scared and 29% reported feeling confused about their identity. In addition to negatively affecting health outcomes, teacher sexual abuse influenced the victims' academic performance. The affected students avoided the teacher (43%), they did not want to go to school (36%), avoided talking in class (34%), had trouble paying attention (31%), cut classes (29%), or found it hard to study (29%). =The gender double standard= Some sources have discussed a double standard regarding the conduct of female versus male teachers. When it comes to sexual harassment or sexual abuse cases involving a male teacher as the perpetrator to a female student, severe punishments are often the result. According to David Ring, a lawyer working with sexual abuse cases, it is not uncommon for the male teachers to be convicted, face jail time, or owe partial civil damages to the student victim depending on the severity of the case. When a female teacher is the perpetrator of sexual harassment to a male student, there are arguments that the female teachers are given lighter sentences and the male victims are given lower amounts of compensation due to the reasoning that teenage males would be willing to have sexual encounters with older, female teachers as a response to changes in their hormones. It has been argued that the effects of pupil-teacher sexual harassment vary depending on the gender of the student and the harasser. In some states in the U.S., sexual relations between a woman and an underage male did not even constitute statutory rape until the 1970s. Many assert that most boys would be happy to have a teacher show sexual interest in them. While the effects vary from student to student, evidence shows that both male and female victims exhibit similar psychological effects from pupil-teacher sexual harassment. In the long term, experts have suggested that victims experience issues with depression, addiction, and age-appropriate relationships.How Evil Works: Understanding and Overcoming the Destructive Forces That Are Transforming America. David Kupelian. Simon & Schuster, 2010. Page 36. Complaints In 1999, roughly 14% of complaints to the U.S. Department of Education Office of Civil Rights (OCR) involved sex discrimination. \\"Sexual harassment is as serious (and some would say more serious) a problem as it is in the workplace....(it) is not a new phenomena. But it is only recently that the Supreme Court has said that schools can be held liable for money damages for sexual harassment.\\" The U.S. judicial system does not analyze the types of harassment in the same way they do harassment in the workplace. Instead, the US Supreme Court ruled in Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School District (1998) that it \\"will not hold a school district liable in damages under Title IX for a teacher's sexual harassment of a student absent actual notice and deliberate indifference.\\"Gebser v Lago Vista Independent School District, 524 U.S. 274 (1998), at 292-293 However, many harassment targets fear to make reports because of the possible repercussions. Of the women who have approached her to share their own experiences of being sexually harassed by their professors, feminist and writer Naomi Wolf writes, > I am ashamed of what I tell them: that they should indeed worry about making > an accusation because what they fear is likely to come true.

Gwinnett County (GA) Public Schools (1992)  In 1992, the Supreme Court decided that, out of the violation of their civil rights, students who were victims of sexual harassment have the right to seek monetary damages from their school district. This was a major step taken by the Supreme Court where before this decision, compensation was not up for grabs from the damage in sexual harassment cases.  Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education  In 1994, when a judge ruled that the school district was not liable for the sexual harassment that occurred when a fifth grade boy allegedly made attempts to inappropriately touch a female student, the case made its way to the Supreme Court. In 1999, the Supreme Court decided that once sexual harassment among peers has been reported to a school district, they must be held responsible.  Bruneau v. South Kortright (NY) Central School District (1996)  When a sixth grade girl was sexually harassed by some of her male peers, under Title IX, she was able to file charges against her school district, teacher, and assistant superintendent, and receive compensation for the damages. Ultimately, because the school district was made aware of the situation and failed to address it, they were found liable for this incident.  Handling in schools  Schools, under Title IX, are required to investigate a situation where there is a report of sexual harassment as well as formally addressing the issue to students, staff, and parents as a preventative measure.Charmarman, Linda; Jones, Ashleigh; Stein, Nan; Espelage, Dorothy (2013). \\"Is it bullying or sexual harassment? Knowledge, attitudes, and professional development experiences of middle school staff\\". Journal of school health 83 (6). doi:10.1111/josh.12048 In a study conducted by the AAUW in 2011, of 7th to 12th grade students, only 12% of the surveyed students felt that their school did enough to address sexual harassment.  In colleges and universities  When college students were surveyed, it was found that 35% do not tell anyone about a sexual harassment occurrence, 49% tell a friend, and only 7% go to a school faculty member to report the incident. Female students especially were noted to hesitate to report these incidents in fear that the incidents are not important enough or a large enough deal. 54% of the surveyed college students listed this as a reason for not reporting sexual harassment.  Policies and procedures  79% of surveyed college students know of sexual harassment policies in their colleges. The U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights has mandated that schools create policies for sexual harassment as well as procedures for how to handle reports of these instances. The Office for Civil Rights' guidelines for effective sexual harassment policies include: * Issuing a policy against sex discrimination * Incorporating grievance procedures * Creating specific investigation plans and timelines * Explaining where one can file a report * Designating one person (at least) to be the Title IX coordinator for complaints and provide the school faculty and students with that person's contact information * Creating a disciplinary plan for the perpetrators * Ensuring that all of the sexual harassment policies and procedures are easily accessible to students, teachers, faculty, and parentsLitchy, Lauren; Torres, Jennifer; Valenti, Maria; Buchanan, Nicole (2008). \\"Sexual Harassment Policies in K-12 Schools: Examining Accessibility to Students and Content\\". Journal of School Health. Along with sexual harassment policies in colleges and universities, brochures or informational handouts are often distributed, and there are often designated locations or personnel on campus where victims can report sexual harassment. Under Title IX, schools that receive federal funding must designate a coordinator to whom those who need to report sexual harassment can go to, as well as who can receive suggestions and feedback from students on how to improve upon how the school is dealing with sexual harassment. This is required of all schools who receive federal funding, not only in higher education.  Prevention  Aside from dealing with sexual harassment as it occurs, using the designated procedures, prevention is often used to eliminate sexual harassment before it begins, particularly in schools. The U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights has stated that training is part of the prevention of sexual harassment in schools and in their 2001 publishing of Sexual Harassment Guidance: Harassment of Students by School Employees, Other Students or Third Parties, they have indicated that not only should academic institutions provide faculty and teacher training, but also provide students with classroom resources in order to make them aware of what constitutes sexual harassment and what to do if it occurs.Ramson, Amy (2006). \\"Editor's Choice: Sexual Harassment Education on Campus: Communication Using Media\\". Community College Review 33 (3/4). It is often recommended that consistent anti-sexual harassment workshops begin in the younger grades so that students remain informed and the policies are strongly enforced.Harassment- Free Hallways.

It was started in 2005 by Eduardo Montealegre and other members of the Constitutional Liberal Party (Partido Liberal Constitucionalista ‚Äì PLC) who opposed former President of the country Arnoldo Alem√°n's continued control of the PLC even after he had been found guilty of misuse of public funds, and was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Montealegre also opposed the political alliance, commonly referred to as 'El Pacto', between Alem√°n as head of the PLC and Daniel Ortega, head of the Sandinist National Liberation Front (Frente Sandinista de Liberaci√≥n Nacional ‚Äì FSLN). In addition to bringing in other liberal groups such as the Independent Liberal Party and the New Liberal Party, the ALN formed an alliance with the Conservative Party of Nicaragua (Partido Conservador ‚Äì PC), a minor party in terms of political strength, but historically an important one. The Nicaraguan Liberal Alliance is now recognized by the acronym ALN-PC. The vice-presidential candidate for the ALN- PC was Fabricio Cajina, formerly a member of the FSLN. The ALN was known as the Liberal Salvation Movement ( - MSL) until 2006. During the election campaign, several more parties joined the Nicaraguan Liberal Alliance, including the Nicaraguan Democratic Movement, the Social Conservative Party, and the movement that those parties had been part of, the Alliance for the Republic. At the 2006 elections, the ALN-PC candidate Eduardo Montealegre came in second place with 28% of the vote, too far behind the winner, FSLN candidate Daniel Ortega, to qualify for a runoff under the Nicaraguan election system. In the congressional elections, the ALN came in third place, gaining about 23 of the 92 seats. In the 2011 elections, the party garnered less than 1% of the vote in the Presidential and Parliamentary vote. The party is strongly supported by the United States embassy in Managua.

It is an international nongovernmental organization working on penal and criminal justice reform worldwide. Activities PRI's stated goal is to promote safe and secure societies where offenders are held to account, victims‚Äô rights are recognised, sentences are proportionate and the primary purpose of prison is social rehabilitation not retribution. PRI has five offices worldwide. PRI‚Äôs Head Office in London (UK) leads and coordinates its cross-regional programmes, international policy and advocacy activities. Its regional offices in the Middle East and North Africa, Central and Eastern Europe, Central Asia and the South Caucasus implement practical programmes and provide technical assistance at a national and regional level. PRI also currently delivers programmes through partners in East Africa and South Asia. PRI has consultative status at the United Nations (ECOSOC), the Inter- Parliamentary Union, the African Commission on Human and Peoples‚Äô Rights, the African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child and the Council of Europe. PRI produces information resources for policy-makers and criminal justice agencies, including research reports, policy briefings and training materials. Publications include Making Law and Policy that Work and more recently, Global Prison Trends, an annual overview of current trends and challenges in policy and practice in the criminal justice and penal fields. History PRI was founded in 1989 by a group of criminal justice and human rights activists after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Founder members include Ahmed Othmani, a former Tunisian political prisoner and activist, and Baroness Vivien Stern. Since its establishment, PRI has worked at the United Nations to improve norms and standards to strengthen the protection of the rights of people in criminal justice systems. It helped to negotiate the 2010 United Nations Rules for the Treatment of Women Prisoners and Non-Custodial Measures for Women Offenders.

Lieutenant (j.g.) (‰∏≠Â∞â) Sasai was killed leading his fighter squadron during an attack on Henderson Field during the Battle of Guadalcanal. Early life left Junichi Sasai was born on February 13, 1918 in Tokyo. He was the son of a captain of the Japanese Imperial Navy, and even in his youth, Sasai was destined to enter the navy. Sasai‚Äôs childhood was marked by poor health, and he was always mobbed by his classmates. Physical exercises like judo, together with a balanced diet, improved his health. Sasai attended Tokyo Municipal High School No. 1. He went on to the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy at Eta Jima,Main Building at Eta Jima, Imperial Naval Academy an island off the coast of Kure, Hiroshima. Junichi Sasai held a black belt in judo and competed in wrestling. In his early days at the Eta Jima Academy, he earned the nickname \\"gamecock\\" because of his stamina and vehemence for life. After graduating from the 67th Naval Academy Class and being appointed an ensign (Â∞ëÂ∞â) in 1939, Sasai enrolled in the 35th Aviation Student Course. He finished his naval aviation training in November 1941 and became a fighter pilot. Sasai‚Äôs brother-in-law, Lieutenant Commander Yoshio Tashiro, was also a naval aviator, serving as a flying boat commander. World War II Sasai standing before a crashed Curtiss P-40 in the Dutch East Indies, 1941. On December 10, 1941, Ensign Sasai, as a member of the Tainan Air Group, which would become one of the Navy's premier fighter units, participated in the Pacific War's opening actions in the Philippines during the attack on Luzon, but he was forced to abort the mission due to engine trouble. On February 2, 1942, Sasai got his first aerial kill in the Dutch East Indies at Maospati airfield, Java, when he downed a Dutch Brewster Buffalo. Sixteen days later, Sasai knocked down a Curtiss P-40E of 17th Squadron, with the machine guns of his Mitsubishi A6M Zero.Mitsubishi Zero A6M2 Type 21 Papua New Guinea Sasai wearing flight gear. This 1942 photo shows Sasai shortly before his death over Guadalcanal on August 26. The Tainan K≈çk≈´tai (Air Group) was transferred to Lae on Papua New Guinea in March 1942, reorganizing with new officers. Among his Tainan equals, Sasai was known as \\"Flying Tiger\\", a reference to the tiger-head belt buckle he wore always, a gift from his father. In his lodgings, he kept an image of Minamoto no Yoshitsune, the legendary Japanese war hero. Already a lieutenant (j.g.), Sasai became Buntaicho (squadron leader), leading the 3rd Chutai (squadron), consisting of six planes, divided in two Shotai's (sections). Each squadron leader's Zero was recognisable by two light blue diagonal stripes across its fuselage, while each section leader'sA6M2b Zero Model 21, Shotai Leader (blue diagonal stripe across its fuselage), V-107, Tainan K≈çk≈´tai bore one. On each tail, there was a black letter V,A restored Zero A6M2 of the Tainan Group at Canberra War Memorial, Australia the Tainan Group identifier, followed by a three-digit number in the 100s series identifying each aircraft. Sasai was now flying with experienced pilots in his squadron, including Sabur≈ç Sakai, Enji Kakimoto and Toshio Ohta. Sabur≈ç Sakai, leading the second section in Sasai‚Äôs squadron, was an experienced aviator, having flown aerial combat since early in the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1938 and 1939. Sasai learned the art of aerial combat from the experienced Sakai and the two of them became a great team. Sasai became an ace pilot and owed his life and much of his development as a fighter pilot to Sakai. Sasai was considered an exceptional officer by his subordinates, mainly for his compassionate qualities. In private, he ridiculed the inflexibility and austerity of the navy caste system. Such disdain was demonstrated amply by the level of personal interest he took in his NCO subordinates. The Japanese caste system was strict, but Sasai cared more for his fliers. Sabur≈ç Sakai, flying as a warrant officer and section leader in Sasai‚Äôs squadron, said in an interview:Interview with Saburo Sakai by Colin D. Heaton and Jeffrey L. Ethell On April 11, Lieutenant Sasai led nine Zeros scouting over Moresby in three \\"V\\" formations. The Japanese had not adopted the finger-four formation that had become common practice in Europe, instead flying in sections of three planes in a staggered formation, the second plane about one hundred yards behind and above the leader and the third on the other side another hundred yards further away, both wingmen weaving as they kept watch for enemy aircraft. \\"V-174\\", a Zero Model A6M3 Type 32 of the Tainan K≈çk≈´tai. On May 4, 1942, Sasai became an ace, when he shot down three Bell P-39 Airacobras in only 20 seconds. On May 24, Sasai downed a North American B-25 Mitchell from the 13th US Squadron, 3rd Bomb Group. On July 11, 1942, Lieutenant (j.g.) Sasai led 12 Zeros providing fighter escort for 21 bombers from Rabaul heading for Port Moresby. En route, they encountered six Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses of the 19th Bomb Group. Sasai gave the order to attack the B-17s, so Sakai, Nishizawa, Ohta and two others joined Sasai. They failed to shoot down any of the B-17s, and lost one of their Zeros in the effort. The dissipation of the close air support fighters left the bomber attack subject to interdiction by Port Moresby's fighters, and the attack was disrupted. Sasai received a severe reprimand for leaving his bombers. According to Sakai, Sasai's decision was poor, but he and the rest of the pilots sympathized with him because bombers had been hitting their base regularly and that they all wanted to get a piece of the B-17s that had been giving them so much trouble.\\"Samurai!\\" by Saburo Sakai, Fred Saito and Martin Caidin, p. 133. On August 2, Sasai attacked a B-17 using a new head-on tactic, shooting the four-engined bomber down. Rabaul Zero Type 21 at Rabaul with Hanabuki volcano as background. The volcano's continuous activity was a good visual guide for the pilots. The Tainan Air Group moved from Lae to Lakunai airfield on Rabaul the next day. Rabaul soon would be named \\"the fighter pilot graveyard\\" by the Japanese not only because of the fierce combat, but also because malaria, mosquitoes and various tropical diseases decimated the Japanese pilots. Unlike the Americans, who treated their airbases with DDT, the Japanese had no similar solution. On August 7, word arrived that U.S. Marines had landed at 5:20 that morning on Guadalcanal. Due to bad weather, the Allied expeditionary force had arrived undetected by the Japanese. Without delay, 17 Zeros of the Tainan Group escorted 27 Mitsubishi G4M Betty bombers of the 4th Ku. in an attack on the U.S. Navy task force supporting the invasion. The Japanese were met by 18 Grumman F4F-4 Wildcat fighters and 16 Douglas Douglas SBD-3 Dauntless dive bombers from the aircraft carriers Saratoga, Enterprise and Wasp. From mid-1942, F4F Wildcat fighter pilots used a new aerial combat tactic, the \\"Thach Weave\\", developed by the US naval aviators John Thach and Edward O'Hare. The Zero pilots from Rabaul were initially confounded by this double-team maneuver. Nevertheless, Sasai was credited with five F4Fs in this first air battle between land-based Zeros and American carrier fighters. During this same engagement, Sabur≈ç Sakai, leading the second section in Sasai's squadron, sustained grievous injuries from the return fire of carrier-based bombers he had mistaken for Wildcats. After a few days in the hospital, Sakai was informed that he would be returning to Japan for eye surgery. The evening before his departure, Sasai bade him farewell at his bedside, giving him his tiger-head belt buckle and saying to him, \\"Please go back to Japan and please come back to Rabaul!\\" Final mission Illustration of a U.S. Marine F4F-4 Wildcat shoots down a Japanese A6M2 Zero over Henderson Field on Guadalcanal. On August 26, 1942, on his 76th sortie with the Tainan Group, Sasai led eight Zeros escorting Betty bombers to Henderson Field, a main focus of months of fighting in the Guadalcanal campaign, as it enabled U.S. land-based airpower to hinder the Japanese attempts at resupplying its soldiers. At that time, Sasai's score stood at 27. Over Guadalcanal, Sasai attacked an F4F Wildcat that was already in the traffic pattern. The Wildcat dived for the cover of antiaircraft guns, then gave chase. The Zero turned to engage from overhead; the Grumman pulled its nose into the vertical, firing its six .50-caliber machine guns. The lack of self-sealing fuel tanks made Japanese Zeros easy to ignite with a few rounds of incendiary tracers. Sasai‚Äôs Zero exploded in a ball of fire, showering parts onto the beach of Guadalcanal in front of hundreds of U.S. Marines. Lieutenant Junichi Sasai died at the age of 24. He was probably the target of Captain (later Major) Marion E. Carl, an 18.5-victory ace of Marine squadron VMF-223, one of the few Midway-based pilots to survive the Battle of Midway. He had been one of the first Marine pilots to land at Henderson Field less than a week before, and since then, he had downed three more aircraft to become the Marine Corps‚Äô first ace. Sasai, a lieutenant junior grade, was posthumously promoted two grades to lieutenant commander. This practice was common for Japanese aviators with proven records or high scores who were killed during the war. Sasai was also honored with a mention in an all-units bulletin of the Japanese Navy. With his father, he is buried at Tama Cemetery in Fuch≈´, Tokyo.

The canal has been cut through a forested moraine not far from the pumping station on the Wenham side. The Salem Beverly Waterway Canal, sometimes called the Grand Wenham Canal, is an aqueduct canal in Topsfield and Wenham, Massachusetts. It was never used to transport anything but water and recreational canoeists. The canal was built in 1917 to provide water for Beverly, Massachusetts and Salem, Massachusetts, and is owned with its adjacent land by the Salem-Beverly Water Commission. It was dredged and widened in 1974, with gravel roads built on each side of the canal. The canal carries water from the Ipswich River, Topsfield, through the Wenham Swamp to Wenham. From there, a pipeline also constructed in 1917 carries it to Wenham Lake. History In 1911 the State Board of Health was directed by the General Court of Massachusetts to investigate the feasibility of diverting water from the Ipswich River to augment the dwindling water supply of the Salem-Beverly region. The resulting House Document No. 1652, January, 1912, caused the legislature in Chapter 85 of the Resolves of 1912 to appoint a three-man commission to study water-supply issues in most of the towns and cities of northeastern Massachusetts. In House Document No. 2200, the commission took a strong stand in favor of diversion. The prevailing sentiment was that water needed so badly for drinking should not be wasted in Ipswich Bay. Ipswich by then had long ceased to be a commercial port, in favor of Newburyport and Boston. Environmental issues concerning the fate of the wetlands were far in the future. Chapter 700 of the Acts of 1913 created the Salem and Beverly Water Supply Board and gave it the right to divert Ipswich River flows over 20 million gallons per day, up to 2500 million gallons per year, in December through May, at a certain location in Topsfield (approximately the mouth of the canal). In 1917 a canal was excavated from the Ipswich River through Wenham Swamp to a pumping station in Wenham, where it was pumped up to nearby Wenham Lake, a reservoir. The board declined construction of artificial impoundments on the river or canal as unfeasible. In fact, in times of high water, three channels in the bank of the modern canal allow water to flow freely into or out of the swamp, which is part of the Ipswich River wetlands.

The series is directed by Toshiyuki Tsuru, written by Y≈çsuke Kuroda, and animated by Madhouse. The series follows Brandon Heat and Harry MacDowell as they rise through the ranks of the Millennion crime syndicate. Gungrave aired on TV Tokyo from October 7, 2003, to March 30, 2004, totaling twenty-six episodes. Like the Gungrave video game, and its sequel Gungrave: Overdose, the series' music is provided by Tsuneo Imahori; this also includes the series' opening theme. In 2003, Geneon Entertainment, formally Pioneer Entertainment, announced the license of Gungrave in North America.\\"AX2003 - Pioneer Acquisitions\\". Anime News Network. July 5, 2003. 2009-12-23. On July 3, 2008, Geneon Entertainment and Funimation Entertainment announced an agreement to distribute select titles in North America after Geneon ceased distribution of their own titles in October 2007. While Geneon Entertainment will still retain the license, Funimation Entertainment will assume exclusive rights to the manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution of select titles. Gungrave was announced as one of the several titles under the agreement on December 30, 2008. As of November 26, 2010, Funimation has fully licensed the anime series. The anime series returned to US television on May 11, 2011 on the Funimation Channel. Plot Gungrave opens thirteen years after Brandon Heat is betrayed and killed by his best friend Harry MacDowell. He is reborn through the use of necrolyzation as Beyond The Grave, and begins a quest of revenge against the crime syndicate. The series then backtracks to Brandon's youth, and follows him and Harry as they rise through the criminal underworld, detailing the circumstances that led to their eventual falling-out. Characters ;Brandon Heat / Beyond the Grave : :A small-time criminal who was in a gang with his best friend, Harry McDowell, along with three other close friends. After their friends were killed, Brandon and Harry joined the crime syndicate Millennion, led by Big Daddy. After joining Millennion, Brandon was assigned to a small collection crew in the West District, where they collected the organization's income from its illegal race track betting and black market operations. After being proven by a special assignment recommended by Harry, his affiliation with Maria, and risking his life for Big Daddy, Brandon began to move up within the ranks of the organization. Brandon was trained by Millennion's Bear Walken to be a sweeper (assassin), eventually forming his own elite sweeper unit within Millennion called \\"True Graves\\". :As Harry rose to power, Brandon remained loyal to the syndicate. Brandon confronted Harry for betraying the organization, but found himself unable to kill his friend. Instead, Harry kills Brandon during his moment of hesitation. Brandon was resurrected by Dr. Tokioka as \\"Beyond the Grave\\". His purpose is to destroy the syndicate that he once worked for and the friend who betrayed him. At the end of the anime, Brandon chose to protect Harry instead of killing him out of respect for their old friendship. It's unknown whether he lives or dies when Mika finally arrives. He acts like a parental figure to Mika, and told her to move on as he no longer belongs to the living. ;Harry McDowell : :Harry McDowell always wanted true freedom. Even when he was young, he could not stand being held back or put in his place. He used his ambition to rise in the ranks of Millennion with the help of his best friend, Brandon Heat. Impatient by nature, Harry began to plot the murder of Millennion's leader, Big Daddy, when he could not advance any further in the syndicate. :As Harry's dreams become reality, he grows insane. The slightest sign of hesitation is taken as betrayal, and betrayal is punished with death. Harry succeeded in killing Big Daddy as well as hundreds of others in his quest for freedom, earning him the name \\"Bloody Harry\\". One of his victims was Brandon Heat. Now, thirteen years later, Harry targets Big Daddy's daughter, Mika Asagi, as his next victim. However, Brandon has returned as Beyond the Grave to protect her against Harry's push to destroy the last piece of Big Daddy's legacy. ;Maria Asagi : :Maria is the sweet, clean-cut girl down the street, a contrast of Brandon's bad-boy image. Throughout the series, Maria makes her feelings for Brandon very clear. When she accepts Mr. Asagi's offer to live with him after her Uncle Jester dies, Maria is unaware that she is moving into the home of Big Daddy, head of Millenion. Brandon follows her and joins Millenion in hopes of being close to her, and for a while it works out. :It is when Brandon becomes a sweeper that their relationship crumbles. He finds it harder and harder to face Maria with every person he kills, and soon he stops visiting her altogether. Maria eventually figures out what is going on, and once she does, the strong-willed woman decides to confront the man she loves. However, vowing to follow Big Daddy, he refuses to give up his life as a hit man for the mob and calmly but coldly rejects Maria, who then marries Big Daddy. ;Mika Asagi : :The daughter of Big Daddy by Maria. After the incident at her home, her mother tells her to seek protection from Brandon. Throughout the series, she goes through many hardships as she sees those close to her pass away one by one. Her personality is similar to Maria's. :In order to stop Brandon from going out and wearing out his body in episode 24, she confesses that she cares for him and asks if he thinks of her as family, and she tells him they should just give up on revenge and runaway together. However, Brandon tells her to move on without him since he is no longer among the living, and knocks her out. In the final episode, Millenion is no longer trying to kill her, and she is seen searching desperately for Brandon. She eventually finds Brandon in the end. ;Dr. Tokioka : :A scientist who developed the necrolyzation process (a process in which dead bodies are brought back to life as nearly invincible zombie-like beings). When Mika came to him, he used the process to bring Grave back to life. ;Big Daddy : :Millennion's founder and leader. He started the organization to protect his city and his \\"Family\\". He developed a bond with Brandon early in the latter's career in Millenion, which resulted in Brandon giving up Maria to Big Daddy out of loyalty to the man and the organization. Big Daddy was killed by Harry; due to a mental breakdown when Big Daddy revealed that Brandon knew of his betrayal all along. Shaken and angered by the news, Harry vowed to erase every trace of him; including Mika. ;Bear Walken : :A sweeper for Millennion, and one of the oldest members of Big Daddy's inner circle. He stays with the organization after Harry becomes the leader of Millennion for the sake of his daughter (who is married to Harry). Although his vow to protect his daughter and Harry forced him to take sides, he still held some form of loyalty to Big Daddy - as he was the only member of Millenion that Big Daddy confided to about Maria's pregnancy with his child, and he most likely kept it from Harry. Due to his own way of thinking, Big Daddy was no longer a member, thus had no reason to talk of it. He is later killed by a resurrected Brandon, after inviting Brandon to his home for a duel to the death. His last thoughts were of his daughter. ;Bob Poundmax : :A formerly skinny man, Bob is now a portly, morbidly obese intelligence operative. He rose through the ranks of Millenion with Brandon and Harry. After Harry's ascension to the head of the organization, Bob sat as one of the Big Four under Harry. He became the second \\"Superior\\" created after the procedure was perfected and the first to confront Beyond the Grave. He was killed by Brandon after begging for mercy, only to attack Brandon when his back was turned. ;Balladbird Lee : :Bob Poundmax's best friend. He owes his life to Harry after it was discovered that he was working with Lightning (a rival group which his older brother Cannon Vulcan was a member of) while in Millennion. However, Harry forgave Balladbird, allowing him to stay in Millennion in exchange for his loyalty. After learning of Bob's death, Lee kidnaps Mika and kills her two friends in the process. Lee is eventually killed in the subway by Brandon's Anti-Superior bullets. ;Bunji Kugashira : :Bunji Kugashira earned the nickname \\"Madness\\" for his skills as a killer. He is an expert both with guns and unarmed. He also has a strange sense of morals. He deems it fine to kill others as a hitman, but he has a strong sense of loyalty to his friends and coworkers. :Bunji first meets Harry MacDowell on a job to kill him. Harry tells Bunji that he is being used, and both men confirm it. Although Harry wants to recruit Bunji for Millennion, it is actually Brandon that persuades him to join. Brandon beats Bunji in unarmed combat, and Bunji has considered Brandon a close companion ever since. Bunji calls a lot of people \\"brother,\\" but there is a sense that he truly means it when he calls Brandon that. It is this bond that makes facing Grave so difficult. Bunji is killed by Brandon in battle. ;Maggie : : ReferencesExternal links *JVC Music's Gungrave website  * 2003 anime television series 2004 Japanese television series endings Anime television series based on video games Television shows written by Y≈çsuke Kuroda Funimation Geneon USA Anime Madhouse (company) Organized crime in anime and manga Revenge in anime and manga Supernatural thriller anime and manga Works based on Sega video games ","title":"Gungrave (TV series)"},{"id":"6303406","text":"A model of a skeleton of a blue whale, the largest animal on earth.

Leeds Prison is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service, and is still known locally as Armley Gaol, the historical name for the prison. History Construction of Leeds Prison (originally named Leeds Borough Gaol) was completed in 1847. Built from locally quarried stone, the prison originally had four wings radiating from a central point in a Victorian architectural style (known as 'radial') typical of the time. Each of these four wings had three landings of cells. Eventually Armley Gaol was renamed along with other prisons to make their locations more obvious to people unfamiliar with these areas. The prison was a site of execution (by hanging) from 1847 until 1961. The final execution was that of Zsiga Pankotia, by Harry Allen for the murder of Jack Eli Myers in a house burglary in the city's affluent Roundhay district. The final execution in A block was that of 19-year-old Walter Sharpe in 1950. The 'Castle style' entrance range of the building and the 200 metres of perimeter wall received a Grade II* heritage listing in 1976. In 1990, the Howard League for Penal Reform announced that it would conduct its own independent inquiry into the deaths of five teenage prisoners at HMP Leeds. This followed a refusal by the Home Office to hold a public inquiry. A further two wings were added in 1994, and a new gate complex was opened in September 2002, providing much needed staff facilities and an improvement to the entry point for all visitors and staff. Most of the older parts of the prison have been extensively refurbished since 2003. 21st century In August 2003 a study by the Prison Reform Trust revealed that Leeds prison had the highest level of recorded drug use among prisoners in England and Wales. 28.3% of inmates held at Leeds Prison tested positive for controlled substances. In April 2004, Shahid Aziz was murdered by his racist cellmate at HMP Leeds,Life for murder of Asian cellmate The Guardian, 29 July 2004, Vikram Dodd sparking controversy over the similarities of the case with that of Zahid Mubarek. In July 2005 The Howard League for Penal Reform published statistics showing that Leeds Prison had the second highest suicide rate of all prisons in England and Wales. 25 inmates had committed suicide at the prison between 1995 and 2004. In 2006 the prison became the first to migrate onto the CNOMIS computer system. This was a large undertaking at great financial impact to the government. In June 2008 a report by Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons severely criticised conditions for inmates at Leeds Prison, and accused managers of making up figures relating to how long inmates spent in their cells. In reality some prisoners were out of their cells for just two and a half hours a day. The report also highlighted problems with hostile and unhelpful staff at the prison. In 2008, Times journalist Robert Crampton used his Beta Male column to ask for invitations to give speeches, to improve his public speaking skills. He received 400 invitations, but only accepted a handful, including Leeds Prison. He visited the prison to give the speech in 2009, subsequently reporting on the experience in The Times. In June 2010 a further report by Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons on their unannounced follow-up visit commented that ‚Äúit is pleasing to report that this unannounced follow-up visit charted further progress in all areas, as a result of close and effective management‚Äù and that ‚Äúthere had been a noticeable improvement in staff-prisoner relationships and considerable management attention to aspects of diversity, in particular race‚Äù. However, the report also claimed that illicit drug use at the prison was high, in-patient and day care facilities as part of the healthcare provision remained inadequate, and the prison lacked enough purposeful activity for inmates, with many prisoners spending too much time in their cells. In May 2013 a further inspection report found that conditions had generally improved at the prison, including lower drug use amongst prisoners and better healthcare facilities. The report also praised security at the prison and its resettlement wing. However the report highlighted that prisoners still lacked enough purposeful activity, and that vulnerable inmates needed better protection at the prison. The report also found that the quality and quantity of food given to inmates was poor. Two months later Leeds Prison was the first prison in the country to be awarded a Leaders in Diversity Award from the National Centre for Diversity. The award was given in recognition of the prisons efforts to be inclusive for LGBT staff and inmates, as well as various equality and diversity programmes at the prison for all staff and inmates.

HMP Leeds serves magistrates and crown courts in West Yorkshire, and parts of North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, Lancashire and Greater Manchester. In addition to serving the courts, the key focus of the prison is to ensure prisoners are discharged, having had their housing needs assessed and where possible settled accommodation and employment arranged. The establishment also focuses on support to prisoners with regards to health and lifestyle, including drug detoxification and prescribing programmes as well as the delivery of the Short Duration Drugs Programme. The prison can house up to 1212 prisoners in six residential units, a segregation unit, First Night Centre, Vulnerable Prisoner unit and in-patients Healthcare Facility.

A large sign marks the entrance to Printer's Alley on Church Street. Printer's Alley is a famous alley in downtown Nashville, Tennessee, between Third and Fourth Avenues, running from Union Street to Commerce Street. The portion of the alley between Union and Church Street is the home of a nightclub district that dates back to the 1940s.  History  At the beginning of the 20th century, Printer's Alley was home to a thriving publishing industry. The area was home to two large newspapers, ten print shops, and thirteen publishers. When Printer's Alley first became a nightclub and entertainment district, sale of liquor for on premise consumption was illegal in Nashville (and throughout Tennessee). Restaurants and clubs in the alley served liquor anyway, often claiming it had been \\"brown bagged\\" (brought in by customers). Law enforcement agencies normally looked the other way on such sales. Liquor sales in restaurants were finally legalized in 1968. One famous Printer's Alley club was Jimmy Hyde's Carousel Club, a jazz venue frequented by many Nashville musicians, among them a significant number of studio musicians who loved jazz despite spending their day backing country singers. These players would jam after the sessions were done and the music was often jazz. Among them were Chet Atkins, Floyd Cramer, Boots Randolph, Bob Moore, Brenton Banks, Buddy Harman and Hank Garland. Later, Randolph purchased the Carousel. In 1998, murder came to the Alley when longtime club proprietor David \\"Skull\\" Schulman was murdered by a robber shortly before his club was due to open.

The only known species of the genus is Kenichthys campbelli (named for the Australian palaeontologist Ken Campbell), the first remains of which were found in China in 1993.Chang, M. and Zhu, M. (1993) A new Middle Devonian osteolepidid from Qujing, Yunnan. Mem. Assoc. Australas. Palaeontol. 15 183-198 The genus is important to the study of the evolution of tetrapods due to the unique nature of its nostrils, which provide vital evidence regarding the evolutionary transition of fish-like nostrils to the vertebrate choanae.Zhu, M. and Ahlberg, P. (2004) The origin of the internal nostril of tetrapods. Nature 432 94-97 Description Kenichthys was a small tetrapodomorph, with a skull about 2 cm long. While only areas of the front of the body are known, it seems likely that Kenichthys would have been similar in general body form other basal sarcopterygians, with two dorsal fins, paired pectoral and pelvic fins and an anal fin. An important way in which Kenichthys differed from other tetropodomorphs however is in the positioning of its posterior nostril. Whilst in other tetrapodomorphs this nostril is positioned in the roof of the mouth (the palate), in Kenichthys it is found at the jaw margin, between the premaxilla and maxilla. Fossils The original fossil material of Kenichthys was first described in 1993, and consists of various parts of the skull roof, lower jaw and pectoral girdle. They were found in Southwestern China, in the Chuandong formation in Yunnan province, and are now housed in the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Beijing. The fossils date from the early Devonian, specifically from the Emsian period, about 395 million years ago. Further material from the skull was later found, and described in 2004. It was this material that established the presence of a transitional external nostril in the species‚Äô skull. Evolutionary significance Kenichthys is important to the study of the evolution of tetrapods due to the nature of its nostrils. Most non-tetrapod vertebrates (e.g. actinopterygians) possess two sets of nostrils, one set at either end of the nasal cavity, and both sets of which are external. These nostrils play no part in respiration, instead serving an olfactory role. However, in all crown group tetrapods and many stem tetrapods one set of nostrils is found exteriorly, and another interiorly, in the roof of the palate. This arrangement means that the nasal passage leads from the outside of the body into the mouth. The ‚Äòinner set‚Äô of nostrils are known as choanae, and allow tetrapods to breathe through their nose. Prior to the description of Kenichthys‚Äô nasal passages, exactly how the transition between these two forms had taken place was a source of debate. Various suggestions had been put forward including that the choana was homologous to either the posterior or anterior nostril of non-tetrapods, that it had ‚Äòbudded off‚Äô from one of these passages, or that it was an entirely novel form, unrelated to either of the other nostrils. The debate was further complicated by the fact that lungfishes, another group of sarcopterygian fish, also possess a choana with a different form to that of tetrapodomorphs.Panchen, A. L. The nostrils of choanate fishes and early tetrapods. (1967) Biol. Rev. 42 374‚Äì420 The character state of the nostrils of Kenichthys demonstrates that the vertebrate choana did in fact evolve by migration of the posterior external nostril around the jaw and up onto the roof of the mouth. Kenichthys suggests that this migration took place on the route between the premaxilla and the maxilla. This evolutionary transition appears to have left its mark on tetrapod development. A cleft palate may form in humans (and other tetrapods) where the tissues that will become the premaxilla and the maxilla fail to join during development. This condition is similar to the situation found in Kenichthys. Systematics Kenichthys has consistently been seen as the most basal tetrapodomorph since its discovery.

The district had more than 14,600 students in 2013-14 and a budget of approximately $147 million.OSPI webpage, district budget. Retrieved 2013-11-10. Organized in 1878, the district has two high schools, one alternative high school, 4 middle schools, and 11 elementary schools. It also administers an Everett-based technical high school serving surrounding school districts. It is the sixth oldest district in the state. This school district had a teachers' strike of 33 days in 1990, pushing the last day of school for the 1990-91 school year to July 2.http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19901003&slug;=1096341. This was resolved using collaborative bargaining. A 3-year contract was signed and school councils were established to continue the process of collaboration.  2018 Teacher Salary Controversy  In April 2018, in response to the State of Washington allocating $1 billion to school districts in order to comply with the Mccleary ruling, the Mukilteo Education Association sent a formal demand for bargain. The school district refused to bargain with the union, saying that it was a \\"closed contract.\\" In a statement issued by school board president John Gahagan, he said the board would be willing to \\"meet and confer.\\" However, in their May 29, 2018, board meeting, MEA president Dana Wiebe said this wasn't enough citing the school district backing out of previous discussions. In response to the school district's refusal to allocate funds, teachers from Mariner High School have been staging informational pickets on the street in front of Mariner during their lunch breaks and continue to do so for the remainder of the school year. They have also asked for the support of community members and students who packed the May 29, 2018 meeting and spoke to the board for nearly an hour. It has been leaked that the teachers of the school district are planning on going on strike and students will miss a month or two of school if they officially go on strike. Sadly for the students, if the strikeout does happen the time will be added to the school year.

He survived an assassination attempt during a mission to the Balkans in 1914. Early life He was born in London, the third son of Sir Thomas Buxton, 3rd Baronet. His elder brother Noel Buxton was a prominent figure in British politics, as was his cousin Sidney Buxton. He grew up on the family estate in Essex and was educated at Harrow and Trinity College, Cambridge, taking a first in Classics and becoming president of the Cambridge Union. After leaving university he travelled to South Australia, where his father was Governor, as well as other locations in France, the Far East, India and America. He took up law and was called to the bar in 1902. He gave lectures at Morley College and was principal there from 1902 to 1910. He wrote articles on various subjects and edited the Albany Review from 1906 to 1908. In 1904 he married Dorothy Frances Jebb. The Jebbs, apart from being a well- off family, also had a strong social conscience and commitment to public service; her mother, Eglantyne Louisa Jebb, had founded the Home Arts and Industries Association, to promote Arts and Crafts among young people in rural areas, her sister Louisa would help found the Women's Land Army in World War I, and Dorothy and her sister Eglantyne Jebb co-founded the international charity and movement Save the Children. The Buxtons lived a frugal lifestyle - on their walking tours in the south of England, they were sometimes mistaken for tramps - and moved to Kennington, a working class area of London. They had two children and later moved to the more affluent area of Golders Green. Political career He stood as a Liberal candidate in Hertford in 1906 and Ashburton in 1908. Eventually he was elected as a member of Parliament in Ashburton in 1910 but lost his seat in the second election of that year. In 1914 he, along with his brother Noel, was his way to Bulgaria. They had stopped in Bucharest, Romania in October 1914. While there, an assassination attempt was made on them, by Turkish activist, Hasan Tahsin. He was shot through the lung, but survived. His brother also was wounded in the jaw. Tashsin was captured and sent to prison for five years. Vitosha from the boulevard named after the brothers Noel & Charles Buxton in Sofia, Bulgaria () During the First World War, he was one of the minority arguing for a negotiated peace and was a founder member of the Union of Democratic Control. In 1917 he left the Liberal Party and joined the Independent Labour Party. As secretary to the Labour Party's delegation to the Soviet Union in 1920, he was very impressed by what he saw, and wrote a book about it, In A Russian Village (1922). In 1918 he contested Accrington for the Labour Party and lost, won the seat in 1922, and lost again in 1923. He won the seat of Elland in 1929, but was defeated in 1931 and 1935. Buxton was always much more effective behind the scenes, acting as policy advisor on foreign and colonial issues to the Labour Party. He showed particular interest in the rights of indigenous people of Africa, and travelled widely in the continent. Another of his interests was Esperanto, becoming president of the international society of Quaker Esperantists.Enciklopedio de Esperanto, 1933. With Dorothy, he became a member of the Society of Friends. They were eager campaigners for peace, and were critical of what they perceived as the unfairness to Germany of the treaty of Versailles. Shortly before the outbreak of World War II they still argued that peace could be attained by responding to German grievances. The outbreak of war was a great disappointment to them both. Charles retired from politics in 1939 and lived in his daughter's house in Peaslake, Surrey, where he died and was buried in 1942. Although he had two children, he left most of his estate to charity.  Notes References V. A. B.

It was Diamond's first twin engine design, as well as the first new European twin-engine aircraft in its category to be developed in over 25 years.Collins, Peter. \\"FLIGHT TEST: Diamond Aircraft DA42 ‚Äì Sparkling performer.\\" Flight International, 13 July 2004. In 2004, the DA42 became the first diesel-powered fixed-wing aircraft to perform a non-stop crossing of the North Atlantic. By 2012, the DA42 had become a key revenue generator for the company, having gained popularity with government and military operators in addition to the civil market that had suffered as a result of the Great Recession. Government customers have typically employed the type in the aerial surveillance role, which contributed towards the development of the Aeronautics Defense Dominator, a medium-altitude long-endurance (MALE) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which had been derived from the DA42. Development=Origins Since its founding in the 1980s, Austrian manufacturer Diamond Aircraft Industries had concentrated on building an extensive product line. During the late 1990s, company founder and chief executive officer Christian Dries approached the design team with a concept for a twin-engined aircraft, which became the company's first multi-engined aircraft, and became the next step beyond the Diamond DA40. Pope, Stephen. \\"We Fly: Diamond DA62.\\" Flying Magazine, 2 December 2015. This concept emphasised several key qualities, including the need for the aircraft to be simple to operate and fuel-efficient, while providing a luxurious four-seat passenger compartment akin to modern automobiles. The concept was not popular at the time; Aerospace publication Flying Magazine referred to Diamond's choice to develop a twin-engined aircraft for general aviation use as \\"the emergence of an all-new light-piston twin in this class something of a surprise.\\" The DA42 Twin Star During April 2004, the DA42 Twin Star received certification from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) under the latter's newly-introduced Part procedures. In July 2005, the aircraft was awarded certification from the Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) in the US. It has been certified to fly under both visual flight rules (VFR) and instrument flight rules (IFR), allowing it to be operated under a wide range of conditions. Circa introduction to service, aerospace publication Flight International observed that \\"The DA42 has no natural competitors in its class and sets a benchmark for European general aviation\\". During 2004, the DA42 Twin Star became the first diesel- powered fixed-wing aircraft to perform a non-stop crossing of the North Atlantic, taking 12.5 hours while operating with an average fuel consumption of per hour ( per hour per engine). In June 2010, a DA42 powered by Austro AE300 engines became the first aircraft to be publicly flown on algae-derived jet fuel. Further development As a consequence of the insolvency of engine manufacturer Thielert and decisions of the insolvency administrator, including cancelling warranty support and the prorating of time-between- overhaul for the Thielert engines that power the DA42, in July 2008, Diamond announced that production of the DA42 has been suspended. At the time production was suspended the DA42 was reported to hold around 80% of the piston twin market. In March 2009, Diamond achieved EASA certification for the Austro Engine AE 300, which enabled the DA42 to resume production. Equipped with the Austro engine, these aircraft were designated and marketed as the DA42 NG. In April 2009, the first Austro-powered DA42 NG was delivered to a customer in Sweden. On 9 April 2010, the DA42 NG received FAA certification, clearing the way for sales to resume to North American customers. By March 2012, the DA42 had become the major income driver at Diamond Aircraft. Company CEO Christian Dries indicated that the market focus of the company had been changed by the Great Recession of 2008‚Äì2010 which had led the company to transition to derive two-thirds of its revenue from military and government contracts, primarily for manned and unmanned surveillance aircraft, the latter in the form of the Aeronautics Defense Dominator. Also in March 2012, Diamond aircraft announced they were developing a fly-by-wire version of the DA42, which had the stated aim of reducing the accident rate in light aircraft. The system is expected to include flight envelope protection, turbulence righting, autoland capabilities, and damage-tolerant by-pass capabilities, the latter of which would allow for effective flight while suffering from jammed or otherwise non-functional flight surfaces. The autonomous DA42 was flown and landed without ground support in 2015. In July 2018, the Rossiyskaya Gazeta announced a UAV version, DA-42B, armed with the 9M120 Ataka antitank missile. Design=Overview Instrument panel of a DA42 Twin Star, note the installed Garmin G1000 glass cockpit present winglets The Diamond DA42 Twin Star is a twin-engined low-wing cantilever monoplane, commonly used as a general aviation aircraft for touring and training purposes. It is equipped with a retractable tricycle landing gear arrangement and uses a T-tail. The DA42 incorporates a combination of advanced features within the company's first twin-engine design. The airframe is composed of composite materials, making extensive use of carbon fiber reinforced polymers throughout its structure; this construction provides the aircraft with a suitable passive safety level to conform with the established European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Part 21 rules, as well as relatively efficient aerodynamics and essentially unlimited airframe life. The carbon-fiber main wing spars possesses exceptional crashworthiness. The DA42 typically accommodates four people in two rows of seating. All of the seats have been designed for crashworthiness and are complete with automotive-style three-point seat belts; while the seats themselves are fixed in position, the position of the rudder- pedals is adjustable. The front pair of seats are accessed via a front-hinged canopy while a top-hinged door located on the left side provides access to the rear seats. The pilots are housed under a sizable canopy which provides generous external visibility, save for the use of a large fixed sunscreen. Additionally, separate baggage compartments, which are accessible via external hatches, are contained within internal space in the aircraft's nose. Both the avionics and principal flight controls of the DA42 have been designed to be user-friendly and to reduce pilot workload. A Garmin G1000 glass cockpit serves as the centrepiece of the aircraft's integrated digital avionics, using a pair of large flat-panel monitors in place of conventional instrumentation and gauges; immediately above these monitors is a horizontal row of standby instruments present as a fail-safe. The monitors display various information on the aircraft, along with navigational data and flight information; both screens can show identical basic information or be configured to flight data on the left monitor and navigation on the right. According to Flight International, the displays are easy to read while features such as the moving map display were considered to be \\"useful\\". The DA42 is also outfitted with a sophisticated three-axis Garmin-built GFC 700 autopilot and GWX 70 weather radar. Performance The flight performance of the DA42 is largely favourable, having been designed to incorporate not only high levels of performance but the greatest possible degrees of passive safety in operation, alongside excellent fuel economy and assisted by the implementation of various modern technologies. The flight controls themselves are proportionally responsive for performing even small manoeuvers and light motions. Both pilots are equipped with their own fighter-style central sticks, which are attached to an otherwise unobstructed cockpit floor. In a similar manner, a single combined power lever is used to regulate both the engine and propeller settings; the power levers are convenient and can be operated in a relatively easy manner. In comparison with other twin-engined aircraft in its category, the centre console of the DA42 is uncluttered, which is a result of the clean design of the controls. Underside of a DA42 passing overhead The stall characteristics are also relatively benign, being described by Flight International as \\"probably the most docile of any aircraft I can remember\\". On the DA42, stall conditions are forewarned by the sounding of a warning horn at 5-7kt above stall, as well as by elevating levels of airframe buffeting and a 5‚Äì10¬∞ drop of the nose. The aircraft is relatively difficult to stall outside of substantial mishandling or deliberate intention. Both longitudinal and lateral stability can be maintained with a relatively low level of effort, not necessitating continuous trimming while the aircraft is accelerating. Active use of the rudder is necessary for effective turns and counteracting sideslip tendencies. While the DA42 is a twin-engined aircraft, this is predominantly a measure for safety. It is readily capable of sustained flight using only a single engine, and can still achieve a satisfactory rate of climb of 700 feet per minute under single-engine operations, unlike many of its contemporaries. The DA42 possesses considerable endurance, being capable of performing 13 hour-long flights without carrying additional fuel tanks; this is partially due to its high fuel efficiency of its Austro engines, which consume 13.6 US gallons per hour when operated at 75 per cent power, lower than some of its single-engined rivals. The digital FADEC (full authority digital engine controls) serves to lower operational difficulty, constantly performing tasks such as managing rpm and fault-checking. Powerplants Diamond DA42 Twin Star Thielert Centurion 1.7 diesel engine The original model of the DA42 was powered by a pair of Thielert Aircraft Engines-built TAE 125-01 Centurion 1.7 engines. However, Thielert ended its production of the 1.7 litre Centurion engines in favour of a new 2.0 litre engine, marketed as the TAE 125-02-99; as a result of the engine production change, Diamond began installing the TAE 125-02-99 engine during early 2007. Although engine displacement had increased, it was deliberately de-rated in order to produce the same power and torque as the earlier 1.7 L. engine. In late 2007, Diamond announced it would begin building and installing its own aerodiesels, through a subsidiary, Austro Engine GmbH, in collaboration with other partners that included Mercedes Benz. The continued use of Thielert engines on the DA42 was also brought into question following Thielert filing for insolvency in April 2008. In March 2009, Diamond achieved EASA certification for the rival Austro Engine AE 300 powerplant. The DA42NG \\"New Generation\\" is powered by Diamond's third generation Austro AE 300 turbo diesel engine. The Lycoming IO-360 engine is also available as an option. The AE 300 engine replaces the earlier Thielert Centurion 1.7 and 2.0 engines and is known for its good fuel efficiency, using per hour while loitering at maximum endurance or per hour at maximum continuous power (92%). It is also available with optional \\"on top\\" exhaust mufflers that reduces noise levels to below 59 decibels at a height of . The Austro engine produces 20% more power than the previous Thielert engines and also results in a higher gross weight and increased performance. Diamond has claimed that the Austro engine is about 46% more fuel efficient than its gasoline rivals. It runs on diesel fuel or jet fuel, both of which are typically cheaper than aviation gasoline. Operational history A DA42 configured to perform aerial survey missions Upon its introduction, Diamond had to combat a historic trend of declining light-piston twin sales in the face of increasingly reliable and capable single-engined aircraft for general aviation; the DA42 had only five competing aircraft in its category. DA42 MPP The DA42, particularly its use in the surveillance sector, become Diamond's most important business. A dedicated surveillance model of the aircraft, designated as the DA 42 MPP, was developed; during 2008, Diamond delivered 17 DA 42 MPPs and anticipated a demand for between 50 and 60 such aircraft per year. During the latter part of 2008 and early 2009, a pair of Royal Air Force DA42 MPPs were deployed for eight months to provide combat support to coalition forces operating in Iraq; during the deployment, these aircraft flew a combined 2,000h in the surveillance role, for which it had been outfitted with Cineflex high-definition cameras, Riegl laser scanners and Scotty satellite communications kit.Morrison, Murdo. \\"Diamond: DA42s shone during RAF's Iraq mission.\\" Flight International, 15 July 2009.

The downtown portion of the roadway was originally known as Lafayette Street, and as Grand Central Avenue west of the downtown area in the City of Tampa during the 19th century and early-to- mid-20th century. West of the city limits at Howard Avenue, it was known as Memorial Highway. At the time, it was mainly a two-lane thoroughfare. It carries the State Road 60 designation through its entire route. Some places of interest that can be accessed from this route include WestShore Plaza, International Plaza and Bay Street, Tampa International Airport via the Veterans Expressway, the University of Tampa, Downtown Tampa, and the Port of Tampa. Kennedy Boulevard represents the northern boundary of South Tampa. The route runs from today's Memorial Highway to Channelside Drive. History Prior to the construction of the Interstate Highway system in Tampa, which began in the early 1960s, Grand Central Avenue was the main artery for heavy westbound traffic emptying from downtown Tampa and points eastward during rush hour. When Interstate 4 opened in the mid-1960s offering travelers express movement in both directions, Kennedy Boulevard traffic shrunk to less than 50 percent of its previous activity, and its many businesses that depended on the high traffic count closed or relocated. Today, with Tampa's exploding population and attendant commercial and residential development, Kennedy Boulevard is once again a significant part of the city's travel network. The road was renamed for President John F. Kennedy in 1964 by the unanimous vote of Tampa City Council after his visit to Tampa on November 18, 1963 and his assassination in Dallas on November 22. His motorcade made use of the roadway during his Tampa visit. It was chosen for such a renaming because Kennedy had used about five miles (8 km) of Grand Central Avenue for his motorcade leading through the center of the business district. According to Kennedy Library records, Kennedy's public exposure in Tampa was only the second-longest during his entire presidency, after that of his visit earlier that year to Berlin, Germany. Since then, the roadway has seen many changes, such as expansions to 4-6 lanes. Today, Kennedy Boulevard is a vital link to and from Downtown Tampa and serves as an alternate to I-275 during rush hour. Statue of JFK at Plant Park on the University of Tampa campus at Hyde Park Street, along the boulevard WTVT - Fox 13's Studio is located on Kennedy Blvd. near MacDill Avenue and Henderson Boulevard. On that cool November day in 1963, a live television camera perched atop the station's front portico captured Kennedy's motorcade as it whizzed eastward on then Grand Central Avenue on its way through downtown Tampa and on to Tampa's Ft. Homer Hesterly Armory. At the time, live remotes from multiple locations were a rarity for local stations and so thar part of the motorcade was all of his visit that many Tampa Bay area residents could witness by television. About the same time as the renaming, a group of Tampa community activists headed by then local Democratic Party Chairman Robert Florio pooled resources to commission a life-sized statue of the slain President by a prominent Italian artist. The piece was shipped to the United States in mid-1964 and erected at a site at Plant Park on the University of Tampa campus at Hyde Park Avenue, where the statue faces Kennedy Boulevard.

Albert Goldman (1897‚Äì1960) was a Belorussian-born American political and civil rights lawyer, closely associated with the American communist movement. Goldman broke with the mainline Communist Party, USA in 1933, joining the Trotskyist opposition, in which he would be a leading participant for the better part of the next two decades. Goldman is best remembered as a defendant and lead defense attorney in the 1941 Smith Act prosecution of the leadership of the Socialist Workers Party. Biography=Early years Albert Goldman was born of ethnic Jewish parents in 1897 in the Minsk oblast of today's Belarus, then part of the Russian empire.Albert Glotzer, \\"Albert Goldman,\\" in Bernard K. Johnpoll and Harvey Klehr (eds.), Biographical Dictionary of the American Left. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1986; pp. 159-160. The family emigrated to the United States in 1904, when Albert was 7, settling in the Midwestern metropolis of Chicago. Goldman attended elementary and secondary school in Chicago before leaving for Cincinnati to study to become a rabbi at Hebrew Union College. Goldman left before completing his rabbinical studies and transferred to the University of Cincinnati, where he not only studied but was a star athlete, captaining the collegiate basketball team and running track. Following his graduation from college in 1919, Goldman worked as a tailor. He came into contact with the radical movement in this occupation, first joining the Industrial Workers of the World and shortly thereafter the newly formed Communist Party of America. Goldman made use of the pseudonym \\"Albert Verblin,\\" under which name he wrote a polemic pamphlet answering a 1921 book by Socialist Party leader Morris Hillquit entitled From Marx to Lenin. Goldman went on to study at the Northwestern University Law School, from which he graduated in 1925. Communist Party years Following his admission to the Illinois State Bar, Goldman opened a legal practice in Chicago and began several years of close association with International Labor Defense (ILD), the legal defense organization of the Communist Party. On behalf of the IlD, Goldman participated in a series of cases defending political radicals and trade union activists who had run afoul of the law. In 1931 Goldman made a trip to the Soviet Union, an experience which he found disillusioning.\\"Albert Goldman Papers, 1940-1959: Biography/History,\\" Wisconsin Historical Society, Madison, WI. Retrieved Dec. 14, 2013. Goldman's intellectual unease grew and he became connected with the Trotskyist opposition movement, leading to Goldman's expulsion from the Communist Party, USA in 1933. Opposition years Mexico 1937; left to right: Jean van Heijenoort, Albert Goldman, Leon Trotsky, Natalia Sedova, Jan Frankel After his expulsion from the CPUSA, Goldman joined the Communist League of America (CLA), the small Trotskyist opposition party headed by James P. Cannon and Max Shachtman. He worked as an attorney on behalf of the Trotskyist movement, representing the CLA-led Minneapolis Teamsters strikers in 1934. Goldman was an early advocate of dissolution of the party and entrance into the Socialist Party of America (SPA) in an effort to unite the anti-Stalinist left and to radicalize that organization. He was unable to win support for this position, however, so he severed his connection with the Trotskyists to himself join the SPA. In 1935 he established a mimeographed periodical called The Socialist Appeal as part of his effort to radicalize the Socialist Party. It was not long before Goldman's idea of entry into the social democratic movement in an effort to unite and radicalize it had won currency in the international Trotskyist movement in accordance with the so-called \\"French Turn\\". The Trotskyists and their organizational allies associated with A. J. Muste, who had worked together in a new organization called the American Workers Party, dissolved their organization and entered the Socialist Party en masse. Goldman became the attorney of Leon Trotsky, cloistered in exile in Mexico City, and defended him there in April 1937 against the charges leveled against him by the regime of Joseph Stalin in hearings conducted before a high-profile commission headed by liberal educator John Dewey. Goldman also served as an intermediary for Trotsky in the transfer of his personal and political archive to the library at Harvard University. Goldman's Socialist Appeal became the semi-official organ of the organized Trotskyist faction inside the SPA up until their expulsion late in 1937 and their establishment of a new organization called the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) in 1938. Smith Act trial In 1941, Goldman was a defendant as well as chief defense counsel in the Minneapolis trial of top Socialist Workers Party leaders accused of violating the Smith Act‚Äîa prosecution pushed owing to the SWP's continuing opposition to American participation in World War II. The defendants in this case were convicted and served prison terms ranging from 12 to 16 months. While in prison, Goldman worked with Felix Morrow to develop criticisms of the SWP and Fourth International leaderships. They claimed that predictions of a revolutionary wave after World War II had been proved incorrect, and that Stalinism, far from being destroyed (as Trotsky had predicted) had been strengthened. They also became critical of the party's organizational structures. The pair were only able to convince a small minority of the party of their positions, although this included key figures including Jean Van Heijenoort and James T. Farrell. Following his release from prison in 1943, Goldman found himself disbarred from legal practice. He was forced to establish a car-rental business as a means of paying the bills while he worked for readmission to the Illinois bar. He would not be successfully reinstated to the bar until 1956, only a few years before his death. Post-war years Following his release from prison, Goldman returned to his role among the leaders of the Socialist Workers Party. He gradually grew disenchanted, however, until in 1946 he and a small group of followers bolted the Cannon-led SWP to join the rival Workers Party, headed by Max Shachtman from 1940. Goldman ran for political office in 1947, entering the race to become Mayor of Chicago with the support of the Workers Party. Within the Workers Party, Goldman worked closely with James T. Farrell. In 1948, the pair developed criticisms of its policies, claiming that the party should support the Marshall Plan and also the presidential campaign of Socialist Norman Thomas. The divergence of these views from the party majority proved to be the impetus for an exit from the Workers Party in 1949. Goldman became a nominal member of the Socialist Party following his exit from the Workers Party, but in practice the period of his active participation in radical politics came to a close following his quitting of Shachtman's organization. Death and legacy Albert Goldman developed health problems towards the end of the 1950s, leading to his death from cancer in 1960.

E7. which was the former residence of Henry and Matilda Laumeier. Laumeier is accredited by the American Alliance of Museums. The park sees about 300,000 visitors each year and operates on a $1.5 million budget. History The park was founded in 1968 by a property grant in the will of Matilda C. Laumeier, and was originally intended as a memorial to her deceased husband, Henry H. Laumeier. The will gave their land and country house to the county, and specified that would be used for passive purposes (e.g., no sport fields). The park was at its opening in 1975, but did not attract many visitors until a year later, when St. Louis sculptor Ernest Trova donated about 40 pieces of his work to the park. It soon became a popular tourist attraction, and received an additional from the Friends of Laumeier. The additional land was mostly woods and is for site-specific sculptures, including an abandoned Depression-era concrete pool from the Orchard Valley estate that once occupied the land which was transformed into a large sculpture.http://racstl.org/public-art/pool- complex-orchard-valley/ The founding executive director of the Sculpture Park was Dr. Beej Nierengarten-Smith, whose tenure lasted 22 years from October 1979 to May 2001. During these early years the park won 6 operating grants and 2 conservation grants from the Institute of Museum and Library Services, including a grant to create an informative video on the park and an architectural assessment of its buildings. The park also received 22 grants from the National Endowment for the Arts for exhibitions and sculpture commissions. An endowment fund was created, valued at $2 million by 2000, and the park's operating fund increased from an initial $30,000 from St Louis County to over one million from combined resources. A variety of national and international sculptors were featured, including Terry Allen, Manuel Neri, Andy Goldsworthy, Judith Shea, and Joyce J. Scott. Fifty percent of featured artists were women. Nierengarten-Smith also created the Contemporary Arts and Crafts Fair for education revenue, the Winter Solstice Program Fire and Ice, the Sand Castle Festival, Safari Camp in the woods for children and parents, and numerous other festivals for diverse audiences, including children. A volunteer program for the park and its special events was also created. During the first 22 years, attendance rose from several hundred to 500,000 people, and the park twice received museum accreditation from the American Association of Museums.McCue, George (ed). ‚ÄúLaumeier Sculpture Park first decade, 1976-1986‚Äù.

In September 2009 when Gentele accepted a position at another museum, Marilu Knode came from Arizona State University, where she was head of research for Future Arts Research, to become the current executive director. Knode was the former head of research at Future Arts Research at Arizona State University. Future The park has raised significant funds for improvements and a new fine arts center. Lawrence Scarpa of the firm Brooks + Scarpa Architects, which won the 2010 AIA Architecture Firm Award, initially designed the Adam Aronson Fine Arts Center (named to honor an institutional founder member, long-term board member and major donor). Plans for this building were tabled and a less ambitious facility was constructed in 2015‚Äîdesigned by a regional architecture firm. \\"The Way\\" Alexander Liberman's \\"The Way\\" (1980) is often cited as the park's signature sculpture. One of the park's best-known works, \\"The Way\\", was completed by Alexander Liberman in 1980. Constructed from eighteen salvaged steel oil tanks, the sculpture is tall, wide, and deep, and weighs . It is painted cadmium red. The park website describes the sculpture as a modernist work, \\"meant to represent the awe-inspiring impact of classical Greek temples and mammoth Gothic-style cathedrals\\" and modeled on post and lintel architecture. \\"The Way\\" was composed on-site in a clearing later named \\"Way Field\\". The work was funded by the National Endowment for the Arts and a donation by Alvin J. Siteman. In September 2011, it was restored by two workers using a hydraulic lift and of paint.

Today it is used as a public school. Bayersburg II Castle, an old Teutonic castle, stood here until the 16th century. The original castle is the setting of an East Prussian legend known as \\"The White Maiden of the Bayersburg\\". Raudonƒó was a royal manor, which Grand Duke Sigismund II August gave to Prussian merchant Krispin Kirschenstein. He built a Renaissance style manor house with a cylindrical tower on the grounds of the old castle at the end of the 16th century. The 18th century owners of the Raudonƒó estate, the Olƒôdzki (Olendzki) h. Rawicz family, members of Polish nobility, commissioned Laurynas Stuoka- Guceviƒçius \\\\ Wawrzyniec Gucewicz to renovate the castle. The next owner, the Russian Prince Platon Zubov, acquired the estate in the first half of the 19th century and his family transformed the castle yet again. Their architect was Cesare Anichini. The Neo-Gothic style building was built in 1877 as part of the castle building complex. It was used as a warehouse and a living place for servants. In 1923, the building was turned into mill. Today the whole complex is an example of 19th-century Neo-Gothic architecture. The last owners of the castle from 1898 to 1937, was Sophia Waxell, a granddaughter of Sophia von Pirch-Kaiserov who was niece of Platon Zubov, and her husband from Madeira, Jos√© Carlos de Faria e Castro. After early death of Sophia, the castle belonged to her husband, later on to her only son, Joseph Carlo de Faria e Castro and his wife Olga Kordashevski and their children Nikolai, Vladimir and Alexander. In 1937 the castle became property of the National Bank of Lithuania. The castle is surrounded by an old park, in which rare trees grow: the silver fir, Swiss pine, grey walnut, line with nine trunks, Gediminas Oak. The Gediminas Oak, under which according to a legend the Grand Duke of Lithuania Gediminas had a lunch, is no longer putting out leaves. The tower is open to public as an observation tower of Nemunas valley.

The following games were produced in the Microsoft Golf series: * Microsoft Golf (1992) Windows 3.1 * Microsoft Golf: Multimedia Edition (1993) Windows 3.1 * Microsoft Golf 2.0 (1994) Windows 3.1/95 * Microsoft Golf 3.0 (1996) Windows 95 * Microsoft Golf 1998 Edition (1998) Windows 95 * Microsoft Golf 1999 Edition (1998) Windows 95 * Microsoft Golf 2001 Edition (2000) Windows 98 Reception Computer Gaming World in 1996 ranked the 1990 version of Links fifth on the magazine's list of the most innovative computer games, stating that the game \\"may have inspired more 'business machine upgrades' than any other game\\". In 1996 Next Generation ranked it 69th on their \\"Top 100 Games of All Time\\", contending that \\"many prefer EA's PGA series, but Links takes the title by a hair's breadth. With real life courses, and enough stats, sliders, and options to choke a horse, Links re-creates everything but the swing (which is still accomplished with a 'three click' power bar).\\" During 1999, Links LS 2000 sold 104,225 copies and earned $4.6 million in the United States. Links 2001 rose to 240,000 copies and $8.2 million in the United States by August 2006, which made it the 84th-best- selling computer game released between January 2000 and August 2006 in the region. Combined sales of all Links games released in the 2000s reached 720,000 copies in the United States by August 2006. In the United States, Links Championship Edition sold over 100,000 copies by August 2006. Links 2003 was a nominee for PC Gamer USs \\"2002 Best Sports Game\\" award, which ultimately went to Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2003. The magazine's Dan Morris called Links 2003 \\"a terrific game\\".

Among the league's first basemen, he ranked second in assists for six consecutive years from 1904 to 1909, led in range factor in 1904 (11.46) and 1905 (11.90), and also led with 79 double plays in 1908. His career range factor of 11.20 ranks third all-time in major league history. Early years Jones was born in Honesdale, Pennsylvania, in 1874. Professional baseball Jones made his major league debut on August 25, 1902, with the Baltimore Orioles. He appeared in 37 games for the Orioles and compiled a .283 batting average. After the 1902 season, the Orioles moved to New York and became the Yankees. Jones remained in Baltimore with the newly formed Baltimore Orioles minor league club of 1903. Jones appeared in 127 games at first and second base and compiled a .335 batting average with 103 RBIs and 17 stolen bases. In September 1903, Jones was drafted by the St. Louis Browns.

The name Picc-Vic was a contraction of the two station names, Manchester Piccadilly and Manchester Victoria. The proposal envisaged the construction of an underground rail tunnel across Manchester city centre. The scheme was abandoned in 1977 during its proposal stages due to excessive costs, and that the scheme still retained two large and expensive-to-maintain terminal stations in Manchester; other similar sized cities had reduced their terminals to one. In 1992, the Metrolink system opened and linked both stations via tram, negating the requirement for a direct rail connection to an extent. In 2017, the Ordsall Chord became operational; an overground railway scheme directly linking Manchester Piccadilly and Manchester Victoria in a comparable fashion to Picc- Vic. History=Background A 1910 map of Manchester's railways The railway network built in the 19th and 20th centuries by numerous railway companies resulted in various unconnected railway termini around the periphery of Manchester city centre. Unlike central London, which had linked its stations with the London Underground, Manchester had a large area of its central business district which was not served by rail transport. Proposal The South-East Lancashire and North-East Cheshire Passenger Transport Executive (SELNEC PTE) - the local transport authority which became the Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive (GMPTE) in 1974 (now Transport for Greater Manchester - TfGM) - made a proposal in 1971 to connect the unjoined railways running through Manchester city centre under the Picc- Vic scheme. The Picc-Vic proposal envisaged joining the two halves of the rail network by constructing new tunnels under the city centre, connecting Manchester's two main railway stations, Piccadilly and Victoria. This new underground railway would be served by three new underground stations, joining together the regional, national and local rail networks with an underground rapid transit system for Manchester. publicity brochure The objectives of the Picc-Vic tunnel were threefold: # To improve the distribution arrangements from the existing railway stations which are on the periphery of the central core # To link the separated northern and southern railway systems # To improve passenger movement within the central area. It formed part of a four- phase, Long Term Strategy for GMPTE over 25 years, which included bus priority and an East-West railway network, as well as a light rapid transport system. Cancellation SELNEC made an infrastructure grant application to central government to fund the construction of the Picc-Vic line. In the early 1970s, Britain was facing economic difficulties and the Chancellor of the Exchequer Anthony Barber announced a ¬£500 million reduction in public expenditure. In August 1973, the Minister for Transport Industries John Peyton rejected the grant application, stating that \\"there is no room for a project as costly as Picc-Vic before 1975 at the earliest\\". An underground excavation and construction project required a large initial outlay of public funds, and when the Greater Manchester County Council took on the project, it was unable to secure the necessary funding from central government. The Picc-Vic scheme was abandoned in 1977 owing to excessive cost. Specification=Route Geographic map of the proposed Picc-Vic route A prototype SELNEC interactive display board, now on display at the Museum of Transport, Greater Manchester The proposed new link would have been long, and run from Ardwick Junction, a mile south of Piccadilly Station, to Queens Road Junction on the Bury line, about three-quarters of a mile north of Victoria. Just over of the new line would have been in tunnel, most of which would be beneath the centre of Manchester. The southern approach ramp would have been built on the surface and in a shallow tunnel. There would have been two separate tracks, each electrified on the 25 kV AC system. In the deep tunnel section separate bores were to be tunnelled for each track. The track was to consist of continuous welded rails on concrete foundations - 'slab track'. The tunnel was to be controlled by British Rail's standard three-aspect colour light signals together with their automatic warning system (AWS). This would have permitted train frequencies of 90 seconds, although initial proposals envisaged a 2.5 minute headway. Once opened, the underground line would have enabled through- running for trains across the city region by linking up several existing railway lines, including the Bury Line, Crewe‚ÄìManchester line, Hope Valley line, Stafford‚ÄìManchester line, and Styal line. The planned course of the Picc-Vic tunnel would not follow a direct route across the city centre but instead would skirt around the south of the city centre before curving north towards Victoria. An obstacle to the construction of the line was the subterranean Guardian telephone exchange, a subterranean structure that extended beneath the city centre south of Piccadilly Gardens. The exchange had been designated as a nuclear bunker, and while SELNEC planners were aware of this structure, they were unable to mention it publicly as they were forced to sign the Official Secrets Act in 1971. Stations Five new central area stations were planned on the Picc-Vic line, including two low-level platforms at Piccadilly and Victoria stations. Each would have been built on a tangent track and would have allowed trains of up to eight cars. There would have been escalators to the surface level, and lifts for disabled people. Customer information system and PA systems would be installed, along with CCTV to make high staffing levels unnecessary. Victoria Low Level would have a concourse below Long Millgate, serving the Co-Operative HQ and the Corn Exchange. Development of the Picc-Vic would also allow the main line station to be rationalised and redeveloped, along with a proposed new bus station. Market Street (or Royal Exchange) would have lain beneath the junction of Corporation Street, Cross Street, and Market Street, directly linking into the Royal Exchange, Marks & Spencer, as well as the Arndale Centre. Albert Square/St. Peter's Square (or Central), serving the administrative and entertainment parts of the city, would have six entrances in St Peter's Square, together with a bus lay-by, part of a re-designed square. Albert Square would also be redesigned, with a concourse beneath the square, along with a direct link into the Heron House development and a travelator link to Oxford Road railway station. Princess Street (or Whitworth) would have been built on the site of the present Whitworth House, with a direct link to the proposed major development north and east of the station, as well as serving the Manchester College site (formerly City College Manchester), UMIST, as well as other developments. Piccadilly Low Level would be a side-platform station, built in a 'cut-and-cover' section, with a mezzanine level concourse. Escalators would take passengers to both the Picc-Vic and East-West platforms, along with a subway-escalator link to the mainline station concourse, and a direct link to a new 12-stand bus station, next to the new station. Victory House, a planned development by UMIST (now the University of Manchester), would also be served by the station. Rolling stock The initial publicity for the Picc-Vic plan, which was described as \\"Manchester's tube project\\", showed an artist's impression of a platform with a train resembling the 1967 Stock, as used on the Victoria line in London. However, new trains were planned for the Picc-Vic line, designated as Class 316. This proposed type of rolling stock would have been derived from the \\"PEP\\" prototypes on the Southern Region, and would have formed part of the same family of EMUs as , , , and . The planned twin bore tunnels were intended to be built with a diameter of , large enough to accommodate both a main line train type, and the OHLE wires. Legacy Projects at Bury Interchange, Altrincham Interchange, and Hazel Grove Branch electrification/improvement were completed, despite the overall scheme being abandoned. Metrolink, a light-rail system in Greater Manchester, was proposed in 1982 as a means to connect Manchester Piccadilly to Manchester Victoria; it opened in 1992. In 2008, over 30 years after the project was cancelled, prospects of an underground rail link under Manchester were revived by Transport Secretary and MP for Bolton West, Ruth Kelly, who announced a Department for Transport study of rail provision. In the 2011 United Kingdom budget, it was announced that the Ordsall Chord would instead be constructed as an overground railway scheme designed to link Manchester Piccadilly and Manchester Victoria in a comparable fashion to Picc-Vic. The chord opened to passengers in December 2017. In 2012 researchers from the Manchester School of Architecture at the University of Manchester conducted an investigation under the Arndale Centre in the city centre and discovered a long-forgotten subterranean void around below the surface. The void area had apparently been included in the construction of the shopping centre in the 1970s to enable a link to be built to a new Royal Exchange underground railway station when the planned Picc-Vic tunnel came into service. In 2019, in the publication Our Prospectus for Rail by regional mayor Andy Burnham, an underground tunnel through Manchester city centre was once again proposed.

While typically bright yellow, it is possible for them to change to green, red, or orange as they ripen. It is often pickled, stuffed or used as a raw ingredient in foods. It is a cultivar of the species Capsicum annuum. Its flavor is not very hot (0‚Äì500 Scoville units) and, as is the case with most peppers, its heat depends on the maturity of the pepper, with the ripest being sweeter than younger ones. Nomenclature Banana pepper plant A mature fruit will be about 2‚Äì3 inches (5‚Äì8 cm) in length and have a curved shape and yellowish color similar to a banana, giving rise to the fruit's common name. Friggitelli (pepperoncini) are often erroneously referred to as banana peppers. The hot varieties of banana pepper are called Hungarian wax peppers. Cultivation The plant requires full sun, like other Capsicum annuum varieties, and should be treated the same as most other plants in the pepper family. Plants can be grown from seed and cuttings. A mature plant will reach 1 to 2 feet tall and can be grown in many climates, but prefer warmer climates. Cultivars include Early Sweet Banana, Hungarian Yellow Wax, Long Sweet Yellow, Sweet Banana, and Sweet Hungarian.  Nutritional information Raw banana peppers contain 92% water, 5% carbohydrates, and negligible fat and protein (table). They are rich sources of vitamin C, containing 100% of the Daily Value (DV) in a 100 gram reference amount (table). Vitamin B6 is present in substantial content of 28% DV, with no other micronutrients in appreciable amounts (table). Serving styles *Pickled banana peppers are commonly sold sliced and used to garnish pizzas, sandwiches and Greek salads. *Pickled and stuffed banana peppers are common inclusions on Antipasto bars filled with prosciutto and/or cheese. *Stuffed banana peppers are served warm with a variety of Italian sausage and cheeses. *Chopped or diced banana peppers are used in many relishes and salsas to add sweetness with other peppers providing heat. *Banana peppers may be jellied along with other hot green peppers such as jalape√±os.

He amassed First Professional Football League totals of 303 games and 158 goals during 14 seasons, representing mainly Pirin Blagoevgrad (nine years) and Levski Sofia (three). He also competed professionally in Portugal and Spain. Mihtarski was part of Bulgaria's squad at the 1994 World Cup. In 2002, he started working as a coach. Club career Born in Blagoevgrad, Mihtarski spent the first 13 years of his career (youth years included) with local OFC Pirin, making his first-team ‚Äì and First Professional Football League ‚Äì debuts in 1982‚Äì83, appearing in eight games and scoring four goals in an eventual relegation. He went on to score in double digits in five of the following six seasons. In the summer of 1989, Mihtarski signed for PFC Levski Sofia, netting 24 times in his debut campaign and winning one Bulgarian Cup during his two-year spell. Subsequently, he joined FC Porto in Portugal, being barred by countryman Emil Kostadinov for most of his stay and also being loaned twice to fellow Primeira Liga side F.C. Famalic√£o; in his first year, however, he did manage five goals in only 11 games as the northerners won the national championship for the third time in five years. In February 1994, Mihtarski was released by Porto and rejoined Pirin, netting five times in three months to help the club retain its top flight status. He then joined PFC CSKA Sofia, equalling a career-best 24 goals in the 1994‚Äì95, best in the competition but not good enough for the national title, as former team Levski won the championship with CSKA ranking only fifth. On 23 September 1994, Mihtarksi scored the only goal for CSKA in their record-breaking 1‚Äì7 loss against Levski. During that year's UEFA Cup he added two to help the hosts defeat Juventus F.C. 3‚Äì2, but he was subsequently found to have been ineligible for the match and the opposition were awarded a 3‚Äì0 win; he also found the net in the second leg, a 1‚Äì5 loss in Turin. Mihtarski moved abroad again in January 1996, going on to spend the bulk of the following two seasons without scoring, including for both RCD Mallorca in Spain and VfL Wolfsburg, with both teams in their respective countries' second division. After two more years with Pirin, he retired from the game at the age of 35 winning the first and only Bulgarian championship of his career, with Levski, albeit appearing sparingly. Mihtarski coached several clubs after retiring, including Pirin (2002), Vihren (2004), Belasitsa (2005), and Pirin 1922 (2006). Between 2014 and 2018 he was assistant manager of the Bulgaria U21 team. International career Mihtarski is the most capped player in the history of the Bulgaria U21 team, making 51 appearances and scoring 21 goals. Barred by the likes of Kostadinov, Luboslav Penev, Nasko Sirakov and Hristo Stoitchkov, Mihtarski only earned eight caps for Bulgaria in six years (no goals), his debut coming on 28 April 1988 against Denmark. He was part of the team that reached the semi-finals of the 1994 FIFA World Cup in the United States, but his input in the competition consisted of one minute in the penalty shootout win against Mexico in the round-of-16. Personal life Mihtarski was only the second Bulgarian footballer whose surname did not end with a \\"V\\" to play in the FIFA World Cup finals. The first was Milko Gaydarski, in 1970.

The station was opened on October 25, 1999 by the then president Leonid Kuchma and consists of a large two story structure, with the ground floor consisting of a vestibule and the first floor being on platform level. Encasing it are two mushroom-shaped supports (five on each side), uniting in the top into single roofs. The finish is carried out mostly from plastics although aluminium, marble and granite are also present. However, the latter materials' low quantity is enough to create the impression of their absence. The platform floors' are nevertheless riveted with labradorite. Fifty meters to the north of the station is a reversal ring with a small hangar for stands and low-level repairs. In the near future the station might cease to be the terminus if a fourth stage of the tram is built to the Terenivskyi raion of Kryvyi Rih. The opening of the station was very important for the Metro Tram as a transport artery; for the city this is particularly evident as two interim stations prior were skipped. This allowed the length of the system to rise by a quarter, however as the district it is situated in is physically separated from the rest of the stations, it led to a dramatic increase in passenger flow through the tram.

It is currently owned by the Daughters of the American Revolution, and open by appointment. The colonial site first belonged to Richard Ingersoll (died 1644). In 1670 his wife left the land to her second husband upon her death, and thence to his daughter Sarah, whose second husband Joseph Holten deeded the lot (and perhaps also the house) to his son Benjamin Holten. Benjamin died in 1689, and his will records both the land and a house. Given this background, it is believed that Benjamin Holten built the house circa 1670 in a typical \\"one-room\\" layout. The house has been extended six times since until 1832. The house is historically interesting as the home of Sarah Holten, who in 1692 gave testimony against Rebecca Nurse which led to her death in the Salem Witch Trials. During the American Revolutionary War, it was the home of Judge Samuel Holten, who served in the Continental Congress, including as its president pro tempore, was a signer of the Articles of Confederation, and who was an early member of the United States House of Representatives (March 4, 1793 ‚Äì March 3, 1795).

These portrayals often emphasize controversy such as polygamy or myths about The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and other Latter Day Saint movement religions.  Overview  The second half of the story, The Country of the Saints, is set in the United States and includes an appearance by Brigham Young. Controversial, negative portrayals Portrayals of Mormons and of Mormonism in both literature and movies have drawn criticism, with critics such as d'Arc describing the bulk of what the world heard of Mormons in the 19th and early-20th century, via the literature of the day, as \\"polygamy, mystic revelations to modern prophets, golden bibles, and scheming missionaries adding continually to their harem of wives\\", and stating that this portrayal found its way into movies. =In 19th century literature= Two examples of 19th century books that incorporate the images d'Arc complained about are: Jules Verne's classic novel Around the World in Eighty Days (1873) references a \\"Mormon Elder\\" who launches into a diatribe about his religion in a rail car where passenger Passepartout becomes a captive audience. Verne follows the 19th-century propensity to view polygamy as central to Mormonism, going so far as to call it, \\"the sole basis of the religion.\\" Arthur Conan Doyle's detective novel A Study in Scarlet (1887) is another portrayal that caused controversy. Mormons viewed the portrayal of the Danites in the book as highly erroneous, being yet another instance of anti- Mormon antagonism in popular media. Conan Doyle, according to his daughter, had relied upon what had been published about Mormons by former Mormons (historians believing these probably to be Fannie Stenhouse, William A. Hickman, William Jarman, John Hyde, and Ann Eliza Young), believing those accounts to be factual. Conan Doyle visited the United States in 1923, and one leg of his lecture tour took him to the University of Utah, to lecture on spiritualism. During his stay he received a letter from a Dr. G. Hodgson Higgins, who had formed his impressions of Mormonism based upon the portrayal in A Study in Scarlet, which \\"gave the impression that murder was a common practice among them\\", and who suggested that Conan Doyle \\"express his regret at having propagated falsehoods about the Mormon Church and people\\". Conan Doyle refused to withdraw what he had written about the Danites and the murders, on the grounds that it was a matter of historical record, but stated that his treatment in the novel was more \\"lurid\\" than the treatment by a history textbook would have been, and promised that in the future his portrayals of the Latter-day Saints would be based upon his firsthand experience of them on his visit. Subsequent Mormon characters in Conan Doyle's work were indeed more sympathetic.. Online reprint , with permission, at HistoryToGo.utah.gov by the Utah Division of State History, Utah Department of Heritage and Arts, State of Utah. =In 20th century film= D'Arc gives two examples of the films from 1905 to 1936 that incorporate the images he complained about: the Danish film A Victim of the Mormons (1911), wherein a young Mormon missionary in Copenhagen lures the fiance√© of a close friend to elope with him to Utah, whereupon he locks her in his basement (a film whose showing Governor of Utah William Spry fought to prevent); and the film A Mormon Maid (1917), incorporating what d'Arc describes as \\"the innocent- daughter-catching-the-eye-of-powerful-Mormon-leader formula\\". D'Arc argues that the reason that such portrayals became sparse in the 1930s was the introduction of the Hays and later Breen regulatory codes, which sharply curtailed the portrayal of polygamy in movies. Positive portrayals Portrayals of Mormon characters in popular writing have not been universally viewed as negative by Mormons. For example: The portrayals of Mormons in the work of Orson Scott Card, himself a Mormon, have been viewed as sympathetic of the Mormon world view that reach hundreds of thousands of readers worldwide, and thus that form a useful starting point for Mormons to explain Mormonism to non-Mormons. Similarly, the portrayals of Mormons and of Mormonism presented by Harold Bloom (extolling Mormonism as the quintessential American religion, Charles Dickens (describing the industrious, orderly nature of the Mormon emigrants he encountered on a ship leaving England), John Stuart Mill (using Mormon beliefs as test cases for his assertion that government should not interfere in the private lives of individuals), George Bernard Shaw (carrying Mill's argument further), Joseph Smith as \\"an authentic religious genius, unique in our national history\\"), and Wallace Stegner (in The Gathering of Zion) are all seen as sympathetic to Mormons. Michael Austin's analysis of Mormon portrayals Mormon literary critics, such as Michael Austin, consider the portrayal of Mormons in popular writing to have completely changed over the course of the 20th century, with the portrayal of Mormonism in the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century being that of \\"a harsh, theocratic, and conspiratorial frontier community\\" and \\"a sinister secret society bent on tracking down and destroying its enemies wherever in the world they tried to hide\\". At the time, Austin states that Mormons were icons of lawlessness, chaos, and sexual promiscuity, conceptions of Mormons and Mormonism that he views to have been incorporated into the works of Arthur Conan Doyle, Zane Grey, Jack London, Robert Louis Stevenson, Mark Twain, and even the made-for-TV movie The Avenging Angel (1995)). The portrayal at the end of the 20th century, in works by writers from Tom Clancy to Tony Kushner, is described by Austin as being of people who are \\"hyperobedient, patriotic, conservative, and, in all probability, sexually repressed\\". He argues that although the portrayal has changed, its relation to mainstream society has not. In both cases, the portrayal of Mormons and Mormonism is highly distinct from the mainstream, he argues, with the 19th century portrayal being in stark contrast to the Victorian values of the time, and the late-20th century portrayal being ironically that of a \\"Victorian misfit in a promiscuous society\\". He argues that the role of Mormons and Mormonism in popular writing is \\"to establish a foil for the [mainstream] values supported in the text\\". After a lengthy analysis of Mormon stereotypes in popular fiction, Austin draws the following conclusions: * To the extent that popular literature is able to reflect popular sentiment, Mormons are not as well perceived in the larger American culture as most people would like to believe. * Most of these negative images have been fixed since the 19th century. * These stereotypes should not be confused with genuine political critique. * By studying the way that Mormons are portrayed in popular genre fiction insight can be gained into the way that Mormonism functions as a category in American culture.  In the 19th and 20th centuries  In addition to the works listed in the Overview, 19th and 20th Century literary and film portrayals of Mormons include: FilmsPaint Your Wagon *Paint Your Wagon (musical) (1951-1952) and its film adaptation Paint Your Wagon (film) (1969) include depictions of a Mormon elder auctioning off a polygamist wife. Space Jam Space Jam (1996) Shawn Bradley plays himself in the live-action/animated family sports comedy film. During a scene in which Bradley is conversing with a psychologist, he mentions his time as an LDS Church missionary in Australia. Orgazmo Orgazmo (1997) is an American satirical sex comedy film about a young Mormon who gets roped into making a pornographic movie while on a church mission in Los Angeles.  In the 21st century  In the 21st century, positive portrayals of Mormons in popular media are still perceived by Mormons as rare; most portrayals are viewed as \\"usually just polygamy jokes for a cheap laugh, or the 'hip' thing nowadays--gay Mormon missionaries.\\" Some examples of portrayals of LDS Church members in popular media are listed below.

The play has several storylines, some of which occasionally intersect. One of the featured storylines is that of, \\"Joe, a young Mormon lawyer, who has taken on the right-wing potentate and monster Roy Cohn as a mentor. Two gay men, neither willing to admit it (though Cohn has started to die of AIDS-related causes). Joe strikes up a friendship with gay Louis, and soon they are lovers; but though opposites may attract, they're still opposites. Says Louis: 'I can't believe I spent three weeks in bed with a Mormon.' After a drunken Joe calls his mother Hannah to say he's gay, she sells her Salt Lake City home and heads east to save him, while working as a volunteer in the Mormon Visitors' Center. Joe finally ends his affair by punching Louis during a fight.\\" The work won numerous awards, including the Pulitzer Prize for Drama, the Tony Award for Best Play, and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Play. The play was later created as a 2003 American HBO miniseries, by the same name. The miniseries starred actors, Al Pacino, Meryl Streep, Patrick Wilson, Mary-Louise Parker, and Emma Thompson. = The Book of Mormon musical = In March 2011, a religious satire musical opened on Broadway entitled The Book of Mormon. Conceived by Trey Parker, Matt Stone, and Robert Lopez, the play tells the story of two young Mormon missionaries sent to a remote village in northern Uganda, where a brutal warlord is threatening the local population. Naive and optimistic, the two missionaries try to share their scriptures‚Äîwhich only one of them knows very well‚Äîbut have trouble connecting with the locals, who are worried about famine, poverty, and AIDS. The Guardian reported the play was \\"not a problem\\" for the LDS Church because they were, \\"made of sterner stuff\\".Walker, Peter. \\"Book of Mormon not a problem for the Latter-Day Saints\\", The Guardian, 1 April 2020.

TelevisionBig Love= The HBO show Big Love stars Bill Paxton as Bill Henrickson, a modern-day polygamist who lives in suburban Salt Lake City with his three wives and seven children. Commentators such as Jesella and Ryan point out that polygamy was banned by the LDS Church \\"more than 100 years ago\\" and is against the law in Utah, the state where the show is set, and that the family is not explicitly Mormon. A statement to that effect precedes the first episode but is presented as \\"being some sort of cult-like offshoot of the church\\". Other commentators have simply described the Henricksons as a \\"Mormon family\\" and left it to others to draw the distinction. The show has caused controversy, with Mormons and LDS Church leaders reacting to what they perceive as being a veiled stereotype. The LDS Church released an official statement saying: :The Church has long been concerned about the continued illegal practice of polygamy, and, in particular, about reports of child and wife abuse emanating from polygamous communities today. It will be regrettable if this program, by making polygamy the subject of entertainment, minimizes the seriousness of the problem. Placing the series in Salt Lake City, the international headquarters of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is enough to blur the line between the modern Church and the program's subject matter, and to reinforce old and long-outdated stereotypes. Big Love, like so much other television programming, is essentially lazy and indulgent entertainment that does nothing for our society and will never nourish great minds. HBO defended its show, asserting that its portrayal of the characters as outside of the LDS Church and continually having to hide their status from other people actually helps to educate non-Mormons about Mormonism, with Carolyn Strauss, president of HBO Entertainment, saying: :It is interesting how many people are ignorant about the Mormon church and think that the Mormon church actually does condone polygamy. So in an odd way, the show is sort of beneficial in drawing that distinction. The show again hit a sensitive spot when, in 2009, it recreated a temple ceremony that members of the church consider to be sacred. The creators deemed it \\"a very important part of the story\\" and made it clear that they were going to air the episode as planned after apologizing for offending anyone. The church's response to the news about the ceremony stated that as an institution, they would not call for a boycott. Also, it stated that despite assurances three years ago from HBO and the creators of Big Love that the show was not about Mormons, Mormon themes and increasingly unsympathetic characters were being woven into the show. =Cold Case= The portrayal of Mormons in Cold Case has also drawn criticism from Chris Hicks for being disrespectful. He has stated that the program is an example of the unequal treatment of Mormons, stating that where insane people of other religions are portrayed in television drama, pains are taken to point out as part of the plot that they are \\"non-practicing\\", yet no such pains are taken when it comes to Mormons. As a result, the faith is seen as directly related to the insanity of one character with the implication being that all Mormons are strange people. He also expressed concerns that the temple garments of Mormons did not receive the same sympathetic dramatic treatment or respect as do the sacred symbols of other religions. =Dexter= In season 6, episode 10 of the popular series Dexter, there is a reference to Mormonism connecting it to a radicalized end of days killer. The entire season focuses on religious symbols. In this episode, Angel Batista notices a bookcase full of fictional covers of the suspect Dr. Gellar's books dealing with the end of days. Among them is the third volume of the early Mormon historical fiction series The Work and the Glory, subtitled \\"Truth Will Prevail\\". =Mrs Brown's Boys= Irish hit series, Mrs. Brown's Boys features an episode about religion in which the Mormon missionaries turn up at her house and discuss religion. She mistakes them for undertakers, and holds them \\"hostage\\" for a couple of hours.\\"Mrs. Brown & the Mormons\\", BBC, 22 March 2011. Retrieved on 25 March 2020. =Psych= In Season 6, Episode 9 of Psych, girls sporting Brigham Young University (BYU) shirts are seen entering a bar. This caused controversy because students at BYU, owned by the LDS Church, do not drink alcohol.http://www.ksl.com/?nid=1011&sid;=18526229 =South Park= Commentators have been surprised by the comparatively positive portrayal of Latter-day Saints in South Park. Mormon commentators have described it as \\"unexpectedly, our best treatment\\". In South Park, despite the fact that Mormon characters are \\"generally pollyannas with bike helmets and missionary tags\\", and an entire episode, \\"All About Mormons\\", is devoted to lampooning Joseph Smith and the founding of the religion, the portrayal is considered to be generally positive. In the episode \\"Super Best Friends\\", Smith is portrayed positively, appearing in a Super Friends parody involving other religious figures who are allied in the fight against David Blaine. In the episode \\"Probably\\", it is only the Mormons who \\"got it right\\" and who go to heaven after death and all adherents of other religions go to hell, though this \\"reversal of fortune\\" is likely just a literary device for giving debates of religious salvation a humorously ironic twist, rather than a meaningful endorsement of Mormonism. Mormon characters in the series are the only ones who commentators view to be \\"consistently compassionate, or even courteous\\". = Hell on Wheels = Hell on Wheels seasons 3 and 4 prominently feature Mormons as both antagonists and secondary characters. Hell on Wheels follows the building of the Transcontinental railroad, much of which was built through Mormon territory. Brigham Young (portrayed by Gregg Henry) also appears in multiple episodes throughout the third, fourth, and fifth seasons. VideogamesFallout= In Fallout, a video game series set in post- nuclear war America, Mormons are portrayed as one of the last surviving religions. One of the biggest and most powerful Mormon controlled towns is New Canaan, built on the ruins of Ogden, Utah. Mormons are featured heavily in Fallout: New Vegas expansion \\"Honest Hearts\\", wherein their missionaries are spreading the religion to tribals in Zion National Park and teaching them to defend themselves against neighboring tribes and Caesars Legion, a totalitarian slaver society co-founded by Joshua Graham, one of the Mormon missionaries now turned against Caesar.

A Senator and Ambassador to the Soviet Union, he was a three- time governor of San Juan Province, where he came to be regarded as a caudillo (kingmaker). Career Bravo was born in San Juan, the illegitimate son of Governor Federico Cantoni, and Enoe Bravo. In an era in which men of higher social status could often opt not to do so, Cantoni acknowledged the child as his own, though young Leopoldo opted to keep his mother's last name when he came of age. Bravo graduated from the University of La Plata with a law degree in 1942. At a young age Bravo joined the leadership of the Partido Bloquista, a provincial party which split from the ruling Radical Civic Union during the 1916-22 tenure of President Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen. He was appointed charg√© d'affaires at the Argentine Embassy in Moscow, in 1946, and in 1953 he was appointed as Ambassador to the Soviet Union by President Juan Per√≥n, succeeding Cantoni, his father. He was one of the few ambassadors to have had an interview with Joseph Stalin, as well as the last. He was elected Governor of San Juan with Peronist support in 1962, but President Arturo Frondizi was forced to annul the elections due to military and conservative objections to Peronism; he ran again in 1963, and took office, serving until 1966. A pragmatic and experienced politician, Bravo advised civilian and military governments, and he maintained ties with the exiled Per√≥n, though was opposed to most of the CGT labor union and Peronist movement leadership. Bravo was a vice-presidential candidate on the ticket led by Brig. Gen. Ezequiel Mart√≠nez, backed by then-President Alejandro Lanusse, in the March 1973 elections. Although they lost that election, Bravo was elected to the Senate for the first time that year. The Senate was dissolved in 1976 by a military coup. During the military government following the 1976 coup, Bravo was reappointed Ambassador to the Soviet Union and Mongolia, serving until 1981, and, briefly, Ambassador to Italy. He was appointed governor of San Juan in 1982. In 1983 his brother, Federico Bravo, succeeded him as ambassador in Moscow. When democracy returned in 1983, Leopoldo was again elected governor; but a poor showing in the 1985 legislative elections led him to resign halfway through the term. Bravo was elected senator for his province in 1989. He allied himself with President Carlos Menem, and his vote was decisive in the Senate approval of the 1993 Olivos Pact that allowed the President to stand for a second term. After his retirement as leader, Bravo became honorary president of the Partido Bloquista, which went on to participate in the ruling Alliance of Fernando de la R√∫a and take over the government of San Juan once again after the impeachment of the incumbent. Bravo stepped down from the Senate in 2001. In his final years, he suffered from Alzheimer's, and had withdrawn from public life. He died of an intestinal haemorrhage and cardiac arrest. Five hundred people attended his funeral, although his wife could not be present. He and his wife Ivelise Falcioni had six children. One of Bravo's sons, Leopoldo Alfredo Bravo, a former deputy, was appointed Ambassador to Russia a week before his father's death, following in the footsteps of his father, uncle and grandfather.

As proconsul of Macedonia in 72 BC, he defeated the Bessi in Thrace and advanced to the Danube and the west coast of the Black Sea. In addition, he was marginally involved in the Third Servile War (a.k.a. Spartacus' War). Biography=Name and family Born in Rome as Marcus Licinius Lucullus, he was later adopted by an otherwise unknown Marcus Terentius Varro (not the scholar Varro Reatinus).Keaveney 8; Arkenberg 333. As a result of the adoption, his full official name, as quoted in inscriptions, became M(arcus) Terentius M(arci) Varro Lucullus.i.e., Marcus Terentius, son of Marcus, Varro Lucullus, cf. 'CIL' 1(2).719 = 11.6331. Literary texts usually refer to him as M. Lucullus or simply Lucullus which in the case of Appian, Civil Wars 1.120, for example, caused confusion with Marcus' more famous brother, Lucius Licinius Lucullus. By birth, Marcus Lucullus was a member of a prominent plebeian family, the gens Licinia. He was the grandson of the consul (151 BC) Lucius Licinius Lucullus. His father, Lucius Licinius Lucullus, had reached the praetorship (104 BC) and could boast military successes in the oppression of the slaves in Lucania and Sicily during the Second Servile War. In 101 BC, however, the older Lucullus' career was cut short when he was convicted of embezzlement. The mother of Marcus and Lucius Lucullus, Caecilia Metella Calva, was closely related to two of the most influential men of his time. Lucius Cornelius Sulla, the dictator, married her niece, Caecilia Metella Dalmatica, as his fourth wife. Sulla's close ally, the pontifex maximus and consul (80 BC) Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius, was a son of Caecilia Metella Calva's brother, Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus, and thus a cousin of Marcus Lucullus. First public activities In the early 90s, young Marcus and his brother Lucius unsuccessfully prosecuted Servilius the Augur. This man had earlier functioned as the prosecutor in the trial for embezzlement (de repetundis) that sent their father, Lucius Licinius Lucullus into exile to Lucania.Cic.Acad.2.1; Plut. Lucullus 1; Keaveney 4-6; on the debate over the exact date see id. 6, n. 14. Service under Sulla When Sulla returned from the East in the spring of 83 BC to fight the Marians, Marcus Lucullus, like his brother Lucius, joined Sulla's forces. He served under his cousin, the proconsul Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius, as a legatus in Northern Italy. At first, Marcus Lucullus was forced to retreat into the small town of Placentia, but once Metellus defeated the superior troops of the Marian general Gaius Norbanus, Marcus Lucullus broke the siege and defeated a detachment left behind by Norbanus.Oros. 5.20.3; Mommsen, History of Rome bk. 4, p. 87. At Fidentia, he commanded 15 cohorts (c. 3,600 men) and managed to defeat a superior force of 50 cohorts (12,000 men) under Gnaeus Papirius Carbo‚Äôs legate Quinctius of which his troops killed 1,800 men.Liv.

Priesthood Probably at the suggestion of his first cousin, the Pontifex Maximus Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius, Marcus Lucullus was nominated for and elected to the Pontifical College. This may have happened when Sulla expanded the Pontifical College from 9 to 15 members in 81 BC.thus J√∂rg R√ºpke, Vitae Sacerdotum, under [DNr2602] M. Terentius M. f. Varro Lucullus (http://www.uni- erfurt.de/vergleichende_religionswissenschaft/bio.htm); certainly before 76 BC, see Taylor, \\"Caesar's Colleagues\\" 411 Membership in one of the four major priestly colleges was an honor that was considered almost equal to winning a consulship,Mommsen, Staatsrecht I 583 and it boded well for Marcus Lucullus' future career.Vitae sacerdotum Aedileship Even though he was not even present at the elections of 80 BC, Marcus Lucullus was elected to serve as curule aedile for 79 BC together with his older brother Lucius Licinius Lucullus, who had recently returned from the Roman province of Asia.Plutarch, Lucullus 1.6 Their aedileship was distinguished by games which Cicero much later still remembered for their splendor.Cic.De off. 2.57 Among other things, the brothers introduced revolving backdrops for the temporary stage that they had built for theatrical performances. Moreover, they were the first to pit an elephant against a steer in the arena.Plin.Nat. Hist. 8.19; Keaveney 36 Judge Elected praetor peregrinus, the praetor in charge of court cases involving non-Roman citizens, for 76 BC, Marcus Lucullus presided over one cause c√©l√®bre, the trial against Gaius Antonius Hybrida (later Cicero's colleague as consul). Antonius had enriched himself shamelessly as a legate of Sulla in Greece during the First Mithridatic War. The prosecutor, the young Julius Caesar, won a conviction. Antonius managed, however, to have his conviction overturned by appealing to the people's tribunes. because, as he said, he could not get a fair trial in Rome against a Greek man.Asconius p. 84 Clark; Q. Cic. Comm. Pet. 8; Plut. Caes. 4; Gelzer, Caesar 21 Apart from this, the praetor Marcus Lucullus is credited with an edict against armed gangs of slaves that authorized victims to demand compensation of four times the amount of their damages from the slaves' owners.Cic. \\"Tull.\\" 8-11; Gelzer, \\"Caesar\\" 34-35. Macedonia province within the Roman Empire, c. 120.

Marble slab telling about the conquest of Marcus Terentius Varro Lucullus against the western Black Sea Greek provinces, 1st century BC. Exhibit of Burgas Archaeological Museum After his consulship, Marcus Lucullus became governor (proconsul) of the important province of Macedonia. He used his tenure to lead a successful campaign against a neighboring tribe, the Thracian Bessi. In the course of this war, he advanced to the Danube and the west coast of the Black Sea where he conquered a number of Greek cities that had been bases of Mithridates VI The Great, including Apollonia, Kallatis (Callatis), Tomi, and Istros.Sall. Hist. 4.18 M.; Eutrop. 6.10.1; J. Harmatta, Studies in the History and Language of the Sarmatians: http://www.kroraina.com/sarm/jh/jh1_6.html. For these achievements, he was awarded a triumph which he held in 71 BC.Cicero, Pis. 44; Eutrop. 6.10.1. Part of the booty from this campaign was a colossal statue of Apollo that Marcus Lucullus took from a temple on an island near Apollonia. It may have been on the occasion of his triumph that he set it up in the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus.Strabo, Geography 7.6.1; Pliny, Nat. Hist. 4.92 and 34.38. Earlier in the same year, 71 BC, Marcus Lucullus also played a minor role in the defeat of Spartacus' slave army. He was prematurely recalled from his post in Macedonia in order to assist with the suppression of the rebellious slaves. At the time, Spartacus had just managed to force his way through Crassus' troops that had him cornered near Rhegium, across from Sicily, and made his way to Brundisium, across from Greece, presumably to sail from there to Greece or Illyrium. Yet when he received the news that Marcus Lucullus and his troops had already landed in Brundisium, he turned around and faced Crassus' pursuing army for the final and decisive battle of the war. Later life and death In 70 BC, Marcus Lucullus helped Cicero achieve his famous prosecution of Verres by appearing as a witness for the prosecution (as did his consular colleague from 73, Gaius Cassius Longinus Varus, among others). In 66 or 65 BC, Marcus Lucullus was put on trial by Gaius Memmius for his activities under Sulla but acquitted.Plutarch, Lucullus 37. In 65, he spoke as one of the witnesses for the prosecution in the maiestas trial against the former people's tribune Gaius Cornelius whom the nobility considered a revolutionary; Cornelius was defended by Cicero.Gelzer, Cicero 62-63, Ward. In 63 BC, Marcus Lucullus opposed the attempt of Catilina to kill the consuls, among them Cicero, and overthrow the government. In the following year, he served as the main witness for the defense in the trial against his friend, the poet Licinius Archias, in which Cicero gave his famous speech in defense of Archias' claims to Roman citizenship. Later, in 58 and 57 BC, Marcus Lucullus belonged to the group that worked behind the scenes to enable Cicero's return from exile. When his brother, Lucius Lucullus, lost his mental powers, Marcus Lucullus became his legal guardian; he buried him at his Tusculan estate in 56 BC.

The station plays a hot adult contemporary format branded as K94.5 and is owned by the Maritime Broadcasting System. History CKCW originally began broadcasting on December 4, 1934 at 1370 AM with only 100 watts of power. The station was originally owned & operated by Moncton Broadcasting Company Ltd, managed by F.A. (Fred) Lynds. The AM frequency changed to 1400 in 1941, and then to its final AM position at 1220 in 1946. Eastern Radio Broadcasting (now known as MBS radio), purchased CKCW in 1972. CKCW was the only privately owned AM radio station ever to operate in Moncton. Over the years, many radio personalities who worked at CKCW 1220 AM would attain such bigger success in larger markets such as Bro Jake, Bob Powers (The Legend), Marty Kingston and Larry Hennessey. In 1976, CKCW's sister station was granted a licence to operate on the FM band at 103.9 FM as this would be the first FM radio station in Moncton. CFQM-FM first went on the air in 1977 with an easy listening format until it switched to a country music format on January 1, 1979. A co-owned television station, CKCW-TV, signed on the air in 1954 but was sold to CHUM Limited in 1972. CHUM limited which owned & operated CKCW-TV became CTV Globemedia in 2007 and then Bell Media in 2011. CKCW-TV has now become part of the CTV Atlantic (formerly ATV) network. During the 1990s, CKCW had an adult contemporary/easy listening format, then in 1994, the station switched to an oldies format. In August 1998, the station switched formats with sister station CFQM-FM which rebranded as an adult contemporary station as \\"Magic 104\\" and CKCW becoming a country music station. Original K 94.5 logo In 2001, CKCW moved to 94.5 FM,Decision CRTC 2000-360 and changed to a CHR format, branded as Moncton's Newest Music K94.5. The new K94.5 enjoyed early success with the new music format; however, constant tweaking of the format and lack of advertising led to the downfall of the format. By 2009, when sister station CFQM-FM switched from adult contemporary to classic hits, the station switched to its current hot adult contemporary format, but kept the K94 branding. A little while later, CIOK-FM in Saint John, New Brunswick did the same thing by moving from adult contemporary to hot adult contemporary. CIOK-FM moved back to an adult contemporary format as of September 2015. CKCW was the first station to hire international syndicated radio star AJ Reynolds. CIOK-FM was never listed on Mediabase until March 2011, but used the same adds as CKCW-FM even after the Hot AC/adult top 40 shifts at those stations in 2009.

More than 50 governments and rebel groups would be monitored after the passing of the resolution. Resolution=Observations In the preamble of the resolution, the Security Council recognised progress in developing guidelines to protect children in armed conflict, but in practice, their rights were still violated with impunity and there was lack of progress on the ground. Furthermore, it highlighted connections between the use of children and illicit arms trafficking. Acts As with previous resolutions on the topic, the Council condemned the use and recruitment of child soldiers. The Secretary-General Kofi Annan was asked to implement the following mechanism of reporting and monitoring children in armed conflict: :(a) gather information on the recruitment of child soldiers and the abuse of children; :(b) collaborate with relevant authorities and United Nations agencies; :(c) strengthen the protective role of governments; :(d) dialogues with armed groups as part of a peace process. A working group was also established to monitor the reports of the mechanism and make recommendations. The Security Council noted the lack of progress in implementing Resolution 1539 and expressed its intention to impose sanctions against countries which violate international law relating to children in armed conflict and are also on the agenda of the Security Council. It was the responsibility of the country teams of the United Nations to conduct follow-up work on Security Council resolutions.

At the 2016 census the population was 152. It is mainly an Australian Aboriginal community, run by the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community Council. Geography Wreck Bay Village is located at the northeast corner of Wreck Bay between the small coves called Mary Bay and Summercloud Bay. It is located in the south of the territory. It is about south of Jervis Bay Airfield and by road from Jervis Bay Village. History The first European settlement around Jervis Bay started in the early 1880s. Wreck Bay forms part of the Jervis Bay Territory, and it became Commonwealth territory in 1915 so the national government based in Canberra could have access to the sea. Wreck Bay is called Wreck Bay because the waves are generally quite high and it is easy for a ship to be destroyed. Aboriginal people started a small settlement at Summercloud Bay around the early 1900s. They favoured the area because of strong cultural ties, its closeness to both the bush and the sea for collection of food and other sources and because of its distance from European settlements. This area later became an Aboriginal reserve known as the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Reserve that was put under control of a mission manager. The decision to create this permanent settlement has enabled cultural practices to survive. The of land was officially handed to the Aboriginal community in 1995 by the Australian Government, including Booderee National Park and Botanic Gardens. Booderee The Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community owns and co-manages (with Parks Australia), the Booderee National Park and Botanic Gardens. It includes Australia's only Aboriginal- owned and managed botanical garden. Current status The Wreck Bay Village is now private land and no public access is available.

The film employs techniques of metafictional parody to make overt critical comparisons between 1990s TV detective shows and their 1970s counterparts. The editorial line taken throughout the film presents a very affectionate portrayal of several of these 1970s shows, despite acknowledging their use of styles and methods that had since become somewhat clich√©d. The title parodies the title of the 1988 film, Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown. Major characters=Bonehead and Foyle Writer-directors Keith Allen and Peter Richardson revive their characters Bonehead and Foyle from the 1984 Comic Strip film The Bullshitters, which was itself a parody of The Professionals. As in the previous film, Bonehead and Foyle attach great importance to guns, witty one-liners and self-conscious efforts at looking un-self-consciously good on-screen. They manoeuvre and park their car ‚Äì a Ford Capri, as used in The Professionals ‚Äì with almost exclusive use of handbrake turns, and during the film's climax they concentrate on seeking out piles of boxes to drive through or puddles to splash through, in order to make their shots appear more dynamic. For the second half of the film they again appear without shirts and, finally, without trousers. George Introduced as \\"Shouting George from The Weeny\\", George is based on Jack Regan of The Sweeney. He is played by Jim Broadbent, and his portrayal is remarkably close to the original. George uses London slang extensively, shouts, chain-smokes and insists on calling his commanding officer \\"guv\\". His detective methods involve visiting East End \\"villains' drinkers\\" in search of information. In common with Bonehead and Foyle he drives and parks his car ‚Äì a 1970s Ford Granada, as seen in The Sweeney ‚Äì recklessly. Jason Bentley Jason Bentley of Department Z is a parody of Department S's Jason King, and is played by Peter Richardson. Shown to be running a 1970s retro clothes shop (Flares 'R' Us), Bentley dresses in red and purple crushed velvet suits. Bentley drives a vintage Bentley (as does Jason King) at a very leisurely, relaxed speed, since he ofttimes has a glass of claret in one hand. He bemoans this may eventually become illegal. In solving crimes, Bentley prefers to make no visible effort at all, since he anticipates that all the plot devices required to solve the case will arrive by themselves in due course. Peter Wyngarde, interviewed on BBC TV when this episode was originally transmitted, was flattered by the parody but insisted that Jason King would never wear crushed velvet. Dave Spanker TV detectives of the 1990s are principally represented on-screen by Dave Spanker, played by Phil Cornwell and based on the eponymous lead character from Spender. In appearance, he is unshaven with untidy shoulder-length hair, but he wears \\"expensive Armani suits\\". In action, he is dour, slow-moving and speaks very little, except in nostalgic non-sequiturs about shipbuilding on the Tyne. Upon arrival at all locations he prefers to stand gazing out of an available window. The writers draw attention to the fact that he always sensibly parks and central-locks his Ford Sierra. There is some crossover between the parodying of the Spender character and the actor who played him, Jimmy Nail, as when a musical number ends with a line from Nail's 1992 single, \\"Ain't No Doubt\\". Plot The film opens on the studio set of a fictional 1990s TV show, The Gourmet Detective. This is depicted as a crass cross-genre detective/cookery series (\\"two recipes and one murder per show\\"), whose lead character (played by Keith Allen) presents his recipe in a style that parodies Keith Floyd. Allen's \\"on-screen\\" Gourmet Detective character is the epitome of politically correct \\"new man\\" compassion, but the actor \\"off-screen\\" is shown to be an obnoxious, drug-taking womaniser. He is subsequently murdered ‚Äì the second TV detective to be killed in six months ‚Äì and the rest of the film involves the search for his assassin. The police commander (played by Jim Carter) is exasperated that the detective assigned to the case, Dave Spanker, has come up with much \\"Northern nostalgia\\" but no leads. Cheesecloth and the footprint of a 1970s platform shoe are found at the scene, inspiring him to bring in 1970s-style detectives to help solve the crime ‚Äì initially Bonehead, Foyle and George. When the platform shoe is revealed to be from the early 1970s, Jason Bentley is added to the team, and the commander insists that Bentley's methods alone are to be used (\\"no guns, no fast cars, no shouting\\"). Bentley consequently drives the detectives to a random country house, drinks copious claret, smokes endless cigarettes, and predictably gets nowhere with the case. The frustrated detectives have a punch-up while they are ‚Äì on Bentley's advice ‚Äì \\"waiting for a Mini Moke to turn up\\". The commander gives the team a dressing-down, and explains that, with the TV-cop-killer still at large, the production of various 1990s TV cop shows is under threat. In order to highlight further the writers' views of contemporary TV detective shows, he lists these as The Dull as Dishwater Detective, Detectives on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown and The Whistling Detective Who Lives on a Barge. The Dull as Dishwater Detective is apparently in hiatus because \\"the actor's run abroad, he's scared\\" ‚Äì a reference to the real TV series Inspector Morse, whose lead actor John Thaw was making A Year in Provence at this time. Thaw had previously played Regan in The Sweeney. Bonehead, Foyle and George insist they be allowed to proceed with the investigation their way, complete with fast cars and guns. The commander reluctantly agrees to give them 48 hours, and they gleefully wheel-spin away to a rendezvous at an East End drinking den. Meanwhile, a sheepish Bentley asks to see the original lab reports. At the pub, George asks to see his informant, while Bonehead and Foyle order Babychams then storm the toilet cubicles the way they might storm an embassy. However, Bentley provides the breakthrough. He reveals that the forensic report proves the platform shoes were bought in Newcastle upon Tyne. After Spanker confesses that he committed the crimes due to TV ratings pressure, he makes his escape. There ensues a 1970s-style high-speed car chase involving all but Bentley, based mainly in a large yard where all three cars drive around somewhat pointlessly in circles. The repeated handbrake-turns wreck Foyle's gearbox and, in frustration at missing out on the car chase, Bonehead briefly considers leaving his partner. However, the chase continues on foot into London Docklands, where Spanker takes refuge. Bonehead and Foyle ‚Äì as is customary for them ‚Äì remove their trousers for this final showdown, and then bemoan the Docklands redevelopment that has taken place since the 1970s: \\"where's all the wasteland and disused factories?\\". They nevertheless negotiate the area trouserlessly as if it is still full of rusty girders and rubble, to the bemusement of passing city workers. Meanwhile, George attempts to talk Spanker into a surrender. Spanker complains that, with the increased realism in TV detective shows, he has missed out on the fast cars and the \\"shoot a man at a hundred yards crap\\" enjoyed by his 1970s counterparts. To prove the point, he feels no ill effects when George shoots him from this very distance as an apparent 1970s denouement to the scene. However, Bentley now magically appears exactly where the plot requires him to appear, right alongside Spanker. In a typically relaxed and tangential fashion, he manages to capture the detective effortlessly. George devises a punishment for Spanker far worse than being shot at close range ‚Äì Spanker will instead be \\"shot on tape\\". He has his scruffy hair cut to a regulation police constable's length, in order to take his place as \\"a faceless copper in uniform - three nights a week\\". Spanker's suitably TV-based punishment is to become a member of the cast of The Bill. The film ends on an up-beat note, with Bonehead, Foyle, George, Bentley and the commander all drinking to \\"the Seventies\\". Quotes *George: \\"Listen guv, I'm a ten-guv-a-day copper, always have been, always will be. If you want me to work on this case, I'm going to be calling you \\"guv\\" all day long.

Song The song's authorship is uncertain, but according to hobo poetry researcher Bud L. McKillips the words were written by an IWW member. Some verses, though, may have been written by a Kansas City hobo known only as \\"One-Finger Ellis,\\" who scribbled it on the wall of his prison cell in 1897.Milburn, p. 97 There is also a questionable theory that Harry McClintock could have written it in 1897 when he was only fifteen. Sung to the tune of the Presbyterian hymn \\"Revive Us Again\\", the song was printed by the Industrial Workers of the World in 1908, and adopted by its Spokane, Washington branch as their anthem later that year. The success of their Free speech fights of 1909 led to its widespread popularity. The version published in 1908 goes: :Why don't you work like other folks do? :How the hell can I work when there's no work to do? ::Refrain ::Hallelujah, I'm a bum, ::Hallelujah, bum again, ::Hallelujah, give us a handout ::To revive us again. :Oh, why don't you save all the money you earn? :If I didn't eat, I'd have money to burn. :Whenever I get all the money I earn, :The boss will be broke, and to work he must turn. :Oh, I like my boss, he's a good friend of mine, :That's why I am starving out on the bread line. :When springtime it comes, oh, won't we have fun; :We'll throw off our jobs, and go on the bum.

This version goes: ::I went to a house and I knocked on the door; ::The lady comes out and says, \\"You've been here before\\" ::She gives a loud whistle and I run for my life! ::Well, wouldn't you know, it's the constable's wife. :: Refrain: ::Hallelujah, I'm a bum, ::Hallelujah, bum again, ::Hallelujah, gimme a handout ::And you'll be my friend ::\\"Now, why don't you settle down and get yourself a wife?\\" ::\\"I'd rather be a BUM for the rest of me life!\\" ::\\"If you got a job, then you'd be my honey\\" ::\\"I wouldn't marry you if I had lots o' money!\\" :: Refrain ::\\" ::\\"And shing for my thupper when I'm down and out\\" In 1961, the Freedom Riders adapted the song, with these lyrics: ::Hallelujah, I'm a-travelin', ::Hallelujah, ain't it fine? ::Hallelujah, I'm a-travelin', ::Down freedom's main line.

It stars Al Jolson, who featured a song of the same title, but entirely different tune. Only the lyrics \\"Hallelujah, I'm a bum\\" are reused. The music was quoted in the Charlie Chaplin movie Modern Times (1936), when Charlie is released from the home for the bewildered and trudges along the street before picking up a red flag that has dropped off the back of a truck. To get the attention of the truck driver, Charlie starts waving the flag around, which causes a crowd of radical trade unionists to start marching behind him, believing that a revolution has begun. The sequence ends when Charlie, who has no idea the union members are following him, is arrested as a Communist agitator. The song is requested of Larry \\"Lonesome\\" Rhodes by a co- prisoner in an early scene of the Elia Kazan movie A Face in the Crowd (1957). The Porky Pig cartoon Confusions of a Nutzy Spy depicts a spy attempting to plant a bomb on which \\"Hallelujah, I'm a Bomb!\\" is written. It was used in an episode of television series Checkmate where Doug McClure investigates a hobo camp. In 2012, the rock band, Local H, released their seventh studio album, \\"Hallelujah! I'm a Bum\\". The 1928 recording of the song was featured in Bob Dylan's Thanksgiving \\"leftovers\\"-themed episode of his Theme Time Radio Hour program. The song was featured in Season 3 Episode 2 of HBO‚Äôs The Leftovers (TV Series). The song is referenced in \\"Beer for Breakfast\\" by The Replacements, on their 1997 album All for Nothing / Nothing for All.

The culture cultivated foxtail millet. Karuo type site The type site at Karuo was discovered in 1977 at Chamdo County, Chamdo Prefecture, Tibet and excavated from 1978 to 1979. Located at about above sea level, the site covered an area of 10,000 m¬≤. Over 7,000 artifacts have been discovered at Karuo, including 1,060 stone artifacts, 1,284 pottery shards and 4,755 bone objects. It is one of only a few archaeological sites on the Tibetan Plateau dating back so far, and it is in good enough condition for the foundations of houses to still be found, along with roads, walls, and stone altars in addition to the individual artifacts.Chinaculture.org Appearance-wise, the pottery at Karuo shows many similarities with pottery found at Majiayao sites, primarily the later phases, Machang and Banshan; however, the Karuo pottery was made using different methods and appears to be merely imitative. The tool assemblage at Karuo also shows similarities with those found at sites in western Sichuan. The remains of 34 houses were found at the site. During the earlier stages, the houses at Karuo were round and semi-subterranean. During the later stages, the houses at Karuo were rectangular and subterranean. The later houses were more solidly built and represents a shift to more permanent habitation at Karuo. Karuo is the site of the oldest permanent settlement in Tibet and represents the earliest evidence for agriculture on the Tibetan Plateau. Agriculturally, the people at Karuo relied primarily on foxtail millet, while some evidence for broomcorn millet was also discovered. The oldest evidence for foxtail millet at Karuo dates to around 3000 BC. The people of Karuo also supplemented their diet with hunting. The residents of Karuo suddenly abandoned the settlement around 1750 BC. This is likely due to a change in climate, as Karuo likely required optimal conditions (higher temperatures) for foxtail millet to be grown successfully; Karuo coincided with a period of warmer temperatures in the region, and a return to cooler temperatures likely made foxtail millet cultivation at the site untenable. Broomcorn millet requires even higher temperatures for cultivation, so the broomcorn millet found at Karuo must have been obtained from trade with lower elevation sites.

He later served as the executive vice president of operations at Michael Waltrip Racing, overseeing the day-to-day operations of the organization's three NASCAR Cup Series teams and one Nationwide Series team, until July 2011. Before partnering with Michael Waltrip Racing, Wells owned PPI (Precision Preparation, Inc.) Motorsports established in 1979, which became a top-performing NASCAR Cup organization from 2000 to 2006. As a Cup team owner, Wells visited Victory Lane twice with Ricky Craven behind the wheel of his PPI Motorsports entry. His multitude of drivers also earned him 10 top-five, 26 top-10 finishes and three pole awards during his tenure as an owner in the top-touring division.  PPI Motorsports  Wells founded PPI during 1979 in Westminster, Calif. At the time, Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. needed to promote their tough, reliable technology driven line of trucks through participation in Off-Road Championships, the Score Desert Series, including the Baja 500 and Baja 1000, and the Mickey Thompson Off-Road Championship Grand Prix (MTEG Stadium Series). Wells had already been successful in winning Off-Road races in the U.S. and Mexico and Toyota selected him to personally lead their foray into truck racing in the American market. With Off-Road legend Ivan \\"Ironman\\" Stewart, internationally successful brothers Steve and Rod Millen and Off Road, IndyCar and NASCAR winner Robby Gordon, PPI and Toyota won 88 races, 11 manufacturer championships including three Baja 1000s, 11 Baja 500s and five mint 400s. As Toyota's interests peaked to enter the esteemed Indy Car/CART World Series in the mid-90s, they looked to Wells and his PPI team to support their entrance into America's premier open wheel series. As a new manufacturer to the division, Toyota had to meet requirements and align with an existing CART franchised team before adding teams outside existing CART ownership. PPI helped overcome these challenges by leading to the acquisition of franchise rights through the formation of Arcerio/Wells Racing, a PPI-owned company. Wells organization led Toyota's efforts, along with Dan Gurney's All-American Racers towards establishing a competitive effort in Indy Car. In 1996, Wells helped established an engineering and supplier relationship with race car manufacturer Reynard. This relationship required creating a group solely responsible for the decision/adaptation of Toyota Power to a reasonably priced Reynard chassis. Wells led an international effort with Toyota Japan and Toyota U.S.A. to identify and recommend Reynard as the preferred partner and then establish a working team of over 100 members to support start up. Well's partnered and supported Toyota's evolution as an Indy Car engine supplier through six of seven complete engine designs, leading to their first pole position in 1999 and second win in 2000 under the PPI Motorsports' banner. These successes provided the foundation for TRD's expansion, management development and first open wheel championship under the ownership of Newman- Hass Racing and driven by PPI recruited and developed driver Cristiano da Matta. During 1997, Toyota needed to provide a platform for the development of drivers in future CART/Indy Car participation. PPI led efforts to recruit an Atlantic Team Management crew and funding for the driver development program, which resulted in a Toyota Atlantic Championship in 1999 followed by Rookie- of-the-Year honors in 2000. The fundamental philosophies of the program ultimately provided an opportunity for many great drivers including Indy 500 and championship winner Dan Wheldon. That same year, PPI began competing in the NSCS season with a different manufacturer and with support of a new sponsor in McDonald's. With a prominent sponsor like McDonald's on board, Wells soon attracted Procter and Gamble as they sponsored his car with their Tide brand. With less than two full seasons of NASCAR competition, Tide Racing scored the car owner his first NASCAR Cup win when Ricky Craven went to victory lane on October 15, 2001, at Martinsville Speedway. Next season, the team improved its final standings in the NASCAR Cup Series' owner points to 15th. Wells' second win as a NASCAR team owner occurred March 16, 2003, at Darlington Raceway. Craven won the Carolina Dodge Dealers 400 by inches in a spectacular side-by-side finish with Kurt Busch. The margin of victory (.002 seconds) was recognizably one of the closest finishes in NASCAR history.  Post-PPI  The 2005 season marked a monumental year for Wells as his organization celebrated its 25th anniversary in racing. After 28 years of ownership, the Pomona, California-native bid farewell to his role in a sport he is still most passionate about today. After the closing of PPI, Wells was sought out by Michael Waltrip Racing co-owner Rob Kauffman to continue working in racing via the business operations of MWR. After four seasons at MWR that included two NASCAR Cup wins with David Reutimann and a K&N; Pro Series East championship with Ryan Truex. On July 25, 2011, it was announced that Wells would leave Michael Waltrip Racing, where he had moved up to vice president and chief operating officer. Since moving on from MWR, Wells has focused on a consultancy role primarily in motorsports, amongst other fields. Under the banner of LNGA Consulting, Wells has worked with NASCAR teams such as Germain Racing, Furniture Row Racing, and JTG Daugherty Racing, assisted in the start- up business operations of Haas F1, and continued to work with Toyota Racing Development.

All New Zealand railcars are classified as RM (Rail Motor), and this class derived their nomenclature from the name of the manufacturer, the Vulcan Foundry of Britain.  Background  On 9 May 1938, the Minister of Railways announced an order for ten railcars from the Vulcan Foundry of Britain. Six railcars of the Standard type were under construction at the Hutt Workshops but delays in deliveries of materials and equipment from England meant it was impracticable to build more cars in New Zealand. The order for ten more railcars was therefore placed overseas. The first Vulcan railcar arrived in New Zealand in September 1940. Three more arrived by April 1941, with all nine members in operation by the second half of 1942. Ten railcars were built, but only nine arrived in New Zealand as the ship carrying the tenth was sunk during World War II. Description The Vulcan railcars had a driver's compartment at each end, so they did not need to be turned at the terminus for the return journey. They originally had 28 and 22 seats in the two passenger compartments. In the mid-1950s the smaller compartment in each vehicle was reduced by 2 seats and replaced with a small guard's compartment, thus reducing the total number of passengers from 50 to 48.A luggage compartment had space for about 1 ton of luggage, and an onboard toilet was provided. The original livery was plain Midland red with a grey roof and black undergear. From 1951 onwards, as they came in for overhauls, they were repainted Carnation red with silver or off- white stripes on the sides and ends, and silver or white roofs. They had a low axle loading to allow them to operate on the light track and bridges on the Stillwater‚ÄìWestport Line to provide a proposed new Greymouth‚ÄìWestport service, once the building of the line was completed. Hence the power bogie was built with three axles with an intermediate carrying axle (with flangeless wheels) instead of two axles as originally proposed. They were designed to operate at speeds of up to , though in service they were restricted to a maximum speed of , which was still fast for rural New Zealand railway lines at the time.  Speed records  On trials on 25 October 1940, RM 50 achieved a speed of on a section of the Midland Line east of Springfield. This remains the fastest speed officially attained on New Zealand's railway network.  Operation  Before all members of the class had arrived, from 28 October 1940 Vulcan and Midland railcars alternated the Christchurch‚ÄìGreymouth‚ÄìHokitika services along the Midland Line and the Ross Branch. A Vulcan railcar ran on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, and a smaller Midland railcar ran on the other days. By September 1942, the Vulcans had fully taken over the service and the Midland railcars were withdrawn and then scrapped. From 7 September 1942, wartime petrol restrictions meant the Vulcans were put into service on the Stillwater‚ÄìWestport Line between Greymouth and Westport (150 km or 93 miles), even though the line through the Buller Gorge technically wasn't finished and hadn't been handed over to the Railways Department from the Public Works Department. Early morning and mid-afternoon services were provided in each direction daily. With double running (two cars coupled together) this meant four vehicles could be required for these services, which connected with Christchurch‚ÄìGreymouth passenger express trains at Stillwater. Also due to the petrol restrictions, a service between Christchurch and Timaru was instituted and the Hokitika run extended all the way to Ross. After the war ended, the West Coast services continued to operate, but the Timaru run ceased. On 20 February 1956, the new articulated 88 seater railcars replaced the Vulcans on the Christchurch‚ÄìGreymouth‚ÄìRoss services. This allowed freed-up Vulcan railcars to provide daily Dunedin‚ÄìCromwell passenger services along the Otago Central Line (250 km or 155 miles) from 1 October 1956. From 11 May 1958, the services were cut back to Dunedin‚ÄìAlexandra (220 km or 136 miles) due to low passenger numbers beyond Alexandra. On 29 September 1958, a weekday morning service commenced using Vulcans on part of the Main South Line from Palmerston to Dunedin, and a return service run in the evening. The railcars were also used for Dunedin suburban services ‚Äì notably a midday service to Port Chalmers ‚Äì whenever they were available for such use. The Vulcan railcars were never used in the North Island, where the Standard railcars performed a similar role. Incidents The nine Vulcans saw a number of incidents and accidents during their operational lives. RM 53 was gutted by fire on 6 May 1947 while working a Greymouth‚ÄìChristchurch service, and RM 57 was gutted by fire on 29 June 1955 also while working a Greymouth‚ÄìChristchurch service. In both cases the vehicles were rebuilt at Addington workshops and returned to service three years after the fire. RM 53 hit a large rock on the Taieri Gorge run to Alexandra about 1972, and was repaired. RM 53 caught fire a second time on 11 January 1978 while working a Christchurch‚ÄìGreymouth service, and was written off after this. RM 50 (leading) and RM 58 (trailing) were working in multiple on a Ross‚ÄìChristchurch service on 23 April 1957 when they suffered motor failure, and then brake failure, while climbing the 1 in 33 grade up through the Otira Tunnel. The cars ran back to Otira out of control where they were diverted into the runaway siding at the Otira yard, where RM 58 derailed. There were no serious injuries. In April 1957, three derailments of Vulcans on the Otago Central Line led to the postponement of railcar services while the line was upgraded. Services did not resume until 10 November 1957. RM 58 was written off following a level crossing collision on 15 February 1971, in which the railcar driver was killed. RM 57 collided with the rear of a goods train in August 1974, and RM 52 was involved in a level crossing collision between Wairuna and Clinton in February 1976.  Withdrawal and preservation  By the end of the 1960s, road coaches could provide a similar service to the Vulcan and 88-seater railcars, at much lower cost. The 88-seater railcars were also being phased out, despite being newer, because their operating and engine renewal costs could not be justified. Greymouth‚ÄìWestport passenger services ceased in July 1967, allowing Vulcans to replace the 88-seater railcars on the Christchurch‚ÄìPicton (Main North Line) railcar service, except during summer holidays when short trains were substituted. This continued until 7 June 1976, when the Vulcans ran this service for the last time. A need to conserve the remaining life in 88-seater railcars for weekend services on the Christchurch‚ÄìGreymouth route meant that, from 1975, the Vulcans were used on some Invercargill‚ÄìDunedin‚ÄìChristchurch (Main South Line) services to supplement the 88-seater railcars. The use of Vulcans on the Otago Central Line, and between Christchurch and Invercargill, ceased in April 1976. The last use of a Vulcan was on the Greymouth‚ÄìChristchurch evening service on 9 September 1978, ending nearly 38 years of heavy use of Vulcans in the rural South Island. Four of the nine Vulcan railcars were preserved, one by The Plains Vintage Railway & Historical Museum (RM 50) and three by the Ferrymead Railway (RM 51, RM 56, RM 57). RM 50, RM 51 and RM 56 see regular use.

These dogs became known as the Treeing Feist; feist is a derivation of fist and is a term used in Southern America for a small fierce dog, treeing is after their hunting style of running game into trees and indicating to the hunter which tree. Both breeds are used to hunt small game, particularly squirrel and rodents, as well as raccoons, opossums, rabbits and flushing birds. In the 20th century these dogs became increasingly rare and in the early 1980s a group of devotees banded together to prevent their extinction.

Most of the Kalmanovitz Estate was left to create a charitable foundation for hospitals and universities. Biography Kalmanovitz was born to a Jewish family in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Poland. While Paul emigrated to Egypt at the end of the World War I, his father, mother, and brothers remained in Lodz. He later worked for Sir Edmund Henry Hynman Allenby. Kalmanowitz arrived in the United States in the 1926 by jumping a merchant marine shipForbes v155.n11 (May 22, 1995): pp46(2) and jumped from job to job, working for several notable people such as Franklin D. Roosevelt, William Randolph Hearst, and Louis B. Mayer (MGM). In 1945 Paul Kalmanovitz received a letter from his niece, Sonia Kalmanowicz, the daughter of his oldest brother Joseph Kalmanowicz, in this letter she informed Paul that his brother had died in Auschwitz in 1944 and that she and her brother Stanislas had survived Auschwitz. He immediately arranged to apply for a visa number for them to enter the United States, by 1946 Stanislas was granted a visa, Sonia by then had decided to remain in France. Stanislas departed from Le Havre in April 1946 in steerage on the SS Oregon, a ship of WWI vintage. When Paul entered the US he changed the spelling of the family name from Kalmanowicz to Kalmanovitz. When Stanilas arrived in New York he changed his name to Stanley Kalmanovitz. Paul was in New York to pick up his nephew and accompany him to his home in Tarzana, California. In 1950 Kalmanovitz acquired the Maier Brewing Company in Los Angeles, California thus entering the brewing industry. Maier Brewing, makers of Brew 102, struggled for a number of years, and in 1958 faced an effort to be purchased by the Falstaff Brewing Company. Kalmanovitz refused to be bought out, after being threatened by Falstaff to either sell or Falstaff would bury the Maier Brewery.Falstaff Beer History . Falstaff Beer History. Accessed September 1, 2006. Within a few years Kalmanovitz returned the Maier Brewery to profitability. Along with the brewery and numerous other investments, Kalmanovitz's net worth increased. In 1970 Kalmanovitz purchased Lucky Lager and merged it with Maier Brewing Company to form the General Brewing Company with S&P; Corporation as its parent. By 1974 Falstaff was in need of cash. Falstaff's purchase of the Ballantine brands in 1972 proved to be a mistake and stretched the company's finances. Falstaff sold Kalmanovitz its San Francisco brewery. The cash did not save Falstaff; in 1975 the company was again in trouble. Kalmanovitz offered to inject $20 million into Falstaff for 100,000 shares of preferred stock. On 28 April 1975, Paul Kalmanovitz gained controlling interest in Falstaff Brewing Company. Kalmanovitz more than quadrupled his brewery interests and became a major force on the American beer market. With the purchase of Falstaff, Kalmanovitz moved the Falstaff headquarters from St Louis, Missouri to San Francisco to combine it with General Brewing Company's headquarters. By June, more than 175 of Falstaff's corporate employees were laid off. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) opened an investigation of the Falstaff purchase, and found it provided shareholders with false and misleading information. Kalmanovitz was prohibited from committing further securities laws violations and Falstaff stock was barred from trading and removed from the New York Stock Exchange. Falstaff appealed all the way to the US Supreme Court and lost. Falstaff workers unhappy with the new direction of the company staged a company lockout, which Kalmanovitz and General Brewing called a strike. Eventually Falstaff production resumed. Kalmanovitz's plans to make a profit off Falstaff were not to turn the company around and reestablish its brand strength in the market, but rather to cut costs drastically. The biggest change was the advertising budget where Kalmanovitz eliminated all types of marketing. Falstaff's market share continued to slide, resulting in plants closing and employees out of work. Falstaff was profitable for the S&P; Corporation, but at a cost to works and the communities around the breweries. Kalmanovitz acquired an ailing brewery, fired the corporate personnel, reduced budgets, sold equipment, stopped plant maintenance, and eliminated product quality control. Kalmanovitz established a standard with Falstaff that was repeated as he purchased Stroh's, National Bohemian, Olympia, Pearl, and Pabst. Breweries were not Kalmanovitz's only interests; he was involved in helping Guide Dogs for the Blind and several other charitable organizations. Upon his death, Kalmanovitz's net worth was reputed to be in excess of $250 million. A sizable portion of his wealth was donated to numerous California hospitals. His estate also donated funds for the Paul and Lydia Kalmanovitz Library at the University of California, San Francisco, Kalmanovitz Hall at the University of San Francisco, and the Paul and Lydia Kalmanovitz Appellate Courtroom at the University of California, Davis School of Law (King Hall). Criticism Kalmanovitz specialized in leveraged buy- outs,http://rightinsanfrancisco.typepad.com/right_in_san_francisco/2012/01/assessing- bain.html which take over businesses to sell off their parts for profit, closing plants and laying off employees. After a takeover in St. Louis, brewery employees flew the American flag at half-staff and upside down. In 1975, after Kalmanovitz gained control of Falstaff, most of its 175 corporate office employees were laid off. Some of the employee's severance checks bounced. \\"Kalmanovitz thought nothing of throwing hundreds of brewery workers out onto the streets, cutting off their pension and health benefits ‚Ä¶ \\" according to one historian. Forbes magazine wrote that \\"Kalmanovitz went through Falstaff like Grant through Richmond. ... He took no prisoners.\\"http://qctimes.com/lifestyles/home-and-garden/falstaff-collector-s- dad-had--plus-years-of- service/article_0e255086-252e-11e2-b701-001a4bcf887a.html In a 1979 court case, Bloor v. Falstaff, Kalmanovitz's brewery was fined $1.3 million. The judges described his management style as \\"Profit Uber Alles\\". Personally, he has been described as mean-spirited, controlling and eccentric. He banned telephones from his office and every time he would catch his employees installing a line, he would rip it out. After his death, a former legal secretary said, his associates toasted him with Jack Daniel's, saying, \\"Ding dong the king is dead.\\" Paul Kalmanovitz's whose mother and brothers died in the ghetto of Lodz and the Auschwitz concentration camp denied he was Jewish until he died. In addition he told all of his associates that he had no family left alive, while to the contrary his nephew, Stanley Kalmanovitz, and his niece Sophie Kalmanovitz (who died in 2015), both of whom survived Auschwitz, were alive during his life.

The Royal Malaysian Armoured Corps have had its beginning with two army units formed by the British Administration headed by General Sir Gerald Templer who had initiated the formation during the Malayan Emergency. On 1 September 1952, the 1st Battalion Federation Regiment (Affiliated to Royal Irish Fusiliers) and the Federation Armoured Car Regiment (Affiliated to 13th/18th Royal Hussars (QMO) now known as The Light Dragoons) was also formed. Both regiments were the first multi-racial infantry and armoured units in Malaya. The Federation Regiment and The Federation Armoured Car Regiment were merged on 1 January 1960 to form the Federation Reconnaissance Corps. Units under the Corps on its formation were the 1st Regiment Federation Reconnaissance Corps and the 2nd Regiment Federation Reconnaissance Corps, better known as 1 Recce and 2 Recce respectively, and in Malay they were known as Rejimen Pertama Kor Peninjau Persekutuan (1 Peninjau) and Rejimen Kedua Kor Peninjau Persekutuan (2 Peninjau). Both units were equipped with scout cars namely the Ferret scout car, Daimler scout car and other British made armoured cars. Malayan Special Force in Congo Both 1 Recce and 2 Recce served with the Malayan Special Force (MSF) under UN Command in the Congo. For its sterling service, the Regiment was given its Royal colours on 23 March 1963. With the formation of Malaysia, the regiment once again was renamed the Malaysian Reconnaissance Regiment. The 3rd Reconnaissance Regiment was formed by merging the 1st Independent Reconnaissance Squadron with the ‚ÄúD‚Äù Squadrons from 1 Recce and 2 Recce. The regiment was bestowed the ‚ÄúRoyal‚Äù title on 20 May 1972, and thence called Royal Reconnaissance Regiment. With the re- alignment of its role and equipment, the regiment changed its name to Royal Cavalry Corps on 22 September 1979, and in 1986 was again renamed Royal Armoured Corps. Armoured Squadron (Para) A specialised Parachute Armoured Squadron was formed on 12 September 1992 to equip the newly establish Rapid Deployment Force (Pasukan Aturgerak Cepat) centred on 10th Brigade Paratroopers. Members of the parachute Armoured Squadron are jump qualified. This squadron is equipped with Alvis Scorpion 90 light tank armed with 90 mm gun. Armour Training Centre Armoured warfare training is undertaken at the Armour Training Centre at Sebatang Karah Camp in Port Dickson. Exchanges are made with friendly countries such as The United States, United Kingdom, Australia, France, India and Pakistan. Ceremonial Mounted Squadron The formation of the Ceremonial Mounted Squadron (Skuadron Istiadat Berkuda) added another milestone to the history of the Armoured Corps, the national tourism industry and the development of the national equestrian sports. The idea was mooted by then Prime Minister Dato' Seri Mahathir Mohamad. With the formation of this unit, it becomes the third uniformed organisation after the Royal Malaysian Police (PDRM) and Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL). The Ceremonial Mounted Squadron was officially launched on 13 May 1997 by the then Minister of Defence Dato' Syed Hamid Albar bin Syed Jaafar Albar. On this historical day, the mounted squadron was officially designated as Ceremonial Mounted Squadron, Royal Armoured Corps (SIB). The main camp is in Sungai Buloh, Selangor. With the formation of this unit, it is expected to play a significant roles in all national ceremonial functions involving His Majesty the King (SPB YDP Agong) during the opening of the Parliament Session, National Day Parade, Trooping of Colours and Heads of States visits. Presently, priorities is given to train the horsemen in horse riding and horse handling, parade formalities and to prepare them for the future roles as the mounted palace guards. The squadron's present strength is 6 officers including a veterinarian and 97 other ranks. The present strength will be increased in the near future in line with the present demand to perform the ceremonial duties at the Istana Negara. A year after the official launching of the unit, on 3 November 1998 the unit undertake its first task as a Mounted Static Guard at the main entrance of the Istana Negara. In the long term, the squadron will be expanded to a regiment which brings all the existing Regalia Group under one command and control. The existing Regalia Group comprises the following: * Dismounted Lancers Guard * Sovereign's Escort (Motorized) * Mounted Ceremonial Troop * Squadron Trumpeters * Central Band of the Royal Armoured Corps Generally the uniform worn by the horsemen has some similarity with the present dress of the Lancers Guard and the Sovereign Escort. The design of the dress is a continuity of the original ceremonial dress of the Reconnaissance Regiment worn during the formation of the Armoured Corps. The ceremonial jacket of the mounted unit is red in colour with black riding breeches with double gold braide on both sides of the breeches. The dress is specially design for the horsemen to perform duties on horseback armed with the Cavalry Sabre and ceremonial lances. The personnel of the squadron are carefully picked and must comply to the specific criteria laid by the Armoured Directorate. The horses purchased for the squadron is specially selected by the expect, the type and breed must be able to acclimatise the local weather conditions and able to perform specific ceremonial duties with ease. All technical requirement of the horses is clearly mentioned in the General Staff Requirement (GSR) produced by the unit. If motorized, squadron personnel only carry sabres or only use pistols. The first Officer Commanding of the unit was Major Ahmad Fakharuzi Hj Ibrahim (now a retired Lieutenant Colonel) and the first Squadron Sergeant Major is Warrant Officer 2 Manivanan Nadison. The Motto of the unit is : Cekal dan Unggul (Determined and Excellent) (Pervicax quod Praeclarus). The spirit of the squadron is: Ride to Serve and Proud To Be Above. UNPROFOR and SFOR Royal Armoured Corps units were a component of the Malaysian contingent under the UNPROFOR and SFOR missions in Bosnia, serving under UN Command and later NATO command. The 3rd Regiment Armour (3 Armor) serving as MALBATT I (Malaysian Battalion I) under UNPROFOR monitored the disarming of the opposing factions and enforcing the ceasefire in Bosnia in 1993.

The ballad tells of a merchant who defends himself from a thief. The story is similar to those of Robin Hood, except that the merchant does not join the band of thieves. Synopsis Jock the Leg and a merchant meet. As they come across a tavern- house, Jock tries to get him to pay his way. In the middle of the night, Then Jock wakes him and tells him they should be on their way. The merchant says he cannot go by Barnisdale or Coventry, fearing Jock will rob him. Jock says he will protect him, though he eventually tries to rob the merchant. The two fight until bloody, and Jock persuades him to let him blow his horn. This summons his 24 bowmen. The merchants challenges them. If six bowmen and Jock fight him and are able to get him one foot from his pack, he will give it to them. The merchant grabs the pack, wields a broadsword, and defeats all seven. Jock invites the merchant to have him join them. Refusing to join the \\"robber- band,\\" the merchant parts, promising to call Jock a thief if they ever meet again. Commentary This story matches many Robin Hood ballads, in which Robin meets and fights a stranger. Unlike Robin, Jock's summoning his men with his horn does not end the fray, and the stranger rejects his invitation.

Cleveland Circle station is handicapped accessible, with raised platforms to accommodate low-floor trams. History PCC streetcars at Cleveland Circle in 1951 The Beacon Street line opened in 1889; most streetcars ran through Cleveland Circle to Lake Street after 1896, with some terminating at the Chestnut Hill Carhouse (renamed Reservoir Carhouse around 1900). In 1915, the route was cut back to Reservoir, at the Reservoir Carhouse. Around 1947, the terminus was redesignated Cleveland Circle after the adjacent traffic circle, to differentiate it from the nearby commuter rail station ‚Äì which, twelve years later, would become a streetcar station itself. Although Cleveland Circle is no longer a traffic circle, the station retains its name. In the early 2000s, the MBTA modified key surface stops with raised platforms for accessibility. Portable lifts were installed at Cleveland Circle around 2000 as a temporary measure. The platform modifications - part of a $32 million modification of thirteen B, C, and E branch stations - were completed around 2003. On May 2, 2007, the MBTA added a wooden mini-high platform on the outbound side, allowing level deboarding from older Type 7 LRVs. These platforms were installed at eight Green Line stations in 2006‚Äì07 as part of the settlement of Joanne Daniels-Finegold, et al. v. MBTA.

(1957). The development of peatlands. Quarterly Review of Biology, 32, 145‚Äì66.Keddy, P.A. (2010). Wetland Ecology: Principles and Conservation (2nd edition). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. The blanketing of the ground with a variable depth of peat gives the habitat type its name. Blanket bogs are found extensively throughout the northern hemisphere - well-studied examples are found in Ireland and Great Britain, but vast areas of the Russian and North American tundra also qualify as blanket bogs. In Europe, the southernmost edge of range of this habitat has been recently mapped in the Cantabrian Mountains, northern Spain. In the southern hemisphere they are less well-developed due to the relatively low latitudes of the main land areas, though similar environments are reported in Patagonia,Arroyo, M.T.K., P. Mihoc, P.

The blanket bogs known as 'featherbeds' on subantarctic Macquarie Island occur on raised marine terraces; they may be up to 5 m deep, tremble or quake when walked on and can be hazardous to cross. It is doubtful whether the extremely impoverished flora of Antarctica is sufficiently well developed to be considered as blanket bogs. In some areas of Europe, the spread of blanket bogs is traced to deforestation by prehistoric cultures.Moore, P. D. (1973). The influence of prehistoric cultures upon the initiation and spread of blanket bog in upland Wales. Nature, 241, 350‚Äì353. Peat harvesting In many areas peat is used as a fossil fuel either in electricity generation or domestic solid fuel for heating. In the Republic of Ireland a state owned company, Bord na M√≥na, owns large areas of bog land and harvests peat for electricity generation but that peat is mainly from the raised bogs in the central plains. Bord na M√≥na used to burn peat in the peat fired generating station at Bellacorick but that closed down many years ago and the area now houses a large windfarm. Some blanket bogs are now preserved by government organisations in both Ireland and Great Britain, as this habitat is under threat from extensive harvesting.

The most important day is that of the j'ouvert (or juv√©), in which brass and steel bands perform for much of the island's population. Barbuda's Carnival, held in June, is known as Caribana. The Antiguan and Barbudan Carnivals replaced the Old Time Christmas Festival in 1957, with hopes of inspiring tourism in Antigua and Barbuda. Some elements of the Christmas Festival remain in the modern Carnival celebrations. It is a ten-day festival of colorful costumes, beauty pageants, talent shows, and especially good music. The festivities, which celebrate emancipation, range from the Party Monarch and Calypso Monarch competitions of Calypsonians, the Panorama steel band competition, and the spectacular Parade of Bands to the Miss Antigua Pageant and the Caribbean Queen's Competition. In addition to these major events, the nonstop revelry of this eleven-day carnival includes innumerable smaller festivities, including local concerts, food fairs, parades, and cultural shows. History of Carnival For the history of the festival you have to step back in time to 1 August 1834 when slavery was abolished. People immediately celebrated by taking to the streets to celebrate their freedom and express their joy and happiness. Over the years there was a return to this informal celebration until 1957 when the Old Time Christmas Festival, a festival of much culturally significance, was replaced in 1957 by Antigua's Carnival. The Antiguan Christmas Festival included several elements that have been adopted into the modern Carnival. Christmas Festival traditions include both music and dance, especially related to masquerades and iron bands. The highland fling is a common Christmas Festival dance, also played in the modern Carnival, performed by people wearing Scottish kilts, masks made of wire and bearing whips of cowhide. Dancers wearing banana leaves and animal horns took part in the John Bull, while carolers paraded with long poles covered in lanterns, called carol trees, singing with accompaniment by the concertina. Stilt dancers in robes, called the Moko Jumbie, Jumpa-Ben or Long Ghosts, were also common, and were accompanied by kettle and bass drums, fife, triangle (cling-a-ching) and the boompipe, made from a plumbing joint one meter long. There are several different musical forms featured during Carnival. Calypso, the oldest, has its roots in slavery; a common explanation of its origins is that it began as a way for slaves, who were forbidden to speak in the fields, to communicate with each other. It is a polyglot, improvisational form that depends largely upon the skill of a soloist, (the calypsonian) who weaves the sounds of many cultures into a lyrical whole. Calypso competitions have long been a highlight of Carnival. Steel drum music was created when the bamboo percussion instruments traditionally used to back up calypso were replaced by hammered steel pans cut from oil drums. Whereas there is no dispute that the steel pan was developed in Trinidad, the indigenous development of the steel band in Antigua and Barbuda was an outgrowth of the iron bands which were prominent at Christmas time. Steel drum music has been an important part of Carnival since that time, and Antigua is home to many of the Caribbean's finest steel bands. Soca is a musical form that grafts the slower beat of American soul music to the upbeat tempos of calypso. Soca began in the 1970s, and by the middle of the 1980s it had become an integral feature of Carnival. Parades and Mas'=Opening Parade and Ceremony Carnival Patrons on parade in Antigua Antigua's carnival officially kicks off with an opening parade through the city of St. John's. Bands and troupes come out in T-shirts bearing the insignia of their respective companies. Floats, which were big in the past, have begun to see a resurgence in their popularity. The participants of various competitions also make a strong appearance in the Opening parade. The typical parade route is usually like the following: The Parade will begin at 3:00 pm from Parliament Drive, and turn unto Queen Elizabeth Highway. From there it will turn right onto Independence Drive, left onto Redcliffe Street continue on until it turns onto Thames Street. From there it will move up High Street, back onto Independence Drive, around the round-about by government house and then finally into Carnival City through the north gate. The parade concludes at \\"Carnival City\\" (the official title given to the Antigua Recreation Ground during the carnival season). There the opening ceremony follows and the contestants for the various carnival competitions make a final public appearance before their shows. The opening ceremony usually finishes with fireworks. Children's Carnival The Children's Carnival parade is set aside so that the children may really enjoy the carnival festivities to the fullest. They march through the streets as well and finish the parade at Carnival City. The children come out in their costumes and portray different themes, taken from fairy tales etc. Cheerleading has also permeated into Antigua's carnival. At Carnival City the children enter the Prince and Princess competitions. Here each mas troupe enters a boy and girl who wear a costume in the hopes of winning the prince and princess competition. They are having their own fun. J'ouvert Like j'ouvert all over the world, Antigua's is characterized by much revelry. Patrons wake up early at around 3 or 4 am and go into St. John's where they find their favorite bands and \\"jam\\" with them along the route. There is much drinking, more jamming, painting of the bodies with blue and brown paint, and people who wear colourful costumes. Carnival Monday and Tuesday Antigua's carnival festivities conclude on the first Monday and Tuesday in August, dubbed Carnival Monday and Tuesday, official holidays. After J'ouvert Morning on Monday morning revelers come back into St. Johns in the afternoon to march through St. John's. The troupes, bands and floats all return the very next afternoon to do it again but on a different route. This is dubbed Carnival Tuesday. The parade culminates at Carnival City where the different troupes are awarded prizes and the Road March king is decided upon.

The teens come up against each other in four segments: * Personality and Aspiration * Performing Talent * Research * Question and Answer Queen of Carnival The Queen of Carnival show is the most prestigious and coveted pageant title in Antigua and Barbuda. Beautiful young ladies from all over the island take part in the competition that has propelled many into the public eye. Many doors can be opened for the winner of such a \\"Queen Show\\".

The show sees competitors from across the Caribbean region compete for the coveted Jaycess crown. Territories such as, Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, British Virgin Islands, Dominica, Guyana, Jamaica, Nevis, St. Kitts, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, St. Croix, and Trinidad and Tobago enter every year. Antigua's representative is always the winner of the Antigua Queen of Carnival Competition just days before. Notable former Jaycees Queens have been Kai Davis, Jermilla Kirwan, Shelana George, Shermain Jeremy (all four of Antigua) and Princess Best (of Barbados). Calypso and Soca=Junior Calypso The Junior Calypso competition seeks to keep the Calypso art form alive in the nation's children. The competition is divided into two segments, the 5 to 12 category and the 13 to 19 category. Each child sings one calypso and is judged on criteria that include performance, lyrics, clarity, content and use of stage. Many of the Junior Calypso winners have gone on to compete in the Calypso Monarch Competition. Notable winners are: * Lyrics Man * Thalia King * Lady Challenger * Young Destroyer *A'Shante (A'Shante O'Keiffe) Party Monarch The most well attended show for the Carnival season, Party Monarch, attracted over 11 thousand patrons in 2007 and approximately nine thousand in 2008. The competition is divided into two segments the Groovy and the Up- tempo. Ten competitors per segment compete for the title of Party Monarch. The Party Monarch sees many people of all ages come to listen to the local talent. The competitors sing Soca songs. The Party Monarch competitions are also the fastest growing competitions and the artist are really developing. Some pundits are also expressing the view that Antigua's Soca is swiftly surpassing that of Trinidad. The most notable winners of the Party Monarch competition are: * Claudette \\"CP\\" Peters (winning four times) * Mervyn \\"Sleepy\\" Edwards (three times) * Toriano \\"Onyan\\" Edwards of the Burning Flames Panorama Steel Pan and Steel Orchestras are a big deal in Antigua with several pan yards around the island.

Unofficial Carnival events During the Carnival season in Antigua there are many events that take place that are not planned by the official carnival organizing body (Carnival Development Committee). These, while not official, are a very important part of the carnival season for patrons. Pre carnival events such Blue Jeans, White Fete and Red Eye are very popular parties that usually take place over the weekends of July leading up to carnival. \\"Lions Den\\" hosted by the Lions Club Antigua is the quintessential carnival \\"jam\\". It is executed in the form of a big rave and draws crowds of thousands. Two of Antigua's biggest bands, the Burning Flames and the Red Hot Flames perform.

The film was written and directed by Robert Towne. Tom Cruise (with Paula Wagner and Cruise/Wagner Productions) served as one of the film's producers. The film was released on a limited basis on March 17, 2006, and was entered into the 28th Moscow International Film Festival. It was filmed almost entirely in South Africa with the use of stages to portray Los Angeles. Plot The story is set during the Great Depression, specifically around the time of the 1933 Long Beach earthquake. Camilla (Salma Hayek) is a fiery, beautiful Mexican caf√© waitress who aspires one day to be above her current standing in society, to make something of herself, to give her and her future children a place and chance in the world. Arturo (Colin Farrell) is a struggling writer who comes to Los Angeles's Bunker Hill area to start his writing career. Though he falls in love with Camilla, he does not marry her. Later, Camilla is infected by tuberculosis and leaves Arturo without informing him. When Arturo finds her, she is about to die and he promises to marry her, but Camilla dies and Arturo writes a novel dedicated to Camilla. Arturo writes a dedication in one of his books to her and throws it into the sand. CastProduction Part of the film was shot at Pinelands High School (Cape Town, South Africa), on fields modified to simulate a Los Angeles scenery. Film delays The rights to the novel once belonged to Mel Brooks, though he let them lapse. Towne met Fante in the 1970s. This meeting led to his interest in the project. Despite finishing the script in the early 1990s, he couldn't find financial backing from a studio. During this time, Farrell's role was originally set to be played by Johnny Depp but he dropped out. Later Val Kilmer accepted the role and also dropped out. Another delay was Hayek initially rejecting the role to avoid being typecast as a Mexican immigrant. She accepted the role after eight years. Critical reception The film received negative to mixed reviews from critics. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 35% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 104 reviews. Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 58 out of 100, based on 33 reviews.

Initially published by a small press in 2001, it has since achieved significant underground success and won Independent Publisher's Best Visionary Fiction Award. It was re-released by Harcourt / Harvest Books in April 2007, and has since been translated into seven languages. Satirical and philosophical in tone, its tag line is \\"You are invited to the party at the end of time.\\" Explanation of the novel's title The title Just a Couple of Days comes from a piece of graffiti which appeared on both sides of an overpass just outside Athens, Ohio on U.S. Route 33 and remained there for over two years. The open-ended tone of the declaration is related to the plot of the book, and the way the words can mean different things to each person who sees them. Plot summary Dr. Flake Fountain is approached by the military to develop an antidote to a virus they have created, which is known as the \\"Pied Piper\\" virus, due to its relation to a mirth- and dance-inducing virus which supposedly caused the phenomenon the Pied Piper story was based on (see also St. John's Dance), which leaves its victims alive and unharmed, but destroys the brain's capacity for symbolic reasoning. This leaves victims unable to use language, including speech and writing to communicate. However, before Dr. Fountain can complete his antidote, the virus is released and everyone else on Earth, as far as he knows, is infected with it. He holes up in the house of his friends Blip (a fellow college professor) and Sophia, two organic hippie types. Since the house is a self-sufficient geodesic dome, he is protected from the virus and has electricity, and it is revealed that the book is his journal, where he is recording everything that has happened and is happening. Each chapter also begins with a selection from the \\"Book o' Billets-Doux\\" (\\"love letters\\" in French), which he found in the dome and is apparently an extended conversation between Blip and Sophia which they wrote, eventually while succumbing to the virus. In time Flake discovers that the people \\"afflicted\\" with the virus can apparently communicate, and he surmises that they connect on a deeper level without the hindrance of a language and its capacity to obscure the truth. They work together and seem happy, even Edenic. Because of this, once he has finished the book, he exposes himself to the virus, becoming unable to continue it and leaving the reader to wonder exactly what happened to him. Characters in Just a Couple of Days Dr. Flake Fountain: The primary protagonist, a somewhat neurotic molecular geneticist. Flake admires his eccentric friend Blip and his happiness with his free- spirited wife Sophia, who Dr. Fountain has a crush on. Though initially seduced by money, Flake is ultimately reluctant to participate in the military project he ends up with and is consequently coerced into it. Blip and Sophia: The happily married hippie friends of Flake's, and parents of a daughter named Dandelion (Dandy). They were both infected with the Pied Piper virus (Blip to compel Flake to continue his research, Sophia accidentally) and finished writing the Book o' Billets-Doux while losing their capacity for language to the disease. This results in extended passages of impressive wordplay. General Kiljoy: The sadistic military general who recruits Flake and then forces him to continue his research.

As an actively practising evangelical Christian, Wright helped to found United Beach Missions, an organization whose goal was to preach the Christian gospel message to holidaymakers in Llandudno. The organization, under his leadership, grew to over 3000 people, ministering on the beaches of Britain, France and Belgium. Wright was also named as Chairman for the youth outreach organization Young Life. Throughout his ministry work, Wright focused on the \\"grass roots\\" approach, which particularly appealed to his young audience. After gaining his MD degree from Liverpool, Wright lectured at the University of Leeds for two years before becoming a research fellow at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. In 1964 he returned to Leeds as a Consultant Physician and Senior Lecturer, where he helped establish a specialist rheumatology unit. In 1970 he was appointed Professor of Rheumatology in the Department of Medicine at Leeds, a post he held until his retirement in 1994.University of Leeds, Reporter 414, 9 February 1998, Obituary His research was characterized by a multidisciplinary approach, including engineering and pharmacology. He was partly responsible for establishing the field of rehabilitation medicine as a speciality in its own right. Wright accurately predicted genetic links between different forms of arthritis prior to the development of laboratory tests which would later prove him correct. Wright was a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians (FRCP) and served as chairman of the Arthritis and Rheumatism Council, was a co-director of the Bioengineering Group for the study of Human Joints and President of the Creation Science Movement in England.

A member of the Conservative Party, he was a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State serving jointly between the Scotland Office and Northern Ireland Office under Prime Minister Boris Johnson from 2019 to 2020. Walker has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for Worcester since 2010. He identifies as a one-nation Conservative. Education Robin Caspar Walker was educated at St Paul's School, an independent school for boys in Barnes in West London, followed by a scholarship at Balliol College, Oxford, where he read Ancient and Modern History. His father was Lord Walker of Worcester, who was the MP for Worcester from 1961 to 1992. Career After leaving University, Walker set up his own internet business, before pursuing a career in the City of London with the financial communications company Finsbury. Walker has campaigned in three elections, working for Secretary of State for Health Stephen Dorrell in 1997, for Richard Adams, the Conservative Candidate for Worcester in 2001, and as press officer for Oliver Letwin, then Shadow Chancellor, in 2005. In the 2010 General Election, he defeated incumbent MP Mike Foster to win the Worcester seat, eighteen years after his father retired as a member of parliament for the same constituency (with revised boundaries) and joined the House of Lords. Parliamentary career Walker was selected to contest the Worcester constituency in August 2006, in which he was elected in 2010, and then was re elected in the 2015 General Election, defeating Labour challenger Joy Squires. Since being elected Member of Parliament for Worcester, Walker has campaigned for jobs for local people in Worcester, more and better apprenticeships, fairer funding in education, cutting fuel duty as well as a referendum on the European Union. Walker was elected to the Business Innovation and Skills Committee in 2012, focusing on apprenticeships, SME (small and medium-sized enterprises) policy and business rates reform to improve opportunities for young people and businesses. He was made Parliamentary Private Secretary to Elizabeth Truss, the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, in September 2014. Walker was one of a small group of Conservative MPs who rebelled from the party line and voted in favour of an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union. He ultimately supported the government's plan to hold a referendum by 2017, and voted against a rebel amendment to hold the referendum in 2014. Walker has campaigned for fairer funding in education as a member of the cross party F40 campaign, which in 2014 secured an extra ¬£350 million for lower funded areas ‚Äì ¬£5 million of which is earmarked for Worcestershire. Walker was made the Chairman of the All Party Group for Credit Unions in October 2014. Walker has supported a number of cross party initiatives on making credit unions available in post offices as well as helping them to compete with larger lenders. He had also received the Citizens Advice Parliamentarian of the Year Award earlier in the year, in recognition for his campaign for better regulation of pay day lenders.

In October 2016, Walker formally debated a petition calling for the observance of a British Independence Day in the United Kingdom. Arguing against, he said that \\"tempting though that might be, I think the idea of an independence day would face fierce competition from the likes of St George's Day, Trafalgar Day and many more.\\" Personal life Walker is a long-term supporter of both Worcester RFC \\"The Worcester Warriors\\" and the Worcestershire County Cricket Club. He wore the Worcestershire CCC tie whilst delivering his maiden parliamentary speech in the House of Commons.

She hangs a cloth in front of the well and invites him home, with directions to bring money. Then, she declares that her father is coming and tells him to hide behind the cloth. He falls in. When he pleads for help, she tells him that if he can get her out of hell, he can whistle himself out of the well.

Overview The guitar has an alder body, two-tone sunburst finish, a maple neck, skunk-stripe routing and black dot inlays. It was manufactured in 1956 and the serial number is 12073. Clapton purchased the guitar at London's Sound City while touring with Cream on 7 May 1967 for US$400 and used it for both concert and studio. The guitar appeared on his debut album Eric Clapton where it can be seen on the cover. Its most noteworthy usage can be heard on the Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs album also recorded in 1970. But after 1971, Brownie served as back-up for Clapton's main Fender Stratocaster, Blackie. At the 1969 Blind Faith concert in Hyde Park, London, Clapton played a Fender Custom Telecaster, which was fitted with Brownie's neck. Clapton preferred to buy a neck with a worn fretboard rather than a new one as he felt that a neck worn from playing had obviously been favoured by players, and was likely to play very well. Brownie for auction On 24 June 1999 Clapton sold the guitar through Christie's Auction House in New York City to help raise funds for his alcohol and drug treatment center, Crossroads Centre. Brownie sold for US$497,500 becoming the most expensive guitar ever sold at the time only to be eclipsed by Clapton's other favourite guitar Blackie on 24 June 2004. Brownie can now be seen by the public at the Experience Music Project in Seattle, Washington under the ownership of Paul Allen. In 2006, another Stratocaster, signed by a large group of celebrities, including Clapton, was auctioned to benefit the victims of the 2004 Asian tsunami, selling for US$2.6 million, shattering Brownie's record.

The group is heavily influenced by The Sisters of Mercy, Black Sabbath, and Fields of the Nephilim, and in sound are similar to the styles of Charon, Tiamat, Moonspell, and Type O Negative. The band's current and former line-up has consisted of many musicians from progenital Gothenburg melodic death metal bands; Kristian W√•hlin, Johan Osterberg, and Alf Svensson were in Grotesque (a predecessor of At the Gates, who Alf would eventually join); and Daniel Svensson briefly played drums with the group before going on to major success with In Flames.

However, Hans Nilsson's full-time involvement with Dimension Zero and W√•hlin's extensive contributions as an album cover artist and musician for other Scandinavian-area extreme metal bands may be attributable to the long period of no activity. In its official website, though, it is stated that: \\"After the mixing of \\"The Green Goddess\\" was done in November of 1999 the band immediately started writing new songs. Due to the huge amount of material being written the band decided the right thing would be to record two albums. In June 2000 the band hit the studio again to record 22 songs. This project dragged for some time and after a couple of weeks of recording during the summer and autumn of 2000 the rest of the work was postponed to 2001.

In such strategies, stocks are sold at the start of May and the proceeds held in cash (e.g. a money market fund); stocks are bought again in the autumn, typically around Halloween. \\"Sell in May\\" can be characterised as the belief that it is better to avoid holding stock during the summer period. Though this seasonality is often mentioned informally, it has largely been ignored in academic circles. Analysis by Bouman and Jacobsen (2002) shows that the effect has indeed occurred in 36 out of 37 countries examined, and since the 17th century (1694) in the United Kingdom; it is strongest in Europe. Causes Data show that stock market returns in many countries during the May‚ÄìOctober period are systematically negative or lower than the short-term interest rate. This appears to invalidate the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH), which predicts that any such returns (e.g., from shorting the market) would be bid away by those who accept the phenomenon. Alternative causes include small sample size or time variation in expected stock market returns. EMH predicts that stock market returns should not be predictably lower than the short-term interest rate (risk free rate). Popular media consider this phenomenon each May, generally rejecting it. However, the effect has been strongly present in most developed markets (including the United States, Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom and most European countries). Academic response Maberly and Pierce extended the data to April 2003 and tested the strategy for April 1982 through April 2003 except for two months, October 1987 and August 1998 (when markets crashed). They found that it did not work well in the time period April 1982-September 1987, November 1987-July 1998 or September 1998-April 2003. Other regression models using the same data but controlling for extreme outliers found the effect to be significant.Witte, H. Douglas. \\"Outliers and the Halloween Effect\\". Econ Journal Watch 7(1): 91-98. A follow-up study by Andrade, Chhaochharia and Fuerst (2012) found that the seasonal pattern persisted. In the 1998‚Äì2012 sample on average November‚ÄìApril they found that returns are larger than May‚ÄìOctober returns in all 37 markets they studied. On average, the difference is equal to about 10 percentage points. The magnitude of the difference is the same in both studies.

The original name Gits'ilaas√º means \\"people of the canyon.\\" The tribe is situated at Kitselas, British Columbia, at the upper end of Kitselas Canyon, which is on the Skeena River. It was once a great trading nexus, just outside and upriver from the city of Terrace. It is the most upriver of the 14 tribes and it borders the territory of the Gitxsan nation. Location Today, the Kitselas people live mostly at two Indian reserves, one, at the Kulspai or Queensway reserve (\\"New Town\\"), is just across the river from Terrace. More recently, Kitselas people have begun to repopulate a more traditional and remote site on a bluff overlooking the Canyon, at Gitaus reserve (Git'aws meaning \\"people of the sand\\"). Gitaus is gradually becoming the centre of Kitselas life. From the 1870s until the 1960s, many Kitselas and Kitsumkalum Tsimshians lived at the cannery town of Port Essington, farther down the Skeena River (now a ghost town), at the confluence of the Ecstall and Skeena Rivers. Governance  Until its dissolution in 2005, the Tsimshian Tribal Council represented Kitselas in treaty negotiations with the provincial and federal governments. Its band government is the Kitselas First Nation.

In 1996, the plant was purchased by Lockheed Martin and shut down. Lockheed Martin officials determined that the site was causing water and soil pollution, which was reported to state officials in 2000.

He was born at Secadura de Trasmiera.Leon, P., 1998, The Discovery and Conquest of Peru, Chronicles of the New World Encounter, edited and translated by Cook and Cook, Durham: Duke University Press, After a period in Mexico under the orders of Hern√°n Cort√©s, he joined the campaign of Francisco Pizarro. He went to Peru with his uncle Pedro de Alvarado in search of gold in 1534. There he fought against the armies of Manco Inca Yupanqui that were besieging Lima in 1536, against Diego de Almagro in 1537 and at the Battle of Las Salinas in 1538. He later fought at Chupas and Jaquijahuana. While charged by some contemporaries with avarice and cruelty, it is undeniable that during the period of civil wars in Peru (about 1537 to 1555) Alvarado was an unflinching and determined adherent to the interests of the Spanish crown. He always sided with those whom he thought to be sincere representatives of the crown, and it was not always profitable and safe to be on that side. Thus in 1537, he commanded the troops of Pizarro's followers, when Diego de Almagro claimed the mythical Inca city of Cuzco. He was defeated and captured by the latter at the Battle of Abancay.Prescott, W.H., 2011, The History of the Conquest of Peru, Digireads.com Publishing, Effecting his escape under great difficulties as well as dangers, and rejoining Pizarro, whom he looked upon as the legitimate governor of Peru, he took part in all the bloody troubles that followed, always as a prominent military leader and always unsuccessful when in immediate command. Still, he was counted upon as a mainstay of the Spanish cause, and occupied a high military position. Alvarado married in Spain while on a short visit, in 1544. When Francisco Hern√°ndez Gir√≥n initiated a rebellion in 1553, Alvarado was put in command of the forces to oppose him. At Chuquinga, in 1554, Alvarado suffered a signal defeat at the hands of the insurgents. Overcome by melancholy in consequence of that last disaster, he pined away and died in 1559. His principal achievement was the pacification of Chachapoyas in northeastern Peru, in the years 1535 and 1536, this being the first step taken from Peru towards the Amazonian basin. Search for El Dorado Alonso de Alvarado was the precursor of the expeditions that penetrated the Amazon Basin: he departed from Trujillo, Peru and, crossing the Andes, came in 1535 to the land of the Chachapoyas, where a few years later the city that today is the capital of the department of Amazonas was founded. The account of the chronicler Pedro Cieza of Le√≥n mentions the first foundation of the city of Chachapoyas: > On the fifth of September in the year of the Lord one thousand five hundred > and thirty eight Ihsu Christo, with sixty Spaniards under the control of > captain Alonso de Alvarado arrived in [...] \\" Xalca \\" and made the first > foundation of Chachapoyas. Also present at the foundation was Captain Luis Valera, father of the Cachapoyana Jesuit Blas Valera, of whose chronicles the Inca Garcilaso de la Vega nourished for the description of the Tawantinsuyo in his \\"Real Comments of the Incas\\". In Chachapoyas, Alvarado had knowledge of the fabulous treasures that a legendary city was keeping in the thickness of the forest, the mythical \\"El Dorado\\" and from there he organized new expeditions along the Mara√±√≥n River, founding also the city of Moyobamba in 1540.  Civil Wars in Peru  Alvarado also took part in the civil wars that faced Diego de Almagro and Francisco Pizarro. He was made a prisoner by Almagro in 1537 but he managed to escape. Later with the followers of Pizarro and in support of his allegiance to the king, Alvarado defeated the followers of Almagro in the Battle of Las Salinas in 1538. On the order of Francisco Pizarro, he looked in 1539 for the ideal place for the foundation of a city halfway between Lima and Cusco. Thus, along with Francisco de C√°rdenas, he took part in the foundation of Huamanga. Avenging the death of his father, Diego de Almagro II, \\"El Mozo\\" (The Lad), killed Francisco Pizarro in 1541. In the following year, the governor Crist√≥bal Vaca de Castro, allied to the Alonso de Alvarado, defeated \\"El Mozo\\" in the battle of Chupas. The loyalty and the merits of Alvarado were honored by Carlos I of Spain who he named a member of the Order of Santiago and Marshall of Peru, when he returned to Spain and married. Alvarado returned to Peru in 1546. In April 1548, Alvarado had to prove again the allegiance to the Crown fighting against the rebellious younger brother of Pizarro, Gonzalo. Under the control of Pedro de la Gasca, he ensured victory in the battle of Jaquijahuana, but this victory did not calm the many discontented Spanish settlers opposed to the increasing control of the envoys of the Spanish court. In 1553, as captain-general and chief justice in La Plata and Potos√≠, he put down a rebellion by Sebastian de Castilla. In 1554, Alvarado confronted the rebel forces led by Francisco Hern√°ndez Gir√≥n and was defeated in the Battle of Chuquinga. Alvarado died in Lima in 1555. Chachapoyas was, from his foundation, a city - port of that numerous expeditions that left for the forest. The legend of \\"El Dorado\\" inspired the thirst for wealth of the first Spanish explorers. Although the enthusiasm for the tasty reward was commanding his sleep, his companies met frustadas for unsuspected enemies: the famine, the illnesses, the Indians and the forest itself. \\"El Dorado\\" described from the imaginary one of the conqueror, is a city which streets and temples are covered of gold and he keeps, in his constructions and squares, made pieces of massive gold. Sometimes he was looked to the north, from Chachapoyas; others, from Quillabamba; in other occasions, some more recent explorers located his track (that later they \\"lost\\") in the central forest and inclusive in Colombia. Nevertheless, this golden legend opened the doors for the initial colonization and evangelization of some of the most extensive and remote regions of South America.

He was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury and Chief Whip in 1924, when he was made a Privy Councillor. He had suffered from poor health since contracting malaria at Salonika during World War I. On a visit to London in December 1928, he was found dead in bed at the Regent Palace Hotel. At the inquest, his son said that his father had taken to drinking heavily. His death, it was decided, was due to syncope from disease of the heart and liver, due to chronic alcoholism.

It is part of the City of Newcastle local government area.  History  The Aboriginal people, in this area, the Awabakal, were the first people of this land. Adamstown offically became a suburb in 1885 and the first council was elected in 1886 with the council chambers being completed in 1892. In 1938 Adamstown merged into other local council areas to become the areas of Greater Newcastle. The Adamstown railway station opened in 1887 with the Newcastle‚ÄìGosford section of the Main North line. The now closed branch line to Belmont formerly left the main line just south of Adamstown Station. The town also includes the beginning of the Fernleigh Track, a multi-use rail trail near Belmont. The project is a joint venture between Newcastle City Council and Lake Macquarie City Council and extends from Adamstown to Belmont over an approximate distance of 15.5 km (10 mi). Population According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 6,044 people in Adamstown. * Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 2.7% of the population. * 85.5% of people were born in Australia. The next most common country of birth was England at 2.1%. * 89.5% of people only spoke English at home. * The most common responses for religion were No Religion 33.8%, Catholic 26.7% and Anglican 15.7%. Education A number of schools are located in the suburb: * St Pius X High School (Years 7-10), first established in 1957 and became co-educational in 1983, absorbing the campus of St Anne's College, a girls' school established in 1966. Students transfer in year 11 to St Francis Xavier's College, Hamilton. In 2007, the school had an enrolment of 1,010 and a staff of 97. * Adamstown Primary School and St Columba's Primary School are also located within the suburb's boundaries. Community support Adamstown has a range of community support organisations. These include St Columbas Catholic Church and the Returned Serviceman's League sub-branch that is part of the Adamstown Community Club. The Adamstown Rosebud Football club is arguably the most famous club in Northern NSW Football, having produced 16 Socceroos including Ray Baartz and Col Curran among others. The club is also one of the oldest football clubs in Australia, having formed in 1889. The club still plays out of Adamstown Oval, the original home ground from the club's inaugural season.

It is located on Port Simpson Indian Reserve No. 1,BC Names/GeoBC entry \\"Port Simpson 1 (Indian reserve)\\" which is shared with other residential communities of the Tsimshian Nation. The Nine Allied Tribes are: Giluts'aaw, Ginadoiks, Ginaxangiik, Gispaxlo'ots, Gitando, Gitlaan, Gits'iis, Gitwilgyoots, and Gitzax≈Çaa≈Ç.  History  Fort Simpson in 1857 Old Hudson's Bay Co. trading post, early 1900s Lax-Kw'alaams derives from Lax≈Çgu'alaams, also formerly spelled Lach Goo Alams, which means \\"place of the wild roses,\\"BC Names entry \\"Lax Kwa'alaams (community)\\" It is an ancient camping spot of the Gispaxlo'ots tribe. In 1834 the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) set up a trading post there called Fort Simpson, then Port Simpson. The facility was named after Capt. Aemilius Simpson, superintendent of the HBC's Marine Department, who in 1830 had established the first, short-lived, Fort Simpson, on the nearby Nass River with Peter Skene Ogden. The HBC set up Fort Simpson in order to undermine American dominance of the Maritime Fur Trade along the Pacific Coast. The first HBC factor at the new Fort Simpson was Dr. John Frederick Kennedy. He married the daughter of chief Ligeex of the Gispaxlo'ots, as part of the diplomacy which established the fort on Gispaxlo'ots territory. Kennedy served at Fort Simpson until 1856. In 1857 an Anglican lay missionary named William Duncan brought Christianity to Lax Kw'alaams. But, feeling that the dissipated fort atmosphere was bad for the souls of his Tsimshian followers, he relocated with more than 800 of his flock to Metlakatla, at Metlakatla Pass just to the south. They later moved to Annette Island, Alaska, where he gained authority from the US Congress for an Indian reservation. Lax Kw'alaams was without missionaries until 1874, when Rev. Thomas Crosby of the Methodist church arrived. The community is still predominantly Methodist (i.e. United Church of Canada). Crosby's wife, Emma Crosby, founded the Methodist-affiliated Crosby Girls' Home in the community in the 1880s. It became part of B.C.'s Indian residential school system in 1893 and operated until 1948. In 1931 the Native Brotherhood of British Columbia was founded in Port Simpson as the province's first Native-run rights organization. Its four founders included the Tsimshian ethnologist William Beynon and hereditary Chief William Jeffrey. Duncan estimated the population of Lax Kw'alaams in 1857 as 2,300, living in 140 houses. Approximately 500 died in a smallpox epidemic shortly after Duncan's departure. Today Lax Kw'alaams is the largest of the seven Tsimshian village communities in Canada. Its population in 1983 was 882. As of 2009 the Lax- kw'alaams First Nation has 3,219 members. In 2011, there were 678 individuals living on the reserve. There are about 10,000 Tsimshian in British Columbia; they are the most numerous indigenous people in the province. The legal and political interests of the people of Lax Kw'alaams vis √† vis the provincial and federal governments are represented by the Allied Tsimshian Tribes Association, which represents the hereditary chiefs of the Nine Tribes. The Tsimshian have a matrilineal kinship system, with property and descent passed through the maternal lines. Hereditary chiefs come from the maternal lines. In November 2016, a study published in Nature Communications linked the genome of 25 Indigenous people who inhabited modern-day Prince Rupert, British Columbia 1000 to 6000 years ago with their descendants in the Lax-Kw'alaams community. Until it was renamed, Port Simpson was named for Captain Aemilius Simpson a distant relative of Sir George Simpson.

It was founded by the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools (known as The Lasallian Brothers) on 15 November 1964. The University was recognized as such through decree No 1583 of 11 August 1975 issued by the National Government. Today the University offers 21 academic degree programs in different areas of knowledge of which 5 are education programs- 16 specialization programs- of which three are education- and 5 master's degrees. Currently it has 13,521 matriculated students in degree programs and 462 students in postgraduate programs who are taught by 1,014 teachers, of which 87% have postgraduate degrees and 739 have management and service degrees. Since its foundation, the University has taken special care in the quality and efficiency of its education that has given it prestige nationally and internationally. The University has an educational philosophy inspired by the Catholic educational model of the Lasallian brothers, whose organization is currently present in more than 80 countries around the globe (Africa 22; America 22; Asia 15; Europe 18 and Australia/Oceania 3) and a history of more than 320 years serving as educators to youth. The University is part of the AIUL (Asociacion Internacional de Universidades Lasallistas- Spanish for International Association of Lasallian Universities), created in 1998. La Salle University Candelaria The La Salle University is a member of the Asociacion Colombiana de Universidades (Colombian Association of Universities), ASCUN, the Ascociacion Colombiana para el avance de la ciencia (Colombian Association for the advancement of science) ACAC, the FIUC (International Federation of Catholic Universities), the ODUCAL (Interamerican Universities Organization), the International Association of Lasallian Universities IALU, the COLUMBUS program, among others. Locations The University of La Salle has three campuses located in the city of Bogot√° and one more in Yopal (Casanare) with an approximate area of . La Salle University ‚Äì Chapinero One campus is located in the cultural center of the city La Candelaria. On this campus are the programs of Architecture and Urbanism, Management and Engineering. It has a theater that functions as an auditorium. There is a second campus located in the Chapinero district, that also has a theater used by several institutions including the district and the La Salle schools. The third campus is located in the North of the city, where it has a more spacious area and accommodates the agricultural sciences. Chapels As a sign of the Catholic affiliation of the university, each campus has a chapel, with free public access. Every chapel is coordinated by the pastor of each campus. Chapel of La Santa Cruz (La Candelaria) The Chapel of La Santa Cruz is located in the La Candelaria campus. It was built in 1933, years before the foundation of the university as it is known today. The chapel was initially planned to serve as a private chapel for the Lasallian Brothers' Institute and its students, but due to the destruction caused to the Institute's original building on the night of 9 April 1948 in the Bogotazo revolt, the chapel was eventually repaired to become part of the new University established in the first semester of 1965. Currently, the chapel is a living example of the long history of the Lasallian brothers in Colombia. One of the main characteristics of this chapel that shows its history, is an organ which is used on special occasions. The organ is one of three such organs existing in the city. High altar of the La Santa Cruz Chapel Organ of the La Santa Cruz chapel Chapel of the Star (Chapinero) The Chapel of the Star is one of the most significant buildings on the Chapinero campus, because of its distinctive arched shape. The chapel was built as part of the project of the campus. Its name comes from one of the universal symbols of the Lasallian brothers, The Mary's star.

In response, more than thirty compositions were presented from which ten were chosen and among them winner was chosen. The winner is now the current anthem of the University, representing all the work of the Lasallian brothers since their arrival in the country. The music was composed by Heriberto Mor√°n Vivas, with direction by Francisco Javier Cuevas Romero.

It is located directly west of Alumni Hall and is directly adjacent to South Dining Hall on the west. Dillon was built in 1931 and has space for 334 undergraduate students. It is named after Patrick Dillon, CSC, the second president of the university. The coat of arms is taken from the Dillon family. Together with other historic structures of the university, it is on the National Register of Historic Places. Dillon Hall History Construction of Dillon and Alumni was part of an extensive building program that started in the mid 20s and aimed at improving educational and living facilities, and increasing supply of on-campus residential facilities. The two dorms were expected to cost $850,000 and add host 500 students to reduce the housing shortage and increase on-campus students to 2,600. Ground was broken on March 2nd 1931 and construction was contracted to Sollitt and Sons. Funds were collected through the Alumni Association and a $250,000 gift from the General Education Board. An additional $52,000 came from the 1925 Rose Bowl.Dufresne, Chris \\"When they were riding high\\". Los Angeles Times, October 2, 2007 Both halls were designed in 1931 by architects Charles Donagh Maginnis and Timothy Walsh in Collegiate Gothic style. The Maginnis & Walsh was known at the time for its innovative and refined gothic design of churches and campuses in Boston, and was behind the campus architecture of Boston College and the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception. The architectural style of both Dillon and Alumni was in line with the previous gothic building on campus by Kervick and Fagan such as Morrissey, with local yellow brick with limestone trimmings, adorned with stone carvings on the facade and the interiors. The exterior features carvings of saints and athletes. The building is decorated with four statues by Rev. John J. Bednar, CSC, depicting St. Jerome and St. Augustine (west court), Cardinal Newman (above the southwest entrance), and St. Patrick (south wall), and a statue of Commodore Barry (located in the west court) by Hungarian sculptor Eugene Kormendi, who was sculptor in residence at Notre Dame. Dillon's chapel is dedicated to St. Patrick, namesake of Patrick Dillon, and a side altar is dedicated to St. Olaf, in honor of Knute Rockne, of Norwegian ancestry, who had passed just before the construction of the hall. When the halls opened in early November of 1931 and three hundred freshmen moved in, the Dillon featured some of the latest technologies of the time, such as electric elevators, extension phones, buzzers, and slots for used razors. The first rector was Rev. Patrick Haggerty, class of 1916. The dormitory was named after Fr. Patrick Dillon, a Notre Dame graduate who was only 33 years old in 1865 when he was named the University's second president. This continued a long tradition of naming residence halls after previous presidents. Additionally, the hall was built one hundred year after his birth. He was considered lenient in disciplinary matters, a trait that made him popular among students but that had him removed from the administration only one year in his tenure. Since previous newest residential development of Howard Hall, Morrissey Hall, and Lyons Hall (built in 1924-1927) had previously been known as \\"Gold Coast\\" because of their refined architecture, Alumni and Dillon quickly were dubbed \\"Platinum Coast\\" both because they had improved amenities but also because of the grayer color of the architecture and decoration. During World War II, Dillon and Alumni officers for the V-12 Navy College Training Program. Past rectors include Mark L. Poorman and Daniel R. Jenky, who later was rector of the Basilica of the Sacred Heart and Bishop of the Diocese of Peoria. Paul Doyle has served as rector since 1997. Traditions Brady Quinn at the Dillon Hall pep rally Dillon's signature event of every year was formerly the Dillon Hall Pep Rally, hosted on South Quad on the Thursday preceding the first home game. The pep rally was a comedy/variety show performed outside of Dillon the Thursday before the first home football game of the fall. Dillon's current signature event is Opening Day, a wiffle ball tournament between the sections of Dillon. The hall gives out free food, as well as hosts games and activities in the courtyard between Dillon and South Dining Hall. Dillon's other major events are Milkshake Mass and the Big Red Dog Dance with Alumni Hall. Alumni Hall is the traditional rival of Dillon.

Located 2 km below the surface in Vale's Creighton nickel mine near Sudbury, Ontario, SNOLAB is an expansion of the existing facilities constructed for the original Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) solar neutrino experiment. SNOLAB surface building. Access to the underground facilities is provided via the nearby mine elevator operated by Vale Limited SNOLAB is the world's deepest operational clean room facility. Although accessed through an active mine, the laboratory proper is maintained as a class-2000 cleanroom, with very low levels of dust and background radiation. SNOLAB's 2070 m (6800 feet) of overburden rock provides 6010 metre water equivalent (MWE) shielding from cosmic rays, providing a low-background environment for experiments requiring high sensitivities and extremely low counting The combination of great depth and cleanliness that SNOLAB affords allows extremely rare interactions and weak processes to be studied. In addition to neutrino and dark matter physics, SNOLAB is also host to biological experiments in an underground environment.  History  The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory was the world's deepest underground experiment since the Kolar Gold Fields experiments ended with the closing of that mine in 1992. With the deepest underground laboratory in North America at 2100 metre water equivalent depth, and the deepest in the world at 4800 MWE, many other groups were interested in conducting experiments in the 6000 MWE location. In 2002, funding was approved by the Canada Foundation for Innovation to expand the SNO facilities into a general-purpose laboratory, and more funding was received in 2007 and 2008. Construction of the major laboratory space was completed in 2009, with the entire lab entering operation as a 'clean' space in March 2011. SNOLAB was briefly the world's deepest underground laboratory, until it was surpassed by the 2.4 km-deep China Jinping Underground Laboratory at the end of 2010. CJPL achieves a muon flux of less than 0.2 Œº/m¬≤/day, slightly less than SNOLAB's 0.27 Œº/m¬≤/day. (For comparison, the rate on the surface, at sea level, is about 15 million Œº/m¬≤/day.)  Experiments  , SNOLAB hosts the following experiments:SNOLAB: Current experiments Neutrino detectors * SNO+ experiment is a neutrino experiment using the original SNO experiment chamber, but using liquid scintillator in the place of heavy water from SNO. Linear alkyl benzene, the scintillator, increases the light yield, and therefore the sensitivity, allowing SNO+ to detect not only solar neutrinos, but also geoneutrinos, and reactor neutrinos. The ultimate goal of SNO+ is to observe neutrinoless double beta decay (0vbb). * HALO (Helium and Lead Observatory) is a neutron detector using ring-shaped lead blocks to detect neutrinos from supernovae within our galaxy. HALO is part of the Supernova Early Warning System (SNEWS), an international collaboration of neutrino-sensitive detectors that will allow astronomers the opportunity to observe the first photons visible following a core-collapse supernova. Dark matter detectors * DAMIC - Dark Matter in Charged Coupled Devices (CCDs) ‚Äì a dark matter detector using unusually thick CCDs to take long exposure images of particles passing through the detector. Various particles have known signatures and DAMIC seeks to find something new that could signal dark matter particles. * DEAP-3600 - Dark Matter Experiment using Argon Pulse-shape Discrimination - is a second generation dark matter detector, using 3600 kg of liquid argon. This experiment aims to detect WIMP-like dark matter particles through argon scintillation, or small amounts of light detected by extremely sensitive photomultiplier tubes. * The PICO 40L, a third generation bubble chamber dark matter search experiment, is a merger of the former PICASSO and COUPP collaborations. PICO operates using superheated fluids which form small bubbles when energy is deposited by particle interactions. These bubbles are then detected by high speed cameras and extremely sensitive microphones. Biological experiments * FLAME ‚Äì Flies in A Mine Experiment ‚Äì a biological experiment using fruit flies as a model organism to investigate the physical responses to working in increased atmospheric pressure underground. * REPAIR ‚Äì Researching the Effects of the Presence and Absence of Ionizing Radiation ‚Äì a biological experiment investigating the effects of low background radiation on growth, development, and cellular repair mechanisms. Projects under construction * SuperCDMS - Super-Cryogenic Dark Matter Search - is a second generation dark matter detector using silicon and germanium crystals cooled down to 10 mK, a fraction of a degree above absolute zero. This experiment aims to detect low mass dark matter particles through very small energy deposition in the crystal from particle collisions, resulting in vibrations detected by sensors. *NEWS-G - New Experiments with Spheres‚ÄìGas ‚Äì is a second generation spherical proportional counter electrostatic dark matter detector using noble gases in their gaseous state, as opposed to liquid noble gases used in DEAP-3600 and miniCLEAN.

It is written and directed by The Cowboys author Dale Jennings and narrated by F-Troop and Fractured Fairy Tales star Edward Everett Horton. Plot In the film, ten children, nine of whom have monkey faces, hats and tails, plan on going to the park for a picnic. They all ride there on their eight bikes together on the nine-block journey (two did not have bikes; one's bicycle was stolen and who instead had to run to keep up with his friends, and the other was so obese that he broke his bicycle); seeing that one of their friends has a basket, they decide to have him carry all of their lunches to the park. Each one of the monkeys has a character flaw, and each disobeys a specific rule that prevents them from reaching the park. At each block, one of the monkeys is eliminated from the group because of the consequences of their disobedience‚Äîusually by way of a collision. In the end, only one of the friends (who not only followed all the bike safety rules, but is also a normal human, whose face is not shown until the very end) makes it to the park and, because he was the one with the basket, gets all of his friends' food to himself, even though he doesn't want it all. Thus, as the title says, \\"One got fat!\\" Three of the monkeys are seen in hospital beds. In contrast to other social guidance films, One Got Fat is a dark comedy. Characters Each character represents a different rule of the road the character does not obey, along with a more general sin or vice the character has that prevents him or her from doing so. (Four of the nine sins correspond to four of the seven deadly sins.) # Rooty-Toot (\\"Rooty\\") Jasperson #* Make Signals #* Sin: Arrogance #* Demise: Turned left without stopping, signaling or looking, directly into ongoing traffic # Tinkerbell (\\"Tink\\") McDillinfiddy #* Watch Signs #* Sin: Forgetfulness #* Demise: Ignores a stop sign, resulting in being hit by a large truck # Phillip (\\"Floog\\") Floogle #* Keep Right #* Sin: Boredom #* Demise: Rides on left side of street between parallel-parked cars and oncoming traffic; while doing so a car moves out, hitting him # Mossby Pomegranate #* License/Register #* Sin: Sloth #* Fate: Had his bicycle stolen before the trip and unsuccessfully tries to run along with the bicycles. Last seen on the curb, having given up from fallen arches. (While licensing and registration of bicycles was still available in the mid-20th century, the practice is now obsolete, and attempts to reintroduce bicycle registration in the 21st century have been soundly rejected. The film posits that had the bicycle been registered, police would have been able to find it and identify the thief more quickly.) # \\"Slim\\" Jim Maguffny #Trigby Phipps #* Ride Alone #* Sin: Gluttony (Slim), giving into peer pressure (Trigby) #* Demise: Because Slim overate himself to the point of obesity, his bicycle collapsed under his weight before the trip. Slim asks to ride on the front of Trigby Phipps's bicycle; because Slim blocks Trigby's view and makes it difficult for him to steer, Trigby veers right into an open manhole and both fall in # Nelbert (\\"Nel\\") Zwieback #* Yield #* Sin: Anger/wrath #* Demise: Nel's road rage prompts her to angrily switch to the sidewalk (something that was noted as being illegal in her jurisdiction) and refused to yield right of way to two oncoming pedestrians with groceries. The pedestrians were propelled into a nearby tree. # Filbert (\\"Fil\\") Bagel #* Tune Up #* Sin: Neglect #* Demise: Fil assumes that he will be getting a new bike soon so he neglects his current bike. The brakes no longer work, resulting in Filbert being run over by a steam roller # Stanislaw (\\"Stan\\") Hickenbottom #* Lights/Reflectors #* Sin: Stupidity (\\"not bright enough\\") #* Demise: He rides his bike into a tunnel without any way to be seen. He collides with something in the tunnel, which cannot be seen due to the darkness # Orville (\\"Orv\\") Slump #* Fate: As he obeyed all of the traffic rules, he made it to the picnic, alone.

Reception After experiencing a mild revival of popularity on the Internet, the film was presented as a RiffTrax feature in April 2008, with commentary by Michael J. Nelson, Bill Corbett, and Kevin Murphy; they described the film as a \\"concentrated dose of lab-purified nightmare fuel\\" and said that it makes monkeys more terrifying than they already are.

It is located in the foothills of the Canadian Rockies on Highway 507, approximately west of Pincher Creek.  History  The community was formed with the opening of a coal mine in the early 1900s. At one time Beaver Mines had over 1,500 residents. Because of the requirement for steel (rail tracks) during the wars and the reduction in the need for coal, the coal mines eventually closed and the community residents moved away. The last mine shut down its operations in 1971 and currently the mine site and many of the building foundations are on private land. For the past 30 years Beaver Mines has been considered a ghost town and has had numerous write-ups in ghost town books.  Contemporary issues  Currently, due largely to the expansion of Castle Mountain Resort and the growth of Calgary to the north, the hamlet has begun to grow again as a popular recreational destination.  Climate  Beaver mines has a humid continental climate (Dfb) with mild to warm summers and cold, snowy winters with heavy snowfall for 8 months of the year. Late Spring and early Summer tends to be the wettest time of the year.

He commissioned architect Charles Galloway to design it. Attree renamed it after Queen Adelaide, consort of William IV. Queen Adelaide patronised the German Spa opened in 1825 by Dr F A A Struve of Dresden at the south end of the park, which remained in operation until 1886 when it continued as a mineral water plant until 1960. On the site now stands the Royal Spa Nursery school. Attree's plan never fully materialised and the surrounding housing is mostly late Victorian with some late 20th century infill and replacement. Pepper Pot At the north-west corner is Pennant Lodge, once the home of Charles Freshfield. Also to the north-west of the park itself, on Queen's Park Road, stands the Pepper Pot (also called the \\"Pepper Box\\"). Probably originally built as a horizontal wind-powered water pump, and later used for the publishing of a local newspaper, it was later an artist's studio and by the 1990s a public convenience. In the 21st century it has been sealed and unused. The park itself, without the houses but including the Spa and the Pepper pot, was bought by the Race Stand Trustees in 1890 for ¬£13,500 and donated to the town. Today Queen's Park is an attractive public park, well planted with trees and shrubs. It has a large pond, frequented by ducks, geese and herring gulls. A popular myth is that the pond was created when a First World War plane crashed in the middle of the park creating a crater lower than the water table. Although untrue, this myth is probably based on a real-life event when a recreational biplane, piloted by retired Air Marshall Phillip Austin, crash landed in the pond in 1923. Austin and the pond emerged unscathed. The park is also home to a children's play area, a caf√©, an extensive dog-free area, a scented garden for people with disabilities, a bowling green, tennis courts, and an area that is left untended in order to encourage wildlife.

History of the house The house was built in 1823 by the Locks and Canals Company for their manager. Paul Moody, master mechanic and inventor, was the first resident of the house. Upon becoming Chief Engineer in 1834, George Washington Whistler lived in the house with his wife, Anna Matilda McNeill Whistler. Their son James Whistler was born in 1834 there. James B. Francis took over as chief engineer and moved into the house in 1837 when G.W. Whistler moved to Russia. James Francis married Sarah, and they raised their six children here. In 1907 the home was purchased by the Lowell Art Association, Inc., and opened in 1908 as a museum.

Clary was also known as professional wrestler Johnny Angel who had success in the 1980s in the National Wrestling Federation (NWF). Early life Johnny Lee Clary was born on June 18, 1959, in Del City, Oklahoma.

Although Clary's father, a Catholic, was not a Klansman, Clary claimed that his paternal uncle, Harold, was a member and that Harold boasted to Clary's father of shooting an African-American man. Johnny's father sent his son on the Sunday school bus every week to the First Baptist Church. According to interviews Clary had given, his youth was marred by a violent and tragic family life and also by a lack of stability. At the age of 11, he watched his father kill himself and was subsequently shunted from one family member's home to another's. Eventually he found himself alone in East Los Angeles, California, where he became involved in gangs and joined the Ku Klux Klan by the time he was 14. Professional wrestling career In 1983, Johnny became a professional wrestler and was trained (along with his brother Terry Clary) by former NWA World Junior Heavyweight Champion, Danny Hodge. Terry began his career under the name Sugar Boy, with Johnny as his manager under the name Der Kommisar after a 1980s new wave song of that name. Terry is best known for almost holding the NWA World Jr. Heavyweight Title for a very brief period. The storyline had Terry defeat then-champion Danny Hodge after Johnny (portraying a heel managerial character) reached under the ropes during the match and tripped Hodge with a cane, and then had the decision reversed due to Johnny's \\"interference\\". Terry continued to wrestle, changing his name to Buddy \\"Bad Man\\" Savage. Johnny left wrestling management and began wrestling by himself, using the name Johnny Angel. Racism and conversion to an anti-racism preacher While wrestling, Clary continued his involvement in the KKK. According to his interviews with several media outlets, Clary became the Grand Dragon of the Oklahoma arm of the White Knights Of The Ku Klux Klan. Clary claims to have become increasingly disillusioned with the KKK even as he rose through its ranks. He mentions a first brush with evangelical Christianity in the mid-to-late 1980s but, he claims, he was scared into returning to the KKK and went on to become the Imperial Wizard of the whole White Knights organization in 1989. During his leadership the White Knights did not garner much media attention for their activities, but Clary was an active spokesperson for the Klan, defending racism and violence against non-white peoples. In this role he appeared on syndicated talk shows including those hosted by Oprah Winfrey and Morton Downey.Former Klansman addresses his past, lincolntimesnews.com; accessed October 28, 2014. In interviews Clary asserts that he left the KKK for good in 1990 and joined an evangelical church. This time he stayed with the church and in 1991 he began preaching.

Aegae is mentioned by both Herodotus and Strabo as being a member of the Aeolian dodecapolis. It was also an important sanctuary of Apollo. Aigai had its brightest period under the Attalid dynasty, which ruled from nearby Pergamon in the 3rd and 2nd century BC. The remains of the city are located near the modern village of Yuntdaƒüƒ± K√∂seler in Manisa Province, Turkey. The archaeological site is situated at a rather high altitude almost on top of Mount G√ºn (Daƒüƒ±), part of the mountain chain of Yunt (Daƒülarƒ±).  History  Plan of Aigai drawn by Richard Bohn in 1889 Initially the city was a possession of the Lydian Empire and later the Achaemenid Empire when it conquered the former. In the early third century BC it became part of the Kingdom of Pergamon. It changed hands from Pergamon to the Seleucid Empire, but was recaptured by Attalus I of Pergamon in 218 BC. In the war between Bithynia and Pergamon, it was destroyed by Prusias II of Bithynia in 156 BC. After a peace was brokered by the Romans, the city was compensated with hundred talents. Under the rule of Pergamon a market building and a temple to Apollo were constructed. In 129 BC the Kingdom of Pergamon became part of the Roman Empire. The city was destroyed by an earthquake in 17 AD and received aid for reconstruction from emperor Tiberius.  Ecclesiastical History  √Üg√¶ was important enough in the Roman province of Asia Prima to become one of the many suffragans of its capital Ephesus's Metropolitan Archbishopric; but it as to fade.  Titular see  The diocese was nominally restored in 1933 as titular bishopric.

(1962.04.12 ‚Äì 1978.05.26)  Remains = Layout  The city is situated on a plateau at the summit of the steep G√ºn Daƒüƒ± mountain, which can be climbed from the north. The plateau is surrounded by a wall with a length of 1.5 kilometers. On the eastern side are the remains of the three-story indoor market with a height of 11 meters and a length of 82 meters. The upper floor of the Hellenistic building was renovated in Roman times. The partially overgrown remains of many other buildings are scattered over the site. These include the acropolis which is laid out in terraces, a Macellum, a gymnasium, a bouleuterion and the foundations of three temples. About five kilometers to the east the foundations of a sanctuary of Apollo are found on the banks of the river which flows around the ruins. It was an Ionic order peripteros temple from the first century BC. A cella which is six meters high and three monoliths still remain.  Excavation history  The first western visitors of Aigai were William Mitchell Ramsay and Salomon Reinach in 1880. They reported about their visit in the Journal of Hellenic Studies and the Bulletin de Correspondance Hell√©nique. They were followed by Richard Bohn and Carl Schuchhardt, who examined the site as a part of the excavations in Pergamon. Since 2004 the site is being excavated by Ersin Doƒüer of Ege University in Izmir.Excavation web site (in Turkish) http://aigai.info/ By 2010 the access road, the bouleuterion, the odeon, shops, numerous water pipes and large parts of the market hall were uncovered. For the coming years it is planned to re-erect the market hall's facade with the original stones. In 2016, archaeologists discovered a mosaic depicting the god Poseidon. The mosaic was found in the frigidarium part of the ancient bath.

They found that the reported car bomb was not a car bomb, but an ambulance with five civilians who had been killed, including a pregnant woman who was being taken to a hospital north of the city. Garen and Doshi conducted interviews with the ambulance driver who survived and the hospital that dispatched the ambulance, as well as filmed the bodies in the morgue, and the remains of the ambulance on the bridge. They gave parts of their footage to an Italian TV channel staying on the Italian base in Nasiriyah, as the TV station was unable to travel into Nasiriyah and investigate themselves. Italian television aired the story and it cause a huge uproar, as it was the first time the Italian military had been accused of wrongdoing in Iraq. General Dalzini denied the Italian military had shot an ambulance. Immediately following, Garen and Doshi were interrogated for many hours by the Italian military. Garen left the Italian military base, where he had been staying, for Baghdad. Two years after the incident, three soldiers were indicted for shooting at the ambulance, the first time Italian soldiers had been indicted for a crime during the Iraq war.

The cup/lid on the right is filled with butter, then inverted and placed in the water-containing base on the left. A French butter dish is a container used to maintain the freshness and spreadable consistency of butter without refrigeration. This late 19th century French-designed pottery crock has two parts: a base that holds water, and a cup to hold the packed butter which also serves as a lid. The cup containing butter is placed into the base, where water creates an airtight seal that keeps the air (and thus oxygen) away from the butter so that refrigeration is not needed, and the butter can be used in its soft form. This method will keep butter for around a month provided it is kept at temperatures below and the water is changed regularly. Other names for this item are: \\"French butter keeper\\", \\"French butter crock\\", \\"butter crock\\", \\"beurrier √† l'eau\\", \\"beurrier Breton\\", \\"beurrier Normand\\", \\"cloche de beurre\\", \\"pot √† beurre Breton\\", \\"franz√∂sische Butterdose\\" (German).

In the 1970s and 1980s, craft potters began producing and marketing the French butter dish throughout the United States at craft fairs and in art boutiques. \\"French Butter Dish\\" became the preferred name in the USA around that time and was later adopted by potters in Europe.

Gregory was enthroned during one of the exiles of Patriarch Athanasius I from Alexandria. Most in the Eastern Orthodox Church of Alexandria and Coptic Church deny his papacy and say that Athanasius I was the true patriarch, considering Gregory to be a usurper of the Alexandrian see.

History Valby Idr√¶tspark is located on the former Valby Common. It was first used for football in 1913. The lack of proper facilities for the football clubs were subject to discussions between Valby Boldspil and the City but plans to build a large club house went on hold with the outbreak of World War I. In 1922, the plans were revived but once again without result due to disagreements over the financing. In 1926, a total of 10 football clubs used Valby F√¶lled but by then the conditions had become so poor that most of them had to find other premises, mostly on √òster F√¶lled (The Rast Common) in √òsterbro.

The plans involved a football stadium, 18 football pitches for training, a club house for Boldklubben Frem and another one for the other clubs, an aquatic stadium, tennis courts, four halls for gymnastics, boxing, wrestling and waight lifting, 20 shooting ranges, bowling court, restaurant, offices, changing facilities and an indoor arena. Work began in 1937 but the plans were affected by the outbreak of World War II and the German Occupation of Denmark. BK Frem moved from Enghave vej to their new club house on 7 March 1942. The name of the area was officialled changed from Valby F√¶lled to Valby Idr√¶tspark on 18 August 1942. The opening game was played between BK Frem and a selected team with seven players from BK Fremad Valby, three players from Valby and one from Als. Valby Idr√¶tspark hosted 449 football matches in 1949 and 507 in 1950. In 1964, Valby Idr√¶tspark was used by a total of 126 sports clubs of which 45 were football clubs. The new Banbury tribune, with inspiration from Coventry, was inaugurated on 7 September 1969 with a match between BK Frem and Esbjerg. In 2007, Copenhagen Municipality predicted that the main stand would last another 5‚Äì10 years.

The event always occurs over the last weekend in July and often draws estimated crowds of 50,000 to 75,000. Started in 1967, Nordic Fest grew from Luther College Women's Club annual celebration of Norwegian Constitution Day known as Syttende Mai. American Norwegians are exceptionally loyal to their heritage, which explains the size and scope of Nordic Fest. Every year, the residents of Decorah, Iowa, put on a jubilee of Old World heritage that brings people to the picturesque hills of northeast Iowa and serves as a kind of homecoming for Scandinavian-Americans from many states. News of Norway From the start, the entire community has been engaged in Nordic Fest through such efforts as the Decorah Nordic Dancers. Chosen dancers start in third grade and perform at Nordic Fest and other events through their high school graduation, representing 10 years‚Äô commitment. Nordic Fest features traditional foods, antique show, arts and crafts, musical entertainment and Norse storytelling. Demonstrations include knife making, rosemaling, weaving and wood carving, together with other Norwegian folk art. There is a river run and grand parade with marchers in bunads, a traditional Norwegian folk costume. The festival concludes with a street dance and beverage garden with a band. Bands have included the Backhome Boys, the El Caminos, Gaelstorm and Three Beers til Dubuque. There is also a spectacular fireworks display that takes place over the river.Nordmanns-Forbundet Much on the Nordic Fest activities centers on Luther College and the Vesterheim Norwegian-American Museum. Norwegian immigrants to Decorah decided early on they wanted to preserve the old ways; in 1861, they established Luther College, and in 1877, they started a museum, Vesterheim, today a village of pioneer buildings that keeps traditions alive with year-round workshops and celebrations. The dorms of Luther College accommodate many of the visitors to Nordic Fest. Vesterheim provides viewing of Scandinavian art in the Hauge Gallery of the Westby- Torgerson Education Center.Norwegian American Foundation There was no festival in 2020 as officials cited the COVID-19 pandemic as grounds for cancellation.

Drawing on influences from the Italian Campagna and the Picturesque, including the art of Claude Lorrain, it began an architectural style that was hugely influential in England in the first half of the nineteenth century. Major examples include Trentham Park and Osborne House. Nash's \\"most original building\\", it is Grade I listed. History The house was designed by John Nash in 1802A design was exhibited at the Royal Academy, 1802, as a \\"house near Shrewsbury\\" (Howard Colvin). for Francis Walford. Walford was a friend of Thomas Noel Hill, 2nd Baron Berwick, of nearby Attingham Park, and the agent for Berwick's Attingham estates. Mansbridge considers that the design was \\"almost certainly inspired\\" by Claude Lorrain's painting \\"Landscape near Rome with a View of the Ponte Molle.\\" Lord Berwick was the owner of two Claude landscapes. Walford lived at Cronkhill, managing Lord Berwick's Attingham interests, until their relationship ended acrimoniously in 1828, when Walford left the house. It was then occupied by members of the Berwick family, often when Attingham Park was let, until their final return to Attingham in the 1920s. Cronkhill, along with Attingham Park, was gifted to the National Trust in the post-war period. Architecture The body of the house is a rectangular two-storey block, with a circular, three- storey, tower to the north and a square, three-storey, tower to the west. A loggia links the two towers. The walls are now white stucco, although the colour may originally have been designed to imitate ashlar. Internally, the main reception rooms are simply decorated, comprising a drawing room in the round tower, a library in the square tower and a dining room in the body of the house. Although influential, the house, as with much of Nash's work, was subject to criticism, Davis describing the round tower as \\"merely a dramatic architectural trick, (containing neither) a circular staircase, nor even one circular room.\\" As of 2016, the National Trust is undertaking a major restoration of the house to \\"restore Cronkhill's appearance back to Nash's original design.\\" See also *Grade I listed buildings in Shropshire *Listed buildings in Atcham NotesReferences  * External links * Cronkhill at the National Trust Country houses in Shropshire Grade I listed houses Grade I listed buildings in Shropshire Houses completed in 1802 Italianate architecture in the United Kingdom John Nash buildings ","title":"Cronkhill"},{"id":"6305002","text":"\\"Krasi, thalassa ke t' agori mou\\" (Greek: \\"ŒöœÅŒ±œÉŒØ, Œ∏Œ¨ŒªŒ±œÉœÉŒ± Œ∫Œ±Œπ œÑ' Œ±Œ≥œåœÅŒπ ŒºŒøœÖ\\"; English translation: \\"Wine, sea and my boyfriend\\") was the Greek entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1974, performed in Greek by Marinella.

Barnett faced the incumbent Democratic Governor Kathleen Sebelius in the general election on November 7, 2006 and was unsuccessful in his bid as Sebelius was reelected for a 2nd term. On June 2, 2009, Barnett announced that he was a candidate for the Republican nomination for the United States Congress from the first district of Kansas. On August 3, 2010, Barnett lost the Republican nomination to fellow state senator Tim Huelskamp. Barnett subsequently resigned his state Senate seat, and resumed his medical career at a Topeka, Kansas, clinic. 2006 gubernatorial campaign In January 2006 Barnett first announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination for Governor of Kansas. As 2006 progressed, other candidates for the Republican nomination emerged, however none of them were able to match Barnett in campaign spending or statewide name recognition. On August 1 Barnett secured the Republican nomination with 36% of the vote. His closest competitor was author Ken Canfield, who received 26%, followed by former state House Speaker Robin Jennison, who polled 22%.. The candidates for the Republican nomination represented a wide variety of factions within the Republican party. Of the candidates, Barnett was neither a true moderate nor a true conservative, which may have helped with his win in the primary. Barnett's opponent in the general election was incumbent Democratic Governor Kathleen Sebelius. Sebelius was first elected governor in 2002.

Sebelius defeated Barnett on November 7, 2006, with over 58% of total votes cast. 2018 gubernatorial campaign On June 20, 2017, Barnett announced his candidacy for governor in 2018. In May 2018, Barnett announced that his wife Rosemary \\"Rosie\\" Hansen would be his running mate. Barnett stated that he wanted his running mate to be able to help him institute his #OneKansas agenda, help his administration improve the functionality of the State government, and help bridge the urban/rural divide, and he believes his wife, Rosie Hansen, is the most qualified to do so. Policy Positions Jim Barnett is considered to be a Moderate alternative to Kris Kobach in the Republican Party primary for the Kansas gubernatorial election, 2018. Abortion Barnett opposes abortion. In 2010 while a member of the Kansas Senate, Barnett voted to override former Kansas governor Mark Parkinson's veto of an abortion bill. Crosscheck Program Barnett has criticized the use of the Interstate Voter Registration Crosscheck Program in Kansas, calling it a \\"flawed program\\" and a waste of time and money. Economy and Taxes Barnett told the Shawnee Mission Post he considers has stated that he believes former Kansas governor Sam Brownback's tax experiment \\"failed miserably from a budget standopoint.\\" He thinks increasing tourism to Kansas would improve the economy. Infrastructure Barnett wants Kansas to go back to having a long-term plan for building and maintaining roads and highways. K-12 Education Barnett told the Shawnee Mission Post that if elected governor, he wants to increase education funding to $600 million stair-stepped over 3 years ($200 million each year), and that he would sign legislation to adequately fund the schools according to the courts. Local Control Barnett told the High Plains/Midwest AG Journal, \\"Ninety-five percent of economic development is local and we have to respect local communities\\" in reference to the proposed Tyson Foods chicken plant in Tonganoxie, Kansas that was unpopular with many local residents. Medicaid Expansion Barnett supports expanding Medicaid in Kansas. In June 2017, Barnett expressed concern that Congress would not allow states that have not already expanded Medicaid to do so and anticipated that repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act would jeopardize healthcare for 440,000 Kansans. Water Barnett has stated \\"water is significant to our state's economy\\" and that Kansas should work on moving water west and collaborating with other states to maintain the water. He commended former Kansas governor Sam Brownback's 50-year plan to improve water quality and quantity in the state.

In 1895, it was the sixth-largest brewery in the United States. Background Shortly after immigrating to the United States, Swiss-German August Schmid and Emanuel Bernheimer founded the Costanz Brewery at East 4th Street near Avenue B in 1850. The brewery produced a lagered beer, a favorite among German immigrants. By 1852, they built a second Costanz Brewery at Four Corners in Staten Island, home to a large German community. Five years later, Bernheimer became the partner of another German immigrant, James Speyers and founded the Lion Brewery in 1857 in Manhattan Valley. A group of Catholic Bavarians helped build the Lion Brewery. When it was built, they held masses in the Brewery on Sunday mornings. History At its peak, the Lion Brewery occupied about six square city blocks, from Central Park West to Amsterdam Avenue and from 107th to 109th Street. At the time Manhattan's Upper West Side was an open area with inexpensive land housing, many public institutions and an insane asylum. There were about five to ten thousand living in shanties after being displaced by the creation of Central Park in 1859. Consequently, with the brewery and surrounding areas, the Upper West Side failed to increase its real estate value until the early twentieth century. In 1862, a $1 tax on each barrel of beer hurt small brewers but not Lion. The anti-saloon movement in the late 19th and early 20th century encouraged Lion to clean up its own saloons. \\"LION BREWERY\\" with bottling house and garage map in 1916 Manhattan Lion Brewery got caught up in a wave of mergers and closings among some of the smaller New York Brewers in the early 1940s which continued until 1941, when the business closed. The brewery (including the canning facilities) was auctioned off on August 26, 1943. The plant was demolished in 1944 and more than 3,000 tons of steel were taken from the original brewery structure and recycled for the war effort. After the Brewery was knocked down the lot was paved over with cinders. On Sundays, after the war, returning World War II Veterans formed a Softball League and played almost every Sunday afternoon. Home plate was located near 107th street and Columbus Avenue. Today, apartment houses occupy the Lion brewery's former location. Around 1860, the brewery published a pamphlet titled \\"Observations on Brewing and Beer: With an Analysis and Scientific Testimony Relative to the Lager Beer of the Speyers' Lion Brewery.\\" The pamphlet had a short history of the different kinds of beer, and an analysis showing that their lager beer was pure. The pamphlet also included some great line drawings of the brewery complex. See also * List of breweries in New York The end of the next to last paragraph of your piece about the Lion Brewery indicates its area is now covered with apartment houses (Today, apartment houses occupy the Lion brewery's former location.) This is not entirely true. Booker T Washington Junior High School is located between 108th and 107th streets on the Columbus Avenue end of the property. I knew some kids who went to the school, remember when it was being built, played handball in its yard, and messed up my left wrist when I fell chasing a grounder in a softball game on its hardtop almost 60 years ago. I also remember, somewhat more vaguely, the Caterpillar Ride of the annual carnival that used to set up on the grounds before the school was built. Sorry, no recollection of the brewery itself. This is not a big deal but, a lot of kids went to Booker T over the years and might like to see it mentioned. If you look at a Maps application, you can verify this. Your sentence could read: Today, blocks of apartment houses, small businesses, and Booker T Washington Junior High School occupy the Lion brewery's former location.

Officially classified as RM like all other railcar classes in New Zealand, they acquired the designation of \\"Standard\\" to differentiate them from other railcar classes. They were introduced in 1938 and withdrawn in 1972.  Background  Since the 1912 experiments with a MacEwan-Pratt petrol railcar, the New Zealand Railways Department had been seeking an effective and successful railcar design. Many routes simply did not have the demand to economically justify locomotive-hauled passenger express trains, so railcars were seen as a viable alternative. New Zealand's difficult terrain posed problems to railcar design, but in 1936, the Wairarapa railcars were introduced and proved to be a great success on the Wairarapa Line from Wellington over the Rimutaka Incline to the Wairarapa, and following from this, the Standard railcars were designed to provide regional services in on regular lines in the North Island. NZR placed an order for the six railcars in 1937.  Design  Six in total were built in the NZR Hutt Workshops in 1938 and 1939, each with a semi-streamlined design featuring slanting ends. Each car had two compartments, the larger with 36 seats (second class) and the smaller with 12 seats (first class) or 16 seats (second class). The first two railcars were initially first and second class, but later became second-class only. The other railcars were always second-class in both compartments. Driving controls were located at each end of the railcar so that they did not have to be turned at termini. Each was powered by two diesel engines, mounted on the bogies. They wore out three sets of engines; the original Leyland engines were replaced with Meadows engines. The original silver body colour with a green stripe was inconspicuous and was soon replaced by plain red with grey or black roofs. In 1951, the Standard railcars became red with silver (later white) stripes and a grey roof as used on other railcar types and some locomotives. All six of the Standard railcars were named after MƒÅori canoes: * Aotea * Tokumaru * Pangatoru * Takitimu * Tainui * Tikitere  Operation  RM 31 (Tokomaru) going for a run through the Pahiatua station yard. The Standard railcars were first used to operate a fast return service from Wellington to New Plymouth, and soon a Hawkes Bay service between Wairoa and Napier was added, along with a Sundays-only return service from Napier to Wellington. In 1943, the Wairoa-Napier service was extended to serve Gisborne. From 1950, the original Leyland were replaced with more powerful Meadows engines. In 1955, the 88 seater railcars were introduced, and 88 seaters and Standards initially shared duties on the New Plymouth and Hawkes Bay services, but soon the 88 seaters took over all of the Hawkes Bay services and the Standard railcars were left to run the New Plymouth route. After the opening of the Rimutaka Tunnel in November 1955, both the 88 seater and Standard railcars soon took over from the Wairarapa railcars and operated a service from Wellington to Palmerston North via the Wairarapa. The Standard railcars never operated in the South Island, as the Vulcan railcars were built to operate rural services on that island.  Record runs  In September 1938 RM 30 covered the 321km between Napier and Wellington in 4 hours and 36 minutes running time. In 1967 RM 30 took a group of railway enthusiasts from Auckland to Wellington in 9 hours and 26 minutes (running time 8 hours and 42 minutes).  Withdrawal and preservation  RM 31 (Tokomaru) at Pahiatua. The Standard railcars were withdrawn in December 1972, being replaced on the Wellington-New Plymouth service by 88-seater railcars upgraded as \\"Blue Streaks\\" and two-thirds of the class have been preserved. Two cars, RM 30 Aotea and RM 34 Tainui were purchased by the New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Society Wellington Branch in 1972 for their heritage project in the Hutt Valley, then located at Gracefield on the industrial branch line of the same name. RM 32 Pangatoru was purchased by the NZR&LS; Waikato Branch and displayed at their Te Awamutu Railway Museum until 1991, when it moved to Te Rapa locomotive depot for a proposed overhaul that never eventuated. The late John Murphy purchased the other three cars - RM 31 Tokomaru, RM 33 Takitimu, and RM 35 Tikitere - in December 1972 for preservation, along with many spare parts and instruction manuals. Although he wanted to keep all three cars, he was later forced to scrap RM 33 and RM 35 as he was unable to look after them. Also, while RM 33 was still potentially operable, RM 35 had been involved in an accident during its last months of service, and its frame was bent in such a way that would have prevented it from running again; even if it was feasible to repair the damage, it would have been beyond John's means to repair it or pay for it to be repaired. Today, RM 30 and RM 34 reside on the Silver Stream Railway in Wellington. RM 30 is operable, while RM 34 is currently undergoing an overhaul to working order to allow it to run on the SSR during open days. RM 32 is now located at the Glenbrook Vintage Railway south of Auckland; the railcar moved there in 2001 after the proposed overhaul fell through and the Te Rapa loco depot was demolished, requiring it to find a new home. RM 31 was for a time held at Masterton but was later placed on loan to the Pahiatua Railcar Society at Pahiatua. When John died, the car was bequeathed to the PRS along with the manuals and spare parts, some of which came from RM 33 and RM 35, that John had accumulated. The car attended the 2008 North Island Main Trunk centenary celebrations, but at the time was not mainline certified. It was finally brought up to mainline standards in late 2011, and ditch lights mounted in the headstocks. The railcar then underwent mainline trials and crew training. Its first revenue run as a heritage rail vehicle took place on . As part of the mainline qualifications, RM 31 has been fitted with an events recorder, train radio, and ditch lights at either end. These are recessed into the railcar's front fairings so as not to detract from the original character of the railcar.

She ran for Congress in New York City in 2006. Education and career Lerman was educated at Brooklyn College, Long Island University, and Hofstra University, obtaining the degrees of BA from Brooklyn, MA from Long Island University, and a PhD in psychology (1989) from Hofstra. She was employed as a staff psychologist with the New York City Board of Education. She retired from this position in 2011 following being diagnosed with colon cancer. Political activity Lerman joined the Independence Party immediately after it gained ballot status in 1994, becoming a member of the State Committee and Treasurer (later Vice Chair) of the Staten Island branch of the party. She was the party candidate in several elections. In many of the early elections involving the Independence Party Lerman battled with the Board of Elections to gain ballot status for party candidates on Staten Island, with the Board consistently claiming Lerman's petitions failed to abide by various rules. Lerman generally succeeded in getting her candidates on the ballot by going to court. Finally, in 1999 the Richmond County Independence Party tried to cross-endorse a Democrat, John Sollazo for an office. The Board rejected Lerman's petitions on the grounds she did not live in the district in which Sollazo was running. She took the case to federal court pro se, and Judge Eugene Nickerson ruled the requirement that the petitioner live in the district was irrational. The Board of Elections appealed all the way to the United States Supreme Court. At this point the Brennan Center for Justice, a division of the School of Law of New York University, stepped in and became Lerman's legal representative. The Supreme Court ultimately upheld Nickerson's ruling, forcing a change of law not just in New York State, but in eighteen other states as well. Lerman received an Anti-Corruption Award from the statewide Independence Party for this accomplishment. For her 2006 campaign for Congress in the New York's 13th congressional district, Anita Lerman identified the following issues for her platform. Firstly the equipping of individual households with solar and wind generated electricity. Secondly she argued for the lowering of the cost of gasoline in the United States.

In an information-sharing collaboration at Caversham, BBC Monitoring handles media from 25% of the world while Open Source handles the remaining 75%. There are plans to move Monitoring's headquarters elsewhere, possibly impacting this cooperation.BBC Monitoring: MPs raise fears over service's future The House of Commons Foreign Affairs and Defence Committees have strongly condemned the gradual scaling down of BBC Monitoring's capabilities in two separate reports.Open Source Stupidity: The Threat to the BBC Monitoring Service Sources and notesFurther reading *Initial Assessment on the Implementation of The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 Open-source intelligence in the United States ","title":"Open Source Enterprise"},{"id":"6305265","title":"Timothy Salophakiolos"},{"id":"6305266","text":"According to Susan Buck-Morss in Hegel, Haiti, and Universal History (2009), Hegel was influenced by articles about the Haitian Revolution in Minerva. The master‚Äìslave dialectic is the common name for a famous passage of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit, though the original German phrase, Herrschaft und Knechtschaft, is more properly translated as Lordship and Bondage.David A. Duquette, \\"Hegel‚Äôs Social and Political Thought\\", Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Accessed 9 February 2012). It is widely considered a key element in Hegel's philosophical system, and has heavily influenced many subsequent philosophers. The passage describes, in narrative form, the development of self-consciousness as such in an encounter between what are thereby (i.e., emerging only from this encounter) two distinct, self- conscious beings. The essence of the dialectic is the movement or motion of recognizing, in which the two self-consciousnesses are constituted in being each recognized as self-conscious by the other. This movement, inexorably taken to its extreme, takes the form of a \\"struggle to the death\\" in which one masters the other, only to find that such lordship makes the very recognition he had sought impossible, since the bondsman, in this state, is not free to offer it.  Context  \\"Independent and Dependent Self-Consciousness: Lordship and Bondage\\" is the first of two titled subsections in the \\"Self- Consciousness\\" chapter of Phenomenology. It is preceded in the chapter by a discussion of \\"Life\\" and \\"Desire\\", among other things, and is followed by \\"Free Self-Consciousness: Stoicism, Skepticism, and the Unhappy Consciousness\\". Hegel wrote this story or myth in order to explain his idea of how self-consciousness dialectically sublates into what he variously refers to as Absolute Knowledge, Spirit, and Science. As a work, the Phenomenology may be considered both as an independent work, apparently considered by Hegel to be an a priori for understanding the Science of Logic, and as a part of the Science of Logic, where Hegel discusses absolute knowledge.  Recognition  Crucially, for Hegel, absolute knowledge, or Spirit, cannot come to be without first a self-consciousness recognizing another self-consciousness. He maintained that the entire reality is immediately present to self- consciousness. It undergoes three stages of development: 1) Desire, where self-consciousness is directed at things other than itself; 2) Master-slave, where the self-consciousness is directed at another that is unequal to itself; and 3) Universal self-conscious, where the self-conscious recognizes itself in another. Such an issue in the history of philosophy had only ever been explored by Johann Gottlieb Fichte and its treatment marks a watershed in European philosophy.  Hegel's myth  In order to explain how this works, Hegel uses a story that is in essence an abstracted, idealized history about how two people meet. However, Hegel's idea of the development of self- consciousness from consciousness, and its sublation into a higher unity in absolute knowledge, is not the contoured brain of natural science and evolutionary biology, but a phenomenological construct with a history; one that must have passed through a struggle for freedom before realising itself. The abstract language used by Hegel never allows one to interpret this story in a straightforward fashion. It can be read as self-consciousness coming to itself through a child's or adult's development, or self-consciousness coming to be in the beginning of human history (see hominization) or as that of a society or nation realising freedom. That the master‚Äìslave dialectic can be interpreted as an internal process occurring in one person or as an external process between two or more people is a result, in part, of the fact that Hegel asserts an \\"end to the antithesis of subject and object\\". What occurs in the human mind also occurs outside of it. The objective and subjective, according to Hegel, sublate one another until they are unified, and the \\"story\\" takes this process through its various \\"moments\\" when the lifting up of two contradictory moments results in a higher unity. First, the two abstract consciousnesses meet and are astounded at the realisation of the self as a foreign object. Each can choose to ignore the other, in which case no self-consciousness forms and each views the other merely as an animated object rather than an equivalent subject. Or, they become mesmerized by the mirror- like other and attempt, as they previously had done in controlling their own body, to assert their will. According to Hegel,  Reaction  When initially confronted with another person, the self cannot be immediately recognized: 'Appearing thus immediately on the scene, they are for one another like ordinary objects, independent shapes, individuals submerged in the being [or immediacy] of Life'.Hegel, Georg. Phenomenology of Spirit. The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism, by Vincent B. Leitch et al., W.W. Norton & Company, 2018, pp. 549‚Äì555.  Death struggle  A struggle to the death ensues. However, if one of the two should die, the achievement of self- consciousness fails. Hegel refers to this failure as \\"abstract negation\\" not the negation or sublation required. This death is avoided by the agreement, communication of, or subordination to, slavery. In this struggle the Master emerges as Master because he does not fear death since he does not see his identity dependent on life, while the slave out of this fear consents to the slavery. This experience of fear on the part of the slave is crucial, however, in a later moment of the dialectic, where it becomes the prerequisite experience for the slave's further development.  Enslavement and mastery  Truth of oneself as self-conscious is achieved only if both live; the recognition of the other gives each of them the objective truth and self- certainty required for self-consciousness. Thus, the two enter into the relation of master/slave and preserve the recognition of each other.  Contradiction and resolution  However, this state is not a happy one and does not achieve full self-consciousness. The recognition by the slave is merely on pain of death. The master's self-consciousness is dependent on the slave for recognition and also has a mediated relation with nature: the slave works with nature and begins to shape it into products for the master. As the slave creates more and more products with greater and greater sophistication through his own creativity, he begins to see himself reflected in the products he created, he realises that the world around him was created by his own hands, thus the slave is no longer alienated from his own labour and achieves self-consciousness, while the master on the other hand has become wholly dependent on the products created by his slave; thus the master is enslaved by the labour of his slave. According to Hegel's Lectures on the Philosophy of History, \\"The humankind has not liberated itself from servitude but by means of servitude\\". Philosophie der Weltgeschiche, pag.875, Lasson Edition, Leipzig 1917-20, (\\"Es ist die Menschheit nicht sowohl aus der Knechtschaft befreit worden, als vielmehr durch die Knechtschaft\\".  Conclusions  One interpretation of this dialectic is that neither a slave nor a master can be considered as fully self-conscious. A person who has already achieved self- consciousness could be enslaved, so self-consciousness must be considered not as an individual achievement, or an achievement of natural and genetic evolution, but as a social phenomenon.Philip Moran, Hegel and the Fundamental Problems of Philosophy, Holland: Gr√ºner, 1988. As philosopher Robert Brandom explains: > Hegel's discussion of the dialectic of the Master and Slave is an attempt to > show that asymmetric recognitive relations are metaphysically defective, > that the norms they institute aren't the right kind to help us think and act > with--to make it possible for us to think and act. Asymmetric recognition in > this way is authority without responsibility, on the side of the Master, and > responsibility without authority, on the side of the Slave. And Hegel's > argument is that unless authority and responsibility are commensurate and > reciprocal, no actual normative statuses are instituted. This is one of his > most important and certainly one of his deepest ideas, though it's not so > easy to see just how the argument works.Robert Brandom, Interview, Summer > 2008. Video. Transcript. Alexandre Koj√®ve's unique interpretation differs from this. His reading of the lord-bondsman dialectic substituted Hegel's epistemological figures with anthropological subjects to explain how history is defined by the struggle between masters and slaves. For Koj√®ve, people are born and history began with the first struggle, which ended with the first masters and slaves. A person is always either master or slave; and there are no real humans where there are no masters and slaves. Prior to this struggle, he maintained that the two forces are in animal state or what Hegel called as natural existence but only the slave would remain in the animal state afterwards. Koj√®ve argued that, in order to end this interaction, both must be dialectically overcome. For the slave, it requires revolutionary transformation or the negation of the world as it is given. In the process, he does not only transforms himself but also the world by creating new conditions. History comes to an end when the difference between master and slave ends, when the master ceases to be master because there are no more slaves and the slave ceases to be a slave because there are no more masters. A synthesis takes place between master and slave: the integral citizen of the universal and homogenous state created by Napoleon.Alexandre Koj√®ve, Introduction √† la lecture de Hegel, France: Gallimard, 1947. Translated as Introduction to the Reading of Hegel, New York: Basic Books, 1969. Influence The master and slave relationship influenced numerous discussions and ideas in the 20th century, especially because of its supposed connection to Karl Marx's conception of class struggle as the motive force of social development.. Hegel's master‚Äìslave dialectic has been influential in the social sciences, philosophy, literary studies, critical theory, postcolonial studies and in psychoanalysis.Julia Borossa and Caroline Rooney, \\"Suffering, Transience and Immortal Longings: Salom√© Between Nietzsche and Freud,\\" Journal of European Studies 33(3/4): 287-304 London, 2003. Furthermore, Hegel's master‚Äìslave trope, and particularly the emphasis on recognition, has been of crucial influence on Martin Buber's relational schema in I and Thou, Simone de Beauvoir's account of the history and dynamics of gender relations in The Second Sex A \\"five-stage model\\" of the master-slave dialectic, inflected through de Beauvoir's classic work can be found here and Frantz Fanon's description of the colonial relation in Black Skin, White Masks.Frantz Fanon, Black Skin, White Masks, New York: Grove Press, 1967: 62. Susan Buck-Morss's article Hegel and Haiti argues that the Haitian revolution influenced Hegel's writing of his slave-master dialectic.

Ulcerative colitis is a form of colitis, a disease of the intestine, specifically the large intestine or colon, that includes characteristic ulcers, or open sores, in the colon. The main symptom of active disease is usually diarrhea mixed with blood, of gradual onset which often leads to anaemia. Ulcerative colitis is, however, a systemic disease that affects many parts of the body outside the intestine. Medications Standard treatment for ulcerative colitis depends on extent of involvement and disease severity. The goal is to induce remission initially with medications, followed by the administration of maintenance medications to prevent a relapse of the disease. The concept of induction of remission and maintenance of remission is very important. The medications used to induce and maintain a remission somewhat overlap, but the treatments are different. Physicians first direct treatment to inducing a remission which involves relief of symptoms and mucosal healing of the lining of the colon and then longer term treatment to maintain the remission. Anaemia, caused by both chronic blood loss from the gastrointestinal tract and reduced absorption due to the up-regulation of hepcidin should also be treated, and this often requires the use of parenteral iron. The following sections are sorted first by drug type and, second, by the type of ulcerative colitis: Aminosalicylates Aminosalicylates are the main anti-inflammatory drugs used to treat ulcerative colitis. Sometimes remission can be achieved, or at least maintained, with these drugs alone. If not, they are usually used in combination with the drugs listed in the ensuing sections. The anti- inflammatory action in all these drugs is produced by 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), the active ingredient in Mesalazine. 5-ASA is produced from the other drugs in the intestine. The aminosalicylates used to treat ulcerative colitis include the following: *Mesalazine, also known as 5-aminosalicylic acid, mesalamine, or 5-ASA. Brand names include: Asacol, Octasa, Pentasa, Salofalk, Lialda, Ipocol, Apriso, and Mezavant. *Sulfasalazine, also known as Azulfidine. This drug is in a traditional class of antibiotics, but decomposes in the intestine, releasing 5-ASA. *Balsalazide, also known as Colazal, intended to release 5-ASA only in the large intestine. *Olsalazine, also known as Dipentum, intended to release 5-ASA only in the large intestine. 5-ASA is poorly-absorbed by the intestines, and hence provides topical relief within the intestine. It is therefore a non-systemic drug. 5-ASA is related to the systemic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as Aspirin and Ibuprofen. The free radical induction theory, discussed below, proposes that 5-ASA is serving not just as an anti-inflammatory agent, but also as a free radical trap, destroying the hydroxyl and other radicals that may damage colonic epithelial barrier. 5-ASA may also be an inhibitor of TNF. =Sulfasalazine side-effects= Possible side effects of 5-ASA include, nausea and vomiting, reduced sperm count and damage to red or white blood cells, or to the liver, kidneys, pancreas, nerves or hearing. Allergic reactions to sulfasalazine characterized by dizziness, fever and skin rash have been reported in a small percentage of patients. In some cases, sulfasalazine can exacerbate ulcerative colitis resulting in diarahea, abdominal cramps and discomfort. In the intestine sulfasalazine is converted to 5-ASA and sulfapyridine, which is responsible for some of its side-effects, and which should be monitored in patients taking sulfasalazine. Sulfapyridine levels above 50 ¬µg/L are associated with the side-effects. Patients on high dose sulfasalazine require folic supplementation (1 mg/day) (1000 ¬µg/day) to maintain normal cell division. This may, however, be counter-productive for patients who are also taking methotrexate, which is a folic acid inhibitor. Folic acid might also be counter-productive for patients taking 6-MP and related drugs that inhibit all cell division. Corticosteroids It is often necessary to use Corticosteroids in conjunction with 5-ASA drugs to bring about remission of ulcerative colitis. Thereafter it may be possible to maintain remission with 5-ASAs alone, though many patients require other, stronger immunosuppressive medications. Corticosteroids should not be used for long-term therapy of UC, particularly without the concomitant use of an immunomodulator or anti-TNF. Corticosteroids reduce inflammation by blocking portions of the leukocyte adhesion cascade which results in inflammation. Side effects of corticosteroids include Cushing's syndrome, which most often exhibits itself as temporary facial puffyness, called \\"moon face\\". Cushing's syndrome can, however, involve psychosis, including manic behavior. These drugs have been known to trigger bipolar disorder. In prescribing these drugs it might be well to inquire as to any family history of bipolar disorder. Corticosteroids should not be confused with anabolic steroids, the controversial performance-building \\"steroids\\" that are banned in certain sports. The following corticosteroids are used as immune system suppressants in treatment of ulcerative colitis: *Cortisone *Prednisone *Hydrocortisone *Methylprednisolone *Budesonide, also known as Entocort, available for oral use or as an enema. Budesonide is metabolized faster than traditional steroids and appears to produce fewer systemic side effects. Immunosuppressive drugs Immunosuppressive drugs inhibit the immune system generally. These include the cytostatic drugs that inhibit cell division, including the cloning of white blood cells that is a part of the immune response. Immunosuppressive drugs used with ulcerative colitis include: *Mercaptopurine, also known as 6-Mercaptopurine, 6-MP and Purinethiol. *Azathioprine, also known as Imuran (US) or Azasan, which metabolises to 6-MP. *Methotrexate, which inhibits folic acid. Mercaptopurine is a cytostatic drug that is an antimetabolite. The mercaptopurine molecule mimics purine, which is necessary for the synthesis of DNA. With mercaptopurine present, cells are not able to make DNA, and cell division is inhibited. In administering mercaptopurine it is necessary to monitor the levels of mercaptopurine metabolites in the blood to establish the correct dosage for a patient. An initial concern is hepatotoxicity. Mercaptopurine inhibits the production of white blood cells generally. Because this makes the body more susceptible to infection, patients need to watch for infections. Vaccinations are critically important, particularly the yearly flu shot and periodic pneumonia immunizations. Vaccine response is best if given prior to initiation of immunosuppressive medications, and patients on immunosuppressives should use caution when receiving vaccines containing live virus. Frequent blood cell counts are also recommended during administration of mercaptopurine. The drug may be toxic to bone marrow, where many blood components are made. If there is an abnormally large drop in white blood cell count, or any blood cell count, administration of the drug should be halted at least temporarily. Methotrexate is another immunosuppressive drug. It works by inhibiting folic acid, which is necessary for DNA replication and, therefore, cell division. TNF inhibitors TNF is a protein that is released by activated white blood cells, triggering more inflammation, an immune system response and more damage to the mucosa of the colon because of the immune activation. Certain drugs inhibit TNF, hence reducing inflammation and immune system involvement. Infliximab was approved by the FDA for treating ulcerative colitis in March 2005. It is usually given as an intravenous infusions at weeks 0,2 and 6 and then every eight weeks thereafter. It is very useful for inducing and maintaining a remission of ulcerative colitis. Infliximab works better when used in combination with immunmodulators such as 6-mercaptopurine or azathioprine, but a corresponding increase in adverse events means that the decision to use one drug or two must be based on an individualized discussion between the patient and their doctor. *Infliximab *Humira *Amgevita (biosimilar) Treatment of complications=Proctitis Proctitis is an inflammation of the anus and the lining of the rectum, usually involving the distal, or lower, of the colon, including the rectum. Approximately 30% of ulcerative colitis patients initially present with proctitis. Standard treatment for active disease includes Mesalazine suppositories and cortisone foam (Cortifoam). Mesalazine 1 g SUPP QHS or Cortifoam QHS/BID is continued until remission, with response seen usually within three weeks. Maintenance therapy is with Mesalazine 1g QHS or Q3HS. Those with anal irritation or discomfort from the suppositories may switch to oral medications, such as sulfasalazine, Mesalazine, or Colazol, although they are not as effective as suppositories for proctitis. Maintenance therapy is not recommended for those with a first episode that responded to the Mesalazine. Steroid foam is not shown to prevent relapse. Systemic steroids such as prednisone are not used unless proctitis fails to respond to the above treatments. Proctosigmoiditis and left-sided colitis Proctosigmoiditis and left- sided colitis involves the lower colon, from the rectum up the left side of the patient. Patients often respond to topical agents alone, such as Mesalazine, or hydrocortisone enemas. Again, the Mesalazine is preferred for maintenance therapy. *Initially a 4 g Mesalazine enema (Rowasa) is given nightly. *If response is seen, the enemas can be tapered to every third night. *If no response, a morning Mesalazine, or hydrocortisone enema (Cortenema) can be given. *If still no response, oral anti-inflammatory drugs, with or without enemas, can be given, such as sulfasalazine, Mesalazine (Asacol, Pentasa), olsalazine (Dipentum), or balsalazide (Colazal). *If still no response, dose should be increased to maximum: sulfasalazine maxes at 4-6 g/day, Mesalazine maxes at 4.8 g/day, and olsalazine at 3 g/day. They are usually divided tid or bid. Oral anti-inflammatory drugs require four to six weeks to work. Once remission is induced, maintenance levels can be used: sulfasalazine 2 g/day, mesalamine 1.2-2.4 g/day, or olsalazine 1 g/day. Patients on high dose sulfasalazine require folic supplementation (1 mg/day) because it inhibits folate absorption. If oral Mesalazine is still not working, prednisone is often given, starting at 40‚Äì60 mg/day. Prednisone often takes effect within 10‚Äì14 days. The dose should then be tapered by about 5 mg/week until it can be stopped altogether. Extensive or pancolitis Extensive or pancolitis. Patients usually require a combination of oral Mesalazine or sulfasalazine along with topical Mesalazine or steroid enemas. Oral prednisone (40‚Äì60 mg/day) should be given only in severe cases or if oral Mesalazine fails. Once remission is induced, maintenance therapy is with standard oral Mesalazine doses. Supplemental iron (ferrous sulfate or ferrous gluconate) may be given due to chronic blood loss. Loperamide may be given for symptomatic relief of chronic diarrhea, but should not be given in suspected toxic megacolon. Severe or fulminant colitis Severe or fulminant colitis. Patients need to be hospitalized immediately with subsequent bowel rest, nutrition, and IV steroids. Typical starting choices are hydrocortisone 100 mg IV q8h, prednisolone 30 mg IV q12h, or methylprednisolone 16‚Äì20 mg IV q8h. The last two are preferred due to less sodium retention and potassium wasting. 24-hour continuous infusion is preferred than the stated dosing. If the patient has not had any corticosteroids within the last 30 days, IV ACTH 120 units/day as continuous infusion is superior than the IV steroids mentioned above. In either case, if symptoms persist after 2‚Äì3 days, Mesalazine or hydrocortisone enemas daily or bid can be given. The use of antibiotics in those with severe colitis is not clear. However, there are those patients who have sub-optimal response to corticosteroids and continue to run a low grade fever with bandemia. Typically they can be treated with IV ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. However, in those with fulminant colitis or megacolon, with high fever, leukocytosis with high bandemia, and peritoneal signs, broad spectrum antibiotics should be given (i.e., ceftazidime, cefepime, imipeneum, meropenem, etc.). Abdominal x-ray should also be ordered. If intestinal dilation is seen, patients should be decompressed with NG tube and or rectal tube. Refractory ulcerative colitis Refractory ulcerative colitis. Patients with toxic megacolon (colonic dilation > 6 cm and toxic appearing) who do not respond to steroid therapy within 72 hours should be consulted for colectomy. Those with less severe disease but do not respond to IV steroids within 7‚Äì10 days should be considered for colectomy or IV cyclosporine. IV cyclosporine at a rate of 2 mg/kg/day and if no response in 7‚Äì10 days, colectomy should be considered. If response is seen, oral cyclosporine at 8 mg/kg/day should be continued for 3‚Äì4 months while 6-MP or azathioprine is introduced. Those already on 6-MP or azathioprine should continue with these medications. A cholesterol level should be checked in patients taking cyclosporine as low cholesterol may predispose to seizures. Also, prophylaxis against PCP (Pneumocystis carinii) pneumonia is advised. Surgery Unlike Crohn's disease, which cannot be cured/eliminated by surgically removing the diseased portions of the intestine and reconnecting the healthy ends, ulcerative colitis can generally be cured by surgical removal of the large intestine. Surgical removal of the large intestine will not get rid of extra- intestinal symptoms. This procedure is necessary in the event of exsanguinating hemorrhage, frank perforation, or documented or strongly suspected carcinoma. Surgery is also indicated for patients with severe colitis or toxic megacolon. Patients with symptoms that are disabling and do not respond to drugs may wish to consider whether surgery would improve the quality of life. Depending on the type of surgery performed, the patient may still require periodic lower endoscopies to assess the pouch for dysplasia. Ulcerative colitis is a disease that affects many parts of the body outside the intestinal tract. In rare cases the extra-intestinal manifestations of the disease may require removal of the colon.Ulcerative Colitis Practice Guidelines in Adults, Am. Coll. Gastroenterology, 2004. PDF Alternative treatments=Dietary modification There is no good evidence that dietary interventions have any impact on ulcerative colitis. Fats and oils * Fish oil, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is not conclusive. *Slow release phosphatidylcholine has some evidence of benefit in ulcerative colitis. Antioxidants The free radical induction theory suggests that the initial cause of ulcerative colitis may be a metabolic defect that allows a buildup of chemicals related to hydrogen peroxide beneath the membrane that protects the cells of the intestinal wall from the bacteria inside the intestine, resulting in destruction of the membrane. During remission the membrane is reestablished, but may be subject to new damage, resulting in a flare up of the disease. To the extent this may be true, it would be appropriate to take antioxidants, dietary supplements that may support the body's defenses against oxidants like hydrogen peroxide. Antioxidants include: * Vitamins A, C and E * Coenzyme Q10 * Selenium and manganese. Vitamin B6 and iron may be associated with increased hydrogen peroxide levels, and should not be taken in excess under this theory. * S-Methylmethionine has been shown in animal models to reverse ulcers. Helminthic therapy Inflammatory bowel disease is less common in the developing world and it has been suggested that this may be because intestinal parasites are more common in underdeveloped countries. Some parasites are able to reduce the immune response of the intestine, an adaptation that helps the parasite colonize the intestine. A decrease in immune response could be helpful in inflammatory bowel disease. Helminthic therapy using the whipworm Trichuris suis was shown in a randomized control trial to produce benefit in patients with ulcerative colitis. This therapy tests the hygiene hypothesis which argues that the absence of helminths in the colons of patients in the western world may lead to inflammation. Both helminthic therapy and fecal bacteriotherapy induce a characteristic Th2 white cell response in the diseased areas, which is somewhat paradoxical given that ulcerative colitis immunology was thought to classically involve Th2 overproduction.

He also published a collection of short stories entitled Thedi, for which he received the National Book Development Council‚Äôs award in 1992. In 1977 in Singapore, he initiated the Ilakkiya Kalam (Literary Critics' Circle) which gathered and analysed the best stories of the period and subsequently a collection of the best short stories of 1977 was published in 1981. He also published a novelette, Velvi. In 1994, he was awarded the S.E.A. Write Award. His untimely demise in 1999 is considered a huge loss to the Tamil society in Singapore and around the world.

A ballad of this title was licensed in 1564. Versions of this ballad also exist outside the Child collection. Additional copies can be found at the British Library, the University of Glasgow Library, and the Pepys Library at Magdalene College. These ballads dates, by estimation of the English Short Title Catalogue, range from the early seventeenth century to as late as 1775. The ballad is most recognized by its opening line: \\"In summer time, when leaves grow green.\\" Child describes the appeal of this ballad to be centered on the chance meeting with a King, which is also a recurring theme in tales of Robin Hood. Synopsis King Edward, while hunting, espies a tanner riding a mare with a cowhide for a saddle. He tells his men to stay back and goes to ask directions to the town of Drayton Bassett. The tanner offers wrong directions, but Edward knows them to be wrong; then Edward invites the tanner to dine with him in Drayton Bassett. The tanner responds that he has no need of charity; he has more pounds in his purse than the stranger has pence in his. Furthermore, he suspects the stranger of having stolen the lordly raiment he is wearing. Edward asks the tanner for news. The tanner replies that he has heard nothing save that cowhides are in great demand. Edward then asks to switch horses with the tanner. The tanner replies that he'll do the trade but only for a gold noble (80d). Edward, amused, gives him twenty groats (80d), which raises the tanner's opinion of him a bit. The tanner hands over his mare, throws the cowhide over the king's gilt saddle, and tries to ride home; but the cowhide spooks the king's steed and it throws the tanner onto the ground. The tanner indignantly demands his mare back. Edward, laughing, replies that he'll do the trade but only for a gold noble. The tanner graciously hands Edward not only his original twenty groats but also twenty more, and invites him to share a drink. Edward then summons his hunting party from over the hill. The tanner first takes them for a band of outlaws, and then (when he realizes Edward's true identity) trembles in fear of royal punishment; but Edward instead thanks the tanner for his entertainment and for his hospitality, and bestows on him Plumpton Park with its three tenements, worth 300 pounds a year. The tanner, not to be outdone, tells Edward that if the king should ever visit his little shop in Tamworth, he can have his shoes re-leathered for free. Tune Though no specific tune is listed on any of the ballads‚Äîinstead it reads: \\"To an Excellent new Tune\\"‚Äîit is likely the ballad was sung to the tune, \\"In Summer time,\\" which, again, was also often set to Robin Hood ballads. Notes Plumpton Park is also mentioned in A Gest of Robyn Hode (Child ballad 117) as a place that Edward (in this case, likely Edward II\\"A Search for Robin Hood.\\" In Chambers's Edinburgh Journal, number 452, 28 August 1852.

P. Lovecraft. Written in November 1922, it was first published in the January through April 1923 issues of Home Brew. Plot=I. The Shadow on the Chimney In 1921, an unnamed reporter and local monster-hunter travels to Tempest Mountain, in the Catskills range, after reports of various attacks by a group of unidentified creatures against the local inhabitants reaches the media. A month before, a massive thunderstorm, even larger than the ones which usually plague the region, had drifted across the mountains, and brought with it destruction. The next morning, many homes were destroyed, seemingly by the storm, but upon closer inspection, the destruction seemed to be left by an enraged beast. The affected area, originally home to only 75 citizens, was completely destroyed, leaving no survivors. Gathering what information he can from the locals, he finds out that most of the legends surround the foreboding Martense mansion, a century-old Dutch homestead, which has been disregarded by the police as it's apparently abandoned. The narrator, bringing with him two companions as his bodyguards, enters the mansion at night, just when another thunderstorm approaches, and takes up residence in the room of Jan Martense, a member of the family believed to have been murdered. The mansion is completely deserted, but the narrator and his friends take precautions and plan several methods of escape, in case they are attacked during the night by whatever force haunts the house. Despite their careful preparation, keeping watch in shifts and sleeping armed, the group eventually drift off to sleep. The narrator wakes up to discover both his companions missing and, in a flash of lightning, witnesses a demonic shadow briefly cast upon the mansion's chimney by a grotesque monster. Neither of his companions are ever seen again. II. A Passer in the Storm Traumatized by the disappearance of his two friends, and the disturbing shadow he viewed in the fireplace, the narrator continues his investigation. He befriends another reporter named Arthur Munroe, and tells him of the things he has experienced so far. Munroe agrees to help him, and the two scour across the countryside for any clues to the murderous creature or possible remains of the Martenses. There is no trace of the mysterious family, but they manage to uncover an ancestral diary which once belonged to them. All the while, the narrator has the constant feeling of being watched. However, he and Arthur are trapped by yet another thunderstorm, and seek shelter in an abandoned cabin, where the narrator thinks back of the horrible events back at the mansion. As an unusually large thunderbolt clashes across the sky, Munroe walks over to the window to survey the damage, and the storm soon clears up. However, Munroe doesn't move from the window, and when the narrator tries to rouse him, he finds his face hideously gnawed away by some unseen horror outside. III. What the Red Glare Meant The story now skips to several months later, as the narrator returns to Tempest Mountain, determined to solve the mystery once and for all. He never told anyone what happened to Arthur Munroe, having buried his body in the woods and told everyone that he had simply wandered off and disappeared in the wilderness. Now convinced that the horror plaguing the mountain is connected to the Martense family, the narrator believes it to be the ghost of Jan Martense, and has spent the past weeks studying up on the family's history. The mansion was built by Gerrit Martense, a Dutch merchant from New Amsterdam who disliked the British Empire taking over the North American colonies, and constructed the mansion in 1670 in the remote woods to take advantage of its solitude. There, Martense raised his descendants to loathe both the British and the colonial society as he did. Soon, the isolated and secluded family grew increasingly insular. Most notable about them, aside from their sour and unpleasant behavior, was a hereditary eye-trait, having one blue and one brown iris. With their connection to the outside world all but severed, the family soon grew to intermarrying with the various squatters and servants living around the estate. The resulting offspring would spread out across the valley and eventually became the current population of mountain men, but the core family stuck to their mansion, becoming increasingly clan-like and insular. Jan Martense, struck by an unusual restlessness, had joined the colonial army, and he was the only source of information on the rest of the family that had ever reached the outside world. However, upon returning home six years later, he found himself treated as an outsider, and he made plans to leave, which he told a friend about in letters. These letters soon stopped however, and when his friend arrived to the mansion in 1763, he was told that Jan had died after getting struck by lightning during one of the mountain's wild thunderstorms. Jan's friend did not believe this, especially due to the Martenses disturbing and cold behavior, and exhumed the grave. Jan's remains made the cause of death all too obvious - his skull had been crushed by a savage blow. Though the Martenses were not convicted of murder due to lack of evidence, this was the last straw, and the family was completely shunned by their neighbors. The Martenses soon disappeared entirely, the only signs of their continued existence being an occasional light seen in the windows of the mansion, which was last seen in 1810. In 1816, a posse searched the mansion, but found no trace of the Martenses, who had seemingly disappeared. The mansion itself was in complete disarray, and had several improvised additions, as it seemed like the family had kept expanding, presumably through inbreeding. The narrator finds his way to the mansion, and digs up Jan Martense's grave, hoping to find some way of setting his spirit to rest, but instead falls through the ground into a mysterious burrow. There, he briefly encounters a goblin-like creature lurking in the shadows, which he views through the light of his gas-lamp. A sudden lightning-strike hits the tunnel, allowing the narrator to quickly escape, where he sees a distant red glare. Only days later, does he find out what the glare is - a burning cabin with one of the creatures inside. IV. The Horror in the Eyes Returning to Jan's grave, he finds that the burrow he previously fell into has completely caved-in, and all traces of what he had found there are gone. Instead, he decides to investigate the strange mounds which surround the mansion, and its connection to the creature. While observing from afar, he realizes that the mounds are in fact tunnels made by the creatures, and that the entire hillside along with the mansion must be honeycombed with monstrous passages. Struck by mania, he digs his way into one of the tunnels through the mansion's cellar, and finds a catacomb-like system of both nests and tunnels. As another thunderstorm approaches, the narrator hides, and sees countless creatures emerge from the ground. The narrator then sees one of the weaker members of the grotesque mob get attacked and eaten by one of its compatriots. He shoots one of the creatures as it straggles behind the rest of the pack, using a clap of thunder to disguise the muzzle blast. Soon, upon closer inspection, he notices the creature's heterochromia and realizes that the deformed, hair-covered creature is in fact a member of the Martense family, who have devolved into hideous ape-like beasts thanks to centuries of isolation and inbreeding. The narrator remembers nothing more, until he wakes up some time later in a nearby village. Thoroughly traumatized by his experiences, the narrator has the mansion, surrounding woods, and hillside destroyed with explosives, but is never able to heal his mind from the horrors that he experienced, always fearing that one of the Martense creatures may have survived. Characters *The narrator: The unnamed narrator describes himself as \\"a connoisseur in horrors\\", one whose \\"love of the grotesque and the terrible... has made my career a series of quests for strange horrors in literature and in life.\\" He reports that following his encounter with the Martense creatures, \\"I cannot see a well or a subway entrance without shuddering\\"‚Äîan example of the phobias that often afflict Lovecraft's protagonists as a result of their experiences. *George Bennett and William Tobey: Described by the narrator as \\"two faithful and muscular men...long associated with me in my ghastly explorations because of their peculiar fitness.\\" *Arthur Munroe: A reporter who comes to the village of Lefferts Corners to cover the lurking fear, he is described as \\"a dark, lean man of about thirty-five, whose education, taste, intelligence, and temperament all seemed to mark him as one not bound to conventional ideas and experiences.\\" :The name Munroe may derive from Lovecraft's childhood friends, the brothers Chester and Harold Munroe. Harold had gotten back in touch with Lovecraft a little more than a year before \\"The Lurking Fear\\" was written, and they had revisited a clubhouse they had constructed together as boys.Joshi and Schultz, pp. 160, 175-176. *Gerrit Martense: Gerrit Martense is \\"a wealthy New-Amsterdam merchant who disliked the changing order under British rule\\". He built the Martense mansion in 1670 \\"on a remote woodland summit whose untrodden solitude and unusual scenery pleased him.\\" His descendants, who are \\"reared in hatred of the English civilization, and trained to shun such of the colonists as accepted it,\\" are distinguished by having one brown and one blue eye. :Martense is an old New Amsterdam name; there is a Martense Street in Flatbush, Brooklyn, near Sonia Greene's apartment where Lovecraft stayed in April 1922.Joshi and Schultz, pp. 59, 160. *Jan Martense: Jan Martense is \\"the first of Gerrit's descendants to see much of the world\\"; he joins the colonial army in 1754, after hearing of the Albany Congress, a meeting that attempted to unite the North American colonies. When he returns to the Martense mansion in 1760, he is treated as an outsider by his family; he finds he can no longer \\"share the peculiarities and prejudices of the Martenses, while the very mountain thunderstorms failed to intoxicate him as they had before.\\" When a friend looks for him in 1763, his relatives say that he had been struck by lightning and killed the previous autumn; when the friend, suspicious, digs up Jan's unmarked grave, he discovers \\"a skull crushed cruelly as if by savage blows.\\" Though acquitted of his murder, the Martenses are ostracized and the mansion appears to have been abandoned by 1810. Investigators in 1816 found the place more like an animal's den than a stately manor. :The Jans Martense Schenck house in Flatbush, built 1656, is the oldest surviving house in New York City.Joshi and Schultz, p. 160.

It is considered to be a late intimation of Nash's development of the Italianate style. Commissioned by the dowager Lady Ashburton as a country retreat, this small country house clearly shows the transition between the picturesque of William Gilpin and Nash's yet to be fully evolved Italianism. While this house can still be described as Regency, its informal asymmetrical plan together with its loggias and balconies of both stone and wrought iron; tower and low pitched roof clearly are very similar to the fully Italianate design of Cronkhill.

P. Lovecraft, written on October 16‚Äì19, 1924. It was first published in the October 1937 issue of Weird Tales. Inspiration 135 Benefit Street, Providence, Rhode Island The Shunned House of the title is based on an actual house in Providence, Rhode Island, built around 1763 and still standing at 135 Benefit Street. Lovecraft was familiar with the house because his aunt Lillian Clark lived there in 1919/20 as a companion to Mrs. H. C. Babbit.S. T. Joshi, More Annotated Lovecraft, p. 107. However, it was another house in Elizabeth, New Jersey that actually compelled Lovecraft to write the story. As he wrote in a letter: Plot Original illustration by Virgil Finlay accompanying the publication in Weird Tales (October 1937, volume 30, issue 4). For many years, the narrator and his uncle, Dr. Elihu Whipple, have nurtured a fascination with an old abandoned house on Benefit Street. Dr. Whipple has made extensive records tracking the mysterious, yet apparently coincidental, sickness and death of many who have lived in the house for over one hundred years. They are also puzzled by the strange weeds growing in the yard, as well as an unexplained foul smell and whitish phosphorescent fungi growing in the cellar. There, the narrator discovers a strange, yellowish vapour in the basement, which seems to be coupled with a moldy outline of a huddled human form on the floor. The narrator and his uncle decide to spend the night in the house, investigating the possibility of some supernatural force. They set up both cots and chairs in the cellar, arm themselves with military flamethrowers, and outfit a modified Crookes tube in the hopes of destroying any supernatural presence they might find. When Dr. Whipple naps, he tosses and turns and starts babbling in French until he suddenly awakes. He tells the narrator that he had strange visions of lying in an open pit, inside a house with constantly shifting features, while faces stared down at him. Many of the faces were those of the Harris family, whose members died in the house. When the narrator sleeps, he is awakened by a horrific scream. He sees a revolting yellowish \\"corpse-light\\" bubbling up from the floor, which stares at him with many eyes before vanishing in a wisp through the chimney. He finds his uncle transformed into a monster with \\"blackened, decaying features\\" and dripping claws. He turns on the Crookes tube, but seeing that it has no effect, escapes the house through the cellar door as his uncle's body dissolves, transforming into a multitude of faces of those who died in the house as it melts. The narrator returns the next day to find his equipment intact, but no body. The narrator hatches a plan. He orders a military gas mask, digging tools, and six carboys of sulfuric acid to be delivered to the cellar door of the house. He digs into the earthen floor of the cellar, turning up fungous yellow ooze, and arranges the barrels of acid around the hole in the belief that he will happen upon some kind of monstrous creature. Eventually, he uncovers a soft, blue-white, translucent tube, bent in half and two feet in diameter at its widest point. He frantically climbs out of the neck-deep hole, and dumps in four barrels of acid, realizing that he had found the elbow of a gigantic monster. The narrator faints after emptying the fourth barrel. When he awakens, the narrator empties the two remaining barrels, to no effect, replaces the dirt, and finds that the strange fungus has turned to harmless ash. He mourns his uncle, but is relieved to be sure that the horrible creature is finally dead. The narrator records that the house has subsequently been rented to another family, and that the house now appears completely normal. Characters *Elihu Whipple: Described as \\"a sane, conservative physician of the old school...a bachelor; a white-haired, clean-shaven, old-fashioned gentleman, and a local historian of note.\\" Peter Cannon writes that Whipple \\"is probably a composite portrait of Lovecraft's two learned uncles-in-law and maternal grandfather\\"; the grandfather's name was Whipple Phillips.Peter Cannon, \\"Introduction\\", More Annotated Lovecraft, p. 5. *Etienne Roulet: A Huguenot from Caude, near Angers, France, who settled in East Greenwich, Rhode Island in 1686 and moved to Providence in 1696; the Shunned House was built on the site of his family's graveyard. According to the story, \\"The family of Roulet had possessed an abnormal affinity for outer circles of entity ‚Äî dark spheres which for normal folk hold only repulsion and terror.\\" Etienne is said to have been \\"apt...at reading queer books and drawing queer diagrams.\\" His son, Paul Roulet, is described as a \\"surly fellow\\" of \\"erratic conduct\\"; \\"old wives\\" intimated that \\"his prayers were neither uttered at the proper time nor directed at the proper object.\\" The story's narrator suspects that the family is connected to Jacques Roulet of Caude, who was condemned to death for lycanthropy in 1598 before being confined to an asylum. Jacques Roulet was a real person, whom Lovecraft had read about in John Fiske's Myths and Myth- Makers.S. T. Joshi, More Annotated Lovecraft, p. 106. Publication \\"The Shunned House\\", with an introduction by Frank Belknap Long, was to have been Lovecraft's first published book. Approximately 250 copies were printed in 1928 by W. Paul Cook for Recluse Press. However, the sheets were not bound at that time. Approximately 150 sets of unbound sheets eventually found their way into the possession of Arkham House in 1959, where they were offered for sale in an unbound state. About 50 copies were sold in that state, simply folded and with no cover. Derleth had the remaining 100 copies bound as an official publication of Arkham House and offered for sale in 1961. The book was not jacketed and contains the Arkham House imprint only on the spine. The genuine item, watermarked \\"Canterbury,\\" is the rarest book associated with Arkham House (several variants exist involving the copyright notice). It is considered the \\"holy grail\\" for Arkham House collectors (discounting the hardback state of Arkham House: The First 20 Years as well as the first printing of the second Arkham House edition of \\"The Shunned House\\" in 2008 which had a print run of only 67 copies and is now likewise out of print). However, forgeries of the bound 1961 Shunned House exist in various states; most have the watermark 'Chantry' and some are in red boards and have the spine printed in European from bottom to top, unlike the Arkham House version.

Opperman, 428 U.S. 364 (1976), elaborated on the community caretaking doctrine. Under the Fourth Amendment, \\"unreasonable\\" searches and seizures are forbidden. In addition to their law enforcement duties, the police must engage in what the Court has termed a community caretaking role, including such duties as removing obstructions from roadways in order to ensure the free flow of traffic. When the police act in this role, they may inventory cars they have seized without \\"unreasonably\\" searching those cars. Facts of the Case Opperman's car was found illegally parked on a street in Vermillion, South Dakota, in the early morning hours of December 10, 1973. Acting pursuant to police procedures, Opperman's car was impounded. Because there were sundry items scattered about in the passenger cabin, the police decided to inventory the contents of the car. During the inventory, police found some marijuana in the glove compartment. When Opperman came to the police station to claim his property, he was arrested for possession of marijuana. At trial, he asked to suppress the marijuana, but the trial court denied his request. Opperman was sentenced to 14 days in jail and fined $100. He appealed, and the Supreme Court of South Dakota reversed his conviction on the grounds that the inventory search was an unreasonable one under the Fourth Amendment. At South Dakota's request, the Supreme Court agreed to review the case. Inventory Searches Are Reasonable By the time of Opperman, a distinction had emerged in Fourth Amendment jurisprudence between searches of the home and searches of automobiles. Because automobiles were inherently mobile, typically kept outside the home, and subject to regulation and licensing by state and local governments, the law recognized a diminished expectation of privacy in an automobile relative to the expectation of privacy a person has in his home. The Court had also recognized that in addition to their law enforcement duties, the police engage in a community caretaking function. \\"To permit the uninterrupted flow of traffic and in some circumstances to preserve evidence, disabled or damaged vehicles will often be removed from the highways or streets at the behest of police engaged solely in caretaking and traffic-control activities. Police will also frequently remove and impound automobiles which violate parking ordinances and which thereby jeopardize both the public safety and the efficient movement of vehicular traffic.\\" The police typically follow established standardized procedures when impounding vehicles for these reasons. These procedures protect the owner's property from vandalism, protect the police from disputes about damage to the property, and protect individual officers from unknown danger associated with vehicle storage. By the time of the Opperman decision, a number of state and federal courts had already sustained these practices against challenges that they engendered \\"unreasonable\\" searches and seizures that violate the Fourth Amendment. In other words, by the time of the Opperman decision, numerous lower courts had already reached a consensus that \\"when the police take custody of any sort of container [such as] an automobile... it is reasonable to search the container to itemize the property to be held by the police. [This reflects] the underlying principle that the fourth amendment proscribes only unreasonable searches.\\"United States v. Gravitt, 484 F.2d 375, 378 (5th Cir. 1973). Inventory searches of automobiles must necessarily extend to the trunk and the glove compartment, since these are places where people keep important documents and valuables. Accordingly, the Court had little trouble concluding that these inventory searches did not violate the Fourth Amendment. It would be incongruous to allow the police the authority to hold the car itself but deny them the authority to search inside it. Furthermore, the Court had already sanctioned an inventory search of an impounded car suspected to contain the service revolver of a fugitive Chicago police officer.Cady v. Dombrowski, . The search in this case was conducted according to standard police procedure, and there was no suggestion that the search was a pretext for an investigation. Thus, the search here was reasonable as well. Balancing the Interests of Society and of the Individual Justice Powell believed that the Fourth Amendment required a balancing of the interests of society against those of the individual. Balancing those interests in this case, he concluded that the search of Opperman's car was reasonable and did not require a warrant. Powell contended that there was little danger associated with impounding automobiles. On occasion, a car would contain some very dangerous item, and the police cannot know in advance which cars those might be. Furthermore, society has an interest in minimizing the number of false claims filed against the police. Yet Powell did not believe that inventories were completely effective in discouraging false claims, since an interloper could have stolen something before the police impounded the car, or the police could make a mistake in recording the contents of the car. Also, society has a great interest in the protection of property in impounded cars, because people might not be comfortable leaving valuables in their cars for several days even if they might do so for a few hours. Powell also asserted that people have a nontrivial expectation of privacy in the contents of their automobiles. But the search in this case did not invade that interest, because it was limited to an inventory of the contents and conducted according to standard procedures. For these reasons, Powell concluded that the search was reasonable and therefore did not require a warrant. To be sure, the inventory search at issue in Opperman did not fall into one of the six traditional exceptions to the warrant requirement. Because inventory searches are not intended to discover evidence of criminal activity (even though discovering such evidence might incidentally result), the abuses against which the warrant requirement is intended to protect did not arise in the case of inventory searches. Furthermore, an inventory search does not involve the exercise of discretion, as criminal investigations and certain regulatory searches do. Justice Marshall struck a different balance between the interests of society and the individual. A diminished expectation of privacy was not the same as no expectation of privacy at all. Furthermore, Marshall disputed that the three reasons the majority advanced to justify the inventory search were as compelling in this case as the majority claimed. A search of valuables does not address a concern for police safety. Looking in the glove compartment for valuables seemed excessive in light of the other legal protections afforded \\"gratuitous depositors\\" under South Dakota law. And although protecting valuables inside an impounded car is important, searching each and every impounded car without the owner's consent exceeded the owner's privacy interest. \\"One need not carry contraband to prefer that the police not examine one's private possessions.\\" Thus, Justice Marshall argued, \\"according to the Court's result the law may presume that each owner in Opperman's position consents to the search.\\" This could not be, for the law ordinarily required the police to obtain consent on a case-by-case basis. If the police were to dispense with the consent requirement, there must be a specific reason to believe that this car contained \\"particular valuable property threatened by the impoundment.\\" But Justice Marshall saw no such specific evidence in the record in this case, because the owner was apparently content to leave the car parked on the street and the other items that were in plain view did not suggest that anything of particular value would be in the glove compartment. \\"The Court's result in this case elevates the conservation of property interests--indeed mere possibilities of property interests--above the privacy and security interests protected by the Fourth Amendment.\\" See also * List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 428 ReferencesExternal links Transcript of the oral argument United States Supreme Court cases United States Fourth Amendment case law 1976 in United States case law United States Supreme Court cases of the Burger Court ","title":"South Dakota v.

It was the home of William Culbertson, who was once the richest man in Indiana. Built in 1867 at a cost of $120,000, this Second Empire-style mansion has 25-rooms within , and was completed in November 1869. It was designed by James T. Banes, a local architect. Features within the three-story edifice include hand-painted ceilings and walls, frescoed ceilings, carved rosewood-grained staircase, marble fireplaces, wallpaper of fabric-quality, and crystal chandeliers. The original tin roof was imported from Scotland. The displays within the mansion feature the Culbertson family and the restoration of the building. The rooms on the tour are the formal parlors, dining rooms, bedrooms, kitchen, and laundry room. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs. In its heyday, a railroad ran behind the house (Culbertson had sold land to the railroad), and a streetcar ran from his house towards downtown New Albany. History After Culbertson's death, he willed the home to his third wife, who auctioned off the house and contents in 1899 to John McDonald, also a resident of New Albany, for $7,100. Upon his death, the American Legion obtained it from McDonald's daughter, Mrs. Helen Croxall. The Legion would make extensive changes to the mansion, making it more suitable for a meeting place. After several different owners, in the 1960s the mansion was in danger of being torn down, in order to put in its place a gas station. Instead, a local historic group called Historic New Albany purchased the mansion in 1964 from the American Legion for $24,000.00. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974 and became a part of the Indiana State Museum and Historic Sites in 1976. The Carriage House In 1985 the tradition of having a haunted house started, and for the first two years the Mansion itself was used, using 10 people to acquire $500 as part of a Spook Run. Starting in 1987, the Carriage House of the Mansion has served as the haunted house. Today, the Haunted House requires 100 volunteers.Official Website of Haunted House The Culbertson Mansion performs historic restoration rather than renovation to protect the historical integrity of the home. The eventual goal is to return the mansion to its 1869 appearance, barring necessary newer items such as electricity and bathrooms. It is open for daily tours, Tuesday through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Funds for restoration are raised by a non-profit group called The Friends of Culbertson Mansion, Inc., as well as the staff of the mansion itself.

P. Lovecraft. Written on November 9, 1926, it was first published in the October 1931 issue of Weird Tales. It concerns a character traveling to the titular house which is perched on the top of a cliff which seems inaccessible both by land and sea, yet is apparently inhabited. Plot Thomas Olney, a \\"philosopher\\" visiting the town of Kingsport, Massachusetts with his family, is intrigued by a strange house on a cliff overlooking the ocean. It is unaccountably high and old and the locals have a generations-long dread of the place which no one is known to have visited. With great difficulty, Olney climbs the crag, approaches the house, and meets the mysterious man who lives there. The only door opens directly onto a sheer cliff, giving access only to mist and \\"the abyss\\". The transmittal of archaic lore and a life-altering encounter with the supernatural ensue, as Olney is not the only visitor that day. He returns to Kingsport the next day, but seems to have left his spirit behind in the strange, remote dwelling. Inspiration An H. P. Lovecraft Encyclopedia suggests that the story may have been inspired by Lord Dunsany's Chronicles of Rodriguez, in which strange sights can be seen from a wizard's house on a crag. One model for the setting was Mother Ann, a headland near Gloucester, Massachusetts.H. P. Lovecraft, Selected Letters Vol. 3, p. 433; cited in Joshi and Schultz, p. 253. Connections Kingsport, which is mentioned in several Lovecraft stories, first appeared in \\"The Terrible Old Man\\" (1920). The title character of that story makes an appearance in \\"The Strange High House in the Mist\\" as well, as the Old Man mentions that the House had been on the cliff even when his grandfather was a boy, which the main character comments \\"must be immeasurable ages ago\\". The story makes reference to the Celtic god Nodens, who also appears in The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath. This entity was later incorporated into the Cthulhu Mythos by August Derleth as the leader of the Elder Gods. In the same passage in \\"The Strange High House\\", Lovecraft also mentions the arrival of the god Neptune, but that Roman deity has not similarly been adopted by Lovecraftian writers. The man in the House mentions Atlantis, which was also mentioned in \\"The Temple\\" as the possible identity of the mysterious underwater city. He also mentions Hatheg-kla and Ulthar from \\"The Other Gods\\" and \\"The Cats of Ulthar\\". Reception The story was originally rejected by Weird Tales when submitted in July 1927. In 1929, Lovecraft agreed to let W. Paul Cook publish it in the second issue of The Recluse, but when it became clear that that issue would never appear, he resubmitted it to Weird Tales, which accepted it, paying him $55. Robert A. W. Lowndes called \\"The Strange High House in the Mist\\" one of Lovecraft's \\"best short stories\\".Robert A. W. Lowndes, Letter, \\"The Eyrie\\", Weird Tales, Summer 1991.

The novel has its origins in research Lewis made into trials based on circumstantial evidence, after reading in-depth about famous trials turning on circumstantial evidence, which prompted her to write a pamphlet describing the risks of using it.

She claimed her objective was to show the \\"chaos\\" which teachers must deal with in the classroom. With the use of hidden cameras, she filmed chairs being smashed, pupils fighting in class, swearing at teachers by pupils and false accusations by pupils of her touching them. The filming was done using hidden cameras in a button and a briefcase. The documentary showed children aged from 12 to 15 completely ignoring the supply teacher and other staff while they shout, scream, fight, swear, downloading porn and wandering around the classroom at will. The filming was carried out at 15 ordinary secondary schools in London and the north of England, randomly chosen by the supply agencies she contacted. None of which were considered to be failing by recent inspection reports. Controversy The National Union of Teachers condemned the programme, saying it was not fair on the children to film them secretly. The Conservative party were quick to push their message of classroom discipline and more pupil referral units for children who have been expelled from school.

Also included is the duet of \\"My Lover's Prayer\\", featuring Robin Gibb. \\"A Heart Can't Lie\\" was co-written with Louise Griffiths, a fellow Fame Academy contestant. Reviews Bring It On received mixed reviews, with some critics dismissing it as a product of manufactured reality pop, even though most of the songs had actually been written before Griffin entered the show. Despite being criticised for its bland production, Bring It On was variously described as \\"ludicrously catchy\\", \\"polished pop\\" and \\"so cheesy that it is actually cool somehow\\". Most praised the quality of the songwriting, with one reviewer commenting \\"...he has come up with a debut that is better than those of his contemporaries.

It is within the boundaries of the Cuyahoga Valley National Park. The site lies on the border between Northfield Center Township and Sagamore Hills Township. History The Village of Brandywine was first settled in 1814 when George Wallace, taking advantage of the water power, built a sawmill at Brandywine Falls. It was a thriving community. Over the next decade, the Village of Brandywine added a whiskey distillery, gristmill, woolen mill, and a dozen houses. In 1824, Wallace transferred his property to his sons who then formed the Wallace Brothers Company. Business thrived for the next 30 years. Eventually, Brandywine's prosperity dried up. The Ohio and Erie Canal, and later the railroads, shipped goods to the cities of Akron and Cleveland, leaving towns like Brandywine behind. Except for the barn and house built by James Wallace in 1848 only a few hidden foundations remain of the Village of Brandywine. Near the falls, some foundations of the old gristmill can still be seen. The James Wallace House has been restored and now serves as a bed and breakfast, The Inn at Brandywine Falls.

Background According to frontman Kip Winger, one morning he \\"just woke up and heard the new Winger record\\" in his head, knowing just what he wanted to do with it. It was released in October 2006 on Frontiers Records. The album is the most musically progressive album of Winger's career. Lyrically, much of the album is sung from the perspective of U.S. soldiers stationed overseas. Kip Winger was inspired to do this after performing solo shows at U.S. military bases, and being touched by the stories of the soldiers he met. The album cover, showing a U.S. soldier being watched over by angels, was drawn by comic book artist Ethan Van Sciver, known for his work at DC and Marvel Comics. Kip Winger was introduced to Van Sciver by a mutual friend in Florida.  Honors  In 2009 Kip Winger was presented by U.S. General Harold Cross with an honorary plaque and U.S. flag that had flown in Iraq for the song \\"Blue Suede Shoes\\", which honors the service and sacrifice of the United States armed forces and their families.

Watershed The river runs into the Cuyahoga River in Sagamore Hills Township near the now-abandoned Jaite Paper Mill. Discharge volume is extremely seasonal, usually a few cubic feet per second, and peaking at several hundred cubic feet per second under flood conditions. The Brandywine Creek watershed begins in the northern portion of Hudson, and includes the cities of Hudson, Macedonia and Twinsburg, and the townships of Boston, Sagamore Hills, and Northfield Center. Brandywine Falls A wooden elevated path leading down to Brandywine Falls Brandywine Falls, high, at , Elevation: within Cuyahoga Valley National Park, is accessed by a parking lot located on Stanford Road, about from Brandywine Road, approximately South of Ohio State Route 82, and North-West of Olde Eight in Sagamore Hills, Ohio. From there, wooden paths lead down to the waterfall. The falls can also be accessed via the Brandywine Gorge Trail, a 1.5 mile hiking trail. Rock layers thumbrightAn exhibit near the falls includes a photo of the waterfalls, a map of the area, and a cross-sectional drawing of the rock with: * Berea sandstone (320 million years), * Bedford Shale (350 million years), and * Cleveland Shale (350 - 400 million years) The rock layers of the Brandywine Falls can be read like a book. Each chapter covers millions of years, as ancient seas left behind sediments that were compressed by added layers. The rocks here at the base of the falls were formed more than 400 million years ago. Brandywine Creek and the \\"bridal veil\\" cascades began about 10,000 years ago after the last glacial retreat. The falls have now exposed the harder, yellow-brown Berea sandstone looming over the softer, deep red Bedford Shale. Since sandstone is more resistant to erosion, the shale below is frequently undercut. As these layers wear away, the story of the earth continues to be revealed.

Nagoya kei was a term that developed before the term visual kei, and gradually died out as the latter gained more popularity. This can be attributed to the fact that Nagoya kei, seems limited to Nagoya, when there were bands that played similar styles in other areas as well. Often considered darker and gloomier than visual kei, nagoya kei takes its musical influences more so from western (specifically British) punk rock bands. The focus of the bands tends to be much less on costume and makeup in favor of more complex musical compositions and concentration on the music itself. Notable nagoya kei bands include Silver~Rose, Laputa, Fanatic Crisis, Kuroyume and Merry Go Round. Bands such as Kein, Lamiel, Phobia, Deadman, Blast, Gullet, The Studs, Deathgaze and Lynch. appeared in the Nagoya area later on, but since the term Visual kei had already become mainstream by then, these bands are generally not considered part of Nagoya kei.

It was recorded in 1968 in the Cleveland Public Auditorium, and it was released later that year on a 12‚Ä≥ vinyl record. Background The day of the recording, Cleveland experienced a severe ice storm which tied up traffic. Cosby delayed the opening of the act for an hour to give people time to arrive and find their way to their seats. Near the end of that hour, after a period of approximately 10 minutes with no new arrivals, a woman entered and made her way to a seat very near the front row. When she had seated herself, Cosby cupped his hands around the microphone and announced in a deep, stentorian voice, \\"You're late!\\" The entire audience erupted in laughter and the show then began. This was Cosby's first album recorded in a large venue rather than an intimate nightclub. As in many of his other albums and stand-up work, Cosby delves in great detail into his childhood. Side One covers topics such as the first sin (\\"The Apple\\") and Cosby's two daughters (\\"The Losers\\"). Side Two is one long story, recounting childhood antics in the bed that he and his brother shared when they were supposed to be asleep, which were also recounted more than 20 years later in the first chapter of his book Childhood.

His career began in the 1920s and continued through musical partnerships with Count Basie (1940‚Äì41), Sidney Bechet (1941), and Earl Hines. Life and career Born in Xenia, Ohio, United States, in 1906, Dickenson wanted to be a plasterer like his father, but he abandoned the idea after injuring himself by falling off a ladder.John S. Wilson, \\"Vic Dickenson, a trombonist with Basie band in 40's, dies\\", The New York Times, November 18, 1984. He studied organ from 1922, then changed to performing trombone with local bands. He made his recording debut in December 1930 as a vocalist with Luis Russell's band. He joined Blanche Calloway's orchestra in the early 1930s. He led his own groups both on the east and west coast between 1947 and the mid-1950s. From then he was a session man. He appeared on the television program The Sound of Jazz in 1957 with Count Basie, Coleman Hawkins, Roy Eldridge, Gerry Mulligan, and Billie Holiday. He also recorded as a sideman with Jimmy Rushing (on Vanguard Records), Coleman Hawkins (Capitol and Prestige Records), Pee Wee Russell (Black Lion), Benny Carter (Bluebird and Black & Blue), Lester Young (Blue Note and Verve), Count Basie (Columbia and Pablo), Sidney Bechet (Bluebird, Black & Blue, and Blue Note). In 1953, he recorded The Vic Dickenson Showcase for Vanguard with Ed Hall on clarinet and Ruby Braff on trumpet. In 1958, Sydney Bechet made him come to France and play record at Brussel exposal. Dickenson was a member of \\"The World's Greatest Jazz Band\\", the house band at The Roosevelt Grill in New York City.Scott Yanow, \\"World's Greatest Jazz Band ‚Äî Live\\" (review), AllMusic. He also performed at the same venue in a smaller group that featured him alongside trumpeter Bobby Hackett. Dickenson is in Art Kane's photograph, A Great Day in Harlem, which includes trombonist Miff Mole. For all his lively musical talent, Dickenson was a laconic man who often liked to be alone between sets. During his long association with bands at Eddie Condon's, he would often retire to a single chair that sat in a small alcove outside the men's room, instead of gathering with fellow musicians in the band room. When men mistook him for the men's room attendant and offered him money, he took it. Dickenson died in New York City in 1984 at the age of 78 as a result of cancer.

Although inactive for many years, in 1927 it was revived and subsequently active until the end of 2011 when it merged with Birds Australia to form BirdLife Australia. It published a quarterly journal, Australian Field Ornithology, and a quarterly newsletter, the Bird Observer. It had a cooperative relationship with the Land for Wildlife program, a voluntary conservation scheme for private land in Victoria, which was instigated by two prominent club members, Ellen McCulloch and Reg Johnson, established in 1981, and coordinated by the Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment. In 1991 the club expanded its name to become the Bird Observers Club of Australia (BOCA) to give itself a national rather than a local focus. In May 2007, at the Annual General Meeting, the membership voted to change the name of the organisation again to Bird Observation & Conservation Australia to \\"more properly present it and the work it does\\", while retaining the familiar acronym BOCA. Its head office was in Nunawading (an eastern suburb of greater Melbourne) in Victoria, but it had sub-groups across eastern Australia. By 2011 BOCA had 49 branches and affiliated groups, mainly in the eastern states of Australia, as well as a specialist group (PhotoBOCA) for those interested in bird photography. It also owned and managed the Clarkesdale Bird Sanctuary at Linton, Victoria. Merger During 2009 discussions commenced with Birds Australia with a view to merging the two organisations. On 21 May 2011 members of both BOCA and Birds Australia voted by an overwhelming majority at their respective Annual General Meetings to merge the two organisations into one entity to be named BirdLife Australia.

The film stars Billy Bob Thornton, Virginia Madsen, Bruce Dern, and Max Thieriot. The plot is about a Texas rancher who attempts to construct a rocket in his barn and launch himself into outer space. The film was released on February 23, 2007. It grossed just $11 million against its $13 million budget, and received mixed reviews from critics. Plot Charles Farmer is a former U.S. Air Force fighter pilot and astronaut-in-training who reluctantly resigned from the space program and was discharged from the military before he could fulfill his dream of becoming a vital part of NASA. He did so in order to take over his family's failing ranch in Texas after his financially strapped father's suicide prior to the ranch being foreclosed on. Having missed the opportunity to travel into space, he decides to build a working replica of the historic Mercury-Atlas rocket and spacecraft in the barn on his secluded ranch in the fictional town of Story, Texas, using all his assets and facing his own foreclosure of the ranch as a result. But he has done so with the ongoing support of his wife Audrey, his teenage son Shepard, and young daughters Stanley and Sunshine. When he begins making inquiries about purchasing rocket fuel, the FBI and FAA step in to investigate, and the ensuing publicity thrusts Farmer into the spotlight and makes him a media darling. Farmer's launch is delayed by endless red tape created by U.S. government officials from the FAA, FBI, CIA, NASA and the Department of Defense, who seek to stall him beyond his deadline and force his creditors to foreclose on the farm. Farmer was counting on publicity to help him financially. He is denied the hydrazine fuel he requires, with government officials claiming he is a security risk and that it is too dangerous to allow a private citizen to launch a space vehicle. Facing financial ruin, he panics, climbs aboard, and, using a less-than-optimal substitute fuel, he somehow launches the rocket. However, after only a foot or two of vertical lift, the rocket descends back down, falls over, and horizontally blasts out of the old wooden barn where it was constructed. Farmer nearly dies from head trauma and other injuries after his capsule is thrown from the rocket. News media, spectators and all their vehicles are nearly crushed in the process. During the months he spends recuperating, public interest in his project wanes, and while he recovers slowly, he is depressed at the failure of the project and of his dream. An inheritance from her father, Hal, is unexpectedly left to Audrey after his death, which allows them to bring their debts current. Audrey, realizing how much Charles' dream means to the entire family, encourages Charles to construct another rocket, financing it with the rest of her inheritance. He is able to do so in relative privacy. Using a ruse to distract snooping government officials, Charles succeeds in launching the rocket, while the FAA claims no such thing has occurred. As the rocket rises out of the barn, the locals and law enforcement authorities in the area are amazed to watch it rise into space. After orbiting Earth nine times and suffering a brief period of a communication blackout, Charles returns safely and is given a hero's welcome home, appearing on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno and as seen in still photos shown during the end credits, while playing Elton John's Rocket Man.

When Thornton's character is being interviewed by Jay Leno during the closing credits, the studio audience members are not extras but the actual audience from that day's filming of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Reception Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes assigned the film an approval rating of 58% based on 136 reviews, with an average rating of 5.97/10. The site's critics consensus states: \\"The Astronaut Farmer is a charming, inspirational drama that successfully avoids modern cinematic cliches while appealing to the optimistic dreamer in all of us.\\" Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 55 out of 100, based on 28 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale. A.O. Scott of the New York Times called the film \\"a disarmingly sincere follow-your-dreams fable\\" and added, \\"The tone of the film . . . is wide-eyed and unapologetically sentimental . . . With another actor in the title role . . . the mawkishness would be unbearable, but Mr. Thornton can be relied upon for understated dignity accompanied by an intriguing undertone of serious craziness . . . The Polish brothers, in earlier films like Twin Falls Idaho and Northfork, have always placed wonderment above storytelling, and the availability of big stars and a reasonable special-effects budget has not entirely blunted their taste for odd, resonant images. The opening shots, of Farmer on horseback in his space suit, hint at a strangeness that the rest of the movie never quite lives up to, but it does have a visual freshness that makes the bromides and clich√©s palatable.\\"New York Times review Kevin Crust of the Los Angeles Times observed, \\"There's something old-fashioned about The Astronaut Farmer that's so conventional it feels unconventional. It follows the paradigm of inspirational movies so perfectly that even the smallest deviation seems rebellious. The movie's orthodoxy is precisely what allows us to take such pleasure in its irregularities . . . With this movie, the [Polish] brothers have been given a giant coloring book. While both write and produce, Mark directs and Michael acts . . . and for the most part, they attempt to stay within the lines. But it's in the few moments when they go outside those lines that the movie momentarily soars.\\"Los Angeles Times review Ruthe Stein of the San Francisco Chronicle called the film \\" exemplary family- friendly entertainment\\" and added, \\"[I]n less artistic hands, [it] could easily spin into cliche. Michael and Mark Polish . . . avoid triteness by sheer force of imagination. The small Texas town where Charles Farmer . . . handcrafts a rocket in his barn one valve at a time is presented as both familiar and otherworldly, part Norman Rockwell, part Twilight Zone . . . The brothers are following a path set by David Lynch, the king of weird, who ventured into wholesome territory with The Straight Story and came up with something profound in its simplicity . . . The Polishes set up a classic David and Goliath situation, leaving no question of whom the audience will root for. There are sufficient surprises along the way, so the ending is far from predictable. The Astronaut Farmer's goofy quality makes it totally endearing. It's also super entertaining.\\"San Francisco Chronicle review Steve Dollar of the New York Sun said, \\"Even for a comedy with dramatic drive, The Astronaut Farmer demands that the audience suspend its disbelief on multiple fronts . . . What is believable, however, is the passion of Billy Bob. He genuinely makes all the tearjerker, hug-a-munchkin family stuff resonate. Maybe it takes an actress as sensual and earthy as Ms. Madsen to match Mr. Thornton in emotional honesty, but their grown-up dynamic is what keeps the movie from drifting out of orbit.\\"New York Sun review DVD release Warner Home Video released the film on DVD on July 10, 2007. The disc offers the option of watching the film in either anamorphic widescreen or fullscreen format. It has an English audio track and subtitles in English, French, and Spanish. Bonus features include How to Build a Rocket: The Making of The Astronaut Farmer, a blooper and outtakes reel, and an interview with former astronaut David Scott.

The Shrine of our Lady of La Vang (Basilica of Our Lady of La Vang) is situated in what is today Hai Phu commune in H·∫£i LƒÉng District of Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã Province in Central Vietnam.  History  Fearing the spread of Catholicism, the C·∫£nh Th·ªãnh Emperor restricted the practice of Catholicism in the country in 1798. Soon thereafter, the emperor issued an anti-Catholic edict and persecution ensued. Many people sought refuge in the rainforest of La Vang in Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã Province, Vietnam, and many became very ill. While hiding in the jungle, the community gathered every night at the foot of a tree to pray the rosary. One night, an apparition surprised them. In the branches of the tree a lady appeared, wearing the traditional Vietnamese √°o d√†i dress and holding a child in her arms, with two angels beside her. The people present interpreted the vision as the Virgin Mary and the infant Jesus Christ. They said that Our Lady comforted them and told them to boil leaves from the trees for medicine to cure the illness. Legend states that the term \\"La Vang\\" was a derivative of the Vietnamese word meaning \\"crying out\\". Modern scholars believe it comes from the ancient practice of naming a location for a genus of a tree or plant native to the area, La meaning \\"leaf\\" and '\\"Vang \\"herbal seeds\\". In 1802 the Catholics returned to their villages, passing on the story of the apparition in La Vang and its message. As the story of the apparition spreads, many came to pray at this site and to offer incense. In 1820, a chapel was built. From 1830-1885 another wave of persecutions decimated the Catholic population, during the height of which the chapel in honour of Our Lady of La Vang was destroyed. In 1886, construction on a new chapel began. Following its completion, Bishop Gaspar (Loc) consecrated the chapel in honour of Our Lady Help of Christians, in 1901. On December 8, 1954, the statue of Our Lady of La Vang was brought from Tri Bun back to the holy shrine. The Vietnamese Bishops Conference chose the church of Our Lady of La Vang as the National Shrine in honour of the Immaculate Conception. La Vang became the National Marian Center of Vietnam on April 13, 1961. Pope John XXIII elevated the Church of Our Lady of La Vang to the rank of a minor basilica on August 22, 1961. Though there is no official Vatican recognition of this event as a Marian apparition, on June 19, 1998, Pope John Paul II publicly recognized the importance of Our Lady of La Vang and expressed desire to rebuild the La Vang Basilica in commemoration of the 200th anniversary of the first vision.

The valley begins between Powell Mountain and Little Stone Mountain where the waters of the Powell River flow down from the rugged mountains of western Wise County. The immense exposed rock face where Stone Mountain and Powell Mountain come together near Grindstone Ridge to the southeast from the overlook, yields a striking visual change in altitude. Within only 0.8 mile the vertical elevation changes by 2,000 feet ( 610 meters ) across the northern face of the Grindstone Ridge Dome of the High Knob Massif, to mark one of the greatest short-distance vertical elevation changes in the southern Appalachians ( the greatest found west of the Blue Ridge in Virginia ). The valley follows the Powell River west towards the Tennessee border.

Both sexes are similar. The male has metallic blue ocelli on upperparts, green ocelli on tail of twenty feathers and two spurs on legs. Female has black ocelli on upperparts, unspurred legs and tail of eighteen feathers. The female is smaller and duller than male. A shy and elusive bird, the mountain peacock-pheasant is distributed and endemic to montane forests of the central Malay Peninsula. The diet consists mainly of berries, beetles and ants. Mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b and D-loop as well as the nuclear ovomucoid intron G data confirms that this species belongs to a clade together with the bronze-tailed peacock-pheasant, Germain's peacock-pheasant and grey peacock-pheasant (Kimball et al. 2001). The molecular data suggests - though not with high confidence - that this species diverged from mainland stock earlier than the bronze-tailed peacock-pheasant. This is quite spurious, since its biogeography and derived plumage, and the fact that it is a peninsular mountain endemic indicate it is derived from a fairly small founder population; this would confound molecular analyses. What seems clear is that the present species evolved from mainland Southeast Asian stock, probably during the Late Pliocene to Early Pleistocene (3.6-1 myrNote that the molecular clock calibration method used by Kimball et al. (2001) is now known to be inappropriate, yielding far too low estimates in galliform birds.). The unique pattern of wings and tail thus is, contrary to long-held opinion, an autapomorphy, and the southern species of this clade - formerly separated in the genus Chalcurus - are probably not each other's closest relatives.

(1968) is the seventh stand-up comedy album by Bill Cosby, and his ninth album overall. It was recorded live at Harrah's, Lake Tahoe, Nevada and released by Warner Bros. Records. Background In 1967, Bill Cosby bought a Shelby Cobra Super Snake CSX 3303 from his friend, company founder Carroll Shelby. The car was a 1965 Cobra Competition roadster, retained by Shelby American as a PR car and then modified with the addition of two superchargers and a Ford C-6 automatic gearbox. Only two such cars were built; one was retained by Shelby and the other was sold to Cosby. Side two of this album (side one on the cassette release) is a single routine that focuses on Cosby's love of sportscars and his brief ownership of the Super Snake. The title, \\"200 M.P.H.\\", refers to Shelby's boast about the car's top speed; however, Cosby became so unnerved during a test drive that he returned it immediately afterward. Shelby American sold the car to S and C Motors in San Francisco, who in turn sold it to a customer named Tony Maxey. Maxey destroyed the CSX 3303 by driving over a cliff and into the Pacific Ocean; he died from his injuries a few days later. Brian Angliss purchased the vehicle and subsequently restored it. He plans to auction the car off. In a late-night talk show appearance, Cosby briefly re-told this story and said that he had heard that Jimmy Webb (of \\"MacArthur Park\\" fame) eventually ended up with his Cobra. While the majority of Cosby's Warner Bros. standup albums were regularly re-released on LP, and eventually issued on CD in April 1998, 200 M.P.H. was not reissued on vinyl (although it was available on cassette in the '80s). It did not see a CD release until 2005, mainly due to controversy over the main sketch's punchline: Afraid that the car was so powerful and hard to control that it would be lethal to the driver, Cosby decided to return it, saying, \\"Take the keys and this car, it's all paid for, and you give it to George Wallace.\\" Wallace was a well-known pro-segregationist, and was campaigning for the presidency of the United States at the time this album was recorded.

Biography Winter was born in Ostrava, Austria-Hungary (modern day Czechia). He emigrated with his family and settled in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He graduated from North High School in Minneapolis in 1922 (see North High Polaris for 1922). He attended Hamline University on a basketball scholarship. Winter opened The 620 Club in 1934 with his brother Henry and boxing manager/promoter Ernie Fliegel as equal partners. Located at 620 Hennepin Avenue in downtown Minneapolis, the restaurant specialized in turkey. The club was sold in 1971 and revamped the same year to become Moby Dick's bar (aka \\"Moby's). In 1947, Winter became part owner with Ben Berger, Sid Hartman, and Morris Chalfen and assumed the general manager duties of the new Minneapolis Lakers in the National Basketball League. By the mid-1950s, Winter was interested in attracting a pro football team to Minneapolis. He attempted to get an expansion team in the National Football League; when that failed Winter and his partners joined with the newly created American Football League in the fall of 1959. By 1960, with creation of the AFL, the NFL decided to expand to both Dallas and Minneapolis-St. Paul. Winter and his group pulled out of the AFL and received an NFL expansion team that began in the 1961 season. The team was named the Minnesota Vikings on September 27, 1960. Winter remained on the Vikings board of directors until 1989. He served as team president from 1965-87. In 1985, Winter shocked and angered his fellow Vikings owners when he attempted to sell his share of the team to Irwin L. Jacobs and Carl Pohlad. The case went to the Minnesota Supreme Court and finally was settled in Winter's favor. Legacy When the Minnesota Vikings headquarters and training facility opened in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, the Vikings had named it Winter Park, in honor of Max Winter. Their headquarters is now in Eagan, Minnesota.

She worked directly with author L. Frank Baum, the creator of the character. Family Remus was the daughter of the highly successful bootlegger George Remus and his first wife Lillian Klauff Remus. Her father, a pharmacist, later became a successful criminal defense lawyer in Chicago and a bootlegger in Cincinnati. Silent film career L. Frank Baum surrounded by the characters in The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays The Fairylogue and Radio- Plays was produced by the Selig Polyscope Company in Chicago, and Remus was paid $5.00 per day for her performance. Remus was cast in the film by L. Frank Baum himself. After the film was completed, Remus and other cast members toured with L. Frank Baum. \\"Mr. Baum himself took the film on the road and narrated the story onstage,\\" Remus said. \\"There was an orchestra and we stood offstage, singing occasionally. . . . I remember that after the film, I would come onstage to take a bow and then go to the back of the theater and sell the Oz books\\" Remus recalled. Remus also appeared in other early silent films, including Mary: Ten Nights in a Bar Room and The Four-Footed Hero. When Chicago's film studios relocated to Hollywood, her parents decided that she should stay in Chicago, and her film career ended. Father's legal problems In 1918, her parents separated, and later divorced. Her father married Imogene Holmes, and relocated to Cincinnati, Ohio. Romola Remus was devoted to her father. In Cincinnati, he began defending accused bootleggers, and later became a successful bootlegger himself, acquiring control of the Fleischmann Company distillery. In 1925, George Remus was convicted of violating the Volstead Act and spent two years in federal prison. During that time, his wife began an affair with Franklin Dodge, a government agent. Upon his release from prison, George Remus shot and killed his estranged wife. He was prosecuted for murder, but acquitted on the basis of temporary insanity. Romola Remus was at his side in the courtroom constantly during his trial, and took a job as a cabaret singer to help pay his legal bills. When George Remus was released from a brief stay at the Lima State Hospital for the Criminally Insane in Lima, Ohio, Romola Remus said, \\"I am the happiest girl in the world.\\" Later years Following her work in silent films, she became a vaudeville performer and an instructor of dance and music. In the last dozen years of her life, she was an organist at Chicago's 12th Church of Christ Scientist. In 1984, Remus appeared at the 28th annual \\"Ozmopolitan\\" fan convention, organized by The International Wizard of Oz Club, where she sang several songs, including \\"I Was a Flora Dora Baby\\", originally popularized by Fanny Brice in the Ziegfeld Follies. She also appeared in the 1985 Public Broadcasting System documentary The Whimsical World of Oz, which was released at the same time as the Walt Disney theatrical film Return to Oz.

Below is a translation of the Japanese narrative of the incident. \\"On January 22, 1953, two fishing vessels respectively named ‚ÄúDaiichi Daihou Maru and Daini Daihou Maru of Taihou Fisheries Company left Fukuoka, Japan for fishing operations. By February 4, they arrived at No. 284 fishing zone in international waters near Jeju Island.\\" \\"When two Japanese fishing vessels operating in the designated fishing zone at around 7:00 a.m. the same day, two S. Korean fishing vessels (Á¨¨‰∏ÄÊòåÈÅãÂè∑Ï†ú 2 Ïû• Ïö¥ Ìò∏andÁ¨¨‰∫åÊòåÈÅãÂè∑Ï†ú 2 Ïû• Ïö¥ Ìò∏) were spotted approaching the Japanese fishing vessels. They soon came close to the Japanese fishing vessels. And, then S. Korean crews greeted Japanese crews by saying ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs your fishing going today?‚Äù They just passed by and stopped nearby, watching the Japanese fishing vessels.\\" \\"As soon as Daiichi Daihou Maru began pulling fishing net up, the S. Korean vessels (in fact disguised as the fishing vessels manned by military personnel, etc.) at the distance of 30 meters from the stern of the Japanese fishing vessels opened firing automatic rifles at Daiichi Daihou Maru. Two Japanese fishing vessels were trying to escape their sudden and vicious attack on them but both of them were soon captured by 8:30 a.m. since the South Koreans were intensely and fiercely firing at them.\\" \\"One of chief fishermen was hit in the head with a bullet fired from one of the automatic rifles and fell unconscious. Then, they told Daiichi Daihou Maru and Daiini Daihou Maru to head to Jeju Island. They arrived at Hanlin port, Jeju Island at 11:30 a.m. The Japanese crews were transferred to the S. Korean police authority that soon confiscated private belongings, properties, equipment, etc. When at the police authority, the Japanese crews told them that one of their crews was seriously injured. He was then taken to a hospital which one could hardly call \\"hospital\\" since it had no wards, equipment, instruments, etc. A Korean doctor just refused to extend any medical care to him. The Japanese fishing crews requested the police authority to find a hospital for him but they just rejected their request by stating ‚ÄúWe are just carrying out our duty in accordance with an order given by the military. Therefore, we have no responsibility.‚Äù Then, they requested the military to extend necessary medical care to him. However, the military again refused to do so.\\" \\"They repeatedly requested the military to hospitalize him at the military hospital. They even told them that they would pay for medical expenses. Then, they pretended to accept their request and told them ‚ÄúThey would soon transport him to the military hospital by car.‚Äù However, he was just left alone there. He died at 23:00 p.m. on February 6.\\" \\"The Japanese crews requested the police authority to cremate dead Chief fisherman. However, it was turned down. They had to improvise his funeral service and materials to cremate him all by themselves.\\" \\"On February 9, they were transferred to an air defense facility in which they were confined in a small room whose floor area was 8.25 square meters. 18 crews were confined there with no food supplied by them. They had to survive on limited foods they had with them.\\" \\"During police interrogation, the S. Korean police authority insisted that two Japanese fishing vessels were captured 9 nautical miles from Hanlin, Jeju Island. On the other hand, the Japanese crews pointed out not only inaccuracy of navigational compass but also speed of the Korean vessels and then insisted that it was 30 nautical miles at the time of capture. Then, the South Korean police authority forced them to accept 13 nautical miles close to halfway between the Japanese claim and the Korean claim. According to a navigator of Daiichi Daihou Maru separately questioned by the South Korean police authority, two Japanese vessels were 30 nautical miles from Jeju Island when they were captured.\\" \\"At 23:00 p.m. on the same day, they were transferred to the police station at Jeju city and were jailed at the prison cell without any meal at all. The prison cell was only 8.25 square meters. 18 crews were jailed together with Korean inmates at a very small cell. However, some meager meals were served there.\\" \\"The Japanese crews were again interrogated by the Jeju police. The Jeju police charged the Japanese crews with violation of Syngman Rhee Line. They refuted the South Korean claim by telling them that installation of the line encompassing the island of Takeshima and a large area of water with fisheries jurisdiction was a unilateral act in contravention of international law.\\" \\"The police prepared an investigator‚Äôs record of oral statement in Hangul, in which the police falsified the statement as saying that the Japanese crews violated Syngman Rhee Line.

Syngman over the incident. Syngman expressed his regrets over abduction of the Japanese fishermen in international waters. Two fishing vessels and crews were returned home guarded by U.S Navy Frigate ship on February 17\\". \\"When leaving South Korea, the South Korean police stated: ‚ÄúWe are very sorry for death of your crew.

The film may also fall under the horror, comedy, fantasy, or science fiction genres. Monster movies originated with adaptations of horror folklore and literature. Typically, movie monsters differ from more traditional antagonists in that many exist due to circumstances beyond their control; their actions are not entirely based on choice, potentially making them objects of sympathy to film viewers. Traditional concepts The most common aspect of a monster movie is the struggle between a human collective of protagonists against one or more monsters, who often serve as the antagonistic force. In Japanese cinema, giant monsters known as kaiju often take up this role. The monster is often created by a folly of mankind ‚Äì an experiment gone wrong, the effects of radiation or the destruction of habitat. Or the monster is from outer space, has been on Earth for a long time with no one ever seeing it, or released (or awakened) from a prison of some sort where it was being held. The monster is usually a villain, but can be a metaphor of humankind's continuous destruction; giant monsters since the introduction of The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms have for a time been considered a symbol of atomic warfare, for instance. On the contrary, Godzilla began in this fashion yet as time moved on his reputation quickly grew into that of a cultural icon to the Japanese, as much as Superman is a cultural symbol to America, with a number of films presenting Godzilla as a sort of protagonist who helps protect humans from other, more malevolent monsters. The attempts of the humans to destroy the monster would at first be the usage of an opposing military force ‚Äì an attempt that would antagonize the monster even more and prove useless (a clich√© associated with the genre). The Godzilla series utilized the concept of a superweapon built by Japanese scientists to suppress him or any of the monsters he fights. Historically, monsters have been depicted using stop motion animation, puppets, or creature suits. In the modern day, many monster movies have used CGI monsters. History=Early monster films (1915‚Äì1954) King Kong (1933) is one of the earliest and most famous monster movies. The first feature-length films to include what are regarded as monsters were often classed as horror or science fiction films. The 1915 German silent film The Golem, directed by Paul Wegener, is one of the earliest examples of film to include a creature. The German Expressionist Nosferatu in 1922, and the depiction of a dragon in Fritz Lang's Die Nibelungen in 1924, followed tradition. In the 1930s, American film studios began to produce more successful films of this type, usually based on gothic tales such as Dracula and Frankenstein in 1931, both heavily influenced by German Expressionism, followed by The Mummy (1932) and The Invisible Man (1933). Classified as Horror films, they included iconic monsters. Special effects animator Willis O'Brien worked on the 1925 fantasy adventure The Lost World, based on the novel of the same name. The book and film featured dinosaurs, the basis for many future movies. He began work on a similar film known as Creation in 1931, but the project was never completed. Two years later, O'Brien produced special effects for the 1933 RKO film King Kong, directed by Merian C. Cooper. Since then, King Kong has not only become one of the most famous examples of a monster movie, but also is considered a landmark film in the history of cinema. The monster King Kong became a cultural icon, being featured in many other films and media since then. King Kong went on to inspire many other films of its genre and aspiring animators. A notable example was Ray Harryhausen, who would work with Willis O‚ÄôBrien on Mighty Joe Young in 1949. Following the re-release of King Kong in 1952, Harryhausen would later work on The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms in 1953. The film was about a fictional dinosaur, a Rhedosaurus, that was awakened from frozen ice in the Arctic Circle by an atomic bomb test. It is considered to be the film which kick-started the 1950s wave of ‚Äúcreature features‚Äù and the concept of combining nuclear paranoia with the genre. Such films at the time included Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954), Them! (1954), It Came from Beneath the Sea (1955), Tarantula (1955), The Deadly Mantis (1957) and 20 Million Miles to Earth (1957). The Giant Behemoth (1959) was an unacknowledged remake of The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms. Kaiju era (1954‚Äì1975) Movie poster for Godzilla, King of the Monsters! (1956), a re-edited version of Godzilla (1954). It spawned the Godzilla franchise and inspired a wave of kaiju films. During the 1950s, Japanese film studio Toho produce their first successful Kaiju films. Their first successful Kaiju film was Godzilla (1954), which adapted the nuclear concept from The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms from a Japanese perspective, rooted in real-life Japanese historical events, such as the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 and the Daigo Fukury≈´ Maru incident in 1954. The film's success spawned the Godzilla franchise, the longest-running film franchise in history. The titular monster has become a cultural icon, and one of the most recognizable monsters in cinema history. It also inspired a wave of Kaiju films, such as Rodan from this time. Godzilla, King of the Monsters! (1956), a re-edited Americanized version of Godzilla for the North American market, notably inspired Steven Spielberg when he was a youth. He described Godzilla as \\"the most masterful of all the dinosaur movies\\" because \\"it made you believe it was really happening.\\" A parallel development during this era was the rise of the Z movie, films made outside the organized motion picture industry with ultra-low budgets. Grade-Z monster movies such as Plan 9 from Outer Space (1959) and The Creeping Terror (1964) are often listed among the worst films ever made because of their inept acting and amateurish special effects. After 1960, American monster movies were less popular yet were still produced. However, Japanese kaiju films were popular during this decade. In 1962, King Kong vs. Godzilla was a kaiju film produced by Toho featuring both Godzilla and King Kong. In 1965, Japanese studio Kadokawa Pictures started their own kaiju franchise to rival that of Godzilla, in the form of Gamera. Ray Harryhausen continued to work on a number of films such as The Valley of Gwangi (1969) while Toho continued production of Godzilla and other kaiju films like Mothra (1961). The Monster Times film magazine was founded in 1972. In 1973, The Monster Times conducted a poll to determine the most popular screen monster. Godzilla was voted the most popular movie monster, beating Count Dracula, King Kong, Wolf Man, The Mummy, Creature From the Black Lagoon, and Frankenstein's monster. Spielberg era (1975‚Äì1998) In 1975, Steven Spielberg directed Jaws, which while labeled as a ‚Äúthriller‚Äù, features a large (but by no means unrealistically so) great white shark. Jaws was an aquatic monster movie influenced by earlier monster films such as King Kong and Godzilla. Director John Guillermin remade King Kong in 1976. The xenomorph alien had its first appearance in the 1979 science-fiction/horror film Alien, directed by Ridley Scott. That was the same year when magazine Fangoria began been published, in response to the popularity of this genre. Since the mid-1970s, with Mel Brooks' Young Frankenstein, and into the 1980s, monster movies like Larry Cohen's Q, the Winged Serpent (1982), Tom Holland's Fright Night (1985), George Romero's Creepshow and Ron Underwood's Tremors (1989) used comedy as a scaring device. Just before the technological revolution that made possible to create digital special effects thanks to CGI, the last generation of SFX artists impressed us all with the quality and realism of their creations: Rick Baker, Stan Winston and Rob Bottin are among the most remarkable names in the industry. 1993 saw the release of Jurassic Park, based on the 1989 novel of the same name by Michael Crichton and directed by Steven Spielberg, which set a new benchmark in the genre with innovative use of CGI and tried-and-tested animatronics to recreate dinosaurs. The film was also influenced by Godzilla. Jurassic Park was an enormous critical and commercial success and at one point held the title of the highest-grossing film of all time. The success of Jurassic Park and its four sequels, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, Jurassic Park III, Jurassic World, and Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, made sure that dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus rex and the Velociraptor established themselves in the public psyche. The movies also helped generate renewed interest in paleontology. While the films showed allegedly authentic dinosaurs which had been recreated by Genetic engineering and could be understood as science fiction, advanced contemporary animation technology made it also possible to revive medieval legends about dragons. The successful feature film Dragonheart showed a friendly dragon voiced by Sean Connery. Modern era (1998‚Äìpresent) Traditional monster movies re-emerged to a wider audience during the late 1990s. An American remake of Godzilla was made in 1998. The Godzilla featured in that film was considerably different from the original and many Godzilla fans disliked it, but it was a moderate box office success. In 2002, a French monster film Brotherhood of the Wolf became the second- highest-grossing French-language film in the United States in the last two decades.\\"Little pictures have a big year\\", Los Angeles Times, 3 January 2003 In 2004, Godzilla was temporarily retired following Godzilla: Final Wars. Director Peter Jackson, inspired by the original King Kong and Ray Harryhausen films, remade King Kong in 2005, which was both a critical and commercial success. In 2006, a South Korean monster film, The Host, involved more political overtones than most of its genre. The 2008 monster movie, Cloverfield, a story in the vein of classic monster movies, focuses entirely on the perspective and reactions of the human cast and is regarded by some as a look at terrorism and the September 11 attacks metaphorically. The following year The Water Horse: Legend of the Deep was released, and the legendary Loch Ness Monster is a playful creature menaced by overly aggressive humans. The British Independent Film Award winning film Monsters, in a manner similar to Cloverfield, presented the story of a monster epidemic from the perspective of the humans affected by it. Although not entirely focused on monsters, blockbusters such as The Avengers and Prometheus included scenes that featured monsters posing threats to the protagonists. In 2013, Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures released the Guillermo del Toro film Pacific Rim. Though the film was heavily inspired by the Kaiju and Mecha anime genres, del Toro wished to create something original with the film rather than to reference previous work. The film was a moderate success in the United States but a box office hit overseas. It received generally positive reviews with significant praise for the film's special effects. A sequel, Pacific Rim: Uprising, was released in 2018. In 2014, Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures released Godzilla, a reboot of the Godzilla franchise directed by Gareth Edwards. Legendary originally intended to produce a trilogy with Edwards attached to direct all films. Shortly afterwards, Legendary announced a shared cinematic universe between Godzilla and King Kong, titled MonsterVerse. Kong: Skull Island was released in March 2017, a reboot of the King Kong franchise and second film in Legendary's MonsterVerse. The third film in the MonsterVerse, Godzilla: King of the Monsters was released on May 31, 2019. Michael Dougherty directed the film and featured Rodan, Mothra, and King Ghidorah. The fourth film in the MonsterVerse, Godzilla vs. Kong, is scheduled to be released on May 21, 2021 after being delayed from its November 20, 2020 release date due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is directed by Adam Wingard.

It was formed in 2002 by Jarrod Holt, Ryan Hutchings and Nigel McCulloch, and have since frequently collaborated with actor and comedian Josh Thomson. They are notable for their quirky, irreverent, and sometimes controversial comedic style. Notable Productions=7 Days In 2009 thedownlowconcept created a popular and award winning comedy gameshow, 7 Days based on their news-based radio panel show, Off The Wire. The series has had over 100 episodes and is currently in its 5th season. By creating consistent paid television work for a number of comedians the show has helped grow the New Zealand comedy scene by showcasing local comic talent to the public, and helping the country outgrow its notorious cultural cringe. 48 Hours thedownlowconcept were the first group to win the New Zealand 48HOURS Film Festival twice, with short films Brown Peril (2007), and Only Son (2010). All films of the festival are to be conceived, written, shot, edited and delivered in 48 hours, with an unknown random genre, a character, a line of dialogue and a prop, which is revealed at the start of the festival. Only Son later went on to win Best Screenplay and Best Short Film at the New Zealand Film and Television Awards 2010. It is the only 48 Hour film to ever have featured in the New Zealand Film Awards, let alone win it outright, beating films with government funding from the New Zealand Film Commission. Only Son was later picked up for distribution by the NZFC and was invited to Fantastic Fest in Austin, Texas amongst studio premieres. Hounds In 2012 thedownlowconcept produced their first scripted comedy series, Hounds. It won Best Comedy at the 2012 New Zealand Film and Television Awards, beating 7 Days, making it three years in a row that the company has been nominated in the category, winning it in the previous year for 7 Days. Despite the network not renewing the series, it remains one of the most critically acclaimed comedies ever produced in New Zealand. Controversy=\\"Headlights\\" Music Video In 2009 New Zealand's national broadcaster TVNZ banned a music video made by thedownlowconcept for the possibility of breaching the Broadcasting Standards Authority code on the exploitation of children. The video was made for the song Headlights by 11 piece afro soul funk band \\"The Hot Grits\\". The video depicted preschoolers binge drinking milk as if it was alcohol and taking lollies and candy as if they were drugs. Lead vocalist Barnie Duncan said the idea for the video came from the production company, with the intention to \\"demonstrate the child-like greed with which adults conduct themselves whilst on the road to excess\\". Despite the removal of the video from circulation from both of TVNZ's networks, the clip was picked up by music television channels C4 and Juice TV, and went on to win the \\"Best Music Video\\" award, The Golden Jandal, at the New Zealand 2008 Handle the Jandal music video awards. The video was also the winner of the category of \\"Best use of exploitative tactics\\". The only other New Zealand music video that has been banned in the history of TVNZ is by The Skeptics, entitled AFFCO. The 1987 clip featured graphic footage of lambs being slaughtered. Lundybainwatson In 2012 thedownlowconcept courted controversy again with the naming of a greyhound Lundybainwatson in their series Hounds. The dog's name referred to convicted multiple murderers Mark Lundy, Scott Watson and David Bain. Bain was later acquitted after spending 13 years in jail following numerous appeals from lawyer Joe Karam resulting in his eventual release from prison in 2009. Before the series aired, promotional material came to the attention of Karam who complained to the network citing bad taste and potentially a defamation lawsuit. The unintentional publicity stunt caused a minor stir when the producers called for suggestions on the Hounds Facebook page. At the behest of the network the production company re- shot and re-recorded audio in the few scenes where the dog's name was mentioned, renaming the dog Lundydixonwatson. Dixon referred to another controversial New Zealand murderer, Antonie Dixon. thedownlowconcept refused to be interviewed on the topic but released this statement, \\"We named the greyhound character (played by Flossie) after New Zealand's three most well- known, potentially wrongly accused men.\\" Acclaim \\"Auckland-based production company thedownlowconcept are as close to a Kiwi comedy hit factory as currently exists.\\" - Lee Henaghan, The Nelson Mail \\"Hounds, I believe, is the best Kiwi comedy show ever made.\\" - Chris Schulz, The New Zealand Herald. \\"Is Hounds the best Kiwi comedy ever?

It was founded in 1900 as the Bible Teacher's College. In 2019, Rev. LaKeesha Walrond was appointed as the first woman and the first African American woman president of New York Theological Seminary. History New York Theological Seminary began its life in 1900 as the Bible Teacher's College in Montclair, New Jersey.\\"Bible Teacher's College: More Than 300 Studies and Lectures to Constitute the Course\\", The New York Times, November 8, 1900. Accessed March 30, 2011. Under the direction of its founder, Wilbert Webster White, the school sought to intentionally bridge the divide that had then begun to open between university-based and Bible school forms of theological education. White was a leading proponent of what was known as \\"the inductive Bible study method\\". He believed that the Bible ought to be taught in English and allowed to occupy the central position in the theological curriculum. The method lent itself easily to an emphasis on practical training for ministry, which characterized the institution from its inception. White moved the school to New York City in 1902 in order to provide what he called a more \\"cosmopolitan\\" setting for the ministerial training of students, renaming it the Bible Teachers‚Äô Training School.\\"Bible Teachers College to Remove to this City; Will Leave Montclair, N.J., at the Beginning of the New Year -- Institution's Future Plans.\\", The New York Times, December 21, 1901. Accessed March 30, 2011. In 1921, the corporate name was changed to The Biblical Seminary in New York, and then, in 1965, to New York Theological Seminary. In the early 1970s, NYTS, under the leadership of theological educator, George W. Webber, began targeting educational programs for students in the greater New York metropolitan area who were already in ministry, were bi-vocational, or were contemplating a shift from a secular to a religious vocation. The seminary sold its campus and relocated to more affordable space and began offering its programs at nights or on weekends when urban church leaders who worked full-time could attend. For several years it suspended the granting of the MDiv degree and focused on offering the STM degree, a newly formed Certificate in Christian Ministry, and continuing education opportunities for urban church leaders. In the mid-1970s, the seminary added the MPS and DMin degree programs. In the early 1980s it began to offer the MDiv degree again, and began a master's degree program inside Sing Sing Correctional Facility that trains inmates from throughout the New York State prison system for ministry within the system. In the 1990s, the curriculum was modified to reflect the seminary's commitment to social and community analysis and the increasingly multicultural urban context. In 2002, the seminary moved to the Morningside Heights area of Manhattan. It has offices in The Interchurch Center, classrooms in the Riverside Church, and access to the Columbia University Library System, which includes the Burke Library at Union Theological Seminary. Academics NYTS is accredited by New York State and the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada. The seminary currently offers six accredited degrees: Master of Divinity, Master of Arts in Pastoral Care and Counseling, Master of Arts in Religious Education, Master of Arts in Religious Leadership and Administration, Master of Arts in Youth Ministry, and Doctor of Ministry. Two non-accredited programs are also currently offered: a Certificate in Christian Ministry and a Clinical Pastoral Education program that is accredited by the Association for Clinical Pastoral Education through a satellite contract with Norwalk Hospital. It also offers an ATS accredited Master of Professional Studies to selected inmates in Sing Sing Correctional Facility.

It was built during World War II and financed by the Maritime Commission as part of the country's Emergency Shipbuilding Program. It was originally operated by Rheem Manufacturing, a company with no previous shipbuilding expertise. When Rheem had difficulty managing the yard, Kaiser Shipyards was retained to manage the operation. History=Early history and war years In 1942, the Maritime Commission selected Fields Point for the location of an emergency shipyard. It was planned to be able to build ships on six different ways. The construction of the shipyard was financed as part of the country's Emergency Shipbuilding Program. Storekeepers and housewives, clerks and youths fresh out of school worked side by side, turning out ship after ship. Construction began on March 28, 1942. The shipyard construction swallowed the popular Kerwin's Beach, which drew thousands to the shores of the Providence River before it was covered over. One million yards of fill from a nearby hillside was dumped onto the mud flats, but this still failed to stabilize the area. The total cost of the shipyard was twenty six million dollars. On New Year's Eve, 1942, the first of many misfortunes hit the plant. The plate shop, the first step in the production process, burned to the ground. In February 1943, after the Rheem company showed difficulty managing the yard, Kaiser Shipyards was asked to manage the operation of the yard. As a result of the takeover, the size of the yard increased from 9,000 employees to over 14,000 just four months later. Eventually, seven miles of road wound about the yard. The first ships that the yard produced were Liberty ships. After ten ships were completed, 21 frigates were built. After those ships were finished, 32 attack cargo ships (Navy hull designation AKA) were constructed and launched. In the three years that the yard was in operation, 63 ships were eventually launched and completed. After learning from their initial mistakes, workers became more skilled with the building of ships. It took only 136 days from the keel laying to delivery of the attack cargo ships. The fastest turnover took a mere 82 days. The yard didn't escape recognition by famous dignitaries. President Harry S Truman was escorted by then Governor J. Howard McGrath when Truman toured the yard. Navy Secretary James Forrestal on September 1, 1945 wrote to T.J. Walsh, the head of the company, praising the work of the local yard and saying that it was preeminent in building the great arsenal that helped save the world. Work was described as decent by the workers who labored there. Wages were also high due to the influence that the AFL had in the area. Common laborers at the yard earned eighty-five cents an hour. The steady employment actually helped the local economy as the yard employed 18,767 on September 30, 1944. Three months later the payroll included 20,879. During the yard's peak in January 1945, 21,264 people were employed. Among these numbers were over 3,000 women. At the end of the war, the shipyard closed after laying off over 3,000 people in three months. The shipyard today Today, the yard has been reused by a few companies. Johnson & Wales University has taken over the northwestern portion of the yard for their culinary arts program. A drive-in theater also operated on the site of the yard from 1958 to 1976. The theater had a 1,700 car capacity. In the late 1970s there were also plans to construct a cargo container port at the site, but these plans fell through and two cranes from these plans are all that remain. There is a combined Navy, Marine Corps and Army Reserve center on the site.

Early life Pitman was born in the Somerset village of Sutton Montis in England. He was the son of farmer Henry Pitman and Sarah (n√©e Marchant) Pitman. After his father's death in 1880, his mother remarried, to Charles Candy. In 1881, a census shows Herbert Pitman was living on a farm on Sutton Road with his brother, sister, and widowed mother. Sea career Pitman first went to sea in 1895 at the age of 18 after joining the Merchant Navy. He received the shore part of his nautical training in the Navigation Department of the Merchant Venturers' Technical College, under Mr. E. F. White, and qualified as a Master Mariner in August 1906. He served a four-year apprenticeship with James Nourse Ltd. followed by five years as a Deck Officer. From 1904, he served one year as a Deck Officer with the Blue Anchor Line before moving to the Shire Line, with whom he served for six months. He moved to the White Star Line in 1906. While employed with White Star, he served as Fourth, Third and Second Officer on the vessels Dolphin and Majestic, and as Fourth Officer on the Oceanic. RMS Titanic Like the other junior officers Pitman received a telegram early in 1912 directing him to report to White Star's Liverpool office at nine in the morning on 26 March of that year. There he collected his ticket for Belfast; he arrived there at noon the following day and reported to (then) Chief Officer William Murdoch. As the Titanic departed Southampton on 10 April, Pitman was assisting (now First) Officer Murdoch at the stern of the ship in supervising the casting-off of mooring ropes and taking on of tug lines. While the Titanic was at sea, Pitman's duties included working out celestial observation and compass deviation, general supervision of the decks, looking to the quartermasters, and relieving the bridge officers when necessary. At the time of the Titanics collision with the iceberg, Pitman was off-duty, half-asleep in his bunk in the Officers' Quarters. He heard and felt the collision, later testifying that it felt like the ship \\"coming to an anchor.\\" He was dressing for his watch when Fourth Officer Boxhall rushed in and informed him they had struck an iceberg and were taking on water. Pitman was then ordered to report to the starboard side of the ship to assist in uncovering lifeboats. After receiving the command to lower the boats, Murdoch ordered Pitman to take charge of Lifeboat No. 5. Before Pitman entered the lifeboat, Murdoch shook his hand saying \\"Goodbye; good luck.\\" Pitman at this point did not believe that the Titanic was seriously endangered, and thought the evacuation of passengers was precautionary. He stepped into the lifeboat and it was lowered to the water. Murdoch had ordered Pitman to take the lightly loaded lifeboat to the gangway doors to take on more passengers there, but (as Pitman later testified) the doors failed to open as the lifeboat waited for this about 100 yards off from the ship.Pitman H. Testimony, Question 15004 et seq. at British Wreck Commission enquiry transcript Up to this point Pitman had expected the ship to remain afloat. After an hour in the lifeboat however, he realised that Titanic was doomed, and withdrew the lifeboat 300 yards further off from the descending ship. He watched Titanic sink from about 400 yards distance, and was one of the few to state afterwards in the official enquiries that he thought she sank in one piece. As the stern slipped under water, he looked at his watch and announced to the lifeboat's occupants, \\"It's 2.20,\\". Hearing the cries of those in the water after the ship had gone, Pitman decided to row back to them to rescue whomever he could. However, after announcing this course of action to the passengers in the lifeboat he was confronted with voluble protests from amongst them against the idea, with the expression of fear that the lifeboat would be mobbed and capsized by the panicking multitude in the water. Faced with this Pitman acquiesced and kept the lifeboat at its station several hundred yards off whilst the passengers and crew in the water perished swiftly in the cold. (In later life Pitman admitted to bearing the burden of a bad conscience for his failure to take the lifeboat to the rescue of those dying in the water that night).

She is a former Secretary of the New South Wales Labor Left faction and the former Assistant General Secretary of NSW Labor. Jackson is a left member of NSW Labor calling on the party to legalise cannabis and drug law reform. Jackson has also called for strong industrial relations reform, like criminalising wage theft, and criminal justice reform in NSW. Early life and education Jackson is the daughter of the late Australian Broadcasting Corporation journalist Liz Jackson and film maker Martin Butler. Jackson grew up in the Eastern Suburbs of Sydney, attended Newtown High School of the Performing Arts and graduated with a Bachelor of Economic and Social Sciences and a Bachelor of Laws from the University of Sydney.http://www.whatdegreewhichuniversity.com/After- Uni/Prominent-Graduates/Rose.aspx  Student politics  Jackson was heavily involved in Labor Left student politics. She was originally a member of the Sydney University Socialist Left faction, which was an affiliate of the National Organisation of Labor Students (NOLS). In 2005 she served as President of the University of Sydney Students' Representative Council, where she gained national prominence for her part in organising the student campaign against the Howard government's Voluntary student unionism laws.(28 April 2005). The World Today. ABC Radio. URL accessed 10 August 2006. In 2006 Jackson successfully advocated to re-unify both major Labor Left student factions, NOLS and the Victorian-based Australian Labor Students, and subsequently became the first National Labor Students President of the National Union of Students. After her involvement in student politics, she became the President of Young Labor Left and a member of the Young Labor State Executive. During this time she worked as a political staffer for state Minister for Education Verity Firth.http://www.abc.net.au/tv/qanda/txt/s2300527.htm Career For the 2007 Federal Election, Rose was the campaign manager for Labor's Candidate for the marginal Sydney seat of Wentworth, George Newhouse. On 21 November 2007, it was alleged Jackson had \\"espoused anti-Zionism\\" during her tenure in the NUS. The Australian reported on its front pageNewhouse and Wentworth: where did it go wrong? (29 November 2007) a leaked email which Jackson had addressed to \\"Dear Activists\\", stating \\"I oppose Zionism because it calls for the creation of a Jewish state, and I think all governments should be secular\\". The incident attracted significant media coverage because of Jackson's role as a staffer for candidate George Newhouse whose electorate of Wentworth has the highest Jewish population of any in Australia. The Australian Jewish News said Jackson's comments \\"attacked the heart and soul of every Jewish voter\\". Jackson said she had not understood the definition of Zionism at the time she wrote the email, saying \\"I support Israel.\\" In September 2008, Jackson was elected as a Councillor to Waverley local council. She also gained media attention in 2008 following her appearance on the ABC's Q&A; program during which she confused the concept of Pavlovian conditioning for pavlova, a type of dessert. Jackson served as the National Political Coordinator of left-wing trade union United Voice until 2013, when she moved to a role as a campaign organiser at NSW Labor Office. She was the Secretary of the Labor Left faction from 2010 until 2016 and has been an Assistant General Secretary of NSW Labor and State Convenor of the New South Wales Labor Left faction since 2016. Jackson was selected to fill the casual vacancy in the NSW state upper house, the NSW Legislative Council following Lynda Voltz's election to the NSW Legislative Assembly for the seat of Auburn and was appointed on 8 May 2019. In 2020 Jackson publicly announced her support for the legalisation of cannabis in NSW. Jackson was one of the first NSW Labor MPs to support the legalisation of cannabis after the ACT legalised cannabis.

It was first printed in 2005 to be applied to 3.5 D&D; rules. Contents It introduces new classes (Incarnate, Soulborn, and Totemist) and new races (Azurin, Duskling, Rilkan, and Skarn), along with new feats, rules, and spells, for both classes within the book and classes from other books. Magic of Incarnum describes Incarnum, which, in its pure form, looks like a \\"radiant mist, deep blue in color.\\" With the supplemental rules provided within, characters can use incarnum to create Soulmelds using Essentia. The Soulmelds function like magically-sustained items that are applied to different parts of the body, and Essentia is invested into said Soulmelds to make them more effective. In addition to investing Essentia, characters can bind Soulmelds to different Chakras, which further fuses Soulmelds to their corresponding body parts, providing characters with bonus effects. Publication history The book was written by James Wyatt, Frank Brunner, Richard Baker, and Stephen Schubert, and first published in September 2005. Cover art was by Henry Higginbotham with cover photography by N. Eric Heath, and interior art by Wayne England, Carl Frank, David Griffith, Eric Polak, Mark Poole, Wayne Reynolds, Ron Spencer, Anne Stokes, Chris Trevas, and Franz Vohwinkel. James Wyatt explains: \\"Here's my story about the birth of the Magic of Incarnum book. I've always been really excited about the entire 3E product line, but while it has brought forth tremendous innovations in mechanical concepts, it hasn't expanded the world of D&D; in a really significant way. The Expanded Psionics Handbook is the latest and greatest incarnation of the psionics rules, but the base concept has been part of the game since Eldritch Wizardry. I really wanted to see us push the boundaries and come up with a completely new concept. So in meeting after meeting over a period of about two years, I stressed the need to do something that had never been seen in D&D; before.\\" ReceptionReviewsReferencesExternal links *http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/12/12019.phtml 2005 books Dungeons & Dragons sourcebooks ","title":"Magic of Incarnum"},{"id":"6306200","text":"Aned Y.

History The College of Pharmacy was established and opened in 1903 as the School of Pharmacy and was located in Science Hall. The school had a local physician, Dr. Samuel C. Benedict, serving as the part-time Dean and a local pharmacist at H.R. Palmer & Sons, Arthur J. Palmer, serving as a part-time professor of Pharmacy. Dr. Benedict also taught Materia Medica. Science Hall was destroyed by fire in November of that first year, so the School of Pharmacy was moved into the basement of Terrell Hall. The school hired Robert C. Wilson as its first full-time staff member for the beginning of the 1907-08 school year (Wilson was the grandson of George Foster Pierce). The first group of graduates commenced in 1908 earning their Pharmacy Graduate (Ph.G.) degrees. Upon Dean Benedict's death in 1914, Robert Wilson became the director of the school and remained in that position until 1948. Wilson was named as the Dean of the School of Pharmacy in 1924. The school later changed its name to the College of Pharmacy. In 1926, the school became one of the first in the country to offer a four-year Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy. It also disbanded its two-year Ph.G degree track at this time. The school's location remained in Terrell Hall until 1939 when it moved into the second and third floors of the newly remodeled New College building. In the 1940s, Robert W. Woodruff gave multiple donations to fund a dispensing laboratory, dispensary, and pharmacology laboratory. The College's Master of Science program began in 1951 and the Ph.D. program in 1964 with the first doctorates conferred in 1967. The school moved into its current facility, the Robert C. Wilson Pharmacy Building, in 1964; however, the building was not named after Wilson until 1978 (Dr. Wilson's 100th birthday). Dr. Stuart Feldman of the University of Houston was named Dean in 1991. During his tenure the College received Georgia State lottery funds to increase technology in education and the Millikan Educational Resources Center was converted to a computer laboratory for student access. Following a national trend, the curriculum was modified from the quarter to the semester system, and the entry-level Doctor of Pharmacy(PharmD) degree and the Non-traditional Doctor of Pharmacy Pathway Program were initiated. A full-time experiential coordinator was hired. Dr. Svein √òie of the University of California San Francisco became Dean on January 1, 2000. Under his guidance, the College has increased its class size, expanded its regional presence, been involved in establishing a Center for Drug Discovery and a Center for Mass Destruction Defense, increased interdisciplinary research and strengthened its research focus.

The band took their name from a cargo vessel that Massey sighted in a port on Lake Michigan. History=1998‚Äì2004 Initially the band concentrated on playing their own versions of classic blues songs, particularly electric Chicago-style blues, and performed their first concert at Phyllis' Musical Inn in Chicago on October 29, 1998. The band quickly progressed from covering blues tunes to writing their own music. In 1999 the band met singer-songwriter Michael Connelly, who collaborated with them on their inaugural effort, the five-song EP Goin' Back Home. The Steepwater Band returned the favor by performing on Connelly's project, Bottles of Wine. Connelly officially joined The Steepwater Band in 2000. The years of 1999 and 2000 saw the band performing frequently in Chicago and the surrounding region. On June 8, 2000, The Steepwater Band performed at their first Chicago Blues Festival, kicking off that year's event at noon. The band released its first full-length album, Brother to the Snake, in 2001 with the support of radio station WXRT and Jim Beam to a packed house at Chicago's Double Door. During the year the band also released a live-in-the-studio album, Live...Half in the Bag. The band continued to play in the Midwest in 2002 and 2003, often as an opening act. The band also signed a recording, management, and publishing deal with Funzalo Records/Mike's Artist Management during this period. This relationship resulted in the production of one album, Dharmakaya, which was recorded with producers Sean Slade and Paul Kolderie (Radiohead, Warren Zevon, the Pixies, Uncle Tupelo) in Boston and released on May 18, 2004. Connelly departed in October 2004, and the band and Funzalo/MAM ended their relationship in early 2005. 2005‚Äìpresent The Steepwater Band performing at the Azkena Rock Festival, September 1, 2005. In April 2005 the band performed on television in Nashville, Tennessee, with Little Milton, who died a few months later. In June, for their fifth time playing the Chicago Blues Festival, they received a headlining slot on the Best Buy Showcase Stage. In September they performed their first European concert at the Azkena Rock Festival in Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. In addition to their own 70-minute set, they hosted a late-night jam session with members of the Drive-by Truckers and the Basque band The Soulbreaker Company. In November 2005, the band was invited by Chicago rock radio station WLUP to open for Bon Jovi at the sold- out United Center. In 2006 the band performed at various festivals and concerts with Umphrey's McGee, Yonder Mountain String Band, Keller Williams, the Doobie Brothers, Ian Gillan (Deep Purple's vocalist), and Cheap Trick. The band's third full-length album, Revelation Sunday, was released on August 15, 2006 with a release concert held on August 11, 2006, at Chicago's Metro music venue. In September, the band headlined three concerts, with The Soulbreaker Company as the opening act, in Madrid, Bilbao, and Barcelona, Spain. Rick Richards, guitarist of The Georgia Satellites, joined the band on stage for three songs in Barcelona. In January 2007, the band performed on the Gimme Three Days cruise with Lynyrd Skynyrd, 38 Special, American Minor, Tishamingo, Blackberry Smoke, and other blues-rock, Southern rock and country artists aboard the Carnival Cruise Lines Fascination. In its March issue, Vintage Guitar magazine published a full-page article/interview with band members. In July, the band returned to Europe for a tour of Spain and the Canary Islands. The tour began with a concert in Barcelona, Spain, on July 5 with Gov't Mule and John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers, and also included a date with long-time Black Crowes guitarist Marc Ford. In conjunction with the tour the band also released Songs From the Eighth Day, featuring covers of Neil Young's \\"Cortez the Killer\\", Bob Dylan's \\"Phantom Engineer\\", Big Bill Broonzy's \\"Key to the Highway\\", Robert Johnson's \\"Walkin' Blues\\", a live version of \\"Collision\\", and two new Steepwater Band songs. In May 2008, the band recorded Grace and Melody at the Compound Studios in Long Beach, CA with producer Marc Ford. It was released on Diamond Day Records in November 2008 in the US and December 2008 in Europe. In December 2009, the band announced a five-week tour of Europe, including a run with Marc Ford in Spain on the first ten dates. In early February 2010, the band embarked on a two-week tour with Gov't Mule, and shortly after began another five-week European tour. In September 2010, \\"The Stars Look Good Tonight\\", debuted on the FMQB AAA Top 200 Radio Chart at No. 165\\\\.

MGEs are found in all organisms. In humans, approximately 50% of the genome is thought to be MGEs. MGEs play a distinct role in evolution. Gene duplication events can also happen through the mechanism of MGEs. MGEs can also cause mutations in protein coding regions, which alters the protein functions. They can also rearrange genes in the host genome. One of the examples of MGEs in evolutionary context is that virulence factors and antibiotic resistance genes of MGEs can be transported to share them with neighboring bacteria. Newly acquired genes through this mechanism can increase fitness by gaining new or additional functions. On the other hand, MGEs can also decrease fitness by introducing disease-causing alleles or mutations. Mobile genetic elements in the cell (left) and the ways they can be acquired (right) Types *Transposons (also called transposable elements) are DNA sequences that can move locations within a genome, which includes retrotransposons and DNA transposons. **Retrotransposons are the most widespread class of transposons in mammals. An RNA transcript of MGEs is copied by reverse transcriptase. Then, the DNA sequence can be inserted back to a random location of the genome. **DNA transposons are a DNA segment that can move to a new location by a \\"cut-and-paste\\" strategy. *Plasmids of bacteria are a transferable genetic element through bacterial conjugation. This is a mechanism of horizontal gene transfer that allows bacteria to share virulence factors and antibiotic resistance genes. *Bacteriophage elements, like Mu, which integrates randomly into the genome by transduction. *Group I and Group II introns are a product from self-splicing in the host transcripts, and they act as ribozymes that can invade tRNA, rRNA, and protein coding genes in bacteria. Research examples CRISPR-Cas systems in bacteria and archaea are adaptive immune systems to protect against deadly consequences from MGEs. Using comparative genomic and phylogenetic analysis, researchers found that CRISPR-Cas variants are associated with distinct types of MGEs such as transposable elements. In addition, CRISPR-Cas controls transposable elements for their propagation. MGEs such as plasmids by a horizontal transmission are generally beneficial to an organism. The ability of transferring plasmids (sharing) is important in an evolutionary perspective. Tazzyman and Bonhoeffer found that fixation (receiving) of the transferred plasmids in a new organism is just as important as the ability to transfer them. Beneficial rare and transferable plasmids have a higher fixation probability, whereas deleterious transferable genetic elements have a lower fixation probability to avoid lethality to the host organisms. One type of MGEs, namely the Intergrative Conjugative Elements (ICEs) are central to horizontal gene transfer shaping the genomes of prokaryotes enabling rapid acquisition of novel adaptive traits. As a representative example of ICEs, the ICEBs1 is well-characterized for its role in the global DNA damage SOS response of Bacillus subtilis and also its potential link to the radiation and desiccation resistance of Bacillus pumilus SAFR-032 spores, isolated from spacecraft cleanroom facilities. Transposition by transposable elements is mutagenic. Thus, organisms have evolved to repress the transposition events, and failure to repress the events causes cancers in somatic cells. Cecco et al. found that during early age transcription of retrotransposable elements are minimal in mice, but in advanced age the transcription level increases. This age- dependent expression level of transposable elements is reduced by calorie restriction diet. Diseases The consequence of mobile genetic elements can alter the transcriptional patterns, which frequently leads to genetic disorders such as immune disorders, breast cancer, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In humans, stress can lead to transactional activation of MGEs such as endogenous retroviruses, and this activation has been linked to neurodegeneration. Other notes The total of all mobile genetic elements in a genome may be referred to as the mobilome. Barbara McClintock was awarded the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \\"for her discovery of mobile genetic elements\\" (transposable elements). Mobile genetic elements play a critical role in the spread of virulence factors, such as exotoxins and exoenzymes, among bacteria. Strategies to combat certain bacterial infections by targeting these specific virulence factors and mobile genetic elements have been proposed.

It was first published in 2002 when Mason was 26 and was his first novel.Barrett, Andrea (29 September 2002). \\"A Few Strings Loose\\". New York Times. Retrieved 20 January 2012 The Piano Tuner was the basis for a 2004 opera of the same name (composed by Nigel Osborne to a libretto by Amanda Holden) and is also due to be released as a film in 2018, directed by Charlie Stratton. The Film is to be produced by Mulberry Films LLC, Latitude Media & BCDF. Synopsis The novel is set in 1886, in the jungles of Burma. The protagonist, a middle-aged man by the name of Edgar Drake is commissioned by the British War Office to repair a rare Erard grand piano belonging to a Doctor Anthony Carroll. Carroll, who is the root of many myths, had the piano shipped to him as a means to bring peace and union amongst the princes in Burma in order to further the expansion of the British Empire. The extreme humidity of the tropical climate soon rendered it useless and horribly out of tune. Drake's \\"mission\\" thus becomes vital to the Crown's strategic interests. In a series of sub-plots and intrigue the surgeon-major is charged with treason. When the piano tuner goes to meet the surgeon-major against the wishes of the military staff, he finds himself suddenly surrounded. Reception The book has been thematically compared with Conrad's Heart of Darkness. Andrea Barrett, in The New York Times, called the book \\"thoroughly engaging\\" and said that the character of Drake was its greatest achievement, though both she, as well as Hermoine Lee in The Guardian, said that the historical digressions in the book were \\"clumsy\\" or \\"sat stiffly\\". Adaptations The novel was adapted into an opera by Nigel Osborne, to a libretto by Amanda Holden, which premiered at the Linbury Studio of the Royal Opera House in 2004.

He is a published scholar, poet, critic, and journalist whose work has been translated into more than a dozen languages; his scholarship on the political economy of riots has been widely influential in political theory. He has appeared in three editions of Best American Poetry and two times in Best Music Writing, and has received an individual grant from the NEA as well as fellowships from the Cornell Society for the Humanities, The University of California Humanities Research Institute, and Institute of Advanced Study, University of Warwick. His first book of poetry, Madonna anno domini, received the Walt Whitman Award from the Academy of American Poets in 1996.List of winners of the Walt Whitman Award Life Born in Berkeley, CA, a graduate of Boston University and the Iowa Writers' Workshop, Clover is a Professor of English Literature and Comparative Literature at the University of California, Davis, and was the distinguished Holloway poet-in-residence at the University of California, Berkeley in 2002-2003. Clover's given name at birth was Joshua Miller Kaplan but via legal change he took his mother's maiden name. His mother, Carol J. Clover, is the originator of the final girl theory in a book on horror films and a professor emerita at the University of California at Berkeley. Scholarship Clover's three scholarly books in addition to many articles and book chapters have all in various ways considered changes to daily life, work, politics, and social struggle since the Sixties. Originally studying poetry, music, and film, he has come to focus since the 2008 economic crisis directly on political-economic matters. Basic concerns include the array of changes wrought by deindustrialization in the west, the decline of the United States empire and the future of global capitalism. Particular focuses run from the rise of office work to the nature of financialization, from the world after the end of the Soviet project to the transformations of social movements, all considered within the framework of Marxist value theory, with a particular interest in racialized regimes of power and struggle against state and capital. In addition to his scholarship he has been a journalist since the Nineties. He has contributed columns, often on popular culture and politics, to various journals, including the column \\"Pop and Circumstance\\" for The Nation and \\"Marx and Coca-Cola\\" for Film Quarterly. He is a former senior writer and editor at the Village Voice and Spin. He has contributed to The New York Times, the Los Angeles Review of Books, and many other venues, sometimes under the name \\"Jane Dark.\\" Poetry He has published three volumes of poetry in addition to shorter works for which he has won various prizes and fellowships; poems have been anthologized in multiple volumes and languages, including the Norton Introduction to Literature (10th edition, 2009). His poetry often concerns the life of great cities and the twilight character of late modernity, particularly the way it is entangled with the products of overdeveloped capitalism (especially the pleasures of popular music) and how we will have to forsake all of those pleasures for our freedom. Judith Butler has written that \\" In this brilliant volume, the fragmented world of a late and lost modernity has its own moving and lucid affect, its forms of aliveness.\\" https://www.amazon.com/Totality- Kids-New-California-Poetry/dp/0520246004 Increasingly his work has concerned direct political struggle; as one reviewer noted, \\"Few books, let alone books of poetry, arrive boasting a blurb from Entertainment Weekly while simultaneously, and aggressively, declaring the attempt to establish a Marxist lyric praxis.\\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2015/07/patrick-james- dunagan-reviews-joshua-clovers-red-epic Clover has also translated poetry from the Dutch and French, including the book Tarnac: A Preparatory Act, by Jean- Marie Gleize.http://www.kenningeditions.com/shop/tarnac-a-preparatory-act/ Political Work Clover has written extensively about the campus movements against tuition increases and student debt, about the Occupy movement, and about free speech and policing both on and off the university campus. In January 2012, he and eleven students at the University of California, Davis, engaged in a sit-in to protest the financial arrangements between U.S. Bank and the university, permanently closing the bank branch along with ending the university's particular arrangements with the bank. The protesters, who became known as the \\"Davis Dozen,\\" were charged with \\"obstructing movement in a public place and conspiracy to commit a misdemeanor.\\"http://www.davisenterprise.com/local-news/crime-fire-courts/da- charges-students-prof-in-bank-protests/ One month before the trial was scheduled to begin, the Davis Dozen accepted a plea deal from the Yolo County District Attorney.

Controversy  Nick Irvin, in a February 2019 opinion piece for The California Aggie, drew attention to published comments by Clover suggesting he was in favor of killing police. Among them was the September 2015 SFWeekly interview statement by Clover \\"People think that cops need to be reformed. They need to be killed.\\" Clover also was reported by CBS Sacramento to have tweeted in November 2014 ‚ÄúI am thankful that every living cop will one day be dead, some by their own hand, some by others, too many of old age‚Äù, and in December of that year ‚Äúit‚Äôs easier to shoot cops when their backs are turned‚Äù. When questioned by Irvin about his statements, Clover replied ‚ÄúI think we can all agree that the most effective way to end any violence against officers is the complete and immediate abolition of the police.‚Äù University spokesperson Dana Topousis said, also in reply to questions from Irvin, \\"The UC Davis administration condemns the statement of Professor Clover to which you refer. It does not reflect our institutional values, and we find it unconscionable that anyone would condone much less appear to advocate murder.\\" In March 2019 California State Assemblyman James Gallagher gathered over 10,000 signatures on a petition calling for Clover to be fired. UC Davis Chancellor Gary May replied in a letter to Gallagher that \\"Professor Clover‚Äôs statements, although offensive and abhorrent, do not meet the legal requirement for 'true threats' that might exempt them from First Amendment protection. . . . Accordingly, the university will not proceed with review or investigation of concerns regarding Professor Clover‚Äôs public statements.\\"  Books  *Riot. Strike. Riot: The New Era of Uprisings.

The victims‚Äîat least 8,372 of them‚Äîwere mainly males, mostly Bosniaks Muslims and some Croats Muslims.Find a Grave: Srebrenica- Potoƒçari Memorial and Cemetery , 6,938 genocide Muslim victims have been identified through DNA analysis (conducted by the International Commission on Missing Persons) of human remains recovered from mass graves and 6,504 () Muslim victims have been buried. Background The massacre in Srebrenica began in Potoƒçari, where some 25,000 Bosniak Muslim refugees had desperately gathered awaiting evacuation. After entering the city on 11 July 1995, Bosnian Serb forces, led by Ratko Mladiƒá, moved into Potoƒçari and separated many Bosnian men and teenage boys from the rest of the crowd before killing them; some women and girls were raped and killed as well. The Dutch UN peacekeepers stationed in Srebrenica (Dutchbat) were unable to stop the massacre, despite having their headquarters in the town. In all, about 1,200 innocent people were murdered at Potoƒçari before the survivors were evacuated to Tuzla. In October 2000 Wolfgang Petritsch, the High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, declared that the land in Potoƒçari would be turned into a memorial and cemetery for the victims of the genocide. In May 2001, a foundation was established to oversee and finance construction of the Srebrenica Genocide Memorial. Two months later, around the time of the sixth anniversary of the massacre, a foundation stone was laid for the memorial in front of a crowd of 15,000 people. The first memorial was held in July 2002 with about 20,000 attendees. The first 600 victims were buried in the new cemetery in March 2003. Opening The $5.8 million memorial-cemetery complex paid for with donations from private groups and governments. The United States provided $1 million toward the project. The memorial was opened by the former United States President, Bill Clinton, on 20 September 2003, when he told thousands of relatives of the Srebrenica massacre victims:Original Source: The US Embassy via Archive.org Bill Clinton was the President of the United States during much of the Bosnian war and presided over the Dayton peace agreement. Anniversaries On 5 July 2005, Bosnian Serb police found two bombs at the memorial site, just days ahead of a ceremony to mark the massacre's 10th anniversary, when 580 identified victims were to be buried during the ceremony, and more than 50,000 people, including international politicians and diplomats, were expected to attend. The bombs would have caused widespread loss of life and injury had they exploded, and were probably aimed at plunging the region into further bloodshed. On 11 July 2007, 30,000 gathered to the 12th anniversary. Carla del Ponte, the chief prosecutor of International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, also attended. On 12 July 2007, a day after the 12th anniversary of the massacre and the burial of a further 465 victims, a group of men dressed in Chetnik uniforms marched the streets of Srebrenica. They all wore badges of military units which committed the massacre in July 1995. On 11 July 2009, marking the 14th anniversary, some 40,000 Bosniak mourners, a number of western diplomats and civic associations from across the region attended the burial ceremony on Saturday for 534 newly identified victims. Among the victims were 44 teenagers. No Bosnian Serb high- level officials were present at the ceremony. Ethnically related incidents such as graffiti containing threats on a mosque and the vandalism of Bosnia and Herzegovina's national flag torn from the Bratunac town-hall building occurred. Members of the Ravna Gora Chetnik movement desecrated the flag of Bosnia and Herzegovina, marched in the streets wearing T-shirts with the face of Ratko Mladiƒá and sang Chetnik songs. A group of men and women associated with Obraz \\"chanted insults directed towards the victims and in support of the Chetnik movement, calling for eradication of Islam\\". A full report of the incident was submitted to the local District Prosecutor's Office but no one has been prosecuted. Bosnia and Herzegovina does not have a law banning fascist organizations and similar groups and the police there considered it \\"freedom of association\\". On 11 July 2010, the 15th anniversary, 775 coffins of Bosnian Muslims and Croats which included one Roman Catholic Bosnian Croat. Serbian President Boris Tadiƒá attended the ceremony. A statement by the US president Barack Obama was read: On 11 July 2012, the 17th anniversary, about 30,000 people attended the ceremony and 520 newly identified victims were buried. About 7,000 individuals, including some survivors, embarked on a three-day and 110 kilometer long march in order to commemorate the march made by 15,000 Bosniaks who fled after the town fell to the Bosnian Serb Army. Rabbi Arthur Schneier of the Park East Synagogue in New York gave a speech at the Memorial. In Croatia, the Croatian parliament held a minute of silence and a speech was given by Ned≈æad Hod≈æiƒá, a representative of the Bosniak community in Croatia. In Montenegro, the Montenegrin parliament, a Bosniak NGO forum, and the Alliance of World War II Veterans and Antifascists held a commemoration in Podgorica's Pobre≈æje Memorial Park. The Serbian NGO Women in Black gathered in Belgrade for a performance called \\"We will never forget the genocide in Srebrenica\\" in remembrance. US President Barack Obama stated that \\"the name Srebrenica will forever be associated with some of the darkest acts of the 20th century.\\" He added that the U.S. \\"rejects efforts to distort the scope of this atrocity, rationalize the motivations behind it, blame the victims, and deny the indisputable fact that it was genocide.\\" UK Prime Minister David Cameron said that the genocide should never be forgotten or denied and urged that the world \\"prevent such atrocities from taking place.\\" On 17 November 2012, various war veteran groups from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, and Croatia visited the memorial and paid tribute. Collective burials have been annually held also since 2012, same as before; twenty-second one is the last to date, commemoration of 11 July 2017 when remains of newly identified 71 victims were buried in the Memorial Center.

Logic investigates and classifies the structure of statements and arguments, both through the study of formal systems of inference and the study of arguments in natural language. The scope of logic can therefore be very large, ranging from core topics such as the study of fallacies and paradoxes, to specialized analyses of reasoning such as probability, correct reasoning, and arguments involving causality. One of the aims of logic is to identify the correct (or valid) and incorrect (or fallacious) inferences. Logicians study the criteria for the evaluation of arguments.

By accident or design, fallacies may exploit emotional triggers in the listener or interlocutor (appeal to emotion), or take advantage of social relationships between people (e.g. argument from authority). Fallacious arguments are often structured using rhetorical patterns that obscure any logical argument. Fallacies can be used to win arguments regardless of the merits. There are dozens of types of fallacies.  Formal logic  * Formal logic - Mathematical logic, symbolic logic and formal logic are largely, if not completely synonymous.

Early life Harradence was born in Blaine Lake, Saskatchewan and earned his law degree at the University of Saskatchewan. His aggressive nature saw him become middleweight boxing champion of the University of Saskatchewan. His brother, Clyne Harradence, graduated in law at the same time and was in partnership with John Diefenbaker before Diefenbaker became Prime Minister. Military service & aviation From 1941 to 1943, during World War II, he served in the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). It was during his service that he was wrongfully \\"cashiered\\" for performing aerobatics with a Bristol Bolingbroke bomber-trainer, \\"broken\\" from the RCAF and sent to Alaska as a member of the Canadian Army. After the war he overturned his \\"cashiering,\\" had his flying status and honourable record renewed and moved to Calgary, Alberta to practise law. Milt flew with 403 City of Calgary Squadron, RCAF for a number of years. In 1960 Lynn Garrison, also a pilot with 403 Squadron, obtained the contract to ferry 75 P-51 Mustang aircraft, retired from RCAF service, to their new owners in New York City. Milt Harradence would take time off from his law practise to accompany Garrison on the trips. Flying without radios, most of the time, they navigated by following the CPR railroad tracks eastward. Some of the flights were very exciting. He and Garrison acquired two Mustangs as part of their compensation and registered them as CF-LOR and CF-LOQ, the first of their type registered in Canada. Harradence loved to do low-level aerobatics and participated in many airshows across Canada and the United States. He and Garrison had a long- term relationship with the founders of the Confederate Air Force in Texas. Milt would trade his Mustang for a DeHavilland Vampire jet, obtained from New York by Garrison. This would be traded for Garrison's Canadair F-86 which Harradence flew as CF-AMH, for a short time, before retiring from the aviation game in 1967.Milt Harradence in his ex-RCAF Mustang While ferrying surplus Mustangs from the old RCAF Station Macleod, Harradence and Garrison noted a number of Lancaster bombers heading into the melting pot. Garrison purchased Lancaster FM-136 in 1960 and ferried it to Calgary where, with the help of Milt Harradence and Arthur R. Smith DFC, MP, created the Lancaster Memorial Fund. The Lancaster is a permanent display in Calgary as a memorial to those who served with the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan, during World War Two. Harradence and Smith received their pilot training under this scheme. Smith flew Lancasters. Politics With Lynn Garrison as his campaign manager, Harradence was elected to Calgary City Council in 1957 serving as an alderman for a term. He was re-elected for a second term but resigned after a short period. Harradence was leader of the Alberta Progressive Conservative Party from 1962 to 1964. A flamboyant Calgary defence lawyer and war veteran, he defeated Ernest Watkins, the party's sole member of the legislature, at the 1962 Progressive Conservative leadership convention. He received media attention during 1963 Alberta general election by flying his own red P-51 Mustang across the province while campaigning. Harradence was defeated in Calgary West by Donald S. Fleming of the Social Credit Party of Alberta and the party lost half of its popular vote and was shut out of the legislature with the loss of Watkins' seat.Beuerlein, Patricia, \\"Tory leadership history,\\" Edmonton Journal, December 3, 2006 Harradence's vigorous campaigning created a base upon which Peter Lougheed would develop the Progressive Conservative Party to the point where it defeated the Social Credit Party. Lougheed became Premier. Legal career Harradence retired from politics and returned to his legal practise as a criminal defence lawyer.http://www.archivesalberta.org/2006exhibit/lasa1.htm The target of a number of death threats due to his legal work, he was one of the few people in the country granted a permit to carry a concealed weapon. In the 1970s, he was asked by the province to investigate allegations of brutality by prison guards at the Calgary Correctional Institute. While he cleared the guards his report criticized the prison system. The Pierre Trudeau government's handling of the 1973 energy crisis and his treatment of Western Canada created a reason for the Committee for Western Independence in early 1975. Milt Harradence was involved in the Independent Alberta Association aimed at breaking Alberta's oil industry away from Ottawa's control. This created a great deal of embarrassment for Trudeau. Harradence's cousin, Jack Horner, was a cabinet minister in the Trudeau government. In spite of this, one of Trudeau's final acts before leaving office, saw Harradence appointed to the Alberta Court of Appeal in 1979 where he sat as a judge until his retirement in 1997. He died from cancer on February 28, 2008. Other His service was recognized when he was appointed an honorary colonel of the 416 Tactical Fighter Squadron in Cold Lake. His colleague, C.D. Evans, wrote a book on Harradence: Milt Harradence: The Western Flair.http://www.durancevile.com/milt/About_milt.html Canadian Magazine said of Harradence: \\"When he strides into a courtroom, Calgary‚Äôs Milt Harradence goes to war.\\"http://www.legalarchivessociety.ab.ca/Products/publications.html The Criminal Trial Lawyers' Association in Alberta periodically awards the Harradence Prize in his honour to the experienced counsel whose actions most reflect the characteristics of Harradence http://albertactla.com/events.shtml References 1922 births 2008 deaths Judges in Alberta Leaders of the Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta candidates in Alberta provincial elections Deaths from cancer in Alberta University of Saskatchewan alumni People from Blaine Lake, Saskatchewan University of Saskatchewan College of Law alumni Calgary city councillors ","title":"Milt Harradence"},{"id":"6306290","text":"The Favorite (also titled Intimate Power) is a 1989 Swiss-American drama film based on the unsubstantiated story of Aim√©e du Buc de Riv√©ry (1768-1817) that takes place at the dawn of the 19th century. It is the final film of director Jack Smight. Premise A young French woman named Aimee is kidnapped and forced into a sultan's harem in Turkey. Fiercely independent, she resists, but must make choices in order to survive. She begins to influence the sultan toward more fair manners of solving his conflicts, but finds herself at odds with another of his wives, who wants her son Mustafa to become the new sultan. As the years pass, she must deal with the new sultan's advances while protecting her adopted son Mahmud, and helping the Ottoman Empire against the Russians who have better weapons than they do.

He served as the head football coach at Ohio State University from 1913 to 1928, compiling a record of 78‚Äì33‚Äì9. Wilce is best known for coaching the great Chic Harley and leading Ohio State to their first win over archrival Michigan in 1919. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1954. Early years and playing career Wilce was born in Rochester, New York. He lettered in three sports while attending the University of Wisconsin. In football, Wilce was an all-conference fullback and captain of the 1909 team. Coaching career Following his graduation from Wisconsin, Wilce coached high school football in La Crosse, Wisconsin and then became both an assistant football coach and assistant professor of physical education at Wisconsin. In 1913, Ohio State began play in the Western Conference, later the Big Ten Conference, and hired Wilce as its head football coach. Wilce's teams won a conference championship in 1916 with a 7‚Äì0 record, and repeated in 1917 (8‚Äì0‚Äì1) and in 1920 (7‚Äì1) when Ohio State played its first bowl game, losing the 1921 Rose Bowl to California, 28‚Äì0. Wilce coached the Ohio State Buckeyes football team for sixteen seasons, the second longest tenure in school history after Woody Hayes, compiling a career record of 78‚Äì33‚Äì9. Medical and academic career In 1919, Wilce received his medical degree. He retired from football after the 1928 season to practice medicine. Wilce completed postgraduate training in cardiology at University of Edinburgh in the 1930s and was a professor of preventive medicine at The Ohio State University College of Medicine, specializing in research and treatment of heart disease. He also served as Director of Student Health Services from 1934 to 1958. The John W. Wilce Student Health Center, built in 1969, is named for Wilce. Wilce's \\"combination of medicine and football\\" and a sense of propriety that reflected his English heritage led him to try to reform the speech of his players on and off the field. He coined the phrase \\"intestinal fortitude.\\" Haber (1955) records the story of the coinage, the idea first coming to Wilce on the way to a lecture he was to present on anatomy and physiology at Ohio State in 1916, his first use of the phrase in public in a lecture to his team, and how he began to hear the phrase used by others. Honors and death In 1954, Wilce was selected for enshrinement in the College Football Hall of Fame and was elected a member of the Ohio State Varsity O Hall of Fame in 1977. His academic honors include the Ohio State Distinguished Service Award in 1956. He died of complications of cardiovascular disease on May 17, 1963, in the Columbus suburb of Westerville, Ohio. Of his departure from coaching he was quoted: \\"Football was becoming too much of a business. The game was being taken away from the boys. I was a faculty-type coach who believed educational aspects were more important than winning games.\\" Family Wilce was survived by his wife, Minerva Connor Wilce, sons Jay and James M. \\"Jim\\" Wilce (1922‚Äì1988), and daughters Roseanne Wilce Pearcy and Dorothy Wilce Krause, along with many grandchildren, amongst whom are the nationally known sports and outdoors photographer Anne Krause (1952‚Äì2006) and James M. \\"Jim\\" Wilce, Jr., a linguistic anthropologist at Northern Arizona University.

Despite the term, WEMT training is available and geared not just to the EMT, but also the paramedic, prehospital registered nurse, registered nurse, physician assistant, and medical doctor. After all, without an understanding of the applicable gear, skills, and knowledge needed to best function in wilderness environments, including a fundamental understanding of the related medical issues more commonly faced, even an advanced provider may often become little more than a first responder when called upon in such an emergency. WEMT training and certification is similar in scope to wilderness advanced life support (WALS) or other courses for advanced providers such as AWLS (advanced wilderness life support), WUMP (wilderness upgrade for medical professionals), WMPP (wilderness medicine for professional practitioner), and RMAP (remote medicine for advanced providers). Unlike more conventional emergency medicine training, wilderness emergency medicine places a greater emphasis on long-term patient care in the backcountry where conventional hospital care can be many hours, even days, away to reach. Some of the main providers of wilderness EMT training in the United States include Stonehearth Open Learning Opportunities (SOLO, the oldest continuously operating school of wilderness medicine in the world ), True North Wilderness Survival School, the Wilderness Medicine Institute at (National Outdoor Leadership School), Wilderness Medical Associates (WMA), Aerie Backcountry Medicine, Center for Wilderness Safety, and Remote Medical Training. History Near the end of the 19th century, volunteer organizations such as St. John Ambulance began teaching the principles of first aid at mining sites and near large railway centers. By the dawn of the 20th century, additional organizations such as the Boy Scouts and the American Red Cross began teaching first aid to lay people. Over the years, these organizations trained hundreds of thousands of people in the elements of providing assistance until definitive care could be arranged. The training in these courses assumed that definitive care was nearby and could be delivered quickly. Eventually there was a realization that this training, while valuable, needed to be supplemented and/or revised to deal with the extended time and limited resources inherent when a medical crisis occurs in a wilderness setting. In the 1950s organizations such as The Mountaineers began developing training programs that addressed these special needs. In 1966, the US Government, through the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, gave the Department of Transportation (DOT) responsibility for creating a national Emergency Medical Services System (EMS). From this program came the standardized curriculum for the position of emergency medical technician (EMT). The first wilderness EMT course was taught in 1976 to help EMTs in Colorado adapt their skills and knowledge when working with search and rescue teams. By 1977 organizations such as Stonehearth Open Learning Opportunities (SOLO) were offering specialized wilderness first aid training to their instructors. Meanwhile the DOT EMS program recognized a need to develop standardized training for \\"first responders\\" such as truck drivers, policemen and fireman who could lend assistance during the initial part of \\"golden period\\" until an ambulance with an EMT arrived.  Training  WEMT training is not standardized and varies by state and school but typically involves around 50 hours of wilderness medicine training in addition to the traditional EMT training. Most schools also allow for other health care professionals, such as RNs, MDs, or Paramedics, to become wilderness certified, but the curriculum is the same, the standard of care and scope of practice may vary. Often a student will have to travel a long distance to attend a WEMT class, and as a result, most WEMT classes involve taking classes 8‚Äì10 hours per day for one or more weeks (depending on whether the student is already an EMT). There is a strong focus on rendering aid with improvised means (for instance, using a branch and some rope to splint an injured extremity rather than using commercially available splinting devices). In wilderness settings it is unlikely that the specialized equipment found in an ambulance will be available, so the focus is on using only what is at hand in your assessment and care for a patient. There is also a greater focus on long-term care, since a WEMT may have to be with a patient for many hours, while most urban EMTs are with each patient for no more than an hour at the most. Providing care in the wild can be a daunting task, since the golden hour is usually out of the question, and one may have to treat or stabilize a critical patient for hours until help arrives or you can get them the care they need. Backcountry medicine often speaks of the golden day‚Äîa patient's survival chances for critical injuries drastically drop off around 24 hours without hospital care. WEMT's and wilderness first responder can perform more advanced interventions, such as giving patients prescribed medications outside the scope of an urban EMT or first responder with off-line medical direction. Some of these medications include those for pain, fever and infections depending on what standing orders the WEMT or WFR has.(2006) Wilderness Medicine Handbook, 10th Edition. WMI of NOLS WEMTs also are allowed some acts outside the scope of practice of urban EMTs, such as stopping CPR after all efforts have been exhausted, dislocation reductions and ruling out spinal injuries. Wilderness EMT courses are available in Ireland and the United Kingdom but are not recognised by the respective governing bodies for pre-hospital care.

Boxhall was the last surviving officer of the Titanic to die. Early life Boxhall was born in Hull in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England, the second child of Miriam and Captain Joseph Boxhall. He was born into an established seafaring tradition: His grandfather had been a mariner, his uncle was a Trinity House buoymaster and Board of Trade official, and his father was a respected master with the Wilson Line of Hull. Boxhall followed in the footsteps of his ancestors on 2 June 1899, when he joined his first ship, a barque of the William Thomas Line of Liverpool. Boxhall's apprenticeship lasted four years, during which time he travelled extensively. He then went to work with his father at Wilson Line and, after obtaining his Master's and Extra-Master's certifications in September 1907, joined the White Star Line. On 1 October 1911, he was confirmed as a sub-lieutenant in the Royal Naval Reserve.London Gazette, 5 March 1912 He served on White Star's liners and Arabic before moving to the Titanic as Fourth Officer in 1912; he was then 28 years old. RMS Titanic Like the ship's other junior officers, Boxhall reported to White Star's Liverpool offices at nine o'clock in the morning on 26 March 1912, and travelled to board the ship at Belfast the following day. After the RMS Titanic departed Southampton on 10 April, Boxhall settled into his regular duties; these included scheduled watches, aiding in navigation, and assisting passengers and crew when necessary. When Titanic collided with an iceberg at 11:40 pm on 14 April, Officer Boxhall was on duty but was not on the bridge. At the two inquiries held into the sinking in 1912 he stated he was standing on the Boat Deck just outside the officers' quarters. In his 1962 BBC interview he said he was in his cabin, having gone there to make tea. Hearing the lookout bell, he headed immediately to the bridge, arriving just after the impact. Capt. Smith, who had also just arrived on the bridge, ordered Boxhall to perform an inspection of the forward part of the ship. He found no damage, but was later intercepted by the ship's carpenter, who informed him that the ship was taking water. A mail clerk confirmed this to Boxhall and Captain Smith. Later, it was Boxhall who calculated the Titanics position so that a distress signal could be sent out. It was also Boxhall who sighted the masthead lights of a nearby vessel (possibly the ) and attempted in vain to signal by Morse lamp and distress flares. Officer Boxhall was placed in charge of lifeboat No. 2, which was lowered from the port side at 1.45 am with 18 persons aboard out of a possible 40. He rowed away from the ship for fear of being pulled down by suction. Boxhall did not actually see the Titanic founder, as her lights had gone out and his lifeboat was about three-quarters of a mile distant. Boxhall spotted the on the horizon at 4.00 am and guided her to the lifeboats with a green flare. After being collected by the Carpathia, Boxhall and the other survivors arrived at Pier 54 in New York on 18 April. While in New York, he served as a witness in the American inquiry into the sinking. He and his fellow surviving officers were allowed to leave New York on the Adriatic on 2 May. After returning to England, Boxhall bore witness again, this time at the British inquiry. Much of his testimony concerned details of the lifeboat lowerings and Titanics navigation, including the many ice warnings. He was also the first person to testify that he saw another vessel in proximity while Titanic sank. Later years and death Following the Titanic debacle, Boxhall briefly served as Fourth Officer on White Star's Adriatic. He was promoted to lieutenant in the RNR on 27 May 1915.London Gazette, 25 June 1915 During the First World War, he was commissioned to serve for one year aboard the battleship before being dispatched to Gibraltar, where he commanded a torpedo boat. Boxhall returned to White Star following the war in May 1919, having married Marjory Beddells two months prior. On 27 May 1923, he was promoted to lieutenant-commander in the RNR.London Gazette, 12 June 1923 He signed on as second officer on board the lead ship of the three Olympic-class vessels which Titanic was the second ship constructed on 30 June 1926. After the White Star-Cunard merger in 1933, he served in senior capacity as first and later chief officer of the , although he was never made a captain in the merchant marine. (The White Star line never promoted any of the surviving Titanic officers to command rank.) After 41 years at sea, he retired in 1940. Boxhall was a generally taciturn and quiet man, usually reluctant to speak about his experiences on the Titanic. However, in 1958, he acted as a technical advisor for the film adaptation of Walter Lord's documentary-style novel, A Night to Remember, and also gave a BBC interview in 1962. His health deteriorated rapidly in the 1960s, and he was eventually hospitalised. The last surviving deck officer of Titanic, Boxhall died of a cerebral thrombosis on 25 April 1967 at the age of 83. According to his last wishes, his ashes were scattered to sea at 41¬∞46N 50¬∞14W ‚Äì the position he had calculated as Titanics final resting place over 50 years earlier (within about 15 miles of the actual Titanic wreck site at 41¬∞43N 49¬∞56W). He is commemorated with a green plaque on The Avenues, Kingston upon Hull.

The album peaked at number 23 on the Billboard 200 chart in the United States and was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on August 25, 1993. Three charting singles were released from the album: \\"Indo Smoke\\" by Mista Grimm, \\"Get It Up\\" by TLC, and \\"Call Me a Mack\\" by Usher Raymond, the latter of which was Usher's first official appearance on a song at the age of 14.

The song \\"Definition of a Thug Nigga\\", recorded by Tupac Shakur for the film, later appeared on his 1997 posthumous album R U Still Down? (Remember Me). Due to the film's casting of two major music stars, much hype surrounded its release. Many were excited to see how the dynamic between Janet Jackson and Tupac Shakur would manifest itself in the film both visually and musically. On the soundtrack, each artist was given a single song.

It was located in census Division No. 2. It was on mile 63 of the Canadian Pacific Railway right of way, southeast of Swift Current and in the NW section 9- township 10- range 7 west of the third meridian. Residential code 105.10 Regional Health Authority: Five Hills.  Demographics  Arbuthnot was enumerated and administrated by the Glen Bain Rural Municipality. All that remains is one home.  History  Etymology Named, according to E.T.Russell, after Sir Robert Arbuthnot, 4th Bt (1864‚Äì1916) or (less probably) after John Arbuthnot. Arbuthnot, Saskatchewan was located about southwest of the City of Moose Jaw, just off of secondary road #611. While it does still appear on the map, the community was never incorporated as a village or town and is not listed in the municipal directory. From Bill Barry's People Places: A Historical Gazetteer of Saskatchewan. The Canadian Pacific Railway built a station at this location between Vanguard and Meyronne in 1932. The preferred name of the settlers had been Stapleton after a pioneer settler, but the CPR held firm on its choice for its siding and the post office (which was open 1932-1969) followed suit. The boom The rural municipality office put out a history book which listed some facts of this community which boomed around the 1940s. Andrew Miller Jr opened the general store in April 1935. In 1936 Andrew Miller Jr built a dance hall which was sold to John Silzer in 1939 and which burned down after a dance in 1942. Joe Schlageter opened a blacksmith's shop from 1936‚Äì40. The first school building was moved into Arbuthnot in May 1944 from Jim Thomas Sr's farm and was converted into a classroom. This was used until the Glen Rosa School was moved into Arbuthnot in the summer of 1949. This building was used until 1957. The school was bought by Arbuthnot Ladies Club. They later donated it to the Glen Bain Lions Club who moved it to Glen Bain 24 June 1981. Exy Grad had a motor service garage next to and north of Andrew J Miller's General Store. Peter Harms bought the General Store from Mr Miller around 1940 and operated it until it burned down on 2 December 1946. Mr Harms sold the store business to Peter Donauer and he opened a store on 18 December 1946 in the building which had previously been used as a school. He built a brand new store in 1947. Peter sold the store to F J Bolen on 24 September 1953. Frank and Tema Bolen operated the store until 1958. The store building was sold to John Thomas and he moved it to his farm south of Meyronne. The decline The post office remained in the Bolen's store building until 1968. The first post office had been in the home of Mrs I P Johnston at the north end of the community and it was later moved into the general store. The Arbuthnot Co-op was incorporated in 1935 and was managed in turn by Ed Faber, Charles Becker, Edwin Hepper, Bill Schlichting and Henry Schlageter. It was dissolved in 1963. The Saskatchewan Pool elevator and the Pioneer Grain elevator were built in 1935. They built a house for the pool agent in 1947. The Saskatchewan Wheat Pool sold their elevator to the Pioneer Co. on 31 July 1974 and moved it to Aneroid on 21 August 1974. The Pioneer elevator was used until early 1984. It was demolished and burned on 21 December 1984. The Pioneer Elevator was managed by Dan Kohlenberg from Bateman, a community to the northeast of Arbuthnot. The Imperial Oil company was located on the west side of the road between Arbuthnot Hall (to the north) and Arbuthnot Co-op (to the south). It was managed by Herman Silzer. The Canadian Oil Co was managed by P Harms.  Education  Arbuthnot no longer has a school, but those who live in or around Arbuthnot are sent to the neighbouring village of Gravelbourg which has a school that covers Kindergarten to Grade 12 serving approximately N/A students.

The battle is sometimes called the Battle of Vinkovo or the Battle of Chernishnya after the local river. Many historians claim that the latter name is more fitting because the village of Tarutino was 8 km from the described events. In the battle Russian troops under the command of Bennigsen defeated French troops under the command of Joachim Murat. Preceding events After the battle of Borodino, Kutuzov realized that the Russian army would not survive one more large engagement and ordered the army to leave Moscow and retreat. At first it retreated in the south-east direction along the Ryazan road. When the army reached the Moskva River it crossed it and turned to the west to the Old Kaluga road. The army pitched camp in a village of Tarutino near Kaluga. At the same time small units of Cossacks continued moving along the Ryazan road misleading French troops under the command of Murat. When he discovered his error he did not retreat but made camp not far from Tarutino in order to keep his eye on the Russian camp. Battle On 18 October 1812 Kutuzov ordered Bennigsen and Miloradovich to attack Murat's corps (26,000 men) with two columns stealthily crossing the forest in the dead of night. Bennigsen's main column included three columns led by Vasily Orlov-Denisov, Karl Gustav von Baggehufwudt and Alexander Osterman-Tolstoy respectively. The other column was supposed to play an auxiliary role. In the darkness most of the troops got lost. By the morning only Cossack troops under the command of General Vasily Orlov-Denisov reached the original destination, suddenly attacked the French troops and captured the French camp with transports and cannons. Since other Russian units came late the French were able to recover. When the Russians emerged from the forest they came under French fire and suffered casualties (among others the commander of the 2nd Corps, General Baggehufwudt, was killed Genealogy Handbook of Baltic Nobility). Murat was forced to retreat to escape being surrounded. The French forces suffered 2,500 dead and 2,000 prisoners, the Russians lost 1,200 dead. Aftermath The defeat infuriated Napoleon, who felt the retreat following the loss would appear to the world as though he had been defeated. As a result, he moved the army south in a final attempt to engage and defeat the Russian main army, but the clash at the Battle of Maloyaroslavets ended with the Russians withdrawing again, and the forces under his command no longer had the horses to overtake Kutuzov and force the issue.Caulaincourt p. 171 The total number of cannon captured by the Russians at Tarutino‚Äî38 pieces in all‚Äîwas noteworthy because until this point in the war, neither side had lost nearly as many guns in a single encounter. This was regarded by the Russian rank-and-file as a sign that the tide of the war was quickly turning in their favor. In popular culture The battle is depicted in Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace.

She does in fact write about Department of Justice statistics that say college-age women are less likely than nonstudent women of the same age to be victims of sexual assault; it is not the case that Grigoriadis was unaware of the department's findings. In addition, the review describes incorrectly Grigoriadis's presentation of statistics from the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network. She showed that there is disagreement over whether the data are sound; it is not the case that she gave the reader 'no reason to believe' the statistics are wrong.\\" Regarding the corrected review, Goldberg stated: \\"Two things are true here. I made a serious error. And one of the book's major claims about its subject isn't correct.\\" Goldberg also said that she would \\"give a kidney and five years of my life\\" to retract her errors and that \\"This whole thing is turning into a round robin of fuckups.\\" According to Vanity Fair, one Times source called the incident \\"a significant error,\\" while another described the fallout as \\"humiliating.\\" Personal life Goldberg lives in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, New York, with her husband, Matthew Ipcar.

A retelling of the story of Cleopatra VII of Egypt, the screenplay was written by Waldemar Young and Vincent Lawrence and was based on Bartlett Cormack's adaptation of historical material. Claudette Colbert stars as Cleopatra, Warren William as Julius Caesar, and Henry Wilcoxon as Mark Antony. Cleopatra was the highest-grossing film of 1934 and received five Academy Award nominations. It was the first DeMille film to receive a nomination for Best Picture. Victor Milner won the Academy Award for Best Cinematography. Plot \\"It was quite difficult to be rolled into a rug and breathe and come out looking pleased with yourself,\\" Colbert remembered. \\"We only had to do that scene once.\\" In 48 BC, Cleopatra vies with her brother Ptolemy for control of Egypt. Pothinos (Leonard Mudie) kidnaps her and Apollodorus (Irving Pichel) and strands them in the desert. When Pothinos informs Julius Caesar that the queen has fled the country, Caesar is ready to sign an agreement with Ptolemy when Apollodorus appears, bearing a gift carpet for the Roman. When Apollodorus unrolls it, Cleopatra emerges, much to Pothinos' surprise. He tries to deny who she is. However, Caesar sees through the deception and Cleopatra soon beguiles Caesar with the prospect of the riches of not only Egypt, but also India. Later, when they are seemingly alone, she spots a sandal peeking out from underneath a curtain and thrusts a spear into the hidden Pothinos, foiling his assassination attempt. Caesar makes Cleopatra the sole ruler of Egypt, and begins an affair with her. Caesar eventually returns to Rome with Cleopatra to the cheers of the masses, but Roman unease is directed at Cleopatra. Cassius (Ian Maclaren), Casca (Edwin Maxwell), Brutus (Arthur Hohl) and other powerful Romans become disgruntled, rightly suspecting that he intends to abolish the Roman Republic and make himself emperor, with Cleopatra as his empress (after divorcing Calpurnia, played by Gertrude Michael). Ignoring the forebodings of Calpurnia, Cleopatra, and a soothsayer (Harry Beresford) who warns him about the Ides of March, Caesar goes to announce his intentions to the Senate. Before he can do so, he is assassinated. Cleopatra is heartbroken at the news. At first, she wants to go to him, but Apollodorus tells her that Caesar did not love her, only her power and wealth, and that Egypt needs her. They return home. Bitter rivals Marc Antony and Octavian (Ian Keith) are named co-rulers of Rome. Antony, disdainful of women, invites Cleopatra to meet with him in Tarsus, intending to bring her back to Rome as a captive. Enobarbus (C. Aubrey Smith), his close friend, warns Antony against meeting Cleopatra, but he goes anyway. She entices him to her barge and throws a party with many exotic animals and beautiful dancers, and soon seduces him. Together, they sail to Egypt. King Herod (Joseph Schildkraut), who has secretly allied himself with Octavian, visits the lovers. He informs Cleopatra privately that Rome and Octavian can be appeased if Antony were to be poisoned. Herod also tells Antony the same thing, with the roles reversed. Antony laughs off his suggestion, but a reluctant Cleopatra, reminded of her duty to Egypt by Apollodorus, tests a poison on a condemned murderer (Edgar Dearing) to see how it works. Before Antony can drink the fatal wine, however, they receive news that Octavian has declared war. Antony orders his generals and legions to gather, but Enobarbus informs him that they have all deserted out of loyalty to Rome. Enobarbus tells his comrade that he can wrest control of Rome away from Octavian by having Cleopatra killed, but Antony refuses to consider it. Enobarbus bids Antony goodbye, as he will not fight for an Egyptian queen against Rome. A short montage sequence shows the fighting between the forces of Antony and Octavian, ending in the naval Battle of Actium. Antony fights on with the Egyptian army, and is defeated. Octavian and his soldiers surround and besiege Antony and Cleopatra. Antony is mocked when he offers to fight them one by one. Without his knowledge, Cleopatra opens the gate and offers to cede Egypt in return for Antony's life in exile, but Octavian turns her down. Meanwhile, Antony believes that she has deserted him for his rival and stabs himself. When Cleopatra returns, she is heartbroken to find him dying. They reconcile before he perishes. Then, with the gates breached, Cleopatra kills herself with a poisonous snake and is found sitting on her throne, dead.

Heavy costumes complicated matters further. Due to Colbert's fear of snakes, DeMille put off her death scene for as long as possible. At the time of shooting, he walked onto the set with a boa constrictor wrapped around his neck and handed Colbert a tiny garden snake. On July 1, 1934, the Motion Picture Production Code began to be rigidly enforced and expanded by Joseph Breen. Talkie films made before that date are generally referred to as \\"pre-Code\\" films. However, DeMille was able to get away with using more risqu√© imagery than he would be able to do in his later productions. He opens the film with an apparently naked, but strategically lit slave girl holding up an incense burner in each hand as the title appears on screen. The film is also memorable for the sumptuous art deco look of its sets (by Hans Dreier) and costumes (by Travis Banton), the atmospheric music composed by Rudolph George Kopp, and for DeMille's legendary set piece of Cleopatra's seduction of Antony, which takes place on Cleopatra's barge. Colbert later said, \\"DeMille's films were special: somehow when he put everything together, there was a special kind of glamour and sincerity.\\" Release Cleopatra received its world premiere on August 16, 1934 at the Paramount Theatre in New York City. The premiere audience, which gave the film an ovation, included social leaders, diplomats, and famous stars of stage and film. In its first week at the Paramount, the film set an annual record with 110,383 admissions. Reception Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times called it \\"one of the director's most ambitious spectacles\\" and singled out Wilcoxon's performance as \\"excellent, especially in the more dramatic sequences.\\" Film Daily called it a \\"sumptuous historical drama\\" with a \\"strong cast\\" and \\"good entertainment values\\". John Mosher of The New Yorker wrote that \\"Even as extravaganza it's moderate\\", and called the dialogue \\"the worst I have ever heard in the talkies.\\" Variety agreed that \\"Often the lines drew titters that are not being angled for\\", but maintained, \\"Photographically the picture is superb.\\" In his Movie Guide, film critic Leonard Maltin gave Cleopatra 3.5 out of 4 stars and wrote, \\"Opulent DeMille version of Cleopatra doesn't date badly, stands out as one of his most intelligent films, thanks in large part to fine performances by all.\\" Accolades At the 7th Academy Awards in 1935, Cleopatra won for Best Cinematography (Victor Milner). It was nominated for four more awards: Outstanding Production (Paramount), Best Assistant Director (Cullen Tate), Best Film Editing (Anne Bauchens), and Best Sound Recording (Franklin Hansen). In the January 1935 issue of The New Movie Magazine, Claudette Colbert's performance in Cleopatra was named the \\"Movie Highlight of the Year\\" for August 1934, the month in which the film premiered. In 2002, the American Film Institute nominated Cleopatra for the AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions list. Home media Cleopatra, along with The Sign of the Cross, Four Frightened People, The Crusades and Union Pacific, was released on DVD in 2006 by Universal Studios as part of the five-disc box set The Cecil B.

Plot In 47 BC, Egypt is in civil war. Cleopatra VII, Egypt's rightful Queen, is in exile, while her sister Arsinoe and brother, Ptolemy have stolen the throne. Roman general Julius Caesar comes to Alexandria to collect Egypt's tax debt. Cleopatra smuggles herself into the palace wrapped in a carpet; a gift from her to Caesar. The two spend the night together, and the next morning, Cleopatra and Ptolemy are betrothed to marry by Caesar. Cleopatra is proclaimed Queen of Egypt. Caesar then orders the death of the unscrupulous Prime Minister Pothinus, prompting Ptolemy and Arsinoe to flee and return with their army to drive their sister out of Alexandria. A battle breaks out between the Romans and the Egyptian forces, and in the process, Alexandria's great library is burned to the ground. Arsinoe and Ptolemy are pursued by Roman forces. Arsinoe is captured while Ptolemy is killed when his carriage overturns. Cleopatra has Arsinoe strangled in her cell. Cleopatra and Caesar take a 2-month journey down the Nile aboard one of the Queen's elegant ships. Caesar comes under fire from the Roman Senate and his critic Brutus due to a crisis in Pontus. Caesar promptly leaves for Rome. Unbeknownst to Caesar, Cleopatra is pregnant with his child. A son is born to the queen roughly nine months later; he is named Caesarion, in honor of his father. Back in Rome, Caesar invites Cleopatra to stay at one of his villas, just outside Rome. With her, she brings the couple's infant son. In front of his people (including wife Calpurnia), Cleopatra declares that Caesar is her son's father, publicly forcing his hand, and demanding that her son be allowed to rule both Egypt and Rome invoking the consternation of Brutus and Cassius. Believing that he should hold the same status as his Egyptian lover, Caesar demands he be declared King of Rome. Although they are hesitant to do so, the senate eventually grants Caesar's request. Now having been declared king, Caesar prepares his a conquest of Parthia. Although he accepts Caesarion as his child, Caesar denies the queen's request, causing Cleopatra to leave him. Just before her return to Egypt, Cleopatra soon learns that Caesar has been assassinated at the hands of Brutus, Cassius and other senators. The burdens of ruling fall on the shoulders of Caesar's Roman heir and nephew, Octavian and Mark Antony who declares revenge and begins a war against Brutus and Cassius. In the process, both Cassius and Brutus commit suicide. Though Octavian desecrates Brutus' corpse by severing and displaying his head, creating a rift between him and Mark Antony. In spending time with together, Antony and Cleopatra fall in love. Antony turns away from her for the sake of Rome. Antony reluctantly marries Octavian's sister, Octavia, in order to strengthen his alliance and co-ruling with the new emperor. Antony returns to Egypt. Defying his Roman beliefs against polygamy, Antony marries Cleopatra in Antioch, claiming that her son, Caesarion, is heir to not only Egypt, but also Rome. Upon hearing of Antony's claim, Octavian wages war against the two lovers. Antony leads Cleopatra's fleet into the legendary Battle of Actium. Octavian defeats Antony, which demoralizes he and his men. Cleopatra sends her son to India while Antony prepares a last stand. His army is overwhelmed by Octavian's army. Antony returns with his defeated soldiers, badly wounded and soon dies of his injuries. Cleopatra is devastated. Octavian arrives in Alexandria, demanding that Cleopatra join him in Rome as his prisoner. She agrees and asks that her son be allowed to rule Egypt. Octavian refuses, but allows Antony to have an Egyptian burial. Cleopatra lets an Egyptian asp bite her, and dies shortly after. Her handmaidens quickly follow their queen's example. Octavian's men break through the doors, only to discover that the queen is dead. Octavian approaches Cleopatra and finds that she is dead. Then he says \\"You have won, Cleopatra\\" and then leaves.

Ione came into existence in November, 1863 after silver was discovered by one Mr. P. A. Havens in the Shoshone Range. While most of the mining in the area (the Union Mining District) was closer to communities such as Union and Grantsville, Ione developed as a trade and milling center. Members of the community were shortly petitioning the territorial government for the formation of a new county and in January, 1864 Nye county was organized within the Nevada Territory; Ione was granted a stipend of $800.00 with which to construct the county's first courthouse. Within three years development at Belmont had created enough excitement to lure away a great percentage of Ione's population, and in February 1867 the county seat was removed to that location. Ione would find its second boom in 1896 when a new 10-stamp mill was built by one E. W. Brinell. In 1897 A. Phelps Stokes arrived in the Union District and purchased the majority of the mining and milling interests in the district, further facilitating Ione's resurrection. July, 1898 saw a significant drop in the value of silver, and Ione deflated once again. The town would see one more resurgence, about 1912, when attention was drawn to abundant cinnabar deposits in the area. This last boom was again short lived, ending in 1914, although the recovery of mercury would persist in the district into the 1930s. Ione's post office closed for the last time on April 30, 1959. In the 1970's, Hugh Marshall purchased most of the town and 24 square miles surrounding the town. Name Named from the mining district which was organized by P. A. Havens in 1863.

Thiru added for respect. As most of the royal names were Rama varma, Kerala Varma, Raja Raja Varma, this was also a method to distinguish from each other was the Maharajah of Travancore from 1758 until his death in 1798. He succeeded his uncle Marthanda Varma, who is credited with the title of \\"maker of modern Travancore\\". During his reign Dharma Raja not only retained all the territories his predecessor had gained but administered the kingdom with success. He was addressed as Dharma Raja on account of his strict adherence to Dharma Sastra, the principles of justice by providing asylum to thousands of Hindus and Christians fleeing Malabar during the religious and military onslaught of Tipu Sultan. Early life Rama Varma was born in 1724 AD as the son of the Senior Rani of AttingalThe Maharanis of Travancore are known as Attingal Thampuratties with her husband Prince Kerala Varma Koil Thampuran of the Kilimanoor palace. He had a brother Prince Makayiram Thirunal, grandfather of Irayimman Thampi, who died young and thus Karthika Thirunal was destined to come into power. His mother was adopted from the royal house of Kolathunad in 1718 by the then King of VenadInformation from Travancore State Manual by Nagam Aiya into the Travancore Royal Family. He was born into a time of political turmoil caused by the refractory Lords, the Ettuveetil Pillamar as also enemies of Venad such as the Rajah of Kayamkulam. When Karthika Thirunal was only four years of age, in 1728, his father died foiling an assassination bid by the Kayamkulam Rajah, when the prince along with his parents were traveling from Haripad to the domains of the Vanjipuzha Thampuran, a Brahmin chief, at Budhanur.Travancore State Manual by T.K. Velu Pillai, Page260 As he grew up, he took part actively in the military conquests of his uncle Maharajah Marthanda Varma and assisted him in establishing the modern state of Travancore by annexing kingdom after kingdom up to the Cochin to Venad. Succession and initial career With the death of his uncle Marthanda Varma in 1758, Karthika Thirunal Rama Varma succeeded to the Travancore musnud. With the able services of the Dalawa Ayyapan Marthanda Pillai, Karthika Thirunal began his reign. Under his uncle's reign, Travancore had gained the reputation of being the most powerful state in Kerala and hence, many of the neighboring chiefs wished to execute friendship treaties with the Maharajah. The fortunes of the Cochin royal family were at the lowest ebb. A very small portion of their original territory alone remained in the Cochin Raja's possession. From 1755 AD, the Zamorin (Samoothiri) of Calicut Kingdom, was in possession of the major portions of Cochin. Although Marthanda Varma had promised help against the Zamorin by signing a treaty of alliance in 1756 with Cochin, he took no steps to help. Most of the barons of Kochi had sided with the enemy. The Dutch were the permanent friends and protectors of Cochin, but they withdrew their contingents from the field when the Zamorin promised to give back to them 'Chetwai' which he had conquered from them, on his way to Cochin. The Raja of Cochin deputed his nephew to ask for prompt assistance from Rama Varma. The recollections of the past shady dealings and breach of faith on the part of the Cochin rulers naturally had raised apprehensions in the Maharaja that his neighbour might not adhere to his promise when he felt his position secure. The same feeling might have prevented Marthanda Varma, his uncle, from rendering assistance immediately. Months passed. At last the Raja of Cochin met with Rama Varma to press his request. He strengthened his promises with the sanction of religion. On the 25th of the Tamil month 'Adi' of 937 ME (1761 AD) the Raja of Cochin read the terms of their treaty and solemnly swore to abide by its terms, in the presence of the Deity Sthanumoorthy of Suchindrum Temple near Cape Commorin, the ministers of the two kingdoms and the spiritual authorities also being present and the signed document was delivered to the representative of the Maharaja of Travancore. In pursuance of the treaty, the Travancore Maharaja commanded his Minister Dalawa Ayyappan Marthanda Pillai and his Dutch General D'Lannoy to proceed to the north at the head of a large army to liberate Cochin kingdom from the clutches of Zamorin of Calicut kingdom. The account of this campaign is best given in the words of late Mr. C. Achyutha Menon, a native of Cochin, whose acquaintance with the records of the Cochin government, to which he was secretary for a long time, enabled him to speak with unassailable authority. The Zamorin sent an express messenger to Trivandrum to beg the Maharaja to stay the hands of his General. Just as his uncle Marthanda Varma had ordered him and Dalawa Ramayyan to desist from the conquest of Cochin, when they were about to do so in 929 M.E., Rama Varma Maharaja now ordered his Dalawa to advance no further. In 1759 AD, the Rajah of Cochin sent his nephew to sign a treaty with Travancore. In the same year, a few months later, the Rajah himself visited Travancore along with his minister Paliath Achan and signed a treaty with Travancore and secured aid to free his territories from the control of the Zamorin of Calicut. The Zamorin's request to forgive him was complied with in 1763 and in the next year the Zamorin visited Padmanabhapuram, capital of Venad and signed a treaty of friendship and reimbursed to Travancore the expenses of the war amounting to Rs . The little kingdoms of Parur and Alangad were also annexed to Travancore after pensioning off the ruling families. In 932 ME, Marthanda Varma had projected the construction of a line of fortifications on the northern frontier, but his death the following year prevented anything substantial being done. The experience gained in the course of the war with the Zamorin convinced the Dewan and the General, of the necessity of continuing and strengthening the lines which would not only protect Cochin in some measure from any possible aggression by the Zamorin, but would also be serviceable to Travancore in the event of an invasion from Mysore. The scheme was then taken up. The Raja of Cochin was in entire agreement with the proposal. The line of fortifications was taken from the sea near the island of Vaipeen right up to the ghats covering a distance of nearly . The Raja of Cochin agreed to bear a portion of the costs in addition to permitting the construction of the many portions passing through the Cochin territory. In fact the Dutch records stated that Maharajah Marthanda Varma deliberately refrained from annexing Cochin on an earlier occasion so as to maintain a buffer-state between his kingdom and Mysore of Hyder Ali. The famous Nedum Kotta or 'the Northern Defense-Line of Travancore' subsequently became a major obstacle in Tipu Sultan's attempt to conquer Travancore; he called it \\"the contemptible wall\\". Certain territorial disputes arose between Travancore and the Nawab of Arcot which were eventually settled, though the Maharajah had to part with large sums of money and some territories mainly because the British East India Company's officers had compelled him, as the Nawab was a familiar figure at Madras and his propensities for perpetual borrowing at extra hazardous rates of interest enlisted their sympathies. The Maharaja obtained in return, lands in Shencottah and the temple at Cape Comorin, which were at the time not part of Travancore but were desired by the Maharajah to round off his dominions.V. Nagam Aiya, Travancore State Manual, Vol. 1, pp. 357-373 Dharma Raja and Hyder Ali Hyder Ali Hyder Ali had usurped the throne of Mysore and was keen to invade and bring the smaller coastal kingdoms of Malabar and Travancore under his sway. As early as 1756, he had invaded Malabar at the instance of the ruler of Palghat to help him regain his territories captured by the Zamorin of Calicut. The Zamorin was driven away and saved his kingdom by agreeing to pay the princely sum of Rs.1.2 million to Hyder Ali. In 1766, Hyder invaded Malabar a second time. The Rajah of Kolathunad fled to Travancore, while the Zamorin, after hastening his family's departure to Travancore, committed suicide in his own palace. Hyder Ali also started treaty negotiations with the Dutch who, since their defeat in the Battle of Colachel had been in awe of Travancore, kept the Maharajah of Travancore informed of all developments. What Hyder wanted was a free passage to Travancore through the Dutch territories. The Dutch Governor replied that he had informed Batavia of Hyder's request and was waiting for a reply. Soon rumors of a proposed invasion of Travancore started developing after the Maharajah refused to stop construction of the Nedumkotta, which passed near the Dutch possessions, through Cochin territories, and because he had given refuge to Hyder Ali's enemies. Hyder asked the kings of Cochin and Travancore to pay the expenses of his Malabar campaign. The tribute to be paid by Cochin was Rs.400,000 and 10 elephants, while Travancore was asked to pay Rs.1.5 million and 30 elephants. Hyder added that if Travancore refused, \\"He will pay a visit\\". While the Rajah of Cochin agreed, Karthika Thirunal of Travancore replied, stating that it was \\"neither to please him nor in accordance with his advice that the invasion of Malabar was undertaken\\". But he stated that if Hyder withdrew from Malabar and reinstated the Kolathunad and Calicut Rajahs to their thrones, he would agree to a payment. This was taken by Hyder as a threat, but before he could plan an attack on Travancore, he had to return to Mysore.V. Nagam Aiya, Travancore State Manual, Vol. 1, pp. 373-385 Dharma Raja and Tipu Sultan Dharma Raja In 1788, a rebellion broke out in the territories and vassal states of Mysore, now ruled by Tipu Sultan, son and successor of Hyder Ali. Tipu entered the regions of Malabar and Coorg to put these rebellions down, engaging in tactics that included the forced deportation to Seringapatam and the conversion to Islam by force, of Hindus.Logan, Malabar Manual, Volume 1, p. 452 The royal families of Malabar and large numbers of Hindu and Christian families fled to Travancore, where they were received and treated hospitably by the Maharajah.Logan, p. 454Menon, A history of Travancore from the earliest times, Volume 1, p. 212 Tipu Sultan now demanded that the Rajah of Cochin, who had accepted the status of a vassal, to claim Alangad and Parur so as to provide Tipu with a pretext for an invasion of Travancore.Menon, p. 213 However, the Rajah diplomatically assured Tipu that he would convince the Rajah of Travancore to become a vassal of Tipu like himself. Tipu then sent envoys to Travancore with a 'Khareeta', wherein he stated that \\"I have learnt that you desire to cultivate friendship with our Sircar..\\". The Maharajah received Tipu's envoys in the presence of an East India Company representative, which was taken as an affront by Tipu. The Maharajah also negotiated with the British for a force to assist in the defense of Travancore, anticipating an attack from Tipu Sultan. Finally in 1789, arguing that the Nedumkotta passed illegally through the territories of Cochin, his vassal state, Tipu Sultan gathered his entire force in Malabar and marched to invade Travancore.V. Nagaim Aiya, Travancore State Manual, Vol. 1, pp. 395-413 Tipu and his forces reached the Nedumkotta line which protected Travancore's northern frontier and launched an attack in late December 1789.Menon, p. 227 But a small number Travancore soldiers managed to change the course of events, by opening fire on the 14,000 Mysore infantry from a close cover that killed the Mysorean officer leading a bayonet charge.Aiya, p. 394 The Mysorean column, hemmed in by the confines of the wall, retreated in confusion and Tipu Sultan himself was carried away by the crowd. His palanquin, seals, rings, sword and other personal ornaments fell into the hands of the Travancore armies under the Dewan Raja Kesavadas Pillai.Menon, p. 228 Tipu fell back into the ditch twice before scrambling out and the occasional lameness which he suffered until his death was due to the contusions suffered by his fall into the ditches of Travancore.Aiya, p. 395 Tippu sent a letter on 19 January 1790 to Budruz Zuman Khan. It said: In the following weeks, Tipu Sultan, stung by his defeat, complained to the English Governor Holland at Madras in a pre-dated letter that his soldiers were searching for fugitives from Malabar and that it was Travancore which had taken the offensive. Finally, Tipu attacked the Nedumkotta again after waiting for three months for further reinforcements to arrive from Coorg, Bangalore and Seringapatam. For nearly a month, the Travancore army under the protection of the Nedumkotta lines, managed to defend the state. However, finally a breach of about 1 km (3/4 mile) in length was effected and the Mysorean army entered Travancore. Soon, the entire Nedumkotta fell into the hands of Tipu Sultan, who captured large quantities of ammunition and 200 cannons. The British forces stationed to assist Travancore did not provide aid to Travancore, but remained passive spectators, since they had not received orders from Governor Hollond to fight with the Sultan, much to the despair of the Maharajah. When orders were finally received, it was too late and the British Commander thought it injudicious to commit his soldiers against the large Mysorean army. Tipu's army now devastated the whole of northern Travancore and reached Alwaye and camped on the Periyar River, although Tipu's officers advised the Sultan against it. Hindu temples were destroyed and the subjects fled to the forests. The entire country was laid waste with fire and sword. Even Christians were not spared. The Dewan Raja Kesavadas of Travancore toiled ceaselessly and raised batteries at various places further south, and surrounded them with deep ditches and prepared to obstruct Tipu from proceeding further into Travancore. Tippu Sultan, 1792 The Sultan and his army now moved to a place where the Travancore army had built a wall across the river obstructing the water, leaving the river-bed dry. In spite of the warnings of some of his Generals, Tipu decided to wage a battle here at night, certain of his superior numbers. Tipu first ordered two of his kushoons to advance and take over the defences which they accomplished with valour. At day-break, the Travancoreans broke down the retaining wall, letting the water flood onto the Mysorean forces. A large number of Tipu's soldiers were killed by the sudden flood and the road of succour and assistance to the advance guard was cut off. The remaining forces were defeated by a sudden attack by Travancore under the Dewan and an able General known as Kali Kutty Nair (Posthumously elevated to Kali Kutty Pillai). Of the soldiers of Tipu, who formed the advance guard, none returned to the presence of the Sultan. Three or four hundred cavalry soldiers met with death in front of him. Tipu was begged off his Palki by his General Kamruddin Khan, who fell at his feet, asking him to retreat to his camp. Kamruddin saw to it that Tipu was carried on the shoulders of loyal soldiers across the waters to the other side of the river. The Sultan's Palki with bed, some personal ornaments, and a dagger fell into the hands of Travancore soldiers. Although the Sultan was once again defeated and prevented from gaining any more ground in Travancore, the Dewan increased the garrison of the forts further South and maintained a military force ready for battle in any case. Meanwhile, Governor- General Cornwallis removed the acting Governor of Madras Mr. Hollond from his post, because he had not provided any aid to Travancore in the battle. The new Governor mobilized the British forces stationed in Travancore to support the Maharajah. Hearing of this, Tipu Sultan decided to retreat from Travancore and Malabar to his own kingdom, to avoid war with the British. But war did occur, in which Travancore provided its forces to the British. The Third Anglo-Mysore War led by the Governor-General Cornwallis in person eventually led to the defeat of Tipu Sultan at his capital Seringapatnam in 1792. Tipu Sultan surrendered and the Treaty of Seringapatam was signed. The terms of surrender were particularly harsh in that Tipu had to hand over two of his sons as hostages to British custody until he cleared the amount of 33 million fixed as the costs of the British campaign against him.V. Nagam Aiya, Travancore State Manual, pp. 413-429 Treaty with the British Following the Treaty of Seringapatanam, the British demanded large sums from Travancore for the expenses of the war although by treaty they had to bear the expenses. Further, a huge amount was collected from Tippu himself towards the war-expenses. The Maharaja paid it as he was not in a military position to oppose the English. A subsidiary alliance was made between Travancore and the British by which a subsidiary force of the East India Company was to be stationed in Travancore. Besides, the Maharajah was also to help the British during times of need.V. Nagam Aiya, Travancore State Manual, pp. 433-437 Reforms * Communications were opened to facilitate trade and business in the state by the Maharajah under the able Dewanship of Rajah Kesavadas. Ports were improved and various new products were exported by Travancore during this reign. Ship building was also given importance and several developments in this regard took place. * Gold coins known as Anantharayan Panam, 'Chinna Panam' and 'Ananthavarahan' were minted in Travancore in addition to a large bullion of silver, coined as 'Chakrams (pronounced as 'chuck-rums')'. * During wartime taxes were raised but after the payments to the British and overcoming wartime expenses, these taxes were remitted. * The capital at Thiruvananthapuram was developed and infrastructure like bridges and other public works such as canals for irrigation were constructed. Bazaars and shopping centers were started for the benefit of the people. * The fortifications were bettered as also the ammunition and weapon manufacture was undertaken with greater vigor, particularly the manufacturing of guns. Palaces in different parts of the country were developed and new ones built. * An interesting insight into the religious tolerance of the Maharajah is gained through a letter by Pope Clement XIV wherein he thanked the Maharajah for the kindness to the members of his church in Travancore and officially placed all the Christians in Travancore under the protection of the sovereign. Kathakali playwright and composer As the composer of Kathakali Plays (attakadha). He set a systematic curriculum for teaching Kathakali. Being a good vocalist and scholar in music and dance, he composed excellent KritisCompositions which have enriched Carnatic music. He was perhaps the first violinist from the royal family. He has to his credit nearly 150 compositions. It was with the advent of the Kathakali plays of Karthika Thirunal that many reforms were brought in Kathakali. Changes were implemented in the structure of plays and in their technique to be adopted during presentation. Priority was given for sringara padas.padas or verses in which amour is the predominant mood The rule that each character should enter the stage with sringara padas was introduced by him. Kathakali characters must enter by presenting pada in Padi raga. All his kathakali plays attained much popularity and fame on account of its technical superiority in stage presentation, variety and vividness of characters and the story. He has to his credit seven plays: *Rajasooyam, *Subhadrapaharanam, *Gandharvavijayam, *Panchali Svayamvaram, *Bakavadham, *Kalayanasougandhikam (Thekkan or southern style) *Narakasuravadham.It is believed that the last portion of Narakasura Vadham was completed by his nephew AswathiThirunal Demise and legacy The maharajah died on 17 February 1798, at the age of 74, after a long reign that was prosperous, save for the invasion of the kingdom by Tipu Sultan. He had maintained the sovereignty of Travancore and protected it from destruction by the superior Mysore forces. He maintained the friendship cultivated with the British by his uncle Marthanda Varma. More importantly, he came to be known as Dharma Raja due to the asylum he provided to the thousands of people from Malabar fleeing to escape forced proselytization by Tipu Sultan. So pleased were these subjects of Malabar that many families of kings and nobles stayed back in Travancore. Karthika Thirunal Maharajah had four wives or Ammachis. His first wife was Panapillai Kali Amma Nagamani Amma from Vadasseri. His other three wives hailed from Thiruvattar, Arumana, and Nagercoil. He constructed four Ammaveedus for his wives in Trivandrum in the last decade of the 18th century and these families are his descendants. The Maharajah's brother married from the Puthumana Ammaveedu and his grandson was the poet Irayimman Thampi. The Maharajah's descendant from Arumana Ammaveedu married Balarama Varma, his successor, and their descendant was the consort of Visakham Thirunal Maharajah.This information is from \\"Thiruvananthapurathinte Eithihaasam\\" See also * Padmanabhapuram Palace * Mysore invasion of Kerala * Marthandavarma (novel) References *Swathithirunnal Website Accessed on 7 August 2006 *Kerala Government website accessed on 7 August 2006. *Dept of Archaeology, Kerala Government website accessed on 7 August 2006.

She co- founded the school in 1946 with Indian philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurti, Italian literary critic Guido Ferrando, and English author Aldous Huxley. Through her family's involvement in the Theosophical Society she became acquainted with Jiddu Krishnamurti and his ailing younger brother Nitya in 1922. Rosalind developed close ties with the brothers, and sometime after her 1927 marriage to their fellow Indian associate D. Rajagopal, she and Krishnamurti began a long-term romantic relationship. This became a source of controversy when it was publicly revealed in the 1991 book Lives in the Shadow with J. Krishnamurti, written by her daughter Radha Rajagopal Sloss. Early life She was born on in Buffalo, New York, to John Williams and Sophia Waldow. Christened Rosalind Edith, she was the youngest of four daughters, noted for her beauty and vivacity. During 1918, Sophia Williams left her husband and moved to Hollywood with her daughters. It was through Rosalind's Theosophist sister Erma, that she met also-Theosophist Mary Gray. In 1922 Gray enlisted Rosalind to help with the newly arrived from India Jiddu brothers, who were staying at Gray's estate in Ojai, California.Lutyens, Mary (1975).

Jiddu Krishnamurti (18951986), then twenty-seven years old, was being groomed by the quasi-mystical, pan- religious society as the \\"vehicle\\" of the World Teacher a messianic, Christ- like spiritual leader and teacher, imminently expected by many Theosophists. His brother Jiddu Nityananda (\\"Nitya\\", 18981925), was charged with fulfilling administrative and organizational duties related to Krishnamurti's presumed mission. Rosalind was asked to be a companion and nurse to Nitya, who was suffering from tuberculosis, and became close to both. This relationship lead to her being one of the witnesses to the reputed strange experiences that affected Krishnamurti in Ojai during AugustSeptember1922.Lutyens1975, Turning Point\\" of the Process\\" . Because of her special relationship with the Jiddus, Rosalind moved with them through influential Theosophical circles, making the acquaintance of Annie Besant, Charles Webster Leadbeater and authors Emily and Mary Lutyens. She accompanied the brothers to India and Australia in 1925. In Sydney Nitya's tuberculosis grew worse, hastening the trio's return to the more beneficial climate of Ojai in July of that year. According to Rajagopal Sloss, Rosalind and Nitya were in love when he died in leaving Rosalind permanently affected. Marriage and friendships In 1927 Rosalind married Rajagopalacharya Desikacharya (commonly D. Rajagopal, 19001993), while in London, in a wedding organized with great care and enthusiasm by Besant, who was approving of the couple's relationship.Rajagopal Sloss, Radha (1991).

The three lived in close proximity in Ojai from the late 1920s through the 1960s, and the Rajagopals were closely involved with Krishnamurti when he broke with the Theosophical Society and began his independent speaking career in 1929. Rosalind's marriage was not a happy one; after the birth of her daughter Radha in 1931, the couple became physically estranged, and their relationship was never close again.Rajagopal Sloss1991, .

However, the ending of the relationship was not amicable, and damaged their friendship, which never recovered.Rajagopal Sloss1991, ; Lutyens1996, ch.22.

Krishnamurti disassociated from the school in the early 1960s as the relationships of Rosalind, D. Rajagopal, and himself became increasingly acrimonious.

Calhoun plots to eliminate his rival when tragedy strikes: Louise's brother, the young Henry Poindexter, is murdered. All clues point to Maurice Gerald as the assassin. At the same time, a headless rider is spotted in the environs of the Poindexter plantation.  Main characters  *Maurice Gerald: a horse catcher (mustanger), who loves Louise Poindexter *Louise Poindexter: Henry Poindexter's sister, who loves Maurice Gerald *Henry Poindexter: Louise Poindexter's brother, who goes missing *Captain Cassius Calhoun: Louise and Henry Poindexter's cousin *Zebulon \\"Zeb\\" Stump: a hunter and Maurice Gerald's friend *Phelim O'Neill: Maurice Gerald's servant and foster brother *Woodley Poindexter: the father of Henry and Louise Poindexter *Isidora: a Mexican who loved Maurice Gerald *Miguel Diaz: a Mexican who hates Maurice and loved Isidora  Origins of the novel  The novel was reportedly inspired by Creed Taylor's (1820‚Äì1906) true story of El Muerto, the Headless Horseman. Taylor was a veteran of the Texas Revolution, the War with Mexico, the Civil War and an Indian fighter, who was also involved in the Sutton‚ÄìTaylor feud, once considered the state's longest and deadliest feud. Historian J. Warren Hunter, through his discussions with Taylor, learned a lot of Texas history firsthand at the Taylor home in Kimble County. Among the many recollections Taylor conveyed to Hunter, was a particularly outrageous one which involved his cronies, Alexander Anderson \\"Bigfoot\\" Wallace and John McPeters. Taylor claimed the event occurred in 1848. By then, Wallace, a survivor of the doomed Mier Expedition, had become a famed Indian fighter. Although McPeters fought at San Jacinto, he is almost forgotten today. During the War with Mexico, both men were Texas Rangers commanded by the fierce Mabry \\"Mustang\\" Gray (1817‚Äì1848). As Creed's story appears in Hunter's 1898 manuscript, The Life of Creed Taylor; Bigfoot and McPeters tracked and killed a number of Mexican horse thieves near the Nueces, south of present-day Uvalde. Wallace decided to use the ringleader's body as a warning to others. Bigfoot decapitated the dead man, called Vuavis or Vidal, and the two put his body on a wild stallion that the two had caught and tied between two trees. They thrust his head into his sombrero, secured by a strap and tied to the pommel of the saddle. Then they set the horse loose to roam the hilly countryside. Creed didn't place himself in the story, but did know the horse thief who had lost his head. One of Taylor's friends, Bate Berry, captured Lt. Vuavis during the Siege of Bexar (December 1835). Creed watched as Vuavis, who had deserted, willingly spilled all his Mexican military info to Berry, who had a reputation for scalping enemies. They finally released the shaken captive. Years later, Vuavis, alias \\"Vidal,\\" and his gang began terrorizing south Texas ranchers and stealing their cattle. It was then that Bigfoot and McPeters got on his trail, and shortened his career. Travelers and soldiers at Fort Inge near Uvalde soon were reporting sightings of a wily headless rider.  Various narratives  The original story spawned various retellings. After Mayne Reid, James T. DeShields was the next interpreter. A dry-goods salesman, he was known for one novel, Cynthia Ann Parker. DeShields wrote pieces for the \\"Fort Worth Press\\" based on material he bought from old Texans; and his sometimes exaggerated articles were presented as factual. In 1906, J. Warren Hunter sold his Taylor interview manuscript to DeShields, who lightly rewrote parts. 21 years after Hunter's death, he published Tall Men with Long Rifles, an account of Taylor's adventures in the Texas Revolution. In 1924, J. Warren Hunter's son, J. Marvin Hunter (editor of Frontier Times), took his turn. He personalized crimes of Vidal's rustlers, who were now stealing horses from Creed Taylor. The younger Hunter vividly sketched events, while changing the time to 1850, the year of a sweeping Indian raid that drained frontier manpower, leaving few defenders against bandits. John McPeters disappeared from the narrative altogether. The younger Hunter declared that Capt. Reid's novel was based on fact. Folklorist J. Frank Dobie changed the tale in his 1928 Tales of Old Time Texas, suggesting the headless rider was once a \\"ghostly guard of the mine of the long-abandoned Candelaria Mission on the Nueces to protect it from profane prospectors\\".

In 1951, he ran as a candidate of the Democratic and Socialist Union of the Resistance for the seat of French India in the French National Assembly (Assembl√©e Nationale). Goubert won the election with an overwhelming majority of 99.3% of the vote. Goubert Avenue in Puducherry In a 1949 referendum held in French India, all French possessions in India except Chandannagar voted to remain with France. However, pro-Indian factions in French India gained the upper hand in the following year. Initially, Goubert attempted to negotiate a special status for French India that would make it autonomous from both France and India. However, neither the French nor Indian governments agreed to the demand. By 1954, Goubert shifted his loyalty towards the pro-India faction and supported the annexation of French possessions to the Indian Union. In March 1954, he traveled to Pondicherry and took part in an agitation demanding the merger of French India with the Indian Union. On 29 June 1954, his parliamentary immunity was abolished. On 1 November 1954, France signed treaties transferring sovereignty of French possessions to India, ending Goubert's tenure in the French National Assembly. Death Edouard Goubert died in Asho in Bangalore district, Karnataka on 14 August 1979.

Best known for her role as Jenny Kelly on Hey Dad..!, she also appeared in Sons and Daughters and Home and Away. Early career Monahan got her start in the industry from her fashion designer father. She was the in-house model for his children's clothing line, and later, went on to appear in over 100 television and print ads. Hey Dad..! Monahan auditioned for the role of Jenny in Hey Dad..! when she was six. Even though the producers were looking for a younger actress, her small stature at the time, combined with her ability to read the script, helped her to win the role.Monahan, Sarah on Where Are They Now? (6 May 2007), Seven Network After filming the pilot, she spent a short time on the Australian soap opera Sons and Daughters, playing the role of Cassie Hunt in 24 episodes that first aired in early 1986. She returned to filming on Hey Dad..! that year, and stayed with the show for six years, departing in 1993 one year before the show concluded. She became the primary income earner for her family when her father died just before Hey Dad...! debuted. Later career Monahan returned to Australian television for a short time as Heather in another long running Australian soap opera, Home and Away, in 1995 and alongside fellow Hey Dad..! actress, Simone Buchanan in Pacific Drive, performing a non-speaking role. Monahan later founded ShrimpTank Productions, which works in social media and search engine optimisation, along with Going Down, a planned travel and diving web series.

Sexual assault In March 2010, Monahan claimed in an interview with Woman's Day magazine,Hey Dad! star claims 'I was abused on set' and later on current affairs television program A Current Affair, that she was sexually abused on the set of Hey Dad...! by Robert Hughes, the actor who played her on-screen father. Hughes strongly denied the allegations and claimed to have engaged defamation lawyers. During an interview aired on A Current Affair in March 2011, Monahan expressed her concerns that charges may not be laid against Hughes. She stated that she intended to initiate legal actions against Hughes and television executives who, she claimed, were aware of Hughes' alleged actions and failed to take action. After her allegations in the media, Braveheart, a sexual assault advocacy group, asked Monahan to become an ambassador. Hughes was arrested in London on 9 August 2012. His extradition to Australia was approved on 28 September 2012. In early April 2014, Hughes was found guilty of sexually abusing young girls. Personal life Monahan lives in the US with her American husband, Matt Morris, whom she met in Brisbane, Australia.

Bellisario. Main characters=Dr. Samuel Beckett * Dr. Samuel Beckett (Scott Bakula) - The mastermind behind Project Quantum Leap who leaps back and forth within his own lifetime, putting things right that once went wrong. See main article for more. Admiral Albert Calavicci * Rear Admiral Albert Calavicci (Dean Stockwell) - Sam's right- hand man who appears in the form of a hologram that only Sam can see and hear. See main article for more. Ziggy * Ziggy (voiced by Deborah Pratt) - The supercomputer Sam designed to run Project Quantum Leap. The computer has a feminine personality and a massive ego; the latter feature is an accomplishment Sam is particularly proud of, as it makes Ziggy much more than a simple number-crunching machine. In early episodes, it is suggested that Ziggy is the computer's operator. But when Sam speaks to Ziggy directly, it shows that Ziggy is a self-operating computer who is capable of recognizing and expressing human emotions. Ziggy is programmed with historical information through Sam's life and has access to outside databases, and is able to project the likely effect of Sam's actions on history. While Al is with Sam, he gets information from Ziggy through a faulty handheld device. Al can get information from Ziggy through this device, or by simply asking out loud (Al sees whatever location Sam is in as a holographic projection and is always physically in close proximity to Ziggy). Recurring characters=Project Quantum Leap * Dr. Donna Alizzi (Teri Hatcher, age 19 / Mimi Kuzyk, age 45) - Born Donna Wojohowitz, she is Sam's wife and director of Project Quantum Leap in her husband's absence. Originally, Donna was not involved with the project, until Sam altered history, thus ensuring her involvement and getting rid of the Committee (see below). * Dr. Irving \\"Gooshie\\" Gushman (Dennis Wolfberg) - Project Quantum Leap's head computer programmer and senior operations coordinator. A quirky man, Gooshie is often described as \\"a little guy with bad breath\\". He is the butt of jokes between Sam and (especially) Al. When he is seen, he tends to be in a state of worry due to Sam's present situation. Gooshie once filled in for Al as Sam's holographic contact when Al was busy attempting to track down a murderer who escaped the waiting room. * Dr. Verbena Beeks (Candy Ann Brown) - The project's head psychiatrist. It is her job to work directly with the person Sam displaces when he leaps as they are often in a state of shock and panic when they arrive. * Tina Martinez (Gigi Rice) - Tina is a medical technician that works on the Project. No one can enter the Imaging Chamber or the Accelerator Chamber without first being inspected by her. She is Al's girlfriend and is also having a secret affair with Gooshie. In the episode where Sam accidentally erased Al from existence, she was married to Gooshie. *Edward St. John V (Roddy McDowall) - When Sam changed history and accidentally erased Al from existence, Edward St. John V appeared as his holographic contact. After correcting the error, Al reappeared. Whether or not St. John works on the Project outside of that alternate timeline is unknown. * Samantha Josephine \\"Sammy Jo\\" Fuller (Kimberly Cullum, age 11) - Project technician who works on the project. She is the biological daughter of Sam and Abigail Fuller, conceived during a leap into Abigail's fianc√© in 1966. Only the child-version of Sammy Jo is ever seen. Sammy Jo spends her life believing that Abigail's former fianc√©e is her biological father, and she is never told anything different. Sam figures out that Sammy Jo is his daughter, and Al confirms this through Ziggy. Child Sammy Jo resembles Abigail at the same age, but with Sam's hair colour. She has a fascination with time travel and has a photographic memory, and bonds easily with Sam. Sam has no memory of meeting adult Sammy Jo, even though she works on the project with him. Ziggy's prediction that Sam will forget this secret when he has his next leap comes true. This means that only Al knows the truth about Sammy Jo's parentage. * Senator (Warren Frost) - The head of a government oversight committee that tried to shut down Project Quantum Leap when Sam failed to stop the downing of a U-2 spy plane. * Senator Diane McBride (Alice Adair) - Although he failed to stop the U-2, Sam did change history and Senator Diane McBride became the head of the oversight committee and ruled to continue the Project's funding. Al witnesses the former Senator morph into Diane. He immediately realizes that his was the result of Sam changing the timeline, but is the only person who is aware of it. He never mentions what he witnessed to anyone. * The Committee - Led by men named Weitzman and Bartlett, the committee oversaw Project Quantum Leap until Sam altered history, bringing Donna onto the Project,reference required assuring government funding and eliminating the need for the Committee. Friends and Family * John Samuel Beckett (Scott Bakula) - Sam's father, a gruff but kind dairy farmer in Elk Ridge, Indiana. He was named after his grandfather, a Civil War officer. When Sam leaps into his teenage self, he recalls that his father had died a few years later due to poor health. Sam fails in getting him to quit smoking. However, Sam would encounter his much slimmer father in another leap many years after his father's death. This confirms that Sam managed to convince his father to make better dietary choices, thus improving his health and greatly extending his life. * Thelma Louise Beckett (Caroline Kava) - Sam's mother. After her husband's death, she moved to Hawaii to live with her daughter and her second husband. * Lieutenant Thomas \\"Tom\\" Beckett (David Newsom) - Sam's older brother who was killed in Vietnam on April 8, 1970, until Sam changed history and kept his brother alive. However, this resulted in Al not being rescued and being held as a prisoner of war. His first wife then believed Al to have been killed in action and moved on with another husband, not knowing that Al was trying to get back to her. * Katherine \\"Katie\\" Beckett (Olivia Burnette) - Sam's younger sister. To get away from trouble at home, she married an abusive alcoholic at a young age. Years later she divorced him and eventually married an Air Force officer, Lieutenant Jim Bonick. After John Beckett's death, Thelma lived with Katie and Jim. * Beth Calavicci (Susan Diol) - Al's first wife and the only woman he ever truly loved. When Sam meets Beth during a Season 2 leap, she believes that she is widowed as her husband, who was serving in military action in the Vietnam war, had been reported missing-in-action and presumed dead. Al pressures Sam into stopping her forming a relationship with another man, insisting that \\"her husband\\" was still alive. Sam figures out Beth's identity and refuses to fulfill Al's request, deeming it to be selfish. In his next two leaps, Sam tries to save his own brother in the Vietnam war. This accidentally thwarted a rescue attempt that would've rescued Al, causing him to become a war prisoner. When Al is freed and returns home, he learned that Beth thought he was dead and had remarried, so he chose to leave her alone. Sam is given a chance to put this right, and then assures Beth that her husband Al was alive and is trying to get back to her. * Sammy Jo Fuller - Sam's daughter due to his leaping. See 'Project Quantum Leap' above. * Captain John Beckett (Scott Bakula) - Captain John Beckett is a civil war officer and direct ancestor of Sam. Sam leaps into him, making him the only leapee to have existed outside of Sam's own time. While he represents the North, he is taken hostage by supporter of the Southern Army. Al confirms through Ziggy that his abductor is also his ancestor, and must ensure that she falls in love with the Captain. Otherwise Sam would prevent his own birth and potentially stop Project Quantum Leap from ever beginning and undoing every change Sam ever made. Antagonists In Season 5, Sam discovered a leaper from another project. This leaper project seemed to follow the same structure and scientific principles as Quantum Leap, but was dedicated to the opposite goal of putting wrong what once went right. The participants sometimes make reference to unspecified authority figures who torture them greatly if they fail. * Alia (Ren√©e Coleman) - Sam's counterpart, a beautiful and deadly woman who is leaping around in time, committing terrible acts in an attempt to get home. Alia and Sam see each other as their respective leapees until they make physical contact. The first time Sam touches Alia, their genuine identities are revealed simultaneously. On the second occasion when they shake hands, Alia is able to see Sam but Sam still sees her as her leapee until he makes contact again. After meeting and failing to kill Sam twice, Alia abandons her old ways and tries to escape the ones controlling her leaping with Sam's help. At the end of \\"Revenge of the Evil Leaper\\" her leap is accompanied by a blue flash rather than her usual red flash, implying she has escaped the Evil Leaper project. It is implied that Alia was an unwilling participant in the project. * Zoey (Carolyn Seymour) - Alia's holographic partner. She is a cruel and sadistic woman who, after Alia breaks free of their project's control on her, leaps back in an attempt to kill Alia herself. Unlike Sam and Al, Zoey is clearly in charge of her respective pairings. She manipulates Alia and cares little about her feelings. While Zoey is a hologram, she can see Sam if Alia can (due to her being tuned in to Alia's brainwaves), but Sam remains unable to see or hear her. * Thames (Hinton Battle) - When Zoey leaped, a darkly comical man named Thames became her hologram. * Lothos - The other project's computer system, analogous to Ziggy.

He is sometimes called \\"Constantine XI\\", a numeral now usually reserved for Constantine Palaiologos. Early years Constantine Laskaris was born of a noble but not particularly renowned Byzantine family. Virtually nothing is known of him prior to the events of the Fourth Crusade. He found favour after his brother Theodore married into the imperial family, becoming the son-in-law of Emperor Alexios III Angelos. During the first siege of Constantinople by the Crusaders in 1203 he was given command of the best body of troops available and led the Greek defenders on sorties against the entrenched Crusaders. None were successful in their goal of lifting the siege, and finally Constantine was ordered to attack the Burgundians who were on guard at the time.Geoffrey De Villehardouin, 'Memoirs Or Chronicle of the Fourth Crusade and the Conquest of Constantinople', Echo Library, 2007, pg 31 The Greeks issued forth from the city, but were soon driven back to the gates, notwithstanding the stones that the defenders on the walls threw down onto the advancing Crusaders. Constantine himself was captured whilst mounted on his horse by William of Neuilly and probably kept for ransom, which was the usual practice of the times. At some point he was released, as he was soon swept up in the events of the second siege of Constantinople in 1204. Elevation as Emperor After the Crusaders entered Constantinople on 12 April 1204 and began to sack the city, a large body of citizens as well as what remained of the Varangian Guard gathered together in the church of Hagia Sophia to elect a new emperor, as Alexios V had fled the city.Harry J. Magoulias, 'O city of Byzantium: annals of Niketas Choniatƒìs', Wayne State University Press, 1984, pg 314 Two nominees presented themselves ‚Äì Constantine Laskaris and Constantine Doukas (probably the son of John Angelos Doukas, and thus a first cousin to Isaac II Angelos and Alexios III).Donald E. Queller, Thomas F. Madden, Alfred J. Andrea, 'Fourth Crusade: The Conquest of Constantinople', University of Pennsylvania Press, 1999, pg 189 Both presented their case to be nominated emperor, but the people could not decide between them, as both were young and had proven military skills. Eventually lots were cast and Laskaris was selected by what remained of the army as the next emperor. Laskaris refused to accept the imperial purple; escorted by the Patriarch of Constantinople, John X, to the Milion, he urged the assembled populace to resist the Latin invaders with all their strength. However, the crowd was unwilling to risk their lives in such a one-sided conflict, and so he turned to the Varangians and asked for their support. Though his pleas to honour fell on deaf ears, they agreed to fight for increased wages, and he marched out to make a final stand against the Latin Crusaders. However, the Varangians betrayed Constantine and fled at the sight of the mail-clad Latin troops. Seeing all was lost, he quickly fled the capital in the early hours of 13 April 1204. Career at Nicaea Greek resistance to the Latin conquerors began almost immediately under the leadership of Theodore Laskaris, and he was soon joined by Constantine. They were hard pressed at first, and by early 1205 they had lost the important city of Adramyttion to the new Latin Emperor, Henry of Flanders. Theodore was keen to reverse this setback, and so he sent Constantine at the head of a large body of troops towards the city.Geoffrey De Villehardouin, 'Memoirs Or Chronicle of the Fourth Crusade and the Conquest of Constantinople', Echo Library, 2007, pg 63 Henry of Flanders had advance warning of the attack via an Armenian source, and prepared his forces to meet the Greeks. The two armies fought the Battle of Adramyttion on Saturday, 19 March 1205 outside the city walls, and the result was a massive defeat for Constantine Laskaris and the Greeks, with most of the army either perishing or being captured.Harry J. Magoulias, pg 331 Nothing more is heard of Constantine Laskaris after this battle, so it is presumed that he either perished in the defeat, or was captured.  Family  Constantine had six brothers: Manuel Laskaris (died after 1256), Michael Laskaris (died 1261/1271), Georgios Laskaris, Theodore, Alexios Laskaris, and Isaac Laskaris. The last two fought with the Latin Empire against Theodore Laskaris' successor, John III Doukas Vatatzes, and were imprisoned and blinded. According to \\"The Latins in the Levant. A History of Frankish Greece (1204‚Äì1566)\\" by William Miller, the seven brothers may also have had a sister, the wife of Marco I Sanudo and mother of Angelo Sanudo. He based this theory on his own interpretation of Italian chronicles. However, the Dictionnaire historique et G√©n√©alogique des grandes familles de Gr√®ce, d'Albanie et de Constantinople (1983) by Mihail-Dimitri Sturdza rejected the theory based on the silence of Byzantine primary sources. Historical uncertainty of coronation The primary source for the elevation of Constantine Laskaris is Niketas Choniates, an eyewitness who recounted the fall of Constantinople to the Crusaders. However, given Constantine's apparent subordinate role under his brother Theodore in 1205, historians such as Sir Steven RuncimanSteven Runciman, 'A History of the Crusades, Vol. 3: The Kingdom of Acre and the Later Crusades', Cambridge, 1954, pg 122 and Donald QuellerDonald E Queller, 'The Fourth Crusade: The Conquest of Constantinople 1201‚Äì1204', University Park, 1977, pg 147; 216‚Äì217 have argued that it was in fact Theodore and not Constantine who was in Hagia Sophia that fateful day, and it was Theodore who was nominated and thus succeeded Alexios V.Donald Nicol, 'The Last Centuries of Byzantium: 1261‚Äì1453', Cambridge University Press, 1993, pg 369 This uncertainty, plus the fact that Constantine remained uncrowned, means that he is not always counted among the Byzantine emperors. Therefore, the convention when it comes to Constantine Laskaris is that he is not usually assigned a numeral. If he is counted as Constantine XI, then Constantine XI Palaiologos, the last Emperor, is counted as Constantine XII.Britannica ReferencesSources Constantine Year of birth missing 13th-century Byzantine emperors Eastern Orthodox monarchs 1205 deaths People of the Empire of Nicaea ","title":"Constantine Laskaris"},{"id":"6307038","text":"Mini Lindy was a line of small plastic model kits, about the size of Matchbox or Hot Wheels cars.

It was based largely on the FN GP35 Hi-Power self-loading pistol of 1935, but scaled up significantly. Whereas the Hi-Power used the 9 mm Para cartridge, the NAACO Brigadier used a new long-case .45\\" round of much greater power than the then-standard .45 ACP. With a standard bullet, the .45 NAACO cartridge could produce muzzle velocities of up to , or almost twice as fast as the .45 ACP. In order to keep weight down, the pistol used an aluminium slide, but still weighed more than four pounds, unloaded. Its box magazine could carry eight rounds of ammunition. A removable trigger module allowed for a fully automatic configuration, complete with an attachable butt-stock. This would produce a sub-machine gun configuration called the Borealis (never constructed). Gunsmith Robert Herman and Designer Russell Sutherland spent a year developing the prototype. Collapse and aftermath In the end, the Brigadier project fell victim to NATO standardization, and the company folded in 1962. Only one prototype was built, and the weapon never entered service; the Brigadier's rarity makes it pricey on the gun market. The .45 NAACO cartridge sank into obscurity, but was revived in the 1970s by Winchester as a long-range target round. Ballistic performance was nearly identical to the original, and the cartridge was christened .45 Winchester Magnum. It has since been used in a number of handguns.

It was the first art school in the region and became the main centre of art and cultural practice. Since 1956 it has been situated in Shahbag, Dhaka, close to the Bangladesh National Museum. Architect Muzharul Islam designed the building. In 2008, the institute took its current name when it became one of the faculties of the University of Dhaka. History With the leadership of Zainul Abedin, the eminent artists Anwarul Huq, Quamrul Hasan, Khawaja Shafique Ahmed, Safiuddin Ahmed and Habibur Rahman started the Government Institute of Arts and Crafts in DNMI Hospital building at Johnson Road in Dhaka. At the moment of its beginning there were six teachers along with Zainul Abedin as the principal and eighteen students. The activities of this institute started with three departments: Fine arts (at present Drawing and Painting), Commercial art (at present Graphic Design) and Graphic art (at present Printmaking). In 1952 the institute moved to a building at Segun Bagicha and then in 1956 it moved to its own building at Shahbag. In 1963 the institute turned into Government Degree College and was named East Pakistan College of Arts and Crafts. After independence of Bangladesh this college was named Bangladesh College of Arts and Crafts. M.F.A. course has been started here since 1978. Art History department started MFA course in 1991 and honors course in 2001. In 1983 this college merged as institute in Dhaka University. Honors course has been started since 1992-93 session. The institute was turned into a Faculty of Fine Arts of the University of Dhaka in 2008. Influence on art After the institute was established, within a few years, however, it became quite apparent that what was started only as a training centre had assumed a far greater role, for it quickly became a meeting place for all aspiring artists and a forum from which a new art movement could be launched. The faculty and students of the institute were in touch with what was happening in the West. Many teachers went to Europe and Japan for training and came back with new ideas; but they were also steeped in the traditions of indigenous and folk art and art forms. The West played a formative influence in sharpening their sensibilities, but their firm root protected them from losing their sense of direction and becoming mere imitators of western art. This ability to balance and blend the very best elements of local and foreign art has been a strong point for Bangladeshi artists. Over the fifty years since the inception of the Art Institute, Bangladeshi art has made remarkable progress. The training provided to its students gave them the freedom to develop their own talents in keeping with their dominant inclinations. The heritage of the Bengal school was closely followed by the students of oriental art, while folk forms found their way in the work of many artists (including the founding teachers Zainul Abedin and Qamrul Hassan). Architecture This masterpiece was Muzharul Islam's first architectural endeavor. The site is located in the Roman area apart of Dhaka University Campus. The Roman area is well known for its gardens and parks. Most of the buildings in this area have been designed in the scheme of a ‚Äúbagan bari‚Äù (house in a garden). The site that was given for the purpose of the institute was dotted with beautiful trees with a large circular depression at the end of the site. Muzharul Islam decided to come up with a design scheme that will retain all the trees on the site (as some of them were large beautiful trees that would have require many years to grow). His scheme was also climate responsive and had large continuous verandahs shading the inner walls and windows of the classrooms and studios. The design echoes the out house and inner house scheme of rural Bangladesh. It also transforms ‚ÄòJalees‚Äô (lattices) and ‚Äòberas‚Äô (perforated screens) into wonderful screens that separates and creates thresholds. One enters into the front pavilion, a wonderful structure that houses galleries on the ground floor and teachers and common rooms etc. on the first. A wonderful sculptural stairs connects the two levels around a wonderful internal courtyard. Past the pavilion are the classrooms and studios and in the far end encircling the round depression are the print studios. A lotus pond and sitting area becomes the open heart of the whole institute. The ground on the south both is a relief and a place to gather. This ground and the whole structure itself transforms to host many activities namely the Bengali New Year ‚ÄòPohela Boishakh‚Äô and numerous art classes and competitions for children. Bricks of the project were also custom designed by Muzharul Islam as so are the terracotta screens. Marvelous shading devices and pergola type details brick our driving rain. Present condition At present the institute has eight departments‚ÄîGraphic Design, Oriental Art, Ceramics, Drawing and Painting, Sculpture, Crafts, History of Arts and Printmaking. Programmes include four-year Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA Honours) and two-year Master of Fine Arts (MFA) for all departments. The number of students enrolled annually has gone up‚Äîfrom 80 to around 120. The Graphic Design department has a new computer lab. Students of FFA now have options to work part-time (at media houses and ad firms) and the commercial aspect of BFA and MFA degrees from the institute now seems favourable, opportunities the previous generations did not enjoy. There are 43 permanent teachers and most of the teachers are eminent artists of the country. FFA is an important centre of Modern art practice in Bangladesh. Many eminent and internationally renowned artists of Bangladesh were the students of this Faculty. The importance of this Art Institute in the cultural life of Bangladesh cannot be overemphasized. For the last 50 years, it has worked not simply as an institution imparting art education but also as a cultural centre for Bengalis, functioning as a force for cultural revival and regeneration.

For his performance during the war, Leane was described by the Australian Official War Historian Charles Bean as \\"the foremost fighting leader\\" in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF), and \\"the head of the most famous family of soldiers in Australian history\\", among other accolades. After the war, he served as Commissioner of the South Australia Police from 1920 to 1944, for which he was knighted. A businessman and part- time Citizen Forces officer before the war, Leane was commissioned into the AIF and led a company of the 11th Infantry Battalion at the landing at Anzac Cove, Gallipoli, on 25 April 1915. He rose to temporarily command his battalion, and was made a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order (DSO), awarded the Military Cross, twice mentioned in despatches and wounded three times during the Gallipoli campaign. After returning to Egypt, the AIF was re- organised, and Leane was appointed as the commanding officer of the newly formed 48th Battalion, which soon after was transported to the Western Front in France and Belgium. Important battles that the 48th were involved in under his command included the Battle of Pozi√®res in 1916, and the First Battle of Bullecourt and First Battle of Passchendaele in 1917. During the latter battle, he was severely wounded. During 1916‚Äì1917, he was mentioned in despatches three more times, was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George and awarded a bar to his DSO. After recuperating, in early 1918 he returned to his battalion and led it during the German Spring Offensive of March and April 1918, which included heavy fighting near Dernancourt, for which he was again mentioned in despatches. As a battalion commander, he proved a difficult subordinate, disobeying the orders of his brigade commanders at both Pozi√®res and Dernancourt. In June 1918 he was promoted to colonel and temporary brigadier general to command the 12th Brigade, which he led during the Battle of Amiens in August, and the fighting to capture the Hindenburg Outpost Line in September. He was mentioned in despatches a further two times after the conclusion of the war, and in early 1919 was also awarded the French Croix de guerre, and made a Companion of the Order of the Bath for his \\"gallant and able\\" leadership while commanding the 12th Brigade. During the war, four of his brothers and six of his nephews served; two brothers and two nephews were killed. After helping oversee the repatriation of soldiers back to Australia, Leane returned home to South Australia in late 1919. In May the following year he was selected as the next Commissioner of the South Australia Police, taking up the appointment in July. His appointment was initially controversial within the force, as there had been an established practice of selecting the commissioner from within its ranks. Leane also returned to part-time soldiering, commanding at the brigade level until 1926, not without controversy. His administration of the police force was generally praised, although he did have to weather several storms, one of which involved a Royal Commission into bribery of some of his officers by bookmakers. He was a foundation member and inaugural president of the Legacy Club of Adelaide, established to assist the dependents of deceased ex-servicemen. In 1928, during a major dispute over the industrial award applying to waterfront labourers, Leane provided police protection to non-union workers, and on one occasion personally led a force of 150 police that successfully confronted a crowd of 2,000 waterside labourers who wanted to remove non-union workers from Adelaide ports. As commissioner, he introduced a number of innovations, including cadets and probationary training for young recruits, police dogs, and traffic accident analysis. After the outbreak of World War II, despite being on the retired list, Leane became the state commander of the Returned and Services League-organised Volunteer Defence Corps, a form of home guard, in addition to his duties as commissioner. After retiring in 1944, he was knighted for his services during 24 years at the head of the police force. In retirement he became involved in conservative politics, and remained active with returned servicemen's associations until his death in 1962. Early life and career Raymond Lionel Leane was born on 12 July 1878 in Prospect, South Australia, the son of a shoemaker, Thomas John Leane, and his wife Alice Short, who were of Cornish descent. One of eight children, he was educated at North Adelaide Public School until age 12, when he went to work for a retail and wholesale business, which sent him to Albany, Western Australia. He later moved to Claremont. In June 1902, Leane married Edith Louise Laybourne, a sister of the architect Louis Laybourne Smith. He and Edith lived at Claremont for six years, during which he served on the local council from 1903 to 1906. His interest in the military led to Leane being commissioned as a lieutenant in the 11th (Perth Rifles) Infantry Regiment, a unit of the part-time Citizen Forces in 1905. In 1908, he bought a retail business in Kalgoorlie and transferred to the Goldfields Infantry Regiment. He was promoted to captain on 21 November 1910. World War I On 25 August 1914, Leane joined the newly formed Australian Imperial Force (AIF) as a company commander in the Western Australia-raised 11th Infantry Battalion of the 3rd Brigade, with the rank of captain. The AIF was established as Australia's expeditionary force to fight in the war, as the Citizen Forces were restricted to home defence per the Defence Act 1903. When the battalion was formed, he was appointed to command F Company. The battalion embarked for overseas in October and sailed to Egypt, arriving in early December. On 1 January 1915, the unit was re-organised into four companies to mirror the British Army battalion structure, and a new C Company was created by combining E and F Companies. Leane was chosen to command the new C Company. Gallipoli campaign After several months training in Egypt, the 3rd Brigade first saw action as the covering force for the landing at Anzac Cove, Gallipoli, on 25 April 1915 and so was the first brigade ashore about 04:30. Leane's C Company was in the first wave, and landed just to the north of the Ari Burnu headland then climbed it to Plugge's Plateau. By noon on 30 April, the 1,000-strong 11th Battalion had suffered casualties amounting to nine officers and 369 men. Four days later, Leane was chosen to lead an amphibious assault on Gaba Tepe, a prominent headland south of the Anzac perimeter on which an Ottoman-held fort was situated. The troops occupying the fort were directing artillery fire onto the positions around Anzac Cove. Landing from boats on the beach at the foot of Gaba Tepe, the force consisted of over 110 men from the 11th Battalion and 3rd Field Company. The force was promptly pinned down on the beach by heavy fire. Leane signalled the Royal Navy to remove his wounded from the beach, which they did with a steamboat towing a rowboat. Having determined that the withdrawal along the beach was impossible owing to belts of barbed wire, Leane then signalled the Royal Navy to remove the rest of his party. The Navy sent two picket boats towing two ships' boats. Destroyers laid down covering fire, but while the Ottomans had held their fire for the evacuation of the wounded, they laid down tremendous fire on the withdrawing raiders. Many men were hit, including Leane, who was wounded in the hand. The raid was a failure, but Leane's leadership, courage and coolness under fire had impressed, and he was awarded the Military Cross (MC) for his actions. The recommendation from his commanding officer read: alt=A black and white photograph of a line of bodies on the ground Following the raid on Gaba Tepe, Leane rejoined his battalion in the main defensive line around the beachhead. Before dawn on 19 May, elements of the Ottoman 16th Division attacked the 3rd Brigade positions on Bolton's Ridge as part of a wider counterattack against the Anzac sector. During the fighting, Leane was located in a forward sap of the battalion trenches overlooking a gully where the Ottoman troops were congregating. From this position, Leane and two other 11th Battalion men killed a large number of Ottoman troops with their rifles, firing from dawn until noon. On 28 June, Leane's company went forward of Bolton's Ridge towards Turkey Knoll to provide covering fire for an abortive attack by the 9th Battalion on Ottoman trenches on Sniper's Ridge. This attack was a feint, intended to distract the Ottoman commanders from reinforcing their troops opposite an Allied attack at Cape Helles far to the south. The forward company position was completely untenable, the lead elements of Leane's company were raked by shrapnel and machine gun fire, and Leane was wounded in the face. Despite this, he remained with his unit. The two companies of the 11th Battalion that were committed to support the attack lost 21 killed and 42 wounded. During the night of 31 July, Leane led an assault on an Ottoman trench opposite Tasmania Post, which was held by the 11th Battalion. The attack was prompted by a desire to give the Ottomans the impression that an attempt was going to be made to break out of the Anzac perimeter to the south, while a landing was planned at Suvla Bay far to the north. Leane's force consisted of four parties of 50 men, who were to assault the Ottoman trench after the firing of four mines that had been dug up to the enemy trench. Initially only the northernmost and southernmost of the mines exploded, but Leane led out the attack regardless. While the parties were covering the distance between Tasmania Post and the Ottoman trench, a third mine exploded, possibly burying some members of one of the assaulting groups. The fourth mine failed to explode. Stiff fighting occurred at some points of the objective trench, but the Ottomans were routed and the trench was consolidated and communication trenches leading towards the Ottoman rear were barricaded. Several desperate bomb fights occurred at the barricades. Work immediately began to convert the mine tunnels into communication trenches leading to the newly captured trench. There were some feeble counterattacks. At dawn, Ottoman artillery began an intense bombardment of the newly won position. During the shelling, Leane was speaking to an observer as an enemy shell landed. The observer was decapitated and Leane was wounded in the head, but remained at his post. The position captured during this operation became known as \\"Leane's Trench\\". While capturing the trench, the 11th Battalion had lost 36 killed and 73 wounded. thumbFive of the six Leane brothers served in World War I Left to rightstanding: Major Benjamin Leane; Lieutenant Colonel Raymond Leane; Warrant Officer Class One Ernest Leane seated: Major Edwin Leane; and Major Allan Leane Leane was promoted to temporary major on 5 August while recuperating in hospital on the island of Lemnos. He rejoined his unit four days later and was recommended to be made a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order (DSO), the second highest award for acts of gallantry by officers, for his \\"great gallantry, coolness and dash\\". He temporarily commanded the 11th Infantry Battalion from 30 September, and was promoted to substantive major and temporary lieutenant colonel on 8 October. Leane remained at Gallipoli until the battalion was evacuated to Lemnos on 16 November. He was admitted to hospital with pneumonia in late November, and was evacuated to Egypt, finally being discharged in early February 1916. For his service during the campaign, in addition to his MC and DSO, he was twice mentioned in despatches. He also became known by the nickname \\"The Bull\\". As the Official Australian War Historian Charles Bean observed, his \\"tall square-shouldered frame, immense jaw, tightly compressed lips, and keen, steady, humorous eyes made him the very figure of a soldier\\". Western Front On discharge from hospital, Leane initially returned to the 11th Battalion, but on 21 February 1916 was transferred to be the commanding officer of the planned 48th Infantry Battalion. The 48th Battalion was assigned to the 12th Brigade, part of the 4th Division. Leane was substantively promoted to lieutenant colonel on 12 March, and the battalion itself was raised four days later. Like Leane himself, the 48th was both South Australian and Western Australian, having been raised from a cadre drawn from the 16th Battalion reinforced by fresh recruits from Australia. Serving in the battalion were a number of Leane's relatives, including his younger brother, Benjamin Bennett Leane, who was initially his adjutant and later his second- in-command. There were also three of his nephews in the battalion (Allan Edwin, Reuben Ernest and Geoffrey Paul Leane), and several other relatives. The 48th became known throughout the AIF as the \\"Joan of Arc Battalion\\" because it was \\"made of All-Leanes\\" (Maid of Orleans). Throughout March and April 1916, the battalion undertook training in the desert before being moved to Habieta in early May where they briefly manned defensive positions as a precaution against a possible Ottoman attack on the Suez Canal. On 1 June, after a preliminary march to Serapeum, the battalion was moved by rail to Alexandria and boarded the troopship Caledonia, which sailed for France two days later. They docked at Marseille on 9 June, after which they were moved to northern France by rail. =Pozi√®res and Mouquet Farm= alt=A black and white photograph of a mound After the battalion moved to France, its first serious fighting was during the Battle of Pozi√®res on the night of 5/6 August, when it was committed to defend ground captured by the Australian 2nd Division. On receiving his orders, Leane immediately reconnoitred the position with his company commanders, during which they were pinned down by a German barrage and two of them were wounded. His brigade commander, Brigadier General Duncan Glasfurd and his superior commanders believed that a strong German counterattack would follow the tremendous barrage then falling on the Australian-held positions. Glasfurd therefore ordered Leane to place two companies north of Pozi√®res, but Leane was convinced that this would overcrowd the area and result in needless casualties. His plan was to garrison his two trenches with one company each and hold his two reserve companies well to the rear of the village and he confronted Glasfurd and demanded written orders. Glasfurd then gave Leane a written order that his two reserve companies were to be sent forward, but Leane remained defiant, stationing only one company north of Pozi√®res. According to Bean, while disobedience of orders is a dangerous practice in general, in this case later events proved that Leane was fully justified in this action. According to the historian Craig Deayton, Leane was already the dominant influence in the brigade, and was proving to be a \\"difficult subordinate\\" for Glasfurd. Leane was not alone in his approach, as the commanding officer of the flanking 14th Battalion, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Dare, adopted the same disposition and disobeyed his own brigade commander in doing so. Leane later described the relief of the previous garrison as the worst he experienced in the whole war, conducted as it was under a tremendous German bombardment. When he visited his front lines in the early morning, he found remnants of his two companies, scattered among shell holes rather than trenches, and surrounded by dead and wounded. By mid- afternoon on 6 August, it was apparent from the continuing heavy shelling that a German counterattack was to be expected. The two front line companies had suffered heavy losses, and, according to Bean, Leane's decision to retain a company in the rear of the village was shown to be a wise one. That evening he relieved his two forward companies with the reserve company, leaving the other company north of the village. About 04:00 on 7 August a full scale German counterattack developed, which threatened to overrun the 48th Battalion. Leane committed half of his remaining company, and this helped to resolve the situation. Leane's battalion was relieved in the afternoon. Leane's refusal to follow Glasfurd's orders has been described as flowing from \\"conspicuous common sense and great moral courage\\", but Deayton observes that the fact that no inquiry was undertaken after the battle was a failing by Leane's chain of command, which effectively gave Leane licence to disobey orders in future. The relationship between Glasfurd and Leane did not recover from this clash. Deayton further observes that if the German assault had been launched a day earlier, and the forward trenches lost, even temporarily, Leane would likely have been brought to account for his disobedience. In just one day and two nights of battle, the 48th Battalion lost 20 officers and 578 men, mainly from shell fire. The battalion returned to the line at Pozi√®res on 12‚Äì15 August, losing another 89 casualties. Following this, the battalion undertook a defensive role around Mouquet Farm, before being moved to Flanders where they rotated with the other three battalions of the 12th Brigade to man a sector of the line south of Ypres. No major attacks occurred in their sector during this time, and although there were a few casualties, the battalion was able to replace some of its losses, reaching a strength of around 700 men. Leane was again mentioned in despatches, this time for \\"consistent, thorough and good work in raising and training his battalion\\" and his command of his unit at Pozi√®res and Mouquet Farm. =Bullecourt= alt=A black and white photograph of a white cross alongside a railway line During the worst European winter in 40 years, the 48th Battalion continued to take its turn at the front line, and Leane was mentioned in despatches for the fourth time. In March 1917 his battalion followed up the Germans as they withdrew towards the multi-layered Hindenburg Line of fortifications. In early April 1917, the 12th Brigade was committed to an attack aimed at capturing Bullecourt, with the 48th Battalion given the task of capturing the secondary objective, following behind the 46th Battalion. During the preparations, due to a misunderstanding, Leane was ordered by his brigade commander to send 200 troops into the village of Bullecourt, which Leane believed to be well defended. Characteristically, Leane insisted that if the order must be carried out, it would involve the destruction of one of his companies, and he would have to choose that commanded by his nephew Allan. The timely arrival of a divisional staff officer clarified the situation, and the order was cancelled. On the morning of 10 April, the battalion was formed up for the attack when the promised tank support failed to arrive on time, and the assault was postponed. During the withdrawal back to the front line, Leane's brother, Major Benjamin Leanenow the second-in-command of the unitwas killed by shell fire, and the battalion suffered another 20 casualties. Leane found Ben's body among the dead, and carried him to a spot where he dug a grave before erecting a cross above it. The postponed attack was rescheduled for the following day, and despite further problems with the tank support, the 48th Battalion was able to push through to the second line of German trenches in the Hindenburg Line east of Bullecourt. The position was considered to be secure if close artillery support was provided. But mistaken artillery and air observers insisted that they had seen Australian troops beyond the Hindenburg Line, messages from the forward battalions did not get back to their higher headquarters, and the artillery commanders would not bring down the protective barrage needed. Reinforcements were unable to get through in sufficient strength. When a large-scale German counterattack developed, the 48th Battalion was almost cut off in the captured German trenches, and had to fight their way out, taking heavy casualties in the process. Of the around 750 men of the battalion involved in the attack, the unit lost 15 officers and 421 men. Leane's nephew Allan, who had led the fight in the captured German trench, was captured after being wounded and later died in a German hospital. The Australian commanders were scathing of the tanks, blaming them almost entirely for the failure, with Leane even accusing the tank crews of \\"cowardice and incompetence\\". =Messines, Polygon Wood and Passchendaele= The battalion was next involved in serious fighting during the Battle of Messines. Although in a supporting role for the brigade's initial advance on 7 June, its companies were soon committed to reinforce the leading battalions. They continued to fight the Germans until 10 June when they were withdrawn so that the battalion could be re-organised as a whole. Later the same day the battalion was recommitted to the front line. The following morning, with characteristic aggression, Leane pushed a strong fighting patrol forward at dawn, working on his assumption that the trenches and strong points opposite the battalion were only being held at night, with the German garrison being withdrawn during the day. He proved to be right, and the German positions were captured without a fight, along with two field guns and a large quantity of ammunition. This action secured the brigade objective and linked up the 12th Brigade with the 13th Brigade on its left. Up until the battalion was withdrawn from the battle on 12 June, it had lost 4 officers and 62 men. Leane was recommended for a bar to his DSO after Messines for \\"clever handling\\" of his battalion, but he did not receive that award. The battalion rotated through rest, reserve positions and the front line until the Battle of Polygon Wood in September. During this battle it was in a support role, engaged mainly in salvage in rear areas, but nevertheless suffered 27 casualties from heavy shell fire. Soon after, Leane was recommended to be made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG). The recommendation read: alt=A black and white photograph of damaged masonry The battalion was next committed on the right flank of the main attack during the First Battle of Passchendaele on 12 October. Despite initial success and the capture of more than 200 Germans, the main attack failed, leaving the left flank of the battalion exposed. The first German counterattack was beaten off, but with its left flank unprotected, the second counterattack pushed the 48th Battalion back to its start line. During the fighting, the unit suffered 370 casualties from its original complement of 621. During the withdrawal, Leane was directing his unit from his headquarters near an old German pillbox when the area came under heavy German bombardment. A shell landed less than in front of him, Leane was severely wounded in the leg and hand, and was evacuated to England for treatment. He was again recommended for a bar to his DSO, this time successfully. The recommendation read: =German Spring Offensive= On 26 January 1918, Leane rejoined his battalion, having recuperated from his wounds. His CMG and bar to the DSO had been announced while he was away, as had his fifth mention in despatches. For almost the whole period of his absence, the 48th Battalion had been absorbing replacements, resting and training in rear areas, only returning to its rotation through to the front lines, reserve trenches and rest areas in mid- January. Even its brief periods in the front line had been quiet, mainly engaged in improving trenches and other defences. In mid-February the battalion moved to billets near Meteren where it remained until 25 March. On that day the 724-strong 48th Battalion was picked up by truck and sent south to help meet the German Spring Offensive, which had only been launched four days earlier, meeting with resounding success. After debussing north of Berles-au-Bois, the battalion marched into that village and took up positions. The following afternoon they were ordered to march through the night another further south to Senlis-le-Sec, arriving there on the morning of 27 March. After a brief stop they continued on through H√©nencourt and east to Millencourt, due west of Albert. First Dernancourt alt=A black and white portrait of a male in uniform The 12th Brigade was initially placed under the command of the 9th (Scottish) Division, responsible for holding the front line west of Albert, which had fallen into German hands. At this point, a breathless British staff officer appeared, stating that Dernancourt had fallen, and the Germans held the railway line in front of Albert. His orders were to guide the battalion into support positions on high ground behind the remnants of the 9th Division. Under Leane's stern gaze and questioning, he was unable to give the name of the commander of the 12th Brigade, Brigadier General John Gellibrand, who had apparently issued the orders, and due to rumours that alarms and false orders were being spread by Germans dressed as British staff officers, Leane detained him as a suspected spy. Leane went to find Gellibrand himself, found that the orders were correct, and the staff officer was released. After this delay in deployment, Leane directed his battalion east along the line of the Albert‚ÄìAmiens road to the heights behind the 9th Division, which it reached in the early afternoon of 27 March. Gellibrand then ordered the 48th Battalion, and the 47th Battalion on its right, to immediately take up positions on the forward slope of the high ground and push posts forward to the railway embankment below. The forward slope was in full view of the approaching Germans. The 47th moved forward immediately, came under heavy German shelling, and suffered casualties in moving as far as an old half-completed trench some short of the railway line by 17:00. Leane took the view that Gellibrand did not know the full situation on the ground, and that he had the discretion to follow a course of action that would achieve the objective without unnecessary casualties. He decided not to move his troops forward until dark. Bean remarks on Leane again disobeying orders, but notes that the dangers of such action are mitigated when such subordinates, like Leane, have \\"outstanding qualities of courage and judgement\\". He concludes, \\"[b]ut Leane was Leane, and Gellibrand had the sense to know it\\". Deayton criticises Leane's decision, describing his failure to advise the 47th Battalion of his intentions as \\"inexcusable\\", and stating that the serious risk created by Leane's decision could have resulted in a disaster had there been a German attack that afternoon. Deayton also reflects that this was only the latest in a series of clashes between Leane and Gellibrand since the latter had taken over the brigade in November of the previous year. After dark, the 48th Battalion took over the line from the remainder of the 9th Division. The 47th Battalion was still on its right, and on the left was the British V Corps. The 48th Battalion occupied a small salient between Albert and Dernancourt. During the night, desultory artillery and machine gun fire was directed at the battalion's positions. In the early morning light of 28 March, the forward two companies could make out German infantry advancing through the fog. They approached without the coverage of a barrage, and in quite close formation, some had their rifles slung. The men of the 48th Battalion quickly brought their weapons to bear and the Germans stopped advancing. A minor break through on the right-flanking 47th Battalion was quickly dealt with and thirty prisoners taken. During the day, the Germans advanced another eight times, each time more cautiously and with a little more fire support. But each time the Australians beat them back. By evening the Germans appeared to have withdrawn, and the 48th Battalion had suffered the loss of 62 men. That night and the next two days passed relatively quietly, with Leane rotating his companies through the front line posts, with characteristic care not to create congestion in the forward areas. The battalion was relieved on the night of 30 March. Second Dernancourt The 48th Battalion returned to its former positions on the railway embankment on the night of 3 April, in their absence the line had been subjected to two more German attacks which had been beaten off fairly easily. On this occasion, despite his usual reticence to congest his forward positions with troops, Leane asked for permission to use two companies forward on the railway embankment, and another forward in a series of posts on the extreme left of the battalion sector. These posts were on either side of a gully just south of the Albert‚ÄìAmiens road. He held his fourth company in a trench called Pioneer Trench, that had been dug on the high ground overlooking the embankment. He was also given a company of the 46th Battalion which he held in reserve near his headquarters. On 4 April, the commander of the 4th Division, Major General Ewen Sinclair-Maclagan decided the main line of defence would be the railway embankment, rather than the high ground behind it. While this did not change the dispositions of the 48th Battalion, it caused Gellibrand to issue an order that the embankment must be held at all costs, which had significant consequences for the coming battle. On the same day, word was received that a German attack was to be expected the next morning. Leane himself, observing German trench-mortar fire, and suspecting that they were registering targets for a bombardment, ensured his battalion was ready for the impending battle, and sent out night patrols that detected large concentrations of German troops on a road only beyond the embankment. Gellibrand ordered Lewis gun teams to be sent out to open fire on the assembling Germans, and called down artillery on the S.O.S. lines forward of the embankment. He also brought the 45th Battalion up to dig in on the high ground near Leane's headquarters. At 07:00, a heavy German bombardment came down, at first on rear areas of the 4th Division and its flanking formations, extending to the front line and supports about 08:00. Leane later observed that the barrage was \\"the heaviest since Pozi√®res\\". No attack immediately materialised on the 48th Battalion's front, although large parties of Germans began advancing after an hour of the barrage descending on the frontline. In stiff fighting, the Germans were repulsed on the 48th Battalion's front. Although Leane had twice been ordered to disband the battalion scout platoon under a new standard battalion structure brought into force in 1917, he had only recently done so, and only in a formal sense. Instead, whenever the battalion went into action, a similar number of designated scouts immediately reported to him, and he posted them at various locations to keep him informed of events. alt=A black and white photograph of a landscape with a railway embankment in the middle distance, behind which is a village About 10:30, some of Leane's scouts reported that the 13th Brigade, on the right of the 12th Brigade and opposite Dernancourt, was falling back. Around the same time, his right forward company on the embankment sent back a message indicating that the Germans had penetrated on the right of the brigade in the area of the 47th Battalion, and that it was taking over part of the left of the 47th Battalion line to assist. In response to a probe by the Germans against his northernmost company in the series of posts alongside the Albert‚ÄìAmiens road, Leane immediately sent part of his reserve company from Pioneer Trench to reinforce it. Sensing the danger in the 13th Brigade area, Leane ordered Major Arthur Samuel Allen, commanding the nearby 45th Battalion, to move his battalion forward to vacant trenches overlooking that sector. As Allen was implementing these orders, he received conflicting orders from Gellibrand to send two companies forward to Pioneer Trench. Allen saw the wisdom of Leane's orders, and tried to convince the brigade major that Leane's preferred course of action was best. Nevertheless, Allen was directed to carry out Gellibrand's orders. Later events proved that, being the most experienced commander on the ground, Leane actually had the most accurate conception of the real danger to the 12th Brigade's position. At 12:15, with the 47th Battalion having given way to the German onslaught and withdrawing past them up towards the high ground, the two forward companies of the 48th on the embankment began to withdraw, leaving the northernmost company in its posts around the gully near the Albert‚ÄìAmiens road. Soon after, the northern company was forced to withdraw its posts on the southern side of the gully. When he heard of the withdrawal, Leane sent forward his second-in-command to establish the line that the battalion would now attempt to hold. By 13:30, the 48th was still holding its left flanking posts near the Albert‚ÄìAmiens road, but the rest of the battalion had withdrawn to Pioneer Trench on the high ground. The left flank posts were not withdrawn until about 15:30. At this point, a counterattack was ordered, involving the 49th Battalion of the 13th Brigade, which had been in reserve, with all but the far left flank of the 12th Brigade conforming with its advance. Sinclair-Maclagan wanted to use four available tanks to support the attack, but this was refused by the brigade commanders. Deayton surmises that this rejection of the tanks was at the urging of Leane, who had taken such a negative view of them at Bullecourt. Sinclair-Maclagan then argued that the objective of both brigades must be to retake the railway line, but this was opposed by Gellibrand, supported by Leane, whose opinion he still valued highly. They argued that the 12th Brigade should only aim to retake the former support line partway down the hill. Sinclair-Maclagan's view prevailed, possibly as he was acting in accordance with direction from higher headquarters. Despite this, Leane, as the commander of the forward troops of the 12th Brigade, once again displayed his strong independent streak, disobeying those orders and directing the troops' main effort towards recapturing the support trenches. The resulting counterattack was described by Bean as \\"one of the finest ever carried out by Australian troops\\". The 49th Battalion, flanked on its left by a line consisting of two companies of the 45th, the remnants of the 47th, and finally the re-organised 48th, surged forward at 17:15 into very heavy small arms fire, but by nightfall had reached positions not far short of the old support line. The 49th had fought its way to a position almost identical to that which Leane had wanted the 45th to deploy earlier in the day, when his orders had conflicted with those of Gellibrand. The line established overnight was the only one that had really ever been defensible. The forward troops of the 12th Brigade were relieved overnight by the 46th Battalion, and on 7 April the whole brigade was relieved by the 6th Brigade of the 2nd Division. During the latter fighting for Dernancourt, the 48th Battalion had lost another 4 officers and 77 men. Monument Wood After Dernancourt, the 48th Battalion marched to the rear and began establishing a reserve line at Beaucourt. On 18 April, Gellibrand was evacuated sick and Leane was appointed to act as brigade commander in his place. The following day he was temporarily promoted to the rank of colonel. During Gellibrand's absence, on 27‚Äì28 April the 12th Brigade was deployed to the line at Villers-Bretonneux, which had just been recaptured from the Germans. In order to push the frontline further east of the town, it was necessary to capture strongly-held German positions in Monument Wood, so- named as it was adjacent to a memorial to the Franco-Prussian War. This task was given to the 12th Brigade, and Leane, knowing that the fighting would be difficult, applied his usual practice of giving the most challenging missions to his own, the 48th Battalion. After the intense fighting at Dernancourt, the 48th had been reinforced with a significant number of unseasoned new recruits. The attack was planned for 02:00 on 3 May, and in order to achieve surprise, there was to be only intermittent shelling of the wood during the day, and just a two-minute barrage with all available guns at the time of the attack. In the event, Leane's first battle as brigade commander went badly, with the artillery barrage being very weak and failing to cut the wire in front of the wood, and the supporting tanks failing to have any impact. One party managed to get through the wire and capture 21 Germans in the farm buildings in the centre of the wood, but a German counterattack forced the Australians back to their start line, with a loss of 12 officers and 143 other ranks, against German casualties of 10 officers and 136 men. =Brigade command= Leane returned to the 48th on 22 May and reverted in rank, but a little over a week later he was substantively promoted to colonel and temporarily promoted to brigadier general to command the 12th Brigade, as Gellibrand had been promoted to major general and appointed to command the 3rd Division. For his \\"considerable skill and ability\\" while acting brigade commander, Leane was recommended for the award of the French Croix de Guerre, and was mentioned in despatches for the sixth time. Immediately before his assumption of command, the limited number of reinforcements available, combined with losses suffered by the 12th Brigade at Dernancourt and Monument Wood necessitated the disbandment of one of the battalions of the brigade, and the 47th Battalion was chosen. Between 25 and 27 May its manpower was divided equally between the other battalions of the brigade. alt=a black and white group photograph of six men in uniform Leane then led his brigade during the highly successful Battle of Amiens on 8 August, during which it spearheaded the 4th Division as it leapfrogged through the 3rd Division to capture the second and third objectives, suffering casualties of nine officers and 212 other ranks. The second objective was captured by the 45th and 46th Battalions, with the 48th Battalion capturing the third objective, along with 200 prisoners and 12 machine guns. The Battle of Amiens was later described by the German General Erich Ludendorff as \\"the black day of the German Army\\". After a rest in reserve positions, the 12th Brigade was then in the forefront of the attack on the Hindenburg Outpost Line on 18 September, with the 48th Battalion leading the assault in the first phase, followed by the 45th which captured the second objective. Despite opinions to the contrary, Leane realised that the third \\"exploitation\\" phase of the attack would not be achieved by patrols, and would require the commitment of an entire battalion, and he allocated the 46th to the task. As the Australians were determined to push forward to the third objective despite a longer delay on the second objective by the British on the right flank of the 12th Brigade, Leane gave the commanding officer of the 46th Battalion very specific instructions regarding his assault, including to attack in great depth and protect his right flank. About 15:00, the attack of the 46th was held up by German resistance, so once he received this report, Leane went forward and urged its commanding officer to renew the attack as soon as artillery support could be arranged. The commanding officer argued against this approach, saying that his men were exhausted and needed rest and food. Leane accepted this, and it was decided that the attack would be renewed at 23:00. Leane, concerned about his exposed right flank caused by the failure of the British to go forward, ordered two companies of the 48th Battalion to prepare to attack across the divisional boundary and capture a hill in the forward area of the British 1st Division, but had to cancel the order when the British divisional commander objected. Instead, he had the two companies advance to a position protecting that flank but within his brigade boundary. That night, the 46th's attack was a great success, netting about 550 prisoners. Leane placed the two companies of the 48th under the command of the 46th to assist in consolidation of the position. The attack of the 46th, and on its left flank, the 14th Battalion, was an \\"extraordinarily daring attack\\", which, according to Bean, achieved results rarely achieved on the Western Front, and it was only on the Australian Corps front that the third objective of the attack was achieved. The British on the right flank repeatedly reported that they had also captured the third objective, but Leane, sending a patrol to make contact, quickly ascertained this report was incorrect. It was later found that what had been referred to as the Hindenburg Outpost Line was in fact being held as the main German position. The 12th Brigade had suffered casualties amounting to 19 officers and 282 men in achieving this success. The 4th Division was then relieved and went to the rear to rest. The brigade did not return to combat before the Armistice of 11 November 1918. After the war had ended, Leane acted as the commander of the 4th Division for a month, took some leave, was mentioned in despatches for the seventh time, and was also awarded the French Croix de Guerre. In April, he ceased to command the 12th Brigade, as it had been amalgamated with another brigade as men were repatriated to Australia. Leane then travelled to the United Kingdom, where he was appointed as General Officer Commanding No. 4 Group Hurdcott on the Salisbury Plain, which had an important role in repatriation. In June, he was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath. The recommendation for the award read: In July, he was mentioned in despatches for the eighth and final time. In September he relinquished his duties at Hurdcott and embarked to return to Australia. Leane was variously described by Bean in his Official History of Australia in the War of 1914‚Äì1918 as, \\"the head of the most famous family of soldiers in Australian history\\", \\"the fighting general par excellence\\", \\"the foremost fighting leader in the AIF\\", \\"a particularly cool and forcible ‚Äì and serious commander\\", and a \\"great leader\\". He had a reputation as \\"a considerate leader, with great strength of character and a high sense of duty. In action he was... unflappable and heedless of danger\\". Of Leane's four brothers who served in World War I, two were killed. Six of his nephews also served, two of whom were killed. The Leanes became one of the nation's most distinguished fighting families, and were known as the \\"Fighting Leanes of Prospect\\". Police commissioner alt=a black and white photograph of two men, one in uniform Leane disembarked in Adelaide on 18 October 1919, and his appointment in the AIF was terminated, in accordance with normal repatriation procedures, on 3 January 1920. In addition to the decorations he had received during the war, he was also issued with the 1914‚Äì15 Star, British War Medal and Victory Medal. While deployed overseas, he had been promoted to the brevet rank of lieutenant colonel in the peacetime Citizen Forces. On 20 January 1920, he was promoted to the substantive rank of colonel, \\"supernumerary to the establishment of Colonels,\\" with the honorary rank of brigadier-general. On 13 May 1920, it was announced that Leane would be the next Commissioner of the South Australia Police from 1 July, replacing Thomas Edwards. Leane's appointment was something of a surprise to senior police officers, who, based on long-standing arrangements, expected that the commissioner would be appointed from within the force. At the time, Leane was described as a \\"splendid fellow\\" by soldiers who had served under his command, and it was observed that \\"tact and firm decision\\" were outstanding features of his character. When the Police Association, which represented the rank-and-file of the force, met on 29 June, Leane's appointment was freely discussed, and it was resolved that, despite the fact that they, as a body, were opposed to the appointment of an outsider as Commissioner, they would be loyal to him. The meeting also decided to ask Leane to meet with representatives of each branch of the service as soon as possible, to discuss various grievances and suggest reforms. In July 1920, Leane was appointed to command the part-time 19th Infantry Brigade, which encompassed the metropolitan area of Adelaide and the south-east districts of South Australia, and was part of the peacetime military structure. In the same year, he was appointed as an aide-de-camp to the Governor-General. In May of the following year, as part of a re- organisation of the Citizen Forces, he was appointed to command the 3rd Infantry Brigade. In response to Leane's annual report on the police force in December 1922, The Register newspaper observed that Leane had \\"dispelled, for the most part, any feeling of regret at his appointment which existed among members of the force\\", and that he had won their respect by his strict impartiality, consideration and sense of justice. It also stated that the conditions of police service had markedly improved in the two years since his appointment. alt=a black and white portrait of a man in formal dress In June 1923, Leane brought a case of defamation against Harry Kneebone, the editor of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) newspaper, The Daily Herald. The case alleged that Kneebone had impugned Leane's reputation over the conduct of the 3rd Infantry Brigade annual camp at Wingfield in March that year, over which Leane had presided. The paper had described the camp as a \\"breeding ground for outlawry\\", had claimed that discipline was lacking, and that the food and accommodation was poor, among other things. Bill Denny, a lawyer and ALP Member of Parliament, represented Kneebone. It was determined that there was a prima facie case against the defendant, and the matter was scheduled for trial in the Supreme Court in October, but the jury was unable to come to a verdict and were dismissed. The case was abandoned in November. By July 1923, The Advertiser newspaper was reporting that Leane's approach over his three years at the helm had made a significant difference in the administration of the South Australia Police, explaining that Leane had dispensed with seniority as the basis for promotion, by substituting merit and efficiency, as well as selecting candidates who displayed qualities of sympathy and tact in dealing with the public. In February 1925, Leane hosted a conference of commissioners of police from around Australia held in Adelaide. Leane actively supported commemorative activities such as Anzac Day and Remembrance Day, and attended unveilings of memorials. In April 1926, Leane relinquished command of the 3rd Infantry Brigade, and was placed on the unattached list. For his military service since 1905, he had also been awarded the Volunteer Officers' Decoration. In 1926‚Äì1927, a Royal Commission into bribery of members of the police by bookmakers was conducted, finding that it was probable that two detectives and several plainclothes constables were guilty of taking bribes. After considering the report of the Royal Commission, Leane submitted his own report to the government, in which he criticised the vague nature of its findings, and while accepting that some police may have accepted bribes, he asserted that corruption was not widespread. One detective and three constables were offered the opportunity to resign and took it, and another plainclothes constable was returned to uniformed duty. During the course of the royal commission, several other plainclothes constables had resigned. Before the commission concluded, Leane recommended to the Chief Secretary, James Jelley, who was the minister responsible for the police, that the plainclothes branch of the police be abolished, with uniformed constables to be rotated through those duties as required. His recommendation was accepted. In January 1927, the design by Leane's brother-in-law, Louis Laybourne Smith, was selected for the National War Memorial in Adelaide. In early 1928, Leane became a foundation member and the inaugural president of the Legacy Club of Adelaide, established to assist the dependents of deceased ex-servicemen. alt=a black and white photograph of a wharf area with a crowd of men, with mounted police visible In September 1928, Leane provided police protection to non-union strikebreakers brought in to work on the Port Adelaide wharves to circumvent a dispute over the industrial award that covered the waterfront. Leane went to the extent of personally supervising police operations, despite a lack of unrest at the beginning of the dispute. There were suggestions that communists were interfering in internal union deliberations to resolve the matter. A week later, the continued employment of non-union labour resulted in significant violence on the waterfront. On the morning of 27 September, a crowd of between 4,000 and 5,000 unionists and others overran the Port Adelaide wharves, boarding ships and injuring and intimidating strikebreakers. That afternoon, a crowd of 2,000 marched the from Port Adelaide to Outer Harbor to confront the strikebreakers working there. Leane, accompanied by just one inspector, met the leaders and attempted to dissuade them from entering the wharf area. Instead, the crowd surged forward towards the docks. But Leane, his inspectors and about 150 mounted and foot police immediately set into motion plans to first break up the mass of the crowd among the buildings, then cordon off a significant portion of it in an open allotment. For some time they remained at a stalemate, but the crowd eventually dispersed having been unable to approach any of the strikebreakers or the vessels they were working on. The unionists had attacked a number of police and police horses, there had been a considerable amount of stone throwing by the crowd, and the police had used their batons freely at times. The events of the day were described in The Register as \\"probably without parallel in the history of the state\\". Over the following weekend, some 1,000 volunteers were sworn-in as part of the Citizens' Defence Brigade, a force of special constables raised at Leane's request to augment the police in dealing with the waterfront dispute. The brigade was based at Fort Largs and was equipped with service rifles and bayonets. The men were quickly posted at the wharves to maintain law and order. During the dispute, Leane slept in an office at the port so that he was on hand to deal with any emergencies. Leane's decision to arm the mostly inexperienced volunteers with bayonets was later criticised in Parliament. The dispute continued on, with major disturbances at Port Adelaide on 14 January 1929 which resulted in many injuries, and another on 17 January. A significant police presence was required at the wharves into 1930 to deal with disturbances and assaults on non-union workers, and Leane personally supervised police operations there on several occasions. In November 1928, two of Leane's sons, Lionel and Geoffrey, had joined the mounted police. In 1931, The Mail newspaper published a glowing article on Leane's eleven years as commissioner, praising the discipline and efficiency he had brought to the force, and describing him as a \\"true fighter\\" and \\"humane leader\\", who \\"never asks a man to do what he would not do himself\\". In the following year, Leane introduced 15‚Äì17 year old police cadets into the force, in a push to recruit more highly trained men. He specified that if all other things were equal, preference for the cadetships would be given to the sons of deceased returned servicemen. In 1934, Leane built on this scheme by introducing probationary police training for youths aged 17 to 20. Leane was also an advocate for the role of female police officers, and was the first to place a woman in control of the female members of the force. In 1934, he introduced police dogs into service, and in the following year he unveiled a memorial to police officers who had died on duty since 1862. Also in 1935, Leane proposed a nationwide scheme to analyse traffic accidents to determine the risk factors contributing to them, and tailor police traffic enforcement operations, and in the interim, implemented such a program in South Australia. In 1936, a biographical sketch of Leane mentioned that he was a justice of the peace, had been president of the Commonwealth Club in Adelaide, was the chairman of the South Australian branch of the Institute of Public Administration, and had been awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal the previous year. In 1937, Leane was made an Officer of the Order of Saint John, and also received the King George VI Coronation Medal. In the same year he introduced training in morse code for police officers, presaging the introduction of radio to the police force. In 1938, Leane was placed on the retired list of military officers, having reached 60 years of age. His service in the police was extended by an act of Parliament allowing him to serve until he was 65. Leane's continuing concern about traffic accidents and their consequences was highlighted by a map maintained in his office, on which all accidents were marked. In April 1939, with the danger of war in Europe, Leane became a member of the State Emergency Civil Defence Council, with responsibilities for internal security, protection of vulnerable points, control of the civil population, intelligence, detention of enemy civil aircraft, civil flying, and the air examination service. In the same year, after the outbreak of World War II, Leane advocated for the introduction of radio communications into the police, stressing the need for quick response in cases of civil emergency. On 18 June 1940, Leane was appointed as the commander of the Returned and Services League-organised Volunteer Defence Corps (VDC) in South Australia, an organisation similar to the Home Guard in the United Kingdom. Within two weeks, more than 2,000 returned World War I servicemen had enlisted in the VDC. In response to the outbreak of war, by July 1940 Leane had authorised the swearing-in of 3,000 special constables to guard vulnerable points and industry against fifth column elements. On 19 October, Leane commanded a parade of more than 5,000 VDC members, including 2,000 who had travelled from country areas. By February 1941, the VDC had increased to a strength of 8,000 men. During World War II, South Australia was the only state to permit members of the police to enlist in the armed forces, but this was withdrawn after Japan entered the war, due to the need to maintain police numbers. In July 1943, Leane's appointment as VDC commander was extended for twelve months, despite the fact that he had reached the normal Army retirement age of 65. On 30 June 1944, Leane retired as police commissioner, and was replaced by William Francis Johns, a serving superintendent. Retirement alt=a black and white photograph of a military procession alt=a colour photograph of a white marble gravestone After Leane's retirement as police commissioner, he briefly continued his work with the VDC, resigning on 30 July 1944. He was knighted in the 1945 King's birthday honours for his services as police commissioner over a 24-year period. For his service with the VDC during World War II he was issued with the War Medal 1939‚Äì1945 and Australia Service Medal 1939‚Äì1945. In 1946, he became the inaugural president of the Plympton branch of the conservative Liberal and Country League, the forerunner of the state Liberal Party. He continued to lead the Adelaide Anzac Day March each year, and on 7 September 1946 was invested with his knighthood by the Governor-General of Australia, Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester. His police cadet system was allowed to lapse after his retirement, but it was re-introduced by John McKinna, another former soldier, who became commissioner in 1957. He remained a strong advocate of part-time soldiering, as well as a system of universal military training. Leane lived in Adelaide until his death at the Repatriation General Hospital, Daw Park on 25 June 1962, with him and his wife celebrating their diamond wedding anniversary two weeks before his death. He was buried in Centennial Park Cemetery, and was survived by his wife, Edith, and six children: five sons and a daughter. His son Geoffrey was originally a mounted policeman then a detective, was a lieutenant colonel and twice mentioned in despatches during World War II, later became a police inspector, and was deputy commissioner from 1959 to 1972. His namesake son, known as Lionel, became a detective sergeant. Another son, Benjamin, was a warrant officer during World War II, and survived being a prisoner-of-war of the Japanese. On receiving the news of his death, McKinna said that Leane was \\"a grand man and an excellent soldier\\", who \\"was really the father of the present-day police force, as during his term as police commissioner he reorganised the whole force\\". He also said that, \\"The force was now receiving the benefits of his reorganisation and the many new systems and improvements he introduced\\". He observed that Leane \\"was always a strict disciplinarian but was scrupulously fair in all his dealings\\". The Premier of South Australia, Sir Thomas Playford, said that Leane \\"had been one of the great generals of World War I, and had also served with conspicuous ability as police commissioner for many years\\".

It was composed for the soundtrack for a film. It was later performed by Zi Wei (Á¥´Ëñá) and became a hit song among Chinese communities in Southeast Asia. The lyrics of this song were probably written by either Pan Ying-chieh () or Gao Yudang. Background and meaning The song has been caught in a decades-long dispute over authorship and intent. This song has often been associated with a political meaning, for the real Green Island was used as a place of exile for political prisoners from the late 1940s during the single party rule of Taiwan's Kuomintang (Chinese Nationalist Party). It was claimed that a prisoner there named Gao Yudang wrote the song with Wang Bo-wen while they were prisoners there. Pan Ying-chieh, a professional musician, also claimed to have written the lyrics with Chow Lan-ping composing the music for a movie soundtrack. He claimed that the Green Island in the title means Taiwan itself, and that the original intent of the song was a description of unrequited romantic love. Pan's daughter later claimed that he wrote the lyrics originally as an expression of love for one of his students whom he later married. Recordings The song was written in 1954 and a recording of the song was made in the late 1950s by Zi Wei (Á¥´Ëñá). It was performed as a slow romantic ballad accompanied by orchestral strings, a style that was popular in that period. The song first became popular in the Philippines, spreading to other Chinese communities in Southeast Asia, then became popular in Taiwan itself in the early 1960s. The song is notable as one of the earliest songs from a Taiwan-based singer to achieve widespread popularity among other overseas Chinese communities. The song has since been covered by many singers. A cover version of this song appears as a hidden track on Vienna Teng's second album, Warm Strangers (2004). The song was adapted into multiple Cantonese versions, including a notable rendition \\"The Light of Friendship\\" (ÂèãË™º‰πãÂÖâ), sung by Maria Cordero, for the 1987 film Prison on Fire. Although many people believed that Teresa Teng had made this song famous, there is no evidence that Teresa Teng had sung this song.

He was the son of Quintus Servilius Caepio who was consul in 106 BC and who lost his army during the Battle of Arausio (Caepio the Younger served under his father at Arausio). He was elected praetor in 91 BC, and fought for Rome during the Social War (the war between Rome and some of their Italian allies). He was killed in the second year of the war while fighting the Marsi. (It was said that he was killed by the Marsi leader Quintus Poppaedius Silo, who hated him for his involvement in the murder of Marcus Livius Drusus). Biography=Early life Caepio was the son of Quintus Servilius Caepio. He had two sisters, Servilia who married Quintus Lutatius Catulus, and another Servilia who married Marcus Livius Drusus. His mother was likely a daughter of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus. Career Caepio served as quaestor urbanus in 100 BC. In this role he had oversight of the Roman treasury. Three years previously, in 103 BC, his father had been tried before the people by the tribune Gaius Norbanus for his catastrophic loss at the Battle of Arausio; he was convicted and banished. In his quaestorship the younger Caepio used violence to oppose Lucius Appuleius Saturninus, a tribune of the plebs and a political ally of Norbanus, in his attempt to pass a bill to sell grain at a deeply discounted price to the Roman people. Caepio was later brought to trial in 95 BC, but, defended by Lucius Licinius Crassus, he was acquitted. In his role as quaestor urbanus he issued coins with the unusual legend AD FRV EMV EX SC, standing for ad frumentum emundum ex senatus consulto, ‚Äòfor the purchase of grain by order of the senate‚Äô (RRC 330/1). In 92 BC, Caepio prosecuted Marcus Aemilius Scaurus, the eminent princeps senatus, for alleged provincial extortion and, it seems, for taking bribes from Mithridates VI of Pontus. Scaurus managed to issue a counter-accusation against Caepio, and the two accusations collapsed. Scaurus was apparently driven by the experience of the affair to side with Caepio's former brother-in-law, Livius Drusus, who was to be tribune in 91 BC. Alongside the consul Lucius Marcius Philippus, Caepio became the chief opponent of Marcus Livius Drusus' legislative programme, including the laws aimed at giving full citizenship to the Italians. Pliny (NH 33.20) said that the dispute between the two started many years earlier because of a golden ring. Caepio, it was rumoured, was even involved in the assassination of Drusus, an event commonly seen by ancient sources as starting the Social War.Pseudo-Aurelius Victor, De Viris Illustribus 66.13. During the Social War Caepio served as a legate under the consul Publius Rutilius Lupus fighting the northern group of rebels. He defeated the Paeligni, a rebel tribe related to the Marruncini.Philip Matyszak, Cataclysm 90 BC, p. 94; Livy, Periochae, 73.5. After the death of Lupus he was made joint-commander of Rome's northern army with Gaius Marius.Philip Matyszak, Cataclysm 90 BC, p. 94; Lynda Telford, Sulla, p. 88. Marius had expected sole command and he did not get along with Caepio with disastrous results. After having dealt with a raiding legion of Marsi at Varnia, Caepio attempted to give Marius instructions, but Marius ignored them.Lynda Telford, Sulla, p. 89. Caepio was left on his own and was then obliged to move his legions back towards Caeoli. Once they reached the Arno at Sublaqueum they were tricked into leaving a secure position and attacked by the Marsi. Caepio's army was massacred, with Caepio being killed by the Marsi leader, Quintus Poppaedius Silo.  Family  He likely had a son named Quintus from an early marriage to an unkown woman. Caepio later married Livia, sister of Marcus Livius Drusus, around 100 BC. Caepio and Livia had three children: Servilia, the mistress of Julius Caesar, mother of Brutus, and mother-in-law of Gaius Cassius Longinus; another daughter Servilia Minor; and a son, Gnaeus Servilius Caepio. Caepio divorced Livia in c. 97 BC after falling out with her brother. Livia subsequently remarried in c. 96 BC to Marcus Porcius Cato: their children were Marcus (the famous Cato the Younger) and Porcia. However, Livia and Porcius Cato both died between 95 BC and 92 BC. As a result, all of Livia's children (including those by Caepio) grew up in the household of Livius Drusus, until the latter's assassination in 91 BC (Plutarch, Cato the Younger 1.1).

The trust was named after Lisa McPherson, a Scientology member who died in 1995 after being in the Church of Scientology‚Äôs care for 17 days. Their stated goal was to \\"expose the deceptive and abusive practices of Scientology and help those victimized by [the Church of Scientology].\\" Of the five staff members at the Lisa McPherson trust, four were former members of Scientology. History The LMT staff included Stacy Brooks (President), Jesse Prince (Vice-President), Teresa Summers (Vice-President), Mark Bunker (Videographer), Jeff Jacobsen (Librarian), Robert Peterson (Office Manager), and Ingrid Wagner (Reception). Controversy=Location The company‚Äôs headquarters were located in downtown Clearwater, Florida. Many property managers denied the group access to their buildings after being contacted by members of Scientology. Eventually, the group purchased a building at 33 N Fort Harrison Ave, which was situated from Scientology buildings. Scientology offered to buy the building out from Minton but the property manager declined. Picketing The company frequently engaged in pickets in downtown Clearwater. On the anniversary of Lisa McPherson‚Äôs death in 1999, the group used a projector to beam a message on the side of the Fort Harrison Hotel which read: \\"Lisa McPherson: We will never forget you.\\" An injunction was quickly sought against the group and a no-picket zone was established in front of Scientology buildings. Church members and trust members were also ordered to keep away from each other at all times. In 2001 this injunction was expanded by a county judge. The new order prevented either side from yelling, shouting, whistling, singing, blowing a horn whistle or other noisemaker, or otherwise creating noise which would disturb \\"reasonable persons of ordinary sensibilities.\\" It also expanded the no-picket zone to include the area across the street from Scientology‚Äôs dining hall. The new order also required trust members to inform the police of any picket an hour in advance of the event. To enforce this ruling, Clearwater city painted two white lines across Watterson Avenue, stating that while Scientologists were loading or unloading buses in the area, the trust staff and members could not enter it. Legal problems In late 2001, Scientology named the Lisa McPherson Trust as co-defendants in a case they had brought against the estate of Lisa McPherson. For-profit status Bob Minton claimed that the trust had a for-profit status to allow them to hide financial and other records from the Church of Scientology. Scientologists claimed that the for-profit status was proof that the group was created in order to allow Minton to recuperate the almost $2.5 million that he had put towards creating the group. Reaction from the Church of Scientology The Church vehemently opposed the creation of the trust. They levelled many accusations against it including allegations that the trust was violently attempting to deprogram ex-Scientologists. Scientology hired off- duty police officers, who were paid close to $150,000 over the course of 15 months, to ensure that trust members stayed away from Scientology buildings and parishioners at all times. Closure of the trust The trust was disbanded in November 2001. Minton cited mounting legal pressure from Scientology as the official reason. The closure of the trust was delayed for some months as a judge ordered that Scientology could conduct an official review of all of the Trust‚Äôs records. This included phone records and financial records which were later produced in court.

In 1922, the mill, along with Knox timber holdings, was sold to the Temple Lumber Company. By 1930, East Mayfield had a population of 1,179. Most of the town's adults employed at the lumber company. Temple Lumber Company continued to operate the mill until 1937 when it was destroyed by fire. Due to the rapid depletion of timber on the company's land, the mill was never rebuilt.

It stars Dick Powell, Ann Dvorak and Fred Allen, and features Patsy Kelly, David Rubinoff and Paul Whiteman and his band with singer/pianist Ramona. The script by Nunnally Johnson was based on a story by producer Darryl F. Zanuck (writing as Melville Crossman) and contained uncredited additional dialogue by Fred Allen, James Gow, Edmund Gross and Harry Tugend. Thanks a Million was nominated for the Academy Award for Sound (E. H. Hansen) in 1935. It was remade in 1946 as If I'm Lucky, with Perry Como and Phil Silvers in the Powell and Allen roles. Plot Stranded in a small town in a downpour, the manager of a traveling musical show (Fred Allen) convinces the handlers of a boring long-winded local judge running for governor (Raymond Walburn) to hire his group to attract people to the politician's rallies. When the show's crooner, Eric Land (Dick Powell), upstages the judge, he's fired, but on a return visit he saves the day by standing in for the judge, who is too drunk to speak. Impressed by his poise, the party's bosses ask Eric to take over as candidate. The singer, knowing he has no chance to win, agrees for the exposure and the radio airtime in which he can showcase his singing. Soon, though, his girlfriend Sally (Ann Dvorak) becomes annoyed at the amount of time Eric is spending with the wife of one of the bosses, and she leaves when she thinks he has lied to her. When the bosses ask Eric to agree to patronage appointments that will lead to easy graft for all of them, he exposes them on the radio, telling the voters that voting for him would be a huge mistake and urging them to vote for his opponent. At the end Eric is, of course, elected governor, then reunited with Sally.

He won an Academy Award for The Lost Thing, a 2011 animated film adaptation of a 2000 picture book he wrote and illustrated. Other books he has written and illustrated include The Red Tree and The Arrival. Tan was born in Fremantle, Western Australia, and grew up in the northern suburbs of Perth, Western Australia. In 2006, his wordless graphic novel (or silent book) The Arrival won the Book of the Year prize as part of the New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards. The same book won the Children's Book Council of Australia Picture Book of the Year award in 2007.. and the Western Australian Premier's Book Awards Premier's Prize in 2006.. Tan's work has been described as an \\"Australian vernacular\\" that is \\"at once banal and uncanny, familiar and strange, local and universal, reassuring and scary, intimate and remote, guttersnipe and sprezzatura. No rhetoric, no straining for effect. Never other than itself.\\" For his career contribution to \\"children's and young adult literature in the broadest sense\\" Tan won the 2011 Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award from the Swedish Arts Council, the biggest prize in children's literature.  Biography =Early life As a boy, Tan spent time illustrating poems and stories and drawing dinosaurs, robots and spaceships. At school he was known as a talented artist. At the age of eleven, he became a fan of The Twilight Zone television series as well as books that bore similar themes. Tan cites Ray Bradbury as a favorite at this time. These stories led to Tan writing his own short stories. Of his effort at writing as a youth, Tan tells, \\"I have a small pile of rejection letters as testament to this ambition!\\" At the age of sixteen, Tan's first illustration appeared in the Australian magazine Aurealis in 1990. Transition to illustration Tan almost studied to become a geneticist, and enjoyed chemistry, physics, history and English while in high school as well as art and claimed that he did not really know what he wanted to do. During his university studies, Tan decided to move from academic studies to working as an artist.. Tan continued his education at the University of Western Australia where he studied Fine Arts, English Literature and History. While this was of interest to him, there was little practical work involved. In 1995, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts.. Work process Initially, Tan worked in black and white because the final reproductions would be printed that way. Some black and white mediums he used include pens, inks, acrylics, charcoal, scraperboard, photocopies, and linocuts. Tan's current colour works still begin in black and white. He uses a graphite pencil to make sketches on ordinary copy paper. The sketches are then reproduced numerous times with different versions varying with parts added or removed. Sometimes scissors are used for this purpose. The cut and paste collage idea in these early stages is often extend to the finished production with many of his illustrations using such materials as \\"glass, metal, cuttings from other books and dead insects\\". Tan describes himself as a slow worker who revises his work many times along the way. He is interested in loss and alienation, and believes that children in particular react well to issues of natural justice. He feels he is \\"like a translator\\" of ideas, and is happy and flattered to see his work adapted and interpreted in film and music (such as by the Australian Chamber Orchestra). Influences Tan draws from a large source of inspiration and cites many influences on his work. His comment on the subject is: \\"I‚Äôm pretty omnivorous when it comes to influences, and I like to admit this openly.\\" Some influences are very direct. The Lost Thing is a strong example where Tan makes visual references to famous artworks. Many of his influences are a lot more subtle visually, some of the influences are ideological. Below are some influences he has named in various interviews: *Films: Brazil, Yellow Submarine *Filmmakers: Tim Burton, Terry Gilliam, Stanley Kubrick, Ridley Scott *Artists and illustrators: Francis Bacon, Hieronymus Bosch, Raymond Briggs, Ron Brooks, Frederic Clement, Joseph Cornell, Giorgio de Chirico, Milton Glaser, Edward Gorey, John Olsen, Michael Leunig, Ren√© Magritte, Sidney Nolan, Gerald Scarfe, Katsushika Hokusai, J. Otto Seibold, Peter S√≠s, Lane Smith, Ralph Steadman, Arthur Streeton, Brett Whiteley, John Brack, Fred Williams, and Chris Van Allsburg *Other: paintings in galleries, \\"an arrangement of clouds, a lighting effect, a picture in a newspaper, or indeed supermarket plumbing\\",. incidents, textures and accidental compositions created by objects, things from other cultures and times, Polish poster art, streets, clouds, jokes, times of the day, people, animals, the way paint runs down a canvas, or colors go together.

A solicitor by profession, he served as Minister for Defence from 1923 to 1925, under Prime Minister Stanley Bruce. He was a member of the House of Representatives from 1906 to 1910 and 1919 to 1929. Early life A younger Bowden Bowden was born in Parramatta, New South Wales, the second son of Sarah Anne (n√©e Smith) and John Ebenezer Bowden. His great-grandfather Thomas Bowden had arrived in the colony in 1812 and became one of Parramatta's earliest schoolmasters. Educated at Newington College (1882-1884)Newington College Register of Past Students 1863-1998 (Syd, 1999) pp18 and Sydney Boys High School (1888‚Äì92), Bowden qualified as a solicitor in 1894 after serving articles with his father. Four years he later married Reinetta May Murphy. In 1902, he took possession of Endrim, a former clergy house previously owned by his father. It is now heritage listed. Political career Bowden was an alderman on the Granville Borough Council from 1904 to 1907. He was elected to federal parliament at the 1906 federal election, aged 34, winning the newly created Division of Nepean for the Anti-Socialist Party. He was defeated in 1910 after a single term, losing to the Australian Labor Party (ALP) candidate George Cann. At the 1919 election, Bowden recaptured Nepean as a Nationalist, replacing the retiring member Richard Orchard. He switched to the Division of Parramatta at the 1922 election. Minister for Defence Eric Bowden Stanley Bruce replaced Billy Hughes as prime minister in February 1923, and appointed Bowden as Minister for Defence in the new ministry. His appointment occasioned some surprise, as he had no military experience, was not regarded as a strong speaker, and had shown little interest in defence matters. In 1923, Bowden oversaw the passage of the Air Force Act 1923, the major governing act for the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) that had been established two years earlier. He also oversaw the introduction of the government's five-year defence programme, which provided for the creation of a cruiser and submarine force. He argued for greater funding for defence to counter the perceived threat of Japan, but also allowed a reduction in funding for the military and naval colleges. Bowden resigned from the ministry in January 1925, citing ill health. Final years In his last terms in parliament, Bowden served on the joint select committee on electoral law and as a member of the royal commission into the Constitution. He lost his seat at the 1929 election, which saw Labor return to government. Bowden suffered from chronic respiratory disease in his last years and was also in financial difficulties, forcing him to subdivide the land around Endrim. He died suddenly on 13 February 1931 at his home in Parramatta.

He was the son of Aubrey de Vere, master chamberlain, and Alice (died c. 1163), a daughter of Gilbert de Clare. In 1136 or 1137 Aubrey de Vere married Beatrice, the daughter of Henry, Constable of Bourbourg, and the granddaughter and heiress of Manasses, Count of Gu√Ænes in the Pas de Calais. After the death of Manasses late in 1138, Aubrey travelled to Gu√Ænes, did homage to Thierry, Count of Flanders, and was made Count of Gu√Ænes by right of his wife.Lambert de Ardres, The History of the Counts of Guines and Lords of Ardres, ed. L. Shopkow (University of Pennsylvania Press: 2011), 86‚Äì87 The marriage, however, may not have been consummated, due to the poor health of Beatrice. Aubrey de Vere succeeded on 15 May 1141, after his father had been slain by a mob in London. at a time of civil war between King Stephen and the Empress Matilda over the succession to the crown. King Stephen had been captured at the Battle of Lincoln in February 1141, so Aubrey did homage to the Empress. His brother-in-law, the Earl of Essex, appears to have negotiated the grant of an earldom to Aubrey in July 1141, which grant was confirmed by Henry fitz Empress in Normandy. The latter charter provided that Aubrey de Vere would be Earl of Cambridgeshire, with the third penny, unless that county were held by the King of Scots, in which case he was to have a choice of four other titles. In the event, de Vere took the title of Earl of Oxford.Regesta Regum Anglo-Normannorum, III, 233‚Äì235. Earl Geoffrey made his peace with King Stephen when the king regained his freedom late in 1141 and most likely Aubrey de Vere did as well. In 1143, however, the King arrested Essex and Oxford at St. Albans. Both were forced to surrender their castles to the King to regain their liberty. The earl of Essex retaliated by rebelling against the king; it appears that Oxford did not actively or openly support his brother-in-law. At some time between 1144 and 1146 the Constable of Bourbourg, arranged a divorce for his daughter Countess Beatrice with Earl Aubrey's consent, after which Oxford ceased to be Count of Gu√Ænes.. In or before 1151 Oxford married Euphemia. King Stephen and his wife, Queen Maud, gave the manor of Ickleton, Cambridgeshire, as Euphemia's marriage portion. The marriage was short-lived; Euphemia was dead by 1154, leaving no known issue. She was buried at Colne Priory. On 3 May 1152 Queen Maud died at Oxford's seat of Castle Hedingham,. and in the winter of 1152‚Äì3 Oxford was with the King at the siege of Wallingford, attesting important charters in 1153 as \\"earl Aubrey.\\" In 1162 or 1163 Earl Aubrey took as his third wife Agnes, the daughter of Henry of Essex, lord of Rayleigh. At the time of the marriage Agnes was probably aged twelve. Soon after their marriage, Aubrey's father-in-law was accused of treason and fought (and lost) a judicial duel. By 1165 he attempted to have the marriage annulled, allegedly because Agnes had been betrothed to his brother, Geoffrey de Vere, but probably in reality because her father had been disgraced and ruined. Oxford reportedly 'kept his wife shut up and did not allow her to attend church or go out, and refused to cohabit with her', according to the letter the bishop of London wrote to the Pope about the case when the young countess appealed to the Roman Curia. The pope sided with Agnes and declared the marriage valid, but the earl continued to refuse to take her back as his wife. Agnes's friends appealed to the Bishop of London, and ultimately to Pope Alexander III, who in 1171 or 1172 directed the bishop to order Oxford to restore her to her conjugal rights or to suffer interdiction and excommunication.DeAragon, R. \\"The Child-bride, the Pope, and the Earl: The Marital Fortunes of Agnes of Essex,\\" Henry I and the Anglo- Norman World, (2007), pp. 200‚Äì216. By Agnes, Oxford eventually had four sons, Aubrey de Vere, 2nd Earl of Oxford, Ralph, Robert de Vere, 3rd Earl of Oxford, and Henry, and a daughter, Alice.. In 1184 Oxford obtained the wardship of the person of Isabel de Bolebec, daughter of Walter de Bolebec,Not to be confused with her aunt, Isabel de Bolebec, widow of Henry de Nonant and daughter of Hugh de Bolebec of Whitchurch, who married another of Oxford's sons, Robert de Vere, later 3rd Earl of Oxford. but not the custody of her lands. In 1190 he paid 500 marks for the right to marry her to his eldest son and heir, Aubrey de Vere, later 2nd Earl of Oxford.. Oxford served during the civil war of 1173‚Äì4, helping to repel a force under Robert de Beaumont, 3rd Earl of Leicester, which landed in Suffolk on 29 September 1173.. He was present on 3 September 1189 at the coronation of King Richard I.. Oxford died 26 December 1194, and was buried at Colne Priory. His third wife survived him, and later was buried by his side.. Oxford was a benefactor to several religious houses, including Colne Priory, and Hatfield Regis Priory. He and his wife founded a small nunnery at Castle Hedingham in Essex.

He was one of the main authors of Saivite Tirumurai, his work forms volume eight of the Tirumurai, the key religious text of Tamil language Shaiva Siddhanta. A minister to the Pandya king Varagunavarman II (c. 862 C.E. ‚Äì 885 C.E.) (also called Arimarthana Pandiyan), he lived in Madurai. His work is a poetic expression of the joy of God- experience, the anguish of being separated from God. Although he is a prominent saint in Southern India, he is not counted among the sixty-three nayanars. Life left Manikkavacakar is said to have born in Vadhavoor (Thiruvadhavoor, near by Melur in Madurai district), seven miles from Madurai on the banks of river Vaigai. He belonged to the Pandithar saivite temple priest guild. His father was a temple priest.Nayanars The group wore a top tilted knot \\"Purva Sikha\\" to denote servitorship to Lord Siva like sambandar, etc. A mural and statuette of Manikkavacakar with Purva Sikha head knot is seen in Tirupperunturai near Pudukkottai. A poetic and elaborate hagiography of Manikkavacakar and his works was written in the 16th century and is called Tiruvilayadal puranam, meaning \\"An account of divine deeds\\". The same is not available now in its original form. Another called Vadhavoorar puranam and yet another Sanskrit work of the 12th century CE on the same saint is now missing. According to accounts the king of Pandyan dynasty had selected Manikkavacakar as a part of his legion after seeing his military acumen and had once entrusted him with a large amount of money to purchase horses for his cavalry. On his way he met an ascetic devotee of Siva, who in fact was Siva himself. Manikkavacakar received enlightenment, realised that material things are transitory and built the temple of Shiva in Tirupperunturai with the money.B.S. 2011, p. 77 King Varaguna also was preached with knowledge of reality and blessed with mukthi after Lord Shiva made him realize his small worldly mistake. Varaguana maharaja immediately gave up his throne and attained mukthi at the feet of Lord Shiva. Manikkavacakar's birth name is unclear, but he was known as Vadhavoorar after his birthplace. Manikkavacakar means 'man with words as precious as Manikam'. According to Ramana Maharshi, it is said that when Manikkavacakar attained mukthi, his body dissolved in a blinding light without leaving a corpse behind.Talks with Ramana Maharshi- chapter 215 Literary work ASI Museum, Vellore Thereafter Manikkavacakar moved from one place to other, singing and composing devotional songs. Finally, he settled in Chidambaram. His Tiruvasakam is placed near the murti of Shiva there. Several verses of Tiruvasagam including the accho patikam after singing which he attained mukti at Thillai Natarajar's feet are also engraved in the walls of the chidambaram temple. The tiruchazhal hymn after singing which the communal Buddhists were exposed is also engraved in one of the prakarams. The work tiruchitrambalakkovaiyar was sung entirely in thillai chidambaram. Throughout his work he discusses how important it is to forego attachments and cultivate dispassionate, devoted, sincere and simple hearted love to lord Shiva in order to attain his beatitude and also that the five letters of na ma si va ya alone give one mukti. Manikkavacakar's work has several parts. The Tiruvembavai, a collection of twenty hymns in which he has imagined himself as a woman following the Paavai Nonbu and praising Shiva. The twenty songs of Tiruvembavai and ten songs of Tiruppalliezhuchi on the Tirupperunturai Lord are sung all over Tamil Nadu in the holy month of Margazhi ( The 9th month of the Tamil calendar, December and January). Manikkavacakar is believed to have won intellectual arguments with Buddhists of Ceylon at Chidambaram.B.S. 2011, p. 162 His festival is celebrated in the Tamil month of Aani (June - July). Manikkavacakar's hagiography is found in the Thiruvilaiyadar Puranam (16th century AD). In 1921, an English translation of Manikkavacakar's hymns was done by Francis Kingsbury and GE Phillips, both of United Theological College, Bangalore (Edited by Fred Goodwill) and published in a book as Hymns of the Tamil ≈öaivite Saints, by the Oxford University Press Associated temples Manikkavacagar visited various temples in Thanjavur, North Arcot, Chengalpattu, Madras, Tirunelveli and Madurai districts and revered the deities.B.S. 2011, p. 36 *Sculptures illustrating his life are found in the Minakshi-Sundaresvara temple at Madurai. * Manikkavacakar is said to have built the temple of Siva in Tirupperunturai. * He is said to have lived at Chidambaram Tamil Nadu. * He is closely associated with Tiru Uthirakosamangai.

The Atlantic was designed by Bob Hubbach and inspired by the Bugatti Atlantique. The idea for this car began out as a sketch on a napkin by Chrysler's president Bob Lutz in early 1993 and also involved the automaker's chief designer, Tom Gale. The Atlantic has several similarities to the opulent vehicles of the 1930s such as the aforementioned Bugatti Type 57S Atlantique (or Atlantic). Its styling is also more than a little inspired by the Talbot-Lago T150 SS Coupe that was constructed in 1938, such as the shape of the side windows and the curved boot. Some of the retro details include a straight-8-engine that was actually constructed from two 4-cylinder Dodge Neon engines with an S configuration 4.0 L., which is rarely used in modern cars. Other retro touches to the car's look include the interior that is replete with Art Deco-style gauges. The Atlantic Concept has around and uses Chrysler's Autostick transmission. Riding on a wheelbase, its front wheels measure 21 inches and 22 inches in the rear ‚Äî large at that time. It was one of Chrysler's most popular concept vehicles and has proven popular enough to still make the occasional public appearance.

History The mall opened in 1974. Its three department stores were Macy's, Sears and Stix, Baer & Fuller's. The mall featured a unique three-level, central atrium, with a series of ramps and stair risers traversing the expanse of open space. In the center of the atrium, on the lowest floor, was a food court. When it first opened and for many years afterward, the mall's advertising carried the memorable slogan \\"Independence Center: The \\"I\\" has it.\\" Independence Center even featured an enormous flashing advertising marquee which stood along I-70. Independence Center was built by Homart, a division of Sears Roebuck & Co. It was later acquired, owned and managed by Chicago-based LaSalle. The mall saw its first cosmetic renovation in the mid-1980s. Stix Baer & Fuller closed in 1982 and Dillard's occupied its space in 1984. In 1985, after Dillard's acquired Macy's midwest stores, it sold the Independence Center location to Mercantile Stores, then the parent company of The Jones Store Co. In 1994, Independence Center was purchased by Simon Property Group. In 1996, the mall added a two-story carousel in the atrium; and in 1998, the mall underwent a massive $20 million renovation, which improved the property's aesthetics and vertical transportation, and also improved the food court. Also in 1998, a large children's play area was added. In 2004, Independence Center saw another renovation, which added small shop space on the outside of the mall facing 39th Street. In 2006 Macy's returned to its original location in the mall after the Federated-May department stores merger, which resulted in all Kansas City area Jones Store locations being converted to Macy's stores. In 2018, Independence Center was sold to Pacific Retail Capital Partners. On August 6, 2019, it was announced that Sears will be closing this location as part of a plan to close 26 stores nationwide. The store closed on October 27, 2019 at 3PM. On August 20, 2019, the carousel on the ground floor was disassembled and removed from the mall. Overview Independence Center is the second largest mall in the KC Metro Area, behind Oak Park Mall. With 12 million annual visitors, Independence Center has constantly been named the most visited attraction in Independence, Missouri.

Institutions of this nature were to be found in most of the dioceses of the United States. They were usually opened to receive orphans, truants, juvenile delinquents, and destitute children. The largest, by far, was the Catholic Protectory in New York. Background Secular protectories or reform schools, or euphemistically termed \\"training schools\\", were instituted in America during the initial quarter of the nineteenth century. On 1 January 1825, the House of Refuge was opened with appropriate exercises on what is now Madison Square, New York City. Nine children, just gathered from the streets, were present and formed the nucleus of the new establishment that later grew to vast proportions on Randalls Island. Boston followed with a similar institution in 1826; Philadelphia in 1828; and in 1855 a girls' reformatory was founded at Lancaster, Massachusetts on the family or cottage plan, dividing the institution into three separate houses of thirty girls each, with their three matrons, all under the general supervision of a superintendent. In the great majority of cases the institutions were public, but in several states the reformation and correction of delinquents was entrusted in whole or in part to private or religious agencies. History San Mich√©le, the first protectory for youth, was founded at Rome in 1704 by Pope Clement XI. When John Howard, the English prison reformer (1726‚Äì90), visited the institution, he read above the entrance this inscription: \\"Clement XI, Supreme Pontiff, for the reformation and education of criminal youths, to the end that those who when idle had been injurious to the State, might, when better instructed and trained, become useful to it. In the Year of Grace 1704; of the Pontiff, the fourth\\". On a marble slab inserted in one of the interior walls he read further: \\"It is of little use to restrain criminals by punishment, unless you reform them by education\\". This became the keynote of modern penology. The inmates worked together by day in a large hall where was hung up in large letters, visible to all, the Latin word silentium, indicating that the work must go on in silence. At night they slept in separate cells. This system of associated or congregate labour in silence by day and cellular separation at night, for which, under the name of the Auburn System, so much excellence has been claimed in American penology, was thus inaugurated at Rome in the beginning of the eighteenth century, more than a hundred years prior to the introduction of the method into use here. The same pontiff established in connexion with this foundation of San Mich√©le a special court for the trial of offenders under twenty years of age, a plan that has re-appeared in the Juvenile Courts established in America and elsewhere for the trial of delinquents under (seventeen years of) age.De Lacy, William. \\"Protectories.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 15 August 2019 New York Catholic Protectory The New York Catholic Protectory was, at one time, the largest child welfare organization in the country. By the mid 1860s, many children in New York City were the offspring of immigrants living in squalid and disease-ridden neighborhoods. Adding to the destitution was the fact that casualties of the Civil War left many women widows and their children fatherless.Munch, Janet Butler. \\"At Home in the Bronx: Children at the New York Catholic Protectory 1865-1938\\". The Bronx County Historical Society Journal. 52, 1/2 (Spring, 2015): 30-48 \\"The Society for the Protection of Destitute Roman Catholic Children in the City of New York\\" was chartered in 1863. Former Episcopal bishop of North Carolina Levi Silliman Ives was the founder and first president of the Catholic Protectory. It began with two buildings on Thirty-sixth and Thirty-seventh Streets in Manhattan, for boys under the care of the Christian Brothers,\\"New York Catholic Protectory\\", The Catholic Church in the United States of America, Catholic Editing Company, 1914, p. 60 a congregation founded in France, in the first quarter of the eighteenth century, by St. John Baptiste de la Salle for the training and correction of wayward youth. Many of the boys received have been adjudicated truants. The Boys Department subsequently relocated to Eighty-six Street and Fifth Ave. In October 1863, a building at the corner of Eighty-sixth Street and Second Avenue was secured for girls and placed under the direction of the Sisters of Charity. This proving too small, a forty-acre farm was purchased in Westchester and a new building erected in 1859. When that building burned in 1872, the older girls were instructed to each escort a younger one and all escaped injury. Along with religious instruction and an elementary school education in common subjects, many girls were taught trades and often given the opportunity to work outside the school in favorable conditions. Those who showed either interest or aptitude received lessons in music, art, or crafts from the sisters. In 1865 the Protectory purchased the William Varian 114 acre farm in the village of West Chester near St. Raymond's Church. A school and dormitories were built. The institution was an integral part of the parish until it was sold in 1938.\\"The Catholic Protectory, Parkchester\\", Bronx Historical Society Besides orphans placed there by the Charity Commission, and juvenile delinquents placed by the courts, the Protectory also accepted children placed there by parents or guardians unable to adequately provide for them. By 1878, the Protectory was serving over 3,000 children annually. According to Janet Butler Munch, \\"It effectively served as a safety net for children and families in need. The goal was not long-term commitments for children but return to their families when conditions stabilized. The sisters took care of all the girls, and any boys under ten years of age; the brothers had charge of the older boys. Unlike many similar institutions, the Protectory provided training in skills that would allow its charges to make a living upon leaving. It was felt that vocational studies should not be postponed until mature years, but should be commenced early, so as to accustom the boy to what may afterwards prove to be the means of earning his own livelihood when he shall have left the Protectory. The boys learned printing in all its branches, photography, tailoring, shoemaking, laundry work, industrial and ornamental drawing, sign-painting, blacksmithing, plumbing, carpentry, bricklaying, stone-work, baking in its different branches, and in practical knowledge of boilers, engines, dynamos and electric wiring.Comfort, Randall, History of the Bronx Borough, Chapter XXXV, North Side News, 1906 The girls learned to embroider, cook and make gloves, typewriting, and stenography. The students in the occupational training classes were paid, given individual accounts, and encouraged to save their earnings. Graduates of the Printing House found work at New York newspapers as compositors and pressmen. All clothing was made on site in the Tailoring Department. \\"The boys handled all maintenance work on the property including painting, carpentry, masonry, bricklaying, and electrical work. The boys from different trades would make up sports teams to compete with one another. In 1920, the Lincoln Giants, a professional baseball team from Harlem moved from their old home park, Olympic Field (at Fifth Avenue and 136th Street), to the Catholic Protectory Oval in the Bronx, playing to a rapt crowd of fans. The Protectory Band played ‚ÄúGarry Owen‚Äù at Theodore Roosevelt's 1904 presidential inauguration. St. Philip's Home St. Philip's Home was opened in 1902 at 417 Broome Street in Manhattan as transitional housing for boys who had \\"aged out\\" of the Protectory home. The Protectory's main office was at 415 Broome Street. It was run by the Christian Brothers and could accommodate about 100 young men. There former students were assisted with job placement and housing for those who were unemployed or homeless.\\"New York Catholic Protectory\\", Annual Report of the State Board of Charities of the State of New York, Weed, Parsons and Company, 1912, p. 444 Some would visit on weekends to use the library or recreational facilities. According to the 1910 Report of Benevolent Institutions, young African-American men numbered among the 100 residents. Benevolent Institutions: 1910, U.S. Bureau of the Census, U.S. Government Printing Office, 1913, p. 128 Lincolndale Agricultural School At the Lincoln Agricultural School, a subsidiary institution, the boys also receive a training in dairy-farming and other agriculture. In 1938, due to high overhead and declining residents with other resources and options available, the Girls' Department was closed and the Boys' relocated to the Lincolndale facility. The main campus was sold to Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, which constructed the Parkchester planned-housing development on the site.

The school served as both an orphanage and boarding school for boys, teaching them life and labor skills. At the time, Archbishop Martin Spalding pointed out the need for such a school, and enlisted the aid of the Xaverian Brothers to assist in running the school for the Archdiocese. As attendance at the school grew, the large original granite Victorian building was constructed and in use by 1868. Babe Ruth was a resident for a number of years and would later return to visit the boys, both here and at the New York Protectory. Similar institutions were: in the United States, at Arlington, New Jersey (Diocese of Newark); Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Utica, New York (Diocese of Syracuse).

History Bannister Mall was built and opened in August 1980 at 5600 Bannister Road in Kansas City, Missouri between I-435 and Hillcrest Road. The area was once the site of the Three Trails (Santa Fe, California, and Oregon) and the Santa Fe trail actually crossed the original property.

The mall's original anchors were Macy's, JCPenney, The Jones Store and Sears. In the early 1980s, Bannister Mall was the \\"place to go\\" with a draw over a large area that was mostly from South Kansas City, suburban Jackson County, Missouri, and Johnson County, Kansas. In 1988-1990, an area north and east of the mall called Benjamin Plaza was added to the commercial retail area. In the late 1980s, bus service from mid-town Kansas city was extended to the area, and by the mid to late 1990s with newer and more desirable developments further south and in Johnson County Kansas, the area began to wane. Also, due to consistent crime, the area around Bannister Mall earned a bad reputation. This combination led to the present blight of the area. JCPenney closed in 2000, followed by Dillard's in 2002 and The Jones Store in early 2005. In 2006, Sears closed leaving the mall anchor-less. Bannister Mall once hosted 180 stores, but by 2007 only 50 stores were open. In April 2007, it was announced that due to low population and rising costs of operation that the mall would close. At the time, only half of the mall was open, with the northern part blocked off. The failure of the mall was largely due to migration to the suburbs and a perception of the area being unsafe. The only new construction in the area is the replacement of the Kansas City Fire Department's Fire Station 41, which once was facing Bannister Road and now is facing Hillcrest Road. The nearby Walmart Supercenter closed in January 2007, which was a day before a new Walmart opened on the site of the former Blue Ridge Mall now called Blue Ridge Crossing. The Bannister Wal-Mart was one of the company's earliest Hypermart stores, but it later changed to the Supercenter format. At the end of May 2007, Bannister Mall closed its doors. Demolition and redevelopment The mall was demolished in early 2009. In December 2009, the Kansas City Wizards, who had previously planned to build a new stadium on the site, finalized plans to build their stadium in Kansas instead. Lane4 Property Group, Inc. stated that they would continue development of the Bannister Mall site, but as a retail and office project called The Trails. After much delay on August 1, 2013 Cerner Corporation, a large medical information technology firm based in the Kansas City area, announced they would redevelop the former Bannister Mall location as a major office park housing future expansion of their corporation and perhaps other business entities as well. Cerner will acquire 236 acres to meet expected future growth of the company and could eventually employ an additional 12,000 to 15,000 workers. According to Cerner officials the site will include a training center, potential future data centers, and worker amenities such as on-site daycare, a health clinic, food service, and a fitness center. The corporation may also make a portion of the land available for other business developments such as a hotel, retail stores, and restaurants. Cerner had originally expressed interest in the site in 2009, and at various other times since, however a deal could not be finalized.

They eventually moved to Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu. While there is significant dissention as to his exact time, historians place him between 1610 and 1745 AD. An extensive research done with the help of archives preserved in Saraswati Mahal Library has helped place the time closer to 1650 AD ‚Äì 1745 AD, and he reportedly lived a long life. He mastered music at a very early age and studied Puranas, Bhagavata Purana and other Sanskrit works. He renounced family at a very early age and took on a life of a religious devotion. He went to Varanasi to spread his philosophy. Teertha was very well versed in Music and, Natya Shastra, and a great scholar in Sanskrit. He used at least 34 popular ragas. He used Triputa, Adi, Rupaka, Chapu, Jampa, Matya, Vilamba, Eka and Ata taalams. Many of the songs are structurally well set for direct use as nritya or natya padams. He carefully avoided complex usages and utilized easy expressions. His Gadyams and Padyams are exquisite in beauty. He used 17 different Chandas or meters such as Anushtup, Arya, Indravajra, Bhujangaprayadam, Shardula vikriditam, Vasanta tilaka, Prithvi. He wrote 15 books and some of them are available in Benares Hindu University and Parijatapaharanam at Saraswathi Mahal in Tanjore. He is also credited with composing two other operas, Parijaa Apaharanam and Haribhakti Sudharnavam. Sri Narayana Tirtha received divine blessings at Varagur in Thanjavur Dist.. His mukthi sthalam ( Place of eternity) is at varagur.Though he lived in Varahur, Sri Narayana Tirtha attained Siddhi in 1745 at a nearby village called Thirupoonthuruthy under a huge mango tree, on the banks of river Kudamurutti, on the Masi Sukla Ashtami, Guruvaram, Krithika Nakshatram day. It is said that he attained \`Jeeva Samadhi‚Äô (even while alive). A small shrine has been constructed on this hallowed spot, under the sprawling mango tree. Sri Krishna Leela Tarangini Narayana Teertha was the author of a Sanskrit opera called Sri Krishna Leela Tarangini on the life of the Hindu god Lord Krishna. It deals with the life story of Krishna starting with his birth, childhood pranks and ending with his marriage to Rukmini. Narayana Teertha uses various literary and musical forms such as songs, prose passages, Slokas (praises in verse), Dwipadis (couplets), etc. The songs are popularly called \\"Tarangas\\" means waves. The lyrics are simple yet beautiful and effective. The Astapadis of Jayadeva are said to be the inspiration. Legend has it that the inspiration to compose this piece occurred when he was along the banks of Naducauvery. He was suffering from a serious stomach ailment and prayed that he should be given the strength to go back to Tirupati, where it all started. A divine voice asked him to follow a boar (varaha) to wherever it led him. The varaha led him to Bhupatirajapuram, which came to be known as \`Varahur' later. The people of the village knew that a maha-purusha was coming. With their help, he raised the temple for Sri Lakshmi Narayana and Lord Venkateswara and settled down on the banks of river \`Kudamurutty' the name by which the Cauvery was known at this place.http://www.hindu.com/fr/2005/02/04/stories/2005020400380300.htm Tarangini is an opera highly suitable for dance drama and it has been very well utilized by Indian classical dancers, especially in Kuchipudi over the last two centuries.

It was the first settlement of German immigrants in Australia and was named after the village of Klemzig, near Z√ºllichau in southeastern Brandenburg in the German state of Prussia, where they originated from. That Klemzig is now in western Poland and is now known by the Polish name Klƒôpsk.  Background  Torrens\\" The initial establishment of Klemzig as an Old Lutheran settlement in the South Australian Colony is attributed to a decision by Pastor August Ludwig Christian Kavel. Pastor Kavel was determined to help his loyal parishioners emigrate from Brandenburg, Posen and Silesia to escape religious persecution by King Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia. Pastor Kavel initially planned to move his parishioners to Russia near the Black Sea, where there were already numerous German settlements, but that had proved not to be feasible. Early in 1836, Kavel travelled to Hamburg to investigate possible emigration to America, but lack of available financial assistance caused this plan to collapse. While in Hamburg, Kavel heard of the wealthy philanthropist, George Fife Angas, who was Chairman of the South Australian Company and likely to assist the Old Lutherans with their migration plans. Kavel and a representative of his congregation travelled to London in March 1836 and met a very sympathetic George Fife Angas. Angas was a Baptist and was convinced that the Old Lutherans, who placed such high value on their religious beliefs, would make excellent settlers in the South Australian Colony. Angas persuaded the Directors of the South Australian Company to support him in chartering and fitting out the barque Sarah which was to proceed to Hamburg. Here, 370 Old Lutherans were to set sail for South Australia on 8 June 1836. However, Prussian authorities refused to grant the necessary passports until finally, after a distressing delay of nearly two years, the Prussian Government relented. Over the next six years, many ships brought Kavel's Old Lutheran parishioners to the South Australian Colony.  Ships  Some of the emigrant ships included: *The barque Bengalee departed Hamburg on 16 July 1838 and after a seven-day stop off at Kingscote (Kangaroo Island) arrived in Port Adelaide on 16 November 1838. On board were 33https://collections.slsa.sa.gov.au/resource/BRG+42/146/7/item passengers. *The passenger ship The Prince George departed Hamburg on 13 July 1838 and arrived in Port Adelaide on 18 November 1838. On board were 207 passengers including Pastor Kavel. *The passenger ship Zebra departed Altona on 28 August 1838 and arrived in Port Adelaide on 27 December 1838. On board were 191 passengers. A listing of the ship's cargo log also reveals that on board were 40,924 bricks presumably for the establishment of new dwellings. *The barque Cathrina departed Hamburg on 15 September 1838 and arrived in Port Adelaide on 20 January 1839. On board were 122 passengers. *The passenger ship Skjold departed Altona on 3 July 1841 and arrived in Port Adelaide on 27 October 1841. On board were 241 passengers. Official records show that the three-month journey claimed the lives of 41 people. *The passenger ship Taglione departed London on 20 June 1842 and arrived in Port Adelaide on 13 October 1842. An unknown number of passengers were on board. *The passenger ship George Washington departed Hamburg on 23 May 1844 and arrived in Port Adelaide on 12 September 1844. On board were 184 passengers. *The schooner Joseph Albino departed London on 4 July 1845 and arrived in Port Adelaide on 8 December 1845. On board were 7 passengers.  Settlement  In March 1837 Colonel William Light completed surveying Kangaroo Island, Encounter Bay, Port Lincoln and the Adelaide Plains. Light eventually chose the Adelaide Plains as the most suitable location for the capital. The first groups of Old Lutheran emigrants arrived in Port Misery between October 1838 and January 1839. With the assistance of George Fife Angas, many attempted to integrate into the local community by becoming tradespeople and labourers. Due to the scarcity of work, the lack of English as their preferred language, and the prejudice from the already established British farmers, many Old Lutherans found settlement increasingly hard. In 1838, Klemzig was founded by these emigrants after George Fife Angas offered a section of land bordering the Torrens River, a few kilometres to the north-east of Adelaide.  Renaming  Due to anti-German sentiment during World War I, the name of Klemzig was changed, as were many other German place names in Australia at the time. In 1917 Klemzig was renamed Gaza, commemorating the British victory in the Third Battle of Gaza, in which Australian troops had a major role.Klemzig, first German, and Lutheran, settlement in South Australia Klemzig was re-instated as the suburb name with the enactment of the South Australia Nomenclature Act of 1935 on 12 December 1935,Nomenclature Act, 1935 but remnants of the name Gaza still exist with the local football clubhttp://www.gaza.com.au still bearing the name. During World War II the residents of Klemzig petitioned the Government of South Australia on a number of occasions to have the name Gaza re-instated but these requests were denied.State Records of South Australia, GRG 24/6, File 437/1935  Transport  Klemzig is currently serviced by several bus routes including 271 and 273 along North East Road and 281 on McLauchlan Road, and also includes a station of the O-Bahn Busway.

He is well known for his planning skills and administrative acumen. He was the master mind in developing the Alappuzha town. Early life Rajah ( Kesavadas was born Kesava Pillai in a Nair family at a small hamlet called Kunnathur village Southern Travancore, in Kanyakumari district on March17, 1745 in the erstwhile Kingdom of Travancore. In Royal Service When Tippu Sultan of Mysore attacked Travancore, Kesava Pillai was the commandant of the state army. Travancore army fought against the Mysore force under the leadership of Kesava Pillai and Tippu was forced to retreat. Recognizing his victory over the Mysore, the Karthika Thirunal Maharaja of Travancore appointed Kesava Pillai as Diwan of Travancore. He was glorified by the British Governor Mornington, by the title Raja in appreciation of his administrative talents. As Diwan, Raja Kesavadas was responsible for shifting the capital of Travancore from Padmanabhapuram to Thiruvananthapuram. Contributions ;Development of Alappuzha port His all time contribution is finding an ideal location and constructing a well planned port city at Alappuzha. He found Alappuzha as the most suitable, because of the geographical and oceanic reasons. He constructed two parallel canals for bringing goods to port and offered infrastructural facilities to merchants and traders from Surat, Mumbai and Kutch to start industrial enterprises, trading, and cargo centres. Alappuzha attained progress and became the financial nerve centre of Travancore during his time.A History of Trade & Commerce in Travancore, 1600-1805 by K. K. Kusuman The port was opened in 1762, mainly for the export of coir-matting and coir-yarn.

Killi and the Karamana rivers nearby were used to carry goods from different parts of Travancore state. Later Years His tenure of Diwan ended with demise of Dharma Raja Karthika Thirunal in 1798. Balarama Varma, his successor aged fourteen became the crown prince who was too young in the hands of Jayanthan Sankaran Nampoothiri. Raja Kesavadas was proclaimed as a traitor and kept under house arrest which helped Jayanthan Sankaran Nampoothiri to usurp the post of Diwan.

History Fort Holabird was located in the southeast corner of the city and northwest of the suburban developments of Dundalk, Maryland, in surrounding Baltimore County, fronting on Holabird Avenue between Broening Highway and Dundalk Avenue. From 1941 until the end of World War II (1939/1941-1945). The military installation grew to include approximately 350 acres and 286 buildings. After the Second World War, activities at Fort Holabird were curtailed and portions of the property were transferred from the Army. The largest land transfers occurred in the timeframe over three decades later following the Vietnam War (1961-1975), between 1977 and 1979, when 223 acres were transferred to the City of Baltimore. The City later developed the land in succeeding years into the Fort Holabird Industrial Park.Fort Holabird, Dundalk, Maryland Base Realignment and Closure Site (BRAC) Timeline *1918: Established as Camp Holabird on 96 acres of marsh near Colgate Creek.Gary Helton (2005).

It is one of the largest expanses of peatland in Europe, consisting of 117.79 square kilometres of Atlantic blanket bog. It is a unique habitat with a diverse flora and fauna. It was established as a national park on 1 November 1998. The area of the park is a candidate Special Area of Conservation (cSAC) as part of a site known as the Owenduff/Nephin Complex. It is also a Special Protection Area and part of the Natura 2000 network.CONSERVATION OF WILD BIRDS (OWENDUFF/NEPHIN COMPLEX SPA 004098)  Establishment of Ballycroy National Park  The European Union Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC), which was transposed into Irish law in 1997, lists certain habitats and species that the Irish Government was required to designate as SACs to ensure their protection. These habitats include blanket bogs. The bog at Ballycroy is especially important in this regard because it is one of the largest examples of a blanket bog habitat left in Western Europe. Ballycroy was established as a national park on 1 November 1998. It is managed under the State Property Act of 1954.  Features of Ballycroy National Park  Blanket bogs, cliffs and river habitats are found in the park. The blanket bog is one of the largest expanses of peatland left in Europe. Conservation of the bog is thus of international importance because of the niches it provides for various species, such as rare species of plants. The Owenduff River is also an important conservation area because it is the only river in Western Europe that still drains a relatively intact and extensive blanket bog system. It is also a very prolific salmon and sea trout river. The Owenduff area is an important roosting, feeding and breeding site for a number of migratory bird species, such as the Greenland white-fronted goose, that are protected by the European Union Birds Directive. Other rare species found in the park include the whooper swan, peregrine falcon and corncrake. A visitor centre for the park opened in 2009. The 700 square meter building overlooks the Atlantic Ocean in Ballycroy village. It opens daily throughout the summer tourist season.  Expansion: \\"Wild Nephin\\"  In 2017, 4,000 hectares of conifer forest and mountain controlled by Coillte was added to the 11,000 hectares of the adjoining Ballycroy National Park. The area is to be managed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and has been identified as having potential for rewilding. The area was originally an industrial forest, consisting of pine and spruce plantations, with logging roads throughout.

His son, Stanley Ferguson Legge, reached the rank of major general. Early life and career James Gordon Legge was born in Hackney, London, England, on 15 August 1863, the eldest of eight sons. The family migrated to Australia in 1878. He was educated at Cranleigh School in Surrey, England, and Sydney Grammar School. Legge graduated from the University of Sydney with a Bachelor of Arts in 1884, Master of Arts in 1887 and a Bachelor of Law in 1890. Legge taught at Sydney Boys High School from 1886 to 1890 when he stood down to practice law, being admitted to the bar in New South Wales on 6 March 1891. Legge was commissioned as a lieutenant into the 3rd New South Wales Infantry Regiment in 1885 but resigned the next year. In October 1887 he was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the 1st New South Wales Regiment. He was promoted to lieutenant in 1892. In 1894 he was commissioned as a captain in the New South Wales permanent force. He immediately departed for a tour of duty with the British Army in India, serving a month with the 5th Dragoon Guards and three months with the Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment. With the outbreak of the Boer War in 1899, Legge was appointed to command an infantry company, with Lieutenant William Holmes as one of his subalterns. The company left for South Africa in November 1899, and on arrival was incorporated in the Australian Regiment. Originally an infantry unit, this became mounted in February. Legge pushed for a separate identity for the New South Wales contingent, he succeeded and on 7 April 1900, the Australian Regiment was disbanded, and colonial regiments formed into a new mounted division under Lieutenant General Sir Ian Hamilton. Legge's company was incorporated into the 1st New South Wales Mounted Rifles. He saw action at Diamond Hill, Elands River, Vet River and Zand River. In December 1900, his company had completed its twelve-month tour and returned to Australia. Legge remained, serving as an intelligence officer. Legge was granted the rank of brevet major on his return to Australia. In 1904 he published a handbook on military law. Then on 1 September 1904, he was promoted to major and given the post of Deputy Assistant Adjutant General at Second Military District Headquarters in Sydney. In 1907, he began working with Colonel William Bridges at Army Headquarters in Melbourne. With the rank of temporary lieutenant colonel, Legge became Quartermaster General and a member of the Military Board in January 1909. He was promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant colonel on 17 December 1909, the military Board failure to endorse his promotion. When Field Marshal Lord Kitchener visited Australia in December 1909, Legge worked very closely with him. The Defence Scheme that became known as Kitchener's Defence Scheme was largely developed by Legge. From March 1910 to June 1911, Legge served as Director of Operations as well as Quartermaster General. In January 1912, Legge was designated Australian Representative on the Imperial General Staff in London. Legge sent information back to Australia regarding Japanese military capabilities. He observed the British Army, and was particularly impressed with the Royal Flying Corps, and helped speed up the arrangements for the establishment of an Australian Flying Corps. First World War On 1 May 1914, Legge was appointed Chief of the General Staff, with the rank of full colonel, but he did not sail for home until July 1914. By the time Legge reached Adelaide, war had broken out. With Bridges occupied in organising the Australian Imperial Force (AIF), Legge took over the organisation of the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force for service in New Guinea. When Bridges departed for overseas, Legge took over responsibility for the training of AIF reinforcements. When Bridges was fatally wounded by a Turkish sniper in Monash Valley in May 1915, Legge was the natural choice of the Australian government to succeed him as both commander of the 1st Division and of the AIF. The Australian field commanders, Colonels Harry Chauvel, James Whiteside McCay and John Monash, were disappointed at being passed over by an officer who was their junior, with no recent combat experience and protested to Generals William Birdwood and Hamilton. Prime Minister Andrew Fisher stood firm on Legge's appointment, attributing Legge's unpopularity to his rise over the heads of other officers through ability, and duly promoted Legge to major general on 22 June 1915. Legge reached Mudros on 24 June 1915, and began working on winning the respect of his new subordinates. He arranged for the colonels to be promoted to brigadier general in line with their British counterparts, with seniority back dated to their assumption of brigade command. Legge also fought suggestions by the British to place Australian officers junior to British officers of the same rank. At Birdwood's suggestion, Legge inspected the Australian Base in Egypt and cabled recommendations back to the Australian government in Melbourne. This upset Birdwood, who felt that such communications should go through him. Legge clashed with Birdwood over the plan for the August Offensive at Anzac Cove. Like his predecessor, Legge felt that the proposed assault on Lone Pine would be costly and most likely futile unless the high ground above it was first seized. Birdwood held that only an attack on a key position like Lone Pine would cause the Turks to divert troops from opposing the main effort. Events would prove both men correct. Birdwood seized on an opportunity to remove Legge from the scene when Brigadier General McCay, about to take command of the 2nd Division, which had begun forming in Egypt, broke his leg and was evacuated on 11 July 1915. Birdwood sent Legge to Egypt to take over the 2nd Division instead. On appointment to this post, Legge's command of the AIF lapsed. Legge had no illusions about how difficult getting the 2nd Division ready for action as soon as possible would be, for he knew that many crucial elements of the division were either non-existent or still in Australia. Finding experienced officers for his headquarters staff was no less difficult. Legge's work was still incomplete when Hamilton called the division forward in August for piecemeal commitment at Gallipoli. Legge travelled back to Gallipoli with the 6th Brigade. On 2 September 1915, some 60 km south of Lemnos, the transport HMT Southland was torpedoed by a German submarine. Legge won the admiration of many for the quiet and good humoured way he handled the situation, remaining on board with the last 400 men, who were eventually transferred to the hospital ship Neuralia. About 32 Australians died in the incident. The 2nd Division relieved the 1st in the line, enabling the veterans to be rested on Lemnos. From mid-October, Legge occasionally acted as corps commander whenever Major General Alexander Godley was absent. He became the first Australian to have temporary command of a corps. Legge embarked on a number of schemes to improve the defences at Anzac Cove, which some thought impractical and others thought showed signs of sheer genius. On 23 November 1915, Legge was evacuated to Egypt sick. In January 1916 Legge resumed command of the 2nd Division in Egypt. On 13 March 1916, the 2nd Division began to entrain for Alexandria on its long journey to the Western Front. On the night of 7 April 1916, the 2nd Division entered the line for the first time, in an area known as \\"nursery\\" sector near Armenti√®res. A quiet section of the line, this sector was used by both sides to acclimatise new units to conditions on the Western Front. The division soon became caught up in raids, and casualties were high because of Birdwood's insistence on manning the front line more densely than recommended. Moving into the line at Pozi√®res on 27 July 1916, the commander of the British Reserve Army, General Sir Hubert Gough, ordered Legge to take the Pozi√®res Heights at once. The attack, delivered on 28‚Äì29 July, was a complete failure due to poor preparation, and cost the division some 3,500 casualties. Legge took the majority of the blame for the failure. In the next few days, Legge strove to get another attack ready, all the while under tremendous pressure from the enemy, who shelled the 2nd Division's positions nonstop, compelling postponement first to the 2nd and then to 4 August. Gough and General Sir Douglas Haig were both displeased with the postponements, which they blamed on Legge. When the attack was finally delivered, it was a complete success, and the Pozi√®res Heights were under Australian control. Its twelve-day tour at Pozi√®res cost the 2nd Division 6,848 men, almost a third of its strength. On 28 January 1917, Legge fell ill again with the flu and Birdwood took the opportunity to relieve him of his command. When he recovered, he returned to Australia where he was appointed Inspector General on 30 April 1917. On 1 August 1917, he became Chief of the General Staff again, reverting to his permanent rank of colonel, but retaining the rank of major general as an honorary rank. As Chief of the General Staff, Legge's role was dealing with politicians in Australia, and providing reinforcements for the AIF overseas. Post war In 1918, Legge began considering the problem of how to defend Australia against the Japanese if the Allies lost the war. In considering the makeup of the postwar forces, Legge became a strong advocate of an independent Royal Australian Air Force and a major role for air power, and he was appointed to a committee to look into the matter in January 1919. In January 1920, Legge was appointed to a committee chaired by Harry Chauvel to examine the future structure of the army. On 2 January 1920, Legge was substantially promoted to major general. On 1 June 1920 he became Commandant of the Royal Military College, Duntroon. In the defence cuts of 1922, Legge, along with most of his staff, was retrenched. He was placed on the unattached list on 1 August 1922, and on the retired list on 14 January 1924, with the honorary rank of lieutenant general. In February 1924 he was awarded the L√©gion d'honneur. Cranleigh Remnants of Cranleigh House, 2012 Cranleigh School Relief in bronze and plaque, at Cranleigh site Due to his early retirement, Legge was denied a pension, but he was able to obtain money from the Soldier Settlement Scheme to buy a lease on a farm north of the Weetangera farm in the Australian Capital Territory. He called it \\"Cranleigh\\" after his school in England and his former home in Sydney, and he raised pigs and horses, and grew potatoes. Many of the local farmers thought him eccentric, as the area is best known as sheep country. The farm failed for various reasons, including that a proposed Canberra-Yass railway line passing the farm was not built; and, there was a drought from 1937‚Äì37. By 1923 cottages for a manager and workmen were being built at Cranleigh, farm machinery including a tractor had been purchased and a concrete weir across the Ginninderra Creek was under construction. The main house was styled from houses he had seen in India early in his military career. In its external appearance the house was square with a flat roof resembling a fort or block house, built of concrete blocks moulded on site with sand from Ginninderra Creek. There was a central verandah courtyard surrounded by ten rooms with each room having an entrance to the courtyard. Death Legge died at Oakleigh, Victoria on 18 September 1947 and was buried at Cheltenham Cemetery. In accordance with his wishes, no monument or headstone marks his grave. His wife had died a little more than two weeks earlier in Sydney, where she was being cared for by family. She had left the farm about three years earlier due to ill health. Legacy In 2011, the site of Legge's house and \\"Cranleigh Farm\\" (), of which neither have left appreciable signs, in Latham, ACT at the corner of Kingsford Smith Drive and Southern Cross Drive, was considered for listing under the Heritage Act 2004 by the ACT Heritage Council, and rejected on all grounds. The decisionHeritage (Decision about Provisional Registration of the site of General Legge's House, Cranleigh, Latham) Notice 2011 , Government of the Australian Capital Territory, 20 October 2011, accessed 25 July 2012 contains a detailed account of the life of Legge and his reasons for remaining in the Australian Capital Territory in his retirement. The location of the farm remains an open space within Latham. The farm is commemorated by the Cranleigh School, that provides educational programs for children in the age range 3‚Äì12 with intellectual impairments, sited about 200m west of the farm site in Starke Street, Holt.

Wickens, A History of the Brain: From Stone Age Surgery to Modern Neuroscience, Psychology Press (2014), p. 226 born in Berlin. He studied medicine at the Universities of Berlin and W√ºrzburg under the instruction of famous men such as Emil Du Bois-Reymond (1818‚Äì1896), Rudolf Virchow (1821‚Äì1902), Moritz Heinrich Romberg (1795‚Äì1873), and Karl Friedrich Otto Westphal (1833‚Äì1890). He received his doctorate in 1862 and subsequently worked in Berlin and W√ºrzburg. In 1875, he became director of the Burgh√∂lzli asylum, as well as professor of psychiatry at the University of Zurich. In 1885, Hitzig became a professor at the University of Halle where he remained until his retirement in 1903. Hitzig is remembered for his work concerning the interaction between electric current and the brain. In 1870, Hitzig, assisted by anatomist Gustav Fritsch (1837‚Äì1927), applied electricity via a thin probe to the exposed cerebral cortex of a dog without anesthesia. They performed these studies at the home of Fritsch because the University of Berlin would not allow such experimentation in their laboratories. What Hitzig and Fritsch had discovered is that electrical stimulation of different areas of the cerebrum caused involuntary muscular contractions of specific parts of the dog's body. They identified the brain's \\"motor strip\\", a vertical strip of brain tissue on the cerebrum in the back of the frontal lobe, which controls different muscles in the body. In 1870, Hitzig published his findings in an essay called Ueber die elektrische Erregbarkeit des Grosshirns (On the Electrical Excitability of the Cerebrum). This experimentation was considered the first time anyone had done any localized study regarding the brain and electric current. However this was not the first time Hitzig had experienced the interaction between the brain and electricity; earlier in his career as a physician working with the Prussian Army, he experimented on wounded soldiers whose skulls were fractured by bullets. Hitzig noticed that applying a small electric current to the brains of these soldiers caused involuntary muscular movement. Hitzig and Fritsch's work opened the door to further localized testing of the brain by many others including Scottish neurologist, David Ferrier.

Typically, the act itself (whether consensual or not) used to be a crime, but the term is now used to describe forcible or otherwise involuntary acts that differ from the crime of rape (sometimes deviant sexual intercourse is included in the definition of rape), in the way that indecent assault might be used in other states and countries. In the United States, the term has replaced sodomy in the criminal codes of some states, including Texas and Kentucky.

The day commemorates the 1956 march of approximately 20,000 women to the Union Buildings in Pretoria to petition against the country's pass laws that required South Africans defined as \\"black\\" under The Population Registration Act to carry an internal passport, known as a pass, that served to maintain population segregation, control urbanisation, and manage migrant labour during the apartheid era. The first National Women's Day was celebrated on 9 August 1995. In 2006, a reenactment of the march was staged for its 50th anniversary, with many of the 1956 march veterans. 1956 Women's March On 9 August 1956, more than 20,000 South African women of all races staged a march on the Union Buildings in protest against the proposed amendments to the Urban Areas Act of 1950, commonly referred to as the \\"pass laws\\". The march was led by Lillian Ngoyi, Helen Joseph, Rahima Moosa and Sophia Williams. Other participants included Frances Baard, a statue of whom was unveiled by Northern Cape Premier Hazel Jenkins in Kimberley (Frances Baard District Municipality) on National Women's Day 2009.\\"MaBaard gets a special place\\", Diamond Fields Advertiser 11 August 2009 p 3 The women left 14,000 petitions at the office doors of prime minister J. G. Strijdom. The women stood silently for 30 minutes and then started singing a protest song that was composed in honour of the occasion: Wathint'Abafazi Wathint'imbokodo! (Now you have touched the women, you have struck a rock.). In the years since, the phrase (or its latest incarnation: \\"you strike a woman, you strike a rock\\") has come to represent women's courage and strength in South Africa. Significance National Women's Day draws attention to significant issues African women still face, such as parenting, domestic violence, sexual harassment in the workplace, pornography, unequal pay, and schooling for all girls. It can be used as a day to fight for or protest these ideas. Due to this public holiday, there have been many significant advances. Before 1994, women had low representation in the Parliament, only at 2.7%. Women in the national assembly were at 27.7%. This number has nearly doubled, being at 48% representation throughout the country's government. National Women's Day is based around much of the same principles as International Women's Day, and strives for much of the same freedoms and rights.

The film is widely listed as dating from 1938 (IMDb, AllMovie, YouTube etc.), but the copyright date on the print of the film shown by Turner Classic Movies on January 12, 2014, and also the ones available on YouTube and the Internet Archive is \\"MCMXLIII\\" (1943). Despite this, lists it as 1941. American film directed by Harry Revier and produced by Raymond L. Friedgen. The film was promoted as educational and as an attempt to draw attention to the lack of laws banning child marriage in many states. The film is set in a remote town in the Ozarks. It was very controversial at the time‚Äîboth for its theme and because of a topless and nude swimming scene by then-12-year-old Shirley Mills. The film bypassed the ban of onscreen nudity under the Hays Code by being produced and distributed independently of the studio system, and by claiming to be educational. Although the film was banned in many areas, the movie's controversial nature gave it a certain infamy and it played on the so-called exploitation circuit for many years. The film was one of director Revier's last. He had previously made a series of low-budget, independent movies including The Lost City series and Lash of the Penitentes. According to an interview with Michael J. Nelson and Kevin Murphy of Mystery Science Theater 3000 fame, this movie was screened for the show, but it was considered too awful and disturbing by the crew, with Murphy saying that he needed \\"a good cry and a shower\\" after the film. In a separate interview with Frank Conniff, who selected films for the show, he cited it as the worst film he had watched as a potential selection for the show - alongside Manos: The Hands of Fate, which was screened on the show in January 1993. Plot Miss Carol (Diana Durrell) is an idealistic teacher in a remote one-room schoolhouse. A native of the Ozarks herself, she is determined to stop the practice of child marriage, in which older men marry teen or preteen girls. Her campaign raises the ire of some local men, led by Jake Bolby (Warner Richmond), who one night drag her into the woods and tie her to a tree, with the intention of tarring and feathering her. Before they can do this, however, Angelo the dwarf (Angelo Rossitto) and Mr. Colton (George Humphreys) arrive with a shotgun to save the day. Following this, Jake Bolby comes across young Jennie Colton (Shirley Mills) swimming naked. When her father dies, Bolby decides to take advantage of the opportunity to blackmail her mother into letting him marry the girl, threatening that otherwise he will see her hanged for murder. After he \\"courts\\" Jennie by giving her a doll, the two are married. It later turns out that this ceremony was illegal, as child marriage had been banned several days prior, but this point quickly becomes moot. Before Bolby can consummate the union, he is gunned down by Angelo. Jennie leaves his house with Freddie Nulty (Bob Bollinger).

She would go on to appear in many films over the next decade, mostly in supporting roles. She quit acting in her twenties to become a singer. * This was Bob Bollinger's only film role. According to Mills' website, now offline, the two young actors became friends, and Bollinger later asked her to marry him, which she declined. His ultimate fate is unknown. * Angelo Rossitto had a long career in movies, stretching from the 1920s to the 1990s, usually in less heroic roles than in this film. He is perhaps best known for his role as Master in Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome (1985). The reason he was billed as \\"Don Barrett\\" in this film is unknown. * Along with Mills and Rossitto, Warner Richmond was one of the few actors involved in this film who had any sort of film career. He appeared in over 140 films between 1912 and 1946, including the Gene Autry serial The Phantom Empire (1935). The nude swim scene Child Bride (full film) The movie is perhaps best known for the topless and lengthy nude swimming scene by 12-year-old Jennie, which begins with Jennie and Freddie, her closest friend, sneaking slyly to a secluded pond in the woods, where they had swum naked many times in the past. Freddie tells Jennie that he will \\"beat [her] undressed,\\" but Jennie tells him that they can no longer swim naked together. Freddie asks her why, and Jennie replies \\"because we're not what we used to be\\" because she is now grown up. She repeats what she has been told by her teacher, Miss Carol. Freddie asks how they are different, pointing out that he had seen her many times in the nude, and Jennie turns to answer him, briefly exposing her breasts and nipples to the camera. The film then cuts to a lengthy long shot showing Jennie and Freddie, both topless and separated by a stand of trees, as they discuss how these changes will affect their relationship. Freddie asks if he can still kiss Jennie; she replies that he can but only when she is wearing her clothes. Jennie then removes her dress entirely, runs naked through the woods and dives into the water. The next two minutes consist of shots of Jennie swimming nude and frolicking with her dog. Jake Bolby appears on a ridge above the pond, and watches the naked girl. An old woman sees what Bolby is doing, and says to him, \\"Purty, ain't she?\\" Freddie hears this and alerts Jennie to the fact that someone is watching her, and she swims for cover. She asks Freddie to bring her clothes to her, without looking at her. He uses a long stick to pass her the dress. She pulls the dress on, unseen to the camera, and climbs out of the water. Some prints and screenings of the film have cut out the topless scene, leaving only the long shot nude swim sequence. Production Child Bride was the first film produced by noted exploitation film producer and promoter Kroger Babb, who marketed it as an educational film and who would reissue it under various titles, including Child Brides, Child Bride of the Ozarks and Dust to Dust. The movie is perhaps best known for the lengthy nude child swimming scene, which Allmovie described as \\"completely gratuitous\\" and \\"obviously Child Bride's main selling point and the reason for its longevity on the exploitation circuit.\\" The film had been submitted to the Production Code Administration for a certificate of approval, but was denied because of its subject matter, which was said to be \\"a sexually abhorrent abnormality which violates all moral principles,\\" and because of the onscreen child nudity. The censors also objected to the murderer never being punished for his deeds. The production of the film in 1938 followed shortly after mass media coverage of the 1937 marriage of 9-year-old Eunice Winstead to Charlie Johns, causing the film to be compared to it. Home media Alpha Video's DVD release presents the film in its uncensored form, while Mill Creek Entertainment included a censored version of the film in its 20 Movie Pack Cult Classics collection. The film is now in the public domain.

It is endemic to the Talamancan montane forests of Costa Rica and western Panama. This large, dark pewee is found between 1250 m and 2150 m altitude in wet mountain forests, especially at the edges and in clearings, and in adjacent semi-open areas with tall trees. The nest is a broad, thick-walled saucer of mosses and lichens, lined with plant fibres. It is placed 5‚Äì18 m high across a branch. The eggs are undescribed, but the female builds the nest, lays only two eggs and incubates the eggs for 15‚Äì16 days before they hatch. The dark pewee is 26.5 cm long and weighs 23 g. The upperparts are sooty-grey, darkest on the prominently crested crown. The wings and tail are blackish, the wings having grey feather edges and a weak wing bar. The throat is pale grey, with most of the rest of the underparts a paler olive-grey than the back, becoming yellowish on the lower belly. Sexes are similar, but young birds are browner above and have rufous fringes to the wing feathers. The dark pewee is solitary when not breeding. It perches on a high watchpoint from which it sallies forth to catch flying insects, returning to the same exposed perch. This is a conspicuous species, with an incessant loud whip call, and repetitive fred-reek-fear song. It will defend the nest aggressively against larger species, including the emerald toucanet.
