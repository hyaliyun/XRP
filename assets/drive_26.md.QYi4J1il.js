Shamrock Park where Casey resided and the scene of his killing Casey, a Catholic, first joined the IRA in 1985. Like some of his colleagues, his membership was clandestine. In October 1988 Casey's home in Shamrock Park outside Rasharkin (Ros Earc√°in) was raided by the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). While there they removed a legally held shotgun and drew maps of the interior of the house. Casey was charged with possession of explosives, and was taken away to Castlereagh holding centre, where he was supposedly tortured for information on his fellow volunteers in the IRA. Security forces at the time assured Mr Casey that he would either end up in a cell or a coffin as he once stated to various media outlets. Due to his unbreakable will no information was ever given to the security forces. This ultimately assured his death. Although never proven most if not all parties agree State sponsored collusion took place between loyalist paramilitaries and the security forces.\\"Volunteer Gerard Casey remembered in Rasharkin\\" An Phoblacht 9 April 2009 Retrieved 24 October 2012 On 4 April 1989, two members of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA, a loyalist paramilitary group), wearing balaclavas and green army jackets, burst into his house and shot him with a shotgun and a pistol from close range as he slept. Only Casey was killed in the attack; his wife, who was beside him in the bed, and three children were not harmed.David McKittrick et al, Lost Lives, Mainstream Publishing, 2008, p. 1168 The funeral was attended by a crowd of up to 500 mourners despite a huge police presence of around 200 officers. A minor altercation between police and mourners occurred. Neighbours described him as \\"a quiet family man with no interest in any political activities\\". Even though his membership was relatively unknown, Casey still remains to this day the most prominent republican to come out of North Antrim. And even Democratic Unionist Party leader Ian Paisley condemned the killing as \\"a diabolical crime showing devilish viciousness\\" such was the lack of knowledge about Casey's IRA membership. The Conflict Archive on the Internet states that Casey was killed by the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), in disagreement with other sources.Sutton Index of Deaths 1989 The fact that Casey's IRA membership had not been well-known led to the suggestions that the security forces had passed on information about his membership to the loyalists. Casey's relatives maintained that there was RUC collusion with those who killed Casey, and no-one has been charged with his murder. Casey said before his death that his life had been threatened by the RUC.

In 1977, she was sold to Taiwan and was renamed ROCS Da Hu (ARS-552). U.S. Navy (1943-1977) Grapple (ARS-7) was launched by Basalt Rock Company in Napa, California, 31 December 1942; sponsored by Mrs. Thomas D. Rose; and commissioned 16 December 1943 at Vallejo, California, Lt. Robert Fisher in command. = World War II = One of the first ships designed to operate as a combat-salvage vessel, Grapple conducted shakedown off the California coast until 15 February 1944 when she sailed for Pearl Harbor with barge YW-69 in tow. With three barges in tow, she departed Pearl 21 March 1944, proceeded via Majuro and Tarawa to Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides, Florida Island, and Guadalcanal. There Grapple performed miscellaneous screening exercises and readied for her part in the upcoming invasion of Guam, another step in America's sweep to victory across the Pacific. On 15 June she came under enemy attack for the first time as three Japanese dive bombers came out of the sun in a surprise attack. Alert antiaircraft crews shot down one of them and seriously damaged another. Grapple cleared Kwajalein, staging area for the Guam assault, on 15 July, then 6 days later was standing off Guam in support of the first wave of assault troops. Her vital salvage work at Guam included pulling stranded landing craft off the beaches and repairing damaged ships, usually within range of enemy fire. Demolition crews from Grapple, also performed the important work of clearing the Apra Harbor entrance of a Japanese freighter sunk by American bombers. After the consolidation of Guam, Grapple returned to Espiritu Santo via Eniwetok for repairs and preparation for next major assault. Rendezvousing with a convoy at Florida Island, Grapple sailed 4 September for the initial assault phase on Peleliu Island, Palaus, which began 15 September. Under constant fire from enemy shore batteries, she laid small-craft mooring buoys inside Peleliu's protective reef before being dispatched to aid (DD-689), badly damaged in a mine field. While working on the disabled destroyer, a project which lasted over 2 weeks, Grapple also assisted a number of beached landing craft and effected temporary repairs on others. On 24 December Grapple entered Leyte Gulf, late the scene of one of the war's bloodiest and most decisive naval battles, for further salvage work. Four days later she sailed into Mindanao Gulf to salvage SS William Sharon, an abandoned Liberty ship still smoldering from kamikaze attacks. The salvage ship, with Sharon in tow, and her two destroyer escorts were attacked by Japanese fighter planes in the pre-dawn hours of 30 December, but the planes were driven off. From Leyte Grapple headed north as the invasion of the Philippines unfolded deep into enemy held territory at Lingayen Gulf, again in the initial assault phase. Brilliant salvage work at Lingayen Gulf from 6 January to 26 February 1945 earned Grapple and her crew the Navy Unit Citation. She remained on fire-fighting, rescue, and salvage station at Ulithi and Saipan through 7 May, distinguishing herself in fire-fighting efforts on the carrier (CV-15), hit by kamikazes on 11 March. After towing a derrick and a lighter to Leyte, Grapple sailed for Pearl Harbor. On 6 June she was diverted to assist SS William Hawkins, adrift near Johnston Island; taking the merchantman in tow, she reached Hawaii 11 June, stopping only long enough to disengage her tow before continuing to Portland, Oregon, where she docked 22 June. Japan surrendered before Grapple reached Hawaii again on 19 October. There she performed various duties until returning to the coast. She reached San Diego, California, 15 May, decommissioned there 30 August 1946 and went in reserve. = Korean War = With the outbreak of the Korean War, Grapple re- commissioned 26 December 1951 at San Diego, Lt. Roy Coniam in command. After training exercises, she sailed to Pearl Harbor and from there to Japan, reaching Sasebo 8 May 1952. Five days later she sailed for Korea and joined British units of the United Nations Fleet off Daido Ko 17 May. Later she sailed to Ullong Do and was temporarily converted into a floating laboratory as Navy doctors frantically tried to stem a typhoid epidemic sweeping the peninsula. On 8 August Grapple began \\"flycatcher\\" duty off the Korean coast, patrolling at night to thwart enemy sampans laying mines in the shallows. While at anchor near Wonsan 12 August, Grapple came under heavy fire from shore batteries, and before she could clear the area was hit just below the water line. Her damage control party removed the unexploded projectile and patched up the 6\\" by 15\\" hole. Three days later, still on patrol. Grapple received more serious injuries‚Äîthis time at the hands of a friend. Because of a mistake in Identification signals, (AM-315) opened fire on Grapple at a range of about 900 yards. Several shells fell short or exploded above the ship, but one 3\\" projectile hit just above the pilot house, killing 2 men, injuring 11 others, 3 critically, and doing extensive damage to pilot house and gun deck. After repairs at Sasebo, Grapple returned to Korea, making three more \\"flycatcher\\" patrols to protect U.S. ships operating off shore before returning to Pearl Harbor 9 December 1952. She then sailed for overhaul at Seattle, Washington. = Cold War = Subsequently, Grapple was based at Pearl Harbor, performing a variety of salvage duties in the mid-Pacific and other areas. In 1953, 1955, 1956, and 1957, late summer Arctic supply cruises took her through Aleutian waters and into the hazardous ice floes of the Arctic Circle to repair and supply units of the fleet stationed there. In nine Western Pacific cruises to date, Grapple has crossed the Pacific to Korea, Japan, Formosa, the Philippines, South Vietnam, and Hong Kong. On these, Grapple extensively trained ROK and Nationalist Chinese divers in newest salvage techniques. Extraordinary duties for Grapple included blasting the coral reef to widen the harbor entrance at Johnston Island in April 1954 prior to nuclear testing. In addition while prepared to act during a flare-up in the Quemoy-Matsu area in August and September 1958, she assisted Hilo, Hawaii, in mopping up after a devastating tsunami May 1960. During July and August 1965 she participated in the successful salvage operation of freeing (DDR-742), grounded on Pratas Reef in the South China Sea. = Vietnam War = Departing Pearl Harbor 16 November 1966, Grapple reached waters off South Vietnam 10 December for salvage and rescue operations. Late in the month she prepared to salvage a grounded tug from a reef north of Hu·∫ø, South Vietnam. Grapple was still on station in the Pacific, providing valuable salvage and rescue work for planes and ships as well as participating in a variety of miscellaneous duties and exercises.  Republic of China Navy (1977-)  Grapple was decommissioned (date unknown) and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 December 1977. She was then sold to Taiwan under the Security Assistance Program, 1 December 1977, and renamed ROCS Da Hu (ARS-552) where she currently serves in active service.

It is located halfway down Park Road (formerly the east end of 7th Avenue) at Opelika Municipal Park, which is off North 5th Street in the city of Opelika. Coordinates are (32.659294, -85.381372). Originally built in 1900, the 43-foot (13-meter) bridge is a Town Lattice truss construction over a single span. Its WGCB number is 01-41-B, formerly 01-41-04. The bridge was listed on the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage on January 25, 1977. It was destroyed by a fallen tree in 2005 at its original location near Salem, then rebuilt in 2007 at Opelika Municipal Park. The bridge is maintained by the Opelika Kiwanis Club and the City of Opelika. History The Salem-Shotwell Covered Bridge was first built by Otto Puls, originally located over Wacoochee Creek on what is now Shotwell Road (CR 252) just north of the community of Salem (Coordinates (32.609747, -85.208425)). This was about 10 miles (16 kilometers) east of its current location. At that time, the bridge was 76 feet (23 m) in length...constructed using longleaf heart pine, cedar roof shakes and hand-hewn white oak pegs which joined the latticework, roof trusses and substructure. The bridge shortened the travel time between the communities of Salem and Shotwell. Occasional repairs were made over the years, along with a restoration of the bridge by the Lee County Commission in 1973, but high water and erosion from various storms had once again taken a toll on the bridge supports. Eventually, the Salem-Shotwell Covered Bridge was closed to motor traffic in 1994 and left to survive the elements. The Salem-Shotwell Covered Bridge in Salem, Alabama as it appeared in 2003 In the early morning hours of June 4, 2005, a severe thunderstorm passed through the Lee County area. High winds caused a tree to fall on the Salem-Shotwell Covered Bridge, causing major damage. The added weight collapsed the bridge into Wacoochee Creek later that day. Being the only historic covered bridge remaining in southeastern Alabama, the loss was heartbreaking. Most of the pieces were able to be recovered over the next few weeks and were stored at a vacant commercial building in Opelika until plans could be made regarding the future of the bridge. After months of negotiations, the Lee County Commission approved to transfer ownership of what remained of the Salem-Shotwell Covered Bridge to the City of Opelika during a meeting held on October 31, 2005. An agreement was reached by the Lee County Historical Society and the Opelika Kiwanis Club to reconstruct the bridge over Rocky Brook at Opelika Municipal Park. A resolution was unanimously passed on April 4, 2006 by the Opelika City Council to assist with the bridge relocation and renovations. The project was spearheaded by the Opelika Kiwanis Club, who had already begun a donation drive to raise funds needed in order to proceed with the move. A number of individuals, businesses and organizations donated money for the greatly valued cause. Reconstruction of Salem-Shotwell Covered Bridge eventually began on February 2, 2007 over a section of Rocky Brook which had already been cleared, graded and landscaped for foundation settlement. Due to the amount of usable original materials and in order to fit the new span, the bridge was shortened from 76 feet to 43 feet in length. The Town Lattice truss setup was kept, using many of the pieces which were recovered from Wacoochee Creek. A change was made to the exterior wooden sides covering the lattices, now just draping the bottom section so park visitors can view the brook and other surroundings from inside the bridge. On the original construction, in order to prevent damage from high water, most of the lattices were covered and only the top sections exposed for light. Two lights have been placed inside the bridge for nighttime illumination. The reconstruction project and final landscaping took about six months to complete at a cost of roughly $60,000. On August 14, 2007, a ribbon-cutting ceremony was held at Opelika Municipal Park to re-open the Salem-Shotwell Covered Bridge to the public. A piece of history once again stands in Lee County. Current photos of the bridge as well as its reconstruction can be viewed on the Opelika Kiwanis Club website (linked below). Covered Bridge Hauntings During its time over Wacoochee Creek, the Salem-Shotwell Covered Bridge was said to have been haunted by children who were killed in a motor vehicle accident near the bridge a number of years ago. Many locals state though that no such incident ever happened. There was a girl who was strangled on the bridge, confirmed by local police officers who had worked the crime scene.

History of the Serbian army =Medieval Serbian army= The Serbian army during this period was primarily consisted of light cavalry and infantry force armed with spear, javelin or bows. With the increasing wealth from mining, mercenary knights were recruited to complement noble cavalry armed with bow and lance. This enabled the Serbs to fight effectively outwith their mountain strongholds. The core of the army consisted of noble cavalry (vlastela) armed with lance and bow in the Byzantine style in early medieval time. These were increasingly supplemented by western style knights. Mostly Germans in Du≈°an's reign. Du≈°an's military tactics consisted of wedge shaped heavy cavalry attacks with horse archers on the flanks. Many foreign mercenaries were in the Serbian army, mostly Germans as cavalry and Spaniards as infantry. He also had personal mercenary guards, mainly German knights. A knight named Palman was the commander of this unit and was the leader of all German mercenaries. Light horses were provided by Hungarian and Cuman mercenaries. Later in the period Serbian lance armed Hussars took over this role. The infantry still included lightly armed javelin troops although the bow and crossbow became the most important infantry weapon in the 14th century. A western style charge by the armoured cavalry and knights was the main tactic with the infantry used to follow up. In the Battle of Velbazhd in 1330, Du≈°an was also successful against Louis' vassals: he defeated the armies of the Croatian ban and the forces of Hungarian voivodes. Bulgaria became a Serbian vassal in 1331, a situation that lasted until 1365.Churches of Eastern Cheristendom The Serbs expanded their state to the south conquering most of Macedonia, Epirus and Thessaly from the Byzantine Empire which was in the midst of a disastrous civil war. Without major field battles, the Serbian tactic was based on seizing towns by siege. In 1346 Stephen Du≈°an was proclaimed Emperor. Hoswever, his empire began to fall apart after his death in 1355 due to rivalry among the nobility and the lack of consolidation of the newly conquered territories. In 1371 a Serbian army led by Vuka≈°in advanced on Adrianople only to be surprised in a dawn attack by an inferior Ottoman force commanded by Lala ≈ûahin. The Serbian leaders were killed and Serbian lands were grabbed by various independent nobles as well as the Ottomans. A decade later, Serbs defeated Ottomans in Battle of Ploƒçnik in 1386. As the Battle of Kosovo in 1389 is generally considered as temporarily the end of the medieval Serbian state until 1402. Despotovina, the successor of the Serbian Empire and the state of Prince Lazar survived for 70 more years, experiencing a cultural and political renaissance in the first half of the 15th century before it was conquered by the Ottomans in 1459. Ragusan historian Mavro Orbin recorded that prince Lazar used cannons as early as 1373 in his war against Nikola Altamanovich in northern Serbia.Serb World volumes 5-6, page 10 The state was led by despot Stefan Lazareviƒá and his successors from the Brankoviƒá dynasty. Despot Stefan has armed his knights with light firearms (musket \\"Fitiljaƒça\\"),also with spears, swords, daggers, maces, bow and arrows, crossbows, shields, armours, halberd and cannons. He also introduced Europe style knight tournaments. Even then, Serbian state continued to last in the Hungarian exile until the mid 16th century and the autonomous Serbian principality fell only in 1540.

On that day, on Palm Sunday, in Takovo in 1815, prominent elders met and reached a decision to start the Second Serbian Uprising for the liberation of Serbia from the Turkish authorities. The Second Serbian uprising resulted in a positive starting point in the long run. Initially it was a military operation of the Serbian history, but in the later period ensued political and diplomatic activities, which led to the Serbia being freed from supreme Turkish authorities and the Second Serbian Uprising in some ways is the foundation for the creation of the Serbian government and Serbian armed forces. As a product, and independence was followed by the creation of the standing army and the establishment of the Guard which consisted of 76 men who were selected \\"in stature and reputation of\\" from finest families in Serbia. Since the creation of a standing army, the first \\"conscripts\\" and later \\"soldats\\", went unnoticed by the Porte, the National Assembly made the name \\"Soldat\\" official. This is when first recruits were introduced, who remained in the army for ten years, bearing in mind that their service period was not determined. A standing army was living in the barracks and receiving salary. They received uniforms.\\" These first Serbian regular army formations were modeled after the Austrian army, which confirms that both at that time the experience of foreign armies were invaluable in creating our army. Second Serbian Uprising was precisely the combination of events led by faith in the liberation of Serbia using existing military assets and military organization, which led to the final liberation and recognition of modern Serbia as a state with full international legality and recognized by the powers at Berlin congress in 1878.Day of the Serbian Armed Forces Gallery File:Weapons of Duklja, Zeta and Ra≈°ka.jpgEarly medieval weapons from Duklja (Zeta) and inner Serbia File:Serbian medieval army equipment.jpgSerbian medieval army equipment File:Muskets_\\"Fitiljaƒça\\".jpgMusket \\"Fitiljaƒça\\" (named after the Slow match used to ignite the gunpowder) used by Serbian Army in the 15th century.

It is located on John F. Kennedy Street in Harvard Square. The Fox Club is not affiliated with Harvard University. History The Fox Club was founded in 1898 by a group of six undergraduate students. Originally known as the Digamma Club, the name Fox and the Club‚Äôs symbol, a fox carrying the letter \\"F\\", grew from the similarity between the letter \\"F\\" and the archaic Greek character for \\"Digamma\\", which primarily signifies the number 6. The clubhouse has three floors that serve both the undergraduate and alumni membership, as well as an underground level where club members may invite guests. The clubhouse was built in 1906 and designed by Guy Lowell, a prominent American architect who also designed the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and the New York State Supreme Court Building. The building is located on 44 John F. Kennedy Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and is a city historic landmark or otherwise protected property. All-male status Harvard upholds sanctions against members of single-gender final clubs, preventing those people from holding student group leadership positions, serving as varsity athletic team captains, and from having fellowships endorsed by the college. In 2015, the Fox Club was one of the first of Harvard's final clubs to admit women, but only on a provisional basis by the club's undergraduate board. In an August 2015 vote by the club's undergraduate members, nine women were given provisional membership. This vote was reportedly taken without input from the club's graduate members. After the women were admitted, a rift developed between undergraduate members and alum members, leading the graduate board to lock undergraduates out of the club's house through the second half of the fall semester. The nine women's provisional member status expired upon their graduation in June 2017. By July 2017 the club had reverted to an all-male membership. On September 7th, 2018, the club was included in a public list of Harvard social organizations that had pledged to become gender-inclusive and thereby had been recognized by the College, exempting them from Harvard's sanctions. Two weeks later, however, the club was removed from Harvard's online list of recognized social organizations as Harvard was unable to provide consistent guidelines for remaining a recognized social organization. At this time, the club would again be subject to the College's sanctions policy. In May 2019, The Harvard Crimson reported that a vote of all Fox Club graduate members had failed to reach the two-thirds affirmative majority necessary to change membership policies and allow women to join. This decision came in spite of two successive undergraduate votes which strongly favored admitting members regardless of gender.https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/5/15/fox-club-vote-all-male/ To date, the club remains all-male and is no longer subject to sanctions after Harvard rescinded its policy acknowledging that it violated federal law.https://www.harvard.edu/president/news/2020/policy-on-unrecognized-single- gender-social-organizations  Notable members  * T.S.

The G3MX was expected to be available on AMD 800S series chipset for server market starting from 2009, but was officially cancelled together with the cancellation of Socket G3 in early 2008. PC Watch report, retrieved August 20, 2008 Electrical limitations preclude connecting more than 2 unbuffered DDR SDRAM DIMMs or 4 buffered DIMMs to a single shared bus. It is also impractical to manufacture a single chip with more than two DDR memory buses (channels). Thus, it is impossible to connect more than 8 DIMMs to a single chip. This is typically the per-processor limitation as well. The obvious solution is to use a narrower, higher-speed bus to interface to memory, and to implement it as a point-to-point link, daisy-chaining additional modules. However, Intel have made two attempts at this, neither hugely successful: * RDRAM implements the bus on a DRAM chip. However, the high-speed circuitry increased power consumption, and the daisy-chaining caused significantly higher memory latency. Because it is difficult to implement high-speed circuitry on the same semiconductor process, costs were high. * FB-DIMMs add a separate memory controller chip to each memory DIMM. This \\"advanced memory buffer\\" (also known by the abbreviation AMB) provides the necessary high-speed circuitry. However, the same power and heat problems have arisen. AMD's answer to this is the G3MX chip. This is very similar to the AMB, but is intended to be placed on the motherboard, not on the DIMM. It can connect to multiple DIMMs but, to minimize latency, is not designed to be daisy-chained. The G3MX has an asymmetrical link to the processor, to match typical memory usage patterns. 20 differential signals supply read data to the processor, and 13 differential signals receive commands and write data. This totals 66 pins, less than half of what is required for a DDR2 or DDR3 interface. Thus, a processor can easily have 4 G3MX memory interfaces, each with 4 buffered DIMMs attached, allowing up to 16 DIMMs to feed one processor.

Towns is also a prominent Christian leader and speaker on the principles of church growth, church leadership, Christian education, Sunday school, and prayer and fasting. He has written over 170 books, eight of which are listed on the Christian Booksellers Association Best Selling List. In 1995, his book The Names of the Holy Spirit received the Gold Medallion Award from the Evangelical Christian Booksellers Association for Book of the Year in Biblical Study. Most recently Towns has served as Dean of the B. R. Lakin School of Religion, Dean of Liberty University Baptist Theological Seminary, and Distinguished Professor of Systematic Theology at Liberty University. In fall 2013, Towns announced he would be taking a sabbatical from his teaching and administrative duties to focus on speaking and writing. Early life and education On October 21, 1932, Elmer Leon Towns Jr., was born to Elmer Leon Towns Sr., and Erin McFaddin Towns in Savannah, Georgia, the oldest of three children. The senior Towns was a clerk at a local hardware store, and though he earned middle-class wages, his addiction to alcohol strained the family‚Äôs finances and eventually claimed his life. Despite the difficulties at home, Towns Jr. was consistent in attending Eastern Heights Presbyterian Church as an adolescent, though he believes his real conversion to Christianity came in 1950, at the edge of his bed following an evangelistic meeting earlier in the evening. Towns attended Columbia Bible College for three years (1950-1953) before transferring during his senior year to Northwestern College in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and completing his Bachelor of Arts degree. He married Ruth Jean Forbes in 1953. He then attended Dallas Theological Seminary in pursuit of a Master of Theology degree. While in that program, Towns also enrolled in Southern Methodist University to study for a Master of Arts degree in Education. He received both master's degrees in 1958. A teaching post at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School moved Towns to Deerfield, Illinois, where he earned his Masters of Religious Education from nearby Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary in Evanston, Illinois, in 1967. Following an extended break from being a student, he attended Fuller Theological Seminary and received a Doctor of Ministry degree in 1983.  Ministry and influence on the Christian church  Towns began his work in ministry at the age of 19, when he re-opened Westminster Presbyterian Church in Savannah, Georgia, in 1952. Towns commuted to Savannah to serve as pastor of the church during his junior year at Columbia Bible College, and the congregation grew to over 100 attendees under his leadership. While attending graduate school at Dallas Theological Seminary, Towns attended and later joined the First Baptist Church of Dallas. Towns‚Äô affiliation with First Baptist Church was the catalyst for his career- spanning interest in church growth and promotion of large, vibrant congregations. First Baptist Church also introduced Towns to the importance of Sunday school as an education and retention tool within the Church. Also during his time in Dallas, Towns taught philosophy at Dallas Bible College, and served as Education Director for Southwest Baptist Tabernacle and pastor of Faith Bible Church. Following graduation from Dallas Theological Seminary, Towns accepted an assistant professorship in Christian Education at Midwest Bible College in St. Louis, Missouri. Towns was instrumental in helping the college achieve accreditation, and the experience earned him a place on the Accrediting Association of Bible Colleges (AABC). Towns‚Äô involvement with AABC led to his selection in 1961 as president of Winnipeg Bible Institute and College of Theology in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada (now Providence University College and Theological Seminary). During his tenure the college became accredited, doubled enrollment, and increased fundraising efforts. In 1965, Towns became Associate Professor of Christian Education at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in Deerfield, Illinois. A year later he became the Sunday School editor of Christian Life magazine, a position he held for 22 years. Both of these appointments corresponded with a remarkable increase in published works from him. Both posts also provided Towns with an environment for gathering and analyzing data on Sunday schools, Christian education, and church growth through the use of yearly surveys, interviews, and church attendance records. This combination of sociology and ministry to create models for church growth was unique. Towns used the editorial appointment to communicate to a national audience through articles and books his vision for effective Sunday school teaching and church growth, eventually becoming a leading figure in the field of Christian education. It was during this period that Towns released his first research compilation in the ground-breaking bestselling book The Ten Largest Sunday Schools and What Made Them Grow. The reception for this book was so overwhelming that Towns used his position at Christian Life to publish the list \\"The 100 largest Sunday Schools\\" annually for ten years. Also during this period he became an advisory board member for the Evangelical Teacher Training Association and wrote a textbook and two teacher manuals.  Co-founding of and involvement with Liberty University  In 1970, Jerry Falwell believed he was called to establish an institute of higher learning. Falwell, then pastor of Thomas Road Baptist Church, began a fund-raising campaign and started researching candidates to help lead the school. Falwell and Towns had met previously during the preparation for The Ten Largest Sunday Schools and What Made Them Grow, as Thomas Road Baptist Church was number nine on the list. Towns' academic work in Christian education and previous experiences with the college accreditation process made him a strong candidate. In 1971, Falwell and Towns co-founded Lynchburg Bible College in Lynchburg, Virginia (now Liberty University), with Falwell in an executive and fund-raising role and Towns as academic director and the school's only full-time instructor. In 1973, Towns left Lynchburg Bible College on sabbatical and became a consultant for the consolidation of seven small Bible colleges into Baptist University of America, in Atlanta, Georgia. He then served as vice-president and academic dean. In 1977, Towns returned to Lynchburg Bible College as editor-in-chief of all publications. During this time, Towns was editor of Faith Aflame, and started and edited Fundamentalist Journal and The Journal Champion (later renamed the Moral Majority Report). He was named dean of the seminary in 1979, and two years later, dean of the B.R. Lakin School of Religion, a position he still holds. Under his leadership, the School of Religion received accreditation in 1984 and started a doctoral program in 1987. During Towns' academic career, he has given theological lectures and seminars at over 111 theological seminaries and colleges worldwide. He holds visiting professorship rank in five seminaries and has received six honorary doctoral degrees. He has published over 2,000 reference and/or popular articles. Five doctoral dissertations have analyzed his contribution to religious education and evangelism. = Church Growth Institute = In 1983, Towns joined with Larry Gilbert to found the Church Growth Institute, Inc., for the purpose of creating and distributing educational content and seminars for both pastors and laymen on the subject of church growth in local congregations. A popular seminar on Sunday school revitalization was attended by over 60,000 people in the first five years it was offered. The most recognizable contribution by the Institute to the ministry community was the creation of the Friend Day program, in which congregation members were encouraged to invite non-believing acquaintances to a special seeker-friendly service at a local church. Over 15,000 churches participated in the first Friend Day, and it became a perennial event in many churches over the next decade. Towns continues to be active in this ministry, producing resource packets and education material.  Awards and acknowledgments  In 1995 Towns' book The Names of the Holy Spirit received the Gold Medallion Award for Book of the Year by the Christian Booksellers Association. In 2009 Towns was awarded the Bronze Telly Award for Through the Decades. Selected bibliography * Teaching Teens. Winnipeg, Canada: Winnipeg Bible Institute Press, 1963. * Successful Youth Work.

This was the last Sunday episode. To see the details in this image, go to Stripper's Guide. Barney Baxter in the Air was an American comic strip by Frank Miller. It started its run on September 30, 1935 for the Denver's Rocky Mountain News. Starting on December 7, 1936, it was syndicated by King Features. Barney Baxter was an \\"adventure strip\\" involving heroic exploits centering on aviation.Maurice Horn,Women in the Comics. New York :Chelsea House Publishers, 1977. (p.117)Ron Goulart, The Encyclopedia of American Comics. New York : Facts on File, 1990. (pp. 19-20) The strip was drawn by Miller until 1943 when Bob Naylor took over the duties for a short period. In 1943, the title was shortened to Barney Baxter. Miller returned to the strip in 1946. The strip was discontinued by King Features on January 22, 1950, following Miller's death on March 12, 1949. Characters and story Young aviator Barney Baxter experienced numerous airborne adventures, and during World War II, he battled both German and Japanese villains. Baxter was often accompanied by his sidekick Gopher Gus, who (unlike the rest of the characters) was drawn with the exaggerated facial features of a \\"humour strip\\" character. Other characters were Barney's mother, his rival love interests, Patricia and Maura, and his buddy Hap Walters. Comic strip historian Don Markstein noted: :Barney wasn't your standard pretty-boy hero. He was a bit on the short side and pudgy. His face looked kind of lumpy and was covered with freckles. He didn't have a big, toothy grin‚Äîin fact, he didn't smile very much at all. Of course, he wasn't downright ugly‚Äîhis pal, Gopher Gus, a desert rat turned pilot, was the ugly one. His other pal, Hap Walters, a sometime-girlfriend named Patricia and Barney's mom rounded out the cast. They had one thrilling adventure after another, fighting spies, air pirates, Latin American warlords and, when the time came, Nazis and Japs; and they kept it up for almost a decade and a half. The cartoonist behind Barney and his entourage was Frank Miller‚Äîbut not the Frank Miller who became famous decades later for his work on Elektra, Batman and Sin City. This Frank Miller was born in 1898 and spent his early thirties working on staff at Denver's Rocky Mountain News. There, he created Barney in 1935 for the paper's \\"Junior Aviator\\" page. At first the hero was a boy just entering his teens, who had a burning interest in airplanes; but the series took a more adventurous turn when a grown-up aviator named Cyclone Smith took him (with Mom's permission) on a trip to Alaska. By the time Barney got home, he was a seasoned crime fighter. Barney Baxter in the Air (as the strip was originally called‚Äîit dropped the last part in 1943) had been running a little more than a year when Miller moved East to work at William Randolph Hearst's New York Mirror; and from then on, Barney was no longer a one-paper strip. Starting in December, 1936, it was distributed by Hearst's King Features Syndicate. By that time, Barney had rapidly aged to about his late teens or early twenties. Miller's plots moved fast enough to keep most readers from noticing the occasionally large holes in them.Barney Baxter in the Air at Don Markstein's Toonopedia.

She joined the revue in 1990 and resigned in 2005. She is from Osaka. Troupe history * Moon Troupe: 1990‚Äì1998 * Cosmo Troupe: 1998‚Äì2000 * Supreme Member: 2000‚Äì2005 General information Considered as one of the powerful and multi-talented actresses while she was in the rooster, she started her Takarazuka career at Moon Troupe. Even though never being cast as the top bill during her new actor era, she already showed her talent since then‚Äîthe most memorable is Jaqueline Carstone in the first act of Me and My Girl. In her latter day in Moon Troupe, she once again portrayed in a female role: Anita from the Moon's production of West Side Story. Also, she could be in tough role like Ricardo in The Wind of Buenos Aires and a small-time crook like Duchain in Crossroad. In 1998, she was being transferred to the newly found Cosmos Troupe in order to replace Hikaru Asami, who had been transferred to Snow Troupe, and her first role in Cosmo Troupe is Prince Rudolph in the Tokyo run of Cosmo's production of Elisabeth in 1998. With the future portray of Emperor Franz Joseph of Flower's production of Elisabeth in 2003, she became one of the three actresses that has portrayed both father and son in this musical (along with Y≈çka Wao, who is the Emperor in the 1998 production and Mao Ayabuki, who is the Prince in the 2003 production) among actresses from the company. In June 2000, the directors of the company had made a radical change on the troupe structure by sending the second and third tier actresses of each troupe to the Senka, which served as the waiting list for top star of the troupes. Under this circumstance, she became one of the \\"Senka's Eleven\\" along with Wataru Kozuki. Therefore, when she had her first Bow Hall leading show, Freedom: Mr. Carmen (the retelling of the famous opera Carmen with Carmen is male and Jose [reversed with Josie] is female), which is under the production of Cosmo Troupe, she is billed as a member of Senka rather than as a member of Cosmo Troupe. She made special appearance in the production of Flower, Snow, Star and Cosmo. Also, she hosted TV show for Takarazuka Sky Stage, the speciality channel of TCA. In 2005, she resigned from the Revue via Flower Troupe by having her top bill performance Ernest in Love, reunioned with Asuka Tono. This makes her the only one among the Eleven (that did not make to the top) to have her own top bill show while resigning from the company.

He finished his career ranked eighth in scoring with 1,493 points and fifth in assists with 409 in school history. Hendrix possessed elite speed and put it on display during halftime of the intrasquad spring game in 1986, when tired of the taunts from football player Del Rodgers (a 1982 third-round draft pick), accepted his challenge to a 30-yard run and beat him barefoot. They would then run a 40-yard race where he won running the last 5 yards backwards. In 2005, he was inducted into the Crimson Club Hall of Fame. In 2006, he was inducted into the Utah Sports Hall of Fame. Professional career =Dallas Cowboys= Although he never played a down of college football, he signed with the Dallas Cowboys as an undrafted free agent in 1986, following on the foot steps of Cornell Green, Peter Gent, Percy Howard, Ken Johnson and Ron Howard, as basketball players that were converted by the Cowboys to play professional football.

In 1990, he became a starter, with 10 of his 11 starts coming at right cornerback after passing Robert Williams on the depth chart. He finished with 65 tackles, one interception, 6 passes defensed, one quarterback pressure and one forced fumble. The next year, he lost his starting job to rookie Larry Brown after the third game. At the end of the 1991 season, he was left unprotected in Plan B free agency. =San Francisco 49ers= On April 2, 1992, he was signed in Plan B free agency by the San Francisco 49ers, but was cut in July. =Buffalo Bills= On July 31, 1992, he signed as a free agent with the Buffalo Bills.

Background During the imperial period, the Maranh√£o region, which exported cotton, suffered a severe economic crisis because of competition with the increasingly productive United States. In addition, the cattle industry consumed a large part of the workforce in this region. These factors explain the involvement of the slave and poorly paid free workers in the movement. A political power dispute arose in the heart of the elite class, which was reflected in Maranh√£o by the opposition of liberals (bem-te-vis) and conservatives (cabanos). When Pedro de Ara√∫jo Lima, Marquis of Olinda became prime minister, provoking the so-called regresso conservador (\\"conservative regression\\"), the Maranh√£o conservatives took advantage of the opportunity to remove the liberals in power, and at the same time, weaken them further by contracting the service of the cattle ranchers, traditionally supported by the liberals. Revolt The event that began the revolt was the detention of the brother of rancher Raimundo Gomes from the ranch of his father, In√°cio Mendes, a contingent of the National Guard, invaded the municipal jail and freed him, in December 1838. Afterward, Gomes, with the support of Cosme Bento, an ex-slave with a force of 3,000 escaped Africans, and Manuel Francisco dos Anjos Ferreira, called the balaio (\\"basket\\") because he was a basketmaker, spread the revolt across the interior of Maranh√£o, conquering the province's second city in importance, Caxias, and going on to Piau√≠. Repression Despite liberals' attempts to control it, the movement acted on its own and got out of control. In the face of a growing mass of people, local elites sought ways to stop the revolt. The imperial government sent troops under the command of Colonel Lu√≠s Alves de Lima e Silva and made him the president of the province. By combining political pacification and a military offensive and by offering amnesty to the rebels who aided in the repression, a series of victories led to the successful pacification of the province in 1841. The leaders of the movement were killed in battle or captured. Many of the captured like Cosme Bento were sentenced and executed by hanging. Legacy For his work in the Province of Maranh√£o, Lima e Silva received the title of Baron de Caxias. References * Claudete Maria Miranda Dias. Balaios e Bem-te-vis: a guerrilha sertaneja (2a. ed.).

A sub-district of the Mid-City District Area, its boundaries as defined by the City Planning Commission are: City Park Avenue, Toulouse Street, North Carrollton, Orleans Avenue, Bayou St. John and St. Louis Street to the north, North Broad Street to the east, and the Pontchartrain Expressway to the west. It is a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places.Campanella, Richard. Time and Place in New Orleans: Past Geographies in the Present Day. Gretna, Louisiana: Pelican Publishing Company, 2002. In common usage, a somewhat larger area surrounding these borders is often also referred to as part of Mid-City. Geography Mid-City is located at and has an elevation of . According to the United States Census Bureau, the district has a total area of , all land. Mid-City is located, as the name indicates, in the middle of New Orleans on what was once the backslope of the Mississippi River natural levee, a gradually declining section of the river's flood plain. As such, it was not settled as early as adjacent neighborhoods and was called the \\"back of town\\"‚Äîthe city ended at the swamp, unlike today, when the city reaches the lake. The Esplanade Ridge and the adjoining Metairie Ridge formed a natural spur from the River; but what is now Mid-City, surrounded by these higher- elevated sections, was part of the \\"backswamp\\" until development in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.Neighborhood organization's statistics =Adjacent neighborhoods= * Navarre (north) * City Park (north) * Bayou St. John (north) * Tulane/Gravier (east) * Gert Town (south) * Dixon (west) * Lakewood (west) =Boundaries= The City Planning Commission defines the boundaries of Mid-City as these streets: City Park Avenue, Toulouse Street, North Carrollton Avenue, Orleans Avenues, Bayou St. John, St. Louis Street, North Broad Street and the Pontchartrain Expressway. Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 19,909 people, 5,830 households, and 2,939 families residing in the neighborhood. The population density was 11,993 /mi¬≤ (4,630 /km¬≤). As of the census of 2010, there were 14,633 people, 5,258 households, and 2,318 families residing in the neighborhood. Mid-City is one of New Orleans most racially diverse neighborhoods with its proximity to uptown, downtown and the suburbs contributing to its integrated diversity. Landmarks Mid-City is the home of a number of city landmarks. Canal Street, one of the most important thoroughfares of the city, bisects the neighborhood down the middle; the streetcar route follows Canal to Carrollton Avenue, another prominent New Orleans street that passes through Mid-City. Tulane Avenue, which is the terminus of U.S. Route 61, also runs just upriver from Canal Street; before the interstate highway system, this was the primary route into New Orleans from Baton Rouge. An important cross-street is Jefferson Davis Parkway, named for the president of the Confederate States of America, who died in New Orleans's Garden District during an 1889 visit. The Orleans Parish Criminal Court, the Dixie Brewery, Jesuit High School, Warren Easton High School, and the Falstaff Brewery (now converted to apartments) are physically among the most prominent buildings scattered across Mid-City, in addition to a number of churches and large houses along Canal Street. Tulane Avenue in particular shows some remnants of the area's industrial past. However, more characteristic of Mid-City today are the many shotgun houses and larger houses that make up most of this primarily residential neighborhood. Culture Running around the New Year bonfire in Mid-City New Orleans (2006) Mid-City is a generally local, middle-class neighborhood in that it contains fewer tourist destinations than other parts of the city. Restaurants and bars rely heavily on local clientele, giving the area a quirky local flavor. In the period before Hurricane Katrina on New Year's Eve, residents of Mid-City placed their Christmas trees in an area in Orleans Avenue and created a bonfire with the trees. They then threw fireworks into the bonfire.

The villages of Lauerz, on the southern side of the lake and in its eponymous municipality, and Seewen, at the eastern end of the lake in the municipality of Schwyz, lie on or close to the shore of the lake. The lake's principal inflow is the Steiner Aa, which flows into the north shore of the lake having passed through the village of Steinen, along with a number of smaller streams. The lake's outflow is at Seewen and takes the form of the Seeweren, a long stream. The Seeweren in turn flows into the Muota river, some above that river's mouth on Lake Lucerne. The 1806 Goldau landslide impacted the lake and caused a tsunami high. This damaged the villages of Lauerz and Seewen and the island of Schwanau, and partly filled the lake. More recently, floods in 1999 and 2005 have affected lakeside properties, especially in Lauerz, and attempts have been made to control the water level by connecting Lake Lauerz through a tunnel to Lake Lucerne.

The gift, however, was plundered on the voyage.

Cable v. Sinclair. Court of Civil Jurisdiction. David Collins J.A., July 1788 Life in Australia On 10 February 1788, Henry and Susannah Kable married in Sydney in a group wedding (the first European wedding ceremony in the new colony).Kable, Paul & Whittaker, June. Damed Rascals? A chronicle of Henry & Susannah Kable 1764 - 1846, page 62. Kable Pictorial, Sutton, N.S.W. . Soon after his arrival, Governor Phillip appointed Kable an overseer. The oddity of being the plaintiff in the first civil suit won by a convict may have brought Kable to the governor's notice, however, Kable later claimed to have had influential letters of recommendation. In 1798, Kable opened a hotel called the Ramping Horse, from which he ran the first stage coach in Australia, and he also owned a retail store. Henry became a constable of police, and later chief constable in the new colony and was involved on the prosecution side in criminal cases. Kable was dismissed 25 May 1802 for misbehaviour, after being convicted for breaches of the port regulations and illegally buying and importing pigs from a visiting ship. After this, he became merchant and ship owner. Like others in the colony, and perhaps because of his early success, Henry used the courts to argue cases against his opponents. He seems to have prospered; in 1808 shipping records show Kable and two partners, boat builder James Underwood and the other Simeon Lord, as principal ship owners in the expanding commerce of acquiring and exporting sealskins to the colony.Colonial Secretary Index, 1788‚Äì1825 Kable was one of 70 signatories to a petition to Governor Hunter from creditors who were anxious to prevent debtors from frustrating their demands by legal delays. The partnership dissolved in some bitterness shortly afterwards but not before Henry had managed to divest himself of a good deal of his property to his son, in order to avoid the consequences of any court order.[Neal, David. (1991). The rule of law in a penal colony : law and power in early New South Wales. Cambridge, England ; Melbourne : Cambridge University Press] Kable did much to pioneer sealing and shipbuilding in New South Wales, working with Simeon Lord who marketed the skins and James Underwood who built the ships. Like Lord and other early Sydney entrepreneurs, Kable always had a substantial landholding as a kind of 'sheet anchor'. He had been granted farms at Petersham Hill in 1794 and 1795, and in the latter year bought out four near-by grantees within a week of their grants being signed. In 1807 he owned at least four farms of about 170 acres (69 ha); in 1809 in addition he held five farms at the Hawkesbury and 300 acres (121 ha) at the Cowpastures, with a variety of real estate in Sydney itself including his comfortable house and extensive stores. He also had 40 horned cattle, 9 horses and 40 pigs. His business reputation seems to have been dubious, for he was regarded with distrust by Governor King and with active hostility by Governor Bligh who thought him and his partners fraudulent and had them imprisoned for a month and fined each ¬£100 for sending him a letter couched in improper terms. It is certain that Kable played no part in public life comparable with Simeon Lord's multifarious activities. His commercial career in Sydney seems to have ended soon after Lord & Co. broke up, for as early as February 1810 he announced that his son Henry Junior had taken over the entire management of his Sydney affairs. In 1811 Kable moved to Windsor where he operated a store and brewery, the latter in association with a partner, Richard Woodbury and his Sydney warehouse was let to Michael Hayes. Kable's grave Kable died on 16 April 1846, at Pitt Town near Windsor, New South Wales and was buried on 18 April 1846, at St Matthew's Anglican Church, Windsor. Legacy Henry and Susannah Kable had 11 children in total. Henry who had been born in England and another 10 children born in New South Wales including Dianna (1788‚Äì1854), Enoch (1791‚Äì1793), James (1793-1809), Susannah (1796-1885), George Esto (1797-1853), Eunice (1799-1867), William Nathaniel (1801-1837) John (1802-1859), Charles Dickenson (born 1804), and Edgar James (1806‚Äì1849). In 1968, on the 180th anniversary of the arrival of the First Fleet, more than a hundred descendants of Henry and Susannah Kable met in Sydney at Crows Nest to honour them as one of Australia's founding families. It was the first reunion of descendants in Australia to acknowledge convict ancestry. The 1977 folk opera The Transports by Peter Bellamy is based on the story of Henry Kable and his wife Susannah.The Transports In 1984, Zillah Kable Thomas and Lola Wilkinson, descendants of Henry and Susannah, unveiled a plaque commemorating Henry's land grant on the site of the former Regent Hotel (and the current Four Seasons Hotel) and the opening of the Kable's restaurant. In 1988, a family reunion saw 500 of Kable's descendants meet to celebrate Henry and Susannah's 200th Wedding Anniversary and the Bicentenary of Australia on the site of the first gaol in Sydney and the one that Henry controlled as the first chief constable in the colony. The event was recognised as an official Bicentennial event by the Australian Bicentennial Authority.

A native Oregonian, he served during World War II in Europe collecting art stolen by the Nazis for which he was award the Meritorious Service Medal and other accolades. He later served in the administration at Oregon State University and worked for the Portland Art Museum. Early life Gilkey was born in Linn County, Oregon. He began teaching art in 1930 as a student teacher at Albany College (now Lewis & Clark College). In 1936, he was the recipient of the first Master of Fine Arts (MFA) ever to be awarded by the University of Oregon. From 1937‚Äì1939, he produced the architectural etchings for the 1939 New York World's Fair and wrote the official book for that event, published by Charles Scribner's Sons. He joined the art faculty of Stephens College in Columbia, Missouri in 1939, where he remained for three years until he began his military service. He married Vivian E. Malone (1912‚Äì1996), also of Albany, in New York City in 1939. Vivian was by then a violin student at the Juilliard School. She was also a graduate of the University of Oregon and performed regularly in Oregon all her life. World War II service While serving in World War II, Gilkey wrote President Franklin D. Roosevelt, requesting a unit be established to review military tactics to help minimize damage to art and architecture in Europe. Roosevelt saw merit in the suggestion and directed General Dwight D. Eisenhower to award Gilkey command of that unit. When hostilities ceased, Gilkey was assigned to track down and confiscate Nazi propaganda art throughout the defeated Third Reich. In the process of those duties, he made the acquaintance of many artists throughout Europe. He was able, upon returning home, to help promote those artists' work throughout the United States via the International Print Exchange, which he founded from his home in Corvallis, Oregon. For these and subsequent efforts, he was knighted by France and given similar honors by Italy, Germany and Sweden. The United States awarded him the Meritorious Service Medal. In 1997, he was promoted in rank to Officer of the National Order of the L√©gion d'honneur by the French government. Academic career Following World War II, Gilkey became chairman of the art department at Oregon State College (now Oregon State University) in Corvallis and held that position for fifteen years. He staffed that department with many prominent artists of the Northwest School, including Nelson Sandgren, Demetrios Jameson, Paul Gunn, and Robert Huck. He was then appointed Dean of the School of Humanities and Social Sciences, which he developed into the College of Liberal Arts at what had by then become Oregon State University (OSU). His tenure at Oregon State lasted 30 years. While at OSU, Gilkey was active on the state and national art scene. In 1964, he was appointed by then- Governor Mark Hatfield to establish and become the first Chair of the Oregon Arts Commission. His pioneering work lead eventually to the formation of the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. He was partially responsible, along with Virginia Fontaine (wife of painter Paul Fontaine), for bringing numerous prints from the Czech Republic to the United States for exhibition in 1968. (personal communication) Gilkey was also a professor and printmaker-in-residence at the Pacific Northwest College of Art. He endowed the Vivian and Gordon Gilkey Print Center at the college. Military service He retired from the United States Air Force in 1977 as a full colonel in the Air Force Reserves, where he was attached for many years to Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). During active duty periods in the mid 1960s, he developed special projects for then-U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara and for the U.S. National War College. Later life and death Retiring from OSU in 1977, Gilkey served as curator of prints and drawings at the Portland Art Museum for the balance of his life. He brought his collection of over 7,000 prints to the museum, which he then built into a world-renowned inventory of over 25,000 works of art on paper. The museum's Vivian and Gordon Gilkey Center for the Graphic Arts was inaugurated in 1993. He was active as a curator up until his death in 2000. Gilkey died in Portland, Oregon at the age of 88.

The unrest took place from 31 October 1874 to January 1875 as part of wider anti-government protests. Background The metric system was first introduced in Brazil in 1862 as a rebellion against the monopoly established by foreign merchants. Slaves took part on occasions demanding emancipation. Through January the revolt died on its own, without any drastic intervention by the army. The spread of the revolt led to involvement of groups with different goals, such as slaves demanding emancipation, anti masonic clergy and conscientious objectors. The revolt was caused by the implementation of a variety of provincial and municipal taxes, that rendered goods unaffordable for a large portion of the population. The adoption of the metric system further increased prices, as merchants seized the opportunity to manipulate the prices, draft resistance also played a role in increasing tensions. Religion played a role in the uprising as the rebels often assembled in churches, praying before the patron saints before launching their raids, the rebel flag depicted effigies of the Virgin Mary and Christ on the Cross. The insurgents lacked central leadership, instead being led by local commanders who usually commanded small bands. Revolt On 31 October 1874, a marketplace in Fagundes, Para√≠ba was disturbed by the shouts of a group of people protesting the imposition of market taxes, requiring them to pay 200 reis for every quantity of purchased goods touching the ground. The protestors banished a local tax collector from the market, tearing down lists of municipal taxes. The peasants then pursued to destroy scales and measurements representing the metric system, as their use was also subject to taxation. Fagundese citizens and their supporters from the neighboring areas continued to resist taxation organising riots on 7 and 14 November, the intervention of the district judge and vicar failed to bring any results. On 21 November, a band of 800 armed men attacked the town of Ing√°, burning the archives of the town's council and destroying all records related to taxation, later forcing a police commander to sign a declaration cancelling all the new taxes. Unrest spread through the region affecting the towns of Campina Grande, Alagoa Grande, Alag√¥ia Nova, Arara, Areia, Bananeiras, Espalhada and Independencia among others. On the same day the towns of Timba√∫ba and Itamb√©, Pernambuco were targeted by the rebels, prompting provincial president Lucena to send a force of 40 regular troops to the destroyed towns on 27 November. The troops under the command of Pedro de Alcantara Tiberia Capistrano, reached Itamb√© three days later but were ordered to remain inactive by the district judge. On 7 December, the troops patrolled the Itamb√© market, enabling officials to collect taxes. The deployment of soldiers proved insufficient, as riots resumed the following week engulfing Angelica, Allian√ßa, Caruar√∫ and Vicencia. A 400 man mob left Caruar√∫, marching to Bezerros and Bonita on 12 December and intimidating the local authorities. Provincial president Lucena then reacted by dispatching a second force consisting of 40 national guardsmen and 20 regular troops. On 19 December, the rebels encountered the soldiers while raiding the house of the Bonita taxman. The two sides clashed, leaving one rebel and two soldiers dead and over three people wounded. News of the confrontation reached a nearby prison, with 10 prison guards and 4 soldiers reaching the destroyed house and repelling the mob. Rumors of a new tax to be imposed on combing one's hair led to the spread of the riots to the province of Alagoas, mobs broke scales, burned taxation and army recruitment documents, while ridiculing the police. Loyalist militias were summoned in several locations disrupting the riots. The last major violent incident within the borders of Pernambuco took place on 25 December, when 500 rebels raided the house of a judge in Villa Bella, failing however to find any documents. On 3 January 1875, a group of merchants from Quebrangulo, Rio Grande do Norte unsuccessfully resisted the rebels who in turn killed 10 and injured many more of the traders.

It involves Pope Julius II, who had recently died, trying to persuade Saint Peter to allow him to enter Heaven by using the same tactics he applied when alive. The dialogue is also supplemented by a \\"Genius\\" (his guardian angel) who makes wry comments about the pope and his deeds. Plot The dialogue begins with a drunken Pope Julius II trying to open the gate of heaven with the key to his secret money-chest. He is accompanied by his Genius, his guardian angel. Behind him are the soldiers who died in his military campaigns, who he promised would go to heaven regardless of their deeds. Peter denies him passage, even when Julius threatens him with his army and papal bulls of excommunication, and questions him about his deeds on Earth. Julius then goes into a lengthy explanation of his deeds and justifies his sins, ranging from simony to pederasty, with the fact that the pope has the authority to excuse any sin. Peter is disgusted by his description and turns him away. The dialogue ends with Julius planning to muster an army to create his own paradise and capture Heaven. Authorship Erasmus is usually credited as the author of the dialogue. He sometimes implied that he did not write it, but modern scholarship generally overrides this with internal evidence, lack of a credible alternative author, and several cautious statements in a later correspondence. Thomas More writes in a letter on 15 December 1516 that he has gotten hold of a copy of the dialogue in Erasmus' handwriting, and asks Erasmus what to do with it.R. W. Chambers (1935), Thomas More, 1938 reprint, London: Jonathan Cape, The Bedford Historical Series, Ch. 2, \\"An Under-Sheriff Seeks Utopia\\", ¬ß4, \\"The Fortunate Isles Hear the Julian Trumpet\\", p. 115; Erasmus, Opus Epistolarum Des. Erasmi Roterodami, edd., P. S. and H. M. Allen, Vol. 2, Letter 502. It is thought that Erasmus made evasive comments to avoid losing allies and to avoid retribution from his enemies and the Inquisition. A more logical conclusion, however, is that he denied authorship because it would be equated to a slap in the face to his patron Pope Leo X, who legitimized Erasmus's birth by means of papal dispensation in 1517. Still, the dialogue was very popular and was reprinted many times in pamphlets. It was praised by Martin Luther to be \\"so learned, and so ingenious, that is, so entirely Erasmian, that it makes the reader laugh at the vices of the church, over which every true Christian ought rather to groan\\" (Theosophy San Diego, online paper, p. 6). It is very apparent, however, that Erasmus highly disliked Julius II because he felt he did not embody the characteristics of a vicar of Christ. He was shocked by Julius II's personal leadership of armies in full armour and what he felt was the work of a worldly, unscrupulous and ambitious man. These thoughts were clearly implied in his more famous satirical work, The Praise of Folly.

Bacon, of Derby, he was educated at Derby School and Emmanuel College, Cambridge (Scholar). In 1945, he married Enid Trigg (who died in 2003), and they had a son and a daughter. Career Bacon built the first neutron diffractometer in the UK at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment, Harwell, and then made the first experiments outside the United States in neutron diffraction, a means of studying the basic structures and dynamics of materials. He wrote scientific papers, textbooks and review articles on the use of neutron scattering. His work included a study of the neutron intensities diffracted by crystals, which led to studies of the basic structure of molecules and of magnetism. His book Neutron Diffraction was a standard text, beginning with the first edition in 1955. *1939‚Äì1946: Scientific Officer, Telecommunications Research Establishment of the Air Ministry *1946‚Äì1963: Deputy Chief Scientific Officer, Atomic Energy Research Establishment, Harwell *1963-1981: Professor of Physics at the University of Sheffield *1969‚Äì1971: Dean of the Faculty of Pure Science, University of Sheffield *1981 to date: Emeritus professor of the University of Sheffield Honours *1988: Leverhulme Emeritus Fellow *1999: Guthrie Medal and Prize and Fellow of the Institute of Physics *1998: Honorary degree of Doctor of Science (Sheffield) Major publications *Neutron Diffraction (1955) *Applications of Neutron Diffraction in Chemistry (1963) *X-ray and Neutron Diffraction (1966) *Neutron Physics (1969) *Neutron Scattering in Chemistry (1977) *The Architecture of Solids (1981) *Fifty Years of Neutron Diffraction (1987) *Many scientific publications on X-ray and neutron crystallographic studies in Proceedings of the Royal Society, etc. References *Bacon, Prof. George Edward in Who's Who 2007, from Bacon, Prof. George Edward (accessed 23 August 2007) External links *British Crystallographic Association: 50 Years of Neutron Scattering *George E.

It is an invasive weed in Florida where it invades open forest and wetland areas. The type specimen was collected in the vicinity of Nab√∫a, on the island of Luzon in the Philippines by Luis N√©e. Distribution Distribution of the Lygodium microphyllum Lygodium microphyllum is native to much of tropical Africa and South Africa; tropical Asia, China, Ryukyu Islands of Japan, Australia, Fiji, the Mariana Islands and Caroline Islands. Lygodium microphyllum has become naturalized in the Caribbean and the southeastern United States.  Effects on the environment  Lygodium microphyllum causes problems in the environments where it is invasive. The plant damages wetland ecosystems, harming endangered species. The fern's ability to grow up and over trees and shrubs and to form dense horizontal canopies allows it to cover whole communities of plants, reducing native plant diversity. Old World climbing fern can grow in many diverse ecosystems. Lygodium microphyllum poses problems for fires, both natural and man-made, because it can lead fire into the tree canopy, killing trees. The fern is rapidly spreading in South Florida's public conservation lands.  Containment  Recently, the USDA approved the use of insects to keep the fern contained. Insects (Austromusotima camptozonale, Neomusotima conspurcatalis) and mites (Floracarus perrepae) have been released in several state parks to control the fern. Although some populations were devastated by a bout of cold weather, recently, reports of new activity have been made. Ethnobotany Lygodium microphyllum has been used locally in folk medicine to treat skin ailments and problems, swelling and dysentery. Other uses Lygodium microphyllum fibers (as well as other species of Lygodium), known as nito, are used to weave traditional salakot hats in the Philippines.

National Tile Contractors AssociationAmerican Society for Testing and Materials Standard ASTM C 242 Quarry tile is manufactured from clay in a manner similar to bricks.http://www.metroceramics.com/about- section/about---what-is-quarry-tile/ It is shaped from clay, and fired at a high temperature, ~2,000 F¬∞.  Sizes and shapes  The most traditional size in the US is nominally 6 in √ó 6 in √ó in thick. Other common sizes include 4 in √ó 8 in and 8 in √ó 8 in.  Finishes  Traditional quarry tile was unglazed and either red or gray; however, modern \\"decorator\\" tiles come in a variety of tints and finishes. Industrial quarry tile is available with abrasive frit embedded in the surface to provide a non-slip finish in wet areas such as commercial kitchens and laboratories.  Uses  Quarry tile is extensively used for floors where a very durable material is required. It can be used either indoors or outdoors, although freeze-resistant grades of tile should be used outdoors in climates where freeze-thaw action occurs. Quarry tile is used less often as a wall finish and is occasionally used for countertops, although the wide grout joints can make cleaning of countertops difficult. Most commercial kitchens require a quarry tile to be used because of its slip resistant and non-porous properties.  Installation  For floors, quarry tile is usually set in a thick bed of cementitious mortar. For wall applications, it can be set in either a thick bed of cementitious mortar or a thin bed of mastic. For both floors and walls, the joints between tiles are usually grouted with cementitious grout. Grout joints are traditionally about inch in width. Matching trim shapes such as coves, bases, shoes, and bullnoses are available to turn corners and terminate runs of the tile.

They are an influential 1980s band that still continues successful to this day.  History  Biquini Cavad√£o is the name of a tiny cut-a-way bikini well known in Brazilian beaches during the eighties. It is also the name of one of the most famous bands in Brazil in the last thirty years, with more than one million copies of their albums sold, with more than two thousand shows nationwide, as well as abroad. Bruno Gouveia (vocals), Miguel Flores da Cunha (keyboards), Alvaro Birita (drums) and Sheik (bass), after one year presenting gigs in high school parties, mostly covers from emerging Brazilian bands, decided to make their own music. With a great help from Carlos Beni (Kid Abelha's former drummer) and Herbert Vianna (Paralamas do Sucesso), who actually named the band, their first song ever air played - \\"T√©dio\\" - became an instant hit. Signed by Polygram and with the inclusion of guitar player Carlos Coelho, they released their debut single at that same year and in 1986, they released their first album, Cidades em Torrente. They released two more albums in the eighties (A Era da Incerteza and Z√©) with minor hits than its predecessor. Things changed radically in beginning of the nineties with their fourth album. With Desciviliza√ß√£o, they hit the charts with three songs: Z√© Ningu√©m, Vento Ventania and Imposs√≠vel. As a consequence, they opened the night for Alice in Chains and Red Hot Chilli Peppers in Morumbi Stadium, S√£o Paulo and Apoteose Square, Rio de Janeiro, for the Hollywood Rock event for more than 60 thousand people, in 1993. They released two more albums (Agora and biquini.com.br) during the decade, always with great hits (Chove Chuva, a Jorge Ben cover, and Jana√≠na) and minor singles (Sabor do Sol and Ilus√£o). A RockBook telling the story of the band and including 20 hits for guitar playing was released in October 1996 to celebrate their first decade. Pioneer entrepreneurs, they were the first Brazilian band to have an e-mail to keep direct contact with their fans, and the first Brazilian group to have an official website. Their two \\"greatest hits\\" albums O Melhor do Biquini Cavad√£o and Millenium achieved platinum and gold marks in Brazil. The album biquini.com.br was the first ever in Brazil to attach a multimedia soft kit to access the Internet, sponsored by UNISYS. In 2000, they released Escuta Aqui acclaimed by the critics as one of the best albums of the band, headed by the title track. Always one step ahead, the album was the first one to have the recording sessions broadcast via Internet using a webcam and also with a recording's diary (or what we call today \\"blog\\"). Another partnership, this time with Apple Computer Brazil, sponsored the media kit, including videos and a complete database of their shows since 1985. After 15 years together they faced their first crisis and the group was reduced to a quartet, with Bruno, Miguel, Alvaro and Coelho. Biquini Cavad√£o in 2001 also played for 250 thousand people in the last night of Rock In Rio III, coincidentally headlined again by Red Hot Chili Peppers. After seven CDs containing mostly their own songs, the band decided to record their first cover album. Named \\"80\\", the group revisited contemporary Brazilian bands, such as Os Paralamas do Sucesso, Engenheiros, Bar√£o, Kid Abelha and RPM. The single M√∫mias\\", again hit the charts, in a duet with Renato Russo, lead singer of Legi√£o Urbana, who recorded this track with Biquini in their first album. Renato died in 1996, victim of AIDS, but thanks to Direct to Disk Digital Recordings, he reappeared in this new version. In 2002 \\"Quando Te Encontrar\\" , featured in Malha√ß√£o, TV Globo's soap opera, took the FM Radios by surprise in the country and gave the band another hit single. In 2005, they released their first live album. The CD/DVD Ao Vivo achieved diamond and celebrated the band's 20th birthday. Three hit singles proved that the band conquered a new generation of fans, not only those from the eighties. Vou Te Levar Comigo, Quanto Tempo Demora Um M√™s and Dani . The tour again covered the entire country and they also played some dates in the US. In 2007, the band decided to open their own label and released three albums at the same time. So Quem Sonha Acordado V√™ O Sol Nascer brings new hits like Em Algum Lugar No Tempo while 1985/2007 vols.1&2 gives new flavours to their greatest hits. In 2008, they recorded their second DVD, 80 vol.2, a sequel of their album released in 2001, live in Rio de Janeiro and with Claudia Leitte among many other guest appearances. After five years releasing singles, predicting a new way of working in the music business, they released Roda-Gigante. Its title track was a nominee for the best Brazilian song in Latin Grammys 2013. They toured extensively and released another double CD and DVD. Me Leve Sem Destino was recorded in Goiania to celebrate their 30th anniversary and released by Sony Music. After touring for two years, the work with producer Liminha for the release of As Voltas Que O Mundo D√° in 2017, giving new concepts for what started as something naive in the last century.

History It was started in May 1876, by a group of Englewood residents who purchased of land for a cemetery. The property sits on the East side of Engle Street adjacent to Tenafly, New Jersey. The cemetery was named for the brook running beside its eastern boundary. A chapel built with the local pink sandstone was erected on East Palisades Avenue and dedicated in March 1860. It was the first Presbyterian Church in Englewood and the first in Bergen County, New Jersey. It had a seating capacity of 200, and was expanded to accommodate 800 people in 1880. In 1887, the chapel was donated to the cemetery, and moved, stone by stone, to its present site near the entrance gate to the east side of the cemetery. When the chapel was moved, and reconstructed, the building was rotated and the entrance moved from the west side of the building to the east side. Mayor, and historian, Austin Nicholas Volk calls it: \\"One of the most beautiful cemeteries in Bergen County, New Jersey.\\" Schuyler Warmflash refers to is as an \\"outdoor museum\\" and he wrote \\"[The] change of attitude ‚Äî which made sites devoted to the dead reassuringly pleasant to the living ‚Äî is clearly manifest in Brookside Cemetery\\".

Sweetwood is a common name for some plants in this genus.  Description  They are trees and bushes, hermaphrodites. The leaves are alternate, entire, glabrous or pubescent, pinnatinervias, with longitudinal grooves. Simple, alternate, petiole 0.9 to 2.2 cm in length canalicular limbo 11 to 28 cm long and 5 to 11 cm wide, with 16-28 secondary veins; base acute decurrent and revolute, entire, apex elliptically shaped, green dark, and very oblique secondary veins visible on the underside. terminal buds whitish. The inflorescences are pseudo-axillary, paniculate, the last divisions cimosas, mostly somewhat pubescent, the flowers are small, rarely more than 1 cm in diameter, white or greenish tepals equal. The fruit is a drupe, domed red-pink, fleshy andovoid, green when are immature and black when ripe.  Ecology  Nectandra cissiflora berry. A neotropical genus with 114 species, the genus is similar to Ocotea, to which it is closely related: the most characteristic distinguishing features are the position of the locules in the anther (in an arc in Nectandra and in 2 rows in Ocotea); papillose pubescence is present; the Nectandra petals are fused at the base itself and fall as a unit in the old flowers; they are free in Nectandra but in Ocotea fall individually. Medium trees reach 60 cm in diameter and 25 m in height with straight, slender, cylindrical boles that have low and thin protuberances at the base. The various species are located in the middle stratum of forests. Many species are used as timber.http://www.cnf.org.pe/enero011/MD.pdf The family Lauraceae was part of the Gondwanaland flora and many of its genera migrated to South America via Antarctica on ocean landbridges in the Paleocene era. There they spread over most of the continent. When the North American and South American tectonic plates joined in the late Neogene, volcanic mountain building created island chains which later formed the meso-American landbridge. Pliocene elevation created new habitats for speciation. While some genera died out in increasingly xerophytic Africa, starting with the freezing of Antarctica about 20 million years ago and the formation of the Benguela current, others, like Beilschmiedia, and Nectandra, which also reached south and meso-America, are still surviving today in Africa in a number of species. The genus Persea, however, died out in Africa, except for Persea indica, surviving in the fog shrouded mountains of the Canary Islands, which with Madagascar constitutes Africa's Laurel forest plant refugia. In meso-America, the genus Nectandra proliferated into new species and the berries of some of them constitute a valuable food supply for the quetzal bird that lives in the montane rainforests of meso-America. Since this habitat is constantly threatened by encroching agriculture, the laurel forest animal and plant species had already become rare in many of its former habitats and are threatened by habitat loss. The quetzal's favorite fruits are berries of relatives of Nectandra umbrosa. Their differing maturing times in the Cloud forest determine the migratory movements of the quetzals to differing elevation levels in the forests. With a gape width of 21 mm, the quetzal swallows the small berries (aquacatillos) whole, which he catches while flying through the lower canopy of the tree, and then regurgitates the seed within 100 meters from the tree. Wheelright in 1983 observed that parent quetzals take far less time intervals to deliver fruits to the young brood than insects or lizards, reflecting the ease of procuring fruits, as opposed to capturing animal prey. Since the young are fed exclusively berries in the first 2 weeks after hatching, these berries must be of high nutritional value. Usually only the total percentage of water, sugar, nitrogen, crude fats and carbohydrates are reported by ornithologistshttp://www.avocadosource.com/CAS_Yearbooks/CAS_83_1999/CAS_1999_PG_163-171.pdf Medical use Plants from this genus have been used in the treatment of several clinical disorders in humans. It has been demonstrated that Nectandra plants have potential analgesic, anti-inflammatory, febrifuge, energetic and hypotensive activities. Nectandra also has been investigated as a possible antitumoral agent and the presence of neolignans suggests its potential use as a source of chemotherapeutics. Crude extracts of Nectandra contain alkaloids and lignans, berberine and sipirine. Some authors have postulated that tannins play important roles as antioxidant compounds in the scavenging of free radicals.

Masonry units such as bricks, concrete masonry units or structural glazed facing tiles may be ordered from manufacturers with square or bullnosed corners. When referring to bullnose, it is sometimes modified by adding the word quarter or half. In the illustration, one piece of quarter- bullnose tile is juxtaposed with a plain piece of tile, to create a finished look - note that the top trim strip shows a quarter-bullnose on two of its sides. However, when referring to counter tops (such as a granite counter top in a kitchen) which extends beyond the edge of the underlying cabinetry, either a quarter-bullnose or half-bullnose edge may be used. A half-bullnose can be constructed by bonding two sections with quarter-bullnose, effectively creating a 180-degree curve, in order to create a more finished appearance. This would effectively double the thickness of that portion which extends beyond the cabinetry. A bullnose is used in highway construction in North America to buffer and protect the end of the crash barrier or Jersey barrier at entrance and exit ramps.

Rules Game play is very similar to FreeCell, except that the tableau is built down in suit, and only a king or a sequence starting with a king may be placed on empty tableau spots (although they can simplify the rule and put any card or sequence in an empty tableau spot). There are ten tableau columns instead of eight. In the initial deal five cards are dealt face-up to each column, leaving two cards in hand dealt to the two FreeCells (usually the center but can be in any pattern). The suit restriction makes the game more difficult than FreeCell. This is counterbalanced by there being more columns of fewer cards. History An Apple Macintosh version of Seahaven Towers was released in 1988 by Art Cabral,Longwood Wizard's Guild, archived from August 2016. which helped popularize the game under that name, but Art himself insisted that he did not invent its rules. A Seahaven Towers card game was provided with the Silicon Graphics, Inc. IRIX operating system, and included an automated solver that could determine whether a particular game could be solved.

The name could originate from any of several Cornish farms or hamlets such as Trezise in the parish of St Martin in Meneage, or Tresayes in the parish of Roche, both in West Cornwall. The derivation is from the pre-12th-century Cornish Tre-saws, meaning the place of the Saxons, a reference to English settlers in the county.Surname Database: Tresise Last Name Origin One of the earliest documented occurrences of the name is that of Margery Tresise, who was baptized on 1 October 1632 in the village of St. Erth in Cornwall, and whose father was listed as Anthony Tresise. Margery apparently died nine years later and was buried in St Erth on 11 March 1641 but had at least eight siblings, of whom Edward (1640) and Anthony (1643) were the progenitors of many of the current bearers of the name.St Erth, Cornwall, England Spellings of the surname were often quite fluid and members of the same family would frequently pass on alternative spellings when registering births, deaths, and marriages and responding to censuses. The 1881 census of England and Wales listed 454 people with surnames that were variants of Tresise, Trezise, etc. Of these, 309 (68%) lived in Cornwall and Devon, 18 (4%) lived in what today would be considered Greater London and the remainder were distributed throughout the country, particularly in Wales and southern England.All Published Record Collections ‚Äî FamilySearch.org ;Notable people with the name * Artie Trezise, Scottish folk singer and entertainer * Ian Trezise (born 1959), Australian rules footballer * John Tresize (born 1954), Australian rules footballer * Neil Trezise (1931‚Äì2006), Australian politician * Patrick Trezise (born 1982), South African judoka * Percy Trezise (1923‚Äì2005), Australian art historian * Rachel Trezise (born 1978), Welsh author * Brian Trezise 7 time Drag racing/ Burnout championship winner * Keith Trezise English Singer/Songwriter/Author Marine engineer *Mikey Trezise (born 1998), English Outboard engineer References Surnames Cornish- language surnames ","title":"Trezise"},{"id":"12901426","text":"Nectandra citrifolia is a species of plant in the family Lauraceae.

A 12th-century writer believed it to be \\"In length three Scots yards and bigger than an ordinary man‚Äôs leg ‚Äì in form and callour to our common muir edders.\\" The myth is similar to that of the more famous Lambton Worm. Legend Mediaeval stone carving above the door of Linton church. Said by tradition to celebrate the heroism of de Somerville, it shows a knight on horseback apparently confronting two large quadruped animals. The monster lived in a hollow on the northeast side of Linton Hill, a spot still known as the \\"Worm‚Äôs Den\\", at Linton in Roxburghshire on the Scottish borders. Emerging from its lair at dusk and dawn to ravage the countryside, eating crops, livestock and people, it proved invulnerable to the weapons ranged against it. The surrounding area became ruined by the beast's predations. The news reached the ears of one (William or John) de Somerville, the Laird of Lariston and a man of reckless courage, who was in the south at that time. He travelled to the nearby village of Jedburgh and heard the lurid tales of the locals. Observing the beast himself he saw that the creature would open its mouth wide to swallow anything in its path but when faced with something too large to eat would remain still, with its mouth open. Sensing an opportunity he went to a local blacksmith and had him forge an iron covered spear with wheel at its tip which could impale a hunk of peat tipped in tar and brimstone. He practised riding with the burning spear to accustom his horse to the smoke. De Somerville approached the worm's hideout with his servant at dawn. He knew that sitting on his horse he would prove too large for the creature to swallow. As if at a joust he attacked it, plunging his burning lance into the monster's gaping mouth and down its throat, mortally wounding it. The Orcadian folklorist Ernest Marwick highlights the similarity between the method used to kill the Linton worm and those recounted in the slaying of the Stoor worm of the Orkneys, which was also killed with burning peat. The writhing death throes of the Linton Worm supposedly created the curious topography of the hills of the region, an area that came to be known as \\"wormington\\". The animal retreated to its lair to die, its thrashing tail bringing down the mountain around it and burying it forever. The legend states that de Somerville's heroism was memorialised by a carved stone at Linton Kirk.Linton, www.cheviotchurches.org, accessed 12 August 2014 He was made Royal Falconer, knighted and made \\"First Barrone\\" of Linton. The crest of the Somervilles was a wyvern (heraldic dragon) perched on a wheel.Scott, Walter, ed., James Somerville, author, Memorie of the Somervilles, vol. 1 (1815), pp. 6‚Äì8, 37‚Äì46.

There are several settlements within the valley, These are Roseau, Jacmel, Bois d'Inde, Morne d'Or, Morne Ciseaux, Coolietown, Derri√®re Lagoon, Vanard and Millet. Originally the valley had been used for the cultivation of sugar and a railway (since been lifted) was used to transport the sugar from further up the valley to a processing plant at Roseau. Until the 1980s there was a thriving farmer's and fisherman's market at Roseau, but since then most people now travel to the market at Castries. More recently, it is a major production area for bananas. There is still a distillery at Roseau and it has produced several prize-winning rums.

On May 22, 1832, Fort Dixon was officially named as a base by General Henry Atkinson. Because the site was centrally located between Fort Dearborn, Fort Armstrong, and Fort Clark, General Atkinson established Fort Dixon as his command post.

Heinlein. She is the mother, lover and eventual wife of Lazarus Long, the longest-living member of Heinlein's fictional Howard Families. She is the only character from the \\"Lazarus Long cycle\\" to have an entire fictional memoir devoted to her life.J - Heinlein Concordance Maureen Johnson and Pixel. Background Maureen first appears as a secondary character in the 1973 novel Time Enough for Love. She appears briefly in The Number of the Beast (1980), The Cat Who Walks Through Walls (1985) and recounts her own life story, and sometimes contradictory versions of events recorded in other Heinlein stories, in 1987's To Sail Beyond the Sunset. Early life and marriage Maureen was born in Missouri on July 4, 1882, the daughter of Doctor Ira Johnson, a member of the Howard Families. As a young teenager, Maureen discovers this fact from her very frank father who encourages her to seek a husband from among the accepted list of family candidates. She marries Brian Smith and they settle in Kansas City and have several children, all subsidized by the Howard Families foundation. Children The most famous of her children is Woodrow Wilson Smith, born November 11, 1912. Woodrow will eventually be known by many names in his long life, the most famous being \\"Lazarus Long.\\" Time Enough for Love recounts how, during 1916, Maureen and her father are visited by a mysterious man who calls himself Theodore Bronson. Bronson and Maureen are mentally and physically attracted to one another, and even go on a date and attempt to have sex, but are thwarted by young \\"Woody,\\" who sneaks along, hidden in the back of the car. Ted Bronson eventually goes off to fight in the war, and is presumed killed. \\"Bronson\\" was eventually revealed to Maureen to be her time-traveling son, Woodrow, aka \\"Lazarus Long.\\" Post-divorce business career and \\"death\\" When Brian Smith divorces Maureen to marry their daughter-in-law, Maureen strikes out on her own, becomes a board member of D. D. Harriman's Harriman Enterprises, the first company to put a man on the moon in Heinlein's central universe (\\"The Man Who Sold the Moon\\"). She also witnesses the introduction of the \\"rolling roads\\" (\\"The Roads Must Roll\\"). On June 20, 1982, Maureen, just short of her one hundredth birthday, is crossing a street when a truck barrels down on her. She has no time for regrets as she is scooped up in a rescue mission from the future by her son Lazarus, with assistance from Hilda Corners Burroughs, Jacob Burroughs, Zebediah Carter, Dejah Thoris \\"Deety\\" Burroughs Carter and their sentient car, Gay Deceiver. The rescue is outlined in the book The Number of the Beast. Rejuvenation and Time Corps career She is rejuvenated, and first works as a nursing assistant, then a nurse, and eventually a physician/rejuvenator herself. But she regrets not knowing the eventual fate of her beloved father, Dr. Ira Johnson, and on the advice of co- husband Jubal Harshaw becomes an agent of the Time Corps (often accompanied by Pixel, the titular \\"Cat Who Walks Through Walls\\"). She is kidnapped by the \\"Committee For Aesthetic Deletions\\" while on a research trip and held in Kansas City on a previously unknown time-line. Pixel manages to lead Lazarus to Maureen and rescue her from the Committee. Then Maureen, Lazarus and the rest of the Long family rescue Ira Johnson from certain death during the Coventry Blitz. Worlds without end Maureen is united with her descendants in a massive group marriage in the settlement of Boondock on the planet Tellus Tertius.

She was responsible for coming to the aid of stricken vessels. Preserver (ARS‚Äì8), a salvage ship, was laid down by Basalt Rock Company in Napa, California, 26 October 1942; launched 1 April 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Walter F. LaFranz; and commissioned 11 January 1944, Lt. Comdr. A. T. Ostrander in command. World War II service After shakedown out of San Francisco, California, Preserver steamed for Pearl Harbor 26 February in company with PC‚Äì1139. The next day she was ordered to come about and to report to Port Director, San Pedro, California, for orders. She was once again underway for Pearl Harbor 5 March, with YOG‚Äì18 in tow. Arriving Pearl Harbor 16 March, she reported for duty with Service Squadron 2. =Saipan operations= Hawaiian operations and yard availability took Preserver through April. Steaming for Majuro Atoll 10 May, she arrived two weeks later and commenced salvage operations between Majuro, Eniwetok, and Kwajalein with Service Squadron 10. She was a unit of Capt. S. E. Peck's Service and Salvage Group during the capture of Saipan (15‚Äì21 June 1944), providing salvage services off the west coast of that island. When Japanese snipers set off an ammunition dump near the beach at 2100 June 20, Preserver sent a fire-fighting party ashore to render assistance. Preserver worked at clearing Tanapag Harbor, Saipan 9‚Äì23 July. She then worked in the Tinian area. By 12 August she was at Eniwetok, and the next day she steamed for Pearl Harbor, arriving 22 August for upkeep and availability. Repairs kept her at Pearl Harbor until 11 September, when she steamed for Eniwetok, arriving the 28th. =Damaged by bomb= She was at Seeadler Harbor, Manus, 6 October, and departed five days later for Leyte Gulf. A bomb penetrated her hull 20 October, flooding her motor room and causing loss of power throughout the ship. Battle damage repairs necessitated calls at Hollandia, New Guinea; Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides; and finally at Pearl Harbor from 5 February 1945 through the following July. After final repairs Preserver stood out of Pearl Harbor 8 August, bound for Kwajalein Atoll, the Marshalls. She made further calls at Guam and Okinawa, and the second week of October she operated at Wakayama, Honsh≈´, Japan. After the close of hostilities, Preserver participated in salvage operations during the weapons tests at Bikini Atoll, and then decommissioned at San Diego, California, 23 April 1947. Reactivated during Korean War She recommissioned at San Diego 1 December 1950, and in January 1951 transferred from the Pacific Fleet to Commander, Service Force, Atlantic. She arrived Norfolk, her new home port, 20 February. Arctic operations Since assuming duties out of Norfolk, Preserver has performed salvage, rescue, and towing assignments along the Atlantic coast. From 1952 through 1962, she deployed annually for Arctic operations which took her to Greenland, Labrador, Newfoundland, and Nova Scotia as duty salvage ship. She also assisted in the MSTS resupply missions to Greenland. Supporting search for the Thresher In 1962 Preserver conducted towing operations to Mayport, Florida, and to Bermuda. She was then assigned to serve in the recovery fleet during the second manned orbital flight. From April through August 1963, she conducted Trieste support operations as the bathyscaph searched the ocean floor for , lost 10 April. The bathyscaph finally discovered debris that was definitely identified, and the search was concluded 5 September. Final operations Preserver with the sunken tanker Ocean Eagle off Puerto Rico, 1968. Further Atlantic Ocean operations were followed by a Mediterranean deployment February‚ÄìJune 1964. In March 1968 Preserver pumped out of the bow of Liberian tanker a cargo of oil that threatened major pollution of San Juan, Puerto Rico, harbour. She also extinguished a fire aboard British merchant vessel 11 April 1968 in San Juan Harbor. She then deployed to the Mediterranean 20 May 1968, returning to Little Creek, Virginia, 2 September. Into 1970 she continued to serve the Fleet as a salvage ship of Service Squadron 8 out of Little Creek, Virginia. In January 1986 she was tasked with leading the salvage and recovery efforts of the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. During the transit to Port Canaveral the ship recovered the nose piece of the external fuel tank. The Preserver was on station through April 1986. On 7 March 1986, divers from the USS Preserver using sonar located what they believed to be the crew compartment (confirming it during a dive the next day) and commenced recovery operations of the fallen astronauts. John Devlin made the confirmation dive to verify that the wreckage was in fact the crew compartment. On 9 March, NASA announced the finding to the press. The ship received a Navy Unit Commendation for the operation. She was decommissioned on 30 September 1986, and recommissioned the following year. After Hurricane Hugo, the Preserver was sent to Puerto Rico to aid in recovery of a sunken ship. The ship drove through Hugo en route to Guantanomo bay, Cuba where it picked up two barges loaded with telephone poles to take to Puerto Rico. It performed the first tandem tow in 40 years of US Naval history. The Preserver arrived safely at Puerto Rico and stayed there for nearly two months recovering a sunken vessel from the harbour. Final decommissioning Preserver decommissioned, 7 August 1992 and was transferred to the Maritime Administration (MARAD) for lay up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet, James River, Fort Eustis, Virginia, 1 February 1993. On 16 March 1994, she was struck from the Naval Vessel Register. Final Disposition: Preserver was moved to Bay Bridge Enterprises yard at Chesapeake, Virginia, 30 November 2005, for dismantling.

He was born and raised near Maclean in the Clarence River region of northern New South Wales. His hand-written war diary penned on the battlefields of the Western Front in 1916 is used by historians to retrace the experiences of Australian soldiers in World War I. World War I diggers of the 3rd Pioneer Battalion prepare to board HMAT Wandilla at Port Melbourne, bound for the Western Front. 6 June 1916 During World War I, Lyall Howard was known as a proud patriot. On 16 January 1916, at age 19, he signed up to the Australian Imperial Force. As regimental number 802, he was assigned to the 3rd Pioneer Battalion, earning a wage of eight shillings per day. Records show he had attempted to sign up on a previous occasion, but was rejected because his height of 157 cm was deemed too short. Private Lyall Howard left Port Melbourne aboard the HMAT Wandilla on 6 June 1916, and was shipped to the Western Front. He was assigned to work on the roads and bridges leading into the village of Cl√©ry, France. In the book, The Great War, author Les Carlyon details the experiences of Lyall Howard on the front line, captured by the handwritten notes in Lyall's war diary. The entries were always brief: \\"Shoved in old barn\\", \\"Inoculated again\\", \\"First day in trenches\\". One laconic entry underscored the horrors the soldiers faced: \\"Will wounded and dies\\". Will was Lyall's best friend. Meanwhile, Lyall's father, Walter Howard, enlisted as a private in the 55th Battalion of the 5th Division and was also transferred to the battlefields of Europe. Walter's battalion was moving in for an attack on P√©ronne. In an extraordinary situation of chance during the mass movement of troops near Cl√©ry, the father and son's paths crossed. Against the odds, Lyall and Walter met on the eve of the Battle of Mont St. Quentin in what has been described as a one-in-a-million handshake in the battle zone. An entry in Lyall Howard's diary, dated 30 August 1918, simply reads: \\"Met dad at Cl√©ry.\\" Lyall's son, the 25th Prime Minister of Australia, John Howard recounts: \\"There's just this pithy or laconic entry in the diary. It's just so Australian - 'Met dad at Clery'. They didn't verbalise their experience in the way men do now. It's one of the big changes in Aussie blokes. I think it's a good thing. They don't bottle it all up, but they did in those days.\\" In battle, Lyall Howard was wounded by a mustard gas attack in Passchendaele and spent 10 weeks in hospital. The gassing caused chronic bronchitis and skin rashes which would continue to plague him after the war. When World War I ended, Lyall returned to the Clarence River region in Northern New South Wales and worked as a fitter and turner for the Colonial Sugar Refining Company (CSR). The onset of the Great Depression brought hard economic times, and Lyall was retrenched. In 1925, he married an office worker, Mona Kell. Lyall and Mona Howard moved into a comfortable Californian-style bungalow at 25 William Street, Earlwood, a working class suburb of Sydney. Their first son, Walter (junior), was born in 1926, followed by Stanley (1929), Robert (Bob) (1936), and the youngest, John Howard in 1939. The copra trade In 1926, Australian Prime Minister Billy Hughes declared that he would make \\"New Guinea for the returned serviceman\\". He offered Australian ex-servicemen land parcels in New Guinea at very generous prices. Like many other ex-servicemen, Lyall Howard took up the offer and acquired two copra plantations on Karkar Island in New Guinea valued at the time at more than ¬£100,000 (over A$4 million in today's currency) where 200 native labourers worked. Two Australian companies, Burns Philp and the trading house W. R. Carpenter and Co Ltd managed many of the plantations on behalf of the ex-servicemen. The companies found that it was cheaper to pay the ex-servicemen a yearly rent to lease the land rather than purchase it themselves. The controversial but legal scheme became known as \\"dummying\\", and was common at the time. The Howard land holdings raised the attention of the Australian Administrator of New Guinea. In 1929, the Administrator sent a cable to the Investigation Branch (now known as ASIO) in Canberra: > \\"Walter and Lyall Falconer Howard apply consent purchase property valued at > ¬£25,000 and ¬£100,000 respectively. Strongly suspect dummies for Carpenter > and Coy. Could Investigation Branch enquire into status and financial > circumstances these men and report the result urgently?\\" In 1928, Commonwealth Auditor General, Sir John Latham, commissioned a report into the 'dummying' affair. Sir John concluded that, in the Howards‚Äô case, there is \\"no doubt whatever that dummying exists\\", but said \\"the offence is not so open and the pretence is better maintained\\" compared to other cases. With the assistance of Treasurer Ted Theodore, the Administrator pursued the Howard case for many more months, but eventually declared he was \\"satisfied with the bona fides of the Howards\\". Sir John Middleton, a former PNG MP and son of returned Australian serviceman planter Max Middleton said: :\\"It's nothing against Howard's father because everyone was doing it\\", \\"There was no disgrace in it. Dozens of people did it\\". Even a one-armed lift operator at Burns Philps' office in Sydney was a big plantation owner on paper.PNG coconut scam nets Howard's dad The Gold Coast Bulletin, Business weekend section 14 July 2007. Later life Dulwich Hill, where Prime Minister John Howard worked as a boy Lyall with his father Walter Howard owned two petrol stations where in later years John Howard worked as a boy. The first was located on the corner of Ewart Street and Wardell Road in Dulwich Hill. In 1938 they purchased a second, which they named Prince Edward Service Station, across the Cooks River on the corner of Permanent Avenue and Wardell Road in Earlwood. By the end of World War II, Lyall was strongly against appeasement, and an admirer of Winston Churchill. The turmoil of the 1949 Australian coal strike and subsequent petrol rationing caused difficulties for the two Howard family petrol businesses, a dispute which ended when the army was sent in to defeat the unions. Both Lyall and Mona Howard became enthusiastic supporters of the newly created Liberal Party of Australia, and celebrated the election night of 1949 which brought Prime Minister Robert Menzies to power, defeating the Labor government of Ben Chifley. When the election results were declared, Lyall built a bonfire in the backyard to burn his petrol rationing card. He later became a paid-up member of the Liberal Party. According to a Sydney Morning Herald report published on 7 January 1989, there were some suspicions in the Howard family that Lyall was a member of the New Guard, an unofficial paramilitary organisation active in the 1930s which stood for \\"unswerving loyalty to the Throne; all for the British Empire; sane and honourable government throughout Australia; suppression of any disloyal and immoral elements in government, industrial and social circles; abolition of machine politics, and maintenance of the full liberty of the individual.\\" Lyall's son Walter Howard disputes the claim. However, when interviewed by author Peter van Onselen about his father's involvement in the New Guard, another son, Bob, an academic and a member of the Australian Labor Party recalls Lyall defending New Guard activities, and said his father probably was a member of the New Guard. Lyall never recovered from the gassing on the battlefields of World War I. He died of chronic bronchitis in 1955, at the age of 59.

Breeding  Sir Peter Teazle was a brown horse bred and owned by Edward Smith-Stanley, 12th Earl of Derby. His sire Highflyer was on the Leading Sire list 16 times, producing 469 winners, seven of which won classic races. Highflyer also got the mare Prunella, and the sons Delpini, Diamond, and Traveller. Sir Peter Teazle's dam, Papillon, was by Snap, himself on the Leading Sire list four times and a great producer of raw speed. Papillon had some success as a racehorse, finishing third out of 22 in the 1773 Craven Stakes, losing to Firetail and Miss Timms. Sir Peter was her 7th out of 12 living foals, and one of several winners she produced, including the filly Lady Teazle (1781), who was second in The Oaks and won 11 races during her career. The name comes from a character in the classic comic play The School for Scandal. Racing career Sir Peter first came to the track at three, and continued the season undefeated. He won The Derby at his first start, a sweepstakes at Ascot, the 1,000 Guineas subscription race for his age group, and the Prince of Wales's Plate, before beating Bullfinch (by Woodpecker) in a 500 guineas match and winning again against Bullfinch by forfeit for a second match. He then won a 40 guineas subscription purse and a sweepstakes by walkover. At age four (1788) at Newmarket First Spring he won the Jockey Stakes, the rich Claret Stakes, and the Fortescue Stakes, twice beating Buzzard, and received a compromise in a scheduled match against Mentor. At Newmarket July he won the Grosvenor Stakes over two miles. In October at Newmarket he received a forfeit in a 700 guineas match against Mentor. He then suffered his first defeat, in a 500 guineas match against the Duke of Queensberry's four-year-old Florizel colt, Dash, giving Dash 32 pounds in weight; Sir Peter had had to stop training several days before the race because he had \\"got pricked in shoeing.\\" His final race of the year was a 300 guineas match against the good mare Maria (by Telemachus), which he won. He was seven for eight that season, his only loss one in which he was conceding gobs of weight.http://www.tbheritage.com/Portraits/SirPeterTeazle.htm His luck then turned, losing a 500 guineas match to Dash (by Florizel)‚Äîwho was carrying 32 lbs. less in weight‚Äîalthough this was possibly because Sir Peter was pricked during shoeing, and had to take several days off work before the race. He then defeated Maria (by Telemachus) in a 300 guineas match. He finished his four-year-old season with seven wins from eight starts. Sir Peter then won the Newmarket Craven, beating Meteor again. He then forfeited two races‚Äîa six- mile, 1,000 guineas match against Dash, and 500 guineas match against Meteor‚Äîprobably due to physical problems. Sir Peter then lost to Mulberry (by Florizel), who was carrying 28 lbs less, over the four mile Beacon course at Newmarket. He then broke down in a later race, and was retired to stud. Stud record Sir Peter stood at Derby's Knowsley Stud in Lancashire, where he had great success in the breeding shed. During this time, he sired a Doncaster Cup, four Epsom Derby winners, two Epsom Oaks winners, four St. Leger winners, and finished his career as the Leading Sires list nine times (1799‚Äì1802, 1804‚Äì1809).

This necessarily requires that the measurement process preserve the physical integrity of the measured system, and moreover places requirements on the relationship between the measured observable and the self-Hamiltonian of the system. In a sense, QND measurements are the \\"most classical\\" and least disturbing type of measurement in quantum mechanics. Most devices capable of detecting a single particle and measuring its position strongly modify the particle's state in the measurement process, e.g. photons are destroyed when striking a screen. Less dramatically, the measurement may simply perturb the particle in an unpredictable way; a second measurement, no matter how quickly after the first, is then not guaranteed to find the particle in the same location. Even for ideal, \\"first-kind\\" projective measurements in which the particle is in the measured eigenstate immediately after the measurement, the subsequent free evolution of the particle will cause uncertainty in position to quickly grow. In contrast, a momentum (rather than position) measurement of a free particle can be QND because the momentum distribution is preserved by the particle's self-Hamiltonian p2/2m. Because the Hamiltonian of the free particle commutes with the momentum operator, a momentum eigenstate is also an energy eigenstate, so once momentum is measured its uncertainty does not increase due to free evolution. Note that the term \\"nondemolition\\" does not imply that the wave function fails to collapse. QND measurements are extremely difficult to carry out experimentally. Much of the investigation into QND measurements was motivated by the desire to avoid the standard quantum limit in the experimental detection of gravitational waves. The general theory of QND measurements was laid out by Braginsky, Vorontsov, and Thorne following much theoretical work by Braginsky, Caves, Drever, Hollenhorts, Khalili, Sandberg, Thorne, Unruh, Vorontsov, and Zimmermann. Technical definition Let A be an observable for some system mathcal{S} with self-Hamiltonian H_{mathcal{S}}. The system mathcal{S} is measured by an apparatus mathcal{R} which is coupled to mathcal{S} through interactions Hamiltonian H_{mathcal{RS}} for only brief moments. Otherwise, {mathcal{S}} evolves freely according to H_{mathcal{S}}. A precise measurement of A is one which brings the global state of mathcal{S} and mathcal{R} into the approximate form :vert psi rangle approx sum_i vert A_i rangle_mathcal{S} vert R_i rangle_mathcal{R} where vert A_i rangle_mathcal{S} are the eigenvectors of A corresponding to the possible outcomes of the measurement, and vert R_i rangle_mathcal{R} are the corresponding states of the apparatus which record them. Allow time-dependence to denote the Heisenberg picture observables: :A(t) = e^{-i t H_mathcal{S}} A e^{+i t H_mathcal{S}}. A sequence of measurements of A are said to be QND measurements if and only if :[A(t_n),A(t_m)] = 0 for any t_n and t_m when measurements are made. If this property holds for any choice of t_n and t_m, then A is said to be a continuous QND variable. If this only holds for certain discrete times, then A is said to be a stroboscopic QND variable. For example, in the case of a free particle, the energy and momentum are conserved and indeed continuous QND observables, but the position is not. On the other hand, for the harmonic oscillator the position and momentum satisfy periodic in time commutation relations which imply that x and p are not continuous QND observables. However, if one makes the measurements at times separated by an integral numbers of half-periods (œÑ = kœÄ/œâ), then the commutators vanish. This means that x and p are stroboscopic QND observables. Discussion An observable A which is conserved under free evolution, :frac{mathrm{d}}{mathrm{d}t} A(t) = - frac{i}{hbar} [H_mathcal{S} , A ] = 0, is automatically a QND variable. A sequence of ideal projective measurements of A will automatically be QND measurements. To implement QND measurements on atomic systems, the measurement strength (rate) is competing with atomic decay caused by measurement backaction. People usually use optical depth or cooperativity to characterize the relative ratio between measurement strength and the optical decay. By using nanophotonic waveguides as a quantum interface, it is actually possible to enhance atom-light coupling with a relatively weak field, and hence an enhanced precise quantum measurement with little disruption to the quantum system. Criticism It has been argued that the usage of the term QND does not add anything to the usual notion of a strong quantum measurement and can moreover be confusing because of the two different meanings of the word demolition in a quantum system (losing the quantum state vs. losing the particle).

Dunton is above Cortez, Colorado, and 25 miles (some very tough and in the winter inaccessible) miles southwest of Telluride. Dunton was part of a homestead landed by Joe Roscio in the 1880s. Roscio came west from Minnesota to make his fortune in Colorado mining, and although he never struck it rich, he was successful. At the time Roscio started mining on the West Fork federal troops were kept busy \\"clearing\\" the area of resentful Ute Indians who had been hunting the area for centuries. The Smuggler Mine which Roscio started was a tipple style mine operation built on a very steep slope on the shady side of the river. Roscio and his wife had four (or more) children, and the male children went to work in the mine while they were adolescents, a common practice at the time. The boys were named Joe, Chuck, and Emilio (Mello). Given the feast-or-famine nature of mining, the family survived by trapping and logging and the young men learned at a young age they could make a living off the other miners by building and renting cabins, operating a bar and lodge, and by charging a nickel to use the hot springs. The three brothers (with the help of spouses) changed Dunton's name to Rancho Dolores and it was tremendously popular with families from the Four Corners region for 50 years. The first hot tub was formed by digging a pit approximately √ó , lining it with logs, and diverting the hot water source into it. The mineral content of the water was so high it shortly formed a smooth, copper-colored, mineralized coat evenly over the logs. Except for a short time in the 1930s, Dunton had no telephone service, and a line that had been run from Rico over the mountain proved impossible to maintain in winter. To the chagrin of the women and the pleasure of the men, the phone line was abandoned. Radio signals were virtually impossible to catch in the narrow valley, and television was never viewed at Dunton until the most recent incarnation of owners took over in the mid 1990s. The Roscios sold Dunton and its land in 1974 to a group of investors from Telluride and the East Coast. Dunton was a melting pot of local sheepherders, valley ranchers, reservation workers, Telluridians, and hippies making their way from Berkeley to Boulder. Traditional customers gave way to the new style of customer who enjoyed the hot springs and nude volleyball games in the rarefied air. In the 1990s, a group of German investors rumored to be affiliated with the Henkel family radically transformed Dunton from a bohemian way station with humble amenities to an exclusive resort marketed as \\"The #7 Luxury Hotel in the U.S.\\" In the 1970s the old cabins (most of which held skunk nests beneath and provided air conditioning via drafts flowing through the unchinked logs) were rented for $5.00 to $25.00 a night. Cabins in the new settlement now rent for over a thousand dollars a night.

It is the only oil refinery in New Zealand, and is operated by Refining NZ. The point was named after Samuel Marsden. The regional survey map shows it was called Marsden Point in 1907. The Marsden Point Oil Refinery from Mt Manaia on the opposite shore of Whangarei Harbour Tanker unloading at Marsden Point refinery, 2007 History Increasing demand for petrol and petroleum related products led the Nash Labour government to begin investigating the possibility of constructing an oil refinery. The site at Marsden Point was chosen for the oil refinery due to its location next to a deep water port, low risk of earthquakes, expanses of flat land and closeness to the population centres of the North Island. Construction of the refinery began in 1962. A consortium of the New Zealand Government contributed the initial NZ¬£10 million budget of the refinery. It was officially opened on 30 May 1964. In 1973, the government approved a NZ$160 million expansion of the refinery, involving the addition of a fluid catalytic cracker. Later that year, the first global oil shock, sparked by the Yom Kippur War, raised crude oil prices from US$3 to around US$20 a barrel - however, New Zealand retained reasonable security of supply. =Think Big= A second global oil shock in 1979, this time due to the Iranian revolution, greatly increased the price of oil again. This proved to be a catalyst for further expansion of the refinery, under the Muldoon National Governments Think Big energy projects. The estimated cost of expansion was $320 million, with a hydrocracker now considered rather than the planned catalytic cracker. In 1981, the expansion began and the government approving a pipeline to Wiri, south Auckland. A workforce of 5,000 worked on the expansion, which was by now expected to cost $1.55 billion. Strikes during the project led to the introduction of the Refinery Expansion Projects Dispute Act by the Muldoon government. An inquiry into the strikes and the governments' reactions to them followed. In 1985, the refinery shut down for five months for maintenance work on the old refinery. The project was completed in 1986, two years behind schedule and at a final cost of $1.84 billion. =Reform and privatization= Following the election of the reformist Fourth Labour Government in 1984, the Petroleum Sector Reform Act was introduced. This Act deregulated the petroleum industry, with 1,500 workers expected to lose their jobs. The Refinery assets were transferred by the Government to the New Zealand Refining Company Limited, a consortium of the five major petrol retailers. BP, Mobil and Z Energy are currently major shareholders. The Government injected $80 million to enable the company to adapt to the new environment. A major efficiency drive was launched to cut operating costs. Production The refinery uses a medium-sour blend of crude oil, nearly all of which is imported. Most crude oil produced in New Zealand is light-sweet and is exported to refineries in Australia. Marsden Point produces 70 per cent of New Zealand's refined oil needs, with the rest being imported from Singapore, Australia and South Korea. Crude oil bought by Marsden Point Oil Refinery is shipped to the deep-water port at Marsden Point, near Whangarei for refining into transport fuels for New Zealand.

The pipeline is 25 centimeters (10 inches) in diameter and transports petrol, diesel and jet fuel at up to 400,000 litres (105,669 US gallons) per hour.

The single species, Neobalanocarpus heimii, is a tropical hardwood tree. Common names for the tree and its wood products include chengal, chan ta khien, chi-ngamat, takian chan, and takian chantamaeo. The tree grows over tall. Chengal is considered the number one wood (classified as heavy hardwood) of Malaysia and export of logs is prohibited due to its scarcity. The species is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red list.  Distribution  Chengal tree, Peninsula Malaysia, 2005 Neobalanocarpus heimii is endemic to the Malay Peninsula and grows under quite a range of conditions of soils and topography in Peninsular Malaysia (and southern Thailand) from low flat semi-swamp to hills, but appears to thrive best on undulating land with light sandy soils. See Wildlife of Malaysia.100 Malaysian Timbers, published by Malaysian Timber Industry Board, 1986, p16/17 It is now extinct in Singapore, and possibly extinct in Thailand.  Description  Neobalanocarpus heimii can grow to be a large tree over 60 metres tall, with a straight, unbranched trunk, averaging 90cm in diameter, and with obvious supporting buttresses. Its simple, leathery leaves are arranged alternately, and are elliptical to lanceolate, between 7 to 17 cm in length, and 2.5 to 5cm in width. It is widespread in mixed dipterocarp forests, growing to altitudes up to , preferring soils that are friable and well-drained land.  Uses  Chengal house in the museum in Kuala Terengganu, 2005 Chengal in traditional Malay boatbuilding on Duyong Island, 2004 Chengal has been used for furniture making, house and boat-building. Despite its extreme strength and hardness, chengal is highly flexible before it is fully cured, making it suitable for plank bending (boatbuilding). It is also highly resistant to rot, fungi and mildew. In addition, chengal has a relatively low shrinkage ratio, (only inferior to teak) which makes it excellent for applications where it undergoes periodic changes in moisture. Chengal, like teak, has the unusual properties of being both an excellent structural timber for framing, planking, etc., while at the same time being easily worked and finished to a high degree. Chengal may be varnished but does not necessarily need a \\"finish\\". The wood naturally weathers to a silver-grey colour similar to teak. It can be easily planed, drilled or turned. Nailing is very difficult and the wood often has to be pre-drilled. = Durability = Chengal in a sawmill in Terengganu state, 2003 The timber is classified as naturally durable and is normally very resistant to termite attack and fungal infestation. Under graveyard test conditions, untreated specimens of size 50 mm x 50 mm x 600 mm lasted 9 years. Treated specimen of the same size and test conditions lasted about 19 years. Untreated railway sleepers of size 238 mm x 125 mm x 1,950 mm laid under severe environmental conditions gave an average service life of 19 years. Termites do not attack the sound timber.

The details of process were the subject of debate among several telecommunications companies, including Verizon Wireless, AT&T; Mobility, as well as the Internet company Google. Much of the debate swirled around the open access requirements set down by the Second Report and Order released by the FCC determining the process and rules for the auction. All bidding was required by law to commence by January 28.  Overview  Full-power TV stations were forced to transition to digital broadcasting in order to free 108 MHz of radio spectrum for newer wireless services. Most analog broadcasts ceased on June 12, 2009. The 700 MHz spectrum was previously used for analog television broadcasting, specifically UHF channels 52 through 69. The FCC ruled that the 700 MHz spectrum would no longer be necessary for TV because of the improved spectral efficiency of digital broadcasts. Digital broadcasts allow TV channels to be broadcast on adjacent channels without having to leave empty TV channels as guard bands between them.wireless.fcc.gov FCC on \\"Lower 700 MHz\\" All broadcasters were required to move to the frequencies occupied by channels 2 through 51 as part of the digital TV transition. =Precedents= A similar reallocation was employed in 1989 to expand analog cellphone service, having previously eliminated TV channels 70-83 at the uppermost UHF frequencies. This created an unusual situation where old TV tuning equipment was able to listen to cellular phone calls, although such activity was made illegal and the FCC prohibited the sale of future devices with that capability. =Prior auctions= Some of the 700 MHz spectrum licenses were already auctioned in Auctions 44 and 49. Paired channels 54/59 (lower-700 MHz block C) and unpaired channel 55 (block D) were sold and in some areas were already being used for broadcasting and Internet access. For example, Qualcomm MediaFLO in 2007 started using channel 55 for broadcasting mobile TV to cell phones in New York, San Diego, Atlanta, and elsewhere.MediaFlo live TV press release Qualcomm later ended the service and sold (at a large profit) channel 55 nationwide to AT&T; Mobility, along with channel 56 in the Northeast Corridor and much of California. Dish Network bought channel 56 (block E) licenses in the remainder of the nation's media markets, so far using it only for testing ATSC-M/H. , AT&T; does not appear to be using block D or E (band class 29) yet, but plans to use link aggregation for increased download speeds and capacity.http://www.fiercewireless.com/story/att-unveils-lte-phone- supports-700-mhz-spectrum-it-got-qualcomm/2014-07-15 Auction rules and process For the 700-MHz auction, the FCC designed a new multi-round process that limits the number of package bids that each bidder can submit (12 items and 12 package bids) and the prices at which they can be submitted, provides computationally intensive feedback prices similar to the pricing approach. This package bidding process (which is often referred to as combinatorial auctions) was the first of its kind to be used by the FCC in an actual auction. Bidders were allowed to bid on individual licenses or on an all-or- nothing bid which could be done up to twelve packages, which the bidder determined at any point in the auction. Doing the auction this way allowed the bidder to avoid the exposure problem when licenses are complements. The provisional winning bids are the set of consistent bids that maximize total revenues. The 700 MHz auction represented a good test-case for package bidding for two reasons. First, the 700 MHz auction only involves 12 licenses: 2 bands (one 10 MHz and one 20 MHz) in each of the 6 regions. Secondly, prospective bidders had expressed interest in alternative packaging because some Internet service providers had different needs and the flexibility would benefit them. The FCC issued Public Notice DA00-1486 adopted and described the package bidding rules for the 700 MHz auction. The FCC's original proposal allowed only nine package bids: the six 30 MHz regional bids and three nationwide bids (10, 20, or 30 MHz). Although these nine packages were consistent with the expressed desires or many prospective bidders, others felt that the nine packages were too restrictive. The activity rule is unchanged, aside from a new definition of activity and a lower activity requirement of 50%. A bidder must be active on 50% of its current eligibility or its eligibility in the next round will be reduced to two times its activity. Bids made in different rounds were treated as mutually exclusive and a bidder wishing to add a license or package to its provisional winnings must renew the provisional winning bids in the current round. The FCC placed rules on public safety for the auction. 20 MHz of the valuable 700 MHz spectrum were set aside for the creation of a public/private partnership that will eventually roll out to a new nationwide broadband network tailored to the requirements of public safety. The FCC offered the commercial licensee extra spectrum adjacent to the public safety block that the licensee can use as it wants. The licensee is allowed to use whatever bandwidth that is available on the public safety side of the network to offer data services of their own.  Google involvement  In an effort to encourage network neutrality, groups such as Public Knowledge, MoveOn.org, Media Access Project, along with individuals such as Craigslist founder Craig Newmark, and Harvard Law professor Lawrence Lessig appealed to the Federal Communications Commission to make the newly freed airways open access to the public. Prior to the bidding process, Google asked that the spectrum be free to lease wholesale and the devices operating under the spectrum be open. At the time, many providers such as Verizon and AT&T; used technological measures to block external applications. In return, Google guaranteed a minimum bid of $4.6 billion. Google's specific requests were the adoption of these policies: * Open applications: Consumers should be able to download and utilize any software applications, content, or services they desire; * Open devices: Consumers should be able to utilize a handheld communications device with whatever wireless network they prefer; * Open services: Third parties (resellers) should be able to acquire wireless services from a 700 MHz licensee on a wholesale basis, based on reasonably nondiscriminatory commercial terms; and * Open networks: Third parties (like internet service providers) should be able to interconnect at any technically feasible point in a 700 MHz licensee's wireless network. The result of the auction was that Google was outbid by others in the auction, triggering the open platform restrictions Google had asked for without having to actually purchase any licenses. Google was actively involved in the bidding process although it had no intentions of actually winning any licenses. The reason for this was that it could push up the price of the bidding process in order to reach the US$4.6B reserve price, therefore triggering the open source restrictions listed above. Had Google not been actively involved in the bidding process, it would have made sense for businesses to suppress their bidding strategies in order to trigger a new auction without the restrictions imposed by Google and the FCC. Google's upfront payment of $287 million in order to participate in the bidding process was largely recovered after the auction since it had not actually purchased any licences. Despite this, Google ended paying interest costs, which resulted in an estimated loss of 13 million dollars. The FCC ruled in favor of Google's requests. Only two of the four requirements were put in place on the upper C-Block, open applications and open devices. Google had wanted the purchaser to allow 'rental' of the blocks to different providers. In retaliation, Verizon filed a lawsuit against the Federal Communications Commission to remove the provisions Google had asked for. Verizon called the rules \\"arbitrary and capricious, unsupported by substantial evidence and otherwise contrary to law.\\"  Lawsuits  After the open access rules were implemented, Verizon Wireless filed suit against the FCC on September 13, 2007, seeking to have the rules dismissed on the grounds that the open access requirement \\"violates the U.S. Constitution, violates the Administrative Procedures Act ‚Ä¶ and is arbitrary, capricious, unsupported by the substantial evidence and otherwise contrary to law.\\"Verizon lawsuit On October 23, Verizon chose to drop the lawsuit after losing its appeal for a speedy resolution on October 3. However, the CTIA stepped in to challenge the same regulations in a lawsuit filed the same day.CTIA steps in On November 13, 2008, the CTIA dropped its lawsuit against the FCC.CTIA Drops Lawsuit Against FCC's Open Access Rules - PCWorld Business Center  Auction  The auction divided UHF spectrum into five blocks:700 MHzBand Plan * lower block A: 12 MHz bandwidth (698‚Äì704 and 728‚Äì734 MHz, TV 52 and 57) * lower block B: 12 MHz bandwidth (704‚Äì710 and 734‚Äì740 MHz, TV 53 and 58) * lower block E: 6 MHz bandwidth (722‚Äì728 MHz, TV 56) * upper block C: 22 MHz bandwidth (746‚Äì757 and 776‚Äì787 MHz, TV 60/61 and 65/66) * upper block D: 10 MHz bandwidth (758‚Äì763 and 788‚Äì793 MHz, TV 62 and 67) The FCC placed very detailed rules about the process of this auction of the 698‚Äì806 MHz part of the wireless spectrum. Bids were anonymous and designed to promote competition. The aggregate reserve price for all block C licenses was approximately $4.6 billion. The total reserve price for all five blocks being auctioned in Auction 73 was just over $10 billion. Results of the auction Auction 73 generally went as planned by telecommunications analysts. In total, Auction 73 raised $19.592 billion.http://wireless.fcc.gov/auctions/default.htm?job=auction_summary&id;=73 Notably, Verizon Wireless and AT&T; Mobility together accounted for $16.3 billion of the total revenue. Of the 214 approved applicants, 101 successfully purchased at least one license. Despite their heavy involvement with the auction, Google did not purchase any licenses. However, Google did place the minimum bid on Block C licenses in order to ensure that the license would be required to be open-access. The results for each of the five blocks: * Block A ‚Äì Verizon Wireless and U.S. Cellular both bought 25 licenses each. In this block, Verizon targeted urban areas, while U.S. Cellular bought licenses primarily in the northern portion of the U.S. Cavalier Telephone and CenturyTel also bought 23 and 21 licenses, respectively. * Block B ‚Äì AT&T; Mobility was the biggest buyer in the B block, with 227 licenses totaling $6.6 billion. U.S. Cellular and Verizon bought 127 and 77 licenses, respectively. AT&T; Mobility and Verizon Wireless bought licenses around the country, while U.S. Cellular continued with its strategy to buy licenses in northern regions. * Block C ‚Äì Of the 10 licenses in the C Block, Verizon Wireless bought the 7 that cover the contiguous 48 states (and Hawaii). Those seven licenses cost Verizon roughly $4.7 Billion. Of the other three, Triad Broadcasting bought the two covering Alaska, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, while Small Ventures USA L.P. bought the one covering the Gulf of Mexico. * Block D ‚Äì Amid some controversy, no licenses were sold in Block D because the reserve price was not met.Ethical Concerns Swirl Around D Block Spectrum Auction The FCC had set the reserve price on the spectrum at $1.3 billion, but the highest bidder (Qualcomm) only bid $472 million.http://www.informationweek.com/news/mobility/business/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=207400019&cid;=tab_art_tele This piece of spectrum remains unsold and has not been scheduled for another auction. * Block E ‚Äì EchoStar spent $711 million to purchase 168 of the 176 available Block E licenses. This block, made up of unpaired spectrum, will likely be used to stream television shows. Qualcomm also bought 5 licenses. After the end of Auction 73, there remained some licenses that either went unsold or were defaulted on by the winning bidder from Blocks A and B. A new auction, Auction 92, was held on July 19, 2011 to sell the 700 MHz band licenses that were still available. The auction closed on July 28, 2011,http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-11-1269A1.pdf with 7 bidders having won 16 licenses worth $19.8 million.http://wireless.fcc.gov/auctions/default.htm?job=auction_summary&id;=92  Interoperability issues Six years after the end of the auction of 700 MHz spectrum, block A remained largely unused, although T-Mobile USA began to deploy its extended-range LTE in 2015 on licenses purchased from Verizon Wireless and cleared of RF interference in several areas by TV stations changing off of channel 51. This delay was caused by technical issues which were regulatory and possibly anticompetitive in nature. After the March 2008 conclusion of Auction 73, Motorola initiated steps to have 3GPP establish a new industry standard (later designated as band class 17) that would be limited to the lower 700 MHz B and C blocks. In proposing band class 17, Motorola cited the need to address concerns about high-power transmissions of TV stations still broadcasting on channel 51 and the lower-700 MHz D and E blocks. As envisioned and ultimately adopted, the band class 17 standard allows LTE operations in only the lower-700 MHz B and C blocks using a specific signaling protocol that would filter out all other frequencies. Although band class 17 operates on two of the three blocks common to band class 12, band class 17 devices use more narrow electronic filters, which have the effect of permitting a smaller range of frequencies to pass through the filter. In addition, band class 12 and 17 signaling protocols are not compatible. The creation of two non-interoperable band classes has had numerous effects. Customers are unable to switch between a licensee deploying its service using band class 17 and a licensee that provides its service using band class 12 without purchasing a new device (even when the two operators use the same 2G and 3G technologies and bands), and band class 12 and 17 devices cannot roam on each other's cellular networks. When deploying its LTE network, C Spire Wireless decided not to use A block because of the lack of band-12 support in mobile devices, issues with roaming, and the increased cost of base stations due to lack of supply. US Cellular deployed a band class 12 LTE network, however not all of US Cellular's devices were able to access it. In particular, the iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C could not. Other wireless telecommunication providers launched LTE band class 12 networks, but have not been able to offer smartphones that access them, instead resorting to fixed or mobile wireless broadband modems. As of April 2015, only three telecom providers were offering smartphones that use band 12: US Cellular, T-Mobile USA, and Nex-Tech Wireless. While smaller US telecommunication providers were upset at the lack of interoperability, AT&T; defended the creation of band 17 and told the other carriers to seek interoperability with Sprint and T-Mobile instead. However, in September 2013, AT&T; changed their stance and committed to support and sell band-12 devices Following AT&T;'s commitment the Federal Communications Commission ruled: * AT&T; must fully deploy a Multi-Frequency Band Indicator (MFBI) software feature in its 700 MHz network within 24 months of September 30, 2013. The end of the 24-month period will also commence the beginning of the band-12-capable device rollout period. * Once MFBI has been fully implemented by AT&T;, AT&T; shall provide LTE roaming to carriers with compatible band-12 devices. * During the first year of the device rollout period, 50% of all new unique devices will be band-12 capable. * Commencing at the conclusion of the second year of the device rollout period, all new unique devices will be band-12 capable. Consistent with these commitments, AT&T; anticipates that its focus and advocacy within the 3GPP standards setting process will shift to band-12-related projects and work streams. AT&T; must place priority within the 3GPP RAN committee on the development of various band-12 carrier-aggregation scenarios. Upon completing implementation of the MFBI feature, AT&T; anticipates that its focus on new standards related to the paired lower-700 MHz spectrum will be almost exclusively on band 12 configurations, features and capabilities. Additionally, Dish Network agreed to lower its maximum effective radiated power levels on block E, which is on the lower adjacent channel to the downlink (tower-to-user transmissions) for block A. It did this in exchange for the FCC allowing it to operate the block as a one-way service, effectively making it a broadcast, although it could still be interactive through other means. Since Dish has already been experimentally operating it as a single-frequency network, this should not have a significant effect on whatever service it might offer in the future.

The show is best noted for its live episodes, which consist of the host painting while he runs on a treadmill; in addition, he sometimes takes calls from viewers, cooks food, plays ping pong, or makes blended drinks.Village Voice article: \\"Let's Paint!\\" The show's episode titles typically reflect whatever tasks are being undertaken, for example, Let's Paint, Exercise, and Play Ping Pong. Let's Paint TV was originally broadcast on Los Angeles Public- access television cable TV from 2001 through 2008; after the LA public access studios were shut down in early 2008, the show transitioned to being an online-only program. The program began receiving world-wide attention in 2006 when Kilduff began uploading video clips of his show to YouTube.Reuters article: \\"Multitasking artist shows how to do it all.\\" Show information John Kilduff conceived the idea for Let's Paint TV while working a different comedy Public-access show. He was waiting for a Saddam Hussein impersonator to arrive, and began thinking about his \\"exercise bike in the storage room, and I thought visually painting on an exercise bike could be interesting.\\"Ink KC article: \\"[YouTube's ‚ÄòLet's Paint TV' comes to KC].\\" He eventually decided that a treadmill would be more feasible for painting than an exercise bike. John Kilduff claims his aim with the series is to make people of all skill levels try their hand at painting or other forms of creative self-expression. Kilduff frequently encourages viewers to use very large brushes in order to cover the canvas as quickly as possible before worrying about details, as he feels an empty canvas can be very intimidating to novices. Although Kilduff says that show is meant to inspire creativity in others, many of the callers he gets tend not to take him seriously. As the show was once on Public-access TV, and is now on the internet, there is little to no censoring. The show also lacks caller screening. Many take advantage of this by expressing prejudice, cursing, accosting members of the show, and making derogatory comments about rival gangs. Despite the overwhelming number of prank callers, John generally continues to take calls. The sight of an artist simultaneously jogging, painting, blending drinks and chatting to guests and painting live models has led some to speculate that the whole show is an ironic piece of performance art. Kilduff denies this and states that he is completely sincere in trying to encourage people to do something creative.LA Weekly article: \\"The Joy of Painting Saddam - John Kilduff and Let's Paint TV - page 2.\\" =Terrestrial television run= The show originally began airing on Time Warner Public- access television in Los Angeles in 2001 and is now being seen in New York City and London. Clips of the show appeared on TV's Naughtiest Blunders in 2005 airing on England's ITV television network, and in 2008 on Whacked Out Videos. Let's Paint TV became more widely known in late 2006 when Kilduff began uploading recordings of episodes to the online video service YouTube, where it has since become a cult hit and increased his live show's viewership. =Transition to internet television= On December 6, 2008 the last episode of the Public-access TV version of Lets Paint TV was taped. The Public-access TV studios in the City of Los Angeles shut down on December 31, 2008. The show currently streams live Monday through Friday 11am-12:00pm PST on letspainttv.com.letspainttv.com page: \\"John Kilduff - Let's Paint! .\\" Reviews LA Weekly warmly reviewed the show, saying that \\"it jettisons the inverse snobbery of the Bob Ross tradition, assuming a sophisticated audience informed by the inescapable influence of Modernism and the indeterminate sincerity of post‚ÄìSaturday Night Live television. It turns out Let‚Äôs Paint TV is indeed a clever parody of Bob Ross and company, but ‚Äî like so much parody, from Don Quixote to the novelty music of Spike Jones ‚Äî this one turns out to be better art than that at which it pokes fun.\\" The Village Voice noted that \\"Kilduff makes the average multitasker look like a slacker.\\" CBS's Mancave Daily, using images of Kilduff throughout their article, spoke about Let's Paint TV and wrote, \\"it displays all that is wrong and entertaining about public access television\\". In revisiting Kilduff in 2014, they examined his broadcasting on YouTube and Stickam and his use of a treadmill for his multi- tasking, and observed \\"If this isn‚Äôt the epitome of public access television, I don‚Äôt know what is\\".

During the course of the game, the player uses a Formula One style car. The player has to drive the car as quickly as possible while navigating through turns and other vehicles on the road. A formal scoring system is not used; players are not ranked by position unlike most racing games. This kind of timekeeping would not be used in a subsequent video game until the release of the Taito Grand Prix: Eik≈ç e no License on the Family Computer the following year. Gameplay The absence of an authentic Formula One license made it difficult to research the actual Formula One machines of that time; players had to use generic two speed manual transmission machines. While using the regular tracks, the player must either match or beat the target time in order to move to the next level. Otherwise, a game over message will appear without revealing the final score of the game. Getting lower than the target time will score points that will lead to upgrades for his or her vehicle. All races are one lap only regardless of whether the track was custom built or previously designed. The gameplay is very similar to the Family Computer version of F1 Race and also Namco's Pole Position. Finishing in first, second, or third results in a podium finish; players must win on each track to advance to the next. Vehicles in the game have a generic two-speed manual transmission governing their speed (with a \\"LOW\\" setting and a \\"HI\\" setting).

It stars Alexz Johnson, Magda Apanowicz, Deanna Casaluce, and Miriam McDonald. Plot One night, two teenage friends Dominique (Alexz Johnson) and Ursula (Magda Apanowicz), wander in a graveyard, and when lightning strikes a tombstone, they discover a mysterious, blank book. The book has a message inside, granting power to those who write into it in exchange for the person's soul. Ursula keeps it, believing fate led her to find it, as they are bullied by cheerleaders, Heather (Miriam McDonald), Georgia (Deanna Casaluce) and Lisa. Ursula wishes harm on Heather, writing in the book to execute her desire of seeing Heather with broken legs. Meanwhile, Dominique, visits her late dad who died, and her mother, is often absent, working to pay the bills. Shortly, Heather's legs are broken by two cars in an apparent freak accident. Guiltless, Ursula attempts to prove the authenticity of the book to a skeptical Dominique, targeting Heather's boyfriend, Kyle, whose face becomes burned and blistered by a corrosive liquid upon falling down during a Chemistry class exam. Ursula grows pale and diabolical, and the book previously untitled now reads Ephemeris Diaboli. Dominique wants her to give up the book and seek out help, but Ursula objects. Lisa also eavesdrops on their conversation. Conducting a research, Dominique learns the book's Latin name is Devil's Diary in English and a book that only lands in the hands of the ambitious. At the hospital, Georgia and Lisa visit Heather, informing her about Ursula and the book. Dominique looks for help from a church minister, Father Mark Mulligan (Brian Krause), after finding out the ancient book is crafted by the Devil and manifests all evil written into it. Although doubtful about the book being real, he instructs Dominique to get Ursula away from it. Ursula continues to harm people. Heather's friends steal the book from Ursula, and Heather makes Georgia write that Ursula loses her teeth, hair and chokes on her own vomit, resulting in Ursula's death. Georgia betrays Heather writing to have her killed in a tragic accident. Heather dies in the hospital when a cord strangles her. Georgia has Lisa electrocuted and killed by a stage light for betraying her. After retrieving the book, Dominique rips pages and tosses it against a wall, and Georgia is sent smacking her head into a nearby wall before she dies. Soon attacked by her sexually abusive stepfather, Dominique writes in the book, hoping he dies. Frank stabs himself with a pair of scissors, Dominique is saddened to have sold her soul to the book in the process. She brings the book to Father Mulligan and he does not take it. Father Sanchez expresses more ambition and desire to take the book than everyone else before him, and after taking it, this leads to the book consuming him. Father Sanchez punishes Father Mulligan and tries to get Dominique to kill him in order to consummate their union. Instead, Dominique is able to wreck the book, and Sanchez dies in flames that engulf him. Six weeks later, Dominique is in a psychiatric hospital for obsessing over the book. She has a vision, showing two boys (Avan Jogia) and (Alexander Calvert) finding and taking the book that had been buried in a graveyard, triggering her fear that the cycle will begin again.

Masters Swimming Canada's role is to provide programs that are relevant to masters swimmers across Canada and to work with provincial bodies and clubs to implement those programs locally. Masters Swimming Canada's overarching goal is to enhance the swimming experience of its members and thereby expand participation in Masters Swimming. Masters Swimming Canada strives to meet the needs of all its members, from new swimmers to those who compete at the highest levels of Masters Swimming. The word \\"Masters\\" in Masters Swimming refers to age and not skill level. In Canada swimmers must be 18 years of age to register as a Masters Swimmer. Masters Swimming Canada's organization values are \\"Fun and Friendship, Health and Wellness, Participation and Achievement\\". Masters Swimming Canada is registered as a federally incorporated non-profit corporation and is governed by an elected board of directors. Registered Masters clubs are the voting members of the corporation. The board of directors acts as a policy-governance board with an executive director responsible for ongoing operations. It is a member of Swimming Natation Canada Inc., the national governing body for swimming in Canada. Programs =Competition= Competition, which includes short and long course pool competition as well as open water events, is just one component of Masters Swimming and in fact a large majority of Masters swimmers in Canada to not participate in official competitions. Masters Swimming Canada, through Swimming Canada, maintains the Canadian Masters Swimming Rule Book which governs all Masters swimming competitions in Canada. Masters Swimming Canada also maintains a calendar of all sanctioned competitions, a database of competitive results, the national rankings, and the Canadian national Masters records. Masters Swimming Canada organizes the annual Canadian Masters Swimming Championships. A bidding process is conducted each year leading to the selection of a local organizing committee. =Million Metre Challenge= The Million Metre Challenge is a Masters Swimming Canada program that allows swimmers to track their training by recording the number of metres swum in each workout online. As swimmers reach various milestone distances they receive recognition and awards. The program also has components involving total metres swum by clubs and virtual swims where individual and club metres achieved are plotted on maps. Swimmers can log distances by strokes, kicking, and drills, or just by total metres, and can record further specifics or notes. History Masters Swimming is a club-based organization that maintains a list of all Masters clubs in the country, and oversees structured swimming programs for adults which include competitions in pools or open water. Its primary objectives include fun, fitness, friendship and participation. The history of swimming as a sport and a fitness activity for adults was stimulated just over a century ago with the rebirth of the Olympic Games, the growth of \\"leisure time\\" among certain components of society and the recognition of the relationship between exercise and health, quality of life, etc. Adult fitness swimming became popular in Europe, particularly in Germany, in the early part of the last century. The Germans, realizing the value of swimming for fitness, rebuilt their adult swim programs after the devastation of World War II. The YMCA also became supportive of aquatic fitness at this time and built pools in many of their larger facilities where they encouraged adult lane swim. Until \\"the Y\\" introduced circle swimming in the thirties, only two swimmers could swim per lane. The Y also introduced the idea of putting a line on the bottom of the pool under the centre of each lane to help the swimmer swim straight and avoid collisions. It is likely that the idea of a structured adult swimming fitness organization was introduced by the Germans to members of the United States and other occupying forces after the second world war, as it was primarily through the US military that this idea was first introduced into the Americas. Foremost among those involved was Captain Ransom J. Arthur, M.D., who by his leadership and commitment to improving the health of adults through swimming established the first Masters swimming programs in the US. It is believed that he first used the term \\"Masters\\" swimming to describe the sport around 1960. The first Masters competitions in the Americas took place in the US during the sixties. These were local, often very small and by today's‚Äô standards, quite unprofessional. The first US Masters National Championship took place on May 2‚Äì3 May 1970 at Amarillo, Texas with 46 competitors. It was agreed at this time to set up a national Masters organization to be called United States Masters Swimming. They held their first annual meeting at Lake Placid, NY in 1971 and Arthur was elected President. The US swimming community, consisting of the children and youth swim clubs, the college swim programs and the state and national elite swimming programs, were not impressed with this development and basically wanted to have nothing to do with Masters swimming. This was probably a good thing as it allowed US Masters to develop their own parallel organization to USA Swimming and take full responsibility for their sport. As time went on it became clear that Masters were contributing greatly in a number of ways to aquatics in the US. The first Canadians to become involved were Professor Hud Stewart of Osgoode Hall Law School, a Canadian track and field Olympian who had become keenly interested in adult fitness, and his friend Al Waites, entered the second US Masters National Championship, again at Amarillo, on May 7 and May 8, 1971 with 106 US swimmers. Hud was so impressed with this development that on his return to Toronto he established Canada‚Äôs first Masters Club, \\"The University of Toronto Masters\\" swimming at Hart House and consisting primarily of University staff but including some older students who were not on the University swim teams.

In 1992, BYU issued a statement limiting academic freedom in certain areas, including language that attacked The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and language that violates the university's honor code. Since this statement was released, the University has received continued accreditation from the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities, which specifically approved of the new statement, as it was typical of many religious institutions. In 1997, the American Association of University Professors (with a membership of about 47,000) criticized BYU based on the wording of the new statement, as well as then recent controversies involving several professors allegedly denied their academic rights. Cecilia Konchar Farr, David Knowlton, Gail T. Houston, were among the more notable controversies, although BYU has stated that these professors' discharge was based on issues other than academic speech. On another side of the issue James D. Gordon III, one of the key administrators in the 1990s issues, has argued that there is institutional academic freedom, the ability of an academic institution to define its goals and objectives, and that a private institution like BYU should be fully free to pursue such.James D. Gordon III, Brigham Young University Studies, Vol. 49, issue 2 Academic freedom issues Looking North from the Kimball Tower toward Mount Timpanogos =University standards= In a 1971 speech to a BYU faculty group, Martin B. Hickman, then the dean of BYU's College of Social Sciences, argued that the decision to join the BYU faculty reflected an acceptance of the values of the university and thus anyone who joined the faculty with this proper mindset would not have any academic freedom issues while there.Ernest L. Wilkinson, ed., Brigham Young University: The First 100 Years. Vol. 4, p. 63 In 1992, the university drafted a new Statement on Academic Freedom. After receiving comment from faculty and others, the document was implemented by BYU administrators on September 14, 1992. This document specified that: \\"Because the gospel encompasses all truth and affirms the full range of human modes of knowing, the scope of integration for LDS scholars is, in principle, as wide as truth itself.\\" However, citing BYU's role as a religious institution, the document allowed limitations to be placed upon \\"expression with students or in public that: # contradicts or opposes, rather than analyzes or discusses, fundamental Church doctrine or policy; # deliberately attacks or derides the Church or its general leaders; or # violates the Honor Code because the expression is dishonest, illegal, unchaste, profane, or unduly disrespectful of others. \\"...The ultimate responsibility to determine harm to the University mission or the church, however, remains vested in the University's governing bodies‚Äîincluding the University president and central administration and, finally, the board of Trustees.\\" Also in 1992, the university began including a clause in its faculty contracts requiring LDS faculty to \\"accept the spiritual and temporal expectations of wholehearted Church membership\\". In 1993, contracts further required LDS faculty to \\"maintain standards of conduct consistent with qualifying for temple privileges\\" (referring to entry into LDS temples, for which one must meet standards of activity and behavior in the LDS Church). In 1996, LDS faculty were required, as a condition of employment, to obtain the yearly endorsement of their local ecclesiastical leaders certifying that the faculty were temple-worthy. BYU does not allow off-campus groups to use the campus for protests or demonstrations. On-campus groups and students must apply for a permit. =Northwest Association= In 1996, the Northwest Association of Schools and of Colleges and Universities (the \\"Northwest Association\\") reviewed the University's academic freedom statement and renewed its accreditation. The Northwest Association specifically approved the University's academic freedom statement. Such accreditation standards permit \\"religious colleges and universities to place limitations on academic freedom so long as they publish those limitations candidly.\\" THE ISSUE OF ACADEMIC FREEDOM: AN INTERVIEW WITH JIM GORDON In addition, the Northwest Association investigated \\"almost all\\" of the allegations that the AAUP had asserted regarding other individuals, concluding that the University had not violated academic freedom. =American Association of University Professors= BYU's academic freedom policies have been criticized by the American Association of University Professors (AAUP). In 1997, they issued a report documenting the cases of several professors, concluding \\"that infringements on academic freedom are distressingly common and that the climate for academic freedom is distressingly poor.\\" The AAUP report also contained, as an appendix, a response authored by the BYU administration, which argued that BYU had the right to limit academic freedom in order to preserve the religious character of the school, a right implied by a 1940 AAUP statement and generally followed until 1970. In particular, BYU compared itself to Gonzaga University, a Jesuit institution which prohibited \\"open espousal of viewpoints which contradict explicit principles of Catholic faith and morals.\\" BYU also stated that the academic freedom judgement process lacked transparency and objectivity. The AAUP's decision remained, however. In 1965, the AAUP had stated that \\"satisfactory conditions of academic freedom and tenure now prevail at Gonzaga.\\" In 1970, the AAUP had adopted a statement of Interpretive Comments in which the AAUP had stated, \\"Most church-related institutions no longer need or desire the departure from the principle of academic freedom implied in the 1940 Statement, and we do not endorse such a departure\\". In 1998, the AAUP voted to censure BYU, which remains on a list of censured institutions together with 46 other universities. The AAUP's refusal to accommodate religiously affiliated institutions of higher learning in connection with desires to protect religious traditions in line with its own 1940 statement - in contrast to that accommodation by the Northwest Association - has been criticized. =Case studies= Soon after adopting their statement on academic freedom in 1992, BYU took actions which some have viewed as related to the implementation of the new academic freedom policy. For example, in late 1992, the university's board of trustees vetoed without comment a BYU proposal to invite Pulitzer Prize winner and Harvard University professor Laurel Thatcher Ulrich, an active feminist, to address the annual BYU Women's Conference.Wilson, Robin. (March 24, 2006). \\"A Well-Behaved Scholar Makes History.\\" The Chronicle of Higher Education. v. 52 (29), page A12. Since that time Laurel Thatcher Ulrich has been invited and spoken at BYU including as recently as 2017. In some cases since 1992, the University has dismissed, denied continuing status, or censured faculty members who have taken critical positions relating to official church policy or leadership as well as those who for personal reasons did not pay a tithe to the LDS Church. In 1993, BYU revoked the continuing status to Cecilia Konchar Farr, who had publicly advocated a pro-choice position on abortion. Farr was hired as an English instructor and some felt her positions of pro-choice were irrelevant to her assignment with the school. David Knowlton, who had discussed the church's missionary system at an independent Mormon forum, as well as making disparaging remarks about LDS architecture did not have his contract renewed. Officially, BYU spokespeople generally framed the actions in the cases of Farr, Knowlton, and Houston as relating to the quality of the professors' scholarship, and sometimes to unspecified misbehavior, rather than the controversial content of the affected professor's academic activities. In 1996, BYU dismissed Gail T. Houston, an English professor, despite positive votes from her English Department and the College Committee. One of the reasons for this action was her advocacy of prayer to Heavenly Mother.Times and Seasons peace on removal of Houston Also in 1996, professor Brian Evenson resigned in protest after receiving a warning from BYU administration over some violent images in one of his short stories. Nevertheless, some critics viewed these dismissals as a kind of purge. Some of the professors dismissed for academic reasons claim that their publishing credentials were stronger than many of their colleagues. In 2006, part-time faculty instructor Jeffrey Nielsen's contract was not renewed after he wrote an op-ed piece in the June 4 Salt Lake Tribune which criticized and opposed the LDS Church's stance on same-sex marriage. Also in early 2006, BYU discontinued the contract of Darron Smith, another part-time faculty instructor. Smith was one of the few African Americans teaching on BYU campus. He claims that his contract was not continued because he called for the LDS Church to address lingering issues of racism. Smith was co-editor of the book Black and Mormon, which has received favorable reviews. Although Smith was let go, Gordon B. Hinckley, then president of the LDS Church, made public statements against racism shortly thereafter. In 2011, BYU placed physics professor Steven E. Jones on paid leave in connection with an internal investigation that a paper he authored on the causes finding that the World Trade Center towers fell on 9/11 because of pre-set explosives might not have met \\"scientific standards of peer review\\" and his failure of \\"appropriately distancing himself\\" from the University in his statements regarding his explosive theory. Mr. Jones accepted early retirement while the investigation was in its early stages. In February 2012 Randy L. Bott made controversial racial statements that appeared in The Washington Post where Bott pointed to a passage in Mormon scripture that suggested to him that Cain's descendants were marked with dark skin and were prohibited from holding the priesthood. These statements were censured or condemned by BYU Administrators and the LDS Church and the Professor retired from BYU shortly thereafter.

Description This is a deciduous tree with a straight, gray trunk that can measure up to 30 metres tall. Its leaves are ovate, ovate-cordate or lanceolate in shape, with conspicuous primary veins and serrated edges. The greenish flowers are unisexual and inconspicuous. Distribution The ruil grows between 37 ¬∫ 05 and 37 ¬∫ 50 'south latitude, in the provinces of Talca and Cauquenes, in an area of about 100 square kilometres, but in a total area in 1991 totaled over 3.5 km2. According to 1988 studies, the species is scattered in about 185 land-holdings, each of which have one or two hectares and are surrounded by commercial plantations of Pinus radiata (an introduced species), and agricultural croplands and livestock for survival, hindering the expansion of its habitat.

It is very promising as a forestry tree in Western Great Britain and regenerates easily after coppicing.Huxley. A. 1992 The New RHS Dictionary of Gardening. MacMillan Press 1992 Young tree  Frost hardiness study in Britain  Provenance sources from different places from its natural environment were tested in cultivation at the Bush estate in Scotland. Seedlots of Nothofagus alpina and Nothofagus obliqua were tested. The results of the testing in relation to the sources were reported as: * √ëuble in Chile. This was the most equatorial source and these seedlots proved to be the most susceptible to frost. * Neuquen in Argentina. These seedlots, as well as those gathered from mature trees growing in Britain with origins from Malleco in Chile were the most hardy. Overall, Nothofagus alpina performed better than Nothofagus obliqua. Past temperature records for Britain suggest that seedlots run a high risk of suffering severe frost damage in all but mild coastal regions, and that spring and autumn frosts may be more damaging than winter frosts.M.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Description and history The Columbia Bridge stands in southeastern Lemington and northwestern Columbia, both rural communities in the northern parts of their respective states. It carries Columbia Bridge Road between United States Route 3 in New Hampshire and Vermont Route 102 in Vermont. It is in a rural agricultural setting, and is oriented northwest-to-southeast across the Connecticut River, on abutments of dry laid stone that have been faced in concrete. It is a wood-iron Howe truss design, with a single span that is long. The bridge has a total width of and a roadway with of , and an internal clearance of . The exterior is sheathed in vertical board siding, which extends a short way into each portal to protect the truss ends. The siding on the north side rises to a height of , leaving an open space between it and the gabled roof. The bridge was built by Charles Babbitt in 1912, replacing one destroyed by fire the previous year, and is the third to stand on the site. The bridge is considered to be one of the last built in either state during the historic period of covered bridge construction. It was rehabilitated by the state of New Hampshire in 1981 at a cost of $143,000.

His classmates included future admirals Chuichi Nagumo and Nishiz≈ç Tsukahara.http://homepage2.nifty.com/nishidah/e/px36.htm#v005 He served his midshipman duty on the cruiser Soya, battleship Katori and cruiser Hashidate, and as an ensign on the battlecruiser Ikoma and Sagami. He subsequently served in the Personnel Department of the Navy Ministry, specializing in legal affairs and accounting. However, realizing that the key to promotion in the navy was via command of a vessel, he requested a transfer as a lieutenant commander in 1925 to a submarine tender, and was appointed XO of the Jingei.http://pwencycl.kgbudge.com/S/h/Shimizu_Mitsumi.htm Pacific War Online Encyclopedia After being sent to Europe and the United States in 1929, he was promoted to commander in 1929, and became captain of the cruiser Tama in 1931. In November 1934, he received command of the battleship Ise, and in 1935 became Chief of staff of the Sasebo Naval District.http://www.axishistory.com/index.php?id=7856 He was promoted to rear admiral the same year. He became a vice admiral in 1939. In June 1940, Shimizu was appointed commander in chief of the IJN Training Fleet. However, in July 1941, he was transferred to take command of the IJN 6th Fleet, which consisted of the Japanese submarine forces. He was serving in this capacity during the attack on Pearl Harbor, and authorized the midget submarine force which attempted to penetrate American defenses at the start of the attack.Boyd, The Japanese Submarine Force and World War II pages 61-80 On 1 February 1942, an American task force raided Kwajalein, Wotje, and Maloelap in the Marshall Islands, sinking three ships, damaging eight, and destroying numerous airplanes and ground facilities. Enterprise received only minor damage in the Japanese counterattack, and for his failure to sink the aircraft carrier with his submarines, Shimizu was reassigned in July 1942 to take command of the IJN 1st Fleet. The IJN 1st Fleet consisted of the Japanese battleship fleet, and was held in reserve waiting for the \\"decisive battle\\" under the Japanese kantai kessen doctrine, so the transfer meant that Shimizu was removed from front line service. However, on 8 June 1943, while anchored in Kure harbor, the Japanese battleship Mutsu exploded and sank in an accident. Shimizu was forced to accept responsibility, and retired from active service on 21 February 1944.

It is evergreen and grows up to 40 m tall. It is a common constituent of the laurisilva forests of Madeira and the Canary Islands. Leaf fossils of this species are known from the Mio-Pleistocene of Madeira Island.  Description  Ocotea foetens is endemic to Macaronesia. Like the other species of the genus Ocotea, it is rich in essential oils, which give an unpleasant odor to the wood when freshly cut (hence the name foetens, Latin for smelly, stinky, disgusting, unpleasant). It is rarely used as an ornamental. It is an evergreen tree generally up to in height, although some specimens may reach . It commonly grows with multiple trunks branched from the base. The bark is rough and irregular, and dark in colour; the young branches are angular, with smooth bark, sometimes reddish in areas of recent growth. The wood is dark and hard. The leaves are about long and wide, oblong-lanceolate to almost elliptical, acuminate at the apex and slightly indented at the base. In adult plants, the leaves are leathery in texture, glossy on both sides, darker green on the upper surface, with 2(-4) small gland-like depressions on the underside near the base. The petioles are short (up to in length). The flowers of both sexes are white, with splashes of green and pale yellow, releasing a slight odor. The perianth has six components, and there are nine stamens. The predominant flowering season is from June to August (northern hemisphere). The fruit is a berry, hard and fleshy and about long, its lower half covered by a dome, giving it a look similar to an acorn. The fruit is dark green, gradually darkening with maturity. The fruit has a single seed wrapped in a hard coat. When the fruits fall they separate from the dome. Germination is favored by moisture and light. Ecology Ocotea foetens is endemic to Madeira and the Canary Islands, appearing in laurel forest habitat, generally between 400 and 1400 m altitude. In the Canary Islands it is not present on Lanzarote or Fuerteventura. In the archipelago of Madeira it is absent from Porto Santo. In Azores Islands it is an introduced species. It is the only Paleoendemic Ocotea species in the wetter relict forest areas of Macaronesia. Its berries are consumed mostly by the endemic Madeiran pigeon Columba trocaz. Folklore Ocotea foetens was sacred to the Bimbaches, the older inhabitants of El Hierro in the Canary Islands, and was one of their symbols. The legend states that the \\"Garo√©\\" was a large laurel tree that assured the life of the Bimbaches, providing them with water in sufficient amounts for their survival. The islands are located where tradewinds occur, and water from clouds condensed on the branches of the tree and it later poured rain around the island. One of many legends says that the water originating from the tree was led to a hole from which the Bimbaches could provide water. The original tree fell in a storm in 1610. In 1957, a replacement was planted in the same location as the Garo√©. It has been growing and is surrounded by mosses.

Yorgason. It stars Trevor Howard and Nick Ramus. Plot Windwalker is an aged Cheyenne warrior. As a young husband and father, he watched helplessly as his wife, Tashina, was killed and one of his twin sons kidnapped during a raid by rival Crow warriors. After many years of searching for this son, Windwalker dies during the winter of 1797 in what will become the state of Utah. After Windwalker's funeral, his remaining son, Smiling Wolf, leads his family south to rejoin the rest of the tribe; on the way they are attacked by a band of Crow warriors and after fighting them off, Smiling Wolf is badly injured and the family is forced to hide. The Great Spirit reawakens Windwalker, and after battling the forces of nature and his own physical frailty, he rejoins his family. Using Cheyenne medicine to heal Smiling Wolf's wounds, Windwalker leads the family to a sacred Cheyenne hiding cave. From there, he and Smiling Wolf's two young sons prepare booby traps for the Crow raiding party, all of which work perfectly, leaving only the raiding party leader and one other warrior. The Crow warrior is captured and taken to the cave, where he is revealed to be Windwalker's long-lost son. With his family safe and his son restored to him, Windwalker confronts his old enemy and offers him peace, but the Crow refuses, forcing a final battle. The restored son fights the Crow leader in his father's place and is victorious. With his family safe and restored, Windwalker is now free to proceed to the afterlife, where he is reunited with Tashina. Main cast *Trevor Howard ... Windwalker *Nick Ramus ... Smiling Wolf/Crow Brother/Narrator *James Remar ... Windwalker as a young man *Serene Hedin ... Tashina *Dusty McCrea ... Dancing Moon *Silvana Gallardo ... Little Feather *Emerson John ... Spotted Deer *Bart the Bear ... The Bear (film debut) Production and release Windwalker was shot in various outdoor locations in Utah including the Wasatch Mountains. To maintain authenticity to the story, the film's dialogue is subtitled in English with Cheyenne and Crow languages spoken. Chief Dan George was tapped to play Windwalker but became ill, apparently leading Merrill to ask Trevor Howard, an English actor, to take the role. James Remar was already slated to play the main character as a young man. Thus, while indigenous languages were used to attempt a sense of authenticity, both young and old Windwalker were played by white actors.

A student will generally select an elective \\"sub\\"-internship, where the student will perform the role of an intern or first year medical graduate, under the supervision of senior house staff and attending physicians. The rotation is generally pursued in the field appropriate to career interest. For example, a sub-I can be taken in Internal Medicine, Surgery, Pediatrics, or Obstetrics and Gynecology. In this way, the student can experience a glimpse of their future career without the burden of full responsibility. Additionally, many medical students select sub- internships at institutions where they wish to apply for residency; such rotations are \\"auditions\\" for the student to demonstrate his or her commitment to the outside program.  Internal medicine sub-I; a.k.a. Internal medicine AI  At the turn of the 21st century ninety-eight percent of US medical schools offered an internal medicine sub-I a.k.a. (AI) to medical students. In general the following responsibilities are given to a sub-I student: accept and give sign-out of all patients on the team, assess assigned patients before morning rounds, write problem oriented notes daily on all patients, admit patients on call days, act as information liaison between the medical team and hospital staff, communicating plan of care to patient. Responsibilities that are generally limited or withheld include: writing orders or prescriptions, performing major procedures, obtaining consent from patients for procedures or surgeries. A recent editorial highlighted the changing role of the subinternship (SI) in the medical school curriculum: It has been argued that the SI should be viewed as the culmination of a coordinated 4-year program of study in clinical care, with an aim to prepare fourth-year students for the demanding experience of internship. Ideally, the educational goals of the SI should complement and expand upon those outlined in the third-year clerkship and ought to uniquely emphasize the knowledge and skills needed to independently treat and manage acutely ill inpatients. To facilitate these goals, it has been recommended that SI programs place fourth-year students in a role that completely replaces the intern, albeit under the supervision of senior house staff. In particular, it has been recommended that subinterns should *have a dedicated coordinator of educational activities *be provided with an explicit set of learning objectives *have separate conferences which focus on patient management issues *be able to write medical orders that are cosigned by a physician *participate in supervised cross-coverage Despite the valuable and distinctive experience of the SI, it has been neglected by medical educators and researchers as an area needing development and standardization. At an organizational level, the SI currently lacks the clearly defined curricular goals and rigorous evaluation methodologies found in the third-year clerkship. Nevertheless, it is unclear to what extent individual medical schools have addressed the unique educational needs of the SI. In an attempt to clarify the structure and requirements of internal medicine SI programs throughout the United States, a survey study was undertaken.
