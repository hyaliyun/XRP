The miners' gears were hung back up for the filming of Le Brasier. The Couriot pit site covers an area of 1 if the slag heaps are included). It is the best preserved remnant and the most comprehensive showing of the coal activity of the area. The facilities situated above ground responded to the need to circulate men, coal and equipment in the same limited space. In order to manage traffic flow near the pit, the site was organized under a system of platforms where former quarries used to be. Washing rooms and sorting plants were installed on the lower platform called the \\"pl√¢tre\\"(the plaster) and were demolished in 1969. For the most part, the buildings of the intermediary platform, which have been preserved, date back to the First World War (administrative buildings, boiler room, former lamp room, engine room and the \\"petit lavabo\\" (the small washroom)) and to the post-war era (\\"grand lavabo\\" and lamp room of 1948). In its most recent configuration, the pit could accommodate nearly 2,000 miners and several hundred workers every day. The site was the head office of the Soci√©t√© Anonyme des Mines de la Loire. It was the largest pit of the area until the 1930s and remained the western sector headquarters after the 1946 nationalisation .  Site history  Located west of Saint-√âtienne, the site is located within the perimeter of the old town of Montaud, then split with the ephemeral town of Beaubrun (1842‚Äì1855) which is finally integrated in Saint-√âtienne in 1855. Certified since the 18th century, coal mining in this area is due to the presence of an anticline bringing three shallow exploitable layers to the surface (the first, second and third layers of the Beaubrun part of the pit). The rugged terrain of the area of the old locality known as the Clapier reflects the previous exploitation of the outcrops of these coal layers. These old quarries have also provided the sandstone needed to create underground work (called overturned bleachers) until the 1930s. Around 1810, the activity seemed restricted when compared to Villars', east of Saint- √âtienne (beyond the Furan) in Saint-Jean-Bonnefonds and especially the Gier Valley which then produces nearly half of the domestic coal production. At that time, the area of Beaubrun is known in the official documents to be partly exploited and its former works, which sometimes resulted in deadly floods, made it difficult to exploit.  The 1840s Beaubrun plot  It was around 1840, with the development of the first railway junction from Saint- √âtienne to Montrambert, that mining activity has sustainably grown in this sector. The Beaubrun plot was run by three small companies: In the south, the Compagnie des Mines Ranchon: Mining company bordering the Tardy neighbourhood (now rue Vaillant Couturier). It owned a pit and a split. To the west, the Compagnie Parisienne is a smaller company (two new pits which were then in the process of being dug). In the southwest, near the present location of the Couriot pit, the Mines Grangette; grouping the pits Basses-villes 1 and 2 , Hautes-villes 1 and 2, Culatte 1 and 2 and Clapier 1 and 2 (scene of a disaster in 1839 which provoked a flood and its subsequent desertion for several decades) . The current location of the Couriot pit was then occupied by the Clapier castle. This small company subsequently joined other companies to found the Compagnie des Houill√®res de Saint-√âtienne in 1845 in order to counteract the irresistible rise of the Compagnie G√©n√©rale des Mines de la Loire after a merger between various companies from Rive-de-Gier. The CHSE was eventually absorbed in September 1845 by the great Compagnie G√©n√©rale des Mines de la Loire.  1854‚Äì92: The Beaubrun Company  In 1854 Napoleon III dissolved the monopoly. A small company, the Compagnie des Mines Beaubrun ran the plot consisting of half a dozen old pits, among which the Ch√¢telus pit (founded in 1850 by the Compagnie des Mines de la Loire). It is the result of the two great neighboring companies running two coal veins situated on each sides of the Malacussy underground rift which cuts the plot in two. Its capital is partly owned by these powerful neighbors: The S.A. des Mines de la Loire which runs more concessions to the North and the Soci√©t√© Anonyme des Mines de Montrambert and la B√©raudi√®re in the South. Both societies were the result of the division of the monopoly and each owned a portion of the capital of the Beaubrun Company. In 1857, Clapier Station was inaugurated and the rail workaround of the western part of Saint-√âtienne provided new uses for the coal extracted in Beaubrun. A key element that would later make the site the main place of extraction. Around 1860, the old Clapier castle was demolished along with the hamlet of Clapier. The Ch√¢telus pit was connected to the old Clapier pit and 5th layer was explored but the digging of a new pit was required. The digging of a new pit named Ch√¢telus 2 started in 1870. In 1887, a huge explosion of coal dust in the area between Ch√¢telus 1 and Culatte caused the death of 79 miners. The event made the headlines, the emotion was great and the damage was substantial: the pit was therefore closed. On 3 June 1893, the small company was eventually absorbed by the Mines de la Loire, under the influence of Henry Couriot who probably saw development opportunities in the plot strategic position and stocks. The Ch√¢telus pit in Saint-√âtienne in 1880.  The new head office of the S.A. des Mines de la Loire  After the dissolution of the Compagnie des Mines de la Loire by Napoleon III in 1854, the S.A. des Mines de la Loire inherited the CML name, its debts and its Northwest plots. 1892‚Äì1893: it assimilated the Beaubrun Company and started working again (restarting Ch√¢telus and modernising the sorting plants). The company began in 1907 to design a new generation pit named Ch√¢telus 3, which later became known as the Couriot pit. The pit was created to mine a vein of coal destined for coke named the \\"8th Gr√ºner\\", the company hoped to reach a record depth of 1 km. The Mines de la Loire associated themselves in 1911 with other partners to launch a housing project called La Ruche Immobili√®re(the property beehive) in order to house the workforce that would be working in their new pit. The drilling ended at 727.25 m in 1914 and the headframe was skidded over the pit, but the beginning of World War I stopped the building work. In 1917, the Ch√¢telus 3 pit is renamed after the president of the Soci√©t√© Anonyme des Mines de la Loire, Henry Couriot and officially becomes the Couriot pit 1919: Couriot pit starts running. Within the pit, the wagon loading area is situated at ‚àí116 m below sea level (i.e. 643 m deep). Meanwhile, the Mines de la Loire bought the surrounding land to prevent the urban sprawl of Saint Etienne, that is to say 5 km¬≤ of land that from then on limited the development of the western sector of the city. 1928: installation of a new concrete headframe for Ch√¢telus 1 which became a service pit, the Chatelus 2 pit is deserted and backfilled.

Early life  Ehrhardt was born on 29 April 1805 in Zella St. Blasius, Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. He was the son of a poor gunsmith who worked in J√§ger'schen wire drawing plants. When a master gunsmith visited Ehrhardt's parents, he saw Ehrhardt's technical skills and allowed him to become an apprentice gunsmith. Ehrhardt's first job as a journeyman was at the mint in Gotha.  Work in Belgium  Ehrhardt moved to Belgium in 1831. He worked for an optician in Brussels for half a year before moving with the John Cockerill company to Seraing, where he worked in steam engineering. While working with dewatering machines, he invented a rear cargo compartment. To acquire theoretical knowledge for future work, Ehrhardt went to the Polytechnic Institute in D√ºsseldorf for three months, starting in November 1833. That same year, preparations began for the construction of Le Belge, the first steam locomotive manufactured in Belgium. The locomotive was completed in 1835 by Robert Stephenson and Company, for use on a planned railway from Brussels to Mechelen. In 1836, Ehrhardt attended the Arts and Crafts School in D√ºsseldorf for further theoretical studies and to improve his skills in technical drawing. Afterward, he returned to his home in Zella-Mehlis.  Saxon engineering company  While at a trade fair in Leipzig in October 1838, Ehrhardt met one of the directors of the Saxon engineering company in Chemnitz, who hired him to build steam engines and locomotives. From 1839‚Äì1840, Ehrhardt helped to develop the Teutonia and Pegasus locomotives. The Teutonia was provided for the Magdeburg‚ÄìLeipzig railway, but could not be put into operation because it was too heavy for the railway's infrastructure. It was instead sold to the Magdeburg-Steamship Company. The Pegasus was acquired, after one year of probation, by the Leipzig‚ÄìDresden Railway Company, which used it until 1861. From 1843 to 1868, Ehrhardt worked in Dresden as the chief machinist for the Saxon-Silesian railway company, renamed Saxon State Railways after its nationalization in 1851. He invented the two-sided brake with oscillatory waves in 1847, and the portable Ehrhardtsche scale to control axle loads in 1879. He also helped to improve the preheating of condensation devices.  Later years  Ehrhardt's students included 18 machine masters at other railway companies, professors in Chemnitz and Freiberg, factory owners, and directors of major German and Austrian machine and textile factories. His nephew, Heinrich Ehrhardt (1840‚Äì1928), was a successful inventor, industrialist and entrepreneur. In 1869, Ehrhardt went to live in Radebeul, Germany. He died there in 1883, at the age of 78.

The narrative portrays a river and human vendettas as a part of nature. The story contains references to the Iliad.

Reception John Chamberlain wrote in Scribner's Magazine: \\"Even in spite of the strained images Giono is always en rapport with his scene; he loves the river, the trees, and the hills of his country with a love that is fortunately nine-tenths curiosity. ... Even if you can't stand Homeric madmen you should be able to find much to your taste in The Song of the World.\\" Chamberlain continued: \\"The real idiocy is not the story, but Giono's attitude towards his own product and his own world. The present time, he says, disgusts him; hence his desire to escape from contemporaneity to the far more 'natural' world of the primitive Basses-Alpes, where the peasants still live as they lived two or three hundred years ago. ... He seems to be telling us that primitive man lived a much less conventional and inhibited life than we moderns; he also implies, somewhat paradoxically, that values and order both exist for primitive people, whereas confusion and disorder make the world a hell for the people of 1937.

The former municipality is now part of Ypres. Though Sint-Elooi is the Dutch and only official name, the village's French name, St. Eloi, is most commonly used in English due to its role in World War I. The village and the nearby locations of Voormezele and Hollebeke were merged into Zillebeke in 1970 and into Ypres in 1976. Name The village takes its name from Saint Eligius (also Eloy or Loye, , who worked for twenty years to convert the pagan population of Flanders to Christianity. History World War I In World War I, like other parts of the Ypres Salient, the village was the site of the Battles of Ypres between German and Allied forces. From the spring of 1915, there was constant underground fighting in the Ypres Salient at Hooge, Hill 60, Railway Wood, Sanctuary Wood, The Bluff and St Eloi. The Germans built an extensive system of defensive tunnels and were actively mining against the British trenches at the intermediate levels. In March 1915, they fired mines under the elevated area known as The Mound just south-east of St Eloi and in the ensuing fighting (the Action of St Eloi, 14‚Äì15 March 1915), in which units of the British 27th Division participated, the British infantry suffered some 500 casualties. A month later, on 14 April 1915, the Germans fired another mine producing a crater over in diameter. Counter-mining by the tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers began at St Eloi in spring 1915. Much of the mining in this sector was done by the 177th Tunnelling Company and the 172nd Tunnelling Company. The geology of the Ypres Salient featured a characteristic layer of sandy clay, which put very heavy pressures of water and wet sand on the underground works and made deep mining extremely difficult. In autumn of 1915, 172nd Tunnelling Company managed to sink shafts through the sandy clay at a depth of down to dry blue clay at a depth of , which was ideal for tunneling, from where they continued to drive galleries towards the German lines at a depth of . This constituted a major achievement in mining technique and gave the Royal Engineers a significant advantage over their German counterparts. After German successes at The Bluff, the British decided to use the deep mines created by 172nd Tunnelling Company at St Eloi in a local operation (the Actions of St Eloi Craters, 27 March ‚Äì 16 April 1916) and six charges were fired. However, the accompanying British infantry operation was a failure; the problem lay in the Allied inability to hold crater positions after they had been captured. The Canadian HMCS St. Eloi was later named after the battle. After the Actions of St Eloi Craters, mining and counter-mining at St Eloi continued at a pace. In preparation of the Battle of Messines in 1917, the British began a mining offensive against the German lines to the south of Ypres. Twenty-six deep mines were eventually dug by Tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers, most of which were detonated simultaneously on 7 June 1917, creating craters. The largest of these mines was at St Eloi, dug by the 1st Canadian Tunnelling Company. The work was begun with a deep shaft named Queen VictoriaAccording to Holt/Holt, the Queen Victoria shaft was begun in the area of Bus House Cemetery, behind a farm- house called Bus House by the British troops (). From there, the gallery was extended to the area of the mine chamber. and the chamber was set below ground, at the end of a gallery long and charged with of ammonal. Building preparations had started on 16 August 1915 and the mine was completed on 11 June 1916.Turner, Messines 1917 (2010), p. 44. When the large St Eloi deep mine was fired by the 1st Canadian Tunnelling Company on 7 June 1917, it destroyed some of the earlier craters from 1916 (D2 and D1), although a double crater (H4 and H1) can still be seenPhoto gallery: Battle of Messines Ridge, access date 16 February 2015. (see image). The successful detonation allowed the capture of the German lines at St Eloi by the British 41st Division. World War II The area was fought over again during the Second World War. On 27 May 1940, the 17th Brigade of the British 5th Infantry Division stopped the advance of three German divisions at Hill 60, which enabled the British to make a general withdrawal towards St. Eloi, Kemmel and Dikkebus. Memorials On a small square in the centre of Sint-Elooi stands the 'Monument to the St Eloi Tunnellers' which was unveiled on 11 November 2001. The brick plinth bears transparent plaques with details of the mining activities by 172nd Tunnelling Company and an extract from the poem Trenches: St Eloi by the war poet T.E. Hulme (1883‚Äì1917). There is a flagpole with the British flag next to it, and in 2003 an artillery gun was added to the memorial. Popular culture * During World War I, David Bomberg painted Sappers at Work: A Canadian Tunnelling Company, Hill 60, St Eloi, which bears a reference to both St Eloi/Sint-Elooi and the 1st Canadian Tunnelling Company. * The war poet T.E. Hulme (1883‚Äì1917) wrote the poem Trenches: St Eloi (online). * The story Herbert West‚ÄìReanimator by H. P. Lovecraft mentions the town as the site of a hospital where the titular character performs experiments during World War I.

Background Motivations of the insurgent groups Analysts believe that aim of insurgents may differ from separatism to religious motivations, but they are not entirely clear. The leaders of the groups have maintained different positions: from Baloch nationalism to Salafi jihadism. Belligerents =Iran= * Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, responsible for both military and security actions * Ministry of Intelligence, doing intelligence operations * Border Guard Command, engaging border conflicts with insurgent groups =Baloch rebels= * Jundallah: founded in 2002, was active since 2005, carrying out armed assaults against Iranian armed forces as well as civilians. Since arrest and execution of its leader Abdolmalek Rigi in 2010, they were responsible for a few bombings in 2011 under command of Muhammad Dhahir Baluch. * Harakat Ansar Iran: founded in 2012, they rose up against the Iranian government and claimed responsibility for attacks on the IRGC Personnel and civilians. The group was disbanded in December 2013 due to a merger. * Jaish ul-Adl: founded in 2012 by former Jundallah members, there is very little known about the group. They are led by Salahuddin Farooqui who has opposed Iranian support for Syria in the Syrian Civil War. They have claimed responsibility for dozens of operations since 2013. * Ansar Al-Furqan: founded by December 2013 merger of Harakat Ansar and Pashton group Hizb Al-Furqan. They are linked to Al-Nusra Front and are led by Sheikh Abu-Hafs al-Baloochi. Timeline 2005 *December- A bomb exploded near a car carrying then president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad during an ambush in the province, resulting in the death of one of his bodyguards and another individual. 2007 *14 February - A car bomb detonated in front of a bus transporting members of Iran's revolutionary guard corps in Zehedan reportedly resulting in the death of 11 and injury of 34 others.https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/15/world/middleeast/15tehran.html?_r=2&oref;=slogin&mtrref;=en.wikipedia.org&gwh;=A927F7CFB9EE59E870D07C6BD8C55326&gwt;=pay&assetType;=REGIWALL 2019 *29 January - A double-bombing lightly wounded three police officers in Zahedan, the capital of Sistan and Balochistan province. Jaysh al- Adl claimed responsibility. *2 February - An IRGC soldier was killed and five others wounded in an insurgent attack on a Basij base in Nik Shahr city. Jaysh al-Adl claimed responsibility for the attack. According to Arab news, the attack was carried out by two people who climbed the walls of the Basij paramilitary base and started shooting. *13 February - A suicide car bomb attack targeting a bus carrying IRGC personnel on the Khash-Zahedan road killed at least 27 soldiers and wounded 13 more. Jaysh al-Adl claimed responsibility for the attack. According to Haaretz, the head of IRGC Maj. Mohammad Ali Jafari stated, without providing proof, that Israel gave the Emirates and Saudi Arabia the go ahead to conduct the attack. *21 March - Pakistan announced that it had rescued four Iranian soldiers kidnapped by the Jaysh al-Adl group last year. It did not announce any other details. Jaysh al- Adl had kidnapped 12 Iranian soldiers in October and later released five. Following the announcement, there were still three Iranian soldiers held by the group. *20 July - Two members of the IRGC were killed and another two wounded late at night during a confrontation with gunmen near the border with Pakistan. The confrontation occurred in Keshtegan area of Saravan County, province of Sistan and Baluchestan. 2020 *30 June - Jaysh al-Adl claimed responsibility for a roadside IED blast that injured an IRGC commander on a road in Sistan and Balochistan Province. *5 August - Four police officers were injured when a sound bomb exploded next to their vehicle in Zahedan, capital of Sistan and Balochistan Province, Iran. *29 September - Three Basij members were killed and another was wounded in a drive-by shooting in Nik Shahr county, Sistan-Baluchistan Province. Foreign involvement Role of Pakistan Pakistan is Iran's neighbour, sharing borders of its Balochistan with Sistan and Baluchestan. Pakistan's Balochistan province is also suffering from low-level insurgency waged by terrorist and separatist militants against the government of Pakistan. These Pakistani Baloch terrorist and separatist militants groups are allied with Iranian Baloch groups. Iran and Pakistan historically have a strategic alliance fighting these groups. In February 2014 the two states signed a pact sharing responsibility for combating militants operating across the border. According to a former U.S. intelligence officer, Jundallah leader Abdolmalek Rigi was captured by Pakistani officials and delivered to Iran with U.S. support: \\"It doesn't matter what they say. They know the truth.\\" Allegations of foreign involvement Iran has long accused foreign states supporting insurgency in Sistan and Baluchestan. Several sources such as the ABC News, The New York Times, Daily Telegraph and Seymour Hersh have reported that Jundallah has received support from the United States. Israel, Saudi Arabia, United Kingdom and Sweden are other states allegedly sponsoring the group. Claims of Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) support were debunked by a subsequent investigation showing that the CIA \\"had barred even the most incidental contact with Jundallah.\\" The rumors originated in an Israeli Mossad \\"false flag\\" operation; Mossad agents posing as CIA officers met with and recruited members of Jundullah in cities such as London to carry out attacks against Iran. President George W. Bush \\"went absolutely ballistic\\" when he learned of Israel's actions, but the situation was not resolved until President Barack Obama's administration \\"drastically scaled back joint U.S.-Israel intelligence programs targeting Iran\\" and ultimately designated Jundallah a terrorist organization in November 2010. Although the CIA cut all ties with Jundallah after the 2007 Zahedan bombings, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and United States Department of Defense continued to gather intelligence on Jundallah through assets cultivated by \\"FBI counterterrorism task force officer\\" Thomas McHale; the CIA co-authorized a 2008 trip McHale made to meet his informants in Afghanistan. According to The New York Times: \\"Current and former officials say the American government never directed or approved any Jundallah operations. And they say there was never a case when the United States was told the timing and target of a terrorist attack yet took no action to prevent it.\\" Mashregh News, which has close ties to the IRGC, has accused Qatar for supporting both Jaish ul-Adl and Harakat Ansar Iran, alongside Saudi Arabia. Harakat Ansar Iran has made an appeal on Saudi Arabian websites for funding. The conflict has also interpreted as part of the Iran‚ÄìIsrael proxy conflict.

These are of the grey mottled variation. Danish landrace goose or Danish goose (Danish language: ') is a landrace variety of goose native to Denmark.  Description  The Danish goose is available in two variants, gray and gray mottled. It is a medium-sized goose, with a weight of about 6 kg when fully developed. The beak and legs of The Danish goose are a sharp orange colour and the eyes are blue. Interbreeding often results in brown eyes though. The gray mottled variant is also referred to as white, as only the head, back and inner wings are grey coloured, while the rest is brightly white. The Danish goose has only one k√∏l below the belly. The goose is considered a hardy bird and the breeds' main productional strength is its ability to produce a low-fat carcass with a lot of meat. It is a slow growing bird however, with small clutches and a low reproduction rate. Therefore, the Danish goose has fallen out of favor in modern agricultural production.  History  The Danish goose was bred from wild animals in ancient times and is thought to have emerged from Scandinavian wild grey geese. From archaeological remains we know that The Danish goose was a popular poultry of the Vikings and was in fact the most popular poultry and only goose bred in Denmark up until the end of the 17th century, when a land reform changed the agrarian practices. Apart from the meat and eggs, the Vikings used the feathers from this goose breed as steering feathers for arrows. A Danish educational site (about animals) for school children. The Danish goose also used to provide downs and feathers for quills. Goose is traditionally served for dinner on Mortensaften (St. Martin's Day) in Denmark.  Conservation status  At the end of the 20th century, the Danish landrace goose was on the brink of extinction, but a dedicated breeding program helped the species survive. There are only a limited number of the old Danish geese today, with only 50 herds registered as of 2006, and it is preferably at open air museums they can be experienced.

Norris & Son was one of the most prestigious makers of hand tools in England in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and famed for the quality and gracefulness of its output, notably of its metal planes. Both wooden and metal planes made in Norris's workshop survive as do other edge tools. Some Norris planes, especially bespoke models, are highly prized by woodworkers and collectors.

Yarranton worked as an apprentice at the Norris workshop from October 1939 when he joined as a 14-year-old boy until April 1943 when he volunteered for the RAF.See Apprenticeship at T. Norris & Son. When he left he recalls that he was given a reference signed by the director, a Mrs H. Norris. According to the London Gazette, Helen Sellars Norris, the widow of Thomas was chairman of the company at the time of an Extraordinary General Meeting of T. Norris & Son Limited held on 31 March 1941 at which the resolution was duly passed that \\"the Company be wound up voluntarily\\".London Gazette. The Members' Voluntary Winding-up was to be reported at a General Meeting of the Members of the Company on 23 September 1941.London Gazette. The timing of change of ownership has yet to be clarified. It would seem, however, that she had taken charge of the business on her husband's death and that although perhaps no longer the owner of the firm in 1943 when Yarranton left, she was working on as a director after the firm had become Norris Planes Ltd. Helen Sellars Norris died 8 March 1952 at Worthing.London Gazette. 18 April 1952, p. 2158. The 1913 patent number on the adjustment knob of an A1 jointing plane The 1922 patent number on the adjustment knob of an economy version of a closed-handle smoothing plane Norris patent adjustment device The quest for full vertical and lateral control of the plane iron had been raging for many years. Leonard Bailey in Connecticut devised a system in 1867 that was to be adopted by Stanley. Charles Nurse in London invented a plane-iron regulator (patented 1889), a device that the firm of Norris & Son experimented with on its planes before Thomas James Norris created and patented an adjustment mechanism of his own. * First patent Under patent 11,526 of 13 July 1913 Norris sought protection for his \\"Adjustment for Plane Irons\\". The 1914 Norris price list gives an outline explanation, whereas the HMSO report published in 1921 gives a full description of the mechanism.‚ÄúA plane is provided with a threaded spindle ... adapted to coact with a nut ... , which is pivoted to the body of the plane, and the spindle is rotatably connected with the plane iron by means of a cup-shaped block ... engaging the head ... of the blade screw. The portion of the spindle coacting with the block ... is of reduced diameter, and the screw-thread thereon is in the opposite direction to that on the part of the spindle which coacts with the nut... The screw threads on the two portions may be in the same direction but of different pitch; or the end of the spindle may be revolubly connected with the block ... The cut of the plane is adjusted by rotation of the spindle, and the angular position of the plane-iron is corrected by an angular or side movement of the spindle about the pivoted nut ...‚Äù Patents for Invention: Abridgments of Specifications, Class 61 (ii), Hand Tools, Period‚ÄîA.D.1909‚Äì15, London, 1921, p. 127 (this is as quoted in Russell, p. 380, n. 4). During the First World War Norris continued making tools. Economy designs were supplied to the government, some with Norris's patent adjustment device. On some later low-angle planes with pin-and-hole iron adjustment, the 1913 patent number was used without the 13 suffix. * Second patent Under no. 199,198 of 22 June 1923 Thomas J. Norris patented modifications to his patent adjustment device. Maker's marks In the early days the mark varied considerably and often gave one of the Lambeth addresses. Later the simple \\"Norris London\\" (initially set straight or later in an ellipse) was used.Russell, p. 380. Later years Norris Planes Ltd and Norris Planes & Tools Ltd The premises at 3 Sycamore Grove, New Malden, were leased in 1941 for the duration of the War plus three months to Aeronautical and General Instruments Ltd, with registered office Purley Way, Croydon,This firm established in 1915 became a public company in 1936 and continues to operate in Poole, Dorset. See the official website. It is likely that Norris Planes Ltd (1944‚Äì1946), probably still based at Sycamore Grove as well as the later Norris Planes & Tools Ltd (1946‚Äì1958) were successive subsidiaries. \\"for the manufacture of scientific instruments and the purposes of general engineering\\".Lease dated 21 February 1941 (ref. KX329/4 Kingston Museum and Heritage Service). The premises comprised \\"dwelling house, garage adjoining and business at 3 Sycamore Grove and the factory, workshop and outside garages as have been in the occupation of [Helen Sellars Norris]\\". The property on the north side of Sycamore Grove had a frontage of 120 feet to Sycamore Grove and a depth of 200 feet with \\"buildings thereon\\". Many planes made during this period used parallel steel channel rather than being dovetailed and peened. A certain Ernest George Long, Foreman, Aeronautical & General Instruments Ltd. (Morden, Surrey) was awarded the British Empire Medal in the 1951 New Year Honours. Although there is no known direct correlation with Norris planes, the award hints at a continuing excellence in engineering. Legacy Several makers have found inspiration in the workmanship and design of Norris planes: * Henley Optical Company, Oxford, made a range of exquisitely manufactured planes in the 1970s and 1980s. * Bill Carter has since 1987 been making planes many in the Norris tradition. * Holtey Planes; first inspiration came from a Norris plane in the 1990s.

The district contains 42 residential properties built between 1850 and 1910, a major period of the city's growth, and is anchored on its south by Whitney Park, a small triangular park at Hammond and Cedar Streets. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988, and is protected by the city's local historic district ordinance. Description and history Whitney Park is located on the west side of Bangor, on the north side of Hammond Street (Maine State Route 100) and south of Cedar Street. North of the park, roughly bounded by Cedar, West Broadway, Union Street, and Pond Street, stand a collection of well-preserved houses noted for their homogeneity of scale and setting. This area was platted and development begun in the 1850s, a time when Bangor was booming as one of the major lumber processing and shipment points in the United States. The houses in the district are architecturally diverse, representing a cross section of architectural styles popular between 1850 and 1910. The district is bounded by commercial development and the Bangor Theological Seminary to the south, later 20th-century residential development to the north, and an older residential area to the east. The oldest building in the district is the Charles Jennings House at 15 Hayward Street. Built c. 1851-53, it is a relatively modest Greek Revival Cape that has been augmented by Colonial Revival alterations. There are a number of stylish Italianate houses, the most elaborate of which is probably that of William Arnold at 47 West Broadway; it is a rambling two-story structure with two towers. Lining West Broadway are also a series of Second Empire houses with mansard roofs. The West Broadway house lots were among the first to be laid out, and are larger (about ) than those found on other streets in the district. Later styles, including Queen Anne, Shingle, and the Colonial Revival, are well represented in the remainder of the district.

He was originally sent to race in France where he had considerable success, winning the Prix Guillaume d'Ornano and La Coupe de Maisons-Laffitte as well as finishing second in the Prix du Jockey Club as a three-year-old in 1993. In the following year he recorded his biggest success when he won the Champion Stakes in England. As a six-year-old he was transferred to the United States where he won the Del Mar Handicap and the Carleton F. Burke Handicap before his racing career was ended by injury. He made very little impact as a breeding stallion. Background Dernier Empereur was a chestnut horse with a white blaze and four white socks bred in Kentucky by the Mayland's Stud Company Ltd. He was sired by Trempolino who won the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and finished second in the Breeders' Cup Turf as a three-year-old in 1987. As a breeding stallion, his other offspring included Valixir (Prix d'Ispahan, Queen Anne Stakes), Arkadian Hero (Mill Reef Stakes) and Germany (Grosser Preis von Baden). Dernier Empereur's dam, Dear Colleen, who won nine minor races in a racing career which lasted from 1976 till 1979, was a granddaughter of the Irish Oaks winner Uvira, whose other descendants have included Summer Squall, A.P. Indy, Duke of Marmalade and Lemon Drop Kid. The colt entered the ownership of Paul de Moussac and was sent to race in Europe where he was trained in France by Andr√© Fabre. Racing career 1992: two-year-old season On his racecourse debut Dernier Empereur, ridden by Thierry Jarnet, won a minor race over 1500 metres at Saint-Cloud Racecourse on 12 October. In November he was moved up in class and distance for the Group Three Prix des Ch√™nes over 1600 metres at √âvry. He started the 11/10 favourite, but despite finishing strongly he was beaten a length by Dancienne. 1993: three-year-old season Dernier Empereur began his three- year-old season by finishing fifth behind the Fran√ßois Boutin-trained Hernando in the Listed Prix de Suresnes over 2100 metres at Longchamp Racecourse on 2 May and then finished third behind the same colt, over the same course and distance in the Group One Prix Lupin two weeks later. On 6 June, Dernier Empereur started a 25/1 outsider for the 156th running of the Prix du Jockey Club over 2400 metres at Chantilly Racecourse. Ridden by Sylvain Guillot he finished second of the eleven runners, two and a half lengths behind the winner Hernando. Three weeks later he started 9/5 favourite for the Grand Prix de Paris at Longchamp but finished fourth, a length behind the winner Fort Wood. On 14 August, Dernier Empereur, ridden again by Guillot, contested the Group Two Prix Guillaume d'Ornano over 2000 metres at Deauville Racecourse. He recorded his first major win, taking the lead 300 metres from the finish and winning by two and a half lengths from Fastness, a colt who went on to win two editions of the Eddie Read Handicap. In September, Dernier Empereur met Hernando for the fourth time in the Prix Niel and finished second to the Boutin-trained colt, beaten one and a half lengths. A month later, the colt was sent to England for the Champion Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse. After being restrained by Jarnet in the early stages, he stayed on strongly in last quarter mile to finish third of the twelve runners behind Hatoof and Ezzoud. On his final appearance of the year, the colt was sent to race in California where he started an 89/1 outsider for the Breeders' Cup Turf at Santa Anita Park and finished unplaced behind Kotashaan. 1994: four-year-old season On his four-year-old debut Dernier Empereur was brought back in distance and finished fifth when favourite for the Prix du Muguet and then finished fifth of seven behind Bigstone in the Prix d'Ispahan at Longchamp on 29 May. After a break of almost three months, the colt returned at Deauville in August and finished third in the Prix de Hastings, beaten a short neck and a nose by Red Bishop and Djanord. In September, Dernier Empereur met Red Bishop again in La Coupe de Maisons-Laffitte over 2000 metres on heavy ground. The other contenders included the British-trained favourite Pollen Count (Prix Eug√®ne Adam, Hungerford Stakes, Prix Quincey) and the Prix La Force winner Sin Kiang. Starting at odds of 5.2/1 he was restrained by Jarnet in the early stages before taking the lead 200 metres from the finish and winning by one and a half lengths from Red Bishop. After the race, the colt was bought by the American businessman Gary A. Tanaka who said \\"I prefer to buy proven horses; it eliminates so many risks\\". For the second year, Dernier Empereur was sent to England in October for the Champion Stakes in which he was ridden by Guillot. On a dull, foggy day, he started the 8/1 fifth choice in the betting behind Hatoof, Grand Lodge, La Confederation (Sun Chariot Stakes) and Muhtarram. The other three runners were Mehthaaf (Irish 1,000 Guineas), Environment Friend and Sacrament (Great Voltigeur Stakes). Hatoof took an early lead and set a slow pace before being overtaken by Grand Lodge at half way. Environment Friend and La Confederation were close behind whilst Guillot settled Dernier Empereur towards the rear of the field. A furlong out, Grand Lodge had opened up a clear advantage from Mehthaaf, Muhtarram and Hatoof, but the leader was beginning to tire and Guillot was making rapid progress. In a five-way blanket finish, Dernier Empereur produced a decisive late run to take the lead in the final strides and won by a short-head, a neck, a head and a neck from Grand Lodge, Muhtarram, Mehthaaf and Hatoof. Guillot later described the win as the best moment of his riding career. On his final start of the year he was tried on dirt in the Breeders' Cup Classic at Churchill Downs in November but finished unplaced behind Concern. 1995: five-year-old season As in the previous year, Dernier Empereur began his 1995 campaign with unsuccessful runs in the Prix du Muguet and the Prix d'Ispahan, finishing seventh in both races behind the four-year-old Green Tune. After winning a minor race at Vichy in August he attempted to repeat his previous success in La Coupe de Maisons-Laffitte but was beaten three lengths by Gunboat Diplomacy. In autumn he ran twice on dirt in the United States, finishing fourth behind Cigar in the Jockey Club Gold Cup and seventh behind Silver Fox in the Stuyvesant Handicap. 1996: six-year-old season In 1996 Dernier Empereur was transferred permanently to the United States where he was trained by Ben Cecil and campaigned on turf. In his first four starts he finished fourth in the Inglewood Handicap, eighth in the Manhattan Handicap, third in the Bel Air Handicap and second in an allowance race at Del Mar. On 9 August at Del Mar, the horse won his first race in North America when Pat Valenzuela rode him to victory in the Escondido Handicap over eleven furlongs. Three weeks later Dernieur Empereur contested the Grade II Del Mar Invitational Handicap over the same course and distance and started at odds of 6.5/1. Valenzuela produced him with a strong late run on the outside to win by half a length from Talloires. In September he contested the Grade I Canadian International Stakes at Woodbine Racecourse in Toronto but endured a \\"rough trip\\" and finished fifth of the seven runners behind Singspiel. Dernier Empereur' last race was the Grade II Carleton F. Burke Handicap over one and a half miles at Santa Anita Park on 4 November. Ridden by Chris McCarron, he took the lead in the straight and won by three lengths from Bon Point. Dernier Empereur was being prepared for a run in the Japan Cup when he fractured his left front cannon bone in a training gallop at Hollywood Park. Stud career Dernier Empereur was retired from racing and began his breeding career in France and was also shuttled to stand as a breeding stallion in New Zealand. He later stood at the Ballykisteen Stud in Ireland. He was not a success at stud, siring few winners of any consequence. The most successful of his offspring was probably Archduke Ferdinand, a stayer who won the Northumberland Plate in 2001. His last reported foal was born in 2004.

According to the 1891 census, he was living at 26, Crispin Street, Spitalfields, and working as a market porter. He boxed as a lightweight. On 24 April 1897, at the Ecelsior Hall, Bethnal Green, he beat Tom Ireland to win Harry Wright's 'All England' 9st 8lbs (134lbs) silver championship belt competition, over six rounds. It was his second bout of the night, having earlier beaten Jerry Donoghue in a semi-final, with a knockout in the third round. The belt's value was quoted at the time as ¬£40. At the time of the 1901 census he and his wife Nell had seven surviving children. His last recorded fight was in 1907. The 1911 census shows the family living in a house in Edmonton, north London - a much more up-market area. He died in 1943, aged 73, and was buried without a headstone.

The campaign went viral when the public and celebrities began sharing pictures and videos of crotch grabs using the hashtag #feelingnuts and became an annual TV event on Channel 4. The campaign involves both social media and television. Origins Feeling Nuts was created by brothers and founders of Salter Brothers Entertainment, Simon and Andrew Salter after being inspired by Wendy Gough, a mother who lost her son to testicular cancer in 1998 simply because he was too embarrassed to discuss it. Gough has conducted awareness talks in schools ever since her son's death which left a lasting impression on the Salter brothers. They realised that raising money wasn‚Äôt necessary to stop men dying of testicular cancer and therefore created a new currency through social awareness. In an interview with The Times, the brothers stated that \\"young guys don‚Äôt want to listen to charities lecturing them so we took a different approach\\" creating the social movement organisation Check One Two and devising its first campaign 'Feeling Nuts'. In an interview with The Huffington Post Andrew explained: \\"Our mission is to empower people to spread awareness of this preventable cancer and change behavior to check themselves regularly. We firmly believe that this social movement, designed to save lives, will get the nation talking about this taboo subject and by using entertainment around the #feelingnuts campaign, ultimately, save lives.\\" On 10 April 2014, Check One Two launched the hashtag #FeelingNuts to promote the Testicular Cancer Awareness Month and encouraged men to regularly check themselves for testicular cancer. On 12 June 2014, the Check One Two YouTube channel uploaded a video titled \\"Are You #FeelingNuts\\", challenging viewers to share pictures of themselves grabbing their crotch with the hashtag #FeelingNuts to raise awareness about testicular cancer. The tipping point for Feeling Nuts arrived in August 2014 when the brothers dropped their trousers in Oxford Street in London and took a selfie grabbing their crotches, receiving 4,864 retweets and 13,507 favourites on Twitter. Using #feelingnuts, they started a monthly call to action for men to check themselves regularly and then issued an online challenge to boyband 5 Seconds Of Summer and Richard Branson's son Sam Branson, who took it up. Soon more celebrities started to challenge each other including Hugh Jackman, William Shatner, Ricky Gervais, chef Jamie Oliver and fashion model Cara Delevingne. In October 2014 the campaign went viral and social media monitoring company Brandwatch estimated that within 3 months, the campaign had reached at least 750 million people globally in addition to thousands of media stories. The Feeling Nuts Comedy Night On 17 September 2014 it was announced that the brothers had joined forces with Channel 4 to launch an annual 90-minute comedy TV event called The Feeling Nuts Comedy Night designed to raise awareness of testicular cancer. The inaugural show premiered on 24 October 2014 and was hosted by comedian Jack Whitehall as well as featuring comedy sketches from Cara Delevingne, Jimmy Carr, One Direction and musical performances from James Corden and Rizzle Kicks. The show also reunited Martin Clunes and Neil Morrissey for a new Men Behaving Badly sketch for the first time in over 15 years. The Feeling Nuts Comedy Night inaugural event was a success, easily beating and over doubling the channel‚Äôs slot average.

The Danish hen (Danish: Dansk landh√∏ne) is a chicken landrace native to Denmark. It is the only true native chicken landrace in the country and perhaps in all of Europe.  History  Archaeological remains have revealed that the particular breed of The Danish hen has been kept as livestock poultry in the area we now know as Denmark for more than 2000 years. It is believed that chickens were introduced to the Scandinavian region by germanic tribes from the south around 400 BC. In the beginning of the 1800s, various foreign poultry and livestock breeds were introduced in Danish agriculture on a broad scale and The Danish hen was disfavoured and often interbred. The Danish hen was in danger of extinction, but in the years 1877‚Äì78, a few dedicated and foresighted farmers bought and collected whatever they could get of Danish hens with a provable genetic ancestry. In 1878 the association of Landh√∏nseringen was initiated with teacher N. Jensen Badsk√¶r as chairman and in 1901, the first standard of The Danish hen breed emerged. The Danish hen plays no economic or productional role at all and is exclusively kept by hobby breeders. The association of Specialklubben for Danske Landh√∏ns is now officially working for mediating and preserving knowledge about this particular breed.  Description  The Danish hen is a somewhat small breed. They are sturdy, fastgrowing and have a good resistance to disease. The foodstuff consumption is small and they are eager at seeking out food on their own. The female hen has a well-developed and plump rear and is an excellent egg layer of white eggs (55-65 g), except during the winter. Danish hens are lively by nature and with a tendency for flight-lust. Warm springs (by Danish standards) are needed for proper egg hatching, but the hens are good chicken leaders. The average weight of fully grown cocks and hens are 2‚Äì2.50 kg and 1.75 kg respectively. The carcass is not abundant with meat, but the chest is fleshy, the meat has a fine structure and the taste is considered exquisite. Online publication from DFfR.  Genetic variations  There are several colour variations of Danish hens, with brown as the most numerous, followed by black. Other colours include yellow, white, grey and silver neck. There is also a distinct short-legged variation of The Danish hen called Lutteh√∏ns within the species. Lutteh√∏ns has a predisposition for very short legs of only a few centimetres, while the claws are of ordinary size and capability. Lutteh√∏ns are calmer in nature, with less lust for flight. They tend to be slightly heavier, with an average weight of 2.25 kg and 2.00 kg for the cock and hen respectively, and the eggs weigh a minimum of 58 g. There is no lethal alleles when Lutteh√∏ns and ordinary long-legged Danish hens are crossed. A native genetic variation of dwarf hens has existed in Denmark since ancient times, but it proved hard to secure an original strain and it was not until 1952 that a plan for back- breeding a dwarf strain was launched officially by the association of Landh√∏nseringen. The first results of this plan emerged in 1967. The origin of the original Danish dwarf hen is unknown. Back-breeding attempts has focused on a bantamising of the ordinary Danish Landrace. Therefore, ordinary Danish hens are sometimes referred to as large Danish hens to separate them from the dwarf variation. The current strain of dwarf Danish hens is perhaps mixed with dwarf hens from Germany. A successful variation of dwarf Lutteh√∏ns has been bred from the large Danish hen in Denmark, with considerable progress in the years 1945‚Äì1950. It is a very trustful bird with a compact and firm body. The eggs are white and a minimum weight of 30 g for hatching eggs is required. The cocks weigh 800 g and the hens 700 g on average. A brown and a black strain exists. Gumpeh√∏ne is a variant of the Danish landrace hen, characterized by an inferior tail due to a few missing tail joints. Only a few individuals exists.  Conservation status  At the end of the 1900s, the Danish hen was rare, but as it has gained in popularity among amateur breeders, it is no longer considered endangered.

Passing through the town of Cortina d'Ampezzo, it joins the Piave at Perarolo di Cadore. The principal valley, that of the Piave, runs parallel to the mountain chain which separates the province of Belluno from the basin of the Adige. The secondary valleys, which complete the river basin, are, in descending order and on the right bank, those of Visdende, Comelico Superiore, Auronzo, Boite and Zoldo, traversed, respectively, by the Silvella, or first branch of the Piave, the Padola, Ansiei, Boite, and Mae, which all flow into the main river in a rectangular direction. Geography Vodo di Cadore reservoir The Boite, a tributary of the Piave, flows through the Dolomites in a north-south direction, passing through the Valle del Boite and town of Cortina d'Ampezzo. It also passes through the comunes of San Vito di Cadore, Borca di Cadore, Vodo di Cadore and Valle di Cadore. The river Boite flows for , and has a basin area of . During its course, it receives numerous streams and mountain rivers, the largest of which is the stream from Monte Rite at Cibiana di Cadore. Its tributaries are, Fanes, Costeana, Felizon, Ursuline, Assola, Rite, Rudan, Vallesina Over the course of the Boite are also the reservoirs of Vodo and Valle di Cadore. Near Cortina, it is encircled by mountain ranges of Cristallo, Sorapiss, and Tofane, whose peaks are Tofana di Mezzo (3,244 m), Tofana di Dentro (3,238m), and Tofana di Rozes (3,225 m). Geology The Boite and Piave drainage system belongs to the complex Dolomite Alps geology sequence made up of sedimentary rocks intruded with pyroclastic. These are found to overlay the thrust zones of igneous and meta sedimentary late Paleozoic rocks. Local intrusion of many types of shallow Mesozoic and tertiary rocks are also noted. The high rise domes of the mountains, primarily belong to the Mesozoic age and basically consist of dolomite with exposures of limestone, marlstone, claystone, siltstone, sandstone, tuff and conglomerates. Panorama Landmarks The Boite river valley has eight distinct ski areas which are located in the lower- altitude snowfields and which are approached by cable cars. Cortina, as Italy's premier ski resort, has over 50 cable cars and lifts in this river valley. Castello di Botestagno was a medieval fort perched on a rock in the valley overlooking the Boite; little remains of it today. An Ossuary near Cortina has the skeletal remains of 10,000 soldiers killed during World War I. The Piave-Boite-Mae-Vaiont is an important water resources development scheme in the valley with the Pieve di Cadore reservoir as the head reservoir. The location shooting for the Hollywood film A Farewell to Arms (1957) was done in this river valley.

As a cricketer, his batting and bowling styles are not known, but from his record in Cambridge University Cricket Club trial matches in 1858 and 1859, the university side appears to have regarded him primarily as a bowler. Nevertheless, it was a batsman, playing for the Cambridge Town Club against the university that he made impact in his first first-class game, scoring 45, the highest score of a rain- affected game: he also took wickets and made a catch. That led to his selection for the university team in the next game, a match against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), in which he batted at No 8 and scored 1 and 16, taking a single wicket. Though there were other non-first-class matches over the next few weeks for Cambridge University, he did not play first-class cricket again. Rowe graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1859.

Description Dito di Dio (Finger of God), with Lago di Sorapiss at its foot Sorapiss, with its huge perpendicular faces, forms part of the mountainous backdrop to the resort town of Cortina, situated roughly to the southeast of the town. The limestone dolomite formations, which are irregular, rugged and sharp-edged peaks, are part of the Eastern Alps. The Cristallo group lies to the north past the Passo Tre Croci, and its southern neighbour is the Antelao. A path to Sorapiss starts at Passo Tre Croci and continues along an easy slope, reaching the refuge at the base of the Sorapiss range, close to Lago di Sorapiss, which is at an elevation of . The elevation of Sorapiss is . The mountain has three ridges: a central ridge, a southern ridge, which is the part of the mountain that can be seen from Cortina, and, beyond a high pass and little to the west, a northern ridge that culminates in the skiing area of Mount Faloria. There are three glaciers on the mountain's slopes, although these have been melting considerably in recent years. Lago Sorapiss, at the foot of the mountain, is a glacial lake at an elevation . History Rifugio Alfonso Vandelli There are three refuges in the vicinity: Rifugio Tondi di Faloria at , Rifugio Alfonso Vandelli at and Rifugio San Marco. Rifugio Alfonso Vandelli was built by Austrians in 1891 on the banks of Lago di Sorapiss. In 1895 it was destroyed by an avalanche, but was rebuilt the following year in a more sheltered spot. At the end of World War I in 1918, Cortina d'Ampezzo became part of the Kingdom of Italy (1918) and the refuge became the property of the CAI (Club Alpino Italiano) of Venice. In 1924, thanks to a donation by Cesare Luigi Luzzati, a new refuge was built. A fire destroyed it completely in 1959, and it was again reconstructed; the current shelter was opened on 18 September 1966 and was named after the president of the CAI of Venice, Alfonso Vandelli. Paul Grohmann made the first ascent of the mountain in September 1864, taking 8 hours and 30 minutes. There are at least two routes to the summit: the Grohmann-Weg, which crosses the mountain's west flank, joining the S. Vito route near the summit, and the Muller-Weg, which traverses the east glacier and ascends direct over the precipices on the northeast side. Flora The flora on Sorapiss includes Festucetum pulchellae (slopes), Euphrasio-Globularietum (base), and Drabetum hoppeanae (on the range). Legend Lago Sorapiss Forcella Ciadin del Loudo- Path N¬∞223 Sorapiss from Lake Misurina There is a legend associated with the name of Sorapiss, which in local dialect means \\"above the waterfall\\". A \\"peace-loving\\" king named Sorapiss turned himself into a rocky mountain during a course of unexpected events. A witch had bewitched the king's impulsive daughter Misurina by promising her a magical mirror as a reward for providing shade to her house. This was honoured by her doting father, who turned himself into a mountain. At a later date, Misurina, demonstrating a sense of gratitude towards her father, cried and shed tears which formed the Lago di Sorapiss at the foot of the large cliff of Sorapiss, the immobilized form of her father.

The main population of the tribe is settled in an area called Sarhad in the city of Khash. The population of the Yarahmadzais are about 30,000 and they are divided into three big factions (Sohrabzai, Hossenzai and Rahmetzai).Black Tents of Baluchistan () by Salzman Philip Carl History The origin of the tribe is from the hills of Sibi (located in East Balochistan) the same place where Mir Chakar Khan Rind (the great Baloch king) comes from they migrated to the Sarhad plateau somewhere during the beginning of the 18th century and since then they have expanded, increased and become one of the most prominent and powerful tribes of Sarhad. Before the arrival of the Yarahmadzais the area (Taftan/khash) was organized and controlled by the Kurds. The Kurds were originally sent to the Sarhad of Baluchistan by Shah Abbas the great as a part of his policy of weakening dangerous Baloch tribes by removing them from their local territories. As the Yarahmadzai tribe established themselves in Sarhad the tribe grew larger, and become more powerful and more ambitious they were a big threat to the hokomats (representatives of the rulers) established in Iranian/Baluchistan as well in south (Bampur) as north (Taftan/Khash). The Yarahmadzai unlike the other tribes (particularly in southern Baluchistan) never recognized the hakoms (governed as agents of the crown they received support and encouragement from the crown) of the hokomats as leaders to whom they would serve. Instead, they established their own political leader, the Sardar who was a representative for the tribe, several disputes occurred between the Yarahmadzais and the Kurds which resulted in one time that the Kurds were driven out from Sarhad and they lost the control of the area to the Yarahmadzais.Tribe and State in Iran and Afghanistan Richard Tapper, pp. 270‚Äì282 According to Percy Molesworth Sykes the Yarahmadzai became the most influential tribe under the notorious Sardar Jiand Khan of Sarhad where 50 families controlled over 1,000 families; next in importance were the Rekis who aggregate over 600 families.Ten Thousand Miles in Persia or Eight Years in Iran () by Percy Molesworth Sykes, pp. 107, 131, 230 The major economic profit of the tribe was from predatory raiding of livestock, goods and slaves outside Sarhad, mostly from Kerman and Jiroft area. The British Campaign in 1916 During World War I, the Yarahmadzais disturbed the lines of communication of the British frontier and raided their goods, this gave some concerns to the British forces and the fact that the Germans have through Turkish agents supplied the Sarhadi tribes with weapons and promised them that the Germans have converted to Islam in order to let the Sarhadi tribes show allegiance with them. The British knew that the Sarhad route was very important for their purpose and to keep the control over India.The raiders of the Sarhad: being the account of a campaign of arms and bluff against the brigands of the Persian-Baluchi border during the great war, General Reginald Dyer The mission to prevent the tribes from raiding fell on General Reginald Dyer. The three major tribes who performed raids and disturbed the British line were the Yarahmadzais, Gamshadzais and Ismaelzais even known as Damanis. According to Reginald Dyer he went to Sarhad with a small troop and he managed to keep the Sarhadi tribes in line with account of campaign of arms and bluffs. Dyer used a lot of spies to obtain information about the movements of the Yarahmadzai tribe and their plans, one of the spies who Dyer was very proud over was Ido Khan Reki(Rigi) who contributed very well. Juma Khan the tribal chief of the Ismaelzais decided to surrender when he heard about the plans of Dyer, while Sardar Jiand Khan and Halil Khan (Chief of the Gamshadzai) decided to resist against the British forces. Several battles occurred between Dyer and the Damanis (Yarahmadzai, Gamshadzai) Jiand lost his son and Gamshadzais chief (Khalil Khan) got killed during one of the battles. In a documentary that was made about Baloch tribes and sardars, the late tribal leader Sardar Khan Mohammad recounts from what he has been told about what happened during one of the last battles his tribe had against the British. He tells about when Jiand khan and his son got arrested and they (British garrison) were on their march to Quetta to bring them (the hostage) into captivity when they suddenly got ambushed by the Yarahmadzais and Gamshadzais in an area called Nalak (a narrow passage nearby Khash). They managed to free them and in the battle two of the yarahmadzais lost their lives while the losses for Dyer was devastating. Dyer himself was not present in the battle but after what happened he never showed up in Sarhad. He never mentioned the battle of Nalak in his book instead he wrote about how they have succeeded and weakened the Sarhadi tribes and that an agreement was reached with the Yarahmadzais and Gamshadzai after that the two tribes sent letters to Dyer to allow them returning to their home. The story about what happened during Dyers campaign lacks credibility in Sarhad, that was one of the reasons that Abdol Hossein Yadegari a baloch intellectual (he died in an accident 2006) decided to make a research about what really happened in Dyers Campaign. Abdol Hossein Yadegari translated Dyers book with additional comments based on his research, his work was published posthumously in Persian. Not much record exist what Sarhad was after Dyer but from what was heard and been told among the tribesmen the raiding continued, or like Coleridge Kennard describes it \\"Just as we are preparing for the night a jambaz rider arrives from the desert to announce that a balochi raiding army, a very powerful one a thousand men ride in it is close to his heels, marching from Khwash under Shasavar Khan (Yarahmadzai)\\"Suhail 1927 Kennard, Coleridge. Pacification of Sarhad In 1921 Reza Khan who was a member of the Cossack Brigade performed a coup by taking the control over Teheran and establishing his own government with dissolution of the previous. This occurred during a time were Persia became a battlefield between Soviet and Britain, Britain used Persia to perform attacks on Russia to being able to reverse the Revolution (Russian Revolution).Reza Khan. With the help of Britain Reza Khan managed to establish his power and one of his first tasks were to secure the borders by starting the pacification of Persia. After a series of campaigns against Azeris, Qashqais, Turkmens and the Lurs the last region remained to be pacified and brought under control of central government was Baluchistan. The pacification of western Baluchistan started 1928 in the south were the army of Reza Khan's successfully defeated Dost Mohammad Khan's of Bampur, but the real battle was left for Reza Khan army to defeat the Damanis. The battle with Damanis proved to be more difficult than expected, Dyer's campaign had strengthened the tribes of Damanis in warfare they were well prepared for the army of Reza Khan. The Ismaelzais led by Juma Khan resisted from Shuro (West of Zahedan) while the Yarahmadzai led by Jiand Khan (by then aged ninety years old) resisted from Khwash area. As reported by Nigel ColettThe Butcher of Amritsar by Nigel Collett. Jiand khan was leading the resistance until he got arrested and was replaced by his nephew (Shaswar Khan) who became the head of the tribe and continued to lead the resistance. The war lasted for 6 years from 1928‚Äì1934. Philip Carl Salzman summarizes The Anthropology of real life, events in Human Experience by Philip Carl Salzman. the pacification of western Baluchistan \\"Reza Shah then turned his attention to the most remote region claimed to be part of Iran, Baluchistan. An army was sent in 1928 and succeeded, with the help of artillery and primitive bombing from early aircraft, in pacifying all of Baluchistan, except for the Sarhad. Led by the Yarahmadzai, who had earlier fought the British, the Sarhadi tribes resisted successfully, until finally settling and accepting the suzerainty of the Persian crown in 1935\\". The Yarahmadzais were defeated but not forcibly settled. As result of the pacification, the Yarahmadzai lost their tribal name and becoming the Shah Navazi (Shah strokers) while Ismaeilzais becoming Shah Baksh (Shahs Pardon).

Data collection can be rapid, but the required computations are massive. Further, many common experimental perturbations can degrade the quality of tomographs, unless corrections are applied. Unless automated tools make these corrections, beamline staff can be overwhelmed by data that can be collected far faster than corrections and reconstruction can be performed.

Castello di Botestagno (also known as Podestagno, or Peutelstein in German) is a ruined medieval fort in the comune of Cortina d'Ampezzo in the southern (Dolomitic) Alps of the Veneto region of Northern Italy. It is perched on a rock in the valley of the Boite River, a little further north of Cortina, in the town of Pr√† del Ca≈°tel. History It is believed that it was first erected as a stakeout during conflict with the Lombards between the seventh and eighth centuries, with the aim of dominating the three valleys that converge beneath it: the Boite, the Val di Fanes and the Val Felizon. The corner stone, however, probably dates to the 11th century. It was held by the Germans until 1077, and then by the patriarchs of Aquileia (12th century) and the da Camino (13th century), until Botestagno became the seat of a captaincy. It then passed into Venetian hands and finally to the Habsburgs in 1511. During the 18th century the castle lost importance gradually, until it was auctioned in 1782 by order of Emperor Joseph II. Today the fort has now almost completely disappeared; only the remnants of what must have been the wine cellars and the foundations remain, now weathered and largely covered up by vegetation.

The best known, often titled \\"The Hares and the Frogs\\", appears among Aesop's Fables and is numbered 138 in the Perry Index.Aesopica As well as having an Asian analogue, there have been variant versions over the centuries. Stampeding before doom The oldest form of a fable involving a stampede started by a hare appears in the form of a cumulative tale known in the Buddhist scriptures as the Duddubha Jataka (332).Brelief On hearing the sound of a falling fruit, a hare sets all the other animals fleeing in the belief that the earth was collapsing. There the story is associated with the Indian idiom 'the sound the hare heard', meaning an impossibility. A much later Western equivalent is the folk tale of Henny Penny, where the associated idiom is 'the sky is falling'. In the Aesopic fable of \\"The Hares and the Frogs\\" the stampede is more limited. There are several versions in both Greek and Latin. In some the hares are set in motion by the sound of wind in the leaves; in others they call a meeting in which they come to the conclusion that their lives are so perpetually under threat that they may as well fling themselves into the river. As they are dashing towards it, however, they disturb the frogs on the bank who all leap into the water. Seeing this, a more thoughtful hare calls off the decision to kill themselves; if there are some creatures who can be frightened by hares, then their own lot cannot be as bad as they imagined. In the story retold about 1190 in Marie de France's Ysopet, the hares have decided to move to another land but halt when they see frogs leaping into a pond to escape them and come to the conclusion that \\"never will they find a kingdom, or come to a place on this earth, where everyone may live without fear, work or sorrow\\".Mary Lou Martin, The Fables of Marie de France, Birmingham AL 1939, p.81 The Jewish version of Marie's near contemporary, Berechiah ha-Nakdan, makes the band of emigrants terrified even of the croaking of frogs at night before deciding to return home.Fables of a Jewish Aesop, Columbia University 1967, Fable 38, pp.73-5 Two Neo-Latin poems are dedicated to the fable by Hieronymus Osius in his collection of 1564. In the first of these, he draws a parallel with human suffering and remarks that no- one really wishes to die;Fabulae Aesopi carmine elegiaco redditae, Fable 22 in the shorter poem that follows, the conclusion is that learning to overcome our fears is part of growing up.Fable 23 Eduard de Dene's Dutch version of the tale makes an emblematic appearance under the title \\"A stout heart is the remedy for fear\\", where it is given a religious interpretation.De warachtighe fabulen der dieren, 1567 p.64 The illustrator of that book was Marcus Gheeraerts the Elder, who eventually fled to England. His woodcut of the subject was to be reproduced there as a trencher, about the edge of which the gist of its moral is epitomised as needing to fear destruction of the soul rather than of the body.Cuniculture.info A century later, in 1668, the Classical story was told with stylish panache of a single hare in La Fontaine's Fables (II.14). During mediaeval times, some commentaries on the fable underlined the necessity of remaining philosophically contented. This theme was also taken up when the fable was included in Robert Dodsley's collection and subsequently reprinted in Thomas Bewick's illustrated edition of The Fables of Aesop in 1818. There it ends with the verse reflection, ::The miseries of half mankind unknown, ::Fools vainly think no sorrows like their own; ::But view the world and you will learn to bear ::Misfortunes well, since all men have their share.Bewick Fable 53 The same conclusion, that one should commiserate with the sufferings of others, was also the conclusion of the Neo- Latin retelling by Pantaleon Candidus at the start of the 17th century.Candidus poem 104 In the arts Under the Latin title of Lepores et ranae a Czech translation by Pavel Jurkovic was set by Ilja Hurn√≠k as the final piece in his Ezop for mixed choir and orchestra (1964).Discogs References External links 15th - 19th century illustrations Jataka tales Aesop's Fables La Fontaine's Fables Fictional hares and rabbits Animals in Buddhism ","title":"The Frightened Hares"},{"id":"46454699","text":"The 2011‚Äì12 Oman First Division League (known as the Omantel First Division League for sponsorship reasons) is the 36th edition of the second-highest division overall football league in Oman.

It opened on July 18, 1868, and closed in 1924 with the end of passenger service on the Bushwick Branch. Steam engines served the station until 1913. The station building made in brick survived until recently and was the last vestige of the passenger terminal of the Bushwick Branch. Before it was demolished, the building was used as an automobile repair shop.Picture of Bushwick Terminal The terminal building was replaced by a building that was in the process of being built in October 2007, and holds trucks.Teminal Building Replaced By Bushwick Yard Bushwick Yard consisted of 13 tracks, and one run around track. One of the tracks led to Bushwick Terminal. Currently the site is mostly occupied by a lumber yard, and is blocked off from the rest of the Bushwick Branch by a fence. Most of the tracks in the yard have been covered up by asphalt. At Bushwick Place and Johnson Avenue, there was the Long Island Rail Road Bushwick Freight Terminal. It was abandoned by the LIRR and was leased out for other uses, including a meat packing facility, and most recently, to a manufacturer of styrofoam coolers as a warehouse for styrofoam pellets. The roof had collapsed following a fire set by the resident homeless in May 2003. The building had been completely disused for about twenty years, but was still full of bags of styrofoam pellets at the time of demolition. The former LIRR freight office on Bushwick Place still stands.LIRR Freight Office In 1924, a temporary connection was built from Bushwick Yard that ran via Montrose Avenue and then connected to the New York City Subway's BMT Canarsie Line () under Bushwick Avenue, just near the Montrose Avenue station.

The first of the cars were delivered by this ramp on June 18, 1924, and passenger service on the BMT Canarsie Line began on September 21 the same year.

Their goal is to reunite pets with their families once they have recovered and reduce the number of animals surrendered to shelters due to sudden hardship. The team works with local chapters of the American Red Cross, fire departments, and other disaster relief organizations to provide search and rescue, emergency transport, veterinary care, shelter and supplies for affected pets, at no cost to their owners. History Red Paw Emergency Relief Team was conceived as a pilot program to develop a new kind of emergency response resource for animals. In 2006, the United States Congress recognized the importance of including pets in mass disaster planning with the passage of the Pets Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act, but no similar provision exists for victims of smaller scale disasters at the household level. Founder Jennifer Leary states that she was inspired to start Red Paw while a firefighter with the Philadelphia Fire Department after seeing how little help was available to pet owners in the aftermath of devastating house fires. Many local relief organizations offer temporary housing assistance for displaced people, but none include accommodations for pets. In particular, low income and uninsured families faced the difficult decision of leaving their pets behind in the ruined fire dwelling or surrendering them to animal control. In 2011, Leary presented a proposal to the American Red Cross of Southeastern Pennsylvania for an emergency service that would respond with the Red Cross and other relief agencies on the scene of household disasters where pets were involved. After months of preparation, Red Paw officially launched on July 25, 2011, and had its first clients‚Äîa family with six pit bull terriers‚Äîin a matter of hours. In spite of the Red Paw pilot being originally intended to serve Philadelphia exclusively, demand from surrounding suburban counties caused the group to expand quickly beyond the city limits. For her efforts in establishing Red Paw, Leary was profiled by CNN as part of its CNN Heroes series in 2014. In March 2014, Red Paw Emergency Relief Team was added to the Philadelphia Office of Emergency Management‚Äôs disaster plan. On April 24, 2014, the Philadelphia City Council honored Leary with a resolution for the founding of Red Paw and the organization‚Äôs contributions to the community. In the summer of 2014, the Office of Emergency Management requested Red Paw‚Äôs assistance to shelter neighborhood pets during the controlled implosion of the Philadelphia Housing Authority‚Äôs Queen Lane Apartments on September 13, 2014. On April 13, 2015, the City of Philadelphia recognized Red Paw volunteers for National Volunteer Week. In May 2015, Red Paw received a grant from NRG Energy subsidiary NRG Home for a new lead response vehicle. On April 10, 2016, the Philadelphia Office of Emergency Management declared Red Paw its \\"volunteers of the week\\" for National Volunteer Week. Services Red Paw Emergency Relief Team is a volunteer- based organization that responds 24/7, 365 days a year. It operates mainly in the Pennsylvania counties of Philadelphia, Bucks, Montgomery, Chester, and Delaware, with some services extended to neighboring counties and states in the Delaware Valley. Red Paw is called when residents with pets are displaced by a disaster affecting their home, such as fire, flood, collapse, explosion, natural gas or carbon monoxide leak, or other hazardous incident. The team provides search and rescue, emergency transportation and veterinary care for injured animals, and temporary boarding assistance. While in Red Paw care, animals receive wellness exams, vaccinations, and spay/neuter services, free of charge. Pets are then placed with volunteer fosters until they can be reunited with their owners. For specialist services, the team maintains partnerships with animal care providers - including veterinary hospitals, kennels, boarding and training facilities - in every county that it serves. In addition to providing emergency relief, Red Paw conducts volunteer training and public outreach and participates in fire safety and animal welfare events. The organization makes extensive use of social media to report its activities, promote emergency preparedness, fund raise, and recruit volunteers.Red Paw Emergency Relief Team maintains:  Governance A 501(c)(3) charitable organization, Red Paw Emergency Relief Team is funded through donations and grants. The team's leadership consists of two full-time staff and seven volunteer coordinators, who manage client and animal casework, fostering, adoptions, in-kind donations and events. Two per-diem emergency responders perform search and rescue and transport animals from the disaster scene. Red Paw's eleven-member advisory board is composed of representatives from the emergency services and animal welfare communities. A network of 500 volunteers train as emergency responders and support the team by fostering pets, staffing events, and transporting animals and supplies.

A PlayStation Vita version was announced but ultimately cancelled due to development issues. Hand of Fate has the player work their way through randomized dungeons, generated by cards selected from customizable decks, to try to reach a final boss of each dungeon. Most of the game is played through an in-game tabletop tableau, with the player's actions narrated and executed by the mysterious Dealer, at times requiring the player to make choices to proceed. When combat occurs, the game switches to a third-person perspective brawler-style game, requiring the player to time attacks, blocks, dodges, and other abilities to defeat enemies without losing all their health. As the player progresses, they can earn tokens, which, upon completion of a dungeon (successfully or not), gain them additional cards that they can use to customize their decks for the next dungeon run. Hand of Fate received generally positive reviews, and led to the successful crowdfunded physical variation of the game. A sequel, Hand of Fate 2, was released in November 2017. Gameplay Hand of Fate is an action role- playing video game with roguelike and deck-building elements. The player takes the role of a nameless hero that meets a strange Dealer voiced by Anthony Skordi, in a \\"cabin at the end of the world\\". This dealer narrates the player's adventure, dealing the game's cards, rewards, penalties, lore, and commentary. He also serves as the primary antagonist for the game. On starting a new game, the player is given a starting deck of cards, consisting of equipment, hero class, and encounter cards. The player earns more cards as they progress in the game, which they can use to customize their deck up to a fixed size. Furthermore, the dealer has his own deck from which surprising elements such as more challenging encounters and monsters are drawn that also grows as the player gains cards and progresses through the game. In the game's Story Mode, the player must defeat thirteen bosses: twelve court cards and the Dealer himself. These bosses, representing the royalty of each suit, must be defeated in order, but the player can return to previous bosses to challenge again and unlock new rewards. After a certain number of these bosses are defeated, the player also unlocks Endless Mode, which provides an infinite number of \\"floors\\" of increasing difficulty for the player to challenge with every card they have collected up to that point. To progress in Story Mode, the player must complete a \\"dungeon\\" by exploring two or more \\"floors\\" created by a tableau of randomized, face-down encounter cards dealt from the combined deck of both player and Dealer. In addition to random encounters, each floor also includes either an exit encounter that lets the player reach the next floor or a boss encounter on the final floor of that dungeon. The player starts with a limited amount of health, food, and initial equipment, modified by the player's selected class card and certain conditions obtained over the course of the story. To navigate each floor of the dungeon, the player moves a token across the tableau one card at a time, revealing it if face down. When each card is encountered, the Dealer narrates the event and resolves its effects. Events can include meeting non-player characters, shops to buy and sell cards that benefit the player for the remainder of that dungeon, enemy encounters, or chance events that may benefit or hinder the player. Some of these events include a tree of options that the player can choose, while chance is presented as four shuffled cards representing rates of success or failure. Each movement step consumes food, and certain events can cause the player to gain or lose health, food, gold, blessings, curses, or equipment. The latter three can augment the player's attack power, defensive power, health, speed, or provide special abilities or conditions both inside and out of combat. If the player encounters a monster or maze of traps, the number and type of enemy are determined by cards drawn by the Dealer (if any). The game then enters a third-person perspective action mode, where the player can attack, dodge, reflect and counterattack enemies and traps represented by the cards that were drawn. Damage taken is reflected in the player's overall health, which can be recovered normally with food or at certain shops and healers. On completing some encounters, the Dealer will present special tokens representing new cards that the player will receive at the conclusion of that dungeon, regardless of whether they won or were defeated. If the player's character loses all of their health (i.e., by encounter or starvation) or chooses to forfeit from the in-game menu, they lose that dungeon, and the board is reset after they receive their tokens. If the player successfully beats the dungeon's boss, they progress one step forward in the story. The Dealer awaits the player for the final showdown and confrontation, so the player must pay close attention to deck-building, strategy, tactics, and chance in order to succeed. Development Hand of Fate was first shown at the 2013 Game Developers Conference. A playable demo build was shown to the public at PAX Australia in July 2013. By this point, the game had been in development for under six months. Defiant Development are a team of approximately fifteen based in Brisbane, they described Hand of Fate as their \\"first big push\\" onto PC platforms following their previous mobile projects. Like all other Defiant games, Hand of Fate is built in Unity. The game was part funded through a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign. It was one of the first Australian projects to launch on Kickstarter. The campaign launched in November 2013 and concluded in December 2013, achieving its target. Not only was the campaign a financial success, it also allowed Defiant to build an audience and get feedback on pre-release builds. A Greenlight campaign was launched simultaneously so that the game could be released on Steam, and the game was approved in January 2014. A week following the crowdfunding campaign, an alpha build was released for Kickstarter backers. A beta version followed in February 2014, and in July, the game launched for Windows, OS X, and Linux on Steam Early Access. The full version was released for Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on 17 February 2015. A sequel, Hand of Fate 2, had been announced with a planned early 2017 release, but was eventually first released on November 7, 2017 for personal computers and PlayStation 4, with an Xbox One version to release shortly afterwards. The sequel adds more challenges that the player must meet to proceed in dungeons, stronger monsters to face in battle, and companions that can be gained during the adventure which assist the player in combat. Hand of Fate 2 will also release on the Nintendo Switch on July 17, 2018. Hand of Fate represents Defiant's first major success. The studio had been founded in 2010 in Brisbane, Australia, and initially had developed in the mobile game arena with titles like Ski Safari and Rocket Bunnies. Following Hand of Fate 2, Defiant had begun development of a next game, The World In My Attic (a working title). The game had featured a family that discovered a board game, Hexes & Heroes, that provided a gateway to a fantasy world based on the game. Players, controlling the family members would place hexagonal tiles on an ever-changing board and then become involved in an action-adventure-style game within that tile, similar in nature to progression in Hand of Fate. However, on July 23, 2019, Defiant announced they were shutting down, citing the inability for the studio to adapt to \\"changes both big and small\\", but will retain a small staff to maintain support for the Hand of Fate titles. Board game Defiant worked with the board game development company Rule & Make to transition the video game into a deck- building game called Hand of Fate: Ordeals. The board game allows for one to four players to cooperatively work together to process through quests in a similar manner as the video game. They sought about $22,000 in crowd-funding for publication via a Kickstarter campaign in May 2017; the campaign surpassed its goal within a day, and ended with more than $360,000 pledged.  Release  In July 2016, Defiant partnered with IndieBox to produce an exclusive, custom-designed, physical release of Hand of Fate. This individually-numbered collector's box included a themed USB drive with DRM-free copy of the game, official soundtrack, instruction manual, Steam key, and several custom-made collectibles. Reception Hand of Fate received positive reviews. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the Microsoft Windows version 81.58% based on 13 reviews and 78/100 based on 27 reviews, the Xbox One version 79.75% based on 12 reviews and 80/100 based on 11 reviews and the PlayStation 4 version 79.28% based on 18 reviews and 79/100 based on 15 reviews. The game sold about 400,000 copies across personal computers and consoles, and it was downloaded more than 1.5 million times as part of a free game promotion for Xbox Live.

Altmann selected Randol Schoenberg, a Californian lawyer with an Austrian background, to represent her in her legal quest to recover the five Klimts. Altmann and Schoenberg were assisted by Hubertus Czernin, an Austrian journalist who had previously investigated and revealed the World War II activities of Kurt Waldheim, former President of Austria and UN Secretary General. Altmann's legal battle eventually ended up in the US Supreme Court where she had to face not only Austria but also the US State Department. The US Supreme Court gave jurisdiction over Austria and an Austrian arbitration panel then decided that the five paintings belonged to her. Ronald Lauder paid $135 million for the Woman in Gold to hang in his Neue Galerie in New York. The other paintings were sold through Christie's to private buyers.

(French) Choufett became a lawyer and was admitted to the Bars of Lyon and Villefranche-sur-Sa√¥ne in 1924. In 1925, he became mayor of Villefranche- sur-Sa√¥ne and served consecutive terms, with a brief interruption between 1941 and 1947. As mayor, he modernized the city, endowing it with a covered market, a new town hall, and several sports facilities. In 1928, he became a member of Parliament. In the Chamber of Deputies, he was very involved in military matters and served as vice-president of the Armed Forces Committee. Re-elected in 1936, at the same time as the victory of the Popular Front, he voted in favour of the delegation of full powers to Marshall P√©tain on July, 1940. In Vichy he signed a declaration concerning the National Assembly. This document, drafted by Gaston Bergery, denounced the Third Republic, claimed a new authoritarian, national and social order, asked for the return of the government in Paris, and called for renewed relations with Germany. It was in this text that the term \\"collaboration‚Äù appeared for the first time. Chouffet did not move ahead in this path, and his attitude over Vichy‚Äôs government caused him to be dismissed from his mandate in 1941. He became one of the main men responsible for the Network called ‚ÄúMithridate‚Äù from 1942 to the end of hostilities. Despite controversies with local resistants about his vote in favour of P√©tain, he regained the town hall of Villefranche sur Sa√¥ne in 1947, and in 1956 he was reintegrated into the Socialist party. His funeral in 1958 was a large public gathering. Today his chest takes centre stage in the town hall, and a huge sports complex bears his name.

The episode was written and storyboarded by Jesse Moynihan, from an outline by Pendleton Ward, Adam Muto, Kent Osborne, and Jack Pendarvis. The episode debuted on November 25, 2014, the second episode to air as part of Cartoon Network's \\"Corn-Ooo-Copia\\", a week of new Adventure Time episodes. It guest stars both Kumail Nanjiani as Prismo and Ron Perlman as The Lich. The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Jake begins acting strangely following a memorial service for Prismo. Finn soon realizes that the real Jake has been transported into Prismo's alternate dimension. After recreating the elaborate ritual that triggered the events, Finn is also transported to the dimension, wherein he runs into a program of Prismo. This program explains an elaborate plan that will allow Prismo to be resurrected. Both Finn and Jake follow Prismo's instructions, and are successful in reviving their friend. The episode was the second installment of the series to have been solo-storyboarded by Moynihan. On his personal website, he wrote that this was the episode that started to wear down his mental defenses, which resulted in some of his best and \\"weirdest\\" writing in the latter half of the show's sixth season. The episode, which received largely positive reviews from both The Atlantic and The A.V. Club, was viewed by 1.76 million viewers. Plot Finn and Jake perform an elaborate ritual involving Prismo's (voiced by Kumail Nanjiani) homemade pickles as a memorial to their fallen friend. That night, unbeknownst to Finn, Jake is transported to Prismo's reality, while a doppelg√§nger of Jake lingers in Ooo. The doppelg√§nger goes about repeating past antics of Jake, dissipating into a cloud of smoke every time Finn interrupts him. Finn eventually realizes that by recreating the events of the previous night with Jake's doppelg√§nger, he will be able to track down the real Jake. Meanwhile, Jake wanders through Prismo's reality, which being timeless, is replaying past events, over and over again. after hearing Prismo's voice, he follows it, all the while contemplating Prismo's philosophy on relationships, as well as his death. Soon, Jake discovers a bed, and, after falling asleep, Prismo is resurrected. Eventually, Finn enters into Prismo's reality and runs into a pre-programmed version of Prismo; this \\"Plan B\\" was created by Prismo in case he himself were ever killed. Plan B Prismo convinces Finn to wake up Jake. With Jake having been awoken, Plan B Prismo reveals his plan to the two: while one version of Jake (the one Plan B Prismo is talking to) will return to Ooo, an alternate reality version of Jake will sleep for eternity, allowing Prismo Prime to return to life. In order to achieve this, Finn must stop himself from waking Jake up. Finn does as told, causing the other version of Finn to condense into a sword. Prismo is thus successfully resurrected. Production \\"Is That You?\\" was the second episode of the series to have been solo-storyboarded by Jesse Moynihan. \\"Is That You?\\" was written and storyboarded by Jesse Moynihan, from a story by Pendleton Ward, Adam Muto, Kent Osborne, and Jack Pendarvis. This episode marks the second time that Moynihan storyboarded an episode entirely by himself, after the previous season six episode \\"Something Big\\". On his personal website, Moynihan wrote that his work on this episode started to wear down his mental defenses, which resulted in some of his best and \\"weirdest\\" writing in the latter half of the show's sixth season. Art direction was handled by Nick Jennings, whereas supervising direction was helmed by Andres Salaff. The scenes wherein Jake's essence replays past events recall moments from many of the series' previous episodes. These events include Jake burying his Everything Burrito (from the third season episode \\"Conquest of Cuteness\\"), dancing with a Dancing Bug (from the second season episode \\"Power Animal\\"), discussing his imprisonment by Kee-Oth (from the fifth season episode \\"The Pit\\"), making bacon pancakes (from the fourth season episode \\"Burning Low\\"), talking to Finn about what happens after death (from the third-season episode \\"The New Frontier\\"), and challenging Finn to a \\"Tough Boys\\" contest (from the second- season episode \\"Crystals Have Power\\"). Reception \\"Is That You?\\" first aired on Cartoon Network on November 25, the second episode to air as part of Cartoon Network's \\"Corn-Ooo-Copia\\", a week of new Adventure Time episodes. The episode was viewed by 1.76 million viewers, according to Douglas Pucci. David Sims of The Atlantic praised the episode, calling it one of the best television episodes of any series that aired during 2014. He was complimentary towards the plot, applauding the show's ingenuity in having Prismo resurrect himself via \\"dream pickles, time loops, and causality.\\" Despite noting that the episode may seem confusing to a newer viewer of the series, Sims felt that the episode represented the series at \\"its very best‚Äîquietly emotional, brazenly hallucinatory, and whimsical without ever seeming cheesy.\\" Likewise, Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an \\"A\\" and concluded that the episode \\"does fascinating things with structure while highlighting the imagination and humor that makes this show such a delight week after week.\\" Sava applauded the episode's use of clips from previous episodes, noting that while they do highlight past events, the result \\"never feels like a clip show.\\" Finally, he was complimentary towards DiMaggio's vocal performance, and Moynihan's handling of the show's dialogue.

In 2009, Huston completed the first successful unsupported American expedition to the North Pole. He has also completed expeditions to the South Pole, Greenland, and Ellesmere Island. Huston is the co-author of Forward: The First American Unsupported Expedition to the North Pole.  Biography  Huston started his career in Minnesota‚Äôs Boundary Waters. From 2000 to 2005, Huston worked full- time at Outward Bound, an expedition school that leads active learning trips. In the spring of 2005, Huston was the only North American selected to join a team of Norwegians restaging Roald Amundsen‚Äôs 1911 expedition to the South Pole for a History Channel and BBC documentary. The expedition team skied and dog sledded 1400 miles over 72 days on the Greenland icecap, using 1911 period clothing, equipment and food. During December 2007 and January 2008, Huston led a full-length ski expedition to the South Pole, covering 720 miles in 57 days. In April 2009, Huston and his expedition partner, Tyler Fish, traveled unsupported from land to the North Pole. In doing so, they became the first North Americans to complete this trip. Th 55-day, 475-mile journey had been accomplished by 13 prior expeditions and is considered the toughest expedition on the planet by many in the polar exploration industry. Huston highlights themes of this expedition in his motivational lectures. In March 2013, Huston (United States), Tobias Thorleifsson (Norway), Hugh Dale-Harris (Canada), and Kyle O‚ÄôDonoghue (South Africa), an expedition filmmaker, completed a 630-mile expedition on Ellesmere Island in the Canadian High Arctic. The team filmed their expedition for the documentary New Land 2013. Recently, Huston has worked as a guide in polar base camps, where he has assisted film crews and scientists operating in temperatures down to -57 ¬∞F (-50 ¬∞C). Huston currently consults with other polar expeditions to run logistics, safety and communications for teams on the ice. He also advises and serves as a safety auditor for educational outdoor programs like Project Wildcat, a backpacking program that Huston co-founded in 1996 for incoming students at Northwestern University.  Personal life  Huston trains daily. He spends his downtime cooking, reading, and traveling. He lives in on the shores of Lake Michigan in Evanston, Illinois with his wife.  Degrees  Bachelor of Arts in History, Anthropology, and Geography from Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois  Expeditions   New Land ‚Äì Ellesmere Island, Canada (2013)  Huston and his teammates, Tobias Thorleifsson, Hugh Dale-Harris, and Kyle O‚ÄôDonoghue, retraced portions of Norwegian explorer Otto Sverdrup‚Äôs 2nd Fram expedition on Ellesmere Island. They made the documentary film Mystery of the Arctic Cairn about their journey. The team skijored over 600 miles in 65 days.  Victorinox North Pole Expedition (2009)  Huston completed the first American unsupported expedition to the North Pole with Tyler Fish. They finished 478 miles in 55 days with no resupplies.  NorthWinds Vision South Pole Expedition (2007-2008)  Huston lead this 720-mile ski expedition to the South Pole in 57 days, with resupplies.  Global Warming 101 Expedition ‚Äì Baffin Island, Canada (2007)  Huston worked as the on-site expedition manager for this Will Steger-led team. This 100-day dogsled expedition linked Inuit villages to schools in the U.S. and Canada.  The Modern Amundsen Expedition ‚Äì Greenland (2005)  Huston worked as a dog musher on a team of Norwegian explorers to re-stage Roald Amundsen‚Äôs race to the South Pole for a BBC and History Channel documentary film project. Rune Gjeldnes led the expedition team of Harald Kippenes, Ketil Reitan, and Inge Soleheim. The team spent 72 days traveling 1,400 miles by dogsled and cross country ski, using only 1911-style food, clothing and equipment.  Guiding  John has been guiding since 1996.

She is best remembered for her sinking in bad weather on 30 November 1854 with the loss of all hands, most likely after colliding with The Stones, a notoriously dangerous reef off Godrevy Head in Cornwall. Construction and use The Nile, an iron-hulled screw steamer, was built at Dumbarton in 1850. She was first operated by the Moss Line of Liverpool and inaugurated the line's Mediterranean service. In 1853 her ownership passed to James Stirling of Dublin and her operations to the British and Irish Steam Packet Company. Loss On her last voyage, Nile was travelling from Liverpool to London, calling at Penzance, Falmouth, Plymouth and Portsmouth en route. She was carrying a cargo of heavy merchandise and could also accommodate passengers at low rates, though due to the late time of year few people would have taken such a roundabout route. She had been due to leave Liverpool on Sunday 26 November but due to bad weather had to delay her journey for two days. She left Liverpool on the evening of Tuesday 28 November and was last seen about from the Longships Lighthouse on the evening of 30 November, making her way through rough seas and high winds. The following day, a ship sailing from Hayle to Penzance spotted oil floating on the water. Later on 1 December it became apparent that an accident had overtaken the Nile when papers addressed to the captain, spars, empty casks and other debris were washed ashore at Portreath. The ship's stern was spotted a day or two later and several bodies, five of which were female, were washed ashore at Tehidy. One of them was identified as the stewardess of the Nile. Cause and casualties of the disaster The cause of the disaster was not definitively established. It is likely that the captain, W.F. Moppett of Dublin, drifted off course by about 18 to 20 miles in the bad weather, resulting in the ship hitting The Stones. The Nile may have managed to back away from the rocks but foundered in 12 to 14 fathoms of water. Those aboard were either unable to escape due to the ship's rapid disintegration or were overwhelmed by the waves when they tried to launch the lifeboats. The ship was thought to have struck the rocks around 2 or 3 am shortly after the flood tide, judging by the disposition of the wreckage in St Ives Bay. There were about 24 crew aboard, consisting of the captain, two mates, a steward and stewardess, carpenter, boatswain, 18 engineers, stokers and sailors. The number of passengers was unclear. Several missed the ship's departure due to its late exit from Liverpool. One man had a fortunate escape when he spent too long drinking ashore with a friend and missed the ship's departure. He hurried on to Bristol via another steamer and travelled overland to Hayle to catch up with the Nile so that he could be reunited with his luggage, which was still aboard, but found on arriving that he had lost his luggage but saved his life. Another man arrived at the ship just as the bridge to the deck was being removed and offered a shilling to a porter to replace it, but was refused; he thus missed the departure and unknowingly escaped the shipwreck. The value of the Nile was estimated at around ¬£40,000 to ¬£50,000 (around ¬£3.2 million to ¬£4 million in 2013 prices) and was almost fully insured, but much of the cargo ‚Äì mainly goods from Manchester despatched to drapers at Penzance, Truro and Falmouth ‚Äì was uninsured and the consignees suffered heavy losses as a result of the sinking. Aftermath The sinking prompted complaints that nothing had been done to address the long-standing risks that The Stones posed to shipping. Richard Short, a St Ives master mariner, wrote to the Shipping and Mercantile Gazette the day after the news of the sinking broke to note: \\"[H]ad there been a light on Godrevy Island, which the inhabitants of this town have often applied for, it would not doubt have been the means of warning the ill- fated ship of the dangerous rocks she was approaching. Many applications have been made from time to time concerning the erection of a light to warn mariners against this dangerous reef, but it has never been attended to, and to that account may be attributed the destruction of hundreds of lives and a mass of property ... Scarcely a month passes by in the winter season without some vessel striking on these rocks, and hundreds of poor fellows have perished there in dark dreary nights without one being left to tell the tale.\\" Further though less lethal accidents followed, prompting a local clergyman, the Rev. J.W. Murray of Hayle, to start a petition to Trinity House to build a lighthouse on the island. The petitioners were informed in October 1856 that Trinity House had agreed to build the Godrevy Lighthouse, which began operating in 1859.

It is part of the community of Welshpool and also lends its name to an electoral ward. Llanerchydol Hall Llanerchydol Hall Llanerchydol Hall, a Grade II* Listed Building, is located in parkland between the A458 to Llanfair Caereinion and A490 to Llanfyllin. The Hall is a fine and largely intact early 19th-century picturesque Gothic Revival style house, with well preserved park and gardens. The site has a long history of occupation, including a Tudor house which burnt down in about 1776, after which David Pugh, a local man who made a fortune selling tea in London, bought the site and built a new house which became known as Llanerchydol Hall. History Medieval commotes of Wales (Llannerch Hudol and Y Gorddwr shown as question marks to the south and east respectively of Ystrad Marchell) Llanerchydol is named after and is near the northern border of Llannerch Hudol (also written Llannerchwdwl, Llannerchudol, Llanerchudol or Llanerchydol), which was a medieval commote (cwmwd) in the cantref of Ystlyg in the Kingdom of Powys. It was in the south-east of the kingdom (north Powys today), close to the border with England. It was a small commote bordering Y Gorddwr on the east beyond the River Severn, Ystrad Marchell in the north, Caereinion on the west and Cedewain south of the River Rhiw at Berriew. From the 11th century it was involved in the conflicts between the Norman Marcher Lords and the princes of Powys. When the kingdom of Powys was divided, after the death in 1160 of Madog ap Maredudd, the last prince of the whole of Powys, Llannerch Hudol was given to his illegitimate son Caswallon together with the commote of Broniarth, it subsequently became part of the principality of Powys Wenwynwyn. Its main centre was possibly the Welshpool motte and bailey castle (Domen Castell) built by Cadwgan ap Bleddyn in 1111, but there are at least three other motte and baileys within the small commote including Powis Castle (Castell Coch) and Ladies Mount. Together with Ystrad Marchell and Deuddwr it formed the Teirswydd (\\"three commotes\\") which were among the lands restored into the possession of Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn in return for his homage and fealty by Llywelyn ap Gruffudd at Ystumanner in 1263. Placename Llannerch Hudol literally means \\"Magic Glade\\" or \\"Wizard's Glade\\". However, it is common for Welsh placenames to be based on the name of a saint (llan, meaning \\"church\\" or \\"parish\\", followed by the name or a mutation of it); so it could mean, for example, \\"Enchanted Parish of St [Unknown]\\".

The use of music to cope with stress is an example of an emotion-focused, adaptive coping strategy. Rather than focusing on the stressor itself, music therapy is typically geared towards reducing or eliminating the emotions that arise in response to stress. In essence, advocates of this therapy claim that the use of music helps to lower stress levels in patients, as well as lower more biologically measurable quantities such as the levels of epinephrine and cortisol. Additionally, music therapy programs have been repeatedly demonstrated to reduce depression and anxiety symptoms in the long term. Major theories In the context of psychology, a coping strategy is any technique or practice designed to reduce or manage the negative effects associated with stress. While stress is known to be a natural biological response, biologists and psychologists have repeatedly demonstrated that stress in excess can lead to negative effects on one's physical and psychological well-being.Robert M. Sapolsky. Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers: An Updated Guide To Stress, Stress Related Diseases, and Coping. 2nd Rev Ed, April 15, 1998. W. H. Freeman Elevated stress levels can lead to conditions including mental illnesses, cardiovascular conditions, eating disorders, gastrointestinal complications, sexual dysfunction, and skin and hair problems. The variety and potential fatality from these conditions push the need for a coping mechanism to reduce the manifestations associated with stress. While there are hundreds of different coping strategies, the use of music is one specific example of a coping strategy that is used to combat the negative effects of stress. Due to the substantially large number of strategies to choose from, psychologists break down coping strategies into three types:Weiten, W. & Lloyd, M.A. (2008) Psychology Applied to Modern Life (9th ed.). Wadsworth Cengage Learning. # Appraisal-based - Intended to modify the individual's thought process Stress is typically eliminated through rationalization, changes in values or thinking patterns, or with humor. # Problem-based - Targets the cause of the stress. The process could either involve eliminating or adapting to a stressor in order to cope. An example of a problem based strategy is time management. # Emotion-based - Geared towards influencing one's emotional reactions when stressed. Meditation, distractions, or the release of emotion are all forms of emotion-based coping strategies. Mindfulness-based stress reduction is another example of this, as it is a more personal reflection based aspect of coping. Since music-based coping is designed to modify an individual's emotional reactions to a certain event, it is best classified as an emotion-based coping strategy. Rather than attempting to directly influence or eliminate a particular stressor, music-based coping relies on influencing an individual's emotional and mental reaction to the stressor. Music assuages stress by either reducing or altering emotional response or alleviate some of the physiological effects of the stress response. Major empirical findings Psychologists and medical practitioners have recently focused more time and attention on the concept of music as a coping strategy and the effects of its use on patients. In literature linking music and stress, empirical findings are typically grouped together according to the method in which they are gathered. For example, some methods may include studies like survey questions or more invasive methods of study like invasive psychoacoustic observations. Despite the fact that different methods are used, most of these studies demonstrate the impact different types of music have on human emotions. Patient response-based findings One of the more popular methods used to collect data on coping strategies involves the use of non-invasive, patient response-based methods. This method is directed more towards the psychological realm, in that the methods used to collect data were not very invasive but more of a ‚Äútell me how you feel‚Äù type of question/response system. Once the findings had been gathered, statistical analysis was performed in an effort to discover a correlation between the coping mechanism and its effect on the stress response. These non-invasive treatments are more popular among children and elderly patients, since they prevent the results from being altered due to the patients's nervousness. Proponents of these methods claim that if children are prompted with general, unthreatening questions, they are much more comfortable and willing to provide accurate accounts of their levels of stress. In several studies using non- invasive methods, music has been documented as being effective in reducing the subject's perceived level of stress. =Music and effects on psychological trauma= Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychological stress disorder that involves the experience of strong emotional reactions due to traumatic events in an individual's past. PTSD is almost always a result of a traumatic experience. Certain triggers, such as images, sounds, or other significant sensory details associated with the experience can evoke extreme stress responses, panic attacks, or severe anxiety. PTSD is commonly experienced by veterans of armed conflicts, and can be frequently diagnosed in victims of rape or other violent assaults.\\"PTSD\\". US Department of Veterans Affairs. Accessed Apr. 9 2015. http://www.ptsd.va.gov/ If an individual diagnosed with PTSD associates a certain song with a traumatic memory, it typically triggers a stronger stress/anxiety response than the individual would otherwise have otherwise experienced when listening to the song. While one cannot assume that music is the only factor that triggers PTSD-influenced stress and panic attacks, these can be especially memorable because of music's rhythm, beat, and/or memorable lyrics. However, associating music with psychological responses is not necessarily guaranteed to bring up bad memories, because music can often hold psychological connotations to very happy memories. For example, it has been demonstrated that supplying the residents of nursing homes with iPods that feature nostalgic music is a means of reducing the stress of the elderly.Music and Memories Music has been used to treat dementia patients by utilizing methods similar to the treatments that are used in the management of PTSD. However, in the treatment of dementia, more emphasis is placed on providing the patient with music that triggers pleasant memories or feelings, rather than avoiding music that triggers negative emotions. After the music is listened to, one sees the change in mood and attitude from closed and distant to joyful, open and happy. There is a wealth of anecdotal evidence demonstrating the effectiveness that music can have as a coping response in this regard. For example, if a patient of either PTSD or dementia were to have a loved one die, he or she might associate a certain song with the person being mourned for, and hearing that song could bring about feelings of happiness or deep sadness. In addition, if there was a certain connection between them, such as in marriage, and their wedding song came on, an overly powerful emotional reaction could occur. These overly emotional situations trigger memories and a stress response that anguishes the person remembering these hurtful memories. A certain song that pertains to that memory can trigger nearly any emotion. Music's effects on Dementia patients have shown to bring them out of their shell, and engage them in singing and being happy, opposed to their usual closed and distant personalities. The patients have been shown to sing and perk up, even cry out of pure joy of the music that they loved in their youth. After the patients listen to their music they were interviewed and actually engaged, because of how happy the music had made them. The patients talked about how much they loved the music and the memories that the music invoked. =Stress and music in the medical field= The use of music as a coping strategy also has applications in the medical field. For example, patients who listen to music during surgery or post-operative recovery have been shown to have less stress than their counterparts who do not listen to music. Studies have shown that the family members and parents of the patient had reduced stress levels when listening to music while waiting, and can even reduce their anxiety for the surgery results. The use of music has also been proven effective in pediatric oncology. Music therapy is mainly used in these cases as a diversion technique, play therapy, designed to distract the patient from the pain or stress experienced during these operations. The focus of the patient is directed at a more pleasurable activity and the mind shifts toward that activity creating a ‚Äúnumbing‚Äù effect founded on an ‚Äúout of sight, out of mind‚Äù type approach. This can even transcend to elderly patients in nursing homes and adult day care centers. Music therapy in these places have shown reductions in elder aggression and agitated moods. However, because several of these studies rely mainly on patient responses, some concerns have been raised as to the strength of the correlation between music and stress reduction. Music as a form of coping has been used multiple times in cancer patients, with promising results. A study done on 113 patients going through stem cell transplants split the patients into two group; one group made their own lyrics about their journey and then produced a music video, and the other group listened to audiobooks. The results of the study showed that the music video group had better coping skills and better social interactions in comparison, by taking their mind of the pain and stress accompanying treatment, and giving them an outlet to express their feelings. Another study done at UNC showed remarkable improvement in a young girl who was born without the ability to speak. A therapist would come in and sing with her, as the only thing she could do was sing. Miraculously, the singing allowed to her gain the ability of speech, as music and speech are similar in nature and help the brain form new connections. In the same hospital, the therapist visits children daily and plays music with them, singing and using instruments. The music fosters creativity and reduces stress associated with treatments, and takes the children's minds off of their current surroundings. It also cannot be ignored the importance of coping strategies in families and caregivers of those going through serious and even terminal illness. These family members are often responsible for a vast majority of the care of their loved ones, on top of the stress of seeing them struggle. Therapists have worked with these family members, singing and playing instruments, to help them take their minds off of the stress of helping their loved ones undergo treatment. Just like in the patients themselves, the music therapy has been shown to help them cope with the intense emotions and situations they deal with on a daily basis. Physiological findings Other studies, which use more invasive techniques to measure the response of individuals to stress, demonstrate that the use of music can mitigate many of the physiological effects often associated with the stress response - such as a lowering of blood pressure or a decrease in heart rate. Most research associated with the use of music as a coping strategy makes use of empirical measurements through devices like an EKG or heart rate monitor in order to provide a stronger correlation between music and its proposed effects on the stress response. In these studies, subjects are typically exposed to a stressor and then assigned music to listen to, while the parties conducting the study measure changes in the subjects' physiological status. Some studies, using more invasive physiological research methods, have demonstrated that the use of sedative music or preferred sedative music cause a decrease in tension and state-anxiety levels of adult individuals. This decrease in tension or feeling of anxiety is more prevalent and noticeable in the attempt to return to homeostasis, and shows far less effectiveness during the actual stressful event. Other studies expose their subjects to an immediate physical stressor, such as running on a treadmill, while having them listen to different genres of music. These studies have shown that the respiratory rates of the participants are increased when they listen to faster, upbeat music while running in comparison to no music or sedative music. In addition to the raised respiratory frequency caused by the initial stressor \\"running\\" music still had a noticeable physiological effect on the participants. By and large, a collective review of these studies shows that music can be effective in reducing physiological effects that stress has on the human body. This can be anywhere from changing pulse rates, breathing rates, to even decreasing the occurrence of fatigue. This can even be seen in different tempo's and pitch, such as low pitch creates a relatively calming effect on the body whereas high pitch tends to generate stressors for the body. Furthermore, it has been suggested that if a patient can control the music that he or she listens to in the recovery process, then the return to normalcy happens at a much faster, more efficient rate than if the subject was assigned a music genre that he or she did not find appealing. With the use of the EKG monitor and other empirical methods of study, researchers are able to remove the superficial qualities associated with patient response-based findings and provide a more substantial correlation between the use of music and its effects on the human stress response. Specific techniques One particular technique that uses music as a coping strategy is choosing and listening to music genres that have been shown to correlate with lower levels of stress. For example, it has been suggested that listening to classical music or self-selected music can lower stress levels in adult individuals. Music that is fast, heavy or even dark in nature may produce an increase in these same stress levels, however many people also find the cathartic effects of music to be intensified with the listening of music that is intense in such a way. Ambient music is a genre of music that is often associated with feelings of calmness or introspectiveness. While listening to self-selected genres, an individual is provided with a sense of control after choosing the type of music he or she would like to listen to. In certain situations, this choice can be one of the few moments where stressed and depressed individuals feel a locus of control over their respective lives. Introducing the feeling of control can be a valuable asset as the individual attempts to cope with his or her stress. With that in mind, there are a few specific techniques specifically involving the use of music that have been suggested to aid in the reduction of stress and stress-related effects. * Listening to softer genres such as classical music. * Listening to music of one's choice and introducing an element of control to one's life. * Listening to music that reminds one of pleasant memories. * Avoiding music that reminds one of sad or depressing memories. * Listening to music as a way of bonding with a social group. Another specific technique that can be used is the utilization of music as a ‚Äúmemory time machine‚Äù of sorts. In this regard, music can allow one to escape to pleasant or unpleasant memories and trigger a coping response. It has been suggested that music can be closely tied to re-experiencing the psychological aspects of past memories, so selecting music with positive connotations is one possible way that music can reduce stress. A technique that is starting to be employed more often is vibroacoustic therapy. During therapy the patient lies on his/her back on a mat with speakers within it that send out low frequency sound waves, essentially sitting on a subwoofer. This therapy has been found to help with Parkinson's disease, fibromyalgia, and depression. Studies are also being conducted on patients with mild Alzheimer's disease in hopes to identify possible benefits from vibroacoustic therapy. Vibroacoustic therapy can also be used as an alternative to music therapy for the deaf. Controversies Several of the empirical studies carried out to demonstrate the correlation between listening to music and the reduction in the human stress response have been criticized for relying too heavily on a small sample size. Another criticism of these studies is that they have been carried out in response to no stressor in particular. These critics claim that because no specific stressor is identified in many of these studies, it is somewhat difficult to identify whether the stress response was lessened by music or by some other means. A more theoretical critique of this coping strategy is that the use of music in stress coping is largely a short-term coping response and therefore lacks long-term sustainability. These critics argue that while music may be effective in lowering perceived stress levels of patients, it is not necessarily making a difference on the actual cause of the stress response. Because the root cause of the stress is not affected, it is possible that the stress response may return shortly after therapy is ended. Those who hold this position advocate instead for a more problem-focused coping strategy that directly deals with the stressors affecting the patient. Conclusion The use of music as a stress coping strategy has a demonstrated effect on the human response to stress. The use of music has been proven to lower the perceived levels of stress in patients, while greatly reducing the physical manifestations of stress as well‚Äì such as heart rate, blood pressure, or levels of stress hormones. It seems as though different types of music have different effects on stress levels, with classical and self-selected genres being the most effective. However, despite demonstrated effectiveness in empirical studies, there are many who still question the effectiveness of this coping strategy. Nevertheless, it is still an attractive option for some patients who want an easy and inexpensive way to respond to stress.

Crosswell is in the parish of Meline, the greater part of which is in the Preseli Mountains, and is in the community of Eglwyswrw. History Name The well at Crosswell and the former inn beyond The hamlet's name is from the Welsh: ffynnon (well) and groes (cross). Inn An inn once stood in the centre of the hamlet; not on the 1842 parish tithe map (though marked on pre-1850 parish maps), the inn is on the 1891 Ordnance Survey map as the Cwmgloyne Arms. The name may originate with Cwmgloyne, a mansion near Hen-llys, and the home of the antiquarian Thomas Lloyd who \\"dying as a bachelor, left his estate by will to Maurice Williams\\". Now a private dwelling called Ty Ffynnongroes (Crosswell House), the former inn was Grade II listed in 1997.

Designed by New York City architect Bruce Price and built in 1895, the French Chateau-style building was one of the most elaborate built in Bar Harbor during its heyday as a summer resort. It is now part of the campus of the College of the Atlantic, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Description and history The Turrets is located on the shore of Frenchman Bay on the campus of the College of the Atlantic, northwest of Bar Harbor's central business district. It is a large three-to- four story granite building, with a complex roof line that includes many projections, turrets, and dormers. The front facade faces west, away from the water, and is roughly divided into five sections. The central section, four stories in height, has a porte-cochere in front, supported by Ionic columns, with a heavy turned balustrade. The second floor has a group of three windows, topped by arched panels with fleur-de-lis, and the third also has three windows, divided by Ionic columns. The fourth floor is a mansard-style roof with a dormer. To the left of the central section are a three-story wing and a two-story kitchen wing, between which stands a secondary entrance that has a masonry portico topped by a turret. To the right of the central section stands a three-story round tower with a conical cap, beyond which is a three-story wing with a rounded corner. The interior of the house includes a grand staircase and a paneled dining room. John J. Emery, a wealthy Cincinnati businessman, commissioned the construction of The Turrets, which was completed in 1895. It joined a number of elegant summer houses that lined Bar Harbor's coast, many of which were destroyed in a devastating fire in 1947. The Turrets stood vacant for many years before its acquisition by the College of the Atlantic in the 1970s.

The trajectories of free surface particles are close circles (in cyan), and the flow velocity is shown in red, for the black particles. The wave height ‚Äì difference between the crest and trough elevation ‚Äì is denoted as H, the wavelength as lambda and the phase speed as c. In fluid dynamics, a trochoidal wave or Gerstner wave is an exact solution of the Euler equations for periodic surface gravity waves. It describes a progressive wave of permanent form on the surface of an incompressible fluid of infinite depth. The free surface of this wave solution is an inverted (upside-down) trochoid ‚Äì with sharper crests and flat troughs. This wave solution was discovered by Gerstner in 1802, and rediscovered independently by Rankine in 1863. The flow field associated with the trochoidal wave is not irrotational: it has vorticity. The vorticity is of such a specific strength and vertical distribution that the trajectories of the fluid parcels are closed circles. This is in contrast with the usual experimental observation of Stokes drift associated with the wave motion. Also the phase speed is independent of the trochoidal wave's amplitude, unlike other nonlinear wave-theories (like those of the Stokes wave and cnoidal wave) and observations. For these reasons ‚Äì as well as for the fact that solutions for finite fluid depth are lacking ‚Äì trochoidal waves are of limited use for engineering applications. In computer graphics, the rendering of realistic-looking ocean waves can be done by use of so-called Gerstner waves. This is a multi-component and multi-directional extension of the traditional Gerstner wave, often using fast Fourier transforms to make (real-time) animation feasible. Description of classical trochoidal wave Using a Lagrangian specification of the flow field, the motion of fluid parcels is ‚Äì for a periodic wave on the surface of a fluid layer of infinite depth: : begin{align} X(a,b,t) &= a + frac{mathrm{e}^{kb}}{k} sin left( k(a+ct) right),  Y(a,b,t) &= b - frac{mathrm{e}^{kb}}{k} cos left( k(a+ct) right), end{align} where x=X(a,b,t) and y=Y(a,b,t) are the positions of the fluid parcels in the (x,y) plane at time t, with x the horizontal coordinate and y the vertical coordinate (positive upward, in the direction opposing gravity). The Lagrangian coordinates (a,b) label the fluid parcels, with (x,y)=(a,b) the centres of the circular orbits ‚Äì around which the corresponding fluid parcel moves with constant speed c,exp(kb). Further k=2pi/lambda is the wavenumber (and lambda the wavelength), while c is the phase speed with which the wave propagates in the x-direction. The phase speed satisfies the dispersion relation: :c^2=frac{g}{k}, which is independent of the wave nonlinearity (i.e. does not depend on the wave height H), and this phase speed c the same as for Airy's linear waves in deep water. The free surface is a line of constant pressure, and is found to correspond with a line b=b_s, where b_s is a (nonpositive) constant. For b_s=0 the highest waves occur, with a cusp-shaped crest. Note that the highest (irrotational) Stokes wave has a crest angle of 120¬∞, instead of the 0¬∞ for the rotational trochoidal wave. The wave height of the trochoidal wave is H=(2/k)exp(kb_s). The wave is periodic in the x-direction, with wavelength lambda; and also periodic in time with period T=lambda/c=sqrt{2pilambda/g}. The vorticity varpi under the trochoidal wave is: :varpi(a,b,t) = - frac{2,k,c,mathrm{e}^{2kb}}{1-mathrm{e}^{2kb}}, varying with Lagrangian elevation b and diminishing rapidly with depth below the free surface. In computer graphics swell waves using multi-directional and multi-component Gerstner waves for the simulation of the ocean surface and POV-Ray for the 3D rendering. (The animation is periodic in time; it can be set to loop after right-clicking on it while it is playing). A multi-component and multi- directional extension of the Lagrangian description of the free-surface motion ‚Äì as used in Gerstner's trochoidal wave ‚Äì is used in computer graphics for the simulation of ocean waves. For the classical Gerstner wave the fluid motion exactly satisfies the nonlinear, incompressible and inviscid flow equations below the free surface. However, the extended Gerstner waves do in general not satisfy these flow equations exactly (although they satisfy them approximately, i.e. for the linearised Lagrangian description by potential flow). This description of the ocean can be programmed very efficiently by use of the fast Fourier transform (FFT). Moreover, the resulting ocean waves from this process look realistic, as a result of the nonlinear deformation of the free surface (due to the Lagrangian specification of the motion): sharper crests and flatter troughs. The mathematical description of the free-surface in these Gerstner waves can be as follows: the horizontal coordinates are denoted as x and z, and the vertical coordinate is y. The mean level of the free surface is at y=0 and the positive y-direction is upward, opposing the Earth's gravity of strength g. The free surface is described parametrically as a function of the parameters alpha and beta, as well as of time t. The parameters are connected to the mean-surface points (x,y,z)=(alpha,0,beta) around which the fluid parcels at the wavy surface orbit. The free surface is specified through x=xi(alpha,beta,t), y=zeta(alpha,beta,t) and z=eta(alpha,beta,t) with: : begin{align} xi &= alpha - sum_{m=1}^M frac{k_{x,m}}{k_m}, frac{a_m}{tanhleft( k_m, h right)}, sinleft( theta_m right),  eta &= beta - sum_{m=1}^M frac{k_{z,m}}{k_m}, frac{a_m}{tanhleft( k_m, h right)}, sinleft( theta_m right),  zeta &= sum_{m=1}^M a_m, cosleft( theta_m right) quadtext{and}  theta_m &= k_{x,m}, alpha + k_{z,m}, beta - omega_m, t - phi_m, end{align} where tanh is the hyperbolic tangent function, M is the number of wave components considered, a_m is the amplitude of component {m=1dots M} and phi_m its phase. Further {k_m=scriptstylesqrt{(k_{x,m}^2+k_{z,m}^2)}} is its wavenumber and omega_m its angular frequency. The latter two, k_m and omega_m, can not be chosen independently but are related through the dispersion relation: :omega_m^2 = g, k_m, tanh left( k_m, h right), with h the mean water depth. In deep water (htoinfty) the hyperbolic tangent goes to one: {tanh(k_m,h)to 1.} The components k_{x,m} and k_{z,m} of the horizontal wavenumber vector boldsymbol{k}_m determine the wave propagation direction of component m. The choice of the various parameters a_m, k_{x,m}, k_{z,m} and phi_m for {m=1,dots,{M},} and a certain mean depth h determines the form of the ocean surface. A clever choice is needed in order to exploit the possibility of fast computation by means of the FFT. See e.g. for a description how to do this. Most often, the wavenumbers are chosen on a regular grid in (k_x,k_z)-space. Thereafter, the amplitudes a_m and phases phi_m are chosen randomly in accord with the variance-density spectrum of a certain desired sea state. Finally, by FFT, the ocean surface can be constructed in such a way that it is periodic both in space and time, enabling tiling ‚Äì creating periodicity in time by slightly shifting the frequencies omega_m such that omega_m=m,Deltaomega for {m=1,dots,{M}.} In rendering, also the normal vector boldsymbol{n} to the surface is often needed. These can be computed using the cross product (times) as: : boldsymbol{n} = frac{partialboldsymbol{s}}{partialalpha} times frac{partialboldsymbol{s}}{partialbeta} quad text{with} quad boldsymbol{s}(alpha,beta,t) = begin{pmatrix} xi(alpha,beta,t)  zeta(alpha,beta,t)  eta(alpha,beta,t) end{pmatrix}. The unit normal vector then is boldsymbol{e}_n=boldsymbol{n}/boldsymbol{n}, with boldsymbol{n} the norm of boldsymbol{n}. Notes References *.

Biography Everett Pitcher grew up in Cleveland, where his father, Arthur Dunn Pitcher, headed the mathematics department at Adelbert College of Western Reserve University until he died of heart failure in 1924 at the age of 43. Everett Pitcher's mother was a math teacher, and his father received a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Chicago under E. H. Moore. Everett Pitcher received in 1932 an A.B. from Western Reserve University, in 1933 an M.A., and in 1935 a Ph.D. from Harvard University under Marston Morse with the thesis Certain Invariants of Closed Extremals. After two years as a Benjamin Peirce Instructor at Harvard, Pitcher joined the mathematics faculty of Lehigh University in 1938, where he remained except for a leave of absence serving in the U. S. Army during World War II and for some sabbaticals.Pitcher, Arthur E., Institute for Advanced Study At Lehigh he served as chair of the department from 1960 until his retirement in 1978. He was a Guggenheim Fellow for the academic year 1952‚Äì1953. Everett gave an Invited Address to the American Mathematical Society in 1955, published as \\"Inequalities of critical point theory\\". Pitcher was one of the founders of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics and a member of its Board of Trustees from 1961 to 1963. He was an AMS Associate Secretary from 1959 to 1966 and then Secretary of the AMS from 1966 to 1988. Legacy In 1936 Everett married Sarah Mathiott Hindman; the marriage produced two daughters, Susan Pitcher and Joan Pitcher Morrison. After Sarah Everett died in 1972, Everett in 1973 married Theresa Sell, who died in 2001. Everett Pitcher and his second wife Theresa endowed the Everett Pitcher Fund for the Propagation of Mathematics, which enables Lehigh to annually host the annual Pitcher Lecture series given by an eminent mathematician. In honor of Pitcher, Lehigh established the Pitcher Chair in Mathematics and the Pitcher Research Scholars in Mathematics.

Early life and education Heath was born in New York, graduating from The Putney School in 1939 and from Smith College in 1943. Heath first flew in a plane at age four, sharing an interest in flying with her older brother Royal. At Smith, Heath majored in education and child studies, wrote for the newspaper, played on the national women's lacrosse team, and was the president of the Smith College Flying Club. Prior to Heath's presidency, Smith Flying Club members learned about the theory of flying but not its practice. In 1941, Heath persuaded the fifteen other members of the Flying Club to purchase a plane for $100 each. Club members used this plane, which they painted black and christened The Bird of Paradise, to practice flying at LaFleur Airport in Northampton, Massachusetts.Flying Club Papers, Smith College Archives, Northampton, MA. Career Pilot Heath joined the Women Airforce Service Pilots, the first group of American women to fly military aircraft, upon graduating from Smith. As a WASP, Heath flew B-26 bombers used for target practice at Grissom Air Reserve Base in Indiana. She earned the rank of second lieutenant. After World War II ended in 1945, the WASPs were dissolved, and Heath began working in the field of aviation safety. In 1947, Heath became the head of the Engineering for Safety Group in the newly formed Flight Safety Foundation. Heath spent two decades working in flight safety, becoming the assistant director for the Cornell-Guggenheim Safety Center in 1965 and founding her own search and rescue consulting company SAR-ASSIST in 1968. Heath's career took a different turn when she was asked to become the chairman of the International Academy of Astronautics Space Safety Committee in 1972. Heath's contributions that focused more on earthbound disasters and aiding downed spacecraft ultimately led to both the development of the current satellite-based search and rescue system and the United Nations declaration of an International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction. Lacrosse Heath joined the U.S. Women's Lacrosse Team as a goalie in 1941. After her war service ended, Heath made the U.S. Reserve Team in 1949 and 1950 and the U.S. first team in 1954.

Tiebreakers If two or more teams are equal on points on completion of the group matches, the following tie-breaking criteria are applied: # Higher number of points obtained in the matches played between the teams in question; # Superior goal difference resulting from the matches played between the teams in question; # Higher number of goals scored in the matches played between the teams in question; # If, after having applied criteria 1 to 3, teams still have an equal ranking, criteria 1 to 3 are reapplied exclusively to the matches between the teams in question to determine their final rankings. If this procedure does not lead to a decision, criteria 5 to 9 apply; # Superior goal difference in all group matches; # Higher number of goals scored in all group matches; # If only two teams have the same number of points, and they are tied according to criteria 1‚Äì6 after having met in the last round of the group stage, their ranking is determined by a penalty shoot-out (this criteria is not used if more than two teams have the same number of points). # Position in the UEFA national team coefficient ranking system.

Tiarks was born in the town of Jever, then in the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg, and now in Lower Saxony, Germany. He entered the University of G√∂ttingen to study theology but transferred to the mathematics course. Having gained his degree he initially moved to Hamburg, but then moved to England in 1810 to escape Napoleon. There he secured employment as Assistant Librarian to Sir Joseph Banks. In 1817, with the help of Banks, he was appointed British Astronomer to the Boundary Commission created by the Treaty of Ghent in 1814 to resolve the border between the United States and Canada westward from the Great Lakes to the Rockies. Between 1818 and 1821 he carried out a number of specific surveys along the proposed border. He married in 1822 and returned to England. Due to delays in proceeding with the border project, the British Admiralty asked him in the meantime to determine the longitude of various European locations, such as Madeira, with the help of chronometers, for which the SS Comet had been specially outfitted. He was joined from 30 June to 17 August 1824 by Humphry Davy who used the voyage to Norway to test his zinc protectors for ships' bottoms.The Royal Society, MC. 1. 114 In 1825 Tiarks was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society as \\"a person well versed in mathematics and nautical astronomy\\". In 1825 he was sent again to North America to ascertain the co-ordinates of the most north-westerly point of the Lake of the Woods, enduring many privations in that remote wilderness. On completion he returned to England to be sent in 1828 to the Netherlands, where the King of the Netherlands was arbitrating on the border issue. In 1835 his health broke down and he died in 1837 at age 48.

Life and work  Born as Hans-Rudolf Lehmann in Bern, his mother was a farmer's daughter and his father was shoemaker, later auxiliary postman and department manager at the Swiss Post. His mother had a creative streak, which passed to both sons. Hartmann's younger brother J√ºrg became a journalist, and now heads the Ringier Group school of journalism. Lukas Hartmann wrote his first stories at the age of 13. He completed a teacher training course in Bern with majors in German, history and music, and worked first as a teacher. He then decided to pursue further studies in psychology, but he did not graduate, and later worked as social worker, journalist and writer. His novels Anna - annA and Pestalozzis Berg have been filmed. Hartmann's grandmother was one of the so-called Verdingkinder, hence Hartmann is one of the most prominent supporters of the so-called Wiedergutmachungsinitiative.

The entrainment of air packets can be localised or continuous along the air‚Äìwater interface. Examples of localised aeration include air entrainment by plunging water jet and at hydraulic jump. Bubbles are entrained locally at the intersection of the impinging jet with the surrounding waters. The intersecting perimeter is a singularity in terms of both air entrainment and momentum exchange, and the air is entrapped at the discontinuity between the impinging jet flow and the receiving pool of water. Interfacial aeration is defined as the air entrainment process along an air‚Äìwater interface, usually parallel to the flow direction. In hydraulic structures, free-surface aeration is commonly observed: i.e., the white waters.

Social Scientists have found that home, family, and romance are three of the most important components of the way characters are presented. Moreover, these qualities are often presented in a stereotypical and traditional fashion. In the 1950s the meaning of the word parent coincided with the nuclear family structure‚Äîhusband, wife, and children. Parents had a responsibility to uphold traditional gender roles in society. Gender roles in society were as follows: fathers work outside of the home and bring in the bread (take on the role of providers), while mothers tend to housework, make sure they are emotionally available, and look after the children (take on the role of caretakers). In today's time, the definition and responsibility of a parent has become more flexible/adjustable since the 1950s, although some parents tend to stick to their traditional gender roles. For example, two-married-parent families were the most common type of family unit a generation ago; however, in the year 2000 that particular family structure could only be found in one out of four households. Because of the shift in parenting, media outlets took it upon themselves to provide representation for certain family structures outside of the nuclear family, leaving them flexible as well. Mass media has presented a multitude of family structures and has promoted the acceptance of alternate family structures in many ways including television, newspapers, movies, commercials, books, comics, etc. Media is linked to the structure of families, given that parents and their children confide in it when questioning their own family and parenting practices. Its influence impacts parents positively and negatively, either by underrepresentation (dumb, irresponsible) or drawing the perfect picture (good mothers and fathers).  Major theories  Family and gender in general There have been a number of approaches to ultimately study the media's portrayal of the family. One theoretical approach surrounds the cultivation perspective which states that cultivation of a worldview skewed toward that of televised portrayals among heavy viewers. According to a 1976 study done by Gerber and Gross, this type of worldview becomes the social reality of television heavy viewers. Social learning theory has also been used as a theoretical framework for study the effects that the media has on the individual. Evidence also suggests that depictions can have serious consequences. Television, according to a study done by Signorielli in 1990, entrenches the cognitive schema in children that women are happy when they are doing traditional gender roles like staying home to raise children and that men are more ambitious than women are.  Portrayals of fathers  Early television fathers were depicted as bumbling fathers in working-class families, for example, Homer Simpson (The Simpsons) or authoritative figures in suburban families, for example, Ward Cleaver (Leave It to Beaver). Over time, changing economic and political situations contributed to changes in family life. As women began to work outside the home and domestic gender roles were adjusted, the idea of the nuclear family changed. Fathers adapted to be more nurturing to their children and more participative in family and domestic roles. Fogel, a television media expert, refers to this as the \\"new father;\\" he is a mix of traditional masculinity and traits typically associated with mothers.Fogel, J. M. (2012). A modern family: The performance of \\"family\\" and familialism in contemporary television series (Order No. 3519570). Available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Full Text: Literature & Language; ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Full Text: Social Sciences; ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Full Text: The Arts; ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global: Literature & Language; Pro(TRUNCATED). (1027039098). Instead of simply being the breadwinner, the typical idea of the father has shifted to include traits associated with being a ‚Äúgood‚Äù father. This relies on both being supportive to his wife and to his children. The transition can be seen in the multi-generational family shown in Modern Family'. Jay Pritchett, the father on the show with two adult children, says \\"90% of being a dad is just showing up.\\" He represents the traditional idea of less involved parenting by the father. In comparison, Phil Dunphy, who has three adolescent children, describes his parenting style as \\"peerenting,\\" meaning he seeks to be both a peer and parent to his children. His more hands-on approach marks the transition from the father who just need to show up to the \\"new\\" father who is actively involved in his children's lives. =Stay-at-home fathers= The traditional role of \\"father\\" in the household is evolving; fathers are now expected to embrace more hands-on duties with their children. The roles are shifting so much that there has been an increase in \\"stay at home fathers\\", compared to previous generations. Also, increases of positively portrayed stay at home fathers in the media have been indicated. Stay at home fathers have made appearances in television shows and documentaries. An increase in media presence can contribute to the understanding and support for men who choose to care for their children. This evolution of \\"fatherhood\\" shows the dynamic nature of parental roles. A few overarching themes in fatherhood were found in a study interviewing 32 men across the United States. These themes consist of fathers feeling emotional closeness with their children, positive reaction from others about being a stay at home fathers, and importance and pride in family work. The typical reasons behind becoming a stay at home father: wives high salaries, job ‚Äúissues‚Äù, and wives being relocated for their jobs. = \\"Disneyland dads\\" = The term \\"Disneyland dads\\" refers to fathers who are considered to be the nonresidential parent. However, any father can express this type of characteristic. \\"Disneyland dads\\" have the tendency to undertake recreational activities over real parental responsibilities that can include participating in their child's day-to-day activities. In other words, they represent the fun parent while leaving the \\"residential parent\\" to deal with child rearing. These dads can be permissive and fail to discipline their children properly. Richard Gilmore, a father and grandfather in Gilmore Girls, is a splitting image of this. Richard is rich and tends to buy his daughter's and granddaughter's love and approval with his money, while his wife, Emily Gilmore takes on the role of the disciplinarian. Mothers can be classified as Disneyland parents also. According to Stewart, information on Disneyland moms is harder to come by given the fact that mothers are more likely to display nurturing behaviors when they are primary caregivers, leaving secondary primary caregiving to the fathers who fall back on more leisure activities.  Portrayals of mothers  = New momism = Susan Douglas and Meredith Michaels refer to \\"new momism\\" as shaping current Western motherhood.Podnieks, E. (2012). Mediating Moms: Mothers in Popular Culture. Montr√©al, QC: McGill- Queen's University Press. New momism introduces the myth of the perfect mother who assumes all the roles needed of her within the household, does so flawlessly, and emerges from the experience fulfilled and complete. Douglas and Michaels suggest that the media only superficially celebrates mothers by presenting standards, values, and practices that in reality place expectations on mothers that are impossible to reach. New momism is reinforced in the media through portrayals of perfect and unrealistic mothers, and through ‚Äúnews reports emphasizing the unspeakable tragedies that await children of mothers who dare deviate from the One True Path of Momism‚Äù according to Judith Stadtman Tucker. New momism also creates the false dichotomy of the ‚Äúgood‚Äù versus ‚Äúbad‚Äù mother, and the media supplements viewers with the attitudes and practices that characterize both labels: the good mother is always in control, able to fulfill all responsibilities toward children and husband, while the bad mother is overwhelmed, disorganized, and lost among the chaos. = Mommy wars = ‚ÄúMommy wars,\\" as introduced by Nina Darnton in a June 1990 Newsweek article, represents the media-staged tensions between stay-at-home mothers and working mothers. Stay-at-home mothers criticize working mothers for abandoning their children and homes to build a personal career, while working mothers resent stay-at-home mothers both because of the time and attention they are able to devote to their children, and because of the notion that a mother is only \\"good enough\\" if she can devote all her time and attention to the children and household. Susan Podnieks argues that the \\"mommy myth\\", as well as the supposed battle between working and stay-at-home mothers, are circulated by news media and talk shows, sparking debates about the proper sphere of women. As a result, the general public believes that \\"there is a bitter war in the suburban cul-de-sacs of the United States between the complacent minivan-driving stay-at-home moms and the overachieving soon-to-be- burnout working mothers who still think they can have it all.\\" This leads to grouping mothers into rigid and rival categories, leading them to feel insecure about their mothering, and in turn leading them to devalue other mothers in order to elevate themselves. = Media mother police = The media mother police refers to the media's surveillance and policing of mothers (specifically famous mothers) by dissecting and evaluating their parenting practices. Susan Douglas and Meredith Michaels use the term to describe child care experts who engage in the practice of watching over famous mothers and judge their efforts. Elizabeth Podnieks uses it to refer to reporters, the paparazzi, and all those involved within entertainment journalism who participate in maternal surveillance. The media mother police simultaneously reinforces The Mommy Myth by showcasing examples of perfect and airbrushed celebrity mothers, and also heightens the stigma of the \\"bad\\" mother by exposing the failures and debaucheries of certain celebrating mothers. =Portrayals of single mothers= The depiction of single mothers in the media is crucial because it impacts children's views on parenthood. This topic became especially relevant after the 1990s. Between 1986 and 1989 there was a 19% increase in pregnancy for 15- to 17-year-olds, consequently the number of single mothers increased. In a study conducted by sociologist Mary Larson, participants were asked to view several soap operas and comment on the role of the single mother. The study consisted of 163 junior and senior high-school students in a rural-suburban community in Northern Illinois in 1993. The student body was 9% minority and had an average family income of $41,000. The students in the study declared that most soap operas depict the single mother as white upper middle class with a successful job. Participants also noted that coping with a job and having a child did not seem to be a problem for the mothers. Their children were allowed to attend social events and each woman had a dominant male figure who helped with the baby on a daily basis. After viewing the shows, participants were asked to answer several questions on single mothers. Most responses indicate a skewed perception of being a single mother. Most students did not believe single mothers were more likely to live in poverty and that most babies had a dominant male presence in their lives. Other scientists have determined that men are actually more commonly portrayed as single parents in prime time television. One study[which?] revealed that men outnumber women by three to one as being single parents. Additionally, women are more frequently portrayed as married in a home setting. Whereas single men never endure the conflict of balancing their work and family life, women are depicted as struggling to balance both. Portrayal of African American families Given the changing traditional structure of the American family, it would be suspected different family dynamics are depicted by different characters and themes. For example, one would expect television to encapsulate the different themes and qualities of the African American family that are a result of prejudice and discrimination. However, studies have shown that the television characteristics of people of color do not reveal the unique experiences of being African, Latino, Native American or Asian American, but rather represent the perceptions of the White producers. From the period of 1969‚Äì1982 African American families were almost never portrayed as husband, wife and children living together under one roof. Moreover, most families were highlighted as being \\"poor and struggling\\". These representations make it appear as though African Americans cannot care for their families accurately. As pressure increased on the industry to produce a more accurate portrayal of the nuclear African American family, shows such as The Cosby Show, 227, and Charlie & Co became popular. The emergence of these shows created a TV culture that more accurately depicted an intact African American family. Unfortunately, data reveals that the same cannot be said for other minority families such as Latino Americans.  Portrayal of Latino American Families  In 1984, the media portrayed Latinos as illegal aliens that were on the run. This wasn't an accurate representation of who they really were and the lifestyles they lived in reality (doctors, lawyers, husbands, wives, etc.). The study Latinwood and TV 2000 restated that Latino Americans were not accurately presented in the media. They were highly underrepresented and superficially/negatively illustrated on screen, usually characterized as nannies, gardeners, and servants. Just as there was an uproar about media not accurately representing African Americans families properly, there was a similar issue for Latino Americans. With this issue, came the emergence of successful Latino-themed shows such as Dora the Explorer, George Lopez, Ugly Betty, and Wizards of Waverly Place. As media outlets started to present more authentic Latino representation, it gave way for these shows to make an appearance: Jane the Virgin, Queen of the South, One Day at a Time, and On My Block which is a show that represents both Latino and African American families and their culture.  Portrayal of Interracial Families  Interracial relationships are likely to be invisible in the media, or they are portrayed as problematic/ unnatural. For example, Black/White relationships are depicted as dangerous. It wasn't until an episode of Star Trek, that the first Black/White kiss was televised. Soon after, an interracial couple on The Jeffersons appeared on television. In the show, Tom (White) and Helen (Black) were often taunted by their Black neighbor, George, for being two different races. Helen and Tom had a biracial daughter who George would refer to as \\"zebra\\", which was a derogatory word. George wasn't a fan of people dating outside of their race. If shows highlighting interracial couples did premiere, they were canceled after a few seasons. The Jeffersons was canceled after a decade, True Colors was canceled after two seasons and Kevin Hill was canceled after one season. Happy Endings and Parenthood are recent shows portraying interracial couples. Although they are recent, the shows aren't portraying interracial couples properly. Interracial couples in the media are more of an elephant in the room rather than experiencing something new.  Major empirical findings   Television  Over time, television series have reflected the changing norms of real families. Viewers have regarded these television families as models of familial behavior despite the unrealistic nature of many television series. Media expert Jennifer Fogel notes that families on television have evolved to focus more on strong marital partnerships, but many shows still focus on a traditional, patriarchal family. She suggests a number of different types of families that have been seen on television in the 21st century: parents adjusting to parenthood (e.g., Yes, Dear), dysfunctional yet loyal families (e.g., Arrested Development), and blended families (e.g., The New Adventures of Old Christine). For white families, television series have included single parenthood, divorced families, and multi-generational households. In comparison, minority families on television usually conform to nuclear family roles (e.g., George Lopez, Black-ish). In an analysis of television shows, Dr. William Douglas found modern parent-child relationships to be judged as mutually respectful.Douglas, W., & NetLibrary, Inc. (2003). Television families is something wrong in suburbia? (LEA's communication series ^A1029732). Mahwah, N.J.: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. Though both mothers and fathers regularly provide support for their children, mothers were particularly likely to behave in a supportive or nurturing manner. In dealing with conflict, television fathers are more likely to use strategies which include blaming, rejection, aggressive questioning, and joking. They are more focused on winning an argument than protecting the relationship. Television mothers are more likely to use strategies that include emphasizing commonalities and using empathy in dealing with conflict such that relational goals are promoted over winning the argument. In modern television families, both mothers and fathers are more likely to work outside the home. Douglas suggests that the modern television family is reflective of the modern family in their problems. He asserts families are now unable to construct a nurturing family environment, including establishment of lasting relationships and effective socialization of children, in both families on television and in reality. Scharrer (2001a) conducted a quantitative study investigating masculine roles within the home, and looked at 136 episodes of 29 domestic sitcoms airing from the 1950s to the 1990s. Scharrer found an increasing tendency to portray fathers as foolish and less adept at child care than mothers. The study revealed that fathers were the butt of 60% of all jokes involving the father in the 1990s sitcoms compared to 30% in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s.Scharrer, E. L. (2012). Representations of Gender in the Media. In Dill, K. E. The Oxford Handbook of Media Psychology (pp. 267‚Äì283). New York, NY: Oxford University Press. Movies Films that take place in the 1950s often portray an ‚Äúideal family‚Äù consisting of a breadwinner husband, a homemaker wife, and their children. To an extent, this is a reflection of the times: upon the conclusion of World War II, there was an increased importance put on the home. Women were not expected to complete secondary education and instead were pushed towards finding a husband. The film Mona Lisa Smile depicts a female professor's struggle with these expectations that have been put both on herself and her students. Many of the professor's students drop out over the course of the film to become housewives and she ultimately fails at her mission of keeping her female students in school. This \\"ideal family\\" model of the 1950s is outdated and unrealistic in today's world, however the myth lives on. Continued media portrayal of this shapes public opinion and influences our beliefs.Sutherland, J., & Feltey, K. (2010). Cinematic sociology: Social life in film. Thousand Oaks: Pine Forge Press. Over the past 20 years, more and more women have been abandoning the homemaker role in favor of a position in the workforce. There has been a distinct shift from the male-breadwinner model to more dual-earner and single-parent households, and that is not always reflected in film. The movie I Don't Know How She Does It shows a working mother trying to balance a demanding job as well as familial duties. The film Daddy Day Care is about a father that takes on the role of homemaker. However, these two films are far from the norm in terms of familial structure as seen in today's movies. The industry has yet to catch up to the current family climate completely, but films with non-conventional families are becoming more and more common. Television commercials Gayle Kaufman, a professor from Davidson College, explored the expanding social roles of men and women found on television in her article, \\"The Portrayal of Men's Family Roles in Television Commercials.\\" Through the use of empirical observations, Kaufman's research specifically focuses on the differences in the roles of mother and fathers portrayed by the media in national television commercials. Even though the roles of both men and women have expanded from the past, majority of the commercials were found to display traditional gender ideology. Gender differences found in commercials are prevalent. Women were found to take on stereotypical roles in many types of commercials. With regards to housework, women were found to be significantly more likely to be shown doing housework than men: cooking, cleaning, washing dishes, and shopping. Now, analyzing the data more closely, the reader can find that 79‚Äì80% of all cleaning and shopping in commercials are performed by women. Women were also found to be more responsible for washing dishes at 93% compared to men. Kaufman believes that this finding is based on the socialization process. Information not shown by the table includes the detailed explanation of the actions of the individuals in the study. With cooking commercials, many times the men and children were shown to be passively waiting to be served by their spouse. In cases where no mother is present, the same stereotypical roles are shown to be passed to the daughter as the father and/or brothers are passively waiting. Also, many of the domestic activities done by males are usually very manly, according to Kaufman, like taking out the trash. However, she says that men seemed incompetent about it. There were also striking differences in other activities as well. When it came to interacting and spending time with children in commercials, men were found to be more likely than women to be with only boys. However, women were three times more likely to be seen with both boys and girls. Women were more likely to not only be with more children in commercials, they were more likely to take care of them as well. Compared to men's 17.7%, women were 35.0% likely to be involved in some type of childcare activity (giving medicine, putting on bandages, etc.) in commercials. This finding was significant. Like mentioned earlier, men, were more likely to care for care for male children more than female children. However, men did surpass women in three activities with children. Contrary to popular belief, men were found to actually teach kids lessons or read to them more than women. The data showed a significant 41% for men and only 14% for women. Men were also found to be eating with children more than women in commercials. Children's books David Anderson and Mykol Hamilton's research focused on the portrayal of fathers and mothers in children's books and speculated on the implications of it in their 2005 article ‚ÄúGender Role Stereotyping of Parents in Children‚Äôs Picture Books: The Invisible Father‚Äù. They empirically analyzed two hundred children's picture books. Out of the 139 books with parents in them. 64% of the books had mothers in them and 47.5% had fathers in them. There were sixty four books that had scenes in them with only mothers but no father scenes. Also, 19% of the books had father only scenes and no mother scenes. In general fathers were not only highly underrepresented in the children's books, but they were also not even mentioned as much as mothers. The research also focused on the activities and emotions performed by parents in the books. They found that mothers were close to 10 times more likely to care for babies than fathers were. Mothers in the books performed every measure of nursing behavior studied by the researchers two times more than fathers. Emotionally, mothers expressed varying emotions at a greater rate than the fathers. This is contrary to the opinion of the researchers who believed that fathers would express greater amounts of overall anger than did mothers. This is not the case. The findings were significant that mothers were more likely than men to express happiness, cry, or basically have any type of emotion what so ever. Mothers were also found to actually discipline more than fathers in children's books. The researchers use this to make a number of speculations. The authors use these findings to question the socialization process of our younger children and point out, what they think, is a glaring problem. Fathers from the data took a back seat in the lives of the children throughout these children's books. Anderson and Hamilton fear that these stereotypical portrayals socialize children during critical periods of early development in their lives. When these cognitive schema are formed it is hard to change them as time goes on. Children, according to the researchers, will expect caregiving from the mothers and less from the fathers who seem almost invisible.  Magazines  A content analysis of women's magazines by both Keller (1994) and Douglas and Michaels (2004) revealed that the articles and ads within those magazines still reinforced traditional roles of motherhood, such as caring only for children and household tasks. Women's magazines also encourage narrow understandings of motherhood through their misrepresentation of working mothers. Smith (2001) found that articles about working mothers and daycare between 1987 and 1997 usually portrayed working mothers in a negative light, discrediting women's belonging to the public sphere (the workplace) and reaffirming their role within the private sphere (the home). A study conducted by Johnston and Swanson (2003) that analyzed 1998 and 1999 issues of women's and parenting magazines found that employed mothers were largely underrepresented compared to at-home mothers: working mothers were present in 12% of all mother-related text units as opposed to 88% for at-home mothers. Media A study based in Hong Kong set out to examine ‚Äútween\\" girls in order to determine the media's influence on their perception of gender and identity roles. These girls, ages 8‚Äì12, were asked to take images from the media to illustrate what they thought girls and women should or should not do. The sources of media used by the girls in the study included images from: newspapers, magazines, photos of advertisements (in subways, elevators, etc.), television, and Internet. The main goal of this was to find how the media influences the perception of women in the eyes of a \\"tween\\" girl. Previous studies have shown that although children might not perform behaviors the media characterizes as ‚Äúnormal‚Äù right away, they store these perceptions and recall them during ‚Äúreal life situations‚Äù. The interviewers asked the tweens two questions and the interviewee's were asked to reference a digital image they were asked to have captured. The girls were first asked how women/girls should or should not be. The responses were ultimately categorized under five major themes of how women and girls should act: # personality # skills and vocation # appearance # healthy and natural # manners and relationships The most popular responses in regards to personality were: be yourself, be brave, and be gentle. Skills and vocation responses reflected what jobs and skills a woman should have. Housekeeping was regarded as a good skill to have because boys have poor housekeeping skills. Appearance responses included what girls should look like, and how they should not (for example, girls should be presentable not sloppy). Under the category of healthy and natural interviewee's were speaking of exercise, strength, and drug free lifestyles. Among the comments made by interviewee's about manners and relationships were those about self-control, being conservative in sexual relationships, and self-representation in the public sphere. The second thing the girls were asked was what women should or should not do. The responses were categorized into themes, stated in order of most responses in a given category to least responses in a given  1) appearance, 2) health and safety, 3) relationships, 4) caring for people and environment, 5) work and others. The conclusions made from this study were as follows. Tweens' perceptions of gender and identity roles mostly come from their role models. Tweens have conservative attitudes toward sexuality, despite racy advertisements. Tweens heavily favor natural beauty and reject practices that aim to reduce weight drastically. Tweens rejected and labeled sexy appearance and pre-marital sex as inappropriate. This study showed the perceptions tween girls had as a result of the media, giving proper insight into how young girls envision adults, including mothers in the media.  Controversies  Recent films and television shows that challenge the traditional family ideal have been critically acclaimed and celebrated. A non-traditional family structure is becoming more and more common in media. However, some of the most popular examples have been the topic of debate. The 2010 film The Kids Are All Right depicts a same-sex couple, Jules and Nic, and their trials in raising two children. The film was very well-received, garnering four Oscar nominations. Critics applauded the movie for its depiction of a \\"realistic\\" lesbian couple, with Roger Ebert saying: \\"The Kids Are All Right centers on a lesbian marriage, but is not about one. It's a film about marriage itself, an institution with challenges that are universal.‚Äù However, the family structure in the film is a traditional one: Nic is the breadwinner and Jules is the homemaker. This dynamic is a source of tension throughout the movie and is a major obstacle in their relationship. The film is regarded as progressive while at the same time criticized for the archaic model of family. Television has a similar example in Modern Family. Premiering in 2009 and chronicling three families portraying varying degrees social norms, Modern Family has received awards including 21 Emmys. It has also been the subject of criticism in term of familial portrayal. Phil Dunphy, a father on the show, is portrayed as foolish and easily outmaneuvered by both his wife and children. Claire, his wife, is an uptight stay-at-home mother who has become bored in her role in the family. Many critics have pointed out that both mothers on the show are not employed. In season 5 of the show Claire did return to work after her children had matured. Although on the surface, Modern Family looks like a fresh perspective on today's family environment, it has its shortcomings. The traditional model of family can be seen in the Dunphy household despite the show's promise of a modern family.  Conclusion  Society usually look to views of family planning on the social media and other raw media forms to develop a vauge notion, idea or plan of how a perfect family should be and act like. Over time, portrayals of both mothers and fathers in the media have adjusted to reflect changing familial norms. Both television and movies have reflected changes from the traditional family, though the nuclear family is still very present. Advertisements, children's books, and magazines still consistently represent traditional gender norms. Controversies have emerged in parental portrayals that seem to challenge traditional roles but, in reality, reinforce them.

History  South Eighth Street was built in September 1868 and opened on November 4, 1868. As the city of Brooklyn would not allow steam trains west of Bushwick, horses pulled the cars individually through the streets to South Eighth Street. In July 1869 the station must have been adequate for two or three trains, for, in a letter of complaint, we read: \\"...the intersection of South Eighth Street and Kent Avenue is impassable...by reason of the frogs and switches and the crossing rails of the South Side RR. The company has abolished the sidewalk and occupy the space with trucks and wagons unloading directly into their depot.\\" In April 1872, the depot was enlarged by an extension of the roadbed on heavy framework resting on piles to the bulkhead line of the river, nearly 100 feet in length, and giving standing for several additional cars. In a description of the waterfront in 1872 it is read: \\"The South Side Railroad depot is deserving of mention; it was originally a depot building two stories high, in which are sitting rooms, freight and ticket offices on the first floor for the accommodation of passengers, while on that above are the several offices of the corporation. Early in summer a covered depot to shelter the cars was erected and has just been completed. This rests upon piles and partly extends over the ferry piers.\\" South Eighth Street was abandoned on February 29, 1876, with the last train leaving on February 26. All rails were removed during May 1876. Part of the old depot buildings were still standing in 1922.

Many of its buildings are registered on Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship Heritage List. Across the street, between Warmia and Marcinkowskiego street runs the 18¬∞E longitude Meridian, so-called Bydgoszcz Meridian. Location The street is located in the western part of Downtown Bydgoszcz. It runs from the intersection with Gdanska Street to the intersection with Sigismund Augustus Street, where is the main train station, Bydgoszcz G≈Ç√≥wna. Hence its name: \\"Train station\\" in polish is \\"Dworzec\\", \\"Dworcowa Street\\" thus means \\"Train Station Street\\". History \\"Bahnhoffstra√üe No.41\\" in 1914 Until 1851, the path was a dirty road leading from Bydgoszcz to Koronowo. The development of the street is associated with the building of Bydgoszcz Main Railway Station in 1851, which led to assimilating the close settlement of Bocianowo () into the city precinct. On an 1861 map of the area, the vicinity of the railway station shows dispersed housings: it is only in the early 20th century that compact constructions make their appearance along the street. Some specific quarters near Gdanska street and close to the Main station have shown earlier activity, with the development of hotel buildings: * Hotel \\"Pod Orlem\\" (1893), Hotel Pawlikowski (1898) in Gdanska Street; * Hotel du Nord (1875), Heises's Hotel (1884), Schliep's Hotel (1889) near the Main Station. At the end of the 19th century, Dworcowa street had an industrial and commercial character. In its surroundings flourished trade houses, craft workshops and restaurants or bars. The industrial buildings and warehouses occupied the area between the street and the Brda river, while along the street were located flats and shops. The largest companies at then Bahnhoffstra√üe were: Eastern tip of Dworcowa Street * Fabryka Sygna≈Ç√≥w Kolejowych (Railway Signals Factory); * J.G. Neumann's Brick factory (); * Printhouse Ortis (established by Hermann and Emil Dittmann) They published the \\"Deutsche Rundschau\\", and after World War II all the local newspapers. Between 1890 and 1914, many houses along the street have been transformed into 3 to 4 storey buildings, displaying ornated facades (e.g. building at No.55, decorated with a head of Hermes), turning the venue into one of the most representative in the city. In the final section of the street near the Main Railway Station, there used to stand five hotels, furnished as tenements. Street trams have been operated since 1888, first horse powered, then electrical ones in 1896. The line (Red) ran along the entire length of the street from the station to Gda≈Ñska Street. In 1990, tram traffic has been suspended for technical reasons. Since then a partial restoration of the line has been performed after the revitalization of the street. Through history, this street had the following names: * 1852-1920 - Bahnhoffstra√üe (Main Station street in German); * 1920-1939 - Ulica Dworcowa; * 1939-1945 - Albert-Forsterstrasse (named after nazi leaderAlbert Forster); * From 1945 - Ulica Dworcowa . Characteristics At the intersection with Henryk Sienkiewicz street Dworcowa Street is 1242 m long and is almost entirely built with stylish houses. It is considered as one of the most important axis, historically and functionally in downtown Bydgoszcz. Its architectural landscape is quite diverse, with houses of different scale and style coexisting together. For the most part, street facades display architectural features fashionable in the years 1860-1914: * Eclecticism; * Neo-Renaissance; * Neo-Baroque; * Secession; * Modern architecture. Oldest buildings have been built in Neoclassical style, usually with simple, symmetrical facades and modest decorations. During the last quarter of the 19th century, elements of Neo-Renaissance, Neo-Gothic and Neo-Baroque start to appear on houses. Most impressive buildings have been erected between 1900 and 1915: it was the emergence of breaking architectural styles, such as Historicism, Secession and early Modern architecture. The Prussian Eastern Railway Headquarters has been erected in the late 1880s, and was at the time the most magnificent public property in the entire city. Dworcowa street has been the playground of many local and Berlin's architects. However, past major bydgoszcz designers, Joseph ≈öwiƒôcicki and Fritz Weidner who built 29 edifices in Gdanska Street, only designed four buildings in Dworcowa. Most noticeable tenements are located on the southern side of the street: 3 buildings are registered on the Heritage List since 2010.http://www.kobidz.pl/app/site.php5/article/1469/3159.html Rejestr zabytk√≥w wojew√≥dztwa kujawsko-pomorskiego na stronie http://www.kobidz.pl/app/site.php5/Show/1.html KOBiDZ View in the vicinity of the train station Most prominent buildings include: * Former Prussian Eastern Railway Headquarters; * State Archives Building at No.65; * Tax House at Warminskiego No.18; * HotelsBrƒôczewska-Kulesza Daria: Rozw√≥j budownictwa hotelowego w Bydgoszczy w 2. po≈Çowie XIX i na poczƒÖtku XX wieku, [w:] Materia≈Çy do dziej√≥w kultury i sztuki Bydgoszczy i regionu.

Revitalisation Dworcowa Street being one of the most important streets in downtown Bydgoszcz, it has been identified to be the target of a vast revitalisation plan. In 2009, in the Local Plan for the Revitalization of Bydgoszcz has been included the project Revitalisation of Dworcowa street. Costs amount to 6.4 million PLN, supported by a 4.2 million PLN EU funding under the 2007-2013 Regional Operational Programme for Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship. The project encompassed: * the modernization of Dworcowa street with a pedestrian pavement; * the addition of green areas; * the landscaping on the section between Gdanska Street and Matejki street. In addition, the section leading from Matejki street to Main Railway Station has seen the restoration of tram circulation and the refurbishment of a historic building by Fritz Weidner in the immediate vicinity, converted to a Municipal Cultural Center. Means of transportation Since 2012, tram lines No.5 and No.8 run on the section from Matejki street to Sigismund Augustus street, using a special bridge built for the occasion. In addition, bus lines (54, 67, 75, 71, 79, 80, 83, 84, 31N, 33N) run on the section between the train station and Kr√≥lowej Jadwigi street.

In 1908, a drugstore run by Dr Aurel Kratz opened there: it was also selling goods for cameras until World War I. Aurel Kratz then moved to Friedrichstra√üe. The building has a triangular footprint plot, a challenge for the designer. It displays a nice bay window on the corner facade. The first floor windows, around the bay-window are more adorned than others with flanking pilasters topped with corbels and a frieze of ornaments. Second floors windows are capped by triangular pediments and have also small corbels and pilasters. Third level openings are only flanked by lean pilasters and pediment topped. A line of designed corbels runs beneath the roof.

In 1907, the new owner was Mr. Conitzer, a businessman member of the very family running at that time the neighbouring department store. The facade has been restored in 2015, giving more sharpness to all the different details. It is almost a classical one, but for the asymmetry: on first level, one notices heavily adorned windows (triangle pediments, pilasters with consoles, the second floor is less decorated and topped by a dense Corbel table. The gate axis is stressed by a monumental balcony and a smaller one above. The entry door transom light is crowned by a delicately carved female figure.

From the 1900s (decade) till World War I, the new owner, Ernst Knitter, was a merchant selling kitchenware and ironmongery. The elevation has been renovated in 2015, underlying the delicacy of the ornamentation: the front pediment, the gate frame with its two facing figures, the pilasters and the corbel table.

He had this tenement designed by Fritz Weidner, which comprised at the time almost 200 rooms. It was also used as a one of its many selling points in the city (others were found at today's Gda≈Ñska Street, Theatre square, Podolska or Pestalozziego streets). He even opened branches in Warsaw or Katowice. In 1912, the building was awarded city most beautiful facade! Most of the architectural details of the facade have unfortunately vanished. Be that as it may, one can make out the asymmetry of the elevation, characteristic of Fritz Weidner. He used bow windows unbalanced positions, balconies at different levels and with different shapes to reach his goals.

Schoenfelder, who rented the rooms. In 1910, the edifice housed the Bromberg music and opera school (), run by Carl Sch√∂ne who lived there. The main elevation still awaits better days, however, one can notice characteristic elements of neoclassic architecture: symmetry, triangular pedimented windows, cartouches with rosettes and corbel table. In particular, one can appreciate the preserved entrance, with a wrought iron grillwork adorned with sunflowers and leaves, as well as the large wood double door topped with a transom light. The building has been entirely renovated at the beginning of 2019.

Zorn, a wood manufacturer and merchant, at Bahnhoffstra√üe 92 was the first owner of the tenement. He kept it till World War I. The style and shape of the facade is clearly echoing the one at No.14. However, it displays clearly Neo-Renaissance characteristics. Motifs are neat, each floor has a specific window adornament, the slight bay window stresses the symmetry of the elevation. One can notice the minute ornamentation of this bay-window (niches, balustrade, volutes) as well as the corbel table at the top. File:Bdg Dworcowa 16 03-2013.jpgFacade on Dworcowa Street Tenement at No.17 1896 Eclecticism, Neo-Renaissance First owner of the building at Bahnhoffstra√üe 6 was Wilhelm Sch√∂nfelder. In 1888, Hermann L√∂hnert moved here as landlord: he was the founder and director of a joint-stock company of a factory producing machines for foundries, established in 1868 in Bydgoszcz. The firm still exists today, under the name Makrum, located at Le≈õna street 11-19. Although lacking maintenance, the facade still boasts architectural details. Pediments on first floor windows, but also bossages are present. The most interesting decoration is the adornament surrounding middle openings on both floors: pilasters and garland ornaments are topped on the upper floor by crown ornaments.

From 1932 to 1939, it has been renamed \\"Gastronomia\\" with led by H. Katorski. It is now a habitation building, where the Honorary Consul of the Federal Republic of Germany in Bydgoszcz moved in 2019 -previously it was located at 49 ≈öniadeckich street. The building renovated in 2019 a nice decoration on the first floor, with pediments topping windows and ornamented cartouche beneath, as well as a row of round openings below the roof.

However, he never lived there. In the late 1850s, the architect Anton Hoffmann rented there with his family. The facade displays typical Neoclassical style: symmetry, bossage wall on the bottom and a corbel table on the top. It has been renovated in 2017.

The house differs from its neighbours by its height (one additional floor), and by its architecture with more ornaments (pilasters, corbels) and its motifs (garlands, frieze).

It was then located at Bahnhoffstra√üe 14: the facade still bears this initial numbering. Many architectural details are still present on the building: above the gate, dividers, symbol of architecture, are set above a small barrel, recalling the profession of the first landlord. Two slight avant-corps balanced each side of the edifice. On the first floor, the middle part is enhanced by flanking pilasters with rosettes topped by a balustrade. Corbel tables crowns the facade, the ensemble is overlooked by a series of gable wall dormer.

Tenement at No.35 1875-1900 Eclecticism First reference of Bahnhoffstra√üe 15 is made around 1870, with Louis Gosdynski, a rentier, as owner. In 1900, building's property moved to Wilhelhm Zweiniger, a furrier. The facade on Dworcowa street shed light on the fact that initially the tenement has been designed as two different houses, No.15 & 15a. There is clearly a divide between the left part bending on Neo- Renaissance style (symmetry, naked walls, flat roof) and the right one inclining on eclecticist diversity (balconies, bossage wall, cartouche decoration, mansard roof).

The building housed on the ground floor three shops, each with a small apartment in the back and the upper floors accommodated two four-room apartments. The corner house is remarkable by the ornamental painting between the windows of the first floor of the elevation on Dworcowa street. The edifice is massive, but the richness of its ornaments and motifs help it having a certain lightness.

In the 1910s, the house was divided into five properties, which landlords were: Mr. Meyer and Mr Giefe, rentiers not living in Bromberg, Hermann Lemke, a baker who had his shop there, Jahnke Jr., an engineer and Wilhelm Tornow, a mechanic. Facades, renovated in 2015, have Neo-Baroque and early Modernism elements.

The architecture of this corner house is typical of the last quarter of the 19th century: a two-storey (plus attic) tenement, with few decoration on the outside, except a frieze running beneath the gable, some shed dormers, and a nicely adorned bay window on the corner.

The main elevation has suffered from successional renovations that obliterated many architectural details. Be that as it may, the general shape of the building reveals its Art Nouveau inclination: curved shapes of the gable, portals and transom emphasize the Secession inspiration of Rudolf Kern.

The operation, under Italian control, began on 1 November 2014 and ended on 1 February 2018 when it was replaced by Operation Themis. It involved voluntary contributions from 15 other European nations (both EU member states and non-members). Current voluntary contributors to Operation Triton are Croatia, Iceland, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Germany, the Netherlands, France, Spain, Portugal, Austria, Switzerland, Romania, Poland, Lithuania and Malta. The operation was undertaken after Italy ended Operation Mare Nostrum, which had become too costly for a single country to fund; it was costing the Italian government ‚Ç¨9 million per month for an operation that lasted 12 months. The Italian government had requested additional funds from the other EU member states but they did not offer the requested support. Assets The operation's assets consist of two surveillance aircraft, three ships and seven teams of staff who gather intelligence and conduct screening/identification processing. Its budget is estimated at ‚Ç¨2.9 million per month. Refugee and migrant deaths in the Mediterranean Sea, 2011-2016. Since the operation began the number of migrants who drowned while crossing the Mediterranean has dramatically increased with the April 2015 Libya migrant shipwrecks resulting in over 1,000 deaths alone. The International Organization for Migration says that deaths at sea have risen nine times after the end of Operation Mare Nostrum. The New York Times reported that early 2015 saw a 1600% increase in the number of migrants drowning while attempting to cross the Mediterranean as compared to the same period in early 2014. In 2015, Croatian warship B≈†-72 Andrija Mohoroviƒçiƒá joined the rescue efforts. Funding On 20 April, following the April 2015 Libya migrant shipwrecks, EU ministers proposed to double the size of Operation Triton but that would still leave the mission with fewer resources than the previous Italian-run rescue option (Operation Mare Nostrum) whose budget was more than 3 times as large, had 4 times the number of aircraft and had a wider mandate to conduct search and rescue operations across the Mediterranean Sea. On 23 April a five-hour emergency summit was held and EU heads of state agreed to triple the budget of Operation Triton to ‚Ç¨120 million for 2015-2016. EU leaders claimed that this would allow for the same operational capabilities as Operation Mare Nostrum had had in 2013-2014. As part of the agreement the United Kingdom agreed to send , two naval patrol boats and three helicopters to join the Operation. Amnesty International immediately criticized the EU response as \\"a face-saving not a life-saving operation\\" and said that \\"failure to extend Triton‚Äôs operational area will fatally undermine today‚Äôs commitment.\\" Events On 14 June 2016, the Dutch frigate rescued 193 migrants, including 40 women and 16 children, who had been at sea for a week. The migrants' plan was to travel from Egypt to Sicily, but panic erupted when the old ship they were on started showing signs of sinking. The Dutch frigate safely escorted them to an Italian harbour.

Life and work The son of a Jewish lawyer, Tietze grew up in Prague in a German speaking environment. In 1893, his family moved to Vienna. From 1900 to 1903, he studied archaeology, history and art history under Alois Riegl, Julius von Schlosser and Franz Wickhoff at the University of Vienna. In 1903, he completed his Ph.D. dissertation, supervised by Wickhoff, on the topic of medieval typological representation. In 1905, he wrote his Habilitationsschrift on Annibale Caracci's frescos at the Palazzo Farnese. In 1905, he married fellow art-history student Erika Conrat. For some time, he was Wickhoff's assistant at Vienna's first art historical institute chaired by Josef Strzygowski. He also became an assistant and secretary at the Commission for Monument Preseveration. In 1909, he was appointed lecturer in art history at the University of Vienna. After World War I he became assistant professor and began editing the art journal, Die bildenden K√ºnste. In 1913, he published his Methode der Kunstgeschichte, which \\"attempted to summarize the basic principles of the evolutionist methodological project developed by Franz Wickhoff and Alois Riegl and articulated explicitly by Max Dvo≈ô√°k.\\" From 1923 to 1925, Tietze helped reorganizing Vienna's traditional art museum system into a more popular and pedagogical one.Ernst H. Buschbeck, \\"Hans Tietze and his reorganization of the Vienna Museums.\\" In Essays in Honor of Hans Tietze. Paris 1958, pp. 373-75. For instance, he combined the print collection of the Hofbibliothek into the Albertina collection and created the Belvedere galleries, consisting of the baroque museum, the 19th-century museum and the 20th-century art museum. He also wrote radio broadcasts on art. Tietze supported modern art,Dieter Bogner, \\"Hans Tietze und die moderne Kunst.\\" Wiener Jahrbuch f√ºr Kunstgeschichte, Vol. 33, No. 1 (December 1980), pp. 13-16. joining the Gesellschaft zur F√∂rderung der modernen Kunst in Wien (Association for the Promotion of Modern Art in Vienna), but also wrote groundbreaking studies on Albrecht D√ºrer and Venetian renaissance art. For instance, in Tintoretto: The Paintings and Drawings (1948) the Venetian painter is portrayed as a Baroque artist and the dominant figure in the transition from the High Renaissance, as a \\"modern artist, clothed in the grab of the Classic Art\\".KIRKUS Review: TINTORETTO: The Paintings and Drawings In 1932 and 1935, Tietze was a visiting lecturer in the USA. After the annexation of Austria by the Nazis in 1938, he and his wife went to London and then to the United States, where he was appointed visiting professor at the Toledo Museum of Art in 1938-39. In 1940, he settled as a private scholar in New York City, where he wrote introductions to some museum catalogs and \\"great art\\" surveys for the general public. Among his students in Vienna were Ernst Gombrich, Otto Kurz and Fritz Grossmann. His son is the turcologist Andreas Tietze. In 1965, the Tietzestra√üe in Vienna was named in honor of Tietze's memory.

He concerned himself with a better understanding of National Socialism and with questions of education in the twentieth century.Nachruf auf Johannes Tautz von Thomas Meyer Childhood and Studies Johannes Tautz and his younger sister grew up with their father, who ran his own business, and their mother, a librarian in Koblenz and attended the Realschule, where a teacher, Gerhard Schnell, introduced him to Anthroposophy. Schnell ran a private study group on Steiner's The Riddles of Philosophy. Through him Tautz was able to hear a first lecture by Hans B√ºchenbacher at the Cusanus-Branch of the Anthroposophical Society. Tautz took up Oriental studies, Religious studies and the History of Philosophy as \\"the National Socialist demon had not taken these over yet.\\" In Hebrew, Ancient Greek and Sanskrit he began to read the ancient spiritual texts in their original form. At a summer conference in Dornach he met Marie Steiner in the audience during a performance of Albert Steffen's play The Death Experience of Manes, experienced G√ºnther Schubert and Erich Schwebsch lecturing and saw the first Mystery Play of Rudolf Steiner. In 1936 he attended a conference in the exhibition hall of Cologne carried by the leading priests of the Christian Community where he heard Friedrich Rittelmeyer and Emil Bock for the first time. He moved from Bonn to the University of Berlin where, thanks to a regular change of rooms, he was able to evade the pursuit of the Party, for he was categorised as \\"politically unreliable\\" and could obtain only a provisional study permit. Here he was able to hear the lectures of Nicolai Hartmann, Romano Guardini and Eduard Spranger. On Easter 1937 he participated in a conference in Dornach where the first part of Goethe's Faust was being performed and where he heard and had a personal conversation with Friedrich Rittelmeyer. In the academic year 1938/1939 he continued his studies in T√ºbingen. At the start of the war, Tautz was called up, only to be dismissed once again on account of the studies he had not yet completed. His was occupied with the later philosophy of Schelling and submitted his dissertation on \\"Schelling's philosophical anthropology.\\" In it he used two citations of Rudolf Steiner, which led to an official policy statement by Alfred Baeumler, director of the Advanced School of the NSDAP to Prof Hauer, both of whom had been central to evaluating the Anthroposophical work in Germany that led to its prohibition. After a considerable time, Baeumler wrote the following: :\\"In these two footnotes it is not a matter of drawing on an author in the manner customary in scientific works but rather of a confession to the \\"reality of Schelling's view on Nature and Spirit\\" in the sense of Rudolf Steiner and a confession to a dark \\"source\\" that can only mean Anthroposophy. The ingenuous attempt of Mr Tautz shows how important it is right at the moment to be wakeful. The Germany universities are not there to support an attempt to block the living development of German idealism by means of a Schelling-Steiner dogmantism.\\"Anthroposophen in der Zeit des Nationalsozialismus (1933 - 1945) Uwe Werner, R. Oldenbourg Verlag, M√ºnchen 1999 P. 302 The war years and the rebuilding of the Waldorf schools Tautz experienced the years of war as a nightmare and decided on a vocation as educator. \\"In living and suffering through the events of the time it became clear to me that Europe would become a question of education after the war which would prepare the foundations for a society based on human dignity,\\" is what he wrote in his autobiographical sketch. So he went on to complete his teacher's certificate in Marburg. After the war had turned into a world war with the entry of the United States, he was conscripted once again, was declared to be \\"not usable for war\\" and assigned clerical duties in the transport division in Cologne. Here he experienced the carpet bombing attacks and resulting conflagrations. In 1943 he was transferred to Lemberg in the Ukraine, where he joined his superior officer, an anthroposophist, in studying Rudolf Steiner's book on self-education How to Attain Knowledge of Higher Worlds. During the retreat he felt secure without any weapon. After the German capitulation, Tautz was imprisoned variously by the Czechs, Americans and Russians but managed to escape in the summer of 1945 back to his family in Bad Boll. He was soon approached by Erich Gabert in Stuttgart to join the Waldorf School that was about to be opened as its German and History teacher. On 1 November 1945 he stood before his first 9th grade at the Free Waldorf School, Uhlandsh√∂he. Shortly thereafter he met his future wife, who had also completed her PhD. Together they raised three sons. Meeting with Walter Johannes Stein Soon Johannes Tautz decided to look up his \\"predecessor\\", the first history teacher at the Waldorf School, Walter Johannes Stein. In the introduction to his biography of Stein, Tautz writes, \\"In August 1951 the first meeting took place in London. Stein, who held close to three hundred lectures per year, had made several days available for our discussions and readily answered my questions.\\" During the period of his meeting Stein in London, he also met with the previous Royal Air Force officer who had commanded that attack on Cologne.Lehrerbewu√ütsein im 20. Jahrhundert, Vlg. am Goetheanum, Dornach 1995 The conversations with Stein provided an orientation and inspiration for all of his further work as a teacher, lecturer and writer; in his lecturing work at national and international conferences and in the \\"Hague Circle\\", a coordinating international group of Waldorf teachers. He likewise received particular guidance from Emil Bock regarding a Christological view of world history and from J√ºrgen von Grone about the destiny of Germany and in particular to the figure of Helmuth von Moltke. After a heart attack in 1974, Tautz had to end his activities as a teacher. From then on he devoted himself to publishing, counselling and work in adult education. Researching National Socialism, Education and Helmuth von Moltke In 1966 Tautz held three lectures about the spiritual background to National Socialism, which later appeared in print under the title Attack of the Enemy - The Occult Inspiration Behind Adolf Hitler and the Nazis in 1976. In it he looks at a number of personalities connected with questionable occult practices with whom leading Nazis had been close during the time of the movement's growth. In 1979 he edited a collection of biographical portraits together with Gisbert Husemann of the circle of founding Waldorf teachers around Rudolf Steiner. Together with a young friend, Thomas Meyer, he visited the daughter of Walter Johannes Stein, Clarissa Johanna Muller, in Ireland where she was living in order to look through her father's literary estate. They found the typscript of Stein's dissertation annotated by Rudolf Steiner, letters and meditations of Steiner for Stein, his mother and for his brother, who fell in a mysterious manner in World War I. Letters and notes of Ludwig Polzer-Hoditz, Eliza von Moltke, Ita Wegman, D.N Dunlop and many other personalities were discovered and formed the basis of Tautz's biography of Stein in 1989 In 1993 he initiated the editing of a collection of documents that up to this time had been privately circulated and were only partially known: Rudolf Steiner's letters and notes to Eliza von Moltke together with the post mortem communications and the letters of Helmuth von Moltke himself. The decision to publish these was to prevent or anticipate a partial publication without an appropriate commentary on the subject that had been announced. A previous instance of this content being used had been in the book The Spear of Destiny by Trevor Ravenscroft which, in the opinion of Tautz had been written \\"without the necessary protection of background knowledge for the deeply-penetrant and difficult to understand material.\\" His last publication Lehrerbewusstsein im 20. Jahrhundert ‚Äì Erlebtes und Erkanntes, (The consciousness of the teacher in the twentieth century - Experiences and insights) appeared in 1995. Besides an autobiographic sketch it outlined a reflection of the entire past of the schools movement from 1919 onwards with short portraits of its leading personalities. Finally it elaborates on the three challenges facing every educator who works in the sense of the new understanding of the human being: Wakeful awareness of the spirit of the time; Responsibility towards one's historical conscience and the deepening of anthroposophical knowledge through meditative practice.

The battle began one month after the start of the Yemeni Civil War. Background Houthi forces backed by troops loyal to Ali Abdullah Saleh, Yemen's influential former president and General People's Congress party head, swept into Taiz on 22 March, capturing the military airport and other key parts of the city. They encountered little resistance, although Houthi gunmen reportedly fired into the air to disperse protests. One demonstrator was killed and five more were injured. Two days later, five demonstrators were killed by the Houthis and 80 were injured during a protest on 24 March against their presence in the city, while in the city of Al Turba, 80 km to the southwest, three protesters were killed and 12 injured while attacking a Houthi position. On 11 April 2015, pro-Houthi soldiers and fighters loyal to President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi both reportedly mobilised around Taiz, with the 35th Armoured Brigade deploying on the city streets and anti-Houthi militiamen taking up positions north of the city, amid Saudi-led coalition airstrikes in the area. The 22nd Republican Guards Brigade was hit by an airstrike, as was the village of Al-Dhahirah in the Mawiyah District, the next day. Chronology 2015 By 15 April 2015, Yemeni military sources reported that five pro-Saleh military brigades defected throughout the country, with one of them battling Houthis in the Taiz Governorate. Airstrikes pounded Republican Guard and Houthi military positions in and around Taiz on 17 April 2015. A government official in Taiz told Xinhua that the airstrikes had caused dozens of injuries and virtually destroyed Taiz's infrastructure, as well as the military bases they struck. Between 17 and 18 April 2015, at least 30 people were killed when Houthi gunmen, supported by the elite Republican Guard, assaulted the headquarters of the 35th Armoured Army Brigade, which had declared its loyalty to Hadi. The dead included 8‚Äì16 pro- Hadi and 14‚Äì19 Houthi fighters, as well as three civilians. Another report put the number of dead at 85. On the morning of 19 April, 10 more Houthi and four pro-Hadi fighters were killed. On 22 April 2015, Houthi forces captured the pro-Hadi brigade's military base in Taiz. An air-strike was conducted against the base shortly after its capture. 10 pro-Hadi soldiers were killed in the battle for the base. Four days later, residents reported that pro-Hadi forces had captured several city districts from the Houthis. Fighting was heaviest around government and security buildings in the city center, with some 20 civilians being killed. The WHO put the death toll at 19 civilians, after the local Al-Thawra hospital was hit. Fighting broke out in Taiz on 16 May, despite a five-day ceasefire agreed to by the Houthis, military factions, and Saudi-led coalition. At least a dozen civilians and a number of fighters on both the pro-Houthi and pro-Hadi sides were killed. On 24 July, airstrikes targeted two residential complexes belonging to engineers and technicians of al-Mukha power plant of Taiz province.Ahmed Al-Haj and Merrit Kennedy \\"Saudi- led airstrikes kill 120; deadliest in Yemen conflict\\", Yahoo News, 25 July 2015\\"120 killed as Saudi Regime commits fresh atrocities in Taiz Yemen\\", Whatsupic, 29 July 2015\\"Yemen: Coalition Strikes on Residence Apparent War Crime\\",Human Rights Watch,27 July 2015 Situation in Ta'izz, mid-July 2015 By 5 August 2015, pro-Hadi forces at Ta'izz had received reinforcements from the south, allowing them to capture 75% of Ta'izz.

He is best known for being held hostage in 2006 by Nigerian kidnappers and founding Television International Enterprises Archive (TIEA). Hostage Prior to being taken hostage, Philip Morris worked on rigs for twenty years all over the world including Africa and the Americas. While working on the rig Bulford Dolphin in 2006 as a crane operator, Morris was taken hostage along with eight others (six British, one American, one Canadian). He was held hostage for four days in the jungle village of Bilabre, Nigeria. The Nigerian government negotiated the hostages release and paid a $200,000 ransom. Instead of returning to his job seven weeks after being released, he sought counseling for posttraumatic stress disorder. Morris was later charged by police with \\"assault and criminal damage\\" after an incident with his former girlfriend at her home. The charges were dropped six months later. He would not return to Nigeria and received a settlement from his employer due to being taken hostage. Television International Enterprises Archive (TIEA) Morris founded the Television International Enterprises Archive, a company that searches for lost television. His biggest recovery has been nine missing Doctor Who episodes found in Nigeria, from the serials The Enemy of the World and The Web of Fear featuring Patrick Troughton. TIEA and Morris were working on Project Genesis, cataloging materials with the Nigerian Television Authority, when the episodes were discovered in a Jos television relay station. The episodes were in good condition considering the environmental conditions and civil unrest, and lost for decades prior to their recovery. Morris's work requires bodyguards due to the danger involved and he tries to work anonymously, but was in a troubled region during the announcement of the recovered Doctor Who episodes, causing security issues. He has also successfully recovered content from The Basil Brush Show and The Sky at Night. In 2018, Morris recovered two lost episodes of The Morecambe & Wise Show from an abandoned theater in Freetown, Sierra Leone.

Gottwald > New York, NY Gottwald's was the final letter published by the magazine and seems to make the most effort to resolve conflicting views in the foregoing letters. Works Gottwald's most influential work is The Tribes of Yahweh: A Sociology of the Religion of Liberated Israel, 1250-1050 B.C.E. (1979). In it, he employed a sociological approach to the study of early Israelite religion and politics. He proposed Israelites emerged as local Canaanite peasants sought to overthrow the corrupt regimes they lived in. Their action was fueled by a liberating faith in the deity Yahweh. p.53‚Äì54. They dislocated to the previously unsettled Judean hills in order to form a more equal community. These ideals are reflected in the legendary stories of the Pentateuch, Joshua and Judges.

In August 1927, Redfern became the first person to fly solo across the Caribbean Sea and the first to fly nonstop from North to South America. He has never been found or heard from since he was observed flying inland over Venezuela. Redfern's flight was twelve weeks after Lindbergh made his historic flight from New York to Paris. In 1929, Lindbergh came close to skimming the sands of the Sea Island, Georgia beach Redfern took off from and dropped carnations in his fellow flyer's honor. If Redfern had reached his final destination, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil, his flight would have outdistanced Lindbergh. Redfern had an alternative landing site planned if his fuel ran too low, but it is unknown whether he pursued that alternative or decided to continue on to Rio where thousands awaited his arrival, including the President of Brazil and movie star Clara Bow. Biography Paul Rinaldo Redfern was born in 1902 to Blanche Myrtle Redfern and Dr. Frederick Coachefer Redfern in Rochester, NY. His uncles were Richard S. Redfern and Edwin C. Redfern. As a teenager, Paul lived in Columbia, S.C. where his father was a Dean at Benedict College and an advocate for black rights who advised Roosevelt on poverty in the South. His mother taught English at Benedict and represented South Carolina as a delegate at national political conventions. Paul was a mechanical and musical prodigy. He was planning to go to MIT, but after building several planes, he was asked by the U.S. government at age 16 to go to N.J. to be a production inspector for the Army Air Corps at the Standard Aircraft Company. Upon returning to South Carolina, he became a barnstormer at air shows and started the first airport in Columbia, S.C. He married Gertrude Hildebrand in Toledo, Ohio in 1925. Flight and disappearance Redfern went missing in 1927 when he attempted to fly from Brunswick, Georgia to Brazil in a Stinson SM-1 Detroiter NX-773 nicknamed the Port of Brunswick. He was spotted by the Norwegian freighter Christian Krogh a few hundred miles off the coast of South America, after dropping a message asking for the ship to be turned in the direction of the nearest land, and when nearing Venezuela he was spotted by a fisherman just off the coast and then later by others in towns and outposts in Venezuela. He failed to arrive in Rio de Janeiro, and over the years more than a dozen search parties were organized. Missionaries and people visiting tribes living in the jungle reported on a white man living among the Indians, but he was never found and no credible evidence documenting that he somehow survived the flight exists. In September 1927, George Henry Hamilton Tate, sponsored by the American Museum of Natural History, went to look for Redfern. Some believed him to still be alive as late as 1932. In 1936, Art Williams claimed he found traces of the Redfern crash in British Guyana. In 1937, the 13th expedition was organized to find out his fate. Now missing for ten years, he could be legally declared dead. In February 1938, Frederick John Fox died while trying to find Redfern. In April 1938 Theodore J. Waldeck believed he found the wreckage of Redfern's plane. His father died in 1941, still hoping that his son would be found alive. His widow, Gertrude Hillabrand, died in 1981 and was buried in Detroit, Michigan. In 1988 Robert Carlin believed that Redfern had flown over Ciudad Bolivar, Venezuela only to be killed in a crash in the jungle and that a report that aviator Jimmy Angel had seen wreckage of Redfern's plane was not bragging but correct.Flying Magazine Aug 1988 \\"The Redfern Mystery\\" by Len Morgan. Accessed October 15,2018 Carlin believed the area to be approximately 40 miles NNW of Angel Falls.

Wards in dark grey were not contested in 2014. The 2014 Wyre Forest District Council election took place on 22 May 2014 to elect members of Wyre Forest District Council in Worcestershire, England. One third of the council was up for election and the council stayed under no overall control. After the election, the composition of the council was *Conservative 15 *Labour 9 *Health Concern 7 *UK Independence Party 5 *Independent 4 *Liberal 2 Background Between the last election in 2012 and the 2014 election there were several changes in the political composition due to defections. Only weeks after the 2012 election, Offmore and Comberton councillor Rose Bishop defected from the Liberals to the Conservatives, taking the Conservatives to exactly half of the seats on the council, with 21 councillors. However, in May 2013 the Conservative councillor for Aggborough and Spennells, John Aston, left the party to sit as an independent after failing to be backed by the Conservatives for the position of vice chairman of the council. Also in May 2013 the Conservative councillor for Mitton, Mike Salter, left the party to become an independent, and then went on to join Health Concern later that year. Finally in March 2014, the councillor for Bewdley and Arley Julian Phillips quit the Conservative party to become an independent. These changes meant that before the 2014 election there were 18 Conservative councillors, 9 Health Concern, 8 Labour, 3 Liberals and 3 independents in the Liberal and Independent group, and one other independent councillor. In April 2014 the council got a new leader after Conservative John Campion resigned and party colleague Marcus Hart was elected to succeed him. Candidates 14 seats were contested in 2014 with the successful candidates only being elected for one year as the whole council was being elected in 2015 after boundary changes. The Conservatives defended 8 of the 14 seats, with 2 cabinet members standing for re-election, John Campion and Ian Hardiman, while the former Liberal councillor Rose Bishop defended Offmore and Comberton as a Conservative. Of the remaining six seats contested, three were held by Health Concern, with Mike Salter defending Aggborough and Spennells for the party after his move from the Conservatives. However councillor Howard Martin stood in Broadwaters for Labour after originally being elected for Health Concern in 2010. Independent John Aston stood in Aggborough and Spennells after his move from the Conservatives, while the final seat in Greenhill was held by Liberal Tim Ingham before the election. However Ingham stood in Offmore and Comberton at the 2014 election, leaving Rachel Lewis to defend Greenhill for the Liberal Party. Meanwhile, the UK Independence Party did not have any seats before the election, but stood candidates for all 14 seats that were contested. They were joined by the Conservatives, Health Concern and Labour in contesting every seat, while the Liberal Party, Green Party, Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition and an independent contested some of the seats. Election result The UK Independence Party gained five seats, to get the party's first councillors on Wyre Forest District Council and they came within 100 votes of overtaking the Conservatives in the share of the vote. The gains came from the Conservatives in Franche and Oldington and Foley Park, from Labour in Broadwaters, in Mitton from Health Concern and in Greenhill from the Liberal Party. Despite losing three seats the Conservative party remained the largest party on the council with 15 councillors, but Conservative cabinet member Ian Hardiman was defeated in Habberley and Blakebrook and the vice-chairman of the council Daniel McCann lost in Franche. Labour became the second largest party on the council with 9 seats after gaining seats in Habberley and Blakebrook and Areley Kings. However they lost Broadwaters to the UK Independence Party and dropped to fourth in vote share with 18% of the vote. Health Concern lost two seats to have seven councillors but won the third most votes, while the Liberals lost a seat in Greenhill to have two councillors. Finally John Aston held Aggborough and Spennells as an independent, meaning there remained four independents on the council. Overall turnout at the election was 36%. Following the election the unaffiliated independent councillor Julian Phillips joined the Liberal and Independent group, which then formed an alliance with the Conservatives to control the council. Between the 15 Conservatives, 4 independents and 2 Liberals they controlled exactly half of the seats on the council. Conservative Marcus Hart remained leader of the council, with the leader of the Liberal and Independent group Helen Dyke joining the council cabinet.

The novel depicts life in Ukraine a hundred years after the present time. Ukraine returned to the Middle Ages because of consequences of Russian occupation. The main character Olexandr Sahaidachny, whose mind was used for creation of Russian military satellites's supercomputers, is trying to get back his lost memory and wife. For this, he embarks on a mysterious city Kaharlyk, where time stopped after testing the newest Russian weapons. Story of the novel's creation The novel was started in December 12, 2012 as a Facebook page, where author published 100 words - messages from parallel reality of a future - everyday. The project has been planned as multimedia one. The author recorded several music fragments in concrete music genre for it, using instead of musical instruments sounds of surrounding reality (such as knocks at the washing machine, fridge, radiator, pans, coffee mill electric motor, Serbian orthodox chorals fragments etc.) united in absurd collages to illustrate storyline. Memory's block. Picture from \\"Kaharlyk\\". Plot summary The plot unfolds in 2114 year or 100 after Euromaidan and Russian invasion in Ukraine. The local population in Ukraine is in the medieval state. The main character Olexander Sahaidachny recovers consciousness in a house at the edge of Kyiv. He feels almost full loss of his memory and remembers just one that he needs to find his wife Olena immediately. Sahaydachnyi hopes that his memory will turn back together with his wife. In the same house, he meets Birgir Hansen, unknown person who knows something about his past and suggests finding his wife in a little town Kaharlyk (next to Kyiv), besides Birgir hints to the fact that the outside world is changed in a peculiar way and it is very difficult to survive there. Out in the street, Olexander meets a Kaharlyk inhabitant old man Petro and he agreed to take him to his house and even shelter there. Sahaydachnyi unsuccessfully tries to find his wife, but found just some evidences of Russian occupation in old newspapers. Soon old man Petro dies. Sahaydachnyi finds on the road badly wounded orthodox fundamentalist Mikhail Kalashnikov. Dying Kalashnikov asks Olexander to back-up his mind in the special device ‚Äúmorphone‚Äù before his death and suggests to find Olena in Kyiv. Connectome. Picture from \\"Kaharlyk\\". Kyiv is a devastated city with 2500 people. Sahaydachnyi meets priest Andryi there. Andryi professes a special kind of religion and believes that God is hiding on the Earth amongst beggars and refuses to rule this world. Together with Andryi they go in disturbed by war supermarket, where ancient morphones with long before died people are piled. The supermarket dweller major Hryhorenko together with priest Andryi try listening to old morphones establish what year is it now. Some people who want to seize with food remains constantly attack the dwelling of Hryhorenko. One of them kills major and the killer is immediately murdered by a mysterious creature ‚Äì Russian military satellite armed with nuclear laser, which states that its mind was copied from Olexander Sahaydachnyi mind. Priest Anryi persuades Sahaydachnyi to stay in Kyiv, but he decides to come back in Kaharlyk to search Olena there. Russian military satellite is in the opposition to the power in Moscow and doesn't execute its orders. It says that he is going to save Olexander Sahaydachnyi and convey him to the civilized world. It established a special foundation for the purpose and hired Birgir Hansen to go in Ukraine. But he refused to convey Sahaydachnyi at once and decided firstly to explore folklore traditions which emerged around Kaharlyk, where time has stopped forever owing to Russian military experiments. Leaving Kyiv Sahaydachnyi meets Birgir again. He says Olexander that is going to folklore expedition in Kaharlyk, so they are going there together. Morphone. Picture from \\"Kaharlyk\\". The first village on the road was Lisnyky where space-time anomalies considerably influence life of its people. Birgir tells Olexander the story of his previous life: after going to Ukraine he was busy with terraforming of the Mars watching over a nuclear power plant which melted Mars polar cap. It was a dull work, so he went to Ukraine for adventures and exiting experience. The next village on the road to Kaharlyk is Hodosivka. Its people were tortured by a peculiar religious cult. Next village Romankiv was completely under the ground. Its people hid there from Russian occupation, but stayed there even after the war was finished. In Obuhiv village people exist dottedly periodically appearing from other times. Russian military satellite ‚ÄúYuri Gagarin‚Äù was in the near-earth geostationary orbit and its mind was copied from Olexander Sahaydachnyi mind too, but Gagarin was fully loyal to the power in Moscow. It made an attempt to eliminate real Sahaydachnyi on the road between Obuhiv and Kaharlyk, but missed the mark because of strong space- time anomalies. The shot led to elimination of Yuri Gagarin itself. Neuron. Picture from \\"Kaharlyk\\". In Kaharlyk Olexander meets Olena, a 50-year-old woman. He thinks that she is his missed wife and her age is explained by time anomalies of the town. Olena tells that she was searching for her husband too, but says that Olexander is not like him. Though Olena agrees to consider Olexander as her husband, because she is not sure due to her weak memory. Birgir suggests Sahaydachnyi to go abroad at least, but he refuses, because wants to put Ukraine in order. He is going to write a novel about his adventures. Suddenly on the edge of the town he notices inscription on the wall ‚ÄúKontraktova Square 12 Olena‚Äù. It is a place in Kyiv so it gives him hope that real Olena could wait for him in Kyiv and Olexander sets out there again. Main topics of the novel * Impossibility of an adequate mind's copy, because of constant and unforeseen original's changes. * Critics of aggressive semantic monopoly as an attempt to determine the only version of any sense with the help of brutal force. * Distrust to a suggested version of the reality and, as a consequence, - constant search of its alternative. Reception Andrey Kurkov \\"Book discoveries-2014 of the famous book lovers\\" Chytomo \\"Oleh Shynkarenko's novel \\"Kaharlyk\\" is assembled from many of one- hundred-words units and best of all suited to my understanding of the hologram-novel, a novel that consists of artfully carved puzzles which a reader has to collect in a complete picture of a fictional life invented by the author. However, that invented life has coincided largely with the new reality that came to Ukraine late last year. But real Ukrainian life approaching to the novel \\"Kagarlyk\\" is not decisive for me in evaluating this wonderful and talented work\\".

The span crossing Rock Creek in 2015. The three portions of the bridge built at different times are clearly distinguishable. The K Street Bridge is a complex of bridges over Rock Creek and the Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway in Washington, D.C. The lower level of the bridge carries the surface street K Street, while the upper level carries the Whitehurst Freeway (U.S. Route 29) which terminates and merges into K Street immediately east of the bridge. The central bridge is flanked by two flyover ramps that connect to the nearby terminus of Interstate 66.Ross, Amy (1992). History and Description (Drawing 10) The first bridge on the site was a stone arch bridge constructed in 1792; it was only the second crossing of Rock Creek built, the first being at M Street. This bridge was found to be unstable and its center arch was demolished in 1795. In 1869, a wood bridge was constructed, and in 1907 it was replaced by a steel-plate girder bridge. The completion of the Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway in 1936 increased traffic on the K Street Bridge, necessitating its replacement. The lower level of the current bridge was constructed between 1939 and 1941, and the upper level, connecting to the Whitehurst Freeway, was constructed from 1947 to 1949. The designers of the current K Street Bridge also designed the Charles C. Glover Memorial Bridge farther up the river. The bridge is built of concrete, faced with gneiss. The flanking ramps were constructed in the early 1960s. They initially contained unused branches intended to connect to the unbuilt North Leg of the Inner Loop Expressway. These ramps were demolished in the mid-1990s.Davis, Timothy (1992). History and Description, pp. 13, 109, 125 The bulk of the K Street Bridge, with its many ramps, was considered to be more of a visual barrier than the other bridges across Rock Creek. This was a result of transportation efficiency taking precedence over aesthetic concerns in this case, perhaps because at the time of its construction the surrounding neighborhoods were industrial or poor residential areas.

Plot Velveteen & Mandala takes place in a dystopian Tokyo that is in the midst of a war. The story focuses on the high school students Velveteen, who lives in a battle tank on a riverbed in Tokyo's Suginami ward, and her frenemy Mandala. After a large air raid, zombies start to fall from the sky, and the girls get involved in exterminating the zombies in the dry riverbed area. Although they have to fight the zombies, most of conflict is between them as they are both deeply disturbed. Release A seinen manga, Velveteen & Mandala first appeared as a serial from June 2007 and October 2009 in Ohta Publishing's Manga Erotics F magazine. The 14 chapters of the series were compiled into a single tank≈çbon released by Ohta Publishing on November 26, 2009. In the following year, at the Anime Weekend Atlanta, Vertical announced that it had licensed the manga for an English-language translation in North America. Vertical's representative Ioannis Mentzas said the series was chosen among other Matsumoto's title on the basis that it had not been scanlated. Vertical released the manga on August 30, 2011. Reception Carlo Santos of Anime News Network praised the series for its visuals, but criticized its plot and some \\"tasteless displays\\". He wrote, \\"the bizarre imagery, where Matsumoto crosses all lines of good taste and common sense, is what makes it stick. [...] Yet Matsumoto's sketchy lines are just as capable of lush riverbank landscapes and slick action shots, and when that beauty meets the ugliness of the story, that's when the artist's unique vision fully takes hold.\\" However, he declared, \\"Story-wise, Velveteen and Mandala is in serious need of some editing and rethinking\\" and that \\"those stomach-churning scenes\\" do not \\"really add a point to the story, aside from being a shocking moment\\".

However, she was very critical of his use of \\"sexual violence to titillate and shock the reader\\", especially seem in a gang rape scene.

Garrity praised its \\"vibrantly sketchy art\\" and its \\"original take on zombie horror\\". In her words, \\"Matsumoto twists the raw material of a straightforward zombie horror romp into a trippy, Donnie Darko- like plunge into the psychic darkness, peppering it with dark humor\\".

Under this project, the Indian Navy intends to acquire six diesel-electric submarines, which will also feature advanced air-independent propulsion systems to enable them to stay submerged for longer duration and substantially increase their operational range. All six submarines are expected to be constructed in Indian shipyards.  History  In 1997, Ministry of Defence approved a plan to acquire 24 submarines under Project 75. After the Kargil War in 1999, Cabinet Committee on Security approved a 30-year submarine building plan that called for two parallel production lines, each constructing six submarines. The older Project 75 was brought under the new plan, with the two production lines to be built under Project 75 and Project 75I using transfer of technology from different foreign manufacturers. In 2008, it was reported that a Request for Information (RFI) had been issued to Armaris, HDW and Rosoboronexport for six submarines with air-independent propulsion and land-attack capability that were to be built in India. In July 2010, Defence Acquisition Council of Ministry of Defence decided to import two submarines, build three at Mazagon Dock and one at Hindustan Shipyard with a budget of . After the project was approved by Defence Acquisition Council in August 2010, an RFI was issued again in September 2010. However, the Request for Proposal was not approved by Cabinet Committee on Security due to a difference of opinion between the navy and ministry on the involvement of private shipyards in the project. As a result, the approval lapsed and was renewed multiple times till 2013. In October 2014, the Defence Acquisition Council decided to construct all six submarines in India and approved a budget of . Along with the state-owned Mazagon Dock, Hindustan Shipyard, and Cochin Shipyard, privately owned Larsen & Toubro and Pipavav Shipyard were allowed to bid for the project in collaboration with a foreign shipyard. Kockums, Naval Group, Rosoboronexport and ThyssenKrupp responded to an RFI issued in 2017. In June 2017, it was reported that the contract for construction would be awarded under \\"Strategic Partnership\\" policy, which would eliminate state-owned shipyards from contention. After the approval lapsed in February 2018, the Defence Acquisition Council renewed the approval with a budget of in January 2019. In April 2019, an Expression of Interest was issued for six submarines capable of firing land-attack and anti-ship cruise missiles. On 21 January 2020, the Government of India shortlisted Larsen & Toubro and Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders as the two Indian firms.

Lingenfelter, Steamboats on the Colorado River, 1852-1916, University of Arizona Press, Tucson, 1978 History The Nina Tilden came to be built by Alphonso F. Tilden, of the Philadelphia Silver and Copper Mining Company to secure direct shipments of goods to his mines and to challenge the monopoly of the Colorado River trade by the George A. Johnson Company. The Johnson Company had raised its freight rates to and from Tilden's mines in Eldorado Canyon in late 1863 after the mines there began processing their ore in their own quartz mill. Moreover, Johnson's steamboats would not go above Hardyville except from June to October the time of high water, and shipments above Hardyville in low water had to polled up river by barge at $40 a ton from there. More importantly there was a general discontent by miners and merchants in the up river mines and settlements over high prices and shortages that arose in late 1863. A lack of adequate shipping on the part of the company to carry the volume of cargo caused by the Colorado River mining boom had slowed delivery of goods up river from the ships in the estuary of the Colorado. Additionally steamboat captains were profiteering on the resulting shortages brought on by this bottleneck in the supply chain. With the potential freighting profits to be made competing with the Johnson Company along the river, Tilden, decided to put a second opposition steamboat on the river, the Nina Tilden, named for Tilden's wife. She was built in San Francisco by Martin Vice and was launched in July 1864. She was 97 feet long, with a 22-foot beam, and drew 12 inches of water when light. During its test run in the bay, it was able to do 16 knots. It was capable of carrying up to 120 tons and would tow a 100-ton barge. Tilden hired a veteran captain of the Sacramento and Fraser Rivers, George B. Gorman, steamed the Nina Tilden down the coast to the Colorado River. In September, Gorman also began to compete with the Johnson Company and with the rival opposition steamboat Esmerelda of the Union Line, towing the barge White Fawn, knocked down and shipped in a schooner to the estuary where it was reassembled. With the addition of the two opposition steamers using barges and a third Johnson steamer the \\"Mohave\\" in furious competition, the backlog of freight that had stimulated the creation of the rival steamboat companies went away by the fall of 1864. In the summer of 1865, Tilden sold the Nina Tilden which was consolidated with the Esmerelda, into a unified opposition line the Pacific and Colorado Steam Navigation Company, headed by Thomas E. Trueworthy, with backing from San Francisco financiers. However, in 1866, the Esmerelda and Nina Tilden were seized by the Sheriff of Yuma County, for debts owned by Thomas E. Trueworthy's company. The boats passed through the hands of Arizona Navigation Company, another company the creditors tried to form hoping to salvage the opposition steamboat business. This failed and Johnson bought both boats and their barges in 1868. The Nina Tilden continued in use on the river by Johnson's company and his new Colorado Steam Navigation Company that succeeded it. Nina Tilden carried the archives of the county seat of Yuma County from La Paz to Arizona City when its location was changed in 1870.Will Croft Barnes, Arizona Place Names, University of Arizona Press, 1988, p.238 Fate of the Nina Tilden In 1874, the Nina Tilden was retired, and tied up at Port Isabel, Sonora following the construction there of the Gila, its replacement in 1873. Soon after she broke her lines during a high tide, was caught broadside to the tidal bore and was capsized, destroying her upper works and blocking the channel of the port.

History While there is no settlement called Meline, the name may refer to a mill on one of the rivers that run through the north of the parish, including the Nevern and Brynberian. Meline (as Malenay) appears on a 1578 parish map of Pembrokeshire. The parish was in the ancient Hundred of Cemais and in 1833 was described as including some ancient mansions as well as prehistoric features. In 1835 the parish had a population of 492 of which 30 or 40 attended Sunday School in the summer months. By the 1870s the population had fallen to 414 people, living in 108 houses and fell to below 300 in the mid-20th century. At the turn of the 20th century Meline was sharing a Board School with Whitechurch (Eglwyswen). Parish The parish, with an area of , includes the hamlet of Crosswell, a number of other minor settlements and farms, and extends southwards into the Preseli Mountains. It is mostly within the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park. The former parish church, in the northern tip of the parish, is dedicated to St Dogmael (or Dogfael) and is a Grade-II listed building. It was built in 1865, replacing an earlier structure, possibly 13th century, some of which was incorporated into the present church, including the font.

Located in the southern outskirts of the city, in the Borgo Roma District, entrusted to the Discalced Carmelites. Construction began in 1901, was completed in 1904 and the church was consecrated the following year. The first stone was laid on 29 July 1901 and the project was completed in 1904. On 15 January 1905, the bishop of Verona Cardinal Bartolomeo Bacilieri inaugurated and blessed the church, originally dedicated to the Holy Family. Pope Pius XI raised it to the rank of minor basilica in 1938.  Description   Exterior  Two Gothic spires adorn the church's roof. The fa√ßade was clad in brick in 1968, while the bell tower was completed in 1955. The large square is surrounded by a sober and elegant wrought iron gate, supported by a foundation and white marble columns. In the middle of the square, surrounded by a bed of roses, stands the monument to Saint Therese, in white Carrara marble, sculpted in the characteristic position of throwing \\"her roses\\" towards those who come to the sanctuary. The neo-Gothic bell tower, with bold and sweet forms, houses a fine concert of bells hung for ringing in Veronese bellringing art. The collection was forged by the secular papal company of Daciano Colbachini of Padua in 1955. The largest of the nine bells emits the note of E flat, has a diameter of 120 cm and weighs 992 kg. Electricity was installed in 1957, in defiance of the Carmelite spirit and tradition of bell-ringing concerts which has previously only been performed by hand.  Interior  Interior of the Church The church's origins date back to January 1905, when it was blessed and inaugurated by the then Bishop of Verona Bartolomeo Bacilieri. The building was left incomplete (with only perimeter walls, no plaster, a rough ceiling and a concrete floor) until 1922 to 1923, when devotion to St Therese of the Child Jesus began to spread. The Gothic style church is presented in rare splendour with polychrome marbles, sculptures, mosaics, windows, paintings and decorations. On the large wall behind the fa√ßade is a fresco by Ugo Bargellini of Florence, which depicts the apotheosis of the Carmelite, with details of Saint Therese of the Child Jesus. 220 figures are depicted across 144 m¬≤ of wall. = Chapel of Saint Therese of the Child Jesus = The heart of the sanctuary is the chapel of Santa Teresa of the Child Jesus, which is richly decorated. At the centre is a solid bronze urn, supported by four angels. It contains a wax statue of the saint, depicted in the act of breathing her last, peering at the crowds of devotees and pilgrims who trust in her. In her hands she holds roses, eternally renewing her promise: \\"I will let fall a shower of roses.\\" The statue is dressed in a Carmelite habit, wearing the veil that Teresa had worn for several years in the monastery of Lisieux, and bears a reliquary chest in silver filigree containing a vertebra of the saint. = The Pipe Organ = The 4700 pipes of the organ designed by Fratelli Ruffatti are placed around two rooms with open galleries in the presbytery. It was installed in 1959 and restored in 1994. It has, 3 keyboards, 61 keys and a radial concave pedalboard of 32 keys, with an electric console, 101 plates, 3 pedal brackets (crescendo, espressivo I, espressivo III), and 10 to 16 adjustable memory banks.

The case was formally initiated with the filing of a complaint by Russia (in WTO terms, a \\"request for consultations\\") on April 30, 2014. The dispute concerns the EU's Third Energy Package, which consists of various two EU directives and EU regulations. Russia claims that the measures within the package violate Articles II, VI, XVI and XVII of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS); Articles I, III, X and XI of the 1994 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT); Article 3 of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM); and Article 2 of the Agreement on Trade Related Investment Measures (TRIM).  History of the dispute and background The European Commission adopted the Third Energy Package, which came into effect in 2009.Russia turns to WTO over EU energy package, International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development (May 13, 2014). The measures aimed to promoted a more competitive European Union-wide market in the energy sector. One provision in the package prohibits energy suppliers from also owning distribution networks, including pipelines. The new rules were opposed by Russia and its state-owned enterprise Gazprom, which supplies more than 25% of Europe's gas by transnational pipelines, and is the sole supplier of case for several EU member states, mostly Eastern European nations that were formerly part of the Soviet bloc. Russia considered filing a challenge to the Third Energy Package as early as November 2011.Gleb Bryanski, Russia may contest EU energy rules in WTO - source, Reuters, November 16, 2011. The filing of the complaint in 2014 is viewed as part of a wider decline in relations between Russia and the EU, occurring simultaneously with tensions over the Russian occupation of Crimea and other Russian involvement in Ukraine. Russia previously filed an anti-dumping complaint against the EU in the WTO, while the EU filed a complaint against Russia in the WTO over its ban on imported pork products and a separate complaint over Russia's \\"recycling fee\\" for vehicles, which the EU argues is a protectionist policy that favors Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan, the three members of the Russian-led Eurasian Customs Union,. At an April 2014 meeting of the WTO Council for Trade in Goods, for example, Angelos Pangratis, the EU ambassador to the WTO, stated: \\"The overall experience with Russia as WTO member is, to our regrets, rather disappointing. Russia has not shown willingness to put its trade measures in line with basic WTO obligations and has continued raising a number of trade obstacles inconsistent with its WTO obligations.\\" Products at dispute  The WTO case   Ruling of WTO  See also *Dispute settlement in the World Trade Organization *Nord Stream *South Stream Pipeline *Russia in the European energy sector *Russia‚ÄìEuropean Union relations *Russia‚ÄìUkraine gas disputes References Energy in the European Union Energy in Russia Russia‚ÄìEuropean Union relations World Trade Organization dispute settlement cases Energy policies and initiatives of the European Union ","title":"European Union and its Member States ‚Äî Certain Measures Relating to the Energy Sector"},{"id":"46456644","text":"Middle Village is the name of several areas: In the United States * Middle Village, Queens, in New York City ** Middle Village ‚Äì Metropolitan Avenue (BMT Myrtle Avenue Line), a subway station in Middle Village * Station Camp, or Middle Village, a historical site on the Columbia River that is part of Lewis and Clark National Historical Park * Middle Village, Michigan, a historic village located in modern-day Readmond Township, Michigan * Middle Village, Wisconsin In other countries Places that mean \\"Middle Village\\" in other languages include: * Medelby (Germany, Sweden and Finland) * Ortak√∂y, Nicosia (Cyprus) * Ortak√∂y (Turkey) * Chaupimarca (Peru) ","title":"Middle Village"},{"id":"46456646","text":"Young Hearts () is a 1944 German drama film directed by Boleslaw Barlog and starring , Ingrid Lutz, and .

It provides a set of rules based on traditional archival principles, whose purpose is to provide a consistent and commonly shared descriptive foundation for describing archival materials within a given fonds. RAD was first published in 1990 after being developed by the Bureau of Canadian Archivists' (BCA) Planning Committee on Descriptive Standards. It is currently overseen by the Canadian Committee on Archival Description of the Canadian Council of Archives. RAD was last revised in 2008. General Framework Similar in structure to AACR2, RAD provides archivists with a framework for generating archival descriptions and finding aids. It is a multi-level descriptive metadata standard structured to reflect the context of a group of records based on the manner in which they were created, used, and managed. RAD takes a top-down approach to archival description, beginning with a general description of the records at the fonds-level and becoming more specific as description progresses at lower levels. Completed descriptions vary in depth, but often include a biographical sketch about the creator of the records, information about the physical extent of the material, and an overview - in the form of a scope and content note - about what the archival fonds consists of.  Six Levels of Description  RAD designates six levels of description, which are arranged in a hierarchical nature. The fonds represents the broadest level of description and the top of the hierarchical tree, and the item representing the lowest level of description. The six levels of description detailed in RAD, as explained by the Saskatchewan Council for Archives and Archivists (SCAA), are: #The fonds: The broadest intellectual unit of description, which is the collective of all records created by a single entity. #The sous-fonds: Described in the same manner as the fonds. The sous- fonds contains all records of a sub-unit of the organization that created the fonds. #The series: A group of records within a fonds or sous-fonds, which are created or gathered from the same subject, entity, or function, all sharing some relationship that is related to their creation or usage. The series is the link between the records created with the fonds. #The sub-series: Described in the same manner as the series. A sub-series contains records within a series that are easily identified as being dependent on the basis of classification or content. #The file: Consists of documents that were filed together in order to reflect the same subject or activity, along with containing the same title. A file is not to be confused with a folder, which is considered a document storage unit, while the file is an intellectual level of description. A single file may contain an undisclosed number of folders. #The item: The item represents the lowest level of description, and the smallest intellectual entity contained in a fonds. As a result of the item being an intellectual unit, it may hold a number of individual things.  RAD Elements  Descriptions within the RAD framework are composed of what is called an element. There are various elements that contain specific types of information about both the record and the creating entity, and these elements are listed within a specific order. While these elements are listed within a specific order within a description, RAD allows for flexibility in how the order of elements is presented since it does not specify any standard presentation of information.  Required Elements  Title, dates, extent, administrative history, biographical sketch, and scope and content are required RAD elements: * Title (Rule 1.1) * Dates (Rule 1.4) * Extent (Rule 1.5) * Administrative History (Rule 1.7B1) * Biographical Sketch (Rule 1.7B2) * Scope and Content (Rule 1.7D)  Additional Elements  As per the SCAA, six additional elements should also be considered for a basic RAD description: * Custodial History (Rule 1.7C) * Source of Supplied Title (Rule 1.8B2) * Physical Description (Rule 1.8B9) * Arrangement Note (Rule 1.8B13) * Restrictions (Rule 1.8B16) * Accruals (Rule 1.8B19)  External links   References  Archival science Metadata standards Metadata ","title":"Rules for Archival Description"},{"id":"46456704","text":"Frank Lisciandro is an American photographer, film maker, writer and musical journalist with works in photojournalism, reportage, documentary and street photography.

Early life  D'Amato was born to Italian American parents in 1908 in Atlantic City, New Jersey. He was one of eight children. When one or both of their parents died, D'Amato opened a cigar store at the age of 15 to help support the other seven children. The store was very successful. Career D'Amato's initial success in Atlantic City began to grow when he opened up a restaurant and gambling hall called \\"Luigi's\\". He put the famous 500 Club under his ownership. He began working for corrupt Atlantic County treasurer Enoch \\"Nucky\\" Johnson and his political organization. D'Amato was also an associate of Chicago Outfit boss Sam Giancana and New Orleans crime family boss Carlos Marcello. Philadelphia crime family underboss Marco Reginelli, a leader in the Italian Philadelphia-South Jersey mob for years, allegedly sold the 500 Club to D‚ÄôAmato. http://jfkcountercoup.blogspot.com/2008/10/atlantic-city-new- jersey.html  The 500 Club  The 500 Club was allegedly a front for an illegal gambling operation. To draw gamblers, he had such big-name entertainers as Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis, Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis perform at the club. He also managed a club in Lake Tahoe for Sinatra, for which he got troubles from the IRS and lost a lot of money when the casino commission linked Giancana to the Lake Tahoe operation and revoked its license in 1963. Mr. D'Amato was never convicted of a crime, and never spent a day in prison. Soon Atlantic City began to decline and the 500 Club, once the most popular nightclub in the nation, was on its way out, too. Skinny's wife suffered medical problems for five years and died in 1972. In June 1973, The 500 Club burned to the ground. Skinny, with scant insurance, lost about $2 million on the fire. He never recovered ‚Äî financially, emotionally or spiritually.

The couple had two children and remained married until Creamer's death in 1972. In 1976, their son Angelo was charged with the murder of a co-worker at the D'Amato home in Ventnor. After his release from prison, Angelo was sentenced to 25-years-to-life in prison on October 7, 1983, for the murder of 28-year-old Keerans Carter in 1981.

He was the first to be initiated into Filiki Eteria in Moscow by Nikolaos Skoufas in 1814. Biography He was the younger brother of Panagiotis and Athanasios Sekeris. He took his first steps in education at the well-known school of Dimitsana and later, in 1808, he followed his brother Panagiotis in Constantinople, where he continued his studies. Georgios didn't wish to become a trader, but he wanted to study military science instead. In 1811, Panagiotis Sekeris sent him to apprentice at the centers of Greek intellectuals (Bucharest, Ia»ôi, Moscow, Vienna). In 1813 he went to Paris, where he became acquainted with Adamantios Korais.D. Visvizi-Donda [Œî.

In 1814 Georgios traveled to Moscow, because he wanted to visit his brother Athanasios. While he was there, he met Athanasios Tsakalov, an acquaintance from Paris, who told him about the purpose of Filiki Eteria, a secret organization that he recently founded together with Nikolaos Skoufas and Emmanuil Xanthos.

Visvizi-Donda, 2003‚Äì2005, p. 288-289. When the Greek Revolution broke out he decided to rerun home. He set off from Marseille on 18 July 1821, on a brig charted by Alexandros Mavrokordatos, and arrived at Missolonghi on 21 July. From Messolonghi he went to the camp in Trikorfa, where Demetrios Ypsilantis was. Georgios followed Alexandros Mavrokordatos to Zarakova, where proestoi, the local notables, gathered in order to form the country's governing body. When he returned to Trikorfa, the Siege of Tripolitsa had begun. There, Georgios excelled due to his great abilities and bravery. He was appointed chieftain of Mantineian army but later his duties were restricted and he became an army leader of Tripolitsa province. He took part in the Siege of Old Patras, where he excelled in the battle on 9 March 1822, and in the Battles of Dervenakia, of Agios Sostis and of Agionori on the 26‚Äì28 July 1822. When Dramalis's army was defeated they fled to Corinth, but they were followed by Theodoros Kolokotronis, who led the siege of Corinth. Then, the people from Tripolitsa stayed in Dervenakia under the leadership of Georgios Sekeris. However, Georgios exhausted by the hardships of war fell ill and was taken to Tripoli, where he died on 12 November 1822.D. Visvizi-Donda, 2003‚Äì2005, p. 324-325.

The program utilized a local/national hybrid format billed as a \\"provocative and unpredictable\\" combination of general and political news, health, entertainment, technology and opinion segments, mixed with humor and variety elements; stations carrying the program are given the option to provide news, weather and traffic inserts focusing on their local market each half-hour. At the show's conclusion, it was hosted by Laila Muhammad, Oliver Tull, Neeha Curtis, Hilary Kennedy, Allyn Hoang, Courtenay DeHoff and Kevin Roth, who was also the show's meteorologist. History The idea for the program was conceived by Tribune Company chief innovation officer Lee Abrams (who resigned in October 2010). In the spring of 2011, Tribune Broadcasting developed a concept for a morning news program intended for stations owned by the company that did not maintain existing news departments. The program, which was given the title Eye Opener, would incorporate a local/national format (with the intent to syndicate the program to other markets) similar to that of morning news programs on the major broadcast television networks, with three-minute-long national segments conducted in a more free-form style. Steve Charlier, senior vice president of news at Tribune Broadcasting, described the program as a platform in which \\"comedy meets national news,\\" designed to distinguish itself and stations carrying the program by offering a morning show that stands out from its traditionally formatted competitors. The program debuted as a test run on May 9, 2011 on Tribune-owned CW affiliate KIAH in Houston, Texas ‚Äì which maintained a news department, but only carried twice-daily evening newscasts ‚Äì replacing syndicated programs and infomercials in the two-hour timeslot (from 6:00 to 8:00 a.m.); the program's national segments ‚Äì originally hosted by Kirby O'Connell, Sean Dowling and Adam Lee Campbell ‚Äì were initially produced in studio facilities at the Tribune Tower in Chicago, which also serves as the corporate headquarters for the Tribune Company. The program was originally hosted by Kirby O‚ÄôConnell, Sean Dowling (who served as news anchor) and Adam Lee Campbell (who handled consumer, technology and pop culture-related reports), with the hosts appearing in more casual attire. In addition to news, health and parenting advice segments, the program initially also featured more irreverent and humorous features including a how-to segment conducted by a \\"hunky handyman\\" character named \\"Wrench,\\" a commentary segment by Roger Lodge and a social media segment by \\"Monsignor Jebediah O'Flaherty,\\" a character used as part of a segment lampooning celebrity tweets. On October 31, 2011, production of the program's national segments was relocated to the studios of Tribune's Dallas CW affiliate, KDAF; the program largely overhauled its hosting staff with the relocation, with co-hosts Ellen Fox and Douglas Caballero, and sole holdover Dowling. The program concurrently began airing on KDAF and was also syndicated to fellow Tribune station, MyNetworkTV affiliate WPHL-TV in Philadelphia, later expanding to two of their sister stations ‚Äì CW affiliates KRCW-TV in Portland and WSFL-TV in Miami (all three of which, unlike KDAF and KIAH, did not produce their own news programming) on January 2, 2012. These stations were chosen by Tribune for the initial national rollout of Eye Opener as they, as Charlier noted, \\"need to be growth markets\\" that also have a population skewing toward the program's 18-49 target audience, with plans to eventually syndicate the program to stations not owned by Tribune Broadcasting. By July 2012, in the Dallas, Philadelphia and Houston markets, Eye Opener saw an increase in viewers in the 25-54 demographic year- to-year in the program's scheduled time periods, whereas viewership in that demographic declined in Miami and Portland. In September 2012, Eye Opener began airing on MyNetworkTV affiliates KXNW in Fort Smith, Arkansas (which Tribune earlier acquired in November 2011) and WWMB in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Eye Opener expanded to weekends on September 20, 2014, with the premiere of an hour-long edition of Saturday and Sunday mornings on KDAF and KIAH.

Its boss, Enoch \\"Nucky\\" Johnson, coordinated the Organizations's bootlegging, gambling, racketeering, and prostitution activities.  Origins   Early history  Before the rise of German American political boss Louis \\"Commodore\\" Kuehnle and Irish American treasurer Nucky Johnson, Atlantic City's government was run by a three-man group, including: Atlantic County Clerk Lewis P. Scott (1854-1907) and Congressman John J. Gardner (1845-1921), and Mays Landing sheriff and Atlantic City undersheriff Smith E. Johnson.Johnson, Nelson. Boardwalk Empire, Medford, N.J., Plexus Publishing, 2002 = The Kuehnle regime =  New regime  After the conviction of Kuehnle in 1911, Smith Johnson's son became boss of the organization. Under his son's new regime, the organization became more successful for the next 30 years than it would ever be.  Nucky's paradise and Prohibition  Smith Johnson's son Enoch Lewis \\"Nucky\\" Johnson was born in 1883. Nucky became undersheriff in 1905 while his father was sheriff of Atlantic City. The younger Johnson was eventually elected sheriff in 1908. In 1909, he became secretary of the very powerful Atlantic County Republican Executive Committee.Learn, Paul. \\"Boss 'Nucky' Johnson is dead at 85 ‚Äì Unconscious 25 Hours Before 'Time Took Him'\\", Atlantic City Press, December 10, 1968, p. 1 After the conviction of Kuehnle on corruption charges in 1911, the younger Johnson became boss of the organization. Johnson also held several other jobs, including: Atlantic County Treasurer (1914‚Äì1941), County Tax Collector, publisher of a weekly newspaper, bank director, president of a building and loan company, and director of a Philadelphia brewery. Johnson was known to be a very well dressed and nice man who would rarely say no. He wore tailored suits, owned the entire ninth floor of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, and he owned a chauffeur-driven $14,000 1920 powder blue Rolls Royce Silver Ghost; which was his trademark car. It was known that when Nucky prospered, everyone prospered in his organization and the city. Johnson once explained, \\"when I lived well, everybody lived well.\\" Johnson has been described as running his criminal-political empire with a \\"velvet hammer\\".Velvet hammer When Prohibition went in effect in Atlantic City in January 1920, Johnson and his organization went straight into the bootlegging business. He allied himself with several other well-known bootleggers, including: Arnold Rothstein (New York's Jewish mob boss), Charlie Luciano (Masseria family lieutenant), Johnny Torrio (Chicago South Side Gang boss), and Benny Siegel (Bugs and Meyer Mob boss). Nucky had also helped Republican building constructor Edward Bader get elected as mayor in 1920. And through Bader's construction business, he built the Atlantic City Convention Hall in 1929. Johnson and Luciano began forming the Big Seven during the mid-to-late 1920s. The group was supposed to help solve bootlegging disputes and serve as a predecessor to the National Crime Syndicate in the 1930s. It was around this time that Johnson met a bellhop at the Ritz, named Jimmy Boyd; the two took an instant liking to each other. Johnson began grooming Boyd to become the next boss of his organization, and soon, Boyd was Nucky's top enforcer/right-hand man and controlled all of the brothels, casinos, speakeasies, and numbers rackets in Atlantic City. = Atlantic City Conference = From May 13 to May 16, 1929, Johnson hosted the Atlantic City Conference at the Ritz-Carlton and Ambassador Hotels on the boardwalk. Based on his research, Nelson Johnson is of the opinion that the photograph is not genuine. He provided the accommodations, and guarantee that there would be no police interference (since his brother Alfred Johnson was the sheriff of Atlantic City at the time). The leaders that thought of the conference were: La Cosa Nostra Masseria crime family lieutenant Charlie Luciano and the former boss of Chicago's South Side Gang Johnny Torrio. Meyer Lansky and Benny Siegel (bosses of the Bugs and Meyer Mob) served as the muscle/security at the conference. Delegates included several notable Jewish and Italian mobsters, including: Alphonse \\"Scarface\\" Capone (boss of the Chicago Outfit)‚Äîwho was fighting a war with the Genna brothers against Dean O'Banion's North Side Gang‚Äî, Frank Costello and Joe Adonis (lieutenants in the Masseria family), Max Hoff (Philadelphia Jewish mob boss), Abe Bernstein (Purple Gang boss), Carlo Gambino (D'Aquila family lieutenant), and Gaetano Lucchese (Reina family lieutenant). Johnson's enforcer Jimmy Boyd is never mentioned by anyone to being at the convention, but since Boyd was Nucky's right-hand man and an important figure in the organization, it is most likely that he was there to help make decisions for the organization. During the late 1930s and early 1940s, FBI special agent William Frank and his team of agents investigated into the activities of Johnson and his organization but were unable to do so successfully.  Kefauver Committee  On  Frank Farley  In 1941, Johnson was convicted of tax evasion charges and was sentenced to 10 years in a federal prison and fined $20,000. Following his conviction, New Jersey Senator Frank \\"Hap\\" Farley took over the organization.  In television  Nucky's organization is in the entire HBO series Boardwalk Empire, but is named Nucky Thompson's Organization; since instead of Nucky Johnson, his name is Nucky Thompson. Many members of the Thompson organization are based on or were in the Johnson organization; for example: Edward Bader, Frank Hague, Louis \\"Commodore\\" Kaestner (based on Louis \\"Commodore\\" Kuehnle), Jimmy Darmody (based on Jimmy Boyd), and Eddie Kessler (based on Johnson's German valet Louis Kessel). In the show, the organization is an official rival of Dr. Valentin Narcisse (based on Casper Holstein), Gyp Rosetti, Charlie Luciano, Meyer Lansky, Benjamin Siegel, George Remus, the D'Alessio Brothers, and an unofficial rival of Arnold Rothstein and Joe Masseria. The organization is allied with Al Capone, Johnny Torrio, Ralph Capone, Frank Capone, Arnold Rothstein, and Salvatore Maranzano.

Adam I is the external, career-driven, ambitious side, which Brooks calls the \\"r√©sum√©\\" self. The subject of this book, Adam II, is internal, humble and the \\"eulogy\\" self, the one who ‚Äúwants to have a serene inner character.‚Äù The bulk of the book is eight chapters of biographical sketches. Loosely one per chapter they are: Frances Perkins, Dwight D. Eisenhower with a page or two devoted to redefining sin for contemporary times, Dorothy Day, George Marshall, A. Philip Randolph and Bayard Rustin who organized the March on Washington, the novelist George Eliot and her mate George Lewes, Augustine and his mother Monica, Samuel Johnson and Michel de Montaigne, winding up with sketches of Johnny Unitas and Joe Namath.

Shortly afterwards, he went to Constantinople, where he soon became a highly capable wholesale merchant with a fleet of 15 ships, while, at the same time, he established branches of his business in Odessa and Moscow.Œ†Œ±Œ≥Œ∫œåœÉŒºŒπŒø ŒíŒπŒøŒ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒπŒ∫œå ŒõŒµŒæŒπŒ∫œå, ŒïŒ∫Œ¥ŒøœÑŒπŒ∫ŒÆ ŒëŒ∏Œ∑ŒΩœéŒΩ, vol. 9ŒëŒÑ(1988), p. 224. Involvement in the Filiki Eteria Sekeris was initiated into the Filiki Eteria by Panagiotis Anagnostopoulos on 5 May 1818, in Constantinople, as it seems from a letter that he sent to his brother, Georgios Sekeris. Georgios was studying in Paris and was the first member who was initiated into the Filiki Eteria, immediately after its establishment (the initiation, by Nikolaos Skoufas, took place in Moscow in 1814). Sekeris was then 35 years old and his cash contribution to Filiki Eteria was 10,000 kuru≈ü, which was more than double the amount that Filiki Eteria had managed to raise within four years since its foundation. The initiation of Panagiotis Sekeris was crucial, because, through him, Filiki Eteria entered the circles of Constantinople merchants, who supported the economy, while his influence and abilities facilitated the expansion of Society‚Äôs network.M. Pananastasiou, 2015, p. 30 Moreover, he initiated several merchants and ship captains from the Aegean and Ionian Sea himself.D. Visvizi-Donda [Œî.

After Skoufas died in July 1818, by a joint decision of Xanthos and Anagnostopoulos, they revealed to Sekeris all about the \\"Invisible Authority\\" to ensure his full trust in the purposes of the Filiki Eteria. He calmly accepted the secrets of the Society and vowed that he would offer his life and his possessions for its purposes. He became one of the 16 leaders that formed the ‚ÄúInvisible Authority\\", but also the Society‚Äôs treasurer. Panagiotis Sekeris, after the departure of Anagnostopoulos and Xanthos from Constantinople in February 1819, became the only head of the Society. All the allegiance letters and the contributions of new members had to be addressed to him. He also had to meet the economic demands of the prominent members and inform the dispersed leaders. To meet the growing financial needs he was forced to use not only his prestige but mainly his personal fortune, which naturally began to decline. In 1820, having spent most of his fortune, he had to take loans from merchants in Constantinople for the current expenses of the Society. That resulted in the bankruptcy of his company.D. Visvizi-Donda, 2003-2005, p. 303-304. Years of the Greek Revolution When the Greek Revolution broke out, Sekeris was forced to leave Constantinople and he went to Odessa, leaving behind his entire estate, which value exceeded one million kuru≈ü. Considering his stay in Odessa temporary, he hoped that they would call him to offer his services to his homeland. But his hope proved to be false, which caused him great bitterness. A bitterness that intensified by the inability to contribute to the Revolution financially or physically by taking part in battle. However, although he was no longer financially able, he continued to offer its services to other compatriots who had taken refuge in Odessa.D. Visvizi-Donda, 2003-2005, p. 317. Returning to Greece Panagiotis Sekeris remained in Odessa until 1830, when he and his family moved to Greece and settled in Nafplio. Modest as it was, he did not get any significant public positions. He was hired as a tax collector first in Hydra and then in Nafplio, where he died in poverty. Despite his efforts, he failed to compensate for his material and moral contribution to the Struggle for Independence. Panagiotis Sekeris died on 29 January 1847, at the age of 64.D.

It depicts the Annunciation, the archangel Gabriel's announcement to the Virgin Mary that she would conceive and become the mother of Jesus, described in the Gospel of Luke (). The painting was completed and was partially transferred to canvas in the 1920s; it is today held in the Robert Lehman collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The panel shows Mary in a domestic interior with two attendant angels. Gabriel is dressed in ecclesiastical robes, while a dove hovers above Mary, representing the Holy Spirit. It expands upon the Annunciation wing of Rogier van der Weyden's Saint Columba Altarpiece. According to art historian Maryan Ainsworth, the work is a \\"startlingly original image, rich in connotations for the viewer or worshiper\\". The iconography focuses on the Virgin's purity. Her swoon foreshadows the Crucifixion of Jesus, and the panel emphasizes her role as mother, bride, and Queen of Heaven. The original frame survived until the 19th century and was inscribed with a date believed to be 1482; modern art historians have suggested that the number's final digit was a 9, which would give a date of 1489. In 1847 Gustav Friedrich Waagen described it as one of Memling's \\"finest and most original works\\".Sterling (1998), 81 In 1902, it was exhibited in Bruges at the Exposition des primitifs flamands √† Bruges, after which it underwent cleaning and restoration. Philip Lehman bought it in 1920 from the Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç family, who might have had it in their family since the 16th century; Antoni Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç discovered it on a family estate in the early 19th century. At that time, it had been pierced through with an arrow and required restoration. Description  Annunciation Robert Campin's c. 1420s Annunciation panel, (M√©rode Altarpiece), The Cloisters, New York, showing conventional iconography of a hearth and a vase of flowers The Annunciation was commemorated as a Catholic and Eastern Orthodox feast celebrating the announcement by the archangel Gabriel to the Virgin Mary that she would conceive and become the mother of Jesus. It was a popular theme in late medieval European art,\\"The Annunciation\\". Metropolitan Museum of Art. Retrieved April 28, 2015. Mary acts as Theotokos, the God-bearer as affirmed in 431 at the Council of Ephesus; two decades later the Council of Chalcedon affirmed the doctrine of Incarnation ‚Äì that Christ was of two natures (God and Man) ‚Äì and her perpetual virginity was affirmed at the Lateran Council of 631. In Byzantine art, Annunciation scenes depict the Virgin enthroned and dressed in royal regalia.Blum (1992), 52 In later centuries she was shown in enclosed spaces: the temple, the church, the garden.Blum (1992), 53 Left panel of Rogier van der Weyden's Saint Columba altarpiece, c. 1455, Alte Pinakothek, Munich. Rays of light stream through the open window toward the Virgin. In Early Netherlandish art the Annunciation is typically set in contemporary domestic interiors, a motif and tradition established by Robert Campin, and followed by Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden. Neither Campin nor van Eyck went so far as to set the scene in a bedchamber, although the motif is found in van der Weyden's c. 1435 Louvre Annunciation and c. 1455 Saint Columba altarpiece in which the Virgin kneels by the nuptial bed, rendered in red made from costly pigments. Memling's depiction is nearly identical to van der Weyden's Columba Altarpiece.Snyder (1987), 38 Figures The archangel Gabriel appears before Mary to announce that she will bear the Son of God.Howard (2000), 353 He is shown standing in a three-quarter view wearing a small jeweled diadem and dressed in vestments. He has a richly embroidered red-and-gold brocade cope, edged with a pattern of gray seraphim and wheels, over a white alb and amice. He holds his staff of office in one hand, and raises the other towards the Virgin.Blum (1992), 49 He bends his knees, honoring and acknowledging her as Mother of Christ and Queen of Heaven, and his feet are bare and positioned slightly behind hers.Blum (1992), 50 The Virgin is in a frontal view; directly behind her the red-curtained bed acts as a framing device, similar to the traditional canopy-of-honor or baldachin. Unlike Memling's predecessors whose Virgins are garbed in heavily jeweled and costly robes, the plain white shift she wears beneath a blue mantle is minimally jeweled at the hem and at the open neckline. A purple underdress peeks out at her neck and wrists, indicating her royal status.Blum (1992), 53 Mary seems neither surprised nor fearful at the announcement; according to Blum the scene is rendered with a great sense of naturalism and successfully depicts \\"the transformation of Mary from girl to God-bearer.\\" Jan van Eyck's Annunciation, from the 1432 Ghent Altarpiece, has an inscription streaming towards the Virgin and the dove of the Holy Spirit hovers above. The Virgin holds an innovative and unusual position. She seems to be either rising or swooning as if having lost her balance, a divergence from her conventional seated or kneeling pose. Blum believes \\"one may search in vain in other Netherlandish Annunciation panels of the fifteenth century of a Virgin positioned as she is here\\".Blum (1992), 43 Art historian Penny Jolly suggests the painting shows a birthing position, a motif van der Weyden experimented with in the Seven Sacraments Altarpiece, where the Virgin's collapse results in a childbirth-like posture, and with the Descent from the Cross, in which Mary Magdalen bends and crouches ‚Äì similar to the position Memling's Magdalen assumes in his Lamentation.Jolly (2014), 40, 57 Flanking the Virgin, and holding her, are two attendant angels. The one to the left lifts the Virgin's robe while the other gazes at the viewer, \\"soliciting our response\\", according to Ainsworth.Ainsworth (1998), 118 Both are small-statured, solemn, and according to Blum, in mood \\"comparable to that of Gabriel.\\"Blum (1992), 54 Other than the presence of the angels, Memling shows a typical upper-merchant- class 15th-century Flemish bedchamber. Objects A dove, representing the Holy Spirit hovers inside a rainbow-hued circle of light directly above the Virgin's head. Its placement and size is unusual for art of the period. It is unlike anything found in van der Weyden, and never repeated in Memling's work, but reminiscent of van Eyck's dove in the Ghent Altarpiece's Annunciation panel.Blum (1992), 49 Its shape is found in medallions hung above beds at that time, and thus seems in keeping with the domestic interior.Blum (1992), 52 Mary's left hand rests on an open prayer-book, which she has propped open on a prie-dieu, with the letter \\"D\\" visible ‚Äì perhaps for Deus tecum (\\"the Lord be with you\\"), according to Ainsworth. Blum speculates the passage is from Isaiah 7:14, \\"Behold a Virgin shall conceive and bear a son.\\" A vase containing white lilies and a single blue iris is next to it on the floor.Blum (1992), 48 A curtain sack, commonly found on beds of the period, hangs in the central axis between Gabriel and the attendant angel.Blum (1992), 44 A sideboard beside the bed contains two types of candles and a flask of water standing in bright light falling from the window to the left. The floor is multi-colored tile- work, similar to van der Weyden's Columba altarpiece; Memling truncates the ceiling rafters in the mid-ground, at the end of the bed, with the floor extending into the foreground. Blum describes the effect as acting \\"like an open stage for the holy figures\\".Blum (1992), 55 Iconography The iconography is not overly labored, and Memling avoids extraneous symbolism. Many elements emphasize Mary's role as the Mother of God; the chamber is furnished with simple everyday objects that indicate her purity. The vase of lilies and the items on the sideboard are objects 15th-century viewers would have associated with her.Howard (2000), 353 White lilies were often used to signify her purity, while irises or sword lilies were used as metaphors for her suffering. Memling emphasizes symbols associated with her womb and virginity, and \\"introduces two additional angelic priests, and floods the room with natural light, thereby rearranging the anecdotal to emphasize the doctrinal meaning.\\" Charles Sterling describes the work as \\"one of the finest examples of Memling's ability to take a pictorial convention inherited from his predecessors and infuse it with a heightened sense of emotion and narrative complexity.\\" Light Detail showing the light shining on the sideboard, a flask of clear water, a ropewick light, a candlestick, and a curtain-sack From the 9th century Light became associated with Mary and the Incarnation. Millard Meiss notes that, from the 12th century a common way to convey the conception was to compare light passing through glass to the passage of the Holy Spirit through the body of the Virgin.Meiss (1945), 177 St. Bernard likened it to sunshine explaining in this passage: \\"Just as the brilliance of the sun fills and penetrates a glass window without damaging it, and pierces its solid form with imperceptible subtlety, neither hurting when entering nor destroying when emerging; thus the word of God, the splendor of the Father, entered the virgin chamber and then came forth from the closed womb.\\"Meiss (1945), 176 Three objects on the bedside cabinet represent the Virgin's purity: the water flask, the candleholder, and the ropewick light. The light passing through the glass of the womb-shaped flask symbolizes her flesh, pierced by divine light, its clear and undisturbed water represents her purity at the moment of conception, a device found also in the earlier paintings as a metaphor of the Virgin's sanctity. The flask shows a reflection of the window's crossbar as a cross, a symbol of the Crucifixion, another small detail in which Memling \\"lays one translucent symbolic form upon another\\". Dieric Bouts' Annunciation, c. 1450s, Getty Center, Los Angeles, omits rays of light. Light represented by candles was then often used to symbolise the Virgin and Christ; both Campin and van Eyck placed hearths or candles in their annunciation scenes.Meiss (1945), 175 The candleholder without a candle and the ropewick without flame symbolize the world before Christ's Nativity and the presence of his divine light, according to Ainsworth. The challenge for painters of the Annunciation was how to visually represent the Incarnation, the Word made flesh, or Logos.Koslow (1989), 10 They often showed rays of light emanating from Gabriel or a nearby window entering Mary's body to depict the concept of Christ \\"who inhabited and passed through her body\\". The light rays might sometimes include an inscription,Blum (1992), 46 and were sometimes shown entering her ear, in the belief that it was thus the Word became flesh. Memling did not depict the light as distinct rays, nor had Dieric Bouts's Getty Annunciation. Yet the room is bright, filled with sunlight, a fenestra incarnationis, which would have been an adequate symbol for the contemporary viewer.Blum (1992), 47 By the mid-15th century the Virgin is found depicted in a room or chamber near an open window to permit the passage of light.Meiss (1945), 178 Memling's room, with its window through which light streams, is a most \\"decorous sign of Mary's chastity\\", according to Blum.Blum (1992), 47 There are no word scrolls or banderoles to indicate the Virgin's acceptance, yet her consent is obvious through her pose, which seems, according to Sterling, both submissive and active.Sterling (1998), 83 Mother of Christ The Boucicaut Master's \\"Visitation\\" (c. 1405) is a rare example of Mary with attendant angels who touch her garments The Virgin birth is indicated by the red bed and red womb- shaped curtain-sack. During the early-15th century hanging beds or curtain- sacks became symbols of the Incarnation, and \\"served to affirm [Christ's] humanity\\". Blum notes that at a time \\"when artists did not hesitate to depict the breast of the Virgin, Memling did not shun her womb\\". Christ's humanity was a source of fascination, and it was only in Netherlandish art that a solution was found for visualizing his embryonic state with curtain-sacks draped to suggest the shape of a womb.Koslow (1989), 11‚Äì12 Mary's body becomes the tabernacle holding the Host made flesh.Blum (1992), 49 She becomes an object of devotion, a \\"monstrance containing the Host\\". Her full belly and the presence of the dove indicate the moment of Incarnation has occurred. Viewers would have been reminded of the Crucifixion and Lamentation with the swoon, \\"thus anticipating Christ's sacrifice for the salvation of mankind at the moment of his conception.\\" According to theologians, Mary stood with dignity at the Crucifixion of Jesus, but in 15th-century art she is depicted swooning, according to Jolly, \\"in agony at the sight of her dying son ‚Ä¶ assuming the pose of a mother in the throes of the pain of childbirth\\". At the cross she felt the pain of his death; pain which at his birth she had not experienced. Stefan Lochner, The Virgin Crowned by Angels, c. 1450, Cleveland Museum of Art, depicts the Virgin as Queen of Heaven with two barely visible attendant angels hovering above her crown. The painting's domestic setting belies its liturgical meaning. The dove is a reminder of the Eucharist and Mass. Lotte Brand Philip observes how throughout the 15th century \\"eucharistic vessels made in the form of doves and suspended over altars ‚Ä¶ were lowered at the moment of transubstantiation\\"; here it suggests that in the same way the Holy Spirit gives life to the bread and wine, it gave life to the Virgin's womb. She carries the Body and Blood of Christ, and is attended by three priestly angels. Mary's function is to bear \\"the Savior of the World\\"; the angels' role is to \\"support, present and protect her sacred being\\". With the birth of Christ her \\"miraculous womb passed its final test\\" to become an object of veneration. Bride of Christ Memling presents the Virgin as the Bride of Christ about to assume her role as Queen of Heaven, with attendant angels indicating her royal status. These kind of angels are usually shown hovering above the Virgin, holding her crown, and some German painters showed them hovering close in Annunciation scenes, but angels rarely approach or touch the Virgin.Sterling (1998), 82 Only a single previous version of such attendant angels has been found: in the Boucicaut Master's early 15th-century illuminated manuscript version of the \\"Visitation\\", the pregnant Virgin's long mantle is held by attendant angels, about which Blum notes that \\"her queenly appearance surely commemorates the moment when Mary is first addressed as Theotokos, the Mother of the Lord.\\" Memling often depicted pairs of angels dressed in vestments attending the Virgin, but these two, dressed in simple amices and albs, were never repeated in his art. Their dual function is to \\"present the eucharistic offering and proclaim the Virgin bride and queen\\".Blum (1992), 53 Style and influence Clugny Annunciation c. 1465‚Äì75, Workshop of Rogier van der Weyden or by Hans Memling, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York The Annunciation draws heavily on van der Weyden's 1430s Louvre Annunciation, his c. 1455 Saint Columba altarpiece, and the Clugny Annunciation (c. 1465‚Äì75), which is attributed to either van der Weyden or Memling. Memling almost certainly was apprenticed to van der Weyden in Brussels until setting up his own workshop in Bruges sometime after 1465.Borchert (2008), 87 Memling's Annunciation is more innovative, with motifs such as the attendant angels that were absent in the earlier paintings. According to Till-Holger Borchert, not only was Memling familiar with van der Weyden's motifs and compositions, but he might have assisted with the underdrawing in van der Weyden's workshop. The shutters on the right are copied from the Louvre panel, the knotted curtain appears in the Columba triptych's \\"Annunciation\\". A sense of movement is conveyed throughout. The trailing edges of Gabriel's garment fall outside the pictorial space, indicating his arrival. The Virgin's \\"serpentine\\" pose, with attendant angels supporting her, adds to the sense of flow.Sterling (1998), 80 Memling's use of color achieves a startling effect. The traditional rays of light are replaced with light color indicators; the white clothes rendered in \\"icy\\" blue, the angel to the right in yellow patches seems \\"bleached by light\\", the left-hand angel appears to be steeped in shadow, dressed in clothes of lavender and bearing deep green wings. The effect is iridescent, according to Blum, who writes, \\"this shimmering surface gives [the figures] an unearthly quality, separating them from the more believable world of the bedchamber.\\"Blum (1992), 55 The effect deviates from the pure naturalism and realism which typifies Early Netherlandish art, causing a \\"startling\\" juxtaposition, an effect that is \\"unsteadying\\" and contradictory.Blum (1992), 56 Annunciation Triptych, Rogier van der Weyden, c. 1430s, Louvre, Paris Scholars have not established if the panel was meant to be a single devotional work, or part of a larger, and now broken up, polyptych. According to Ainsworth, its size and \\"the sacramental nature of its subject would have been appropriate for a family chapel in a church or monastery for the chapel of a guild corporation.\\" An intact, inscribed frame is unusual for a wing panel, indicating that it was probably intended as a single piece, but scholars are unsure because the slight left-to-right axis of the tiles tend to suggest it could have been the left-hand wing of a larger piece. There is no information about the panel's reverse, which has not survived. Technical analysis shows extensive underdrawing, typical for Memling. They were completed in a dry medium except for the dove and the flask and candles on the sideboard. Revisions during the final painting included the enlargement of the Virgin's sleeves and the repositioning of Gabriel's staff. Incisions were made to indicate the floor tiles and the dove's position.Sterling (1998), 78 The only person to question Gustav Friedrich Waagen's 1847 attribution to Memling is W. H. J. Weale, who in 1903 declared Memling \\"would never have dreamt of introducing into the representation of this mystery these two sentimental and affected angels.\\"Weale (1903), 35 Provenance and condition The painting's known provenance begins in the 1830s when it was in the possession of the Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç family. According to art historian Sulpiz Boisser√©e, who saw the painting in 1832, Antoni Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç found the painting in an estate his father owned. Waagen speculated that may have belonged to Mikolai Radziwill (1549‚Äì1616) who might have inherited it from his brother Jerzy Radziwill, (1556‚Äì1600), who was a cardinal.Sterling (1998), 84 The family kept it until 1920 when Princess Radziwill sold it to the Duveen Brothers in Paris. Philip Lehman bought it in October 1920; it is now held in the Robert Lehman collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in New York. Generally the condition is good. Memling painted the work on two panels of about 28 cm each. The dated and inscribed frame, probably the original, was discarded in 1830. There have been three documented restorations. The painting had been pierced by an arrow when Anton Radziwill found it; he had it restored and the damage repaired. At that time the Virgin's mantle and the flesh tones sustained heavy overpainting. The original frame was discarded, but its inscription was inserted into the new frame.Sterling (1998), 83 A description of the original frame suggests it carried a coat-of-arms, perhaps belonging to Jerzy Radziwill. The second restoration was after its exhibition in Bruges in 1902; and the third when Lehman had it restored and transferred to canvas sometime after 1928. The painting survived the transfer without significant damage. A late-19th century photograph shows wood on all four sides of the painted surface, which suggests the edges may have been extended during the transfer. Areas that suffered paint loss and overpainting are Gabriel's cope and the vase holding the flowers.Sterling (1998), 78 When Boisser√©e saw the painting he recorded the inscription's date as 1480. The last digit of the inscription was faded and difficult to read and had become illegible by 1899. Waagen suggested the date could have been 1482, and art historian Dirk de Vos suggested 1489. Memling's style does not lend itself well to assigning dates, making a determination difficult. According to Sterling, an earlier date is easily accepted, especially because of stylistic similarities to Memling's 1479 St John Altarpiece, whereas Ainsworth leans toward the later date as more in keeping with the mature style of the late 1480s.

Mendon√ßa was 11 years old and riding his bicycle outside near his home when he disappeared. The subsequent police investigation was criticized by both the media and by the missing boy's family. Mendon√ßa's whereabouts remain unknown, and he was declared legally dead in 2019. Last known activities On 4 March 1998, at around 2:00 PM, Mendon√ßa took his bicycle and cycled to his mother's workplace, located near the family home. He had asked his mother for permission to spend the afternoon riding in a car \\"with his friend Afonso\\" (Afonso Dias), a 22-year-old lorry driver. Mendon√ßa's mother denied the request, and told him to go play in an abandoned lot outside her office.  Investigation  Mendon√ßa's tutor called his parents because the child had not turned up for his 5:00 PM lesson, and they quickly initiated a search for him. Because Mendon√ßa had told his mother that he was planning to meet up with his friend Dias, the police sought him for questioning. Dias was in an emotional state while being questioned, and simply replied that he did not know the boy's whereabouts, but that the police \\"should close the borders\\". Mendon√ßa's cousin, Jo√£o Andr√© Mendon√ßa, recounted to the police that he, Mendon√ßa and Dias had had a conversation where Dias had invited them to go meet up with a prostitute. The cousin said he had not joined Mendon√ßa and Dias that afternoon because his mother would not let him leave the house.  Sightings  The investigation into the child's disappearance was slow to commence and soon slowed down further due to the lack of credible leads. Nevertheless, the case had sparked public interest to a degree that sightings of Mendon√ßa were numerous over the years since his disappearance. The prostitute, Alcina Dias, confirmed that Dias had taken Mendon√ßa to see her on the day he disappeared. Dias allegedly drove up to see her in his car and asked her if she was working. When she assented, he offered to pay her to have sex with Mendon√ßa. Alcina Dias said that Mendon√ßa was extremely nervous and crying by the time he exited the vehicle, reportedly saying that Dias had forced him to meet her. Alcina Dias added that she tried to calm the boy down and asked him if his mother knew he was there, to which the boy replied no. Mendon√ßa then allegedly drove off in Dias' vehicle. Alcina Dias allegedly tried to give her deposition to the authorities, but could never identify Dias by name. In 2011, she finally identified him in a court of law. In April 1998, the political commentator Nuno Rogeiro traveled to Disneyland Paris with his family. During the trip, the Rogeiro family snapped several photographs whilst on a ride; one of these photos depicts a boy sitting behind the family who reportedly looks remarkably like Mendon√ßa. Sitting next to the boy was a man in his 40s wearing a red jacket. The Portuguese police did confiscate the photographs for further analysis, but no further progress was made regarding this sighting. On 1 September 1998, 13 police forces raided alleged members of an international child pornography ring known as the Wonderland Club. The operation was code- named Operation Cathedral and resulted in the confiscation of 750,000 images and videos depicting 1,263 different children. Mendon√ßa was among the few children (16 only) that could be identified. However, his whereabouts remain unknown and police suspect that he was murdered by his abductors after being abused on camera for other members of the paedophile ring.  Media coverage  Mendon√ßa's disappearance was widely covered by the Portuguese media and the case's developments continue to make headlines.  Prison sentence for Dias  Dias was acquitted in the first trial in 2012 due to a lack of evidence, but was subsequently convicted in a new trial in 2014 to three years in jail for corruption of a minor, as a result of trying to make Mendon√ßa have sex, but not for his abduction or any other charge related to the disappearance itself. Following an appeal by Mendon√ßa's family. Despite Dias's appeal, this second ruling was upheld by the Supreme Court of Portugal. On 3 October 2014, Dias was sentenced to three years in prison. On 18 March 2015, Dias was taken to prison by his lawyer, after the warrant for his detention was issued by the police. He was released in March 2017, having served two thirds of his sentence, and continues to maintain his innocence in the matter.

It is a personal, poetic memoir of a deaf man who returns to the places where he found refuge as a Jewish boy during World War II. He finds his hiding places and bunkers still standing, bringing back horrific memories. The film emphasizes the role of Poles in saving persecuted Jews and indifference of the international community at large in the face of Nazi threats.  Story  Henryk Schoenker, a son of the last leader of the Jewish Community in O≈õwiƒôcim reveals to the world an unknown story of Jews\` legal opportunity to emigrate. Before the idea of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp was conceived, the Office for Jewish Immigration to Palestine was established in O≈õwiƒôcim in the fall of 1939. Leo Schoenker, the narrator's father, was tasked to set it up on order by the German military authorities. Thousands of people from all areas of Silesia began to arrive to the town of O≈õwiƒôcim in the hope of being saved from persecution. When the elder Schoenker was called to Berlin to report to Adolf Eichmann, he did it enthusiastically, presenting a matter-of-fact plan of international action. Unfortunately, the idea of the legal emigration came to nothing because of the world's indifference. Completely deaf since the war, Henryk Schoenker comes back to his family's ruined residence that still echoes those distant events. ‚ÄúThe horrible sounds of my childhood got inside me as if I were a seashell. Perhaps that is why I became deaf: so I would never forget them,‚Äù he says in the film, following the footsteps of his six-year wartime ordeal.

Historically significant places were able to give testimony to these past events before most of the buildings were destroyed a few months after the shooting of \\"The Touch of an Angel\\" was finished. In the documentary, professional actors and numerous residents of O≈õwiƒôcim play the real characters from the past. Because everyone had to resemble their wartime counterparts, casting took many months. The man performing the title Angel had to grow gray hair and a beard for a year, keeping the cause of the change of his appearance a secret from his family and friends. Birnbaum, a violin virtuoso, was played by a real violinist from O≈õwiƒôcim. Beyond their acting talents, the children had to display fortitude in extremely difficult weather conditions. In addition, the documentary introduces the ‚Äúarchicollage‚Äù (archive collage) style ‚Äì an original invention of the director Marek Tomasz Paw≈Çowski and the graphic designer Robert Manowski that is a new artistic means of recreating past events. It is also worth mentioning that cinematographer Jacek Januszyk shot the movie on a Red Epic camera, thus making ‚ÄúThe Touch of an Angel‚Äù the first Polish documentary made this way. The project was consulted by a historian, Zbigniew Sta≈Ñczyk.Zbigniew Sta≈Ñczyk about the Touch of an Angel project  Screenings   Film Festivals  * BIAF Festival Batumi * Chagrin Film Festival Ohio * Denver Film Festival * Polish Film Festival in America Chicago * Polish Film Festiwal Ann Arbor * Bilbao Film Festival * San Diego Jewish Film Festival * Miami Jewish Film Festival * Jewish Film Festival * Jewish Film Festival in Washington * Gdynia Film Festival  Special screenings  * Museum of Tolerance, Los Angeles * Museum of Holocaust, Los Angeles * Museum of Jewish Heritage, New York * International Public Television Screening Conference (INPUT), Tokyo  Critical response  Annette Insdorf from The Huffington Post, a film critic and great promoter of Polish cinema, was the first to present the documentary to the American audience. She pointed out the legitimacy of the use of the film's artistic, poetic language called by the director the archicollage.Annette Insdorf, New Documentaries Touch the Holocaust David Noh from Film Journal International writes that the up-close, personal approach of this Holocaust doc proves to be its very strength, through one man's harrowing yet inspiring reminiscences. This film, in the ocean of Holocaust-themed works, does really put the viewer in searing human contact with this greatest of tragedies and horrors. The movie was also commented in New York Times by Neil Genzlinger. He appreciates that the movie stands out from other documentaries about Holocaust survivors, thanks to re-enactments and manipulated still images that seek to make the narrative come alive. Genzlinger also praises the main character, Henryk Schoenker, for being an absorbing tour guide to his own life. Avi Offer of NYC Movie Guru gave The Touch of an Angel a very positive review. According to his critique, the film is emotionally resonating, gripping and vital and Henryk Schoenker is a coherent storyteller.

When Emma Swan discovers that a former friend from her past, Lily, is Maleficent's long lost daughter, she embarks on a quest to find her and bring her back to Storybrooke in order to reunite her with Maleficent, and Regina teams up with her in an effort to warn Robin Hood about Zelena, but the two are about to face what awaits them outside Storybrooke. Inside Storybrooke, Gold finds himself dealing with Belle, and back in Emma's past, her friendship with Lily after she is placed in a foster home could threaten their future. Plot Opening Sequence Emma Swan's Volkswagen is shown driving out of Storybrooke through the forest. In the Characters' Past =The Enchanted Forest= In the Enchanted Forest, the Apprentice starts consulting with the Sorcerer, who demands that the Author (Isaac) can never be allowed to change fate again, after he manipulated the apprentice into sending Maleficent's daughter, Lily, to the real world after transferring Emma's potential for darkness to the child. =The Land Without Magic= In 1999 Mankato, Minnesota, the teenage Emma is grabbing a sleeping bag from the garage for a camping trip, when she finds her friend Lily hiding, saying that she's in big trouble. Lily then invokes the \\"friends forever\\" clause to get Emma's help. Before she can decline or accept, Emma's foster father appears and invites Lily to stay for dinner, but when Emma's father brings up the subject of how they met, Lily lies by saying that they knew each other through foster care. Emma pulls Lily aside afterwards and tells her she doesn't want to lie to her new family, only to see a news report on television about authorities searching for shoplifters, and Lily is among the suspects identified. The news has now made Emma furious and now wants Lily to leave immediately, but Lily says that she just can't help it because she always does \\"bad\\" things; she then begs Emma for help with just one more thing, which is to retrieve a special necklace. Later that night, Emma follows through with getting the necklace, but Lily pulls a fast one on Emma by stealing money from Emma's parents and runs away. When Emma returned home, Emma's parents surprised her, having called her social worker, and discovering that Lily is a known criminal. The parents are now upset with Emma for not telling them and allowing such a person into their home; the actions would result in Emma's foster father saying something so cruel and disowning that it makes Emma grab her things and leave the house in sadness. Later that night, Lily catches up with a now furious Emma at a bus stop, Emma throws Lily's necklace at her and tells her to go away, now extremely cross at her for ruining her chance to have a family. But Lily claims that no matter what she does, everything goes wrong and adding that her \\"whole life is darkness,\\" but when Emma is around it gets brighter. Lily then begs Emma to stay in her life and help, but a bitter Emma leaves, saying she is better off alone and that she's done helping her. Lily's future would later come to light as Lily unknowingly sits next to the Apprentice on the bus after she boards, where he starts to tell Lily that he knows everything about her and can explain why her life is so miserable. He believes he owes the truth to her. In Storybrooke It has been several days since Cruella's death as Isaac and Gold mourn her passing, but Gold is quick to point out that the time has come to start moving on to their next plot. Meanwhile, at the diner, Emma wonders how they will stop Gold now that her heart is starting to change, when all of a sudden Maleficent shows up and says that she is offering her help, now that they all have a common enemy in Gold. Maleficent tells Emma about her daughter, who is alive and named Lily, which prompts Emma to race off towards the library after she hears the name. Emma immediately does some research and uncovers the truth that the woman, Lilith \\"Lily\\" Page, is not only Maleficent's daughter, but was once the childhood friend of Emma, who also discovers that fate has controlled her life down to the finest detail, which includes influencing the one friend she ever had. Regina then suggests that it is time to turn the tables on fate, and proposes that the two travel to New York together, giving them the opportunity to help each other, with Regina hoping to warn Robin Hood about Zelena, while Emma hopes to find and reunite with Lily in order to redeem her parents. As they prepare to leave Storybrooke, Emma and Regina say their goodbyes to everyone, though Emma is still mad at Mary Margaret and David for lying to her. With Emma and Regina out of town, Gold finds the opportunity to find Belle's heart, as it can not leave town. He finds Will after finishing his date with Belle, and tells him that Regina took her heart and then threatens Will by demanding that he help him steal it back from Regina's office. Meanwhile, Mary Margaret and David visit Maleficent and ask for her forgiveness, but she responds to the couple that the real person they need to seek forgiveness from is Lily, since Maleficent has made it clear that she will never forgive them. Hours later, Gold puts his next plan into motion as he seeks out Maleficent in pursuit of Belle's heart, but Maleficent has decided not to be part of his plot upon visiting the Mayor's office as Regina has placed a protection spell so he can't enter the office, but Gold used the distraction to allow Will to sneak in through the window and retrieve Belle's heart. After Gold leaves, Maleficent immediately texts Regina. As Will brings Belle's heart back to her, he finally gets her attention as Gold enters the room to explain that he must stop hurting her as his heart has grown blacker and learns that he will die faster if he does not stop. Gold then restores the heart back into Belle, and as he leaves, essentially gives Will his blessing with Belle. As Gold walked out of the store, Will grabs Belle's hand but she takes it away while staring at door, seemingly showing signs that she wanted to go after him. In the Land Without Magic As Emma and Regina arrive in Lowell, Massachusetts, the two visit an apartment that was the most recent address that Lily once lived at, but the landlord who heard them knock on her door says she died in a car crash and adds insult to their injury by claiming that no one really misses her. Sensing that he is lying, Emma starts to snap and prepares to attack him, but Regina barely holds her back from doing so. Hours later, Emma and Regina are back on the road, when they spot a wolf in the middle of the road and just like Emma's first arrival in Storybrooke is run off the highway and it blows a tire. Emma is now convinced that this is happening all over again, only to have Regina telling Emma that she's putting too much faith in fate. Moments later, Emma and Regina stop to get a meal at diner nearby, and in a surprise shocking twist Emma quickly identifies a waitress named \\"Starla\\" as her long lost friend, Lily. Emma and Lily begin to confront each other outside of the diner. Lily is stunned that Emma would track her down based on the birthmark on her wrist as proof, even as Emma tries to explain that there's a higher force at power here that has kept them in each other's lives and forced Lily's many bad decisions. Lily then tells Emma that she does not believe her and refuses her offer to help. She also tells Emma that she is married and has a daughter, only to walk over to the young girl who just got off a school bus and asks her to pretend to be her daughter in exchange for a free week of burgers. This leads Emma to be suspicious of Lily and follow her to her home, where they find a wall filled with newspaper clippings and clues about Storybrooke; it turns out that Lily knows everything about its existence, and is plotting revenge on the people responsible. The two then hear a car burning rubber (Emma's VW) and leaving the place. They believe Lily is ready to carry out her plot as the Snow Queen's scroll is inside, so Emma finds a monkey wrench, then smashes the window of another vehicle and the ladies race off after Lily until they catch up with her and corner her. When Lily threatens Emma by vowing to kill Mary Margaret and David, she and Emma start fighting (causing the skies to darken and an electrical strike that takes out the headlights on Emma's car) until Emma ultimately starts pointing a gun at Lily, who dares her to shoot, since all she ever does is ruin things anyway and adds that decisions are inherently part of her. Realizing that killing Lily would become a major line that would draw Emma into darkness, Regina tells her to lower the gun and Emma does just that. With the hatchet now buried, Lily joins Emma and Regina and they race their way towards New York City to warn Robin Hood, as Regina has now learned that the leverage she has over Gold, Belle's heart, has been restored back in Belle by Gold, putting Robin in more danger. As they reach the apartment, Regina tells Robin the truth about Zelena pretending to be Marian but Robin doesn't believe her, until \\"Marian\\" shows up. Regina attempts to expose her but Robin still doesn't believe her and shouts at her, telling her, he's moved on. \\"Marian\\" eventually reveals to everyone by transforming herself back to Zelena, shocking Robin, who suddenly shocks Regina, Emma and Lily with another surprise: Zelena is now pregnant with his child. Reception Ratings The episode increased from the previous two episodes, as it posted a 1.7/5 among 18-49s with 5.21 million viewers tuning in, retaining its lead among scripted programs in the 8 p.m. timeslot but was tied in terms of rating numbers with Secrets & Lies, which followed this show in the 9 p.m. slot.\\"TV Ratings Sunday: 'Secrets and Lies' Hits High, 'Brooklyn Nine-Nine' Returns Up, 'Once Upon A Time', 'Last Man on Earth' & 'Revenge' Flat, 'Madam Secretary' Falls\\" from TV By The Numbers/Zap2It (April 27, 2015) Reviews The episode was met with mixed to positive reviews. Hilary Busis of Entertainment Weekly noted \\"It's a good thing ‚ÄúLily‚Äù ended with something of a bombshell‚Äîbecause otherwise, tonight's highly anticipated installment felt like a bit of an anticlimax. For any other show, an episode that has a plot you can easily explain in a sentence (Emma and Regina leave Storybrooke to track down Maleficent's daughter; they do) wouldn't necessarily be cause for concern. On Once, though‚Äîwhich is at its best when it's being crazy-go-nuts- bonkers‚Äîthese sorts of hours tend to land with a whimper rather than a bang.\\"\\"Once Upon a Time recap: 'Lily'\\" from Entertainment Weekly (April 26, 2015) Amy Ratcliffe of IGN said of the episode, \\"The search for Lily and the memories it brought to the surface didn't make for a stirring or emotional episode. Regina serving as Emma's life coach kept the primary plot afloat, but overall, Emma is going dark side too quickly. The build should be more gradual. Also, Emma really needs to stop saying that she knows when people are lying.\\" Ratcliffe gave the episode a 6.5 rating out of 10. In a review from Rickey.org, Nick Roman cites \\"‚ÄúLily‚Äù suggests nature and nurture go hand in hand, and the result is an engrossing episode.\\"\\"‚ÄòOnce Upon A Time‚Äô Review: Its Nature Vs Nurture In The Engrossing 'Lily'\\" from Rickey.org (April 26, 2015) References External links 2015 American television episodes Once Upon a Time (season 4) episodes ","title":"Lily (Once Upon a Time)"},{"id":"46457316","text":"Asp Lake is a lake in Chisago County, Minnesota, in the United States.

Mount Izumi Katsuragi has been known as the heart of the Katsuragi Mountains since ancient times.

Harvesting the trees in this wood is forbidden by the association of Hachidairy≈´≈ç shrines and temples, and this is the southernmost stand of Japanese beech on Honsh≈´. The trees in the area were designated a national protected species in 1923, allowing them to continue to thrive in an area very close to suburban and urban growth. Access and amenities Mount Izumi Katsuragi is easily accessible by car from three different directions, with all three roads meeting near the summit. There is also a Nankai Wing Bus which travels between the bus stop at Kishiwada Station and the Ushitakiyama (ÁâõÊªùÂ±±) bus stop near the base of the mountain.

He inherited the paper from his father, Edwin Grozier. While he was acting publisher in 1920, The Boston Post received one of the first Pulitzer prizes for exposing Charles Ponzi as a fraud. Early life Grozier was born in Brooklyn to Edwin and Alice Grozier.(20 June 1946).Richard Grozier, 59, Head of Boston Post, The New York Times The family moved to Boston in 1891, soon after his father bought the Post. The younger Grozier graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy in 1905, and from Harvard College in 1909. However, he was an indifferent student; he barely maintained a C at Exeter and was \\"separated\\" (flunked out) from Harvard three times. He immediately began working for his father's paper, eventually rising to assistant publisher and assistant editor. However, he was given few opportunities to prove himself until his father suffered a total physical breakdown in the spring of 1920. With his managing editor on summer vacation, Richard became operating head of the Post as acting publisher and editor. Exposing Ponzi Soon afterward, Charles Ponzi set up his Securities Exchange Company a few blocks from the Post's headquarters. Grozier was very skeptical of Ponzi's claim to double his investors' money in 45 days. At that time, there were about seven respectable newspapers in Boston, but none of them had written about Ponzi's postal reply coupon scheme in detail. Six weeks earlier, The Boston Traveller had written about the Ponzi operation without naming him. Another story three weeks earlier in the Post had described a million-dollar lawsuit against Ponzi by a furniture dealer, but this actually burnished Ponzi's reputation as a wealthy person. Grozier felt this was an opportunity for him to investigate Ponzi and make his mark in the field of respectable media. Grozier assigned several investigative reporters to check Ponzi out. He got in touch with Clarence Barron, the noted financial journalist, who expressed doubts that Ponzi's operation could possibly be legitimate. The Post published its first story on Ponzi on its front page on July 24, 1920, describing the Ponzis' luxurious locomobile limousine and its Irish immigrant chauffeur John Collins. The story was more or less positive and resulted in further investors rushing to Ponzi's office to invest money. However, Barron was still skeptical, and started to co-author articles for the Post as a consultant. The first of these appeared on July 26, as the Post subsequently began running several articles that questioned whether Ponzi was on the level. The articles caused a panic run on Ponzi's company. Later that month, former Post reporter William McMasters, now serving as Ponzi's publicity man, came to Grozier with what he claimed was hard proof that Ponzi was generating his \\"returns\\" by paying new investors with old investors' money. On August 2, the Post published an article by McMasters declaring Ponzi \\"hopelessly insolvent,\\" triggering yet another run. A week later, with federal and state investigators closing in on Ponzi, the Post ran an article detailing his conviction for forgery in Montreal 13 years earlier, as well as his role in a scandal-plagued Montreal bank. Ponzi surrendered a day later. The Post was rewarded for its role in exposing Ponzi's fraud with the 1921 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service‚Äîthe first time a Boston paper had ever won a Pulitzer, and the only time that a Boston paper would win the Public Service prize until 2003. Grozier initially claimed he was acting on instructions from his father, but Edwin wrote a signed editorial for the June 2 edition which stated that his son had been in complete control of the paper for the entire time. Later life Edwin would never recover from the breakdown he suffered in 1920. As a result, Richard remained in day-to-day control of the Post for the next four years, and inherited the paper upon his father's death in 1924. Within five years, he had doubled the Post's circulation to 600,000 copies per day. In 1929, he married his secretary, Margaret \\"Peggy\\" Murphy. However, Peggy died in 1933 in childbirth. While he remarried Helen Doherty in 1934, Richard never really recovered emotionally. His depression eventually became so deep that his family committed him to McLean Hospital. He died there on June 19, 1946, of a heart attack, survived by his wife and four children.

It was mounted on aircraft and was later used as an anti-aircraft gun. However, it was too heavy to be used as am infantry support weapon. It employed a closed bolt system. Some guns had the ability to bolt a large box onto the bottom of the machine gun to hold the ammunition belt. Two versions of the gun existed, the \\"normal\\" version and a second version which bolted two guns together and made them to fire from the same trigger, known as the \\"Doppel-MG\\" (double machine gun).

Pitre Jr. (born December 1961) is a lawyer in New Orleans, Louisiana, who focuses his work on project development, construction, and operations in the Louisiana coastal zone. His law practice concentrates on the most challenging aspects of doing business in and protecting the vulnerable environment of Louisiana‚Äôs working coast, including entity formation and governance, complex land rights issues, construction procurement and management, environmental and coastal permitting issues, and dispute resolution. He was educated at Harvard University (A.B. magna cum laude, 1983) and Harvard Law School (J.D., 1986). He is Partner in Charge of Kelly Hart Pitre, the Louisiana offices of the Kelly Hart law firm. In addition to his legal practice, Pitre is a part-time faculty member at the Tulane University School of Law in New Orleans. He has extensive legal publications. Pitre is a former member of the Louisiana House of Representatives for District 54 in his native Lafourche Parish, with one precinct as well in Jefferson Parish, in the southern portion of his state. He has represented oil and gas and other industrial companies, real estate developers, financial institutions, ports, levee districts and other public entities, and players in the construction and service industries such as contractors, engineers, and material suppliers. While serving as a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives from 2000 to 2008, he was intimately involved in the development of the state‚Äôs coastal restoration and protection program and large transportation infrastructure projects such as the elevated highway to Port Fourchon. He has carried that knowledge and experience into his law practice. Mr. Pitre has wide experience with the major federal environmental statutes, and in particular the Coastal Zone Management Act, the Clean Water Act, the Rivers and Harbors Act, the Oil Pollution Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, the Clean Air Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, and their Louisiana counterparts. Mr. Pitre is very familiar with the Louisiana law concerning public and private finance, procurement, and contracting. His experience includes traditional finance and procurement methods for both public and private projects, such as bidding and requests for proposals, as well as more innovative methods such as public private partnerships, securitization, and toll bonds. He is ranked in Chambers, BestLawyers, and SuperLawyers, and is a frequent speaker and writer. He is an experienced negotiator and is trained in both arbitration and mediation. He teaches International Oil & Gas Law as an Adjunct Assistant Professor of Law at Tulane Law School. Mr. Pitre is also extremely well known for his practice in legacy litigation in which landowners and public entities sue oil and gas companies alleging environmental damage from oil and gas exploration and production operations. These cases often involve claims in the hundreds of millions of dollars. As lead trial counsel in Meaux et al. v. Hilcorp et al., he defended two oil and gas exploration and production companies from claims of environmental damage. After a three-week trial, plaintiffs asked the jury for over $60 million dollars. Instead, the jury‚Äôs verdict resulted in no liability for defendants, a result that withstood appeal. Mr. Pitre grew up in Cut Off in southern Lafourche Parish, Louisiana, which has grown in the past century from a collection of small Cajun French fishing villages to the central hub of the Gulf of Mexico deepwater oil and gas industry at Port Fourchon. Thus, from an early age he has understood the intricate challenges of living and working on the Louisiana coast. At South Lafourche High School, Mr. Pitre was a National Merit Scholar, a Presidential Scholar (one of 121 nationwide), and a Telluride Association Summer Program Scholar (one of 20 nationwide). He then spent seven years at Harvard, where he earned his bachelor and law degrees and numerous honors. He wrote his Harvard College magna cum laude honors thesis about a 19th century village on the Louisiana coast and his Harvard Law School senior paper about aspects of the Louisiana Constitution. He then returned to Louisiana, ultimately serving his home town as attorney to the Greater Lafourche Port Commission during a period of explosive expansion and as a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives. Background Pitre is the youngest of four sons born in Cut Off on Bayou Lafourche in Lafourche Parish, to Loulan Pitre Sr. (1921‚Äì2010), and the former Emelia Chabert (born 1925). The senior Pitre fought in many Pacific battles in World War II, including Iwo Jima. He was present too at the V-J Day Japanese surrender. He was a fisherman and boat captain but relished his other roles as an actor and a debater who went out of his way to stir up controversy. He even gave acting tips to Robert Duvall in the 1986 film, Belizaire the Cajun, in which Duval played a preacher and Pitre a sheriff. The picture was written and directed by Glen Pitre, the son of Loulan Sr., and an older brother of Loulan Jr. Loulan's other two brothers, Holland and Wayne, are physicians who specialized in dermatology. Loulan Pitre Jr. attended the highly selective Telluride Association Summer Program in 1978 and was selected as a Presidential Scholar in 1979, one of 121 nationwide. He was also a National Merit Scholar and is an Eagle Scout. He graduated from South Lafourche High School in 1979. Pitre Jr. was educated at both Harvard University (A.B. magna cum laude, 1983) and Harvard Law School (J.D., 1986) in Cambridge, Massachusetts. At Harvard College, Pitre served as Co-Chair of Dunster House's House Committee, its student governing body. While in law school, Pitre was selected for a judicial clerkship on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit by the late Judge Albert Tate Jr., but Judge Tate died before the term of the clerkship. Pitre's Harvard Law School classmates elected him permanent Class Secretary, and he gave the Class Address at Commencement. He has served on the Board of Directors of the Harvard Alumni Association and as President of the Harvard Club of Louisiana. Legislative elections Pitre served in the Louisiana House of Representatives during the second administration of Republican Governor Murphy J. Foster Jr., and the following term of Democrat Kathleen Blanco. His policy focus was coastal protection and restoration and related infrastructure issues. He was elected to the House in the nonpartisan blanket primary held on October 23, 1999, when he narrowly unseated the Democratic incumbent Mitch Theriot, who later switched to the Republican Party. Pitre polled 7,187 votes (51.5 percent) to Theriot's 6,768 (48.5 percent). In 2003, Pitre again defeated Theriot by nearly the same totals as he had in 1999, 7,618 (52 percent) to 7,035 (48 percent). Pitre declined to seek a third term in 2007, and Democrat Jerry \\"Truck\\" Gisclair of Larose, a businessman and radio station broadcaster, defeated Theriot, who ran as a Republican, by 121 votes in still another narrow race in the highly competitive district. As Pitre completed his eight years in the legislature, the Governor-Elect appointed Loulan as Chair of the Transition Advisory Group on Coastal Restoration and Flood Control. Shortly after Pitre left the state House in 2008, he changed his voter registration to Independent.

Zaleski was born on April 17, 1906 in unknown location in Ukraine. He studied at Lwow University and Jagiellonian University, graduating in 1928. In 1931, at the age of 25, he was awarded the doctorate in law, and his field of expertise was economy. Zaleski wrote a number of articles about economy and society, his works were featured mostly in nationalistic press. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, he was an active member of the National Party (Poland). Disappointed with the party policies, on April 14, 1934, he co-founded the National Radical Camp (1934) (ONR), signing the historic Declaration of the ONR. Since Zaleski was a renowned figure among Polish nationalists, he created economic program of the ONR. In 1937, he issued a manifesto ‚ÄúPoland Without Proletariat‚Äù, in which he wrote about the ‚Äúthird way‚Äù, beyond Capitalism and Communism. In 1938, he was named editor in chief of the popular right-wing daily ABC. After the Invasion of Poland Zaleski was actively involved in the Polish resistance. He joined the radical organization Pobudka (Awakening), which in 1940 merged with some other groups, creating Konfederacja Narodu (KN). Using nom de guerre Szarecki, he was one of leaders of the KN, responsible for propaganda. At the same time, he wrote for Polish underground press, publishing in 1942 a brochure ‚ÄúEconomic Strength of New Poland‚Äù . In final months of World War II, Zaleski escaped from Poland, avoiding possible NKVD arrest. In 1946, he became economic history lecturer at the UNRRA University in Munich, also publishing his own monthly Universum. In 1949, he wrote a book ‚ÄúMarshall Plan in the Economy of the Two Continents‚Äù, and in 1951 moved to Paris, where he was employed by the Economic Cooperation Administration. Zaleski remained a very active person: he was a member of the Centre of Research on Central Europe, and in 1952 wrote another book ‚ÄúThe Party System‚Äù. In 1954, Zaleski began cooperating with Polish language department of Radio Madrid. At the same time, he continued writing for several publications, such as Kultura, Horyzonty, Estudios Sobre el Communismo and Orientale Europea.

Dundee is located within the Wichita Falls Metropolitan Statistical Area. Description Several families were already living in the area when the town was laid out on the T Fork Ranch between 1886 and 1890. In 1890 the Wichita Valley Railway Company established a line between Wichita Falls and Seymour and constructed a three-story hotel at the station the railroad's president is said to have named for Dundee, Scotland. That year Amanda Giddens built the first post office and became postmistress. A school had begun by 1891, and in 1892 the town was described as a post office and station on the railway with a population of twenty-five. The railroad brought in more settlers. By 1896 the population was estimated at 199, and Dundee had two livestock dealers, a clothier, a general store, a hardware store, a seller of notions, and a Mr. Biffle who sold organs. The Methodists and Presbyterians organized in the late 1890s, and the Baptists in the early 1900s. Dundee prospered and became for a time the second largest town in Archer County. In 1909 a bank was established with Alex Albright as president. Albright later became well known as the owner of \\"probably the largest Karakul sheep ranch in the world,\\" just outside Dundee. By 1919 the town had added some businesses, and the population was about 165. In the 1920s the population was estimated at 400. The oldest of the county's federated study clubs was founded there in 1921. Lake Kemp was built during the 1920s fifteen miles west and Diversion Lake four miles north, as well as an irrigation system for the northern part of the county. Diversion Lake provided both irrigation and the site for a 141-acre fish hatchery, which was still in operation in 1990. In 1929 a tornado crippled Dundee, which rebuilt most of its businesses, but with the Great Depression the town's growth was halted. The bank closed in 1933. The number of businesses dropped from ten in 1940 to five in 1946. By 1953 Dundee had an estimated population of 300 and three businesses. In the mid-1960s the population was seventy-five; by 1970 it was forty, and the town had lost its post office. In 1980 Dundee had no businesses, although the railroad still ran through and the population was forty. In 1990 the population was still forty, but dropped to twelve by 2010.

Some of the tools available in the ETC studio included the \\"Jones colorizer\\" (1974, 1975), the \\"Jones 8-input sequencer\\" (1984, 1985), the \\"Jones keyer\\" (1985), the \\"Jones buffer\\" (1986), the \\"Voltage control\\", and the \\"Raster manipulation unit‚Äìwobbulator\\". In mid- 1970s, the center started to research the interface of an \\"LSI-11 computer\\" with a video processing system with the collaboration of Steina and Woody Vasulka and the support of National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). by Internet Archive on 27 March 2015. Its purpose was to make a digital imaging system more user-friendly to the artists. In the late of 1970s and the beginning of 1980s, the ETC‚Äôs research programs shifted from the hardware building to artist-oriented software development and to completing new and old tools and systems. by Internet Archive on 9 December 2013. From the beginning of the 1980s, the center‚Äôs interest transitioned to the new \\"Amiga computer\\". Subsequently, in the 1990s, the available image processing system was enriched by commercially available tools. According to Ralph and Sherry Miller Hocking, the image processing system became through the years ‚Äúa hybrid tool set, permitting the artist to create interactive relationships between older historically analog instruments and new digital technologies‚Äù. In addition, at the beginning of the 1990s, using a computerized relational database, the center started to catalog the antique equipment, all the video and audio tapes and also the printed material.

Vazquez grew up just outside the city of Monterrey to a doctor and an engineer. He began studying the piano at age six, but his parents did not realize the extent of his talent until he won his first competition at the age of twelve. Vazquez did his professional studies at the Escuela Superior de M√∫sica y Dance de Monterrey, and after receiving a scholarship, went on to the Manhattan School of Music, then studied privately in Madrid. He currently lives in New York, working as a vocal coach with Metropolitan Opera House and Juilliard School. In 2006, he won the Angelica Morales-Yamaha National Piano Competition, his debut at the Palacio de Bellas Artes, and in 2013 he won Shining Stars Debut Series, his debut at Carnegie Hall. Life Abdiel Vazquez (full name Abdiel Antonio V√°zquez Fortozo) was born in Monterrey, in 1984, and grew up in the small suburb down of Guadalupe, one of the three children of Oscar Vazquez, an engineer and Diana Fortozo. His grandfather was a laborer, but his father was able to put himself through school working in Monterrey's steel industry. His middle-class upbringing allowed for musical studies for all of the children but only Abdiel has made it a profession. When he was little, he always tried to look taller in order to play with the older children in the park, according to his father. Vazquez began taking piano lessons at age six with Myrna Trevi√±o. His father stated that the family knew he could play well, but did not understand the extent of his talent until he won his first piano competition, the Sala Beethoven, when Vazquez was 12. Vazquez's professional studies were at the Escuela Superior de M√∫sica y Dance de Monterrey, with primary instructor Gerardo Gonzalez. For his final exam, Vazquez chose a piece that his instructor told him would take year to prepare for. His talent began to be recognized even while in school, with several awards and finally a scholarship from the Fondo Nacional para la Cultura y las Artes. Vazquez moved on to New York to study at the Manhattan School of Music, under James Tocco. He furthered his studied for eight months in Madrid in 2012 with Oxana Yablanskaia of the Tchaikovsky Conservatory in Moscow and the Juilliard School. In 2009, he founded the Juventud Sinf√≥nica de Monterrey (Monterrey Symphony Youth), to support young musicians in his hometown and remains its founding director. This program has graduated over sixty former members who now play in various parts of Mexico. When not on the road, Vazquez lives in New York, where he is a vocal coach at the Manhattan School of Music, working with singers from the Metropolitan Opera House and Juilliard School. He also founded the Little Chopins piano school for children there. He practices on average between seven and eight hours a day including weekends, with a minimum of two. Vazquez has a history of playing benefit concerts starting while he was still in school. He particularly supports the families of miners in his home state of Nuevo Leon, through a charity set up for the families of more than 65 miners killed and injured in an accident at a Monterrey area mine, with the last benefit concert in 2013. He has also played for charity, such as a benefit for the workers of a mine in Nuevo Leon, where an accident took the lives of 65 workers in 2013. Vazquez is a fan of Romantic literature and of writers such as Victor Hugo, Goethe and Shakespeare. He believes that reading does not directly affect playing, but does enrich the person who plays. Performances Vazquez made his debut as a soloist with the National Symphony Orchestra of Mexico at the Palacio de Bellas Artes when he was 21 years old. Since then he has appeared regularly with all of Mexico's major orchestras, such as Mexico State Symphonic Orchestra, the Mexico City Philharmonic, Jalisco Philharmonic Orquestra, the Carlos Ch√°vez Symphonic Orchestra, the Quer√©taro Philharmonic, the Aguascalientes Philharmonic, the Sinaloa Symphonic Orchestra, the Yucat√°n Symphonic Orchestra, the symphonic orchestras of the universities of Nuevo Le√≥n and Tamaulipas. He has performed at the Palacio de Bellas Artes since his debut, and appeared at the Festival Internacional Cervantino twice (2010 and 2014). He has also performed solo at the International Youth Symphonic Festival. Outside of Mexico, Vazquez has performed in the United States, South America and Europe. He made his debut in the United States with the Youth Orchestras of San Antonio and in South America with the National Symphony of Peru and in Europe with the Mihail Jor√° Philharmonic Orchestra in Bacau, Romania.

He debuted with the Louisiana Philharmonic Orchestra during their 2014-2015 season. In 2015, he held a private recital with soprano Maria Katzarava at Guildhall in London for that city's mayor and the president of Mexico. Awards Even before finishing his conservatory studies, Vazquez had won a number of awards for his artistry, including the Nuevo Leon State Youth Award (2004), the National Youth Award from the Mexican president Vicente Fox (2006), the Medalla al M√©rito Ciudadano (Civic Merit Medal, 2007) . His first win at a major competition was the 2006, Angelica Morales-Yamaha National Piano Competition, playing Rachmaninoff's Third Piano Concerto. In 2010, he won the Jos√© Jacinto Cuevas National Piano Competition, and placed third at the Manuel M. Ponce International Competition.

That same year he won his first major international competition, the Shining Stars Debut Series, which was also his debut at Carnegie Hall in New York, playing Manuel Ponce‚Äôs Piano Concerto. Artistry Influences on Vazquez's development include Gerardo Gonz√°lez, James Tocco, and Oxana Yablonskaya; the conductor David Gilbert, and the mezzo-soprano Mignon Dunn. He says that his favorite composer is who he happens to be playing at the moment, and his repertoire includes works by Beethoven, Grieg, Saint- Saens, Tchaikovsky, Prokofiev, Ravel, Poulenc, Gershwin, Barber, Castro, and Ponce, but works by Franz Liszt and Sergei Rachmaninoff are particularly common.

The film was produced by Arbella Studios and Pine Creek Entertainment, and distributed by Fathom Events. The film had a cumulative worldwide gross of $3,300,000. Since the establishment of the drop box outside the Jusarang Community Church, hundreds of abandoned children have been received and adopted in Seoul, South Korea.  Synopsis  Every year, hundreds of babies are abandoned in Seoul, South Korea. Pastor Lee Jong Rak and his wife, Chun-ja, created the first \\"drop box\\" for abandoned children in South Korea outside the Jusarang (\\"God's Love\\") Community Church. The drop box was modeled off the baby hatch, or baby box. This is a sanctuary for babies who are abandoned by their mothers due to difficult circumstances. Available at all hours, the drop box is equipped with a motion sensor, heat, and light, and is programmed to notify the pastor when a baby is placed inside. The sign placed outside the baby box roughly translates to \\"place to leave babies.\\" While the documentary was filmed, Pastor Lee and Chun-ja were legal guardians of 19 children, two of them biological. Since the establishment of the drop box in 2009, over 600 abandoned children have been received in the drop box and placed in safe, loving homes. The documentary raises awareness about the difficulty of addressing the child abandonment issue in South Korea because of the unfortunate circumstances that often force parents to feel helpless and feel they have no other option but to abandon their children. Several reasons for abandonment that were mentioned in The Drop Box include family pressure, lack of governmental assistance, financial issues, and social stigma against young, single mothers. It is also seen that many of the children that are under their care at the Jusarang Community Church have mental and physical disabilities. Even today, disabled or handicapped people face prejudice and social stigma, and parents often feel they are not able to adequately care for children with special needs. Pastor Lee's dedication for his children and his church are seen in The Drop Box, and his efforts were received by the public. After the release of The Drop Box, donations to the Jusarang Community Church and adoption agencies in South Korea allowed Pastor Lee and the children under his care to relocate to a much needed larger space. The former Jusarang Community Church was converted into a maternity shelter for mothers in crisis.  Production  In 2011, writer and director of the documentary, Brian Ivie, contacted pastor Lee Jong Rak. Brian Ivie had heard about Pastor Lee's work from the Los Angeles Times article \\"South Korean pastor tends to an unwanted flock.\\" After six months of correspondence and preparation, Brian Ivie and a production team at Arbella Studios began to film. The production of The Drop Box took two years.  Themes  Sacrifice, hope, guilt, courage, and unconditional love are themes that resound through the documentary. The Drop Box takes a pro-life, or anti-abortion, stance, although its content does not explicitly mention pro-life or abortion topics. Rather, it emphasizes this stance by emphasizing the value of every child's life that Pastor Lee receives in the drop box.  Reception  The Drop Box was released on March 3, 2015 in a limited theatrical release and garnered close to a quarter million views and public interest. The Drop Box was played in over 700 theaters in the United States. Many viewers of this documentary were inspired to contact Kindred Image, which is a nonprofit organization that is dedicated to ending child abandonment and creating a culture that celebrates life in South Korea. Kindred Image focuses its efforts on long-term solutions. Some projects that have been undertaken include care packages, counseling, and adoption support. Kindred Image also provides expecting mothers with necessary resources for healthy and successful pre- and post-pregnancy. Through the efforts of this organization, over 1.4 million dollars have been raised for Korean orphans and foster care in America. The organization hopes to address the issue of child abandonment.  Public Health impact  Every year, hundreds of infants are abandoned in the Seoul, South Korea. Pastor Lee's drop box provides a safe location for children to be placed if parents feel they are unable to care for their child, and wish to give them the opportunity to be adopted. Pastor Lee's work also raises awareness of South Korea's Special Adoption Law, which if revised and addressed, could alleviate the child abandonment crisis. The director, Brian Ivie, was critical in the creation of Kindred Image, a nonprofit organization that addresses child abandonment issues with holistic solutions. Part of the proceeds from The Drop Box are received by Lee Jong Rak and his ministry to support his children. Paul Boge, Winnipeg Film Director and director of Reel to Reel Film Festival, says that, \\"we all lead busy lives and it is not possible for us to do research on every social issue. Documentaries like these give us a chance to understand issues that impact us and the world around us so we can be better informed about our responsibility in responding to these issues.\\"  References   External links   2015 films 2015 documentary films American documentary films American films English-language films ","title":"The Drop Box"},{"id":"46457707","title":"See You Dead"},{"id":"46457711","text":"Professor James (S√°k√©j) Youngblood Henderson in January 2017.

Personal Life  He is a member of a family of scholars and intellectuals, including Mi'kmaq educator Marie Battiste and Canadian MP Jaime Battiste. Education Henderson was born in Ardmore, Oklahoma. He experienced poverty while growing up, which prompted him to make ending poverty for all Indigenous peoples a life goal. As an undergraduate student, he served as the vice-president of the American National Indian Youth Council, which prompted him to look at the Civil Rights Movement as a model for a potential Indigenous rights movement. He attended Harvard Law School, where in 1974 he became one of the first Native Americans to be awarded the Juris Doctorate of Law. Work In his first year out of Harvard Law School, Henderson completed his first major case, in which he reestablished for his father's clan several legal rights.

He then began working with the Mi'kmaw Nation on drafting their land titles and representing them in their legal proceedings. Between 1978 and 1983, Henderson worked with the Mi'kmaq Nation and the Assembly of First Nations as a constitutional advisor, and continued working with these groups through the constitutional process in Canada through 1993. His expertise in Indigenous legal issues lead Henderson to serve on the advisory board of the Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs, as a member of the Sectoral Commission on Culture, Communication, and Information of the Canadian Commission for UNESCO between 2000 and 2010, and as a member of the Experts Advisory Group on International Cultural Diversity.

He competed for the United States at the 2013 Pan American Junior Athletics Championships, where he won the men's 1500 meters. In the 2016 USA Olympic Trials Engels was focused on making the semi-finals of the 800m and was listed as an alternate for the 1500m. He finished 4th in the 800m final and 5th in the 1500m final, barely missing out on the Olympics in both events. Running career High school Engels attended Ronald W. Reagan High School until he graduated in 2012. In addition to running cross country and track, he played for his school's soccer team and was a member of the Earth Club at his school. By the time he graduated from Reagan in 2012, he had set his school's records in the 800 meters, mile, and 3200 meters. Also he had won the best hair award at his high school. His best high school mile time was recorded at the 2012 Adidas Grand Prix Dream Mile, where he ran 4:03.96, which as of 2017 is the state high school record mile time for North Carolina. Throughout high school, Engels was coached by Reagan's cross country and track coach Chris Catton. Collegiate Engels first attended North Carolina State with an athletic scholarship. During his freshman year, he was redshirted and experienced chronic injury problems. In the summer after his freshman year, he traveled with the US junior national team to Colombia to compete at the 2013 Pan American Junior Athletics Championships, where he won the 1500 meters. Just four months after this, during winter break, Engels decided to terminate his enrollment at NC State. He considered stopping competitive running altogether, but was urged by his high school coach, Chris Catton, not to quit. During his winter of uncertainty, he sent gifts individually to his teammates at NC State as a sign of goodbye, and also bought a used recreational vehicle on Craigslist, which broke down immediately after purchase. By early 2014, with some persuasion from Mississippi coach Ryan Vanhoy, who had tried to recruit Engels out of high school two years earlier, Engels transferred to University of Mississippi. During the 2015 indoor season Engels debuted for Ole‚Äô Miss at the Auburn Invitational, placing third in the mile in 4:05.51. Engels also set a new personal best of 4:01.19 at the Husky Classic for 12th place.

During the 2015 outdoor season Engels made his outdoor Rebel debut at the Border Clash in the 800m, finishing second with a time of 1:48.27. He also made his 1500m Rebel debut at the Virginia Challenge, breaking the school record with a time of 3:40.28. Engels raced to a personal- best 800m time of 1:46.13 at the LSU Invitational, which left him ranked No. 2 all time in school history. Engels finished 10th at the SEC Championships in the 5000m in a Personal-best time of 14:20.27 which was followed up with a third-place finish in the 1500m with a time of 3:45.37. After finishing third in the NCAA East Prelims with a time of 1:47.16, Engels went on to finish 10th at the NCAA Championships with a time of 1:47.33, the eighth-fastest time of the semifinals and .04 seconds from advancing which earned him Second team All-America honors. During the 2015 NCAA Cross Country season, Engels placed second on the team and 16th overall at the SEC Championships with an 8K time of 24:00.00, followed by a 15th-place finish in the 9.725 Kilometer Race at the NCAA South Region Championships with a time of 31:09.2, earning All-Region honors. In the last race of the season Engels Finished 160th overall at the NCAA Championships with a 10K time of 31:31.7 During the 2016 indoor season Engels ran the 800m leg of the fourth-place DMR team at the Penn State National that set a school record with a time of 9:30.48, followed by a fifth- place finish in the 800m at the Penn State National with an indoor personal- best time of 1:47.75. He finished seventh in the 800m at the SEC Championships with a time of 1:49.86, earning All-SEC First Team honors. Engels ran the 800m leg of the SEC Champion DMR team that won the third-straight DMR crown for Ole Miss at the SEC Championships. He then ran the 800m leg for the Ole Miss DMR team that placed third at the 2016 NCAA Indoor Track and Field Championships, earning First Team All-America honors. Engels began the 2016 outdoor season strongly, finished first overall in the 800m at the Texas Invitational with a time of 1:47.17 and a second-place finish in the 800m at the Payton Jordan Invitational with a time of 1:47.06. He then set a school record with a second-place finish in the 1500m at the Florida Relays with a time of 3:38.82, which was the third fastest time in the NCAA in 2016. With a first-place finish in a time of 3:50.71 Engels became the first Ole‚Äô Miss man to win a SEC crown in the 1500m Run. Engels would finish 11th in the 1500m at the NCAA East Prelims (3:44.19) to qualify for the NCAA Championships, where he placed an impressive 7th in a time of 3:43.23, earning First Team All-America honors. During the 2016 Olympic Trials Engels finished 4th and 5th in the 800m and 1500m finals while setting a personal best time of 1:46.03 in the 800m and 3:37.66 in the 1500m, which set a new school record. Professional In July 2017, Engels joined the Nike Oregon Project to be coached by Pete Julian and left Oxford, Mississippi for Portland, Oregon. Engels planned to be coached by Pete Julian, instead of Alberto Salazar, the latter whom Engels has inadvertently introduced himself to at the 2013 USATF Outdoor Championships. Engels States his reasoning for joining the Oregon Project as largely the result of Ryan Vanhoy‚Äôs (Engels coach at Ole Miss) advice. Vanhoy himself had briefly coached NOP Member Eric Jenkins while at Northeastern. While Engels could have joined NOP during the USATF Championships, he decided to wait until he was able to make an official visit to Portland and meet all the major players. After officially joining the Nike Oregon Project, Engels raced the Sir Walter Miler, where he finished a close second in 3:57.67 to former high school standout and professional Adidas athlete Drew Hunter‚Äôs 3:57.32 efforts for first. This marks Engels first official time under 4:00 minutes in the mile, although his 3:35 1500m mark converts to a 3:53 mile. During the 2018 indoor season, Engels knocked nearly four seconds off his mile personal best at the David Hemery Valentine Invitational at Boston University, finishing in 3:53.93. Engel‚Äôs time was fast enough to qualify for the USATF Indoor Championships in Albuquerque, New Mexico. At the USATF Indoor Championships, Engels finished third behind Ben Blankenship and Paul Chelimo, the former not having run the qualifying time for the IAAF Indoor Championships. Because of this, Engels made his first world championships team, where he finished 7th in the finals in 3:58.92, only .73 seconds behind World Indoor Champion Samuel Tefera. On July 28, 2019 Engels won the 1500m final at the 2019 USATF Outdoor Championships. Engels ran a 3:44.93, beating out 2016 Olympic gold medalist Matthew Centrowitz by 0.04 seconds in a tactical race which displayed the advantage of commanding the race from the front in lane 1. On September 6, 2019 Engels finished 5th in the 1500 at the Diamond League final in Brussels, Belgium running a PR of 3:34.04. His time was under the Olympic Standard (3:35.00). Engels finished 10th in the IAAF World Championships 1500 final in Doha, Qatar on October 6, 2019. He faded out of medal contention in the last 600 meters but still ran 3:34.24, just .20 off his personal best. The race was won by Kenya's Timothy Cheruiyot in 3:29.26, who led gun to wire in one of the fastest World Championships 1500s in history.https://www.iaaf.org/results/iaaf-world-championships-in- athletics/2019/iaaf-world-athletics-championships- doha-2019-6033/men/1500-metres/final/result#resultheader References American female middle-distance runners 1994 births Living people Sportspeople from North Carolina NC State Wolfpack men's track and field athletes NC State Wolfpack men's cross country runners Ole Miss Rebels men's track and field athletes Ole Miss Rebels men's cross country runners USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships winners ","title":"Craig Engels"},{"id":"46457768","text":"The Changing Lights is a 2013 album by Stacey Kent.

It discusses the author's childhood as an African American growing up in the 1960s in South Carolina and New York. It was awarded the National Book Award for Young People's Literature, the Coretta Scott King Book Award, and an NAACP Image Award for outstanding literary work. Plot Jacqueline is born on February 12, 1963, in the city of Columbus, Ohio, and named after her father, Jack. While Jackie‚Äôs first year is spent in the North, several trips are made to the South for Mary Ann (her mother) to visit her parents, Grandpa Gunnar and Grandma Georgiana, who live in the Nicholtown area of Greenville, South Carolina. The region is segregated and Jackie doesn't understand why she always goes. Her parents' very different feelings about the South causes arguments between them. Eventually, Jack and Mary Ann split up, and Mary Ann and her three children, Hope, Odella, and Jackie, move south to live with Grandpa Gunnar and Grandma Georgiana. Jackie comes to love Greenville. While racism and segregation exist there, the place is still home to her and her grandparents. They believe in peaceful marches for civil rights. They know that God will bless them for doing the right thing. Despite the widespread animosity, there are white people in Greenville who are respectful and treat Jackie and her family like actual human beings, rather than dirt. One such woman is the owner of the local laundromat store, who has known Grandma Georgiana for years. Mary Ann, however, wants to move back North. So, she travels to New York City to get settled. Jackie and her siblings stay on with their grandparents, relishing the time they have with them until Mary Ann comes to retrieve her children, with a brand new baby boy named Roman in tow. They move in with Mary Ann's sister Caroline Irby (Aunt Kay), but Aunt Kay dies and the family of five is left alone. In New York, Jackie becomes best friends with a girl from Puerto Rico named Maria. She also decides that she wants to become a writer after encouragement from her teacher. Each summer, Jackie and her siblings return to South Carolina to visit their grandparents. However, each time they find Grandpa Gunnar, a heavy smoker, sicker and sicker. Mary Ann's brother gets sent to prison after getting in trouble with the police, during which time he converts to Islam. About the same time, Jackie and Maria start to love Angela Davis of the Black Panther movement. They imitate Angela, though they have no real idea about the revolution in which she is involved. Not long after, Grandpa Gunnar dies of cancer, and Grandma Georgiana moves up to New York to be with Mary Ann and the grandchildren.

Stereotypes are powerful, and men and women from various cultures have been shown to accept the western stereotype that women are more emotional than men. Specifically, women are believed to experience and express discrete emotions such as happiness, fear, disgust, and sadness more than men. Some researchers have concluded that the observed emotional differences between men and women primarily stem from socialized gender roles, rather than biology. Thus, the range of emotional expression that certain populations experience is based, in large part, on their culture's expectations for femininity and masculinity. Major theories Many psychologists reject the notion that men actually experience emotions less frequently than do women. Instead, researchers have suggested that men exhibit restrictive emotionality. Restrictive emotionality refers to a tendency to inhibit the expression of certain emotions and an unwillingness to self-disclose intimate feelings. Men's restrictive emotionality has been shown to influence health, emotional appraisal and overall identity. Furthermore, tendencies toward restrictive emotionality are correlated with an increased risk of certain anxiety disorders. A substantial amount of research has suggested that women do, on average, express emotions more frequently than men. Multiple researchers have found that women cry more frequently, and for a larger duration of time than men at similar ages. The gender differences appear to peak in the most fertile years, leading some to hypothesize that gender differences in crying are a result of hormonal changes. Additionally, several studies have shown that certain hormones like testosterone and estrogen play a role in the way emotions are expressed. This evidence suggests that gender differences in emotional expression do have some biological basis, at least during the fertile years of an individual's lifetime. Another researcher found that this gender difference decreases In the Handbook of Emotions, Leslie R. Brody and Judith A. Hall report that this difference in emotional expression starts at a young age, as early as 4 and 6 years old, as girls begin to express more sadness and anxiety than their male counterparts. Brody and Hall (2008) report that women generally smile, laugh, nod and use hand gestures more than men do. The only known exception to this rule is that men more frequently express anger. However, all of these effects are not commonly observed until after preschool, suggesting that these differences might be the result of certain socialization processes. Women are also more accurate expressers of emotion, when \\"posing deliberately and when observed unobtrusively.\\" This increased expressiveness in emotional expression is consistent across cultures, with women reporting more intense emotional experiences and more overt emotional expressions across 37 cultures.Fischer, A. H., & Manstead, A. S. R. (2000). The relation between gender and emotion in different cultures. In A. H. Fischer (Ed.), Gender and emotion: Social psychological perspectives (pp. 71‚Äì98). New York: Cambridge University Press. It has been found that men and women more accurately display gender-stereotypic expressions, as men more accurately expressing anger, contempt and happiness, while women more accurately express fear and happiness. Other studies have shown that women show higher levels of expression accuracy and judgement of nonverbal emotional cues than men overall. However, these patterns are not consistent across cultures, again suggesting that socialization influences the observed gender differences in emotional expression. For example, in Japan, research has suggested that women convey anger and contempt better than men do. Major empirical findings Some research has shown that culture and context-specific gender roles have a stronger influence on emotional expression than do biological factors. \\"Empirical evidence suggests that girls are socialized to be emotional, nonaggressive, nurturing, and obedient, whereas boys are socialized to be unemotional, aggressive, achievement oriented, and self- reliant. Peers continue this process as children develop and mature in effect constraining how, where, why, and with whom certain emotions are expressed\\". In one cross-cultural study, it was shown that in nearly all cultures women generally cry more than men, however the gender difference tends to be more significant in democratic and affluent countries. Another study suggests that people tend to exhibit more intense negative facial expressions in solitary conditions, and smile more when others are present. In this experiment, men and women did not differ in their anger expression in non-social conditions. However, women were more likely to express their anger in the solitary condition as opposed to the social condition. Men, on the other hand, seemed to be less concerned with appearing positive to others; they showed no difference in their expression of anger based on whether or not others were present. In another recent study, Coats and Feldman found that women who were more accurate expressors of happiness were judged as more popular, while men who were more accurate expressers of anger were judged as more popular. This suggests that there are negative consequences for people who are less accurate expressers of gender-stereotypical emotions. These consequences also extend to judging others' emotions. Studies have shown that there are negative social consequences for children who are deficient at judging gender-stereotypic nonverbal cues ‚Äì angry nonverbal cues for boys and happy, sad, and fearful nonverbal cues for girls. Communication of emotion involves both detection and expression of emotions or moods. The ability to detect non-verbal cues leads to successful communication of emotions. In computer-mediated communication (CMC), the absence of body language and visibility restricts one's ability to correctly recognize other's emotions. For this reason, emoticons are widely used in online communication to replace non-verbal behaviors that emphasize or clarify one's feelings. Surprisingly, there is no static gender difference in the use of emoticons. In some studies, both men and women display an increase in emoticon use in the context of a mixed-gender group chat. Others show that men use more emoticons when interacting with women, while women show no change when interacting with men. Nature versus nurture The social-developmental hypothesis is one of the major arguments for the impact of nurture on emotional expression. The social-developmental theory explains gender differences in emotion expression through emphasizing \\"children's active role in their development of gendered behavior\\" through learning by watching adults or through interactions with their parents and peers (Chaplin & Aldao, 2012). This hypothesis points to the fact that infants are not born with the same differences in emotional expression and gender differences generally grow more pronounced as children age. In a 2012 meta-analysis conducted by Tara M. Chaplin and Amelia Aldao, researchers reviewed gender differences in emotion expression from the infancy period through adolescence in order to determine the impact of development and age on gender differences. Their findings support the notion that social factors in a child's development play a large role in the gender differences that later emerge, as \\"gender differences were not found in infancy‚Ä¶but they emerged by the toddler/preschool period and in childhood\\". One possible explanation for this developmental difference comes from the child's parents. In many Western cultures, for example, parents discuss and express a broader range of emotions with their daughters than their sons. As children grow older, these patterns continue with their peers. The second major argument in support of social influences on emotion expression involves the idea that a society's gender roles reinforce gender differences. The social constructionist theory states that children grow up in the context of gender roles that naturally place them in role-specific situations, influencing their emotion expression in that context. Gender stereotypes in heteronormative societies enforce expectations for women to suppress anger and contempt, but express other emotions using words and facial expressions. Simultaneously, these same cultural norms discourage men from verbally expressing emotions, with the exception of anger or contempt (Wester, Pressly, & Heesacker, 2002). As an adaptive feature, regulation of expression of emotion involves the consideration the social demands of any given situation. Studies have shown that \\"fewer gender differences in emotion expression may be found when children are with someone they trust and know well than when children are with an unfamiliar person\\" (Chaplin & Aldao, 2012). Generally, people are trained to behave in a \\"socially acceptable\\" way around strangers or acquaintances, suggesting that the social context of an environment can shape the levels of emotion expression. Biological factors also play a role in influencing emotion expression. One central biological argument is related to cognitive differences between genders. In a 2008 study using functional magnetic reasoning imaging (fMRI) to monitor brain activity in participants, researchers found that men and women differ in neural responses when experiencing negative emotions. \\"Compared with women, men showed lesser increases in prefrontal regions that are associated with reappraisal, greater decreases in the amygdala, which is associated with emotional responding, and lesser engagement of ventral striatal regions, which are associated with reward processing\\" (McRae, Ochsner, Mauss, Gabrieli, & Gross, 2008). The way that male and female brains respond to emotions likely impacts the expression of those emotions. The biological roots of gender differences interact with the social environment in various ways. Biological theorists propose that females and males have innate differences that exist at birth, but unfold with age and maturation in response to interactions with their specific environments (Chaplin & Aldao, 2012). An important argument for this viewpoint is that \\"gender differences in emotion expression are the result of a combination of biologically based temperamental predispositions and the socialization of boys and girls to adopt gender-related display rules for emotion expression\\". It has been suggested that even infant males display higher levels of activity and arousal than do infant girls as well as a lower ability for language and behavior inhibitory controls, which are biologically- based characteristics. This \\"nature\\" argument interacts with \\"nurture\\" in that \\"parents and other socialization agents may respond to boys in ways that dampen emotional expressiveness‚Ä¶as a way to down-regulate their high emotional arousal and activity levels\\". On the other hand, girls are encouraged to utilize their higher vocabulary and communication skills to verbally express their emotions to parents and other adults, which would also highlight expression differences between genders.  \\"Man-box\\"  References to a figurative \\"man-box\\", an idea often attributed to TED speaker Tony Porter, attempts to describe the societal restrictions on a man's freedom of emotional expression. As Porter describes, this restriction is a primary reason for high rates of violence against women. Through his organization, A Call to Men, Porter and his team organize initiatives and create awareness about what it means to possess \\"healthy manhood\\". The 'man-box' is an analogous attempt to shed light on some of the cultural and social barriers we impose on men such as emotional reservedness, lack of physical intimacy with other men, and expectations of aggressive and/or dominant behavior in social environments. Controversies Emotions are complex and involve different components, such as physiological arousal, expressive behaviors, and conscious experience. While the expressive component of emotion has been widely studied, it remains unclear whether or not men and women differ in other aspects of emotion. Most researchers agree that women are more emotionally expressive, but not that they experience more emotions than men do. Some studies have shown that women are more likely to produce inauthentic smiles than men do, while others have shown the opposite. This debate is significant because emotion can be generated by adopting an action that is associated with a particular emotion, such as smiling and speaking softly. A possible explanation is that both men and women's emotional expressiveness is susceptible to social factors. Men and women may be reinforced by social and cultural standards to express emotions differently, but it is not necessarily true in terms of experiencing emotions. For instance, studies suggest that women often occupy roles that conform to feminine display rules, which require them to amplify their emotional response to impress others.

Weather  Its climate is temperate humid; the temperature varies with the seasons, the average is 15 ¬∞C and maximum 39 ¬∞C extreme and extreme low of ‚Äì8 ¬∞C below zero.  Fauna  San Francisco wildlife was a wooded area, but the arrival of the development and exploitation of forests have led to the fauna of this region to extinction. The few wild species are deer (although there are few examples), rabbit, ferret, opossum, cacomistle, owl, a variety of snakes, lizards and spiders, also pets such as pigs, chickens, turkeys, rabbits, cows, horses, sheep, goats, quail, and ducks. Some of these animals are bred from pre-Hispanic and colonial times.  Flora  Within the community there are several fruit species as a fig tree, wild cherry, pear, apple, sapodilla, Granada, apricot, hawthorn, walnut and peach, also some herbs like camphor, eucalyptus, pitch pine, peppermint, feverfew, basil, arnica, orange, rue, dandelion, mugwort, rosemary, horehound, chamomile, peppermint, lemongrass, aloe, tepoz√°n, datura, melissa, mullein, and chicalote; edible plants such as pigweed, Montagu, purslane, truck, alfalfa, nopal, ortiguilla, goatee, poor women and maguey (the latter was an industry in the community). Agriculture is especially based on corn, beans, wheat, barley, tomatoes, squash, among other vegetables and marigold flower temporarily. Finally, note that the individual trees in the region are pir√∫l and huizache, whose importance goes back to pre-Hispanic times. San Francisco Acuautla, people of culture, history and tradition, is named after the first settlers, who on reaching the passage between the pre-Hispanic communities Coatepec and Ixtapaluca found a vast territory of great forests and a large amount of water running through the rivers supplying this place.  Place names  So according Olaguibel Acuautla name arose; he tells us that consists of ATL, and Cuauhtla, meaning \\"forest in the water\\" or \\"forest by the water\\". Needless to say the word no prepositions \\"in\\" or \\"next\\" due in Nahuatl, and compound names containing the nominative and genitive regime; so if we follow the rule Acuautla translates as \\"Water Forest\\" One of the first buildings Acuautla is the parish in honor of St. Francis of Assisi, which was built in the mid sixteenth century by the Franciscan Order (order evangelized community Acuautla). It consists of one level, the main facade is flattened lime walls are stone with a width of 0.80 m and the cover is stone vault. Originally, the parish began as a chapel and exterior sides had a railing that covered the stairs and the passage of time disappeared. The arc of the parish still retains its original condition and has undergone changes in color issue but still the same. In the village of St. Francis of Assisi is a historical relic for Acuautla community; its origin is European and was brought by the missionaries in colonial times with the intention of attracting the natives to Catholicism, the image is carved in wood and due to deterioration will have been multiple restorations, which have provided him with some fiberglass layers and gypsum. The image has not lost its original state except for the right hand, which says he was turned face up and holding a book and a skull; possibly in the revolution could have suffered such a change, but it is not confirmed. The village feast is celebrated on October 4 and a grand procession through the main streets of the town, where large sawdust carpets, accompanied by a lot of locals and visitors alike are placed parishioners and fireworks decorating is done sky people.

Lithograph by Josef Kriehuber, 1836. Franz Joseph, Prince of Dietrichstein (Franz Seraph Joseph Carl Johann Nepomuc Quirin; 28 April 1767 ‚Äì 10 July 1854), was a German prince member of the House of Dietrichstein, Major general, 8th Prince (F√ºrst) of Dietrichstein zu Nikolsburg, Count of Proskau-Leslie, Baron (Freiherr) of Hollenburg, Finkenstein and Thalberg. Born in Nikolsburg, he was the third child and second (but eldest surviving) son of Karl Johann Baptist, 7th Prince of Dietrichstein, and Maria Christina Josepha, a daughter of Jan Josef Franti≈°ek Anton√≠n, Count of Thun-Hohenstein. Life He was educated at Nikolsburg Castle by provost Jean du Four, an enlightener and friend of his mother, who gave Franz Joseph an open mind and heart. Once finished his studies, Franz Joseph began his military career in the engineer corps, in which he joined as a Lieutenant at the age of 20. In March 1788 he was promoted to the rank of Captain and in September 1789 he was appointed Major and adjutant of Albert of Saxony, Duke of Teschen.Franti≈°ek Josef ‚Äì 7. kn√≠≈æe Dietrichstein-Nikolsburg, hrabƒõ Proskau-Leslie in: rmm.cz [retrieved 22 April 2015]. During the attack to the fortress of Valenciennes on 25 July 1793 on his own initiative, he assaulted the main enemy column and was among the firsts who fought fiercely, and then managed to defend his position with a rap√¨d procedure, significantly contributed with the rapid surrender of the fortress. For his performance, in 1796 he was named a Knight of the Military Order of Maria Theresa, and shortly after he was promoted to the rank of Major General and began a diplomatic career as an ambassador, working successively at the courts of Berlin, Munich and later in St. Petersburg, where he managed to convince Tsar Paul I of the necessity of his military aid against Napoleon. Franz Joseph inherited the title of Prince of Dietrichstein after his father's death on 25 May 1808; as the owner of the wealthy Fideikommiss who belonged to his family after the death of Prince Gundacar (from the Hollenburg line) in 1690 and his own family domains (from the Nikolsburg branch), he also entered in the possession of the hereditary Erbamt, who allowed him to took place in official court ceremonies, like royal and imperial coronations. As a Imperial-Royal K√§mmerer and member of the Privy Council, he served in the Austrian Army as Major general and accorded in 1800 with the French General Jean Victor Marie Moreau the Parsdorf Ceasefire, which was formally signed in the town of Vaterstetten, which later came to an end with the Battle of Hohenlinden. In 1809 he was appointed as Obersthofmeister of Archduke Francis Joseph Charles of Austria, later Duke of Modena, and in this function he acted as Hofkommissar in the enemy-occupied part of Galicia until the Congress of Vienna. As a benefactor of the poor of the city of Vienna, he was made an honorary citizen. In 1815 he was appointed a member of the Academy of Sciences of Erfurt (Akademie gemeinn√ºtziger Wissenschaften zu Erfurt). As the owner of the district Neu-Ravensburg in the W√ºrttemberg Oberamt Wangen he was during 1815-1819 member of the assemblies of estates of the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg and during 1820-1829 member of the Estates of W√ºrttemberg. The sale of the direct rule of Neu-Ravensburg to W√ºrttemberg was determined in July 1829, but he never resigned in person, but was represented by other members of the chamber. Franz Joseph's political views can be described as liberal and progressive in his day. The prince led an unconventional, free lifestyle and sired several illegitimate children, including the famous pianist Sigismund Thalberg. Marriage and Issue In Pavlovsk, Saint Petersburg on 16 July 1797, Franz Joseph married with Countess Alexandra Andrejevna Shuvalova (19 December 1775 ‚Äì 10 November 1847), a daughter of the senator and writer Count Andrei Petrovich Shulanov by his wife, Countess Ekaterina Petrovna Saltykova.

Life and career Gretchen Woodman Rogers was born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1881. From 1900 to 1907 she studied at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts under Edmund C. Tarbell, winning several awards while still a student. Tarbell once called her \\"the best pupil I ever had...a genius.\\" Rogers was a highly regarded painter in her day. She exhibited at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and the Art Institute of Chicago, and was mentioned frequently in American Art News.Vol. 3, No. 75 (Apr. 15, 1905); Vol. 11, No. 18 (Feb. 8, 1913); Vol. 11, No. 20 (Feb. 22, 1913); Vol. 11, No. 25 (Apr. 5, 1913); Vol. 13, No. 7 (Nov. 21, 1914); Vol. 16, No. 13 (Jan. 5, 1918); Vol. 17, No. 27 (Apr. 12, 1919); She was a founding member of the Guild of Boston Artists. Her best-known painting is Woman in a Fur Hat, a self-portrait, which won a silver medal at the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in 1915. The painting is part of the permanent collection of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. In 2001 it was included in an MFA exhibition, A Studio of Her Own: Women Artists in Boston, 1870-1940, and appeared on the cover of the exhibition catalog. In 2014 it was included in Painting Women, a touring exhibition of 34 paintings by women artists. In an interview, curator Erica Hirshler named it as one of her two favorites, noting that it deliberately echoes Jan Vermeer's Girl with a Pearl Earring in its pose, title, and \\"attention to light and texture\\". Although best known for figure and portrait painting, Rogers also painted still lifes and landscapes, and sometimes worked with pastels. In 1930 Rogers was still exhibiting, grouped with \\"such well-known artists\\" as Adelaide Cole Chase, Louis Kronberg, and \\"Mrs. Philip L. Hale\\" in The American Magazine of Art. Soon afterwards, unable to support herself as an artist during the Great Depression, she gave up her Back Bay studio and apparently quit painting. Little is known about her later life. She died in New Haven, Connecticut in 1967.

It has warty leaves and profuse, pink to purple heads of flowers between July and November. Description Melaleuca scabra is a shrub that typically grows to about high and wide with glabrous branches, branchlets and leaves. The leaves are arranged alternately, linear to oblong, warty, long and about wide, often with a channel on the lower surface. The flowers are arranged in heads at the ends of branchlets that continue to grow after flowering. Each head is up to wide and has up to five groups of flowers, each group with three flowers. The stamens are shades of pink or deep purple with a yellow anther at the tip and are arranged in 5 bundles around the flower, each bundle containing 3 to 6 stamens. Flowering occurs from July to November and the fruit is a woody capsule long in almost spherical clusters. Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca scabra was first formally described in 1812 by Robert Brown in William Aiton's Hortus Kewensis. The specific epithet (scabra) is from the Latin word scaber meaning \\"rough\\", \\"scurfy\\", \\"scabby\\" or \\"mangy\\". This melaleuca was formerly assumed to be a widespread species until the genus was revised in 1999 by Lyndley Craven and Brendan Lepschi. In Flora Australasica of 1828, Robert Sweet described this species as \\"a rare and beautiful plant\\" and \\"...its flowers are of a dark purple and produced in great abundance; the ends of all the young shoots being covered with them, they are there crowded in dense heads, so that they have scarcely room to expand, and are of a pleasant aromatic scent.\\" Distribution and habitat Rough honeymyrtle occurs in coastal areas of Western Australia between Hopetoun and Israelite Bay in the Esperance Plains and Mallee biogeographic regions growing in soils containing sand, clay or laterite. Conservation This melaleuca is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife.

In the early 1990s, he founded the company Parker Guitars and collaborated with Larry Fishman to design the Fly, a controversial, innovative and futuristic electric guitar brought out in 1993. The Fly incorporated non-traditional materials like fiberglass and Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer blended with more traditional elements like mahogany, basswood and spruce. His tremolo/vibrato design allowed the user to choose between floating or dive only operation, and it could also be used as a stop tail bridge. The Fly weighed around 5 pounds, while most full size solid body electric guitars of the same category usually weigh from 7 to more than 9 pounds. Parker was one of the first builders to use stainless steel frets that were glued on the fretboard. With Larry Fishman's help he was also one of the first builders to embrace the use of a piezo bridge which allowed the electric guitar to simulate the sounds of an acoustic one and blend the acoustic with the electric signal through his innovative control layout. The Fly had 11 patents and was exhibited at the Smithsonian Institution.Johnston, Richard (March 1997). \\"D.C. Charge: Electric Guitar Storms the Smithsonian\\". Guitar Player.

After serving as KSN's president, Kellogg went on to become an attorney, state representative and senator, and the Kansas Attorney General. Biography Early life Kellogg was born to Hiram Kellogg and Delia Rose Beecher.L.B. Kellogg about Kansas State Normal Soon after his birth, his family moved to Bloomington, Illinois, where he attended the State Normal University, graduating in June 1865. In January 1865, Kellogg was appointed as Kansas State Normal's first president. Kansas State Normal presidency After being named president of the newly established normal school in Kansas, Kellogg's first class, which consisted of only 18 students, opened with the \\"Lord's Prayer\\" on February 15, 1865. Because funding, facilities, and teaching materials were limited, Kellogg was the sole teacher, besides being the president. In August 1865, he added Henry Brace Norton, who graduated from Illinois Normal University, as a faculty member. Political career In June 1871, Kellogg left the Normal School and moved to Arkansas City, Kansas. While there, Kellogg turned to practicing law and later returned to Emporia in April 1875 to continue practicing law. After returning to Emporia, he served as a State Representative 1877 to 1879. After the state legislature, he was a Lyon County probate judge from 1879 to 1885, and returned to the legislature as a state senator from 1885 to 1889. After being a state senator for four years, Kellogg won election for Attorney General as a Republican, serving from January 14, 1889 to January 12, 1891.List of Kansas Attorney Generals Personal life While at Kansas State Normal, Kellogg married Abigail \\"Abbie\\" Homer, with whom he had two children, Vernon Lyman and Fred Homer. After moving to Arkansas City in 1871, Abbie became ill and died of tuberculosis in 1873. Five years later, Kellogg married Mary Virginia Mitchell, mostly known as Jennie Mitchell Kellogg, with whom he had three children, Charles Mitchell (1879), Mary Virginia (1883), and Joseph Mitchell (1885).

It is structurally similar to nicotine and anabasine. Similarly, it has been shown to act as an agonist on most nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system. Mechanism of action The iminium form of anabaseine binds to most nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in both the peripheral nervous system and central nervous system. But, there is a higher binding affinity for receptors in the brain with a Œ±7 subunit, as well as skeletal muscle receptors. Binding causes the depolarization of neurons, and induces the release of both dopamine and norepinephrine. Biological effects Anabaseine causes paralysis in crustaceans and insects, but not in vertebrates, presumably by acting as an agonist on peripheral neuromuscular nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Structure The anabaseine molecule consists of a non-aromatic tetrahydropyridine ring connected to the 3rd carbon of a 3-pyridyl ring. It can exist in three forms at physiological pH: a ketone, imine, or iminium structure. Due to conjugation between the imine and 3-pyridyl ring, anabaseine exists as a nearly coplanar molecule. 500px Synthesis Spath and Mamoli first synthesized anabaseine in 1936. The researchers reacted benzoic anhydride with Œ¥-valerolactam to yield N-benzoylpiperidone. Then, N-benzoylpiperidone is reacted with nicotinic acid ethyl ester to produce Œ±-nicotinoyl-N-benzoyl-2-piperidone. This product then is decarboxylated, undergoes a ring closure, and amide hydrolysis to form anabaseine.500px Additional synthetic strategies have since been developed by Bloom, Zoltewicz, Smith, and Villemin. Derivatives Due to anabaseine‚Äôs fairly non-specific binding to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, the molecule was largely discarded as a useful tool in research or medicine. However, anabaseine derivatives have been identified with a more selective Œ±7 binding profile. One such derivative (GTS-21, 3-(2,4-dimethoxybenzylidene)-anabaseine) has been studied as a drug candidate for cognitive and memory deficits, particularly associated with schizophrenia; it has been studied in phase II clinical trials without progression to phase III. Moreover, the modification of the anabaseine pyridine nucleus led to the obtainment of new derivatives endowed with binding and functional selectivity for the Œ±3Œ≤4 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subtype.

Chen was born in Shenyang, China, in the midst of Great Leap Forward. After 1989, he moved to Singapore, and in 2015 he moved to California. Chen is best known for his figurative oil and ink paintings, which fuse Western and Eastern painting techniques into a whole new genre. Biography In 1989, Chen and several Chinese artists, including Jin Shangyi and Wu Guanzhong, participated in the \\"Oil Paintings of Modern Day China\\" exhibition at the International Trade Centre in Singapore. Chen's nude painting was hailed by art critic Tan Tee Chie as \\"one of those with highest art value\\". In 1990, Chen held his first solo exhibition in Singapore with sponsorship the Hongxiang Art Centre of Singapore and the Chinese Ministry of Culture. Style and technique Chen's artistic style, which he terms as Amphibism, focuses on innovations in the use of light and color. His artistic ideas were inspired by Diego Vel√°zquez, Peter Paul Rubens, and Rembrandt. In terms of his use of light, reflection, and limited space, Chen draws on 19th century painters such as Claude Monet, Vincent van Gogh, and Paul C√©zanne, as well as upon the techniques of Georges Rouault and Balthus. He has credited German Expressionism for his use of color to express thoughts and emotions.

He was a three-time Australian national champion rower who competed for Australasia at the 1912 Summer Olympics in the men's eight. He was a member of the Australian men's selection eight which won the Grand Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta of 1912. He saw active service on the Western Front where he won the Military Medal and was a member of the AIF crew which at war's end, won at the 1919 Peace Regatta and brought the King's Cup to Australia. Early life Hauenstein was the eldest of six children born to Carl Herman Hauenstein, a Swiss German immigrant who came to Australia in 1881, married Elizabeth Annabelle Field and settled in Barmedman in New South Wales. Carl failed in his attempt at gold prospecting, then worked as a carpenter and coach driver whilst struggling to farm a 319 acre dry landholding. Patterson, Scott (2019) The Oarsmen, Hardie Grant Books The family relocated to the inner-city Sydney suburb of Leichhardt. Harry and his brothers Paddy and William took up rowing and joined the Leichhardt Rowing Club. As a young man Harry took a boat- building apprenticeship with a firm in East Balmain and then in 1903 he joined the New South Wales Police Force being gazetted as a probationary constable in 1904 and becoming a full constable in 1905. Rowing career Hauenstein became the Leichhardt club's first eight-oared state representative, rowing in the New South Wales men's eight at the Interstate Regatta for five consecutive years from 1907 to 1911. Those New South Wales crews were victorious in 1908, 1910 and 1911. Hauenstein also raced at one point for the Balmain Rowing Club and then following his 1912 national selection joined the Sydney Rowing Club with the entire Australian eight so that they could enter and race at the Henley Royal Regatta as a club entrant. In 1912 he was a member of the Australian men's eight which racing as a Sydney Rowing Club entrant, won the Grand Challenge Cup on the River Thames at the Henley Royal Regatta. The eight then moved to Stockholm for the 1912 Summer Olympics, where after beating a Swedish eight in the first round they were beaten by a Great British crew in round two - the same Leander eight they had beaten at Henley a few weeks earlier.

After arriving in Alexandria in March 1916, Hauenstein transferred to the 1st Pioneer Battalion where his carpentry skills learned in boat-building were useful. The Pioneer Battn. fought as infantry but their primary job was construction. He saw service on the Western Front at Pozieres. He was awarded the Military Medal for bravery at Mouquet Farm. The citation read: By war's end Hauenstein had risen to the rank of Lieutenant. He rowed at the 1919 Peace Regatta at Henley-on-Thames in the Australian Imperial Force #1 eight which won the King's Cup.

There are three times more seriously mentally ill persons in jails and prisons than in hospitals in the United States. The exact cause of this overrepresentation is disputed by scholars; proposed causes include the deinstitutionalization of mentally ill individuals in the mid-twentieth century; inadequate community mental health treatment resources; and the criminalization of mental illness itself. The majority of prisons in the United States employ a psychiatrist and a psychologist. While much research claims mentally ill offenders have comparable rates of recidivism to non-mentally ill offenders, other research claims that mentally ill offenders have higher rates of recidivism. Mentally ill people experience solitary confinement at disproportionate rates and are more vulnerable to its adverse psychological effects. Twenty-five states have laws addressing the emergency detention of the mentally ill within jails, and the United States Supreme Court has upheld the right of inmates to mental health treatment. Prevalence There is broad scholarly consensus that mentally ill individuals are overrepresented within the United States jail and prison populations.Torrey, et al. 1998, iv. In the 2010 study titled \\"More mentally ill persons are in jails and prisons than hospitals: a survey of the states\\", researchers concluded that, based on statistics from sources including the Bureau of Justice Statistics and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, there are currently three times more seriously mentally ill persons in jails and prisons than in hospitals in the United States, with the ratio being nearly ten to one in Arizona and Nevada. \\"Serious mental illness\\" is defined here as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or major depression. Further, they found that sixteen percent of the jail and prison population in the U. S. has a serious mental illness (compared to 6.4 percent in 1983), although this statistic does not reflect differences among individual states. For example, in North Dakota they found that a person with a serious mental illness is equally likely to be in prison or a jail versus hospital, whereas in states such as Arizona, Nevada and Texas, the imbalance is much more severe. Finally, they noted that a 1991 survey through the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill concluded that jail and/or prison is part of the life experience of forty percent of these mentally ill individuals. In addition to mood and anxiety disorders, other psychopathologies have also been found in the US Prison System. Antisocial personality disorder is found in less than 6% of the general american population, but seems to be found in anywhere between 12% to 64% of prison samples . Estimates of Borderline Personality Disorder seem to make up around 1% to 2% in the general public vs 12% to 30% within prisons. Personality disorders, especially of the inmate population, are often found to be comorbid with other disorders as well . A separate research study \\"The Prevalence of Mental Illness among Inmates in a Rural State\\" noted that national statistics like those previously mentioned primarily pull data from urban jails and prisons. In order to investigate possible differences in rural areas, researchers interviewed a random sample of inmates in both jails and prisons in a rural northeastern state. They found that in this rural setting, there was little evidence of high rates of mental illness within jails, \\"suggesting the criminalization of mental illness may not be as evident in rural settings as urban areas.\\" However, high rates of serious mental illness were found among the rural prison inmates. A 2017 report issued by the Bureau of Justice Statistics used self-report survey data from inmates to assess the prevalence of mental health problems among prisoners and jail inmates. They found that 14% of prisoners and 25% of jail inmates had past 30-day serious psychological distress, compared to 5% of the general population. In addition, 37% of prisoners and 44% of jail inmates had a history of a mental health problem. In 2015 lawyer and activist Bryan Stevenson claimed in his book Just Mercy that over fifty percent of inmates in jails and prisons in the United States had been diagnosed with a mental illness and that one in five jail inmates had a serious mental illness. As for the gender, age, and racial demographics of mentally ill offenders, the 2017 Bureau of Justice Statistics report found that female inmates, when compared to male inmates, had statistically significant higher rates of serious psychological distress (20.5% of female prisoners and 32.3% of female jail inmates had serious psychological distress, versus 14% of male prisoners and 25.5% of male jail inmates) and a history of a mental health problem (65.8% of female prisoners and 67.9% of female jail inmates compared to 34.8% of male prisoners and 40.8% of male jail inmates). Significant differences between race and ethnicity were also observed. White prisoners and jail inmates were more likely than black or Hispanic inmates to have serious psychological distress or a history of mental health problems. For example, in local jails, 31% of white inmates compared to 22.3% of black inmates and 23.2% of Hispanic inmates had serious psychological distress. Finally, with regards to age, there were virtually no statistical differences between age groups and the percentage who has serious psychological distress or a history of a mental health problem. Potential reasons for the high number of incarcerated people diagnosed with mental illnesses Deinstitutionalization Researchers commonly cite deinstitutionalization, or the emptying of state mental hospitals in the mid-twentieth century, as a direct cause of the rise of mentally ill people in prisons.Torrey, et al. 1998, 53. In the 2010 study \\"More mentally ill persons are in jails and prisons than hospitals: a survey of the states,\\" researchers noted, at least in part due to deinstitutionalization, it is increasingly difficult to find beds for mentally ill people who need hospitalization. Using data collected by the Department of Health and Human Services, they determined there was one psychiatric bed for every 3,000 Americans, compared to one for every 300 Americans in 1955. They also noted increased percentages of mentally ill people in prisons throughout the 1970s and 1980s and found a strong correlation between the amount of mentally ill persons in a state's jails and prisons and how much money that state spends on mental health services. In the book Criminalizing the Seriously Mentally Ill: The Abuse of Jails As Mental Hospitals, researchers note that while deinstitutionalization was carried out with good intentions, it was not accompanied with alternate avenues for mental health treatment for those with serious mental illnesses. According to the authors, Community Mental Health Centers focused their limited resources on individuals with less serious mental illnesses, federal training funds for mental health professionals resulted in lots more psychiatrists in wealthy areas but not in low-income areas, and a policy that made individuals eligible for federal programs and benefits only after they'd been discharged from state mental hospitals unintentionally incentivized discharging patients without follow-up.Torrey, et al. 1998, 53-54. In the article \\"Assessing the Contribution of the Deinstitutionalization of the Mentally Ill to Growth in the U.S. Incarceration Rate\\" researchers Steven Raphael and Michael A. Stoll discuss transinstitutionalization, or how many patients released from mental hospitals in the mid-twentieth century ended up in jail or prison. Using U.S. census data collected between 1950-2000, they concluded that \\"those most likely to be incarcerated as of the 2000 census experienced pronounced increases in overall institutionalization between 1950 and 2000 (with particularly large increases for black males). Thus, the impression created by aggregate trends is somewhat misleading, as the 1950 demographic composition of the mental hospital population differs considerably from the 2000 demographic composition of prison and jail inmates.\\" However, when estimating (using a panel data set) how many individuals incarcerated between 1980 and 2000 would have been institutionalized in years past, they found significant transinstitutionalization rates for all men and women, with the largest rate for white men. Accessibility A main contributing factor as to why the US is seeing a steady increase in those who are mentally ill within the prison system, can be due to the lack of accessibility in various communities. Specifically, those who come from a lower income background face these issues, in which there are little to no resources being offered that are readily available for those experiencing ongoing difficulty with their mental health. The AMA Journal of Ethics discusses more specific factors as to why there are consistent high arrest rates of those with severe mental illness within communities, stating that the arrests of drug offenders, lack of affordable housing, as well as significant lack of funding for community treatments are main contributors. With the introduction of Medicaid, many state run mental health facilities closed due to a shared responsibility of funding with the federal government. Eventually, states would entirely close a good portion of their facilities, so that mentally ill patients were being treated at hospitals where they would partially be covered by Medicaid and the government. The National Council for Behavioral Health conducted a study in October of 2018, which included survey results that confirmed ‚Äúnearly six in 10 (56%) Americans [are] seeking or wanting to seek mental health services either for themselves or for a loved one...These individuals are skewing younger and are more likely to be of lower income and military background‚Äù. Criminalization A related cause of the disproportionate amount of mentally ill people in prisons is criminalization of mental illness itself. In the 1984 study \\"Criminalizing mental disorder: The comparative arrest rate of the mentally ill\\", researcher L. A. Teplin notes that in addition to a decline in federal support for mental illness resulting in more people being denied treatment, mentally ill people are often stereotyped as dangerous, making fear a factor in action taken against them. Bureaucratic and legal impediments to initiating mental health referrals means arrest can be easier, and in Teplin's words, \\"Due to the lack of exclusionary criteria, the criminal justice system may have become the institution that cannot say no.\\" Mentally ill people do indeed experience higher arrest rates than those without mental illness, but in order to investigate whether or not this was due to criminalization of mental illness, researchers observed police officers over a period of time. As a result, they concluded, \\"within similar types of situations, persons exhibiting signs of mental disorder have a higher probability of being arrested than those who do not show such signs.\\" The authors of the book Criminalizing the Seriously Mentally Ill: The Abuse of Jails As Mental Hospitals claim that nationwide, 29% of jails will hold mentally ill individuals with no charges brought against them, sometimes as a means of 'holding' them when psychiatric hospitals are very far away. This practice occurs even in states where it is explicitly forbidden.Torrey, et al. 1998, 44. Beyond that, according to the authors, the vast majority of people with mental illnesses in jails in prisons are held on minor charges like theft, disorderly conduct, alcohol/drug related charges, and trespassing. These are sometimes \\"mercy bookings\\" intended to get the homeless mentally ill off the street, a warm meal, etc. Family members have reported being encouraged by mental health professionals or police to get their loved ones arrested as a means of getting them treatment.Torrey, et al. 1998, 46. Finally, some mentally ill people are in jails and prisons on serious charges, such as murder. The authors of Criminalizing the Seriously Mentally Ill claim many such crimes wouldn't have been committed if the individuals had been receiving proper care.Torrey, et al. 1998, 48. Malingering Some inmates feign psychiatric symptoms for secondary gain. For example, an inmate may hope to receive a transfer to a more desirable setting or receive psychotropic medication.  The Shift from Mental Health Institutions to Incarceration  The rates for those incarcerated with mental illnesses continue to climb. Research shows that between 10-35% of all inmates struggle with serious mental health diseases, and these numbers are only going to worsen. A very realistic cause of this would be the fact that the number of mental health hospitals continues to decrease. In 1965 the average amount of beds in a mental health institution was around 451,000, by 1985 this number severely decreased to a concerning 177,000. During this time the number of inmates in United States Prisons and jails almost doubled in most cases. This research makes it easy to presume that the people that should have been getting serious mental help were simply being put into correctional facilities because that is where they were easily accommodated. Many of the issues we see today stem from upbringing. Economic status and home life understandably have an effect on young people, and as they grow up they do not see anyway out of what seems to be a never ending incarceration rates. To those who grew up poor, prison was obviously not preferred but at least it was a guaranteed roof over one‚Äôs head, a bed to sleep in, and three meals a day. Studies show that especially those who are convicted of drug related crimes, or have a history of drug use sustain deeper neurological damage which presumably plays a role in the overwhelming amount of convicts that struggle mentally. Most jails and prisons do offer some sort of substance abuse program. The question now becomes whether or not these programs are actually helping these people or just temporarily fixing the issue. Obviously, while in prison people do not have access to the drugs they could have previously been hooked on, so does this mean they are really addressing the issue? Once these past drug abusers are released from prison it will be easier than ever to relapse due to the overwhelming nature of trying to adjust back to normal life after serving their sentence. The problem of funds arise when dealing with the United States prison and jail systems. Some Americans believe we invest too much money into our correctional facilities. Considering the rates that continue to grow due to those who are incarcerated, money has to be put into continuing to renovate these facilities in order to work for the growing number of inmates. On the other hand, some believe that more money could be put into these facilities, an example being the psychological help. If the number of mental health institutions continues to decline, and we are putting the people that need serious help into jails and prisons then the resources needed to help the root of the problem for most convicts should be revamped. If America was focused on improving permanently instead of temporally when it comes to the mentally ill inside our correctional facilities, then the rates of recidivism, or the rate of jail/prison re-entry may decrease as a result as well. If this information is taken into consideration we may see decreasing incarceration rates, as opposed to what seems to be our doomed future.  Mental health care in prisons and jails  Psychologists report that one in every eight prisoners were receiving some mental health therapy or counseling services by the middle of the year in 2000. Inmates are generally screened at admission and depending on the severity of the mental illness they are placed in either general confinement or specialized facilities. Inmates can self report mental illness if they feel it is necessary. In the middle of the year in 2000, inmates self-reported that State prisons held 191,000 mentally ill inmates. A 2011 survey of 230 correctional mental health service providers from 165 state correctional facilities found that 83% of facilities employed at least one psychologist and 81% employed at least one psychiatrist. The study also found that 52% of mentally ill offenders voluntarily received mental health services, 24% were referred by staff, and 11% were mandated by a court to receive services. Although 64% of providers of mental health services reported feeling supported by prison administration and 71% were involved in continuity of care after release from prison, 65% reported being dissatisfied with funding. Only 16% of participants reported offering vocational training, and the researchers noted that although risk/need/responsivity theory has been shown to reduce the risk for recidivism (or committing another crime after being released), it is unknown whether it is incorporated into mental health services in prisons and jails. A 2005 article by researcher Terry A. Kupers noted that male prisoners tend to underreport emotional problems and don't request help until a crisis, and that prison fosters an environment of toxic masculinity, which increases resistance to psychotherapy. A 2017 report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics noted that 54.3% of prisoners and 35% of jail inmates who had past 30-day serious psychological distress has received mental health treatment since admission to the current facility; and 63% of prisoners and 44.5% of jail inmates with a history of a mental health problem said they had received mental health treatment since admission. Finally, the book Criminalizing the Seriously Mentally Ill: The Abuse of Jails As Mental Hospitals points out that 20% of jails have no mental health resources. In addition, small jails are less likely to have access to mental health resources and are more likely to hold individuals with mental illnesses without charges brought against them. Jails in richer areas are more likely to have access to mental health resources, and jails with more access to mental health resources also dealt less with medication refusal.Torrey, et al. 1998, p. 23. Recidivism Research shows that rates of recidivism, or re-entry into prison, are not significantly higher for mentally ill offenders. A 2004 study found that although 77% of mentally ill offenders studied were arrested or charged with a new crime within the 27-55 month follow-up period, when compared with the general population, \\"our mentally ill inmates were neither more likely nor more serious recidivists than general population inmates.\\" In contrast, a 2009 study that examined the incarceration history of those in Texas Department of Criminal Justice facilities found that \\"Texas prison inmates with major psychiatric disorders were far more likely to have had previous incarcerations compared with inmates without a serious mental illness.\\" In the discussion, the researchers noted that their study's results differed from most research on this subject, and hypothesized that this novelty could be due to specific conditions within the state of Texas. A 1991 study by L. Feder noted that although mentally ill offenders were significantly less like to receive support from family and friends upon release from prison, mentally ill offenders were actually less likely to be revoked on parole. However, for nuisance arrests, mentally ill offenders were less likely to have the charges dropped, although they were more likely to have charges dropped for drug arrests. In both cases, mentally ill offenders were more likely to be tracked into mental health. Finally, there were no significant differences in charges for violent arrests. Solitary confinement A broad range of scholarly research maintains that mentally ill offenders are disproportionately represented in solitary confinement and are more vulnerable to the adverse psychological effects of solitary confinement. Due to differing schemes of classification, empirical data on the makeup of inmates in segregated housing units can be difficult to obtain, and estimates of the percentage of inmates in solitary confinement who are mentally ill range from nearly a third, to 11% (with a \\"major mental disorder\\"), to 30% (from a study conducted in Washington), to \\"over half\\" (from a study conducted in Indiana), depending on how mental illness is determined, where the study is conducted, and other differences in methodology. Researchers J. Metzner and J. Fellner note that mentally ill offenders in solitary confinement \\"all too frequently\\" require crisis care or psychiatric hospitalization, and that \\"many simply won't get better as long as they are isolated.\\" Researchers T. L. Hafemeister and J. George note that mentally ill offenders in isolation are at higher risk for psychiatric injury, self-harm and suicide. A 2014 study that analyzed data from medical records in the New York City jail systemKaba, et. al. 2014, p. 442. found that while self-harm was significantly correlated with having a serious mental illness regardless of whether or not an inmate was in solitary confinement, inmates with serious mental illness in solitary confinement under 18 years of age accounted for the majority of acts of self-harm studied.Kaba, et. al. 2014, p. 445. When brought before federal courts, judges have prohibited or curtailed this practice, and many organizations that deal with human rights, including the United Nations, have condemned it. In addition, scholars argue the conditions of solitary confinement make it much more difficult to deliver proper psychiatric care. According to researchers J. Metzner and J. Fellner, \\"Mental health services in segregation units are typically limited to psychotropic medication, a health care clinician stopping at the cell front to ask how the prisoner is doing (i.e., mental health rounds), and occasional meetings in private with a clinician.\\" One study in the American Journal of Public Health claimed that health care professionals must \\"frequently\\" conduct consultation through a slit in a cell door or an open tier that provides no privacy. However, some researchers disagree with the scope of claims surrounding the psychological effects of solitary confinement. For example, in 2006 researchers G. D. Glancy and E. L. Murray conducted a literature review in which they claimed that many frequently-cited studies have methodological concerns, including researcher bias, the use of \\"volunteer nonprisoners, naturalistic experiments, or case reports, case series, and anecdotes\\" and concluded \\"there is little evidence to suggest the majority...kept in SC...experience negative mental health effects.\\" However, they did support claims that inmates with preexisting mental illnesses are more vulnerable and do suffer adverse effects. In their conclusion they claim \\"we should therefore be concerned about those with pre-existing mental illness who are housed in segregation because there is nowhere else to put them within the correctional system.\\"  Community Standpoint & Outcome  Social stigma regarding this issue is significant due to the public‚Äôs outlook and perception of mental health, where some may not recognize it as a health factor that needs to be addressed. It is for this reason that some may avoid or deny the assistance being offered to them, thus further suppressing feelings and experiences that eventually need to be dealt with. The NCBH notes that about one-third of Americans, or 38%, state that they worry of their peers and family members judging them if they were to seek mental help. Without the presence of these facilities within communities, there is an outcome of mentally ill individuals carrying on with no preventative treatment or care to keep the severity of their condition to a healthy level. Just about 2 million of these individuals go to jail each year, moreover, data shows that 15% of men and 30% of women who are taken to prison, do in fact have a serious mental health condition. The National Alliance on Mental Illness further looks into the results of decreased mental health services, and they found that for many, individuals do ultimately become homeless, or they find themselves in emergency rooms, as a result of inaccessibility to mental services and support groups. Statistics show that about 83% of jail inmates did not have access to needed treatment, prior to their incarceration, within their community which is why some may be rearrested for crimes as a way to return to some form of assistance. The Marshall Project has gathered data regarding those being treated in jail, and what they found was that the Federal Bureau of Prisons implicated a new policy to be initiated that was meant to improve the care for inmates with mental-health issues. It ultimately led to decreasing the number of inmates who were categorized as needing higher care levels by more than 35%. After this policy change, the Marshall Project noted the steady decline since May 2014 of inmates receiving treatment for a mental illness. Research shows that within recent years, those with ‚Äúserious psychotic disorders, especially when untreated, can be more likely to commit a violent crime‚Äù. Legal aspects Current Laws The Federal Bureau of Prisons have claimed to have made policy changes, but those changes only apply to the rules within the system, and they did not fund resources to carry those new implementations out. It should also be noted that within the prison system, states have laws and responsibilities to ensure as well, one being within the Eighth amendment that requires prisoners' medical needs to consistently be met. The Prison Litigation Reform Act upholds this right in federal court cases. As of late December 2018, the First Step Act (S 756) was signed into law as a way to a way to reduce recidivism and provide overall improvements to the conditions faced within federal prisons, as well as working to reduce the mandatory sentences given. Although, this Act primarily applies to about 225.000, or 10%, of individuals in federal prisons and jails, whereas this reform may not be applied to those in state prisons and jails. Some of the provisions that result from this act include staff training as to how to identify and assist those suffering from a mental illness, and providing improved, accessible treatment regarding drug abuse with programs like medication-assisted treatment. The implementation of significantly more Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics has been discussed as a solution to the issue of mental health in the prison system as well. Its primary goal is to cater to the needs of its specific communities and expand access to mental health treatment for everyone. The claims of an organization like this is to reduce criminal justice costs, as well as hospital readmissions, and, once again, to reduce recidivism. They strive to treat individuals with mental illness early on, rather than allowing them to carry on without professional care and general support. Emergency detention One major area of legal concern is the emergency detention of the non-criminal mentally ill in jails while waiting for formal procedures for involuntary hospitalization. Twenty- five states and the District of Columbia have laws that specifically address this practice; eight of these states, as well as D. C., explicitly forbid it. Seventeen states, on the other hand, explicitly allow it. Within this set, the criteria and circumstances necessary differ by state, and most states limit the detention periods in jails to one to three days.Torrey, et al. 1998, 66. One distinguishing factor of this practice is that it is often initiated by a non-medical professional such as a police officer. In many states, especially those in which a non-public official such as a medical health professional or concerned citizen can initiate the detention, a judge or magistrate is required to approve it before or soon after the initiation.Torrey, et al. 1998, 67. When emergency detention in jails has been brought to court, judges have generally agreed that the practice itself is not unconstitutional.Torrey, et al. 1998, 66. One notable exception was Lynch v. Baxley; however, later cases, particularly Boston v. Lafayette County, Mississippi, have connected the ruling of unconstitutionality in that case with the conditions of the jails themselves rather than the fact that they were jails. That being said, the Supreme Court of Illinois has stated that this practice is unconstitutional if the person being detained doesn't pose an imminent threat to himself or others. Supreme court cases Several landmark Supreme Court cases, notably Estelle v. Gamble, have established the constitutional right of prison inmates to mental health treatment. Estelle v. Gamble determined that \\"deliberate indifference to serious medical needs\\" of prisoners was a violation of the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. This case was the first time the phrase \\"deliberate indifference\\" was used; it is now a legal term. In order to determine \\"serious medical need\\" later cases would use tests such as the treatment being mandated by a physician or an obvious need to a layman. On the other hand, other cases, notably McGukin v. Smith, used much stricter terms, and in 1993 researchers Henry J. Steadman and Joseph J. Cocozza commented that \\"serious medical need\\" had little definitional clarity. Langley v. Coughlin involved a prisoner \\"regularly isolated without proper screening or care\\" and clarified that a single, distinctive act is not necessary to constitute deliberate indifference but rather \\"if seriously ill inmates are consistently made to wait for care while their condition deteriorates, or if diagnoses are haphazard and records minimally adequate then, over time, the mental state of deliberate indifference may be attributed to those in charge.\\" The landmark case Washington v. Harper determined that although inmates do have an interest in and the right to refusal of treatment, this can be overridden without judicial process even if the inmate is competent provided there this act is \\"reasonably related to legitimate penological interest\\". Washington's internal process for determining this need was seen as affording due process. In contrast, in Breads v. Moehrle, the forcible injection of drugs in a jail was not upheld because sufficient procedures were not taken to ensure \\"substantive determination of need\\".  Court cases  George Daniel, a mentally ill man on Alabama's death row was arrested and charged with capital murder. In jail, George became acutely psychotic and couldn't speak in complete sentences. Daniel, had been on death row until several years later, Lawyer Bryan Stevenson uncovered the truth of the doctor who lied about the examination of Daniels mental illness. Daniel's trial was then overturned and he has been in a mental institution since. Another mentally ill man, Avery Jenkins, was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. Throughout Jenkins's childhood, he had been in and out of foster homes and developed a serious mental illness. Jenkins erratic behavior didn't change, so his foster mother decided to get rid of him by tying him to a tree and left him there. Around the age of sixteen he was left homeless and started to experience psychotic episodes. At the age of twenty, Jenkins had wandered into a strange house and stabbed a man to death as he perceived it to being a demon. He then was sentenced to death and spent several years in prison as if he had been sane and responsible for his actions. Jenkins then got off death row and was put into a mental institution. In the past, overall living and treatment conditions within US prisons were not up to par, which can be seen through the details and points made by the Coleman v. Brown case that went to trial in 1995. The district court judge in charge of this case, ultimately recognized the systemic failure within the system to properly care for and provide resources to mentally ill inmates. These individuals were not receiving treatment prior to prison, and were sent there with expectations from others that they would be receiving treatment there, but that expectation was not fulfilled. With Coleman v. Brown, a special court, including three judges that can make final decisions on whether or not a problem is significant enough to enact change, came to the conclusion that overcrowding was in fact a reason for poor conditions in prisons, therefore they called for a reduction in the prison population to partially relieve said issue. Justice Alito at this time questioned whether the solution of reduction was actually helpful, when they could be looking into constructing additional prison medical and mental health facilities. Although, the decision did not take care of the living conditions that were problematic before and even after the case. It has been noted that psychotic prisoners were often held in small, narrow essentially restricted areas in which standing on their own secretions was common. As far as actual mental health treatment conditions, the waiting time to even receive care could take up to a year, and when they finally reached that date, the screenings for such lacked privacy for those being evaluated as the spaces were often shared by several physicians at a time. A more recent case that has been discussed, is that involving previous inmate John Rudd where he was being held at a federal prison in West Virginia as of 2017. Rudd had a history of mental health disorders consisting of posttraumatic stress disorder, as well as schizophrenia. He was evaluated and diagnosed by a doctor as early as 1992. In 2017, he stopped taking his psychiatric medication, then proceeded to inform staff of his intentions to take his own life. Staff proceeded to put him in a suicide watch cell, where he would physically and violently hurt himself. Staff injected him with haloperidol, an anti-psychotic drug, to treat him, but after some time they concluded that Rudd was not ill enough to receive proper, regular treatment and continued to categorize him as a level one inmate, meaning no significant mental health needs. Although they were aware of his pre-existing conditions, the prison staff claimed those were resolved and simply adjusted it to Rudd having an antisocial personality disorder. Prison staff in general, have also been experiencing issues for various years now. Previously in the 1990s, just about one-third of positions went unfilled for mental health staff, and it became increasingly impactful on inmates when the vacancy rates for psychiatrists reached 50% and up. Staffing shortage is still seen today in which some counselors can be pulled and asked to serve as a corrections officers for the time being. This situation had worsened due to the Trump administration and the hiring freeze that was meant to reduce costs. Rudd, now out of prison and receiving counseling and taking medication, speaks on triggers within the prison environment that are not in any way healthy for those who are mentally ill.

Mauna Kea is considered by some Hawaiians to be the most sacred mountain of Native Hawaiian religion and culture. Native Hawaiian cultural practitioners have repeatedly failed in court to prove that these practices predate 1893, which is the threshold for protection under Hawaii State law. Protests began locally within the state of Hawaii on October 7, 2014 but went global within weeks of the April 2, 2015 arrest of 31 people who had blockaded the roadway to keep construction crews off the summit. The TMT, a ground-based, large segmented mirror reflecting telescope grew from astronomers' prioritization in 2000 of a thirty-meter telescope to be built within the decade. Mauna Kea was announced as TMT's preferred site in 2009. Opposition to the project began shortly after the announcement of Mauna Kea as the chosen site out of 5 proposals. While opposition against the observatories on Mauna Kea has been ongoing since the first telescope, built by the University of Hawaii, this protest may be the most vocal. The project was expected to be completed by 2024, nearly simultaneously with the 39-meter Extremely Large Telescope being built in Chile; however, on December 2, 2015, the Supreme Court of Hawaii invalidated the TMT's building permits. The court ruled that due process was not followed. The TMT corporation then removed all construction equipment and vehicles from Mauna Kea, and re-applied for a new permit, meant to respect the Supreme Court's ruling. This was granted on September 28, 2018. On October 30, 2018, the Court validated the new construction permit.Hawaii top court approves controversial Thirty Meter Telescope BBC News, 2018-10-31. Recent polling has showed that public support for construction among all groups has dropped since the start of the 2019 protests, to 50 percent support statewide. There is also significant opposition among native Hawaiians, with polls showing 39 percent supporting the project in 2016 to 27 percent supporting in September 2019. Notable native Hawaiian supporters include Peter Apo, sitting trustee of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, and leading University of Hawaii professor and astronomer the late Dr. Paul Coleman, who, in 2015 noted \\"Hawaiians are just so tied to astronomy I cannot, in any stretch of the imagination, think that TMT is something that our ancestors wouldn't just jump on and embrace\\" In July 2019, 300 protestors gathered in support of the TMT project outside the Hawaii State Capitol in Honolulu. Background Development of Mauna Kea observatories After studying photos for NASA's Apollo program that contained greater detail than any ground based telescope, Gerard Kuiper began seeking an arid site for infrared studies. While he first began looking in Chile, he also made the decision to perform tests in the Hawaiian Islands. Tests on Maui's HaleakalƒÅ were promising but the mountain was too low in the inversion layer and often covered by clouds. On the \\"Big Island\\" of Hawaii, Mauna Kea is considered the highest island mountain in the world, measuring roughly 33,000 feet from the base deep under the Pacific Ocean. While the summit is often covered with snow the air itself is extremely dry. Kuiper began looking into the possibility of an observatory on Mauna Kea. After testing, he discovered the low humidity was perfect for infrared signals. He persuaded then-governor John A. Burns, to bulldoze a dirt road to the summit where he built a small telescope on Puu Poliahu, a cinder cone peak. The peak was the second highest on the mountain with the highest peak being holy ground, so Kuiper avoided it. Next, Kuiper tried enlisting NASA to fund a larger facility with a large telescope, housing and other needed structures. NASA, in turn decided to make the project open to competition. Professor of physics John Jefferies of the University of Hawaii placed a bid on behalf of the university. Jefferies had gained his reputation through observations at Sacramento Peak Observatory. The proposal was for a two-meter telescope to serve both the needs of NASA and the university. While large telescopes are not ordinarily awarded to universities without well established astronomers, Jefferies and UH were awarded the NASA contract, infuriating Kuiper who felt that \\"his mountain\\" had been \\"stolen\\" from \\"him\\". Kuiper would abandon his site (the very first telescope on Mauna Kea) over the competition and begin work in Arizona on a different NASA project. After considerable testing by Jefferies' team, the best locations were determined to be near the summit at the top of the cinder cones. Testing also determined Mauna Kea to be superb for nighttime viewing due to many factors including the thin air, constant trade winds and being surrounded by sea. Jefferies would build a 2.24 meter telescope with the State of Hawaii agreeing to build a reliable, all weather roadway to the summit. Building began in 1967 and first light seen in 1970. Observatory opposition Although polls, some of them highly criticized https://www.hawaiitribune-herald.com/2019/08/14/hawaii- news/reactions-to-poll-highlight-division-over-tmt/, indicate that a majority of Hawaii settlers support the Thirty Meter Telescope, opposition to the project and other observatories has existed since 1964. In Honolulu, the governor and legislature, enthusiastic about the development, set aside an even larger area for the observatory causing opposition in the city of Hilo. Native kƒÅnaka  ª≈çiwi believed the entire site was sacred and that developing the mountain, even for science, would spoil the area. Environmentalists were concerned about rare native bird populations and other citizens of Hilo were concerned about the sight of the domes from the city. Using town hall meetings, Jefferies emphasized the economic advantage and prestige the island would receive. Over the years, the opposition to the observatories may have become the most visible example of the conflict science has encountered over access and use of environmental and culturally significant sites. Opposition to development grew shortly after expansion of the observatories commenced. Once access was opened up by the roadway to the summit, skiers began using it for recreation and objected when the road was closed as a precaution against vandalism when the telescopes were being built. Hunters voiced concerns as did the Hawaiian Audubon Society who were supported by Governor George Ariyoshi. The Audubon Society objected to further development on Mauna Kea over concerns to habitat of the endangered palila, an endemic species to only specific parts of this mountain. The bird is the last of the finch billed honeycreepers existing on the island. Over 50% of native bird species had been killed off due to loss of habitat from early western settlers or the introduction of non native species competing for resources. Hunters and sportsmen were concerned that the hunting of feral animals would be affected by the telescope operations. None of these concerns proved accurate. A \\"Save Mauna Kea\\" movement was inspired by the proliferation of telescopes with opposition believing development of the mountain to be sacrilegious. Native Hawaiian non- profit groups such as Kahea, whose goals are the protection of cultural heritage and the environment, oppose development on Mauna Kea as a sacred space to the Hawaiian religion. Today, Mauna Kea hosts the world's largest location for telescope observations in infrared and submillimeter astronomy. The land itself is protected by the US Historical Preservation Act due to its significance to Hawaiian culture but still allowed development. Outrigger and Thirty Meter Telescope proposals Further development of the Mauna Kea observatories is still opposed by environmental groups and some Native Hawaiians. A 2006 proposal for the Outrigger Telescopes to become extensions of the Keck Observatory was canceled after a judges determination that a full environmental impact statement must be prepared before any further development of the site. The \\"outrigger\\" would have linked the Keck I and Keck II telescopes. Environmental groups and Native Hawaiian activist were a lot stronger at this time than in the past but NASA went ahead with the proposal for lack of an alternate site. The group Mauna Kea Anaina Hou made several arguments against the development including that Mauna Kea was a sacred mountain to Native Hawaiians where many deities had lived, and that the cinder cone being proposed as the site was holy in Hawaiian tradition as a burial site for a demi-god. The group raised several other concerns such as environmental over native insects, the question of Ceded lands and an audit report, critical of the mountain's management. Kealoha Pisciotta, a former Mauna Kea Observatory employee, testifies at a State hearing in 2011 The Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) is a proposed extremely large, segmented mirror telescope, planned for the summit of Mauna Kea. It is now the focal point of further development of the observatory site, with a current ongoing legal battle in the Hawaii court system. The proposal continues to spawn a great deal of controversy over the use of the site for science. The TMT project is a response to recommendation in 2000 from the US National Academy of Sciences that a thirty-meter telescope be a top priority, and that it be built within the decade. Urgency in construction is due to the competitive nature of science with the European-Extremely Large Telescope also under construction. The two projects are also complementary, in that the EELT would only view the Southern Celestial Hemisphere, while Mauna Kea offers the best views of the Northern Celestial Hemisphere. However, Mauna Kea's summit is considered the most sacred of all the mountains in Hawaii to many Native Hawaiian people. Native Hawaiian activists such as Kealoha Pisciotta, a former employee of the Mauna Kea Observatories, have raised concerns over the perceived desecration of Mauna Kea posed by TMT construction and presence. Pisciotta, a former telescope systems specialist technician at James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, is one of several people suing to stop the construction and is also director of Mauna Kea Anaina Hou. As of April, 2015, two separate legal appeals were still pending. The 1998 study Mauna Kea Science Reserve and Hale Pohaku Complex Development Plan Update stated that \\"... nearly all the interviewees and all others who participated in the consultation process (Appendices B and C) called for a moratorium on any further development on the summit of Mauna Kea\\". Many native Hawaiians and environmentalists are opposed to any further telescopes. The Hawaii Board of Land and Natural Resources conditionally approved the Mauna Kea site for the TMT in February 2011. While the approval has been challenged, the Board officially approved the site following a hearing on April 12, 2013. Indigenous peoples rights The issue of native peoples, their religious freedom and rights in regards to authority for large science-based projects has become a major issue to contend with. Mt. Graham had an issue with the sanctity of the mountain raised by activists. Observatories have succeeded in being built, but only after protracted and expensive litigation and effort. Blockade and protests cultural practitioner, Joshua Lanakila Mangauil interrupted the TMT ground breaking on October 7, 2014 Roadway blockade and ground breaking interruption On October 7, 2014 the groundbreaking for the telescope was being live streamed via webcam. The proceedings were interrupted when the official caravan encountered several dozen demonstrators picketing and chanting in the middle of the roadway. A planned ceremony at the base of the mountain was scheduled by the group, Mauna Kea Anaina Hou, in opposition of the telescope and in a press release dated that day, the organization Sacred Mauna Kea stated: \\"Native Hawaiians and non-Hawaiians will gather for a peaceful protest against the Astronomy industry and the State of Hawaii‚Äôs ground-breaking ceremony for a thirty-meter telescope (TMT) on the summit of Mauna Kea.\\" Several members traveled up the mountain and were stopped by police, where they laid down in the road and blocked the caravan. The nonviolent protest did not stop or block any people but when the ceremony for the ground breaking began, protesters interrupted the blessing, stopping the proceedings as well as the groundbreaking. That same day in California, protesters demonstrated outside the headquarters of the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation in Palo Alto, CA. Second Mauna Kea blockade and arrests, 2015 Beginning in late March 2015 demonstrators halted construction crews near the visitors center, again by blocking access of the road to the summit of the mountain. Heavy equipment had already been placed near the site. Daniel Meisenzahl, a spokesman for the University of Hawaii, stated that the 5 tractors trailers of equipment that were moved up the mountain the day before had alerted protesters that began organizing the demonstrations. Kamahana Kealoha of the group Sacred Mauna Kea stated that over 100 demonstrators had traveled up to the summit to camp overnight, to be joined by more protesters in the early morning to blockade crews. On April 2, 2015, 300 protesters were gathered near the visitor's center where 12 people were arrested. 11 more protesters were arrested at the summit. Protesters, ranging in age from 27 to 75 years of age were handcuffed and led away by local police. Among the major concerns of the protest groups is whether the land appraisals were done accurately and that Native Hawaiians were not consulted. When the trucks were finally allowed to pass, protesters followed the procession up the summit. A project spokesman said that work had begun after arrests were made and the road cleared. Among the arrests was professional surfer and former candidate for mayor of Kauai, Dustin Barca. A number of celebrity activists of Native Hawaiian descent, both local and national, began campaigning over social media, including Game of Thrones star Jason Momoa who urged Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) to join the protests with him on top of Mauna Kea. Construction was halted for one week at the request of Hawaii state governor David Ige on April 7, 2015 after the protest on Mauna Kea continued and demonstrations began to appear over the state. Project Manager, Gary Sanders stated that TMT agreed to the one-week stop for continued dialogue. Kealoha Pisciotta, president of Mauna Kea Anaina Hou viewed the development as positive but said opposition to the project would continue. Pisciotta also stated that the protests would continue to be within a Kapu Aloha; \\"moving in Aloha with steadfast determination\\". Temporary halt Governor Ige announced that the project was being temporarily postponed until at least April 20, 2015. In response to the growing protests the TMT Corporation's division of Hawaii Community Affairs launched an internet microsite, updating content regularly. The company also took to social media to respond to the opposition's growing momentum by hiring public relations firms to assist as the company's voice in the islands. TMT sublease payments on hold following order for a contested case hearing. National and international demonstrations Demonstrators call themselves protectors, not protestors The protests sparked statewide, national as well as international attention to Hawaiian culture, Mauna Kea and the 45-year history of 13 other telescopes on the mountain. At the University of Hawaii Manoa, hundreds of students lined the streets for blocks and, one by one, they passed the stones from the student taro patch of the university's Center on Hawaiian Studies down the human chain to the lawn in front of the office university president, David Lassner, where the stones were used to build an ahu (the altar of a heiau) as a message to the university. On April 21, 2015, hundreds of protesters filled the streets of Honolulu protesting against the TMT.  2019 demonstrations  The construction of the TMT was scheduled to restart on July 15, 2019. Shortly after sunrise on July 13, 2019, the Royal Order of Kamehameha, along with Mauna Kea protectors began the process of designating Pu ªuhuluhulu as a pu ªuhonua which, historically, has served as a space of protection during contentious times. The Pu ªuhonua o Pu ªuhuluhulu boundaries were secured through ceremony and the approval of the Royal Order of Kamehameha, establishing a site of protection, sanctuary and refuge for Mauna Kea protectors. Situated on a 38-acre conservation district directly across from the Mauna Kea access road, Pu ªuhonua o Pu ªuhuluhulu have access to food, medical supplies, education, cultural practices and ceremony. On July 14, 2019, an online petition titled \\"The Immediate Halt to the Construction of the TMT Telescope\\" was posted on Change.org. The online petition has currently gathered over 278,057 signatures worldwide. On 15 July, protestors blocked the access road to the mountain preventing the planned construction from commencing. On July 16, thirteen astronomical facilities on the mountain stopped activities and evacuated their personnel. On July 17, 33 protestors were arrested, all of whom were k≈´puna, or elders, as the blockage of the access road continued. The days actions were described in a court declaration filed in connection to a Mauna Kea access case by Hawaii County Police, which claims that there was a \\"significant risk\\" that certain protesters would \\"respond with violence\\" if officers forcefully separated protesters blocking the road. A Native Hawaiian Legal Corporation legal observer there that day claims that the report over embellished the belief that there was a threat. More than 1,000 people marched in Waikiki and gathered in Kapiolani Park on July 21, 2019 in protest of the project. The protest continued into August 2019 at the entrance of the Mauna Kea access road, in front of Pu'u Huluhulu on Hawaii Route 200.Hundreds gather for prayer vigil (Hawaii Tribune-Herald, 2019) It was announced on August 9, that astronomers at other Mauna Kea observatories would return to work after halting for many weeks in response to the gathering protesters and activists. However, a former systems specialist for one of the facilities claimed it was wrong to blame the demonstrators stating: \\"They chose to close down for fear of protesters who are unarmed and nonviolent.\\" On 19 December, Governor David Ige announced at a press conference that he was reopening the access road and withdrawing law enforcement from the mountain . TMT representatives had informed him that they are not ready to start construction in the foreseeable future. The announcement came a day after the Hawaii County Council unanimously rejected a proposal by Mayor Harry Kim that would have authorized the county to accept reimbursement from the state for providing law enforcement on the mountain. Permitting On December 2, 2015, the Supreme Court of Hawaii invalidated the TMT's building permits, ruling that due process was not followed when the Board of Land and Natural Resources approved the permit before the contested case hearing. The TMT company chairman stated: \\"T.M.T. will follow the process set forth by the state.\\" On December 16, the TMT corporation began removal of all construction equipment and vehicles from Mauna Kea. As noted above, the Supreme Court of the State of Hawaii ultimately approved the permit following a lengthy contested hearing case. Both the contested hearing case and the Hawaii Supreme Court rejected the arguments asserted by the protesters, finding them to be without merit. On September 28, 2017, the Hawaii Board of Land and Natural Resources approved the TMT's Conservation District Use Permit.09/28/17 ‚Äì Board of Land and Natural Resources Approves TMT Permit On October 30, 2018, the Supreme Court of Hawaii validated the construction permit.  Reactions  The protests have caused many to voice their support for either the telescope being built, or for its construction on Mauna Kea to be halted. Many of the more public support for either side has caused massive controversy and discussion between science and native culture.  Against protesters  In 2015 University of California astronomers sent out a mass email urging other astronomers to support the TMT through a petition written by a native Hawaiian science student. Concern was raised over the content of the email, with the wording of \\"a horde of native Hawaiians\\" to describe the protesters considered to be problematic and potentially racist. Hawaii based businesses that support the telescope were named in a boycott that was popularized on social media. Businesses included were KTA Super Stores and HPM Building Supply.  Support for protesters  Scientists have taken to Twitter and other social media platforms to voice their support publicly for the protest using #ScientistsforMaunaKea, in which they highlight their field and why they feel that the TMT is not needed on the mountain. An open letter was also published and signed by nearly 1,000 members of the scientific community that takes no position on the siting of TMT on Maunakea, but denounces \\"the criminalization of the protectors on Maunakea\\". In an online petition, a group of Canadian academics, scientists, and students have called on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau together with Industry Minister Navdeep Bains and Science Minister Kirsty Duncan to divest Canadian funding from the project. Native Hawaiian academics from various fields have also voiced their opposition to the telescope and participated in the protests themselves, such as Oceanographer Rosie Alegado. On July 20, 2019 an online petition titled \\"A Call to Divest Canada's Research Funding for the Thirty Meter Telescope on Mauna Kea\\" has been posted on Change.org. Several celebrities have supported the protest. Some, such as Damian Marley, Jason Momoa, Dwayne Johnson, Jack Johnson and Ezra Miller traveled to the location and participated in the protests. Others, such as Leonardo DiCaprio, Bruno Mars, Emilia Clarke, Nathalie Emmanuel, Rosario Dawson, Jill Wagner, Jai Courtney, Kelly Slater and Madison Bumgarner have used social media to promote the cause.

(2008). \\"Marine Sanitation Devices.\\" Code of Federal Regulations, USCG has certified three kinds of marine sanitation devices. Type I A Type I MSD has a flow-through discharge design. The sewage is broken down and processed through the use of chlorination and/or maceration. The bacteria count per one hundred milliliters of water must be less than one thousand. Discharges from Type I MSDs must not have evident floating solids. Type I MSDs also rely heavily on chlorination and maceration to break down solids and kill any bacteria present.McLemore, A. (2011). The engineering cruise notebook: A study guide for the engineering students of the Training Ship Golden Bear. Vallejo, CA. Type II Type II MSDs are similar to Type I, with a flow-through discharge. However, the sewage is broken up through the use of aerobic bacteria or some other biological digestion process. The bacteria count found in one hundred milliliters of water produced from this system cannot be greater than two hundred. Type III Type III MSDs have a different design compared to Type I and Type II. It typically consists of a large storage tank that holds treated or untreated sewage that is held and released when the vessel returns to port. In port, the Type III discharge is transferred to a wastewater treatment faciliiy. However, Type III MSDs can also consist of a holding tank with advanced technologies, including but not limited to incineration, recirculation, and composting. The residuals are not discharged to water, but are transferred when the vessel is in port. Laws and regulations Under IMO, or International Maritime Organization, MARPOL 73/78, also known as the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution From Ships (\\"Marpol\\" is short for marine pollution and 73/78 short for the years 1973 and 1978.) There are a total of six annexes that compose Marpol. Annex IV deals with the pollution of sewage by ships. In Annex IV, there are a total of 11 regulations regarding the laws and regulations surrounding sewage discharge and treatment plants on board. It wasn't until the United States implemented Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships.Annex IV of MARPOL 73/78 Regulations for the Prevention of Pollution by Sewage from Ships. (n.d.). Retrieved April 8, 2015, from US regulations In the US, no vessel with a toilet on board may be operated unless there is a Coast Guard- approved MSD aboard the vessel which is fully functioning. The Clean Water Act (CWA) prohibits the discharge of untreated sewage into waters of the United States. There are also restrictions on vessel manufactures and operators.United States. Clean Water Act, sec. 312, . Manufacturers may not sell any vessel equipped with toilet facilities unless there is an operable Type II or Type III MSD, or an operable Type I device on a vessel that is less than . No person may operate the vessel unless there is an operable Type II or Type III MSD or an operable Type I device. If the vessel is in a water body the discharge of untreated or treated sewage is prohibited by EPA, the vessel operator must secure the device. =No-Discharge Zones= The CWA has another means of addressing sewage discharges, through establishment of no- discharge zones (NDZs) for vessel sewage. A state may completely prohibit the discharge of both treated and untreated sewage from all vessels with installed toilets into some or all waters over which it has jurisdiction (up to from land). To create a no-discharge zone to protect waters from sewage discharges by vessels, the state must apply to EPA under one of three categories. # NDZ based on the need for higher level of water quality, and the state demonstrates that adequate pumpout facilities for safe and sanitary removal and treatment of sewage from all vessels are reasonably available. As of 2017, this category of designation has been used for 72 areas representing part or all of the waters of 26 states, including a number of inland states. # NDZ for special waters found to have a particular environmental importance (e.g., to protect environmentally sensitive areas such as shellfish beds or coral reefs); it is not necessary for the state to show pumpout availability. This category of designation has been used twice (state waters within the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary and the Boundary Waters Canoe area of Minnesota). # NDZ to prohibit the discharge of sewage into waters that are drinking water intake zones; it is not necessary for the state to show pumpout availability. This category of designation has been used to protect part of the Hudson River in New York. =Solid waste= Ship discharges of solid waste are governed by two laws. Title I of the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA) applies to cruise ships and other vessels and makes it illegal to transport garbage from the United States for the purpose of dumping it into ocean waters without a permit or to dump any material transported from a location outside the United States into U.S. territorial seas or the contiguous zone (within from shore) or ocean waters.United States. Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act. EPA is responsible for issuing permits that regulate the disposal of materials at sea (except for dredged material disposal, for which the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is responsible). Beyond waters that are under U.S. jurisdiction, no MPRSA permit is required for a ship to discharge solid waste. The routine discharge of effluent incidental to the propulsion of vessels is explicitly exempted from the definition of dumping in the MPRSA. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) and its regulations implements U.S.-ratified provisions of MARPOL. APPS prohibits the discharge of all garbage within of shore, certain types of garbage within offshore, and plastic anywhere. It applies to all vessels, whether seagoing or not, regardless of flag, operating in U.S. navigable waters and the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). It is administered by the Coast Guard, which carries out inspection programs to insure the adequacy of port facilities to receive offloaded solid waste. History EPA first issued its MSD regulations in 1976 under CWA authority. The intent of the law is to prevent the spread of disease, keep the oxygen content in water bodies at a healthy level, and to maintain healthy waters in regards to appearance. Treatment The purpose of the MSD is to treat the incoming blackwater and graywater that accumulates on board a floating vessel. Graywater is water that drains directly from a shower, sink, or machinery located in the scullery. Normally, graywater is discharged directly overboard since it is not technically considered sewage and not damaging to the environment. However, in most ports around the world, discharge of fluids is strictly prohibited. To compensate for this situation, graywater piping is rerouted to the MSD. Blackwater is another word for sewage or human body wastes and wastes from toilets. According to the international maritime organization or the IMO, untreated sewage cannot be discharged overboard unless it is 12 nautical miles from the nearest land. Due to regulations issued by the IMO and the United States Maritime Administration (MARAD), every ship must have an approved marine sanitation device aboard their ship. Blackwater is therefore treated through a process that utilizes chlorination and/or biological treatment before being discharged overboard. Biological treatment In Type II MSDs, sewage is broken down through the use of a natural biological component. Usually this biological component is aerobic bacteria that occur in the media tank. Even though the sewage can have some aerobic bacteria naturally, a majority of the bacteria population is grown on mediums located within the media tank. Since aerobic bacteria require oxygen to live, some form of air pump is necessary to provide sufficient oxygen for the bacteria. This air pump can be a fan or roots blower connected to the tank. By providing sufficient air, most of the smell caused by sewage and anaerobic bacteria is eliminated.Dasch, E. (2003). Water: Science and issues. New York: Macmillan Reference USA. Chlorination and maceration In Type I MSDs, sewage is broken down usually through the use of chlorination and/ or maceration. The chlorination process is usually done within a large tank sometimes referred to as the contact chamber. By adding chlorine to the sewage, the effluent is sanitized and it is discharged from the MSD. The maceration process aboard ships is usually done using some form of machinery to crush and pulverize the incoming sewage. However, since a large portion of bacteria is still present in the macerated sewage, the sewage is considered untreated still. Due to this circumstance, maceration machinery is usually paired with some form of chlorination process in the same system. Very few places around the world allow the discharge of untreated sewage from a maceration process.Federal Marine Sanitation Device Regulations. (n.d.). Retrieved March 23, 2015, from http://www.dbw.ca.gov/pubs/FedMSD/index.htm Advanced water treatment Some vessels are equipped with advanced water treatment plants, also called Advanced Wastewater Purification (AWP) systems, instead of traditional MSDs. They are most commonly found on ships that sail in Alaskan waters and sometimes work in parallel with an onboard MSD. Royal Caribbean International, for example, havsinstalled AWP systems on its ships which treat wastewater using advanced technology. Royal Caribbean AWP systems include three types of water purification systems: Scanship, Hydroxyl/Headworks and Navalis. Scanship and Hydroxyl use biological treatment while the Navalis system primarily uses advanced oxidation and filtration methods. Scanship and Hydroxyl systems use bacterial to consume the waste while also utilizing a chemical in order to break down and remove solids. Scanship and Hydroxyl systems are very similar to water treatment plants based on shore. This involves a simple five stage process. The first stage involves a prefilter where screens removes heavy and noticeable solids from the waste influent. Then the wastewater is passed through a biological reactor which uses beneficial bacteria to further break down any solids. Next the influent is pumped through a flotation unit which removes floatable waste. Afterwards, the clean water is passed through polishing filters which make the water even cleaner. The last and final stage involves an ultraviolet light reactor which disinfects the water. The final product may then be dried, incinerated, stored, or discharged at sea with respect to international regulations. The Navalis AWP system utilizes a seven- stage process to treat wastewater.Advanced Wastewater Purification Systems. (2012, July 12). Retrieved April 6, 2015, from http://www.royalcaribbean.com/content/en_US/pdf/RCI_wastewater_pur.pdf The first stage involves wastewater entering the shaker screens which removes any noticeable solids. Then the wastewater is passed through an AET Roughing Reactor which help with chemical equalization and load. Then the influent is treated by a three-stage particle removal process which involve chemical flocculation, Hydraulic Separation, Tubular Filtration, and Ultra Filtration membranes. The waste influent is then passed through Oxidation Reactors which serve to oxidize pollutants and aid the production of carbon dioxide gas and water. The seventh and final stage consists of a powerful Ultraviolet Reactor in which the ozonated water is broken down into oxygen compounds that provide further treatment of the water. The leftover solids are then oxidized which provide safe bio-disposal or land based discharge if needed.

The film is a found footage satire film based on true accounts of the Satanic Panic in the 1980s-1990s, that is filmed in the \\"Devil Worshipping Capital of the Western World\\" Manitou Springs, Colorado.  Plot  The 'Satanic Panic' occurred in the United States in the 1980s and 1990s. Parents were stricken with fear that their children would fall into the hands of Satan, and begin his worship. In the fall of 2011, a major television network's new series, Investigating Urban Legends, began filming its first episode, set to air in the coming months. A fresh reporter, Taylor Skye (the shows Small Town Legends segment reporter), was sent out on location to Manitou Springs, Colorado. She was to interview local townspeople about the legend behind the town being labeled 'The Devil Worshipping Capital of the Western World.' Taylor was hired because she grew up near the small town. She hired a couple of her high school friends to help her with her debut on national television. Uncovering stories that lead to the possibility that satanic worship might still be occurring in the small town, lead Taylor to want to go deeper, and risk entering the possible gateway of Satanic worship in the town. Recording each step of their journey on multiple cameras, the threesome documented numerous possible satanic sites and sacrifices. However, on the last night of their discoveries in the wilderness, they uncovered something that was meant to be kept hidden. Every step of their chilling discovery is documented on camera, until the end. An end that has led to them being labeled as missing, the network canceling the show, and the deceitful cover up by the network that the story ever took place.

Description Hyalinobatrachium dianae is lime-green in color with transparent skin on its underside that allows one to view its internal organs. Its skin is uniformly colored without any noticeable light or dark variation. H. dianae has silvery-white irises with small dark spots. The species has bulging white eyes with horizontally-shaped black pupils that resemble those of the Muppet character Kermit the Frog. UPI remarked \\"Hyalinobatrachium dianae has the kind-hearted muppet's sad but lovable eyes and lanky limbs.\\" H. dianae is roughly long and lives in rainforest foliage of Costa Rica. It is found at elevations of in forest near the Caribbean coast. The known territory of the frog is mostly within protected conservation sites and thus the species is under minimal threat from human activity. H. dianae is distinguishable from other members of Hyalinobatrachium by its granular skin texture, its uniform color, and its advertisement call. DNA testing confirmed that it was a unique species; it was 12% divergent from its nearest relative, Hyalinobatrachium chirripoi. The advertisement call consists of \\"a single tonal long metallic whistle-like note with a duration of 0.40‚Äì0.55 s ... and a dominant frequency of 3.35‚Äì3.44 kHz\\". The frog's discoverers postulated that the frog went undetected in previous surveys of Costa Rica because its call is more like an insect than a typical frog. Discovery Hyalinobatrachium dianae was discovered in the Talamanca Mountains of Costa Rica, and described from six specimens collected in the area. The find was announced by researchers Brian Kubicki, Stanley Salazar, and Robert Puschendorf from the Costa Rican Amphibian Research Center in April 2015. It is the 14th species of glass frog known from Costa Rica, and 149th overall. Kubicki chose the specific name in honor of his mother, Janet Diane Kubicki. Due to the frog's resemblance to Kermit, the discovery attracted a substantial amount of attention in popular media. Tweets and news articles comparing H. dianae to Kermit helped images of the frog go viral. The attention prompted Disney to release an official interview where Kermit talked about H. dianae, saying, for example, \\"Googly eyes run in our family.\\" Commenting on the attention, Kubicki said he was surprised because he had not noticed the resemblance himself, but was \\"glad\\" that it \\"ended up getting so much international attention\\" which drew attention to \\"the amazing amphibians that are native to Costa Rica and the need to continue exploring and studying the country's amazing tropical forests.\\" References dianae Amphibians described in 2015 Amphibians of Costa Rica Endemic fauna of Costa Rica Kermit the Frog ","title":"Hyalinobatrachium dianae"},{"id":"46458888","text":"Martha Leeb Hadzi (1919‚Äì2003) was an art historian and an archeologist.

Hume took part in the 1815 Waterloo campaign, on the medical staff as a deputy inspector. He attended the Duchess of Richmond's ball on 15 June, the eve of the Battle of Quatre Bras. On 18 June, the day of the Battle of Waterloo, he amputated the legs of Sir Alexander Gordon, who died, and of Henry William Paget, 2nd Earl of Uxbridge, out of a number of operations. The following day he awoke the Duke with the casualty list. He also attended the dying William Howe De Lancey. William Heath of the 1829 duel between Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington (as lobster) and George Finch-Hatton, 10th Earl of Winchilsea; John Robert Hume, as the Duke's friend and physician, sits and spectates. Later life The University of St Andrews conferred on Hume the degree of M.D. on 12 January 1816, and on 22 December 1819 he was admitted a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians. On his own account, he had previously been in France with the Duke of Wellington. From half-pay, he was made an Inspector of Hospitals in 1820.Edinburgh Gazette (PDF) Settling in London, Hume became personal physician to the Duke. His patients included Marianne Patterson in 1824, shortly to marry the Duke's brother Richard. He travelled with the Duke to St Petersburg in 1826, and was present at the Duke's duel with the Earl of Winchelsea, fought in 1829 as part of the Catholic Emancipation controversy. He was made a commissioner for the licensing of Middlesex asylums in 1828. Hume was created D.C.L. at Oxford on 13 June 1834, the Duke being then chancellor of the university. He was admitted a fellow of the College of Physicians on 9 July 1836, and on the following 1 September was appointed one of the metropolitan commissioners in lunacy. Following the resignation of William Frederick Chambers, Hume at this period also became Examining Physician to the East India Company. He was sufficiently well known to feature in the early writings of the Bront√´ family. Hume was attacked and defended in The Lancet of the later 1840s, with other commissioners of lunacy, accused of being bedridden with gout, and a \\"sinecurist\\"; though he was active in inspections. He subsequently became inspector general of hospitals, and was made C.B. 16 August 1850. He died at his house in Curzon Street, Mayfair, London, on 1 March 1857, aged 75. Family Hume married Elizabeth, daughter of David Limond, at Ayr on 1 July 1804. Their daughter Elizabeth married Archibald Campbell of Glendaruel.

There are three fables of ancient Greek origin that refer to hare chasing, each of which also exemplifies a popular idiom or proverb. The Greek Anthology Three poems from the Greek Anthology refer to an otherwise unrecorded fable in which a hare on the run from hunting dogs leaps into the sea, only to be seized there by a 'sea-dog', a Mediterranean shark.Book IX, Declamatory Epigrams Fables 17, 18 and 371 The first two poems are by Germanicus Caesar, the second of which ends poignantly, ::Beasts of water and land rage against me alike. ::Hares, may the air be your recourse; yet I fear ::You too, O Heaven, have a dog among your stars! In the course of his first poem, Germanicus refers directly to the Greek equivalent of the proverbial idiom that was to develop into the modern-day 'Out of the frying pan into the fire'. The subject of the hare's fate was subsequently taken up in Latin by Ausonius in a four-line epigram reliant upon the Greek poems.N.M.Kay, Ausonius: Epigrams, Duckworth 2001, pp.109-12 The situation also figured in Gilles Corrozet's Hecatomographie (1540). This was an Emblem book in which the story's significance was widened to the uncertainty of life in general under the title \\"Peril and danger on all sides\\" (see illustration). The hare, the hound and the goatherd This brief fable is one of Aesop's and is numbered 331 in the Perry Index.Aesopica It concerns a dog at whom a goatherd jeers for being outstripped by the hare it was chasing. The dog replies that he should bear in mind the difference between the two contestants. \\"I was merely running for my dinner but he was running for his life\\". A form of the story was told with a good deal more circumstance by the mediaeval churchman Odo of Cheriton in his ‚ÄúThe contest of the wolf and the hare‚Äù. After the two creatures meet and agree to fight, having pledged a wager, the hare takes to its heels and the wolf eventually collapses exhausted, conceding the contest. The hare explains that he uses the weapons he has, his legs for running, and with \\"this tactic I have fought against the dogs...and won!\\" The fable is then given the religious interpretation that the best way to oppose lust is to flee its occasions.The Fables of Odo of Cheriton, Syracuse University 1985, pp.135-6 The ambivalent chase This too is one of Aesop's fables, numbered 136 in the Perry Index.Aesopica A dog chasing close behind a hare occasionally nips it and at other times licks and fawns upon it until the hare demands that he make up his mind and treat her either as an enemy or a friend. It is directed against the two-faced who, as the proverb says, 'hold with the hare and run with the hounds'.

It is an endangered species with only 476 mature plants known in 2001. It is closely related and very similar to Melaleuca haplantha but has narrower leaves and fewer stamens per flower than that species. Description Melaleuca sciotostyla is a shrub to about tall. Its leaves are arranged in alternating pairs, each pair at right angles to the ones above and below (decussate) so that the leaves form four rows along the stems. Each leaf is long and wide, linear to narrow elliptic in shape, slightly fleshy and with the end tapering to a point. The flowers are cream to white and arranged in small heads on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering and sometimes in the upper leaf axils. Each head is up to in diameter and contains up to four individual flowers. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flowers and there are 12 to 17 stamens per bundle. The main flowering period is in early spring and is followed by the fruit which are papery or corky, barrel-shaped capsules long. Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca sciotostyla was first formally described in 1988 by Bryan Barlow in Australian Systematic Botany as a new species. The specific epithet (sciotostyla) is from the Ancient Greek skiotos meaning \\"shaded by gradation in colour\\" referring to the coloration of the end of the style which appears to have been dyed. Distribution and habitat Melaleuca sciotostyla is confined to the Cadoux, Wongan Hills and Meckering districts in the Avon Wheatbelt and Jarrah Forest biogeographic regions growing in clayey sand and laterite on scree slopes. Conservation Melaleuca sciotostyla is listed as \\"endangered\\" by the Australian Government Department of the Environment. It is classed as \\"Declared Rare and Priority Flora\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife meaning that it is likely to become extinct or rare and therefore in need of special protection.

Between 1978 and 2013, Drobot managed 28 hospitals along the East Coast, including the Mount Sinai Roosevelt in New York (formerly the Roosevelt Medical Center). He also owned eight hospitals, including Pacific Hospital of Long Beach (now College Medical Center) and two health maintenance organizations. Career Early year in hospital administration Drobot spent his early years in Detroit, Michigan, before joining the United States Navy during the Vietnam War. During his time in the Navy, Drobot managed the Naval Hospital in Oakland, California. Upon his discharge from the Navy, Drobot pursued a career in hospital management by first obtaining an MBA in hospital administration from George Washington University. Healthcare administration in California Drobot's Concept Health Group, Inc. acquired Healthcare Medical Center of Tustin in July 1990. Drobot had been the executive director of Healthcare Medical Center from 1980 to 1984. Under Drobot, Concept Healthcare expanded the hospital‚Äôs services deeper into the Irvine area and added new centers for oncology and sports medicine. In the course of his 35 years career in healthcare, Drobot had the longest association with Pacific Hospital of Long Beach, which he owned and managed from 1997 to 2013, when it was sold to Molina Healthcare and became College Medical Center. Whilst CEO of Pacific Hospital, the hospital was nationally recognized for infection control measures. The hospital‚Äôs focus on a germ free environment garnered a Certificate of Special Congressional Recognition in 2009 . Pacific Hospital of Long Beach received an award from the Southern California Patient Safety First (SCPSF) for reducing sepsis mortality and hospital associated infection rates from 2010-2012. In 2013, Pacific Hospital of Long Beach was accredited by National Integrated Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations for meeting its standards of patient care and quality management. In 2013, the hospital was also designated as ISO 9001:3008 compliant by DNV Healthcare, an accreditor of US hospitals integrating ISO 9001 quality compliance with the Medicare Conditions of Participation. Legal issues During a criminal investigation, in February 2014, Drobot was charged by the FBI in with orchestrating a wide- ranging conspiracy and with paying illegal kickbacks. As part of the indictment, Drobot was charged with bribing Senator Ron Calderon to preserve California‚Äôs spinal pass through law. Senator Calderon was separately indicted by the FBI for accepting bribes and kickbacks from Drobot and others. Drobot signed a plea agreement agreeing to cooperate in the government‚Äôs ongoing investigation of Senator Calderon and his brother, Tom Calderon, and also into the healthcare fraud scheme known as Operation Spinal Cap. In October 2014 Drobot, along with his business partners, was sued for using counterfeit screws and hardware in spinal surgeries performed at Pacific Hospital and other area hospitals. At a Feb. 20, 2015 court hearing, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Elihu M. Berle rejected the claims against the group accused of using counterfeit surgical screws as in 29 out of 32 cases the plaintiffs were never treated at Pacific Hospital. Drobot filed a $50 million defamation suit in October 2014 against attorneys Brian Kabatek and Robert Hutchinson and the law firms of Kabateck Brown Kellner, Cotchett Pitre & McCarthy and Knox Ricksen. In April 2015, Drobot and his company Healthsmart Pacific, Inc. filed a lawsuit against 30 individuals and their attorneys for falsely and maliciously claiming that Drobot and Healthsmart‚Äôs former hospital, Pacific Hospital of Long Beach, harmed them via a non-existent \\"counterfeit screw\\" conspiracy.

The word tabiat means \\"nature\\" in the Persian language.\\" Tabiat Pedestrian Bridge / Diba Tensile Architecture\\", ArchDaily, 17 November 2014. The bridge was designed by Diba Tensile Architecture (Leila Araghian and Alireza Behzadi). It has won several awards, including the Popular Choice Prize for Highways & Bridges from the Architizer A+ Awards, a global architectural competition based in New York.2015 Architizer A+ Awards Winners: Typology Winners . The bridge also won the 2016 Aga Khan Award for Architecture\\"/ Aga Khan 2016 Award for Tabiat Bridge/ Diba Tensile Architecture\\" for its exemplary approach to an infrastructure project, \\"a breath of fresh air\\" according to the award jury. History Tabiat Bridge was designed by Leila Araghian as part of a local competition for the design of a bridge to connect two parks in north Tehran which were separated by a highway. In designing the bridge, a process which took a total of 4 years, Araghian wanted it to \\"be a place for people to stay and ponder, not simply pass.\\" To achieve this the bridge is not straight and contains benches and seating. Construction of the bridge started in 2010, using a total of 2000 tonnes of steel and 10000 cubic metres of concrete before it was finished in October 2014. Construction of the bridge over a large highway was described as a big challenge, with platforms and temporary tunnels built to ensure that nothing fell onto the road below. Architecture Three tree-shaped columns support two continuous deck levels which makes the lower level covered and suitable for use in all seasons. A third level is located where the truss meets the column branches. The complex steel structure has a dynamic three-dimensional truss[1] and the surface is curved with a varying width. Structural elements of the bridge use a latent geometrical order rotated and repeated in all three dimensions. Restaurants serve customers at either end of the bridge with seating areas and kiosks between. Some areas of the bridge are open to allow trees to grow and the bridge itself has green spaces to encourage visitors to linger. The bridge offers viewing areas for scenery without itself blocking the view of the Alborz mountains and has a small footprint that blends in with its environment. Each of the two parks the bridge connects has multiple pathways leading visitors onto the bridge.  Gathering Place  The bridge not only connects two parks, it is a popular gathering place for the community in its seating areas and restaurants, acting as a place for people to stay not just pass. Some have described walking on the bridge as feeling like walking through a forest and a place of positive energy where they can come to reenergize when feeling low. Four million people visited the bridge the first year it was open.

It was founded in 1978. Its CEO, Jimi Wong, also sits on the management board of the Singapore Lighting Association. History Jimi Wong graduated from Singapore Polytechnic with a Diploma in Electrical Engineering. According to Asiaweek, Jimi Wong started out in the industry by working for others, but as the conventional lighting industry became saturated and the emergency lighting industry grew to be a ‚Äúpotentially lucrative market‚Äù, Jimi Wong eventually ventured out on his own. Maxspid was founded by Jimi Wong as a sole proprietorship in 1978. The business became more lucrative in 1982, when it became compulsory for all local commercial and industrial buildings to install emergency lighting. Wong‚Äôs eldest son, James Wong, eventually joined his father‚Äôs company and is now a general manager in Maxspid. Maxspid was the first local company to manufacture emergency lighting, and now manufactures products varying from emergency exit luminaires to emergency kits and peripherals. Company profile Products and services Maxspid‚Äôs produces emergency exit lights, emergency power packs and emergency luminaire. The exit signage luminaries use different types of lamps such as CCFL(Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamp), LED and Fluorescent. They also maintain lighting for some customers. The company has attained the ISO 9000 certification for its products. Maxspid products also comply with Singapore compulsory standards. The external design of the exit sign has largely remained the same, featuring a green sign with white letters spelling the letters 'Exit'. There is little room for customization of design when producing these signs as it is strictly regulated by the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF). SCDF set these fire safety standards to ensure that all emergency signs used in Singapore will remain consistent. Despite such constraints, Marxspid has made some improvements in areas such as efficiency. Operations The standards required for emergency signs means that differentiating factors between Maxspid‚Äôs products are minimal, which helps them keep their inventory costs low. To reduce production costs, Mr Jimi Wong moved their manufacturing plant to Petaling Jaya in Malaysia in the 1980s, and again to China in the mid-1990s. Maxspid‚Äôs Singapore headquarters focuses on research and development and also serves as a distribution point. The company also relies on outsourcing some components to other companies to minimise costs. Notable projects Overseas presence In 1986, Maxspid participated in the sixth biennial electrical and electronic technology exhibition at the former Singapore World Trade Centre (now known as HarbourFront Centre). With the support of the former Singapore Trade Development Board (now known as International Enterprise Singapore), the company also participated in other overseas exhibitions such as the Hanover Fair in Western Germany and the fifth International Building Exhibition (1987) in Hong Kong. Maxspid has also expanded overseas to countries such as Hong Kong, Indonesia, Philippines, Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, India, Pakistan and South Africa. They hope to expand further into emerging markets such as Myanmar, Laos and the Middle East in the future. Local projects Along with five other companies in the lighting industry, Maxspid formed the Singapore Lighting Consortium so as to secure more construction projects. In a Straits Times article, Mr Jimi Wong said that ‚Äúsuch alliances enable small and medium enterprises to get a piece of the action without too huge a capital outlay.‚Äù This partnership ensures that they can continue to expand and endure in the industry. Additionally, Maxspid has worked on local projects at various Singaporean landmarks. Featured projects include the ION Orchard, Biopolis, Resorts World Sentosa, Singapore Management University and Changi Airport Terminal 3. Some of their notable customers include Changi Airport Terminals 1, 2 and 3, NTUC Income building, Marina Bay Suites, Lasalle College of the Arts, OCBC Bank, Supreme Court of Singapore, One Fullerton, Singapore General Hospital, Resorts World Sentosa, ION Orchard, National University of Singapore and Singapore Flyer.

The case has been described in the Court of Appeal as one that, \\"certainly provides some authority for the view that the directors of a building company with actual control of particular building operations owe a duty of care, associated with that control.\\"Body Corporate 202254 v Taylor [2009] 2 NZLR 17 at 32.

Before construction, \\"the directors had been advised by an engineer on the work necessary for the laying of foundations for two flats. One of the directors did not ensure that the engineer‚Äôs advice was adhered to in the construction of the foundations of one flat. The other director specifically took charge of the works on the other, and failed to ensure the engineer‚Äôs advice was followed.\\" Judgment Hardie Boys J reasoned that the directors of Douglas Homes Ltd could be held liable for their negligence as, \\"The principle of limited liability protects shareholders and not directors, and a director is as responsible for his own torts as any other servant or agent.\\"Trevor Ivory Ltd v Anderson [1992] 2 NZLR 517 at 547. Hardie Boys J held that in establishing whether a director owed a duty of care the test was to be that established in Anns v Merton London Borough Council [1978] AC 728 and that a duty of care was founded upon the control a director exercised over the operations of a company. Significance The ratio has not yet been overturned and as such remains a precedent for holding directors liable for defects in construction that was under their control. In 2006 in Dicks v Hobson Swan Construction Limited (in liquidation), Justice Baragwanath applied the ratio of the case to hold a director personally liable for a leaky building constructed by his company.Dicks v Hobson Swan Construction Limited (in liquidation) HC Auckland CIV 2004-404-1065, 20 October 2006 In a 2010 appeal from the Weathertight Homes Tribunal Justice Wylie noted the correct approach to searching for directorial liability lay through the test articulated in Morton v Douglas Homes Ltd; References High Court of New Zealand cases 1983 in New Zealand law 1983 in case law New Zealand tort case law Corporate law ","title":"Morton v Douglas Homes Ltd"},{"id":"46459387","text":"Mahinda is a common Sinhala male name *Mahinda Rajapaksa, former Sri Lankan President *Mahinda Amaraweera, Sri Lankan politician *Mahinda Samarasinghe, Sri Lankan politician *Mahinda Ratnatilaka, Sri Lankan politician *Mahinda Wijesekara, Sri Lankan politician *Mahinda College, a Buddhist boys' school in Galle *Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, Sri Lankan politician *Mahinda V of Anuradhapura, Sri Lankan King *Mahindananda Aluthgamage, Sri Lankan politician *Mahinda (Buddhist monk), (3rd Century BCE) Buddhist monk who introduced the Pali Canon to Sri Lanka *S.

During this time, ships carrying goods from the Baltic and North Sea passed along the √òresund, or the Sound, connecting areas like the Gulf of Finland to the Skagerrak. Over a period of 400 years, maritime powers in the east and west struggled to control these markets and the trade routes between them. The Baltic system can be explained beginning with the German Hanseatic era and ending with the Great Nordic Wars.  Era of the German Hanse  In the second half of the 14th century, the Hanseatic League dominated the trading organization in the Baltic. The Hanse originated in northern Germany and Westphalia and held many associations with merchants from these areas. In its prime, the Hanseatic League consisted of around 200 cities and towns and stretched from Reval in the east to Kampen in the west.(Dollinger, 2000, p. 28) The long-lasting success of the Hanseatic trading system can be attributed to Northern Europe‚Äôs many rivers and roads that connected German markets and cities to the ports in the Baltic Sea.  L√ºbeck  The city of L√ºbeck served as the starting point of the Hanseatic trading system. Merchant families from this area began to settle along the Wendish and Pomeranian coast.(Brand, 2006) Merchants from L√ºbeck and the Wendish coastal towns specialized in the trading of high-quality western goods, like cloth, spices, and wines, for minerals and products from the north and east. These included: * Prussian and Livonian hard dusk grains * Hemp and flax * Unprocessed timber, deal boards, masts, and klapholz * Russian tar for shipbuilding * Scandinavian potash for glass making * Swedish and Polish bar iron and copper * Finnish and Russian wax, furs, leather, skins * Baltic herring and beer * L√ºneburg salt L√ºbeck maintained its position as the central trading port in the Hanseatic League through its location in the Kontors. The four main Kontors were Novgorod, London, Bergen, and Bruges. Between these ports, rich merchant families kept in close contact with foreign powers and promoted the interests of the League. The relationship between the Kontors and main Hanse merchant settlements allowed for the establishment of a monopoly of goods. These included wax and furs from Novgorod, cod from Bergen, and high- quality wool and cloth from London and Bruges.(Brand, 2006)  Fall of the Hanseatic League  By the beginning of the fifteenth century, western demand for Prussian and Livonian goods was growing. The L√ºneburg salt exports were replaced by cheaper salt from France. Gradually, eastern Baltic merchants wore away the Hanseatic trading system and began to directly supply ports in London, Amsterdam, and Antwerp. As the League began to fragment, L√ºbeck and the Wendish coastal towns became isolated, and trade routes between the Baltic shores, North Sea, and the western Atlantic were established. The success of L√ºbeck continued into the early 1600s, largely due to shipbuilding. Hanseatic towns, however, began to find themselves more and more restricted to the Baltic Sea, as trade routes opened up to the western Atlantic system. In the second half of the seventeenth century, L√ºbeck was replaced by Elbe harbor as the main maritime center of the League in the Baltic. This transfer of power would begin the fall of the Hanseatic League. In 1648, Sweden occupied the Pomeranian and northern German shores, which resulted in the last Hanseatic meeting in L√ºbeck in 1669 to confirm the League‚Äôs demise.(Dollinger, 2000, p. 41)  New powers in the Baltic   Holland  At the beginning of the fifteenth century, large numbers of ships from Holland were sailing to the Baltic for grain and western France for salt. Instead of relying on the Hanseatic staple markets, the Dutch began to buy wheat and rye locally in order to drastically reduce prices. From the early to the late sixteenth century, it is estimated that the loading capacity of the merchant fleet increased by about 60,000 lasts. At the same time, Baltic grain imports increased by 50,000 lasts.(Israel, 1995, p.17) Without the middlemen that existed during the Hanseatic era, transaction costs were at an all-time low, allowing for cuts in Dutch shipbuilding costs and innovations in design. These new ships were faster, smaller, and were equipped for bulk-carrying trade. Dutch traders also developed a new business model in the fifteenth century. For larger trades, merchants would sign short-term contracts. This was very useful in Baltic trade, as there was less individual risk for merchants.  Muscovite Empire  Another power in the north was also rising at this time. The Russian prince, Grand Duke Ivan III, closed the Kontor in Novgorod in 1494. By 1558, Russian merchants had reached the Baltic coasts and occupied Livonia, Dorpat, and Narva. At this time, Russia and Sweden were competing for control of the routes that connected the Baltic coast and Russian lands. By the end of the sixteenth century, Russia had been secluded from Baltic trade after Sweden took control of Reval and Riga.(Brand, 2006)  The Dutch in the Baltic  In the 1590s, Dutch trade began to spread further into the Mediterranean and surpass that of L√ºbeck and Hamburg. This was largely due to Holland‚Äôs presence in the Atlantic trading system, which included Spain, Portugal, and France. This widespread trade led to Amsterdam becoming the center of Europe‚Äôs trading system in the seventeenth century. Exports to the Baltic such as sugar, tea, coffee, and tobacco greatly increased at this time.  Fluitschip  Around 1595, a ship known as the fluit was created in the Low Countries. This ship maximized carrying capacity and drastically cut building costs. It was built with a flat bottom and long hull that could transport a large shipment through shallow waters.(Israel, 1995, p. 17) This new ship could be crewed by a small number of men and cost about 50% of the usual price to build a ship.  Changing mercantilist policies  As Dutch and English trade became more prominent in the West Baltic, many governments decided to impose certain mercantilist policies that would protect the interests of their trade and national economies.  Denmark  Christian IV was the Danish King from 1596-1648. During his reign he imposed policies that threatened the development of Dutch trade in the Baltics. When Denmark won the Kalmar wars (1611‚Äì1613), the king imposed a ban on all Dutch traffic heading to Sweden and increased the Sound Toll duties. To combat this, the Dutch decided to form alliances with the Hanseatic League and Sweden in order to remain in access of the Sound. Christian IV was then forced to reduce these policies after the Dutch were guaranteed safe passage in the Baltic region. In 1632, the Spanish and Danish created a treaty that would reduce Dutch access to Baltic trade. At the same time, the Sound toll increased again, causing more problems for the Dutch because of the commodities they were trading. To counter these problems, the Dutch sent their navy into the Sound in 1645 as a threat to Copenhagen. Christian IV was forced to dissolve the new tolls at the Sound and in Gl√ºckstadt. An agreement was reached in 1649 that would return the Dutch trading power to the Baltic.  Sweden  The Thirty Years' War greatly hindered Denmark‚Äôs attempt at Baltic control. At this time, Sweden began to successfully campaign in Jutland and forced the Danish to give up many territories along the Sound and into the Baltic. The late seventeenth century would become known as Sweden‚Äôs Age of Greatness and would last until 1721.(Magnusson, 2000, p. 67) During this time, Sweden‚Äôs control of the Baltic reached from the Sound to Riga. During Sweden‚Äôs Baltic dominion, the Dutch navy intervened in order to protect their commercial interests. This led to a peace treaty in 1660 between Sweden and Denmark, along with negotiations between the English and Dutch. By the 1640s, Sweden had become the Dutch‚Äôs main trading partner in the Baltic region. ‚ÄúAbout 50 per cent of Sweden's imports originated from Amsterdam's staple market, whilst all copper exports and 40 per cent of all iron exports went to the Low Countries, as did 75 per cent of the Finnish tar production‚Äù.(Brand, 2006) In 1667, Sweden changed its mercantilist policies once again by imposing tolls on salt and wine that were shipped from foreign markets, greatly undermining trade coming from Amsterdam. The Dutch then sent their navy into the Baltic, and with the Danish, defeated the Swedes in 1679. This defeat led to a treaty that would result in the recovery of the Dutch‚Äôs trade in the Sound.  Danish-Norse  Denmark and Norway worked to maintain their mercantilist policies that would decrease their dependence on Amsterdam and the Dutch Republic as a whole. A treaty was signed in 1688 after the Danish attempted to impose tariffs on Dutch trading, but the Dutch held much less power in Denmark after this. The Dutch and the Norse began to trade directly with the English and French and avoided Amsterdam as a main trading port.  Eastern Baltic  At the beginning of the seventeenth century, Dutch trade dominated the eastern Baltic region with goods like spices and high-quality cloth. This Dutch control, however, began to diminish in the later decades of this century. There are a few proposed explanations for this, one being that Baltic grain lost competitiveness in the western markets because Polish farms declined in efficiency. Another explanation is the wars against the Cossacks and the Swedes that occurred in the 1640s-1660s. The English Navigation Acts also affected Dutch trade in the eastern Baltics. Sweden established new policies that significantly affected the eastern Baltic trading system. The Swedish Tar Company was created in 1648, which greatly undermined tar exports form Finland. This resulted in the illegal transportation of Finnish goods to Livonian ports, and Dutch traders that occupied southern Sweden transported timber from Norway to other ports around the Baltic.(Magnusson, 2000, p. 54)  Russian trade  The policies that Sweden established at this time also aimed to control Russian trade in the Baltic region. In an effort to remove the Dutch from the market, Sweden attempted to buy grain surpluses and entire stocks of leather from Russia. The treaty of Kardis was established in 1661 to provide free trade in Russia, but ended soon after in 1667. The Dutch proved to be the only economically developed state that could successfully deal with the trading conditions of Russia.  Great Nordic wars  From 1700-1721, Poland, Russia, and Denmark- Norway fought against Sweden, dramatically shifting the Baltic trading system at this time. At the beginning of the war, Dutch trade through the Sound was far outweighed by Scandinavian shipping. In 1710, when hostility between Denmark and Sweden began, trade through the Sound became inactive. In 1721, Sweden‚Äôs Age of Greatness came to an end and trade was restored from the Baltic Sea through the Sound. After the war ended, governmental interventionism became the forefront of all commercial policies in the powers of the Baltic. These protectionist measures were meant to decrease foreign influence on industries and trade within states. Some of examples of these policies are: * Prussian ban on raw wool export * Danish prohibition on import of foreign wool, silk, sugar, etc. * Swedish Produktplakat (1724) ‚Äì decreased foreign shipping to Sweden  Rise of Russia  After Sweden fell in the Great Nordic Wars, Russia gained its ports from Novgorod to Riga, Reval, and Narva. These cities and ports provided Russia with direct routes to the Baltic. In 1721, the treaty of Nystad was signed, which led to the development of Russian Baltic trade and the founding of St. Petersburg. By 1780, Russia had surpassed the Pomeranian coast under Swedish control.(Brand, 2006) The rise of Russia as a seaborne trading power cause a shift in trade direction from south-north to east-west. Stockholm was now a major port in the Baltic region, backed by Denmark‚Äôs demand of goods from Sweden‚Äôs market. The end of the eighteenth century was marked by the rise of Russia and Hamburg in the Baltic, and England‚Äôs gain on the Dutch.

The network targets New Zealand's growing population of baby boomers with a line-up of veteran broadcasters. Its music breakfast show, Magic Breakfast (formerly Magic in the Morning), is hosted by high-profile television producer, game show host, sports commentator and radio announcer Mark Leishman, while its talk breakfast show The AM Show is simulcast on TV channel Three and is presented by Duncan Garner, Amanda Gillies and Mark Richardson. Magic Music targets 50- to 69-year-olds, an older demographic than similar MediaWorks brands. It is run alongside The Breeze with a similar playlist, but The Breeze has a younger female skew and easy listening music focus. Another MediaWorks network, The Sound, previously played similar music but now has a male skew and a rock music focus. Magic targets older listeners who have a \\"youthful, active approach to life\\" and want \\"fantastic music and a feel-good attitude\\". However, some marketing commentators have argued the \\"youthful\\" brand is out of touch with the \\"antiquated\\" classic playlist. Its playlist, drawn from the 1950s to 1970s, includes music from Elvis Presley, The Beach Boys, Roy Orbison, Dusty Springfield and Rod Stewart. Magic Talk is a nationwide Auckland-based talkback, news and sport radio network, formed by the 2019 rebrand of Radio Live. The station competes directly against NZME station Newstalk ZB. Magic was rebranded as Magic Music, and some programmes shared with the newly-launched Magic Talk. This change took effect in mid- January 2019, with a large number of Radio Live hosts leaving the station due to the restructure. The first programme hosted on the station was Overnights with Tony Amos. History Magic was launched on 20 April 2015 in Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, Tauranga, Rotorua and Dunedin, some stations were launched on frequencies MediaWorks acquired in radio spectrum auctions, others were secondary frequencies used by other MediaWorks stations such as in Dunedin the 99.8FM frequency was previously used by Radio Dunedin and Wellington's 891AM previously used by The Breeze. Over the next few days, the Magic added frequencies in Hawkes Bay and Kapiti. More stations in Wanganui, Wairarapa, Blenheim, Nelson, Queenstown, Southland and Rodney over the following months. The Magic brand name has been used in other regions such as Magic FM in Northland which was owned by MediaWorks but closed down in 2001, Magic 828 & 98.6FM in Palmerston North which was rebranded The Breeze in 2004 and Magic 91FM which was a local station in Auckland during the 1980s. The launch of Magic was made possible by the closure of Kiwi FM on March 31. Magic took over the former Kiwi FM studios in Auckland. Kiwi was an independent non- profit music broadcaster, wholly owned by MediaWorks. It operated as ten years as Kiwi FM, and had previously operated as ten years as Channel Z. The network attracted 28,000 listeners each week and was responsible for about one percent of local music airtime on New Zealand radio. However, its popularity and long- term viability had been undermined by new websites offering direct access to local music, and MediaWorks decided to focus its youth resources on the nationwide roll-out of George FM and Mai FM. MediaWorks hopes the Magic network will increase its market share of the one million New Zealanders aged 50 to 74. In New Zealand this demographic is growing in size, is more likely to listen to the radio and listens to radio for longer hours. People in this group also have fewer family commitments, and have more assets and disposable incomes. MediaWorks secured a network of new frequencies in the 2014 radio spectrum auction in markets with large baby boomer populations. The company says that includes markets where Magic can go head to head with Coast, and markets with no Coast stations where Magic can secure a monopoly or gain a competitive advantage. In November 2018, it was announced that sister station Radio Live would be merging with Magic to form a talk-music radio hybrid known as Magic Talk, which started on 19 January 2019. Former TVNZ news presenter Peter Williams was the first host revealed for the new network. Competition Magic's main competitor is New Zealand Media and Entertainment's network station Coast which has been broadcasting under this name since 2002 originally just in the Hawkes Bay area but began expanding to the rest of New Zealand in 2004. Both stations play a similar format. In the past MediaWorks ran a Rock and roll Oldies format station called Solid Gold which initially played music from the 1950s to the 1970s and later specializing in 1960's and 70's music. In 2012 Solid Gold was rebranded as The Sound and switched format to Classic rock, the format change for this station was due to a gap left in the market after Radio Hauraki moved away from Classic Rock music. The change in format for The Sound meant MediaWorks were no longer catering to an older audience of listeners, a gap filled by Magic.

Biography Georgios Vroutos was born in Athens in 1843, into a family originating from Crete. He studied sculpture at the School of Fine Arts from 1859 to 1864 under Georgios PhitalisŒïŒºœÄœÅœåœÇ, Sunday 11 January 1909. and also took courses in marble carving at the workshop of the famous professor and sculptor Ioannis Kossos.National Gallery: Vroutos Georgios.Dermitzaki, Aikaterini (2013), p. 222. In 1866, he traveled to Rome with a scholarship from Queen Olga, where he stayed for three years, studying under the supervision of Canova, Adamo, Tantolini and Filippo Niakarini. During his time in Italy, he worked on behalf of an Italian banker. When he returned to Greece in 1873, he opened his own sculpture workshop in the district of Plaka and in 1883 he was appointed professor of sculpture at the School of Fine Arts, as successor to Leonidas Drossis who had just died. Vroutos retained this position till his own death. In 1888 he was proclaimed a member of the Academy of Fine Arts in Paris. He was also a founding member of the Historical and Ethnological Society of Greece.Dermitzaki, Aikaterini (2013), p. 221 ‚Äì 222. He died in Athens, on January 10, 1909. Works Among the most renowned works of Vroutos, is the statue of Adamantios Korais in front of the University of Athens central building (Panepistimiou Street), and the one of Konstantinos Zappas, in front of the Zappeion exhibition hall. A statue of him is also located in Istanbul, Turkey. In the cemetery there are two monuments of the artist, representing Papadakis and Rallis respectively. The Museum of Boston, bought the statues of Achilles and Paris, both artistic creations of Vroutos. An unexpectedly bold creation of his is the \\"Spirit of Copernicus\\" located at the National Gallery of Athens , sometimes described as a \\"technical marvel\\".Marinos Kalligas, ŒñœâŒ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒπŒ∫ŒÆ, Œ≥ŒªœÖœÄœÑŒπŒ∫ŒÆ, œáŒ±œÅŒ±Œ∫œÑŒπŒ∫ŒÆ, ŒôœÉœÑŒøœÅŒØŒ± œÑŒøœÖ ŒïŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫Œøœç ŒàŒ∏ŒΩŒøœÖœÇ, ŒïŒ∫Œ¥ŒøœÑŒπŒ∫ŒÆ ŒëŒ∏Œ∑ŒΩœéŒΩ, vol.

The composition seems to have broken the law of gravity. The artist does nevertheless not seem to have further explored this daring path in his later career.

Between 7 and 10 people were killed, including the attacker and four UNICEF workers. The Al-Shabaab militant group claimed responsibility for the blast. The Puntland administration subsequently appointed a governmental committee to probe the circumstances surrounding the attack, and apprehended over a dozen suspects. Overview On 20 April 2015, militants planted a bomb in a UN van in the northeastern city of Garowe, the administrative capital of the autonomous Puntland regional state of Somalia. According to police Colonel Ali Salad, at least seven workers were killed in the ensuing blast, including three Somali nationals, two Kenyans, one Afghan and one Ugandan. Four of the slain officials were UNICEF workers. Police commander Ahmed Abdullahi Samatar suggested that the attacker was among the dead. Additionally, UN Special Representative for Somalia Nicholas Kay indicated that two guards were among the dead. Unconfirmed witness reports suggested that 10 people died. Four Somali nationals, one American, one Sierra Leonean, one Kenyan and one Ugandan were also injured. Police officer Yusuf Ali indicated that the explosive device was lodged under a seat in the vehicle and detonated via remote control. The Al-Shabaab militant group later claimed responsibility for the attack through its radio station. President of Somalia Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, Ambassador Kay, and Puntland Vice President Abdihakim Abdullahi Haji Omar all condemned the bombing and sent their condolences to the families of the deceased. Mohamud also suggested that such attacks against small, soft targets demonstrated that Al-Shabaab was near its end, and urged vigilance and cooperation with the Puntland security forces to ensure that the nationwide reconstruction and development process continued unabated. Omar likewise described the blast as futile and indicated that it would not derail the region's stability. The Puntland administration subsequently appointed a five- member governmental committee to probe the circumstances surrounding the attack. On 25 April, Puntland police apprehended over a dozen individuals in connection with the UN van attack. According to Nugal province commander Colonel Ahmed Abdullahi Samatar, the suspects were being interrogated at the police headquarters. He also indicated that the results of the probe had been entrusted to an oversight committee, that the security situation was stable, and that new community policing centers were scheduled to be established.

Both of the ships he captained during the rescues were owned by the large United States Lines. Fried became familiar to thousands of Americans when his syndicated column \\"My Thirty Years at Sea\\", which chronicled his life and ocean adventures, was featured in major newspapers beginning in 1929. Early life Fried was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, on August 10, 1877, and attended the Belmont and Dix Street Schools. He worked on a local farm from ages twelve to fifteen, harvesting beets and corn, but from an early age had a desire to sail the seas.Fried, George, \\"My Thirty Years at Sea\\", Prescott Evening Courier, pg. 3, Prescott, Arizona, 25 February 1929. He entered Army service at the age of twenty-one during the period of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and served from 1898 to 1900.\\"Hero of Many Sea Rescues Will Get Coveted Position as Commander of Big Ship\\", The Evening-Independent, pg. 18, St. Petersburg, Florida , 30 November 1931.

His first naval assignment was with the historic , a 255-foot steam and sail-powered sloop of war, which had seen service in the Civil War. As a fledgling US Naval seaman, he began service swabbing the Hartfords decks, working the coalroom, and trimming sails. During many of the summers from 1900‚Äì12, the Hartford took US Naval Academy midshipmen on a cruise to gain hands on experience with essential seafaring skills. During several of these cruises, Fried worked in the deck area where navigation was being taught. In his spare time, he began to study navigational formulas and was assisted by officers, until he had begun to grasp the fundamentals of the science of navigation. During five years of service aboard the Hartford from 1900‚Äì05, he progressed from ordinary seaman to coxswain, quartermaster, and finally chief quartermaster, with each position developing and refining what would become his remarkable navigation skills.Fried, George, \\"My Thirty Years at Sea\\", Ludington Daily News, pg. 5, Ludington, Michigan, 26 February 1929. USS Solace In 1916, after short rotations aboard various cruisers and battleships, Fried became third officer aboard the as a member of the Merchant Marine.

After several attempts amidst violent snowstorms and rough seas, Roosevelt succeeded in rescuing her crew of twenty-five on midnight of the following day. The rescue was made memorable by the Roosevelt's persistence in remaining with the sinking Antinoe despite rough seas, snow, and bitter cold. After completing the rescue of her crew, Roosevelt left the listing, damaged Antinoe abandoned with no electrical power. On her return to Hoboken Pier, Roosevelt was greeted by local dignitaries, including New Jersey Governor Harry Moore, who gave an address. Roosevelt's officers and crew were entertained by a band, received a twenty-one-gun salute, and were welcomed to New York by Mayor Jimmy Walker, after a stay at the Roosevelt Hotel and a ticker-tape parade. For his heroic efforts, Fried was awarded the Navy Cross and both he and members of the Roosevelt's crew were decorated by the British government.Fried, George, \\"Nation Opens Arms to Captain and Crew of America\\", Herald-Journal, pg. 1, Spartanburg, South Carolina, 15 February 1926. SS America Fried took command of the SS America in 1928. Only three years after his previous rescue, while serving as captain of the SS America, Fried rescued the thirty-two man crew of the Italian steamship Florida in freezing weather and violent snow squalls.

Navigating with the aid of a radio direction finder, the America fixed a location on the Italian ship, and late the following afternoon on January 28, 1929, sighted the endangered vessel. Pulling alongside of Floridas weather beam, America launched a lifeboat, commanded by her chief officer, Harry Manning, with an eight-man crew. Manning's crew rowed the lifeboat to within fifty feet of the listing Florida, and a line was thrown to the frantic crew of the freighter. One by one, men from the Italian ship came across the rope. By the time the Floridas captain had been pulled on board the lifeboat as the last man, winds were gale force, and the seas were rough and high. After rowing the lifeboat back to the America, her sailors helped haul aboard the survivors of the Florida using ladders, ropes, cargo nets, and two homemade breeches buoy. The breeches buoys were basically zip lines tied from America's large life raft containing the rescued crew of the Florida to the waiting America. Fried became a national hero when his account of the story was widely distributed by newspapers.Poling, Dr. Daniel A., \\"Salute to George Fried-Sea Captain\\", Herald-Journal, pg. 4, Spartanburg, South Carolina, 31 August 1946.Knight, Austin M., Modern Seamanship (1930), D.

Background After Alp Arslan of Seljukids defeated Byzantine army in the battle of Manzikert in 1071, a series of Turkmen beyliks (principalities) were formed in Anatolia before Anatolia was united by the Sultanate of Rum. Saltukids was one of them. Its capital was Erzurum. Saltuk II was the fourth bey of this beylik. Plot Saltuk became the bey after the death of his uncle Ziyaeddin in 1132. He formed family relations with the other Turkmen beyliks around Erzurum. However, when Fakr al-Din Shaddad, a Shaddadid emir of Ani asked for Saltuk's daughter's hand Saltuk refused him. This caused a deep hatred in ≈ûeddat towards Saltuk. In 1154 he planned a plot and formed a secret alliance with the Demetrius I of Georgia. While a Georgian army waited in ambush, he invited Saltuk to Ani with the pretext of selling the fort to Saltukids. Saltuk was taken prisoner by the Georgians. After ransom was paid by Saltuk's sons in law and Saltuk swore not to fight against the Georgians he returned home.Prof. Ya≈üar Y√ºce-Prof. Ali Sevim: T√ºrkiye tarihi Cilt I, AKDTYKTTK Yayƒ±nlarƒ±, ƒ∞stanbul, 1991, p 149-150 Ani campaign Towards the end of Saltuk's reign in 1161, George III of Georgia captured Ani.

But during the siege, Georgian army arrived to defend the fort and Saltuk remembering his oath, left the battle field. The campaign was a failure. However, two years later, Georgians were defeated by a coalition of Muslim leaders and Saltuk was able to expand his territory.Islam Encyclopedia Death Saltuk died in 1168.

He is best known for his feature film directorial debut Bunny Chow. The film was officially selected to screen at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2006. The film received many awards. John is born to parents Clive Barker (soccer coach) and Yvonne Barker. During the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, John made a documentary Soccer: South of the Umbilo about his childhood growing up in the southern suburbs of Durban, which produced many talented soccer players and coaches including his father Clive Barker. John wrote, directed and produced South Africa's first music mockumentary Blu Cheez. He next directed the music documentary Kwaito Generals produced by Kutloano Skosana of Black Rage, which focused on the stars who were at the forefront of the Kwaito movement of the late nineties and early 2000s. During this time he joined The Pure Monate Show. He directed sketches in season one and directed and co-wrote sketches for the entire second season. He then wrote, produced and directed Bunny Chow which employed a retro scripting technique with the actors improvising their dialogue to communicate the outlined script written by Barker and David Kibuuka and later retro scripted with Kagiso Lediga, Joey Rasdien and editor Saki Bergh. He is working on a second retro scripted film Wonder Boy for President with many of his collaborators from Bunny Chow. His style is inspired largely by Larry David's Curb Your Enthusiasm, and notable directors who employ these techniques such as John Cassavetes, Christopher Guest, Robert Altman and Mike Leigh.

Early Admiralty Houses in Bermuda Admiralty House Bermuda at Mount Wyndham (1810 to 1816) The first location of the Admiralty House had been at Rose Hill, in St. George's Town, between 1795 and 1806. This was where Irish poet Thomas Moore was employed as a clerk to the Admiralty Court in 1803. St. George's Harbour, up 'til that time, had been the only harbour suitable for large naval vessels that also had a known access route through Bermuda's encircling barrier reef (the Admiralty had plans to utilise Castle Harbour but its shallow waters, and its treacherous entrance through Castle Roads proved dangerous in stormy weather). The Royal Navy had begun establishing itself in and around the town, especially at Convict Bay, but had longer term plans for a dockyard and naval base at the opposite end of the archipelago. Royal Naval hydrographers had spent a dozen years in charting the reef, and had discovered a channel that enabled the Royal Navy to begin mooring vessels off the northern shore of St. George's Island at a location that became known as Murray's Anchorage, after Vice-Admiral Sir George Murray, who led the first fleet to anchor there in 1794. This also opened up the West End of Bermuda, where the Royal Navy had already begun purchasing land around the Great Sound and Hamilton Harbour, to access by large vessels. St. John's Hill, a property at Spanish Point, in Pembroke Parish that belonged to John Dunscombe (a Bermudian who later became a prominent resident and Lieutenant- Governor of Newfoundland), was rented by the Admiralty in 1810 as a residence for the Royal Naval Commander-in-Chief, by then Admiral Sir John Warren. It was then intended to move Admiralty House to a building on Langton Hill, also in Pembroke, but this evidently did not happen. In 1810, Admiralty House moved instead to the rented Mount Wyndham, above Bailey's Bay.Bermuda's First Admiralty House, by Dr. Edward Cecil Harris. The Royal Gazette, 1 October 2011 This location allowed observation of both St. George's Harbour and Murray's Anchorage, and signals could be passed between these points with visual aids (flags or lights). Mount Wyndham was \\"granted by\\" the House of Assembly in 1812, and St. John's Hill (which was still being rented by the Admiralty, but had been sitting vacant) was adapted to a naval hospital during a yellow fever epidemic that year.\\"The Andrew and the Onions\\", by Lieutenant-Commander Ian Stranack Move to the West End With the development of the Royal Naval Dockyard underway at Ireland Island, Bermuda, Mount Wyndham was unable to provide visibility of the base or the Great Sound, where a new anchorage would be located at Grassy Bay. Consequently, Spanish Point was rented by the Admiralty for a peppercorn beginning in 1813. However, the blockade of the Atlantic Seaboard harbours of the United States during the American War of 1812 was orchestrated from Mount Wyndham, as was the punitive raid on the Chesapeake Bay in 1814 that included the Burning of Washington. In 1816 St. John's Hill was purchased by the Government of Bermuda for ¬£2,000-3,000 pounds and gifted to the Admiralty by the House of Assembly. \\"Admiralty House\\" moved there from Mount Wyndham in the same year. Closure In 1822, St. John's Hill was renamed \\"Clarence Hill\\", commemorating Admiral of the Fleet, Prince William, the Duke of Clarence (later King William IV), and remained Admiralty House 'til 1956, after which it was transferred to the local government for use by the Headquarters of the Bermuda Local Forces, part of the Bermuda Garrison of the British Army, which oversaw the Bermuda Militia Artillery and the Bermuda Rifles (but was subsidiary to the Command Headquarters at Prospect Camp in Devonshire). Civil use After the two units amalgamated in 1965 to form the Bermuda Regiment, it housed one of the regiment's rifle companies until the early-1970s, when all sub-units of the regiment were collected at Warwick Camp. The Bermuda Government then used Admiralty House as a barracks for the Bermuda Police Service (the first constables housed there were originally caretakers). In 1973, the property was adapted for the rehabilitation of drug addicts by The Group, a charity with wide backing. Although the grounds are still generally referred to as Admiralty House, the Admiralty House itself was deemed unsafe, and uneconomical to repair, and was deliberately burnt down on 24 January 1974. Later that year, the Government of Bermuda's Department of Education began planning to redevelop the Admiralty House grounds as a unified campus for the Bermuda College. This was to include the college Department of Hotel Technology's hotel training school, a working hotel where students could gain practical experience. Although the foreshore and the eastern slope of Clarence Hill were to be designated a botanical and biological preserve, the campus plan was protested by the Admiralty House Park Association, which included local residents, and by the organisations already based on the property. The protests were ultimately successful as the hotel training school, originally titled Stonington Beach, was instead placed on the South Shore in Paget (the main campus of the college was situated separately at the former Prospect Camp, until moving to the same site in Paget in the 1990s). Admiralty House was designated a public park in 1986. Current use While most of the grounds are now public parkland, the Clarence Hill property retains a naval use as part of it has since 1968 housed TS Bermuda, the headquarters unit of the Bermuda Sea Cadet Corps, a youth organisation with voluntary officers who hold honorary commissions in the Royal Navy Reserve. Mount Wyndham (where the press of the Great Seal of the Confederacy, which had been waiting in Bermuda for delivery to Charleston, South Carolina by blockade-runner, was kept for many decades after the defeat of the Confederate States of America ended the American Civil War) returned to use as a private dwelling after Admiralty House was relocated to St. John's Hill, and currently is part of a housing condominium development which includes many newer buildings. Rose Hill became the site of the St. George's Hotel, and currently is occupied by the St. George's Club, a time sharing development made up of seventy-one cottages, an administration building (also containing a restaurant), and storage buildings. No earlier structures remain.

This has been achieved in a very short geological period of time, spanning only a few tens of thousands of years, and sometimes less. Maize, Zea mays, for instance, is estimated to have been created in what is now known as Mexico in only a few thousand years, starting between about 7 000 and 12 000 years ago, from still uncertain origins.Laws, B (2010).Fifty Plants that Changed the Course of History. pp. 210- 215.

Evolvability Evolution is imposed on populations. It is not planned or striven for in some Lamarckist way.Gould, S.J. (1980) Return of the Hopeful Monster. in The Panda's Thumb. p. 186-193. New York: W.W. Norton. The mutations on which the process depends are random events, and, except for the \\"silent mutations\\" which do not affect the functionality or appearance of the carrier, are thus usually disadvantageous, and their chance of proving to be useful in the future is vanishingly small. Therefore, while a species or group might benefit from being able to adapt to a new environment by accumulating a wide range of genetic variation, this is to the detriment of the individuals who have to carry these mutations until a small, unpredictable minority of them ultimately contributes to such an adaptation. Thus, the capability to evolve is close to the discredited concept of group selection, since it would be selectively disadvantageous to the individual. Overcoming koinophilia If sexual creatures avoid mates with strange or unusual characteristics, in the process called koinophilia,Koeslag, J.H. (1990). \\"Koinophilia groups sexual creatures into species, promotes stasis, and stabilizes social behaviour.\\" J. theor. Biol. 144, 15‚Äì35Symons, D. (1979) The Evolution of Human Sexuality.

Sci. 1, 115‚Äì121 then mutations that affect the external appearance of their carriers will seldom be passed on to the next and subsequent generations. They will therefore seldom be tested by natural selection. Evolution is, therefore, effectively halted or slowed down considerably. The only mutations that can accumulate in a population are ones that have no noticeable effect on the outward appearance and functionality of their bearers (i.e., they are \\"silent\\" or \\"neutral mutations\\", which can be, and are, used to trace the relatedness and age of populations and species.Campbell, N.A. (1990) Biology p. 450‚Äì451, 487‚Äì490, 499‚Äì501. Redwood City CA: Benjamin Cummings Publishing Company.) This implies that evolution can only occur when mutant mates cannot be avoided, as a result of a severe scarcity of potential mates. This is most likely to occur in small, isolated communities. These occur most commonly on small islands, in remote valleys, lakes, river systems, or caves,Ayala, F.J. (1982) Population and Evolutionary Genetics pp. 73‚Äì83, 182‚Äì190, 198‚Äì215. Menlo Park, California: Benjamin/Cummings. or during the aftermath of a mass extinction. Under these circumstances, not only is the choice of mates severely restricted but population bottlenecks, founder effects, genetic drift and inbreeding cause rapid, random changes in the isolated population's genetic composition. Furthermore, hybridization with a related species trapped in the same isolate might introduce additional genetic changes. If an isolated population such as this survives its genetic upheavals, and subsequently expands into an unoccupied niche, or into a niche in which it has an advantage over its competitors, a new species, or subspecies, will have come in being. In geological terms this will be an abrupt event. A resumption of avoiding mutant mates will, thereafter, result, once again, in evolutionary stagnation. Fossil record Alternative explanations of the pattern of evolution observed in the fossil record. While apparently instantaneous change may look like macromutation, gradual evolution by natural selection could readily give the same effect, since 10,000 years barely registers in the fossil record. The fossil record of an evolutionary progression typically consists of punctuated equilibrium, with species that suddenly appear, as if by macromutation, and ultimately disappear, in many cases close to a million years later, without any change in external appearance. This is compatible with evolution by smaller mutational steps because periods of a few tens of thousands of years can barely be distinguished in the fossil record: relatively rapid evolution will always appear as a sudden change in a sequence of fossils.Eldredge, Niles; Gould, Stephen J. (1977) \\"Punctuated equilibria: the tempo and mode of evolution reconsidered.\\" Paleobiology 3 115‚Äì151.McCarthy, T. & Rubridge, B. (2005) The Story of Earth and Life.

On the Origin of Species London: John Murray. 5th edition, p. 551. In general, morphological changes are too rapid to determine from which cotemporal species a new species originated, as seen in the evolution of modern humans.

History The MEG, or Geneva Museum of Ethnography, was founded on 25 September 1901, on the initiative of Professor Eug√®ne Pittard (1867-1962), who also held the first Chair of Anthropology at the University of Geneva. It was first housed in Mon Repos villa. Pittard brought together public and private collections, mainly the ethnographic collections of the Archaeology Museum and the Mus√©e Ariana, the holdings of the Evangelical Missionary Society Museum and weapons from the Geneva History Museum. In 1939, the MEG moved into the disused buildings of the Mail primary school in boulevard Carl Vogt. It opened in the new premises on 12 July 1941, sharing the space with the Anthropology Department of the University until 1967. The building was extended in 1949; in 1975 the city bought the Lombard villa in Ch√™ne-Bougeries, which became the Conches annex. Between 1980 and 2001, three proposals to build a new museum in Sturm Square were rejected. The city then envisaged renovating and extending the building on its present site. The City Council unanimously approved the project on 21 March 2007. The MEG‚Äôs new pagoda-shaped building was opened on 31 October 2014, after four years of construction work. It was designed by Graber Pulver Architekten AG, with ACAU architecture and town planning, in partnership with the civil engineering firm Weber + Br√∂nnimann EG. The galleries and an auditorium are located in the basement; the cafeteria, museum shop and ticket office are on the ground floor, facing the garden. Upstairs are restoration and cultural outreach workshops, as well as the library, which is named after a generous patron, Marie Madeleine Lancoux. The library includes a small space for listening to music from all over the world. The old building has also been renovated and now houses the offices and ethnomusicology workshops. The three buildings in the ensemble - the old museum, the new MEG and a primary school ‚Äì enclose a small square planted with trees and flowers. The museum is on the Swiss Inventory of Cultural Property of National and Regional Significance.

ICAR-DGR was established in 1979 at Junagadh, Gujarat to give a fillip to research for enhancing productivity of groundnut in keeping with its importance among the oilseed crops of India. The research centre came into being as the first crop commodity research unit under the category of NRC's (National Research Centres) of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, as an autonomous body set up as a registered society. The National Research Centre on Groundnut (NRCG) was elevated to the level of a Directorate in the year 2009 and rechristened as the Directorate of Groundnut Research.  History  ICAR-DGR, the first crop based national research center in India under the ICAR, was established on 1 October 1979 at Junagadh on a leased land from Gujarat Agricultural University spread out over a land of about 18 ha. Later, the base of DGR was moved to 4 km away from the original site with the acquisition of additional 100 ha land from Junagadh Agricultural University, on 1 Oct 1991.  Mandate  The institute is mandated to : # Conduct basic and strategic research to enhance production, productivity and quality of groundnut # Act as the national repository of working collection of groundnut germplasm and information on groundnut research # Establish relevant institutional linkages # Offer consultancy and training, and # Provide logistic support and coordination mechanism for generation of location-specific technology through the All India Coordinated Research Project on Groundnut. Groundnut kernel  Mission  Conduct research for improving the crop production technologies to eventually enhance groundnut productivity from the current 1050 kg/ha to 1500 kg/ha for kharif (rainfed) and from 1500 kg/ha to 2000 kg/ha for rabi-summer (irrigated) by the year 2017 by developing remunerative, globally competitive and sustainable crop production and protection technologies for groundnut based cropping systems in different agro-ecological regions of India through a blend of basic and strategic multidisciplinary research. Divisions The activities of the Institute is primarily handled by five divisions, each entrusted with specific tasks. Crop Production Crop Production division is involved in the research on improvement of production technologies of groundnut for which it focusses on the Development of sustainable packages of practices for groundnut based cropping system and management of existing and emerging problems of soil and water salinity for groundnut production.

It caters to: # Economics of groundnut cultivation in major growing areas # Impact assessment of improved groundnut production technologies: Sustainable livelihood analysis # Development of statistical models for evaluation of field trials on groundnut crop and determination of scenarios in area and production  AICRP-Groundnut  The ICAR had set up an All India Coordinated research Project on Oilseeds (AICORPO) in the year 1967 for coordinating research on various oil seed crops of India. Subsequently the groundnut crop was delineated from the AICORPO set up and was given an independent status as All India Coordinated Research Project on Groundnut (AICRP-G) during 1992 (beginning of VIII-Plan). Besides in-house research projects, an umbrella research project ‚ÄòAll India Coordinated Research Project on Groundnut‚Äô or AICRPG in short, also operates from the NRCG (DGR), Junagadh. This project is funded by the funds which are allotted separately by the ICAR under the head ‚ÄòPlan‚Äô. The AICRPG was originally located at Akola, from where it was shifted to NRCG (DGR), Junagadh in the year 1987. Under AICRPG, the country is divided into five zones keeping mainly the agroclimate of the region in view. The coordinated inter- disciplinary location specific research is being conducted in collaboration with theSAU‚Äôs, several ICAR Institutes and KVK‚Äôs. The Director with the help of principal investigators/scientists of the NRCG (DGR) coordinates the research programmes developed during the technical meetings of the AICRPG at the national level. At present there are five main and seventeen supporting centres under AICRPG. Mandate # Multidisciplinary research on Crop Improvement, Crop Production and Crop Protection aspects of groundnut are carried out in all the regular centres as well as selected KVKs / voluntary centres, across the country, in the areas of : # Development of high yielding varieties possessing resistance/field tolerance to drought, diseases and pests; high temperature, salinity and acid soils. # Development of groundnut based cropping system and economically viable production and protection technologies for exploiting the potential yield of the crop variety and thereby reducing gaps between realizable and potential. # Demonstration of proven production and processing technologies on quality aspects through On- Farm Demonstrations for the benefit of farmers in target areas. # Identification of stable sources of resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses at hot spots and their utilization in varietal improvement programme through national and international collaboration. # Production of Nucleus and Breeder seed of nationally important varieties.

Changes  In conjunction with the permanent increase of the manpower strength of the Soviet armed forces, the service branches and arms were formed by orders of the People' Commissariat of Defence, consisting of artillery, air force, air defence forces, signals corps, corps of engineers and the armoured corps. Major combat support units up to command level were established. This process was characterized by a need for well qualified command staff, in a suitable rank structure. The Soviet state ‚Äì and party administration ‚Äì responded to these challenges by the introduction of additional higher ranks, as well as by reintroducing the traditional Russian rank insignia. A new rank group at OF-9 level (equivalent to the general of the branch in the Wehrmacht and the Imperial Russian Army) was introduced, named marshal of the branch or chief marshal of the branch.

Many computer chips, especially those in mobile devices or Internet of things devices are constrained by the power available (for example, they are limited to the power stored in a battery) and face varying workloads. In other situations a chip may be constrained by the amount of heat it is allowed to generate. In addition, individual chips can vary in their efficiency due to many factors, including minor differences in manufacturing conditions. AVS allows the voltage supplied to the chip, and therefore its power consumption, to be continuously adjusted to be appropriate to the workload and the parameters of the specific chip. This is accomplished by integrating a device that monitors the performance of the chip (a hardware performance manager) into the chip, which then provides information to a power controller. AVS is similar in its goal to dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) and dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS). All three approaches aim to reduce power usage and heat generation. However AVS adapts the voltage directly to the conditions on the chip, allowing it to address real-time power requirements as well as chip-to-chip variations and changes in performance that occur as the chip ages. Dynamic Approaches to reduce power in digital circuits  Background  Technological advances have enabled very powerful and versatile computing systems to be implemented on smaller chips. As this allows a larger number of functions to take place in the same area, both current density and the associated power dissipation become more concentrated compared to larger chips. The power consumption and thermal performance of integrated circuits has become a limiting factor for high-performance systems. Mobile devices are also limited by the total amount of power available. Minimizing power consumption in digital CMOS circuits requires significant design effort at all levels. Supply voltage reduction is one way to achieve this, but static supply voltage reduction can reduce performance. Dynamic voltage scaling systems are used to adjust the supply voltage to the specific operations the chip is performing. However, conventional DVS systems do not directly monitor the performance of the chip and must therefore accommodate operation under worst-case performance scenarios. AVS aims to supply each individual domain of the system on the chip with just enough voltage to perform its task under the conditions actually experienced by the chip, minimizing power consumption per processor domain.  Advantages of AVS  Adaptive voltage scaling is a closed-loop DVS approach that evaluates different factors, such as process variations from device to device on a chip, temperature fluctuations during chip operations, and load variations, and establishes a voltage-frequency relationship for the circuit under those conditions. Each individual chip's process corner is determined either during manufacturing or during runtime and the optimal voltage-frequency relationship is determined and subsequently used for voltage optimization. The advantages offered by this approach are: *Delivery of the desired voltage to every block of the system despite variations in temperature, process corner and frequency; *Processor- and architecture-independent implementation of power reduction; *Typical savings of about 55% compared to open-loop Dynamic Voltage Scaling approaches. Adaptive voltage scaling is used to address the energy-saving requirements of application-specific integrated circuits, microprocessors and system on a chip circuits. It is also well-suited for high-volume systems such as data centers and wireless base stations, as well as power-constrained applications such as portable devices, USB peripherals, and consumer electronics.  Comparison between DVS and AVS  The primary difference between DVS and AVS is that the former has an open loop control architecture whereas the latter is closed-loop. That is, in AVS there is direct feedback between the performance of the chip and the voltage provided to it.  DVS  A generic DVS system has a performance manager, a phase-locked loop and a voltage regulator. The performance manager uses a software interface to predict the performance requirements of the next task. Once the power requirements have been determined, the voltage and frequency are set by the performance manager. The phase-locked loop accomplishes the frequency scaling depending on the target frequency set by the performance manager. Similarly, the voltage regulator is programmed to scale the supply voltage in order to achieve the target voltage for the task. DVS systems use a one-to-one mapping of the voltage to frequency to perform the voltage scaling. Frequency-voltage pairs are determined by characterizing the chip's performance under worst-case conditions and stored in a lookup table. If conditions are more favorable, there may be a significant over-supply of power.  AVS  In closed-loop systems such as AVS, actual on-chip conditions are measured and used to determine the target voltage and frequency. Several different implementations of AVS have been developed. = Critical Path Emulation = Critical Path Monitoring Technique for Adaptive Voltage Scaling One way to determine the voltage-frequency relationship of the chip is to use a critical path emulator. The emulator is tuned during the manufacturing process to closely model the behavior of the chip, and adapts to environmental and process variations. Measuring the behavior of the emulator allows the supply voltage to be automatically adjusted such that the minimum voltage is supplied for the target task. A ring oscillator that operates at the same voltage as that of the rest of the chip can be used as a critical path emulator. The ring oscillator's measured frequency indicates the voltage-frequency relationship for the chip under the conditions in which it is operating. Another type of emulator is a \\"delay chain\\" of inverters, NAND gates, wire segments, etc. The exact setting of the delay chain is determined during manufacturing after testing. The delay chain is then used to measure the time taken for a process to traverse the chain, simulating the performance of the chip. Both the ring oscillator and critical path methods suffer from the problem that they may not offer a perfect simulation of the operation of the chip, so that a safety margin must be included. = Direct measurement of circuit behavior = An alternative to simulating the behavior of the critical path is to measure circuit performance directly. One implementation of this approach, called Razor, is based on the idea that only a subset of input patterns will activate the longest timing path on the chip. If the voltage is too low, these input patterns will create a timing error. However, chips have error-correction systems built into them, so a low number of errors can be tolerated. The number of errors is measured and used as feedback to the power system: if the number of errors is very low, then the voltage can be dropped to save power; if the number of errors is above a certain threshold, then the voltage must be increased. = Compensation for age-related performance degradation = Over time, chips develop negative-bias temperature instability, which increases the voltage required to operate correctly. AVS can be used to mitigate this issue by increasing the voltage to match the new requirements of the system. This is possible only if the operational degradation due to temperature instability is accurately captured by the performance sensor in the AVS system.

Biography Dinesh Subba was born in 1962 in Tumsong Tea State of Darjeeling. He was greatly influenced by musical and literary ambience of Darjeeling in those days. It is yet said that every home in Darjeeling has one guitar and one singer at the least. Maestros like Ambar Gurung, Gopal yonzan, Shanti Thatal, Sharan Ranjit, Aruna Lama, Karma yonzon, Kumar Subba, Pema Lama, Dawa Gylamo are source of his inspiration in his musical journey. Winning Gorkha Dukha Niwaran and Devkota Sangit in Darjeeling inspired Subba to pursue his music career seriously. Till today's date, he joyously recalls the event when he received the award from music maestro Shanti Thatal. In the 1980s he left for Kathmandu with Rs 700 and blessings from his mother. He found a job of school teacher and music teacher. He passes then Radio Nepal's voice test in the same batch with Shambhu Rai, Thule Rai and Nishan Bhattarai.http://www.nagariknews.com/entertainment/music/story/26936.html To establish himself firmly, he won the Radio Nepal's singing competition in celebration of its 37th establishment. As well, he was conferred with the best music composer on the occasion of 45th establishment of Radio Nepal. Veteran singer Deep Shrestha advised him that there was an opening in the then Royal Nepal Academy. He applied for the position of singer and was appointed by a government panel headed by music director (Mahasangeetkar) Amber Gurung. His song numbers \\"Thaha Napai Maya Mero\\" (), \\"Maile Rojeko Phul\\" () and \\"Dherai Dekhe Sapani Ma\\" (, music by Mansing Thulung and lyrics by Chhetra Pratap) were hugely popular across the country. Gradually, he made his identity as a composer than a singer.

It is the seat of the Catholic parish of the same name of the Vicariate of Recco-Uscio-Camogli, Archdiocese of Genoa. The abbey is located in a small bay beneath a steep wooded hill. It can only be reached by sea or by hiking trails, there is no road access. St Fructuosus The abbey is dedicated to Saint Fructuosus, a third-century bishop of Tarraco (now Tarragona in north-east Spain) who was martyred under the persecutions of the Roman Emperor Valerian. In the eighth century the relics of Fructuosus were moved here by Greek monks. St Fructuosus's ashes are still kept at the abbey. History The abbey church The abbey was founded by the Order of Saint Benedict and most of its buildings date to the tenth and eleventh centuries. The original tenth-century church tower had a Byzantine-style spherical top; this was later replaced by the present octagonal tower. The cloisters are twelfth century and were modified in the sixteenth century by Andrea Doria. The building facing the sea was built in the thirteenth century to a similar design to the noble palaces of Genoa. The abbey contains tombs of members of the noble Genoan Doria family dating from 1275 to 1305, along with other tombs and an ancient Roman sarcophagus. The Doria tombs have black and white stripes, typical of Ligurian architecture of the period. Above the abbey stands Torre Doria, a watchtower erected in 1562 by the family of Admiral Andrea Doria (1466‚Äì1560), who defended the abbey and its supply of fresh water from Barbary pirates. In the 17th century the abbey went into decline, and parts of it were used for keeping sheep. In 1730 Camillo Doria restored the abbey, and returned the church to liturgical use. Some of the buildings were damaged by flooding in 1915, these were restored by the Italian state in 1933. In 1983 the Doria Pamphili family donated the San Fruttuoso complex to the heritage organisation Fondo Ambiente Italiano. Restoration of the buildings started in 1985 and was completed in 2017.

The short line opened in 1896, and it was worked by the Caledonian Railway. The sparse local population did not sustain the line long, and passenger services were withdrawn in 1931; an experimental resumption in 1938 was brief and unsuccessful. Goods services continued, and construction at an RAF base in the early 1960s brought some business but the line closed completely in 1964. History Early proposals System map of the Brechin and Edzell District RailwayBrechin was an important town but its manufacturing output, and its requirement for coal and agricultural minerals, were stifled because of the difficulty of transport to and from the nearest harbour where coastal shipping was available: Montrose. Robert Stevenson was commissioned in 1819 to report on a means of transport between Brechin and Montrose. Brechin was a natural distribution centre for the locality, and the local sandstone was in demand for the construction of buildings in London. A canal was proposed but the topography of the district was a problem, and Stevenson recommended consideration of an iron railway. The primitive locomotives of the day were inadequate for the gradients encountered, but Stevenson proposed several alternatives, including a route consisting of level sections with intermediate inclined planes worked by stationary engines, and a route that descended from Brechin on a steady gradient of 1 in 414. Stevenson admitted that some of his proposals were technically unproven, and passenger revenue was forecast to be only ¬£50 per annum. Stevenson's plan was not adopted. Promoters in Brechin revived the idea of a railway in 1836, when they called in the engineering consultants Grainger and Miller. A viable survey was presented, but it was not immediately adopted, and a revised scheme was surveyed in 1839 by which time a new wet dock was being built in Montrose. The 1839 scheme was not adopted and once again nothing was done. The Aberdeen Railway The frenzy of railway speculation in the 1840s led to a number of railway schemes in the northern areas of Scotland. It was thought important to link Aberdeen to the planned network further south, and it began to become clear that Perth was going to be a focus. Perth was the lowest crossing point on the River Tay, and bridging the Firth at any lower point presented challenges beyond the technological capability of the time. Railways already existed from Dundee to Forfar: the Dundee and Arbroath Railway and the Arbroath and Forfar Railway had been opened in 1838, although their planned link at Arbroath had not been constructed. Now a railway was planned to run from Perth to Forfar: this became the Scottish Midland Junction Railway (SMJR) and was authorised by Parliament in 1845. Another line was promoted to reach Aberdeen, and there was controversy over the route. One scheme was to run from Forfar to Aberdeen by way of Brechin, but an alternative was to leave the existing Arboath and Forfar line near Friockheim, a few miles from Arbroath and take a course that by-passed Brechin. The second scheme would shorten the mileage of new construction required, but Brechin would only be served by a branch line. The population of Brechin in 1841 was 3,951.UK Census Information, 1841 The second scheme was the one adopted, and the Aberdeen Railway obtained Parliamentary authority on that basis on 31 July 1845, the same day as the SMJR. The Aberdeen Railway opened part of its main line on 1 February 1848, from Friockheim to Bridge of Dun and Dubton; there were branches, opened at the same time, to Brechin (from Bridge of Dun) and Montrose (from Dubton). Although Brechin was not on the main line, it had its connection to Montrose. The Aberdeen Railway had run out of money at this point and it was not until 1 February 1850 that it reached Aberdeen, and even then this was a temporary terminus at Ferryhill, on the outskirts of the Burgh. The Brechin station was on the east side of the town, facing Montrose. A railway to Edzell Brechin had a railway, and in the later decades of the nineteenth century, Edzell, a small village a few miles north of Brechin, had established itself as a popular holiday centre, and this led to thoughts of connecting it with the railway network at Brechin. The population of Edzell parish was less than 1,000 in 1891. A railway was proposed in 1889, and the Brechin and Edzell District Railway Act was given the Royal Assent on 4 August 1890. The capital was ¬£50,000. In the same Parliamentary session, the Forfar and Brechin Railway (F&BR;) was authorised. This was seen as a possible alternative main line route to Aberdeen (although later difficulties with agreeing a route in Forfar prevented the design of a route avoiding reversal there). The existing Brechin terminus built by the Aberdeen Railway, by now absorbed into the Caledonian Railway, was not suitable for altering into a through station, and the F&BR; was to join the Brechin to Bridge of Dun line east of Brechin. This cut across the authorised Edzell line, and the Brechin and Edzell company had to get an Act of Parliament modifying their route to make it compatible; they did so in 1893 (the Brechin and Edzell Railway Amendment Act 1893). They had originally intended an independent terminus, but the 1893 Act authorised their use of the Caledonian station. The short line took some time to build; it was inspected by Colonel York for the Board of Trade on 30 May 1896 and passed; it opened to goods trains on 1 June 1896 and to passengers on 8 June 1896. There was one intermediate station, at Inchbare, and the Caledonian Railway worked the line for 50% of gross receipts. There were eight daily return passenger trains in the 1920s. The railway was worked by the Caledonian Railway as a branch of its own network; the original B&EDR; Company remained independent, simply collecting the lease charge, until the grouping of the railways in 1923, following the Railways Act 1921. The Company was then absorbed into the new London Midland and Scottish Railway. Closure The passenger service on the line never developed, and passenger trains were discontinued after 27 April 1931. An experimental resumption took place on 4 July 1938 but this was unsuccessful, and final passenger closure took place on 27 September 1938. A light goods service continued, sustained in later years by the upgrading of RAF Edzell for a US Air Force base; however finally on 7 September 1964 the goods service ceased, and the Edzell branch closed completely. Topography The line was 6.5 miles (9 km) long. Approaching Brechin the line curved eastward, joining the Forfar and Brechin line at Brechin North Junction; the combined route then curved round the east end of the town to enter the original Aberdeen Railway terminus. The final approach to Brechin station was on a steep falling gradient. The line opened on 8 June 1896 and closed to passengers on 27 April 1931; it reopened to passengers on 4 July 1938 and closed finally to passengers on 27 September 1938; it closed completely on 7 September 1964. Stations and locations: * Edzell; * Inchbare; renamed Dunlappie October 1912; renamed Stracathro November 1912; * Brechin North Junction'; Forfar line trailed in; * Brechin; former Aberdeen Railway station. The authorised Forfar and Brechin line by- passed Brechin station, continuing eastwards to join the Bridge of Dun line. The Edzell line joined that alignment west of Brechin North Junction and the two single lines ran alongside one another to the North Junction signal box, where they merged to a double track, which immediately turned south and west to enter Brechin station. The three routes together formed a triangle, the F&B; line being described as the Brechin avoiding line. In fact this was never signalled as a running line: the junction at the east end of the \\"avoiding line\\" was simply a ground frame controlled connection; it was never used for passenger traffic. The avoiding line was closed in 1917 when the track materials were requisitioned for use in hostilities during World War I. On 25 February 1934 Brechin North Junction signal box was abolished, and the Edzell and Forfar routes were operated as adjacent single lines to Brechin station; the speed restriction down the gradient into Brechin was 12 mph. Brechin North Junction signal box controlled the convergence of the Edzell and Forfar lines; a double track ran from there to Brechin station.

The first five of these are still universally recognized. Some authors treat P. edelbergii as a variety of P. trollii, and P. primuloides as a variety of P. moltkioides. Some authors believe that P. lindelofioides is misplaced in Pseudomertensia, and they place it in Lindelofia as Lindelofia olgea. It is indigenous to Turkestan and Afghanistan. Lindelofia longiflora has been sampled in molecular phylogenetic studies, but L. olgea has not. The distinctive Pakistani species, Pseudomertensia sericophylla is placed by some authors in a monospecific genus as Decalepidanthus sericophyllus.Harald Udo von Riedl. 1963. \\"Decalepidanthus, eine neue Borraginaceen-Gattung aus NW- Pakistan\\".

Lentini was ordained as a priest in 1794 and served as a life-long parish priest in his hometown of Potenza where he dedicated himself to promoting Eucharistic devotion and to working alongside the poor of his area. But he also fostered a deep dedication to education and evangelization and often taught parishioners catechism and literature while also making himself available to hear the confessions of penitents. The beatification process for Lentini opened in 1905 and he became titled as Venerable in 1935. Pope John Paul II beatified Lentini on 12 October 1997 as an affirmation of his personal holiness and the manner in which Lentini conducted his duties as a noted pastor. Life Domenico Lentini was born on 20 November 1770 in Lauria as the last of five children to Macario Lentini (a shoemaker; d. 1796) and Rosalia Vitarella of poor economic conditions. The Lentini's were of Sicilian origins and first appeared in the documents of notaries around 1500. He was baptized mere hours after his birth. His siblings (in order) were: * Dominique * Rosa * Nicholas * Antoinette (d. 28.08.1830) His first two sisters Dominique and Rosa married as his did his brother Nicholas who would relocate to Fardella. His maternal uncle was the priest Domenico Vitarella. His sister Antoinette served as Lentini's housekeeper after he became a priest. In his childhood he was vivacious and often ran to trees looking for birds. Lentini received his Confirmation on 16 June 1772. In 1785 he felt a call to become a priest and he commenced his ecclesial studies alongside Giuseppe Ielpo who entered just a few months prior to him. Ielpo would later become Lentini's confessor. He began his studies in Policastro (at Salerno) from 1785 to 1787 and had to transfer his studies to Lauria due to his poor economic condition. But his father expressed his happiness at his son's vocation and was present when his son was made a priest. Lentini received his ordination into the diaconate on 27 October 1793 in Mormanno from the Bishop of Cassano all'Jonio Giovanni Battista Coppola. Lentini received his solemn ordination to the priesthood at Pentecost on 8 June 1794 in the Marsico Nuovo Cathedral from Bishop Bernardo Maria Latorre (since Policastro had no bishop at the time); he was then assigned to work as a parish priest in his hometown. He was devoted to the Eucharist and gained a reputation as a noted homilist as well as for his extensive pastoral work with the poor. He turned his home into a school where he taught theological studies and catechism to parishioners as well as other subjects such as literature. He taught such subjects to people with no need for compensation. His devotion to the Eucharist also led him to promote this among his parishioners in order to foster greater devotion to it. Lentini often subjected himself to penitential practices and he sometimes deprived himself of nourishment in the spirit of living in total and constant penance with the corporal mortification of the flesh and sleeping of the floor. He did this for the atonement of sins and in the imitation of Jesus Christ. He was also known for his frugal manner of living and sacrificed the various trappings of the priesthood to express his desire to live like the poor. Lentini was further referred to as the \\"Precursor to the Cur√© d'Ars\\" after his death due to his willingness to make himself available to hear the confessions of penitents. His long hours before the Eucharist in adoration - added with his intensive contemplation - led his contemporaries to call him \\"an angel at the altar\\" since it was believed he experienced ecstasies before the Blessed Sacrament. He was also noted for being able to convert the hearts of sinners whom he met. In February 1828 he was before the Eucharist when he suffered a sudden and severe pain that forced him to his bed. His friend Giuseppe Ielpo granted him the Extreme Unction on 22 February 1828. He died on 25 February 1828 in his home in the evening around 8:30pm with a reputation for saintliness. He died with a crucifix in hand and a lighted candle at his side. His funeral was held during a full week in which his remains emitted a sweet scent noted to be the odor of saintliness. His remains were said to have also been warm and flexible. There is a parish in Catanzaro that was named in his honor. Beatification The cause of canonization commenced on a local diocesan level from 1842 to 1844 and again from 1890 to 1893 despite the fact that the formal cause started on 12 April 1905 under Pope Pius X; this titled Lentini as a Servant of God. Theologians confirmed his writings being in line with doctrine on 8 June 1896. The cause continued in Rome in an apostolic process spanning from 1905 to 1921. The Congregation for Rites validated these processes on 23 July 1926. Members of an antepreparatory committee approved the cause on 28 October 1930 as did a preparatory one on 26 June 1931 and a general committee on 15 January 1935. It was Pope Pius XI who declared that Lentini lived a life of heroic virtue which bestowed upon him the title of Venerable on 27 January 1935. His beatification depended on papal confirmation of a miracle attributed to him. One such case was investigated and then taken to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints for assessment; the C.C.S. validated the investigation on 15 January 1993. Medical experts approved the miracle on 18 May 1995 as did the theologians on 13 October 1995 and the C.C.S. members on 4 June 1996. Pope John Paul II approved a miracle attributed to him on 17 December 1996 and presided over Lentini's beatification on 12 October 1997. The canonization all depends on papal confirmation of one more miracle; one such case is under investigation and the process of investigation received C.C.S. validation on 5 November 2010. The medical board stationed in Rome approved this healing as a miracle on 9 October 2014.

It is distinguished by its unusual leaves which are rough, leathery and covered with small, warty lumps and by its many purple heads of flowers in early spring. Description Melaleuca sclerophylla is sometimes an erect, spreading shrub and others low and ground-covering. It generally grows to a height of about but old specimens are sometimes much taller. New growth is covered with long, soft hairs. The leaves are arranged alternately, mostly glabrous except when young and each is long and wide. They are dark green, leathery, narrow oval to narrow egg- shaped, covered with warty tubercles and have an obvious mid-vein on the lower surface. The flowers are a shade of purple, arranged in heads on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering and sometimes in the upper leaf axils. Before opening, the flower buds are covered with dark-coloured bracts which fall off as the flowers open. The heads are up to in diameter and contain 7 to 10 groups of flowers in threes. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flowers, each bundle containing between 4 and 7 stamens. Flowering occurs between June and October but mostly in September and is followed by fruit which are woody capsules long, in almost spherical clusters along the stems.Melaleuca sclerophylla fruit Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca sclerophylla was first formally described in 1904 by Ludwig Diels in Botanische jahrbucher fur systematik, pflanzengeschichte und pflanzengeographie under the heading Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae occidentalis:Beitrage zur Kenntnis der Pflanzen Westaustraliens, ihrer Verbreitung und ihrer Lebensverhaltnisse (\\"Contributions to the knowledge of the plants of West Australia, where they are found and their conditions of existence\\"). The specific epithet (sclerophylla) is from the Ancient Greek words skleros meaning ‚Äúhard‚Äù or \\"tough\\" and phyllon meaning ‚Äúleaf‚Äù referring to the toughness of the leaves. Distribution and habitat Melaleuca sclerophylla occurs in the Kalbarri and Wongan Hills districts in the Avon Wheatbelt, Geraldton Sandplains and Jarrah Forest biogeographic regions growing in sand with clay or gravel on granite outcrops. Conservation This species is classified as \\"Priority Three\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife meaning that it is known from only a few locations and is not currently in imminent danger. Use in horticulture This species has been successfully grown in the southern parts of Australia in sunny positions in well-drained soils in winter-wet areas. It has also proved to be frost hardy.

It has been found that on online health support communities members tend to exhibit higher levels of empathic concern.  Comparison/contrast with empathy in offline environments  A number of studies have explored the importance of empathy in offline settings. For example, one study found that mindfulness and acceptance-based behavioral approaches may have potential for increasing empathy in interpersonal relationships. Other work has explored the link between fiction and empathy, suggesting that the experience-taking quality of fiction may increase empathy among readers. There is also evidence that individuals tend to more readily feel empathy for those that they view as similar to themselves. In online contexts, several researchers have pointed out that there are some key differences in how users interact online that may affect levels of empathy. For example, communication in online forum communities interact asynchronously, and are generally text-based rather than verbal communications. Establishment of trust in online communities may also operate differently in online environments. Furthermore, communications related interactions with others online might facilitate empathy while video or online gaming might negatively affect empathy.Carrier, L. Mark, Spradlin, A., Bunce, J. P., & Rosen, L. D. (2015). Virtual empathy: Positive and negative effects of going online upon empathy in young adults, Computers in Human Behavior, 52, 39-48.  Enablers  * Anonymity. The anonymous nature of many online communities can allow individuals to feel more comfortable disclosing more personal information, which in turn can increase feelings of trust, connectedness and empathy. * Shared interests. Because empathy tends to be strongest among those that share common experiences, the presence of niche online communities can set the stage for higher levels of empathy among members.  Barriers  * Cyberbullying is any bullying that takes place using electronic media. Studies have suggested that individuals who are bystanders, that is, witnessing someone bullying someone else, are less likely to intervene in online contexts. * Internet trolling is \\"the practice of behaving in a deceptive, destructive, or disruptive manner in a social setting on the Internet with no apparent instrumental purpose.\\" Although empirical research on trolling is limited, studies have suggested that internet trolling may be a space occupied by already-sadistic individuals who can easily disrupt conversations and communities. * Ambiguity. Because asynchronous, text- mediated online conversations lack the richness of interaction and cues that face-to-face interaction provides, online communication tends to be much more ambiguous. This ambiguity may decrease members' abilities to find similarities in one another. In both online and offline interactions, increased perceived similarity is associated with increased empathy.

He accomplished this brave feat successfully and blocked the sluice with sandbags at considerable risk to his own life. In 1930 he had also performed an act of conspicuous bravery in rescuing the boys of the Government High School and the family of the Excise Inspector, whose bungalows had been cut off by the floods.\\" :;For Meritorious Service * William Bunn, Office Keeper, Stormont Buildings, Ministry of Finance, Northern Ireland. * Frederick Charles Cartwright, Head Assistant in the Investigation Branch of the Post Office. * Frederick George Clark, Head Office Keeper, India Office. * Charles Croft, Foreman at the School of Artillery. * George Patrick William Keay, Head Messenger to the Postmaster General. * Hector James McLennan, Sergeant, Royal Corps of Signals.

Customer Journey Hijacking Customer Journey Hijacking is a rapidly growing phenomenon where unauthorized ads are injected into consumer browsers. Various injected ads include competing product recommendation widgets, banners, pop-ups, and in-text redirects which are inserted into the visitor‚Äôs web session. Ads are driven by digital malware that is downloaded through bad connections, free software bundles, and unsecured WiFi networks. This disrupts the intended online experience, and diverts earned web traffic away from ecommerce websites, cutting directly into their conversions and revenue. The majority of these injected ads redirect customers to competitor websites and promotions. Unsavory content is also featured across the site and impacts brand equity. Ad injections run on the consumer's browser and bypass server-side visibility or control over this activity.

His girlfriend and her two cousins who were in the car with him at the time of his death were injured but survived the assault. Rock-throwing incident While Currie was driving a car along the Southern Motorway in Otahuhu he was struck by an 8 kg block of concrete dropped from the Princess Street overbridge. Currie's girlfriend, Helen McCreadie, in the passenger seat, attempted to regain control of the car, but it crashed after 200 meters. Ngatai Rewiti, who was 14 years old at the time of the incident, was found not guilty of Currie's murder, but guilty of manslaughter on 6 July 2006. Rewiti has been remanded in custody and was sentenced on 6 September. His youth has attracted ongoing press attention. The stone block smashed through the windscreen of his car, struck his chin and then his chest. This fractured his sternum, which severed his heart's main artery and instantly killed him. The car then travelled another 120 metres down the motorway before striking a pole, causing minor injuries to the other three occupants of the car. Shortly afterwards the youth was arrested and charged with murder and endangering transport and appeared in the Manakau Youth Court on 23 August. There were a spate of \\"copycat\\" rock- throwing attacks in the immediate aftermath of the attack on Currie. Rocks thrown from highway overpasses is a recurring problem in New Zealand, as are rural roadside attacks on vehicles by organized groups of rock-throwers, and similar attacks on trains. Legal proceedings The murder trial began on 3 July 2006 in the Auckland High Court. Rewiti had name suppression and was identified only as \\"R\\" during the trial. The suppression was lifted after the verdict. Rewiti plead not guilty to the murder charge but admitted Currie's manslaughter. Crown Prosecutor Aaron Perkins told the jury that Rewiti did not need to have intended to kill Currie to commit murder. Under the Crimes Act 1961, death resulting from an unlawful act ‚Äì in this case either an intention to cause him harm or to cause mayhem on the motorway ‚Äì constitutes murder. Among the prosecution witnesses were Currie's girlfriend who testified that all of a sudden the windscreen shattered and Currie looked like he had been knocked out. Friends of the accused said that on the Monday following the incident, he told them what he had done. One of the friends said that Rewiti sounded proud of his actions. The jury took four hours to reach its not guilty verdict on the murder charge. The sentence, 4 years in a youth detention center, with possible parole, \\"outraged\\" Currie's family. Context The youthful rock thrower, Ngatai Rewiti, is sometimes discussed in the context of New Zealand's difficulty dealing with broken families, youthful gang violence and street crime.

He established the Capezio Foundation in 1951, which focused on dance, especially the regional ballet movement. In 1957, he founded the Capezio Awards which recognise the lifetime achievements of those in dance, including Martha Graham, Jerome Robbins, Alvin Ailey and Agnes de Mille. Sommers was also founder of the Association of American Dance Companies. In 1978, the same year he managed to persuade the United States Postal Service to issue stamps commemorating dance, he established National Dance Week, followed by International Dance Week in 1985. Born in New York City, Sommers became a stock boy at Capezio at the age of 14 and worked his way up to become company president in 1940. One of his earliest achievements was supplying shoes to the 1923 Ziegfeld Follies production. In 1962 Sommers married Estelle Loshin, n√©e Goldstein, (1919-1994). Like him, she was a dancewear specialist who in 1947 transformed her first husband's store, Loshin's, into a retailer of leotards and other outfits. From 1964-1975 Estelle managed the Capezio Fashion Shop, where she innovated spandex bodywear, and from 1970 until her death in 1994 she was vice president and head administrator for the Capezio Dance-Theatre shops. Sommers died at Lenox Hill Hospital on 30 April 1985, after suffering a heart attack shortly after attending that year's Capezio Awards.

This genus of bacteria lacks a cell wall around their cell membrane. Without a cell wall, they are unaffected by many common antibiotics such as penicillin or other beta-lactam antibiotics that target cell wall synthesis. Mycoplasma are the smallest bacterial cells yet discovered, can survive without oxygen and are typically about 0.1 ¬µm in diameter. It was first described in 1974 and has been considered a rare inhabitant of humans. It is considered to usually be a commensal and is a rare bacteria of the normal microbiota of the human oropharynx; it is sometimes cultured from oropharynx of nonhuman primates. However, recent reports have proposed that in common with Mycoplasma hominis, M. faucium may be a pathogen in some brain abscesses. The type strain is strain ATCC 25293 = NCTC 10174.
