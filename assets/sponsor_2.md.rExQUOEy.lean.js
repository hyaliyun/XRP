He was linked to Hun Sen, the current Prime Minister, whom he met in Vietnam in 1979: during the 1997 military coup, he commanded troops loyal to Hun Sen; as well, his daughter, Hok Chindavy, is married to one of Hun Sen‚Äôs sons, Hun Manit.  Biography  Hok Lundy was born in Ta Pov village, Bavet commune, Chanthrea District, Svay Rieng Province to a family of Chinese-Vietnamese origin. Hok Lundy's Vietnamese ancestry was often extensively discussed in public circles, and at least one close aide of Hok Lundy, Cheam Yeap confirmed that he had some Vietnamese ancestry and fluent in the Vietnamese language as well. He spent his early days in his hometown until 1977 when he fled to Vietnam to become a spy for the Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation. Hok Lundy returned to Cambodia following the fall of the Khmer Rouge, and served in various executive ranks under the People's Republic of Kampuchea in his home province. In 1990, Hok Lundy became the president of the People‚Äôs Committee for Phnom Penh. He served as the governor of Svay Rieng Province for 9 months between January and September 1994, before was appointed as the National Police Commissioner. In the aftermath of the 1997 coup, Funcinpec officials accused Hok Lundy of ordering the attempted murder of Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh; that same day, Hok Lundy accused Funcinpec of plotting the assassination of Hun Sen, vice-Prime Minister Sar Kheng, and himself. In February 2006, Hok Lundy was denied a visa to visit the United States due to suspicion of involvement in drug trafficking and human trafficking. In March 2006, he was awarded a medal by the FBI for his efforts in fighting terrorism, and in 2007, he was granted a visa so that he could attend counterterrorism talks.state.gov Heng Pov, a former police chief in Phnom Penh, accused Hok Lundy of involvement in over 70 deaths, including those of several high-profile Cambodian figures such as Pisith Pilika; in return, Hok Lundy accused Heng Pov of involvement in several other murders, including that of a judge. Human Rights Watch described Hok Lundy as \\"represent(ing) the absolute worst that Cambodia has to offer\\", and said that \\"aside from his boss, Prime Minister Hun Sen, there is hardly anyone in Cambodia who has shown more contempt for the rule of law than Hok Lundy\\" Hok Lundy was killed on November 9, 2008, in a helicopter crash in heavy rain, along with General Sok Sa Em, the pilot, and the co-pilot.Police chief dies in chopper crash The official cause of the crash was cited as bad weather and possibly a lightning strike. The helicopter may have also hit something on the way down.Cambodia probes chopper crash that killed police chief Later independent investigations, possibly aligned with opposition political parties, have suggested that the crash may have been caused by sabotage or a missile fired from the ground.

The character first appeared in Bishop: The Mountjoy Crisis #1. Fictional character biography Mountjoy is a mutant who was trained by the Emplates to merge with another person's body in order to feed. Originally from the same future as Bishop, Mountjoy went through one of Trevor Fitzroy‚Äôs time portals while inside the body of Bantam. He then left Bantam after he arrived. After, when Fitzroy was presumed dead, Mountjoy hunted down Bantam for he was the only one who knew of Mountjoy's presence. Chasing Bantam, Mountjoy encountered Bishop, whose sister Shard once captured and imprisoned Mountjoy in their future. Mountjoy defeated Bishop while merging with Storm and using her as a hostage. Mountjoy then released Storm and escaped. Later, Mountjoy was found by Bishop at a New York Police Station. While chasing each other downtown, Mountjoy ambushed and absorbed Bishop. Arriving at the X-Mansion in Bishop's body, Mountjoy divested Bishop and went after the other X-Men. He found and absorbed Archangel, Gambit and Psylocke. Mountjoy was then lured into the Danger Room by Shard. Inside the Danger Room, Mountjoy fought off Bishop with powers from the three X-Men he absorbed. Not knowing the Shard was a hologram, Mountjoy tried to absorb her but couldn't. Shard held Mountjoy in place as Bishop fired an energy blast at him. The blast forced Mountjoy to let go of Archangel, Gambit and Psylocke, and he was defeated. Mountjoy would later infiltrate the Inner Circle of the London Hellfire Club, and merge inside the Circle's recorder Scribe. Brian Braddock was sent by Shinobi Shaw to find Mountjoy. Mountjoy, hiding in Scribe's body, would confide in Braddock and pose as his ally. When the Inner Circle's plans were revealed, and Braddock donned his Captain Britain costume, Mountjoy and the Black Queen Ms. Steed attacked Captain Britain. After Steed was defeated, Mountjoy tried to escape. Captain Britain caught up with him and knocked him out. Mountjoy and the Inner Circle were then put in jail. Mountjoy, still in Scribe's body, was bailed out of jail by Sebastian Shaw. Taken to Liberty Island, Mountjoy was put in a duel against Madelyne Pryor. Using Scribe's powers, Mountjoy nearly defeated Madelyne and closed in for the kill. Madelyne then reached inside Scribe and pulled out Mountjoy, defeating him. Mountjoy's current whereabouts are unknown. However, it is known that he retained his mutant powers after M-Day.X-Men: Endangered Species #1 Powers and abilities Mountjoy can merge his body into another's two different ways. One is by becoming a \\"silent partner\\": His will dominates, your body remains the same, his facial features dominate and his energy is renewed. The second is by a \\"hostile takeover\\" that absorbs you, mind, body and soul while also renewing him. He also generates a basilisk field, slowing the reaction time of his victims within a five-yard area where he exerts.

Najaceras is characterized by a longitudinal mound of material that runs forward from the apical region along the inside of the top of the siphuncle known as a dorsal process. This process, which is somewhat broad in aspect, is concave ventrally. The opening between the dorsal process and the endocone forms a dorsally concave crescent shape. The process is bisected in the lower port by which is known as a blade which bifurcates upwardly from about the middle. The genus Najaceras is based on Najaceras triangulatum (Flower, 1971) which comes from the Oil Creek Limestone on West Spring Creek, 3 miles east of Pooleville, Oklahoma. The holotype and paratype are at the U.S. National Museum. Two other species from the same area have been identified and named: N. bilobatum, and N. chevroniferum (Flower, 1976). Najaceras probably gave rise to the similar Meniscoceras which also has a dorsal process. Based on that unique feature the two are placed in their own family, the Najaceratidae. Najaceras comes from \\"naja\\", the word for the crescent at the bottom of the Navajo squash blossom or wedding necklace. References * Flower, R.

The episode told the story of a teenage boy struggling to come to terms with his sexuality. It was nominated for three Daytime Emmy Awards, winning for Outstanding Direction in Children's Programming.Awards - CBS Schoolbreak Special The 1993 episode \\"Other Mothers\\" featured a boy who was afraid that his friends would think he was gay because he has two mothers. The episode was nominated for five Daytime Emmys, winning for Outstanding Writing in a Children's Special, Outstanding Performer in a Children's Special (Justin Whalin) and Outstanding Sound Mixing in a Children's Special. In 1986, HBO broadcast The Truth About Alex, which told the story of a high school athlete who discovers that his best friend Alex is gay.  LGBT representation on Nickelodeon  On June 18, 2002, children's cable network Nickelodeon ran a program entitled Nick News Special Edition: My Family Is Different. Produced by Linda Ellerbee's Lucky Duck Productions and hosted by Ellerbee, My Family Is Different featured children of gay and lesbian parents talking with children from households that oppose equal rights for gay and lesbian families.GLAAD 2002 This program was subject to much criticism from Christian organizations, such as the Washington-based Traditional Values Coalition, who believed the program pushed a \\"pro-homosexual agenda\\" and was not suitable for children.Another organization that opposed this episode was the Parents Television Council who claimed they had no problem with same-sex parents but did not think it was appropriate for Nickelodeon's young target audience. Nickelodeon followed a similar path. On December 19, 2014, The Legend of Korra, a Nickelodeon show, aired their season finale, which showed Korra and Asami holding hands, showing they are in a relationship. As such, the show became one of the first western children's animation series to not only feature major LGBT characters, but also a lead LGBT character. In the aftermath of series finale, which aired on Nickelodeon and Nick.com, there were debates about \\"queer representation in children's media.\\" Some noted that while the relationship between two bisexual characters, Korra and Asami, was built up during the course of the series, the words \\"I love you\\" were never uttered, nor did the characters kiss. Similarly, Kya of Legend of Korra was shown to be lesbian in the graphic novel following the series finale. On June 2, 2015, gay drag queen RuPaul guest stared as a snail in the episode \\"Costume Boxing!\\" of series Bubble Guppies. The next year, Nickelodeon's Hey Arnold! was confirmed to have two gay characters. Eugene Horowitz and Mr. Robert Simmons were confirmed as gay in July 2016 by the show's creator show's creator Craig Bartlett, but not explicitly stated in the series. On July 20, 2016, an interracial gay couple, Howard and Harold McBride, was introduced in an episode of The Loud House titled \\"Overnight Success.\\" This couple was described by Michael Rubiner, executive producer of the show from 2018 to present, as only natural, Even so, the latter was censored by a South African broadcaster, DStv, despite the fact that it was met with \\"overwhelmingly positive reaction.\\" They would be the first pair of married male characters to be depicted on a Nickelodeon series. In later years, Luna Loud would be revealed as a bisexual girl who sent a love letter to a girl named Sam Sharp in the September 2017 episode \\"L is for Love\\". Later on, Sam seems to feel similarly about Luna and appears to reciprocate Luna's feelings in that episode and others, with Lori describing them as beginning to date in the episode \\"Racing Hearts,\\" though neither character calls their excursion a date throughout the episode.This GLAAD report says \\"Nickelodeon‚Äôs The Loud House still features bisexual character Luna Loud, and showed her starting to date Sam, a girl from school, earlier this year.\\" Apart from this, in August 2019, the voice actor for Dana Dufresne, Maddie Taylor, revealed that the character had transitioned from a man to a trans woman, like herself, and said that the character would return in another episode within season 4. However, Season 4 concluded on July 23, 2020 and no such episode or even appearance of Dana was shown. Additionally, the show featured two lesbian characters. In a February 2020 episode, Lainey, one of Lynn's roller derby team, is dating a girl named Alice. In October 2017 it was reported that a kiss between two female characters, Zarya Moonwolf and Kitty Boon, on the Nickelodeon show, Mysticons, was in danger of being cut. Despite this, the show showed the \\"development of a female-female romance,\\" between Zarya, a main character, and her childhood friend, Kitty, known as \\"MoonBoon,\\" culminating in romantic moments. Months later, on August 2018, the show's creator, Sean Jara, confirmed the two as a couple, noting that only one version of the episode was created and that the show's creative team fought for a kiss, but lost even though they managed \\"to keep the integrity of the love story.\\" This consists of the tweet stream by Sean Jara, which seemed better to use than citing every individual tweet. In later tweets, Jara said there is a \\"beautiful love story\\" between Zarya and Kitty in the show, referring to the interactions between the two characters in episode 37 (\\"The Princess and the Pirate\\"), stated the importance of showing \\"love between LGBTQ characters on TV,\\" and said that the kiss was cut from the episode because of \\"systemic homophobia\\" in the kids television industry, crediting Rebecca Sugar for making strides. He then opined on the continual battle for more LGBTQ representation, cited an Entertainment Weekly article about LGBTQ representation in cartoons,Specifically an article titled \\"From Steven Universe to Voltron: The fight to bring LGBTQ characters to kids' shows\\" by Nick Romano. and praised the battles for more representation which go on behind the scenes. He said this saying that Nick did not pick up the show for more than 40 episodes and, once again, confirmed Kitty and Zarya as a lesbian couple. Later, in September, Jara said that they treated the Kitty and Zarya relationship \\"like all the other relationships in the show.\\" He added that while he was nervous and aware of possible roadblocks, Matt Ferguson, the show's director, supported it, as did his writing team, with Ferguson adding that pushback came from not from people who were \\"evil\\" but rather from those who were \\"trying to do the best job at their particular job.\\" In 2019, Nickelodeon released 'Rocko's Modern Life: Static Cling, a TV movie and sequel to their 1993 series Rocko's Modern Life through Netflix. The producers worked with GLAAD to endure that the transgender character, in the form of cartoonist frog Rachel Bighead (known as Ralph Bighead in the original series) as well as a plotline involving her coming out to her parents, Ed and Bev Bighead, was respectful to the LGBTQ+ community and fit within the show itself. The same year, in September, animated miniseries, Middle School Moguls began airing on the channel. One of the characters was a non-binary fashion mogul named Wren. In 2020, Nickelodeon debuted a new TV show, Danger Force, which portrayed two dads of a lost child in which Danger Force was trying to find his parents. The same show also featured all four members (two male, two female) having a crush on male heartthrob, Creston.  LGBT representation on PBS  In 2005, PBS planned to release an episode of the children's series Postcards from Buster in which the animated bunny, Buster Baxter, visits the children of two lesbian mothers. When education secretary Margaret Spellings stated disapproval of the planned episode, PBS withdrew plans for airing. Spellings believed the episode to be inappropriate for children as well as a misuse of governmental funding that the show had received. Lisa Reilly (WGBH Member Services), stands by the episode stating that, \\"We believe, as do WGBH's educational advisers on this series, that the program is appropriate for our audience and fits the series' mission to introduce children to the rich and varied cultures that make up the United States, including kids living in a wide range of family structures.\\" Apart from Reilly's statement, then-PBS chief operating officer Wayne Godwin said the episode brought up an issue that was ‚Äúbest left for parents and children to address together at a time and manner of their own choosing,‚Äù while spokesperson Lea Sloan said it was ‚Äúsensitive in today‚Äôs political climate.‚Äù Godwin also claimed that the episode conflicted with PBS‚Äòs purpose. This rationale was criticized by FAIR for violating the \\"terms of its Education Department grant,\\" calling what PBS did an act of \\"political pandering,\\" and asking people to contact PBS, calling on them to \\"support programming according to their mandate, not political pressures.\\" Years later, Rebecca Sugar described Spellings' idea as \\"absurd,\\" saying she recognized the challenges of creating LGBTQ+-friendly animation when she tried to enter the animation field. In 2019, PBS aired an Arthur episode titled ‚ÄúMr. Ratburn and the Special Someone,‚Äù the Season 22 premiere, which featured Mr. Ratburn and Patrick marry each other. He and his husband are the first LGBT characters in the series. Later, the episode was banned by some Alabama broadcasters. In 2020, an episode of Clifford the Big Red Dog aired on Amazon Prime Video and PBS Kids, titled \\"Dogbot\\". It featured the two moms of the character Samantha Mulberry (Dr. and Ms. Mulberry).  LGBT representation on Cartoon Network  In the 2010s, Cartoon Network became one of the key places for shows with LGBTQ characters and storylines. Some reviewers argued that when Disney and Cartoon Network are compared, its \\"easy to see who actually cares about LGBT representation,\\" noting that for shows on Cartoon Network, \\"LGBT characters aren't centered around their sexuality.\\" Others noted that the network hosted shows which were \\"strong champions for LGBT representation,\\" like Adventure Time and Steven Universe. However, the creator of Steven Universe, Rebecca Sugar was told point-blank by executives that queer romance could have ended their show.  LGBT representation on Disney Channel  On February 13, 2016, series finale of Gravity Falls, aired on the Disney Channel featured Sheriff Blubs and Deputy Durland confirmed as a gay couple. In 2017, Disney Channel in the United Kingdom aired a coming out scene on The Lodge, where Josh (Joshua Sinclair-Evans) explains to another character that girls are \\"not his type\\". The scene was the first coming out scene to be aired on a Disney Channel series. Also in 2017, Disney the creators of Andi Mack had the character Cyrus Goodman played by Joshua Rush come out as gay in the episode titled \\"Hey, Who Wants Pizza?\\" which was the first episode of season 2. In an effort to ensure the story arc was age appropriate for the network's young audience, Disney consulted with groups such as PFLAG, GLAAD, Common Sense Media, and The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy. In a 2019 episode titled \\"One and a Minyan\\", Cyrus became the first Disney character ever to say the word \\"gay\\" in its modern meaning when coming out to his male best friend, Jonah Beck (portrayed by Asher Angel). In the episode's finale, Cyrus held hands with the character TJ Kippen, and the two were confirmed to be a couple by various members of the cast and crew. These were not the channel's first depiction of LGBT characters as Good Luck Charlie debuted the channel's first lesbian couple on January 26th, 2014. The couple was introduced when the series' main character Charlie has a playdate with her friend Taylor. When Charlie's parents answer the door, they are shocked to find that \\"Taylor has two moms!\\" as Bob, Charlie's dad exclaims. While many celebrities tweeted their support (including former Disney star Miley Cyrus), conservative watch group One Million Moms was not quiet about their disapproval of the episode and launched an email campaign against the network. They were joined in support by other conservative groups such as Family Research Council. A number of others shows with LGBTQ characters aired on the Disney Channel and Disney XD. One of those was Star vs. the Forces of Evil. One character Jackie Lynn Thomas was bisexual. First she dated a male character but ended that relationship due to his feelings for the protagonist. Then, in the episode \\"Britta's Tacos\\", it is revealed that Jackie has a relationship with a French girl named Chlo√©. As such, it is clear that Jackie is bisexual. The show, also in 2017, has an episode, \\"Just Friends,\\" featuring a scene where tens of couples kissed, including a same sex couple. Another Disney show also featured LGBTQ characters: Star Wars Resistance, which aired from 2018 to 2020 on the Disney Channel and Disney XD. In this animation, Orka and Flix run the Office of Acquisitions on the Colossus, with Orka doing the negotiations. Justin Ridge, an executive producer for the show, said that its safe to call them a couple, adding \\"they‚Äôre absolutely a gay couple and we‚Äôre proud of that\\" on the Coffee With Kenobi podcast. There were also a few shows which aired on Disney Junior. For instance, Doc McStuffins, featured a lesbian (and interracial) married couple, Thea and Edie. These two characters would be the first same-sex couple featured in a Disney Junior pre-school series. A few years later, an episode of T.O.T.S., \\"Seas the Day,\\" aired on the same channel. In the episode, a baby dolphin named Donny is adopted by a dolphin lesbian couple. Despite these positives, Disney executives did not always receive LGBTQ characters and relationships positively. They, for instance, axed a proposed lesbian relationship in Gravity Falls, at the same time that Gumball was censored for supposed \\"homosexual overtones\\" by various countries, and the National Expert Commission of Ukraine on the Protection of Public Morality in Ukraine advised the banning of SpongeBob SquarePants on the grounds that it promoted homosexuality. As such, Disney has been criticized for its approach to LGBTQ representation as compared to Cartoon Network.  LGBT representation on Amazon Video  In 2017, Amazon Video premiered the animated video series Danger & Eggs, for what would become its only season. The show, co-created by a trans woman named Shadi Petosky, was filled with LGBTQ+ characters: a femme \\"brown-skinned energetic creative\\" named Reina, a genderqueer character named Milo, who uses they/them pronouns Furthermore, the voice of Milo, an agender model named Tyler Ford said their character is an \\"accurate representation\\" of them. The show's final episode introduced the dads of Corporate Raider Jim, and a new trans teen, Zadie, who sings about acceptance and helps the series protagonists understand the meaning of a chosen family. Unfortunately, by February 2018, the future of Danger and Eggs was uncertain. As Petosky put it at the time, she felt that the show was in limbo, with the loss of the crew, without \\"much concern or enthusiasm\\" about the show, saying it \\"it just slipped through the cracks.\\" She lamented that the show's fate is up the new executive team on the show and predicted the show would probably be cancelled as a result. LGBT representation on CBBC On 5 January 2013, The Dumping Ground aired an episode that centered around a child, Gus Carmichael (Noah Marullo), being adopted by a same-sex couple. In the episode, it was debated whether or not the couple should be allowed to foster Gus. After the debate, the same-sex couple were able to adopt Gus. In 2013, creator of The Sarah Jane Adventures, Russell T. Davies, expressed his desire to implement a coming out scene for Luke Smith (Tommy Knight) if the series had continued past the fifth series. A boyfriend for the character, Sanjay, was written but never seen in the series. The idea was suggested by the CBBC network itself, but due to the death of cast member Elisabeth Sladen, the series ended prematurely. In June 2020, Jamie Johnson character Dillon Simmonds (Patrick Ward) came out as gay, having previously been displayed as heterosexual. The storyline was highlighted for being introduced during pride month. On the storyline, CBBC stated: \\"Coming out isn't always easy, but by being a supportive ally we can hopefully create a safe space for the people we care about to be themselves\\". In July 2020, CBBC aired an episode of The Next Step featuring two teenage girls kissing. Prior to the scene, characters Cleo (Dani Verayo) and Jude (Molly Saunders) were written to confess their feelings for each other, and begin a relationship together. The scene made history as the first same-sex kiss to be aired on the channel. Amidst both praise and criticism, the BBC defend the scene by stating: \\"CBBC is proud to reflect all areas of children's lives, including age appropriate representation of same sex relationships\\". Eloise Stonborough of LGBT charity Stonewall described the scenes as \\"an exciting moment for LGBT representation\\", and praised the series and CBBC for improving \\"understanding of what it means to be lesbian\\" for young viewers of The Next Step. The moment generated over 100 complaints, to which the BBC defended it, saying: \\"We believe that the storyline, and the kiss, was handled with sensitivity and without sensationalism, following as it did the portrayal of Jude and Cleo's developing relationship and I am afraid we do not agree that it was inappropriate for the audience age\\". In August 2020, CBBC transmitted an episode of Mystic where character Caleb Burford (Joshua Tan) comes out as gay to Issie Brown (Macey Chipping). The scene was described as \\"groundbreaking\\" by Digital Spy.  Independent LGBT children's media  In September 2007 Dottie's Magic Pockets became the first available show for children in gay and lesbian families.American Public Media's Marketplace 2007  International LGBT children's media  Rodney Guy, a sketch on the Japanese children's series Ugo Ugo Ruga created by Rodney Greenblat, creator of PaRappa the Rapper featured gay marriages between multiple characters: Wonder Gal and Officer Gal; and Sport Guy and Handy Guy. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZES8l43Qmlw References Citations Sources LGBT portrayals in mass media Children's television ","title":"LGBT children's television programming"},{"id":"14461151","text":"Elisha Abas (; born 1971) is an Israeli pianist, composer, and former professional soccer player. Elisha Abas was the lifelong student of Pnina Salzman, (herself a student of Alfred Cortot) and mentee of Arthur Rubinstein. La Roma, National Italian Newspaper, commented on a performance in Naples, Italy saying, \\"he is the most refined and interesting pianists of our generation ‚Ä¶ his \\"playing is the perfect marriage of exuberant musicality restrained with the right dose of rationalism that is rich with colors and shades. His palette shines in all his splendor with a captivating performance of Chopin and Schumann\\".  Life and career  Abas was born into a musical family. He is the great-great-grandsonTalking with pianist Elisha Abas of Russian composer, Alexander Scriabin (1872-1915), via Ariadna Scriabina (1905 ‚Äì 22 July 1944), Gilbert-Elizabeth \\"Betty\\" Knut-Lazarus (1926 - 1964), and his mother Ariane Abas (1950 - ). His father is the Israeli children's author Shlomo Abas (1948 - ). Abas was a child prodigy who started performing at the age of six and has since shared the stage with Isaac Stern, Leonard Bernstein and Zubin Mehta. Abas achieved many accolades throughout his career. Those most notable were achieved when he was a young prodigy ‚Äì winning first place in the America Israel Cultural Foundation music competition for eight consecutive years and first place in the Claremont Piano Competition. At age 14, he felt \\"burned out\\" as a musician, and retired from the field. He began pursuing a career as a professional soccer player. He played left back for several Israeli teams, first in Hapoel Petah Tikva under coach Avram Grant, then for Hapoel Kfar Saba and several other teams. As a result of an injury, he retired as a soccer player at the age of 28. After retiring from soccer, Abas decided to try and return to playing piano. He contacted Salzman, and began performing again. Today he continues to perform throughout the world, most recently in North America, Europe, Cuba, Russia, Israel, and China. Elisha Abas is also a composer. He rarely performs his original compositions in public; however, in 2009, Elisha performed his original music in St. Petersburg's Smonlny Cathedral, United Nations Assembly Hall, and in Teatro Amadeo Rold√°n in Havana, Cuba. In December 2009, Elisha Abas performed and recorded live the Brahms First Piano Concerto in Havana, Cuba with The National Symphony Orchestra of Cuba conducted by Yoel Gamzou.

From the Liber feudorum maior. Arnau Mir de Tost or Arnaldus Mironis, or Arnal Mir√≥n (c. 1000 ‚Äì after 1072) was a Catalan nobleman of Urgell, the lord of Llord√† and viscount of √Äger, a major figure in the eleventh-century Reconquista in Catalonia. Arnau is sometimes praised as the \\"El Cid of the Lands of Lleida\\" for his foundational role in reestablishing Christian rule in the region to the south of Urgell.Fern√°ndez, 83. Arnau was born at Tost shortly after the year 1000. His father died when he was still young and he became attached to the court of Count Ermengol II.Fern√°ndez, 80. In 1031 he married Arsenda (or Ersenda) and purchased from the count the rights to the castle of Llord√† on the frontier with the Caliphate of C√≥rdoba. From his base at Llord√† he began a career of conquest in the aftermath of the breakup of the caliphate in numerous petty ·π≠awƒÅ'if. He conquered the Conca Dell√† and brought the frontier of Urgell up to the mountainous region of Montsec. His crowning achievement was to seize the mighty qa·π£abah () of Ajƒ´ra (√Äger) in 1034, the key fortress in the Andalusi line of defence (the Tagr) against Urgell, which he successfully took by storm twice. Ermengol promptly enfeoffed Arnau as lord of √Äger and charged him with the repopulation of the devastated territory between the Christian and Muslim frontiers.Fern√°ndez, 81. To this end Arnau issued charters specifying the terms of colonisation; Montsec became the centre of a new Christian principality in the south of Urgell. For his primitive chancery Arnau employed an efficient scribe named Vidal, who brought the convenientia (convention) into common practice in western Catalonia, especially through the work he did drawing up conventions on behalf of Raymond IV of Pallars Juss√†, the husband of Arnau's daughter Valen√ßa.Kosto, 166. Arnau had extended his influence into Pallars Juss√† through this matrimonial alliance (1055), at which time Raymond had pledged him four castles as insurance against his breaking his marriage vows.Kosto, 125. thumbleftThe castle-monastery of Saint Peter, founded in the mid-11th century by Arnau near √Äger. Arnau controlled over thirty castles and numerous other agricultural settlements at the height of his power, justifying his assumption of the titles of viscount and comtor.Kosto, 131. He built a fortified monastery, Sant Pere d'√Äger, which still stands on a hill overlooking √Äger.Calvo. In 1043-1044 Arnau became a hostage on behalf of his suzerain Ermengol III for 4,000 solidi to Raymond Berengar I of Barcelona, as insurance against Ermengol and Raymond Berengar's alliance against Raymond of Cerdanya.Kosto, 129. Arnau also fought for Raymond Berengar, conquering Camarasa and Cubells in his name.Fern√°ndez, 82. As early as 1050 he had extracted from Raymond Berengar a promise not to demand statica (right of lodging) from him.Kosto, 94 and 98. At the same time he was extracting other concessions out of Ermengol III, diminishing the comital rights (potestas, \\"power\\") over his castles. Arnau was a major proponent of the Crusade of Barbastro in 1064. On 17 April 1066 Ermengol III, who had been given the lordship of Barbastro after the success of the crusade, died defending it from the Muslims and Arnau took over the regency of Urgell for the young Ermengol IV. In 1072 Arnau went on a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. Upon his return he dictated his testament, which is preserved. It contains the second mention of a set of ninety-six rock crystal chess pieces called the \\"Urgell (or √Äger) chessmen\\". Their earliest mention is in the 1068 will of Arnau's wife Arsenda. They are crafted in an abstract Islamic design, implying that they were originally from south of the frontier. On his deathbed he is said to have expressed regret that he had not enough time to conquer Balaguer and Lleida. A small monument has been erected to Arnau at Foradada near Montson√≠s.Fern√°ndez, 84.

Before that, prostitution was unlegislated but it was not illegal, since the constitution allows any activity that is not forbidden by law. Prostitution is currently not a subject of debate. UNAIDS estimate there to be 8,195 prostitutes in Uruguay.  Regulation  Uruguay's Law no. 17.515 of 2002 - Trabajo Sexual Se Dictan Norma (Sexual Work Standards Are Dictated) - explicitly states sex work is legal and provides regulations that must be adhered to. It also obliges the government to advise sex workers of their rights and duties, support them against exploitation and provide sexual health information. The law set up a confidential National Registry of Sex Workers. Sex works must enrol on the National Registry, this demands an initial and periodical health checks focus in the prevention, detection and treatments of sexually transmitted diseases. The register gives the worker a license which is necessary to work in brothels. Article 31 of the law provides penalties for selling sex without a health card, and their names are placed on the register. Local authorities may, in consultation with sex workers, set up local sex work areas. These must not be near educational establishments and be sensitive to local opinions. The local authority may also set working hours and dictate dress code and behaviour. Brothels and commercial sex bars are permitted provided they have the agreement of local police and are licensed. Sex may not be sold in massage establishments. The law established a \\"National Honorary Commission for the Protection of Sex Work\\", and two sex workers sit on the commission. In 1995, the Banco de Previsi√≥n Social (state-owned Uruguayan social security institute) recognised sex work by women. In 2009 a law was passed that recognised men and trans women in sex work. The prostitution of a minor (person under the legal age of consent) is prohibited and the authorities have the obligation of protect them from sexual exploitation and prostitution. Despite this, many sex workers work on the streets or independently and not always have health checks.  Practicing  Prostitution must be performed in brothels (in Uruguay they have many euphemistic names like ‚Äúwhiskerias‚Äù or ‚Äúcasas de masajes‚Äù). Usually brothels use a red light as distinctive, or have discrete announcements with the name of the establishment and a suggestive phrase to attract clients. In order to open, a brothel must have the authorization of the municipal government and the state police and follow certain rules dictated by the Ministry of Public Health. Police and municipal government are in charge of determining in which areas brothels may exist considering the characteristics of the place. However brothels may not function near schools or high schools. Minors are not allowed to enter brothels, in addition to performing any kind of activity inside. As any commercial establishment brothels pay taxes and have social security obligations. Violation to the sex work law is punishable with fines. Pimping, commercial sexual exploitation of adults and minors is illegal and severely punished. The government often lunches campaigns to persuade tourists and residents of not hiring or promoting minors prostitution. There is a presence of Dominican prostitutes in Uruguay who took advantage of a formerly liberal immigration policy.  Organizations  The aforementioned sex labour law created the Comisi√≥n Nacional Honoraria de Protecci√≥n al Trabajo Sexual (National Honorary Commission for Protection of Sexual Work) within the Ministry of Public Health, whose aim is to advise Executive Branch on this matter, watch over the fulfillment of the law, provide counseling to sex workers and promote sexual education courses and campaigns on the matter. There was a trade union named Asociaci√≥n de Meretrices Profesionales del Uruguay, created in 1986, which comprised about 1200 women sex workers affiliates and whose purpose was the cooperation between sex workers, the defense of their rights, carrying out workshops and promote the prevention of STDs and HIV. Even received support from the UNFPA. However it was dissolved in early 2015 under accusations of corruption of its president and vicepresident, including misappropriation of donated lands intended for HIV- infected women and donated goods for beneficiaries. Sex trafficking Uruguay is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Uruguayan women and girls‚Äîand to a more limited extent transgender adults and male adolescents‚Äîare subjected to sex trafficking within the country. Uruguayan women and LGBTI individuals are forced into prostitution in Spain, Italy, Argentina, and Brazil; however, the number of identified Uruguayan victims exploited abroad has decreased in recent years. Women from the Dominican Republic, and to a lesser extent from South American countries, are subjected to sex trafficking in Uruguay. Uruguayan officials have identified citizens of other countries, including China and the Dominican Republic, transiting Uruguay en route to other destinations, particularly Argentina, as potential victims of sex trafficking. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Uruguay as a 'Tier 2' country.

Jay played his high school football in Torrington, Wyoming, excelling in all sports winning Honorable Mention High School Football All-America in 1969. He began his college football career playing for the short-lived program of Hiram Scott College in Scottsbluff, Nebraska. The Scotties did not have a losing season during their brief existence (1966‚Äì71), but the program was shut down after the 1971 season when the school went bankrupt. Jay was the Scotties' starting quarterback during Hiram Scott's final season and led the team to a 6-2-1 record (including a win against Boise State) running an offense patterned after Oklahoma's. Following the season, the Scotties were selected to play in the Mineral Bowl, but were unable to accept the invitation. Wayne State University, a team that Hiram Scott had beaten that season, played in their place. Hiram Scott coach Dick Beechner called Jay one of the best players to ever play for Hiram Scott and said, \\"He was a good option quarterback and when he stepped into the huddle we knew the play he called probably going to be successful. He had that leadership ability.\\" After the Hiram Scott program was shut down, Jay found his way into the United States Marine Corps, where he played quarterback for the 1972 Quantico Marines, an All-Marine Football program designed to showcase the USMC for recruiting. The team was eliminated following that season in the wake of defense budget cuts, as the Vietnam War waned. Jay was recruited heavily in 1973, as he still had three remaining years of collegiate eligibility. In order to pursue his dreams to be a veterinarian, Jay transferred to Texas A&M.; He led the team in passing his sophomore season with 682 yards while running Emory Bellard's wishbone offense and sharing starting duties with 17-year-old freshman phenom David Walker. He lost the starting job to Walker the following season only to regain it once again his senior year. He was the starting quarterback for the Aggies during his senior season in 1975 and led them to a season high national ranking of No. 2 (in the 12/1/75 AP poll), a 10-game winning streak including a 20-10 win against the rival No. 5 ranked Texas Longhorns, a Southwest Conference championship and a Liberty Bowl appearance against USC in Trojan coach John McKay's last game. After the season, Jay was voted by his teammates as the winner of the Aggie Heart Award. The Aggie Heart Award is presented to a senior who has completed his eligibility and displayed intangibles such as effort, desire, determination, competitiveness, leadership and courage. The Heart Award is voted on by the entire Aggie football team and is considered the highest award that a senior athlete can receive at Texas A&M.; At last look, Jay still held a little-known record from per play yards from scrimmage of more than 10+, the only aggie in history to average double digit yards every time he touched the ball. After football, Jay became a successful entrepreneur, business consultant, and author. He has two daughters Mary Alexis Jay and Skye Kathleen Jay.

Cynthia Watros is the actress most closely identified with the role; she played Annie from November 29, 1994, until February 23, 1998. The role was later recast, after Watros left for other career ventures, with Signy Coleman, who portrayed Annie from July 30, 1998, until July 20, 1999. Coleman also briefly reprised the role from January 14 to 21, 2003. Annie is often considered one of Guiding Light's greatest villains and one of its more exciting characters. Annie has also been the main rival to Guiding Light heroine Reva Shayne. The two have long fought over the affections of Reva's then-husband, Josh Lewis. Watros won a Daytime Emmy in 1998 for Lead Actress in a Drama Series. Character's background Annie Dutton came to Springfield from Chicago in November 1994 and began working as a nurse on staff at Cedars Hospital in Springfield. In January 1995, she began treating Joshua Lewis, who had broken his leg in the 5th Street fire, and the pair quickly fell in love. However, Annie had a secret: she was married to Rick Bauer. The marriage fell apart, however, because of Annie's alcoholism and her affair with a married man. Annie hid the secret from Josh and the two became engaged, but not long after, Annie told Josh her secrets. After initial resentment, Josh forgave Annie and the two married. Soon after, though, In April 1995, Josh's thought- to-be-dead wife, Reva Shayne was found to be alive and well, but Josh remained committed to Annie. The pair married legally and Reva married Buzz Cooper, because Josh's children wanted him to stay with Annie. Annie knew that Josh was still in love with his ex-wife Reva and it infuriated her. Annie started drinking again and became addicted to painkillers. With Josh's help Annie entered rehab to get off the pills, which she did. She then began working as Alan Spaulding's physical therapist, who Alan grew to like, but Annie was still in love with Josh and was determined to keep him. She was so determined that she was artificially inseminated, but after a while Annie miscarried. Annie though had a plan, she picked a fight with Reva at the top of the stairs at the Spaulding mansion and made it look like Reva pushed her down the stairs and thus caused her to miscarry. Reva was then charged with murder, but during Reva's trial it was revealed by Annie's doctor that she was artificially inseminated and had miscarried the child before she had fallen down the stairs. With Josh out of the picture Annie moved on with Alan, the two planned to marry, but Reva learned Annie was married to another man, Eddie Banks, from her days in Chicago. Eddie helped Annie steal drugs from the hospital where they worked when she lied to him about needing drugs to pay for her mother's operation. When they got caught, Annie faked her own death so Eddie would take the rap for the drug charge. He went to jail mourning the loss of his beloved Annie, but when he found out from Reva that she was still alive, he signed an affidavit stating the truth about Annie and their still-legal marriage. Just as Annie and Alan were about to marry Eddie entered and told everyone the truth, they were still married. Alan broke it off with Annie and she was then carted off to jail. Annie would escape but was soon thought to be dead by everyone after trying to kill Reva. Annie was not dead after all and after a few months she returned to Springfield as Det. Teri DeMarco, to investigate a case there. Annie had plastic surgery to look like the real Teri, who was in a coma. Annie, as Teri, began drugging Josh, in hopes of getting him back. Reva meanwhile grew more suspicious about \\"Teri\\" and soon learned Teri was actually Annie Dutton. Annie after trying to kidnap Lizzie Spaulding fled town. In 2003, Annie was found to be living in a mental institution believing that she was married to Josh and still hating Reva.

Its most explored and useful property is photoluminescence, which can be easily detected from an individual N-V center, especially those in the negative charge state (N-V‚àí). Electron spins at N-V centers, localized at atomic scales, can be manipulated at room temperature by applying a magnetic field, electric field, microwave radiation or light, or a combination, resulting in sharp resonances in the intensity and wavelength of the photoluminescence. These resonances can be explained in terms of electron spin related phenomena such as quantum entanglement, spin-orbit interaction and Rabi oscillations, and analysed using advanced quantum optics theory. An individual N-V center can be viewed as a basic unit of a quantum computer, and it has potential applications in novel, more efficient fields of electronics and computational science including quantum cryptography, spintronics, and masers. Simplified atomic structure of the N-V‚àí center Structure The nitrogen-vacancy center is a point defect in the diamond lattice. It consists of a nearest-neighbor pair of a nitrogen atom, which substitutes for a carbon atom, and a lattice vacancy. Bottom images are spatial photoluminescence (PL) maps before and after application of +20 V voltage to a planar Schottky diode. The top image outlines the experiment. The PL maps reveal the conversion of individual N-V0 centers into N-V‚àí centers that appear as bright dots. Two charge states of this defect, neutral N-V0 and negative N-V‚àí, are known from spectroscopic studies using optical absorption, photoluminescence (PL), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR), which can be viewed as a hybrid of PL and EPR; most details of the structure originate from EPR. A nitrogen atom has five valence electrons. Three of them covalently bond to the carbon atoms and two remain non-bonded and are called a lone pair. The vacancy has three unpaired electrons. Two of them make a quasi covalent bond and one remains unpaired. The overall symmetry, however, is axial (trigonal C3V); one can visualize this by imagining the three unpaired vacancy electrons continuously exchanging their roles. The N-V0 thus has one unpaired electron and is paramagnetic. However, despite extensive efforts, electron paramagnetic resonance signals from N-V0 avoided detection for decades until 2008. Optical excitation is required to bring the N-V0 defect into the EPR-detectable excited state; the signals from the ground state are presumably too broad for EPR detection. The N-V0 centers can be converted into N-V‚àí by changing the Fermi level position. This can be achieved by applying external voltage to a p-n junction made from doped diamond, e.g., in a Schottky diode. In the negative charge state N-V‚àí, an extra electron is located at the vacancy site forming a spin S=1 pair with one of the vacancy electrons. As in N-V0, the vacancy electrons are \\"exchanging roles\\" preserving the overall trigonal symmetry. This N-V‚àí state is what is commonly, and somewhat incorrectly, called \\"the nitrogen-vacancy center\\". The neutral state has not yet been explored for spin manipulations. The N-V centers are randomly oriented within a diamond crystal. Ion implantation techniques can enable their artificial creation in predetermined positions. Production Nitrogen-vacancy centers are typically produced from single substitutional nitrogen centers (called C or P1 centers in diamond literature) by irradiation followed by annealing at temperatures above 700 ¬∞C. A wide range of high-energy particles are suitable for such irradiation, including electrons, protons, neutrons, ions, and gamma photons. Irradiation produces lattice vacancies, which are a part of N-V centers. Those vacancies are immobile at room temperature, and annealing is required to move them. Single substitutional nitrogen produces strain in the diamond lattice; it therefore efficiently captures moving vacancies, producing the N-V centers. During chemical vapor deposition of diamond, a small fraction of single substitutional nitrogen impurity (typically <0.5%) traps vacancies generated as a result of the plasma synthesis. Such nitrogen-vacancy centers are preferentially aligned to the growth direction. Diamond is notorious for having a relatively large lattice strain. Strain splits and shifts optical transitions from individual centers resulting in broad lines in the ensembles of centers. Special care is taken to produce extremely sharp N-V lines (line width ~10 MHz) required for most experiments: high-quality, pure natural or better synthetic diamonds (type IIa) are selected. Many of them already have sufficient concentrations of grown-in N-V centers and are suitable for applications. If not, they are irradiated by high-energy particles and annealed. Selection of a certain irradiation dose allows tuning the concentration of produced N-V centers such that individual N-V centers are separated by micrometre-large distances. Then, individual N-V centers can be studied with standard optical microscopes or, better, near-field scanning optical microscopes having sub-micrometre resolution. Basic optical properties Optical absorption and emission of the N-V‚àí center at room temperature. N-V‚àí centers emit bright red light which can be conveniently excited by visible light sources, such as argon or krypton lasers, frequency doubled Nd:YAG lasers, dye lasers, or He-Ne lasers. Excitation can also be achieved at energies below that of zero phonon emission. Laser illumination, however, also converts some N-V‚àí into N-V0 centers. Emission is very quick (relaxation time ~10 ns). At room temperature, no sharp peaks are observed because of the thermal broadening. However, cooling the N-V‚àí centers with liquid nitrogen or liquid helium dramatically narrows the lines down to a width of a few megahertz. An important property of the luminescence from individual N-V‚àí centers is its high temporal stability. Whereas many single- molecular emitters bleach after emission of 106‚Äì108 photons, no bleaching is observed for the N-V centers at room temperature. Because of these properties, the ideal technique to address the N-V centers is confocal microscopy, both at room temperature and at low temperature. In particular, low temperature operation is required to specifically address only the zero-phonon line (ZPL). Energy level structure and its manipulation by external fields thumbupright=1.1Schematic energy level structure of the N-V‚àí center. Electron transitions between the ground 3A and excited 3E states, separated by 1.945 eV (637 nm), produce absorption and luminescence. The 3A state is split by 1027 gauss (~12 ¬µeV) and the 3E state by 508 gauss (~5.9 ¬µeV). Numbers 0, ¬±1 indicate spin value; splitting due to the orbital degeneracy is not shown. The energy level structure of the N-V‚àí center was established by combining optical, electron paramagnetic resonance and theoretical results, as shown in the figure. In particular, several theoretical works have been done, using the Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals (LCAO) approach, to build the electronic orbitals to describe the possible quantum states, looking at the N-V center as a molecule. Moreover, group theory results are used, to take into account the symmetry of the diamond crystal, and so the symmetry of the N-V itself. The energy levels are labeled according to the group theory, and in particular are labelled after the irreducible representations of the C3V symmetry group of the defect center, A1, A2 and E. The numbers 3 in 3A and 1 in 1A represent the number of allowable ms spin states, or the spin multiplicity, which range from ‚ÄìS to S for a total of 2S+1 possible states. If S = 1, ms can be ‚àí1, 0, or 1. The 1A level is predicted by theory but not directly observed in the experiment, and it is believed to play an important role in the quenching of photoluminescence. In the absence of an external magnetic field, the ground and excited states are split by the magnetic interaction between the two unpaired electrons at the N-V‚àí center (see microscopic model): when two electrons have parallel spins (ms=¬±1), their energy is higher than when spins are antiparallel (ms=0). The farther apart the electrons are, the weaker their interaction energy D (roughly D ~1/r3). Thus the smaller splitting in the excited state can be viewed in terms of larger electron-electron separation in the excited state. When an external magnetic field is applied to the N-V‚àí center, it does not affect the ms=0 states nor the 1A state (because it has S = 0), but it splits the ms = ¬±1 levels. If a magnetic field is oriented along the defect axis and reaches about 1027 G (or 508 G) then the ms = ‚Äì1 and ms = 0 states in the ground (or excited) state become equal in energy; they strongly interact resulting in so-called spin polarization, which strongly affects the intensity of optical absorption and luminescence transitions involving those states. This happens because transitions between electronic states are mediated by a photon which cannot change overall spin. Thus optical transitions must preserve the total spin and occur between levels of the same total spin. For this reason, transitions 3E‚Üî1A and 1A ‚Üî 3A are non-radiative and quench the luminescence. Whereas ms = ‚àí1 (excited state) ‚Üî ms = 0 (ground state) transition was forbidden in the absence of an external magnetic field, it becomes allowed when a magnetic field mixes the ms = ‚àí1 and ms = 0 levels in the ground state. As a measurable outcome of this phenomenon, luminescence intensity can be strongly modulated by magnetic field. An important property of the non-radiative transition between 3E and 1A is that it is stronger for ms = ¬±1 and weaker for ms = 0. This property results in a very useful manipulation of N-V center, which is called optical spin-polarization. First, consider an off-resonance excitation which has a higher frequency (typically 2.32 eV (532 nm)) than the frequencies of all transitions and thus lays in the vibronic bands for all transitions. By using a pulse of this wavelength, people can excite all spin states and create phonons as well. For a spin state with ms = 0, due to conservation of spin in transition, it will be excited to the corresponding ms = 0 state in 3E and then go back to the original state. However, for a spin state with ms = ¬±1 in 3A, after the excitation, it has a relatively high probability to jump to the intermediate state 1A by non- radiative transition and go to the ground state with ms = 0. After sufficient cycles, the state of the N-V center can be regarded as in the ms = 0 state. Such a process can be used in the initialization of quantum state in quantum information processing. There is an additional level splitting in the excited 3E state due to the orbital degeneracy and spin-orbit interaction. Importantly, this splitting can be modulated by applying a static electric field, in a similar fashion to the magnetic field mechanism outlined above, though the physics of the splitting is somewhat more complex. Nevertheless, an important practical outcome is that the intensity and position of the luminescence lines can be modulated by applying electric or/and magnetic fields. The energy difference between the ms = 0 and ms = ¬±1 states corresponds to the microwave region. Thus by irradiating the N-V centers with microwave radiation, one can change the relative population of those levels, thereby again modulating the luminescence intensity. There is an additional splitting of the ms = ¬±1 energy levels, which originates from the \\"hyperfine\\" interaction between the nuclear and electron spins. Thus finally, the optical absorption and luminescence from the N-V‚àí center consists of roughly a dozen sharp lines with a separation in the MHz-GHz range, and all those lines can be resolved, given proper sample preparation. The intensity and position of those lines can be modulated using the following tools: # Amplitude and orientation of magnetic field, which splits the ms = ¬±1 levels in the ground and excited states. # Amplitude and orientation of elastic field (strain), which can be applied by, e.g., squeezing the diamond. Similar effects can be induced by applying an electric field, and the electric field can be controlled with much higher precision. # Continuous-wave microwave radiation, which changes the population of the sublevels within the ground and excited state. # Tunable laser, which can selectively excite certain sublevels of the ground and excited state. # In addition to those static perturbations, numerous dynamic effects (spin echo, Rabi oscillations, etc.) can be exploited by applying a carefully designed sequence of microwave pulses. The first pulse coherently excites the electron spins, and this coherence is then manipulated and probed by the subsequent pulses. Those dynamic effects are rather important for the practical realization of quantum computers, which ought to work at high frequency. The above-described energy structure is by no means exceptional for a defect in diamond or other semiconductor. It was not this structure alone, but a combination of several favorable factors (previous knowledge, easy production and excitation, etc.) which suggested the use of the N-V‚àí center.  Spin dynamics  Spin dynamics in the N-V‚Äì center on diamond. The primary transition between triplet ground and excited states is predominantly spin conserving. Decay via the intermediate singlets gives rise to spin polarization by preferentially switching spin from ms = ¬±1 to ms = 0. Both absorption and emission wavelengths are indicated, since they differ due to Stokes shift. (Correction: The wavelength of the 1E-1A transition should be 1042 nm. ) Thinking of the N-V‚àí center as a multielectronic system, we can draw the diagram in the figure at the left, where the states are labeled according to their symmetry and with a left superscript that indicates with a 3 if it is a triplet (S=1) and with a 1 if it is a singlet (S=0). It is well accepted today that we have two triplet states and two intermediate singlet states. The optical excitations conserve the spin state, but there is a high probability of the states \\\\left^3\\\\text{E},\\\\pm1\\\\right\\\\rangle decaying non- radiatively to the singlet state \\\\left^1\\\\text{A}_1\\\\right\\\\rangle, a phenomenon called intersystem crossing (ISC). This happens at an appreciable rate because the energy curve in function of the position of the atoms for the \\\\left^3\\\\text{E},\\\\pm1\\\\right\\\\rangle state intersects the curve for the \\\\left^1\\\\text{A}_1\\\\right\\\\rangle state. Therefore, for some instant during the vibrational relaxation that the ions undergo after the excitement, it is possible for the spin to flip with little or no energy required in the transition. It is important to note that this mechanism also leads to a transition from \\\\left^3\\\\text{E},0\\\\right\\\\rangle to \\\\left^1\\\\text{A}_1\\\\right\\\\rangle, but the rate of this ISC is much lower than the \\\\left^3\\\\text{E},\\\\pm1\\\\right\\\\rangle states rate, therefore this transition is indicated with a thin line. The diagram also shows the non-radiative and infrared competing decay paths between the two singlet states, and the fine splitting in the triplet states, whose differences in energy correspond to microwave frequencies. Some authors explain the dynamics of the N-V‚àí center by admitting that the transition from \\\\left^1\\\\text{E}\\\\right\\\\rangle to \\\\left^3\\\\text{A}_2,\\\\pm1\\\\right\\\\rangle is small, but as Robledo et al. shows, only the fact that the probability of decaying to \\\\left^1\\\\text{A}_1\\\\right\\\\rangle is smaller for \\\\left^3\\\\text{E},0\\\\right\\\\rangle than for \\\\left^3\\\\text{E},\\\\pm1\\\\right\\\\rangle is enough to polarize the spin to ms = 0. Potential applications Scanning thermal microscopy using the N-V center. (a) Schematics of experimental setup. An electric current is applied to the arms of an AFM cantilever (phosphorus-doped Si, P:Si) and heats up the end section above the tip (intrinsic Si, i-Si). The bottom lens excites a diamond nanocrystal with a green laser light and collects photoluminescence (PL). The crystal hosts an N-V center and is attached to the AFM tip. A wire on the sample surface serves as the microwave source (mw). The temperature of the cantilever Th is determined from the applied current and voltage. (b) ODMR spectra of the N-V center at three temperatures. The line splitting originates from a ‚àº1 mT applied magnetic field. (c) Thermal conductivity image of a gold letter E on sapphire. White circles indicate features that do not correlate with the AFM topography. (d) PL image of the AFM cantilever end and tip where the diamond nanocrystal appears as the bright spot. (e) Zoomed PL image of the N-V center in d. The spectral shape and intensity of the optical signals from the N-V‚àí centers are sensitive to external perturbation, such as temperature, strain, electric and magnetic field. However, the use of spectral shape for sensing those perturbation is impractical, as the diamond would have to be cooled to cryogenic temperatures to sharpen the N-V‚àí signals. A more realistic approach is to use luminescence intensity (rather than lineshape), which exhibits a sharp resonance when a microwave frequency is applied to diamond that matches the splitting of the ground state levels. The resulting optically detected magnetic resonance signals are sharp even at room temperature, and can be used in miniature sensors. Such sensors can detect magnetic fields of a few nanotesla or electric fields of about 10 V/cm at kilohertz frequencies after 100 seconds of averaging. This sensitivity allows detecting a magnetic or electric field produced by a single electron located tens of nanometers away from an N-V‚àí center. Using the same mechanism, the N-V‚àí centers were employed in scanning thermal microscopy to measure high-resolution spatial maps of temperature and thermal conductivity (see image). Another possible use of the N-V‚àí centers is as a detector to measure the full mechanical stress tensor in the bulk of the crystal. For this application, the stress-induced splitting of the zero- phonon-line is exploited, and its polarization properties. A robust frequency- modulated radio receiver using the electron-spin-dependent photoluminescence that operated up to 350 ¬∞C demonstrates the possibility for use in extreme conditions. In addition to the quantum optical applications, luminescence from the N-V‚àí centers can be applied for imaging biological processes, such as fluid flow in living cells. This application relies on good compatibility of diamond nano-particles with the living cells and on favorable properties of photoluminescence from the N-V‚àí centers (strong intensity, easy excitation and detection, temporal stability, etc.). Compared with large single-crystal diamonds, nanodiamonds are cheap (about 1 USD per gram) and available from various suppliers. N-V‚àí centers are produced in diamond powders with sub- micrometre particle size using the standard process of irradiation and annealing described above. Due to the relatively small size of nanodiamond, NV centers can be produced by irradiating nanodiamond of 100nm or less with medium energy H+ beam. This method reduces the required ion dose and reaction, making it possible to mass produce fluorescent nanodiamonds in ordinary laboratory. Fluorescent nanodiamond produced with such method is bright and photostable, making it excellent for long-term, three dimensional tracking of single particle in living cell. Those nanodiamonds are introduced in a cell, and their luminescence is monitored using a standard fluorescence microscope. Further N-V‚àí center has been hypothesized to be a potential bio-mimetic system for emulating radical pair spin dynamics of the avian compass.Cryptochrome and Magnetic Sensing, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Stimulated emission from the N-V‚àí center has been demonstrated, though it could be achieved only from the phonon side-band (i.e. broadband light) and not from the ZPL. For this purpose, the center has to be excited at a wavelength longer than ~650 nm, as higher-energy excitation ionizes the center. The first continuous-wave room-temperature maser has been demonstrated. It used 532-nm pumped N-V‚àí centers held within a high Purcell factor microwave cavity and an external magnetic field of 4300 G. Continuous maser oscillation generated a coherent signal at ~9.2 GHz. The N-V center can have a very long spin coherence time approaching the second regime. This is advantageous for applications in quantum sensing and quantum communication. Disadvantageous for these applications is the long radiative lifetime (~12 ns ) of the N-V center and the strong phonon sideband in its emission spectrum. Both issues can be addressed by putting the N-V center in an optical cavity. Historical remarks The microscopic model and most optical properties of ensembles of the N-V‚àí centers have been firmly established in the 1970s based on the optical measurements combined with uniaxial stress and on the electron paramagnetic resonance. However, a minor error in EPR results (it was assumed that illumination is required to observe N-V‚àí EPR signals) resulted in the incorrect multiplicity assignments in the energy level structure. In 1991 it was shown that EPR can be observed without illumination, which established the energy level scheme shown above. The magnetic splitting in the excited state has been measured only recently. The characterization of single N-V‚àí centers has become a very competitive field nowadays, with many dozens of papers published in the most prestigious scientific journals. One of the first results was reported back in 1997. In that paper, it was demonstrated that the fluorescence of single N-V‚àí centers can be detected by room-temperature fluorescence microscopy and that the defect shows perfect photostability. Also one of the outstanding properties of the N-V center was demonstrated, namely room-temperature optically detected magnetic resonance.

In the game, players control one of four dinosaurs chased by the titular cavemen. Its gameplay includes elements of Pac-Man--collect all items in a maze, eat a special item to turn the tables on pursuers--but supports up to four players at once. Initially envisioned as a hybrid puzzle/strategy project, its original concept was later reworked into a Pac-Man-like title after poor reception from testers and features claymation graphics, advertised as \\"Playmation\\" by Midway. Conversions for the Nintendo Entertainment System and MS-DOS were released by Acclaim Entertainment in 1990 and 1991 respectively, reducing the number of simultaneous players to two. Both the arcade and NES versions garnered positive reception from critics.  Gameplay  Arcade version screenshot. Trog is a maze game reminiscent of Pac-Man where players assume the role of Theropod-like dinosaurs (with Styracosaurus-like heads) Rex, Bloop, Spike and/or Gwen, through 49 islands set in the land of \\"Og\\", home to the one-eyed cavemen known as the \\"Trog\\".Trog Game Pak Instructions (Nintendo Entertainment System, US) Players must pick up all colored eggs lying around the map as the titular cavemen wander around, attempting to eat them. Unlike Pac-Man, the dinosaurs can attack at any time with a punch that does not require a power-up. Power-ups also randomly spawn to help finish the level; these include red flowers that increase the player's speed; ice cubes that freeze all on-screen Trogs; pineapples, which turn the character into a full-grown T-Rex that can temporarily eat Trogs (similar to Pac-Man's Power pellets, except the power-up occurs randomly); and a firebrand which bestows a temporary fire breathing ability on the dinos. The multiplayer mode consists of two to four dinos on the same screen competing to get all of his/her same- colored eggs first, and players can either attack or protect each other (though power-ups indiscriminately hurt anyone that's in the way regardless). Many stages feature no walls, so characters can travel off the edge of the grid-like islands and plunge into the sea if they're not careful. The Trogs themselves are subject to all hazards the player is; they can even be taken out by their own wheels, fire and pits to comic effect. Trogs can be one-hit punched, to the side of the head, as they approach the screen edge resulting in them falling into the sea, with bonus points rewarded to the player. There are three different levels of difficulty: Easy, Advanced and Expert (Although the Arcade operator can set the difficulty in the operator menu to make the game more difficult on easier levels, without the player's knowledge of the true global difficulty.). Advanced Mode rewards a 200,000 level bonus and Expert rewards a 400,000 level bonus. As the levels progress, the cavemen become smarter and invent new ways to capture the dinosaurs. They eventually create fire pits and wheels to burn and flatten, respectively, the character and springs to bounce themselves all over the screen. Catapults and transportation chambers in latter stages help evade these attacks, however these are also usable by the Trogs resulting in some tactical gameplay options.  Development and release  Revision 4.00 version screenshot. Trog was co-designed by George N. Petro and Jack E. Haeger, who later worked in other Midway releases such as Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Jack Haeger also created the artwork and \\"Playmation\\" graphics, in which character models were created with clay animation. George Petro and Kurt Mahan worked as programmers, with composer Chris Granner scoring the soundtrack and created the sound effects. Other members also collaborated in the project. The original concept, dubbed \\"Revision 4.00\\", was more of a puzzle/strategy game consisting of players controlling a hand which would lay bones to guide their corresponding dinosaur in the right path. However, this idea was heavily panned and ridiculed during testing, with one tester allegedly defacing one of the cabinets to add an \\"R\\" to the label of the bone button. Due to poor reception, Bally/Midway considered canceling the project altogether but was given a second chance for two reasons: The first one was because Haeger had already spent so much of the budget on the clay animation and the second reason was because one of the testers suggested turning it into a Pac-Man-like game. Trog was first released for arcades by Bally/Midway in North America on March 1990 and later in Europe by Williams on February 1991. In 1990, a faithful conversion of the game by Software Creations was released for MS-DOS computers by Acclaim Entertainment. However, the DOS version only supports two players instead of four, featuring Bloop and Rex as playable characters. On October 1991, the title was then ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System by Visual Concepts and first published by Acclaim in North America and later in Europe. The NES version has a number of key differences such as visuals and sound, two-player support with Bloop and Spike as playable characters instead of four, among other changes.  Reception and legacy  Mark Caswell of Zzap!64 gave the original arcade version of Trog an overall positive outlook. The Nintendo Entertainment System conversion was met with positive reception from critics. Trogs arcade cabinet makes a brief appearance in the 1991 film Terminator 2: Judgment Day.

The film stars Patrick Dempsey, Michelle Monaghan, and Sydney Pollack, in his final screen appearance prior to his death less than a month after the film's release. The plot follows a lifelong playboy who falls in love with his best friend, only to have her get engaged and ask him to be her maid of honor. It was released by Columbia Pictures in the United States on May 2, 2008. The film garnered negative reviews from critics who criticized the formulaic humor and script, but grossed $106.4 million worldwide against a $40 million budget making it a box office success. It was released on DVD on September 16, 2008. Plot On Halloween night, 1998, at Cornell University, Tom Bailey, Jr. (Patrick Dempsey), in costume as Bill Clinton, slips into bed with his pre-arranged date, Monica. It turns out to be the wrong woman, Monica's roommate Hannah (Michelle Monaghan), and Tom likes her because she is so honest and does not fling herself at him. Ten years later, Hannah and Tom are best friends. Tom is very wealthy because of his creation of the \\"coffee collar\\" and gets a dime every time it is used. Tom is with a different girl every week, while Hannah focuses on her career at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He is very content with his life, suspecting that Hannah is too. After Tom takes Hannah to his father's (Sydney Pollack) sixth wedding, Hannah tells Tom she must go to Scotland for work. While she's gone, Tom discovers that without her, being with another woman week after week is not very fulfilling. He realizes that he loves Hannah and decides to tell her his feelings when she gets back. Upon returning, Hannah surprisingly announces she is engaged to a wealthy Scot named Colin (Kevin McKidd). Hannah asks Tom to be her maid of honor for her wedding. After discussing it with his friends, Tom decides to be her maid of honor, only to spend time with her and try to convince her she does not even know Colin, as well as making her realize that he loves her and she should be marrying him. After arriving in Scotland at Eilean Donan Castle for the wedding, Tom realizes he is running out of time to stop Hannah. He meets all of Colin's family and must perform in a variant of the Highland Games, in which the groom must compete to prove himself worthy of his bride. Tom is also in the competition with Colin but loses in the last round. Tom takes Hannah out for a walk, hoping to tell her how he feels. The other bridesmaids interrupt for Hannah's bachelorette party. On her Hen Night, Hannah parades around a pub and sells her kisses for change. As she goes around, Hannah then kisses Tom. Though it just started as a peck on the cheek, it turns into a passionate kiss. That night, Hannah confronts Tom to ask about the kiss. When she gets to his room, her drunk cousin is there, trying to have sex with him. Hannah leaves and Tom runs after her. He knocks on her door, pleading for her to let him in. She refuses and asks about the kiss. He tells her he knew he, not Colin, was the one for her. She refuses to say that she thinks so too and instead tells Tom that she still expects to marry Colin the next day. Tom cannot go through with watching Hannah and Colin get married so he decides to go home. When questioned about his sudden departure shortly before the wedding is to take place, Hannah informs Colin that Tom is just afraid of losing her. On the way home, Tom realizes that he must stop the wedding and goes back on horseback. Just when the priest asks for objections, Tom is sent flying off his horse and through the chapel doors. Seeing her best friend on the floor, Hannah rushes to him. As he struggles to stand up, he tells her that he loves her more than anything and that she should marry him. They then share a kiss. Hannah tells Colin that she is very sorry and that he is the perfect guy, just not the perfect guy for her. Colin's aunt then tells Colin, in Scots, to \\"deck\\" Tom, which he does without hesitation. Hannah and Tom eventually get married. Melissa catches the bouquet and then links arms with Tom's dad, to which he says \\"Number 6?\\" and his lawyer says \\"7\\". Hannah and Tom go on their honeymoon. Tom turns on the light just to see if he has got the right girl and Hannah replies \\"You do\\". The two kiss and as Hannah turns off the light, Tom says \\"Oh, Monica\\" and Hannah replies \\"Oh, Bill.\\" Cast * Patrick Dempsey as Thomas \\"Tom\\" Bailey, Jr. * Michelle Monaghan as Hannah * Kevin McKidd as Colin McMurray * Kathleen Quinlan as Joan * Sydney Pollack as Thomas Bailey, Sr. * Chris Messina as Dennis * Kadeem Hardison as Felix * Richmond Arquette as Gary * Busy Philipps as Melissa * Whitney Cummings as Stephanie * Sarah Wright as Sexy blonde * Emily Nelson as Hilary * James Sikking as Reverend Foote *Christine Barger as Psychoblogger * Kevin Sussman as Tiny Shorts Guy * Beau Garrett as Gloria * Kelly Carlson as Christie Bailey * Valerie Edmond as Kelly * Hannah Gordon as Deirdre McMurray * Eoin McCarthy as Ewan * Clive Russell as Finlay * Mary Birdsong as Sharon * Murray McArthur as Driver in Scotland * Grant Thomson as Huge Scottish Football Player Rating Made of Honor was originally rated R for \\"some sex-related material\\", but was later rated PG-13 for \\"sexual content and language\\".

Made of Honor was released on September 16, 2008 on DVD. Critical response Made of Honor received negative reviews from critics. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 15%, based on 123 reviews, with an average rating of 4.01/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Sharp performances by Patrick Dempsey and Michelle Monaghan can't save this forgettable, formulaic chick flick from its comic failings.\\" On Metacritic, the film has an average score of 37 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club gave the film a \\"C\\" grade, giving credit to the performances of Pollack and Monaghan for being surprisingly good in a by-the-numbers romantic story alongside Dempsey displaying \\"plastic sincerity\\" in his role, saying \\"It's telling that he's followed by a string of sidekicks apparently created to make him less bland by comparison.\\" The New York Times Stephen Holden commended the punch-up of the script for adding \\"tart satirical flavors to a cotton-candy formula\\" and the screen presence of both Dempsey and Monaghan, highlighting the latter for giving \\"enough sweetness to satisfy the cotton-candy addicts.\\" Barbara Vancheri of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette praised the utilization of the \\"picturesque, romantic\\" Scotland setting and the cast's willingness to perform, despite devolving into slapstick comedy and tacking on a 1940s film ending. She concluded by explaining its release alongside Iron Man saying, \\"Made of Honor is made to order for women or couples looking for an alternative to the comic-book adaptation and for a romcom with such obvious and memorable film forebears, it's still breezy fun.\\" Elizabeth Weitzman from the New York Daily News gave credit to Dempsey for his comedic timing over material containing \\"snickering emasculation\\" and director Paul Weiland for his \\"brisk pace\\" direction over \\"a lazy script from three screenwriters who take the low road every time.\\" She concluded that, \\"[T]he cinematic equivalent of a cookie-cutter wedding, Made of Honor ultimately feels a little depressing.\\" Philip Marchand of the Toronto Star noted how the film's content contains \\"numerous references to insecure masculinity\\", saying that \\"It's often a problem to determine when a movie is satirizing characters from a superior height and when it's sharing the mental level of those characters.\\" Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian said about the film beyond its \\"gibberish\\" title, \\"Everything else about it is plasticky and nonsensical with no one behaving like a real carbon-based life-form. Monaghan's charm is stifled, and a classy cameo from Sydney Pollack as Dempsey's scapegrace dad goes for nothing. A film to leave at the altar.\\" Ed Gonzalez from Slant Magazine called the film \\"soul-crushingly predictable\\", lamenting the misuse of Pollack's \\"ostensible prestige\\" only for it to be diminished by Kevin Sussman's character, unfunny sex jokes, irritating soundtrack and defamation of Scottish people.

After a prolonged defense in which Hesse was badly wounded, Gaeta surrendered and its garrison was granted generous terms by Mass√©na. The 1806 Invasion of Naples by Napoleon's forces was provoked when King Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies joined the Third Coalition against Imperial France. The Kingdom of Naples was rapidly overrun by Imperial soldiers, but Hesse stubbornly held out at Gaeta. The garrison put up such fierce resistance that a large part of Mass√©na's Army of Naples was tied up in the siege for nearly five months. This prevented Mass√©na from sending reinforcements to quell an uprising that had started in Calabria as well as allowing the British to land an expeditionary force and score a victory at the Battle of Maida. However, because the British failed to relieve the garrison of Gaeta, the city was finally captured in mid-July after French artillery smashed gaps in the city's defences. Background By the late summer of 1805, the War of the Third Coalition was about to break out. Emperor Napoleon deployed 94,000 men to defend his possessions in Italy. Marshal Andr√© Mass√©na had 68,000 men in the main army, the satellite Kingdom of Italy added 8,000, and an observation corps of 18,000 kept an eye on the Kingdom of Naples. Against Napoleon's empire, the Austrian army in Italy under Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen ranged 90,000 men.Schneid (2002), p. 18 Neapolitan army of King Ferdinand IV counted a mere 22,000 soldiers. Afraid that the French might invade his domain, the king concluded a treaty with Napoleon to remain neutral.Schneid (2002), p. 47 In exchange, the French agreed to evacuate Apulia in southern Italy. The treaty was ratified in Naples on 3 October. As soon as the ink was dry, the French observation corps abandoned Apulia and marched north to join Mass√©na's army. Immediately, Ferdinand and Queen Maria Carolina treacherously summoned two Coalition expeditionary forces to Naples. Lieutenant General James Henry Craig sailed from Malta with 7,500 British troops while General Maurice Lacy of Grodno (1740-1820) landed 14,500 Russian soldiers from Corfu.Johnston (1904), p. 68 A second source noted that 6,000 men under Craig and 7,350 under Lacy landed at Naples on 20 November 1805. By this time only 10,000 Franco-Italian troops observed the Neapolitan border. As Craig and Lacy prepared for an offensive into northern Italy, they were astounded to find that the Neapolitan army was not ready to join them. Without the assistance of their allies, Craig and Lacy were only strong enough to maintain a defensive posture. Meanwhile, the Kingdom of Naples belatedly drafted 6,000 men for military service by pressing jailed criminals into the ranks. In the meantime, a reinforcement of 6,000 Russians landed.Johnston (1904), pp. 71-72 Napoleon's decisive victory at the Battle of Austerlitz on 2 December 1805 ended the Third Coalition.Smith (1998), p. 217 After Czar Alexander I of Russia ordered Lacy to withdraw his force, Craig decided to evacuate the British corps also. Understanding that retribution would soon follow, the Neapolitan government was thrown into chaos.Johnston (1904), pp. 73-74 The king knew that he had double-crossed Napoleon. Casting about for a good position to defend, Craig offered to hold the fortress of Gaeta. However, its governor, Prince Louis of Hesse-Philippsthal stubbornly refused to admit his men to the citadel. The British general then asked the Neapolitan government if he could land his troops at Messina in Sicily. This offer was rudely turned down. Ignoring this slight, Craig got his corps aboard ships on 19 January 1806 and sailed to Messina. The British soldiers waited on their naval transports in harbor until the king and queen finally allowed them to land on 13 February.Johnston (1904), pp. 74-76 Invasion Andr√© Massena The French army under Mass√©na crossed the border on 8 February 1806, meeting little or no resistance.Schneid (2002), p. 48 King Ferdinand had already fled to Sicily on 23 January and Queen Carolina followed suit on 11 February.Johnston (1904), p. 84 On the Adriatic coast, a division under Giuseppe Lechi captured Foggia before turning west across the Apennines and reaching Naples. Mass√©na's main column rapidly arrived near Gaeta, about north of Naples. Since Hesse refused to surrender and the very strong fortress dominated the coast road, the French commander assigned Gardanne's division to blockade it. On 14 February, Mass√©na seized Naples with his remaining soldiers. Napoleon had chosen his brother Joseph Bonaparte to replace Ferdinand and the new king made a triumphant entrance to the city the next day.Johnston (1904), p. 86 At this time, Joseph assumed control of the army. He put all troops in the vicinity of Naples under Mass√©na and his field army under Jean Reynier. Reynier soon left Naples and advanced to the southSchneid (2002), p. 49 with approximately 10,000 troops.Johnston (1904), p. 88 On 9 March 1806 Reynier's force encountered 14,000 Neapolitans under Roger de Damas.Johnston (1904), p. 89 In the Battle of Campo Tenese the Neapolitans were routed, losing 3,000 soldiers, all their artillery, and their wagon train.Smith (1998), p. 221 While Reynier pursued Damas' crippled force, a French corps under Guillaume Philibert Duhesme chased another body of Neapolitans.Schneid (2002), p. 50 The Neapolitan army fell apart during the retreat. The militia went home and most of the regulars deserted; only 2,000 to 3,000 regulars were evacuated to Sicily.Johnston (1904), p. 90 The high- handed behavior of French and allied soldiers soon provoked a serious revolt among the Calabrian peasantry. Typically, Imperial French soldiers were waylaid and killed. French commanders responded by attacking and burning villages, leading to an ugly cycle of atrocity and counter-atrocity.Johnston (1904), pp. 92-96 Forces Prince Louis of Hesse In 1806, Gaeta had a population of about 8,000 and possessed powerful fortifications. The city stood on a peninsula that jutted into the sea. Gaeta's landward approaches were defended by a long fortified trace that was three lines deep in places. The Breach Battery was above the sea, the Queen's Battery even higher, while the Tower of Orlando stood high. These works could concentrate a large volume of fire against any attacker.Johnston (1904), p. 106 Gaeta's garrison under Hesse counted 3,750 foot soldiers disposed in the following regiments, 3rd Battalion of the Presidio (990), 3rd Battalion of the Carolina (850), Prince (600), Val di Mazzara (600), Apulia Chasseurs (110), Val Demone (100), and Val Dinotto (100). There were also 400 volunteers in the garrison. The garrison also included 2,000 irregulars.Schneid (2002), p. 175 Many of the regulars were poor material, the scrapings of Neapolitan and Sicilian jails.Johnston (1904), p. 107 The I Corps under Mass√©na consisted of two French infantry divisions under Generals of Division Louis Partouneaux and Gaspard Am√©d√©e Gardanne and two French cavalry divisions led by Generals of Division Julien Augustin Joseph Mermet and Jean-Louis-Brigitte Espagne. Partouneaux's division included the 22nd and 29th Line Infantry Regiments in the 1st Brigade and the 52nd and 101st Line in the 2nd Brigade. All regiments had 3 battalions. Gardanne's division had three battalions each of the 20th and 62nd Line in the 1st Brigade and one battalion each of the Corsican Legion and the 32nd Light Infantry Regiment plus the three-battalion 102nd Line in the 2nd Brigade. Mermet's division comprised the 23rd and 24th Dragoon Regiments in the 1st Brigade and the 29th and 30th Dragoons in the 2nd Brigade. Espagne's division was made up of a Polish regiment and the 4th Chasseurs √† Cheval Regiment in the 1st Brigade and the 14th and 25th Chasseurs √† Cheval in the 2nd Brigade. All cavalry units had four squadrons. The corps artillery included six 6-pound cannons, two 3-pound cannons, and five howitzers.Schneid (2002), pp. 173-174 Gaeta Siege of Gaeta plan shows the fortress defenses and the French siege parallels. Gaeta's commander Prince Hesse was an eccentric soldier of fortune. The general was short in stature and red-faced with an aquiline nose. Known for his hard drinking, he was also a good leader of men. He gained the respect of his poorly motivated soldiers by joking with them and showing outstanding personal courage. From the first days of the siege, he posted himself at the Breach Battery and announced that he would not quit until the siege was done. He also vowed to limit his drinking to only one bottle a day. Referring to Karl Mack von Leiberich's surrender of Ulm, he famously yelled at the besiegers through a speaking-trumpet, \\"Gaeta is not Ulm! Hesse is not Mack!\\" When the French first arrived in the neighborhood on 13 February, they demanded that the fortress be handed over to them. When Hesse answered the request by firing a cannon, the French left an observation force in the area.Johnston (1904), p. 108 Nicolas Guiot de Lacour The Siege of Gaeta began on 26 February 1806. Mass√©na made a reconnaissance of the fortress and assigned General of Brigade Nicolas Bernard Guiot de Lacour to command the besiegers. Batteries were dug and armed with cannons obtained from the arsenals at Capua and Naples. The French siege lines were anchored on Monte Secco, which was from the fortress, and on the more distant Plateau of Atratina. On 21 March, the French formally summoned Gaeta to surrender. Hesse replied that his answer would be found in the breach, which is to say that the French would first have to batter a hole in the wall. But when the besiegers' guns opened fire they were quickly silenced by the 80 cannons that Hesse had trained on their new batteries. The French went back to work rebuilding their batteries, bringing up more cannons, and digging trenches closer to the defenses. On 5 April, Hesse refused another French summons. When the besiegers' cannons opened fire they were again rapidly put out of action by the superior weight of Gaeta's artillery.Johnston (1904), p. 108-109 Realizing that Gaeta could not be cheaply taken, the French appointed General of Brigade Jacques David Martin de Campredon, an engineering expert, to direct the siege. In order to get close enough to blast a breach in the walls, the French began digging parallels into the ground in front of Monte Sacco. Because the soil was rocky, this process was difficult. Meanwhile, Hesse was loath to mount sorties to destroy the French siege lines because the Neapolitan soldiers would frequently desert to the French. Hesse requested assistance from his government, but did not receive any right away because Admiral Sidney Smith was fully employed in supporting the guerilla war in Calabria.Johnstone (1904), p. 110 At length, Smith's squadron arrived at Gaeta and dropped off food, four heavy cannons, and the partisan leader Michele Pezza, also known as Fra Diavolo. Smith also ordered some gunboats under Captain Richardson to stand by the fortress, a reinforcement which proved troublesome to the enemy. Sometime in April, the Royal Navy landed Fra Diavolo and considerable force of irregulars near the mouth of the Garigliano. Their raid was successful at first but the partisans were finally scattered and Fra Diavolo made his way back to Gaeta. When Fra Diavolo was later implicated in a scheme to betray Gaeta, Hesse had him shipped back to Palermo in chains.Johnstone (1904), p. 113 Hesse had no use for the partisan leader Fra Diavolo. Until the end of May, the French besiegers never had more than 4,000 men. But after that date they started to get heavily reinforced so that their numbers doubled by 28 June. On that day, Mass√©na took personal command of the siege. In the meantime, the garrison made sorties on 13 and 15 May, putting a few cannons out of action and carrying off some prisoners. By early June, the French had dug parallels within of the fortress and constructed batteries for 100 cannons. All the work was done under murderous defensive fire from Gaeta.Johnston (1904), p. 114 French General of Brigade Joseph S√©cret Pascal- Vallongue was mortally wounded in the head on 12 June and died on the 17th. Joseph Pascal-Vallongue On 28 June, the French opened fire with 50 heavy cannons and 23 mortars. This time, Gaeta's artillery was unable to suppress the besiegers' fire, which dismounted some guns and caused numerous casualties. By 1 July, the bombardment had blown up three powder magazines in the fortress, but Hesse refused to give up. There was a lull, while the French sapped closer to the walls.Johnston (1904), p. 131 On the 3rd, 1,500 reinforcements to the garrison arrived by sea. That evening Richardson's vessels bombarded the French lines without result. At 3:00 AM on 7 July, the French opened fire again with 90 cannons. The mutual bombardment inflicted great damage to both attackers and defenders. But the greatest loss to the defenders occurred when Hesse was badly wounded by a bursting shell on 10 July and had to be evacuated by sea. His replacement was Colonel Hotz, an officer of only ordinary talent. Worried that their supply of shells would run out, the French offered a bounty for the recovery of unexploded ordnance. On the 11th, Mass√©na's artillery commander General of Brigade Fran√ßois Louis Dedon- Duclos begged the marshal for a pause in the bombardment, lest they run out of ammunition. Hoping that the loss of Hesse would demoralize Gaeta's garrison, Mass√©na ordered the fire to continue.Johnston (1904), p. 132-133 On 12 July 1806, two breaches began to be seen in Gaeta's walls, one at the Breach Battery on the left and one under the Queen's Battery on the right. Surrender was demanded, but Hotz refused. The barrage continued and on the 15th a French engineer officer crept far enough forward to note that the west breach could be attacked. By 16 July, Mass√©na had heard about the French defeat at Maida and was anxious to capture Gaeta. There remained only 184,000 pounds of gunpowder and less than 5,000 shot, a three-day supply. By this time, the French had 12,000 troops on hand in the infantry divisions of Partouneaux and Gardanne, with the cavalry divisions of Espagne and Mermet in support. Despite the ammunition shortage, the bombardment dragged on, widening the breaches. Normally, the commander of the besiegers kept the time of the final assault on a fortress a secret from the defenders. But Mass√©na intended to overawe Hotz with his deliberate preparations for attack. On the morning of 18 July in full view of the defenders, the French massed a force of grenadiers and chasseurs under General of Brigade Fran√ßois-Xavier Donzelot to attack the left breach, while voltigeurs led by Valentin assembled to assault the right breach. The French ostentatiously marched up supporting troops. Mass√©na's bluff had the intended effect when Hotz put up a white flag at 3:00 PM.Johnston (1904), p. 134 Results Because of its prolonged defense and because he needed to capture Gaeta quickly, Mass√©na granted lenient terms to Hotz. The garrison was allowed to sail away to Sicily on the promise not to fight against France for one year. The fortress and all its cannons, of which one in three were damaged, was given over to French control. An embarrassing incident occurred when a considerable body of the Neapolitan regulars deserted to the French. The French admitted losses of 1,000 killed and wounded, but they may have been twice that.Johnston (1904), p. 135 Out of a garrison of 7,000, the Neapolitans lost 1,000 killed and wounded plus 171 cannons. On 4 July 1806, a British expedition under John Stuart defeated a French division led by Reynier at the Battle of Maida. After the victory, Stuart and Admiral Smith decided to move south and mop up the French garrisons in Calabria. Thus, a chance was missed to interrupt the siege of Gaeta or to land at Naples in an attempt to overthrow Joseph's government. Gaeta's surrender freed Mass√©na's force for operations in Calabria. Stuart's triumph did, however, prevent a potential French invasion of Sicily and lengthened the Calabrian revolt. The French did not bring the region under control until 1807.Schneid (2002), p. 55 Gaeta was turned into a duch√© grand-fief in the Napoleonic Kingdom of Naples with the French name of Gaete. The duchy was awarded to finance minister Martin-Michel- Charles Gaudin on 15 August 1809. After the collapse of the Joachim Murat's kingdom in the Neapolitan War, Gaeta was the last city to hold out. The 1815 siege lasted from 28 May to 8 August before the surviving 133 officers and 1,629 men of the Neapolitan garrison surrendered to Austrian General-major Joseph von Lauer.Smith (1998), p. 556-557 Notes Conflicts in 1806 Sieges of the Napoleonic Wars Sieges involving France 1806 in Italy War of the Third Coalition Battles of the War of the Third Coalition Battles in Lazio Sieges involving the Kingdom of Naples ","title":"Siege of Gaeta (1806)"},{"id":"14461414","text":"The Siege of Gaeta of 1815 was a three-month siege of the city of Gaeta by Austrian forces during the Neapolitan War.

Career In the mid-1980s, was Washington correspondent for London's Spectator. He was a correspondent for The Economist on Central America. In 1991, he began working at the Daily Telegraph. He served as Sunday Telegraph's Washington, D.C. bureau chief from the early 1990s until 1997. In the early 1990s until 1997, he was the Sunday Telegraph's Washington, D.C. bureau chief. He was the Telegraph's Europe correspondent in Brussels from 1999 to 2004. He has been at the Telegraph for over thirty years. As a long-time opponent of austerity policies in southern Europe and critic of monetary union, he strongly defended quantitative easing policies in the developed world. The Secret Life of Bill Clinton He is the author of a 1997 biography of Bill Clinton, entitled The Secret Life of Bill Clinton: The Unreported Stories which was published by conservative publishing firm Regnery Publishing. In 1997 Salon called him \\"The Pied Piper of the Clinton Conspiracists\\" in a revue that said Evans-Pritchard wrote about the Oklahoma City bombing conspiracy theory as well as other conspiracy theories related to Clinton, including the death of Vince Foster. While working as the Telegraph Washington correspondent, his reports about President Bill Clinton, the 1993 death of Vincent Foster, and the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing were considered to be controversial and often attracted the ire of the Clinton administration. When he left Washington, a White House aide was quoted in George saying, \\"That's another British invasion we're glad is over. The guy was nothing but a pain in the ass\\". His efforts in ferreting out the witness, Patrick Knowlton, whose last name had been spelled \\"Nolton\\" in the Park Police report on Foster's death, resulted eventually in a lawsuit by Knowlton against the FBI and the inclusion of Knowlton's lawyer's letter as an appendix to Kenneth Starr's report on Foster's death.Report on the Death of Vincent W. Foster, Jr.; Evans- Pritchard, The Secret Life of Bill Clinton, p. 159 In his book, Evans- Pritchard responded vigorously to White House charges against him. In the media Allegedly, in a 19 February 2009 article in The Economist (reference missing), Evans-Pritchard was described as a modern day Cassandra‚Äîin reference to the epicle figure in Greek mythology whose accurate prophecies were not believed.

The country's Ministry of Health and Social Development requires sex workers to carry identification cards and to have monthly health checkups. Prostitution is common, particularly in Caracas and in other domestic tourist destinations. The Venezuelan sex work industry arose in conjunction with the oil industry of the twentieth century and continues today.  History  Sex work in Venezuela is closely tied to its economic history and the history of oil production. Venezuela received an influx of population after the first significant oil wells were drilled in the beginning of the 20th century. The presence of relatively well-paid foreign oil workers greatly expanded the sex trade in port cities. In particular, black women of a lower socioeconomic class who could not get jobs as domestics or selling sweets and candies as street vendors in urban areas turned to prostitution for money. Women and girls from surrounding Andean states, in particular Colombia, were also recruited to come to Venezuela and sometimes forced to work in the sex trade. Prostitution became a big business and women from the Caribbean and even Europe (notably Holland, France, and Belgium) came to Venezuela looking for work. Black women made up the majority of sex workers until the 1920s when French women took over the prostitution district of Silencio in Caracas and the port cities of La Guiara and Puerto Cabello. Guajiro Indian women outnumbered black or European sex workers in Maracaibo. Establishments frequented by oilmen like the famous Pavilion opened up as combination bar, brothels, and dance hall. Sex workers from rural areas would also be transported to oil towns on Saturdays, ‚Äúwhere workers lined the docks to greet them by name.‚ÄùSome companies even began dispensing condoms, and city leaders began to regulate and limit the trade. They classified the activity, applied a city tax to the work, and required weekly medical examinations of the sex workers. The city also began to require that workers carry health cards with them. In 1930, an anti-venereal institute conducted a census of major towns in the state, and prostitutes were required to report where they worked to local offices. Some upper-class sex workers had access to private doctors for regular exams. A market for local remedies to venereal diseased developed, but the rate of STIs continued to increase. In 1935, the government made the first Sunday in September Anti-Venereal Disease Day. By 1947, the government estimated that 64 percent of hospital patients had syphilis, and 37 percent of patients had other venereal diseases such as chancroid (chancre blando). A Ministry of Health report showed that the office needed over 3 million units of penicillin at any given time for the treatment of syphilis. Oil companies started testing and firing employees with syphilis until unions got involved and called for treatment without termination. Eventually, the public's sense of morality was offended by the effects of the growing sex trade, and night clubs with prostitutes and brothels were moved from downtown to red light districts on the outskirts of cities. Many ended up between large Shell and Lago urban camps, which continued to supply them with ‚Äúinnumerable patrons.‚Äù  Women's rights movements and prostitution  In 1935, the Women's Cultural Association (Asociaci√≥n Cultural Femenina or ACF) was the first influential women's rights group to in Venezuela to talk about prostitution. They gave public talks about sex work and protection from STIs. However, other women's groups, such as women's socialist movements, called for an end to prostitution in the 1940s. Though advocacy for sex workers did continue throughout the century, and a local sex worker organization called AMBAR received international attention and support after opposing illegal offices searches of sex work agencies by the police.  Prostitution in the late 20th century  Rates of trafficking and prostitution increased again after Venezuela's economic decline due to a decrease in oil revenues and an increase in foreign debt payments in 1980s. The catastrophic flood of December 1999 also led to high levels of unemployment, particularly for women, in Venezuela. Some women turned to sex work and were trafficked internally or internationally.Raymond, Janice G, Jean d‚ÄôCunha, Siti Ruhaini Dzuhayatin, H Patricia Hynes, Zoraida Ramirez Rodriguez, and Aida Santos. (2002). \\"A Comparative Study of Women Trafficked in the Migration Process: Patterns, Profiles and Health Consequences of Sexual Exploitation in Five Countries (Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Venezuela and the United States) \\". North Amherst, MA: Ford Foundation, 161-162.  Current laws  Prostitution is currently legal in Venezuela. In March 2007, the Organic Law on the Right of Women to a Life Free of Violence criminalized trafficking and forced prostitution, among other forms of gender-based violence. Trafficking can now result in up to 20 years of penalties for coercing a victim to perform a sexual act against their will for a third party. Inducing child prostitution and the ‚Äúcorruption of minors‚Äù is penalized with three to 18 months in prison or up to four years in prison if the minor is under 12. Sentences increase to up to six years if the crime is recurrently committed. Venezuela's Ministry of Health and Social Development (Ministerio de Salud y Desarrollo Social) requires that women working as sex workers in nightclubs have a free monthly health check. The check includes a gynecological exam and a syphilis screening. HIV tests are required every six months. Sex workers are not screened for infections caused by the hepatitis B or C viruses.Camejo, Mar√≠a I, Gloria Mata, and Marcos D√≠az. (2003). \\"Prevalencia De Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C Y S√≠filis En Trabajadoras Sexuales De Venezuela.\\" Revista de Sa√∫de P√∫blica 37: 339-44.  Identification cards  Article 6 of the 1949 Convenci√≥n para la Represi√≥n de la Trata de Personas y de la Explotaci√≥n de la Prostituci√≥n Ajena (Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others) calls for signatories to repeal or abolish any law, regulation, or administrative provision that requires registration or possession of special identification cards by sex workers. Venezuela, a signatory of the Convention, is in violation of Article 6 because sex workers must carry identity cards issued by the Health Ministry that guarantees that card holders are free of STIs and HIV/AIDS. This is a common practice in Latin American and Caribbean countries. When police and Healthy Ministry workers raid nightclubs, women without these cards are arrested or expected to provide money and/or sexual favors. However, a state- issued national identity card is required to obtain the Health Ministry card, making it impossible for undocumented immigrants to legally obtain the card. Many go to private agents or \\"gestores\\" to obtain documents.  Demographics  There have been no large-scale studies in order to collect demographic information about sex workers in Venezuela. A study of 212 sex workers conducted in 2003 evaluated at a health center in a city near Caracas found that 91% of workers were Venezuelan. The rest of the workers came from Colombia, the Dominican Republic, and Ecuador. The workers had an average age of 29.6 and an average of 2.12 children. 55.7% had one or two children. 53% of the women dropped out of secondary school. Over 80% of the workers had had sexual intercourse before the age of 19. 44.1% of the women previously had an abortion. 41.7% used condoms all the time, 20.7% on occasion, and 36.5% reported that they never used condoms.  Trans sex workers  Special scholarly attention has been paid to the lives of trans sex workers in Venezuela, called travesti. Travesti are people who are assigned male at birth but who present in their daily lives as women. Some consider the term an insult, but it is also used by travesti as a self-identification. Studies have reported a problematic relationship between the Polic√≠a Metropolitana de Caracas (PM) and transformista sex workers. Transformistas face the problem of officer impunity and a culture of silence.Martinez, Carlos, Michael Fox, and Jojo Farrell. (2010). Venezuela Speaks: Voices from the Grassroots. Oakland, Calif: PM Press, 102.Ochoa, Marcia. (2008). \\"Perverse Citizenship: Divas, Marginality, and Participation in \\"Loca-Lization\\".\\" Women's Studies Quarterly 36, no. 3/4: 146-69. When asked what she would do if a police officer assaulted her, a transformista responded \\"The PM?! Ay no. Because then when they see you on the street, just imagine.‚Äù The travesti face a penal system in which a complaint does not change police behavior but rather serves as a marker for possible future aggressions. However, the number of LGBT organizations in Venezuela has grown in the past decade, including organizations that advocate specifically for trans people and travesti sex workers. Marianela Tovar, an LGBT activist in Caracas at the organization Contranatura, explains that travesti experience violence from police and clients of sex work but still feel forced to do sex work because ‚Äúit‚Äôs the only way that they can be their true gender identity.‚Äù In other professions common for women in Venezuela, such as nursing, trans women would not be able to present as their chosen gender identity.  Transformista migration  Another trend regarding Venezuelan travesti that has been investigated is the migration trans women from Venezuela to Europe to become transgender sex workers. The first generation to do this came to Italy in the 1970s. Now, travesti also travel to Spain, France, Germany, and Switzerland. In Europe, travesti are able to ‚Äúenhance the process of transforming their male bodies towards perfect femininity.‚Äù The trans sex trade in Europe is lucrative, and their earnings allow them to transform their bodies through plastic surgery, expensive hair extensions, makeup, designer clothes, and accessories.Vogel, Katrin. (2009) \\"The Mother, the Daughter, and the Cow: Venezuelan Transformistas‚Äô Migration to Europe.\\" Mobilities 4, no. 3 (2009/11/01): 367-87. Sex trafficking Venezuela is a source and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. As the economic situation deteriorated, the mass migration of Venezuelans to neighboring countries increased. During the reporting period, alleged victims of trafficking from Venezuela were identified in Aruba, Colombia, Costa Rica, Curacao, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Greece, Portugal, Guyana, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Spain, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago. Venezuelan women and girls, including some lured from poor interior regions to urban and tourist centers, are subjected to sex trafficking and child sex tourism within the country. Venezuelan officials and international organizations have reported identifying sex trafficking victims from South American, Caribbean, Asian, and African countries in Venezuela. Venezuelan officials reported an increase of sex trafficking in the informal mining sector. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Venezuela as a 'Tier 3' country.

The school caters for students in Years 7‚Äì10 from mainstream schools in the Sydney area and who have behavioural or emotional problems or who are otherwise at risk of not completing their education. Berne shares a large campus (formerly St Thomas Boys High School) with 2 other small schools: the Catholic Intensive English Centre and a small satellite school of Trinity Grammar (pre Kindergarten‚ÄìYear 2). The school opened on 28 April 1998, with a staff of five teachers and two support staff. The initial enrolment consisted of 28 students. It replaced the Benedict Community School, which had been in operation since 1976. Berne is a registered special school and founding member of the Association of Catholic Special School Services (ACSSS). It provides an education to those young people who are at risk of not completing their School Certificate (the basic level of qualification in New South Wales). Mainstream classes are unsuitable for most of the students because of behavioural, emotional, and familial reasons. The John Berne School is owned and operated by the Marist Brothers, an order founded in France during the early 19th century by St Marcellin Champagnat. Culture The school caters for students who may be experiencing problems due to physical, psychological, emotional and/or familial reasons. They may also have learning difficulties and/or disorders. Their placement at Berne could be short term, where the aim is to work on the student‚Äôs behavioural or emotional issues in order to reintegrate them back into their mainstream school, or long term, where the aim is to continue to educate them through to the School Certificate. The school‚Äôs culture has been designed to defuse a lot of the behavioural triggers the students were experiencing in mainstream schools. For example, there is no uniform and there is no set homework. The student-teacher relationship is unusual compared to mainstream schools. Students address staff by their first name, and even eat meals together. All staff are expected to get involved in all school activities, such as camps, excursions and personal development activities. There is a strong focus on reducing the derailing effects of learning difficulties and disorders by having small class sizes (of about five or six students per class), and by streaming students based on ability. The lower ability classes are purposefully even smaller, usually having only two or three students per teacher. Special features The school is unusual in its very high staff-to-student ratio. It is also distinctive in providing a number of special programs: *Counselling to assist with behavioural needs *Breakfast program *Student Withdrawal Assistance Program (SWAP), a program to enable other schools to respond appropriately to the special needs of struggling students *\\"Cracking the Code\\" literacy program *Outdoor education program, which provides a camp or outdoor activity each term *A daily living skills program, covering topics like meal preparation and shopping within a budget *Preparation for the workplace by way of writing job applications, appropriate workplace behaviour and the like, supplemented by work experience placements *Changing Lanes Program, for ex-students proceeding to employment, or starting an apprenticeship or other course Recognition In 2006, the John Berne School received a \\"Highly Commended National Achievement in School Improvement\\" award from the Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership. Pete‚Äôs Place campus The John Berne School has since 2010 operated a second campus, called Pete's Place School, at Blacktown. Pete's Place operates in a different way from the main campus of the John Berne School: it has a smaller number of students (15 approximately) and the instruction, provided by three full-time teachers and one part-time teacher‚Äôs aide, is more individual.

The brewery creates a wide range of beers, including versions of 'traditional' Belgian styles such as Strong Golden Ales, Abbey-style beers and Saison, as well as original creations that cross stylistic boundaries and beers inspired by styles from outside their home country like Imperial Stout. Although quite small and a newcomer to the Belgian brewing world, being founded in 2002, Alvinne has gained international attention. Name The name of the brewery derives from a female spirit of local folk tales. Their earlier name included the term \\"Picobrouwerij\\", a play on the scientific terminology for very small objects. It is based on the fact that the brewery's production is smaller by several orders of magnitude than that of a typical microbrewery. The prefix Pico- is playfully combined with \\"brouwerij\\", the Dutch and Flemish term for brewery. History At the beginning of Alvinne's existence in 2002, they brewed their beers at the De Graal brewery premises in Brakel, East Flanders, later moving to their own premises in the town of Ingelmunster proper in 2003. In 2006 they relocated again to their current facility in Heule. The new brewery at Moen The brewery makes beer about three times per week to make up the annual volume. A brew kettle of 600 liter capacity is used, but batch volume is restricted to 300 liters for the stronger beers due to the limited size of the mash/lauter tun. There are four 1000 liter steel fermentation tanks. The Alvinne products are generally only available in 33cl bottles (of the short, squat variety popularly associated with beers like Duvel) and on tap. All of the Alvinne beers are unfiltered and unpasteurized. The brewery lists most ingredients of their beers on the label. English and Czech hop varieties are most common in their recipes, and the beers produced combine traditional Belgian brewing techniques such as the use of sugar and spices with the methods and styles of other nations. The large quantity of beer styles in production is particularly uncommon for a brewery of such modest size, as is the fact that the diverse brews are created using different commercially available yeast strains (as opposed a single 'house' strain) to obtain specific flavors and aromas. Beers *Alvinne Blond (6.0% ABV) A blond \\"Special\\" ale, this is brewed with Pilsner and wheat malt, crystallized sugar and English hops of the Fuggles Northern Brewer varieties. 33 IBU. *Alvinne Bruin (6.5% ABV) A brown ale made with Pilsner and 5 specialty malts, light candi sugar and Goldings, Hallertau and Northern Brewer hops. 32 IBU. *Alvinne Blond Extra (7.1% ABV) A dry-hopped strong golden ale. Brewed with Pilsner, wheat and caramel malts, crystallized sugar and English hops of the Fuggles, Target and East Kent Goldings varieties. 30 IBU. *Alvinne Tripel (8.7% ABV) Brewed in the Abbey Tripel style, this dark gold ale is made with Pilsner, wheat, caramel and Vienna malts, light candi sugar and vanilla, and hopped with Fuggles, Challenger and East Kent Goldings to 33 IBU. This beer was launched in March 2005 at the Zythos Beer Festival.zythos.be *Balthazar (9.0% ABV) The first of three Christmas beers named after the Three Wise Men of Bible story. The choice of name reflects the popularity in Belgium of the pre-Christmas holiday of Epiphany, or Three Kings Day. Balthazar is a dark reddish-brown strong ale made spicy with the addition of coriander, cardamom and ginger. Brewed with Pilsner and 4 special malts, dark candi sugar and the spices listed above, it is hopped with Challenger and East Kent Goldings to 28 IBU. The spiciness is accentuated by the use of the commercial version of the Rochefort yeast strain. *Melchior (11.0% ABV) The second of the Christmas beers. A very strong ale described by the brewery as being in the barleywine style. Made with Pilsner, wheat, Munich and aromatic malts, crystallized sugar and mustard seeds, this beer was released in 2005 at the popular beer caf√© Pado in Tielt. Bittered to 60 IBU with Challenger and East Kent Goldings, it is fermented with a Belgian Strong Ale yeast. *Gaspar (8.0% ABV) The third of the Christmas beers. An extremely bitter strong golden ale formulated to exceed 115 IBU. Brewed with Pilsner, pale, wheat and chocolate malts and hopped with Saaz hops, Hallertau and East Kent Goldings. Uses a Belgian Trappist yeast strain. *Podge Belgian Imperial Stout (10.5% ABV) Brewed at the request of English beer connoisseur Chris \\"Podge\\" Pollard (a CAMRA activist and craft beer authority), this strong stout is black in color and has a rich, silky mouthfeel and slightly spicy flavor, but very low carbonation and no head at all \\"for the English taste\\". Made with Pilsner plus six other malt varieties, crystallized sugar and dark candi sugar, and hopped with English Challenger and East Kent Goldings hops. After taste-testing of multiple strains, the Wyeastwyeastlabs.com Irish Ale yeast variety was selected for this brew. *n Maurootje Lauwse Saison (7.0% ABV) This example of the Belgian Farmhouse Ale style began as a final project recipe created by one of Glenn Castelein's brewing students, William Roelens, who named it after his grandson Mauro, who lives in the town of Lauwe. The Alvinne brewers were so impressed by this beer that they added it to their lineup with Roelens' permission. *Dertig (8.0% ABV) A limited-edition strong golden ale brewed to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Hotel Erasmus in Brugge and available only at the hotel restaurant's tap. The name means \\"thirty\\" in Dutch and Flemish. In addition to marketing their products under their own names, the brewery also follows the Belgian practice of offering \\"label beers\\" (Etiketbieren) for pubs, restaurants and other establishments. In this practice batches of the beer are produced and given a special label with the name and design of the client. These are typically the same beer recipes as the regular line, merely issued under a different title. Brewer Glenn Castelein also teaches a noted annual brewing course. Alvinne has made its brewing apparatus available for projects by selected acquaintances and others. This includes the \\"Kroegbier\\" line of brews made by the owners of the 't Kroegske craft beer pub in nearby Emelgem.

The Norwegian law prohibiting the buying of sexual acts came into effect on 1 January 2009, following the passing of new legislation by the Norwegian parliament in November 2008. Soliciting and advertising \\"sexual services\\" is also illegal under the Norwegian Criminal Code section 378 and section 202(3).  History   Early era  In early times, proscription of prostitution fell under more general laws on fornication and adultery, particularly after the Reformation. Around this time, sexual acts started to be moved from civil law (largely with fines) to criminal law. For instance, in one part of Mediaeval law, the Frostathing Law, it is stated, \\"If a woman lies with a man whom she is not allowed to possess, she owes a fine of three marks, just as he does with whom she lies\\". Regulation of sexuality in the High Middle Ages was largely a function of the Church, for whom only heterosexual sexual relations within marriage were acceptable. Despite this, prostitution was not considered amongst the most serious sexual crimes, but was frequently associated with other nuisances such as gambling, drinking, and causing a disturbance.  Nineteenth century  Albertine at the Police Doctor's Waiting Room, by Christian Krohg, 1886-1887 Prostitution was criminalised in Norway with the introduction of the new Criminal Code (Norske Lov) in 1842, but was made legal again when the Penal Code (Straffeloven) was revised in 1902, when the prohibition of both the sale and purchase of sex was lifted. However, even during that time, it was actually tolerated and regulated in practice, in the larger cities such as Oslo, Bergen, and Trondheim. While prostitution was defined as an immoral vice, it was street prostitution that was especially frowned upon, being visible. It was also considered important to distinguish between \\"decent\\" and \\"indecent\\" women.Schi√∏tz, A. (1980). Prostitusjon og prostituerte i 1880-√•ras Kristiania, in A. M.

The regulation of prostitution in Europe (Regulationism) was closely tied to the concept that prostitution was a source of venereal disease, requiring medical supervision.Roger Davidson and Leslie Hall (eds), Sex, sin and suffering: venereal disease and European society since 1870, London and New York, Routledge, 2001, pp. 1-14.Mary Spongberg, Feminizing venereal disease: the body of the prostitute in nineteenth-century medical discourse, Basingstoke, Macmillan, 1997Aina Schi√∏tz, ‚ÄòProstitusjon og prostituerte i 1880-√•ras Kristiania‚Äô, in Anne-Marit Gotaas, Brita Gulli, Kari Melby and Aina Schi√∏tz (eds.), Det kriminelle kj√∏nn: om barnef√∏dsel i d√∏lgsm√•l, abort og prostitusjon, Oslo, Pax, 1980, pp. 35-39Kari Melby, \\"Prostitusjon og kontroll\\", in Anne-Marit Gotaas, Brita Gulli, Kari Melby and Aina Schi√∏tz (eds.), Det kriminelle kj√∏nn: om barnef√∏dsel i d√∏lgsm√•l, abort og prostitusjon, Oslo, Pax, 1980, pp. 83-85 This form of regulation first appeared in Bergen, then the largest Norwegian municipality, in 1816, in (what is now known as) Oslo in 1840, and Trondheim in 1844. Regulation was at least on the surface contrary to the Penal Code which had made fornication and hence prostitution a criminal offence in 1842. In practice the latter law was considered only to apply to males. The media, the church, and social commentators started to express concerns about prostitution which was labelled as The Great Social Evil. Various institutions stated a desire to rescue 'fallen women', and help them exit their trade and 're-enter society', training them for positions such as domestic servants. In the mid-nineteenth century, there was a growth of organised society, in which religious and philanthropic organisations developed, many of which had a predominance of women members. Amongst these were \\"societies for the defense of moral standards\\", concerned inter alia with prostitution and the government's failure to deal with it. (UNESCO 1989, p. 13) Brothels were eventually prohibited in Norway in 1887 as part of a pan-European moral reform campaign of Abolitionism that replaced Regulationism and was supposed to end prostitution. The change in the Penal Code in 1902 did not, however, mean that prostitution was more tolerated by society. The exchange of sex in one's own home was now legal, but loitering and procurement was not, and women seen selling sex in public were directed to \\"rehabilitation\\" programs.  Modern era  A Pan-Scandinavian conference on prostitution was held in Lillehammer in 1993. Sex workers participated, and the emphasis was on harm reduction. Liv Jessen from Pro-Sentret compared this to the punitive approach of the radical \\"Women's Front\\" (Kvinnefronten), a feminist activist group.International Encyclopedia of Sexuality: Norway The debate on what to do was to continue for another 30 years. Kvinnenfronten had been founded in 1972, and was to work for a change in the law over all of that time.  Legal framework The criminal Code deals with organised crime (Section 60a), third parties (tredjeparts), and procurers, such as pimps (hallik, halliker (pl.)) or madams (S 202), purchase of sexual \\"services\\" (S 202a), purchase under 18 (S 203), and human trafficking (menneskehandel) (S 224). Norwegian General Civil Penal Code (Straffeloven) Section 60a \\"If a criminal act has been committed as part of the activity of an organised criminal group, the maximum penalty laid down in the penal provision shall be increased to double its prescribed limit, but not by more than five years' imprisonment. An organised criminal group is here defined as an organised group of three or more persons whose main purpose is to commit an act that is punishable by imprisonment for a term of not less than three years, or whose activity largely consists of committing such acts. An increase of the maximum penalty pursuant to the present provision shall be applicable in relation to statutory provisions that give legal effect to the penalty limit, unless it is otherwise provided.\\" Section 202 \\"Anyone who a) promotes the engagement of other persons in prostitution, or b) lets premises on the understanding that such premises shall be used for prostitution or is grossly negligent in this respect shall be liable to fines or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years. Any person who in a public announcement unambiguously offers, arranges or asks for prostitution shall be liable to fines or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months. In this provision, prostitution means that a person engages in sexual activity or commits a sexual act with another person in return for payment.\\" Section 202a \\"Any person who a) procures sexual intercourse or any other sexual act, for himself/herself or for another person, in return for payment or agreement to provide payment, b) procures sexual intercourse or any other sexual act in return for another person paying or agreeing to pay, or c) in the manner described in a) or b) above induces someone to carry out acts that are equivalent to sexual intercourse with himself/herself shall be liable to a fine or up to 6 months' imprisonment or both. If the sexual intercourse or act has been particularly humiliating in its nature, but it is not punishable under any other law, the punishment is imprisonment for a term of up to 1 year.\\" Section 203 \\"Any person who, in return for payment, procures sexual intercourse or any other sexual act from a person under the age of 18, shall be liable to a fine or up to 2 years‚Äô imprisonment. Being mistaken about someone's age does not affect criminal liability, unless diligent good faith has been shown.\\" Section 224 \\"Any person who by force, threats, abuse of another person's vulnerability or other improper conduct exploits another person for the purpose of a) prostitution or other sexual purposes, b) forced labour or forced services, including begging, c) military service in a foreign country, or d) removal of any of the said person's organs, or who induces another person to allow himself or herself to be used for such purposes, shall be guilty of human trafficking, and shall be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years. Any person who a) makes arrangements for such exploitation or inducement as is mentioned in the first paragraph by procuring, transporting or receiving the person concerned, b) in any other way aids and abets such exploitation or inducement, or c) provides payment or any other advantage in order to obtain consent to such exploitation from any person who is in a position of authority over the aggrieved party, or who receives such payment or other advantage shall be liable to the same penalty. Any person who commits an act referred to in the first or second paragraph against a person who is under the age of 18 shall be liable to a penalty independently of any use of force or threats, abuse of a person‚Äôs vulnerability, or other improper conduct. Being mistaken about someone‚Äôs age does not affect criminal liability, unless diligent good faith has been shown. Gross human trafficking is punishable by imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years. In deciding whether the offence is gross, particular importance shall be attached to whether the person exposed to the act was under the age of 18, whether gross violence or coercion was used or whether the act led to considerable gain.\\"  Other acts  The Planning and Building Act Specifies requirements for premises where commercial activities take place, used to close massage parlours occupying premises that do not meet the requirements for commercial activities. Tax and VAT All income is taxable, including income from prostitution, but implementation varies. Some people have been made to pay tax on their estimated earnings from prostitution, while some have registered as self-employed, to benefit from the rights that taxpayers have. Most services are liable to VAT. Welfare Prostitution is not considered legal work in Norway. Those entitled to social welfare benefits may claim economical support from NAV when not employed and indigent. Immigration Act It is for foreigners to work as prostitutes in Norway, because prostitution is not considered legal work. Section 27 states that foreigners can be deported for breaches of the peace. Police Act Section 7 (Public order and peace) allows the police to stop breaches of the peace or intervene when there is reason to fear such a breach. Child Welfare Act Protects and gives rights to children under the age of 18. If a child is in the company of sex workers, this may lead to intervention under the act. All government employees have a duty to report to the child welfare authorities if they see a child who may be suffering from neglect. Communicable Diseases Control Act Entitles residents to preventive care, diagnosis and treatment for such diseases. It does not allow collective restrictions to be imposed on sex workers.  Prostitution in Norway today  In 2013, it was estimated there were 3,000 sex workers (prostituert, prostituerte (pl.)) working in Norway (population 5 million).Population per 1 January 2013 and population changes in 2012. Counties SSB, retrieved 14 September 2013 Earnings from sex trade are estimated at 390 million kroner (¬£39m., $US63m., ‚Ç¨48m.). Norwegian prostitutes make a clear distinction between the term \\"prostitute\\" and \\"sex worker\\", seeing \\"prostitution\\" as a derogatory word (nedlatende ord). They also describe themselves as gledespike (literally, fille de joie), or hjelpepleier (health worker). As in most countries, prostitution takes on a number of different forms, including street prostitution (Gateprostitusjon) and indoor prostitution in brothels (bordell, bordeller (pl.)). Technically, both street work and brothel operations (bordellvirksomhet) are legal, even though purchase of those \\"services\\" is not, but as with other countries, technological change has resulted in a shift to offering \\"services\\" from street solicitation to mobile phones and the internet. While brothels are technically legal in that there is no explicit law banning then (de jure), the sex purchase ban prevents them operating overtly (de facto). As a form of protest, it was suggested that some sex workers might operate free brothels that circumvent the ban, to make this point. Later, it was stated that this was an exercise designed primarily to stimulate debate on the issue. The current law banning purchase creates an administrative anomaly, since any money earned is illegal, yet is taxable. Recent legislative proposals have included a ban on advertising. Some sex workers have complained about the lack of government consultation with them. In July 2014, the Nadheim City Mission has reported that street prostitution levels in Norway have returned to those prior to the introduction of the law in 2009.  Sex purchase ban   First consideration  The possibility of criminalising the purchase of sex was discussed in an official report in 1997; however, neither the Justice Department (Justis- og politidepartementet) nor the Storting (Parliament) were in favour of taking this step. The Department did, however, promise to re-look at the situation in two years. Norway then criminalised the purchase of sex from people under the age of 18 in 2000 (Law 76, 11 August; Penal Code art. ¬ß203). Straffeloven ¬ß 203.  Working group report 2004  Although Sweden had banned the purchase of sex in 1999, opinions remained divided in Norway. In 2003, as part of its Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Women and Children , the Justice Ministry investigated the situation in both the Netherlands (which had recently legalised brothels) and Sweden to better inform the debate, and concluded that neither approach would be appropriate at that point. The working group for this report was chaired by Professor Ulf Stridbeck, of Oslo University's law school. With regard's to Sweden's law, the group found that reliable data was unavailable, the law was difficult to enforce, and had had little impact (p. 23). The difference between the two countries they saw was the different way they defined prostitution, and hence approached it (p. 45). They were particularly concerned about the unintended effects of the Swedish approach (p. 52).  Changing policy due to immigration  The debate which finally led to the introduction of the sex purchase ban concerned the effects of the arrival of women from Africa, typically Nigerian, on the streets of Norway. It was argued that human trafficking was fuelled by a demand for sex and that therefore a ban was necessary, and whether solicitation was offensive.  Current law (Sexkj√∏psloven)  In November 2008, the Storting passed legislation which criminalised purchasing sex (sexkj√∏ploven). This became Section 202a of the Norwegian Penal Code. > Section 202a Any person who (a) engages in or aids and abets another person > to engage in sexual activity or commit a sexual act on making or agreeing > payment, > (b) engages in sexual activity or a sexual act on such payment being agreed > or made by another person, or > (c) in the manner described in (a) or (b) causes someone to carry out with > herself or himself acts corresponding to sexual activity, shall be liable to > fines or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to both. If > the sexual activity or sexual act is carried out in a particularly offensive > manner and no penalty may be imposed pursuant to other provisions, the > penalty shall be imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year The ban extends to Norwegians outside of Norway (extra territorial law).  Effect of sex purchase ban  Despite an initial drop in the visibility of street prostitution, later reports suggested it had returned to its previous levels. This created great difficulties for Norwegian street workers. A 2012 report on violence against sex workers Ulla Bjorndahl. Dangerous Liaisons, A survey of the violence experienced by women working as prostitutes in Oslo. Pro Sentret, 2012 created considerable interest in the media and a questioning of the law's effects. There has been considerable criticism of the law and its effects. It has proved difficult to evaluate the law, due to the problems of isolating laws from other social factors.Anette Brunovskis and May-Len Skilbrei. The ban on the purchase of sex - have Norwegian prostitution markets changed?. Fafo, 22 October 2012 For instance, the police have targeted the sellers as much as the purchasers, including evicting them from their homes, so-called Operasjon Husl√∏s, and the law has been enforced patchily from region to region. Other reports suggest that despite some initial decline in street prostitution when the new law was introduced, the number of people selling sex is now greater than ever. Norwegians were also interested in a report released in July 2010 in Sweden, since it suggested a large increase in prostitution in neighbouring Nordic countries, once the Swedish law came into effect. It has also been suggested that the law has led to an unfair discrimination against immigrant women. An evaluation of the law was published in August 2014. (see Evaluation)  Evaluation (Evaluering) 2014 In 2013, prior to the elections, the Justice Ministry announced plans to evaluate the law, with applications to contract closing at the end of August, being awarded to Vista Analyse. However, researchers have criticised this because neither the budget nor the scope seem likely to provide useful answers.Anette Brunovskis and May- Len Skilbrei. Lack of will to knowledge about prostitution? FAFO, October 2013 The evaluation was not expected to add much new to what was already known. = Findings = The reportIngeborg Rasmussen, Steinar Str√∏m, Sidsel Sverdrup og Vibeke W√∏ien Hansen. Evaluering av forbudet mot kj√∏p av seksuelle tjenester. Vista Analyse 2014 English language summary pages 11-14 was released on 11 August 2014. It stated that the law had met its mandate, and that the street market had been reduced, and probably also the indoor market, but that this was more difficult to estimate: > Main findings. > The ban on purchasing sexual services has reduced demand for sex and thus > contribute to reduce the extent of prostitution in Norway. The enforcement > of the law, in combination with the laws against trafficking and pimping, > makes Norway a less attractive country for prostitution based trafficking > than what would have been the case if the law had not been adopted. > Furthermore, the economic conditions for prostitution in Norway are reduced > following the implementation of the law. These effects are in line with the > intentions of the law and are thus not considered as unintended side > effects. This report does not find any evidence of more violence against > prostitutes after the ban on buying sex entered into force. = Response = Critics argued that while one could show trends in prostitution, it was simplistic to argue that they were a direct result of regulatory change, given the complex social phenomenon and the many forces acting on it. Vidar Brein-Karlsen (FrP), the Justice Secretary, has promised a thorough parliamentary inquiry (stortingsmelding). The conclusions conflict with other studies, and the definition of \\"success\\" has been a subject of debate. The report also states that the it has become much more difficult to be a sex worker in Norway.Kate D'Adamo. Nordic Model Redefines ‚ÄúSuccess‚Äù as No Results, All Collateral Damage. SWOP, 12 August 2014 As with the corresponding Swedish evaluation (performed at ten years), the analysis appeared to be gender blind.  Politics of prostitution  The 2008 sex purchase ban was passed by the centre-left red-green coalition government. At the time of the passage of the purchase law, it was opposed by the centre- right opposition parties in the Storting, including the Conservatives (H√∏yre, H), the Progress Party (Fremskrittspartiet, FrP), and the Liberals (Venstre, V). The bill passed 44 to 28, with the Labour Party (Arbeiderpartiet, A/Ap), Socialist Left (Sosialistisk Venstreparti, SV), Centre (Senterpartiet, Sp), and Christian Democrats (Kristelig Folkeparti, KrF) voting in favour, and the Conservatives, Progress Party, and Liberals voting against. The opposition parties continued to express their objections, according to Conservative MP Bent H√∏ie and Anniken Hauglie, a fellow Conservative and Commissioner for Social Services in Oslo.Opposisjonen vil fjerne sexkj√∏ploven. TV2 Nyheten 5 January 2013 accessed 26 December 2013 Following revelations that selling sex was as prevalent as ever, and that reporters posing as clients were easily able to negotiate transactions, Conservative MP Andr√© Oktay Dahl, deputy chairman of the Standing Committee on Justice (Justiskomiteen), called for a repeal of the law, as did his fellow Progress Party member Ase Michaelsen.  2013 elections  The change of government in the September 2013 election which created a Conservative (48 seats) led coalition with the Progress Party (29 seats) created an opportunity for the laws to be revisited, and the Liberals (9 seats) pressed for reform. H√∏ie has now become the Minister of Health and Care Services. Amongst those continuing to support the law are the Christian Democrats (10 seats), who wish to see the law strengthened. They and the Liberals hold the balance of power in supporting the minority Conservative coalition government. Opposition parties supporting the law include the Labour Party, which holds the greatest number of seats (55), and the Socialist Left (7 seats). Critics of the law include Sveinung Rotevatn (V) and Conservative leader Trond Helleland, as well as the Green (De Gr√∏nne, MDG) (1 seat). Marthe Hammer (SV), leader of her party's women's movement, sees the law as having symbolic value, sending a message that buying sex is unacceptable. However, even the KrF agree the effects of the law should be evaluated. Support is particularly strong amongst the youth wings of the parties. The twelve member Justice Committee is currently chaired by Hadia Tajik (A), a strong supporter of the law, with Anders Bj√∏rnsen Werp (H) and Kjell Ingolf Ropstad (KrF) as deputies. Jan Arild Ellingsen represents Progress on the committee, and is an outspoken critic, as is Ropstad. Werp and Justice Minister Anders Anundsen (FrP) saying only that they will review the evaluation. News from the Nadheim City Mission in July 2014 that the levels of prostitution in Norway had returned to those before the introduction of the law, reignited the debate, with Rotevatn stating that there was a sufficient majority in parliament to rescind the law, and that unless the evaluation produced startlingly positive results, this should now proceed. In November 2013, the Mayor of Oslo, Stian Berger R√∏sland, stated that selling sex was now so prevalent in Oslo that the government should ban the sale as well as purchase of sex. By January 2014, all parties had created platforms around prostitution policy. The law is supported by women's organisations such as the radical feminist Kvinnefronten.Kvinnefronten: Fare- sexkj√∏pslova er truga av h√∏grekreftene! 9 September 2013 Despite political opposition, the law has public support, 65% in January 2014, but at least one newspaper editorial has called for repeal.  2014 Evaluation  Following release of the report in August 2014, there was little evidence of any shift in political positions. While the Ap and SV celebrated, and the KrF warned the government not to change the law, the FrP stated that it changed nothing, while the H want a thorough discussion of this and other studies. The issue has now moved into the area of public and political debate; one of the arguments being whether this is merely a matter of whether morality should be legislated, or whether it is about the protection of the vulnerable. Others, especially the social services, dispute the validity of the numbers used, while Kvinnefronten welcomed the news. A critical analysis by researchers suggests that the process has not advanced knowledge, and that the result is inconclusive.Anette Brunovskis and May-Len Skilbrei. The evaluation of the Sex Purchase Act brings us no closer to a conclusion (Vi vet ikke om loven virker). Aftenposten, 16 August 2014  Advocacy and support  PION (Prostitutes Interest Organisation in Norway) provides support and advocacy for those involved in prostitution in Norway. Other organisations include Nadheim City Mission, a church-based group, and ROSA, an organisation dealing with victims of human trafficking. Pro SentretPro Sentret is a health and social service centre for sex workers, and a national coordination centre for prostitution issues. It was set up by Oslo city, and co-funded by the government, with some private donations. It provides health care, social services, legal assistance, and counselling to sex workers of all genders. It has both a drop-in centre and outreach services. Nationally, it carries out research and education on prostitution, and provides a resource on national and international developments in prostitution. In December 2013, Oslo City Council substantially reduced funding to Pro Sentret.Ulla Edith Bj√∏rndahl. Politikerne svikter de som selger sex. Dagsavisen 20 December 2013  Culture  Christian Krohg: Trett () 1885 from the Albertine series In 1886, Christian Krohg wrote a novel titled Albertine (see illustration above) about a seamstress of that name living in what was then Christiana (Oslo) forced into prostitution by poverty and abuse. Although the book was confiscated, and Krogh was fined, the ensuing debate expedited the abolition of prostitution in Norway. Krohg also executed several paintings on the Albertine theme. Despite this, prostitution was a frequent theme in nineteenth century literature. A Norwegian architect has designed a brothel, as a symbolic gesture.Paal Hagene. A Norwegian Brothel.

J√∂rg Wrachtrup (born 27 December 1961) is a German physicist. He is director of the 3rd Institute of Physics and the Centre for Applied Quantum Technology at Stuttgart University. He is an appointed Max Planck Fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research in Stuttgart. Wrachtrup is a pioneer in solid state quantum physics. Already in his PhD thesis, he carried out the first electron spin resonance experiments on single electron spins.J. Wrachtrup et al. Nature 363 (1993) 244 The work was done in close collaboration with M. Orrit at the CNRS Bordeaux. To achieve the required sensitivity and selectivity, optical excitation of single molecules was combined with spin resonance techniques. This optically detected magnetic resonance is based on spin dependent optical selection rules. An important part of the early work was coherent control. As a result the first coherent experiments on single electron spins and nuclear spins in solids were accomplished. While working at the Chemnitz University of Technology, he headed a research team that has, for the first time, detected the optical as well as spin signal of a single dopant atom in a solid. The particular dopant, was a nitrogen atom joined by a vacancy, the nitrogen-vacancy center (N-V) in diamond.A. Gruber et al. Science 276 (1997) 2012 This pioneering work has created standards for numerous follow-up studies of individual N-V centers aiming at manipulations of individual electron and nuclear spins in solids (quantum computer). In contrast to the earlier studies on single molecules the target spin state in these system is a ground state. This facilitates quantum control as spin relaxation and coherence times turned out to be exceptionally long, even under ambient conditions. In addition the defect center proved to be unconditionally photostable, in contrast to most other single quantum emitters. This discovery is the basis for numerous applications of defects in diamond as single photon source, quantum register and in magnetometry. Wrachtrup has made several pioneering contribution to solid state quantum physics. Most notably this is demonstration of nanoscale quantum sensing of magnetic fields using single defects. His group accomplished spin Hamiltonian engineering to measure electric fields as well as temperature using single defect centers. The first entanglement between single electron and nuclear spins in solids as well as single shot quantum state readout was accomplished by his group. Nanoscale quantum sensors also proved to be capable to detects single electron spins as well as measure nuclear magnetic resonance signals with unprecedented sensitivity and spatial resolution. Wrachtrup received numerous awards for his work, including the Leibniz Prize of the German Science Foundation, the Max Planck award of the Humbold Foundation and the Max Planck Society, the Zeiss Research Award, the Gold Medal of the International Society for Electron Spin Resonance, the Heinrich Hertz Award of the German Physical Socienty. Wrachtrup is continuously listed as Highly Cited Researcher since 2014 and has been appointed as Max Planck Fellow of the Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research as well as member of the Berlin Brandenburg Academy of Science.

He was educated at Eton College and at 18 in 1787 joined the 10th Light Dragoons as a cornet. Due to the system then in place of officers being able to purchase promotions, Lumley rose steadily through the ranks, becoming major in 1793 at the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars. By 1795 Lumley had transferred to the 22nd Dragoons as lieutenant colonel and in 1798 was sent to Ireland to help defeat the United Irishmen forces during the Irish Rebellion of 1798. During this conflict, Lumley used his regiment for patrolling the countryside and on 7 June 1798 was at Antrim when the town was attacked by at least 4,000 rebels led by Henry Joy McCracken. The town was defended by a mixture of regular soldiers, militia and loyalist volunteers who made their stand at Antrim Castle, Lumley commanding the cavalry. The initial rebel attack was beaten back and Lumley's cavalry troops attempted to rout them with a charge whilst the remainder of the garrison retreated into the castle. The cavalry were counter-attacked by pikemen and Lumley severely wounded before reinforcements from Belfast dispersed the United Irishmen. Lumley's charge had given time for the rest of the garrison to escape, the only person of note to lose their life being the magistrate Lord O'Neill. Napoleonic Wars Two years after the rebellion Lumley had recovered from his wounds and led his regiment in General Abercromby's invasion of Egypt in 1801 and helped force the French army there to surrender, although it is not clear which actions he participated in. In 1802 the 22nd Dragoons was disbanded and Lumley moved to the 2nd Regiment of Reserve which he commanded until its disbandment in 1804, when he persuaded over 400 of his men to reenlist. Lumley married Mary Sutherland of Ulverstone in the same year but she died less than three years later. In 1805, Lumley was made a major-general and commanded a brigade stationed in London for a year until volunteering for service in the expedition to South Africa in 1806. Lumley fought at the Battle of Blaauwberg which finalised the British capture of the colony and the following year joined General Whitelocke's force which unilaterally invaded the River Plate. Lumley was engaged during the Battle of Montevideo when the city was captured but was forced to withdraw with the rest of the army when the assault on Buenos Aires failed. Lumley was not deemed responsible for the operation's failure and in 1808 was attached as commander of the light cavalry brigade in a small British army which landed in Sicily and then invaded Italy under Sir John Stuart. The force captured Ischia but could not hold its gains and withdrew late in 1809. Peninsula War Despite the collapse of another expedition, Lumley immediately volunteered for service under Sir Arthur Wellesley in the Peninsula War. He joined the army in 1810 and participated in the campaign culminating in the Second Siege of Badajoz (1811), leading the unsuccessful assault on the San Cristobal bastion of the city. During the opening stages of the Battle of Albuera on 16 May 1811, Lumley replaced Robert Ballard Long in command the Allied cavalry by order of Sir William Beresford because of Long's alleged incompetence, though other reasons were given at the time. During the battle, Lumley's cavalry supported the Allied right after Daniel Hoghton's brigade was destroyed and then supported the flanks of Beresford's main assault in the final stages of the action. A few days later, Lumley was again engaged in a cavalry action at the Battle of Usagre, where two French cavalry regiments were neatly trapped and almost destroyed, but his health was failing and in August 1811 he was invalided home, never to see action again. Later life Lumley spent several years recovering from the ill-health he had suffered from in the Peninsula and became a courtier to the Royal family as a Groom of the Bedchamber in 1812. In 1814 he became a lieutenant general and was appointed Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath the following year after war's end and in 1817 married Mrs Louisa Margaret Cotton, widow of Colonel Lynch Cotton. In 1819, Lumley was made Governor of Bermuda and retained the position until 1825 but departed under a cloud after being convicted in court of illegally interfering in the ecclesiastical matters of the island and fined ¬£1,000 (). During his years of retirement, Lumley was honorary colonel of a string of regiments; 3rd battalion of reserve, Royal West India RangersMemorial 6th Inniskillings Dragoons and the 1st King's Dragoon Guards. He became a Knight Grand Cross in 1831 and was promoted again in 1837 to full general before retiring from all courtier and military duties in 1842. Lumley died in December 1850 without issue in his London townhouse on Grosvenor Square.

It was later incorporated into County Monaghan as the barony of Dartree. History The Dartraighe were an Irish t√∫ath, also known as n-Dartraighi or Dairtre who gave their name to a territory in the western portion of what is now known as County Monaghan. The name means \\"calf-people\\".G.R. Isaac, Varia I. Some Old Irish etymologies, and some conclusions drawn from them, √âriu, vol. 53 (2003), p. 154. Various anglicized forms of the name were used through the years. A segment of its southern region became the Dartrey Estate, owned by Richard Dawson in the 17th century, and known as Dawson's Grove, which is now Dartrey Forest. It includes Inner Lough with its small island - probably an old crannog, which may explain the name Dartraige Coinn innsi (Dartry of the Island Chief), which occurs in the annals, perhaps to distinguish this Dartraige from another centered in Kingdom of Breifne. Dartraighe was listed as part of the federated Kingdom of Airg√≠alla in the Book of Rights, and included there in a poem credited to Ben√©n, son of Sescn√©n, Patrick's cantor, though in its surviving form the composition can be dated to between 901 and 908 AD:The Book of Rights, trans.

In 1297 the sub-chiefs of the Airg√≠alla included the lord of Dartraighe, named as the king's brother Roalbh Mac Mathghamhna.

Built in 1900, it is one of the most flamboyant examples of wooden Romanesque Revival architecture to be found in a small-town setting in the entire state. It was a gift to the town of Dr. Charles M. Cumston, and presently houses the local public library and local theatrical companies. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Description Cumston Hall stands prominently in the village of Monmouth, on the east side of Main Street (Maine State Route 132), opposite its junction with Blue Road. It is a large two-story wood frame structure, with a hip roof, clapboard siding, and granite foundation. A square tower, about in height, projects from the front right corner, rising to a pyramidal roof with small corner turrets. The exterior is festooned with applied woodwork, with grouped round columns supporting an arcaded ground floor. Upper floor windows consists of paired round-arch windows, with a Palladian-style three part window in a gabled projecting section above the main entrance. History Cumston Hall was completed in 1900 and is named in honor of Dr. Charles M. Cumston, a former headmaster at the English High School in Boston, who gave the Romanesque Revival and Queen Anne style building to Monmouth equipped with a library and auditorium. Cumston chose Harry Hayman Cochrane (1860‚Äì1946), a muralist who went to school in Monmouth, to design and decorate it. Cochrane's work is most noted in the cherubic portraits that adorn the ceiling and the intricate hand-molded plaster work that frames the walls, boxes, and proscenium arch of the stage. Today, Cumston Hall is the home of the Cumston Public library, the Theater at Monmouth, Monmouth Community Players, and many local activities. The theatrical productions staged here are a draw for people living outside of Monmouth to come and see this landmark.

The novel is a fictionalized story of Ignaz Semmelweis, an Austrian-Hungarian physician known for his research into puerperal fever and his advances in medical hygiene. The novel includes historical references, and details into Semmelweis' youth and education, as well as his later studies. Synopsis Ignaz Semmelweis is a curious child who often gets in trouble at school for asking too many questions. As a young man, he travels from his native Hungary to Vienna to study medicine, becoming an obstetrician at the Vienna Lying-In (labor and delivery) Hospital. At that time, in the first half of the nineteenth century, European women giving birth are ravaged by puerperal fever, a bacterial infection, before the germ theory of disease or antibiotics were known. The hospital unit operated by the medical school for training physicians had triple the death rate of that of the unit run by the midwives. To find out why, Semmelweis embarks on a painstaking investigation. Without knowing the mechanism at work, he discovers that infection is spread from one patient to another by contact, facilitated by frequent patient exams made by the medical students. Over the resistance and ridicule of the hospital administration and staff, he develops and implements a strict practice of hand washing with disinfectant before every patient contact. This brings the hospital death rate down to practically zero. Even so, the hospital administration and general medical community refuse to adopt Semmelweis‚Äôs ideas or practice. Enraged at the medical establishment‚Äôs failure to save lives by this simple procedure, Semmelweis writes letters to medical journals accusing physicians of being murderers. Eventually, more and more overwrought by his frustration, he becomes unbalanced, passing out handbills in the street telling women to demand of their doctors that they wash their hands, and otherwise behaving so erratically that he is committed to an insane asylum, where because of a cut finger he contracts and dies of the very disease he spent his life fighting. Legacy A legacy of Semmelweis, highlighted in The Cry and the Covenant, is that hand washing, to this day, remains the most effective method of preventing the spread of infection.http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/diseases/washing_hands.htmlhttps://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/ References * 1949 American novels Novels set in Vienna Doubleday (publisher) books Novels set in the 19th century ","title":"The Cry and the Covenant"},{"id":"14461920","text":"The market environment or business environment is a marketing term and refers to factors and forces that affect a firm's ability to build and maintain successful customer relationships. The business environment has been defined as \\"the totality of physical and social factors that are taken directly into consideration in the decision-making behaviour of individuals in the organisation.\\" The three levels of the environment are as follows: # Internal environment ‚Äì the internal elements of the organisation used to create, communicate and deliver market offerings. #External Micro environment ‚Äì small forces external the company that affect its ability to serve its customers. # External Macro environment ‚Äì larger societal forces that affect the survival of the organisation. The analysis of the macro marketing environment is to better understand the environment, adapt to the social environment and change, so as to achieve the purpose of enterprise marketing. * Micro environment The forces close to the company that affects its ability to serve its customers include-the internal environment, suppliers customers, marketing intermediaries, competitors and publics. *Macro environment The larger societal forces that affects the whole micro environment include-the demographic environment, the political environment, the cultural environment, the natural environment, the technological environment and the economic environment. Internal Environment The internal environment \\"consists of those relevant physical and social factors within the boundaries of the organization or specific decision unit that are taken directly into consideration in the decision-making behavior of individuals in that system\\".Duncan, R.B., 1972. Characteristics of organizational environments and perceived environmental uncertainty. Administrative science quarterly, pp.313-327. This includes all departments such as management, finance, research and development, purchasing, Business operations and accounting. Each of these departments influences marketing decisions. For example, research and development have input as to the features a product can perform and accounting approves the financial side of marketing plans and budget in customer dissatisfaction. Marketing managers must watch supply availability and other trends dealing with suppliers to ensure that product will be delivered to customers in the time frame required in order to maintain a strong customer relationship. These internal factors can be controlled by the organization to a certain extent. Internal environmental factors are in control of business organization. External environment The external environment \\"consists of those relevant physical and social factors outside the boundaries of the organization or specific decision unit that are taken directly into consideration.\\" The external environment can be further broken into micro and macro environments. Micro-environment The micro-environment consists of customers, partners, and competitors. The most important aspect of micro- environment is the customer market.Holm, M, Kumar, V & Rohde, C 2012, 'Measuring size 0f profitability in complex environments: an interdisciplinary contingency framework', Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, vol. 40, no. 3, pp. 387-401. There are different types of customer markets include consumer markets, business markets, government markets, Globalization international markets, and reseller markets. The consumer market is made up of individuals who buy goods and services for their own personal use or use in their household. Business markets include those that buy goods and services for use in producing their own products to sell. This is different from the reseller market which includes non-business activities that purchase goods to resell as is for a profit. These are the same companies mentioned as market intermediaries. The government market consists of government agencies that buy goods to produce public services or transfer goods to others who need them. International markets include buyers in other countries and includes customers from the previous categories. Partners include marketing intermediaries, financiers, and advertising agencies. Marketing intermediaries refers to resellers, physical distribution firms, marketing services agencies, and financial intermediaries. These are the people that help the company promote, sell, and distribute its products to final buyers. Resellers are those that hold and sell the company's product. They match the distribution to the customers and include places such as Wal-Mart, Target, and Best Buy. Physical distribution firms are places such as warehouses that store and transport the company's product from its origin to its destination. Marketing services agencies are companies that offer services such as conducting marketing research, advertising, and consulting. Financial intermediaries are institutions such as banks, credit companies and Insurance companies. Competitors are also a factor in the micro-environment and include companies with similar offerings for goods and services. To remain competitive a company must consider who their biggest competitors are while considering its own size and position in the industry. The company should develop a strategic advantage over their competitors. The final aspect of the microenvironment is public, which is any group that has an interest in or effect on the organization's ability to meet its goals. For example, financial public can hinder a company's ability to obtain funds affecting the level of credit a company has. Media public include newspapers and magazines that can publish articles of interest regarding the company and editorials that may influence customers' opinions. Government public can affect the company by passing legislation and laws that put restrictions on the company's actions. Citizen-action public include environmental groups and minority groups and can question the actions of a company and put them in the public spotlight. Local public are the neighborhood and community organizations and will also question a company's effect on the local area and the level of responsibility of their actions. The general public can affect the company as any change in their attitude, whether positive or negative, can cause sales to go up or down because the general public is often the company's customer base. And finally those who are employed within the company and deal with the organization and construction of the company's product. Macro-environment The macro-environment refers to all forces that are part of the larger society and affect the micro- environment. It includes concepts such as demography, economy, natural forces, technology, politics, and culture. The purpose of analyzing the macro marketing environment is to understand the environment better and to adapt to the social environment and change through the marketing effort of the enterprise to achieve the goal of the enterprise marketing. Factors affecting organization in Macro environment are known as PESTEL, that is: Political, Economical, Social, Technological, Environmental and Legal. Demography refers to studying human populations in terms of size, density, location, age, gender, race, and occupation. This is a very important factor to study for marketers and helps to divide the population into market segments and target markets. An example of demography is classifying groups of people according to the year they were born. These classifications can be referred to as baby boomers, who are born between 1946 and 1964, generation X, who are born between 1965 and 1976, and generation Y, who are born between 1977 and 1994. Each classification has different characteristics and causes they find important. This can be beneficial to a marketer as they can decide who their product would benefit most and tailor their marketing plan to attract that segment. Demography covers many aspects that are important to marketers including family dynamics, geographic shifts, workforce changes, and levels of diversity in any given area. Another aspect of the macro-environment is the economic environment. This refers to the purchasing power of potential customers and the ways in which people spend their money. Within this area are two different economies, subsistence and industrialized. Subsistence economies are based more in agriculture and consume their own industrial output. Industrial economies have markets that are diverse and carry many different types of goods. Each is important to the marketer because each has a highly different spending pattern as well as different distribution of wealth. The natural environment is another important factor of the macro-environment. This includes the natural resources that a company uses as inputs that affects their marketing activities. The concern in this area is the increased pollution, shortages of raw materials and increased governmental intervention. As raw materials become increasingly scarcer, the ability to create a company's product gets much harder. Also, pollution can go as far as negatively affecting a company's reputation if they are known for damaging the environment. The last concern, government intervention can make it increasingly harder for a company to fulfill their goals as requirements get more stringent. The technological environment is perhaps one of the fastest changing factors in the macro-environment. This includes all developments from antibiotics and surgery to nuclear missiles and chemical weapons to automobiles and credit cards. As these markets develop it can create new markets and new uses for products. It also requires a company to stay ahead of others and update their own technology as it becomes outdated. They must stay informed of trends so they can be part of the next big thing, rather than becoming outdated and suffering the consequences financially. In order to understand the different spending patterns, marketers need to also take into consideration about the development of digital technology and its effect on market growth and employment. It is key for a marketer, especially in a digitally-dominated market, to anticipate demand in order to capitalize on potential market growth. Technology has developed to the extent where purchase patterns can be analysed in order to forecast future demand. The political environment includes all laws, government agencies, and groups that influence or limit other organizations and individuals within a society. It is important for marketers to be aware of these restrictions as they can be complex. Some products are regulated by both state and federal laws. There are even restrictions for some products as to who the target market may be, for example, cigarettes should not be marketed to younger children. There are also many restrictions on subliminal messages and monopolies. As laws and regulations change often, this is a very important aspect for a marketer to monitor. As laws and regulations change often, they create barriers that can hugely influence the way in which companies can market their business across the digital community in particular. When conducting business in the United Kingdom, the government is committed to ensuring the best possible platform to start and grow a UK digital business, therefore Internet Governance becomes a vital force in the management and control of the growth of the internet and its usage The final aspect of the macro-environment is the social environment, which consists of institutions and basic values and beliefs of a group of people. These values can also be further categorized into core beliefs, which passed on from generation to generation and very difficult to change, and secondary beliefs, which tend to be easier to influence. As a marketer, it is important to know the difference between the two and to focus your marketing campaign to reflect the values of a target audience. With entering into an age where technology has a key role in the forming of social beliefs and values, cultural diversity has developed within the world of digital communities. (i.e. Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn). These digital communities consist of many groups of demographics that involve different levels of Internet usage and versatile behaviour with online purchasing. When dealing with the marketing environment it is important for a company to become proactive. By doing so, they can create the kind of environment that they will prosper in and can become more efficient by marketing in areas with the greatest customer potential. It is important to place equal emphasis on both the macro and micro environment and to react accordingly to changes within them.Kotler, Phillip and Gary M. Armstrong(2006), Principles of Marketing (Version 12/E). Pearson Education Inc. New Jersey Environmental scanning Environmental scanning is one of the essential components of the global environmental analysis. Environmental monitoring, environmental forecasting and environmental assessment complete the global environmental analysis. The global environment refers to the macro environment which comprises industries, markets, companies, clients and competitors. Consequently, there exist corresponding analyses on the micro-level. Suppliers, customers and competitors representing the micro environment of a company are analyzed within the industry analysis.Dillerup, R., Stoi, R. (2006), \\"Unternehmensf√ºhrung\\",Vahlen, p. 179 et seq.; p. 187 et seq. Environmental scanning can be defined as 'the study and interpretation of the political, economic, social and technological events and trends which influence a business, an industry or even a total market'.Kroon, J. (1995), \\"General Management\\" (2nd Edition), Pearson South Africa, p. 76 The factors which need to be considered for environmental scanning are events, trends, issues and expectations of the different interest groups. Issues are often forerunners of trend breaks. A trend break could be a value shift in society, a technological innovation that might be permanent or a paradigm change. Issues are less deep- seated and can be 'a temporary short-lived reaction to a social phenomenon'. A trend can be defined as an ‚Äòenvironmental phenomenon that has adopted a structural character'. Environmental scanning is an ongoing process and organizations are always refining the way their particular company or business goes through the process. Environmental scanning reinforces productive strategic plans and policies that can be implemented to make the organization get the maximum use of the business environment they are in. Environmental scanning not only helps the business find its strengths in its current environment but it also finds the weakness of competitors, identifies new markets, potential customers and up and coming technological platforms and devices that can be best used to sell/market the product or service. Environmental scanning helps a business improve their decision-making process in times of risk to the external and internal environments the business is in. Process When scanning the environment, the organization need to look at all the influences of the company. The scanning process makes the organization aware of what the business environment is about. It allows the organization to adapt and learn from that environment. When the company responds to an environmental scanning process it allows them to easily respond and react to any changes to both the internal and external business environment. Environmental scanning is a useful tool for strategic management as it helps them to create and develop the aims and objectives of the company which assists with the production of the company or organization. When looking at the weaknesses of the organization's placing in the current business environment a formal environmental scanning is used. A common formal environmental scanning process has five steps. The five steps are fundamental in the achievement of each step and may develop each other in some form: # The first step of the environmental scanning process requires the identification of the needs and the issues that have occurred that caused the organization to decide an environmental scanning is required. Before starting the process there are several factors that need to be considered which include the purpose of the scanning, who will be participating in the processes and the amount of time and the resources that will be allocated for the duration of the scanning process. # The second step of the scanning process is gathering the information. All the needs of the organization are translated into required pieces of information that will be useful in the process. # The third steps analyzing all the information that the business has collected. When analyzing the information organizations are made aware of the trends or issues that the organizations may be influenced by. # The step four of the environmental scanning process is all about the communication of the results obtained in step three. The appropriate decision makers analyze the translated information of the potential effects of the organization. All the information is presented in a simple and concise format # With all the information obtained from steps three and four, step five is all about making informed decisions. Management creates appropriate steps that will position the organization in the current business environment.  Information sources used  The information sources used to gain knowledge and understanding of the current business environment the organization is in can be split into two categories. The external and internal information sources. The external sources aren't always those in a published form and can include verbal sources such as 'word of mouth'. The external information sources includes: * Personal contacts * Journals/magazines * Books * Newspapers * Professional conferences/ meetings * Radio, television and internet * Professional colleagues * Customers * Commercial databases. The internal information is all information that is specific to the organization. This information can be compared with the external sources to get the maximum use out of both types of sources for the organization, internal information includes: * Personal contacts * Internal reports * Conference papers * Internal memoranda * Committees/ meetings * Sales staff * Other managers * Other employees * Internal databases.  Barriers  Environmental scanning isn't always as effective or useful in an organizational setting for several reasons. The volume of the information received through the scanning process can be disadvantageous when attempting to translate and make sense of the information as some information may get overlooked or just missed entirely. Because of the volume of information its hard to decipher what is important or not so management and key information may be missed. Another way vital information can be missed is if the information is unordered and unorganized. Due to ever changing environment all information runs under a time limit of validity. Another barrier to environment scanning is the interpretation of information that has been collected. Undetermined sources can cause confusion and irrelevance to the process. Macro environment There are a number of common approaches how the external factors, which are mentioned in the definition of Kroon and which describe the macro environment, can be identified and examined. These factors indirectly affect the organization but cannot be controlled by it. One approach could be the PEST analysis. PEST stands for political, economic, social and technological. Two more factors, the environmental and legal factor, are defined within the PESTEL analysis (or PESTLE analysis). The segmentation of the macro environment according to the six presented factors of the PESTEL analysis is the starting point of the global environmental analysis. PESTEL analysis The six environmental factors of the PESTEL analysis are the following: =Political factors= The company/organization needs to consider the political environment when creating business strategies. The entire political environment includes looking at government policies and the risk and instability of current political factors. Political risks can include an unexpected loss of ownership due to government takeover (nationalization), or changes in labour laws which might increase the cost of the company's workforce. However often business can anticipate issues by performing a political risk analysis. The political instability can influence the business and the duration of time that business/ organization is profitable. * Taxation Policy * Trade regulations * Governmental stability * Unemployment Policy, etc. *political stability =Economic factors= The economic factors of the business environment are all the variables that impact how the consumer spends their money and the power of that purchase. There are multiple factors that exist at any time. An example of an economic factor is the recent recession influenced people to spend less and save more which has impacted current consumer spending patterns. The economic development of a country Is an important element when scanning the economic environment. Countries are often categorized as either 'developing' or 'developed'. The exchange rate of a country can have an extensive impact on the profitability of a business. Relatively small changes in the exchange rate may be the difference between profit and loss. When promoting, selling a product it is important for an organization to consider the extra financial information including current rates, taxes etc. in the economy of the country. * Interest rate * Inflation rate * Growth in spending power * Rate of people in a pensionable age * Recession or Boom * Customer liquidations *Balances of Sharing =Socio-cultural= The socio-cultural environment looks at the demographic characteristics of the current business environment. It looks at the values, customs and norms of the environment of which a company or organisation is placed. When looking at the socio-cultural environment it is important to consider the social values of the environment. Organizations look at the cultural characteristics of the society and consider all values and customs that are often associated with the culture while they try to market and sell the product or service, such as: * values, beliefs * language * religion * education * literacy * time orientation * lifestyle. =Technological factors= The technological environment is becoming a lot more important in the modern day business environment. New technology produces new opportunities for companies and organizations to create, sell and promote a product. Technology is rapidly growing and forever changing. Telecommunication technology e.g. cellphones and laptops are increasing the opportunity within an organization to promote and sell a product. The internet has made information available to the consumer to easily compare current prices of a product or service with the price of the competitors of the same product or service. The internet has also created more opportunity to market the product or service via the use of social media. * Internet * E-commerce * Social Media * Electronic Media * Research and Development * Rate of technological change. =Environmental factors= The environmental factors of the PESTLE analysis include natural resources that are affected by the processes of selling and marketing products or services. The two main environmental trends that need to be considered when evaluating the natural environment is the increased pollution and growing shortage of raw materials, Government regulations are creating practices that encourage environmental sustainability. A business might for example utilize recyclable and biodegradable packaging, thus making the most of the environmental opportunities to create a sustainable organizational in the current natural environment. * Competitive advantage * Waste disposal * Energy consumption * Pollution monitoring, etc. =Legal factors= The legal environment includes the laws and regulations of a state. The laws and regulations will influence the way in which an organization will market or sell the product and services. The legal factors influence trade agreements between different governments and states. The governments that have a well developed public policy about selling and marketing goods may limit competition and place other obligations on retailers. * Employment law * Health and safety * Product safety * Advertising regulations * Product labeling * Labour laws etc.Jeffs, C. (2008), \\"Strategic Management\\", SAGE Publications Ltd., p. 29 et seq.  SWOT analysis  SWOT or situation analysis is used when without to look at both the internal and external environment. SWOT stands for Strength, Weakness, Opportunity and Threat. The internal factors considered are the strengths and weaknesses where the opportunities and threats are external factors that are all used and considered to help improve the overall decision making process in dynamic strategic situations the business is facing. The strengths are positive characteristics in the internal business environment which can be capitalized on to increase the overall organisations performance. The weakness are factors of the internal environment which may restrict and interfere with the positive organizational performance. The internal environment factors will include finance, production, research, development and marketing. The opportunities include factors of the external environment that act like stepping stones for the organization in order to achieve their current strategic goals. The threats include the factors that have an effect and may interrupt the organization from achieving the goals. Often threats will come out of the external business environment.  Mesoenvironment  The meso-level is settled between the macro- and the micro- level. This field deals with the design of the specific environment of the enterprises. It is of decisive importance that the layout of the physical infrastructure (transport, communication and power distribution systems) and of the sector policies, especially of the education, research and technology policy, are oriented towards competitiveness. In addition, the design of the trade policy and systems of rules (for example: environmental norms and technical safety standards), which contributes to the development of national advantages of competition, is relevant. Like on the micro-level, on the meso-level new patterns of organisation and steering must be developed. The state shall give impulses and mediate between enterprises, associations, science and intermediate institutions. \\"The design of locations becomes like that a continuous process on the basis of the efforts of enterprises, science and state as well as of the determined cooperation of private and public agents\\".

It is a sequel to Warlord of the Air (1971) and followed by The Steel Tsar (1981). This proto-steampunk trilogy is also published as the compilation volume A Nomad of the Time Streams. Plot summary The story of Oswald Bastable's adventures \\"trapped forever in the shifting tides of time\\" is framed with the concept of the book being a long lost manuscript, as related by Moorcock's grandfather. Several years after Bastable disappeared in 1910, the elder Moorcock travels to China in an attempt to track him down, meeting Una Persson of the Jerry Cornelius novels on the way who before disappearing leaves him a manuscript written by Bastable for Moorcock, relating what happened to Bastable after he unexpectedly left the elder Moorcock at the end of Warlord of the Air, probably bound for another alternate 20th century. Bastable's story takes in a post-apocalyptic early twentieth century between 1904 and 1908, where Western Europe and the United States have been devastated by accelerated technological change caused by a prolific Chilean inventor, which led to a prolonged global war causing their reversion to barbarism. By contrast, South Africa, rechristened Bantustan, is ruled by President Mohandas Gandhi, has never had apartheid, and is an oasis of civilisation which stayed out of the conflict being an affluent, technologically advanced nation in this alternate, anti-imperialist twentieth century. To restore civilisation and social order in the afflicted Northern Hemisphere, a 'Black Attila', General Cicero Hood, leads an African army to beneficent if paternalist conquest of Europe and an apocalyptic war against the United States featuring the \\"vast, moving ziggurat of destruction\\" of the title. The historical personage of our world appearing as alternate versions of themselves include: *Mahatma Gandhi is president of the wealthy, Marxist Republic of Bantustan; * Al Capone is a dashing flyer for the Republic of Bantustan (although the novel takes place before the real Capone was 10 years old). * Herbert Hoover is a racist New York City gangster organizing the city's last stand against the black, African-based Ashanti Empire. White Americans have re-introduced African-American slavery as they blame the latter as scapegoats for epidemics that were actually initiated by biological warfare among the perished Western nations; *P. J. Kennedy is an amateur explosives hack which makes him the local mob lord or tribal chief of Wilmington (it is not made clear whether this is Wilmington, New York, Wilmington Township, Lawrence County, Pennsylvania, or Wilmington Township, Mercer County, Pennsylvania or Wilmington, Delaware, only that it is situated between New York City and Washington, D.C.) *Frederic Courtland Penfield, formerly a US diplomat in our world as well as the one Bastable visits, is founder of a new Ku Klux Klan. He also serves as a nominal 'president' over a de facto, skeletal 'United States', in Washington, D.C. The former capital has been surprisingly immune from bombing and missile attack (as the government had fled into subterranean shelters at the beginning of the Great War) which makes up most of his realm. In some editions, the character is renamed \\"Beesley\\", whose description resembles that of Bishop Beesley, a character from the Jerry Cornelius novels. * Paul Robeson is a leader of slaves in Washington, D.C. *Joseph Conrad as submarine captain Joseph Korzeniowski. Major themes Martin Wisse noted that the book \\"is quite obviously a commentary on the 'yellow peril' and 'black peril' novel of the late 19th and early 20th century, with its unthinking racism, love of superweapons and willingness to commit genocide of the 'lesser races'. Here the formula is inverted, and the sympathies of the writer and reader are with Gandhi and the 'Black Attila', shown as a genuinely good man.\\"Martin Wisse's Land Leviathan review They are contrasted with the impoverished, tribalised white supremacists of the devastated former United States, which has reintroduced African American slavery.

Season 1 began in 2003, Tuesdays, 10 p.m. Each episode runs 60 minutes and follows two different couples who plan their weddings in different states and sometimes a destination wedding in a foreign country. Each episode begins with the bride and groom meeting the wedding planner to discuss theme and what plans might already have been made. The episode then chronicles the wedding planner at work, coordinating the details of the pre-wedding festivities, including rehearsal, the actual wedding, and the reception. Each affianced couple have unique requests, from flowers, invitations, placecards, the cake, the wedding venue, and the reception. Some of the wedding planners also specialize in cultural weddings. While the brides are followed to bridal boutiques to pick out the perfect wedding dress, some select two dresses, one for the wedding and one for the reception, to honor special cultural wedding traditions and customs, or simply for a different reception look. The wedding planners help couples, including same-sex couples, explore and celebrate their individuality and personal style, as well as addressing difficult family circumstances. Voice-over narrators have included Shari Albert and Masasa Moyo. Those couples featured on the show usually receive a few nights paid accommodation at a resort or hotel as a wedding gift from the Style Network. Couples can apply on-line for consideration. The Web site also provides a list of wedding planners and budget tips. The show travels to a variety of vendor meetings: dressmakers, florists, reception sites especially.

The task force had orders to join the British Home Fleet at Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands and thereafter assist the Home Fleet in covering Arctic convoys bound for the Soviet Union. With Wilcox aboard Washington, the task force departed Casco Bay, Maine, on 26 March 1942, bound for Scapa Flow.Musicant, pp. 30‚Äì31, 34. Loss at sea On the morning of 27 March 1942, the second day of the voyage, Wilcox appeared unaccompanied and without a coat on Washingtons deck while Task Force 39 was pushing through heavy seas off Sable Island in stormy North Atlantic winter weather. He held a few brief conversations with some of the men on deck before they lost track of his whereabouts. At 10:31, a member of Washingtons crew reported a man overboard at and soon thereafter Tuscaloosa sighted a man struggling in the water and took evasive action to avoid running him down. The task force began a search and rescue operation. Mustering of Washingtons crew found no one missing from the ships company or Wilcoxs staff, and it gradually became apparent that Wilcox himself had gone overboard.Morison, p. 168.Musicant, pp. 34‚Äì37.Jordan, Winston, \\"Man Overboard!\\", Proceedings, December 1987. Wasp launched four SB2U-2 Vindicator dive bombers to assist in the search, one of which crashed astern of Wasp while attempting to land, killing its two-man crew. About 80 minutes after Wilcox went overboard, the destroyer sighted his body floating face down in the rough seas, but the bad weather prevented its recovery, and it was never seen again. Task Force 39 soon suspended its search and resumed its voyage to Scapa Flow.Jordan, Winston, \\"Man Overboard!\\", Proceedings, December 1987. Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships: USS Wilson Board of investigation Immediately after Wilcoxs death, Rear Admiral Robert C. Giffen aboard Wichita took command of Task Force 39. He ordered a board of investigation into the loss of Wilcox to convene aboard Washington on the afternoon of 27 March 1942. It examined 43 witnesses over the next seven days. No one had seen how Wilcox had gone overboard. The heavy seas that morning could simply have swept him overboard, but the board explored other possibilities. Witnesses disagreed on Wilcoxs mental state; there were claims that he seemed sad or nervous on the morning of 27 March and that he had exhibited unstable behavior in recent days, but these were balanced by other witnesses who said he seemed of sound mind and that, although he was known to exhibit eccentricities not common among officers of his grade, his behavior otherwise was not unusual on the morning of his death. One witness believed that Wilcox seemed pale and white during his last few minutes on deck and perhaps was ill, leading to speculation that he may have suffered a heart attack while on deck and fallen overboard.Jordan, Winston, \\"Man Overboard!\\", Proceedings, December 1987. Musicant, p. 37.East Carolina University Joyner Library Collections Guide: Guide to the Joe Warren Stryker papers, 1925‚Äì1978Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships: Tuscaloosa I Many rumors circulated in the aftermath of Wilcoxs death, including that he had been suicidal and had jumped overboard or that someone pushed him overboard, but none of these ideas could be substantiated. When the board concluded its proceedings on 2 April 1942, it found that no one aboard Washington had been negligent in Wilcoxs death and that Wilcox had not died owing to any misconduct of his own.Jordan, Winston, \\"Man Overboard!\\", Proceedings, December 1987. Musicant, p. 37.Frank, Richard B., \\"Picking Winners?\\", Naval History, June 2011. Decades later, a new hypothesis surfaced based on the reports of Wilcox seeming pale and white while on deck on the morning of 27 March, speculating that he may have been seasick and had rushed to the ships side to vomit, but had mistakenly selected an area where lifelines were not rigged, falling overboard as a result.Jordan, Winston, \\"Man Overboard!\\", Proceedings, December 1987.

The same cover image was used for the 1984 reissue of Judas Priest album Rocka Rolla and also the 1989 video game Ballistix.  Plot summary  In a story introduced by the ubiquitous Una Persson (who is also found in other works by Moorcock), the trilogy's hero, Captain Oswald Bastable, finds himself in an alternative twentieth century in which the Confederate States of America won the American Civil War and neither the First World War nor the October Revolution ever occurred. Over the course of the story Oswald witnesses the destruction of Singapore at the hands of the Imperial Japanese Aerial Navy, is imprisoned on Rishiri Island, joins the Russian Imperial Airship Navy and is sent to put down the rebellious Cossacks who follow the theocratic demagogue known as the 'Steel Tsar': Iosif Djugashvili. He also experiences a repeat of events from the first novel as he is assigned to drop an atomic bomb on the anarchist Nestor Makhno and his Black Flag Army, but ultimately this does not happen; the bomb is turned against the Steel Tsar's own forces and Makhno survives.

The trilogy follows the adventures of Edwardian-era British Army Captain Oswald Bastable in alternate versions of the 20th century. Plot Warlord of the Air In the first book, Warlord of the Air, Bastable finds himself transported to an alternate late-20th century Earth where the European powers did not stir each other into a World War and in which the mighty airships of a British Empire on which the sun never sets are threatened by the rise of new and terrible enemies. These enemies turn out to be the colonized peoples trying to break free, supported by anarchist and socialist Western saboteurs opposing their own imperialist societies, and led by a Chinese general whose country is still nominally under Western control and ravaged by civil war. The Land Leviathan In The Land Leviathan, Bastable visits an alternate 1904 in which most of the Western world has been devastated around the turn of the 20th century by a short, yet terrible war fought with futuristic devices and in which also biological weapons were used. In this alternate world, an Afro-American \\"Black Attila\\" is conquering the remnants of the Western nations, destroyed by the wars. The only remaining stable surviving nations, aside from the African-based Ashanti Empire, are an isolationist Australasian- Japanese Federation, which opposes the Ashanti Empire, and the wealthy Marxist Republic of Bantustan, formerly known as South Africa which is led by its Indian-born president Mahatma Gandhi; having never known apartheid or hostilities between the British and the Boers, it is a wealthy, pacifist utopia, in which there is no racial tension. The Steel Tsar In the final book, The Steel Tsar, Bastable witnesses an alternate 1941 where Great Britain and Germany became allies around the turn of the 20th century and thus neither the War of 1914 nor the October Revolution took place. In this world's Russian Empire, a much more stable and democratic nation than the real Russia has ever been, Bastable encounters a terrorist group which seeks to overthrow the Russian government and install a theocracy led by the religious fanatic Iosif Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili. Style and themes In an ironic to postmodernist framework yet strictly writing in the language of a 19th-century adventure romance, Moorcock explores themes of racism, imperialism, socialist and anarchist politics, and the impact of technology in the nascent steampunk genre which this trilogy did much to help develop.

V. Saguisag (, born August 14, 1939 in Mauban, Quezon, Philippines) is a Filipino lawyer and politician. He served as a Filipino Senator from 1987 until 1992. Early life Rene Saguisag was born on August 14, 1939 in Mauban, Quezon, Philippines. Saguisag attended elementary school at Makati Elementary School in 1951. He graduated from Rizal High School in 1955. Saguisag went on to graduate with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1959 from San Beda College. He also later graduated cum laude from San Beda College with a bachelor of laws degree in 1963 and placed 6th in the same year's Bar Examinations. Saguisag also obtained his Master of Laws degree from Harvard Law School in 1968. Martial Law Rene Saguisag practiced law as a prominent human rights lawyer in the Philippines from 1972 to 1986. He was among the opposition figures targeted for arrest by President Ferdinand Marcos' administration upon the declaration of martial law in September 1972, and he spent several months in jail without being charged of a crime. Upon his release from prison, he joined the Free Legal Assistance Group, an organization founded by fellow oppositionist Jose Diokno. Presidential spokesperson After the 1986 EDSA Revolution, he served as a spokesman for then-President-elect Corazon Aquino beginning on January 22, 1986. Philippine Senate Saguisag ran for the Senate of the Philippines in 1987, promising during the campaign that he would only run for one term. He won the election, placing ninth out of twenty-four winning positions. This earned him a six year term along with the other top 12 senatorial winners, and he stayed in the Senate until the end of his promised one term, in 1992. As a senator, Saguisag served as Chairman of the Committee on Ethics and Privileges. He also served on the \\"ad hoc\\" committee on the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant. He was the primary author of the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees (R.A. 6713), co-author of the Ombudsman Act of 1989 (R.A. 6770), and was one of the 16 senators who voted against the extension of the U.S. military bases treaty in 1991.

Post-Senate career Following his departure from the Senate, Saguisag became one of the leading defense lawyers in the corruption trial of former President Joseph Estrada. Before President Estrada stepped down from Malaca√±ang on account of the plunder case filed against him, right after the Philippine Centennial Celebration, Saguisag was appointed by Estrada to head the Ad Hoc and Independent Citizens' Committee (AHICC) with members Atty. Francis Pangilinan, Engr. Fiorello Estuar, USec. Antonio M. Llorente, and Corazon dela Paz. AHICC was created by President Estrada on February 24, 1999 through Administrative Order No. 53 to investigate if there were irregularities that transpired during the preparations and celebrations of Philippine Centennial Anniversary. AHICC found that the bidding for certain centennial projects had been rigged, that certain documents used in the bidding had been falsified, and that certain signatures on documents were forged. 2007 Car crash Rene Saguisag was seriously injured in a car crash on November 8, 2007, in Makati City. A speeding dump truck struck Saguisag's van, killing his wife Dulce Saguisag, a former Secretary of the Department of Social Welfare and Development.

There are growing sex tourism, child prostitution and human trafficking. High rates of unemployment and poverty in Ghana are believed to be causing a growth in the sex industry. Unemployment is a reason teenage workers engage in sex work. A high percentage of sex workers are vulnerable to HIV. Some prostitutes in Ghana are campaigning for the sex trade to be legalised, and discussions have taken place. Ghana's former Prime Minister, Dr Kofi Abrefa Busia, an Oxford sociologist, wrote a thesis on prostitution ‚ÄúReport on a social survey of Sekondi-Takoradi.‚Äú Overview Prostitutes in Ghana are known locally as \\"ashawo\\", \\"toutou\\" (derived from 'two shillings, two pence'; a prostitute who doesn't charge much) or \\"maame-i-dey\\". There are brothels in most Ghana towns, cities and ports. Often these are in makeshift shacks or old warehouses, and some are attached to bars. Prostitutes not working in the brothels are known as either \\"seaters\\" or \\"roamers\\". The seaters work from home, sitting in the doorway and inviting customers in. When they are with a customer they lower a curtain in front of the door. Seaters generally work in one area of town, creating a small red-light district. Generally they are older women or widows. Roamers tend to be younger women and work on the streets, bars and hotels. \\"Pilots\\", often taxi-drivers, work as intermediaries between the women and clients in hotels. They usually get a fee from both parties. They also help the women get into the hotels as most have a no single women rule. Hotel staff may also take bribes to let the women in. The women face occasional violence from the customers, or more commonly refusal to pay. Hotel staff may exploit them. Since oil production started in 2011, prostitution in the port of Takoradi has risen sharply due to the influx of oil workers. UNAIDS estimate there are 52,000 prostitutes in the country. Male prostitution The prevalence of male prostitution in Ghana has slowly risen over the years but not much is said about it because of the form it takes. Male prostitution is predominant in the following areas such as Tesano, Adabraka, Osu, Accra and Paloma in Accra. Male prostitutes go undercover as women because homosexuality is illegal in Ghana as per the constitution. The activities of these prostitutes are most commonly patronized by men in the elite class who have enough resources to be discreet about their sexual activities. This leads to a relevant increase in the price of engaging homosexual prostitutes given the limited supply of these prostitutes. Law enforcement Law enforcement is variable, and there are also occasional crack-downs on prostitutes. Prostitutes are often abused by law enforcement officers. In a survey across 26 town and cities, a third of the prostitutes told of problems with the police. These included intimidation, extortion, threats and raids. Many reported that they had had to have sex with the officers to avoid prosecution. In a 2007 survey of 251 law enforcement agents, 15% admitted they had demanded sex in return for not prosecuting arrested prostitutes. Police and politicians are sometimes bribed or blackmailed to turn a blind eye. Sex tourism Ghana has established itself as a destination for sex tourism from western tourists. This kind of tourism has attracted paedophiles due to the country's lax child protection laws and poor law enforcement. Child prostitution is increasing is a problem with girls being vulnerable and boys to a lesser extent. Sex trafficking Vietnamese prostitutes have been found in Ghana in the coastal cities of Tema and Takoradi. Ghanaian investigative journalist Anas Aremeyaw Anas discovered that the Vietnamese women had been trafficked into Ghana for the purposes of prostitution. The Vietnamese prostitutes had been recruited by a Vietnamese woman named Hanh in July 2013. The price paid by their clients in Ghana was per hour. The prostitutes worked from a brothel in the Jang Mi Guest House in Takoradi. The women's ages ranged from 25 to 35. Women and girls from China, Nigeria, C√¥te d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso are also trafficked into Ghana for prostitution. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Ghana as a 'Tier 2' country.

Description on the back cover The Kingdom of Hibernia had risen from its sleepy emerald isle to befriend the native Redmen of the West, and, with technology brought out of ancient Egyptian lands, had forged a mighty industrial empire. And after generations of development under the Pax Hibernia, the Empire was poised for human-kind's greatest adventure-settling a new world under a distant star. Healer Nolan was a lone male in the traditionally female healing profession and an unbeliever in the religion of the priest-kings of Hibernia. He had to be careful to avoid any trouble that could jeopardize his place among the crew of the starship Aisling Gheal. But the lowly healer was unaware of his part in a subtle struggle for control of the future colony... until he discovered evidence of a plot against the project: a secret plan for the new world that did not include heretics like Nolan. And as betrayal and deceit followed Nolan into the silent depths of space and on to the surface of a raw, untamed planet, he was challenged to become the one thing he had never even dreamed of, a hero.

Lincoln was not yet the Republican nominee for the presidency, as the convention was scheduled for May. It is considered one of his most important speeches. Some historians have argued that the speech was responsible for his victory in the presidential election later that year. In the speech, Lincoln elaborated his views on slavery by affirming that he did not wish it to be expanded into the western territories and claiming that the Founding Fathers would agree with this position. The journalist Robert J. McNamara wrote, \\"Lincoln's Cooper Union speech was one of his longest, at more than 7,000 words. And it is not one of his speeches with passages that are often quoted. Yet, due to the careful research and Lincoln's forceful argument, it was stunningly effective.\\" Horace Greeley's New York Tribune hailed it as \\"one of the most happiest and most convincing political arguments ever made in this City. ... No man ever made such an impression on his first appeal to a New- York audience.\\" Summary Lincoln's speech has three major parts, each building towards his conclusion. The first part concerns the founders and the legal positions they supported on the question of slavery in the territories. The second part is addressed to the voters of the Southern states by clarifying the issues between Republicans and Democrats. He rebukes claims made by the Democrats that they are \\"conservative\\", arguing instead that the Republicans' position on slavery is in fact the \\"conservative\\" policy, as Lincoln claims it coincides with the views of the American founding fathers, who he said opposed slavery. By supporting slavery, Lincoln claims that the Democrats are in opposition to the teachings of the founding fathers and \\"reject, and scout, and spit upon that old policy, and insist upon substituting something new.\\" The final section is addressed to Republicans. In the first section, in response to a statement by Illinois Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, Lincoln asks rhetorically, \\"What is the frame of government under which we live?\\" He answers that it \\"must be: 'The Constitution of the United States. From there, he begins his reasoning on why the federal government can regulate slavery in the federal territories (but not states), especially resting on the character of the founders, and how they thought of slavery: In the second part, in which he uses the prosopopoeia of a mock debate between Republicans and the South,Michael C. Leff and Gerald P. Mohrmann, \\"Lincoln at Cooper Union: A Rhetorical Analysis of the Text\\", rpt. in Readings in Rhetorical Criticism, 4th ed., Carl R. Burgchardt, Ed., State College, Pennsylvania: Strata, 2010, p. 166. Lincoln denies that Republicans are a \\"sectional\\" party, representing only the North and helping to incite slave rebellions. He rebukes the Southern Democrats' accusation that Republicans helped John Brown by saying, \\"John Brown was no Republican; and you have failed to implicate a single Republican in his Harper's Ferry enterprise.\\" He addressed the single-mindedness of the Southern Democrats: He also tried to show that the Southern Democrats' demand to secede from the Union if a Republican were to be elected president was like armed robbery: \\"the threat of destruction to the Union, to extort my vote, can scarcely be distinguished in principle\\" from that of a robber. The third section, addressed to fellow Republicans, encourages level-headed thinking and cool actions, doing \\"nothing through passion and ill temper\\": Lincoln states that the only thing that will convince the Southerners is to \\"cease to call slavery wrong, and join them in calling it right\\", supporting all their runaway slave laws and the expansion of slavery. He ends by saying that Republicans, if they cannot end slavery where it exists, must fight through their votes to prevent its expansion. He ends with a call to duty: Key excerpts Section addressed to \\"Mr. President and fellow citizens of New York\\" Section addressed \\"to the Southern people\\" Section addressed \\"to Republicans\\" Legacy The Cooper Union (2007) Lincoln scholar Harold Holzer called the Cooper Union address \\"Lincoln's watershed, the event that transformed him from a regional leader into a national phenomenon. Here the politician known as frontier debater and chronic jokester introduced a new oratorical style: informed by history, suffused with moral certainty, and marked by lawyerly precision.\\" Holzer wrote about Lincoln's speech in New York City: Writing about his visit to Lincoln's speech place at Cooper Union and the meaning of this place for Lincoln's career and legacy, Holzer states that \\"only at the Great Hall of Cooper Union can audiences so easily inhale Lincoln's presence too‚Äîthere to imagine not the dying but the living man, not the bearded icon of myth but the clean-shaven, fresh-voiced political original who conquered all New York here on the way to the White House and immortality.\\" References External links * Full text of the speech * Summary of Lincoln's Arguments at Cooper Union * Recording of the speech from eJunto.com * Text of the speech from American Rhetoric.com * Recording of the speech performed by Sam Waterston 1860 in politics 1860 in the United States 1860 speeches Speeches by Abraham Lincoln Cooper Union 1860 in New York (state) February 1860 events ","title":"Cooper Union speech"},{"id":"14462282","text":"The Conquest of the Pole () is a 1912 French silent film directed by and starring Georges M√©li√®s. The film, loosely inspired by contemporary events and by Jules Verne's Voyages Extraordinaires, follows the comic misadventures of an international group of explorers on an expedition to the North Pole, where they encounter a man-eating frost giant and a dangerous magnetic needle. The film, one of M√©li√®s's last cinematic works, was released by Path√© Fr√®res to critical acclaim in France and England, but was a box-office failure and contributed to M√©li√®s's mounting financial difficulties. It continues to be seen as one of his masterpieces and is sometimes named as his greatest work. Plot The Giant of the Snows attacks the explorers At an International Congress at an Aero Club, explorers from around the world argue about the best way to fly to the North Pole. All are in disagreement until the congress's president, the engineer Maboul of France, explains his plans for an \\"Aero- Bus,\\" an airplane with a passenger car and a huge figurehead in the shape of a bird head. The proceedings are interrupted by a group of militant suffragettes, who announce their intention to go to the Pole themselves. When they have been chased off, the Congress nominates an international group of experts to accompany Maboul to the Pole: Run-Ever of England, Bluff-\\"Allo\\"-Bill of America, Choukroutman of Germany, Cerveza of Spain, Tching-Tchun of China, and Ka-Ko-Ku of Japan. Maboul takes his colleagues to his office to study the model of his invention, and then to the electricity- powered factory where the real thing is being constructed. The leader of the suffragettes moves on with her own plans to get to the Pole, building a machine fitted with propellers and a multitude of toy balloons, but it fails to get off the ground. The completed Aero-Bus lifts off to great acclaim, though it meets with two difficulties; first the suffragette leader tries to board with the expedition at the last moment, and then the explorer Tching- Tchun, arriving late, is accidentally left behind. The race to the Pole attracts many other adventurers, who depart in their own machines; soon the sky is full of aircraft of every shape and size. Both Tching-Tchun and the suffragette leader attempt to make it to the Pole in a balloon, but again meet with failure. (The explorer falls a short distance to the ground and gives up; the suffragette, having held on longer, falls onto a church steeple and explodes.) Meanwhile, the Aero-Bus continues through the sky unimpeded, passing various planets and constellations. The aircraft skims down over the ice of the Arctic and finally crash-lands. The delegates make it out of the wreck, safe and sound. Almost immediately, however, they run into an obstacle: the Giant of the Snows, a pipe-smoking, man-eating frost giant who has to be scared off with cannon fire. They come at last to the pole proper, where they find a huge magnetic needle. Stuck by magnetic attraction to the needle, which breaks under their weight and plunges them into the icy waters, they signal for help and are picked up by a passing airship. Penguins, seals, and Arctic birds wave goodbye. The explorers return in triumph to the Aero Club, where they bow to all assembled. Inspirations Hand-colored photograph of Peary's team at the North Pole Although the film's story is treated in a vein of fantasy, it took much of its inspiration from current affairs. Robert E. Peary and his team had set foot on the North Pole on 6 April 1909, and Roald Amundsen had made it to the South Pole on 14 December 1911, four months before M√©li√®s started filming. The claims of the rival explorer Frederick Cook, who tried unsuccessfully to prove that he had beaten Peary to the North Pole, were also a thematic inspiration. M√©li√®s later recalled: The presence of suffragettes in the film was another nod to recent events; the women's suffrage movement was highly present in the news at the time, and would remain a contemporary issue in France until the Second World War, when women were granted the right to vote. (Indeed, the leader of the suffragettes was conceived as a caricature of the well-known British suffrage campaigner Emmeline Pankhurst.) Even the scene in which a suffragette attempts to join the aviation race was topical in France; Th√©r√®se Peltier had recently made headlines as the first woman aviator to fly solo, and Raymonde de Laroche became the first woman in the world to receive an airplane pilot's licence in 1910. Although many contemporary write-ups about the film suggested a connection with Jules Verne's works (see the Release and reception section below), the film is not an adaptation of any of his famous Voyages Extraordinaires novels; rather, it is a parodic, satiric homage to the entire Voyages Extraordinaires series, in something of the same style as Albert Robida's Verne-spoofing comic novel Voyages tr√®s extraordinaires de Saturnin Farandoul (1879‚Äì1880). If anything, the film may be said to be inspired very loosely by Verne's The Adventures of Captain Hatteras or his The Sphinx of the Ice Fields. Other possible sources came from the theatre and the cinema. Pif Paf Pouf, a spectacular f√©erie staged in 1906 at the Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet, included a Giant of the Pole operated by wires as well as a powerful magnet at the Pole, two elements borrowed for the film. The eleven-scene film Voyage of the Arctic, or How Captain Kettle Discovered the North Pole, directed by the pioneering British filmmaker Robert W. Paul in 1903, features a Polar giant, strongly suggesting a direct influence on M√©li√®s. M√©li√®s may also have remembered that the Lumi√®re Brothers had filmed a staged reenactment of Polar exploration, The Explorer Andr√©e at the North Pole, in 1897. Production Georges M√©li√®s Georges M√©li√®s is widely regarded as the first person to recognize the potential of narrative film, and his A Trip to the Moon (1902), The Kingdom of the Fairies (1903), and The Impossible Voyage (1904) were among the most popular films of the first few years of the twentieth century. However, by the time of The Conquest of the Pole his fortunes were in decline. In 1911, M√©li√®s entered into a deal in which the Path√© Fr√®res company became the sole distributor of his films. Though they continued to be filmed at M√©li√®s's Star Film Company studio in Paris, Charles Path√© had executive control over the films, including power to edit their structure and length. All of M√©li√®s's films from 1911 onward, including The Conquest of the Pole, were therefore made under Path√©'s supervision and released by his company. The Conquest of the Pole is M√©li√®s's longest cinematic work: 650 meters of film, which, at his preferred projection speed of 12 to 14 frames per second, is about 44 minutes.Frame rate calculations produced using the following formula: 845 feet / ((n frame/s * 60 seconds) / 16 frames per foot) = x. See . It was also the last of M√©li√®s's \\"journey\\" films, a genre that comprises some of his most significant works, such as A Trip to the Moon and The Impossible Voyage. The film was made by M√©li√®s in the winter of 1911‚Äì1912, with M√©li√®s himself taking on the lead role of Professor Maboul. (M√©li√®s also appears briefly in a second role in the balloon ascension scene, as one of the workers holding the balloon.) Fernande Albany, who had previously appeared in M√©li√®s's films The Impossible Voyage, An Adventurous Automobile Trip, and Tunnelling the English Channel, played the leader of the suffragettes. During his career, M√©li√®s had built two glass-and-metal film studios in Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis. The first one was relatively small, with a stage measuring 16 by 13 feet. The second one, Studio B, was built in 1905 with considerably larger dimensions, including a stage about thirty feet wide and an elevator crane allowing large objects to be carried up and down. The Conquest of the Pole took full advantage of Studio B's facilities, especially for the scene with the Giant of the Snows. However, like a few other scenes in M√©li√®s's works, the parade of vehicles was filmed outdoors. M√©li√®s created the film's special effects using a wide array of techniques, including stage machinery, pyrotechnics, scenery rolling horizontally and vertically, miniature models, real water, substitution splices, and superimpositions. The Giant of the Snows was a gigantic marionette which required twelve men to operate. Its head alone was two meters high; two of the puppeteers hid inside the head to control the Giant's eyes, ears, mouth, and pipe. Most of the film is shot in M√©li√®s's usual style, in which a stationary camera allows the viewer to watch the film as if it were being played in scenes on a theatre stage. However, the scene in which the airplane lands in the Arctic is notable for an advanced editing technique in which the point of view becomes mobile rather than stationary. First, the plane is first seen coming directly toward the camera; then, in the next shot, the motion of the plane continues seamlessly, but the viewpoint has been rotated ninety degrees. In previous films, M√©li√®s had sometimes used nonlinear editing for such moments, such as in A Trip to the Moon and The Impossible Voyage, in which the space capsule and dirigible, respectively, are shown landing twice. This scene in The Conquest of the Pole marks the first time M√©li√®s fluently uses the mobile point of view, which had been pioneered by the \\"Brighton School\\" of filmmakers in England. However, M√©li√®s revealed in 1929 that he had never found mobile techniques to be natural or particularly useful and that he still preferred the stationary camera techniques he had used. Release and reception A poster for the film, emphasizing the connection to Jules Verne's works The Conquest of the Pole was released by Path√© on 3 May 1912. The film was advertised as a voyage extraordinaire en 34 tableaux, and announcements and reports about it frequently suggested a connection to Verne's Voyages Extraordinaires series; for example, Path√©'s weekly bulletin promoted the film by saying that \\"There isn't one of [M√©li√®s's] works that hasn't achieved the success, the vogue, and the popularity of a Jules Verne novel.\\" In France, the weekly Le Cin√©ma gave the film a highly favorable review, calling it \\"a masterpiece from the Jules Verne of the film camera.\\" The British journal Bioscope described the film as an \\"extraordinary voyage,\\" calling M√©li√®s \\"the H. G. Wells of picturedom, the wizard who gives the fillip to our imagination, and provides us with scientific phenomena of his own making.\\" The film was a marked failure with contemporary audiences, who almost completely ignored it. The film's failure is usually attributed to changing times; M√©li√®s's theatrical, fantasy-based style, which had been innovative and influential early on in his career, had fallen out of popularity by 1912. The film critic and historian Georges Sadoul, who called the film \\"perhaps [M√©li√®s's] most perfect creation,\\" elaborated on this point: M√©li√®s's deal with Path√© put the Star Film studio even further into debt than it had been before. The six works M√©li√®s made under Path√©'s supervision in 1911 and 1912 were his last films. The Conquest of the Pole is generally considered to be one of M√©li√®s's greatest films, and some critics have described it as his very best work.

Glaucus was assigned to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, but before assuming her duties she was chosen to transport Senor Manuel Murillo, newly elected President of Colombia, to Cartagena. She departed 5 March from New York and arrived Cartagena 16 March. Returning to Beaufort, North Carolina, 3 May 1864, Glaucus took up blockading station off Cape Fear River. On 28 May, while pursuing a blockade runner off the Western Bar, Glaucus caught fire and was nearly destroyed. The crew managed to control the flames, however; and she proceeded to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for repairs, arriving 9 June 1864 and decommissioning 11 June. Repaired and recommissioned 22 August 1864, she broke down on her way to New York City, and had to again undergo extensive repairs. Sailing to join the West India Convoy Fleet, she grounded near Molasses Reef in the Bahamas, and had to be towed 30 May 1865. She was decommissioned 6 June 1865. Post war After the end of the Civil War she was sold at auction 12 June 1865 to John Henderson of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, who was bidding for a mail service running between Baltimore and Liverpool. The railroad owned the Baltimore & Liverpool Steamship Co. under whose flag she operated. The Railroad bought 4 ships from the Navy; she was renamed Worcester. The other three vessels were the Allegany, the Carroll, and the Somerset; the Railroad decided to retain or change the names to Maryland counties. The vessels were originally built for coastal use, however the new owner set out to use them for carrying freight and mails on the transatlantic routes. On 29 November 1865 she sailed on her maiden voyage from Baltimore for Liverpool returning to Baltimore with engine trouble. On 23 December 1865 on her next attempt she completed the round voyage to Liverpool. On 29 May 1867 sailing from Liverpool she lost her propeller, and had to return to Queenstown (Cobh) necessitating on 4 June being towed to Liverpool for repairs. The last Baltimore - Liverpool - Baltimore run started on 15 September 1868 and the service was then closed down, the Worcester having made 12 round-trip voyages. During the winter of 1868-9 she operated between Baltimore and New York and was then laid up. In 1873 she was sold to Boston owners and sailed between Boston, Halifax and Prince Edward Island, before being scrapped at Boston, Massachusetts, in 1894.

More than 67,000 people are buried there, including 1,000 veterans. Location and operation Riverside Cemetery occupies a site between Brighton Boulevard and the east bank of the South Platte River, approximately 4 miles down stream from downtown Denver, Colorado. The majority of Riverside Cemetery lies within Adams County, Colorado, however the rest of the cemetery, the cemetery's original entrance and administration building, are within the City and County of Denver. Riverside Cemetery originally was the property of the Riverside Cemetery Association from its founding in 1876 until 1900 when the association's assets were transferred to the Fairmount Cemetery Association (presently known as Fairmount Cemetery Company). In late 2000, Fairmount Cemetery Company along with members of the community founded the Fairmount Heritage Foundation to be an educational resource for the community and to protect and preserve the heritage of both the company's properties: Riverside Cemetery and Fairmount Cemetery. The volunteers of the foundation staff the Riverside Cemetery Office on Tuesdays,Thursdays, Fridays (during the summer months) and Saturdays. They have numerous events and preservation and cleanup projects for the cemetery. Information may be found at www.fairmountheritagefoundation.org History When first opened, the graveyard's secluded location on the banks of the South Platte River and the surrounding greenery made it a popular choice for wealthy families; the opening of the Burlington Railroad in the 1890s changed this, spurring industrial growth in the neighborhood, and some families chose to have their relatives' remains exhumed and reburied elsewhere. Prominent people continued to be interred there, with ornate headstones to mark their graves; however, the proportion of unmarked graves rose dramatically, as counties from all over the state sent the bodies of their impoverished dead citizens there. Riverside remained the area's most significant cemetery until the mid-20th century, and retains importance for scholars studying in the early history of Denver, as the city kept no systematic death records until 1910. Today, the neighborhood has become a largely industrial area, surrounded by a gas station, smokestacks, train tracks, and an industrial park, a few blocks from Interstate 70. It remains a minor tourist attraction; in 2001, 3,000 people went on walking tours of the site. The cemetery office, c. 1935 The cemetery's final grave site was assigned in July 2005; the management company, Fairmount Cemetery Inc., indicated that they would not accept further burials after that, because they were losing money on each sale. They have also stopped watering and cut back drastically on services, claiming that their $2.1 million endowment, which generated roughly $62,000 per year in interest, was not enough to water the property and properly maintain all the graves; their records show that they lost $159,000 in 2003. They still employ two groundskeepers to pick up trash, but have had to refuse offers of maintenance help from volunteers due to liability issues. In 2005, Fairmount approached the city government and requested they take over operation of the cemetery; however, the city was forced to decline due to lack of funds. Local residents, concerned by the dying trees and grass and generally poor state of the cemetery, formed a group, Friends of Historic Riverside Cemetery, to bring public attention to the issue. They requested the assistance of a Holy Transfiguration Orthodox Cathedral whose founders are buried there; Fairmount indicated that they would be willing to transfer the endowment and operations of the cemetery to a group that could provide an additional trust of $1 million to cover operating expenses.

W. Wilson providing the naval chapters). It is one of the most famous examples of invasion literature. It is viewed by some as an example of pre- World War I Germanophobia. It can also be viewed as prescient, as it preached the need to prepare for war with Germany. Background The novel was originally commissioned by Alfred Harmsworth as a serial which appeared in the Daily Mail from 10 March 1906. According to historian of Germany Sir Richard Evans, the paper built up \\"mass alarm\\" by dressing its London newspaper vendors as Prussian soldiers complete with pickelhaube helmet and placards showing maps of where the 'troops' would be next day. The rewrite of the story, featuring towns and villages with large readership of the Daily Mail, greatly increased the newspaper's circulation and made a small fortune for Le Queux; it was translated into twenty-seven languages, and over one million copies of the book edition were sold. The idea for the novel is alleged to have originated from Field Marshal Earl Roberts, who regularly lectured English schoolboys on the need to prepare for war. To Le Queux's dismay, a pirated and abridged German translation (with an altered ending) appeared the same year: Die Invasion von 1910: Einfall der Deutschen in England translated by Traugott Tamm. In Le Queux's earlier novel, The Great War in England in 1897, it is France which invades Britain as an implacable enemy. In that book's plot, German soldiers land in Britain as allies coming to help repulse the French invasion, and are welcomed as saviours. In between Le Queux's two disparate depictions of an invaded Britain, the Entente Cordiale of 1904 changed the diplomatic and military landscape. Outline The book takes the form of a military history and includes excerpts from the characters' journals and letters and descriptions of the fictional German campaign itself. It is centred on an invasion by the Germans, who have managed to land a sizeable invasion force on the East Coast of England. They advance inland, cutting all telegraph lines and despoiling farmland as they go, and the British struggle to mount a proper defence, fighting a battle at Royston. The Germans eventually reach London and occupy half the city. A junior Member of Parliament declares that \\"Britain is not defeated\\" and organises a resistance movement, the \\"League of Defenders,\\" despite harsh reprisals by the Germans and a severe lack of arms. The Germans seem unable to combat this and tighten their control of London and suddenly find themselves faced with a popular uprising. Eventually, a newly formed British Army marches to liberate London. The fictional war, however, is a stalemate since it appears that German forces have managed to occupy Belgium and the Netherlands. Agenda The failure of the British government to prepare for a possible invasion is repeatedly mentioned, as is the phrase \\"they should have listened to Lord Roberts\\", along with many references to Roberts' patriotism. It is also pointed out that the invasion might have been counteracted more easily if every able-bodied man had had military training. Le Queux himself stated that one of his aims was to \\"bring home to the British public vividly and forcibly what really would occur were an enemy suddenly to appear in our midst\\". Film version Le Queux's novel attracted the attention of the Gaumont Cinematograph Company in 1912, who planned to change the title to The Raid of 1915 and to film two endings, one with Britain as the victor and one with Germany as the victor. The British satirical magazine Punch suggested they show the Britain victorious version in Germany and the other version in Britain. The film was finished in 1913 but its release was delayed by the British Board of Film Censors and when it was finally released in October 1914 (three months after the start of World War I), it had again been retitled, to If England were Invaded.

The settlement is located on Tondern Island which, though a true island, is attached to the mainland by a small bridge at Milford Bay. Currently the settlement sports a government pier, The Beaumaris Marina, a general store dubbed Willmotts Store after a prominent Beaumaris family, Saint John's Anglican Church, and a private summer club; the Beaumaris Yacht Club. History First Nations Geography drove history in the Muskoka region. Studded with lakes and abundant with rocks the land offered an abundance of fishing, hunting, and trapping, but was poorly suited to farming. Largely the land of the Ojibwa people, European inhabitants ignored it while settling the more promising area south of the Severn River. The Ojibwa leader associated with the area was Mesqua Ukie for whom the land was probably named. The tribe lived south of the region, near present-day Orillia and used Muskoka as their hunting grounds. Another Ojibwa tribe lived in the area of Port Carling which was called Obajewanung. The tribe moved to Parry Sound around 1866. European arrival Largely unsettled until the late 1760s the European presence in the region was largely limited to seasonal fur trapping, but no significant trading settlements were established. Canadian government interest increased following the American Revolution when, fearing invasion from its new neighbor to the south the government began exploring the region in hopes of finding travel lanes between Lake Ontario and Georgian BayAhlbrandt p 16 In 1826 Lieutenant Henry Briscoe became the first white man known to have crossed the middle of Muskoka. David Thompson drew the first maps of the area in 1837 and possibly camped near present-day Beaumaris. Canada experienced heavy European immigration in the mid-19th century, especially from Ireland which experienced famine in the 1840s. As the land south of the Severn was settled, the government planned to open the Muskoka region further north to settlement. Logging licenses were issued in 1866 which opened Monck Township to logging. The lumber industry expanded rapidly denuding huge tracts of the area, but also prompting the development of road and water transportation. The railroad pushed north to support the industry, reaching Gravenhurst in 1875 and Bracebridge in 1885. Road transportation took the form of the Muskoka Colonization Road, begun in 1858 and reaching Bracebridge in 1861. The road was roughly hewn from the woods and was of corduroy construction, meaning logs were placed perpendicular to the route of travel to keep carriages from sinking in the mud and swamps. Needless to say this made for extremely rugged travel. The lumbering industry spawned a number of ancillary developments, including as mentioned, transport, but also settlements began springing up to supply the workers and Bracebridge, (formerly North Falls) saw some leather tanning businesses develop. Tanners used the bark from lumber to tan hides thereby using what otherwise would be a waste product. Purchase of Tondern Island The passages of the Free Grants and Homestead Act of 1868 brought opened the era of widespread settlement to Muskoka. This was the year an Irish immigrant from Enniskillen named Paul Dane purchased Tondern Island for $101 from the crown.Ahlbrandt p 23 The island comprises and is the home of present- day Beaumaris. Dane named the island after the Battle of Tondern between the Prussians and Denmark. Ownership of the island passed to Dane's nephew Maurice John McCarthy when Dane died in 1871. The only structure on the island at that time was a log house known as the \\"big white house\\" on the site of the future Beaumaris Hotel (now the Beaumaris Golf Club). Founding of Beaumaris In 1873 McCarthy sold the island to Edward Prowse and John Harry Willmott for $1,560. The two divided the island in half with Willmott taking the northern and Prowse the southern half. The new owners named the settlement Beaumaris after the resort in Anglesey, Wales where they had vacationed. Prowse settled in the big white house while Willmott built a log house next to the site of the present day Willmott store. They cleared part of the land for pasture, built a dock for the newly arrived steamships and connected the island to the mainland by a small log bridge. As word of the excellent fishing, natural beauty, and an air completely free of ragweed providing relief for hay fever sufferers spread, tourists came to the area. Willmott responded by building a general store in Beaumaris selling everything from foodstuffs to construction materials. Early tourists built camps around the lake, but were joined by others desiring better accommodations. The first wilderness hotel was built at the head of Lake Rosseau in 1870, called Rosseau House. It was owned by New Yorker W.H. Pratt. Prowse saw success with his hotel due to Beaumaris' central location, approximately halfway between Bracebridge and Port Carling and the fine pier he had constructed near the hotel. Trains regularly made the run from Toronto to Gravenhurst where travelers and their luggage were transferred to the great steamers of the Muskoka Navigation Co such as the Sagamo. Making regular stops up the lakes, including Bracebridge, Beaumaris, and Port Carling, tourists there could transfer to smaller ships such as the Islander which could reach into smaller ports. Beaumaris became an important transfer point which brought business to the hotel and store. As the area developed it began to lose some of the wilderness qualities which initially led some of the early groups of campers to establish fishing camps in Beaumaris; Solid Comfort Camp and the Sharon Social Fishing Club. The Sharon Social Fishing Club was founded in 1891 by individuals living in Sharon, Pennsylvania, U.S.A. It is still in existence. Members of the Solid Comfort Camp departed for a more rustic site on the French River. Meanwhile, Willmott and Prowse mapped out lots which they intended to sell to vacationers seeking more permanent residence than the hotel. Beaumaris Hotel Advertisement for the Beaumaris Hotel circa 1905 The hotels became the centers of vacationers lives which could stretch for weeks or even months in the summer. As families became seasonally established, they began building cottages near the hotels; at first simple affairs replicating the rustic environment of the early camps, but later grander including in some cases housing for significant staff. Initially cottagers relied on rowboats and canoes for daily transport and would sometimes row substantial distances. Eventually the era of the steam and gasoline launch came and people relied less on muscle power and more on motors. With the boats came the boathouses, often elaborate structures in their own right mimicking in many cases the look and feel of the main cottage. The Beaumaris Hotel enjoyed a commanding view of the lake and grew to accommodate 200 guests. It was long, 3 stories high, and had a wing. A verandah surrounded the structure providing a comfortable place for guests to relax. The hotel offered a full program of entertainment, including live music and dances, and had a large restaurant. Beaumaris Golf and Yacht Clubs Beaumaris Government Pier circa 1910 with the Beaumaris Hotel and the Beaumaris Yacht Club in the background Beaumaris harbor with the cottage \\"Grumblenot\\", precursor to the Beaumaris Yacht Club in the background, circa 1903 In 1911 a number of cottagers formed the Beaumaris Golf and Tennis Association which leased the tennis courts and 5 hole golf course from the hotel. The Association enlarged the golf course to 9 holes and in 1919 expanded it to today's 18 holes. They built a clubhouse on the golf course and invited cottager to join. Reflecting the heavily American presence in the area, in 1921 only 3 of the 48 members of the association were Canadian.Ahlbrandt p 93 The Beaumaris Yacht Club was started in 1912 by James Francis Burke and American congressman to foster sailing in the area and to provide what was considered to be a more wholesome environment for children than the hotel's activities offer. In 1921 the Yacht Club purchased its present location, the Gill's cottages called the Grumblenot. The coming of the car World War I caused a significant dip in the tourist activity for the area and hence the economy. After the war, however, significant advances in the automobile brought demand for improved (paved) roads. These two developments, motorboats and private cars brought greater overall development of the area and spread development out over the lakes. Freed from the ports of call of the steamships, people built cottages farther afield. Demand began dropping for the steamship lines. World War II caused another decline as wartime shortages kept many Americans at home and many Canadians were engaged in war activities. Postwar prosperity brought another boom based around the automobile and the newly affordable fiberglass boat. Suddenly owning a summer cottage became possible not only for the adventurous or the wealthy, but for many in the middle class. The steamship companies retired their boats one by one until the last sailing in the late 1950s. The end of the old era for Beaumaris came on 21 July 1945 when, from a small fire in the kitchen, the Beaumaris Hotel was engulfed in flames and burned to the ground. Edward John Van Buren, an employee of the hotel, pleaded guilty to arson and was sentenced to 2 years for the crime.Ahlbrandt p 127 The land under the hotel was eventually purchased by the Beaumaris Land Company which also owned the physical property for the golf and yacht clubs. After several attempts to attract a new hotel to the site, it was eventually turned over to the new golf clubhouse.

The UPA was composed mostly of former soldiers in the special forces of the Uganda National Liberation Army and opposed the National Resistance Army (NRA) government of Yoweri Museveni, who took power in January 1986. Reaching a height after the widespread cattle raid by Karamojong in 1987, the UPA rebellion was eventually ended through the mediation of the Teso Commission.  Origin  In the 1970s, President Idi Amin Dada created Iteso Home Guard units specifically to protect the region from raids by Karamojong cattle rustlers. The Home Guards proved to be highly effective and, following Amin's overthrow, was retained as people's militia.\\" In the 1980-1986 Bush War Iteso militia on occasion fought the rebel National Resistance Army of Yoweri Museveni alongside units of the regular Uganda National Liberation Army and the Special Force, the paramilitary arm of the Uganda Police Force.\\"Death in Mukura wagon\\" by Obalell Omoding , Uganda Review, 15 July 2004 Following the fall of Kampala to the NRA in January 1986, defeated UNLA soldiers retreated in disarray to their northern home regions. With this history, and the region's previous support for Milton Obote, in mind, Special District Administrator (SDA) in Soroti, Lt. Rwakatare-Amooti ordered the disbanding of the people's militia. Obalell Omoding lists this as the first mistake of the SDA, the others being: the decision to round up all security force personnel who had returned to their home villages and confiscate their weapons; a prohibition against moving livestock outside of the sub-region; and the apparent ability of senior NRA officers to flout this prohibition to make a profit by selling Teso livestock elsewhere. The exact origin of the rebel movement is unclear. What appears clear is that the disbanding of the people's militia, as well as the Special Force, created a security vacuum along the border with Karamoja, which Karamajong cattle raiders exploited to conduct raids into Teso. Despite the worsening security situation, the NRA remained focused on capturing potential security threats to its new authority. This in turn forced many former militia members, police officers and soldiers to go into hiding, or hide their weapons so they could be used for protection against cattle raiders.  The insurgency  A massive series of cattle raids in 1987 resulted in the removal of nearly all of the cattle, the primary wealth store in the region. The prohibition against movement of livestock out of the region, which practically guaranteed that it would be stolen by raiders, thus came to be seen as draconian while the rumored flouting of this rule by NRA officers for personal gain was seen as yet another example of maliciousness on the part of the Museveni administration. The resulting outrage in Teso led to the organization of the former members of security forces into the rebel UPA under the command of Peter Otai, minister of state for defence under the second Obote administration (1981-1985). In the degree to which its membership was composed largely of professional soldiers, the UPA thus resembles the Acholi Uganda People's Democratic Army, which was fighting the NRA government in the north.Robert Gersony, , United States Embassy, Kampala, 1997, p. 105 Both the NRA and UPA were known for their heavy-handed tactics targeting civilians during the insurgency. Perhaps the most famous was the July 1989 case of 69 prisoners in NRA custody, who were locked in a railcar at Okungulo railway station in Mukura Sub-County, Kumi District and apparently intentionally suffocated to death. In 1990, the Teso Commission was formed to seek an end to the conflict, an effort which bore fruit in 1992, when the insurgency ended.Gersony, 1997, p. 106  Aftermath  In the 1996 presidential election, Museveni received a majority of the votes in the Teso region. In June 2003, more than 2000 former members of the UPA, under the command of Musa Ecweru, then Resident District Commissioner of Kasese and local MP John Eresu reportedly joined the national army as a paramilitary force to combat incursions by the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), a rebel group that had originated in the Acholi. The LRA had sought out former UPA fighters in the hopes that they would join their rebellion. Only after it became apparent that the Iteso were hostile to their presence did the LRA begin attacking the populace.Zachary Lomo and Lucy Hovil, Behind the Violence: The War in Northern Uganda, Institute for Security Studies Monograph No 99, March 2004. pp. 51-52  Notes and references  Rebel groups in Uganda 1987 establishments in Uganda 1992 disestablishments in Uganda ","title":"Uganda People's Army"},{"id":"14462632","text":"Valle de Guadalupe may refer to: *Valle de Guadalupe, Baja California *Valle de Guadalupe, Northern Jalisco *Valle de Guadalupe, Southern Jalisco *Valle de Guadalupe, Michoac√°n *Valle de Guadalupe, Quer√©taro ","title":"Valle de Guadalupe (disambiguation)"},{"id":"14462636","text":"Lansdowne Christian Church (LCC, also known as Hull Memorial) was established in 1903 in Lansdowne, Maryland.

The church is currently led by Reverend Trent Owings. Weekly services are held each Sunday. Special holiday services are held as well. Community outreach events are conducted in collaboration with other local churches. A Summer Concert series has conducted monthly concerts since 2004 with performers from Annapolis and neighboring counties. Historical significance The ground and building were donated by a Civil War veteran Charles W. Hull, and his wife Mary A. Hull. This gift was to honor the Union soldiers of the Civil War. The Hull's donated other property to benefit early Lansdowne, including land to establish the first volunteer fire company in Lansdowne in 1902. Charles Wesley Hull was a member and Commander of the Dushane Post #3. He originally served in Ohio before moving to Baltimore. He died March 17, 1926 and is buried in Baltimore. The church building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. In 2004, LCC was added to Maryland's Civil War Trail. Historically unique, it is the only church in the United States ever dedicated to the Grand Army of the Republic. Each year on the last Sunday in May, a special GAR Memorial Service is held to commemorate the veterans of foreign wars. Three beautiful stained glass windows were given to the church in 1905 by the Grand Army of the Republic, Dushane Post #3 of the \\"Grand Army\\", and the Dushane Corp #3 of the Woman's Relief Corp.

It includes all forms of black-and-white photography, which produce images containing shades of neutral gray ranging from black to white. Other hues besides gray, such as sepia, cyan, or brown can also be used in monochrome photography. In the contemporary world, monochrome photography is mostly used for artistic purposes and certain technical imaging applications, rather than for visually accurate reproduction of scenes. Description Although methods for photographing in color emerged slowly starting in the 1850s, monochrome imagery dominated photography until the mid‚Äìtwentieth century. From the start, photographic recording processes such as the daguerreotype, the paper negative and the glass collodion negative did not render the color of light (although they were sensitive to some colors more than others). The result was a monochrome image. Until the 1880s, photographic processes used to print negatives ‚Äî notably the calotype, the salt print and the albumen print ‚Äî generally produced images with a variety of brown or sepia tones. Later processes moved toward a black-and-white image, although photographers have used toning solutions to convert silver in the image to silver sulphide, imparting a brown or sepia tone. Similarly, selenium toner produces a blue- black or purple image by converting silver into more stable silver selenide. Cyanotypes use iron salts rather than silver salts, producing blue images. Most modern black-and-white films, called panchromatic films, record the entire visible spectrum. Some films are orthochromatic, recording visible light wavelengths shorter than 590 nanometers, in the blue to green range of the spectrum and are less sensitive to the longer wavelength range (i.e. orange-red) of the visible spectrum. Modern techniques and uses Black-and- white photography is considered by some to be more subtle and interpretive, and less realistic than color photography. Monochrome images are not direct renditions of their subjects, but are abstractions from reality, representing colors in shades of gray. In computer terms, this is often called \\"grayscale\\". Black-and-white photography is considered by some to add a more emotional touch to the subject, compared with the original colored photography. Monochrome images may be produced in a number of ways. Finding and capturing a scene having only variants of a certain hue, while difficult and uncommon in practice, will result in an image that technically qualifies as a monochrome photo. One can also artificially limit the range of color in a photo to those within a certain hue by using black-and-white film or paper, or by manipulating color images using computer software. Color images can be converted to black and white on the computer using several methods, including desaturating the existing color RGB image so that no color remains visible (which still allows color channels to be manipulated to alter tones such as darkening a blue sky, or by converting the image to a grayscale version (which eliminates the colors permanently), using software programs like Photoshop. After software conversion to a monochrome image, one or more hues can replace the gray tones to emulate duotones, sepia, selenium or gold toned images or cyanotype, calotype or albumen prints.  Digital black-and-white cameras  Leica M Monochrom is a digital camera in Leica Camera AG's rangefinder M series, and features a monochrome sensor. The camera was announced in May 2012. Fujifilm X-Pro1-M is a cheaper option compared to the Leica M Model. It is a digital camera with a removed color sensor to capture monochromatic photographs. The camera was released in March 2012.

The village is located along an old section of the Yellowhead Highway, about 15 kilometres southeast of the City of Saskatoon.  History  In 1908, the Village of French was established covering the south half of Section 16 and the southwest quarter of Section 15. J.T. Dawson was overseer and Alfred Rogers and C.H. Goodrich were councillors elected in February 1909. Carl H. Phillips was designated as secretary-treasurer. On March 9, 1909, the name of French was changed to Clavet. The Village of Clavet however, was not to experience successful civic affairs. In October 1909, W.C. Sutherland, Deputy Commissioner, recommended disorganization of the village because two council members had moved away, the secretary-treasurer had resigned, and the population was no longer sufficient to justify village status. However, despite years of unsuccessful struggling with village affairs and severe chastising by Municipal Affairs, the Village of Clavet still existed in 1925 with a population of 9 men, 5 women, and 12 children. It also had buildings consisting of two elevators, one general store, one implement shop, a lumberyard, a post office, a dwelling house, and a church. This gave an assessment of $27,850, a mill rate of 17, and a total tax revenue of $473.45. On March 1, 1927, J.J. Smith, Deputy Minister of Municipal Affairs, disorganized the Village of Clavet due to too small a population and inadequate assessment to finance village affairs. Upon disorganization, the boundaries of Clavet had been altered. After, from 1927 to 1978, the affairs of Clavet were controlled and managed by the RM of Blucher No. 343. All the records and related information were kept at the RM's office, which burned down in 1982. Information about these years is, therefore, limited to what local residents can recall. In 1964, Clavet became an organized hamlet of eleven families with a population of 39. The Hamlet of Clavet elected three board members who made recommendations to the RM of Blucher No. 343 on the hamlet's behalf. The hamlet was surveyed following its organization, and water and sewer services were installed in 1972‚Äì1973 through the Family Farm Improvement Program at a cost of $14,689. There were 17 original connections to the system, plus the school. Ed Holobetz, the contractor, installed the original two-inch plastic lines to carry water from the Saskatchewan Water Supply Board System to all residents. Individual septic tanks served each house and the lagoon was situated near the present lift station. Saskatchewan Highways paved Main Street, Queen Street and Second Avenue in 1972. Two elevators which had been in operation during the early years burned down in 1967 and were not replaced. A third elevator was torn down and salvaged in 1968. The post office was operated by Jean Campbell out of her home at Queen Street and Second Avenue until her retirement in 1978. When I.E S. Confectioners opened in 1978, owned and operated by Irma Weisner and her daughter, Sandra Baumgartner, the post office was relocated in the store and operated by Sandra. Susan Yuzik became postmistress in 1981. Following installation of water and sewer, new lots on Campbell Place, named in honor of Jean Campbell, were developed. The new homes constructed between 1975 and 1979 brought increased population, tax revenue, and strain on the present lagoon system. In early 1978, the residents of Clavet petitioned for village status. Clavet incorporated as a village on July 1, 1978. The first council consisted of Mayor Bill Martin and councillors Rudy Weisner and John Baumgartner. Ros Curnow was engaged as secretary-treasurer.

As journalism became a profession, women were restricted by custom from access to journalism occupations, and faced significant discrimination within the profession. Nevertheless, women operated as editors, reporters, sports analysts and journalists even before the 1890s.Rick Brown, \\"The Emergence of Females as Professional Journalists,\\" HistoryReference.org Currently In 2017, with the #MeToo movement, a number of notable female journalists came forward to report sexual harassment in their workplaces. In 2018, a global support organization called The Coalition For Women In Journalism was formed to address the challenges women journalists face across different countries in the world. According to its founder, a Pakistani journalist Kiran Nazish, \\"Traditionally, women journalists have been doing it alone and they do need an infrastructure that helps guide them through their careers.\\" She said in an interview, \\"The reason why women are not on the top is not because there aren't enough women or that they're not talented enough, it's purely that they need to help each other. That's why we were formed and that's why we would like to get as much support in from everyone in the industry.\\" According to Lauren Wolfe, an investigative journalist and the director of the Women's Media Center's Women Under Siege program, female journalists face particular risks over their male colleagues, and are more likely to experience online harassment or sexual assault on the job. According to a report released on 20 December 2017 by the Committee to Protect Journalists, in 2017, 42 journalists were killed because of their work worldwide, with 81 percent of those journalists male. This was slightly lower than the historical average of 93 percent of men journalists killed annually for their work, with The Intercept theorizing that the drop was perhaps due to women being assigned more frequently to dangerous locales. Until 2019, the problem of gender imbalance and lack of representation of women on platforms of success continued. After the British Journalism Awards 2019, the fewer bylines by women visible in the award caused a stir leading to a protest and a relaunch of Words By Women Awards.  Safety  Safety of journalists is the ability for journalists and media professionals to receive, produce and share information without facing physical or moral threats. Women journalists also face increasing dangers such as sexual assault, \\"whether in the form of a targeted sexual violation, often in reprisal for their work; mob-related sexual violence aimed against journalists covering public events; or the sexual abuse of journalists in detention or captivity. Many of these crimes are not reported as a result of powerful cultural and professional stigmas.\\"The United Nations Plan of Action on the Safety of Journalists and Issues of Impunity, 2012, https://en.unesco.org/sites/default/files/un-plan- on-safety-journalists_en.pdf  Threats  Women journalists, whether they are working in an insecure context, or in a newsroom, face risks of physical assault, sexual harassment, sexual assault, rape and even murder. They are vulnerable to attacks not only from those attempting to silence their coverage, but also from sources, colleagues and others.Lanza, Edison. 2017.

A 2014 global survey of nearly a thousand journalists, initiated by the International News Safety Institute (INSI) in partnership with the International Women's Media Foundation (IWMF) and with the support of UNESCO, found that nearly two-thirds of women who took part in the survey had experienced intimidation, threats or abuse in the workplace.International Media Women‚Äôs Foundation and International News Safety Institute 2013. In the period from 2012 through 2016, UNESCO's Director-General denounced the killing of 38 women journalists, representing 7 per cent of all journalists killed.https://en.unesco.org/unesco-condemns-killing-of-journalists The percentage of journalists killed who are women is significantly lower than their overall representation in the media workforce. This large gender gap is likely the result of the persistent under-representation of women covering important beats and reporting from conflict, war-zones or insurgencies or on topics such as politics and crime.Harris, Janet, Nick Mosdell, and James Griffiths. 2016.

A report from The Coalition For Women In Journalism highlighted that during the first six months of 2019, women journalists were attacked every other day of the year. The report recorded 85 cases, where three women journalists were also killed. It noted that 35 women journalists were in prisons around the world during the first six months of the year. Around 20% of all the cases that were documented had to do with online harassment.http://womeninjournalism.org/s/H1-REPORT.pdf  Online harassment  Research undertaken by Pew Research Center indicated that 73 per cent of adult internet users in the United States had seen someone be harassed in some way online and 40 per cent had personally experienced it, with young women being particularly vulnerable to sexual harassment and stalking.Duggan, Maeve, Lee Rainie, Aaron Smith, Cary Funk, Amanda Lenhart, and Mary Madden. 2014.

Canadian born Florence MacLeod Harper was notable for her work with photographer Donald Thompson covering both the Eastern front in World War One and the February revolution in St Petersburg 1917 for Leslie's weekly. Her subsequent books, Bloodstained Russia and 'Runaway Russia', were some of the first Western accounts of events.http://www.alexanderpalace.org/thompson/ Denmark In Denmark, women became editors early on by inheriting papers form their spouses, the earliest examples being Sophie Morsing, who inherited Wochenliche Zeitung from her husband in 1658 and managed the paper as editor, and Catherine Hake, who inherited the paper Europ√§ische Wochentliche Zeitung as widow the following year ‚Äì as far as it is known, though, these women did not write in their papers.John Chr.

J√∏rgensen:Da kvinderne blev journalister. K√∏benhavns Universitet. Det Humanistiske Fakultet. K√∏benhavns Universitet. 2012 In 1845, Marie Arnesen became the first woman to participate in the public political debate in a Danish newspaper, and from the 1850s, it became common for women to participate in public debate or contribute with an occasional article: among them being Caroline Testman, who wrote travel articles, and Athalia Schwartz, who was a well known public media figure through her participation in the debate in the papers between 1849 and 1871. In the 1870s, the women's movement started and published papers of their own, with women editors and journalists. It was not until the 1880s, however, that women begun to be professionally active in the Danish press, and Sofie Horten (1848‚Äì1927) likely became the first woman who supported herself as a professional journalist when she was employed at Sor√∏ Amtstidende in 1888. An important pioneer was Loulou Lassen, employed at the Politiken in 1910, the first female career journalist and a pioneer female journalist within science, also arguably the first nationally well known woman in the profession. In 1912, eight women were members of the reporter's union K√∏benhavns Journalistforbund (Copenhagen Association of Journalists), five in the club Journalistforeningen i K√∏benhavn (Journalist Association of Copenhagen) and a total of 35 women employed as journalists in Denmark.

Finland The Swedish journalist and editor Catharina Ahlgren was most likely the first female journalist and editor in the then Swedish province of Finland when she published her own essay paper, the Swedish language Om att r√§tt behaga in 1782, which was also among the very first papers in Finland.Henrika Zilliacus- Tikkanen: N√§r k√∂net b√∂rjade skriva ‚Äì Kvinnor i finl√§ndsk press 1771‚Äì1900 (English: When gender started to write ‚Äì women in Finnish media 1771‚Äì1900) Traditionally, the first female journalist has been referred to as Fredrika Runeberg, who wrote poems and articles in Helsingfors Morgonblad under the name of her spouse Johan Ludvig Runeberg in the 1830s. The first woman in Finland to work as a journalist in Finland under her own name was Adela√Øde Ehrnrooth, who wrote in Helsingfors Dagblad and Hufvudstadsbladet for 35 years from 1869 onward. France Anne-Marguerite Petit du Noyer (1663‚Äì1719) has been referred to as one of the most famous early 18th century female journalists in Europe. Her reports of the negotiations leading to the Peace of Utrecht were read all over Europe and admired for the distinction with which she reported on scandal and gossip.Regine Reynolds-Cornell: Fiction and reality in the M√©moires of the notorious Anne-Marguerite Petit DuNoyer (T√ºbingen: Narr 1999). Germany Therese Huber In 1816, Therese Huber became an editor of the , one of the main literary and cultural journals of the era. Therese Huber was the first woman supporting her family with a salaried editorial position at a journal and has been described as the first woman to hold an editorial position and even as the first journalist in Germany. Huber had full responsibility for the journal from 1817 to 1823. She was not only author and editor for the journal, but also contributed many of her own translations. The journal had its most successful period under her editorship, with more than 1800 copies sold in 1820. Norway The first female journalist in Norway was Birgithe K√ºhle, who published the local paper Provincial-Lecture in Bergen between 1794 and 1795.Bra b√∂ckers v√§rldshistoria / [chefredakt√∂r: Kenneth √Östr√∂m; redaktion: Gil Dahlstr√∂m ...].

Other pioneers were Wilhelmine Gulowsen, editor of the culture paper Figaro in 1882‚Äì83, and Elisabeth Sch√∏yen, editor of the family magazine Familie-Mus√¶um in 1878 and journalist of Bergensposten and Aftenposten.Elisabeth Sch√∏yen.

The Norwegian newspaper press in the capital of Oslo had their first two female reporters with Marie Mathisen in Dagsposten in 1897, and Anna Hvoslef in Aftenposten in 1898: the former became the first female member of the Oslo Journalistklubb (Oslo Journalist Association) in 1902.Kvaale, Reidun: Kvinner i norsk presse gjennom 150 √•r. Gyldendal Norsk Forlag, 1986 Poland Polish television news anchor Beata Chmielowska-Olech, 2007 In 1822, Wanda Malecka (1800‚Äì1860) became the first woman newspaper publisher in Poland when she published the Bronis≈Çawa (followed in 1826‚Äì31 by the Wyb√≥r romans√≥w); she had in 1818-20 previously been the editor of the handwritten publication Domownik, and was also a pioneer woman journalist, publishing articles in Wanda.Leon Rogalski, Historya literatury Polski√©j, Volume 2, Nak≈Çadem Micha≈Ça Gl√ºcksberga, ksiƒôgarza, 1871. pp. 590‚Äì591 Sweden Wendela Hebbe, drawing by Maria R√∂hl 1842. In Sweden, Maria Matras, known as \\"N. Wankijfs Enka\\", published the paper Ordinarie Stockholmiske Posttijdender in 1690‚Äì1695, but it is unknown if she wrote in the paper as well.Berger, Margareta, Pennskaft: kvinnliga journalister i svensk dagspress 1690‚Äì1975 [Penholders: Female journalists in Swedish press 1690‚Äì1975], Norstedt, Stockholm, 1977 Margareta Momma became the first identified female journalist and chief editor as the editor of the political essaypaper Samtal emellan Argi Skugga och en obekant Fruentimbers Skugga in 1738.Ann √ñhrberg, Vittra fruntimmer. F√∂rfattarroll och retorik hos frihetstidens kvinnliga f√∂rfattare (Uppsala 2001) 165‚Äì187, 339‚Äì345. During the 18th-century, many periodicals for, about, and likely also by women were published, but as women normally published under pseudonym, the can seldom be identified: one of the few identified ones being Catharina Ahlgren, who edited the typical women's periodical De nymodiga fruntimren (Modern Women) in 1773.Berger, Margareta, √Ñntligen ord fr√•n qwinnohopen!: At last, words also from the women : om kvinnopress under 1700-talet, Akademilitt., Stockholm, 1984 Women chief editors became fairly common during the 18th-century when the press in Sweden developed, especially since the widow of a male printer or editor normally took over the business of her late spouse: a successful and well known female newspaper editor was Anna Hammar- Ros√©n, who managed the popular newspaper Hwad Nytt?? Hwad Nytt?? between 1773 and 1795. It was not until the 19th-century that the papers of the Swedish press started to introduce a permanent staff of co-workers and journalists, a development which attached the first women as permanent employees to the newspaper offices, which are noted to be Wendela Hebbe at Aftonbladet in 1841‚Äì51 and Marie Sophie Schwartz at Svenska Tidningen Dagligt Allehanda in 1851‚Äì57. In 1858, Louise Flodin came to be regarded as an important pioneer when she founded her own newspaper, became the first woman to be given a newspaper license, and composed a staff entirely of women employees, and Eva Brag became an important pioneer during her career at G√∂teborgs Handels- och Sj√∂fartstidning in 1865‚Äì1889.Heggestad, Eva: Kritik och k√∂n. 1880-talets kvinnliga kritiker och exemplet Eva Brag.

From the 1880s, women became more common in the offices of the press, and when women was admitted to the Swedish Publicists' Association in 1885, 14 women were inducted as members. The pioneer generation of women journalists were generally from the upper/middle class who wished to earn their own income. At this point, the focus of a conventional education for a woman was language, which was not the case with a conventional male education, especially since the male reporters were generally not from the upper classes. Women were employed as translators and given the responsibility for the coverage of culture and foreign news and interviews of foreigners. During this period, women journalists were reportedly respected ‚Äì partially due to their social background ‚Äì and due to their language skills given assignments with equal status to their male co-workers. In 1918, Maria Cederschi√∂ld, first woman editor of a foreign news section, recalled that women reporters were not as controversial or discriminated in the 1880s as they would later become, \\"...when the results of Strindberg's hatred of women made itself known. Nor was the struggle of life and competition so sharp, as it has later become. The women pioneers were generally treated with sympathy and interest, even by the men, perhaps because they normally did not regard them as dangerous competitors.\\" Of the seven biggest newspapers in Stockholm, six had female co-workers prior to 1900, and when Swedish Union of Journalists was founded in 1901, women were included from the start. An important event occurred in 1910, when the popular novel Pennskaftet by Elin W√§gner made the journalist profession a popular career choice for women, and women career journalists were often referred to as \\"pennskaft\\". By this time, women reporters, though a minority, had become common and no longer regarded as a novelty and the competition had become harder: in 1913, Stockholms Dagblad made a record by having seven female co-workers, and the same year, the Swedish Publicists' Association founded the De kvinnliga journalisternas stipendiefond to finance foreign trips for women reporters. Women covered World War I and the Russian revolution and several women journalists became famed role models such as Ester Blenda Nordstr√∂m, Anna Lisa Andersson and Elin Brandell. During the Interwar period, a change occurred which exposed women reporters to an informal discrimination long referred to as a \\"woman's trap\\": the introduction of the customary women's section of the newspapers. During World War I, war time rationing made it necessary to cover household interests, which after the war became a woman's section, as household tasks were regarded as female tasks. The coverage of the women's section customarily became the task of the women reporters, and as they were a minority, the same reporters were often forced to handle the women's section side from their other assignments, which placed them in a great disadvantage to their male colleagues when the competition became harsher during the interwar depression. In parallel, they were women with successful careers, notably Barbro Alving, whose coverage of the Spanish civil war, World War II and the Cold war made her famous, and Dagmar Cronn, who were the editor of the economy section at Svenska Dagbladet in 1933‚Äì1959, which made her unique at the time. In 1939, Elsa Nyblom became vice chairperson of the Publicistklubben. The informal discrimination changed when women reporters started to expand the subjects treated at the women's sections. A noted example of this development was Synn√∂ve Bellander, editor of the women's section Hus och hem at Svenska Dagbladet in 1932‚Äì59. Originally expected to write only of fashion and make up, she started to expand the area to the subjects of education and professional life for women, and from there to consumer issues and food quality and other issues concerning the private home life. This development in the women's sections gradually transformed them to sections for \\"family\\" and private life for both sexes, and blurred the line to the rest of the paper. The 1960s signified a great change. A debate about gender discrimination in the press, followed by the general debate about gender roles during the second-wave feminism, quickly raised the numbers of female reporters in the press from 1965 onward. In 1970, Pernilla Tunberger became the first woman to be awarded Stora Journalistpriset. United Kingdom The number of women contributing to British newspapers and periodicals increased dramatically as the nineteenth century progressed. This increase was partly due to the proliferation of women-only publications which covered society, arts and fashion as well as emerging topics such as feminism and women's suffrage. The trend was also accompanied by a slow-growing acceptance of women journalists in the more traditional press. By 1894 the number of women journalists was large enough for the Society of Women Writers and Journalists to be founded, By 1896, the society had over 200 members. The first female full-time employed journalist in Fleet Street was Eliza Lynn Linton, who was employed by The Morning Chronicle from 1848: three years later, she became the paper's correspondent in Paris, and upon her return to London in the 1860s, she was given a permanent position. Early in her career, novelist George Eliot was a contributor to the Coventry Herald and Observer, she later became assistant editor on the left-wing journal The Westminster Review from 1851 until 1852. Feminist writer Bessie Rayner Parkes Belloc began her career writing for local newspapers and was founder editor of the English Woman's Journal which was published between 1858 and 1864, she also wrote essays, poetry, fiction and travel literature. Her daughter, Marie Belloc Lowndes, was a novelist as well as a contributor to the Pall Mall Gazette between 1889 and 1895. She travelled widely for her work and reported on the Paris Exhibition of 1889. Marie's brother was writer and satirist, Hilaire Belloc. The Irish writer Frances Cobbe wrote for the London Echo from 1868 until 1875 with most of her work appearing in the newspaper's leaders. She wrote on a range of topics, the agreement being that she visited the newspaper offices three mornings a week to write an article 'on some social subject'. One of the first British war correspondents was the writer Lady Florence Dixie who reported on the First Boer War, 1880-1881, as field correspondent for the Morning Post. She also reported on the Anglo-Zulu War. Emily Crawford was an Irish foreign correspondent who lived in Paris and wrote a regular 'Letter from Paris' for London's Morning Star in the 1860s. Her husband, George Moreland Crawford, was the Paris correspondent of The Daily News. When her husband died suddenly in 1885, Emily inherited his position and continued in the role until 1907. She wrote for a wide range of newspapers and periodicals during her career and became President of the Society of Women Journalists in 1901. After studying medicine at Edinburgh, Florence Fenwick Miller decided to follow a different course and turned to lecturing and writing instead. She was a keen proponent of women's suffrage and edited The Woman's Signal from 1895 until 1899. In 1886 she began a Ladies' Column for the Illustrated London News and continued it for thirty years. She contributed to a wide range of other publications during her career including Echo, Fraser's Magazine and The Woman's World. Flora Shaw was a foreign correspondent whose interview with the exiled former Sudanese governor, Zebehr Pasha, was published in the Pall Mall Gazette in 1886. This led to commissions from the Manchester Guardian and The Times where Shaw eventually became Colonial Editor. As a correspondent she travelled to Southern Africa, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. After a famous failed attempt to divorce her husband, Lord Colin Campbell, in 1886, Irish born Gertrude Elizabeth Blood turned to journalism. She contributed to the Pall Mall Gazette and wrote columns on a wide range of topics including art, music, theatre and fishing. Virginia Mary Crawford began writing for the Pall Mall Gazette in the 1880s after a much publicised divorce from her husband Donald Crawford. Her writing covered art, literature, women's rights and Catholicism. She played an active role in women's suffrage. Eliza Davis Aria was a fashion writer and columnist known as 'Mrs Aria', she wrote for a variety of publications in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century including Queen, The Gentlewoman, Hearth and Home, and the Daily Chronicle. She was well-known in London society and had a long-term relationship with the actor Sir Henry Irving. In 1891, Rachel Beer became the first female editor of a national newspaper in the UK when she became editor of The Observer. In 1893 she purchased the Sunday Times and became editor of that paper too. One of the founders of the Society of Women Journalists, Mary Frances Billington, was its president from 1913 to 1920. Her career began in the 1880s and she helped establish the Southern Echo in 1888. She covered major events for the Daily Telegraph in the late 1890s and later reported from France during World War I. United States The Baroness Frederika Charlotte Riedesel's 18th century Letters and Journals Relating to the War of the American Revolution and the Capture of the German Troops at Saratoga is regarded as the first account of war by a woman. Her writing analyzes the relevant events, personalities of key actors and consequences of the military struggles she observed. Moreover, she was personally involved in the heart of the Battles of Saratoga. She suffered the hardships of siege when she sheltered in the cellar of the Marshall House during the failed retreat of the British army. Beginning in the late nineteenth century, women began agitating for the right to work as professional journalists in North America and Europe; by many accounts, the first notable woman in political journalism was Jane Grey Swisshelm. A former correspondent for Horace Greeley's New York Tribune, she persuaded President Millard Fillmore to open the gallery in congress so that she could report on congressional news.\\"Jane Grey Swisshelm: A Staunch Foe of Slavery, A Noble Woman's Life's Work.\\" San Francisco Bulletin, 2 August 1884, p. 1S. Prior to Swisshelm, Horace Greeley had employed another noteworthy woman in journalism, Margaret Fuller, who covered international news. Nellie Bly became known for her investigative reporting at the New York World. She was one of the first female journalists of her era to report by going undercover. While many female reporters in the 1800s and early 1900s were restricted to society reporting and were expected to cover the latest in food or fashion, there were a few women who reported on subjects that were considered the domain of male reporters. One example was Ina Eloise Young (later Ina Young Kelley). In 1907, Young was said to be the only female sports editor (or \\"sporting\\" editor, as it was then called). She worked in Colorado for the Trinidad Chronicle-News, and her areas of expertise were baseball, football, and horse racing.\\"Colorado Has the Only Woman Sporting Editor.\\" Washington DC Sunday Star, 29 December 1907, p.4. She covered the 1908 World's Series, the only woman of her time to do so.\\"World's Series Notes.\\" Harrisburg (PA) Patriot, 15 October 1908, p. 8. The 2014 Status of Women in the U.S. Media reported that of more than 150 sports-related print publications and sports-related websites, 90 percent of editors were white males. U.S. World War II correspondents Another example of a woman in a non-traditional media profession was Jennie Irene Mix: when radio broadcasting became a national obsession in the early 1920s, she was one of the few female radio editors at a magazine: a former classical pianist and a syndicated music critic who wrote about opera and classical music in the early 1920s, Mix became the radio editor at Radio Broadcast magazine, a position she held from early 1924 until her sudden death in April 1925.Caroline Mitchell, editor. Women and Radio: Airing Differences. Routledge, 2000, p. 23. In talk radio, there were no women among the top 10 of Talkers magazine's \\"Heavy Hundred\\" and only two women were among the 183 sport talk radio hosts list. Women increased their presence in professional journalism, and popular representations of the \\"intrepid girl reporter\\" became popular in 20th-century films and literature, such as in \\"His Girl Friday\\".Paul E.

Dorothy Thompson was an American journalist and radio broadcaster, who in 1939 was recognized by Time magazine as the second most influential woman in America next to Eleanor Roosevelt. She is notable as the first American journalist to be expelled from Nazi Germany in 1934 and as one of the few women news commentators on radio during the 1930s. She is regarded by some as the \\"First Lady of American Journalism.\\" After the War she stood up for Palestinian rights against much hostility. Nepal The history of women in journalism in Nepal is relatively new. Nepal only enjoyed an open press after the 1990 democratic movement. It is only since that change that women have been more active in the scene of journalism. The number of registered women journalists under the Federation of Nepalese Journalists is 1,613. Egypt Hind Nawfal (1860‚Äì1920) was the first woman in the Arab world to publish a journal (Al Fatat) concerning only women's issues. Zaynab Fawwaz was another prolific journalist who also founded a literary salon.

Music critics Popular music American pop music critic Ann Powers (pictured in 2007) While there are significant numbers of women vocalists singing in pop and rock music, many other aspects of pop and rock music are male-dominated, including record producing, instrument playing and music journalism. According to Anwen Crawford, the \\"problem for women [popular music critics] is that our role in popular music was codified long ago\\", which means that \\"[b]ooks by living female rock critics (or jazz, hip- hop, and dance-music critics, for that matter) are scant.\\"Crawford, Anwen. \\"The World Needs Female Rock Critics\\" in The Atlantic. 26 May 2015.

Frith, W. Stray and J. Street, The Cambridge Companion to Pop and Rock (Cambridge University Press, 2001), p. 226.

The American music critic Ann Powers, as a female critic and journalist, has written critiques on the perceptions of sex, racial and social minorities in the music industry. She has also written about feminism. In 2006 she accepted a position as chief pop- music critic at the Los Angeles Times, where she succeeded Robert Hilburn.Patrick MacDonald, Ann Powers named L.A.

Biography   Early life and education  Jack L. Gray was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia on April 28, 1927, the only child of civil engineer Samuel William Gray. Growing up in the South End of Halifax, he was a pupil at Tower Road School. As a schoolboy young Jack loved drawing pictures, especially those of ships at sea, and his talent was recognized and encouraged by Sir Edmund Wyly Grier. By the end of World War II he was a student at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design (NSCAD) during the tenure of Donald Cameron MacKay. At the art college, Gray was mentored by several painters, including Elizabeth Styring Nutt and David Whitzman. It was here that the young Gray met fellow artists Earl Bailly and Joseph Purcell. In the summer of 1945 Gray boarded with the Young family of East Ironbound island and made many sketches of island life which subsequently were turned into large paintings. After two years of studies at NSCAD, he left the school and went on sketching trips both alone and also with Purcell, his former classmate. During the summer of 1947 the two artists rented the loft of a fish store at New Harbour, Nova Scotia and made many drawings and paintings. Gray traveled briefly to Montreal in 1948 to take a life drawing course from Arthur Lismer at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts. Gray was observed sketching a boat hull in the class, and the instructor commented that, given that a future course might be offered in boat drawing, Gray likely would then be found drawing a nude. Jack's evident lack of interest in Lismer's classroom sessions soon led to private discussions between the two artists, which proved fruitful. In those years Gray also spent several seasons at sea with the last of Lunenburg, Nova Scotia's dory-fishing schooner fleet, and amassed a portfolio of sketches, notes and photographs.  Career  His first major solo exhibition was at the Hackmatack Inn in Chester, Nova Scotia in 1948, leading to several commissions. With subsequent patronage from the Philadelphia dowager heiress Mary Dayton Cavendish, Maritime brewery owner Sidney C. Oland and others in the Oland family, Gray gradually advanced his career, living aboard boats in the early 1950s. When the steamship Dufferin Bell was wrecked on the Nova Scotian coast in 1951, Gray traveled with the salvage crew and filled several sketchbooks, attracting the attention of the press. An early friendship with author Thomas Head Raddall led to Gray's pen- and ink illustrations in Raddall's A Muster of Arms (1954); Gray also painted a wartime scene of Duncan's Cove, Nova Scotia for the book's dust jacket. While based in Chester in the summers from 1953 to 1955, he painted in (his landlord) Herman Walker's sail loft in the Back Harbour. In the mid-1950s Gray moved to New York City, and initially painted in studios on boats in Flushing Bay. It was here that he first used the cantankerous flat-bottomed skiff he called the S.O.B. for waterborne sketching trips. For one of his sketches Gray obtained permission from authorities in Brooklyn Navy Yard to use the deck of the rusting decommissioned aircraft carrier USS Enterprise (CV-6). His first New York showing was at the invitation of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in 1955. He was represented by Rudolf Wunderlich's Kennedy Galleries on 57th Street while living in the city, and briefly occupied one of the Des Artistes flats in the Upper West Side. A body of work from this period later became a well-known series of reproductions, the New York Harbor Collection. However, the collection was incomplete since many of the significant canvas works from that period were already sold. While in New York, Gray became acquainted with folksinger Ed McCurdy, and the two remained lifelong friends. In 1958 an engagement with Samuel Bronston's Hollywood production company took Gray to Spain, where he worked on posters for the film John Paul Jones. With encouragement from US district attorney (later Senator) E. Donald Finnegan, Gray moved in 1959 to Winterport, Maine, settling in an 18th-century Cape Cod on the banks of the Penobscot River. There he created a series of paintings, of which later critics, notably art expert Ian Muncaster of Halifax, would characterize as his best work. The Maine studio was short- lived, as Gray sold it in 1961 and moved to the Marlborough Woods area in the south end of Halifax, purchasing a property on the Northwest Arm, with a dock for his boat. Gray negotiated with New York publicity firm Peed & Gammon in 1961, who arranged for Gray's canvas Dressing Down, the GullyDressing Down, the Gully, John F. Kennedy Presidential Library to find its way into the hands of newly elected US president John F. Kennedy. This resulted in a July 1962 visit to the White House in Washington by Gray, including a conversation with the President. Gammon and Peed had leaked this information in advance to the press, and upon publication of the White House visit news, bids from many patrons and galleries rapidly ensued. Gray remained friends with Roland Gammon for years afterward. Gray moved back aboard a boat in 1965, in West Palm Beach, Florida, and strengthened relationships with galleries on Palm Beach's Worth Avenue that had begun in the spring of 1961 and would remain in place for the rest of his life. Concurrently, Gray maintained a summer hideaway in Stonehurst, Nova Scotia, where he continued to sketch his favorite subject, inshore fishermen in small boats. Gray befriended actor Gary Merrill in Palm Beach. The noted Hollywood photographer Phil Stern visited Gray's Nova Scotia studio in the early 1970s and amassed a huge archive of photographic images of Gray and his surroundings. This photo essay was originally earmarked to be part of a book on the artist's life and work, but the book was abandoned incomplete and never published. In his adult years Gray was known as a witty raconteur and motorboat skipper, and in the latter part of his life often sailed across the Gulf Stream to the Bahamas. He was a frequent visitor to the Blue Bee Bar in New Plymouth, Green Turtle Cay and was a personal friend to (proprietor) Miss Emily Cooper. Gray had many exhibitions in the 1970s throughout the world. Most unusual of these was the Spring 1978 retrospective exhibition in Halifax, held in the old powder magazine on Citadel Hill.  Gray's reproductions  In the early 1960s, with help from the Oland family's business connections in Halifax, Gray's paintings OFF GUNNING POINT and THE FISHERMAN were released as poster-sized reproductions. With inferior inks and average quality paper, most examples of these are now (2015) deteriorated. In the 1970s Gray himself decided to take control of his reproductions, and was led to overseas high-quality printing professionals through his friendship with H. Dieter Holterbosch. An initial reproduction was done, a full-sized copy of EAST IRONBOUND, WINTER, and the success of that led Gray to the more ambitious NEW YORK HARBOR COLLECTION, 380 sets of 12 images, with a bound set of miniatures in the style of an exhibition catalogue to be included with each set. These reproductions continue to pass from patrons to auction houses to galleries.  Unauthorized reproductions  In the late 1970s it became evident to Gray that the Dupont family, having acquired for themselves the original canvas set of the John Paul Jones canvas set from the Bronfman's following the 1958‚Äì1959 filming, had undertaken to issue a set of small reproductions, image size uniformly 28.5 x 19 .5 cm, of the paintings, under the corporate name Enterprise Promotions, Inc., \\"distributors for the Dupont Marine Heritage Collection\\". This series was done without the artist's knowledge, and made no mention of Gray's name in the promotional materials. Gray voiced his disapproval when this was brought to his attention. The set of prints were advertised for sale in US newspapers in the fall of 1976 for $0.99 per print. Today, these small reproductions are a historical oddity and not found in any of Gray's surviving gallery network.  Subject matter  A frequent foreground subject in many of Gray's paintings was a deep-keeled skiff-like Nova Scotia Bush Island boat,Bush Island boats, LaHave Islands Marine Museum which the artist referred to as a \\"ram boat\\". Almost as frequently, one or more fishermen's dory boats appear in his work. Small Tancook Schooners and early Cape Islander designs also feature prominently. While a good many large sailing ships were depicted, many of the depictions of the bigger ships showed the view from the deck of one of these vessels, and these \\"deck scenes\\" form a significant sub-classification of his life's work.  Technique  Most of Gray's fame came from his oil-on-canvas pieces. Although he painted on pre-made canvas-on board for some of his early works, he did hand-stretching of double-primed canvas for the majority of his output, particularly after 1959. All his oil works had an inscription on the back about the location of the scene depicted, often in considerable detail. Gray seldom dated his pieces, but used a code after his signature, for example: a dash plus three dots translating as 1958. His watercolor pieces diminished in number as his oil works gained notoriety, and today the surviving watercolors are rare collectibles. Gray painted his canvas pieces with oil colors mixed with turpentine. Despite the increasing availability of acrylic paints in the 1970s, Gray never used them. Throughout much of Gray's life, he patronized family-oriented restaurants that made use of paper place-mats. On these he left drawings using either his sketching pens and pencils, when he had them on hand, or an ordinary ballpoint. The vast majority of these impromptu drawings were discarded by restaurant staff, but a few salient examples survive, notably in the hands of the management of Testa's of Palm Beach, Florida. Less well-known was Gray's passion for boat design. One of his earliest (ca. 1950) floating studios was a Royal Canadian Navy harbor launch, which had been sold to fishermen post-war, and when Gray acquired this boat the Kathleen R. H. he made extensive modifications to the vessel. His floating studios were never new boats, and all had some of the artist's personally specified refits to some degree. Gray's most notable vessel was the Sea Gypsy, a 21-metre trawler. In the 1970s, Gray collaborated with a Canadian boat-building yard on the design of a custom yacht for a client.  Death and legacy  Gray was troubled with health issues during his last years. He died after a post- operative infection in Good Samaritan Hospital, West Palm Beach, on 4 September 1981. His ashes were scattered at sea, near the Tanner's Pass buoy (Near the entrance to Lunenburg Bay) from the decks of the fishing boat Doris IV, skippered by John H. Tanner. The value of Gray's works rapidly increased after his death. Art dealers searched for his works by contacting people in Nova Scotia, Maine and Florida. Several forgeries appeared, and more than one work (including a high-profile canvas that was on prominent public display in Halifax) was reported stolen. The artist's early sketchbooks, originally kept in chronological order, were separated by a Halifax dealer in the 1960s, and sold as individually framed drawings. With encouragement from both public museums and privately operated art galleries, a considerable revival of interest in Gray's life and work was seen to be underway after 2001. An increasing number of retrospective exhibitions were mounted, and his canvas works commanded ever-higher prices. In 2006, a piece titled \\"Man at Sea\\" was sold by Christies in New York for $91,200.Christies, Sale 1632, Lot 118, Fine American Paintings, Drawings and Sculpture, March 2, 2006  References   External links  An existing reliable biography from a commercial source, has annotations detailing many of Gray's significant exhibitions in later years: * https://archive.is/20141019133234/http://www.marineartsgallery.com/jack- gray/jack-gray-bio.html 1927 births 1981 deaths 20th-century Canadian painters Canadian male painters Artists from Nova Scotia Canadian marine artists People from Halifax, Nova Scotia NSCAD University alumni People from Winterport, Maine ","title":"Jack L.

Thantri is person who set rule in temples, they are the authority in the temples of Kerala and temples in coastal Karnataka in southern India. It is a position held hereditarily . It is the thantri who installs the murti of the deity called prana pratishtha, and from that moment he assumes the position of the guru of the deity. The thantri is the authority on the rites and rituals of the temple. Thantris are Shrauta Namboothiri Brahmins who study tantras, and belong to Poorva Mimamsa one of the 6 schools of thought in Hindu philosophy. Poorva mimamsa deals with the early parts of the Vedas. Another famous school of philosophy is Vedanta also known as Uttara Mimamsa, which means essence of Vedas. One common misconception about Vedanta is that writers think that it mostly deals with the later parts of the Vedas. It is the essence which enlightens one in the end is referred as Vedanta and not the physical ending parts. Thantris have the sole right to conduct certain core rituals in temples of Kerala and Tulunadu. In temples like Sabarimala, the presence of thantri is needed every day. The daily rituals in Kerala temples are traditionally performed by Namboothiris, and often by Embranthiri migrants from the neighbouring Karnataka. Even among Namboothiris, only certain designated families become thanthris. Thanthris have to perform the task of transferring (skt. Aavaahanam) the aura (skt. Chaithanyam) of deity and energizing the idol. The techniques employed are described in the aagamas . The first step of a \\"Yajamaanan\\" (a person who has prepared himself mentally and financially) to build a temple, is to seek and accept (\\"Varikkal\\") an Aacharyan (Thanthri). Sanskrit text \\"Thanthra Samuchayam\\" identifies an ideal aachaaryan as one who is born into a Brahmin family, has performed all the Shodasakriyas from Garbhaadhaanam to Agnyaadhaanam, has understood the concepts contained in the Vedas and Aagamas (Braahmacharyam, Gaarhasthhyam, Vaanaprasthham and Samnyaasam), has received blessings and Manthram advice from Gurus and elders, is an expert in performing rites and rituals (Karmams), is capable of receiving spiritual powers through meditation and penance (\\"Thapas\\"). Future Aachaaryans of the temple must be descendants of this Guru or Thanthri.{cn}} During the evolution and development of Thanthric philosophy, two kinds of aachaaryas emerged - the theoreticians and the practitioners. While the former developed concepts and prescribed procedures, the latter perfected their performance through strict discipline, leading to the attainment of the expected results.  Scriptures on Thanthras  The treatises may be divided into three categories - Aagamas (Shaivism), Samhithas (Vaishnavism) and Thanthrams (Shakthism). Aagamas include Nigama versions too. The former are Shiva's advice to Parvathy, while Nigamas are spoken by Parvathy to Siva. Other classifications are regional, like Vishnukraanthaa, Rathhakraanthaa and Aswaakraanthaa, and also like Yaamalams and Daamarams. There are treatises written by Keraleeyans as well. The most popular among them is the Thanthra Samuchayam by Chennas Narayanan Namboodiripad, who was one among the 18 ¬Ω poets of the Saamoothiri's court. He consolidated and systematized the scattered literature which had then made its learning and practice quite cumbersome. Written in simple style and understandable by the common man, it covers topics like building of temples, consecration of murtis, kalasams, uthsavams and praayaschithams. There have been several commentaries (skt. vyakhyanam) on it, both in Sanskrit and Malayalam. The treatise describes rituals related to seven deities, Siva, Vishnu, Durga, Saasthaavu, Subrahmanian, Ganapathy and Sankaranarayanan The aagamams of these deities have been condensed, as expressed by the author himself, when he stated \\"Swaagama-saara-samgrahaal\\". Two known commentaries in Sanskrit are Vimarsini and Vivaranam. Later, there have been several translations into Malayalam, of which Kuzhikkaattu Pacha by Kuzhikkaattu Maheswaran Bhattathiripad is the most popular. Works such as Thozhaanooranushtthaanam and Parameswaraanushtthaanam deal with the same topics, also from Kerala.

North Korean fishing vessels often wander into the area and are frequently chased away by South Korean patrol vessels. Occasionally a North Korean patrol tries to enforce its southern claim by traversing the limit line. In 2002 one such incursion turned into a naval battle along the limit line. Engagement On 29 June 2002, amid the festive atmosphere of the 2002 FIFA World Cup being held in South Korea, a North Korean patrol boat crossed the northern limit line and was warned to turn back. Shortly afterward, a second North Korean patrol craft crossed the line and it was also warned to retreat across the line. The North Korean boats began threatening and harassing the South Korean vessels following them. After traveling south past the limit line, the North Korean vessels attacked the two South Korean patrol boats that had been monitoring them. At 10:25, the vessel that first crossed the line opened fire with its 85 mm gun and scored a direct hit on the wheelhouse of one of the South Korean craft causing several casualties. The two squadrons then began a general engagement. The South Koreans using their 40 and 20 mm guns against the North Korean RPGs, 85 mm, and 35 mm guns. About ten minutes later, two more patrol boats and two corvettes reinforced the South Korean vessels and severely damaged one of the North Korean craft.

Deadly Earnest was a late-night horror host active on Australian television between 1959‚Äì78. Originated as a live (pre- video machine) host of a horror film package for Perth's TVW-7 by 1959, the character was most active between 1966 and 1972 when adopted by the 0-10 Network. Broadcast weekly, Deadly Earnest's Aweful MoviesAka Aweful Movies with Deadly Earnest. Spelling and title fluctuated from state to state. featured mainly b-grade horror movies introduced by local actors with a tongue-in-cheek characterization. The program was renowned for screening low- budget B-grade (or worse) supernaturally themed cinema, even going so far as to present the Worst Movie of the Year on at least one occasion.Born in Coventry, England, Ian Bannerman was the first actor to adopt the Deadly Earnest persona and probably the first late-night horror host to appear on commercial Australian TV. See 'Deadly Earnest/Aweful Movies' 13 November 2007. History The Deadly Earnest character was originated by TVW-7 Perth musical director Max Bostock. It is not known how long this version continued, but it was taken up by TEN Channel 10 in Sydney in 1966, with Ian Bannerman as the eponymous host. The program was evidently successful enough to spawn local versions on each of the TEN affiliate stations in Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide. These separate versions existed because, in this pre-satellite era, the capital-city TV stations of the ABC and the three commercial networks were all locally broadcast - the only TV networking at this time was accomplished via the coaxial cable that connected Sydney and Melbourne, and this was only used for selected programs, due to its cost and limited bandwidth. Deadly Earnest was simultaneously portrayed by Bannerman in Sydney, Channel 0 floor manager Ralph Baker in Melbourne, future TV drama star Shane Porteous in Brisbane, and Hedley Cullen in Adelaide. Each of these local incarnations differed considerably from Bostock's original character, leading to some confusion amongst fans as to who was the 'real' Earnest in later years.See 'Deadly Earnest/Aweful Movies' 13 November 2007 Varying widely in appearance and personality, each version took a vaguely sardonic approach to the subject matter, frequently ridiculing whatever film he happened to be hosting. The show was popular with teenagers and university student audiences, who apparently tuned as much for the commentaries as for the actual movies (which according to at least one observer were little short of atrocious).\\"Way, way, back in the 1960s, way before Elvira, a favourite amongst Australian students was Deadly Earnest, the TV schlock horror host. Late on Friday nights, the atrocious old sci-fi and horror films became compulsory viewing, solely because of the gothic master of ceremonies.\\" Deadly Earnest Index. Character style Ian Bannerman in particular was notable for his mordant wit, withering ad-libs and black humour parodies of contemporary advertisements.Bannerman was also known to 'plug' local Sydney businesses on air, including Cec Cook's Magic Shop and The East India Curry Restaurant. See 'Deadly Earnest/Aweful Movies' 13 November 2007 Billed as a 'Dead-Pan Ghoul', Bannerman's Earnest resembled an undead 1960s 'mod' complete with sideburns and horn-rimmed glasses. In addition to Bannerman's solo appearances, Deadly Earnest was sometimes accompanied by two 'ghoulish assistants' during commercial breaks ‚Äì possibly members of Bannerman's sideline band, The Grave Situation.Bannerman's sole known LP was titled Rave in Peace-Deadly Earnest & the Grave Situation. According to one source, Bannerman hawked the record to several Sydney AM stations in a horse-drawn hearse, accompanied by a retinue of student \\"mourners\\". See 'Deadly Earnest/Aweful Movies' 13 November 2007 Although the character's occupation was never specified, the show's opening sequence suggested he was some kind of 'zombified' undertaker (as suggested by his wheeling a casket across the rooftop of the then newly constructed Channel 10 Television Centre at North Ryde and through the studio's darkened corridors). Featured films While the majority of films featured on Deadly Earnest's Aweful Movies were stereotypical American 'schlock', a smattering of British, European and Japanese productions were thrown in every so often for good measure. Genre was not restricted exclusively to horror, but included sci-fi, suspense, mystery and even the odd matinee serial dredged up from the 1940s. The chief unifying element was the consistently poor quality of the material ‚Äì the term \\"Aweful Movie\\" could often be applied in more than one sense ‚Äì which was, evidently, part of the show's appeal.  Actors portraying Deadly Earnest  * Ralph Baker (ATV-0 Melbourne) * Ian Bannerman (TEN-10 Sydney) * Roland Barnes (TVW-7 Perth) * Hedley Cullen (SAS-10 Adelaide 1967‚Äì1974, 1975, 1978; TVW-7 Perth 1975)Martin Dunne 'Deadly Earnest' in SFSA # 14, (SFSA/SADWFC, 2004) * Shane Porteous (TVQ-0 Brisbane) Archival notes Only a few fragments of film and video footage of the various Deadly Earnest incarnations have survived. Due to the very low budgets allotted to the Aweful Movies programs, and the limited availability and high cost of videotaping programs at that time, Aweful Movies was typically broadcast live and the shows were rarely, if ever, videotaped. Another issue that has affected preservation is that, even when programs of the period that were regularly videotaped for repeat or distribution (e.g. pop programs like The Go!! Show or Uptight), Australian TV stations typically later erased or disposed of the vast majority of this material. Although there is no known surviving footage of Ian Bannerman's Aweful Movies broadcasts, there is a brief (53-second) fragment of silent colour 8mm film footage on YouTube,Colour film of Deadly Earnest showing Bannerman and two guest musicians (possibly his backing band The Grave Situation) in full costume and makeup. This is a home movie belonging to one of the guests filmed on 4 March 1969 at the Channel Ten studios in Sydney. There is also a surviving 16mm telecine monochrome film of Bannerman, in character as Deadly Earnest, on the Aweful Movies set, making a guest appearance on the Barry Crocker variety series Say It With Music ca. 1968 - this was possibly a Halloween edition of the series, and features Crocker, Bannerman, and a group of supporting singers and dancers, performing a sequence of lighthearted horror-themed musical numbers.Deadly Earnest on Say It With Music Bannerman also recorded an LP, Rave In Peace, released on the RCA Camden label in 1969, which featured ten original tracks co-written by Bannerman and musician John Brindle, including a song celebrating Bannerman's regular sponsor, \\"Cec Cook's Magic Shop\\". After Aweful Movies, Bannerman is reported to have worked for the ABC as a program assessor, but is since thought to have died, possibly some time in the 1980s. Hedley Cullen died in 1994 and no footage was known to exist of him as Deadly Earnest until SAS-7 (formerly SAS-10) celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2005, when three clips were discovered while researching a television special.Martin Dunne 'Deadly Earnest Lives Again' in The Wall of Lies # 96, (SFSA/SADWFC, 2005) One clip of Baker introducing a movie exists, and in mid-2010 footage of him in character was recovered from a current affairs show held by the National Film and Sound Archive.The footage was identified on 13 May 2010 and verified on 1 September.

McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific and Technical Terms. McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., 2003. Answers.com. Retrieved on 2007-12-02. for example liquid water and the air in the Earth's atmosphere. Unlike liquids, gases cannot form a free surface on their own. Fluidized/liquified solids, including slurries, granular materials, and powders may form a free surface. A liquid in a gravitational field will form a free surface if unconfined from above. Under mechanical equilibrium this free surface must be perpendicular to the forces acting on the liquid; if not there would be a force along the surface, and the liquid would flow in that direction. Thus, on the surface of the Earth, all free surfaces of liquids are horizontal unless disturbed (except near solids dipping into them, where surface tension distorts the surface in a region called the meniscus). In a free liquid that is not affected by outside forces such as a gravitational field, internal attractive forces only play a role (e.g. Van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonds). Its free surface will assume the shape with the least surface area for its volume: a perfect sphere. Such behaviour can be expressed in terms of surface tension. It can be demonstrated experimentally by observing a large globule of oil placed below the surface of a mixture of water and alcohol having the same density so the oil has neutral buoyancy. Waves If the free surface of a liquid is disturbed, waves are produced on the surface. These waves are not elastic waves due to any elastic force; they are gravity waves caused by the force of gravity tending to bring the surface of the disturbed liquid back to its horizontal level. Momentum causes the wave to overshoot, thus oscillating and spreading the disturbance to the neighboring portions of the surface. The velocity of the surface waves varies as the square root of the wavelength if the liquid is deep; therefore long waves on the sea go faster than short ones. Very minute waves or ripples are not due to gravity but to capillary action, and have properties different from those of the longer ocean surface waves, because the surface is increased in area by the ripples and the capillary forces are in this case large compared with the gravitational forces. Capillary ripples are damped both by sub-surface viscosity and by surface rheology.  Rotation  Free surface of a liquid in a rotating vessel is a paraboloid If a liquid is contained in a cylindrical vessel and is rotating around a vertical axis coinciding with the axis of the cylinder, the free surface will assume a parabolic surface of revolution known as a paraboloid. The free surface at each point is at a right angle to the force acting at it, which is the resultant of the force of gravity and the centrifugal force from the motion of each point in a circle. Since the main mirror in a telescope must be parabolic, this principle is used to create liquid-mirror telescopes. Consider a cylindrical container filled with liquid rotating in the z direction in cylindrical coordinates, the equations of motion are: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial P}{\\\\partial r} = \\\\rho r \\\\omega^2, \\\\quad \\\\frac{\\\\partial P}{\\\\partial \\\\theta} = 0, \\\\quad \\\\frac{\\\\partial P}{\\\\partial z} = -\\\\rho g, where \\\\rho is the density of the fluid, r is the radius of the cylinder, \\\\omega is the angular frequency, and g is the gravitational acceleration. Taking a surface of constant pressure (dP = 0) the total differential becomes : dP = \\\\rho r \\\\omega^2 dr - \\\\rho g dz \\\\to \\\\frac{dz_\\\\text{isobar}}{dr} = \\\\frac{r \\\\omega^2}{g}. Integrating, the equation for the free surface becomes : z_s = \\\\frac{\\\\omega^2}{2g} r^2 + h_c, where h_c is the distance of the free surface from the bottom of the container along the axis of rotation. If one integrates the volume of the paraboloid formed by the free surface and then solves for the original height, one can find the height of the fluid along the centerline of the cylindrical container: : h_c = h_0 - \\\\frac{\\\\omega^2 R^2}{4g}. The equation of the free surface at any distance r from the center becomes : z_s = h_0 - \\\\frac{\\\\omega^2}{4g} (R^2 - 2 r^2). If a free liquid is rotating about an axis, the free surface will take the shape of an oblate spheroid: the approximate shape of the Earth due to its equatorial bulge. Related terms *In hydrodynamics, the free surface is defined mathematically by the free-surface condition, that is, the material derivative on the pressure is zero: ::\\\\ \\\\frac{Dp}{Dt} = 0. *In fluid dynamics, a free- surface vortex, also known as a potential vortex or whirlpool, forms in an irrotational flow, for example when a bathtub is drained. *In naval architecture and marine safety, the free surface effect occurs when liquids or granular materials under a free surface in partially filled tanks or holds shift when the vessel heels. *In hydraulic engineering a free-surface jet is one where the entrainment of the fluid outside the jet is minimal, as opposed to submerged jet where the entrainment effect is significant. A liquid jet in air approximates a free surface jet. *In fluid mechanics a free surface flow, also called open channel flow, is the gravity driven flow of a fluid under a free surface, typically water flowing under air in the atmosphere.

The genus, formally described in 2000, consists of the species P. bahiensis, P. goiasensis, P. minensis, P. tuberosa, P. rhizomatosa, P. maranhensis and P. courensis, each of the first three named for the Brazilian state to which it is endemic. The species are characterized by subterranean stems, peltate leaves at or below the soil surface, and five-lobed calyces. Their habitat has been reported as areas of white sand in the midst of cerrado vegetation at an elevation between 800 and 1450 m. Initial descriptions of the genus included suspicions that the plethora of stalked capitate glands on the upper surfaces of leaves was an indication that these species may be carnivorous. A study published in 2007 tested P. minensis for protease activity, a typical test for the carnivorous syndrome, and could detect none. Later studies detected other digestive enzymes such as phosphatases and qualitatively assessed prey digestion and nutrient uptake, suggesting that it is a true carnivorous plant. The genus epithet honors David Philcox, a botanist at Kew Gardens who worked extensively in tropical Scrophulariaceae.Fritsch, P.W., Almeda, F., Martins, A.B., Cruz, B.C., and Estes, D. (2007). Rediscovery and phylogenetic placement of Philcoxia minensis (Plantaginaceae), with a test of carnivory. Proceedings of the California Academy of Sciences, Fourth Series, 58(21): 447-467.Taylor, P., Souza, V.C., Giulietti, A.M., and Harley, R.M. (2000). Philcoxia: A new genus of Scrophulariaceae with three new species from Eastern Brazil. Kew Bulletin, 55(1): 155-163.  Description  Members of the genus are small perennial or annual herbs that reside in oases of deep white sand surrounded by the typical vegetation of the cerrado ecoregion. They are no more than 26 cm tall with 5-10 leaves. Zigzag-shaped racemes are produced from upright stems and account for the height of the species. These monotelic inflorescences are leafless and produce pale blue to lilac flowers (P. goiasensis has a yellow corolla tube). The flowers possess monothecous, glabrous anthers, which are unusual in the family. The upper surface of the leaves are covered with stalked capitate glands that are also seen in many carnivorous plant genera.  Taxonomy  The nature of Philcoxia's highly specialized morphology has led to confusion about its proper taxonomic placement. In 1996, before Philcoxia was even formally published as a taxon, it had been placed by Vin√≠cius Souza in the tribe Scrophularieae of the Scrophulariaceae. Peter Taylor et al. later noted in the 2000 description of the genus that its affinities should include the genera Gratiola and Dopatrium in the tribe Gratioleae of the Scrophulariaceae. The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group later changed the circumscription of the Scrophulariaceae so that the tribe Gratioleae is now within the Plantaginaceae. In 2004, E. Fischer also placed in tribe Gratioleae, but also placed it within the informally recognized subtribe Dopatriinae, which was described as also containing the genera Deinostema, Dopatrium, Hydrotriche, and Limnophila, which consist mostly of aquatic species. In 2007, an extensive study and phylogenetic analysis by Peter Fritsch et al. confirmed that Philcoxia should be placed in the tribe Gratioleae, but it is in fact not as closely related to Gratiola and the Dopatriinae as was previously assumed. Recent research has suggested that P. minensis may be polyphyletic, so may represent more than one species.  Botanical history  The first recognized specimens of Philcoxia (P. bahiensis) were collected by local resident Wilson Ganev in August 1992 from the Serra do Atalho in the municipality of Piat√£ of Bahia. One collection was sent to Kew Gardens for naming. Because of its placentation, the specimen was determined to be a member of the Scrophulariaceae (later Plantaginaceae sensu APG II) despite its appearance close to that of terrestrial Utricularia. Material of this specimen had been sent to Vin√≠cius Souza, who was working on the Scrophulariaceae of Brazil. Souza recognized the material as congeneric with a plant collected in 1981 from the Serra do Cabral of the Brazilian state Minas Gerais. The collection was made by a group from the University of S√£o Paulo. The site location of that collection was not identified and subsequent expeditions were unable to relocate the species until 2007. However, an even earlier specimen now recognized as P. goiasensis had been collected in 1966 near Posse in the northeastern state of Goi√°s by a group from the New York Botanical Garden. Initially, the specimen had been determined to be a member of the Lentibulariaceae. Peter Taylor and David Philcox later concluded that this represented an undescribed genus of Scrophulariaceae. A description and illustration was completed and set aside for over twenty years. Then, in 1994, Taylor showed the specimen and description to Ray Harley in preparation for publication. Harley, who had been involved in the early 1990s discovery of P. bahiensis, recognized Taylor's materials as another species of the as yet undescribed genus.  Carnivory  Peter Taylor, in his 2000 description of the genus, suggested that the morphology Philcoxia resembles that of the carnivorous Lentibulariaceae and the relatively unrelated Droseraceae in some aspects. The upper surface of the leaves are covered in stalked capitate glands similar to those seen in other carnivorous plants. Taylor noted that field observations had not indicated that there was any carnivorous function of the leaves, citing a lack of captured prey as evidence. Peter Fritsch and his coauthors decided to do a more comprehensive test for carnivory on P. minensis after they observed nematode worms on leaf surfaces. The similarity between the habitat for Philcoxia species and that of Genlisea and their similar subterranean leaves and stems spurred the team's decision to test for potential carnivory in the field and in situ. They tested for a protease enzyme that is one of the enzymes found in other carnivorous plants and is responsible for breaking down captured prey. They hypothesized that Philcoxia could be carnivorous, capturing nematodes and possibly soil microbes like Utricularia and Genlisea do. Ultimately, Fritsch's study concluded that while no protease activity was detected, this fact does not rule out the possibility that the genus may be carnivorous in some other way. They note that there are many possibilities, such as seasonal carnivory or the unusual growth form being an adaptation to the heat and sun, and more study is needed before precise conclusions can be reached. A study by Caio G. Pereira et al. published in 2012 provided experimental evidence using 15N-labeled nematodes, concluding that P. minensis actively digests prey and absorbs the nutrients. This data was combined with the observation that the leaf surfaces of P. minensis produce phosphatases, similar to many other carnivorous plants.Pereira, CG, DP Almenara, CE Winter, PW Fritsch, H Lambers, and RS Oliveira. 2012. Underground leaves of Philcoxia trap and digest nematodes. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, published online ahead of print. The similarity in structures in all the species of this genus suggest that all species are carnivorous.  References   External links  *Plantaginaceae at the Angiosperm Phylogeny Website.

Joseph Babinski first used the term anosodiaphoria in 1914 to describe a disorder of the body schema in which patients verbally acknowledge a clinical problem (such as hemiparesis) but fail to be concerned about it.Prigatano, G. (1991). Awareness of deficit after brain injury: clinical and theoretical issues. New York, New York: Oxford University Press. Anosodiaphoria follows a stage of anosognosia, in which there may be verbal, explicit denial of the illness, and after several days to weeks, develop the lack of emotional response.Prigatano, G. (2010). The study of anosognosia. New York, New York: Oxford University Press. Indifference is different from denial because it implies a lack of caring on the part of the patient, who otherwise acknowledges his or her deficit. Causes A few possible explanations for anosodiaphoria exist: # The patient is aware of the deficit but does not fully comprehend it or its significance for functioning # May be related to an affective communication disorder and defective arousal. These emotional disorders cannot account for the verbal explicit denial of illness of anosognosia.Prigatano, G. (1991). Awareness of deficit after brain injury: clinical and theoretical issues. New York, New York: Oxford University Press https://books.google.com/books?id=xze89PCLaWMC&printsec;=frontcover#v=onepage&q;&f;=false. Other explanations include reduced emotional experience, impaired emotional communication, alexithymia, behavioral abnormalities, dysexecutive syndrome, and the frontal lobes.Prigatano, G. (2010). The study of anosognosia. New York, New York: Oxford University Press. Neurology Anosodiaphoria occurs after stroke of the brain. 27% of patients suffering from an acute hemispheric stroke suffer the stroke in the right hemisphere, while 2% suffer it in their left.Stone, S.P. Halligan, P.W., and Greenwood, R.J. (1993). The incidence of neglect phenomenon and related disorders in patients with an acute right or left hemisphere stroke. Age and Aging, 22, 46-52. Anosodiaphoria is thought to be related to unilateral neglect, a condition often found after damage to the non-dominant (usually the right) hemisphere of the cerebral cortex in which sufferers seem unable to attend to, or sometimes comprehend, anything on a certain side of their body (usually the left). The frontal lobe is thought to be the primary area for the lack of emotional insight seen in anosodiaphoria, such as in frontotemporal dementia. A recent 2011 study done by Mendez and Shapira found that people suffering from frontotemporal dementia also had a loss of insight more properly described at \\"frontal anosodiaphoria\\", a lack of concern for proper self-appraisal. Patients were found to have a lack of emotional updating, or concern for having an illness; an absence of an emotional self-referent tagging of information on their disorder, which they think is possibly from disease in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate-anterior insula area, especially on the right.Mendez, M.F. & Shapira, J.S. (2011). Loss of emotional insight in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia or \\"frontal anosodiaphoria\\".Consciousness and Cognition, 20(4), 1690-1696. Treatment Indifference to illness may have an adverse impact on a patient's engagement in neurological rehabilitation, cognitive rehabilitation and physical rehabilitation. Patients are not likely to implement rehabilitation for a condition about which they are indifferent. Although anosognosia often resolves in days to weeks after stroke, anosodiaphoria often persists.Barrett, A.M., Buxbaum, L.J., Coslett, H.B., Edwards, E., Heilman, K.M., Hillis, A.E., Milberg, W.P., and Robertson, I.H. (2006). Cognitive rehabilitation interventions for neglect and related disorders: moving from bench to bedside in stroke patients. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 18(7), 1223-1236. Therefore, the therapist has to be creative in their rehabilitation approach in order to maintain the interest of the patient.

The encounter took place outside Japanese territorial waters, but within the exclusive economic zone, an area extending from Japanese land, within which Japan can claim exclusive rights to fishing and mineral resources. Background An unidentified ship was spotted in Japanese waters on 21 December 2001. The armed trawler was detected by a communications station in Kikaijima, Kagoshima, which was under control of the Japanese Defense Intelligence Headquarters. In 1999, another North Korean vessel encountered by the Japanese Coast Guard was claimed by Japan to have been a spy craft, though North Korea denied it. Battle Dual hatch found in the stern of the North Korean spy trawler. Early the following morning, the ship was chased by four Japan Coast Guard vessels, who ordered it to halt, and fired 25 warning shots upon the ship when those orders were ignored. A six- hour firefight ensued, in which over 1,000 machine gun rounds were fired by both sides; the North Korean crew were said to have wielded shoulder-held rocket launchers. The North Korean trawler was meanwhile hit by a number of rounds. Several explosions not directly related to Japanese attacks rocked the ship before it was sunk. According to The Guardian, \\"fifteen survivors were seen clinging to a buoy in heavy seas, but the Japanese ships were ordered to ignore them because of fears that they would use force to resist capture\\". Two bodies were recovered, thirteen more persons were declared missing and presumed dead several days later. Ship is exhibited in the Yokohama marine disaster prevention base. The Special Boarding Unit was mobilized to board the ship, but did not do so as they had to wait for official orders from the Japanese Defense Agency. The ship sank before such orders arrived. Aftermath In 2003 the trawler was raised by the Japanese to confirm her origin and intentions. Inspection of the hull determined she was of North Korean origin and most likely an infiltration and spy vessel. It was revealed that the vessel was camouflaged as a Chinese or Japanese fishing boat and that she could go , far faster than any commercial trawler. The ship had also a hidden double hatch in the stern to be used as an exit door for speedboats. After the inspections were deemed complete the hull was displayed at the Japan Coast Guard Museum Yokohama in Yokohama, where she has become a popular tourist attraction.

Koenigia is a genus of plants in the family Polygonaceae. The genus Aconogonon has been merged into Koenigia. Description Species of Koenigia are annual or perennial herbaceous plants, growing from taproots. The flowers are arranged in terminal or axillary inflorescences. The flowers have pale tepals: white, greenish to yellowish white or pink. The seeds are borne in achenes that are usually brown or black in colour and not winged. Taxonomy The genus Koenigia was erected by Carl Linnaeus in 1767, initially for the type species Koenigia islandica. The boundaries between genera in the family Polygonaceae, and the relationships among them, have long been a problem. At one time, many species were placed in the genus Polygonum. Koenigia is placed in the subfamily Polygonoideae, tribe Persicarieae, whose taxonomic history has been described as \\"exceptionally convoluted, even by Polygonaceae standards\\". A molecular phylogenetic study of the subfamily Polygonoideae in 2015 showed that the genus Koenigia was polyphyletic with respect to the genus Aconogonon. An earlier study had reached a similar conclusion, and had suggested that extra genera be created to maintain monophyletic taxa. The authors of the 2015 study preferred the alternative of merging the two genera, a proposal accepted by other sources.

Initially, it only served students in grades seven and eight. After one year of operation, the school's enrollment greatly increased, and grades nine and ten were later added. In 1984, grade eleven classes were offered under the name of Denis Morris Catholic High School, Kerwin Campus. In September 1985, the school was renamed as Holy Cross Secondary School. Grade twelve classes were also offered, while grades seven and eight were eliminated. However, in 1993, due to overpopulation, Holy Cross relocated to the nearby former Grantham High School building on Linwell Road. The former Holy Cross building later became Saint Francis Catholic Secondary School, due to additional increase in student enrollment.

It has also been known as Tappan, which referred to the wider region of the New Jersey Palisades, rising above the river on both sides of the New York/New Jersey state line, and to the indigenous people who lived there and were part of wider group known as Lenape (later called Delaware Indian). It was established in 1640 by David Pietersen de Vries (c. 1593-c.1655), a Dutch sea captain, explorer, and trader who had also established settlements at the Zwaanendael Colony and on Staten Island. The name can roughly be translated as De Vries' Valley. De Vries also owned flatlands along the Hackensack River, in the area named by the Dutch settlers Achter Col. Parts of Vriessendael were destroyed in 1643 in reprisal for the slaughter of Tappan and Wecquaesgeek Native Americans who had taken refuge at Pavonia and Corlears Hook. The patroon's relatively good relations with the Lenape prevented the murder of the plantation's residents, who were able to seek sanctuary in the main house, and later flee to New Amsterdam.

Plot A Select Committee of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom meets to discuss a ridiculous scandal on which the tabloid press has begun focusing. The papers allege that some mystery woman has accused 128 members of the House of sexual promiscuity. The six members of the Committee look into it so as to maintain the House's good name. Ironically, each member of the committee reminds the secretary, Miss. Madeleine Gotobed, not to bring up their most recent rendezvous. They do not want the press to get the wrong idea. It turns out that the secretary, who is not very adept at dictation, is the woman who has been spotted with all of these men. The curtain falls and then rises again for New-Found-Land in which an older and a younger man, two Home Office officials, briefly discuss the naturalization of an American into British citizenship (based on the real-life naturalization of the play's director, ED Berman MBE). They laud the American nation as a whole, including every American patriotic clich√© they can remember. Eventually, the Select Committee returns and tries to reclaim its room. The play ends with Maddie and M.P. French passing a new report that clears all men of having done wrong. Reception Christopher Hahn unfavorably compared Dirty Linen with Stoppard's earlier short plays The Real Inspector Hound and After Magritte, writing that it \\"establishes no special relationship with the audience, nor does it make use of particular theatrical conventions, or even parody to any great extent the genre of the sex farce, surely fruitful ground for Stoppard's ironic talent. Instead, the play is a fairly straightforward duplication of a recognisable type, with the slight difference that assumptions about the dumb blonde usually prominent in this kind of play are overturned\\".

In geometric topology it was introduced by and is often called the Mazur swindle. In algebra it was introduced by Samuel Eilenberg and is known as the Eilenberg swindle or Eilenberg telescope (see telescoping sum). The Eilenberg‚ÄìMazur swindle is similar to the following well known joke \\"proof\\" that 1 = 0: : 1 = 1 + (‚àí1 + 1) + (‚àí1 + 1) + ... = 1 ‚àí 1 + 1 ‚àí 1 + ... = (1 ‚àí 1) + (1 ‚àí 1) + ... = 0 This \\"proof\\" is not valid as a claim about real numbers because Grandi's series 1 ‚àí 1 + 1 ‚àí 1 + ... does not converge, but the analogous argument can be used in some contexts where there is some sort of \\"addition\\" defined on some objects for which infinite sums do make sense, to show that if A + B = 0 then A = B = 0. Mazur swindle In geometric topology the addition used in the swindle is usually the connected sum of knots or manifolds. Example : A typical application of the Mazur swindle in geometric topology is the proof that the sum of two non-trivial knots A and B is non- trivial. For knots it is possible to take infinite sums by making the knots smaller and smaller, so if A + B is trivial then :A=A+(B+A)+(B+A)+\\\\cdots = (A+B)+(A+B)+\\\\cdots=0\\\\, so A is trivial (and B by a similar argument). The infinite sum of knots is usually a wild knot, not a tame knot. See for more geometric examples. Example: The oriented n-manifolds have an addition operation given by connected sum, with 0 the n-sphere. If A + B is the n-sphere, then A + B + A + B + ... is Euclidean space so the Mazur swindle shows that the connected sum of A and Euclidean space is Euclidean space, which shows that A is the 1-point compactification of Euclidean space and therefore A is homeomorphic to the n-sphere. (This does not show in the case of smooth manifolds that A is diffeomorphic to the n-sphere, and in some dimensions, such as 7, there are examples of exotic spheres A with inverses that are not diffeomorphic to the standard n-sphere.) Eilenberg swindle In algebra the addition used in the swindle is usually the direct sum of modules over a ring. Example: A typical application of the Eilenberg swindle in algebra is the proof that if A is a projective module over a ring R then there is a free module F with A ‚äï F ‚âÖ F.Lam (1999), Corollary 2.7, p. 22; Eklof & Mekler (2002), Lemma 2.3, [ p. 9]. To see this, choose a module B such that A ‚äï B is free, which can be done as A is projective, and put :F = B ‚äï A ‚äï B ‚äï A ‚äï B ‚äï .... so that :A ‚äï F = A ‚äï (B ‚äï A) ‚äï (B ‚äï A) ‚äï ... = (A ‚äï B) ‚äï (A ‚äï B) ‚äï ... ‚âÖ F. Example: Finitely generated free modules over commutative rings R have a well-defined natural number as their dimension which is additive under direct sums, and are isomorphic if and only if they have the same dimension. This is false for some noncommutative rings, and a counterexample can be constructed using the Eilenberg swindle as follows. Let X be an abelian group such that X ‚âÖ X ‚äï X (for example the direct sum of an infinite number of copies of any nonzero abelian group), and let R be the ring of endomorphisms of X. Then the left R-module R is isomorphic to the left R-module R ‚äï R. Example: If A and B are any groups then the Eilenberg swindle can be used to construct a ring R such that the group rings R[A] and R[B] are isomorphic rings: take R to be the group ring of the restricted direct product of infinitely many copies of A ‚®Ø B. Other examples The proof of the Cantor‚ÄìBernstein‚ÄìSchroeder theorem might be seen as antecedent of the Eilenberg‚ÄìMazur swindle. In fact, the ideas are quite similar. If there are injections of sets from X to Y and from Y to X, this means that formally we have X=Y+A and Y=X+B for some sets A and B, where + means disjoint union and = means there is a bijection between two sets. Expanding the former with the latter, :X = X + A + B. In this bijection, let Z consist of those elements of the left hand side that correspond to an element of X on the right hand side. This bijection then expands to the bijection :X = A + B + A + B + ... + Z. Substituting the right hand side for X in Y = B + X gives the bijection :Y = B + A + B + A + ... + Z. Switching every adjacent pair B + A yields :Y = A + B + A + B + ... + Z. Composing the bijection for X with the inverse of the bijection for Y then yields :X = Y. This argument depended on the bijections A + B = B + A and A + (B + C) = (A + B) + C as well as the well-definedness of infinite disjoint union.

Storylines Leonard is the son of Adrian Degenhardt (Klaus Zmorek) and the late Francesca von Lahnstein. He is also the brother of Constantin von Lahnstein (Milan Marcus) and the half-brother of Carla von Lahnstein (Claudia Hiersche). Until 2007 he believed that Johannes von Lahnstein (Thomas Gumpert) was his real father, but a letter from his late mother Francesca sheds another light on his paternity. A DNA test proves that Adrian is indeed his biological father. Leonard is the favorite son of his father Johannes. When he comes home from Chicago, where he worked as doctor, he meets the beautiful C√©cile de Maron (Yvonne Burbach) and knows from the beginning that she is the love of his life. He arrives at K√∂nigsbrunn and it turns out, that C√©cile is Johannes's new wife. Soon, Leonard and C√©cile have to deal with their feelings for each other. They try to deny their love, and Leonard even marries his former love Silke Voss (Annette Culp) to prove that he can live without C√©cile. But his marriage falls apart when Silke sees that Leonard is in love with C√©cile. Johannes also tries to come between Leonard and C√©cile's love. When he finds out they had an affair, Johannes files for divorce and wants Leonard out of his life. C√©cile tries to bring them back together when she finds out that she is pregnant and hopes that Johannes finds a way to be a grandfather to their child, but Johannes refuses. Just a few days after marrying Leonard, C√©cile and her unborn son, Julius, die after a car accident. Johannes comes to Leonard and comforts him when he needs him most. Leonard soon becomes addicted to pain killers and is haunted by memories of C√©cile. His family and friends try to help him and he finally sees that it's worth living again.

Its common name is slender-horned spineflower. This is a small annual plant forming a patch of spreading basal leaves a few centimeters in diameter, or slightly larger when more moisture is available. It bolts an erect stalk upon which it bears inflorescences of flowers. Each group of white or pink flowers is enclosed in a tiny cup of fused bracts which is only a few millimeters wide. The fruit is a dark achene about 2 millimeters long. This plant grows in the silt-rich floodplains and washes of the foothills of the Transverse Ranges and the Peninsular Ranges of southern California. It is known from fewer than 40 reported sightings, many of which were in locations that have since been claimed for development or otherwise altered.

It was written in 1765, shortly before Haydn's Sturm und Drang period began in 1766, during his social withdrawal at Esterh√°za. It is the second minor-key symphony he ever wrote, the first being his Symphony No. 26.  Scoring  The scoring of the symphony is typical of Haydn in this period: two oboes, bassoon, two horns, strings and continuo.  Theatrical origins  It is possible that this symphony is the one referred to in an inscription accompanying Haydn's Symphony No. 49 (La passione) which reads: questa Sinfonia (i.e. 49) serve di Compagna a quella / del Philosopho Inglese dell' istesso autore. (This symphony serves as a companion to the \\"English Philosopher\\" by the same author.) The English Philosopher or II filosofo inglese, was a play written in 1754 by Carlo Goldoni. It was performed at Vienna's Karntnerthortheater in December 1764 in German translation under the title Die Philosophinnen, oder Hannswurst, der Cavalier in London zu seinen Ungl√ºcke, and featured two mock-Quakers as characters. The provenance of Symphony no. 49 is likely also to have originated as a theatrical piece for a German translation of Nicolas Chamfort's popular play La jeune indienne which also featured overly solemn Quakers for comedic purposes. This symphony is the only one that shares exactly the same movement plan as Symphony No. 49, namely an extended sonata-form opening Adagio in 3/4 time; an Allegro di molto with a wide-leap principal theme; a Minuet and a Presto finale. The symphony is homotonal (i.e. all movements are in the same tonic), following the custom associated with the sonata di chiesa. The thematic similarity in musical style combined with the conjuncture of character portrayals in both Chamfort's and Goldoni's works suggests a deliberate use of musical themes to portray theatrical elements common to both. Further, the jig motif of the finale was associated with an English style.  Movements  The four movements follow the what was by then archaic Sonata da chiesa pattern: slow-quick-slow (minuet)-quick. #Adagio, #Allegro, #Menuet ‚Äì Trio, #Presto assai, Only the slow first movement ‚Äì which is almost as long as the other three movements combined ‚Äì is in D minor, the rest of the symphony is in sunny D major. Because of this, the piece is sometimes denoted with two key signatures (i.e. D minor/D major). Since all of the movements have the same tonic, the work is homotonal.

It was built upon the Theological Assistance Program (TAP) which had been created following a decision of WEF in May 1968 to support and strengthen theological education in the Third World. TAP had already become a catalyst for developing programs of Theological Education by Extension in several areas, assisting faculty development and publishing materials for theological educators and students. An association to promote its work in Asia (later Asia Theological Association) was also established in 1971. The successful inauguration of these activities meant that the WEF Theological Commission could be established at the 6th General Assembly of WEF in mid-1974, with an eleven-man international executive. The first full scale consultation was held in London September 1975 with the theme, \\"The Church and Nation\\". In subsequent years several consultations were conducted, sometimes in cooperation with other bodies, such as the Lausanne Theology Working Group (LTWG), with the papers usually being published in book form. Important consultations were held in 1980 with multiple conferences on topics such as development and the simple life style, which was followed in 1982 by the influential Consultation on the Relationship between Evangelism and Social Responsibility (CRESR). Equally important was the 1983 conference on the \\"Nature and Mission of the Church\\". The Executive met annually, with a larger number of people forming the Commission, meeting triennially. Bruce Nicholls continued his role as Executive Director until 1986. During this time he travelled extensively around the world, networking, developing ways of assisting theological education and raising funds. One of the important functions of the Commission was to encourage the formation of organisations to accredit evangelical theological education, which later formed their own association, the International Council of Accrediting Associations (ICAA) (now International Council for Evangelical Theological Education ICETE). Another important function of the TC was the establishment of Study Units (Faith and Church, Ethics and Society etc.) headed up by key theologians such as Dr Donald A Carson and Dr Ronald Sider. Their consultations and publications contributed greatly to the development of evangelical thinking and action around the world. It also inaugurated the journal of social ethics, Transformation, which later passed to other auspices. The TC also engaged in a long dialogue with the Roman Catholic Church. Its publication work developed strongly in the 1977 with the creation of the journal, Evangelical Review of Theology (ERT), which was originally designed as a digest of international evangelical theology in various fields particularly aimed at seminaries and church leaders in the Third World who were unable to access a wide range of journals. Already a quarterly newsletter, Theological News, had been in circulation since the inception of the organisation. When Dr Bruce Nicholls concluded his leadership of the Theological Commission in 1986 to spend his remaining years before retirement in pastoral work at a parish in New Delhi, he was succeeded by Dr Sunand Sumithra (1986‚Äì1989) and later by Dr Bong Rin Ro (1989‚Äì1996). Chairmen of the TC Executive were Dr Byang Kato (1975), Dr A. Clemenhaga (1975‚Äì1980), and Dr David Gitari (1980‚Äì1986). With the appointment of a new Executive Director, Dr Peter Kuzmic (1986‚Äì1996) took over as chair, and after a ten-year period of office, he was succeeded by Dr. Rolf Hille in 1996. For most of his term, Hille has served the dual role of Chair and Executive Director, apart from 1998-2001 when Dr James Stamoolis was Executive Director, and then again from 2007 when Dr David Parker took up that role. At its peak, the TC grew to about fifty members with members drawn from all continents, but in more recent years it has been about twelve in number with an annual paid extended membership scheme in operation which enables individuals, seminaries and national evangelical fellowship to participate directly in its work. Consultations and related publications have focused on \\"The Unique Christ in our Pluralistic World\\" (1992), \\"Faith and Hope for the Future\\" (1996). Since about 2000, the WEA Theological Commission has conducted short consultations on topics such as fundamentalism, the church, theological education, the future of evangelical theology, and evangelical political engagement; it has published material on the environment and eschatology, conducted dialogues with other religious groups, and worked with other evangelical bodies to develop theological materials to pursue its mission of promoting \\"biblical truth by networking theologians to serve the church in obedience to Christ\\". As of November 2017, Dr. Thomas Schirrmacher is Chair and Dr. Rosalee Veloso Ewell is Executive Director of the WEA TC.

After graduating from Harvard University in 1929, Carlton began work with the Federal Relief Administration, where he worked with self-help cooperatives in California. In this context he was assigned by the Roosevelt Administration to lead a successful project to determine whether it was feasible to develop an alternative mutual self-help economy, in part based on barter, to the conventional economy in which many people were homeless and starving in spite of having skills and being ready to work. In 1935, Carlton married Margaret Gillies, the national director of the Self-Help Cooperative Service.Saxon, Wolfgang. Obituaries: Winslow Carlton, Official of Agencies And Fund Chief, 86. New York Times. December 8, 1994. Upton Sinclair used Carlton as the model for his protagonist in his 1936 novel, Co-op: a Novel of Living Together. As in many historical novels, some of the motives attributed by the author to the protagonist were not those of the real person, a source of frustration for Carlton. In 1938, Carlton founded Group Health Insurance, the first community based, non-profit insurance plan. Later it expanded to include the first dental insurance plan and the first mental health insurance plan. He later founded Health Insurance Plan of New York City, a non-profit insurance plan for city employees, the first HMO in the Eastern United States, and second in the United States as a whole. In the political domain, Carlton worked on Medicare/Medicaid legislation with Senator Jacob Javitz. Carlton was a founding partner along with Alfred Jones in AW Jones, the first hedge fund. Modern hedge funds are based on different principles than this early fund, but they use the same term to describe themselves as organizations. AW Jones at the time was based on economic principles of \\"hedging\\" one's financial commitments with countervailing commitments in a way that led to optimized expected profit. Carlton was on the board of Henry Street Settlement House internal Henry Street Settlement in New York City from 1931 on, was President, chairman of the board and director until 1978. He was founder and chairman in New York of Mobilization for Youth, which became a national model for anti-poverty programs for the inner city. Carlton was also a founder in Washington, D.C. of the Foundation for Cooperative Housing which established cooperatives so that lower income working people could afford homes of their own. With the help of Congress, FCH established a revolving fund that covered the capital costs of establishing housing. People who were selected joined a cooperative that owned the housing, paying their costs of membership over time. This proved to be a particularly successful model because co-op members were highly motivated to succeed in their lives once they had a homestead to protect and build upon, and because the approach cost the government nothing once the revolving fund had been established. In the final decade of his life, Winslow Carlton co-founded and served as president of Selcore Labs, where a new a-cellular pertussis vaccine was developed and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. With its name changed to NAVAC North American Vaccine Company, the company went public and was later acquired by Baxter. Carlton died of cancer at his home in Woods Hole, Massachusetts on December 6, 1994.

Abnormal psychology in clinical psychology studies the nature of psychopathology, its causes, and its treatments. Of course, the definition of what constitutes 'abnormal' has varied across time and across cultures. Individuals also vary in what they regard as normal or abnormal behavior. In general, abnormal psychology can be described as an area of psychology that studies people who are consistently unable to adapt and function effectively in a variety of conditions. The main contributing factors to how well an individual is able to adapt include their genetic makeup, physical condition, learning and reasoning, and socialization.  Nature of abnormal psychology   What type of thing is abnormal psychology? Abnormal psychology can be described as all of the following: * An academic discipline - focused study in one academic field or profession. A discipline incorporates expertise, people, projects, communities, challenges, studies, inquiry, and research areas that are strongly associated with a given discipline. * One of the social sciences - concerned with society and the relationships among individuals within a society. ** A branch of psychology - study of mind and behavior. * An applied science - discipline of science that applies existing scientific knowledge to develop more practical applications, like treating the mentally ill.

Stress fields are widely used in fluid dynamics and materials science. Consider that one can picture the stress fields as the stress created by adding an extra half plane of atoms to a crystal. The bonds are clearly stretched around the location of the dislocation and this stretching causes the stress field to form. Atomic bonds farther and farther away from the dislocation centre are less and less stretched which is why the stress field dissipates as the distance from the dislocation centre increases. Each dislocation within the material has a stress field associated with it. The creation of these stress fields is a result of the material trying to dissipate mechanical energy that is being exerted on the material. By convention, these dislocations are labelled as either positive or negative depending on whether the stress field of the dislocation is mostly compressive or tensile. By modelling of dislocations and their stress fields as either a positive (compressive field) or negative (tensile field) charges we can understand how dislocations interact with each other in the lattice. If two like fields come in contact with one another they will be repelled by one another. On the other hand, if two opposing charges come into contact with one another they will be attracted to one another. These two interactions will both strengthen the material in different ways. If two equivalently charged fields come in contact and are confined to a particular region, excessive force is needed to overcome the repulsive forces needed to elicit dislocation movement past one another. If two oppositely charged fields come into contact with one another they will merge with one another to form a jog. A jog can be modelled as a potential well that traps dislocations. Thus, excessive force is needed to force the dislocations apart. Since dislocation motion is the primary mechanism behind plastic deformation, increasing the stress required to move dislocations directly increases the yield strength of the material. The theory of stress fields can be applied to various strengthening mechanisms for materials. Stress fields can be created by adding different sized atoms to the lattice (solute strengthening). If a smaller atom is added to the lattice a tensile stress field is created. The atomic bonds are longer due to the smaller radius of the solute atom. Similarly, if a larger atom is added to the lattice a compressive stress field is created. The atomic bonds are shorter due to the larger radius of the solute atom. The stress fields created by adding solute atoms form the basis of the material strengthening process that occurs in alloys.

Benedict has systematically touched upon the three theological virtues: love in 2005 Deus caritas est (\\"God is Love\\"), hope in this encyclical, and faith in 2013 Lumen fidei (\\"The Light of Faith\\"), written with Pope Francis. The encyclical contains over 18,900 words, divided into fifty paragraphs, and organized into an introduction and eight chapters. Title As is customary for papal encyclicals, the Latin title of Spe salvi comes from its incipit, which quotes St. Paul's Epistle to the Romans: \\"For we are saved by hope. But hope that is seen is not hope. For what a man seeth, why doth he hope for?\\" In the introduction of the encyclical, Benedict sets the tone of his text by asking about the relationship between hope and redemption. Summary Benedict sees \\"a distinguishing mark of Christians the fact that they have a future: it is not that they know the details of what awaits them, but they know in general terms that their life will not end in emptiness.\\"Pope Benedict XVI. Spe Salvi, ¬ß2, Libreria Editrice Vaticana, November 30, 2007 According to Richard Neuhaus, Benedict argues \\"...that hope is faith disposed toward the future, and making all the difference in the present.\\"Neuhaus, Richard John. \\"Saved in Hope: Benedict‚Äôs Second Encyclical\\", First Things, February 2008 Content Benedict traces relationship between the Christian concept of hope and redemption. The first six chapters are theological in nature, but often use historical examples to highlight applications to daily life. Benedict starts by quoting St. Paul's reminder to the early Church community that before converting to Christianity, they were \\"without hope and without God in the world\\" (Epistle to the Ephesians ). Benedict relates the story of Josephine Bakhita as an example of the contrast between a prior, pagan way of life and the new \\"hopeful\\" Christian life. Josephine, an African saint who lived her early life as a slave, converted to Catholicism after finding \\"the great hope\\" which had \\"redeemed\\" her. She spent the rest of her life as a nun, preaching throughout Italy and was canonized in 2000.Spe Salvi, ¬ß3 Paragraphs four, five, and six describe a series of contrasts that serve to clearly define Christ's role as revolutionary in the Roman empire and its implications for Christians. Benedict draws clear distinction between the failed socio- political revolutions or liberations of Spartacus, Barabbas, and Bar-Kochba with \\"the new (non-political) hope\\" of Jesus. He concludes that Jesus brought \\"an encounter with the Lord of all lords, an encounter with the living God and thus an encounter with a hope stronger than the sufferings of slavery, a hope which transformed life and the world from within\\", something that these revolutionaries could not. These paragraphs recall Benedict's persistent rejection of Marxism and Liberation Theology throughout his teachings and specifically in Deus caritas est.Paragraphs 26-27 Benedict then draws on early Christian sarcophagi representations of Jesus as philosopher and shepherd to illustrate that Christian hope extends beyond this life on earth. The Good Shepherd, who has himself passed through death, guides his followers beyond it, so that death itself is not something to be feared.Corkery S. J., James. \\"On Christian Hope: The New Encyclical of Pope Benedict XVI\\", Thinking Faith, January 18, 2008 In paragraph seven, he proceeds to link hope and redemption to the theological virtue of faith by analyzing the Greek and Latin translation of: Est autem fides sperandarum substantia rerum, argumentum non apparentium. (\\"[F]aith is the ‚Äúsubstance‚Äù of things hoped for; the proof of things not seen.\\") \\"Eternal life ‚Äì what is it?\\" Benedict deals with the topic of eternal life, explaining that it is not a mere prolongation of existence but the blissful completion of life. He points out that in the baptismal rite the parents presenting the child ask for faith because faith brings eternal life. > Perhaps many people reject the faith today simply because they do not find > the prospect of eternal life attractive. What they desire is not eternal > life at all, but this present life, for which faith in eternal life seems > something of an impediment. To continue living for ever ‚Äîendlessly‚Äîappears > more like a curse than a gift. Death, admittedly, one would wish to postpone > for as long as possible. But to live always, without end‚Äîthis, all things > considered, can only be monotonous and ultimately unbearable.Spe Salvi, ¬ß10 He then references St. Ambrose's funeral oration for his brother Satyrus:‚ÄúDeath was not part of nature; it became part of nature. God did not decree death from the beginning; he prescribed it as a remedy. Human life, because of sin ... began to experience the burden of wretchedness in unremitting labour and unbearable sorrow. There had to be a limit to its evils; ...Without the assistance of grace, immortality is more of a burden than a blessing‚Äù.St. Ambrose. \\"De excessu fratris sui Satyri\\", II, 47: CSEL 73, 274 In the next chapter, \\"Is Christian hope individualistic?\\", he mentions theologians like Henri de Lubac and such mystics as Augustine of Hippo, Bernard of Clairvaux, and Benedict of Nursia. In the chapter \\"The transformation of Christian faith-hope in the modern age\\", Francis Bacon, Immanuel Kant, Friedrich Engels and Karl Marx appear with respect to the relationship between faith and reason. In the chapter \\"The true shape of Christian hope\\" Benedict cites Vladimir Lenin, Karl Marx and Theodor W. Adorno, while in \\"Settings for learning and practising hope\\" he mentions with reference to, among others, Cardinal Nguyen Van Thuan, the philosopher Max Horkheimer, Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Plato. The encyclical closes with the chapter \\"Mary, Star of Hope\\".

What type of thing is acting?  Acting can be described as all of the following: * one of the arts ‚Äì ** a performing art ‚Äì form of art in which artists use their voices, bodies or inanimate objects to convey artistic expression. It is different from visual arts, which is when artists use paint, canvas or various materials to create physical or static art objects. Performing arts include a range of disciplines which are performed in front of a live audience.  Acting techniques  *Classical acting ‚Äì philosophy of acting that integrates the expression of the body, voice, imagination, personalizing, improvisation, external stimuli, and script analysis. It is based on the theories and systems of select classical actors and directors including Konstantin Stanislavski and Michel Saint-Denis. * Meisner technique ‚Äì requires the actor to focus totally on the other actor as though he or she is real and they only exist in that moment. This is a method that makes the actors in the scene seem more authentic to the audience. It is based on the principle that acting finds its expression in people's response to other people and circumstances. It is based on Stanislavski's system. * Method acting ‚Äì range of techniques based on for training actors to achieve better characterizations of the characters they play, as formulated by Lee Strasberg. Strasberg's method is based upon the idea that in order to develop an emotional and cognitive understanding of their roles, actors should use their own experiences to identify personally with their characters. It is based on aspects of Stanislavski's system. * Practical aesthetics ‚Äì acting technique originally conceived by David Mamet and William H.

He wrote one of the few pamphlets published in the South protesting slavery and supporting abolition. In 1816 he helped found the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the first independent black denomination in the United States, at its first national convention in Philadelphia. In 1820, Coker took his family and immigrated to the British colony of Sierra Leone, where he was the first Methodist missionary from a Western nation. There Coker founded the West Africa Methodist Church. He and his descendants continued as leaders among what developed as the Creole people in Sierra Leone. Early life He was born enslaved as Isaac Wright, in 1780 in Baltimore, or Frederick County, Maryland, to Susan Coker, a white woman, and Daniel Wright, an enslaved African American. Under a 1664 Maryland slave law, Wright was considered a slave as his father was enslaved. (Another source said that his mother was an enslaved black and his father white.) Beginning in the colonial period, Maryland had added additional restrictions on unions between white women and black slaves. Under a 1692 Maryland law, white women who had children with slaves would be punished by being sold as indentured servants for seven years and binding their children to serve indentures until the age of twenty-one if the woman was married to the slave (although this was later prohibited by law), and until age thirty-one if she was not married to the father. Growing up in a household with his white Coker half-brothers, Wright attended primary school with them as their valet. A white half-brother was said to have refused to go to school without him. As a teenager, Wright escaped to New York. There he changed his name to Daniel Coker and joined the Methodist Episcopal Church. Coker received a license to preach from Francis Asbury, a British missionary who had immigrated to the United States and planted numerous frontier churches during his career, as well as riding large circuits to minister to people. Coker returned to Baltimore. For a time he passed as his white half-brother. Friends finally helped purchase his freedom from his master, to secure his legal status. As a free black, he could teach at a local school for black children. By this time, Baltimore was a center of a growing population of free blacks, generally free people of color, including a number manumitted after the Revolutionary War. Methodist minister In 1802, Francis Asbury ordained Coker as a deacon in the Methodist Episcopal Church. He actively opposed slavery and wrote pamphlets in protest. In 1810, Coker wrote and published the pamphlet Dialogue between a Virginian and an African minister, described by historian and critic Dorothy Porter as resembling a \\"scholastic dialogue\\". It is noted for its literary quality and because it was one of the few protest pamphlets \\"written and published in the slaveholding South.\\" While working at Sharp Street Church, Coker began to advocate for black Methodists to withdraw from the white-dominated church. He founded the African Bethel Church, which later became known as Bethel A.M.E. Church. In 1807, Coker founded the Bethel Charity School, a school for Black children. One of his significant students was William J. Watkins, an abolitionist who would fight against the ideologies of colonization that Coker participated in. In 1816, Coker traveled to Philadelphia, where he represented his church and collaborated with Richard Allen in organizing the national African Methodist Episcopal Church. It was founded by several congregations as the first independent black denomination in the United States. Coker was elected as the first bishop by the delegates, but he deferred to Allen, who had founded the first AME Church in Philadelphia. Coker represented Bethel A.M.E. Church (founded 1787/1797) in Baltimore. Emigration to Western Africa Early in 1820,Sources give late January or early February for Coker's departure. Daniel Coker sailed for Africa on board the Elizabeth. He was among 86 African-American emigrants assisted by the American Colonization Society (ACS), who wanted to resettle free blacks in West Africa. The passengers on the Elizabeth were the first African-American settlers in what is now Liberia. (Their descendants developed as the Krio people.) Coker was one of four AME missionaries on the Elizabeth. In transit and ten days from New York, he organized the first foreign branch of the AME Church. The ACS planned to settle a colony at Sherbro Island, now within Sierra Leone, then a British colony. The newcomers were not used to the local diseases, and quickly became ill. The area was swampy, resulting in many mosquitoes that carried disease. All but one of the twelve white colonists and one-third of the African Americans died, including three of the four missionaries. Just before dying, the expedition's leader (Samuel Bacon) asked Coker to take charge of the venture. He helped the remaining colonists get through their despair and to survive. Coker led the group to seek another location on the mainland. He and his family settled in Hastings, Sierra Leone, a newly established village about 15 miles from Freetown and intended for Liberated Africans freed from illegal slave ships. It was one of several new villages developed by the Church Missionary Society, which was active in the colony. Coker became the patriarch of a prominent Creole family, the Cokers. Coker's son, Daniel Coker Jr., became a leader in the town of Freetown. The Coker descendants still reside in Freetown and are among the prominent Creole families. Other members of the expedition settled in what became Liberia. Henry McNeal Turner in 1891 elaborated on Coker's achievements, writing, > \\"It would seem, from all I can learn, that Coker played a prominent part in > the early settlement of Liberia. The first Methodist Church established here > was the African M. E. Church; but by whom established I cannot say. > Tradition says it was afterward sold out to the M. E. Church. Besides the > probability of Rev. Daniel Coker's having established our church here, he > also played a mighty part among the early settlers of Sierra Leone. His > children and grandchildren are found there to-day.\\" See also *Liberia *Sierra Leone *Mother Bethel A.M.E.

Sasco, which is an acronym for the Southern Arizona Smelter Company, was a company town with a large smelter that served several mines. Once an impressive and little-known ghost town, today Sasco is a common sporting destination with shotgun shells, airsoft bb's, paintball splatter, and litter in the area. History Sasco owes its existence to the Development Company of America (DCA), which was headed by Governor Oakes Murphy's brother, Frank M. Murphy. Murphy believed that by consolidating the various mines, railroad, and processing companies in the Silver Bell Mountains into one single organization under his control, mining operations would be much more effective and profitable. Murphy's plan was years ahead of its time, because it called for the creation of one large mine that would employ hundreds of workers over a large area, as opposed to most other mines, which were still operated on a small scale, by only a \\"handful\\" of miners at a time. In 1903, Murphy and his chief engineer, William Field Staunton, purchased the Union Mine and the Mammoth Mine in the Silver Bell Mountains and combined them to form the Imperial Copper Company and the Silver Bell Mine. One year later, DCA built the Arizona Southern Railroad to connect the Silver Bell Mine with the Southern Pacific Railroad at the town of Red Rock. Murphy's next move was to begin work on a large smelter complex and a new town to support it. The resulting Southern Arizona Smelting Company, or Sasco for short, was formed on August 10, 1906. Due to some initial financial problems, work did not begin on the new smelter until the summer of 1907, and it was not completed until February 1908. When the smelter was finished, work on the town and efforts to attract settlers were undertaken. Soon the town of Sasco was home to a residential neighborhood of 600 people, as well as a few stores and saloons. Mead Goodloe, who oversaw the construction of the smelter, built a large brick home known as \\"the big house,\\" which became the unofficial town center. A power house was also built to supply electricity to Sasco, the nearby town of Silverbell, and the Silver Bell Mine. In its heyday, the Sasco smelter employed 175 men and by 1910 had already processed 245,000 tons of copper ore. Although Sasco was set to become \\"one of the premier smelting towns in the Southwest,\\" its existence was very short. Between 1909 and 1911, problems with the DCA mining operations in the Tombstone area forced Murphy to file for bankruptcy, and the Sasco smelter was closed for the first time. Asarco took over the Silver Bell Mine in 1915 and reopened the Sasco smelter, which temporarily revived the town, but disaster again struck. During the winter of 1918 and 1919, the Spanish flu spread to Sasco and devastated it. Most of the graves in the Sasco Cemetery with plain concrete headstones represent victims of the pandemic. Asarco closed the Silver Bell Mine in 1921 to focus on operations elsewhere, and in late 1933 most of the buildings in Sasco were demolished, along with the railroad that served the town. The remains of several structures can still be visited today, including the Hotel Rockland, the Sasco Jail, and the smelter complex. According to James E. Sherman, in his book Ghost Towns of Arizona, old broken glass and rusty cans can be found all over the area. The Sasco Cemetery is located northeast of the town site, next to the La Osa Ranch house.

Usually translated as 'under erasure', it involves the crossing out of a word within a text, but allowing it to remain legible and in place. Used extensively by Jacques Derrida, it signifies that a word is \\"inadequate yet necessary\\";Madan Sarup, An Introductory Guide to Post-Structuralism and Postmodernism p. 33. that a particular signifier is not wholly suitable for the concept it represents, but must be used as the constraints of our language offer nothing better. In the philosophy of deconstruction, sous rature has been described as the typographical expression that seeks to identify sites within texts where key terms and concepts may be paradoxical or self- undermining, rendering their meaning undecidable.Taylor, V.E. & Winquist, C.E. 2001, Encyclopaedia of Postmodernism, Taylor & Francis, London, p. 113Belsey C 2001, Critical Practice 2nd ed., Routledge, London, p116 To extend this notion, deconstruction and the practice of sous rature also seek to demonstrate that meaning is derived from difference, not by reference to a pre-existing notion or freestanding idea.Belsey, p. 116 History Sous rature as a literary practice originated in the works of German philosopher Martin Heidegger (1889‚Äì1976). The practice of placing words or terms under erasure first appeared in Heidegger's work The Fundamental Concepts of Metaphysics, Heidegger's lecture course of 1929/30. And subsequently in a letter he penned to Ernst J√ºnger in 1956 titled \\"Zur Seinsfrage\\" (The Question of Being), in which Heidegger seeks to define nihilism.Spivak, GC 1997, ‚ÄúTranslator‚Äôs Preface‚Äù in Derrida, J. 1967, Of Grammatology, Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, p. xiv During the course of the letter, Heidegger also begins to speculate about the problematic nature of defining anything, let alone words. In particular, the meaning of the term ‚ÄòBeing‚Äô is contested and Heidegger crosses out the word, but lets both the deletion and the word remain. ‚ÄúSince the word is inaccurate, it is crossed out. Since it is necessary, it remains legible.‚ÄùSpivak, p. xiv According to the Heideggerian model, erasure expressed the problem of presence and absence of meaning in language. Heidegger was concerned with trying to return the absent meaning to the present meaning and the placing of a word or term under erasure ‚Äúsimultaneously recognised and questioned the term‚Äôs meaning and accepted use‚Äù.Taylor, p. 113 French philosopher Jacques Derrida (1930‚Äì2004) adopted this technique and further explored the implications of Heidegger's erasure and its application in the wider setting of deconstructive literary theory. Derrida extended the problem of presence and absence to include the notion that erasure does not mark a lost presence, rather the potential impossibility of presence altogether - in other words, the potential impossibility of univocity of meaning ever having been attached to the word or term in the first place. Ultimately, Derrida argued, it was not just the particular signs that were placed under erasure, but the whole system of signification.

Under the law, prostitutes are basically professionals who engage in sexual activities in exchange for money. The government allows this activity as long as they pay taxes and keep legal documents. In 2007, the prostitution and pornography industry in Hungary was estimated by Hungary's tax authority APEH to generate $1 billion annually. Current situation According to the law, local authorities have the power to mark zones for legal prostitution if there is profound local need. Most authorities have refused to designate these zones. These zones must be a distance away from schools or churches. Soliciting is only allowed within these tolerance zones. Prostitutes must be at least 18 years old, possess a \\"entrepreneur's permit\\" and pay taxes. Running brothels or providing a place for prostitution, promoting prostitution or living on the earnings of other peoples prostitution are illegal. Three monthly STI and HIV testing is mandatory, and health certificates can be inspected by the police. SZEXE The Sex Workers' Advocacy Association (in Hungarian: Szexmunk√°sok √ârdekv√©delmi Egyes√ºlete (SZEXE)), originally the Hungarian Prostitutes' Interest Protection Association, was founded in 2000 by a group of sex workers. It serves as a trade union and lobbying organisation to prostitutes in Hungary. The association also provides counselings, routine health checks, legal advice, and it serves as an outreach program to which prostitutes are encouraged to turn when facing difficulties. In 2002, membership was extended to homosexual and transgender prostitutes. Due to regulation, which mandates those engaged in prostitution to subject themselves to periodical health checks, the trade union provides such services. Most attention is focused on the diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) such as Chlamydia, Hepatitis B, HIV, Syphilis, and Gonorrhea. Sex trafficking Hungary is a source, transit, and destination country for women trafficked from Romania and Ukraine to Hungary and through Hungary to the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Germany, Austria, Italy, Switzerland, France, and the United Arab Emirates for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation. Internal trafficking of women for sexual exploitation also occurs. Experts noted a significant increase in trafficking within the country, mostly women from eastern Hungary trafficked to Budapest and areas along the Austrian border. Romani women and girls who grow up in Hungarian orphanages are highly vulnerable to internal sex trafficking. According to government officials and NGOs, the majority of traffickers are individuals or small, family-based groups. Organized crime syndicates transported many of the trafficking victims to or through the country for forced prostitution. The U.S. State Department's report on human rights in Hungary states that although Hungary does not fully comply with minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking, it does make significant efforts to do so. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Hungary as a 'Tier 2 Watch List' country.

He was for thirty years president of the Southington Savings Bank and a director in the Southington Bank and Trust Company, the National Fire Insurance Company, and the Peck, Stow & Wilcox Company, the Aetna Nut Company, and the Southington Hardware Company. While a judge of Southington's probate court from 1873 to 1910, Holcomb switched from Democratic Party to Republican in 1888. He was Hartford's treasurer from 1893 to 1908, a member of the Connecticut State Senate from 1893 to 1894.

Teacher retirement benefits, old-age annuities, and health insurance programs also were instituted. However he became a storm center when he refused to convene the Connecticut Legislature to act on ratification of women's Suffrage Amendment to the US Constitution because of his personal opposition to it. He left office on January 5, 1921. Death and legacy Holcomb died on March 5, 1932, aged 87 years, 98 days, in Southington, Connecticut. He is interred at Oak Hill Cemetery, Southington, Connecticut.

It is at present the site of the Southington Masonic Temple, Friendship Lodge #33, of which he was a past Secretary. The Holcomb School on Main Street in Southington was named in his honor when it opened in 1926. At the time it was the town's largest grammar school. It closed to students in 1974 and was converted into the headquarters of the town's police department in 1981. The building was razed in 2004.

Jones was a prominent missionary and figure in the colony of Sierra Leone; he was the first naturalized citizen of Sierra Leone (though he retained his American citizenship). Jones was the first principal of Fourah Bay College. He was the first Black American to graduate from Amherst College in Massachusetts.\\"Edward Jones\\" , Amherst College Edward Jones was the brother of Jehu Jones, a prominent African-American preacher. Early life Edward Jones was born in Charleston, South Carolina and became part of the mulatto elite of that majority African-American city. Many free mulattoes were freed slaves who had fought in the American Revolutionary War for the Patriots and then freed for their loyalty. Edward Jones's father, Jehu Jones, in 1798, had bought his freedom for $140 from his owner, a tailor who had taught him the craft, and also bought freedom for his wife Abigail and children. Jones Sr. became wealthy from his investments in real estate and eventually a hotel owner catering to white travelers. He bought his first slave in 1807. Associating himself with the elite white people of Charleston, the senior Jones \\"seldom kept the company of even light-complexioned free blacks and never of slaves.\\" Nonetheless, Edward Jones was proud of his African heritage, and was a member of the Brown Fellowship Society in Charleston. Immigration to Liberia Jones immigrated to Liberia but did not stay long before immigrating to the colony of Freetown, Sierra Leone. Life in Sierra Leone It is in Sierra Leone that Jones is most remembered as a great leader and one of the patriarchs of a prominent Krio family. Jones was a superintendent of the liberated African village of Kent, Sierra Leone and it was there he met one of the Nova Scotian settlers, Hannah Nylander, and married her. Jones had married into another prominent family; his wife was of half Nova Scotian (Black Loyalist descent, making her ultimately of Black American descent) and half German through her missionary father, Gustav Nylander. In all Jones married three times and buried all of his wives in Sierra Leone. Jones also fathered six children, only one whom lived to adulthood.Jehu Hanciles, Euthanasia of a Mission: African Church Autonomy in a Colonial Context (Westport, CT: Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002, ), pg. 96. Jones was also the first principal of the newly established Fourah Bay College in Fourah Bay, Sierra Leone (a suburb of Freetown). It was there that the only known portrait of Edward Jones was hung on the wall. Jones died in England in 1865.

In the late 19th century and the first half of the 20th century there were legalized brothels, but these were closed by the communist regime in the late 1940s, and prostitution itself became a criminal offense in 1957.‚ÄúBordelurile »ôi feti»õele dulci din Bucure»ôtiul de altƒÉdatƒÉ, Historia Prostitution was decriminalized in 2014, as the new Penal code of Romania, which came into force on 1 February 2014, no longer contains such a criminal offense. Prior to that date, it was considered a criminal offense (infrac≈£iune) punishable by up to a year imprisonment. There had been proposals in the past to legalize and regulate prostitution (such as in 2007) but these were rejected, especially as Romania is a party to the Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others, which states that prostitution is \\"incompatible with the dignity and worth of the human person and endanger[s] the welfare of the individual, the family and the community\\" and binds countries which ratify it to ban organized prostitution such as pandering or running a brothel. According to the official explanations of the Ministry of Justice, with regard to the new penal code \\"the fact that prostitution will be excluded from criminal penalties does not mean \\"legalizing \\"it, transforming the activity into one regulated or permitted by law, because the persons practicing prostitution will still be sanctioned with a contravention.\\" The Association for the Promotion of Women in Romania opposes legalized prostitution, as they view prostitution as \\"another form of violence against women and girls\\". The Romanian Orthodox Church also opposed the legalisation. In 2008 an EU-funded survey by TAMPEP found Romania was top country of origin of migrant sex workers in the EU. On January 20, 2010, Iana Matei was named \\"European of the Year\\" by Reader's Digest for finding and rehabilitating victims of forced prostitution.The Romanian who helps rebuild the lives of abused women, Denisa Marunteanu and Dan Alexe, January 29, 2010, EUobserver.comIana Matei est l'Europ√©enne de l'ann√©e , Selection, Reader's Digest, (in French)Rescued from sex slavery, 48 Hours goes undercover into the international sex slave trade, Rebecca Leung, July 22, 2005, CBS News 48 Hours. Legal situation Solicitation is an administrative offence (contraven»õie) punishable by a fine of 500‚Äì1500 lei (approximately 110‚Äì330 euros as of 2016). The National Police, Local Police and Gendarmes are all responsible for enforcing the laws, but there are reports that law enforcement is corrupt and sometimes violent. Clients are not prosecuted, unless they knowingly use the services of a victim of forced prostitution, or the prostitute is a minor (Art. 2161) Article 213 criminalizes procuring; it states that \\"The causing or facilitation of the practice of prostitution or the obtaining of financial benefits from the practice of prostitution by one or more individuals shall be punishable by no less than 2 and no more than 7 years of imprisonment and a ban on the exercise of certain rights.\\" In certain aggravated circumstances, the punishment increases. The penal code also criminalizes several offenses against slavery, human trafficking, child trafficking, forced labour, and using exploited persons (Art. 182 Exploitation of a person, Art. 209 Slavery, Art. 210 Trafficking in human beings, Art. 211 Trafficking in underage persons, Art. 212 Pressing into forced or compulsory labor, Art. 216 Use of an exploited person‚Äôs services). Sex trafficking There has been a growing awareness of human trafficking as a human rights issue in Europe. The end of communism has contributed to an increase in human trafficking, with the majority of victims being women forced into prostitution.default Romania is a country of origin and country of transit for persons, primarily women and children, trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation. The Romanian government has shown some commitment to combat trafficking but has been criticized for failing to fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking. Authorities opened 864 new trafficking cases in 2016 (858 in 2015), and prosecutors indicted 358 suspected traffickers in 2016 (480 in 2015). Courts convicted 472 traffickers in 2016 (331 in 2015). Romania is a destination country for a limited number of foreign trafficking victims, including sex trafficking victims from Italy and Armenia. Government officials have been convicted of human trafficking crimes, and there have been reports of local officials obstructing trafficking investigations. The government reported two cases of official complicity in 2016. In one case, a police officer was sentenced to two years imprisonment for repeated trafficking of minors and nine months for establishing a criminal enterprise. In the other case, a judge received eight months for using the services of an exploited person and 16 months imprisonment for blackmail. Articles 210, 211, and 367 of the penal code prohibit all forms of trafficking and prescribe penalties of three to 10 years imprisonment. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Romania as a 'Tier 2' country.

It is believed that the term originally came from the association of white birch or \\"ÁôΩÊ®∫\\" with homes in good standing. Thus Ê®∫ may have described the class of artisans rather than the actual materials used. However this is just one of many explanations, with no single explanation widely accepted.  Characteristics  Traditional kabazaiku is normally small-scale, and focuses on perfectionist detailing of the rounded shapes such as storage containers for tea and tobacco. Keeping moisture levels relatively constant, the cherry bark acts as a natural insulator against changes in humidity, which is essential in the storage of tea and tobacco leaves. The colour is generally a dark red, partially from the bark itself, and partially from the tree's sap.  Origin  Believed to have originated by Lord Satake in the Northeastern city of Kakunodate, Akita prefecture as a secondary vocation for lower-rank samurai, the tradition is said to be over 200 years old. It is passed on today through artisan workshops in the region. The \\"Kakunodate Kougei Kyohdohkumiai\\" museum in the town's samurai district has extensive exhibitions of kabazaiku artwork, as well as regular demonstrations for visitors.  Process  The bark of the abundant native cherry trees is first cleaned and treated to make it smooth and uniform. The wood of the tree itself is cut into the desired shape, the bark is then reapplied to the wood using the sap as an adhesive. The application process involves using a small metal trowel which is heated over a fire. Because every surface requires a separate, independently shaped piece of bark, the labour is quite time-intensive.  Modern application  In addition to tea boxes and tobacco accessories, modern kabazaiku craftsman also create larger-scale wooden artworks intended more for display than for specific use. Clocks, storage containers, calligraphy brushes, and sword sheathes are also produced.

(page 175 in 1967 edition) In a narrower sense, atheism is specifically the position that there are no deities. Most inclusively, atheism is simply the absence of belief that any deities exist. Religioustolerance.org's short article on Definitions of the term \\"Atheism\\" suggests that there is no consensus on the definition of the term. Most dictionaries (see the OneLook query for \\"atheism\\") first list one of the more narrow definitions. * ‚Äì entry by Vergilius Ferm Atheism is contrasted with theism, which in its most general form is the belief that at least one deity exists.  What type of thing is atheism?  Atheism can be described as all of the following: * a philosophy - * a belief - * a non-belief - * a stance - taking a position in an argument, a stand on a given issue  Types of atheism  * Positive atheism - the form of atheism that asserts there is no deity. Also called \\"strong atheism\\". ** Explicit atheism - \\"the absence of theistic belief due to a conscious rejection of it\\". * Negative atheism - refers to any type of non- theism other than positive atheism, wherein a person does not believe in the existence of any deity, but without asserting there to be none. Also called \\"weak atheism\\". ** Implicit atheism - \\"the absence of theistic belief without a conscious rejection of it\\". *** Agnostic atheism - philosophical position that encompasses both atheism and agnosticism. Agnostic atheists are atheistic because they do not hold a belief in the existence of any deity and agnostic because they claim that the existence of a deity is either unknowable in principle or currently unknown in fact.  Atheistic arguments  * Arguments against God's existence - ** Argument from free will - contends that omniscience and free will are incompatible, and that any conception of God that incorporates both properties is therefore inherently contradictory.See the various controversies on God's Omniscience, and in particular on the critical notion of ForeknowledgeStanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Foreknowledge and Free WillInternet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Foreknowledge and Free Will Also called the \\"paradox of free will\\", and \\"theological fatalism\\". ** Argument from inconsistent revelations - asserts that it is unlikely that God exists because many theologians and faithful adherents have produced conflicting and mutually exclusive revelations. The argument states that since a person not privy to revelation must either accept it or reject it based solely upon the authority of its proponents, and since there is no way for a mere mortal to resolve these conflicting claims by investigation, it is prudent to reserve one's judgment. Also known as the \\"avoiding the wrong hell problem.\\" ** Argument from nonbelief - premise that if God existed (and wanted humanity to know it), he would have brought about a situation in which every reasonable person believed in him; however, there are reasonable unbelievers, and therefore, this weighs against God's existence. The argument affirms inconsistency between the world that exists and the world that should exist if God had certain desires combined with the power to see them through. ** Argument from poor design - reasons that an omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent creator God would create organisms that have optimal design. Organisms have features that are sub-optimal. Therefore, God either did not create these organisms or is not omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent. Also called the \\"dysteleological argument.\\" ** Incompatible-properties argument - argument that the existence of evil is incompatible with the concept of an omnipotent and perfectly good God. A \\"good\\" God is incompatible with some possible worlds, thus incapable of creating them without losing the property of being a totally good God. A \\"good\\" God can create only \\"good\\" worlds. ** Omnipotence paradox - states that: if a being can perform any action, then it should be able to create a task which this being is unable to perform; hence, this being cannot perform all actions. Yet, on the other hand, if this being cannot create a task that it is unable to perform, then there exists something it cannot do. ** Problem of evil - question of how to explain evil if there exists a deity that is omnibenevolent, omnipotent, and omniscient.The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, \\" The Problem of Evil\\", Michael TooleyThe Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, \\" The Evidential Problem of Evil\\", Nick Trakakis Some philosophers have claimed that the existences of such a god and of evil are logically incompatible or unlikely. ** Fate of the unlearned - eschatological question about the ultimate destiny of people who have not been exposed to a particular theology or doctrine and thus have no opportunity to embrace it. The question is whether those who never hear of requirements issued through divine revelations will be punished for failure to abide by those requirements. ** Problem of Hell - ethical problem related to religions in which portrayals of Hell are ostensibly cruel, and are thus inconsistent with the concepts of a just, moral and omnibenevolent God. * Atheist's Wager - goes something like this: \\"You should live your life and try to make the world a better place for your being in it, whether or not you believe in god. If there is no god, you have lost nothing and will be remembered fondly by those you left behind. If there is a benevolent god, he will judge you on your merits and not just on whether or not you believed in him.\\" * Russell's teapot - analogy first coined by the philosopher Bertrand Russell (1872‚Äì1970) to illustrate the idea that the philosophic burden of proof lies upon a person making scientifically unfalsifiable claims rather than shifting the burden of proof to others, specifically in the case of religion. Russell wrote that if he claimed that a teapot were orbiting the Sun somewhere in space between the Earth and Mars, it would be nonsensical for him to expect others not to doubt him on the grounds that they could not prove him wrong. Sometimes called the \\"celestial teapot\\" or \\"cosmic teapot.\\" * Theological noncognitivism - argument that religious language, and specifically words like \\"god\\", are not cognitively meaningful. Theological noncognitivists await a coherent definition of the word God (or of any other metaphysical utterance purported to be discussable) before being able to engage in arguments for or against God's existence. * Ultimate Boeing 747 gambit - counter-argument to the modern form of the argument from design, by Richard Dawkins. A central thesis of the argument is that, compared to supernatural abiogenesis, evolution by natural selection requires the supposition of fewer hypothetical processes and thus, according to Occam's razor, a better explanation than the God hypothesis.

Background The book was published on March 1, 2006 by BenBella Books, and is part of their \\"Psychology of Popular Culture Series,\\" or \\"Smart Pop\\" for short. Other books in the series include works which analyze psychology and pop culture themes as related to Superman, the X-Men, and The Matrix. The BenBella psychology series was inspired by a similar pop philosophy series from publisher Open Court Publishing Company. The editors of the book were Alan S. Brown, Ph.D., and Chris Logan. Brown is a professor of psychology, and Logan is a lecturer in the field. The book is meant to appeal both to fans of The Simpsons, and academic students of psychology. Content The book contains content from twenty-nine contributors, including psychologists, counselors, teachers and school therapists. It also includes content from Brown and Logan. General topics discussed in the work include family, alcohol abuse, relationships, self-esteem, sex and gender, and personality. Specific topics in the field of psychology include clinical psychology, cognition, abnormal psychology, evolutionary psychology, gambling addiction, Pavlovian conditioning and family therapy. Contributor Denis M. McCarthy, assistant professor of psychology at the University of Missouri, analyzes risk factors for alcoholism presented in The Simpsons. McCarthy cites Bart's passive-avoidance learning as a risk factor, and notes that Maggie is at a high risk for substance abuse due to violent tendencies. Though each chapter contains material comparing The Simpsons episodes to academic psychology themes, the chapter titles are less serious, including \\"Which One of Us is Truly Crazy\\" and \\"Looking For Mr. Smarty Pants.\\" Editor Chris Logan explained: \\"The book‚Äôs content is very serious, but it's not presented in an overly serious way.\\" The Simpsons Archive also described the balance between humor and academia in the book, noting: \\"Fortunately, despite numerous references to various psychological theories and academic studies, the essays steer clear of becoming too serious, and manage to stay entertaining throughout the book.\\" Reception The book was received favorably in a publication of Southern Methodist University. In the introduction to an interview with one of the book's editors, the interviewer noted: \\"Get past the goofy cover, with its illustration of Homer‚Äôs beer- and TV-saturated brain, and you find analysis aimed at both TV viewers and students of psychology.\\" The book also received positive mention in The Times, where Andrew Billen wrote: \\"I can commend D'Oh!: The Psychology of The Simpsons and Reading The Sopranos, since both shows are sturdy enough to support the intellectual studies.\\" An article at The Simpsons Archive also wrote positively of the work: \\"The connection to the show and its events is solid and psychological points are illustrated using explanatory snippets from the Simpsons.\\" See also *Lists of The Simpsons publications *Planet Simpson: How a Cartoon Masterpiece Documented an Era and Defined a Generation *The Simpsons and Philosophy: The D'oh! of Homer References External links *The Psychology of The Simpsons, preview, from official publisher's Web site. *The Psychology of The Simpsons: D'oh!, book description at official Web site, The Simpsons Shop *\\"Homer's Soul\\", excerpted portion of the book, hosted at Yale University 2006 non-fiction books Popular psychology books Non-fiction books about The Simpsons ","title":"The Psychology of The Simpsons"},{"id":"14464159","text":"ËÑ≥„Åø„Åù„Ç∑„Éß„Éº„Éà„Ç±„Éº„Ç≠ (Noumiso Shortcake) is the 2nd album by the Japanese art punk band „Å§„Åó„Åæ„Åø„Çå (Tsu Shi Ma Mi Re).

Early life Lake was born in Woodstock, Connecticut, on February 8, 1871, son of Thomas A. Lake and Martha A. Cockings Lake. He studied at Worcester Polytechnic and graduated in 1890. He then attended Harvard University, where he played for the Harvard Crimson football team. He received consensus All-American football honors in 1891. He graduated from Harvard in 1892. Lake married three times. His first wife was Eva Louise Sykes, whom he married on September 4, 1895, and with whom he had a son and a daughter, Marjorie S. Lake. Eva Lake died on November 25, 1935, in Boston. Her body was brought back to Connecticut for burial in Cedar Hill Cemetery in Hartford. After Eva's death, Lake married Mrs. Elizabeth (Keeney) Gordon, the widow of Lewis E. Gordon, on December 24, 1935. She died on August 28, 1936, in Whitefield, New Hampshire, and is also buried in the Cedar Hill Cemetery.

The capitulation ended the brief existence of the Republic of Formosa and inaugurated the era of Japanese colonial rule in Taiwan.  Background  After the Qing Empire signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, officials on Taiwan opposed to the cession of Taiwan to Japan proclaimed an independent Republic of Formosa and raised forces in order to resist the impending Japanese invasion. On 6 June 1895, in the wake of the Imperial Japanese Army's successful landing and occupation of northern Taiwan, President Tang Jingsong fled the island. On 26 June the former-Qing garrison commander and vice-president of the Republic of Formosa Liu Yongfu announced his succession as head of government, and used his base in Tainan as the capital of the second republic. The capture of Tainan now became a political as well as a strategic imperative for the Japanese. However, this proved to be easier said than done. Faced with growing resistance to their occupation, the Japanese were unable to advance immediately on Tainan. During the second phase of the campaign, from June to August, the Japanese secured central Taiwan by occupying Miaoli and Changhua. They then paused for a month, and only embarked on the third and final phase of the campaign, the advance on Tainan, in the second week of October. The arrival of strong reinforcements (the 2nd Provincial Division, transferred from the Japanese 2nd Army in Manchuria, and part of the 4th Provincial Division, from Osaka) allowed the Japanese to approach Tainan from three directions at once. On 10 October two task forces sailed from the Pescadores. The smaller task force, 5,460 troops under the command of Prince Fushimi, landed at Pa-te-chui (Â∏ÉË¢ãÂò¥), to the north of Tainan. The larger task force, 6,330 troops under the command of Lieutenant-General Nogi, landed at Fangliao (ÊûãÂØÆ), well to the south of Tainan. Its first objective was to capture the port of Takow (modern Kaohsiung), twenty-five miles to the north. Meanwhile, the Imperial Guards Division, then at Changhua, was ordered to continue to press forward towards Tainan. Just under 20,000 Japanese troops now closed in on Tainan simultaneously, from the north, the northeast and the south. Liu Yongfu could probably field a larger force, but the Chinese and Formosans were by now fighting merely to stave off defeat. They had little hope of stemming the Japanese advance on Tainan.  Japanese advance on Tainan   Japanese capture of Yunlin and Chiayi  The Imperial Guards Division commenced its march south from Changhua on 3 October. On 6 October the division's advance guard defeated a force of 3,000 insurgents at Talibu. On 7 October the division fought an important action with the insurgents at Yunlin, driving them from a series of fortified positions. On 9 October the division fought the second-largest battle of the campaign, the Battle of Chiayi, to storm the walled city of Chiayi, where the insurgents had decided to make a determined stand. According to report, the Chinese and Formosans numbered 10,000 men and included both regular and volunteer units. The true figure was probably around 3,000 men, but the insurgents were stiffened by a force of 600 Black Flags, who now fought the Japanese for the first time during the campaign, and also deployed cannon and machine guns on the city walls. After a preliminary bombardment with their mountain artillery the Japanese scaled the walls and broke into the city. The insurgents were defeated, leaving over 200 dead on the field. Total casualties in the Imperial Guards Division in the engagements fought between 3 and 9 October were 14 killed and 54 wounded. The division was ordered to halt at Chiayi and wait until Prince Fushimi's northern expedition went ashore at Pa-te-chui before resuming its advance.  Liu Yongfu's conditional surrender offer  On 10 October, discouraged by the news of the fall of Chiayi, Liu Yongfu made an offer of conditional surrender to the Japanese. He asked that no Formosan should be punished for having taken up arms against the Japanese, and that all Chinese soldiers still in Taiwan should be treated hospitably and repatriated to Canton or Amoy. The surrender offer was conveyed to the Japanese headquarters at Makung in the Pescadores by the British warship HMS Pique, and the Japanese replied that they would send a warship to Anping, the outport of Tainan, on 12 October to discuss Liu's proposals. On 12 October the Japanese cruiser Yoshino arrived off Anping, but Liu Yongfu refused to go aboard, perhaps fearing treachery. The Japanese subsequently informed him that they would accept only unconditional surrender.  Japanese victory at Shau-lan  Meanwhile, the other two Japanese columns were making their presence felt. Prince Fushimi's northern column, which included the 5th and 17th Infantry Regiments, landed at Pa-te-chui on 10 October. The division fought several brisk actions during its advance southwards. These included an action at Kaw- wah-tau on 12 October, in which Japanese casualties were slight, and an engagement near Kiu-sui-kei on 16 October to disengage a company of the 17th Regiment which had been surrounded by the insurgents, in which the Japanese suffered casualties of 9 dead and 10 wounded and the enemy at least 60 dead. On 18 October the 5th Infantry Regiment, supported by a battery of artillery and a troop of cavalry, routed the insurgents at Ongo-ya-toi. Japanese casualties were 3 dead and 14 wounded, while the enemy left 80 dead on the battlefield. On the same day the 17th Regiment met the Formosans at Tion-sha and inflicted a heavy defeat upon them. Formosan losses were computed at around 400 killed, while on the Japanese side only one officer was wounded. Meanwhile, the brigade's advance guard dislodged an insurgent force numbering around 4,000 men and armed with repeating rifles from the village of Mao-tau, to the south of the So-bung-go River, but suffered relatively high casualties in doing so. On 19 October, in a battle to capture the fortified village of Shau-lan, the Japanese took a striking revenge. The 17th Regiment trapped a force of 3,000 insurgents inside the village and inflicted very heavy casualties on them when they stormed it. Nearly a thousand enemy bodies were counted after this massacre. Japanese losses were only 30 men killed or wounded, including 3 officers.  Japanese capture of Takow  Lieutenant- General Nogi's southern column, consisting of 6,330 soldiers, 1,600 military coolies and 2,500 horses, landed at Fangliao on 10 October, and engaged a force of Formosan militiamen at Ka-tong-ka (ËåÑËã≥ËÖ≥; modern-day Jiadong) on 11 October. The Battle of Chiatung was a Japanese victory, but the Japanese suffered their heaviest combat casualties of the campaign in the engagement‚Äî16 men killed and 61 wounded. Three officers were among the casualties. On 15 October Nogi's column closed in on the important port of Takow (Kaohsiung), but discovered that the Japanese navy had beaten it to the punch. Two days earlier, on 13 October, the Takow forts had been bombarded and silenced by the Japanese cruisers Yoshino, , , Hiei, Yaeyama and Saien, and a naval landing force had been put ashore to occupy the town. Foiled of their prize, Nogi's men pressed on, and captured the town of Pithau (Âü§È†≠; modern-day Fongshan District) on 16 October. By 20 October they were at the village of Ji-chang- hang, only a few miles south of Tainan. There, on the night of 20 October, they received an offer of unconditional surrender from the Chinese merchants of Tainan.  The collapse of the Republic of Formosa   Liu Yongfu's flight  Liu Yongfu (1837‚Äì1917) On 19 October, realising that the war was lost, Liu Yongfu decided to leave for the Chinese mainland. Accompanied by around a hundred officers of the Tainan garrison, he left the city during the night on the pretence of going to inspect the defences of Anping. He then disguised himself as a coolie and boarded the British merchant ship Thales, bound for Amoy, on the morning of 20 October. The Japanese only got wind of Liu's flight on the following morning, after they marched into Anping and Tainan, and on 21 October the Thales was pursued by the cruiser Yaeyama, halted fifteen miles from Amoy, and boarded by Japanese sailors. The Japanese sailors did not recognise Liu Yongfu, but announced that they intended to arrest seven supposed Chinese labourers aboard the British vessel who were unable to give a satisfactory account of themselves. Although the Japanese did not know it, one of the seven labourers was Liu Yongfu. He owed his escape to the intervention of the British captain. Indignant at being boarded on the high seas, the captain protested vigorously at this illegal search, and when the merchant ship reached Amoy all its passengers, including Liu Yongfu, were allowed to go ashore without further hindrance. Admiral Arichi Shinanojo, the Japanese fleet commander in the invasion of Formosa, was shortly afterwards forced to resign as a result of a subsequent British complaint to Japan. Only later did the Japanese realise how close they had come to capturing Liu Yongfu.  The capitulation of Tainan  The news that Liu Yongfu had abandoned the struggle broke in Tainan on the morning of 20 October. It was at first greeted with shock and disbelief. Soldiers and civilians alike wandered through the city's streets, discussing this sudden turn of events in animated tones. Then the soldiers began to leave Tainan, making for the illusory safety of the port of Anping, a few miles further away from the Japanese lines. The Chinese merchants and the city's small European community watched this development apprehensively. The mood of the soldiers could easily turn ugly, and there was a danger that they might return to plunder the city. For once, the European residents played a decisive part in events. Three European employees of the Maritime Customs at Anping‚ÄîMessrs. Burton, McCallum and Alliston‚Äîpersuaded the Chinese soldiers who had flocked to Anping to hand over their weapons for safekeeping and surrender peacefully to the Japanese. Nearly 10,000 Chinese soldiers rid themselves of their telltale firearms, and sat down to await events. The collection of the weapons lasted throughout the day, and by nightfall between 7,000 and 8,000 rifles had been secured and locked up in one of the godowns of the Maritime Customs. The next step was to invite the Japanese into Tainan. The Chinese merchants composed a suitable letter, swearing that all Chinese troops had laid down their arms and begging the Japanese to enter the city as soon as possible to maintain order. Nobody, however, was willing to run the considerable risks involved in delivering this message to the Japanese. Eventually two missionaries of the English Presbyterian Mission, James Fergusson and Thomas Barclay, agreed to make the perilous journey from Tainan to Lieutenant-General Nogi's headquarters at Ji- chang-hang, a few miles south of the city. They set off just before nightfall, and made their way towards the Japanese front lines. After walking for a few hours they were halted by a rifle shot from a Japanese sentry, and were eventually brought into General Nogi's presence. Nogi, unsurprisingly, was wary of possible Chinese treachery, but eventually decided to march on Tainan that night and enter the city early the following morning. Barclay and Fergusson later related their adventure to William Campbell, another member of the English Presybterian Mission, who gave the following description of their tense ordeal: > The sun was just setting when all the needful preparations were made, but > not an hour was to be lost; and, therefore, taking the stamped document with > them, my colleagues went out from the Great South Gate on their errand of > mercy. The stars were shining brightly, and stillness reigned everywhere, > till the party was startled by the ping of a rifle, and the loud challenge > of a Japanese sentry. Signals were made, but they were immediately > surrounded, and led to the presence of General Nogi, who consulted with his > officers, and afterwards informed the missionaries of the acceptance of the > invitation they brought, and that the army would begin to move before > daybreak, having Mr. Barclay with the nineteen Chinamen in front, and Mr. > Fergusson with several officers marching in the rear. It was also plainly > stated that, on the slightest show of treachery or resistance, the soldiers > would open fire, and the whole city be burned to the ground.

Nogi's column entered Tainan at 7 a.m. on 21 October, and by 9 a.m. had secured the city. The troops of Prince Fushimi's northern column arrived on the afternoon of the same day. The capitulation of Tainan put an end to serious Formosan resistance and effectively inaugurated the era of Japanese colonial rule in Formosa.

The method was developed by Dr. Todd Kuiken at Northwestern University and Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago and Dr. Gregory Dumanian at Northwestern University Division of Plastic Surgery.  Overview  Targeted reinnervation has an efferent and an afferent component. Targeted muscle reinnervation is a method by which a spare muscle (the target muscle) of an amputated patient is denervated (its original nerves cut and/or de-activated), then reinnervated with residual nerves of the amputated limb. The resultant EMG signals of the targeted muscle now represent the motor commands to the missing limb, and are used to drive a motorized prosthetic device. Targeted sensory reinnervation is a method by which skin near or over the targeted muscle is denervated, then reinnervated with afferent fibers of the remaining hand nerves. Therefore, when this piece of skin is touched, it provides the amputee with a sense of the missing arm or hand being touched.  Motivation  Several methods exist that seek to achieve advanced control of motorized neural prosthetics. Chronic brain implants record neuronal signals from the motor cortex, while methods such as EEG and fMRI obtain motor commands non-invasively. The recorded signals are decoded into electrical signals, and input into assistive devices or motorized prosthetics. Traditional myoelectric prostheses utilize surface EMG signals from the remains of the amputated limb. For example, a patient may flex a shoulder muscle in order to generate EMG signals that may be used to send ‚Äúbend elbow‚Äù command to the prosthesis. However, there are shortcomings to all of these methods. Chronic implants fail over a period of time because neuronal signal degrade due to tissue immune response to foreign bodies. EEG and fMRI do not obtain as strong signals as direct electrode implant. Traditional myoelectric prostheses are unable to provide multiple control signals simultaneously, thus only one action can be performed at a time. They are also unnatural to use because the users have to use muscles (such as shoulder) that are not normally involved with lower arm functions to control lower arm functions (such as opening and closing hands). The solution to these problems could include a completely different concept of neural interface.  Advantages  Targeted reinnervation does not require any implants. Therefore, it does not have the issue of tissue foreign body response as chronic brain implant technology does. The targeted muscle acts as a natural amplifier for the neuronal signals produced by the transferred residual nerves. This is an advantage over technologies like EEG and fMRI that utilize weaker signals. With targeted reinnervation, multiple yet independent EMG signals can be produced, thus multiple functions of the artificial limb can be controlled simultaneously. For example, the patient would be able to perform actions such as throwing a ball relatively gracefully, exhibiting simultaneous control of elbow and hand. The control is also intuitive to the patient because the EMG signals are generated by transferred residual limb nerves, unlike traditional myoelectric prosthetics where EMG signals have to be generated by muscles normally not involved in arm or wrist functions. Also, existing commercially available myoelectric prostheses, such as powered wrists, elbows can be used. There is no need to develop specific prostheses for targeted reinnervation. By means of nerve transfer, targeted reinnervation can also provide sensory feedback, which has not been achieved by any other form of prosthetics aforementioned.  Methods   Targeted Muscle Reinnervation  The goal of targeted muscle reinnervation is to transfer multiple nerves into separate regions of the targeted muscle, record multiple yet independent signals from the muscle regions, and to use the EMG signals to control a motorized prosthesis sophisticated enough to process multiple control signals. = Surgical Procedure = The requirement to transplant multiple nerves into a muscle region originated from a hypothesis that hyper- reinnervation, by which an excessive amount of motor neurons transferred to a muscle, can increase the reinnervation of muscle fibers hence improving the recovery of paralyzed muscles. The hypothesis was tested on rat skeletal muscles and the result indicated that hyper-reinnervated muscles recovered more muscle mass and strength and more number of motor units were formed. The first surgical patient was a bilateral shoulder disarticulation amputee. Both arms were entirely amputated at the shoulder level, with only the shoulder blades remaining. The pectoral muscles were chosen targets because they were close to the shoulder, and they were also biologically non-functional due to detachment from the amputated arm. The pectoral muscles were first denervated by cutting the original nerves that innervate them. The proximal ends of the original nerves were ligated to prevent them from reinnervating the pectoral muscle. Then the remnant arm nerves (brachial plexus) were transferred into the pectoral muscles. The musculocutaneous nerve was transferred to the clavicular head of the pectoralis major muscle; the median nerve was transferred to the upper sternal of the pectoralis major muscle; the radial nerve was transferred to the lower sternal head of the pectoralis major muscle. The pectoralis minor muscle was translocated from under the pectorialis major muscle to the lateral chest wall, so that its EMG signals would not interfere with those of the pectoralis major muscle, and it is also a fourth muscle target. The ulnar nerve was then transferred to the moved pectoralis minor muscle. The musculocutaneous, median, radial, and ulnar nerves (brachial plexus) were sewn onto the distal ends of the original pectoral muscle nerve fascicles and onto the muscle itself. Subcutaneous fat over the pectoral muscle was removed so that the electrodes can be as close to the muscle as possible to obtain optimal EMG signals. = Post-surgical Training = About 3 months after surgery, the patient had the first twitch in pectoral muscle when he attempted to bend his phantom elbow. Five months past surgery, he was able to contract four regions of pectoralis major muscle by attempting different moves. For example, when the patient attempted to bend his elbow, the muscle region beneath the clavicle contracted strongly. This was an indication of successful musculocutaneous nerve transfer because musculocutaneous nerve innervates biceps. The patient was then soon put to a training session and a testing session. During training session, the patient was sitting in an upright position and shown each of the 27 normal movements (such as shoulder adduction/abduction, hand open/close, elbow flexion/extension etc.) on a video. After each demonstration, the patient followed the movement 10 times, exerting a moderate force, held for 2.5 seconds. The patient was given 5 seconds of rest after each attempt. During the test session, the patient performed 5 sets of the 27 movements in random order. He was first shown a video of a movement, then asked to follow the repeated video of the same movement simultaneously after 2 seconds. = EMG Recording and Processing = A BioSemi Active II system (produced by BioSemi, Amsterdam, Netherlands) and a 127-channel electrode array were used to record monopolar EMG signals while patient was attempting movements during training and testing sessions. One hundred and fifteen electrodes were used to record EMG from the pectoral muscle; two electrodes were used to record from each of the deltoid, latissimus dorsi, supraspinatus, upper trapezius, middle trapezius and lower trapezius muscles. The electrodes were placed at a distance of 15mm from each other. To remove the artifact caused by body movement, the EMG signals were preliminarily filtered with a fifth order butterworth high-pass filter set at 5 Hz. The major contaminant of the EMG signal was the ECG artifact. To remove ECG noise, an ECG template was constructed by averaging ECG complexes recorded when muscles were relaxed. The time between each ECG complex was used to calculate a representative inter- spike-interval. Detection of ECG spikes was calculated from the correlations between EMG and the ECG template. A threshold was set so that signals exceeding the threshold were marked as possible ECG spikes. The inter-spike- intervals of the possible spikes were then compared to the previously calculated representative inter-spike-interval to determine whether the possible spikes were to be accepted as ECG artifacts. Another major task of processing the EMG signals is to eliminate crosstalk from other muscles. First, positions of and distance between electrodes are empirically determined to obtain strongest EMG thus least crosstalk. Setting a threshold above background noise and crosstalk from other muscles also helps eliminating crosstalk. Smaller muscle size and subcutaneous fat facilitate crosstalk. With a minimal level of less than 3mm subcutaneous fat, crosstalk is expected to be minimal in an area of 2‚Äì3 cm diameter. = Prosthetic Components = After surgery, the patient was fitted with his pre-surgery body-powered prosthesis on the right side and an experimental myoelectric prosthesis consisted of a Griefer terminal device, a power wrist rotator, a Boston digital arm, and an LTI-Collier Shoulder joint on the left side. Three strongest EMG signals were chosen from the successful nerve transfers: the musculocutaneous nerve, the median nerve and the radial nerve. The EMG resulting from contraction of muscle reinnvervated by median nerve was used to control hand closing movement; the EMG from musculocutaneous nerve was used to control elbow bending; the EMG from radial nerve was used to control wrist rotation and flexion. The performances of these two prostheses were compared with a box- and-blocks test, where the patient was allowed 2 minutes to move one-inch cubes from one box to another, over a short wall. The result was quantified by the total number of blocks moved. To test the terminal device (‚Äúhand‚Äù), elbow and wrist rotator, the patient was administered a clothes-pin test, where he was asked to pick up clothes pins from a horizontal bar, rotate them, then put them on a higher vertical bar. The time used to move 3 clothes-pins was recorded. Both tests were repeated 3 times. The quantified results showed that the myoelectric prosthesis performed 246% better (moved 2.46 times more blocks) in box-and-blocks test, and 26.3% better (used 26.3% less time in moving clothes pins) in clothes-pin test. An experimental six-motor prosthesis was also constructed. The most striking feature of targeted reinnervation compared to traditional myoelectric prosthetics is its ability to provide multiple signals to control multiple functions simultaneously. Although current myoelectric prostheses can be used directly, they are designed and aimed at traditional myoelectric control. Thus, the only commercially available prosthesis only has powered terminal device (often a hook), wrist rotation and powered elbow. To fully utilize the multiple signals provided by targeted reinnervation, an experimental prosthesis was constructed with added power components: a TouchEMAS shoulder, a humeral rotator, and a hand capable of opening and closing with wrist flexion/extension function. The elbow and hand functions were driven by four nerve transfer signals, and the humeral rotation was driven by EMG from latissumus dorsi and deltoids. With this six- motor prosthesis, the patient could control multiple joints at the same time and perform new tasks that could not be accomplished with other prostheses, such as reaching out to pick up objects and putting on a hat.  Targeted Sensory Reinnervation  = Discovery = Targeted sensory reinnervation was discovered by accident. While receiving an alcohol rub on his chest after the surgery, the patient described a sensation of being touched on the pinky. The explanation for this phenomenon is that, since his subcutaneous fat was removed during surgery, his chest skin was denervated. Thus, the afferent nerve fibers regenerated through the pectoral muscle, reinnervating the skin over the muscle. Since then, areas of the pectoral muscle have been mapped to parts of arm and hand according to patient's description of touch sensations he felt. When touched in a specific region on the pectoral muscle, the patient would describe where in the phantom limb he felt as being touched. For example, when touched in a region immediately above the nipple, he felt as if his anterior forearm was being touched. = Surgical Procedure = With this discovery, the team set out to perform nerve transfer surgery specifically aimed to reinnervate sensory feedback. A piece of skin near or over the targeted muscle was denervated, thus the afferent nerve fibers were allowed to reinnervate the skin. In a case of a woman patient with left arm amputation at the humeral neck, the supraclavicular sensory nerve was cut, the proximal end was ligated to prevent regeneration and reinnervation, and the distal end was coapted end-to-side to the ulnar nerve. The intercostobrachial cutaneous nerve was treated with the same method, with the distal end coapted to the median nerve. This technique has been dubbed ‚Äútransfer sensation‚Äù, and it has the potential of providing useful sensory feedback, such as pressure sensing, to help the patient judge the amount of force to be exerted. = Assessment and Results = After surgery, the patient was asked to identify the chest areas with most prominent sensation of individual digits, which were then mapped onto a diagram. The characteristic of the sensory reinnervation was quantified. Light touch is quantified by a threshold determined with Semmes- Weinstein monofilaments (a sensation measurement instrument). A Neurotip neurometer was used to determine the sensibility of sharpness and dullness at 20 sites distributed throughout the targeted muscle (the chest). A tuning fork was pressed against the points on the chest to assess patient's ability to detect vibration. A TSA II NeuroSensory Analyzer was used to assess temperature thresholds at two points on the chest. The patient's other (normal) pectoral muscle, normal arm and hand are used as controls. The patient was able to perceive all modalities of cutaneous sensation. However, instead of normal pressure sensing, she perceived tingling in response to touch on the targeted chest skin. The lowest threshold above which light touch could be sensed in the target muscle was 0‚Ä¢4 g, while the control chest muscle had a light-touch threshold of 0‚Ä¢16 g; the thresholds were under 4 g at most points in the area while the control chest had a threshold of 0.4 g at its counterpart locations. The control chest demonstrated a much lower threshold hence higher sensibility. The patient was able to discern increasing, graded pressure. She felt more tingling as the test pressure increased. The patient also demonstrated perception of temperature. The mean threshold for coldness perception was 29‚Ä¢1 ¬∞C in the target muscle, and 29‚Ä¢9 ¬∞C in the control chest muscle. The mean threshold for warmth perception was 35‚Ä¢2 ¬∞C in the target muscle, and 34‚Ä¢7 ¬∞C in the control chest muscle. The patient was able to discern between sharp and dull stimuli and detect vibration at 19 of the 20 points selected for testing. All the above sensations perceived by the patient were described by the patient as occurring in her phantom hand.  Risks and Complications  With extraordinary successes came certain risks and failures. The general risks of the surgery, in addition to standard risks of surgery, include permanent paralysis of the target muscle, recurrence of phantom limb pain, and development of painful neuromas. With the first patient, the ulnar nerve transfer was not successful. The muscle region was not reinnervated as expected, but instead turned bluish after mobilization, possibly due to a congestion of vascular supply. With the left-arm amputation woman mentioned above, her phantom limb pain returned after surgery. Though at a lesser degree and resolved within 4 weeks, it still presented a serious risk because it is unclear whether it will resolve in other future patients. Additionally, surgery was unsuccessful with a patient because severe nerve injuries were not detectable until during the surgery. It also remains in speculation whether the transferred nerves would survive permanently.  Future Research and Development  The team has now moved onto a trial with transhumeral amputees (amputation above the elbow), with the hope that median nerve transfer in transradial amputation could potentially provide thumb control. With all previous patients being upper limb amputees, the team also hopes to move on to lower limb amputees eventually. The nerves could also be further split to provide even more independent signals, so that more functions can be controlled simultaneously and more degrees of freedom can be gained in prosthesis control. This could also prompt the production of more sophisticated prosthetic devices with more degrees of freedom, such as the six-motor experimental prosthesis mentioned above. Targeted reinnervation could also utilize implantable electrodes to record more localized signals from the target muscle, so that crosstalk can be further mitigated. Much work is still to be done to translocate the sensory feedback from the reinnervated target muscle to the actual prosthesis, or to construct prostheses that are capable of providing appropriate stimuli to the reinnervated target muscle according to the external stimuli received, so that the sensory feedback of the arm comes from its native physical position. Beginning in 2016, the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins began working with a patient having undergone both targeted muscle reinnervation and osseointegration of a titanium port to test and perfect their design for the Modular Prosthetic Limb funded by DARPAhttp://hub.jhu.edu/2016/01/12/prosthetic-limb-more-mobility- apl/  References  Kuiken T.
