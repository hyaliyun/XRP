Woodcut from the Bamberger Halsgerichtsordnung (1507) Vogelfrei in German usage denotes the status of a person on whom a legal penalty of outlawry has been imposed. However, the original meaning of the term referred to independence, being \\"free as a bird\\"; the current negative meaning developed only in the 16th century. It then came to predominate through the influence of Baroque poetry and of Jacob Grimm's Deutsche Grammatik (German Grammar; 1819).  History and etymology  Originally, the word vogelfrei merely meant \\"as free as a bird, not bound.\\" That is the usage in older sources.According to a 1455 document, clerics of Buchenau monastery were \\"vogelfrei\\" (i.e. liberal, generous) if they donated one penny a year. Schmidt-Wiegand, p. 931, including further examples. Even Luther and Zwingli used the word still in its original meaning. Much later the term was linked to a person being banned. This resulted from the formulas: > As you have been lawfully judged and banished for murder, so I remove your > body and good from the state of peace and rule them strifed and proclaim you > free of any redemption and rights and I proclaim you as free as the birds in > the air and the beasts in the forest and the fish in the water, and you > shall not have peace nor company on any road or by any ruling of the emperor > or king.Article 241 of the Bamberger Halsgerichtsordnung [Bamberg Penal > Code], quoted by Jacob Grimm, volume I, p. 58: (\\"als du mit urteil u. recht > zu der mordacht erteilt worden bist, also nim ich dein leib u. gut aus dem > fride und thu sie in den unfrid und künde dich erlös u. rechtlos und künde > dich den vögeln frei in den lüften und den tieren in dem wald und den > vischen in dem waßer und solt auf keiner straßen noch in keiner mundtat, die > keiser oder künig gefreiet haben, nindert fride noch geleit haben; ...\\") and > his body should be free and accessible to all people and beasts, to the > birds in the airGrimm noted here in a footnote: hence outlawed, permissus > avibus; the older language also had another meaning: free as a bird.

Volume 3, p. 637\\" and the fish in water so that > none can be made liable for any crimes committed against him\\"sein leib soll > frei und erlaubt sein allen leuten und thieren, den vögeln in den lüften, > den vischen im waßer, so daß niemand gegen ihn einen frevel begehen kann, > dessen er büßen dürfe\\". Wigand, Das Femgericht Westphalens. Hamm 1825, p. > 436; cited by Grimm, p. 59 This ban also implied that persons sentenced thus were not to be granted any dwelling.\\"Aqua et ignis interdictus\\" () In the case of death one's body was not buried, but left for the birds to feed on.\\"permissus avibus\\" (Latin: free for the birds) According to modern research the cause for the spreading of the pejorative meaning is not to be sought there but rather in the language of the mercenaries and soldiers of that time. This theory is supported by the loan word \\"Preis\\" [price] in German (, ), which in this context is synonymous with the word \\"booty\\". Malicious people would be \\"preis gegeben und vogelfrey\\" [lit: given away and free as the birds].Still noted thus as a pair of terms in Constitutio criminalis Theresiana [Maria Theresa's Criminal Law], 31 December 1768 In Das Kapital, Volume I, Karl Marx uses the term vogelfrei to refer to the emergence of the proletariat during the decay of feudalism: > The proletariat created by the breaking-up of the bands of feudal retainers > and by the forcible expropriation of the people from the soil, this free and > rightless* [vogelfrei] proletariat could not possibly be absorbed by the > nascent manufactures as fast as it was thrown upon the world. On the other > hand, these men, suddenly dragged from their accustomed mode of life, could > not immediately adapt themselves to the discipline of their new condition. > They were turned in massive quantities into beggars, robbers and vagabonds, > partly from inclination, in most cases under the force of circumstances. > Hence at the end of the fifteenth and during the whole of the sixteenth > centuries, a bloody legislation against vagabondage was enforced throughout > Western Europe. The fathers of the present working class were chastised for > their enforced transformation into vagabonds and paupers. Legislation > treated them as 'voluntary' criminals, and assumed that it was entirely > within their powers to go on working under the old conditions which in fact > no longer existed.Karl Marx, Capital, Volume One, 1976, Fowkes trans, p. > 896. Marx calls this second group free or \\"bird-free\\" (vogelfrei), meaning at one and the same time that while the proletariat are not property (as slaves), they are themselves without property and cast out of the community of property owners.Jason Read, Primitive Accumulation: The Aleatory Foundation of Capitalism, Rethinking Marxism 14(2), p. 28.

Soult's cavalry under Jean Baptiste Marie Franceschi-Delonne overran la Romana's rear guard led by General Martinengo. Mansilla de las Mulas is a town located southeast of León, Spain. The combat occurred during the Peninsular War, part of the Napoleonic Wars. La Romana's Spanish corps cooperated with Sir John Moore's British army in its advance into northern Spain and in its subsequent retreat to the northwest. At Mansilla de las Mulas on the Esla River, the Spanish commander posted Martinengo's division to hold off Soult's pursuing French corps. The rear guard commander unwisely drew up his soldiers with the bridge at their backs. Franceschi's cavalry charged and cut the Spanish formation to pieces. Half of the rear guard were trapped against the river and forced to surrender, others were cut down by Imperial French sabers. La Romana abandoned León the following day. The next major action in the area was the Battle of Corunna on 16 January 1809. Battle Franceschi's 2,200 horsemen included the French 8th Dragoon Regiment, the 22nd and 1st Provisional Chasseurs a Cheval Regiments, and the Hanoverian Chasseurs. The 3,000 men and two cannons of Martinengo's 2nd Division of the Army of Galicia belonged to a mix of regular and militia battalions. The regular contingent was made up of two battalions each of the Naples and Navarra Infantry Regiments, two squadrons of the Reina Cavalry Regiment, and one squadron of the Montesa Cavalry Regiment. The Pontevedra and Segovia were militia units and the Volunteers of Victory was a newly recruited unit.

He was disendorsed in January 1972 and ran unsuccessfully as an independent at the 1972 state election. Thackeray was born in Mackay and educated at Mackay Primary School. He had a career as a grazier and on the railways before entering politics, working variously as engine driver, fireman, engine cleaner and union delegate. He entered politics at the 1957 election immediately following the Labor split of that year, defeating Labor defector and Queensland Labor Party candidate Viv Cooper on behalf of official Labor in the seat of Keppel. His seat of Keppel was abolished in 1960, and he successfully switched to its successor seat of Rockhampton North. He was subsequently re-elected in Rockhampton North a further three times. Thackeray had a poor relationship with the party administration throughout the later part of his career. Mike Ahern claimed Thackeray had been \\"on the outer with the ALP, partly because he was a left- wing meat worker and partly because he was useless.\\" Ahern further claimed that Thackeray had been leaking Labor tactics to Government Whip Vince Jones.

It is preserved in Coptic, Arabic, and Garshuni manuscripts. It was most likely originally written in Greek sometime between 70 and 132 CE by a Jewish author and then subsequently reworked into a second, Christian edition in the form of 4 Baruch. It is no. 227 in the Clavis apocryphorum Veteris Testamenti, where it is referred to as Apocryphon Jeremiae de captivitate Babylonis.Haelewyck 1998, 185; DiTommaso 2001, 302. However, the simple form Apocryphon of Jeremiah, which is sometimes employed, should be avoided as the latter is used to describe fragments among the Dead Sea Scrolls.Other forms of the title include the French, Histoire de la Captivité de Babylone (Amélineau 1888, 2:97); the German, Geschichte der Gefangenschaft in Babylon (Graf 1944, 213); and the Latin, Narratio de capta Jerusalem (Schmid and Speyer 1974, 188). Sources With the exception of Charlesworth, most scholars understand the History of the Captivity in Babylon to exist in two related versions.Charlesworth 1981, 88-89, sees them as \\"dissimilar Jeremiah apocrypha.\\" Stegmüller 1950, may also be of this opinion, for he has nos. 91.7-10 (Historia captivitatis); 120, 120.1 (Jeremias, Historia deportationis); and 114.8 (Reliqua verborum Baruch) as distinct works. For the consensus opinion, see Kuhn 1970, 97, 103-4; Kuhn 1991, 170; Coquin 1995; Haelewyck 1998, 185-87; DiTommaso 2001, 302; Herzer 2005, xxiv-xxv. Arabic version The beginning of the work in Paris BN Syr. 65 (Garshuni). The first version to come to the attention of Western scholars (1888) is preserved in Arabic and Garshuni manuscripts. The French scholar Émile Amélineau translated an Arabic copy (British Museum Or. 3599)Amélineau rarely identified his sources. We are indebted to Rieu 1894, 28, for this information. Amélineau translated BM Or. 3589, fols. 81b-105, 116-125, 106-115, a manuscript dated to the 17th century. in his collection of Tales and Novels of Christian Egypt.Ch. XIII, Histoire de la Captivité de Babylone; Amélineau 1888, 2:97-151. The title, as discerned from the first sentence, would be, \\"History of the Captivity of the Sons of Israel in Babylon, of the Chaldees.\\" In his brief introductory comments, Amélineau argued that certain expressions in the tale (e.g. \\"the whole earth\\" [la terre entière]) offered \\"convincing evidence that this story has been composed in Egypt\\" in Coptic.Amélineau 1888, 1:xix; cf. 1:lix-lxi. However, this view was challenged early on by Émile Galtier, who quipped, \\"one thing is certain--the primitive core of the account is neither Coptic, nor popular.\\"Galtier 1905, 178. In 1910, two more Frenchmen, Lucien Leroy and Pierre Dib, translated a Garshuni manuscript in the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris (Syr. 65).For a description of the manuscript, see Zotenberg 1874, 32. Leroy and Dib 1910-11 first transliterate the Arabic text into Arabic characters (from the Syriac characters of Garshuni) and then offer a French translation. The title, as discerned from the first sentence, would be, \\"History of the Captivity of the Israelites in Babylon.\\" Finally, in 1927, Alphonse Mingana produced an English translation of the aforementioned Paris BN Syr. 65 along with another Garshuni manuscript (Syr. 240) that Mingana had recently acquired in Kurdistan.Mingana and Harris 1927, 149, say that they were only aware of the earlier edition by Leroy and Dib \\"very late,\\" and presumably made little use of it. Paris BN Syr. 65 is dated by a comment in the manuscript to 1594 CE, while Mingana Syr. 240 may be dated palaeographically to about 1650 (p. 148). He thought that Syr. 65, \\"which is now in Garshuni was transcribed from a MS. written in Arabic characters and executed in Egypt. The same, however, could not be said of Syr. 240.\\" This observation, along with the fact that the two manuscripts preserve different recensions of the story, led Mingana to conclude that the surviving witnesses \\"may provisionally be divided into an Egyptian recension and a Syrian, Palestinian, or Mesopotamian recension.\\"Mingana and Harris 1927, 148 (= BJRL 11 (1927): 352). Mingana notes: \\"The discrepancies and verbal differences which characterise the two recensions are profound and unmistakeable.\\" In recent times, René-Georges Coquin has confirmed Mingana's notion of two principal recensions. He has examined additional manuscripts and proposed the following classification:Coquin 1995, 81-83. 1\\\\. Syrian. These are principally the manuscripts written in Garshuni: A) three Garshuni manuscripts in the Bibliothèque nationale de France: Syr. 65, Syr. 273, and Syr. 276;For descriptions, see Zotenberg 1874, 32, 212, 214. B) three Garshuni manuscripts in the Mingana collection, University of Birmingham: Syr. 240, Syr. 369, and Syr. 500 and Christian-Arabic 20 (28).For descriptions, see Mingana 1933-36, 1:485-6, 679-80, 919-20; 2:24-5. To the latter are to be added the Arabic manuscript British Museum Or. 3599 and American University of Beirut 280, no. 26, 6. The Syrian version is characterized especially by the replacement of Astarte by Zeus in the text, a modification that Coquin sees as most likely of Palestinian origin.Coquin 1995, 82. 2\\\\. Egyptian. These are principally the manuscripts written in Arabic characters and are also classified in two groups: A) Cambridge University Library, Syr. Add. 2886 (written in Garshuni and incomplete),Wright 1901, 2:737. Trinity College Library, Dublin 1531, 9,Abbott 1900, 409. and the Bibliothèque nationale et universitaire, Strasbourg, Or. 4180 (Ar. 33); B) about twenty manuscripts in the Coptic Museum in Cairo.For details, see Coquin 1995, 82; Graf 1944, 214 (the Nachträge list additional manuscripts [p. 671, = vol. 2, p. 487, in earlier printings]). Coquin argues that a special place in this categorization should be made for Paris BN Syr. 238.The account is found on folios 115r-137r; see Zotenberg 1874, 191. This version is written in Arabic characters for the first two thirds and then in Syriac characters for the final third. In addition to providing an older copy (dated to 1474 CE), it offers a redaction of the work much closer to the Coptic form.The similarity is closest to what Coquin calls Coptic 2. His examination of the manuscript revealed that \\"many readings are in conformity with the Coptic and in opposition to the Garshuni or Arabic manuscripts.\\"Coquin 1995, 83. A century earlier, Zotenberg had noted in his catalog: \\"This copy differs by a great number of variants of words, and by whole passages, with the exemplar contained in MS no. 65.\\"Zotenberg 1874, 191. Though noting this manuscript and the description in Zotenberg, Mingana decided to pay \\"no attention\\" to it, apparently not aware of its special nature.Mingana and Harris 1927, 148 (= BJRL 11 (1927): 352). \\"From this examination,\\" Coquin concludes, \\"it appears now possible to specify that the archetype was Egyptian and that from it two recensions derive, one Egyptian, naturally more faithful to the original, and the other Syrian, having been subject to Palestinian and Mesopotamian influences.\\"Coquin 1995, 83. Coptic version The beginning of the work in P. Morgan M. 578 (Sahidic). The Coptic version has usually been referred to in the scholarly literature as the Coptic Jeremiah Apocryphon, due to the editio princeps published by Karl Heinz Kuhn in 1970. The first evidence of a Coptic version came from a manuscript folio (Vienna K. 9846) that was published in 1909 along with a German translation by Carl Wessely.Wessely 1909, 51-54. The manuscript, which is dated to the ninth century, is in the Österreichische Nationalbibliothek and is written in Sahidic. That same year Walter E. Crum pointed out its relationship to the Arabic version translated by Amélineau and also revealed that another single folio, which directly preceded it in the original manuscript, may be found in Paris BN copte 1321, 16.Crum 1908/9, 55. The next folio, 1321, 17, also contains a portion of the work, though there is some doubt if it originally came from the same manuscript.Kuhn 1970, 96, thought it \\"originally formed part of one and the same codex,\\" though Coquin 1995, 80, says, \\"some doubt still remains on this subject.\\" The next year a Coptic manuscript was found (Pierpont Morgan Library M. 578)The manuscript, which is dated to the ninth century, is written in Sahidic, the work being found on folios 97v-130v. A brief but erroneous mention of the work was made in Hyvernat 1919, 18, which located the work in the wrong manuscript (cf. p. 11). There are photographic reproductions available in Hyvernat 1922, vol. 31, plates 194-260, though only twelve copies of this fifty-seven volume set were produced. that contained the complete text, though the existence of this version was not widely known until 1937. It was Crum who again called attention to the manuscript and further announced that remnants of a Fayyumic version were preserved on papyrus in British Museum Department of Egyptian and Assyrian Antiquities 10578.Crum 1937, 329. The latter manuscript is important as it is dated in the seventh century and thus serves as a terminus ante quem for the work.Kuhn 1970, 104. Finally Kuhn in 1970 produced a critical edition and English translation of P. Morgan M. 578, including in appendices the other Coptic witnesses.In his analysis, Coquin labels the complete version found in P. Morgan M. 578, \\"Coptic 1\\", and the version preserved in fragments, \\"Coptic 2\\". In 1980 Jean- Marc Rosenstiehl submitted a dissertation to the University of Strasbourg on the Coptic version, with French translation and notes, which regrettably still remains unpublished. The title of the Coptic version is, \\"Supplements to the Prophet Jeremiah\\" (Paralipomena Jeremiae prophetae), the same as the Greek work by that name, also known as 4 Baruch. Origins \\"Of the extant versions of the work,\\" writes Kuhn, \\"the Coptic is, no doubt, the primary.\\"Kuhn 1970, 103. As noted above, the first translator of the work into a modern language Amélineau thought the work originally was composed in Coptic,Amélineau 1888, 1:xix; cf. 1:lix-lxi. and Mingana at several points in his translation calls attention to a likely Coptic predecessor.Mingana and Harris 1927, 152, n. 5; 153, n. 4; 177, n. 5; 180, n. 12; 187, n. 1; 188, n. 3; 189, nn. 4, 8 (= BJRL 11 (1927): 356, n. 5; 357, n. 4; 381, n. 5; 384, n. 12; 391, n. 1; 392, n. 3; 393, nn. 4, 8). Yet, it is Coquin who has conducted the most thorough investigation of the dependence of the Arabic version on the Coptic. Though virtually all the surviving manuscripts are Arabic, none is earlier than the fifteenth century. The oldest, dated manuscript from those witnesses, Paris BN Syr. 238 (dated 1474 CE), which was mentioned above, shows a clear debt to a Coptic version. Among other things, it twice reproduces, rather awkwardly, the number 40 using the cursive Coptic character rather than the word, clearly indicating there was no understanding of the Egyptian model.Coquin 1995, 83-84. For examples of the cursive Coptic character, see L. C. Stern, Koptische Grammatik (Leipzig: T. O. Weigel, 1880), page facing 470. Amélineau had already observed that in BM Or. 3599 the Arabic translator transposes well-known topography of Alexandria to that of ancient Jerusalem; thus, instead of \\"Benjamin's Gate,\\" one finds \\"the Gate of the Sun.\\"Amélineau 1888, 2:101, n. 1. Furthermore, many Garshuni manuscripts refer to the Egyptian month Parmoute (= Barmoudah) and by doing this, as Coquin observes, they \\"betray their source, if not immediate, at least that of their archetype, because, one would not read such a name of month in a text written by a Syriac-speaking Christian.\\"Coquin 1995, 89. This feature had already been noticed in Mingana and Harris 1927, 187, n. 1; 189, n. 8 (= BJRL 11 (1927): 391, n. 1; 393, n. 8). There is also a strange scribal error in Paris BN Syr. 65, which yields the curious reading that \\"Zedekiah the King relapsed in sin before the Lord; he entered the house of the Lord and took out the two marble columns that illuminate without a torch and put them in the pool that was before the idols of Baal and Zeus.\\" Following which, \\"he set for himself a table near the pool of Baal and Zeus.\\"Leroy and Dib 1910, 272; discussed by Coquin 1995, 87-89. The word \\"pool\\" (birka) here is incongruous and the result of a scribe not understanding the word birba, a rare word borrowed from Coptic in Christian Arabic of Egypt (= Π (Coptic article masculine) + Ρ Π Ε (= temple)), which a non-Egyptian Arabic-speaking person could not understand, and thus slightly altered, leaving a rather odd narrative.The Arabic word birka / barkah / barkat occurs in Leroy and Dib 1910, 263 (lines 18 and 21); cf. J. Catafago, An English and Arabic Dictionary (London: Bernard Quaritch, 1858), 43. For the Garshuni form, showing the ease of corruption, see Coquin 1995, 88. Despite the detailed work by Coquin, Kuhn, and Piovanelli, it is the late and inaccurate Arabic version that is still used by many researchers.Piovanelli 2007, 240 n. 25, calls attention to the faulty conclusions reached by Herzer 2005 due to his reliance on Mingana's translation. Herzer 2005, xxiv n. 57, speaks of \\"the most likely secondary Coptic tradition,\\" though he actually cites Kuhn 1970 and Coquin 1995 in the same note! He obviously had not read these authors. Though we possess no manuscript evidence, the Coptic version most likely derives from a Greek original. Harris and Mingana both conjectured there was a Greek original.Mingana and Harris 1927, 127, 149 (= BJRL 11 (1927): 331, 353). Kuhn thought that \\"the wide range of Greek loan-words used in the Coptic text,\\" including some rather rare ones, was an argument for a Greek original. He concluded that \\"if the work in its original form was Jewish rather than Christian, it is very unlikely that it was at the initial stage written in Coptic. It may, therefore, be concluded, at least tentatively, that the Coptic version of the Jeremiah Apocryphon is a translation or recension of a Greek work.\\"Kuhn 1970, 104; cf. Wolff 1976, 53; Kuhn 1991, 170; Denis 2000, 1:712; Herzer 2005, xxv, n. 57. However, it is Coquin, who once again, has conducted the most thorough investigation of the issue, and he is of the opinion that the Coptic version is a translation of an earlier Greek original.Coquin 1995, 90-92; cf. Piovanelli 2000, 73; Piovanelli 2007, 240. In its present form the work is a Christian production.The heading in the Arabic version translated by Amélineau explicitly states that this work is read \\"on the Friday of Sorrows of Holy Week (la Pâque sainte). That its blessed prayers protect us\\" (Amélineau 1888, 2:97). He notes that the term \\"Friday of Sorrows\\" (\\"Vendredi des Douleurs\\") is \\"encountered rather frequently in Coptic works.\\" Harris noted in his introduction that there are \\"passages which look like evangelical reflections, but at the same time there are other passages which require the Talmud, or at least the folk-lore traditions embedded in the Talmud, for their elucidation.\\" Nevertheless, he concluded that there has not been \\"direct Jewish influence\\" on the work.Mingana and Harris 1927, 136-37 (=BJRL 11 (1927): 340-41). A very different conclusion was reached by the Talmudic scholar Arthur Marmorstein. He collected rabbinical material relevant to the study of the work and determined that in its original form the work was in fact Jewish.Marmorstein 1928, 328, says that \\"only with reference to the Talmud and Midrash can the work be explained.\\" His analysis has been generally accepted by later scholars.For example, Kuhn 1970, 103, writes, \\"the cumulative evidence adduced by Marmorstein would seem to be conclusive.\\" Guttmann 1931, 1093-4, was equally emphatic: \\"Through its relationship with the aggadic literature, the Jewish origin of the work is to be regarded as beyond all doubt.\\" \\"It is, therefore, very probable,\\" writes Kuhn, \\"that the work originated in Jewish circles and then was adopted, after some Christian redactorial activity, by the church.\\"Kuhn 1970, 103. More recent work by Pierluigi Piovanelli has argued that the work is in fact an authentic Second Temple Jewish pseudepigraphon, though it is preserved in Christian medieval manuscripts. He writes: \\"It should be stressed that the text bears almost no trace of Christian influence, the only exception being a manifestly secondary interpolation inserted into the middle of Jeremiah's address to the cornerstone of the Temple (ch. 28). Throughout the rest of the story, neither Jeremiah nor any other character makes any Christological prophetic statements.\\"Piovanelli 2007, 241. As for the dating of the original, it has already been noted that the earliest fragment of the Coptic version goes back to the seventh century. Thus, as Kuhn reasons, \\"If the work is dependent on Paralipomena Ieremiae which scholars assign to the 2nd century, the Jeremiah Apocryphon must be dated between the 2nd and 7th centuries.\\"Kuhn 1970, 104; cf. Kuhn 1991, 170. Marmorstein had suggested the 3rd or 4th centuries and was followed by Wolff and Denis, with Schützinger opting for the 3rd century and Gutmann going as early as the 2nd century.Marmorstein 1928, 337; Wolff 1976, 54; Denis 2000, 1:712; Schützinger 1973, 11; Gutmann 1931, 1093. Research in recent years has called for an even earlier date. In his still unpublished dissertation, Rosenstiehl says the author's ideology fits perfectly into the historical perspective of Judaism in the first century BCE, and, in particular, the religious problem caused by the desecration of the Temple by Pompey in 63 BCE. He suggests a date between the last decades of the first century BCE and the reign of Agrippa I/II (37-50 CE).Rosenstiehl 1980, cited in Piovanelli 2000, 78 n. 13. Piovanelli argues for the period between the two Jewish wars, which is 70/74 to 132 CE.Piovanelli 2000, 84. Content The work begins in a biblical fashion: \\"The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, saying, Say to this people: How long will ye sin, adding sin upon sin, lawlessness upon lawlessness? ...\\" Jeremiah is charged with delivering a condemnation of the Israelites for turning to other gods and instructed to deliver it to King Zedekiah (1-4)In the summary, the chapter divisions of Kuhn will be used. and after a confrontation with the false prophet Hananiah, is thrown into prison (5). The Ethiopian Ebedmelech obtains Jeremiah's release from prison (6). Jeremiah is again commanded to deliver God's message to the king, then arrested and imprisoned (7-11). Ebedmelech intervenes a second time to free Jeremiah from a pit of mire (12). The king and people continue in sin and a punishment is chosen (12-15). The angel Michael visits Nebuchadnezzar and convinces him to march on Israel, which he eventually does (16-21). Ebedmelech falls asleep in the garden of Agrippa (22). The Israelites, along with the king, are taken prisoner and suffer punishments (23-26). Jeremiah is told that the captivity will be spared if he can find one honest man, but he fails (27-28). The people are taken into captivity and after forty years Zedekiah dies (29-31). Nebuchadnezzar dies and is replaced by Cyrus, while Ezra emerges as a leader among the Israelites (32-35). After divine intervention, the people are freed from their captivity (36-37). Ebedmelech awakens from his seventy-year slumber to see Jeremiah's return to Jerusalem (38-40). Jeremiah enters the temple and a service of thanksgiving is performed (41).Similar, brief summaries may be found in Mingana and Harris 1927, 127-30 (= BJRL 11 (1927): 331-34) and Kuhn 1970, 98-100. The work relies primarily on the Bible for its subject matter. For instance, the first twelve chapters are an elaboration of Jeremiah 32, 37, 38. However, in the expansion it is not always clear whether the author is drawing upon extra-biblical material or his own imagination. Piovanelli describes the work as \\"a narrative midrash of Psalm 126 ('When the Lord brought back the captive ones of Zion, we were like those who dream ...').\\"Piovanelli 2007, 241. As for other possible sources the author of the work may have employed, Harris argues for the influence of the Arabic Diatessaron of Tatian;Mingana and Harris 1927, 132 (= BJRL 11 (1927): 336). Marmorstein points out numerous rabbinic parallels; and Gutmann and Kuhn mention 2 Maccabees 2.Gutmann 1931, 1093; Kuhn 1991, 170. The work is clearly related to 4 Baruch, to the extent that, as has been mentioned, the Coptic version shares the same title, Supplements to the Prophet Jeremiah. Earlier scholars have conjectured that the author of 4 Baruch used this work as one of his sources, though Jens Herzer cautions, \\"4 Baruch was not a literary model for the Apocryphon of Jeremiah but a known tradition freely used, shaped, and combined with others.\\"Herzer 2005, xxvi; cf. Kuhn 1970, 101; Kuhn 1991, 170; Mingana and Harris 1927, 133, 135-36 (= BJRL 11 (1927): 337, 339-40); for some specific parallels between the two works, see Wolff 1976, 53, n. 7. However, it is difficult to explain why someone possessing a copy of 4 Baruch would have reworked it into the much longer History of the Captivity. It has now been powerfully argued by Piovanelli that this work is the first Jewish edition of Supplements, and that 4 Baruch is a second edition, executed by a Christian hand: \\"The amazing part is that the Apocryphon actually resembles the first, Jewish edition that the specialists of source criticism had imagined in the background of the Paraleipomena.Piovanelli 2007, 242; cf. Piovanelli 1997, 14. As but one example, when Jeremiah commits the keys of the Temple to the tower for safe keeping (ch. 29), the time of restoration is fixed as \\"until the people return from captivity.\\" However, in the parallel narrative in 4 Baruch 3:7-8, when Jeremiah commits the holy vessels to the earth, the time has become \\"until the gathering of the beloved one.\\"Kuhn 1970, 304; cf. Mingana and Harris 1927, 173 (= BJRL 11 (1927): 377); Herzer 2005, 9; discussed in Piovanelli 2007, 243. Not only is there an alteration to the time for restoration, now linking it to a messianic figure, but the keys (or vessels) are not actually restored in 4 Baruch, as they are in this work (ch. 41). Undoubtedly, the greatest degree of correspondence between the two works may be observed in their shared narrative of the long sleep of Ebedmelech.The account of Ebedmelech's slumber is found in Mingana and Harris 1927, 167, 185-86 (= BJRL 11 (1927): 371, 389-90); Kuhn 1970, 293-94 (ch. 22), 320-22 (chs. 38-39); Piovanelli 2000, 87-90, presents the two accounts in parallel columns. The tale of an exceptionally long sleep is found in many cultures, with examples such as Epimenides of Crete, the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus, and Rip Van Winkle.For more details on the ancient sleep narrative, see the excursus in Herzer 2005, 84-90. However, the closest and most relevant parallel may be found in rabbinic literature. The Babylonian Talmud tractate Ta'anit 23a and Jerusalem Talmud tractate Ta'anit 3:9 both contain a very similar narrative concerning the wonder-worker Honi the Circle-Drawer (Honi ha-M'agel), who was supposed to have lived in the first half of the first century BCE.Herzer 2005, 85-6, presents both accounts. Piovanelli summarizes in tabular form the key elements of the narrative in 4 Baruch, Captivity, and the Talmuds and argues that there is \\"an almost perfect identity of scenery and subjects\\" between the narrative of the Captivity and the legend of the Jerusalem Talmud:Piovanelli 1997, 13. { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\"  Character  Context  Sleep  Place  Meaning  Consequences -valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"150pt\\"Ebedmelech, 4 Baruch width=\\"120pt\\"destruction of the 1st temple width=\\"70pt\\"66 years width=\\"90pt\\"in the shade of a tree width=\\"120pt\\"return from the exile of death width=\\"170pt\\"transition from sorrow to joy -valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"150pt\\"Ebedmelech, Captivity width=\\"120pt\\"destruction of the 1st temple width=\\"70pt\\"70 years width=\\"90pt\\"under a rock width=\\"120pt\\"return from the exile in Babylon width=\\"170pt\\"transition from sorrow to joy -valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"150pt\\"Honi, Jerusalem Talmud width=\\"120pt\\"destruction of the 1st temple width=\\"70pt\\"70 years width=\\"90pt\\"in a cave width=\\"120pt\\"return from the exile in Babylon width=\\"170pt\\"restoration of the previous situation -valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"150pt\\"Honi, Babylonian Talmud width=\\"120pt\\"out of context width=\\"70pt\\"70 years width=\\"90pt\\"under a rock width=\\"120pt\\"no return width=\\"170pt\\"death } In both the Captivity and the Jerusalem Talmud, the hero escapes the destruction of Jerusalem and deportation by falling asleep under \\"a rocky overhang\\" or in a cave (a detail modified in 4 Baruch), his sleep has a duration of 70 years (not 66 years), and his awakening coincides with the return from exile and the rebuilding of the Temple. As Piovanelli observes: \\"It seems clear that the story of the History and the legend of the Jerusalem Talmud go back to a time when you could still expect a benevolent repetition of history and the rebuilding of a third temple in about 140 years.\\"Piovanelli 1997, 14. The priority of the version in 4 Baruch has previously been argued for on the basis of its attention to geography and its odd selection of 66 years for the duration of Ebedmelech's slumber.For instance, Harris writes that the author of this work \\"had no geography and wanted none. All that his story needed was a cave for the sleeper and a basket of fruit\\" (Mingana and Harris 1927, 136 (= BJRL 11 (1927): 340)); cf. Herzer 2005, xxvi; Kuhn 1970, 101; Kuhn 1991, 170; Wolff 1976, 53. However, most of these analyses have relied on the later and more unreliable Arabic version. For example, Herzer writes that \\"the 'vineyard of Agrippa' becomes 'the garden of his master', probably because the connotations of the former were no longer comprehensible to the author of Apocryphon of Jeremiah.\\"Herzer 2005, xxvi. However, the Coptic version in fact reads \\"the garden of Agrippa.\\"Kuhn 1970, 294; the issue with Herzer's analysis is noted in Piovanelli 2007, 240 n. 25. As for the change of the sleep period to 66 years, Piovanelli explains that this alteration was made \\"in order to better highlight the futility of such hopes, which had resulted in the defeat of Bar Kochba and the proclamation of the Edict of Hadrian in 136 (= 70 + 66)\\", which barred Jews from entering Jerusalem on pain of death.Piovanelli 1997, 14. The change of the place of repose to the shade of a tree in 4 Baruch is unique among the ancient sleep narratives and reminiscent of the iconography of Jonah under the castor-oil plant (cf. Jonah 4:5-11) found on Christian sarcophagi after the fourth century CE.Piovanelli 2000, 90-91. Finally, the change of a basket full of figs, grapes, and other fruit becomes solely figs in 4 Baruch, which are portrayed with \\"salvific symbolism.\\" As Herzer explains, \\"Baruch understands the fresh figs from Abimelech's basket as a symbol of the reward of the pious, or the 'holy ones,' in the time of salvation, specifically the hope of resurrection.\\"Herzer 2005, 101; cf. Piovanelli 2000, 91-92, who discuses the correspondence of the Captivity to other second Temple Jewish texts/traditions on this detail of the fruit. All these changes in 4 Baruch have a decidedly later and Christian tone. Another parallel involves a miracle where the young Ezra carries water in his cloak, just as Jesus does in the Infancy Gospel of Thomas. { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\"  Captivity (Coptic)Kuhn 1970, 309-10.

And when his mother saw the miracle which was done, she kissed him, and kept to herself the wonders which she saw him do. } \\"It may be asked how we know that the priority belongs to the Gospel of the Infancy,\\" writes Harris, \\"May not Jesus' miracle have copied Ezra's, since both are apocryphal?\\" He goes on to argue that the reason for the priority of the Infancy Gospel of Thomas account is that it \\"is concerned with the proofs of the Divine Nature of Christ, especially of Christ as Creator, fulfilling his own statement that the Son does the same works as the Father.\\"Mingana and Harris 1927, 131 (= BJRL 11 (1927): 335). To that end, Harris sees it as a direct response to Proverbs 30, which speaks of \\"the Holy One\\": Thus, in Harris' analysis the passage \\"was supposed to contain a reference to the Son of God; and by the simple expedient of a miraculous carrying of water in a garment, the argument for Divine Sonship became irresistible.\\" However, Kuhn is not persuaded by this analysis, \\"particularly if it is asserted that the work is of Christian origin. Would a Christian transfer a miracle, the performance of which was attributed to Jesus, to Ezra? And if the work is of Jewish origin, would a Jew read and use the apocryphal gospel? Is it not, after all, more likely that this miracle story had been in existence for some time and was associated freely with the names of famous men to enhance their status?Kuhn 1970, 102. Piovanelli argues that \\"there is nothing to suggest that they [the water miracles] were inspired by late antique Christian apocryphal texts. The opposite could even be more plausible.\\"Piovanelli 2007, 242. Several scholars have discussed the way the author has looked to the Psalms for inspiration and material for the work. James Kugel discusses how the work twice alludes to Psalm 137 and how the modifications may be considered \\"an early form of biblical interpretation.\\"Kugel 1990, 197-201.

Not only that, but \\"when they do so they immediately begin to ascend into heaven, a miraculous ascent that leads the onlookers to think that the return from exile has begun, as the palace walls and the very heavens resound with God's praise.\\"Kugel 1990, 199; cf. Kuhn 1970, 312-13; Mingana and Harris 1927, 179 (= BJRL 11 (1927): 383).

In a similar fashion, Rosenstiehl looks at chapter 29 of the work and sees therein a commentary on Psalm 133, which interprets the psalm in the light of the Jewish Day of Atonement, in particular evoking part of the ceremony of this holy day, one of the most important of post-exilic Israel. He concludes that this work \\"illustrates the technique of the commentary as it is practiced in the intertestamental period: the text, stripped from the Psalm is glossed, explained in the light of legendary data and amplified.\\"Rosenstiehl 1979, 565.

He was born in Edinburgh, Scotland. Life Born Andrew Cochrane in 1767, at 'Bellevile' - a house near Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh, he was the youngest son of Thomas Cochrane, 8th Earl of Dundonald (1691–1778) and his second wife Jane Stuart (1722–1808). He became a cornet in the British Army in 1783. After returning from India to recover his health, he was elected to Parliament from Stirling Boroughs in 1791. In November 1793 he married Georgiana Hope-Johnstone, a daughter of James Hope-Johnstone, 3rd Earl of Hopetoun; she died in 1797. Cochrane added \\"Johnstone\\" to his name at the time of their marriage. Despite the opposition of Henry Dundas to his election in 1791, Cochrane-Johnstone supported the government of William Pitt the Younger, and was re-elected in 1796 in a race against his cousin Sir John Henderson, who was in opposition. In 1794 he was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel, and in 1797 was promoted to Colonel and then made Governor of Dominica (which terminated his position as M.P.) Cochrane-Johnstone served as governor on Dominica until 1803; an 1802 mutiny by the 8th West India Regiment was quelled with severity, but led to a court-martial of the governor on charges of embezzlement, arbitrary rule, using soldiers for private servants, and other charges. The court-martial in 1805 cleared Cochrane-Johnstone, but his military career was over. He had married Amelia Constance Gertrude Etienette de Clugny, a widow of Godet des Marais and the only child of a French governor of Guadeloupe, in February 1803; they were forced by Napoleon to divorce in May 1805. In 1807 Cochrane- Johnstone was elected MP for Grampound in Cornwall, a notorious rotten borough, along with his brother George, reputedly financed by their wealthy brother Basil. He was disqualified in March 1808 for lack of property. By then he had gone to the West Indies where he lived in the customs house in Tortola, which was under the command of another brother, Admiral Alexander Cochrane. Made an agent and auctioneer for the navy in the conquest of some of the other Danish islands, Cochrane through bribery and fraud illegally obtained captured goods; arrested, he escaped to England with his profits. One of his next business ventures (1809) involved manufacturing muskets for the Spanish government; in the course of this he engaged in smuggling and defrauded several of the Spanish colonial governments by failing to deliver promised armaments. Cochrane-Johnstone returned to Parliament in July 1812 after his brother George resigned in his favour; this was perhaps an expedient to avoid debtors. He was elected on his own account from Grampound in the same year, after a deal with fellow MP John Teed.History of Parliament Onliine, entry \\"John Teed\\" In February 1814 Cochrane-Johnstone was one of the chief organisers of the Great Stock Exchange Fraud of 1814; Cochrane-Johnstone and other associates purchased government securities just before spreadung a false rumour of the death of Napoleon. At the news of Napoleon's death, the value of the securities rose dramatically, at which point the conspirators sold them again: Cochrane-Johnstone was believed to have profited to the tune of £4931 (approx. £450,000 in modern terms). He was convicted of fraud and fled to France; he was expelled from Parliament on 5 July 1814. Cochrane-Johnstone's nephew Admiral Thomas Cochrane was also convicted; although he claimed innocence and the public was on his side, he was forced to resign and did not return to the British Navy until 1832. Cochrane-Johnstone fled to the West Indies, where he discovered that his property in Dominica had been seized, although he was able to take slaves from his plantation to a new establishment, a coffee plantation in Dutch Demerara. By 1829 he was living in Paris, France and fraudulent claims by him on the French government were being exposed. It was there (at 96, rue du Faubourg St Honoré) that he died in poverty in August 1833. The Earl of St. Vincent, Admiral of the Fleet, wrote of the Cochrane brothers in 1806, \\"The Cochranes are not to be trusted out of sight, they are all mad, romantic, money-getting and not truth-telling—and there is not a single exception in any part of the family.\\" Family Cochrane-Johnstone had an illegitimate son, Captain John Dundas Cochrane (February 1793 – August 1825), an explorer who published a Pedestrian Journey through Russian and Siberian Tartary in 1824. It is not proven, but is likely that John's mother was Georgiana Hope-Johnstone, who married Andrew nine months after John's birth. Andrew and Georgiana also had one daughter, Elizabeth Cochrane (26 December 1894 – 6 June 1883); she married William Napier, 9th Lord Napier in 1816.

Miller. It stars Ray Wise, Dana Ashbrook, Derek Mears, Fabianne Therese, Ryan Hartwig, and Jacob Reynolds. Synopsis Mob boss Bellavance (Ray Wise) is released from prison on bail, and discovers that $500,000 of his money is missing. With only two days to flee to a non-extradition country, he instructs four of his henchmen, led by Lloyd (Dana Ashbrook), to retrieve the money and send a “loud and messy” message to the thieves’ families. The last house they visit is a rural property belonging to Bill Rutledge (Boyd Kestner), who has just relocated with his emotionally disturbed young son Owen (Ryan Hartwig), his new wife Maggie (Lisa Rotondi) and her daughter Lauren (Fabianne Therese). Breaking in, the men execute Maggie and torture Bill for the location of the money, whilst another, Chissom chases Lauren. She is rescued by Owen however, who uses a baseball bat and box cutter blades to injure the man, allowing the two to escape. Owen attempts to rescue his father, but despite injuring another hitman is forced to flee into the woods with Lauren whilst Lloyd kills Bill. Inside the house, Lloyd and Freddie (Jacob Reynolds) uncover medical paperwork showing that Owen was institutionalised due to violent behaviour after permanently disabling three highschool bullies, scoring almost full marks on the aggression scale. His father was only able to get him discharged by using the money stolen from Bellavance. Chissom and Wydofski (Joseph McKelheer) follow the children into the woods, but the former is further injured by a booby trap set by Owen, whilst the latter is stabbed to death by Lauren when he gains the upper hand against her stepbrother. Under cover of darkness, Owen and Lauren break into a local used car dealership to obtain transport, however they are ambushed by the three remaining men. Freddie is killed when Owen stabs him in the skull with Wydofski’s hunting knife. Lloyd shoots Owen and takes Lauren back to the house, believing she can tell him where the money is located. However, Owen survives when the bullet deflects off a stolen hub cap he placed in his jacket earlier. A badly injured Chissom returns from the woods, and is shot by Lloyd for his incompetence. Following Lloyd and Lauren back to the house, Owen uses ammonia and bleach to create a chloramine gas trap that incapacitates Lloyd in the basement, before killing him by throwing a dresser down the stairs onto his head. The next morning, Owen and Lauren arrive at Bellavances hideout as he prepares to leave the country. He opens an envelope that contains Polaroids of his dead men, and then looks up to see the two driving the family rental van right towards him.

For example, this can be accomplished with materials such as dielectrics combined with metal plates spaced at prescribed intervals or wavelengths. The particular absorption frequencies, thickness, component arrangement and configuration of the materials also determine capabilities and uses. In addition, researchers are studying advanced materials such as metamaterials in hopes of improved performance and diversity of applications. Some intended applications for the new absorbers include emitters, sensors, spatial light modulators, infrared camouflage, wireless communication, and use in thermophotovoltaics. Generally, there are two types of absorbers: resonant absorbers and broadband absorbers. The resonant absorbers are frequency- dependent because of the desired resonance of the material at a particular wavelength. Different types of resonant absorbers are the Salisbury screen, the Jaumann absorber, the Dallenbach layer, crossed grating absorbers, and circuit analog (CA) absorbers. Broadband absorbers are independent of a particular frequency and can therefore be effective across a broad spectrum.

Biography Amico Agnifili was born ca. 1398 in Rocca di Mezzo, the son of a poor shepherd.Biography from Biographical Dictionary of Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church (His family had not yet adopted a family name, so when he was elevated to the cardinalate, he chose the name of \\"Agnifili\\", meaning \\"Friend of the Lamb\\".) His father sent him to L'Aquila to be educated. He later studied in Rome under Cardinal Domenico Capranica. Later, at the University of Bologna, he was a schoolmate of Enea Silvio Piccolomini, the future Pope Pius II. He received a doctorate of both laws. He then returned to L'Aquila, becoming a canon of San Massimo Cathedral and archpriest of San Paolo di Barete. He then moved to Rome and was named a canon of the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore. He then became a professor of law at the University of Bologna, where one of his students was Pietro Barbo, the future Pope Paul II. On 23 May 1432 he was elected Bishop of L'Aquila. While bishop, he served as a counselor to Alfonso I of Naples and his successor Ferdinand I of Naples. Pope Eugene IV named him papal legate to attend the coronation of Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor in Milan. He later served as legate several other times, including once as legate to the Patrimonium Sancti Petri. Together with Giovanni da Palena, Bishop of Penne, he was the commissary responsible for the canonization of Bernardino of Siena. He was also visited by John of Capistrano. When the city of L'Aquila rebelled against Ferdinand I of Naples, Bishop Agnifili sided with the rebels, which angered Pope Pius II. The rebels returned to their obedience in 1464. Agnifili's former student, Pope Paul II, named him general treasurer of the church in the Marche. In the consistory of 18 September 1467, Pope Paul II made him a cardinal priest; he received the red hat in San Marco, Rome the next day; and he received the titular church of Santa Balbina on 13 November 1467. In October 1468 he participated in the celebrations surrounding the marriage of Giovanni Antonio Carafa and Vittoria Camponeschi, parents of the future Pope Paul IV. On 13 October 1469 he opted for the titular church of Santa Maria in Trastevere. Pope Paul II put him in charge of overseeing the construction of fortifications at Civitavecchia. When the news of Paul II's death reached him, he left L'Aquila for Rome on 28 July 1471. He participated in the papal conclave of 1471 that elected Pope Sixtus IV. He resigned his bishopric in 1472 in favor of his nephew Francesco, but resumed possession of the see after his nephew's death in 1476. He died in L'Aquila on 9 November 1476.

Woodbridge was a major proponent of the Expatriation Act of 1868 The Expatriation Act of 1868 was an act of the 40th United States Congress that declared, as part of the United States nationality law, that the right of expatriation (ie. a right to renounce one's citizenship) is \\"a natural and inherent right of all people\\" and \\"that any declaration, instruction, opinion, order, or decision of any officers of this government which restricts, impairs, or questions the right of expatriation, is hereby declared inconsistent with the fundamental principles of this government\\". The intent of the act was also to counter claims by other countries that U.S. citizens owed them allegiance, and was an explicit rejection of the feudal common law principle of perpetual allegiance. The Expatriation Act of 1868 was codified at 25 Rev. Stat. § 1999, and then by 1940 had been re-enacted at .; the source does not specify the exact date of re-enactment It is now the last note to . Background The United States had, since its early days, implicitly denied the doctrine of perpetual allegiance through its naturalization laws. President Thomas Jefferson wrote to Treasury Secretary Albert Gallatin that \\"I hold the right of expatriation to be inherent in every man by the laws of nature … the individual may [exercise such right] by any effectual and unequivocal act or declaration\\". Other countries, however, did not recognise this position; indeed, the British Royal Navy's impressment of American sailors was one of the casus belli provoking the U.S. to join the War of 1812. Those countries' non-recognition of renunciation of their citizenship continued to cause problems for naturalized Americans during the course of the century. In the 1860s, France as well as various German and Scandinavian states attempted to conscript their natives who had become U.S. citizens when they went back to their homelands for short visits. France, Italy, and Switzerland however at least had procedures for abjuring one's original allegiance; Greece, Russia, and the Ottoman Empire did not have such procedures at all, and even sometimes punished their natives for acquiring U.S. citizenship. In response to this, President Andrew Johnson called on Congress in his Second Annual Message in December 1866 to assert \\"the principle so long maintained by the executive department that naturalization by one state fully exempts the native-born subject of any other state from the performance of military service under any foreign government\\". The problem was illustrated more acutely the following year when Britain charged naturalized Americans John Warren and Augustine Costello of the Fenian Brotherhood under the Treason Felony Act 1848. Johnson used this example to illustrate the urgency of the problem in his Third Annual Message in December 1867, stating that it \\"perplexes the public mind concerning the rights of naturalized citizens and impairs the national authority abroad\\". Debate and enactment In January 1868, the month after Johnson's Third Annual Message, the House Committee on Foreign Affairs issued a report on nationality issues; their report argued against the doctrine of perpetual allegiance, stating that countries which permitted emigration implicitly recognized the right to renounce one's citizenship as well. Nathaniel P. Banks, head of the Committee, introduced the bill that would become the Expatriation Act on that same day. One of the bill's major proponents was Frederick E. Woodbridge of Vermont. The initial version of the bill had harsh provisions for retaliation against the countries which refused to recognize the right to renounce one's citizenship; for example, if an American was arrested by his native country, the bill would have given the President the power to order the arrest of any of the subjects of that country living in the United States. An amendment added the preamble; the bill as amended was adopted in the House by a vote of 104 to 4. The bill then came before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations; the major amendment in the Senate was to ensure that the retaliatory measures taken by the President would be limited to those \\"not amounting to acts of war\\". The Senate passed the amended bill 39-7; the amended bill was concurred in by the House. The Expatriation Act came into law one day before the Fourteenth Amendment, which introduced the principle of birthright citizenship into the Constitution. The attitude towards emigration and loss of citizenship expressed in the Expatriation Act of 1868 was echoed by the contemporaneous Burlingame Treaty between the United States and China's Qing Dynasty, which stated that both signatory parties recognized \\"the inherent and inalienable right of man to change his home and allegiance, and also the mutual advantage of ... free migration and emigration ... for purposes of curiosity, of trade, or as permanent residents\\". Other migrant-sending countries also moved towards the principle of recognition of renunciation of citizenship as well, for example through the Bancroft Treaties. By the late nineteenth century, the doctrine of perpetual allegiance had died a \\"surprisingly speedy and unlamented death\\". Loss of United States citizenship under the Act=Early policies The Expatriation Act of 1868 did not explicitly create any procedure by which a U.S. citizen might exercise his or her right to give up citizenship. Existing law — namely, the Enrollment Act of 1865 § 21Long title: the Act to amend the several acts heretofore passed to provide for the Enrolling and Calling out the National Forces, and for other Purposes, passed on March 3, 1865; the relevant section can be found at — provided only two grounds for loss of citizenship, those being draft evasion and desertion. The Bancroft Treaties also had provisions that naturalized U.S. citizens would be deemed to have renounced their U.S. citizenship and resumed their original citizenship if they returned to their native countries and remained there for a certain period of time. Finally, in 1873, Attorney-General George Henry Williams wrote that \\"the affirmation by Congress, that the right of expatriation is 'a natural and inherent right in all people' includes citizens of the United States as well as others, and the executive should give to it that comprehensive effect.\\" However, William's statement was mostly used to justify the denaturalization of naturalized U.S. citizens. In general, a naturalized American who took up a position in the government or military of his native country was considered to have given up his U.S. citizenship and resumed his original one; however, naturalized Americans who did these same acts in other countries which were not their native countries were seen as having given up their right to U.S. protection, but not to U.S. citizenship itself. In particular, the State Department did not consider that mere establishment of non-U.S. domicile was sufficient grounds for revoking U.S. citizenship. There would be no legislation regarding grounds for loss of U.S. citizenship by native-born citizens until the Expatriation Act of 1907 (). Before then, the State Department and the courts seemed to agree that the only act which would cause a native-born citizen to lose U.S. citizenship was voluntary acquisition of citizen or subject status in a foreign state. Even foreign military service was not necessarily held to result in loss of U.S. citizenship; the precedent pointed out by Thomas F. Bayard, Secretary of State during the late 1880s, was that the U.S. did not consider the French who joined the American Revolution to have thus acquired U.S. citizenship. Similarly, voting in a foreign election was not held as definitive evidence of intent to give up citizenship, in the absence of an express acquisition of foreign citizenship and renunciation of the U.S. one. However, the Expatriation Act of 1907 and subsequent legislation would thenceforth broaden the number of actions which, if undertaken voluntarily, would be considered by the U.S. government to prove the intent to lose U.S. citizenship. Later case law In the 1950 case Savorgnan v. United States, the Supreme Court held that a woman who applied for Italian citizenship by virtue of her marriage to her husband had voluntarily given up her U.S. citizenship. Associate Justice Harold Hitz Burton wrote that: :Traditionally the United States has supported the right of expatriation as a natural and inherent right of all people. Denial, restriction, impairment or questioning of that right was declared by Congress, in 1868, to be inconsistent with the fundamental principles of this Government. From the beginning, one of the most obvious and effective forms of expatriation has been that of naturalization under the laws of another nation. However, due to the common-law prohibition of expatriation without the consent of the sovereign, our courts hesitated to recognize expatriation of our citizens, even by foreign naturalization, without the express consent of our Government. Congress finally gave its consent upon the specific terms stated in the Citizenship Act of 1907 and in its successor, the Nationality Act of 1940. Those Acts are to be read in the light of the declaration of policy favoring freedom of expatriation which stands unrepealed. And, in his footnote: :The above language [i.e. the preamble of the Expatriation Act, which he quoted], when enacted, was intended to apply especially to immigrants into the United States. It sought to emphasize the natural and inherent right of such people to expatriate themselves from their native nationalities. It sought also to secure for them full recognition of their newly acquired American citizenship. The language is also broad enough to cover, and does cover, the corresponding natural and inherent right of American citizens to expatriate themselves. In the 1957 case Briehl v. Dulles, the Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit held that the Department of State could lawfully deny issuance of a United States passport to an applicant who refused to execute an affidavit regarding his political affiliations. However, in a dissenting opinion, Judge David L. Bazelon argued that \\"[s]ince expatriation is today impossible without leaving the country, the policy expressed by Congress in 1868 and never repealed precludes a reading of the passport and travel control statutes which would permit the Secretary of State to prevent citizens from leaving\\". Chief Judge Henry White Edgerton concurred with Bazelon's opinion. The ruling in Briehl v. Dulles was reversed by the Supreme Court, but the reversal made no reference to the Expatriation Act of 1868. See Congress's power to legislate for implicit expatriation of Americans was later heavily restricted by the 1967 case Afroyim v. Rusk, which concluded that natural-born Americans cannot be deprived of citizenship by any means except a voluntary renunciation in the presence of a consular official. Associate Justice Hugo Black's majority opinion extensively discussed the Expatriation Act of 1868, including the history of proposed amendments to it.

NDTV.com. Retrieved 2 August 2013\\"Maldives crisis means trouble for India\\" . Zeenews.com. Retrieved 2 August 2013 began as a series of peaceful protests that broke out in the Maldives on 1 May 2011. They would continue, eventually escalating into the resignation of President Mohamed Nasheed in disputed circumstances in February 2012. Demonstrators were protesting what they considered the government's mismanagement of the economy and were calling for the ouster of President Mohamed Nasheed. The main political opposition party in the country, the Dhivehi Rayyithunge Party (Maldivian People's Party) led by the former president of the country Maumoon Abdul Gayoom (who was in power for over 30 years under an authoritarian system) accused President Nasheed of \\"talking about democracy but not putting it into practice.\\" The protests occurred during the Arab Spring. The primary cause for the protests was rising commodity prices and a poor economic situation in the country. The protests led to a resignation of President Mohamed Nasheed on 7 February 2012, and the Vice President Mohammed Waheed Hassan Manik was sworn as the new president of Maldives. Nasheed stated the following day that he was forced out of office at gunpoint, while Waheed supporters maintained that the transfer of power was voluntary and constitutional. A later British Commonwealth meeting concluded that it could not \\"determine conclusively the constitutionality of the resignation of President Nasheed\\", but called for an international investigation. The Maldives' National Commission of Inquiry, appointed to investigate the matter, found that there was no evidence to support Nasheed's version of events. In April 2012, it was announced that new elections were to be held in July 2013; they eventually took place later in 2013. Background Mohamed Nasheed, the first democratically elected president of the Maldives, whom the protesters were demonstrating against. Following nearly 30 years of rule by then-President Maumoon Gayoom, marked by allegations of autocratic rule, human rights abuses and corruption, violent protests in 2004 and 2005 led to a series of major reforms to the Maldives. The protests were organized by president Mohamed Nasheed and his party. Internal and international pressure forced then-President Gayoom to legalize political parties and improve the democratic process. Multi-party, multi-candidate elections were held on 9 October 2008, with 5 candidates running against Gayoom. A 28 October runoff election between Gayoom and Nasheed resulted in a 54-percent majority for Nasheed and his vice-president candidate Mohammed Waheed. A former journalist and political prisoner, Nasheed was a staunch critic of the Gayoom regime. In a speech prior to handing over power to his successor on 11 November 2008, Gayoom said: \\"I deeply regret any actions on my part ... (that) led to unfair treatment, difficulty or injustice for any Maldivian.\\" At the time, Nasheed was detained and imprisoned several times since the age of 20, for heavy criticisms against Gayoom's administration and its officials in relation with election fraud and high-profile corruption. Nasheed was tortured and treated inhumanely in detention. Gayoom was the longest serving leader of any Asian country, serving for 30 years. Mohamed Nasheed was elected president in 2008, becoming the first president to be elected by a multi-party democracy in the Maldives, and Dr. Waheed was the first elected Vice President in the Maldives. Their election victory ended the 30-year dictatorship of President Gayoom. Nasheed and the new government implemented many reforms in the country. In 2009, President Nasheed was awarded the Anna Lindh Award for bringing democracy to the Maldives. He has received many awards and international recognition for his role in bringing democracy to the country. Despite major political reforms, however, the Maldivian economy continued to suffer. Many factors have created for a poor economic situation in the Maldives, including the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, which devastated the Maldivian economy and caused serious damage on most of the islands of the Maldives. The 2007–2008 world food price crisis caused major rise in inflation, especially on food prices and the late-2000s recession created a tough economic situation in developing nations. There were improvements in the economy, however, as the Maldives was rated up in 2011 from being considered \\"least developed country\\". Furthermore, Nasheed faced issues during mid-2010, when Parliament members began resigning en masse. The Arab Spring broke out across the Arab world and had worldwide influence, including in the Maldives, which shares historic, cultural, regional and religious connections to the Middle Eastern countries facing protests. A GlobalPost article says that many in the international community consider Mohammed Nasheed the \\"Godfather of the Arab Spring\\" for his role in bringing democracy to the Maldives and the peaceful protests which led to his election as president.Maldives coup: \\"Mohamed Nasheed, Godfather of the Arab Spring, falls from grace\\". globalpost. Retrieved 2 August 2013  December 2011 demonstration  On 23 December 2011, the opposition held a mass symposium with as many as 20,000 people in the name of protecting Islam, which they believed Nasheed's government was unable to maintain in the country. The mass event became the foundation of a campaign that brought about social unrest within the capital city.  Attempted arrest of Judge Abdulla Mohamed  On 16 January 2012, the Maldives military, on orders from the interior ministry, arrested Judge Abdulla Mohamed, the chief justice of the Maldives Criminal Court, on charges he was blocking the prosecution of corruption and human rights cases against allies of former President Gayoom. Weeks of protests and demonstrations ensued, led by local police dissidents who opposed Nasheed's 16 January arrest order against Chief Justice Abdulla Mohamed. On 7 February, Nasheed ordered the police and army to subdue the anti-government protesters. Police came out to protest against the government instead. President Mohamed Nasheed resigned the same day by letter, and followed that with a televised public address. Nasheed later stated that he was forced to resign at gunpoint through a police mutiny and coup led by President Waheed.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/09/maldives-president- forced-resign-gunpoint There have been disputes over exactly what happened that day. Nasheed's vice president, Mohammed Waheed Hassan, was sworn in the same day as President in accordance with the Constitution at the People's Majlis in front of the Chief Justice. Waheed had opposed the arrest order and supported the opposition that forced Mohamed Nasheed to resign, but despite allegations he denied involvement in the coup. 2012 protests and resignation Nasheed resigned on 7 February 2012 following weeks of protests after he ordered the military to arrest Abdulla Mohamed, the Chief Justice of the Criminal Court, on 16 January. Maldives police joined the protesters after refusing to use force on them and took over the state-owned television station forcibly switching the broadcast opposition party leader Maumoon Abdul Gayoom's call for people to come out to protest. The Maldives Army then clashed with police and other protesters who were with the police. All this time no one of the protester tried to invade any security facility including headquarters of MNDF. The Chief Justice was released from detention after Nasheed resigned from his post. Vice President Mohammed Waheed Hassan Manik was sworn as the new president of Maldives. Former President Nasheed's supporters clashed with the security personnel during a rally on 12 July 2012, seeking ouster of President Waheed. Use of force by Nasheed Nasheed notoriously ordered very little use of force against the protests throughout most of the demonstrations. However, it was during his three years as president that the most frequent use of tear gas on public occurred. It was claimed that he ordered the police and security forces to use force against the protests in late January too as the protests were reaching escalating. It is claimed that police mutinied as a result of this. Use of force by the opposition Following the coup, the new government reacted very harshly to the counter-protests. Amnesty International has been very critical of the coup-implanted government's use of force.\\"Maldives: End use of excessive force against protesters\\". Amnesty International.

Protests continued the following day with thousands gathering in the capital and reported clashes with police and protesters. On 3 May, over 2,000 demonstrators clashed with Maldivian security forces in Male. Riot police reportedly used tear gas to disperse the protesters. Protests again broke out again on 4 May. Police used force to break up demonstrators and eyewitnesses say that police arrested a senior opposition activist. On May fifth, protesters began their protests at Artificial Beach. In the fifth night of demonstrations Parliamentarian and DRP youth Council President Mr. Ahmed Mahloof, Maldives national football team forward Assad Ali and several others was arrested. =December (opposition parties alliance)= An opposition alliance (Madhanee Ithihaad) was formed in December 2011, including all the parties that supported the President in his 2008 presidential race. Those parties included the Gaumee Party, the Jumhoory Party, and the Adhaalath Party (Islamist party). On 23 December, the capital city saw major opposition protests against Nasheed and his government. Former cabinet minister Mohamed Jameel Ahmed was repeatedly summoned to the police station in connection with the protests, at one point being detained at Dhoonidhoo, a Maldivian prison island. On 23 December 2011, the opposition held a mass symposium with as many as 20,000 people in the name of protecting Islam, which they believed Nasheed's government was unable to maintain in the country. The mass event became the foundation of a campaign that brought about social unrest within the capital city of Male. 2012January (arrest of Judge Abdulla Mohamed)= On 16 January 2012, the Maldives military, on orders from President Nasheed, arrested Judge Abdulla Mohamed, the chief justice of the Maldives Criminal Court, on charges he was blocking the prosecution of corruption and human rights cases against allies of former President Gayoom. The opposition claims that the arrest was unconstitutional. The arrest of Judge Mohamed was the ignition for further protests. Due to the arrest of the judge the opposition parties' protests gained momentum and demanded Judge Abdulla Mohamed's immediate release. During the detention of the judge, the HRCM was able to visit him in his place of detention, a military training base, and confirm his safety. Opposition leaders also called for an independent investigation into the constitutionality of the arrest, a call echoed by the Human Rights Commission of the Maldives, the Judicial Services Commission, the Prosecutor General's Office, the International Commission of Jurists, Amnesty International, and the United Nations Human Rights Commissioner. Military and police rejected the orders by High Court to release the Abdulla Mohamed. The opposition's protest in the Republic Square lasted for 22 days. On 6 February 2012, the Maldives Police Service declined to use force to control or disperse the protests and joined the protest. =February= There was an escalation in the protests and some protesters attacked the opposition-linked VTV television station. The police began a mutiny in late January. On 7 February, the protests reached their climax, with the military firing tear gas at demonstrators and police who were swarming the National Defence Force headquarters. In early hours of 7 February 2012, President Mohamed Nasheed was seen inside the military headquarters. The Maldives National Defense Force subsequently had a standoff with police who had joined the protesters, in which the MDF fired rubber bullets into the crowd. (The President's office, however, denied these reports.) On 7 February, Nasheed ordered the police and army to subdue the anti-government protesters and use force against the public. Police came out to protest against unlawful orders given to them. Amid the chaos the President resigned in front of the media after submitting a hand written resignation letter to the Majlis, as stipulated in the constitution. Following the forced resignation on 7 February 2012, Nasheed immediately informed the international community of the events surrounding his ousting and asked for early elections to preserve the country's fledgling democratic system.\\"The Dregs of Dictatorship\\", OpEd by Nasheed The New York Times, 8 February 2012 President Nasheed was claimed to have resigned stating that he wanted to stop the violence.

The protesters demonstrated against the coup and in favor of Nasheed. Supporters of Nasheed's political party, the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP), led massive demonstrations. On 8 February, the MDP convened an emergency executive meeting and called for its members to go into streets. President Mohamed Nasheed then attempted to lead the protesters to the Republic Square. Before his march reached the square, however, the Maldives Police Service dispersed the protest with batons and pepper spray.

Cancer insurance is relatively new trend within the insurance industry at large. It is meant to mitigate the costs of cancer treatment and provide policyholders with a degree of financial support. This support is based upon the terms written into a particular policy by an insurance company. As with other forms of insurance, cancer insurance is subject to charges, called premiums, which change depending on the risk associated with covering the disease. History In terms of the insurance industry, cancer insurance is novel form of coverage, having emerged approximately 50 years ago. This coverage was created by insurers like the American Heritage Life Insurance Company and Aflac to meet demand coming from those suffering from the disease. Cancer insurance was not designed to replace conventional health insurance coverage. Instead, this type of insurance is meant to augment conventional policies by providing coverage for a disease that is often associated with high out-of-pocket medical costs, even when coverage is provided through traditional insurance policies.  Types of Policies  Most cancer policies fall into two distinct types of plans: Scheduled benefits policies and lump sum policies.  Scheduled Benefits Policy  A scheduled benefit cancer policy usually has a long list of specific benefits that it will cover up to a certain amount. The benefit amounts in a single policy can vary wildly depending on what exactly the benefit is for. A policy will almost always cover hospital stays, standard cancer treatments, as well as transportation and lodging to and from an oncology specialist. For example, a scheduled benefit policy may offer a benefit of $20,000 for chemotherapy treatment, but a much smaller allowance for transportation to and from a specialist, as well as lodging for the patient and their family. A policy may also offer an up front cash benefit paid once a patient receives a positive diagnosis from a medical provider. These policies can be offered as a part of a group plan through an employer, or you also have the option to purchase them individually through an agent or direct from the insurance company.  Lump Sum Policy  A lump sum cancer policy, also commonly referred to as a cancer indemnity policy, will usually pay out a single amount upon a positive diagnosis. Most policies offered start at $5,000 in coverage and can go as high as $100,000 in coverage. These types of policies are generally available for adults of all ages and usually require very few medical questions in order to qualify. Most companies allow cancer survivors to enroll in a plan as long as they have been certified cancer free for between 5-10 years. In the United States, the benefits paid out in either a lump sum policy or scheduled benefits policy may not be taxable, depending on whether you or your employer paid for them, and whether they were paid for with pre-tax or post-tax dollars. Coverage benefits Cancer insurance policies typically offer wellness benefits (varies from state to state) that are meant to help those suffering from cancer or at risk of developing the disease adopt healthier lifestyles. These benefits vary depending on the insurance company providing coverage. These benefits can offer financial support for those pursuing healthy living programs, such as tobacco cessation, gym memberships, and dietary changes. Insurers may also offer access to information regarding healthy lifestyles, which policyholders are able to acquire at any time. Typical coverage benefits also provide policyholders with access to wellness tests that are meant for early detection of disease and monitoring other aspects of overall health. These tests include mammograms, Pap smear tests, and colonoscopies as well as many others. In many cases, those with cancer insurance must submit proof that they have received an exam to their cancer insurance provider. This matter is typically handled by the medical professional conducting the exam. Once the evidence of the exam has been submitted and verified, the insurance company will then provide the necessary financial support. As a supplement to traditional health insurance policies, cancer insurance and its associated benefits, are limited in scope. The benefits associated with these policies are often designed to mitigate the effects of cancer or encourage the prevention of the disease as a whole. Benefits come in different varieties depending upon the insurance company underwriting the policies. Many policies offer benefits concerning medical expenses, which include costs associated with health care, such as cancer treatment. Other policies offer benefits concerning non-medical costs. These benefits provide policyholders with financial assistance for transportation, food, home and child care, and certain bills.  Coverage limitations = Limited coverage of skin cancers  Skin cancer is the most commonly diagnosed form of cancer. The primary categories of skin cancer are basal-cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous-cell carcinoma (SCC), and melanoma. The first two, collectively known as non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC), are highly unlikely to metastasize and comprise the majority of skin cancer diagnoses. Many cancer insurance plans do not offer benefits for policyholders diagnosed with these non-melanoma skin cancers, or a large share of cases that are frequently called cancer. Other plans that provide both initial-diagnosis payments and recurring payments may not provide a lump-sum benefit for the initial diagnosis of a non-melanoma skin cancer.  Limited range of covered illnesses  Some cancer insurance plans cover only those costs associated with cancer itself. Under these plans, costs associated with any non-cancer illness that was directly or indirectly induced or complicated by cancer are not covered. For example, even though lung cancer increases risk of pneumonia, medical costs related to treatment of pneumonia that occurs after a cancer diagnosis would not be covered by a cancer insurance plan. Other cancer insurance plans may only cover costs that arise after a patient has developed cancer proper. Policyholders do not receive benefits if they are detected with pre-malignant symptoms or other conditions that show the potential for malignancy.  Limitations on outpatient treatment  Some cancer insurance plans only cover costs related to inpatient care, even though some forms of treatment may require outpatient care. Under these plans, cancer treatment given to a patient after they have left a hospital, including radiation and chemotherapy, may not be covered.  Pre-existing conditions  While cancer insurance plans have varying definitions of pre-existing conditions, they generally agree in that they impose restrictions on individuals who have already been diagnosed with cancer at time of enrollment. Some plans may not provide benefits for costs incurred due to a pre-existing condition during the first twelve months of coverage. Other plans may render patients completely ineligible if they have ever been diagnosed with certain forms of cancer, AIDS, or HIV.  Limitations on double coverage  Cancer insurance is a form of supplemental insurance that is meant to cover gaps in a patient's primary insurance plans, but in some instances, primary insurance plans provide cancer coverage benefits that overlap with those of the supplemental cancer insurance plan. While some cancer insurance plans will pay benefits no matter what the primary insurance plan pays, some primary insurance plans may include a coordination of benefits clause that prohibit double payment. Other cancer insurance plans may stipulate that patients cannot receive double benefits.  Coverage waiting periods  Some cancer insurance plans have provisions that prevent the policyholder from receiving benefits during a period after initial enrollment; this length is frequently thirty days. Some plans stipulate that if a policyholder is diagnosed with cancer in the first thirty days of coverage, their benefits are significantly reduced and coverage will subsequently be terminated. Concerns regarding coverage Health insurance eligibility is often subject to the risk management and appraisal practices of insurance companies. Because of the risks posed by serious health issues, such as cancer, companies often take a strong stance against providing new coverage to those with the disease. As such, typical health insurance policies do not offer coverage for cancer. In these cases, supplemental insurance policies, such as those designed to cover cancer specifically, can be useful. In the U.S., changes to health care laws have made it possible for those with pre-existing medical conditions to obtain insurance coverage.The Affordable Care Act, the law which has presented these changes, has required health insurance companies in the country to offer coverage to those suffering from conditions such as cancer. Though the law stipulates that these people must be granted access to health insurance, insurance policies are subject to the whims of the companies that underwrite them. As such, the provisions of these policies can vary dramatically depending on the health insurance company involved. In some cases, insurers design their policies to be financially unattractive to those suffering from costly medical conditions. As a supplemental health insurance plan, cancer insurance policies are meant to close the gaps left behind by conventional insurance policies. Even so, these plans may not provide coverage for the full extent of health issues related to the disease. Complications concerning the disease can have a tremendous effect on the availability of cancer insurance policies. One of the primary concerns regarding cancer insurance coverage is eligibility. Typically, those with pre- existing medical conditions, such as cancer, are not eligible for the coverage. The factors that determine eligibility vary from insurer to insurer.

Family origins  Juan's parents were Juan Núñez I de Lara (d. 1294), head of the House of Lara, and Teresa de Haro, daughter of Diego López III de Haro, the seventh Lord of Biscay and of Constanza de Bearne. Teresa was the sister of Lope Díaz III de Haro and of Diego López V de Haro, both Lords of Biscay.  Biography  In the chronicles of the king, Sancho IV of Castile, one anecdote is dedicated to this Juan Nunez where the monarch entrusts Juan with the care of his son, infante Ferdinand. According to Carlos Estepa Díez, this text reveals that between infancy and coming of age, it can be deduced that Juan Nunez II was brought for the first time before King Sancho IV (c. 1288), when he would have been around 12 to 14 years of age. In 1290, after a confrontation that his father had with the king, the queen, María de Molina proposed as a solution, the marriage of Juan Nunuez I's son with Isabel Alfonso de Molina, daughter of Blanca Alfonso de Molina, half sister of the queen and of Alfonso Fernández de Castilla el Niño, the illegitimate son of King Alfonso X of Castile. Throughout his life, Juan Nunez fought against and allied himself with both Diego López V de Haro and John of Castile in a strategic power struggle for land and influence over king Ferdinand IV. This lifelong fight culminated in the loss of most of Juan Nunez' lands and territories at the hands of the king when he surrendered to royal forces after a protracted siege of his town at Tordehumos. Lara managed to eventually regain his status and some of his titles after his participation and distinction in Ferdinand IV's invasion of Granada. While the expedition eventually ended in failure, Lara had several exploits, including the taking of the town of Gibraltar from Moorish forces. He also participated in the disastrous Siege of Algeciras of 1309 and retreated with the army in 1310. Lara was one of the few followers of the king who did not desert his service during the war. According to the chronicles of the King Alfonso XI of Castile, Juan Nunez II de Lara died in 1315 during the Courts of Burgos.  Marriage and legacy  In 1290 Juan married for the first time with Isabel Alfonso de Molina, who died in 1292. She was the daughter of Alfonso Fernández de Castilla el Niño, the illegitimate son of King Alfonso X of Castile, and of Blanca Alfonso de Molina, Señora of Molina and Mesa. This marriage produced no offspring. In 1295, he married María Díaz de Haro, daughter of the infante John of Castile and his wife, María I Díaz de Haro. The couple had no children. In 1300, he married a third time with María Díaz III de Haro, daughter of Diego López V de Haro, Lord of Biscay, and his wife, the infanta Violante de Castilla y Aragón. Without succession. Without descendants from any of his three marriages, coupled with his brother, Álvaro Núñez de Lara dying in 1287, when he died he ceded all his titles to his sister, Juana Núñez de Lara.

The first inhabitants to settle the site may have been the Bastetani, an ancient Iberian tribe. The Phoenicians founded their colony of Malaka ( ) (, Málaka) about 770BC. From the 6th centuryBC, it was under the hegemony of Carthage in present-day Tunisia. From 218BC, Malaca was ruled by the Roman Republic; it was federated with the Roman Empire at the end of the 1st century during the reign of Domitian. Thereafter it was governed under its own municipal code, the Lex Flavia Malacitana, which granted free-born persons the privileges of Roman citizenship. The decline of the Roman imperial power in the 5th century led to invasions of Hispania Baetica by Germanic peoples, who were opposed by the Byzantine Empire. In Visigothic Spain, the Byzantines took Malaca and other cities on the southeastern coast and founded the new province of Spania in 552. Malaca became one of the principal cities of the short-lived Byzantine ', which lasted until 624, when the Byzantines were expelled from the Iberian peninsula. After the Muslim conquest of Spain (711–718), the city, then known as Mālaqah (), was encircled by walls, next to which Genoese and Jewish merchants settled in their own quarters. In 1026 it became the capital of the Taifa of Málaga, an independent Muslim kingdom ruled by the Hammudid dynasty in the Caliphate of Córdoba, which existed for four distinct time- periods: from 1026 to 1057, from 1073 to 1090, from 1145 to 1153 and from 1229 to 1239, when it was finally conquered by the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada. The siege of Mālaqa by Isabella and Ferdinand in 1487 was one of the longest of the Reconquista. The Muslim population was punished for its resistance by enslavement or death. Under Castillian domination, churches and convents were built outside the walls to unite the Christians and encourage the formation of new neighbourhoods. In the 16th century, the city entered a period of slow decline, exacerbated by epidemics of disease, several successive poor food crops, floods, and earthquakes. With the advent of the 18th century the city began to recover some of its former prosperity. For much of the 19th century, Málaga was one of the most rebellious cities of the country, contributing decisively to the triumph of Spanish liberalism. Although this was a time of general political, economic and social crisis in Málaga, the city was a pioneer of the Industrial Revolution on the Iberian peninsula, becoming the first industrialised city in Spain. This began the ascendancy of powerful Málagan bourgeois families, some of them gaining influence in national politics. In the last third of the century, during the short regime of the First Spanish Republic, the social upheavals of the Cantonal Revolution of 1873 culminated in the proclamation of the Canton of Málaga on 22 July 1873. Málaga political life then was characterised by a radical and extremist tone. The federal republican (republicanismo federal) movement gained strong support among the working classes and encouraged insurrection, producing great alarm among the affluent. A new decline of the city began in 1880. The economic crisis of 1893 forced the closing of the La Constancia iron foundry and was accompanied by the collapse of the sugar industry and the spread of the phylloxera blight, which devastated the vineyards surrounding Málaga. The early 20th century was a period of economic readjustment that produced a progressive industrial dismantling and fluctuating development of commerce. Economic depression, social unrest and political repression made it possible for petite bourgeois republicanism and the labor movement to consolidate their positions. In 1933, during the Second Spanish Republic, Málaga elected the first deputy of the Communist Party of Spain, or Partido Comunista de España (PCE). In February 1937 the nationalist army, with the help of Italian volunteers, launched an offensive against the city under the orders of General Queipo de Llano, occupying it on 7 February. Local repression by the Francoist military dictatorship was perhaps the harshest of the civil war, with an estimated 17,000–20,000 citizens shot and buried in mass graves at the cemetery of San Rafael. During the military dictatorship, the city experienced the rapid expansion of tourism from abroad on the Costa del Sol, igniting an economic boom in the city beginning in the 1960s. After the end of the Francoist military dictatorship, the first candidate for mayor on the ticket of the Spanish Socialist Workers Party or Partido Socialista Obrero Español (PSOE) was elected, and remained in office until 1995, when the conservative Popular Party or Partido Popular (PP) won the municipal elections and have governed since. Prehistory and antiquity The territory now occupied by the Province of Málaga has been inhabited since prehistoric times, as evidenced by the cave paintings of the Cueva de la Pileta (Cave of the Pool) in Benaoján, artefacts found at sites such as the Dolmen of Menga near Antequera and the Cueva del Tesoro (Treasure Cave) near Rincón de la Victoria, as well as the pottery, tools and skeletons found in Nerja. Paintings of seals from the Paleolithic and post-Paleolithic eras found in the Nerja Caves and attributed to Neanderthals may be about 42,000 years old and could be the first known works of art, according to José Luis Sanchidrián of the University of Córdoba. Phoenician Malake Archaeological site of Cerro del Villar The first colonial settlement in the area, dating from around 770BC, was made by seafaring Phoenicians from Tyre, on an islet in the estuary of the River Guadalhorce at Cerro del Villar (the coastline of Málaga has changed considerably since that time, as river silting and changes in river levels have filled the ancient estuary and moved the site inland). Although the island was ill-suited for habitation, it is likely the Tyrians chose to settle it because of its strategic location, the possibilities for trade, and the excellent natural harbor. Sailboats heading towards the Strait of Gibraltar would have found protection there from powerful sea-currents and strong westerly winds. From Cerro del Villar, the Phoenicians began trading with coastal indigenous villages and the small community at present-day San Pablo near the mouth of the river Guadalmedina. Gradually the center of commerce was moved to the mainland and the new trading colony of Malake was founded, which was from the 8th century BC a vibrant commercial center. Economic development in the colony of Malake included industries for the production of sea salt and possibly of purple dye. The Phoenicians had discovered in the waters off the coast murex sea snails, the source of the famed Tyrian purple. The city had its own mint (Phoenician: sikka) and produced coins. The Phoenician colonial period lasted approximately from 770 to 550BC. Phoenician trade routes The dominance of the Phoenicians as a Mediterranean trading power waned after the destruction of Tyre by the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar in 572BC. Cyrus the Great conquered Canaan in 539BC, and Phoenician influence declined further. Their influence did not disappear entirely in the western Mediterranean, however, as their place was taken by the Carthaginians, whose capital city of Carthage had been founded as a Phoenician trading outpost in 814BC. It is likely that much of the Phoenician population migrated to Carthage and other colonies following the Persian conquest. Having gained independence around 650BC, Carthage soon developed its own considerable mercantile presence in the Mediterranean. Greek Mainake The Phoenician settlements were more densely concentrated on the coastline east of Gibraltar than they were further up the coast. Market rivalry had attracted the Greeks to Iberia, who established their own trading colonies along the northeastern coast before venturing into the Phoenician corridor. They were encouraged by the Tartessians, who may have desired to end the Phoenician economic monopoly. Herodotus mentions that around 630 BC, the Phocaeans established relations with King Arganthonios (670–550 BC) of Tartessos, who gave them money to build walls around their city. Later they founded Mainake (, Mainákē) on the Málaga coast (Strabo. 3.4.2). Dominion of Carthage Nebuchadnezzar II had conquered Canaan in 572BC with the intention of appropriating the rich Tyrian trade, and with the transition to Carthaginian domination of the western Mediterranean, Malake became in 573BC a colony of the Punic empire of Carthage, which sent its own settlers. The mercantile nature of the city, which developed during Phoenician rule, had taken hold, as well as such idiosyncratic cultural features as the religious cults devoted to the gods Melqart and Tanit. The second half of the sixth century BC marks the transition between the Phoenician and the Punic periods of Málaga. When the Phoenician city-states of the eastern Mediterranean were assimilated into the Persian empire in the 6th century BC, Carthage took advantage of their diminishing control over maritime trade. For two hundred years the Phoenician settlements had maintained close relationships with the \\"mother cities\\" on the coast of Syria and Lebanon, but from the mid-6th century, these connections shifted to the north African city of Carthage as it expanded its hegemony. With the arrival of the Magonid dynasty around 550 BC, Carthaginian foreign policy seems to have changed dramatically. Carthage now took the lead, establishing itself as the dominant Phoenician military power in the western Mediterranean. Although a Punic-Etruscan fleet of 120 ships was defeated by a Greek force of Phocaean ships in the naval Battle of Alalia between 540 BC and 535 BC, and Carthage lost two more major naval battles with Massalia, it still managed to close the Strait of Gibraltar to Greek shipping and thus contained the Greek expansion in Spain by 480 BC. Carthage proceeded to destroy Tartessos and to drive the Greeks from southern Iberia. It defended its trade monopoly in the western Mediterranean vigilantly, attacking the merchant ships of its rivals. During the 3rd century BC, Carthage made Iberia the new base for its empire and its campaigns against the Roman Republic. Although they had little influence in the hinterland behind the coastal mountains, the Carthaginians occupied most of Andalucia, expanding along the northern Mediterranean coast and establishing a new capital at Cartagena. The Romans conquered the city as well as the other regions under the rule of Carthage after the Punic Wars in 218BC. Roman Malaca Roman statue of Urania, the muse of Astronomy. It decorated the peristyle of a villa near Malaca. The romanisation of Málaga was, as in most of southern Hispania Ulterior, effected peacefully through a ', a treaty recognising both parties as equals, obligated to assist each other in defensive wars or when otherwise summoned. The Romans unified the people of the coast and interior under a common power; Roman settlers in Malaca exploited the local natural resources and introduced Latin as the language of the ruling classes, establishing new manners and customs that gradually changed the culture of the native people. Malaca was integrated into the Roman Republic as part of Hispania Ulterior, but Romanisation seems to have progressed slowly, as indicated by the discovery of inscriptions dating to the 1st century AD written in the Phoenician alphabet. During this period the Municipium Malacitanum became a transit point on the Via Herculea, which revitalised the city both economically and culturally by connecting it with other developed enclaves in the interior of Hispania and with other ports of the Mediterranean Sea. With the fall of the Republic and the advent of the Roman Empire, the territory of Malaca, which had already been occupied for two centuries by the Romans, was framed administratively as one of four legal convents into which the province of Baetica, newly created by order of Caesar Augustus, was divided. Baetica by this time was rich and completely Romanised; the emperor Vespasian rewarded the province by granting it the ius latii, which extended the rights of Roman citizenship (latinitas) to its inhabitants, an honor that secured the loyalty of the Baetian elite and the middle class. According to the Greek geographer Strabo, the city had an irregular plan, in the manner of the Phoenician cities. The Romans began the construction of important public works: the Flavian dynasty improved the port and Augustus built the Roman theater. Thereafter the emperor Titus of the Flavian family granted Malaca its privileges as a municipality. Reproduction of the Lex Flavia Malacitana, Loringiano Museum Malaca reached a high cultural and civic development in this period, having been converted into a federated city of the empire, and was governed by its own code of laws, the Lex Flavia Malacitana. The presence of an educated populace and their patronage of the arts had a significant bearing on this. The great Roman baths, remains of which have been found in the subsoil of the Pintor Nogales and the Cistercian Abbey, also belong to this period, as well as numerous sculptures now preserved in the Museo de Málaga. The Roman Roman theater, which dates from the 1st century BC, was rediscovered by accident in 1951. The theater is well preserved but has not been completely excavated. The Augustan character of the inscriptions found there date it from this period. The theater appears to have been abandoned in the 3rd century, as it was covered with a dump rich in small finds of the 3rd–4th centuries. The upper part of the stage was not covered, and its material was reused by the Arabs in the Alcazaba. Roman amphitheater The economy and the wealth of the territory were dependent mainly on agriculture in the inland areas, the abundance of the fishery in the waters off the coast, and the productions of local artisanal works. Among noteworthy Malacan products for export were wine, olive oil and the garum malacitano, a fermented fish sauce famed throughout the empire and in demand as a luxury item in Rome. Regarding the social aspects of religious practice in Malaca, it can be said that each ethnic group adhered to its own cult, as did imported slaves who clung to their native religions. In 325, the year of the Council of Nicaea, Malaca figured as one of the few Roman enclaves in Hispania where Christianity was strongly rooted. Previously, there had been frequent uprisings of an anti-Roman character catalyzed by the opposition to paganism of those Hispano-Romans affiliated with Christianity. Spain's present languages, its religion, and the basis of its laws originate from the Roman period. The centuries of uninterrupted Roman rule and settlement left a deep and enduring imprint upon the culture of what is now Málaga. Germanic invasions and Visigothic rule In the 5th century, Germanic peoples, including the Franks, Suevi, Vandals, and Visigoths, as well as the Alans of Sarmatian descent, crossed the Pyrenees mountain range into the Iberian peninsula. The Visigoths eventually emerged as the dominant power, and in about 511, they moved onto the Malaca coast. However, Hispania remained relatively Romanised under their rule—it did not see a decline in the perpetuation of classical culture comparable to that in Britain, Gaul, Lombardy and Germany. The Visigoths adopted Roman culture and language, and maintained more of the old Roman institutions. They had a respect for the legal codes that resulted in continuous frameworks and historical records for most of the period between 415, when Visigothic rule in parts of Spain began, and 711, when it is traditionally said to end. The Catholic bishops were the rivals of Visigothic power and culture until the end of the 6th and beginning of the 7th century—the period of transition from Arianism to Catholicism in the Visigothic kingdom—excepting a brief incursion of Byzantine power. Under Visigothic rule, Malaca became an episcopal see. The earliest known bishop was Patricius, consecrated about 290, and present at the Council of Eliberis (Elvira). After the division of the Roman Empire and its final crisis in 476, Malaca was one of the areas of the peninsula affected by further migrations of the Germanic tribes, especially the Silingi Vandals, who during the 5th century introduced the Arian heresy to western Europe. The province lost much of the wealth and infrastructure achieved under Roman rule, but maintained a certain prosperity, even as it suffered the destruction of some of its most important towns, as at Acinipo, Nescania, and Singilia Barba, which were not rebuilt. Byzantine Malaca Visigothic Hispania and the Byzantine province of Spania circa 560 AD The Byzantine Emperor Justinian I (482–565) conceived a military and foreign policy, the Recuperatio Imperii, to recover the territories which had formerly comprised the Western Roman Empire and were under the rule of the barbarians. It was led by his brilliant general, Belisarius, and succeeded in regaining North Africa, southern Iberia and most of Italy. Malaca and the surrounding territory were conquered in 552; Malaca then became one of the most important cities of the Byzantine province of Spania. The city was conquered and sacked again by the Visigoths under King Sisebut in 615. In 624, during the reigns of the Visigothic king Suintila and the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius, the Byzantines definitively abandoned their last settlements in the narrow area they still held. It is known that Sisebut devastated much of the city, and although it remained an episcopal see and the site of a mint built by Sisenand, its population was drastically reduced and its prosperous economy ruined. There is clear documentary evidence of the violent destruction of at least one commercial district. Such was the devastation that the first Islamic invaders of the old Visigothic county of Malacitana initially had to locate their capital in the interior, at Archidona. Eight centuries of Arab rule The Chronicle of 754, covering the years 610 to 754, indicates the Arabs began disorganised raids and only undertook to conquer the peninsula with the fortuitous deaths of Roderic and much of the Visigothic nobility. They were probably killed at the Battle of Guadalete against an invading force of Muslim Arabs and Berbers under the command of Ṭāriq ibn Ziyad. Roderic was the last king of the Visigoths, but his disputed succession to the throne and the resulting internal conflict may have contributed to the collapse of the Visigoth kingdom before the advance of the Moorish invaders. The Visigoths elected their kings outright rather than making the throne hereditary by right of succession, but Roderic had apparently led a coup and usurped the throne in 711. Hearing of Tariq's landing, Roderic had gathered his followers and engaged the Arab-Berber invaders, making several expeditions against them before he was deserted by his troops and killed in battle in 712.Collins, p.133 After Roderic's defeat, the Muslim armies, reinforced by more troops from Africa, faced little opposition as they moved north. By 714, the Muslims were in control of all of Hispania, except for a narrow strip along the north coast. Malacitana was settled by Arabs and Berbers, while much of the indigenous population fled into the mountains. The Muslims called the city Mālaqa (Arabic: مالقة), designating it as part of the region of al-Andalus. The military and political leader Abd al-Aziz ibn Musa became governor of the city, but his tenure did not last long. For forty years following his assassination in 716, al-Andalus was filled with chaos and turmoil as the Hispano-Romano residents rebelled against Muslim rule, until in 743 Málaga came decisively under Arab domination. A 19th-century reconstruction of Moorish Malaqah The invading forces were mostly Berber tribesmen from the Maghreb (the northwest of Africa), under Arab leadership. They and the other Muslim soldiers fighting with them were united by their religion. After the battle of Guadalete the city passed into the hands of the Arabs, and the bishopric was suppressed. Málaga then became for a time a possession of the Caliphate of Cordova. After the fall of the Umayyad dynasty, it became the capital of a distinct kingdom (taifa), dependent on Granada. The Muladi, or Muwallads, were in almost constant revolt against the Arab and Berber immigrants who had carved out large estates for themselves, which were farmed by Christian serfs or slaves.Bat Yeʼor, Miriam Kochan, David Littman, Islam and Dhimmitude, Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2002, ,Google Print, p. 62. The most famous of these revolts was led by a rebel named Umar ibn Hafsun in the region of Málaga and the Ronda mountains. Ibn Hafsun ruled over several mountain valleys for nearly forty years, having the castle Bobastro (Arabic : بُبَشْتَر) as his residence. He rallied disaffected muwallads and mozárabs to his cause, and eventually renounced Islam in 889 with his sons and became a Christian. He took the name Samuel and proclaimed himself not only the leader of the Christian nationalist movement, but also the champion at the same time of a regular crusade against Islam. However, his conversion soon cost him the support of most of his Muwallad supporters who had no intention of ever becoming Christians, and led to the gradual erosion of his power.El caudillo muladí Umar bin Hafsún, pesadilla de los emires de Córdoba When Hafs, son of Umar ibn Hafsun, finally laid down his arms in 928 and surrendered the town of Bobastro, Abd-al-Rahman III imposed the Islamic system of civil organisation in Mālaqa province. This allowed a new population distribution that encouraged urban development and the proliferation of farms in rural areas, as opposed to the pattern of feudalism dominant in the rest of Europe. The farmers practiced intensive irrigation-based agriculture, while artisanry and trade flourished in the cities—leading to prosperity and an era of peace in the province. Alcazaba of Málaga Surrounded by a walled enclosure with five large gates, Mālaqa city itself thrived; the Alcazaba, a Moorish citadel, was built in the mid-11th century on Mount Gibralfaro, a hill in the center of the city overlooking the port. The fortress comprised two walled enclosures situated to conform to the steep terrain. The Alcazaba was fortified with three walls towards the sea, and two facing the town. Antonio de Nebrija counted, in the circumference of the castle, 110 large towers, and a great number of turrets, the largest of which were those that surrounded the Atarazanas.Carter, p.308-309 New suburbs formed as the city expanded, including walled neighbourhoods, within which evolved the adarves characteristic of medieval Islamic cities; these were streets leading to private homes, with a gate at the beginning. The banks of the Wad-al-Medina (Guadalmedina river) were lined with orchards, and crossed from east to west by a route that connected the harbor and the fortress inside the city walls. Near the enclosure rose neighbourhoods settled by Genoese and Jewish merchants, independent of the rest of the city. The Jewish quarter of the medina produced one of Mālaqa's most illustrious sons: the Jewish philosopher and poet, Solomon Ibn Gabirol, who would be the first to use the term \\"Paradise City\\" to refer to his hometown. Besides the splendid Alcazaba, the marble gate of the Nasrid shipyards (atarazanas), and part of the Jewish quarter, other vestiges of Moorish Mālaqa remain today: a section of the monumental cemetery of Yabal Faruh, considered the largest in Andalucian Spain, has been excavated on the slopes of Mount Gibralfaro. Two burial mosques, part of a mausoleum, and the remains of a pantheon (a temple dedicated to all the gods) have been preserved as well on Calle Agua. The mosques date from the 12th and 13th centuries and were built on a quadrangular plan with single naves and mihrabs. Taifa of Mālaqa Málaga lusterware found at the Alcazaba In 1026 Mālaqa became the capital of the Taifa of Málaga, an independent Muslim kingdom which existed for four distinct periods: it was ruled by the Hammudid dynasty as the Rayya Cora in the Caliphate of Córdoba from 1026 to 1057, by the Zirí dynasty from 1073 to 1090, by the Hassoun from 1145 to 1153 and the Zannun from 1229 to 1239 when it was finally conquered by the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada. Vestiges of the urban plan of this era are preserved in the historical center: in its two principal monuments, the Alcazaba and the castle of Gibralfaro; and La Coracha, a walled passage of double ramparts built to secure communication between the fortress and the Alcazaba. Mālaqa had two suburbs outside the walls and enjoyed a thriving trade with the Maghreb. The city had an important pottery industry—terra cotta tiles were fired there and its ornamental vases, called Málagan lusterware, came to be recognised throughout the Mediterranean. Trade was regulated by the \\"Proper Governance of the Souk\\", a treatise on Hisba (business accountability) written by Abu Abd Allah al-Saqati of Mālaqa, in the 13th century. Nasrid Mālaqa After the death in 1238 of Ibn Zannun, the last king of the Mālaqa Taifa, the city was captured in 1239 by Muhammad I of Granada and became part of the Moorish kingdom of Granada. His brother Isma\`il became the governor of Mālaqa during Mohammed's reign (until 1257). When Isma'il died, Mohammed ibn Al-Ahamar raised his nephews Mohammed and Abu Said Faraj, the latter of whom would become governor of Mālaqa in his father's place. Mālaqa remained under the rule of the Nasrid dynasty till the reconquista of the Catholic Monarchs. During the reign of the Nasrids, Mālaqa became a center of shipbuilding and international trade. In 1279, Muhammad II signed an economic and trade agreement with the Republic of Genoa, and Genoese traders obtained a privileged position in the port. By the mid-fourteenth century, Mālaqa was the maritime gateway of the Nasrid kingdom, assuming many of the functions formerly held by Almería. The Genoese established a network of trade centers under their control around the Mediterranean Sea and connected the Iberian trade with that of northern Africa by Atlantic routes as well. Many of these communities organised cooperative institutions known as consulados (consulates) to connect merchants regionally and internationally. A ship's registry (logbook) written by Filippo de Nigro in 1445 shows that Mālaqa was an important part of this trade network and describes the regional system controlled by the Genoese Spinola family. As a stopover on the coastal navigation routes, Mālaqa became a crucial business hub with the rise of associated commercial activity.Porras, 2010 Fine ceramics made in Mālaqa were frequently given as diplomatic gifts. In the mid-15th century the king of Granada sent ambassadors to the Mameluke sultan in Cairo bearing them as presents. The workshops for their manufacture were located in the suburb known as Fontanalla in the foothills of the mountain El Ejido. Nasrid Arch of the Atarazanas The Mālaqa shipyards, the Atarazanas, were built during the reign (1354–1391) of Mohammed V to strengthen his political and military power. The main building, constructed as a naval workshop with probably some limited use as a warehouse, was one of Mālaqa's largest and most impressive, and was noted for its seven monumental horseshoe arches. During this period the coast was further inland and the Atarazanas was at the edge of the sea, so low that the water flowed in and formed a basin capacious enough to contain 20 galleys. The walls around it were eighty feet high; the arches, for the reception of ships, were sixty feet high by thirty wide, and twelve feet thick, and each of these arches had its own gate. The southern facade was described by Hieronymus Münzer in 1494: it had six open arches providing access to a high vaulted nave with transverse ribs under which the ships anchored. The seventh arch, located on the left, and still in existence today, was the entranceway to a large columned courtyard. There are two heraldic shields above the arch, designed in Castilian style and having diagonal bands inscribed in Arabic with the Nasrid motto, Wah lâ ghâlib ilâ Allâh (There is no victor other than God). At the western corner was a square tower attached to the portal and from there a wall joined the Borch Hayta, or Torre del Clamor, which closed the natural inlet between it and the Genoese castle, which is no longer extant. The tower served as a minaret for the muezzin to call the faithful to prayer at the mosque. At this time about 15,000 people lived in Mālaqa; most of them were Muslims strictly observant of religious orthodoxy as taught by the Fuqahā', the expert jurists of Islamic law. There was a sizable minority of Jews, while the presence of Christians was reduced to those captives taken in war, enslaved, and forced to labor in the shipyards, where light ships were built for patrolling the coast. The small colony of foreign traders was mostly Genoese. The governor of the city was typically a Moorish prince serving as a representative of the Sultan, and resided in the Alcazaba with his retinue of personal secretaries and lawyers. The large massive city walls, with their many towers, monumental gates and moat, all surmounted by the fortress of Gibralfaro, made the defences of the city nearly impregnable. The generally mountainous land around Mālaqa did not favour agriculture, but the Muslim peasants organised an efficient irrigation system, and with their simple tools were able to grow crops on the slopes; spring wheat being the staple of their diet. An unusual feature of Mālaqi viticulture was the interplanting of grape vines and fig trees, grown mostly in the Axarquía area east of Mālaqa. The raising of livestock, absent pigs because of Muslim dietary restrictions, played only a secondary role in the local economy. The production of olives was low, and olive oil was actually imported from the Aljarafe. Other fruit and nut trees, such as figs, hazelnuts, walnuts, chestnuts, and almonds were abundant and provided important winter foodstuffs, as did the mulberry trees introduced by the Arabs, their fruit being used to make juice. Trade in hides and skins and leatherworking was a major industry in Mālaqa, as was metalsmithing, especially of knives and scissors; gold inlaid ceramics and porcelain were manufactured as well. The production of silk textiles was still important and closely linked to the Moorish sector of the population. Light ships for patrolling the coast were built in the Atarazanas. In 1348, while the black plague ravaged Europe, the Alcazaba and the castle of Gibralfaro took their final shape. The city had several gates that allowed passage through the walls, some of which still stand today, such as the Puerta Oscura (Dark Gate) and the Puerta del Mar (Sea Gate). Looming over the port, the Alcazaba was the Moorish citadel built on the hill called Mount Gibralfaro in the center of the city, on whose summit was the castle. The citadel and the castle were connected by a corridor known as La Coracha between two zig- zagging walls that followed the contours of the land. Erected in the 11th century, the Alcazaba combined defensive fortifications with residential palaces and inner gardens; it was fortified with three walls towards the sea, and two facing the town. Antonio de Nebrija counted, in the circumference of the castle, 110 large towers, besides a great number of turrets. The same walls also enclosed the whole compound, though each building had its own entrance. The Puerta de los Arcos (Gate of the Arch) of the Torre del Tinel (Tower of Tinel) was the entrance to the Nasrid palace in the enclosure dating to the 13th and 14th centuries. Remnants of the old city wall remain today in Calle Alamos and Calle Carreteria. The Capitulation of Granada to Ferdinand and Isabella, by Francisco Pradilla In May 1487 Ferdinand and Isabella began their siege of Mālaqa, which after a desperate resistance was compelled to surrender. The victory was a bloody episode in the war for the conquest of the Kingdom of Granada, but the Christian religion was restored, and with it the episcopal see. The Catholic Monarchs had already taken the city of Ronda by storm on 22 May 1485. Its warden (arraez), the Moorish chieftain Hamet el Zegrí (Hamad al-Tagri), refused Ferdinand and Isabella's offer to accept his vassalage, and took refuge in Mālaqa, where he led the Muslim resistance. The siege began on May 5, 1487; the Nasrid troops held out till August, when only the Alcazaba, under the command of the merchant Ali Dordux, and the fortress of the Gibralfaro, under the command of Hamet el Zegrí and Ali Derbal, still resisted. The Catholic Monarchs besieged Mālaqa for six months, one of the longest sieges in the Reconquista. They cut off the supplies of food and water to the city, forcing its Muslim garrison to eventually surrender. On 13 August the Castilian army, over 45,000 strong, took the city defended by 15,000 African (Maghrebi) mercenaries and Mālaqi warriors. King Ferdinand decided to make an example of the resistors and refused to grant them an honorable capitulation, The civilian population was punished by enslavement or execution, with the exception of twenty-five families allowed to stay as Mudéjar converts in the Moorish compound. On August 18, Ali Dordux, after negotiating his group's status as mudejars, surrendered the citadel, but Gibralfaro had to be taken by assault, and its defenders were sold as slaves, while Hamet el Zegrí was executed. The conquest of Mālaqa was a final blow to the Nasrid kingdom of Granada, which lost its principal maritime port. The troops who served in the army of the Spanish victors were paid by the customary division of properties, the repartimientos. Between 5,000 and 6,000 Christians from Extremadura, Leon, Castile, Galicia and the Levante repopulated the province, of which about a thousand settled in the capital, now called by its Castilian name, Málaga. The city spread beyond its walls with the creation of the religious convents of La Trinidad, Los Angeles, Santuario de la Victoria, and the Capuchin monastery. Early Modern Era=The Mudéjars (1485–1501) The word Mudéjar is a Medieval Spanish corruption of the Arabic word Mudajjan (مدجن), meaning \\"domesticated\\", in reference to the Muslims who submitted to the rule of the Christian monarchs. By this means many Islamic communities survived in the Málaga area after the Reconquista, protected by the capitulations they signed during the war. These covenants were feudal in nature: the Moors recognised the sovereignty of the Catholic Monarchs, surrendered their fortresses, delivered all Christian captives, and committed to continue paying traditional taxes. In return, they received protection for their persons and property, and legal assurances that their beliefs, laws and social customs would be respected. The Treaty of Granada had protected religious and cultural freedoms for Muslims and Jews in the imminent transition from being the Emirate of Granada to being a province of Castile. After the fall of Granada in January 1492, Mudéjars kept their protected religious status, but in the mid-16th century, they were forced to convert to Christianity. From that time, because of suspicions that they were not truly converted, they were known as Moriscos. In 1610 those who refused to convert to Christianity were expelled from Málaga. The layout of the Muslim city was changed in the 16th century to suit the needs of the Christian conquerors, beginning with the construction of a wide road to allow the transport of merchandise from the main square, the Plaza Mayor (now Plaza de la Constitución) to the Puerta del Mar gate, in present-day Calle Nueva. At this time also the transept, nave and main chapel of the Cathedral of Málaga were built on the foundations of the old mosque. New churches and convents raised outside the walled enclosure of the city attracted the populace, leading to the formation of new neighbourhoods like La Trinidad and El Perchel. The artisanal productions of Málaga included textiles, leather, clay, metal, wood, building construction and prepared food. The city became a shipping center for export of the surplus agricultural output of the kingdoms of Cordoba, Jaen and Granada, as well as an entry point into Andalucia for a range of goods. 16th–18th centuries In 1585, Philip II ordered a new survey of the port, and in 1588 commissioned the building of a new dam in the eastern part, along with repairs of the Coracha. In the next two centuries the port was expanded both to the east and west. The Battle of Malaga by Isaac Sailmaker. Oil on canvas, 1704 Trade, dominated by foreign merchants, was the main source of wealth in Málaga of the 16th century, with wine and raisins as the principal commodity exports. The public works on the port as well as those on the Antequera and Velez roadways provided the necessary infrastructure for distribution of the renowned Málaga wines. The production of silk textiles was still important and closely linked to the Moorish part of the population. The real estate of the aristocracy was increased through the \\"refeudalization\\" occasioned by the sale of manors, a policy implemented by the nobility who monopolised high office. The mercantile operations of the town and its port were important to the national Spanish economy and the raising of revenue for the Habsburg government, but they suffered from the general corruption of the time, including the sale of important offices. From the 17th century to the 18th century, the city entered a period of decline, a consequence not only of the social disruption caused by the expulsion of the Moors, but also of flooding of the Guadalmedina River and several successive crop failures. Other disasters and disruptive events of the 17th century included earthquakes, explosions of gunpowder mills, and the conscription of men to serve in battle; nevertheless, the population increased. Málaga, as headquarters of the Capitanía General de Granada (Captaincy General of the Kingdom of Granada) on the coast played an essential role in the foreign policy of the Bourbon kings of Spain. The regional military, the supply of the North African presidios, and the defence of the Mediterranean were administered in the city. This involved massive defence spending on fortification of the harbor, the building of coastal towers and the organising of militias. The loss of Gibraltar to the British in the Battle of Málaga of 1704 made the city the key to military defence of the Strait. Málaga Cathedral During the second half of the 18th century Málaga solved its chronic water supply problems with the completion of one of the largest infrastructure projects carried out in Spain at the time: the building of the Aqueduct of San Telmo, designed by the architect Martín de Aldehuela. After the success of this impressive feat of engineering, the city enjoyed an economic recovery with a new expansion of the port, the revival of the works of the Cathedral, and the erection of the new Customs building, the Palacio de la Aduana, begun in 1791. The peasantry and the working classes still made up the vast majority of the population, but the emergence of a business-oriented middle-class lay the foundations for the 19th-century economic boom. By the 18th century, the port of Málaga, the linchpin of the city's economy, was again one of the most important on Andalucia's Mediterranean coast. Following the Decree of Free Trade in 1778 by King Charles III, which allowed the Spanish American ports to trade directly with ports in Spain, commercial traffic at the port increased further, and the population grew considerably. Major urban renovations were made in Málaga under the influence of the ideas of the European Enlightenment, bestowing on it many of its most characteristic features: the Cathedral, the harbor of the port and its Customs House, the Alameda, and the Antequera and Velez roadways. In 1783 a bayfront boulevard, the Paseo de la Alameda, a symbol of urban prosperity, was built on land reclaimed from the sea with sand dredged from the Guadalmedina River. By 1792 mansions had risen on either side of the avenue in the fashionable new residential area settled by the Málaga merchant class. 19th century The 19th century was a turbulent time of political, economic and social crisis in Málaga. The War of the Third Coalition (1803–1806) fought against Great Britain decimated Spain's maritime commerce while the deadly 1803–1804 epidemic of Yellow Fever killed more than 26,000 people in Málaga alone. The city suffered the further ravages of the Peninsular War, conflicts between royal absolutists and liberals, the end of the transatlantic trade with the Americas, the collapse of its industry, and finally the phylloxera epidemic that destroyed the vineyards of the region. On 2 May 1808 the people of Madrid rebelled against the French occupation of their city; this event was followed by the abdication of the royal family in Bayonne and the proclamation of Napoleon's brother Joseph as king of Spain. When news of the uprising reached Málaga, its citizens revolted against the French invaders, with the guerrillas in the mountains putting up the fiercest resistance. The Military Governor of Málaga province, General Theodor von Reding, held command of the First Division of the Spanish Army of Andalucia and was architect of the Spanish victory in the Battle of Bailen during the (Peninsular War). The French encountered strong resistance in Málaga and left much of the city in ruins when they withdrew. The war and revolts against Napoleon's occupation led to the adoption of the Spanish Constitution of 1812, later a cornerstone of European liberalism, by the Cortes of Cádiz. Málaga elected representatives to send to the national legislative assembly and a new constitutional Town Council which immediately implemented reconstruction plans. The French were decisively defeated at the Battle of Vitoria in 1813, and the following year, Ferdinand VII was restored as King of Spain. The burden of war had destroyed the social and economic fabric of Spain and ushered in an era of social turbulence, political instability and economic stagnation. Execution of Torrijos and his men, by Antonio Gisbert Although the juntas, which forced the French to leave Spain, had sworn by the liberal Constitution of 1812, Ferdinand openly held that it was too liberal for the country. On his return to Spain on April 16, 1814,Karl Marx, \\"Revolutionary Spain\\" contained in the Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 13\\", 436. he refused to swear by the constitution himself, and continued to rule in the authoritarian fashion of his forebears. Thus the first bourgeois revolution ended in 1814.Karl Marx, p. 391 The reign of Ferdinand VII from 1814 to 1820 was a period of a stagnant economy and political instability. Much of the country was devastated after the Peninsular War, and government coffers were drained to fight against the independence movements in the Latin American colonies. Political conflict between liberals and royal absolutists further diverted energy and resources needed to rebuild the country. There were several attempts to install a liberal regime during the absolutist reign (1814–1820). In 1820, an expedition intended for the American colonies revolted in Cádiz. When armies throughout Spain pronounced themselves in sympathy with the revolters led by Rafael del Riego, Ferdinand was forced to relent. On 9 March 1820 he finally accepted the liberal Constitution of 1812, and appointed new ministers of state, thus ushering in the so-called Liberal Triennium (Trienio Liberal), a period of three years of liberal government and popular rule in Spain. This was the start of the second bourgeois revolution in Spain, which would last from 1820 to 1823.Karl Marx, \\"Revolutionary Spain\\" contained in the Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 13, p. 442. Once again in the revolution of 1820, it was the independent towns such as Málaga that led the drive for constitutional change in Spain.Karl Marx, \\"An Unpublished Abstract from a Series of Articles called Revolutionary Spain\\" contained in the \\"Preparatory Materials\\" section of the Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 13, p.657. Ferdinand himself was placed under effective house arrest for the duration of the liberal experiment. The tumultuous three years of liberal rule that followed were marked by various absolutist conspiracies. The liberal government was looked on with hostility by the Congress of Verona in 1822, and France was authorised to intervene. A French army under the command of Duke of Angoulême, invaded Spain in the so-called Spanish expedition and overwhelmed the armies of the liberal government with massive force. Ferdinand was restored as absolute monarch in 1823, marking the end of the second Spanish bourgeois revolution. During the \\"Ominous Decade\\" (1823-1833), the name given to this period of return to the reactionary power of absolutism, the liberals suffered under a wave of repression and acts of vengeance. In 1831, the liberal general José María Torrijos, who fought against the absolutist regime of Ferdinand VII and for the restoration of the Constitution of 1812, set his field of operations in Málaga province. He and his men were captured in Alhaurin de la Torre after their betrayal by the governor of the city; they were executed by firing squad on the beach of San Andrés. Torrijos' remains are buried under the obelisk erected in his honor at the Plaza de la Merced. As Málaga pioneered the Industrial Revolution in Spain, its educated and entrepreneurial merchant class agitated for modernity in government, making Málaga one of the most rebellious cities of the country. The bourgeoisie led several uprisings in favour of a more liberal regime to encourage free commercial enterprise. In 1834, soon after the death of Ferdinand VII, a revolt was organised against the inefficiency of the government of the Count of Toreno (Conde de Toreno), who had been appointed prime minister by the queen regent, Maria Christina on 7 June. His tenure in the premiership lasted only till 14 September. A year later the civil and military governors of Málaga, the Conde Donadio and Señor San Justo, were killed in a violent insurrection.Blackwood's, p.572 Etching of a drawing of Málaga, 1836 The Ecclesiastical Confiscations of Mendizabal in 1836 resulted in a new initiative to modernise the city. Religious convents had accumulated property since the reconquest, and by the end of the 18th century a fourth of the urban properties bounded by the ancient city walls belonged to religious orders or similar fraternal organisations. With the seizure of the church holdings, many of these buildings were demolished and new buildings or streets or squares were built to replace them. The site of the convent of San Pedro de Alcantara became the Plaza del Teatro, while the convent of San Francisco was replaced by an architecturally refined square which became the home of the Lyceum and the Philharmonic Society. Economic expansion and industrialisation (1833–1868) The second half of the 19th century began a period of prosperity in Málaga, with an economy energised by the resumption of traditional mercantile activities and new industrial employment. This positioned the city as an important European manufacturing centre; urban renewal projects and the modernisation of local infrastructure were initiated by local government. Manuel Agustin Heredia's ironworks, La Constancia, located in San Andrés, started a run of productivity in 1834 that made it the country's leading iron foundry. Commerce grew significantly as the city attracted business entrepreneurs, and powerful families rose from the merchant class, some gaining influence in national politics. Notable among them were the Larios and the Lorings, the conservative politician Canovas del Castillo, the industrialist Manuel Agustin Heredia, and the Marquis of Salamanca. From 1834 to 1843, in the period known as Spain's third bourgeois revolution, the country was ruled under the liberal government of the Progressive Party (Partido Progresista).Karl Marx, \\"Revolutionary Spain\\" contained in the Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 13, p. 391 After these years of progressivist domination, the Moderate Party (Partido Moderado) gained control. It held power continuously during the so-called Década moderada (\\"Moderate decade\\", 1843–1854) under the leadership of General Ramón María Narváez, the Duke of Valencia, using the executive office to advance its economic goals and maintain public order. The Moderates were to the right of the opposing Progressive Party, but also characterised themselves as liberal. Like the Progressives, they supported Isabel II against the claims of the Carlists. Formal portrait of Queen Isabel II of Spain Isabella II of Spain took a more active role in government after she came of age, but she was unpopular throughout her reign. During the railway boom years of the early 1850s self-enrichment by senior Moderate politicians and members of the royal family was coming under mounting press criticism,The Birth of Modern Politics in Spain: Democracy, Association and Revolution, 1854-75 Part I: The Bienio Progresista in Eastern Andalucía, 1854-1856 Guy Thomson p19 Palgrave Macmillan Basingstoke, Hampshire 29 Dec 2009 a mood which would culminate in a fourth bourgeois revolutionary insurrection in the summer of 1854.Karl Marx, \\"The Insurrection at Madrid--The Austro-Turkish Treaty--Moldavia and Wallachia\\" contained in the Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 13, p. 267 This uprising began in the spring of 1854 as an expression of dissatisfaction on the part of the people against the government.See note 193 contained in the Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 13, p. 694. The people were protesting the growing economic hardship under which they had been suffering. On June 28, 1854, a military coup occurred in Madrid, led by General Domingo Dulce and General Leopoldo O'Donnell. The coup overthrew the dictatorship of Luis Jose Sartorius, 1st Count of San Luis. As a result of the popular insurrection, the Progressive Party obtained widespread support in Spain and came to power in the government in 1854.See note 193 contained in the Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 13, 694. The Progressives were the party of the National Militia, the jury trial, laicism, and of national sovereignty and the broadening of the franchise under census suffrage. Although riots in December 1854 accompanied the demobilisation of Málaga's radical proletarian Militia companies,The Birth of Modern Politics in Spain: Democracy, Association and Revolution, 1854-75 Part I: The Bienio Progresista in Eastern Andalucía, 1854-1856 Guy Thomson p23 Palgrave Macmillan Basingstoke, Hampshire 29 Dec 2009 a new Progressive Town Council was elected and port and consumer levies were withdrawn, taxes that the lower classes, who supported the uprising, abhorred. The expanding economy in all sectors required an increased money supply and capitalisation apart from that offered by the professional moneylenders. In 1859, Jorge Loring founded the private Bank of Málaga, the first to issue currency under the national Act of 1856. The bank's business was based in the booming steel and textile industries, and in commerce of the port; it operated under the control of the leading businessmen of the province. In 1862, Queen Isabel II and her consort Francis de Assisi de Bourbon visited Málaga to mark the official opening of the Córdoba-Málaga railway, the Málaga railway station, and an exhibition of provincial agricultural and industrial products. The visit had a diplomatic purpose as well, serving as a means to repair political relations with Málaga in particular and Andalucia in general; that year there had been a bloody revolt in the Granadan town of Loja which had spread to some villages in Málaga province, with half of the detainees convicted of rebellion being Malagueños. The Revolution of 1868 and First Spanish Republic (1873–1874) Juan Prim, general and statesman In 1866, a revolt led by Juan Prim was suppressed, but in 1868 there was a further revolt, known as the Glorious Revolution. The progresista generals Francisco Serrano and Juan Prim revolted against Isabella and defeated her moderado generals at the Battle of Alcolea. Isabella was driven into exile in Paris, and euphoria reigned in Málaga when General Prim and the other revolutionary generals landed at the port. However, two years of revolution and anarchy followed, until in 1870 the Cortes declared that Spain would again have a king. Amadeus of Savoy was selected, and duly crowned King of Spain early the following year. Amadeus—a liberal who swore by the liberal constitution the Cortes promulgated—was faced immediately with the impossible task of bringing the disparate political ideologies of Spain to one table. Following the Hidalgo affair, when he had been required by the radical government to sign a decree against the artillery officers, Amadeus famously declared the people of Spain to be ungovernable, and fled the country. In his absence, a coalition of radicals, republicans, and democrats formed a government and on 11 February 1873 proclaimed the First Spanish Republic, which was immediately under siege from all quarters. The Carlists were the most immediate threat, launching a violent insurrection after their poor showing in the 1872 elections. There were calls for socialist revolution from the International Workingmen's Association and pressure from the Catholic Church against the fledgling republic. Málaga did not recognise the new Republic until 12 February when pro-Republicans took to the streets and erected barricades. The Cantonal Revolution, a Cantonalist uprising whose goals included the redistribution of wealth and improvement of the situation of the working classes, spread locally throughout Spain in July. There were large disturbances in the city during the insurrection led by local militia leader Eduardo Carvajal; on 22 July a telegram from the civil governor, Francisco Sorlier, announced the proclamation of the Cantón Federal Malagueño Independiente. The Customs House was assaulted and many of its files and dossiers were burnt; factional clashes continued until General Manuel Pavía entered the city with his troops and ended the Cantón de Málaga on 19 September 1873. The chaotic situation in Spain caused officers in the Spanish military to plot against the Republic and in favour of Alfonso XII, son of the exiled Isabel II. On 29 December 1874, General Martínez Campos led a coup d'état in Sagunto to restore the throne to Alfonso XII. Prime minister Sagasta's Liberal government did not object to this development, and allowed the restoration of the monarchy. Restoration of Bourbon rule Alfonso XII After the tumult of the First Spanish Republic, Spaniards were willing to accept a return to stability under Bourbon rule. Isabella II had abdicated in 1870 in favour of her son, Alfonso, who was now duly crowned Alfonso XII of Spain. The Republican armies in Spain—which were resisting a Carlist insurrection—pronounced their allegiance to Alfonso in the winter of 1874–1875, led by Brigadier General Martínez-Campos. The Republic was dissolved and Antonio Cánovas del Castillo, a trusted advisor to the king, was named Prime Minister on 31 December 1874. The Carlist insurrection was put down vigorously by the new king, who took an active role in the war and rapidly gained the support of most of his countrymen.Earl Ray Beck, Time of Triumph & Sorrow: Spanish Politics during the Reign of Alfonso XII, 1874–1885 (1979) Antonio Cánovas del Castillo A system of turnos was established in Spain in which the liberals, led by Práxedes Mateo Sagasta, and the conservatives, led by Cánovas, alternated in control of the government. A modicum of stability and economic progress was restored to Spain during Alfonso XII's rule. His death in 1885, followed by the assassination of Canovas del Castillo in 1897, destabilised the government, though constitutional monarchy continued under King Alfonso XIII.Beck, Time of Triumph & Sorrow: Spanish Politics during the Reign of Alfonso XII, 1874–1885 (1979) There were social changes as well as economic ones in Málaga during the reign of Isabel II—the bourgeoisie solidified its position as an oligarchy in control of local politics, while a laboring class of industrial workers developed in the factories. The presence of these large factories resulted in the growth of an industrial and workers' suburb on the banks of the Guadalmedina river, separate from the residential areas of the bourgeoisie in the center and the eastern part of the city. The city's population continued to grow, creating a need for the expansion of civil infrastructure. Málaga's bullring, Plaza de toros de La Malagueta The monasteries were not only religious centers but also places where Málaga's cultural heritage was preserved and even, occasionally, where political power was exercised. Their spatial distribution affected the development of the city outside the medieval center: on the western edge the urban landscape began to take shape under the influence of industrial activity, while at the eastern end villas and hotels began to appear. With the seizure and subsequent demolition of old church buildings, the city gained new opportunities for growth. Communications were improved in the province with the construction of new railway lines to transport raw supplies and industrial products. Jorge Loring and Joaquin de la Gandara acquired numerous small rail lines and unified their interests in 1877 to found the Andalucian Railway Company (Compañía de los Ferrocarriles Andaluces), which owned most of the rails in Andalucia. This consolidation and expansion helped create a common regional market for trade goods. Málaga had substantial economic development in the first half of the 19th century, and by 1850 it ranked second in industrial production among the provinces of Spain, after Barcelona. The textile and steel industries generated a number of ancillary industries, including factories for soap, paint, and salt fish; breweries; timber mills; potteries; brickworks; and tanneries. Their production necessitated the building of a rail network between Córdoba and Málaga, which was connected with the national network on 15 August 1865. The city acquired public gas lighting on 6 July 1852, the Gas Lebón Company supplying the city with gas until 1897, when electrification was introduced. A public tram service with horse-drawn carriages began on 19 November 1881; in January 1901, electric power replaced the horses. In 1880 the city council formed a corporation to promote the construction of the Calle Marqués de Larios, in honor of the textile industrialist and financier Manuel Domingo Larios, The project was capitalised to one million pesetas by selling shares distributed in lots of forty shares of 25,000 pesetas each, most of them acquired by the Larios family. The plans were drawn and the works directed by architect Eduardo Strachan; the grand street opened in 1890. This was the beginning of the modernisation of the city envisioned by Theodor von Reding and executed by the architects Manuel Rivera Vera, Jerónimo Cuervo and Fernando Guerrero Strachan. The rise of dissident workers' organisations and the increase of labor conflict with the oligarchy reflected social tensions at the end of the century. The origins of the socialist unions in Málaga date to a workers' athenaeum founded in 1884 by Rafael Salinas Sánchez, known popularly as the \\"apostle\\" of socialism. Sánchez was born on 21 June 1850 to a working-class family in the El Perchel barrio. His childhood family life was marked by the typical hardships of the working classes of the 19th century. As a young man he became an active member of the workers' unions, notably the International Association of Workers, and was forced into exile in 1874 for two years in Cuba during the Restoration. In 1884 he founded, with Antonio Valenzuela, the Agrupación Socialista de Málaga. That the socialist cause was taking hold in the provincial capital was evidenced by the more than 2,000 attendees at a rally in 1890 at the Café El Turco. While running as a candidate for Parliament in 1891, Salinas organised local chapters in eastern Andalucia of the Unión General de Trabajadores (UGT), or General Union of Workers, which held its Third National Congress in Málaga in 1892. They produced plans to assuage the working conditions of workers in the Larios' textile factory, but Salinas was jailed for his support of the workers and harassed by the authorities. The Partido Socialista Obrero Español (PSOE), or Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, and the UGT were repressed throughout the province in the following years, which saw frequent clashes between workers and employers. Economic crisis of 1893 and decline at the end of the century The end of the economic boom in 19th century Málaga started in 1880 when the high cost of importing coal for steel production made its foundries less competitive with those of the industrial complexes in northern Spain. The economic crisis of 1893 finally forced the closing of the La Constancia iron foundry and was accompanied by the collapse of the sugar industry and the spread of the phylloxera blight, which devastated the vineyards of the province. The abandonment of farms and consequent neglect of the terraces where the vineyards were cultivated resulted in gradual deforestation of the slopes, causing increased flooding after heavy rains, with severe erosion in the beds of the streams and rivers of virtually the entire coastal area. The more vulnerable sections of society were hardest hit by the repercussions of the economic crisis, especially farm laborers and small landholders in the rural areas, along with industrial workers and artisans in the urban areas. Tens of thousands of Malagueños emigrated overseas in search of better opportunities. The social disruption caused by the crisis and its aftermath of job loss, business collapse and general decline in economic activity, led many residents to consider other means of livelihood. Even at this early date some of them envisaged tourism as an alternative source of income, but years passed before initiatives were put forward to develop Málaga as a tourist resort. The Sociedad Propagandística del Clima y Embellecimiento de Málaga (Propagation Society for the Climate and Beautification of Málaga) was founded in 1897 by a pioneering group of influential Málaga businessmen who saw the potential of tourism as a generator of wealth, and tried to organise a rational planned development of this sector of the economy. Their promotional campaigns extolled the mild climate of Málaga, attracting enough tourists and winter visitors to help relieve the economic slump. Twentieth century The economic depression that gripped Málaga at the end of the 19th century continued during the first few years of the 20th century. Caciquism, government by local political bosses, prevailed in Andalucia. Monarchist parties dominated the political environment by turns, nevertheless the recession worsened. The depressed economy, social conflict and a government dominated by political patronage made oligarchy and caciqueism the distinguishing political features of a province lagging in its development as the 1900s began. In this context, bourgeois republicanism and the labor movements found new support. The beginning of the 20th century was a time of readjustment and contrast in Málaga with the expansion and improvement of agriculture, which had become the dominant economic sector. There was a progressive dismantling of industry accompanied by fluctuating commercial activity. All this occurred within a backward and barely literate society, where oligarchs exercised political control and manipulated the economy. Primary education in the city was plagued by funding deficits and a lack of schools and places for students and teachers, while secondary education was limited and university education nonexistent. Málaga faced the new century in the midst of an economic depression with the attendant social unrest and a weak structure of the state; meanwhile the republicans and the labor movement found common ground. The city's commercial activity, though still significant, lacked the vigor that had characterised the economy throughout most of the 19th century. Infrastructure was improved with the inauguration of a tram line, the entry into service of the Suburban Railway (Ferrocarriles Suburbanos de Málaga) with two commuter lines, and the opening of a hydroelectric plant in El Chorro. In 1919 the Málaga Airport was created as a stop on the passage route (Toulouse – Barcelona – Alicante – Málaga – Casablanca) of the first airline established in Spain. Málaga during World War I (1914–1918) Spain's neutrality in World War I allowed it to become a supplier of material for both sides to its great advantage. The export of raw agricultural products, minerals, textiles and steel prompted an economic boom; subsequently the surplus balance of trade grew to over five hundred million pesetas.Genoveva Garcia Queipo, op. cit. pg. 18. The extraordinary growth in business profits favoured industrial oligarchs and the merchant middle class, but increases in wages for workers did not keep pace with inflation—overall standards of living for the masses actually decreased. The urban industrial proletariat, meanwhile, kept up continuous pressure for wage increases. \\"The 1917 Crisis\\" (Crisis de 1917) is the name given by Spanish historians to events of the summer of 1917 in Spain, primarily three simultaneous movements that challenged the government: a military movement (the Juntas), a political movement (the Parliamentary Assembly of Catalanist and Spanish Republican deputies in Barcelona), and a social movement (the revolutionary general strike). Spain's economy suffered upon the decline of the wartime economic activity. Following the end of the war, the fall in foreign demand depressed the agricultural, industrial and trade markets. With the loss of these, protective measures were demanded by workers as the downward pressure of prices on salaries intensified. Employers argued that the solution was to reduce product costs, lower labor costs and increase productivity, but the workers refused to accept their propositions. Factories closed, unemployment soared and wages declined. Expecting class conflict, especially in light of the recent Russian Revolution, much of the capitalist class began a bitter war against the unions, particularly the CNT or Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (National Confederation of Labor). Lockouts became more frequent. Known militants were blacklisted. Pistoleros, or assassins, were hired to kill union leaders. Scores, perhaps hundreds, of anarchists were murdered during this period. Anarchists responded in turn with a number of assassinations, the most famous of which is the murder of Prime Minister Eduardo Dato Iradier. The pandemic outbreak of influenza in the spring of 1918, along with a major economic slowdown in the postwar period, hit Spain particularly hard, and the country went into debt. From that moment the social conflict was to come to a head. The post-World War I economic difficulties heightened social unrest among urban industrial workers and rural peasants, with a period of strikes and agitation in both the city and the countryside. The Cortes (Spanish parliament) under the constitutional monarchy seemed to have no solution to Spain's unemployment, labor strikes, and poverty. The socialists and anarchists pressed for radical changes, but the government proved unable to reform itself or the nation and frustration mounted. The various socialist factions had consolidated their organisations and from 1909 had become more influential in Málaga, while anarchism was gaining popular support. \\"The Bolshevik triennium\\" (1918–1920) saw a major outbreak of strikes and land occupations, triggered by news of the Russian Revolution and deteriorating economic conditions in the countryside. This was a time of conflict for the workers' movements in Andalucia and one of reorganisation for those in Málaga. In 1919 Málaga and Seville provinces had the greatest CNT presence, and Málaga was the Andalucian city with the most local affiliates. The general elections of 1 June 1919 resulted in the Conservative Party winning 198 seats in the Cortes Generales, revealing the weakness of the republican parties. Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera (1923–1930) On 13 September 1923, General Miguel Primo de Rivera, at the time Captain General of Barcelona, led a military revolt against the parliamentary government, and established himself as dictator. He proposed to keep the dictatorship in place long enough to clean up the mess created by the politicians, and in the meantime, he would use the state to modernise the economy and alleviate the problems of the working class. Primo de Rivera set his economic planners to building infrastructure for the country. Hydroelectric dams were constructed to provide water for irrigation and to bring electricity to some of Spain's rural regions. Spain had few cars when he came to power; by 1930, it possessed a network of automobile roads. His regime upgraded the country's railroads, helping the Spanish iron and steel industry to recover. Public works carried out in Málaga included the planning and creation of the Ciudad Jardín district and construction of the Gaitanejo reservoir (accomplished with private financing) in El Chorro. Between 1923 and 1927, foreign trade increased three hundred per cent, although the government intervened to protect national producers from foreign competition. Primo de Rivera enjoyed some success in improving relations with the labor unions and in public works projects, but failed to win the support of the middle classes. His allegiance to the land- holding class prevented fundamental agrarian reforms, and he repressed human rights in Catalonia. The census for this period shows lower population densities in Málaga province due to high levels of emigration, mostly to the Americas. With the fragmentation of the monarchist parties, the republicans regrouped and the socialist workers movements grew stronger. Even in an era of repression of basic civil rights and little cultural development, an intellectual movement to cultivate the fine arts, the humanities and science arose in the tertulias of Málaga. This would profoundly influence the evolution of cultural pursuits in the city. In 1925 the poets Emilio Prados (1899–1962) and Manuel Altolaguirre (1905–1959) became editors for the Sur printing house in Málaga. Sur was responsible for publishing most of the work of the Generation of '27, and the quality of their editing brought Prados and Altolaguirre international prestige. In 1926 they founded the magazine Litoral, one of the most influential literary and artistic publications of 1920s Spain. Spanish Writers on Gay and Lesbian Themes: A Bio-Critical Sourcebook edited by David William Foster, p125, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999 Federico García Lorca's Canciones, published in 1927 as the first supplement of the \\"little magazine\\" Litoral, was a high-water mark of the initial phase in his poetic output.Essay by Andrew A. Anderson, University of Michigan, Dictionary of Literary Biography, Volume 108: Twentieth-Century Spanish Poets, First Series. A Bruccoli Clark Layman Book. Edited by Michael L. Perna, Hunter College, City University of New York. The Gale Group, 1991. pp. 134-161. The writers and intellectuals of Málaga congregated at the Café de Chinitas (Café of the Chinese, 1857–1937), the famous cabaret immortalised by Federico García Lorca, where the best flamenco singers performed in the 1920s. Málaga between the dictatorship and the republic (1930–1931) Málaga City Hall (Ayuntamiento) The economic boom ended as Spaniards became increasingly disenchanted with the dictatorship. Conservative critics blamed rising inflation on the government's spending for public works projects. Then 1929 brought a bad agricultural harvest and Spain's imports far outstripped the worth of its exports. The economic slump after the Wall Street crash decimated foreign trade and once again the old problems returned to Spain's internal politics and economy. Dissatisfaction spread throughout society, and when King Alfonso and the army, his main source of power, no longer backed him, Primo de Rivera resigned on 26 January 1930. He retired to Paris and died from fever and diabetes on 16 March. The political atmosphere in Málaga was contentious in the period between the fall of the dictatorship and the national elections in April 1931. For the republicans in Málaga it was a period of reorganisation, assimilation with other groups, and political activity in cooperation with the socialists. At the same time, the divergent agendas of Málaga's monarchist factions were an obstacle to finding a candidate to represent their interests. Meanwhile, the anarchist CNT and the Communist Party (PCE) organised social protests and strikes against the difficult conditions suffered by the working class. National bankruptcy and massive unpopularity had left the king no option but to demand Primo de Rivera's resignation. Disgusted with the king's involvement in his dictatorship, the urban population voted for the republican parties in the municipal elections of April 1931. The king fled the country without abdicating and a republic was established. Second Spanish Republic After the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic on 14 April, the year 1931 saw the burning of convents, churches and religious buildings by crowds rioting throughout Spain, an event known as la quema de conventos (the burning of the convents). When news of the events in Madrid on 11 May reached Málaga, uncontrolled mobs took to the streets that night and assaulted the Jesuits' residence and the Episcopal Palace. The mayhem lasted overnight and all the next day. Málaga was the Spanish city most affected by the quema—much of its religious, artistic, cultural and historical heritage was destroyed. It suffered not only the partial or complete destruction of many buildings, but also the loss of priceless historical records, religious images, ancient paintings, and libraries. Among the many works burnt were religious sculptures, including two masterpieces of Spanish baroque art by the sculptor Pedro de Mena as well as images carved by Fernando Ortiz. According to the historian Antonio Garcia Sanchez,La segunda republica en Malaga: La cuestion religiosa, 1931-1933 Excmo. Ayuntamiento de Cordoba, Delegacion de Cultura (1984) p152 the historical precedents of the burning of the convents may be found in the adoption of vehement anti-clerical positions by the workers' political parties prior to the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic. The Episcopal Palace In 1933, Málaga elected the first deputy of the Communist Party of Spain to become a member of Congress, Cayetano Bolivar. With its large number of active socialist, anarchist, and communist militants, Málaga became known as \\"Red Málaga\\", although Catholics, liberals and conservatives were still represented in local politics. Cedistas and the Popular Front (1934–1936) Spanish politics was polarized to the left and the right throughout the 1930s. The left-wing favoured class struggle, land reform, autonomy to the regions and reduction in church and monarchist power. The right-wing groups, the largest of which was the Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right (CEDA), a right wing Roman Catholic coalition, held opposing views on most issues. The first two governments of the Republic were center- left. Economic turmoil, substantial debt inherited from the Primo de Rivera regime, and fractious, rapidly changing governing coalitions led to serious political unrest. In 1933, CEDA won the national elections; an armed uprising of workers in October 1934 was forcefully put down by the new government. This in turn energised political movements across the spectrum in Spain, including a revived anarchist movement and new reactionary and fascist groups, including the Falange and a revived Carlist movement. The left united in the Popular Front and won the electoral vote in February 1936, reversing the right-wing trend. However, this coalition, dominated by the center-left, was undermined both by the revolutionary groups such as the anarchist Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) and Federación Anarquista Ibérica (FAI) and by anti- democratic far-right groups such as the Falange and the Carlists. The political violence of previous years started again. There were gunfights over strikes, landless laborers seized land, church officials were killed and churches burnt. On the other side, right wing militias such as the Falange and gunmen hired by employers assassinated left wing activists. The Republican democracy never developed the consensus or mutual trust between the various political groups that it needed to function peacefully. The right wing of the country and high-ranking figures in the army began to plan a coup,Antony Beevor, The Battle for Spain: The Spanish Civil War 1936–1939 (2006) and as a result the country slid into civil war. The Spanish Civil War began after a pronunciamiento (declaration of opposition) by the generals under the leadership of José Sanjurjo against the elected government of President Manuel Azaña. The rebel coup was supported by a number of conservative groups including CEDA, the religious monarchist Carlists, and the Fascist Falange. Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) Spanish Civil War, August–September 1936 On 17 July 1936, General Francisco Franco led the colonial army from Morocco to attack the mainland, while another force from the north under General Sanjurjo moved south from Navarre. Military units were also mobilised elsewhere to take over government institutions. Franco's move was intended to seize power immediately, but successful resistance by Republicans around the country meant that Spain faced a prolonged civil war. Soon much of the south and west was under the control of the Nationalists, whose regular Army of Africa was the most seasoned of all the forces. The Siege of the Alcázar at Toledo early in the war was a turning point, with the Nationalists winning after a long siege. The Republicans managed to hold out in Madrid, despite a Nationalist assault in November 1936. The Battle of Málaga was the culmination of an offensive in February 1937 by the combined Nationalist and Italian forces under the command of General Queipo de Llano to eliminate Republican control of the province of Málaga. The participation of Moroccan regulars and Italian tanks from the recently arrived Corpo Truppe Volontarie resulted in a complete rout of the Spanish Republican Army and the capitulation of Málaga in less than a week on 8 February. The occupation of Málaga led to an exodus of civilians and soldiers on the road to Almería, who were bombarded by Franco's air force, navy cruisers, tanks and artillery on 8 February, causing hundreds of deaths. This episode is known as the \\"Málaga-Almería road massacre\\". Almirante Cervera participated in the shelling of the Málaga littoral The Nationalists began to further erode the Republican territory, starving Madrid and making inroads into the east. The north, including the Basque country fell in late 1937 and the Aragon front collapsed shortly afterwards. The Battle of the Ebro in July–November 1938 was the final desperate attempt by the Republicans to turn the tide. When this failed and Barcelona fell to the Nationalists in early 1939, it was clear the war was over. The remaining Republican fronts collapsed and Madrid fell in March 1939.Paul Preston, The Spanish Civil War: Reaction, Revolution, and Revenge (2nd ed. 2007) pp 266-300 The war, which cost between 300,000 and 1,000,000 lives, ended with the destruction of the Republic and the accession of Francisco Franco as dictator of Spain. Franco amalgamated all the right wing parties into a reconstituted Falange and banned the left-wing and Republican parties and trade unions.Preston, The Spanish Civil War: Reaction, Revolution, and Revenge (2007) pp 301-318 The conduct of the war was brutal on both sides, with massacres of civilians and prisoners being widespread. After the war, many thousands of Republicans were imprisoned and up to 151,000 were executed between 1939 and 1943. Málaga during the dictatorship of Francisco Franco (1936–1975) During Franco's rule, Spain was officially neutral in World War II and remained largely economically and culturally isolated from the outside world. Under a right-wing military dictatorship, Spain saw its political parties banned, except for the official party, the Falange. The formation of labor unions and all dissident political activity was forbidden. Under Franco, Spain actively sought the return of Gibraltar by the UK, and gained some support for its cause at the United Nations. During the 1960s, Spain began imposing restrictions on Gibraltar, culminating in the closure of the border in 1969. It was not fully reopened until 1985. Spanish rule in Morocco ended in 1967. Though militarily victorious in the 1957–1958 Moroccan invasion of Spanish West Africa, Spain gradually relinquished its remaining African colonies. Spanish Guinea was granted independence as Equatorial Guinea in 1968, while the Moroccan enclave of Ifni was ceded to Morocco in 1969. The latter years of Franco's rule saw some economic and political liberalization, known as the Spanish Miracle, including the birth of a tourism industry. Spain began to catch up economically with its European neighbours.Stanley G. Payne, Franco and Hitler: Spain, Germany, and World War II (2009) Franco ruled until his death on 20 November 1975, when control was given to King Juan Carlos.Jean Grugel and Tim Rees, Franco's Spain (1997) In the last few months before Franco's death, the Spanish state went into a paralysis. This was capitalised upon by King Hassan II of Morocco, who ordered the 'Green March' into Western Sahara, Spain's last colonial possession.\\" Málaga's coast Málaga experienced an explosive demographic and economic expansion with the boom in tourism on the Costa del Sol between 1959 and 1974. The name \\"Costa del Sol\\" was created specifically to market the Mediterranean coastline of Málaga province to foreign vacationers. Historically the provincial population had lived in the fishing villages, and in the \\"white\\" villages (pueblos blancos) a short distance inland in the mountains running down to the coast. The area was developed to meet the demands of international tourism in the 1950s and has since been a popular destination for foreign tourists not only for its beaches but also for its local culture. There was significant migration from many towns around the province to the capital and a simultaneous migration of part of the population from Málaga to northern Spain and other European countries. The \\"Spanish miracle\\" fed itself on the rural exodus which created a new class of industrial workers. The economic boom led to an increase in rapid, largely unplanned building on the periphery of the cities of the Costa del Sol to accommodate the new workers arriving from the countryside. Some cities preserved their historic centers, but most were altered by often haphazard commercial and residential developments. The same fate befell long stretches of scenic coastline as mass tourism exploded. The University of Málaga (UMA, Universidad de Málaga) was founded by governmental decree on 18 August 1972, consolidating the existing centers of higher education: the Polytechnic University of Málaga (Escuela Universitaria Politécnica), the Normal School, the Faculty of Economics and the Seminary, which offered instruction in philosophy and theology. The Faculty of Medicine was created after ratification of the decree. Teatinos Campus, located in the Teatinos- Universidad district, is the largest UMA campus and is home to most of the university academic buildings including the Schools of Engineering, the Faculty of Medicine, the Faculty of Science, the College of Philosophy and Letters, the Faculty of Psychology and the Faculty of Law; the General Library is also located there. Currently the campus is expanding by more than 1000 m² to accommodate the faculties still in El Ejido. Torremolinos by air On 27 September 1988, the Andalucian Parliament (Junta de Andalucía) unilaterally approved the separation of the suburb of Torremolinos and its incorporation as its own municipality, depriving the city of Málaga of ten percent of its population. The decision, regarded as illegal by many Malagueños, dispensed with the requirement of an uninterrupted separation of at least ten kilometers from another village (although currently the limit is set to 7.5 kilometers). Nevertheless, it was hailed as setting an historic precedent: although it did not take into account popular opinion in the rest of Málaga, it did respond to the wishes of thousands of the residents of Torremolinos who, although mostly non-natives, demanded municipal autonomy. In any case, the city of Málaga, in addition to the loss of the aforementioned population (estimated at the time at about 50,000 people), lost six per cent of its tax revenue and five per cent of its expenses. The Andalucia Technology Park (PTA, Parque Tecnológico de Andalucía) opened in 1992. 21st century The Port of Málaga The Metro in Málaga began with proposals in the late '90s to create a light rail network to relieve the problem of traffic congestion in the city. In 2001, the Ministry of Public Works and Transport commissioned a study based on suggestions in the Intermodal Transport Plan, which had initially proposed four lines. The first two lines are still under construction as of 2012. Since 1998 the Port of Málaga has been undergoing renovation and expansion as part of the project called the Plan Especial del Puerto de Málaga. There are major projects underway or planned to radically change the image of the port and surrounding areas. The total traffic of goods imported or exported was 2,316,780 metric tonnes in 2015. View of Málaga from the port Cruise shipping has become an essential industry at the port and a major driver of investment in Málaga. In 2012 there were 651,517 passengers visiting the city onboard cruise ships calling at the port, including those who started or ended their cruise in Málaga. Meanwhile, the regular line of coast trade between Málaga and Melilla moved around 303,369 passengers, for a total of approximately 942,214 passengers traveling to, from or through the port.\\"Autoridad Portuaria de Málaga 2011\\" The development of the cruise industry is proceeding with a new passenger terminal, port museum and environmental education center planned for inclusion in the cruise ship facilities at Quay 2. A commercial marina will also operate from Quay 1, catering to 24 super-yachts of up to 30 meters, and the Eastern Quay passenger terminal will be remodeled to improve pedestrian access and double existing capacity to 560,000 passengers a year. The quays are connected by a system of internal roads and a network of internal and external railway lines. The internal rail network links the Harbor Services Area with the Málaga main rail station. AVE (Alta Velocidad Española, AVE), a high-speed rail service operated by Renfe, the Spanish national railway company, inaugurated the Córdoba-Málaga high-speed rail line, a standard gauge railway line in length, on 24 December 2007. Designed for speeds of and compatibility with neighbouring countries' rail systems, it connects Málaga and Córdoba. The line runs through precipitous terrain in the Sierra Nevada and several viaducts and tunnels were necessary to complete the connections. Málaga Airport (Aeropuerto de Málaga), the fourth busiest airport in Spain, is important for Spanish tourism as it is the main international airport serving the Costa Del Sol. It is the international airport of Andalucia accounting for 85 percent of its international traffic and is the only one offering a wide variety of international destinations. Málaga Airport is one of the oldest Spanish airports that has stayed in its original location. The ambitious Málaga Plan has been established to meet the increase in the number of passengers, owing primarily to the growth in tourism on the Costa del Sol. It includes the construction of a new terminal and a new car park, as well as the extension of the airfield. Trade Fairs and Congress Center A civic convention hall, the Trade Fairs and Congress Center (), opened in 2003. The Club Málaga Valley e-27 is an initiative by a group composed of politicians and business leaders in the telecommunications and information sectors who want to design strategies and implement policies to move Málaga forward in information technology. The Picasso Museum (Museo Picasso Málaga), opened in 2003 in the Buenavista Palace, has 285 works donated by members of Picasso's family. The Collection: History , Museo Picasso Málaga. Accessed online 2012-06-09. The Museo Thyssen Carmen, housing a collection of 19th- and 20th-century Spanish paintings in the Palacio de Villalón and surrounding buildings, opened in 2011. The Contemporary Art Center of Málaga (CAC) was created by the city council to disseminate and encourage appreciation of modern art. The Center is located in the heart of the city, in the former Wholesalers' Market, designed in 1939 by the architect Luis Gutiérrez Soto, one of the preeminent exponents of rationalism in Spanish architecture. The Málaga Film Festival (Festival de Málaga Cine Español) is the most prestigious festival dedicated exclusively to cinema made in Spain. It is held annually during a week in April.

Skiing career Finneran was born in the Sydney suburb of Maroubra. He lost the full use of both his legs and his right arm after contracting polio aged about 20 months. He took up skiing in 1972 after a visit to the Thredbo Ski Resort and trained in the United States and Canada. He was Australia's only participant at the 1976 Winter Paralympics in Örnsköldsvik, Sweden, where he marched in the opening ceremony. However, he did not compete, as there were no events for his disability. He remained in Sweden after the Games until 1978 to study and train. At the 1984 World Championships in Switzerland he came 4th in the downhill.

He retired as Executive Director of DWA in January 2010 after 31 years in the role. Whilst in the role of Executive Director, he was able transform disabled skiing in Australia particularly in terms of facilities, training programs, talent development and government support. In 1992, Australian Disabled Skiing Federation opened its own ski lodge called Finsko's Lodge, the name of the lodge recognized Finneran's considerable work to its development. He also played a major role in the establishment of the Jindabyne Winter Academy, a program designed to assist elite and talented able bodied and disabled alpine skiers. The result of Finneran's worked culminated in 2001 with the Australian Institute of Sport establishing a Paralympic Alpine Skiing Program in conjunction with the Australian Paralympic Committee. In 1989, he was a member of a working group that helped to establish the Australian Paralympic Federation in January 1990. He was a Board Member of the Federation from 1990 to 1995.

Biography Giovanni Michiel was born in Venice sometime between April 1446 and April 1447, the son of Lorenzo Michiel and Nicolosa Barbo, sister of the future Pope Paul II. A cousin, Giovanni Battista Zeno, was also a cardinal (1468). Early in his career, Michiel served as a protonotary apostolic. During this time, he lived with his uncle in the Apostolic Palace. His uncle made him a cardinal deacon in the consistory of November 21, 1468. He received the red hat and the deaconry of Santa Lucia in Septisolio on November 22, 1468. He opted for the deaconry of Sant'Angelo in Pescheria ca. 1470. He was named Bishop of Verona in commendam on March 18, 1471; his entry into the see was delayed by the conflict between the Republic of Venice and the Holy See, but then occupied the office until his death. He participated in the papal conclave of 1471 that elected Pope Sixtus IV. He left Rome with the pope on June 10, 1476 because of an outbreak of bubonic plague, traveling to Viterbo and Foligno; they returned to Rome on October 23. He opted to become a cardinal priest ca. 1484, taking the titular church of San Marcello al Corso, though retaining Sant'Angelo in Pescheria in commendam. He participated in the papal conclave of 1484 that elected Pope Innocent VIII. On September 15, 1484, he succeeded the incoming pope as Camerlengo of the Sacred College of Cardinals, and was elected to the post on January 9, 1485 until January 11, 1486. The pope named him Bishop of Padua, but the Republic of Venice opposed this appointment and sequestered his revenues, with the result that Michiel resigned the see in March 1487. On June 4, 1486, he was named legate a latare to the Patrimonium Sancti Petri and to the fortresses and castles of the Holy See. He was named Inspector of the papal army raised against Ferdinand I of Naples and later led the negotiations that led to a peace treaty signed on August 11, 1487. On March 14, 1491, he opted to become a cardinal bishop, taking the suburbicarian see of Albano. On October 10, 1491, he opted for the suburbicarian see of Palestrina. He participated in the papal conclave of 1492 that elected Pope Alexander VI. On August 31, 1492, the pope named him suburbicarian bishop of Porto e Santa Rufina. When, as part of the Italian War of 1494–1498, French troops entered Rome on May 27, 1495, he and the pope left Rome for Orvieto. He was named (titular) Latin Patriarch of Antioch on January 23, 1497. He died in Rome on April 10, 1503, two days after he was poisoned by his cook on the orders of Cesare Borgia.

The screenplay is based on the 2011 Icelandic film Either Way (Á annan veg). The film was shot in Bastrop, Texas, after the Bastrop County Complex Fire. Plot In 1988, an odd pair of sorts, meditative and stern Alvin (Paul Rudd) and his girlfriend's brother, Lance (Emile Hirsch), dopey and insecure, leave the city behind to spend the summer in solitude repainting traffic lines down the center of a country highway ravaged by wildfire. As they sink into their job in the remarkable landscape, they learn more than they want to about each other and their own limitations. They regularly encounter a drunk truck driver. As Lance leaves for a weekend in the city, Alvin enjoys his solitude and explores the woods by himself. He comes across a house that has been burned to the ground by the wildfire, and encounters a woman who explains that it is her house, and she is searching in the rubble for her pilot's licence. Lance returns distraught and with a black eye, claiming to have been beat up by the boyfriend of a woman he had been involved with. Later, however, he reveals that the real reason behind his distress is that a middle-aged woman he has been seeing is pregnant with his child, and he laments and ponders his fears of fatherhood and responsibility. Lance later finds that his sister Madison, Alvin's girlfriend, has sent Alvin a Dear John letter and the couple are heard arguing on the phone about Alvin's absence and Madison's new lover. A distraught Alvin is comforted by Lance after the break-up. Alvin also encourages Lance to embrace parenthood and ensures him he will be a great father, and the two form an unlikely friendship. Alvin nicknames their duo \\"Alvinlance.\\" In a final scene, they greet the truck driver, and Alvin notices the woman he had encountered earlier entering his truck, but the truck driver does not see her. Cast * Paul Rudd as Alvin * Emile Hirsch as Lance * Lance LeGault as Truck Driver * Joyce Payne as Lady Production The idea of making Prince Avalanche came when the band Explosions in the Sky proposed the idea of making a movie with director David Gordon Green at Bastrop State Park, which was being restored following the 2011 Bastrop County Complex fire. Adapted from Hafsteinn Gunnar Sigurðsson's 2011 film Either Way, the script for Prince Avalanche consisted of roughly 65 pages – about 30 pages short of an average feature-length screenplay. From development onward, the film was fast tracked to completion. \\"We really didn’t have time for proper or traditional development,\\" said Gordon Green. \\"We had the idea in February of 2012, we were filming in May, and sound mixing in July. It was an unusually tight production schedule.\\" Paul Rudd joked to an Entertainment Weekly interviewer, \\"I found the biggest challenge of working on this was trying to stifle my alpha-male [masculinity].\\" The film's entire production was done in secret; it was only announced to the public after completion in June 2012. This was at the request of the director, David Gordon Green, who wanted to get back to his independent roots after his last three films were completed by a major film studio. Principal photography for Prince Avalanche began in May 2012 and lasted for 16 days in Bastrop State Park. Because of its scale, the film was shot with a small 15-person film crew. While already mid-shoot, the film crew came across Joyce Payne, a resident of the area whose home was destroyed in the fire. Fascinated by her story, Gordon Green included her in the film. \\"It wasn’t scripted at all; it was something very real for her that we documented,\\" said Gordon Green. \\"It ended up being pivotal. I couldn’t imagine the movie without it now.\\" Release Prince Avalanche premiered at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival on 20 January. Then it had its international premiere in competition at the 63rd Berlin International Film Festival on 13 February 2013 where David Gordon Green won the Silver Bear for Best Director. It subsequently screened within such U.S. festivals as South by Southwest and Maryland Film Festival. Reception Prince Avalanche received positive reviews and has an approval rating of 82% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 122 reviews with an average score of 6.91 out of 10. The consensus states: \\"A step back in the right direction for director David Gordon Green, Prince Avalanche shambles amiably along with a pair of artfully low-key performances from Paul Rudd and Emile Hirsch.\\" Metacritic gives the film a score of 73 out of 100, based on 29 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".

The firm office is located in the Brisbane central business district, Queensland. The firm has around 220 team members including 22 partners.  History  ;1980 On 22 December 1980 three young lawyers founded Cooper, Grace and Ward Solicitors. With specialisations in Property Law, Commercial Law and Litigation, Peter Cooper, David Grace and Chris Ward began the Brisbane-based practice. The firm was located in the (then) MLC building in the Brisbane CBD. ;1981 - 1990 During the eighties, the firm saw steady growth. This was occurring as Brisbane itself saw a large degree of change and growth. The river city was re-inventing itself as World Expo 88 heralded a new era in the city and attitudes within and towards it. ;1990 In 1990, the firm moved to the top-tier riverside location, Central Plaza 2. At this time, Australia's economy hit hard times with the recession of the early 90s. Chris Ward remembers the time as \\"really tough\\" but admits it provided an opportunity for the firm to learn a lot of valuable lessons about our structure and direction as a business. ;1991 - 1995 In 1993, Cooper Grace and Ward become affiliated, but not financially integrated, with the national Hunt & Hunt Legal Group. ;1996 - 2000 In 1996, Hunt & Hunt Brisbane merged with another commercial firm, Thompson King Connolly. By the year 2000, Brisbane was fast growing as an alternative for business from Sydney and Melbourne as major international companies such as Virgin Australia, Boeing Australia, Mincom Limited and Billabong (clothing) set up their head offices in Queensland. The growth in Brisbane over these years as a thriving business district meant that Queensland rapidly became Australia's fastest growing economy. ;2001 - 2006 The firm decided to move forward from March 2006 as an independent Queensland- based firm that serviced local, national and international clients, under the name of Cooper Grace Ward Lawyers. ;2009–present In October 2009, Cooper Grace Ward expanded into a five green-star designed building at 400 George Street, Brisbane. The move was driven by the need for more space to accommodate the continuing growth of the firm. Within three weeks of the relocation to 400 George Street, Cooper Grace Ward made an announcement of a substantial merger with Bain Gasteen Lawyers, effective from 1 December 2009. The merger took the firm's total numbers to 200+ people. The merged firm was initially known as Cooper Grace Ward (incorporating Bain Gasteen) and from February 2010 became Cooper Grace Ward.  Notable Achievements  In 2014, Cooper Grace Ward acted for former Queensland Government minister Dr Bruce Flegg in his defamation suit against his former media adviser, Graeme Hallett. Justice Peter Lyons upheld the defamation claim and awarded Dr Flegg damages of $775,000. This award is believed to be the largest award for a defamation case in Queensland history.

It is derived from a Malayalam word literally meaning 'sea-thief'. Kallakkadal event is considered as one of the major societal problems along the Indian coasts and these are caused by high swell waves, without any sign in the local winds, sometimes cause severe flooding. A recent research focused on the causes of Kallakkadal/swell surge has established the link between North Indian Ocean high swell events and the meteorological conditions in the Southern Ocean using a combination of ocean wave observations and numerical model simulations. The study confirms that Kallakkadal events are caused by swells propagating from the Southern Indian Ocean of 30°S, from the region between Africa and Australia. Swell waves are generated by distant weather systems, where wind blows for a duration of time over a large fetch. The long period swell waves (>18 s) seen during Kallakkadal/Swell surge events are generated in the southern Indian Ocean by severe low pressure system existed 3–5 days prior to the Kallakkadal events. The quasi-stationary nature of the southern ocean low pressure systems provides strong (~25 ms-1) and long duration (~3 days) surface winds over a large fetch; essential conditions for the generation of long period swells. The intense winds associated with these severe low pressure systems in the Southern Indian Ocean trigger the generation of high waves which propagate to Indian Coastal regions as swells. Furthermore, these swells affect coastal areas which are dependent on the local topography, angle of incidence and tidal conditions, cause high wave activity and Kallakkadal along the Indian coastal regions. The study shows that Kallakkadal events along NIO coasts can be effectively monitored and forecasted at least 2 days in advance if the meteorological conditions of the Southern Ocean are properly monitored. INCOIS has been now successfully giving advanced warning to the coastal community about the Kallakkadal events. Characteristics of kallakadal Characteristics of “Kallakkadal” as follows: *This phenomenon occurs mostly during pre-monsoon season and sometimes during post monsoon. *It continues for a few days. *It inundates the low lying coasts. *During high tide the run-up, water level can reach as much as 3–4 m above Maximum Water Level (MWL).

Background  Current field devices for process and factory automation have a number of configuration options, to customize them to their individual use case. For these means they are equipped with a digital communication interface (HART, PROFIBUS, Fieldbus Foundation). Different software tools provide the means to control and configure the devices. In the 1990s, the DDL was developed to remove the requirement to write a new software tool for each new device type. Software can, through the interpretation of a device description (DD), configure and control many different devices. The creation of a description with the DDL is less effort than writing an entire software tool. The HART Communication Foundation, PROFIBUS and Fieldbus Foundation have merged their individual dialects of the DDL. The result became the Electronic Device Description Language (EDDL), an IEC standard (IEC 61804). The harmonization and enhancement of the EDDL is being undertaken in the EDDL Cooperation Team (ECT). The ECT consists of the leadership of the Fieldbus Foundation, Profibus Nutzerorganisation (PNO), Hart Communication Foundation, OPC Foundation and the FDT Group.

It is also known as the National Broadcasting Service Radio Transmission Centre. It is listed on the Brisbane Heritage Register. The centre transmits all the Brisbane AM radio programmes of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) .  History = Prior to the 1940s: 4QG and 4QR  Initially, radio transmission was totally from within the Brisbane city centre. The first transmitter for radio station 4QG was located in an inner courtyard in the Executive Building in the Brisbane city centre. Operated by the Queensland Government, it started transmitting in 1925. A more powerful transmitter replaced it in 1926, on the eighth floor of the then new State Government Insurance Building (from 1933 known as the Taxation building) at the corner of George and Elizabeth Streets. The involvement of the Australian Broadcasting Commission (now the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, ABC) started in 1930, with the Postmaster General's Department (PMG) being responsible for technical operation. Major modifications were made to the transmitter during the ABC's use of the transmitter. In 1935, a survey team from the Postmaster General (PMG) Research Laboratories in Melbourne selected the Bald Hills site, then a farm, as a future location for a possibly high-powered transmitter for 4QG, but no land acquisition occurred at that time. At that stage radio station 4QG had been in existence for ten years (since 27 July 1925), and the National Broadcasting Service (NBS, later the ABC) for five years (since 31 January 1930). Radio station 4QR was officially opened in 1938, with transmission from the roof of the Central Automatic Exchange Building in Elizabeth Street.  The move to Bald Hills  At the start of World War II, Brisbane's skyline was dominated by five high aerial towers, of which two served 4QG and one 4QR. A further two towers served commercial stations. Land acquisitions for the current Bald Hills site commenced in 1940. The first aerial was erected on the site in 1941; it was constructed from and bore casing and was high. The transmitter building was made of brick with a fibro roof. It was built by Thomas Frederick of Days Road, Wilston, under a contract awarded in July 1941, and work had started by October 1941. The farm buildings were removed at about this time. In March 1942 General Douglas MacArthur arrived in Australia to be appointed supreme commander of the Allied Forces in the South-West Pacific. The AMP Building in Queen Street, Brisbane, (now the MacArthur Chambers) was chosen for MacArthur's headquarters because of its central location and reinforced concrete roof. It was feared that the presence of all these high aerial towers would act as a navigational aid for Japanese aircraft seeking to attack MacArthur's headquarters. This accelerated the need to shift the transmitters out of the city centre. Erection of the Bald Hills radio transmitter, 1942 The first transmission from the Bald Hills site was of 4QR, on 24 March 1942, using the transmitter moved the previous night from the Central Telephone Exchange in the city. In April 1942, the 4QG transmitter was also relocated to Bald Hills but not to this site but to another Bald Hills site leased from the commercial station 4BH. Known as Fischle's Jam Factory, the 4BH site was at Roghan Road near Neville Road, next to Fischle's. Bald Hills residents of the time were not impressed by this transfer of risk of Japanese attack to their area. As the Queensland segment of the National Broadcasting Service (NBS) was restricted to Brisbane, Rockhampton and Townsville, it was proposed to use high frequency (short wave) transmission to give some cover to the rest of Queensland. VLQ first went to air on 17 February 1943, transmitted by STCA880A. Land acquisitions for the present site continued through to July 1943 when the Australian Government resumed the 114 acre (46ha) property from J W Guy. The transmitter building was extended in 1945-46. After World War II had ended, the existing vertical radiator was erected in 1947. The building was further extended 1962 and has been internally modified at least twice when equipment was upgraded, once in 1968 and again in about 1994. In two later stages, (c 1970, 1980) there were minor reductions in the land holding of the site, for road widening and subdivisional redevelopment. The current area of the site is 43ha. *  Description  The National Broadcasting Service Radio Transmission Centre is an approximately site at 99 Kluver Street on the corner of Bracken Ridge Road, Bald Hills, facing west into Kluver Street and bounded by Taragon Street in the south and Hoyland Street in the east. The VLQ STCA880A transmitter is a very early model high powered (10 kW) high frequency transmitter. It is built from very old technology, its design and construction pre-dating both the transistor and the silicon chip. Relying on extremely large glass and metal radio valves, the final amplifier valves requiring a water cooling system, the transmitter in operation presented a truly awesome appearance when in operation, supplemented by a sound effect as the cooling system pump and fan operated. In a paper presented to the Institution of Engineers, Australia shortly before his death, Sanderson wrote: > \\"These early units with prolific meters and open mesh panels, behind which > the large glass transmitting valves glowed cherry red, contrasting with the > strange blue pulsating plasmas of the mercury vapour rectifiers, had a > personality and character which is totally lacking in the sterile steel > boxes, the state of the art highly complex, almost non repairable > transmitters of the 90s.\\" Particular qualities of the STCA880A are its robustness and its reliability, evidenced by the decades of high quality service it gave before it was finally retired, mainly because the valves vital for its operation finally went out of production. It was in either full-time or reserve service for forty five years, from 1943 until 1988. The Bald Hills unit was the third of its type, preceded by one at Laverton and another at Ballarat, both for the RAAF. It was the first NBS short wave transmitter in Queensland and the second in Australia. Its NBS predecessor, code named VLR, was operated from Victoria. It was not of the same type. To cool the anodes of the power output valves, duplicate pumps powered by 3-4 hp 2,900 RPM three-phase electric motors were installed in an adjoining room. A fan cooled external reaiator was installed on a patio adjacent to the pump room. As the anodes operate at 12,000 volts, low conductivity cooling water was essential, and a still was installed to ensure a continual supply. The existing vertical radiator is a triangular section lattice steel structure, 204m high and with 8 ft (2.44m) sides, guyed at four levels in three directions. The earth system consists of 120 copper wire buried radials, each 200m long. The mast is energised by separate six wire lines, each 460m long. The building lies on the western (high) side of the site. It was first used to accommodate the 4QR transmitter, which was shifted overnight on 23–24 March 1942. Other buildings include: * the foreman mechanic's residence, 1944 * the emergency engine house, 1950 * the coupling hut, 1962 * the transmitters Other transmitters at the site include: * Stand by (10 kW) 4SU-11A (1948 * Stand by (2 kW) 4SU-16C (1951; ex 4QN Clevedon, 1960) * 4QG main (10 kW) 4SU-64 (1963) *4QR main (50 kW) 4SU-38 (1963)  Condition  The transmission equipment is completely preserved and housed in its original 1943 location.  Significance  The VLQ transmitter STCA880A (1943) constructed for the National Broadcasting Service was the first high frequency transmitter in Queensland and the second in Australia. It is the last of its type in the world and is a relic of a period when high frequency (short wave) transmissions were the most favoured means of broadcasting to country areas. It was used extensively on broadcasts to Papua New Guinea. It was at the vanguard of the era of shortwave transmission which started when it and the Bald Hills centre were both new. It illustrates an important phase of the very rapid development of the National Broadcasting Service's Queensland operations. This phase began at a relatively early stage in the history of the radio broadcasting in Australia. It enabled access for the first time to radio services for communities in inland and remote centres, thereby reducing their isolation. The transmitter is of totally Australian design and has a very high content of Australian manufacture, only meters and valves being imported. Its operation was water cooled, a technological practice of the time and was in either full-time or reserve service for forty five years, from 1943 until 1988. It is completely preserved, housed in its original 1943 location. The transmitter is a very significant historical relic, as it is probably the only surviving specimen of this very interesting short wave transmitter type. The design by STC dates from the late 1930s. It has been recommended that the equipment should be retained as a broadcasting heritage exhibit. The other transmitters on the site form, with STCA880A, Australia's largest collection under one roof of retired and operating radio transmitters. Dating from 1948 or possibly earlier, they are, except for one recovered from 4QN Clevedon in 1960, in their original locations. The significance of the site lies essentially in its connexion with the transmitters. The aerial, erected in 1947, has become a very well known local landmark. Their significance attaches to the transmitting equipment housed in the main building, a unit purpose built in 1941-42 and modified or extended on at least four occasions since.  Legacy  Two series of photographs were taken of the erection of the first aerial in 1941 and of its spectacular demolition in 1987. These, with annotations by the late Douglas Sanderson, were presented by the Institution of Engineers Australia, to the John Oxley Library in 1994.

The song was written by Kesha in collaboration with David Gamson, Pebe Sebert, Oliver Leiber. It was produced by Gamson with additional production done by Leiber. The song's instrumentation was by Gamson, with the exception of the accordion, which was played by Kesha. Kesha wrote the song about a boy that she had been stalking and who had refused to call the singer. Musically, \\"Stephen\\" is a dance-pop song that incorporates elements of country music. The song received some positive reviews from music critics upon its release. After the release of Animal for download, Stephen charted on the lower regions of the South Korea Gaon International Chart. A music video for the song was released on the repackaging of the singer's debut album, Animal + Cannibal. Writing and inspiration Stephen was written by Kesha Sebert, in collaboration with her mother Pebe Sebert, David Gamson, and Oliver Leiber. The song was produced by Gamson with additional production by Leiber. Gamson played all the instruments on the song, with the exception of the accordion which was performed by Kesha. The song's recording was commenced at ACME Recording, Long Island, California, and at Ollywood Studios, Hollywood, California, by Gamson. Kesha told Rolling Stone that Stephen was one of her favorite tracks on the album. She explained that the song stemmed from her experiences with a man that she had been \\"stalking since [she] was 15.\\" It was written when the singer was sixteen, in collaboration with her mother. She found David Gamson to produce the song. \\"He does all the keyboard stuff, he's amazing, a crazy cynical genius guy, and he liked my voice and my thing, and I really liked his thing, so we decided to work together\\" she explained. Kesha was inspired to write the song after continual rejection from the protagonist in the song, Stephen, who refused to call the singer. She told MTV \\"I wrote [it] about this guy that I've been stalking since I was, like, 15, but he's a total loser, so I don't want to glorify him in any way, but I'm really excited for the song.\\" In February 2010, after the release of the song, Stephen attended one of the singer's concerts. Speaking to Total Access on 96.4FM The Wave, the singer recalled the experience saying \\"he came to see my show at this huge gay bar in New York and it was totally off the chain. He gets up on stage, takes all his clothes off except his underwear and starts making out with a tranny. I was like, 'Wait a minute, have I been barking up the wrong genre of tree?'\\" Composition \\"Stephen\\" is a song composed in the dance-pop genre that also incorporates elements of country music. According to digital sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony-ATV Music Publishing, the song is written in the key of D major and the tempo moves at 100 beats per minute at a moderately fast rate. Kesha's vocal range in the song spans from the lower note of E3 to the higher note of D5. The lyrics begin with Kesha singing \\"Stephen, Stephen, why won't you call me?.\\" The song's lyrics depict the tale of the singer stalking her then crush, Stephen, who ultimately would not call the singer. \\"Stephen\\" opens with layered a cappella and vocoder harmonies, later transitioning into a dominantly driven pop song. According to the singer, \\"Stephen\\" showcases her more vulnerable side and encompasses humor throughout its lyrics: \\"'Stephen' shows the vulnerable side of me but it's still a funny pop song. It's me saying I'm totally obsessive and in love with this guy, but he's blowing me off in a pretty funny way.\\" Fraser McAlpine of BBC called the song \\"a vulnerable ode to an unreliable crush.\\" Daniel Brockman of The Phoenix thought that the song's lyrics were \\"an ode to forcing your sexual advances on your high-school history teacher.\\" According to Andrew Burgess of musicOMH, the song \\"tells the story of that one guy Ke$ha can't bag: 'What the hell? I can charm the pants off anyone else, but you.'\\" Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times felt that the song was experimental, comparing it to the group Animal Collective. Critical reception \\"Stephen\\" received positive comments from music critics. Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music used \\"Stephen\\" as an example of the songs on Animal that exemplified the singer's vocals, saying it had \\"beautiful layered a cappella harmonies. Sure, it tumbles into clunky pop straight afterwards, but then, that also seems to be what she does: beautiful things are bashed against ugly things, pretty melodies ruined by silly noises, emotional lyrics stuffed with buzzwords.\\" Daniel Brockman of The Boston Phoenix wrote of the album that \\"in a post–'Birthday Sex' pop landscape, there's plenty of room for dumb if it's done well.\\" He described \\"Stephen\\" as \\"an ode to forcing your sexual advances on your high-school history teacher.\\" Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times listed the song as one of those that exemplified the album's more experimental side, calling it a \\"country-in- space\\" rendition. musicOMH's writer Andrew Burgess wrote that \\"Stephen\\" is one of the album's \\"obligatory ballads\\", saying it is \\"fine\\". His consensus regarding the album's ballads was that \\"Perhaps Ke$ha is, in fact, a more complex and multi-faceted party girl than she seems like on the surface.\\" Digital Spy commented that the Kesha uses the album \\"to show her vulnerable side\\" and that \\"she admits she can't take rejection on the country-tinged 'Stephen'.\\" Music video dummy boyfriend. A music video for \\"Stephen\\" was directed by the production team Skinny. The video was released on the deluxe repacking of her debut album Animal, under its re-release entitled Animal + Cannibal. It was later uploaded to the singer's Vevo account on April 4, 2011. The video is composed of still shots that show the singer \\"going to some extreme lengths to show 'Stephen' how much she's feeling him.\\" The video opens with the singer looking through a scrapbook; following this the video then proceeds into depicting the singer's interactions with the protagonist. The video's first setting is located at a bar where the singer gets into a verbal altercation with the man's girlfriend. Kesha, who later leaves with the then unconscious man, takes him back to her house to takes pictures of him and later cuts off some of his hair for her shrine. The singer then duct-tapes the man and locks him in her closet; which he later escapes from. Following this, the singer is distraught and then builds another man out of a dummy, and using the hair she had clipped earlier, proceeds to bring the dummy to a bar, getting into another altercation with it and later leaving it in the street – ending the video.

Based in the Global South, they are a membership- driven organization that \\"works within the rights, justice and feminist frameworks.\\" WGNRR works towards the realization of the full sexual and reproductive health and rights. WGNRR has consultative status with ECOSOC.  History  WGNRR was founded at the fourth International Women and Health Meeting in 1984. The conference was themed \\"No to Population Control... Women Decide!\\" and saw the formation of other important international networks including Women Living Under Muslim Laws (WLUML) and Latin American Women and Health Network. In 1987, at another IWHM conference, WGNRR partnered with the Latin America and Caribbean Women's Health Network to launch a campaign addressing maternal mortality and declared May 28 the International Day of Action for Women's Health. WGNRR was an active participant in the International Conference “Reinforcing Reproductive Rights”, held in Madras, India in 1993. It was this year that WGNRR began campaigning for safe and legal abortion. WGNRR's position on abortion was critical during the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in 1994. According to their website, \\"WGNRR was part of a coalition – the Women’s Alliance – to ensure that women’s voices were heard and represented at the conference. that protested the population control theories that abounded at the time. WGNRR was also involved in workshops protesting the use of anti- fertility “vaccines”. WGNRR's support of the ICPD's inclusion of right to access of safe abortion was still tempered by its concern over the language and the fear of the misuse of such a document by proponents of coerced population control.\\" In 1995, WGNRR undertook campaigns to address the feminisation of poverty and was an active participant in the development of the Programme of Action for the Women’s World Conference in Beijing. Following the Cairo Consensus, WGNRR held a 1996 Regional Members' Meeting in Amsterdam. Between 2003 to 2007, WGNRR collaborated with the People’s Health Movement on the Women’s Access to Health campaign. WGNRR then relocated its main office to the Global South and by 2009, the main office was transferred from the Netherlands to the Philippines.  Key areas  * Access to safe and legal abortion * Access to contraceptives * abortion rights advocacy * Youth sexual and reproductive health rights * Women's sexual and reproductive health rights * Sexual rights for all people  Campaigns  WGNRR has facilitated several international campaigns on a wide range of issues including maternal mortality and morbidity, poverty, forced sterilization and the sexual and reproductive rights of youth. Since its inception, WGNRR has used \\"Calls for Action\\" to mobilize members. WGNRR's two primary campaigns are the International Day of Action for Women's Health (May 28) and the International Day of Action for Access to Safe and Legal Abortion (September 28).  Global Day of Action for Access to Safe and Legal Abortion  September 28 was chosen as the date for the Latin American and Caribbean Campaign for the Decriminalization of Abortion in 1990. In 2015, the name of the day was changed to International Safe Abortion Day in an attempt to have a simpler, easier to remember name and to advocate for the day to become an official UN day.http://www.safeabortionwomensright.org/international-safe-abortion-day/  Funders  WGNRR works in partnership with and has received recent funding from Oxfam Novib and The Safe Abortion Action Fund (SAAF).

The possibility of a unionist 'unity' candidate to maximise the chance of defeating Sinn Féin was raised early on. There were discussions between the DUP and the UUP on standing a unity candidate. The UUP were described as being \\"coy\\" on whether or not they would stand or support another unionist candidate. The DUP chair of Magherafelt District Council and TUV leader Jim Allister MLA called for a unity candidateUnique opportunity for unionism to consolidate - McLean Tyrone Times and TUV said they would probably not stand a candidate. The UUP leader Mike Nesbitt said in late January that the party would be willing to support a \\"community candidate\\", but that the UUP would stand a candidate if the DUP stood a candidate. However, a meeting of the UUP constituency association was reported to be divided on the issue of whether to support a unity candidate. This came against a backdrop of greater unionist unity in Northern Irish politics more generally, including the setting up of the Unionist Forum and warmer relationships between the DUP and UUP, and the flag protests. On behalf of the UK Independence Party, David McNarry MLA also supported the idea of a unionist unity candidate in a press release.http://www.davidmcnarry.com/31.1.13/29(02)Press%20release%20UKIP.docx The idea of a unionist unity candidate was criticised as \\"living in the past\\" by Molloy, the Sinn Féin candidate.Advocates of unionist unity candidate ‘stuck in the past’ Tyrone Times Alliance candidate Eric Bullick also criticised the decision. On 14 February, the UUP and DUP constituency associations both agreed to support victims' campaigner and local undertaker Nigel Lutton as a single unionist candidate. TUV are also supported Lutton's candidacy, with Walter Millar, the party's constituency chairman and their candidate at the general election, signing Lutton's nomination papers. However, two UUP Members of the Northern Ireland Legislative Assembly, former deputy leader John McCallister and Basil McCrea, resigned from the party in protest at the decision and closer co-operation with the DUP. After the by- election, in June 2013, they announced the formation of NI21, a new unionist party. Lutton declined to tell reporters which party he usually votes for. He previously worked as a personal assistant for DUP MP David Simpson, to whom he is related, and had before that been a member of the Young Unionists, the youth wing of the UUP. His election agent was UUP General Secretary Colin McCusker, a long-time personal friend. Both DUP and UUP politicians were involved in his campaign. Willie Frazer, a victims' campaigner, independent unionist and spokesman for the then newly constituted protest alliance the Ulster People's Forum, initially announced his intention to stand. Frazer told a 'webchat' for the Belfast Newsletter that the Ulster People's Forum \\"is not a political party\\", and that in usual circumstances he would consider voting for the Traditionalist Unionist Voice.Video: Willie Frazer in live webchat The Belfast Telegraph At the end of January 2013, Frazer then said he would consider not standing in favour of Jamie Bryson, a leading figure in the Belfast City Hall flag protests who is the interim chair of the Ulster People's Forum. After Lutton's selection, Frazer initially announced that he would not be running and fully supported him. However, he later said he would still consider standing if Lutton was too close to the DUP. He did not, in the end, submit his candidacy. After the by-election, in April 2013, he co-founded the Protestant Coalition, a new political party. Allegations about the killing of Frederick Lutton Nigel Lutton's father, Frederick, was a former RUC reservist killed by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) in 1979. In 2007, under Parliamentary privilege, DUP MP David Simpson (a cousin of Frederick Lutton) alleged that Francie Molloy, then a PIRA volunteer/member, was suspected by the police of being involved in Lutton's death. Simpson also claimed Molloy had become an informer for the British security forces after being caught in \\"a compromising position\\" and that he was \\"well known – and this information is from the police – for a series of sexual indiscretions\\". Molloy, the claims continued, allowed the police to \\"break open\\" the IRA's East Tyrone Brigade. These allegations were denied by Molloy,\\"Sinn Féin selects its Mid Ulster candidate\\", The Irish News, 13 December 2012. who has challenged unionists to repeat them outside Parliament, which would allow him to take legal action. UUP leader Mike Nesbitt has said he was unaware of the allegations against Molloy when he agreed on the choice of Nigel Lutton as candidate. Nigel Lutton stated that his decision to stand was not because of Molloy's candidacy. Nigel Lutton's uncle Joey was named as a member of the Glenanne gang in The Cassel Report, having been convicted for his part in a number of Ulster Volunteer Force killings.\\"Mid-Ulster by-election candidate profiles\\", BBC.

It was the first of Gissing's published novels, although he had been working on another prior to this. The work focuses on the unhappy marriage of Arthur Golding, a rising artist from a poor background, and Carrie Mitchell, a prostitute. This plot was partly based on Gissing's negative experiences of marriage to his first wife. It also was designed to serve the function of political polemic, highlighting social issues that Gissing felt strongly about. Reviews of the novel generally recognised some potential in the author, but were critical of Workers in the Dawn. After reading the first known published review in the Athenaeum, Gissing was driven to describe critics as \\"unprincipled vagabonds\\". Plot Arthur Golding grows up in poverty in London, and is orphaned at the age of eight. With the help of others, he succeeds in leaving this life behind, gains an education and embarks on a career as an artist. He also meets and marries Helen Norman. Arthur later meets a prostitute named Carrie Mitchell and marries her. This second marriage is an unhappy one, with Carrie and Arthur eventually separating due to her drunkenness and unsavoury associations. After inheriting some money from Helen Norman's father, Arthur attempts to renew his marriage to Helen, although this does not last long when Helen finds out about Arthur's marriage to Carrie. Arthur is driven to commit suicide by jumping over Niagara Falls. Background and publication Although Workers in the Dawn is the first of Gissing's published novels, it was not his first attempt at writing one. He had worked on another novel previously, but this unknown work was not accepted by any publishers, and has not survived.Korg, George Gissing, p. 25. The writing of Workers in the Dawn was completed in about a year,Korg, George Gissing, p. 32. and is the longest of Gissing's novels, with over 280,000 words across three volumes.Law, \\"'A vile way of publishing'\\", p. 82. The completion of the work was largely the result of encouragement and support from his friend Eduard Bertz.Korg, George Gissing, p. 32. Writing to a friend in Germany, Bertz described himself as \\"in a way...the begetter of the book\\".Quoted in Young, \\"George Gissing's friendship\\", p. 230. The novel is partly based on Gissing's own experiences of an unhappy marriage, to his first wife Marianne Helen Harrison.Korg, George Gissing, pp. 34-35. As well as this semi-autobiographical element, Gissing intended the book to have a social message. In a letter to his brother Algernon after publication, Gissing described the work as an \\"attack upon certain features of our present religious and social life which to me appear highly condemnable\\", particularly the \\"criminal negligence of governments\\". As an author, he saw himself as \\"a mouthpiece of the Radical party\\", concluding that \\"It is not a book for women and children, but for thinking and struggling men.\\"Quoted in Korg, George Gissing, p. 28. The original working title of the novel was Far Far Away, in reference to a song that appears in the novel, but the title was changed to Workers in the Dawn before publication.Korg, George Gissing, p. 28. Gissing explained in a letter to Algernon that he had chosen this latter title because the \\"principal characters are earnest young people striving for improvement in, as it were, the dawn of a new phase of our civilization\\".Korg, \\"Division of purpose\\", p. 325. Gissing first offered it to a publisher in November 1879, but he faced rejection from a number of publishing firms, including Smith and Elder, Chatto and Windus and C. Kegan Paul. Eventually, he decided to publish a run of 277 copies of the novel at his own expense, through Remington and Company. This project cost him £125, with the contract demanding payment of £50 upfront, £40 after the printing of the first two volumes and £35 after the publication of the third. Under the agreement of Remington, two-thirds of any profit would go to the author.Korg, George Gissing, p. 32. In the end, Gissing's income from Remington was sixteen shillings.Korg, George Gissing, p. 155. Later, when three-volume novels were less fashionable, Gissing worked on shorter revisions of his works, including Workers in the Dawn. He outlined changes in his own copy of the novel,Wolff, \\"Gissing's revision\\", p. 42. but this revision was not completed.Korg, George Gissing, p. 180. Reception Contemporary reviews generally acknowledged that there were positive aspects of the novel, but on the whole were critical of it. The first known review to appear was an anonymous piece in the Athenaeum. The reviewer considered Gissing to have \\"considerable readiness and fluency of style\\" and also praised the author for his graphically realistic depiction of the poor. However, he accused Gissing of making a mistake common among \\"polemical novelists\\", of taking away from the novel's seriousness by making the negative characterisations of the novel \\"so very grotesque\\". The reviewer also commented that Gissing was \\"not quite a master of...the Queen's English\\".Coustillas, George Gissing, pp. 51-52. In The Academy, George Saintsbury was also unconvinced by the characterisations of the \\"wicked\\" upper classes, but he remarked positively on Gissing's sincerity, imagination and adventurousness.Coustillas, George Gissing, p. 56. The Graphic was critical of many aspects of the work, with the reviewer stating that he finished reading it with a feeling of \\"perplexity\\" and \\"weariness\\". He further stated that \\"the book is without plot\\", showing \\"little evidence of literary skill\\". He suggested that the time and effort put into writing it \\"might well have been diverted to another channel\\". The Examiner suggested that its shortcomings meant that it would have been better if the novel had never been published, as \\"it is so very suggestive of what he might have done, and has not done; of what he might have avoided, and has not avoided\\". The publication of the review in the Athenaeum prompted Gissing, in a letter to Algernon, to describe critics as \\"unprincipled vagabonds\\". He criticised this particular reviewer for not understanding the \\"spirit of [the] book\\" and for judging it as a \\"mere polemical pamphlet, and not a work of art\\". However, he was flattered that his novel had received such a long critique in the magazine and concluded that overall it was \\"an attractive review\\".Coustillas, George Gissing, p. 51.

It is known as small cranberry, bog cranberry, swamp cranberry, or, particularly in Britain, just cranberry. It is widespread throughout the cool temperate northern hemisphere, including northern Europe, northern Asia and northern North America. Description This cranberry is a small, prostrate shrub with vine-like stems that root at the nodes. The leaves are leathery and lance- shaped, up to long. Flowers arise on nodding stalks a few centimeters tall. The corolla is white or pink and flexed backward away from the center of the flower. The fruit is a red berry which has spots when young. It measures up to wide. The plant forms associations with mycorrhizae. It mainly reproduces vegetatively. Distribution and habitat Vaccinium oxycoccos is a widespread and common species occurring broadly across cooler climates in the temperate northern hemisphere. Photos, description, French distribution map. Photos and European distribution map. It is an indicator of moist to wet soils which are low in nitrogen and have a high water table. It is an indicator of coniferous swamps. It grows in bogs and fens in moist forest habitat. It grows on peat which may be saturated most of the time. The soil in bogs is acidic and low in nutrients. The plant's mycorrhizae help it obtain nutrients in this situation. Fens have somewhat less acidic soil, which is also higher in nutrients. The plant can often be found growing on hummocks of Sphagnum mosses. Ecology In North America, other species found in this forest understory habitat include leatherleaf (Chamaedaphne calyculata), bog rosemary (Andromeda glaucophylla), bog laurel (Kalmia polifolia), pitcher plant (Sarracenia purpurea), Labrador tea (Rhododendron groenlandicum), cloudberry (Rubus chamaemorus), rhodora (Rhododendron canadense), glossy buckthorn (Rhamnus frangula), sundew (Drosera spp.), cottonsedge (Eriophorum virginatum and E. angustifolium), and species of sedge and lichen. The plant easily colonizes bog habitat that has recently burned. It survives fire with its underground rhizomes. Uses Vaccinium oxycoccos has been used as a medicine and as a food by various Native American communities. Some Iñupiat cook the cranberry with fish eggs and blubber.

Rider Haggard featuring Allan Quatermain. The plot concerns Quatermain as a young man and involves his first marriage, to the Boer farm girl, Marie Marais. Their romance is opposed by Marie's anti-English father, and her villainous cousin Hernan Pereira, who desires Marie. They are Voortrekkers who take part in the Great Trek whom Quatermain has to rescue. The novel describes Quatermain's involvement in the Sixth Xhosa War of 1835 and Weenen massacre. Real life people such as Piet Retief, Thomas Halstead, and the Zulu chief Dingane appear as characters. Events in Nada the Lily are frequently referred to. Plot The plot begins in Cradock, a District of Cape Colony, a somehow wild place with a handful of white settlers. Fifteen miles from the Mission station where Allan and his father who is a clergy of the church of England live, there lives a Boer called Henry Merais, who has a young daughter named Marie Marais. Allan, together with Marie are given a tutor called Monsieur Leblanc who instructs them in the learning of the French language and other subjects, and this is where and how Allan and Marie meet. What starts as a childhood friendship slowly grows into a fully fledged love and deep affection much to the chagrin of Marie's father who tries everything within his power to separate them. One day, monsieur Leblanc goes to one of his Sunday riding expeditions. Being intoxicated with his Peach brandy, and after sleeping, he wakes up to find his horse missing. Thinking it stolen, he sets out to look for it when he by chance comes across two red Kaffirs leading it away though looking for its owner to restore it back to him. On sighting them, he shoots the eldest son of the chief and he drops dead. When he fires again, he injures the other son on the thigh but he manages to run away to tell the tale. The result is that they trace the attacker to Maraisfontein and plans an ambush attack on it to avenge the death by killing all its inhabitants and driving away all their cattle. On hearing this, and with the little time available, Allan manages to raise support and tries as much as he can to save Maraisfontein. Though with initial success, with their supply of gunpowder dwindling, and almost losing the fight, they almost commit suicide when Henry Marais comes with other Boers from other camps and fires at the red Kaffirs thus bringing the matter to a happy conclusion. Allan saves Marie's life together with those of the servants save for Monsieur Leblanc who is captured and killed by the foe. After this, the love between Marie and Allan grows, and her father gets wind of the affair and tries to oppose it For his hate of the Englishmen and for the fact that he had promised his daughter's hand in marriage to another Boer called Hernando Pereira, who, on learning of how Marie loves Allan and would rather die than marry him, also hates Allan to the bone. He challenges Allan to a shooting match where they are to shoot at birds but Allan beats him to the game, and he and other Boers together with Marie's family decide to move away and finally settle at the banks of the Crocodile river some 50 miles from Delagoa Bay. Overtaken by hunger and fever, Marie writes a letter to Allan who organizes himself, says goodbye to his father and goes to their rescue with a good supply of food and other necessary provisions. He finally saves Marie's life for the second time, something which makes Marie love him even more. Slowly they recover, and they plan a journey to look for another place where the pasture of life is green. On the way, they encounter Dingane a king of the Zulu tribe's forces which had been sent to kill Allan. They, after much deliberation agree to take Allan and all his company to the king, who, ends up liking Allan. But he gives Allan a bet. He tells Allan to shoot three of five vultures with his gun to prove his magic and all his companions will be left to go free, something which he does, thus saving Marie's life for yet another time. When Marie becomes of age, Allan marries her though without her father's blessings. And after then set off to Dingane on matters of a Treaty about a piece of land that the Boers want to possess. Mistrusting the Boers, he tricks, deserts and his regiment massacres them saving Allan's life. Allan returns to his home and finds Marie weeping by the river where she had gone to draw water, wearing the robes of mourning. He goes home with her and all the people are excited to see him alive. When Hernando Pereira and his company arrive, due to Hernando Pereira's jealousy for winning Marie's hand in marriage, they are unhappy to see Allan alive and plot on how to exterminate him. They form a court to try Allan, build up false charges against him and sentence him to death by shooting. As the party move away to deliberate on how to execute him, Allan's servant spies on them and a plot is made of how to rescue him from death. They drug Allan's coffee with sleep inducing herbs brought by his servant, dresses him in Marie's clothes and then hide him in a grain pit leaving Marie in his place of detention. In the morning, Marie is taken out for execution. Thinking her to be Allan, she is shot at by Hernando Pereira, who in turn is shot at by Henry Merais for shooting his beloved daughter. As Hernando lies down in fits of his impending death, he confesses to have bared false witness during Allan's trial so as to bring him to his death. Hernando later dies with a lot of people calling out for curses upon him. A letter is given Allan from Marie to which he thanks him for saving her life thrice, and says that she has saved his life now in the end and goes to where she will be waiting for their reunion.

The Glasgow Story Retrieved June 2012 Most of the tobacco shipped from American slave plantations was sold to France. He later also made a further fortune stockpiling tobacco bought at keen prices shortly before the American Revolution, assuming that Great Britain would not be able to retain control over her rebellious colonies, and then selling at high prices. Cunninghame's (much altered and expanded) neo-classical house on Glasgow's Queen Street today houses the collection of the Gallery of Modern Art. Early life Cunninghame was born in 1715 Oliver, p.334 in Kilmarnock, Ayrshire, into a prosperous merchant family. He was a blood relative of Andrew Cochrane of Brighouse (1693–1777), who was one of Glasgow's most respected Lord Provosts. Family ties were of great importance in helping to build Cunninghame's growing fortune.The Glasgow Story Retrieved June 2012 Career William Cunninghame's neo-classical mansion on Queens St, Glasgow, built in 1780 at a cost of £10,000 Cunninghame first sailed to America in 1746 as a young apprentice in the firm of Cochrane, Murdoch & Company. After four years of training he was promoted to become a manager and in 1752 he came to oversee all the company business in Virginia. In 1762 he returned to Scotland, where he became the principal partner in the firm of Cochrane, Murdoch & Co. By the early 1770s he changed the company name to William Cunninghame & Company, and it grew to become one of the city's five largest importers. Twice a year his flagship – named The Cunninghame – arrived in the Chesapeake Bay, loaded with European luxury goods such as silverware and furniture, and ready to collect Tobacco for export back to Europe.Oliver, p.341 Cunninghame, like the other Glasgow merchants, extended credit to the growers enabling them to buy goods from the company store before their tobacco was sold at market. However, many growers found themselves deeply in debt and thereby forced to accept low prices for their crop. Cunningham was known to offer prices as much as 10% below market value to distressed growers.Oliver, p.342 American Revolution Cunninghame made an even greater fortune from the tobacco scarcity caused by the American War of Independence. On the outbreak of war, Cunningham's business partners found themselves in possession of substantial stocks of tobacco which they had purchased for around three pence per pound. As war began to disrupt the trade the price rose, and Cunningham's partners, confident that the rebellious colonists would soon be defeated, sold out their stock at sixpence per pound. Cunningham took the opposite view and he personally purchased their entire stock. Eventually, as the long war disrupted supplies, the price of tobacco rose to a staggering 3 shillings and sixpence, making a huge fortune for Cunninghame.Royal Exchange History Retrieved June 2012 Like many wealthy Glasgow merchants, Cunninghame used some of his profits to buy a country estate. In 1778 he purchased for £26,200 for the estate of Lainshaw, in Ayrshire. He also purchased a property in the Cow Loan in Glasgow, which he renamed Queen Street after the wife of George III, and in 1780 he built there a large mansion in the neo-classical style at a cost of £10,000, an immense sum at the time. In 1779 he completed his rise to the wealthy landed gentry by registering his family coat-of-arms at the office of the Lord Lyon in Edinburgh. In 1780 Cunninghame retired from the tobacco business, although he was not yet fifty years old. Family life Cunninghame married three times and had fourteen children. He disinherited his eldest sons Thomas and Alexander and it was his third son William Cunninghame who eventually inherited the estate in 1799.Paterson, Page 588 Legacy Today Cunninghame's neo classical palace on Glasgow's Queen Street houses the collection of the Gallery of Modern Art.

His research focuses on self-determination and self-determined learning, the application of positive psychology and strengths-based approaches to disability, and the education of students with intellectual or developmental disabilities. He is Director and Senior Scientist at Kansas University's Beach Center on Disability. He formerly directed the Kansas University Center on Developmental Disabilities.  Education  Wehmeyer earned his BS and MA in Special Education in 1980 and 1982 from the University of Tulsa. In 2013, he was an alumni inductee of Phi Beta Kappa Arts and Sciences Honor Society-Beta of Oklahoma chapter at the University of Tulsa. He was a Rotary International Fellow at the University of Sussex in Brighton, England in 1987 and 1988, receiving the M.Sc. in Experimental Psychology from the Laboratory of Experimental Psychology and Centre for Research on Perception and Cognition at Sussex in 1988. He received his PhD in 1989 from the University of Texas at Dallas, in the subject of human development and communication sciences. In 2014, he received The University of Texas at Dallas Distinguished Alumni Award on behalf of the School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences.  Research and teaching  Professor Wehmeyer's research has focused on the application of the self-determination construct to the disability context. Self-determination is a construct that has its origins in 17th and 18th Century philosophical doctrines pertaining to free will and determinism. In the early 20th Century, the discipline of psychology applied its experimental approach to issues pertaining to self-determination, examining the degree to which a person's actions or behaviors are ‘caused’ (e.g., determined) by internal factors or forces (auto-determinism or self- determination) or forces or factors external to the person (hetero-determinism or other-determined). Through much of the latter half of the 20th Century the primary use of the self-determination construct was in its application in the field of motivational psychology, particularly in the context of Self- Determination Theory. In 1992, Wehmeyer proposed a definition of the construct and a general framework drawing from research and knowledge in education and psychology, referred to as the functional model of self-determination, which served as a catalyst in the development of autonomy-supportive interventions to promote student self-determination. Most recently, Wehmeyer and colleagues have introduced Causal Agency Theory, which extends work to create autonomy- motivating interventions from the functional theory to align with Self- Determination Theory and Action-Control Belief Theory to describe a developmental process by which people engage in causal action and become more self-determined. Wehmeyer has co-authored or co-edited more than 45 books in the fields of special education and psychology, and has written more than 425 book chapters and journal articles. He is a co-author of the Supports Intensity Scales for Adults and Children of the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AAIDD), and of the 11th Edition of the AAIDD Intellectual Disability Terminology, Classification, and Systems of Supports Manual. He also trains teachers who work with students with multiple, severe disabilities. He is a Fellow and former Vice-President of the Americas of the International Association for the Scientific Study of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities,, a fellow of the American Psychological Association, Division 33 on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities/Autism Spectrum Disorder, and is a fellow of the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities, of which he is also a past president. He is a past co-editor of the AAIDD e-journal, Inclusion. From 2004 to 2005, Wehmeyer was president of the Council for Exceptional Children's Division on Career Development and Transition, and is currently president for the CEC Division on Autism and Developmental Disabilities. From 2005 to 2010, he was the editor-in-chief of the journal Remedial and Special Education.  Awards  Dr. Wehmeyer has received several awards for his research. In 2013, he received the Distinguished Researcher Award from The Arc of the United States, presented to a career academic researcher whose work has significantly advanced the field of research in intellectual and developmental disabilities. In 2015, Dr. Wehmeyer received the American Psychological Association Distinguished Contributions to the Advancement of Disability Issues in Psychology Award, the 2015 AAIDD Research Award for contributions that have contributed significantly to the body of scientific knowledge in the field of intellectual and developmental disabilities, and the Council for Exceptional Children, Division on Autism and Developmental Disabilities Burton Blatt Humanitarian Award, presented to a person who has made significant contributions to the field of intellectual disabilities, developmental disabilities, and/or autism. In the same year, Dr. Wehmeyer received the Higuchi-KU Endowment Research Achievement Awards, Balfour S. Jefferey Award, given in recognition of research achievement in the humanities and social sciences to an individual who may be described as having had a major and substantial impact and who has been of national and/or international interest.

The family, which is of Turkish and other middle eastern descent, was subinfeudated under the Rulers of Bengal, on behalf of whom they collected land revenues in the area. In the 19th century, the family traded jute with the British East India Company. They built mosques, schools and other structures around the estate which still stand today in their homestead of Taltoli. History=18th-19th centuries Partial ruins of the eastern wing of the Munshibari Jama Masjid. During the 17th and 18th centuries, merchants and clerics from around the world came to India. Various groups such as the Arabs preached Islam, while the Europeans traded silks and spices in various provinces. The ancestors of the clan, were from Eastern Turkey and was named Et'tin. Although they were traders at first, land grants (Jagirs) enabled them to live off of the shares of the Empire's revenue and taxes from the lands. Earlier revenue collectors in Bengal, Bihar and Orissa had been functionaries who held the right to collect revenue on behalf of the Emperor and his representative, or diwan in Bengal (Nawabs of Bengal). The diwan supervised the tax collectors to ensure that they were neither lax nor overly stringent. When the East India Company was awarded the diwani or overlordship of Bengal by the empire in 1764, it found itself short of trained administrators, especially those familiar with local custom and law. As a result, landholders were unsupervised or they reported to corrupt and indolent officials. The result was that revenues were extracted without regard for future income or local welfare. Following the devastating famine of 1770, which was partially caused by this short-sightedness, Company officials in Calcutta better understood the importance of oversight of revenue officials. They failed to consider the question of incentivisation; hence Warren Hastings, then governor-general, introduced a system of five-yearly inspections and temporary tax farmers. It is in this time, that a lot of foreign merchants and traders, well versed in reading, writing and account- keeping were employed by the British to collect revenue and maintain order. The title Munshi therefore denotes the family's role in teaching native languages such as Urdu, Hindi, Persian and Bengali or as secretaries to the Europeans. There were possible intermarriages with the British during this period. 19th-20th centuries Moss-covered ruins of the Munshibari mansion during the monsoon. In the mid-19 century, the family traded produces from the lands around the estate, Jute was one of the primary commodities, sold in Narayanganj. Jute has been grown in the Indian subcontinent for centuries. It was produced for domestic consumption in the villages of East Bengal. However, jute fibre sample to the United Kingdom strictly for experimentation related to mechanical processing. The breakthrough came in 1833, when jute fibre was spun mechanically in Dundee, Scotland. This was the harbinger of the world jute era. A jute industry soon mushroomed all over Western Europe with Dundee as its main centre. The first Indian Jute mill was constructed in 1855 at Rishra. By the early 20th century the Calcutta Jute industry surpassed the European Jute industry. The family employed and intermixed with local muslim Beparis. Bangladesh became the largest exporter of raw jute in the world.

Note the Turkish Emblems around the mosques interior The Munshibari Jama Masjid was established in the region as local muslims had nowhere to pray. It was completed in British India, in 1891 by Huss'eyn ud-Din Munshi alongside a pond owned by the Munshibari family. Built by local masons, the structure is of Indo-Saracenic and Indo-Islamic blend. It has four minarets (or manārah مناره) in four corners of the structure, a hall way, the Mihrab (محراب) in the main prayer room (musallah). The Mihrab also has a Minbar (منبر) for regional khatibs (خطيب) to deliver sermons (khutbah; خطبة) The exterior has a corridor by the pond for ritual purification (Wudu; الوضوء). The stairs lead to the top of the mosque. The structure also houses a living quarter for the Islamic scholars, and carved in library in the main hall for scriptures used during Madrasah (مدرسة) lessons. Since the late 19th century, the Imams (أئمة) and Muezzins (مؤذن) called on the local muslims to the congregational mosque (then known as the Munshibari Masjid), where Jumu'ah (صلاة الجمعة) or weekly Friday noon (Dhuhr; صلاة الظهر) congregation prayers took place. Typical classroom for local schoolboys at Taltoli Public Primary School The family also established the first school called Taltoli Public Primary School for the muslim population living on the estate. It was named after Bilayet-un-Nissa, the wife of Ab'dul Hamid Munshi, a member of the family, who made a school for her because she wanted to attend lessons outside of the residence. In the 1850s muslim women were not allowed to regularly visit outside of the private quarters of the residences. The family employed regional teachers, as first starting with lessons in Urdu, Persian and Arabic delivered by Islamic teachers from the family mosque. After the war of 1971, the Government of Bangladesh took over the school and declared it a public institution under the curriculum of the Ministry of Education.

She was allegedly married to Munir Khan, a member of the banned Bangladeshi Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami. Khan, along with some members of her family, was allegedly shot dead in 2011 in Maharashtra. Alleged role in terror activities Khan allegedly supplied the Lashkar-e- Taiba (LeT), a terrorist organisation was planning an attack, with information on the city of Mumbai. Disappearance On the night of 30 January 2011, Khan, accompanied by her mother Shelina, older sister Hashmina, twin siblings Imran and Zara, and cousin Rehshma, drove out of Mumbai towards their holiday home in Igatpuri, 126 km north of Mumbai. On 9 February 2011, Khans's mother spoke with her sister, Albana Patel, and said that Khan was in Chandigarh with her third husband Pervez Iqbal Tak. After this, the family vanished without a trace. Subsequently, Khans's father, Nadir Shah Patel (Shelina's first husband), filed a complaint at a Mumbai police station stating that his daughter had gone missing along with other members of her family. A similar complaint was also filed by Bollywood film director Rakesh Sawant, who was shooting his second film Jinnat with Khan just before she disappeared from Mumbai. Nadir Shah Patel has appealed to the Bombay High Court on 17 July 2012 seeking transfer of her daughter's murder case from Crime Branch to NIA , alleging that the former did not probe the case promptly. Police investigation and arrest of suspects Khan's step-fathers, Parvez Iqbal Tak, a suspected Lashkar-e-Taiba member, and Asif Sheikh (Shelina's second husband), were suspected of being behind Khan and her family's disappearance. Police also questioned Nadir Shah Patel during the investigation. Parvez Iqbal Tak was arrested by the Jammu and Kashmir Police in connection with another case on 21 June 2012. During interrogation Tak admitted that Khan and some members of her family were shot dead in Maharashtra in February 2011. The next day Tak retracted his story, claiming instead that Khan and her family were still alive. The Crime Branch of Mumbai Police investigating the kidnapping case brought Tak to Mumbai, where he was produced before Esplanade Court, Southern Mumbai on 10 July 2012. The Court sent Tak to Police custody until 19 July. Confessing before the Crime Branch, Tak changed his statement for a third time, claiming instead, that he intended to kill Khan's mother Shelina for continuously humiliating him, and for having relationship with other men. Tak told interrogators that he, along with his associates killed Khan and her five family members and buried their bodies behind her Igatpuri bungalow. He allegedly killed all of them as Khan had witnessed her mother's murder. Owing to Tak's continuously changing statements, the Mumbai Police was reluctant to place full reliance on his testimony. Tak was taken to Igatpuri to corroborate the claims he made during his interrogation. Asif Sheikh was arrested from Bengaluru. Sheikh confessed that he and Tak shot and killed Khan and her family. Asif Sheikh's name was revealed as one of the co-conspirators by Parvez Tak in his earlier confession before the Jammu and Kashmir Police. While examining Khan's Igatpuri bungalow, the Police investigation team found six buried bodies, believed to be those of Khan and her family members.Laila Khan case: Actress, family killed with iron rods after BBQ party  NDTV.com Aftermath It is believed that money, jealousy, property and possible shifting of the family to Dubai were the cause of the family murder. Investigation of Tak revealed that he intended to flee to Nepal where his Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) connections would have helped him to avoid arrest. He was, however, arrested by the J&K; police in another case, before he could flee to Nepal. The Police has also detained two persons - Jolly Guilder and Mehboob, who Tak had hired to drive Khan's car from Igatpuri to Indore and onward to Delhi, and finally to Kishtwar where it was eventually recovered. As a part of their investigations, police are likely to open Khan's bank locker and scan three bank accounts of the family. In November 2012, based on a DNA test report crime branch officer claimed that the remains discovered at Khan's Igatpuri farmhouse belonged to her and her relatives.

Cruikshank is an astronomer and planetary scientist in the Astrophysics Branch at NASA Ames Research Center. His research specialties are spectroscopy and radiometry of planets and small bodies in the Solar System. These small bodies include comets, asteroids, planetary satellites, dwarf planets (e.g., Pluto), and objects in the region beyond Neptune (Kuiper belt objects and trans-Neptunian bodies). He uses spectroscopic observations made with ground-based and space-based telescopes, as well as interplanetary spacecraft, to identify and study the ices, minerals, and organic materials that compose the surfaces of planets and small bodies. Together with several colleagues, Cruikshank has found many kinds of ice on several small planetary bodies. These include frozen CH4, N2, CO, CO2, and H2O on Neptune's satellite Triton, CH4, N2, and CO on Pluto, H2O on Pluto's satellite Charon, H2O ice on many of the moons of Saturn and Uranus, H2O and CH3OH on the Centaur object 5145 Pholus. In studies with the Cassini spacecraft, he and his colleagues have found hydrocarbons on several of Saturn's satellites. Career Cruikshank gained a B.S. in Physics at Iowa State University and finished his graduate studies with a Ph.D. degree at the University of Arizona in the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory as a student of Gerard Kuiper in 1968. After a year in the USSR as a National Academy of Sciences exchange scientist, he returned to Arizona for a year, and then moved to the University of Hawaii in mid-1970. As an astronomer at the Institute for Astronomy, he helped with the development of Mauna Kea as one of the most important observatory sites in the world, and used the many telescopes there for his observational studies of the bodies in the Solar System.

The Munshibari was a feudal estate in Kurigram District in the Division of Rajshahi, Bengal (present day Bangladesh). It was founded in the mid-18th century by an official of the Rulers of Bengal. History During the period of Brojendra Lal Munshi, a custodian was chosen named Kanai Lal Sarkar. According to him, during the reign of Nawab Shirajuddaula, the sixth Nawab of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa of the Afshar Dynasty, Bonwari Munshi had an employee under the latter, with the title of Munshi. Bonwari Munshi once had come for hunting to the area of Dharnibari Union by river over the Bamnee. He liked the land and suggested this to the Nawab and requested some for himself, receiving 21.20 acres of land for himself and a further 11.20 acres for Laxmi Narayan. The family hence established the estate with around 34 acres of land under Bonwari Munshi and Laxmi Narayan. The Islamic Mission and Foundation had taken 7.42 acres of land that had been adjoining the building for almost a century under the Government. There, a hospital and a mosque had been set up for the local people. In addition, some land had been given to local people on an annual lease. Family It is said that Bonawari Munshi never had a child which is why, his wife Kadinginee Munshi adopted a son, named Binod to serve the estate's founder, Laxmi Narayan. Binod, as it turned out, was also without an heir. His wife Krishna Kaminee adopted another son called Brojendra Lal for the same cause. Finally, Brojendra Lal Munshi's wife, Asharatha Munshi gave birth to two daughters. The oldest named Shuchi Rani and younger was called Shushama. The latter died young. Sachi Rani was married off in Kushtia, her family later leaving to live in Kolkata. Her child named as Sushamakanti who along his family lives in Kolkata. Shachis mother Asalata then adopted a male child for the inheriting the estate. After the Bangladesh Liberation War, Bihari Lal Munshi the incumbent head of the family went to Kolkata giving the responsibility of taking care of the Munshi Bari to a local named Saifur Mia, who allegedly handed over the Munshibari to one Arif Mia. Dissolution and government takeover Conflict arose among the locals when the caretaker, Arif Mia tried take over the estate. Arif Mia fired his gun and two local students were shot and killed, one of them dying instantly while the other succumbed to his wounds. A case was then filed, and subsequently dismissed. The Government of Bangladesh then took control of the Munshibari along with all its property. In 1987, the Revenue Office of Dharnibari was placed within the estate where they still operate. Legacy The ruins of the estate consist of the Nat Mondir or a play house, Durga temple, Biswanu temple, the dining room and kitchen. There is also the Gobinda Mondir, the drawing room, bedrooms, rest room in the upper floor, bathrooms and Shiva temple. The people of the locality have been using the pond in the premises for uses while the other portions are being used by the Government of Bangladesh as offices. Every year Durga Mela is also held within the Munshibari grounds. Related houses The Munshibari of Calcutta, is, according to the book Baranagar: Itihas O Samikshya by Anup Motilal and Ranjankumar Bandopadhyay, had its origins in the days of Warren Hastings (1732 – 1818). Constructed in 1855, the building had been turned into a Retirement home.

Biography Dyke White He was born in Garlieston, Wigtownshire, the youngest of the seven children of William McClure and Catherine, née Puckett, and was always known by the family as Gordon. Gordon’s father was originally a shopkeeper in Garlieston, but the family moved to Glasgow some time between 1891 and 1901. Gordon attended the Glasgow School of Art, and was awarded a Haldane Travelling Scholarship which enabled him to travel on the continent. He was initially a painter, and exhibited at the Glasgow Royal Institute of Fine Arts and other Scottish exhibitions. One of his oil paintings is said to have caused a furore in the Glasgow Art Gallery. It was called “The Intruder”, and was a painting of a lady bathing in the bulrushes with someone peeping in at her. He found he had a talent as a cartoonist, and joined the Glasgow branch of the National Union of Journalists in November 1917, moving to London in June 1926 and back to Glasgow in January 1929. He became a well-known cartoonist, working for Outram Press in Glasgow. His cartoons give a lively take on Public Life in the 1920s and 30's. They were regularly printed in various Glasgow papers, including the Daily Record and Mail, and the Scottish Daily Express, and also for a period in London papers. He always worked under the pseudonym Dyke White, a name which harks back to his childhood in Garlieston (White Dyke Farm.) He worked briefly as a political cartoonist for the Rand Daily Mail in Johannesburg, South Africa, but returned home, probably because he was disillusioned by the politics there. Gordon was married to Hilda (née Butler), and they had three children – Ramsey, Robin and Rachel. He died on 25 July 1933 in Lenzie, near Glasgow. After his untimely death, a Memorial Exhibition of his cartoons was held by the Glasgow Art Club.

It states that, after the addition of a compact operator () or Hilbert–Schmidt operator () of arbitrarily small norm, a bounded self-adjoint operator or unitary operator on a Hilbert space is conjugate by a unitary operator to a diagonal operator. The results are subsumed in later generalizations for bounded normal operators due to David Berg (1971, compact perturbation) and Dan-Virgil Voiculescu (1979, Hilbert–Schmidt perturbation). The theorem and its generalizations were one of the starting points of operator K-homology, developed first by Lawrence G. Brown, Ronald Douglas and Peter Fillmore and, in greater generality, by Gennadi Kasparov. In 1958 Kuroda showed that the Weyl–von Neumann theorem is also true if the Hilbert–Schmidt class is replaced by any Schatten class Sp with p ≠ 1. For S1, the trace-class operators, the situation is quite different. The Kato–Rosenblum theorem, proved in 1957 using scattering theory, states that if two bounded self-adjoint operators differ by a trace-class operator, then their absolutely continuous parts are unitarily equivalent. In particular if a self-adjoint operator has absolutely continuous spectrum, no perturbation of it by a trace-class operator can be unitarily equivalent to a diagonal operator.

The hotel has been built on the site of an abandoned quarry and, notably, features some rooms underwater. The design and construction process of the hotel was fraught with many delays prior to 2013. Since 2013, however, the design optimization and onsite construction progressed at a fairly swift pace. The fit-out work carried out in 2017 and finally opened on 20 November 2018. History The InterContinental Hotels Group is behind the project as one of its flagship hotels in the country under the banner of Shimao Wonderland InterContinental. The design was shortlisted for an award at the World Architecture Festival in 2009. According to Shanghaiist, the Shanghai Shimao Property Group has an investment of US$555 million in the project. It opened on 20 November 2018. Construction The concept and facade design firm for this project is JADE+QA, led by Martin Jochman, who designed the concept while working with ATKINS and in 2013 set up his own practice in Shanghai and continued working on this project directly for the developer Shimao with his own studio JADE+QA. The local architectural firm is ECADI (East China Architectural Design & Research Institute Co., Ltd.), which is responsible for design development, construction documents, structural design and MEP. The interior design firms are CCD (Cheng Chung Design) and AB Concept. The lighting design consultant is Illuminate Lighting Design. The hotel is 18 stories, 16 of which are below ground level including two projected underwater floors; two of the floors are above the 88m deep quarry. The abandoned quarry is partially filled with water to create an artificial lake. The hotel is designed in an \\"S\\" shape utilizing a convex to concave form.The architects' vision is one of sequential hanging gardens that will produce the effect of a green hill extending down the face of the quarry. Both the quarry's rock face and the wings of the blocks of guest rooms are projected to surround an atrium within the hotel. The vertical atrium made of glass will (above the hotel) is intended to symbolise an artificial \\"waterfall.\\" Gizmag called the waterfall the \\"pièce de résistance\\" of the project. Facilities The project would include facilities for extreme sports, a visitor centre and a five-star hotel with some underwater rooms. The hotel has 337 rooms as well as conference facility for up to 1,000 people, a grand ballroom and restaurants and cafes on the ground floor above the hotel. There are two underwater floors, the lower one of which will feature MEP installation and the upper one with guest rooms and a restaurant facing an aquarium with a depth of five metres. Pricing Rooms were expected to be priced at a minimum of US $500 per night, however, in 2020 the rooms are priced in the US $360 range. https://www.ihg.com/intercontinental/hotels/us/en/shanghai/shghe/hoteldetail ReferencesExternal links *InterContinental Shanghai Wonderland official website *Architect's photos Hotels in Shanghai InterContinental hotels Buildings and structures completed in 2018 ","title":"InterContinental Shanghai Wonderland"},{"id":"36115422","text":"Neftalí Soto Santiago is a farmer, attorney and former Secretary of Agriculture of Puerto Rico.

The Mongolian nomadic lifestyle and the local climatic conditions gave rise to specific methods of preserving meat. The most widespread one is air-drying or 'bortsloh'. Preparation The fresh meat is cut into long strips, 2-3 cm thick and 5-7 cm wide. The strips are hung on strings under the roof of a ger, where the air is free to circulate. After about a month the meat is dry, having turned into small, hard, wooden-like sticks with a brown color. This method of preservation causes the volume of the meat to shrink significantly. The dried borts is broken into small pieces or ground to a coarse and fibrous powder. It is stored in a linen bag, which allows contact with air. In the dry climate of Mongolia, this method of storage preserves the quality of the meat over months, or even years. Nowadays, borts is also industrially manufactured, and can be bought by the kilogram in paper bags. This is very convenient for city dwellers who do not have a ger to dry their meat in. However, traditionalists insist that the taste of those products cannot compete with that of the homemade variety. Borts is more nutritious, and said to be tastier, than other modern field rations. There is an unconfirmed method from old times: Mongolian nobles relied on borts for months-long journeys. Dried carefully for three years and then ground into a fine powder, until it all could fit through a sieve. It further shrinks volume of the borts so whole cow's meat can fit into a cow's bladder.

Davids was born in Bedford, New York. His family moved to New York City when Thaddeus was thirteen years old. There he entered the employ of an ink manufacturer who, when he died, left the company to Thaddeus,The American stationer, Volume 79 however, because he was still a minor, the business had to be listed in his father’s name, William Davids. During this early period he failed to receive payment for a government contract and gave up the business, going to sea for a short time. Upon returning, he entered the business again and prospered with his manufacture of quality ink. An 1829/30 New York Directory listing still had William Davids, Chemist, in the listing. Thaddeus would have become of legal age in 1831. Davids’ introduction of steel pen ink in 1827 was his best product at the time and was guaranteed to write black and be of \\"record\\" quality. By 1833, Davids was making ink similar to English inks, which he called \\"chemical writing fluid\\", and added indigo for more color. Davids continued with more innovative and improved inks in the following years, and his inks became as good as, or better than, any on the market. In 1856, an experiment by a well known chemist listed his as the least fading ink on the market when compared with such names as \\"Maynard & Noyes\\", \\"Harrison’s Columbian\\" and \\"Blackwood’s\\". This was an important factor for businesses and government. These results were copied and used on bottle labels and trade cards handed out by the company at the 1876 Centennial in Philadelphia. By the late 1830s, Davids was prosperous enough that he wanted to buy a country place in New Rochelle, New York, a short distance from New York City. Leaving the business in the hands of his partner, he took some time negotiating for the New Rochelle property. When he returned to the city, he found out his partner had somehow managed to sell the business and ruin him. Instead of being wealthy, Davids was $700 in debt, but with hard work, he entered the business again for himself at 112 John Street in 1840. Davids intended to move the company to New Rochelle in 1854 however the old mill being renovated for the ink factory burned.New Rochelle, Barbara Davis This mill had been used for making sealing wax and wafers. An 1888 article in a N.Y. magazine said they still maintained two factories in New Rochelle. Mostly likely this was the John B. Davids Company and a factory for the production of wax, wafers and miscellaneous products.ILLUSTRATED NEW YORK: THE METROPOLIS OF TO-DAY (1888) After moving back to New York City, manufacturing plants and offices were at 127 and 129 William Street.American druggist and pharmaceutical record, Volumes 58-59 At the William Street factory, they made thirty-three different inks as well as other products. The steel pen ink was still being made from the original formula at least through the early 1900s. In 1856 a son, George W. Davids, was admitted as a partner, and the company became known as Thaddeus Davids and Company. The company continued to grow and prosper under Thaddeus and his sons. But in 1883, he was ruined again, this time by his son George, a senior partner and financial manager of the company. George, unbeknown to his father, had incurred debts far more than the assets of the company using the company as collateral. When these debts became known and due in early 1883, the company couldn’t pay them. In April of that year, the New York Times reported the apparent suicide of George W. Davids in a New York City hotel from an overdose of laudanum. Thaddeus, being the honorable man he was known to be, sold everything he owned, including his New Rochelle properties, to pay off creditors. The company went into a receivership with another son and junior partner, David, at the helm. It was reorganized as a stock company, and the business continued. Thaddeus suffered a stroke soon after this from which he never fully recovered. The last decade of his life was spent suffering from gout and the effects of the stroke. Under David F. Davids the company again prospered. He and his brother Edwin took the company into the 20th century. With David’s death in 1905, and Edwin’s in 1907, other family members took over. In 1908 the company moved to Vandam Street. The Vandam factory made use of electricity and was completely up to date in the manufacturing process. Machines powered by electric motors did work previously done by hand. Besides the ink business, Davids purchased a lot of real estate which enhanced his fortune. He bought several properties, which he divided up into house lots in New Rochelle where he eventually made his home. Perhaps his best known land purchase was an island just off the shoreline of New Rochelle with intentions of moving his ink factory there that became known as Davids' Island.The Westchester historian, Volumes 66-70 Instead he leased (and later sold) it to someone else, who leased it to and later sold it to the U.S. Government who used it as Fort Slocum. During the Civil War, this island was used to hold Confederate prisoners. DeCamp Hospital was established to house wounded soldiers from both sides. His New Rochelle estate, \\"Echo Place\\", was sold to George W. Sutton in 1884, and was later developed by Sutton's Heirs into the upscale residential enclave Sutton Manor. The last six years of his life, he was confined to his room, unable to walk, although his mind was unimpaired until the last. His problems with gout were severe. He is quoted in many ads for the St. Jacobs Oil Company as saying this oil healed his gout. Apparently it didn’t, as that was a major health problem until the end of his life, so most likely he was paid for this endorsement. As many old obituaries do, his last words were noted, his being \\"Home, Sweet Home.\\" Thaddeus Davids died at his New Rochelle home on July 22, 1894. He was buried in Beechwoods Cemetery in New Rochelle, New York.

In contrast, a vicar is also a cleric but functions as an assistant and representative of an administrative leader. Ancient usage In ancient times bishops, as rulers of cities and provinces, especially in the Papal States, were called rectors, as were administrators of the patrimony of the Church (e.g. '). The Latin term ' was used by Pope Gregory I in Regula Pastoralis as equivalent to the Latin term ' (shepherd).  Roman Catholic Church In the Roman Catholic Church, a rector is a person who holds the office of presiding over an ecclesiastical institution. The institution may be a particular building--like a church (called his rectory church) or shrine--or it may be an organization, such as a parish, a mission or quasi-parish, a seminary or house of studies, a university, a hospital or a community of clerics or religious. If a rector appointed as his employee someone to perform the duties of his office, i.e. to act for him \\"vicariously\\", that employee was termed his vicar. Thus, the tithes of a parish are the legal property of the person who holds the office of rector, and are not the property of his vicar, who is not an office-holder but a mere employee, remunerated by a stipend, i.e. a salary, payable by his employer the rector. Thus, a parish vicar is the vicarious agent of his rector, whilst, higher up the scale, the Pope is called the Vicar of Christ, acting vicariously for the ultimate superior in the ecclesiastical hierarchy. The 1983 Code of Canon Law, for the Latin Church of the Catholic Church, explicitly mentions as special cases three offices of rectors: * rectors of seminaries (c. 239 & c. 833 #6) * rectors of churches that do not belong to a parish, a chapter of canons, or a religious order (c. 556 & 553) * rectors of Catholic universities (c. 443 §3 #3 & c. 833 #7) However, these are not the only officials who exercise their functions using the title of rector. Since the term rector refers to the function of the particular office, a number of officials are not referred to as rectors even though they are rectors in actual practice. The diocesan bishop, for instance, is himself a rector, since he presides over both an ecclesiastical organization (the diocese) and an ecclesiastical building (his cathedral). In many dioceses, the bishop delegates the day-to-day operation of the cathedral to a priest, who is often incorrectly called a rector but whose specific title is ' or \\"people's pastor\\", especially if the cathedral operates as a parish church. Therefore, because a priest is designated head of a cathedral parish, he cannot be both rector and pastor, as a rector cannot canonically hold title over a parish (c.556). As a further example, the pastor of a parish (') is pastor (not rector) over both his parish and the parish church. Finally, a president of a Catholic university is rector over the university and, if a priest, often the rector of any church that the university may operate, on the basis that it is not a canonical establishment of a parish (c. 557 §3). In some religious congregations of priests, rector is the title of the local superior of a house or community of the order. For instance, a community of several dozen Jesuit priests might include the pastor and priests assigned to a parish church next door, the faculty of a Jesuit high school across the street, and the priests in an administrative office down the block. However, the community as a local installation of Jesuit priests is headed by a rector. Rector general is the title given to the superior general of certain religious orders, e.g. the Clerics Regular of the Mother of God, Pallottines. There are some other uses of this title, such as for residence hall directors, such as Father George Rozum CSC, at the University of Notre Dame which were once (and to some extent still are) run in a seminary-like fashion. This title is used similarly at the University of Portland, another institution of the Congregation of Holy Cross. The Pope is called \\"rector of the world\\" during the discontinued papal coronation ceremony that was once part of the papal inauguration. Permanent rector is an obsolete term used in the United States prior to the codification of the 1917 Code of Canon Law. Canon Law grants a type of tenure to pastors (') of parishes, giving them certain rights against arbitrary removal by the bishop of their diocese. In order to preserve their flexibility and authority in assigning priests to parishes, bishops in the United States until that time did not actually appoint priests as pastors, but as \\"permanent rectors\\" of their parishes: the \\"permanent\\" gave the priest a degree of confidence in the security in his assignment, but the \\"rector\\" rather than \\"pastor\\" preserved the bishop's absolute authority to reassign clergy. Hence, many older parishes list among their early leaders priests with the postnominal letters \\"P.R.\\" (as in, a plaque listing all of the pastors of a parish, with \\"Rev. John Smith, P.R.\\"). This practice was discontinued and today priests are normally assigned as pastors of parishes, and bishops in practice reassign them at will (though there are still questions about the canonical legality of this).  Anglican churches In Anglican churches, a rector is a type of parish priest. Historical use Historically, parish priests in the Church of England consisted of rectors, vicars, and perpetual curates. Parish churches and their incumbent clergy were supported by tithes, a form of local tax levied on the personal as well as agricultural output of the parish. A rector received direct payment of both the greater and lesser tithes of his parish, whilst a vicar received only the lesser tithes (the greater tithes going to the lay holder, or impropriator, of the living). A perpetual curate held the Cure of souls in an area which had not yet been formally or legally constituted as a parish, and received neither greater nor lesser tithes, but only a small stipend in return for his duties. Perpetual curates tended to have a lower social status, and were often quite poorly remunerated. Quite commonly, parishes that had a rector as priest also had glebe lands attached to the parish. The rector was then responsible for the repair of the chancel of his church — the part dedicated to the sacred offices — while the rest of the building was the responsibility of the parish. This rectorial responsibility persists, in perpetuity, with the occupiers of the original rectorial land where it has been sold. This is called chancel repair liability, and affects institutional, corporate and private owners of land once owned by around 5,200 churches in England and Wales. (See also Church of England structure.) Contemporary English use The traditional titles of rector and vicar continue in English use today, although the roles and the conditions of employment are now essentially the same. Which of the titles is held by the parish priest is largely historical, some parishes having a rector and others a vicar. Owing to the origins of the terms, parishes with a rector are often of more notable historical importance or prominence than parishes with a vicar. The title of perpetual curate was abolished in 1968. However, \\"Priest- in-charge\\" is now a common third form of title in the contemporary Church of England, and is applied to the parish priest of a parish in which presentation to the living has been suspended - a process by which the bishop takes temporary responsibility for the appointment of the parish priest, regardless of who holds the legal rights of patronage in that parish. From the middle of the twentieth century the Church of England has developed team ministries, in which several priests work in a team to run a group of parishes and churches. In such a team arrangement, the senior priest holds the title \\"Team Rector\\", whilst other incumbent priests in the team are entitled \\"Team Vicar\\". In the Deanery of Jersey, which is part of the Church of England, a rector is appointed to one of the island's twelve historic parishes and as such has a role in the civil parish administration alongside the Constable; the parish also takes full responsibility (through levy of rates) for maintaining the church. Vicars are appointed to district churches, have no civil administrative roles by right, and their churches' upkeep is resourced by the members of the congregation. Contemporary use in other nations In the Church of Ireland, Scottish Episcopal Church and Anglican Church of Canada, most parish priests are called rectors, not vicars. However, in some dioceses of the Anglican Church of Canada rectors are officially licensed as incumbents to express the diocesan polity of employment of clergy. In the Episcopal Church in the United States of America, the \\"rector\\" is the priest elected to head a self-supporting parish. A priest who is appointed by the bishop to head a parish in the absence of a rector is termed a \\"priest-in-charge\\", as is a priest leading a mission (that is, a congregation which is not self- supporting). \\"Associate priests\\" are priests hired by the parish to supplement the rector in his or her duties while \\"assistant priests\\" are priests resident in the congregation who help on a volunteer basis. The positions of \\"vicar\\" and \\"curate\\" are not recognized in the canons of the entire church. However, some diocesan canons do define \\"vicar\\" as the priest-in-charge of a mission; and \\"curate\\" is often used for assistants, being entirely analogous to the English situation.Canons of the Episcopal Church in the United State of America, III.9.3 In schools affiliated with the Anglican church the title \\"rector\\" is sometimes used in secondary schools and boarding schools, where the headmaster is often a priest.

Coxa vara occurs in 50–90% of cases and noninflammatory pericarditis in 30%. Genetics The gene responsible for this condition is located on the long arm of chromosome 1 (1q). The encoded protein is a glycoprotein of ~345 kDa specifically synthesized by chondrocytes located at the surface of articular cartilage, and also by some synovial lining cells. The cDNA encodes a protein of 1,404 amino acids (human A isoform) with a somatomedin B homology domain, heparin-binding domains, multiple mucin-like repeats, a hemopexin domain, and an aggregation domain. There are 3 consensus sequences for N-glycosylation and 1 chondroitin sulfate substitution site. Diagnosis=Laboratory The full blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C reactive protein are normal. Synovial fluid is typically viscous, clear, honey-colored, and low in cell count. Synovial histology shows little or no mononuclear infiltration. Mild thickening of the synovium is present and giant cells may be occasionally seen. Radiology Large acetabular cysts are common in this condition. Other features include periarticular osteopenia, squaring of metacarpals and phalanges and bilateral joint effusions.

It has been described to live in various terrestrial habitats and is often associated with compost, dung, mud, other decaying materials and different kinds of beetles. Some have even been described from fresh water and marine habitats. In 2011, a new species has been described by Steel et al. This species was isolated from compost during the composting process and was named Mononchoides composticola. Habitat=Composting process Mononchoides composticola became dominantly present in the studied compost heap. The composting process is typically subdivided into 3 different phases based on the temperature profile: # the thermophilic phase (45 °C - 75 °C) # the cooling phase (45 °C environmental temperature) # the maturation phase (≈ environmental temperature) It is during the last two phases that Mononchoides composticola would become dominant in the compost heap. Feeding habits Mononchoides composticola has several preferences to what it consumes for food. It has the ability to actively move towards bacterial food resources such as Achromobacter species. It is also able to prey on other (compost)nematodes and demonstrates a higher predation rate on the relatively small and slow moving nematodes in the genus Rhabditella than on the larger though more motile Poikilolaimus species. This means that M. composticola has a dual feeding behavior and can alternate between bacterial and nematode prey. Characteristics=Morphometric data All the measurements are expressed in µm.  Diagnosis  Mononchoides composticola is characterised by a combination of the following morphological features: * a denticulate ridge in addition to the dorsal claw-like tooth * a small tooth-like swelling at the stegostom base * ca 26 longitudinal ridges on the female body * a uterine sac associated with two dumb-bell-shaped pouches * spicules that are relatively small (30-38 μm) * a simple gubernaculum less than half the spicule length long * the genital subventral papillae (v6) consisting of three very small papillae * an especially long filiform tail  Phylogenetic analysis  Mononchoides composticola is part of a clade that contains Mononchoides striatus, Tylopharynx foetida and Aduncospiculum halicti (grey box).

Etymology The name is derived from Filipino puto (traditional Filipino steamed rice cakes) and Spanish seco (\\"dry\\"), in reference to its texture. It is also spelled as \\"puto seko\\". Description Multicolored puto masa Traditional puto seco is made from galapong, ground glutinous rice grains soaked in water overnight. However, modern versions are more commonly made with rice flour or all-purpose flour. It is mixed with cornstarch, butter, eggs, salt, and sugar. Milk can also be added. It is baked until it becomes dry and brittle. Some modern versions of puto seco come in other flavors like ube (purple yam), coconut, and buko pandan. Multicolored candy-like versions of puto seco are sometimes known as puto masa (lit. \\"corn dough puto\\"). This variant is common in the provinces of Laguna and Batangas.

The manuscript has not survived in complete condition.  Description  The codex contains the text of the four Gospels on 165 parchment leaves (size ). The text is written in one column per page, 28 lines per page, with some lacunae in Matthew 28:18-20; Mark 1:1-21; Luke 1:1-22; John 1:1-27. The text is divided according to chapters (), whose numbers are given at the margin, and their titles () at the top of the pages. There is also another division according to the smaller Ammonian Sections (in Mark 236 Sections, the last in 16:12), without references to the Eusebian Canons. It also contains the Synaxarion and Menologion.  Text  The Greek text of the codex is representative of the Byzantine text-type. Hermann von Soden included it in the textual family Kx. Kurt Aland placed the Greek text of the codex in Category V. According to the Claremont Profile Method it represents the textual family Kx in Luke 1 and Luke 10. In Luke 20 the manuscript is defective, in Luke 1 the manuscript is fragmentary. It lacks the text of Matthew 16:2b–3 (Signs of the times).  History  C. R. Gregory dated the manuscript to the year ca. 1300. Currently the manuscript is dated by the INTF to the year ca. 1300. The name of scribe was Andreas, who copied it at the wish of one John. The manuscript was added to the list of New Testament manuscripts by Scrivener (732e) and Gregory (852e). C. R. Gregory saw it in 1886. The manuscript once belonged to Borgianus.

Taxonomy Pilumnoides inglei was described in 1987 during a revision of the genus Pilumnoides by Danièle Guinot and Enrique Macpherson. It was named after Ray W. Ingle, who worked at the Natural History Museum and wrote the important book British Crabs. Description Although Pilumnoides inglei resembles P. perlatus very closely, the carapace and chelae (claws) of P. inglei are smoother than in P. perlatus. The known adult specimens vary in size from to . Collections The first specimens of Pilumnoides inglei were collected by Rupert Vallentin from a derelict ship in Falmouth Harbour.In 1900, Rupert Vallentin recorded specimens of Pilumnoides on a derelict ship in Falmouth harbour, Cornwall. The ship was the 500-ton Liverpool barque Ruthen, carrying a consignment of guano from the Patagonian island of Lobos (), \\"about mid-way between Montividio [Montevideo] and the Straits of Magellan\\". The ship was severely damaged in a gale off the Isles of Scilly, and was towed to Falmouth, where Vallentin found numerous Pilumnoides crabs among the dense seaweed on the ship's hull. Despite his attempts to introduce a new species to the area, by dispersing crabs about the harbour, the population did not persist. Vallentin sent some of the specimens he had collected to Reginald Innes Pocock at the British Museum (now the Natural History Museum), who identified them as Pilumnoides perlatus. Further specimens were collected by G. W. Dock from the vessel Micfield at Plymouth in 1913. Since 1913, no further specimens have been found. Distribution While the majority of Pilumnoides species occur around the Americas, Pilumnoides inglei is only known from a few specimens collected on the south coast of England. Prior to 1987, specimens of Pilumnoides found in the British Isles had been identified as Pilumnoides perlatus, a species native to the Pacific coasts of South America. These specimens were thought to have been introduced by ships trading between South America and Europe. In their 1987 revision, Guinot and Macpherson separated the English specimens as a new species, and reappraised the hypotheses about its natural range. They concluded that the species had never been found in its natural habitat, but expected that the natural habitat would be located off the coast of England, and in the seas of northern Europe, rather than further afield. Similarly, Guinot and Macpherson described the new species Pilumnoides rubus for specimens from South Africa, which were previously thought to be an introduced population of P. perlatus.

Retrieved 12 June 2012. The phrase was used in the title of the play The Seven Year Itch by George Axelrod, and gained popularity following the 1955 film adaptation starring Marilyn Monroe and Tom Ewell. In his 1913 novel The Eighth Year, Philip Gibbs attributes the concept to the British judge Sir Francis Jeune. The phrase has since expanded to indicate cycles of dissatisfaction not only in interpersonal relationships, but in any situation such as working a full-time job or buying a house, where a decrease in happiness and satisfaction is often seen over long periods of time. Divorce rates The idea of a seven-year itch puts a specific time on the generally observed phenomenon that data sets of married people show a rising, then a falling, risk of divorce over time. However, statistical results from these data sets are very sensitive to the statistical methods used, and such patterns may just reflect the method, rather than any underlying reality. In samples taken from the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics, there proves to be an average median duration of marriage across time. In 1922 the median duration of marriage that ended in divorce was 6.6 years.Ellis, R., & Kreider, R. (2011). Number, Timing, and Duration of Marriages and Divorces:2009. Current Population Reports. Retrieved from https://www.census.gov/prod/2011pubs/p70-125.pdf. In 1974 the median duration was 7.5 years. In 1990 the median duration was 7.2 years. While these can fluctuate from year to year, the averages stay relatively close to the seven year mark.U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (1981).Duration of Marriage Before Divorce.

In the film, a man sends his family off on vacation for the summer while he stays back to work. He begins to fantasize about women that he previously had feelings for, when his new neighbor (Marilyn Monroe) moves in and he decides to try and seduce her. Things go awry and he ends up not going through with it, but he believes that his wife will somehow know that he is trying to be unfaithful.Crowther, B. (n.d.). The Seven-Year-Itch (1955). The New York Times, Retrieved from http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/43862/The-Seven-Year-Itch/overview Whilst the term was originally used for unfavourable conditions of a long duration, the talkie helped to popularize its usage to refer to the decrease of romantic feelings between married couples over time. The phrase has become so popular that some couples use it as an indicator of the lifespan of their marriage, a famous example being a Bavarian politician Gabriele Pauli, who has been divorced twice. She suggests after seven years marriage should end, with the couple required to resay their vows if they wish to continue for another seven years.

He worked mainly in the genre of landscape art and experienced a significant influence of European Impressionism. He painted in oils and watercolors. In his works he often turned to the subject of Ukrainian nature.  Biography  Berkos was born on September 3, 1861 in Odessa. His father Andrey Ignatievich Berkos, a subject of Greece, served in the firm Bellino Fender, his mother Martha Ivanovna came from a Russian noble family. The family lived in their house on Pushkinskaya. Mykhailo Berkos first studied painting in Odessa Drawing School, graduating in 1877. Then he continued his education at the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg, where he studied from 1878 to 1889 in the studio of Mikhail Clodt and Volodymyr Orlovsky. He got a small and large silver medals (1884–1886), a small gold medal for the painting View of one of the oldest parks in St. Petersburg (1887), a gold medal for the painting Landscape. Forest in the swamp (1888). During the holidays he came to Kharkiv with fellow artists and painted landscapes, in particular sketch Full poppies (1885). In 1889 he graduated from the academy with the rank of first degree class artist and the right to travel abroad at public expense (pension). From 1890 to 1893 Berkos as a pensioner of the Academy traveled by Europe, studying art of museums in France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Switzerland. He painted a lot, perfected his technique, was influenced by Impressionism and en plein air painting. After the expiration of the pension Berkos lived in St. Petersburg for some time and presented his paintings at exhibitions of societies of artists. On the khutir. Mala Danylivka (1903), canvas on cardboard, oil, 23,9х33,9 In the second half of the 1890s he moved to Kharkiv. He lived in a suburb of Mala Danylivka with the General's widow Maria Reinicke. There he wrote sketches, among which Greenhouses (1895) and Landscape with a Church (1897) have survived. From 1904 he taught at the school of drawing in Kharkiv. At the initiative of Berkos in 1912 the Kharkiv Art College was opened, where until 1917 he was one of the leading teachers. Berkos put a lot of effort to enrich the collection of the first Museum of Art and Industry in Ukraine. In the early 1900s he worked at the Kharkiv literary and artistic section. As the chairman of the Society of Kharkiv Artists since 1906 he spent a great job of promoting Ukrainian art. In 1907 he participated in the interiors decoration of the Poltava Zemstvo building in the Ukrainian Nouveau style. In 1900 he was exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in Paris. Solo exhibitions of Berkos took place in 1906 and 1908 in Kharkiv, there also was an exhibition of works by Kharkiv artists Serhii Vasylkivsky and Mykhaylo Berkos in 1911 in Kiev. He died of typhus on 20 December 1919 in Kharkiv.  Exhibitions  Capri (1899), wood/oil, 41х34 Works of Berkos were presented at exhibitions-competitions and exhibitions- sales of the Academy of Arts (1890, 1892–1894), St. Petersburg Society of Artists (1894–1903), societies of Russian watercolours (1894–1898, 1900–1905, 1907, 1910, 1914), southern Russian artists, Kharkiv painters (1893, 1894, 1912, 1914–1917), the All-Russia exhibition in Nizhny Novgorod (1896), the Exposition Universelle in Paris (1900). Intravital solo exhibitions of the artist were organised in 1906 and 1908 (Kharkiv Art and Industry Museum), there also was an exhibition of paintings by Serhii Vasylkivsky and Mykhaylo Berkos in 1911 in Kiev. In October 1938 the Kharkiv National Gallery exhibited about 120 paintings created by the artist in the years 1890–1919. Exhibitions of his paintings were also held in the Kharkiv Art Museum in 1962, 1990 and 1996. The exhibition Outstanding Ukrainian landscape masters in 1990 presented 28 paintings and three drawings from the museum and private collections.  Artworks  Apple tree in bloom (1919), wood, oil, 23,5х43,8 Almost all of the works of Berkos which were stored at his home (350 paintings and sketches) after his death were burned by his wife. However, his works have been preserved in museum collections in Kharkiv, Kiev, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Ulyanovsk, Stavropol, Alupka, North Ossetia, Germany, France and Switzerland. The main theme of the artist's art throughout his career was a Ukrainian landscape, the specific features of nature, the nature of vegetation. Berkos loved to paint during blossoming. Village streets with white houses and lush trees, flowering fields of flax and buckwheat were his favorite motifs: paintings Flax in bloom (1893), Buckwheat in bloom (1894), July. Poppies are blooming (1913), Apple tree in bloom (1919). His sketches Full poppies (1885), The Valley, Flax (1893) noted completeness, reasonableness of the composition, the freshness of colour, special refinement. Particularly noteworthy is a small picture of Berkos from the Kharkov Art Museum, 47 x 66 cm in size called \\"Budyaki\\". The picture, like most of the master’s works, captivates one’s eyes, as much life as there is still to be found in these dried weeds! Following the impressionistic principle that “there should be traces of how it was made in the picture,” the master uses a roundish, dotted, dense brushstroke, which creates a flickering, vibrating surface, where sunlight shines through a hot golden under-shadow through a light-air background. In the Russian Museum of St. Petersburg is a vivid work of nature M. Berkosa \\"Stream\\". The size of the painting is 120 by 177 cm, single, oil, year of writing 1889. Landscapes Rome and Sorrento (1899) take the romantic colouring of past times by the reproduction of pure blue sky, bright sunshine, rich color shades of green tall trees, flowing enamel-like painting. Sketch Haven. Amalfi (1899) was depicted in light improvisational manner, it’s an elegant painting, impregnated with a dynamic movement. The colour structure of the landscape Winter (1907), painted in the Poltava region, was designed in blue and white palette with flashes of pink with elaborate decorative. In his landscapes the display of the usual corner, above all Sloboda Ukraine, turns into a generalised image of Ukraine. In his work Street in Uman (1895) the picture of a provincial Ukrainian town, its dusty roads, winding streets, ramshackle houses and domes of the churches were reflected with high authenticity. The world that Berkos conveys sparkles with a stream of sun, light and color. The world that Berkos conveys sparkles with a stream of sun, light and color. He paints his paintings quickly, easily, freely. Each picture has its own coloristic find, discovery. There is a phenomenon called the \\"absolute eye\\" of the artist. Among the \\"seasonal predilections\\" of the master are summer and spring, the period of the lush flowering of everything on earth. With his hedonistic aspirations, the desire to represent the world in its entirety and brightness, the artist is perhaps most attracted to the backgrounds of Renoir and Monet, their bright multicolor. Among the paintings of Mikhail Berkos, you can stroll, as in a flowering garden, flooded with midday light.  Literature  * Енциклопедія українознавства.

The first section between Biebermühle (now Pirmasens Nord station) and Pirmasens connected the city of Pirmasens to the railway network, which could only be achieved via a branch line due to the topography. In 1905, another branch was opened from Biebermühle to Waldfischbach, which was extended in 1913 to Kaiserslautern. It was subsequently used by long-distance services, which operated until 1990. Since then, it has been used only by local services. It is the only one of all the Palatine railway lines that were completed in the 20th century that has never been threatened with closure. History= First aspirations (1864–1867)  The first efforts to create a railway connection from Kaiserslautern to Pirmasens go back to the 1860s. Above all, the municipality Schopp was fiercely committed to a connection. The first proposal from 1864 suggested a route through Vogelweh, Hohenecken, Schopp, Biebermühle and Rodalben. In the following year, a committee, to which representatives from Kaiserslautern, Waldfischbach and Schopp belonged, noted several advantages of such a route. It would benefit Pirmasens with its industry, the transport of timber in the areas of Johanniskreuz, Leimen, Lemberg, Merzalben, Ruppertsweiler, Trippstadt and Waldfischbach, the gravel pits in Heltersberg, Rodalben, Schmalenberg and Waldfischbach and the agriculture of the neighbouring Sickingen Heights and services for visitors to the waterfalls of the region. In 1866, another proposal for a route was put forward, which was largely followed by the current route. Bavaria, which controlled the Circle of the Rhine (Rheinkreis) in which the planned line was located, gave the planned line from Landau to Zweibrücken higher priority. The proposed connection between Kaiserslautern and Pirmasens was not considered by the Ministry of Trade to be useful because of the difficult topography and the thin settlement.  Origins of the Biebermühle–Pirmasens branch line  The town of Pirmasens hoped for a connection to the railway network with the construction of the planned Landau–Zweibrücken line. As it soon became apparent that due to the difficult topography of the Palatinate Forest (Pfälzerwald) and the associated high costs of building a line in this area, it was unlikely that the line could be built through Pirmasens. There were intense discussions in the town. Some members of the town council argued that a branch line would significantly weaken the town. The council therefore continued to favour a direct link via the planned South Palatine Railway (Südpfalzstrecke) between Landau and Zweibrücken. There were two options under discussion. The first would have involved a station built in the Dankelsbach Valley; this would have required careful tunnelling under the town. It was dropped quickly. The second ran further south via Ruppertsweiler with a station near Niedersimten. The Bavarian government, however, favoured the connection by means of a branch line. The majority of the town council finally voted 24:14 in favour of the government's draft plan because a station in the Niedersimten area could not have been regarded as a direct connection and would have meant that a later connection to Kaiserslautern no longer had any chance of being realised. The branch line would branch off from the planned main line in the hamlet of Biebermühle where a junction station was to be built, run mainly along the Steinbach and end on the northern outskirts of Pirmasens at the military training ground. It was opened together with the Annweiler–Zweibrücken section of the main line on 25 November 1875. The operator was the Palatine Ludwig Railway Company (Pfalzische Ludwigsbahn-Gesellschaft), which had already become part of the Palatinate Railways (Pfälzische Eisenbahnen) with its operational merger with the remaining Palatinate railways in 1870. The planning of what was intended to be a single-track line, however, suffered from an error. Due to its very late rise out of the Steinbach Valley, the crest of the line would only be reached at the beginning of the tunnel at the entrance to Pirmasens. As a result, trains that were brought to a halt at the end of the climb or in the tunnel could not be started again. Therefore, Deutsche Reichsbahn later decided to build a second track, which began the climb much earlier—directly at the exit from Biebermühle station—to reach the new tunnel over a gentler and more even gradient. (See also Further developments section )  Connection to Kaiserslautern  Like the South Palatine Railway, the main line to Pirmasens mainly served freight transport. However, the efforts to extend the Pirmasens line to the Kaiserslautern did not end. As early as the 1860s, the district council of Waldfischbach had criticised the planned route of the Landau–Zweibrücken line. In 1872, the Palatine Railway received a request from the city of Kaiserslautern, which related to the planned connection to Pirmasens. Its director, Albert von Jäger replied that the organisation had to deal with so many projects that the line could not be built. Another, also unsuccessful request, was made in 1887. In 1894, a plan was issued on behalf of the mayor's office of Kaiserslautern, with construction costs amounting to 4.4 million marks, of which about one third was for reconstruction of the stations of Kaiserslautern and Biebermühle. A year later this was forwarded to the government in Munich. Jakob von Lavale, the successor of Jäger who had died in the meantime, turned down the proposal. Thereupon a meeting took place in the Kaiserslauter Fruchthalle, which resulted in a protest against this position. This led to several proposals on how to progress the matter. Waldfischbach station (left) in 1916 On 29 May 1900 a law was passed on \\"the development of railways of local importance in the Palatinate\\", which guaranteed railway construction. Two years later a concession was issued for the Biebermühle–Waldfischbach section. After about one year of construction, the corresponding 5.13 kilometre section was opened on 1 June 1904 with only one intervening station at Burgalben. Thus, Biebermühle station became a junction station with four branches. In 1909, the operation of the two lines became part of the Royal Bavarian State Railways (Königlich Bayerischen Staats-Eisenbahnen). The gap was closed on 1 August 1913, when the Waldfischbach–Kaiserslautern section was completed. Further developments Later the Biebermühle–Burgalben section was rebuilt on a new route through the middle of the Schwarzbach valley (Schwarzbachtal) for military reasons. The line was absorbed into Deutsche Reichsbahn on 1 April 1920. In 1922, the line was integrated into the newly founded Reichsbahndirektion Ludwigshafen (railway division of Ludwigshafen). In 1923, the so-called Regiebetrieb (military operation) commenced, which meant that the railway was operated by the French military until the beginning of 1924. In the course of the dissolution of the railway division of Ludwigshafen, the Biebermühl Railway came under the management of Saarbrücken on 1 May 1936. A major reconstruction of Biebermühle station, which has been called Pirmasens Nord since 1938, followed. In addition, it was decided to build a second track a separate route to improve operations between Pirmasens North and the Hauptbahnhof. A total of three options were available. One would have passed through Petersberg and would not have needed a tunnel. The second would have run parallel to the existing line, which it would have crossed shortly before Fehrbach Tunnel and would have then climbed through a 400-metre-long tunnel. The third option, which was finally implemented by the Reichsbahn, ran almost parallel to the old line, but started climbing earlier towards Pirmasens and thus obtained a more even and gentler slope. It has a tunnel that runs parallel to the original one. This was commissioned in 1939; the construction costs amounted to 5.6 million Reichsmarks. After the commissioning, it was used for the operation of the trains running uphill, while the old track was reserved for the downhill trains. In addition, a connecting curve was established north of Pirmasens Nord station, which was subsequently used by direct services running between Zweibrücken and Kaiserslautern over the Biebermühl Railway.  Post-war period and Deutsche Bundesbahn (1945–1993)  At the end of the Second World War, the original valley track (Talgleis) of the southern Pirmasens Nord-Pirmasens Hauptbahnhof section was broken in four places as a result of the fighting. These problems were quickly resolved. There was more damage between Waldfischbach and Steinalben, so that through operations between Pirmasens and Kaiserslautern were not restored until 1946. During the French occupation, the railway line was under the control of the Betriebsvereinigung der Südwestdeutschen Eisenbahnen (Union of south-west German railways, SWDE) which was absorbed into the newly founded Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB) in 1949. The latter integrated the Biebermühl Railway into the railway division of Mainz, which was assigned all railway lines within the newly created state of Rhineland-Palatinate. There was a great increase in passenger traffic. In 1955, the newer mountain track (Berggleis) was re-activated on the southern section of the line, the reconstruction of which had been long delayed. The line became a part of the area of responsibility of the railway division of Trier during the dissolution of the railway division of Mainz on 1 August 1971. Steam operations on the line ended on 25 September 1975. Gelterswoog station was closed two years later. In the 1980s, the closure of the halts of Galgenschanzem Hohenecken, Karlsthal and Burgalben followed. After many lines had been closed throughout the Western Palatinate, DB concluded an agreement with the state of Rhineland- Palatinate, which ensured the continuance of the Biebermühl Railway. At the end of the Cold War, from 1990 onwards, the line lost its importance as a strategic railway, which ultimately mainly depended on the American forces resident in the Pirmasens region.  Deutsche Bahn (since 1994)  In the course of the railway reform, the Biebermühl Railway became part of Deutsche Bahn (DB) in 1994. In the same year, interregional traffic ended on the neighbouring Landau–Rohrbach railway. With a few exceptions, the trains that had run from Pirmasens Nord had since run from the Hauptbahnhof, which meant an increase of services on the southern section of the Biebermühl Railway. On the section between Pirmasens Nord and Pirmasens Hauptbahnhof the older track, the so-called Talgleis, was closed in 1996, although it was not used on a regular basis since the 1960s. Just before the railway reform, its possible reactivation including the costs incurred had been investigated. As part of the railway reform, the Zweckverband Schienenpersonennahverkehr Rheinland- Pfalz Süd (municipal association for rail transport of the southern Palatinate) has been responsible for the route since 1 January 1997. In this context, the Galgenschanze halt was reactivated. The freight yard in Pirmasens was closed in December 1999; it was then dismantled along with its tracks. In 2000, it became part of the Westpfalz-Verkehrsverbund (Western Palatinate Transport Association, WVV), along with the other lines in the Western Palatinate, until it was absorbed into the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Neckar (Rhine-Neckar Transport Association, VRN) six years later. Since 14 December 2008, the line has been part of the so-called Westpfalz-Netz (Western Palatinate network). This meant, for example, that from 7:00 pm all trains have attendants. Kaiserslautern-Hohenecken halt was to have been reactivated on 11 December 2011. Since the city of Kaiserslautern has not yet provided any funds, construction work has been postponed. 2013 was the centenary of the line; there were steam excursions on 15 September of that year. In addition, the reactivation of the valley track between Pirmasens Nord and Pirmasens Hauptbahnhof has been discussed, as the mountain track has reached the limit of its capacity. Route The Biebermühl Railway runs along the western edge of the Palatinate Forest (Pfälzerwald), through the Sickingen Heights (Sickinger Höhe). It is largely surrounded by forest over the whole route. It leaves the Kaiserslauter Hauptbahnhof to the west and runs parallel with the Mannheim-Saarbrücken railway and the Lauter Valley Railway. It leaves both lines and runs south to enter the Hohenecken Forest (Hohenecker Wald). In doing so, it grazes the eastern edge of the districts of Vogelweh and Hohenecken. The late closing of the gap between Kaiserslautern and Waldfischbach had the advantage, from a transport point of view, that the line was designed and built without level crossings with a state route built parallel to the line. Pirmasens Nord station (right) from above, to the left is the hamlet of Biebermühle After it has passed Gelterswoog, it follows the Aschbach to the mouth of the Moosalb at the western end of Karlstal. Shortly before Schopp it crosses federal highway 270 and runs along the Moosalb via Steinalben to Waldfischbach, where they meet the Schwarzbach valley (Schwarzbachtal). The line crosses the Schwarzbach three times before it reaches Pirmasens Nord. Coming from the west, the Landau–Rohrbach railway continues to the east, while the Biebermühl Railway continues to run to the south. The remaining almost seven kilometres of the line is built through relatively steep terrain. Just before the terminal station of Pirmasens Hauptbahnhof, the line passes through the 887 metre-long Neue Fehrbacher Tunnel. In this section of the line, the new track, which was built in the 1930s, is used. It runs on a different elevation and has a more even slope, thus avoiding the steep ascending gradient to the tunnel of the old track. From Kaiserslautern Hauptbahnhof to the abandoned Gelterswoog station the line is located within the boundaries of the urban district of Kaiserslautern and from Karlsthal to Schopp in the district of Kaiserslautern. Between Steinalben and Pirmasens Nord it runs through the district of Südwestpfalz, while the remainder of the line is located on the territory of the city of Pirmasens.  Operations= Passenger services In the first decades most passenger trains ran between Pirmasens and Biebermühle and some of them continued to Zweibrücken. After the opening of the Biebermühle–Waldfischbach section, the two parts were operated as separate sections. After the closing of the gap in 1913, there were seven continuous train pairs, one of which ran over the Donnersberg Railway (Donnersbergbahn) to Mainz and one via the Zeller Valley Railway (Zellertalbahn) to Darmstadt. In addition, there were trains running between Pirmasens and Waldfischbach and between Kaiserslautern and Schopp. Improved performance in the 1930s led to two express train pairs on the Pirmasens–Kaiserslautern–Mainz route, one of them continuing to Frankfurt am Main. Express trains ran through to Darmstadt, Frankfurt and Wiesbaden in the 1960s. During the same period through coaches from Tübingen ran on the line. At the end of the 1990s, the excursion trains ended and from 1991 onwards there were no further through coaches. The last had been running to Dortmund since the end of the 1970s. Since the beginning of the 1990s, the single-track Biebermühl Railway has been operated together with the Alsenz Valley Railway, the Kaiserslautern–Enkenbach railway and the Bingen–Bad Münster section of the Nahe Valley Railway under time table number 672. There were continuous connections between Bingen and Pirmasens from 1990 to 2008. The trains usually cross in Waldfischbach at the symmetry minute shortly before the full hour. The journeys between Pirmasens Hauptbahnhof and Kaiserslautern are designated by the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Neckar as line R65 and those between the two Pirmasens stations are designated R55 (Landau–Pirmasens) and R68 (Saarbrücken–Pirmasens).  Freight traffic The original Biebermühle–Pirmasens branch line was mainly used for freight traffic at first. Between Biebermühle and Kaiserslautern, the line was mainly used for the transport of timber. After the electrification of the Mannheim–Saarbrücken railway, freight traffic on the Biebermühl Railway quickly declined, as did freight traffic to Pirmasens. The service was carried out in the form of local freight trains from Einsiedlerhof marshalling yard. The gradient on the line south of Pirmasens Nord required the returning freight trains to brake shortly before leaving Pirmasens Hauptbahnhof. In addition, operations on the loading track in Steinalben required the blocking of traffic on the Schopp–Waldfischbach section. In freight transport, which was discontinued in 2005, Pirmasens Nord station served as a distribution station for freight trains, which were divided into several individual trains. One served Pirmasens, another the railway stations between Kaiserslautern and Pirmasens Nord. In addition, from the 1970s, a train served the stations on the Hauenstein–Zweibrücken section of the Landau–Rohrbach railway from Pirmasens Nord. Rolling stock= Steam locomotives  The Kaiserslautern locomotive depot was primarily responsible for the steam locomotives, and later some of the locomotives were based at the Zweibrücken depot. The Palatine Railway operated tender locomotives with five coupled axles of the T 5 class, built by Fa. Krauss & Co., especially for use with the heavy freight trains on the steep climb to Pirmasens; these were designated by Deutsche Reichsbahn as class 940. Nevertheless, the latter decided to sell them in 1926 and thus before they were redesignated. Class T 1 locomotives originally operated between Biebermühle and Waldfischbach. The opening train between Kaiserslautern and Pirmasens on 1 August 1913 was hauled by Locomotive Rehweiler. Subsequently, Prussian class T 14.1 tender locomotives were mainly used as substitutes on traffic between Biebermühle and Pirmasens. For a short time until 1946 they were replaced by class T 20 locomotives, reclassified as DRG Class 95, based in Zweibrücken; afterwards the latter locomotives were placed on the Geislinger Steige on the Fils Valley Railway. In 1939 they returned to handle the Pirmasens Nord–Pirmasens Hbf section as part of the Roten (red) Zone (the militarised zone near the French border). They were temporarily sent back to Geislingen after the invasion of France, but returned a year later until the end of the Second World War. Otherwise Prussian and Palatine steam locomotives dominated freight traffic. Passenger services in the early years were mostly hauled by locomotives of classes Prussian P 8 and Prussian T 18 and later by classes 38 and 78. DRG Class 71.0 locomotives were also operated between Pirmasens Nord and Kaiserslautern. After the Second World War, locomotives of classes 50 and 86 were mainly used for freight traffic.  Diesel rolling stock From the 1950s until about 1990, most passenger services on the Biebermühl Railway were operated with railbuses of classes VT 95 and VT 98. From 1990, passenger services were operated by new class 628 two-car diesel multiple units. They last ran between Pirmasens Nord and Kaiserslautern in 1981. Further south, they ran from Landau for another decade, before they disappeared there as well in 1993. Occasionally, battery electric multiple units of class 515 based in the Worms locomotive depot were also found on the Biebermühl Railway. The steam locomotives were replaced from the 1960s by diesel locomotives of the classes V 100, V 60, 218 and V 200. The latter hauled services on the Pirmasens–Frankfurt route. From 1990, passenger services were operated by new class 6282 diesel multiple units. The line is now operated by class 643 (Bombardier Talent) or 642 (Siemens Desiro) diesel multiple units. Operating points Kaiserslautern Hauptbahnhof  Kaiserslautern Hauptbahnhof  Kaiserslauten Hauptbahnhof was opened on 1 July 1848, with the Homburg–Kaiserslautern section of the Palatine Ludwig Railway (Pfälzische Ludwigsbahn). Not until half a year later was the line extended to Frankenstein, making the line from Rheinschanze to Bexbach operable throughout. In the succeeding decades this developed into the Mannheim–Saarbrücken railway. In spite of its importance, it did not become a railway junction until 1875 with the opening of the Kaiserslautern–Enkenbach railway, which served as a connection to the Alsenz Valley Railway and the Donnersberg Railway (Donnersbergbahn). It received a new entrance building in 1879. In addition, the station gained in importance with the opening of the Lauter Valley Railway in 1883 and the completion of the Biebermühl Railway in 1913. It has bicycle parking spaces, lockers, a shop with travel supplies, a DB Mobilitätsservice (support for the disabled), bus connections, barrier-free access and a DB information centre.  Kaiserslautern-Galgenschanze  The Haltepunkt (halt) of Kaiserslautern-Galgenschanze follows almost immediately after the branch from the Mannheim–Saarbrücken railway and serves the suburb of Galgenschanze on the eastern edge of Kaiserslautern. It was abandoned in the mid-1980s, but was re-activated a decade later.  Hohenecken  Hohenecken station served the Hohenecken district of Kaiserslauter and was located at the southern edge of the settlement. In addition, it had a crossing loop, which had since been dismantled. In the 1980s, it was abandoned due to lack of traffic. In June 2011, it was announced a new halt would be opened under the name of Kaiserslautern-Hohenecken.  Gelterswoog  The halt of Gelterswoog, in the area of Gelterswoog—still in the city of Kaiserslautern—was used exclusively for recreational traffic. It was opened on 28 August 1928. During the summer of 1950, it was reclassified as a halt. It was subsequently abandoned in 1977 due to low patronage.  Karlst(h)al  The halt of Karlsthal was situated in the municipality of Stelzenberg. Like the halt in Gelterswoog, it was primarily used for recreational traffic, in this case to the nature reserve in the nearby Karlstal, which is immediately adjacent to the east. It has also been abandoned, but tour groups can still use it on request.  Schopp  Schopp station Schopp station is located on the north-western edge of the built-up area of the municipality of Schopp. At its opening, it had signals and a crossing loop. It is the only station between Kaiserslautern and Waldfischbach with a crossing loop. Its entrance building, which was built in a traditional style with a hip roof and an open waiting area, dates back to around 1910 and is heritage listed. In the building itself is a mechanical signal box – officially abbreviated Sf – that was built to a unified design and was put into operation on 1 January 1954, replacing an external signal box. The former loading track in the station has been dismantled in the meantime.  Steinalben  The former station of Steinalben is located on the northern outskirts of Steinalben. It has since been reclassified as a halt. The district (Landkreis) of Südwestpfalz has decided to rebuild the halt in a central location. In addition, it is to be provided with a bus station and a commuter car park.  Waldfischbach  Waldfischbach station is located on the north-western edge of Waldfischbach. Like its counterpart in Schopp, it has a crossing loop and an entrance building. The latter, however, is no longer used for railway operations and has been owned by Heimbetriebsgesellschaft Pfalzblick since 1 September 2007. It has a mechanical signal box (designated as Wf) that is still in operation; it was built in 1955 and is staffed by a train dispatcher.  Burgalben  The halt of Burgalben was abandoned in the 1980s because of low traffic volumes. There are attempts in the political domain to reactivate it.  Pirmasens Nord  Trains in Pirmasens Nord station Pirmasens Nord station, which is on the territory of the municipalities of Donsieders, Rodalben and Thaleischweiler-Fröschen, has always had the greatest importance of all the intermediate stations despite its peripheral location. This was mainly a result of the fact that a direct east-west link to the city of Pirmasens failed because of the difficult topographical conditions. For this reason, this station was erected a few kilometres north of Pirmasens at the junction with today's section of the Biermühl Railway to Pirmasens. It therefore acts mainly as a transfer station. The connection to Kaiserslautern was established from 1904 to 1913. In the first decades of its existence, it was named Biebermühle after a village to its east in the municipality of Dorsieders. It is still commonly called Biebermühle. It was not until 1938 that it was given the name Pirmasens Nord, although it was never at any time in the territory of Pirmasens. It was modified in the 1930s for military reasons; the entrance building, which had been opened in 1904 with the opening of the Biebermühl Railway section to Waldfischbach on an island surrounded by rail tracks, was replaced by a new one on the eastern side of the tracks. Over the last few decades, it has served as a distribution station for freight trains that ran from the Einsiedlerhof marshalling yard to Pirmasens Nord; they were broken up into several trains serving the stations between Hauenstein and Zweibrücken on the Landau–Rohrbach railway and those on the Biebermühl Railway.  Pirmasens Hauptbahnhof  Pirmasens Hbf Pirmasens Hbf, 1993 Pirmasens Hauptbahnhof is located about one kilometre north of central Pirmasens. Despite its name, it has always been the only station in the town. Around the turn of the century, the station was rebuilt as it was rundown. It received, among other things, a new entrance building. Pirmasens station was officially renamed Pirmasens Hauptbahnhof (main station) from Pirmasens Bahnhof (station) in 1907. In April 1941, it also received a locomotive depot with a coal loading facility, which was administered as a branch of the Kaiserslauten locomotive depot. Since it was badly damaged during the war, it was rebuilt from the 1950s onwards. Since the 1980s, its importance has steadily declined. Over this period, freight transport declined and was finally abandoned. The station was rebuilt around the turn of the millennium and the number of platforms was reduced to three. This work was officially completed on 22 November 2002.  Accidents In August 1980, due to the erosion of an embankment, diesel locomotive 218 384 derailed and crashed into the Moosalb near Schopp. Notes References   External links  * Railway lines in Rhineland- Palatinate Western Palatinate Railway lines opened in 1875 1875 establishments in Bavaria Buildings and structures in the Palatinate Forest Buildings and structures in Kaiserslautern (district) Buildings and structures in Südwestpfalz Buildings and structures in Pirmasens ","title":"Biebermühl Railway"},{"id":"36116183","text":"Euphaedra janetta, the Janetta Themis forester, is a butterfly in the family Nymphalidae.

The manuscript has survived in complete condition. It contains additional non- biblical matter. There is no marginalia.  Description  The codex contains the text of the four Gospels and the Book of Acts on 334 parchment leaves (size ). The original part of the codex with the text of Matthew 1:1-6:1 (folios 1-9) was lost. It was supplied by a later hand on paper. The text is written in one column per page, 23 lines per page. It has additional non- biblical material by John Chrysostom and Gregory of Nazianzus (On Pascha) at the end of the codex.  Text  The Greek text of the codex is a representative of the Byzantine text-type. Hermann von Soden included it to the textual family Kx (standard Byzantine text). Kurt Aland placed the text of the codex in Category V. According to the Claremont Profile Method it represents the textual family Kx in Luke 1, Luke 10, and Luke 20. It lacks the spurious texts of Matthew 16:2b–3 (Signs of the times) and the Pericope Adulterae (John 7:53-8:11). The text of Matthew 16:2b-3 was added by a later hand in the margin.  History  * C. R.

The term is most often used in the context of bioburden testing, also known as microbial limit testing, which is performed on pharmaceutical products and medical products for quality control purposes. Products or components used in the pharmaceutical or medical field require control of microbial levels during processing and handling. Bioburden or microbial limit testing on these products proves that these requirements have been met. Bioburden testing for medical devices made or used in the USA is governed by Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations and worldwide by ISO 11737. The aim of bioburden testing is to measure the total number of viable micro-organisms (total microbial count) on a medical device prior to its final sterilization before implantation or use. 21 C.F.R. 211.110 (a)(6) states that bioburden in-process testing must be conducted pursuant to written procedures during the manufacturing process of drug products.21 C.F.R. 211.110 (a) (6) The United States Pharmacopeia (USP) outlines several tests that can be done to quantitatively determine the bioburden of non-sterile drug products. It is important when conducting these tests to ensure that the testing method does not either introduce bacteria into the test sample or kill bacteria in the test sample.USP 31 <61> Microbiological Examination. https://www.uspnf.com/sites/default/files/usp_pdf/EN/USPNF/generalChapter61.pdf To prepare drug products for testing, they must be dissolved in certain substances based on their \\"physical characteristics.\\" For example, a water- soluble drug product should be dissolved in \\"Buffered Sodium Chloride-Peptone Solution pH 7.0, Phosphate Buffer Solution pH 7.2, or Soybean-Casein Digest Broth.\\" The Membrane-Filtration Method and Plate Count Method can be used to measure the number of microbes in a sample. In the Membrane-Filtration Method, the sample is passed through a membrane filter with a pore size of 0.45 micrometers or less. The membrane filter is then placed onto Soybean-Casein Digest Agar and incubated in order to be able to determine the total aerobic microbial count (TAMC). In the Plate Count Method, the sample of drug product to be tested and Soybean-Casein Digest Broth is poured into a Petri dish. The Petri dish is then incubated. The most probable number method (MPN) can also be performed for products considered to have a low bioburden. The MPN is considered to be one of the least accurate tests. The bioburden quantification is expressed in colony forming unit (CFU). There are generally established guidelines for the maximum CFU that a drug product can contain. Contact plates or sterile swabs can also be used to test for microbes on a surface when compounding sterile products to ensure compliance with USP 797.PathCon Laboratories. http://www.pathcon.com/documents/MB_USP_797.pdf Bioburden is also associated with biofouling, where microbes collect on the surface of a device or inside of fan cooled equipment. In healthcare settings, this increases the risk of Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) or Hospital- acquired infection as pathogens can be spread through contact or through the air to new patients and hospital staff. Fan cooled system are generally avoided in critical care and operating rooms, thus relying on natural convection or liquid cooling to cool devices and equipment. Clean rooms (surgical operating rooms, for example) are also required to maintain positive air pressure so that air may leave those rooms, but contaminated air cannot enter from adjacent spaces. HEPA filters are also used to collect airborne pathogens larger than 0.3 microns.

His father was Sergeant of the Pastry and died on 18 May 1649. Wood was Clerk of the Spicery in the Royal Household. He purchased the estate of Loudham Park in Ufford and other lands in Suffolk, producing \\"a rental of nearly £4,500 a year\\". George Edward Cokayne Complete Baronetage, Volume 3 1900 He was the brother of Thomas Wood, later Bishop of Lichfield. Wood attended the King's court at Oxford in 1643, during the First English Civil War, and was knighted there on 16 April 1644. In that year he accompanied the Queen, Henrietta Maria, to France, as Treasurer of her Household, an office he retained till his death. He compounded on 31 May 1649 and was fined £273 by Cromwell's authority on 15 June 1649. In about 1657 he was created a baronet by Charles II, when in exile. At the Restoration he was appointed as Clerk of the Green Cloth. He attended Queen Catharine on her voyage from Lisbon in 1661, and was subsequently a member of her Council. In 1661, he was elected one of the Members of Parliament for Hythe. Wood died at the age of about 73, when the Baronetcy became extinct. He was buried at Ufford on 31 May 1671. Wood married firstly in about 1630 Anne Webb, probably a sister of Anthony Webb, Warden of the Merchant Taylors' Company from 1658 to 1660. She died without issue while they were in France following the English Civil War and was buried at Charenton, near Paris, on 9 June 1648. He married secondly, at Paris in November 1651, Mary Gardiner, a daughter of the Royalist Sir Thomas Gardiner, of Cuddesdon, Oxfordshire, and his wife Rebecca Childe. Maid of Honour to Queen Henrietta Maria and one of the four Dressers to Queen Catharine, she died of smallpox aged 38 on 17 March 1671 and was buried in Westminster Abbey on 1 April 1671. In 1670 Wood's daughter Mary, then aged seven and the heiress to his substantial fortune, was betrothed to Charles FitzRoy, Earl of Southampton, an illegitimate son of Charles II and Barbara Villiers. Following her father's death in 1671, Mary went to live with Barbara Villiers, and in 1679 the marriage took place and she became Duchess of Southampton, but in 1680 she died, like her mother, of smallpox, when she was scarcely seventeen, and was buried with her mother in Westminster Abbey.

In Germany the approach of circular flow land use management has been developed and tested by the German Institute for Urban Affairs (Deutsches Institut für Urbanistik) on behalf of the German Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Affairs (BMVBS) and German Federal Office for Building and Regional Planning (BBR).  Concept of Land Use  The concept of circular flow land use management can be described with the slogan “reduce - recycle – avoid”. To create sustainable land uses, actions have to be supported to find new innovative ways to “reduce” the consumption of land by new development “recycle” or put back into use abandoned and derelict sites, and “avoid” future land use decisions that are not sustainable. The concept puts a high value upon the development of inner districts through infill measures.http://www.circuse.eu/images/NaszePliki/Downloads/review_2.4.3_CircUse_Strategy_final.pdf This approach takes into consideration issues related to urban sprawl, urban planning, brownfield land, and land use planning. The concept was developed by the German Institute for Urban Affairs (Difu) and the Federal Office for Building and Regional Planning (BBR) between 2003 and 2007 during the ExWoSt research field “circular land use management in cities and urban regions” (Kreislaufwirtschaft in der städtischen/stadtregionalen Flächennuntzung -. Fläche im Kreis)  Practical Application  To incorporate the circular flow land use management concept into the practice of city planning in Central Europe, the project “Circular Flow Land Use Management (CircUse)” was initiated by the European Union Central Europe organization as well as co- financed by the European Regional Development Fund. The CircUse project involves 12 partner organizations and 3 associated organizations in the six countries of Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Poland and Slovakia. The lead organization is the Institute for the Ecology of Urban Areas (IETU), located in Katowice, Poland.http://www.circuse.eu The main core outputs of the CircUse project will be: * A Circular Flow Land Use Management Strategy * Position paper on existing and new instruments * Separate training materials for professionals and school children * Management structures (one newly formed and another modified from its previous form) that incorporate the CircUse principles * Developed action plans for six pilot regions * A land management data tool available as a software package * A compendium summarizing the entire project  Timeframe  The CircUse project was initiated in March 2010 and is scheduled to run until the end of February 2013.  Similar Projects  CircUse also builds on the experiences the German \\"ExWoSt Research Field: Circular land use management in cities and urban regions” (ExWoSt Themafeld: Kreislaufwirtschaft in der städtischen/stadtregionalen Flächennutzung) http://www.flaeche-im-kreis.de/ and the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) Research Programme \\"Research for the Reduction of Land Consumption and for Sustainable Land Management\\" (Forschung für die Reduzierung der Flächeninanspruchnahme und ein nachhaltiges Flächenmanagement). Similar projects carried out by other organizations include the European Union PLUREL project.http://www.plurel.net/  References External links * Project Website * Project Results * REFINA Project * PLUREL Project Further reading * Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Affairs (BMVBS), Federal Office for Building and Regional Planning (BBR) (published by.)

It is one of three oxides of polonium, the other two being polonium monoxide (PoO) and polonium trioxide (PoO3). It is a pale yellow crystalline solid at room temperature. Under lowered pressure (such as a vacuum), it decomposes into elemental polonium and oxygen at 500 °C. It is the most stable oxide of polonium and is an interchalcogen. Structure and appearance At room temperature, polonium dioxide has a face-centered cubic (fluorite) crystal structure; upon heating to high temperatures, it crystallises in the tetragonal crystal system. The cubic form is pale yellow, while the tetragonal form is red. Polonium dioxide darkens upon heating, and is chocolate brown at its sublimation point, 885 °C. The ionic radius of the ion is 1.02 or 1.04 Å; thus, the ratio of the ionic radii / is about 0.73, the lower limit of stability for the cubic crystal system, allowing polonium dioxide to have two modifications. When freshly prepared, polonium dioxide is always in the tetragonal form, and changes to the cubic form after being left to stand or after being cooled strongly. Occurrence Polonium dioxide does not occur naturally due to the scarcity of polonium in nature and the high temperatures (250 °C) required to form the dioxide. Preparation Polonium dioxide is prepared by reacting elemental polonium with oxygen at 250 °C or by thermal decomposition of polonium(IV) hydroxide (PoO(OH)2), polonium disulfate (Po(SO4)2), polonium selenate (Po(SeO4)2), or polonium tetranitrate (Po(NO3)4). Chemistry When placed in hydrogen, polonium dioxide is slowly reduced to metallic polonium at 200 °C; the same reduction occurs at 250 °C in ammonia or hydrogen sulfide. When heated in sulfur dioxide at 250 °C, a white compound is formed, possibly a polonium sulfite. When polonium dioxide is hydrated, polonous acid (H2PoO3), a pale yellow, voluminous precipitate, is formed. Despite its name, polonous acid is an amphoteric compound, reacting with both acids and bases. Halogenation of polonium dioxide with the hydrogen halides yields the polonium tetrahalides: :PoO2 \\\\+ 4 HF → PoF4 \\\\+ 2 H2O :PoO2 \\\\+ 4 HCl → PoCl4 \\\\+ 2 H2O :PoO2 \\\\+ 4 HBr → PoBr4 \\\\+ 2 H2O :PoO2 \\\\+ 4 HI → PoI4 \\\\+ 2 H2O In reactions, polonium dioxide behaves very much like its homologue tellurium dioxide, forming Po(IV) salts; however, the acidic character of the chalcogen oxides decreases going down the group, and polonium dioxide and polonium(IV) hydroxide are much less acidic than their lighter homologues. For example, SO2, SO3, SeO2, SeO3 and TeO3 are acidic, but TeO2 is amphoteric, and PoO2, while amphoteric, even shows some basic character. The reaction of polonium dioxide with potassium hydroxide or potassium nitrate in air gives the colourless potassium polonite (K2PoO3): :PoO2 \\\\+ 2 KOH → K2PoO3 \\\\+ H2O :PoO2 \\\\+ 2 KNO3 → K2PoO3 \\\\+ 2 NO Polonium dioxide is closely related to the polonite anion (), similar to the relationship between polonium trioxide and the polonate anion (). Applications Polonium dioxide has no uses outside of basic research. Precautions All polonium compounds, such as polonium dioxide, are extremely radioactive and thus must be handled in a glove box. The glove box must further be enclosed in another box similar to the glove box, maintained at a slightly lower pressure than the glove box to prevent the radioactive materials from leaking out. Gloves made of natural rubber do not provide sufficient protection against the radiation from polonium; surgical gloves are necessary. Neoprene gloves shield radiation from polonium better than natural rubber.

The earliest reference to the arms seems to be in the work of the bard Lewys Glyn Cothi from the period of 1447 to 1486 although there is no evident explanation for the choice of colours or charges used. A late c. 15th-century stained-glass window with the arms referring to Hwfa are apparently depicted in the east window of Llangadwaladr church on the island. According to the heraldic historian Wilfrid Scott-Giles, Anglesey County Council used the Hwfa arms informally before they were incorporated into the design granted to them officially. Between 1857 and 1950 the arms were used by Anglesey Constabulary. An association between the Hwfa arms and the island county of Anglesey is thus long established.

It was introduced two centuries ago. Though it is a symbol of honour, the use of the pagadi has changed over the years and now it is also used on traditional days in colleges. To preserve the identity of the pagadi, there were demands from the locals to grant it a Geographical Indication (GI) status. Their demand was fulfilled and the pagadi became an intellectual property on 4 September 2009. History Turban fitters of Pune, 1890 The pagadi was introduced in the 19th century by Mahadev Govind Ranade, a social reformer. Later, it was worn by many leaders like Lokmanya Tilak, J.S. Karandikar, D.D. Sathye, Dr. Vitthalrao Gade, Tatyasaheb Kelkar and Datto Vaman Potdar. The pagadi became more popular in 1973 after the Marathi play, Ghashiram Kotwal. Usage The pagadi is used mostly on special occasions like wedding ceremonies and traditional days in schools and colleges. Youngsters wear it while performing the gondhal art form. The pagadi, being a symbol of honour, is also used as a souvenir. It also finds usage in period films and theatres. Granting of intellectual property right The 10-membered Shree Puneri Pagadi Sangh had applied before the Geographical Indication Registry to get a Geographical Indication (GI) tag for the pagadi. Great Mission Group Consultancy, which promotes intellectual property rights filed the application on behalf of them. The aim was to make the pagadi recognizable, preserve its identity and also that of the Puneri culture. Consequently, on 4 September 2009, the Geographical Indication status was given to the headgear and the pagadi became the official cultural identity of Pune. Thus, the pagadi got the Intellectual Property Right (IPR) and selling of any turban made outside Pune, under the name of Puneri pagadi became illegal. Along with the Puneri pagadi, IPR has been previously issued to Indian products like Darjeeling tea, Banarasi saris, Tirupati ladoos, among others.

He is also responsible for the development and international deployment of the Just for Laughs/Juste pour Rire brand in over 150 countries. The Just for Laughs festival is considered the largest comedy festival in the world. Early life and education Gilbert Rozon is the eldest of seven children. Raised in Saint-André d'Argenteuil, he began working at a young age as a paperboy. At the age of 14 he became a gravedigger, salesman, printer, show organizer, publisher of telephone directories business, key to real estate, etc. It is in this context from his work experience that he developed his sense of humour. After a short stay in France at age 20, he studied law at the Université de Montréal where he graduated. Career In 1980, he founded the La Grande Virée () festival in Lachute which welcomed more than 60,000 spectators in its first year and more than 80,000 in 1981. For its third year, Gilbert Rozon moved La Grande Virée to the Pointe-aux-Trembles neighbourhood in Montreal. It was a failure. Despite the failure of his first festival in Montreal, Rozon borrowed more than C$1 million to found the Just for Laughs festival in 1983. The festival was based in Montreal, although spread to Toronto, Chicago, Nantes and Paris. Rozon was the impresario of Charles Trenet until his death. He was the producer of shows featuring Laurent Ruquier, Franck Dubosc, Dieudonné M'bala M'bala, Florence Foresti, Arturo Brachetti, Stéphane Rousseau, Jean-Marc Parent, Jean-Luc Lemoine, Rachid Badouri, André Sauvé, Christophe Alévêque, etc. Just for Laughs represents over 75 artists, over 200 hours of television broadcast in over 150 countries each year and hundreds of shows a year. For 25 years, Gilbert Rozon has been at the helm of the festival before giving way to Alain Cousineau with whom he founded the festival in 1983. He remains chairman and CEO of the group. Starting in 2006, he became a member of the jury on the French program, La France a un incroyable talent. Controversy In 1998, Gilbert Rozon received an unconditional discharge from the Quebec Superior Court after pleading and being found guilty of a sexual assault on a 19-year-old woman, because a criminal record would have made it difficult for him to travel internationally for his work. He was also accused of unlawful confinement of a 31-year-old woman but the charge was withdrawn by the police for lack of evidence. Groups of women expressed anger over sentencing they considered as being too lenient. On October 18, 2017, Rozon announced he was resigning from his position as the President of Just for Laughs as well as the vice-president of the Montreal Metropolitan Board of Trade, amid allegations of sexual misconduct.

The Falkland Islanders were asked whether or not they supported the continuation of their status as an Overseas Territory of the United Kingdom in view of Argentina's call for negotiations on the islands' sovereignty. On a turnout of 92%, 99.8% voted to remain a British territory, with only three votes against.Falklands referendum: Voters choose to remain UK territory BBC News, 12 March 2013 Had the islanders rejected the continuation of their current status, a second referendum on possible alternatives would have been held. Brad Smith, the leader of the international observer group, announced that the referendum was free and fair and executed in accordance with international standards and international laws. History= Background  Negotiations over the sovereignty of the islands took place between Argentina and the United Kingdom in the 1960s and 1970s, but no agreement was ever reached. In 1982 the Argentine military junta, which ruled Argentina at the time, invaded and occupied the islands, beginning the Falklands War at the end of which the islands came back under British control. Since the war, Argentina has continued to call for the resumption of negotiations, but the United Kingdom refuses such requests, stating that the Falkland Islanders have the right to self-determination. On the fourth anniversary of the start of the war, the Falkland Islands Association and the Marplan Institute conducted the Falkland Island Sovereignty Survey of all registered voters on the islands, the result of which showed that 96.45% of the islanders supported remaining a British territory.Falkland Islands, 2 April 1986: Status Direct Democracy Eight years later, in an Argentine- inspired poll, 87% of the islanders rejected any form of discussion of sovereignty in any circumstances, preferring to remain British. Recent tensions  Tensions over the status of the islands began to increase with approach of the 30th anniversary of the Falklands war and the decision of the Falkland Islands government to start oil exploration in Falklands territorial waters. This led to the government of Argentina banning Falklands flagged ships and vessels linked to the Falklands' oil industry from docking at Argentine ports. The Argentine government also began a diplomatic campaign, calling on several international groups to support the resumption of negotiations, gaining support from organisations such as the Union of South American Nations and the Rio Group. In 2011 the Argentine Defence minister, Arturo Puricelli, stated that the Falkland Islanders were kept as \\"hostages\\" on the islands and later suggested that the British military \\"is the only element that upholds the usurpation of that part of our national territory\\". This led to the Governor of the Falkland Islands, Nigel Haywood, proposing a referendum to see whether islanders want to remain British or not \\"so we can solve the issue once and for all\\". Announcement and responses On 12 June 2012, Gavin Short, a Member of the Falkland Islands Legislative Assembly, announced the intention of the Falkland Islands Government to hold a referendum in the first half of 2013, saying that: He made the announcement during a visit to the islands by Foreign Office Minister Jeremy Browne to mark the 30th anniversary of the Falklands War. Browne supported the holding of the referendum, calling it a \\"truly significant moment\\", saying that \\"It will give the Falkland Islands people the opportunity to send a clear message... that the Islanders, and they alone are masters of their fate.\\" British Prime Minister David Cameron said that his Government supported the holding of the referendum and would \\"respect and defend\\" the result. The Argentine government said the outcome of the referendum would not affect the country's claim to the islands. Daniel Filmus, chairman of the Argentine Senate Foreign Affairs committee, said it \\"does not change at all the Argentine position\\", while Guillermo Carmona, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of Argentina's Chamber of Deputies, said \\"This has no value at all since Argentina rejects the possibility of self-determination for an implanted population, such as the implanted British population in the Malvinas\\". At the 2012 G-20 Mexico summit Cameron confronted Argentine President Christina Fernandez de Kirchner and called on her to respect the referendum, while she said that the issue should be resolved in line with United Nations General Assembly resolution 40/21 November 1985. President Kirchner had earlier refused an invitation from the Falkland Islands Government to speak with a delegation of islanders. On 28 November 2012, it was reported that Argentina had launched a campaign to \\"undermine the legitimacy\\" of the referendum. This consisted of dissuading British politicians from acting as observers in the referendum, and sending two diplomats on a tour of the Caribbean and Africa to argue for Argentina's claim to the islands and convince governments of the \\"inconvenience\\" of sending observers to monitor the referendum. During a visit to London on 6 February 2013 the Argentine Foreign minister, Hector Timerman, claimed that the Falkland Islanders \\"do not exist\\" as such, they are British citizens in disputed islands. Referendum details The current political status of the Falkland Islands is that of an Overseas Territory of the United Kingdom. The Islands are internally self-governing, with the United Kingdom being responsible for defence and foreign affairs. Under Chapter 1 of the Falkland Islands Constitution, the people of the Falkland Islands have the right to self-determination. The referendum was called following Argentina's calls for negotiations over the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands and was undertaken to consult the people regarding their views on the political status of the Falkland Islands. The final wording of the question was proposed by the Legislative Assembly in October 2012 and adopted by the Executive Council on 21 November 2012. The question posed by the referendum was: In order to vote in the referendum, electors had to be resident in the islands, aged 18 or over and have Falkland Islands status. According to the 2012 census, 11% of the electorate were not born in either the Falkland Islands or the UK; this included 13 Argentine-born electors. Polls were open from 10:00 to 18:00 FKST (UTC−3) on Sunday 10 and Monday 11 March 2013 in the two constituencies of the islands (Stanley and Camp). Observers Following the announcement of the referendum, British Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Jeremy Browne, said that the Falkland Islands Government would invite independent international observers to verify the outcome of the referendum. The Referendum International Observation Mission during the referendum was led by Brad Smith from the United States and included representatives from Canada, Mexico, Uruguay, Paraguay, Chile and New Zealand. Following the declaration of the results, Smith announced \\"the international observation mission has concluded that the voting process was executed in accordance with international standards and local laws. The process was technically sound, with a systematic adherence to established voting procedures... It is our finding that the Falkland Islands referendum process was free and fair, reflecting the democratic will of the voters of the Falkland Islands.\\" Results The results were announced by Keith Padgett, the Chief Executive of the Falkland Islands, at 22:40 FKST (UTC−3), in Stanley Town Hall. The high vote to remain a British territory was widely expected, with even the small Argentine population on the islands saying they would vote 'Yes'. Several commentators, including the BBC's correspondent Caroline Wyatt, had anticipated a fairly large 'No' vote from islanders who wanted a second referendum on independence. However, out of the 1,518 ballots cast, only three voters were against keeping the islands' current status. Turnout was over 90% with 1,650 islanders eligible to vote in a population of 2,841. It is possible that at least one of the three people that voted 'No' did so out of a desire for full independence. There was one blank and one invalid votes each, the latter coming from a voter who both ticked the Yes box and crossed the No one. Despite recognizing the intent for a yes vote, the officials considered it invalid, as the rules written directly above on the ballot clearly forbade making signs in both boxes. Around twenty to thirty \\"doubtful\\" votes with signs others than ticks or crosses in the yes box were examined during the count, and deemed valid yes votes. Shortly after the vote was announced several islanders gathered in Victory Green, in the centre of Stanley, to celebrate the result. Reactions Following the declaration, British Prime Minister David Cameron said \\"the Falkland Islanders have spoken so clearly about their future, and now other countries right across the world, I hope, will respect and revere this very, very clear result.\\" Argentine President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner rejected the result and described the referendum as a \\"parody\\", saying \\"It is as if a consortium of squatters had voted on whether to continue illegally occupying a building.\\" On 18 April 2013, U.S. Congressman Mario Díaz-Balart introduced a resolution to the United States House of Representatives calling on the United States Government to officially recognise the referendum result. The resolution was cosponsored by 18 Republican and 7 Democratic members of the House and was referred to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs without a vote.

Wilhelm Wirtinger observed that the complements of knots in 3-space have fundamental groups with presentations of this form. Preliminaries and definition A knot K is an embedding of the one-sphere S1 in three-dimensional space R3. (Alternatively, the ambient space can also be taken to be the three-sphere S3, which does not make a difference for the purposes of the Wirtinger presentation.) The open subspace which is the complement of the knot, S^3 \\\\setminus K is the knot complement. Its fundamental group \\\\pi_1(S^3 \\\\setminus K) is an invariant of the knot in the sense that equivalent knots have isomorphic knot groups. It is therefore interesting to understand this group in an accessible way. A Wirtinger presentation is derived from a regular projection of an oriented knot. Such a projection can be pictured as a finite number of (oriented) arcs in the plane, separated by the crossings of the projection. The fundamental group is generated by loops winding around each arc. Each crossing gives rise to a certain relation among the generators corresponding to the arcs meeting at the crossing.  Wirtinger presentations of high-dimensional knots  More generally, co-dimension two knots in spheres are known to have Wirtinger presentations. Michel Kervaire proved that an abstract group is the fundamental group of a knot exterior (in a perhaps high-dimensional sphere) if and only if all the following conditions are satisfied: # The abelianization of the group is the integers. # The 2nd homology of the group is trivial. # The group is finitely presented. # The group is the normal closure of a single generator. Conditions (3) and (4) are essentially the Wirtinger presentation condition, restated. Kervaire proved in dimensions 5 and larger that the above conditions are necessary and sufficient. Characterizing knot groups in dimension four is an open problem.  Examples For the trefoil knot, a Wirtinger presentation can be shown to be :\\\\pi_1(\\\\mathbb R^3 \\\\backslash \\\\text{trefoil}) = \\\\lang x, y \\\\mid yxy = xyx \\\\rang.

As the name implies, The Market Cross marks the site of a crucifix in the centre of the ancient market place which was erected between the thirteenth and sixteenth centuries. Market crosses symbolised fairness with dealings in the market and were used for preaching and to make public announcements. In 1583 the cross was dismantled and replaced with an open wooden shelter for corn sellers. The building was described as a “very fayer large house for corn sellers wherein they may stand in their great ease very comodiouslye in the heat of somer and also in the tyme of reyne and cold wet winter”.Bury St Edmunds Art Gallery: 25 Years at The Market Cross: 1997 The building was burnt to the ground by a fire that destroyed most of Bury St Edmunds town centre in 1608. At the insistence of King James VI and I, the Corporation rebuilt The Market Cross, and by 1620 a large timber building had been completed. The new Market Cross consisted of an open corn-stead below, and a clothiers’ hall on the first floor. During the 1600s part of the open ground floor of The Market Cross was leased as shops. By 1698 the gallery had a lanthorn or cupola on top of it. This was one of three in the town, the only one remaining today being that on Cupola House, a restaurant in The Traverse, which is the adjacent street. Markets have been held in Bury St Edmunds for more than a thousand years and still thrive today, with markets on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Even today, the street names recall their history (for example Butter Market and Hatter Street) describing the goods traded there - beasts, butter, corn, wool and fish. The Market Cross has had a wide range of uses over the past four hundred years from a theatre and dancehall to a badminton court, and a contemporary art gallery. The Theatre In June 1725 the first floor of The Market Cross became Bury St Edmunds’ first permanent theatre, The Grand Theatre. Before that, plays had been performed in rented buildings or open spaces. In The Grubstreet Journal of 19 September 1734 it was written “Our workmen are very near drawing to a conclusion the finishing The Grand Theatre, which has been so long fitting up here, for his Grace the Duke of Grafton’s Company of Comedians, and when the paintings and everything are completed, it is believed it will equal (if not exceed) any in England, and none can be supposed to come near it for situation; the company are to come from the University of Cambridge, to open at the beginning of our next fair.” Plays produced by the Comedians during their first season included Thomas Otway’s tragedy \\"The Orphan\\" and Henry Fielding’s opera \\"The Mock Doctor\\". “In 1734 the Corporation made provision for both local amateur performances and for travelling companies of players when they converted the first floor of the Market Cross into a playhouse. In 1774, Robert Adam was asked by the Corporation to produce a design for the south front of the Market Cross; his drawing is titled the New Theatre, not the Market Cross; and his design incorporated tragic and comic masks either side of the door. This little theatre served the town well and prospered so much, especially during the time of Napoleonic wars, that William Wilkins, who managed the Norwich circuit of playhouses, was inspired to acquire a site in Westgate Street, on which he built the Theatre Royal, whereupon the Market Cross theatre became the Concert Room.”Statham, M. The Book of Bury St Edmunds: 1996 The theatre was in use for only a few weeks each year during the period of the Bury Fair. In 1753 it was announced that the theatre would be equipped with boxes and the audience was forbidden to sit on the stage. It was reported that it had been decorated in a most elegant manner and proved very popular with the aristocratic families of West Suffolk. In 1774 the famous Georgian architect, Robert Adam was commissioned to re-clad the south end of The Market Cross. The scheme was later enlarged to include the other three sides and work was finally completed in 1780, although the town had been using the first floor as a theatre for four years. The exterior of the building remains largely the same today. It is cruciform in plan, the ground floor is entirely faced with chamfered limestone rustications with semi-circular headed openings. At the centre of each of the four facades is a large Venetian window with ionic columns on either side supporting a frieze and pediment.Pevsner N: Radcliffe E: Suffolk: London: 1974-: 146 On each side of the windows are niches carrying Etruscan type ornaments. All the upper windows have balustrading to the sills. Above the windows and niches are stone panels with swags and paterae. The Adam building was successful as a theatre. Suffolk County Record Office has playbills for the years 1776-1802. These record admission prices of boxes 3/-, upper boxes 2/6d, pit 2/6d and to the gallery 1/-. The theatre asked ladies and gentlemen to send their servants to reserve their seats by 5pm and performances usually began at 6pm and lasted until 11pm or midnight. Comedies were very popular, although Shakespeare’s tragedies King Lear and Hamlet were also performed. In 1818 the Corporation agreed that a new theatre should be built in Westgate Street. The present Theatre Royal Bury St Edmunds was opened in October 1819 and over the next 150 years the Corporation struggled to find a use for The Market Cross. It was used variously as a reading room, concert hall, shops and Mayor’s Parlour. Indeed from 1840 to 1971, the building was known as The Town Hall. Each new function meant the building was altered, leaving little of its Georgian interior. After a fire in 1908 the old theatre galleries were removed and then replaced. Most departments moved out of the Town Hall when the Borough offices opened in April 1937. In the 1960s the arcade was filled in, following persistent defacing and a building society occupied the space. In 1972 Bury St Edmunds Art Society successfully campaigned to turn the upper floor into an art gallery and it occupied the building for many years. The first administrator of the gallery was Mrs Kate Fullbrook and the Venetian chandeliers were donated in her memory by her husband Lt Col Fullbrook, who took over as gallery administrator after her death. Bury St Edmunds Art Gallery was renamed Smiths Row in 2010. The high ceilinged upper floor of The Market Cross made it an ideal space for showing contemporary art and many artists created work relating to the architecture and history of the space. As the Market Cross was a public gallery access was free of charge. It is no longer open, and the gallery plans to move elsewhere.

History Authority for CDDs was established by Florida's Uniform Community Development District Act of 1980. The legislation was considered a major advancement in managing growth efficiently and effectively. Although CDDs provided a new mechanism for the financing and management of new communities, their operation was consistent with the regulations and procedures of local governments, including state ethics and financial disclosure laws for CDD supervisors. All meetings and records must comply with the Florida Sunshine Law, and an annual audit is also required. As of 2012, Florida had over 600 CDDs with municipal bonds totalling $6.5 billion. Nearly three-quarters of them were established during the housing boom years between 2003 and 2008. The developer makes payments to the CDD for all properties in the district that they own. As long as new homes were selling, they had the money to cover that expense. When the bottom dropped out of the housing market in 2008, property sales in CDDs plummeted, as did developer income. Many developers did not have cash reserves to cover more than a year of CDD payments, so they had no choice but to declare bankruptcy, and 168 CDDs have defaulted on municipal bonds valued at $5.1 billion. Benefits The theory behind CDDs holds that services and public facilities used by residents and landowners will be available early in the development process, and are controlled by those who use them, and are paid for by self-imposed assessments and fees. Because the CDD is controlled by the landowners/residents, the decision of what services are offered and which facilities are constructed is up to the landowners/residents, not the developer. The cost of capital for CDDs is lower than that of the developer, saving money. Services can be bid out to private companies or provided by the CDD, and residents are not at the mercy of developer-owned enterprises. Control The CDD is controlled by a board of supervisors (BoS), five individuals elected by the landowners of the district. The board then elects one supervisor as chairperson, names a secretary and a treasurer who need not be board members, and hires a district manager, who will be responsible for daily operations of the CDD. After six years, the power must begin a transition from the landowners to the residents. Power A CDD is a legal entity that has the power and right to enter into contracts; to own both real and personal property; adopt by-laws, rules and regulations and orders; to sue and be sued; to obtain funds by borrowing; to issue bonds; and to impose assessments and levy taxes on property within the district. These taxes and assessments pay the construction, operation and maintenance costs of certain public facilities and services of the district, and are set annually by the governing board of the CDD. They are itemized on the property tax statement, in addition to county and other local governmental taxes and assessments as provided for by law. Facilities and services Section 190.012 of the act limits the special powers of the CDD to a defined set of services and facilities: * Water management and control * Water supply, sewerage, and wastewater management * Bridges and culverts * District roads and street lights * Public transportation including buses, trolleys, transit shelters, rideshareing facilities and services, parking infrastructure and related signage * Investigation and remediation of environmental contamination * Conservation areas, parks and recreational facilities * Fire prevention and control * School buildings and related structures * Security, but not the exercise of any police power * Waste collection & disposal * Mosquito control Criticism The CDD framework in the first six years allows developers to control the decision-making process because they are the primary property owner, and one vote is allocated for each acre (0.4 hectare) owned in the district. The developer can elect supervisors who are their employees, associates or friends, who then can make decisions for the benefit of the developer. Until the residents own property greater than 33% of total votes, they may not have a single representative on the BoS. Only when the residents own property greater than 50% of total votes will they have an opportunity to outvote the supervisors chosen by the developer. While the developer controls the BoS, the developer may direct the board to purchase the common property from the developer at values determined by special appraisers, who use an income approach appraisal method, which tends to give higher valuations than a cost approach. The district manager, hired by the BoS, may administrate for the interests of the developer rather than the residents. In January 2008, the Villages Center CDD (VCCDD) was notified by the Internal Revenue Service of the IRS' intent to audit several recreational bonds issued in 2003 to determine compliance with tax regulations (mainly due to their status as municipal bonds which are exempt from Federal income tax). The IRS sent three \\"Notices of Proposed Issues\\" in January 2009, challenging the tax-exempt status of the bonds on three grounds: # the Issuer does not qualify as a political subdivision or \\"on behalf of the issuer\\" of tax-exempt bonds pursuant to Section 1.103-I(b) of the Internal Revenue Code regulations, # the opinions of value do not support the price paid by the Issuer to the developer for the Series 2003 Facilities and the payment of the sales price for the facilities to the developer by the Issuer is not a governmental use of the proceeds of the Bonds, and # the Bonds are private activity bonds the interest on which is not excludable under IRS Section 103. The position stems in large part from the interrelationship between VCCDD and The Villages developers (since VCCDD has no residents, the Board of Supervisors consists solely of individuals who work for or have an affiliation with The Villages developers, and VCCDD's infrastructure was purchased by the developers-controlled board from the developers). Essentially, the IRS position is that the VCCDD is an \\"alter ego\\" for the developers.

Salon de 1910. moment essentiel de l'histoire de l'armée française.\\"  Biography  Born in Reims on 17 November 1880, Edmond-Édouard Lapeyre joined the atelier of Fernand Cormon to complete his artistic education. In 1888 Cormon moved to 104 boulevard de Clichy, where Lapeyre’s fellow students included Jacques Villon and Henri Matisse. Some time before 1907 Lapeyre moved into the area, living in rue Lepic, close by. When Cormon went to teach at the École des Beaux-Arts in 1897, Lapeyre continued to study with Paul-Émile Boutigny and Albert-François Larteau (1870–?). These were two academic painters who, even after 1900, continued to ply the Salon des Artistes Français with the kind of genre and battlescenes in the historicist style that had been popular in the 19th century.  Diversity of subjects  Lapeyre’s early envois to the Salon were eclectic. Alongside paintings of picturesque and Orientalist subjects, such as Avant le bal, a work perfectly in harmony with the canons of the Belle Époque, at the 1912 Salon he exhibited Les femmes de Sparte à Aeglia, an ambitious history painting that revived grand mythological themes. Between these two extremes, Lapeyre exhibited genre scenes depicting the leisure pursuits of Parisian high society – a boxing match in the Salle Wagram, and the Saint-Cloud racetrack. His elegant Portrait d’Anna de Noailles aux courses illustrates his twofold talent as a portraitist and chronicler of society life – qualities shared by other exhibitors such as Jean Béraud and Henri Gervex.  Lapeyre's landscapes  Landscape featured among Edmond- Édouard Lapeyre’s Salon paintings on two occasions: the first time in 1909, with En patrouille, and a second in 1914, with La rentrée des gerbes. Here, rather than the kind of dark Naturalism found in Victor-Ferdinand Bourgeois' paintings, we find a sunny social realism in which farm workers are shown making their way back to the farm, their pitchforks over their shoulders, with the discreet but palpable satisfaction of a task properly done. This essential difference of temperament makes Lapeyre closer to the colourful verism of the Italian Macchiaioli than to that of his fellow French artists, even if the latter had distanced themselves from the austere Naturalism of Zola’s day. The serenity of the weather and generosity of nature in Lapeyre’s work, and that of Gaston Balande and Henri-Alexandre Sollier, are in contrast to the bleakness of his French contemporaries.  Lapeyre, seaside painter  After 1906 most of the numerous studies of landscapes and monuments made by the artist between these years and the 1920s are dated and give the location, and it is therefore possible to trace the route that took him to the Ardennes, Biarritz, Ardes-sur-Couze (Auvergne) and, above all, Saint-Georges-de-Didonne (Charente-Maritime), a small coastal town where he first stayed in 1909, and where he painted his first beach scenes, featuring the dunes. From the 1920s tourists began to appear in his compositions, captured on the beach at nearby Royan and then at Vallières. After Trouville and the coastal resorts of Normandy, the beaches of Charente-Maritime were becoming increasingly popular with French holidaymakers. From 1921 and 1935 it was there, especially on the fine sands of Royan and Vallières, that Lapeyre liked to sketch the rocks and, above all, people with their boats and the elegant young women who posed for him . Dressed in the latest fashions from Paul Poiret or Jeanne Paquin, these élégantes are caught in what are more like the rehearsed poses of professional models than those of casual tourists. Lapeyre met his models in the studios of the milliners for whom he designed posters and signs in a simplified graphic style typical of French illustration at the time (although also recalling the bold forms of the Beggarstaff Brothers in England). With their lustrous finishes, his portraits of models irresistibly bring to mind the elegant women of the American John Singer Sargent and the Spaniard Joaquín Sorolla. Their portraits of women, perceived as icons of European fashion, also illustrate the development of a society of leisure, for which the beaches of France and Spain provided a fitting playground, but one where elegance was still de rigueur. The work by Sorolla most emblematic of this conquest of the beaches by the international bourgeoisie is without doubt Promenade by the Sea, painted in Biarritz in 1909.  Travels  Every year, from July to September, Lapeyre used to escape from his urban, Parisian existence. In 1931, for example, he was at Péréyrol in the Dordogne, and in 1935 in the Vendeix valley near La Bourboule, which inspired many delicate, lush landscapes. In the following decade he painted in Argentan (1941), at Saint Honoré in the Orne (1945), in the Nièvre, and at Vic-sur-Cère in Cantal (1947), returning here with his wife, Madeleine Charlot, in June 1950. Vue depuis notre chambre depicts this holiday. This image from the end of a full career, a window at Vic open onto both the street and the surrounding countryside, seems to encapsulate the artist’s productive and felicitously cultivated duality as a painter of both fashionable women and country folk.

Born into a family of impoverished Perthshire gentry, his father Sir John Wedderburn, 5th Baronet of Blackness, was executed for treason following the Jacobite uprising of 1745, and the young Wedderburn was forced to flee to the West Indies, where he eventually became the largest landowner in Jamaica. In 1769 he returned to Scotland with a slave, one Joseph Knight, who was inspired by Somersett's Case, a judgement in London determining that slavery did not exist under English law. Wedderburn was sued by Knight in a freedom suit, and lost his case, establishing the principle that Scots law would not uphold the institution of slavery either. Wedderburn ended his days as a wealthy country gentleman, having restored his family fortune and recovered the title Baronet of Blackness.

The Blackness in his title is Blackness House in Dundee rather than Blackness in Lothian just west of Edinburgh. Sir John Wedderburn's expectations of an inheritance were not fulfilled and he raised his large family in \\"a small farm with a thatched house and a clay floor, which he occupied with great industry, and thereby made a laborious but starving shift to support nine children who used to run about in the fields barefoot\\". In 1745 Sir John joined the rebellion of Charles Edward Stuart against the Hanoverian crown, serving as a colonel in the Jacobite army before being captured at the Battle of Culloden and hauled off to London to face trial and execution. He was indicted for treason at St Margaret's Hill, Southwark on 4 November 1746, and was found guilty, despite arguing in his defence that he had not personally taken up arms against the Crown, and was executed at Kennington Common on 28 November 1746.Cobbett, William, p.429 Cobbett's Complete Collection of State Trials and Proceedings, Volume 18 Retrieved June 2012 The young Wedderburn made his way to London to plead with such friends as his family still had for his father's rescue and pardon. His mission failed, and he was to witness his father's execution as a traitor by hanging, drawing and quartering, after which he was forced to return to Scotland where he found himself cut off from his inheritance and, without prospects, obliged to take ship to the New World. In Glasgow he found a ship's captain prepared to let him work his passage on a ship bound for the Caribbean.Oliver, p.326 Career 1804 map of Parker's Bay, Westmoreland, Jamaica, showing John Wedderburn's land on the left Some time in early 1747 Wedderburn landed in the British Colony of Jamaica, an island which had been seized from the Spanish in 1655, and was fast becoming an important centre for the production and export of sugar. The young Wedderburn settled in the west of Jamaica, near Montego Bay, and tried his hand at a number of occupations, even practising for a few years as a medical doctor, despite having no qualifications. He managed to acquire sufficient capital to become a planter, investing in land, slaves and sugar, at the time an immensely profitable business.Oliver, p.344 Wedderburn's sugar plantations prospered and he acquired huge amounts of land and wealth, becoming at one time the largest landowner in Jamaica, with around 17,000 acres of land, around 10% of the island's landmass. Other members of his family followed him, and the Wedderburns built up extensive estates in the colony.Monteah, Archibald, p.116, Archibald Monteath: Igbo, Jamaican, Moravian Retrieved June 2012 Sugar was big business. In the eighteenth century the British became the largest producers of sugar in the West Indies, and the British people quickly became the commodity's largest consumers. West Indian sugar became ubiquitous as an additive to Indian tea. It has been estimated that the profits of the slave trade and of West Indian plantations created up to one-in-twenty of every pound circulating in the British economy at the time of the Industrial Revolution in the latter half of the 18th century.Digital History Retrieved June 2012 In 1762 Wedderburn attended a \\"scramble\\" (an early form of slave auction) and purchased a young African boy aged 12 or 13 years, named Joseph Knight after the captain of the ship that had brought him to the West Indies. Rather than set Knight to work as a field hand, Wedderburn made him a house servant, teaching him to read and write and having him baptised as a Christian. Return to Scotland, first marriage and family Gatehouse to Ballindean Estate A barn on Ballindean Farm The 1832 Ballindean House Seven years later, in 1769, Wedderburn returned to Scotland, and brought Joseph Knight with him.Oliver, p.345 He returned to Perthshire where he sought to re- establish his family's respectability, marry and raise a family, and reclaim the title Baronet of Blackness.Oliver, p.349 In 1769 he purchased the Ballindean estate, near Inchture, a village between Dundee and Perth on the northern side of the Firth of Tay. The (NB spelling), the listed building visible today, is an 1832 rebuild. On 25 November 1769, aged 40 years, Wedderburn married his first wife, Margaret Ogilvy, daughter of David Ogilvy, de jure 6th Earl of Airlie (i.e. from a family like his, attainted by the stain of treason). They married in Cortachy, Angus. They had four children, of whom three survived to adulthood: * Margaret (1772-1807) Margaret married Philip Dundas, a senior official with the East India Company, and later an MP and Governor of Prince of Wales Island, now known as Penang. * Jean (1773-1861). Jean married John Hope Oliphant, also of Prince of Wales Island.

Dundas and Oliphant are buried next to each other at the Old Protestant Cemetery, George Town, Penang. * Sir David Wedderburn, 1st Baronet.(1775-1858) Margaret Ogilvy died two weeks after David's birth. Wedderburn's second wife was Alicia Dundas, daughter of Col. James Dundas, of Dundas. The couple had the following children: * Sir John Wedderburn, 2nd Baronet (1789-1862), married Henrietta Louisa, daughter of William Milburn, Esq. * Mara/Maria * Susan * Louisa Dorothea, married General Sir John Hope, 4th Earl of Hopetoun * Anne (1788-1867), married Sir John Hope, Bart., of Craighall and Pinkie Meanwhile , Joseph Knight fell in love with a servant girl from Dundee, one Annie Thompson, and Wedderburn gave permission for the couple to marry. Knight -v- Wedderburn In around 1778, Knight became aware of the ruling in the Somerset Case in England, which held that slavery did not exist under English law. Perhaps assuming (wrongly) that a ruling in an English court applied equally in Scotland, Knight demanded his freedom, and even asked for back wages, which Wedderburn refused. Wedderburn was indignant, feeling that he had bestowed considerable gifts on Knight by educating and taking care of him. Soon, Thompson was pregnant with Knight's child and Wedderburn dismissed her, refusing Knight permission to go as well. When Wedderburn found Knight packing his bags to leave, he summoned the magistrate and had him arrested and thrown into Perth jail. Knight managed to persuade John Swinton, the deputy sheriff at Perth Sheriff Court, that he was entitled to his freedom. Knight therefore brought a claim before the Justices of the Peace court in Perth, a case that would be known as Knight -v- Wedderburn.National Archives of Scotland website feature - Slavery, freedom or perpetual servitude? - the Joseph Knight case Retrieved May 2012 Appeal to the Sheriff At first, events moved in Wedderburn's favour. The Justices of the Peace found against Knight, but the latter soon appealed to the Sheriff Court of Perth, who found against Wedderburn, stating that: :\\"the state of slavery is not recognised by the laws of this kingdom, and is inconsistent with the principles thereof: That the regulations in Jamaica, concerning slaves, do not extend to this kingdom\\". Appeal to the Court of Session Henry Home, Lord Kames. In 1777 Wedderburn in turn appealed to the Court of Session in Edinburgh, Scotland's supreme civil court, arguing that Knight still owed perpetual service, in the same manner as an indentured servant or an apprenticed artisan. The case was important enough that it was given a full panel of twelve judges including Lord Kames, the important legal and social historian. Knight was represented by no less than Henry Dundas, the Lord Advocate of Scotland, who was outraged by Knight's condition. Dundas was in turn helped in the preparation of the case by James Boswell and Samuel Johnson, who took a keen interest in the case, lending their considerable weight to Knight's defence. Their argument was that 'no man is by nature the property of another'. Since there was no proof that Knight had given up his natural freedom, he should be set free. Conversely, Wedderburn's counsel argued that commercial interests, which underpinned Scotland's prosperity, should prevail. In an unexpected decision, Lord Kames stated that 'we sit here to enforce right not to enforce wrong' and the court emphatically rejected Wedderburn's appeal, ruling by an 8 to 4 majority Oliver, p.350 that: : \\"the dominion assumed over this Negro, under the law of Jamaica, being unjust, could not be supported in this country to any extent: That, therefore, the defender had no right to the Negro’s service for any space of time, nor to send him out of the country against his consent: That the Negro was likewise protected under the act 1701, c.6. from being sent out of the country against his consent.\\" In effect, slavery was not recognised by Scots law and runaway slaves (or 'perpetual servants') could be protected by the courts, if they wished to leave domestic service or were resisting attempts to return them to slavery in the colonies.Court of Session, unextracted processes, National Archives of Scotland (reference CS235/K/2/2). Later life and second marriage Wedderburn, undismayed by his defeat, devoted the rest of his days to upholding the rights of slaveholders (see London Society of West India Planters and Merchants), and was eventually successful in claiming the title 6th Baronet of Blackness, thereby restoring his family's respectability after the disaster of defeat and humiliation at Culloden. On 27 December 1780 he married again, this time to Alice Dundas, who was related to Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville, the Tory politician. According to research by the Legacies of British Slave-ownership project, there were three boys and four girls born to this marriage. The eldest son, James, died before his father. John (1789–1862) succeeded his half-brother David as the second baronet. (Genealogist Joseph Foster writes that the second baronet's children included David (1835-1882) and William (1838-1918), the third and fourth baronets respectively; the eldest son John had joined the Bengal Civil Service and died in the Indian Mutiny of 1857.) Alexander (1791-1839) was a soldier. The four girls were Maria, Susan, Louisa Dorothea, and Anne. On 9 February 1803, aged 16, Louisa married General John Hope, 4th Earl of Hopetoun.Louisa Wedderburn at www.stanford.edu Retrieved June 2012 Anne married Sir John Hope, 11th Baronet Hope of Craighall. John Campbell, 1st Baron Campbell recounted meeting John Wedderburn around 1798.

One whom he did not acknowledge was Robert Wedderburn, a radical preacher and a tireless campaigner against slavery, who published in 1824 an anti-slavery book entitled The Horrors of Slavery, printed by William Dugdale and possibly coauthored by George Cannon. Others of James's children include Andrew Colvile, governor of the Hudson's Bay Company; Jean, who married Thomas Douglas, 5th Earl of Selkirk; and James Wedderburn, Solicitor General for Scotland until his death in 1822.

It is located within the northern suburbs of Perth, from Madeley in the west, to Henley Brook in the east. Gnangara Road provides a connection between Great Northern Highway (via West Swan Road) and Wanneroo Road. The construction of the Ocean Reef Road extension in 2011 altered the road network in the Landsdale area in Landsdale. The plans show Gnangara Road as discontinuous between Mirrabooka Avenue and Alexander Drive, with the Mirrabooka Avenue and Ocean Reef Road extensions linking the two sections. Following construction, those linking road sections were named as Gnangara Road, allowing the road to remain continuous. Route description View eastbound from Hartman Drive From its western terminus at Wanneroo Road, Gnangara Road travels along the southern boundary of the Wangara industrial area. It continues east to reach Mirrabooka Avenue after 3.7 km (2.3 mi), where it then travels northwards for 350 m (1,150 ft) to Ocean Reef Road, before turning right to continue east for 1.5 km (0.9 mi) to Alexander Drive, and then after another 5 km (3.1 mi) it encounters Tonkin Highway at a parclo interchange. The road travels past Whiteman Park's northern edge, and the southern edge of Ellenbrook. It finally terminates, after journey, in Henley Brook at West Swan Road, which connects northwards to Great Northern Highway, and southwards to Reid Highway. History Traffic lights were installed in 2007 at the then-recently duplicated Alexander Drive intersection. In 2011, as part of the Ocean Reef Road extension, the section between Mirrabooka Avenue/Sydney Road/Ocean Reef Road intersection and West Swan Road had the State Route 83 allocation replaced by State Route 84. The road is discontinuous at Wangara, where motorists will have to travel northwards along Mirrabooka Avenue to turn right at the nearby intersection to continue on Gnangara Road. Gnangara Road was upgraded to a four lane dual carriage way between Drumpellier Drive and Pinaster Parade, near Ellenbrook. The works began in May 2012, and included traffic lights at the intersection of Gnangara Road and Drumpellier Drive, drainage, and kerbing. The upgrade works were completed on schedule, in December 2012, at a cost of more the $3.3 million. Also in 2012 a single lane roundabout was constructed at Gnangara Road's eastern terminus with West Swan Road and Henry Street. Construction works began after the relocation of water and electrical services, and took 12 to 15 months. The state government committed $6.6 million to construct a second carriageway between Beechboro Road North and Drumpellier Drive, and an additional $14 million to complete the remaining up to Alexander Drive which took place between 2013 and 2015. The works involved installing traffic lights at the intersection with Beechboro Road North, which was the site of 131 accidents during the five-year period to 2010, and rated fifth in the RAC’s 2012 list of Western Australia’s worst intersections. In 2019, the intersection was subsequently removed as part of the NorthLink WA project due both to the new parclo interchange with Tonkin Highway opening just to the east along with the carriageway itself crossing the path of Beechboro Road North (that road was made a cul-de-sac at its northern end accessible from near Hepburn Avenue). Future Works Gnangara Road in the City of Swan is planned to ultimately be upgraded to a six lane dual carriage road between Alexander Drive and Tonkin Highway, and a four lane dual carriage road between Tonkin Highway and Pinaster Parade.

Formaggio di Fossa is a cheese from Sogliano al Rubicone in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy. The cheese's name, which literally means \\"cheese of the pit\\", is derived from the process of ripening the cheese in special pits dug in tuff rock. The cheese is currently produced in the areas between the Rubicon and Marecchia river valleys. In 2009 formaggio di fossa was granted Denominazione di Origine Protetta status, the Italian equivalent of protected designation of origin.Agraria.org Production process Fossa cheese is made with either sheep's milk, cow's milk, or a mixture of the two. The cheese typically matures around 30 days before being placed in the \\"fossa\\", a pit dug into the ground and lined with straw. The pit is prepared by burning straw inside to remove moisture and sterilize the space. The cheese is wrapped in cloth bags and placed in the pit, which is then closed off entirely while the cheese matures for an additional 80 to 100 days. The sealing of the pit limits the oxygen available to the cheese, enabling a process of anaerobic fermentation. After being removed from the pit, the cheese is allowed to ripen for an additional three months. The technique of making formaggio di fossa dates back to the 15th century.

Established in 2009, Dusk is the only adult TV channel in the world aimed at a female audience. Demand for female-oriented adult films, porna or women's erotica has been increasing for many years and is becoming increasingly accepted. Dusk operates believing women have their own fantasies and needs and therefore require a different kind of adult films. By questioning its female users via an online panel, Dusk has become an expert in this area. Dusk is available in The Netherlands on the platforms of Ziggo, UPC Netherlands, CAIW and KPN and broadcasts 24/7. The channel is owned by 2GrapesMedia. Content Dusk offers a mix of mainly adult films and scenes, from all over the world and from a female point of view, and adult films in the genre of feminist pornography. The information provided by the online panel is the main guideline for selection, enabling to stay up to date with tastes, opinions and likes and dislikes regarding adult content for women. Content rejected by the panel is not broadcast. This method of selecting films has resulted in a new genre within the adult entertainment industry: porna. Directors and films The TV channel schedules films by female porn directors including Candida Royalle, Petra Joy, Nica Noelle, Erika Lust, Madison Young, Anna Span, Ovidie, Stormy Daniels, and Maria Beatty. Some of these directors make feminist pornography or pornography targeted at a female audience, while others cater to couples. The channel also broadcasts short films by Swedish filmmaker Mia Engberg, who, along with twelve other directors, produced a collection of feminist pornographic short films entitled Dirty Diaries, as well as films by Puzzy Power, a Danish film company established in 1997 as a subsidiary to Lars von Trier's company Zentropa with the goal of producing pornographic films for women. The Dusk schedule includes a French television series of erotic short films called X Femmes, made by female directors with the aim of producing erotica from a female point of view. Research on porn for women An all-female panel started in 2010. This panel now consists of roughly 2000 women and it is still growing. The women in the panel regularly view fragments from all kinds of adult films including both hard-core mainstream films and films made from a female point of view. After watching a fragment, the women are asked to fill out a survey, rating and reviewing the fragment. Before Dusk reaches a conclusion about a film, it has to have been viewed and rated a hundred times. The results of the panel are published on the website on a regular basis.

Members of this family have played a prominent role through the history of Spain and The Americas. Etymology Zambrana or Zambrano comes from the word soberano (\\"sovereign\\"). Origins The Zambrano family originated in the mountains of Biscay. Piferrer records that the first to bear this name was Fortun Sanchez. Francisco Zazo y Rosillo, the Chronicler King of Arms to Philip V of Spain, chronicled the lineage of the Zambrano family from its origins in the village of Zambrana in the Gipuzkoa province in what was at the time the Kingdom of Castile. (excerpted at http://www.euskalnet.net/laviana/gen_hispanas/zambrana.htm) This Castilian origin is reflected in the Zambrano family crest, which features the castle sigil of Castile along with the rose sigil of Reus. The progenitor of this line was Ochoa de Zambraos, who served as a knight to the Catholic Monarchs. Zazo proceeds to trace the lineage through five generations (and the eventual evolution of the name from Zambraos to Zambrano), noting the spread of the family to Flanders, Úbeda, Málaga, Antequera and La Rioja, and the service of the family to Philip I of Castile, Charles V of Flanders and Philip II of Spain. The village of Zambrana was named for the Zambrano family, who were granted a land grant there by Don Sancho in 1058. The Estado Militar de España was an annual register of the status of military affairs of Spain, including the listing of special orders of military honor, including the Order of Santiago, the Order of Calatrava, the Order of Alcantara and the Order of Montesa. The Zambrano name can be found frequently among these registers. Notable Zambranos Carlos Zambrano pitched in Major League Baseball from 2001–2012.
