The non-driving time was 12 hours, 48 minutes, and 19 seconds.  Fastest time from Los Angeles to New York City in an electric vehicle  The April 16‚Äì19, 2015 trip also set the record for the fastest time from Los Angeles to New York City in an electric vehicle.The total trip time was 58 hours and 55 minutes. The trip was supported by Anthony Alvarado, Johnnie Oberg, and Matt Nordenstrom.  Transcontinental autonomous record  From October 18‚Äì21, 2015, Deena Mastracci, Reese, and Alex Roy set the first record for the shortest LA-NYC trip with a semi-autonomous car. The trio drove from Redondo Beach, CA in route to Red Ball Garage in Manhattan in 57 hours and 48 minutes.The drivers used the autopilot function of the Tesla Model S P85D for 96.1% of the 2995-mile journey.  Double transcontinental electric vehicle record  On October 22, 2015, after fewer than 28 hours in New York City after the record-breaking autonomous run, Deena Mastracci and Reese drove the Tesla P85D back to the Portofino Hotel in Redondo Beach, California. A notary stood by to officially log the couple in; a staff member of the Portofino was witness. The couple set the double transcontinental record for an electric vehicle (round trip LA-NYC-LA) with a time of 6 days, 6 hours, and 22 minutes; this beat the previous record set by Dan Edmunds and Kurt Niebuhrs, which was 6 days, 23 hours, and 4 minutes.  Solo motorcycle \\"Cannonball\\" record from Los Angeles to New York City  Reese held the record for fastest solo motorcycle from Los Angeles to New York City with a time of 38 hours and 49 minutes. He departed from Winnetka, CA on 28 August 2015 at 3:15 am and arrived in New York City the next day at 9:04 pm. Reese insisted on notaries at both the start and finish lines who verified his identification, engine number, odometer reading, and VIN. The motorcycle used was also tracked by third-party GPS tracking. His record was later beaten by Adam Frasca on April 10, 2019 with an east to west record time of 37 hours 7 minutes and again two weeks later by Calvin Cote with a west to east record time of 35 hours 6 minutes on April 21, 2019. Guinness World Record: Greatest Distance in 24 hours on a Motorcycle (solo) On February 26, 2017 Reese broke the Guinness Book of World Record for Greatest Distance in 24 hours on a Motorcycle (individual) on a track. Reese partnered with Continental AG to use the 8.5 mile closed track to set his latest world record. Continental Tire Proving Grounds are located in Uvalde, Texas. Reese totaled 2116.5 miles in less than a 24-hour period. Breaking the existing Guinness record of 2023.5 miles held by Matthew McKelvey in 2014.

Facts Mr Tullio Ratti claimed that he should not have to comply with a stricter Italian law that required him to label his solvents, on the ground that it conflicted with two Directives. Mr Ratti sold solvents and varnishes, some of which were imported from Germany that complied with two Directives. Directive 73/173 (adopted 4 June 1973, to be implemented 8 December 1974) and Directive 77/728 (adopted 7 November 1977, to be implemented 9 November 1979) required solvents and varnishes to be packaged and labelled specially. Mr Ratti complied with the Directives, but an Italian law of 1963 was stricter in some respects. Mr Ratti was prosecuted for failure to comply with the Italian law. Directive 73/173 was already meant to have been implemented, but Directive 77/728 was not yet required to be implemented: Italy had not changed the law at all. Mr Ratti argued that compliance with the Directives, rather than Italian law, was enough. The court in Milan referred to the ECJ whether Mr Ratti had to comply. Judgment=Advocate General Opinion Advocate General Reischl gave an opinion, speaking against the possibility of horizontal direct effect.at 1650 Court of Justice The ECJ held that Mr Ratti was not bound by Italian law that was meant to be changed by Directive 73/173, but he was still bound by Italian law, which would later have to be changed under Directive 77/728 because its deadline for being implemented had not yet passed.

In several dominant drug classification systems, these four types of classifications form a hierarchy. For example, the fibrates are a chemical class of drugs (amphipathic carboxylic acids) that share the same mechanism of action (PPAR agonist), mode of action (reducing blood triglycerides), and are used to prevent and to treat the same disease (atherosclerosis). Conversely not all PPAR agonists are fibrates, not all triglyceride lowering agents are PPAR agonists, and not all drugs that are used to treat atherosclerosis are triglyceride lowering agents. A drug class is typically defined by a prototype drug, the most important, and typically the first developed drug within the class, used as a reference for comparison.  Comprehensive systems * Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System (ATC) - most widely used. Combines classification by organ system and therapeutic, pharmacological, and chemical properties. * Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) - includes a section devoted to drug classification  Chemical class  This type of categorisation of drugs is from a chemical perspective and categorises them by their chemical structure. Examples of drug classes that are based on chemical structures include: * Œ≤-lactam antibiotic * Benzodiazepine * Cardiac glycoside * Fibrate * Opioid * Thiazide diuretic * Steroid  Mechanism of action  This type of categorisation is from a pharmacological perspective and categorises them by their biological target. Drug classes that share a common molecular mechanism of action by modulating the activity of a specific biological target. The definition of a mechanism of action also includes the type of activity at that biological target. For receptors, these activities include agonist, antagonist, inverse agonist, or modulator. Enzyme target mechanisms include activator or inhibitor. Ion channel modulators include opener or blocker. The following are specific examples of drug classes whose definition is based on a specific mechanism of action: * 5-Alpha-reductase inhibitor * Angiotensin II receptor antagonist * ACE inhibitor * Alpha-adrenergic agonist * Beta blocker * Dopamine agonist * Dopamine antagonist * Incretin mimetic * Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ‚àí cyclooxygenase inhibitor * Proton-pump inhibitor * Renin inhibitor * Selective glucocorticoid receptor modulator * Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor * Statin ‚Äì HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor * Cholinergic * Dopaminergic * GABAergic * Serotonergic  Mode of action  This type of categorisation of drugs is from a biological perspective and categorises them by the anatomical or functional change they induce. Drug classes that are defined by common modes of action (i.e. the functional or anatomical change they induce) include: * Diuretic or Antidiuretic * Inotrope (positive or negative) * Chronotrope (positive or negative) * Bronchodilator * Decongestant * Antithrombotics * Antifungals * Antimicrobials  Therapeutic class  This type of categorisation of drugs is from a medical perspective and categorises them by the pathology they are used to treat. Drug classes that are defined by their therapeutic use (the pathology they are intended to treat) include: * Analgesics * Antibiotic * Anticoagulant * Antidepressant * Anticancer * Antiepileptic * Antipsychotic * Antiviral * Sedative * Antidiabetic * Cardiovascular Amalgamated classes Some drug classes have been amalgamated from these three principles to meet practical needs. The class of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is one such example. Strictly speaking, and also historically, the wider class of anti-inflammatory drugs also comprises steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. These drugs were in fact the predominant anti-inflammatories during the decade leading up to the introduction of the term \\"nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\\". Because of the disastrous reputation that the corticosteroids had got in the 1950s, the new term, which offered to signal that an anti-inflammatory drug was not a steroid, rapidly gained currency. The drug class of \\"nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs\\" (NSAIDs) is thus composed by one element (\\"anti- inflammatory\\") that designates the mechanism of action, and one element (\\"nonsteroidal\\") that separates it from other drugs with that same mechanism of action. Similarly, one might argue that the class of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD) is composed by one element (\\"disease-modifying\\") that albeit vaguely designates a mechanism of action, and one element (\\"anti- rheumatic drug\\") that indicates its therapeutic use. * Nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drug (NSAID) * Disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) Other systems of classification Other systems of drug classification exist, for example the Biopharmaceutics Classification System which determines a drugs' attributes by solubility and intestinal permeability.

The DIVARTY has served with the division in World War II, Vietnam, Operations Desert Shield and Storm, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and in peacetime at Camp Breckinridge and Fort Campbell, Kentucky, and Fort Jackson, South Carolina. The DIVARTY was inactivated in 2005 as part of transformation to modular brigade combat teams, but was reactivated on 16 October 2014 to provide fire support coordination and mission command for the training and readiness of field artillery units across the division. History The 176th Field Artillery Brigade was constituted in the Organized Reserve on 24 June 1921, assigned to the 101st Division in the Sixth Corps Area with its headquarters in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The brigade consisted of two 75mm gun regiments (the 376th and 377th Field Artillery regiments) and the 326th Ammunition Train. In 1929, a 155mm howitzer regiment (the 378th Field Artillery, replaced within a month with the 572nd Field Artillery) was added to the brigade when the Army adopted a lighter 155mm howitzer. The brigade conducted its summer training at Camps Custer and McCoy in Wisconsin.Clay, Steven E.

On 2 February 1968, the DIVARTY assumed responsibility for coordinating fires in AO Uniontown Center and North. On 7 February 1968, the 2nd Battalion, 11th Field Artillery (- Battery A) was attached to the DIVARTY, providing a 155mm reinforcing capability. From 17‚Äì23 February, personnel from HHB, 2-319th and 1-321st received M18 Field Artillery Digital Automatic Computer (FADAC) training from 1st Infantry Division Artillery, to operate FADAC computers issued on 9 February 1968. When 3rd Brigade, 82nd Airborne Division arrived in Vietnam and came under the operational control of the 101st, the DIVARTY assumed responsibility for the 2-321 which was attached to the brigade. On 1 March 1968, the DIVARTY Fire Direction Center (FDC) coordinated the fires of five batteries in support of B/2-506 Infantry. In early March, the DIVARTY moved to the I Corps Tactical Zone (CTZ), the DIVARTY passed fire control for AO Uniontown to 2nd Battalion, 40th Field Artillery.

Facts Helen Marshall, a senior dietitian, claimed that her dismissal on grounds of being old violated the Equal Treatment Directive 1976. She was an employee of an Area Health Authority (or \\"AHA\\"), a body established by the UK government under the National Health Service Act 1977, as amended by the Health Services Act 1980. Marshall was dismissed after 14 years on 31 March 1980, approximately four weeks after attaining the age of 62, despite her expressing a willingness to continue in employment until the age of 65 (4 February 1983). The sole reason for her dismissal was that she had passed 'the retirement age'; the AHA‚Äôs policy was to make women compulsorily retire at 60, but men at 65. Section 27 (1) and 28 (1) of the Social Security Act 1975 provided state pensions were to be granted to men at 65 and woman at 60, though notably did not impose any obligation to retire at the age at which the state pension becomes payable. The AHA were able to waive the term, which was deemed an implied term of Marshall's contract of employment and had done so for a further two years after she attained the age of 60. Given Marshall suffered financial loss, namely the difference between her earnings as an employee and her pension, and since she lost the satisfaction gained from work she initiated proceedings before an industrial tribunal, contending her dismissal constituted discriminatory treatment on the ground of sex, contrary to the sexual discrimination act and community law. The tribunal dismissed the claim in so far as it was based on infringement of the sexual discrimination act, since s 6 (4) permits discrimination of the grounds of sex in regards to retirement. However the claim on the basis that the principle of equal treatment laid down by directive 76/207 was upheld. The employment appeal tribunal affirmed the industrial tribunal on the first point, yet set aside the decision on the second point, on the basis that an individual had no locus standi and could not rely upon such a violation in proceedings before a United Kingdom court or tribunal. The English Court of Appeal found the Area Health Authority an ‚Äòemanation of the State‚Äô, observing that the AHA respondent was constituted under s.8(1) of the National Health Service Act 1977. The Court made reference of two questions for preliminary ruling to the European Court of Justice (ECJ): *First, whether the respondent's dismissal on the grounds that she was a woman who had passed the normal retiring age was an act of discrimination prohibited by the Directive. *Secondly, if the answer to the first is affirmative, whether or not the equal treatment directive can be relied upon by the appellant in the circumstances in national courts or tribunals, not withstanding the inconsistency, if any, between the Directive and the Sex Discrimination Act 1975. Judgment=Advocate General Opinion Advocate General Slynn argued the ‚Äòstate‚Äô should be construed broadly, to cover all organs, saying that insinuating ‚Äòhorizontal effect‚ÄôHorizontal direct effect concerns the relationship between individuals (including companies). If a certain provision of EU law is horizontally directly effective, then citizens are able to rely on it in actions against each other. Directives are usually incapable of being horizontally directly effective. Certain provisions of the treaties and legislative acts such as regulations are capable of being directly enforced horizontally.Vertical direct effect concerns the relationship between EU law and national law ‚Äì specifically, the state's obligation to ensure its observance and its compatibility with EU law, thereby enabling citizens to rely on it in actions against the state or against public bodies; an \\"emanation of the state\\" as defined in Foster v. British Gas plc. into directives would ‚Äòtotally blur the distinction between EU directives and regulations'. Court of Justice The ECJ, in a full court of 13 judges, held there was no horizontal direct effect. It does not matter what capacity a state is acting. Thus it fell to enquire whether the NHS should be deemed an \\"independent legal person\\" or an \\"arm of the state\\"; and that was a matter for the national court. English Court of Appeal This case involved an application for a preliminary ruling. Once the ECJ had answered the question, their decision was remitted to the reconvened Court of Appeal (which in the interim had adjourned this case). The Court of Appeal was then obliged to reach a decision in the light of the ECJ ruling.

The parish church of Penhow is dedicated to St Maur. It should however be differentiated from the Anglo-Norman \\"baronial family\\" named St Maur, created Baron St Maur by writ in 1314, who bore different armorials (Argent, two chevrons gules) and which originated at the manor of St. Maur, near Avranches, in Normandy.Battle Abbey Roll. quoting \\"The Norman People\\" The ancestor of the \\"baronial St Maurs\\" was Wido de St Maur (died pre-1086) who came to England during the Norman Conquest of 1066, whose son William FitzWido is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as a substantial tenant of Geoffrey Bishop of Coutances, and who held a feudal barony with lands in Somerset, Wiltshire and Gloucester, with ten manors in Somersetshire (of which Portishead was one). He made conquests in Wales in about 1090, which his family afterwards held. No conclusive evidence exists to confirm the \\"baronial St Maurs\\" and the \\"Seymours of Hatch\\" as derived from a common stock, however Camden believed this to be most probable.Battle Abbey Roll The two families adopted different arms at the start of the age of heraldry, c. 1200 ‚Äì 1215, with the \\"baronial St Maurs\\" bearing: Argent, two chevrons gules.

In about 1633 the manor house was visited by the Somerset historian Thomas Gerard (d.1634), who wrote as follows:The Particular Description of the county of Somerset drawn up by Thomas Gerard of Trent 1633, pp.147-9 :The mansion house in which theis noblemen lived which I went to see is soe ruined that were it not called Hach Court you would not believe yt it were any of the remaynes of a Baron's house, yet I sawe in the Hall Beauchampe's armes and in a little Chappell on the top of the house Seymer's winges \\"or\\" in a red sheild, and going a little farther to the Church to see some monuments I find not one, the Church having bin new built long since the Beauchamps time; only in a large North Ile I saw the Armes of Seymour, Beauchampe, Stermy and Coker quartered, which shewes that it must be noe older then Henry the seaventh his time, when peace upon the union of the houses of Lancaster and Yorke produced plentie, and that pious workes, for that Sir John Seymer which married Coker's heire did die the nineteenth of Edward the fourth and his wife seaven yeares before him wherefore it must be his sonne that built it, otherwise he could not have quartered Coker's Armes =William Seymour, 3rd Duke of Somerset (1654‚Äì1671)= William Seymour, 3rd Duke of Somerset (1654‚Äì1671), grandson, son of Henry Seymour, Lord Beauchamp (1626‚Äì1654), 3rd but eldest surviving son of the 2nd Duke, who predeceased his father having married Mary Capell. He died unmarried and without progeny and was succeeded in the Dukedom by his uncle, but his estates, which were not entailed with the dukedom, were inherited by his sister Lady Elizabeth Seymour, wife of Thomas Bruce, 3rd Earl of Elgin and 2nd Earl of Ailesbury.

Collins The descent in the Collins family of the estate of Hatch Beauchamp, but apparently not the lordship of the manor (held by the heirs of the Uttermares), was as follows: *John Collins (1725‚Äì1792) was the son of John I Collins (died 1738) of Ilminster, from a family of wool and cloth merchants.

In 1822 Thomas Clifton Esq. is recorded as residing there. Henry Powell Collins built a private pew in Hatch Beauchamp Church, for which he received a faculty dated 6 July 1825, in which he was described as the \\"owner and occupier of a newly erected messuage or mansion in the parish of Hatch Beauchamp.\\" This mansion was Hatch Park, which was bequeathed to him by his father, and on which he built a new house. He died in 1854 and was buried at Ilminster. His only child and sole-heiress apparent was his daughter Dorothea Jacintha Collins (died 1822), who predeceased her father, having married and had a son by William Gore Langton, son and heir of William Gore Langton of Newton Park near Bath in Somerset. She died on 26 June 1822 at the Pulteney Hotel in London; her body was brought to Ilminster for burial.

In World War I he commanded destroyers on the Dover Patrol and took part in Battle of Zeebrugge, for which he won the D.S.O. and the Croix de Guerre. In memory of his wife in 1964 he presented a piece of land to the village to be called the \\"Lady Alice Gore Langton Memorial Field\\". Early in World War II several evacuee children from London were billeted in Hatch Park. During the night of 3 February 1940 the house caught fire and Miss Sarah Tennant, the Gore Langton family nurse and at the time the housekeeper, died whilst searching a burning room to make sure that all the children were safe. Her funeral in Hatch Beauchamp church on 8 February was attended by a great concourse of friends and villagers in tribute to her act of self-sacrifice and devotion. The old house was totally destroyed and now a new and smaller house stands on its site. Oakes During the early 19th century Hatch Court had many different occupiers. From 1838 to 1855 William Oakes owned it He was a churchwarden and there is a memorial to him in the west porch. Hardstaff From 1856 to the end of the century various members of the Hardstaff family resided at Hatch Court. They were Methodists, and Henry Hardstaff built a small Methodist chapel on the edge of the park. However, the Hardstaff family as owners of Hatch Court retained the right to the use of five pews in the north aisle of the church, and this is Shawn on the Gilbert Scott plan of the church (1867). Lloyd (William) Henry Lloyd (1839‚Äì1916), who in 1899 purchased Hatch Court In 1899 (William) Henry Lloyd (1839‚Äì1916) purchased Hatch Court and its 360-acre estate. He was a member of the wealthy Lloyd family of Birmingham, Quakers by religion, long established steel manufacturers and founders of Lloyds Bank, which originated at Dolobran Hall, Montgomeryshire in Wales. He was the fifth son of Samuel II \\"Quaker\\" Lloyd (1795‚Äì1862), who established the iron founder \\"Lloyds Foster & Co.\\" which owned the \\"Old Park Works\\" foundry and colliery in Wednesbury. The firm however lost a fortune supplying materials for Blackfriars Bridge in London. In 1818 \\"Quaker\\" Lloyd moved residence to The Hollies, Wood Green, Wednesbury to supervise his mining estate. He took over Bills & Mills ironworks and renamed it \\"Darlastan Iron Company\\" and built Kings Hill Ironworks. \\"Quaker\\" Lloyd married Mary Honeychurch (1795‚Äì1865). \\"Quaker\\" Lloyd's father was Samuel I Lloyd (1768‚Äì1849), banker, the second son of Sampson III Lloyd (1728‚Äì1807) who with his own father Sampson II Lloyd (1699‚Äì1779) of Farm, Bordesley, Birmingham, had co-founded Lloyds Bank in 1765.Parker, Bev, A History of Wednesbury Sampson II Lloyd was an ironmaster from Dolobran in Montgomeryshire and lived at Farm, Bordesley (now the historic building known as \\"Lloyd's Farmhouse\\", Farm Park, Sampson Road, Sparkbrook).For a complete history and pedigree of the lloyd family see Lowe, Rachel J., Farm and its Inhabitants with Some Account of the Lloyds of Dolobran, London, 1883 Together with his brother Charles Lloyd, Sampson II Lloyd bought the Town Mill iron-forge in Burton-upon-Trent and traded in iron.

Louis Hadley Evans Sr., pastor of First Presbyterian Church of Hollywood. Louis graduated from Hollywood High School where he was A.S.B. President, before serving in the Navy during WWII. Evans led the first World Deputation team to go out from Hollywood Presbyterian in June 1950. The early teams had the goal of taking the ‚Äúmessage of Christ‚Äôs redeeming love to the war-weary students of Europe.‚Äù However, they were challenged by Corrie ten Boom: \\"The people of Europe do need to see the love and forgiveness of Christ. But the gospel team idea won‚Äôt work. You have not suffered as the people as the people in Europe have suffered, so what right have you to speak? If you want to make a vital witness to the power of your faith, go to a city destroyed by American bombs. Identify with the people. Work with them. Eat what they eat. Sleep where they sleep. Maybe if you do it well enough and long enough, without compensation, they will hear what you have to say.\\" The team was sponsored by the World Council of Churches with the task of rebuilding foundations of destroyed buildings in Germany and France. By the 1960s, the group was focused on East Germany and known as the ‚ÄúBerlin Fellowship.‚Äù Louis and his family moved to Washington to minister at the National Presbyterian Church, where most American presidents have attended services and visitors have included Queen Elizabeth and Mother Teresa. Ronald Reagan and his wife, Nancy Reagan attended Louis original Bel Air Church in California, as well as the National Presbyterian Church during his time as President. Louis Jr. was the organizing pastor of Bel Air Church in Bel Air, California, where the first church gatherings were at the manse (pastor's home) in April 1956. Louis Evans Jr.'s ministry was influenced by Henrietta Mears who was the Christian Education Director of 1st Presbyterian Hollywood where Louis's father was pastor. Mears led several of Louis Evans Jr.'s friends to evangelism and ministry including Bill Bright, and Richard Halvorsen. Louis wife, Colleen Townsend Evans and a few other Hollywood starlets started the Hollywood Christian Group in 1949 in Mears's home. Original Hollywood Christian Group participants included Roy Rogers, Dale Evans, Billy Graham, Colleen Townsend Evans, Jane Russell, Stuart Hamblen, Ronald Reagan and many others, in the living room of Henrietta Mears home, The group was chaplained by J.

This group, the Hollywood Christian Group is where Billy Graham met radio personality, Stuart Hamblen and other members of the Hollywood Christian Group including the Evanses, who visited Graham on location at the Los Angeles crusade. Up until this point, Graham was doing regional crusades successfully, but his numbers were not reaching the masses until Stuart Hamblen reported about Graham's crusades.

The march is dedicated to George Dewey, a U.S. Navy Admiral, and his actions during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, specifically the Battle of Manila Bay in 1898. Admiral George Dewey  Historical background  Dewey was given command of the Asiatic Squadron in 1897 and began preparing his squadron for war. Less than a year later, in April 1898, the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War began. The United States, fearing an attack from the Spanish, sent a fleet to the Philippines to destroy a Spanish flotilla in Manila Bay, commanded by Spanish Rear Admiral Patricio Montojo y Pasar√≥n. It was here when Dewey gave his famous order 'You may fire when ready, Gridley', to Captain Charles Vernon Gridley, the Commanding Officer of the flagship USS Olympia (C-6). Dewey and his fleet had a decisive victory, and \\"Montojo's fleet was destroyed, suffering 371 casualties compared to only 9 Americans wounded.\\" Following his victory in the Battle of Manila Bay, Dewey returned to the United States a war hero, with many musicians composing marches in his honor.  Helen Frances Phillips  Frances wrote her version of the march just four days after the Battle of Manila ended, and it was published on July 28th, 1898 by the Syracuse Post. Frances' composition is in the form of a march and two-step.  Marie Marguerite Points  Points' version of the march is called \\"Admiral Dewey's Grand March\\" and primarily features the piano. It was published by the Louis Grunewald Company on May 18th, 1898.  Herman Bellstedt  The cover page on Herman Bellstedt's version of the Admiral Dewey March says \\"Respectfully dedicated to Admiral George Dewey, U.S.N.\\" Bellstedt composed this piece in 1898 following the Battle of Manila Bay and played it with his famous Bellstedt band. He was also a \\"renowned cornet virtuoso\\". A copy can also be found in the Al Rose Collection, in Jones Hall at Tulane University.  Otto Bonnell  Published on June 7th, 1898 in Chicago, IL, Otto Bonnell's version of Admiral Dewey's March is primarily composed in piano. Bonnell's rendition of the march \\"was later introduced into the 1899 Broadway play, By the Sad Sea Waves, making it clear that the American public viewed Admiral Dewey as a hero during this time.  Samuel Lapin  Samuel Lapin composed his version of the Admiral Dewey March in a two-step and piano form. The cover page of Lapin's work, which was published on June 10th, 1898 by the Shonemen Brothers, is entitled \\"Respectfully Dedicated to the Heroes of the Asiatic Squadron\\".  William H. Santelmann  William H. Santelmann, a German-born musician, was the 19th Director of the United States Marine Band. He composed the Admiral Dewey March in 1898, and subsequently led the Marine Corps Band in orchestrating the piece. Additionally, \\"a ten-CD 'Bicentennial Collection' of the music of the U.S. Marine Band, which included the Berliner issue of the Santelmann, Admiral Dewey March, is available commercially\\".  Alva Van Riper  Riper also composed his march in 1898. There is currently a \\"copy of the sheet music in the David Soren Popular Sheet Music Collection, Box 1, Folder 1, Special Collections University of Arizona Libraries\\".

It was designed and built from 1834 to 1836 by David Lennox. It is also known as Lennox Bridge. The property is owned by Roads and Maritime Services, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 June 2000. Opened in 1836, the sandstone arch bridge it has the largest span of any extant masonry bridge in Australia. The bridge is also considered to be one of the finest examples of Colonial architecture in Australia.  History  Lansdowne bridge was designed and supervised by David Lennox. Born in Ayr, Scotland in 1788 David Lennox was trained as a stonemason. He worked on Telford's Menai Suspension Bridge at Anglesey in Wales and on Gloucester Bridge where he learnt the sound construction principles he used on his Colonial projects. He emigrated to Australia in 1832. He immediately found employment as a mason with the government. While working at the Legislative Council Chambers in Macquarie Street, Sydney, Lennox met the Surveyor-General Sir Thomas Mitchell. The Surveyor-General lost little time in submitting Lennox's credentials to the Governor, describing him as \\"a very well qualified person recently arrived in the Colony.\\" Acting on Mitchell's recommendation, Governor Bourke provisionally appointed Lennox as a Sub-Inspector of Bridges at a salary of A¬£120 per annum. In June 1833 the position was confirmed by London as Superintendent of Bridges. Lansdowne Bridge and Bowlers Bridge In 1832, the Surveyor-General at the time, Sir Thomas Mitchell, commissioned Lennox for a sum of A¬£1,083 to build a bridge at the intersection of Prospect Creek and Southern Street, which would replace the nearby \\"Bowler's Bridge\\" named after Lansdowne's local innkeeper. The sandstone used in designing the bridge was found in a quarry only from the proposed site of the bridge, allowing workers to row a punt to transport the stone to the construction site. In July 1833 Lennox told Mitchell of a mutiny that had occurred at the quarry while he had been away on an inspection tour. Some of the convicts had rebelled and had consumed the contents of a nearby liquor still. Returning to the camp drunk they threatened to kill the supervisor and destroy the camp and quarrying equipment. The police from Liverpool were called and arrested the offenders. Retribution at Liverpool Court was swift and savage; those who were spared the chain gang received up to fifty lashes of the \\"cat\\". On 1 January 1834, Governor Bourke visited the site of the bridge to lay the foundation stone. Within hours of the laying of the inscription plate it was stolen. Lennox made arrangements to obtain a duplicate plate but the original was found and restored to the bridge. The foundation stone was laid on 1 January 1834. The bridge was constructed entirely by unskilled Australian convicts, despite Lennox's numerous requests to Mitchell for skilled labourers. The bridge was completed a year later in 1835, and opened on 26 January 1836, the 48th anniversary of the Colony of New South Wales, before a crowd of around 1,000. Later, Richard Bourke, the Governor of New South Wales, wrote that the bridge had cost only A¬£1,000 to build, compared to the A¬£7,000 it would have taken to build a bridge of the same quality in England. On 7 June 1834 Lennox applied for more labourers, the bridge being at a stage where the centring could commence. This was the construction of a rigid timber frame to hold each stone in place until the arch became self-supporting. It was a critical process and any inaccuracies would cause instability or collapse the arch. Upon receiving a report that the bridge was nearing completion, Governor Bourke selected 26 January 1836 for the official opening date, as this coincided with the 48th anniversary of the Colony's foundation. The Lansdowne Bridge was not ready for several months as the Toll House was not complete. Once tolls started to be collected however, the bridge soon recovered its cost and in 1844 annual receipts were 685 pounds.George, 1982 In 1956, the New South Wales government duplicated the original bridge with a new concrete arch bridge parallel to the existing to carry southbound traffic of the Hume Highway.  Description  A large sandstone arched bridge spanning the Prospect Creek. The single arch has supporting buttresses. The clear span is 110 feet while the clearance above mean water level is 76 feet at the centre. It has curved abutments and approaches, while the parapets and mouldings are simple and devoid of unnecessary ornamentation. Some of the radiating voussoirs are quite large in size measuring up to eight feet in length. Legacy In 1973, Australia recognized Lansdowne Bridge for being \\"one of the finest examples of Colonial Architecture in Australia\\". In 1990, the Environmental Management Committee Fairfield Council confirmed that Lansdowne Bridge had the largest span of all masonry bridges in Australia and in 1992 that it was an example of excellent construction, which should be preserved. Lansdowne Bridge is also listed on the Register of the National Estate and on the National Historic Engineering Landmark list.  Heritage listing  As at 8 November 2000, Lansdowne Bridge is considered to be one of the finest examples of Colonial Architecture in Australia as well as David Lennox's masterpiece of design. Lansdowne Bridge was built by convicts during 1834 to 1836. The sandstone arch has the largest span of any surviving masonry bridge in Australia.

It suggests the universal genetic code originated not from a three-amino acid system, but from a four-amino acid system. It is this GNC code encoding [GADV]-proteins which is the most primitive genetic code. This hypothesis was first proposed by Kenji Ikehara at Nara Women's University. Details While almost all of the organisms on Earth share the universal genetic code, in the GNC hypothesis it is argued that two primeval genetic codes preceded the present genetic code as follows: * First, there emerged GNC primeval genetic codes involving 4 codons (GGC, GCC, GAC and GUC), which code 4 GADV-amino acids (glycine, alanine, aspartic acid and valine). * Second, GNC code evolved to SNS primeval genetic codes involving 16 codons (GGC, GGG, GCC, GCG, GAC, GAG, GUC, GUG, CUC, GUG, CCC, CCG, CAC, CAG, CGC and CGG), which code 10 amino acids (glycine, alanine, aspartic acid, valine, glutamic acid, leucine, proline, histidine, glutamine, arginine). The GNC hypothesis is based on the following facts: * Proteins composed of GADV-amino acids coded by GNC primeval genetic code can form four fundamental structures found in proteins in present organisms, namely, hydrophobic and hydrophilic structures, Œ±-helices, Œ≤-sheets, and turns (or coils). * Proteins composed of ten amino acids coded by SNS primeval genetic code can form six fundamental structures, namely, hydrophobic and hydrophilic structures, Œ±-helices, Œ≤-sheets, turns, acidic and basic fragments.

The Mohyal community is Hindu by identity, however, as consistent with the Hindu tradition, they have adopted none-Indic traditions. This has led to a small sub-set of the Moyhal community paying reverence to Islam, in particular, to some Sufi saints. Citing source from history of the Muhiyals, published in 1911 CE., it is disclosed that about 1,400 Brahmins had been living in Baghdad when the event of Karbala took place. There are various opinions regarding the origins of the community. About 125 families of Hussaini Brahmins are settled in Pune. A few families are settled in Delhi also and they observe Muharram every year.  The legend of Rahab Sidh Dutta (The Seven Sons of Datt)  Among various legends about Hussaini Brahmins, it is also described that a childless Dutt personally visited Hussain Ibn Ali and submitted his wish to have a child. As a response to his desire, he was informed that he had no child in his fate. Datt was upset by this, so the Imam prayed so that Datt could have a child. Suddenly someone observing the event questioned Hussain stating that he had challenged the will of Allah. Upon hearing this Imam told Dutt he will have one more child. This continued till Imam gave him good news of seven children. As per Mohyal oral history, a Mohyal of the Dutta clan had fought on behalf of Imam Hussain in the Battle of Karbala (680 C.E.), more specifically in the storming of Kufa- sacrificing his seven sons in the process.Mohyals, Muslims and Mustafabad\\". The Tribune, Chandigarh. 8 August 1993 According to legend, Rahab Sidh Dutta (also mentioned as Rahib Sidh or Sidh Viyog Datt in some versions) was the leader of a small band of career-soldiers living near Baghdad around the time of the battle of Karbala.Mahdi Nazmi (1984).

The film depicts the tragic family life of a stage actor who has retired from acting but is unable to forget his fond memories of theatre and the stage. It is directed by Mahesh Manjrekar and produced by Nana Patekar and Vishwas Joshi under the banner of Great Maratha Entertainment, Gajanan Chitra and Fincraft Media and Entertainment Pvt. Ltd. The film was officially released in India on 2016 New Year and became the highest-grossing film in Marathi cinema at the time, until Sairat occupied that place. The film was remade in Gujarati in 2018 as Natsamrat and being remade in Telugu as Rangamarthanda.https://m.timesofindia.com/entertainment/telugu/movies/news/prakash- raj-turns-into-an-ad-for-krishna-vamsis-ranga- marthanda/amp_articleshow/72521640.cms Plot The film is a tragedy about a Shakespearean veteran theatre actor Ganpat Ramchandra Belwalkar a.k.a. Appa (Nana Patekar) who has been an acclaimed theatre actor during his days, garnering fame and fortune by acting in plays based on various works, especially of William Shakespeare and he also won the award and the highest title of NAT-SAMRƒÄT (emperor of acting in theatre). Subsequently, Appa bequeaths all of his wealth to his children. He never keeps anything to himself and express his views very frankly. He does not mind adding expletives while expressing his views. Only his wife Kaveri (Medha Manjrekar), whom he fondly calls as 'Sarkar' and his close friend Rambhau (Vikram Gokhale) and are able to understand his nature. His daughter-in-law Neha (Neha Pendse) and son Makrand (Ajit Parab) do not seem to appreciate his frank nature, which at times causes embarrassing situations for them when they have guests or when their daughter hurls expletives in school. The high point in their relationship comes when their granddaughter performs a folk dance taught by Appa, which is not appreciated by her mother Neha. An argument follows between them and when they return home Neha slaps her daughter. Next day, Neha proposes to part ways with them by moving out, a ploy in which she anticipates Appa to grant them their space. Appa sees through her plan and decides to move out, while passing on a comment to his son \\"The whole world is a stage and unfortunately my part is a sad one.\\" Appa's wife Kaveri is very devoted to him and she does not question his decision. They move to their son-in-law and daughter Vidya's place. Appa continues with his carefree and frank ways, at times laden with few expletives. Their son-in-law, Rahul Barve (Sunil Barve) is a high ranking engineer in his company and is of a caring nature. Vidya (Mrunmayee Deshpande) also confronts similar embarrassing situations as Neha, but her husband Rahul does not seem to mind it. He appreciates Appa's poetry (To be or not to be, that is the question) and his fluent style of recitals. On Vidya's anniversary Appa comes in an inebriated state and embarrasses Rahul's boss. Although next day Appa apologizes, Rahul does not seem to mind it and discards as one off incident. Meanwhile, Appa remembers about his friend Rambhau and pays a visit to him. Rambhau is devastated after the demise of his wife Kumud. He lashes out at Appa for leaving him alone in his final days. The scene that follows is a heart touching conversation between Karna and Krishna enacted by Rambhau and Appa respectively while Rambhau is lying on his hospital bed. Mesmerized by Rambhau's performance and pitying his condition, Appa grants Rambhau his last wish. The next day Appa returns to his son in law's house. Kaveri tells Appa that Rambhau had overdosed on sleeping pills and that he is no more to which Appa confesses that he gave the pills to him implying that, it was his last wish. On another occasion Appa insults Rahul's boss's son when he could not stand his weak adaption of Othello. This irritates Vidya and she confronts her father. She makes their arrangement in her outhouse; however her husband still stands by Appa and regards this as a non-issue. Vidya makes sure that the outhouse is well maintained and they are taken good care. One fine day Vidya misplaces money given to her by her husband and in a turn of events, she blames her parents for stealing it. This creates a rift between them. Vidya realizes her mistake later when she finds the money. She apologizes to her parents but it is too late as Appa and Kaveri have already decided to move out. Vidya's husband Rahul is still sympathetic with her parents but cannot change their hearts. In that night, they escape from the outhouse for their ancestral village where they have an old house in a dilapidated state. On the way they halt at a village, where Kaveri dies of fever. Appa is destroyed by this loss. He is supported by a boot polishwala named Raja. Raja is extremely poor and a homeless person who lives with his family under a bridge. Appa is at times in delusional state and suffers from the fact that the grandeur with which he had lived through as an actor is now making his pain unbearable in his state of loneliness and poverty. Appa serves tea at a tea stall where he enthralls his customers with his poetry recitals and dialogue from his plays. A man named Siddharth(Sarang Sathaye), who has a respect and great fondness for acting, continuously follows Appa, since, for Siddharth, he is a noble actor and an idol. Appa hides his real identity from Siddharth and refuses to acknowledge that he is 'Natsamrat'. Siddarth, however continues with his conviction regarding Appa being the great actor. One day, Appa reads in the papers that his favorite theatre had burnt down in a fire. He goes there immediately and is completely shattered to see the theatre reduced to ashes. Siddharth also arrives there as he was following Appa. Here Appa starts reliving his old memories and also accepts Siddharth's claim that he is the real Natsamrat Ganpatrao when Siddharth reveals that he knew all about him and his past. His family and Raja also come there to find him. They request him to come home with him and to live with them but he refuses. The film ends magnificently albeit it has a tragic end. Appa is in a delusional state and shuffles between reality and the great personalities he had once portrayed as an actor on the very same stage. He gives his last performance on the theatre stage for Siddharth and says that, \\"Do you understand, dear Siddarth, this is what theatre acting is all about? To fulfill one's longing\\" He unexpectedly screams by placing a hand on his throat and collapses. Immediately everyone runs to hold him, but they find that he has already departed.

Description  The shell is divided into two valves that are hinged. Fusconaia flava shell is thick and can be compressed or inflated, has a triangular to an elongate triangle shape. Nacre (the inside layer of the shell) is white, but sometimes the nacre can be pink or salmon color.  Life cycle  Fusconaia flava males release sperm and the females collect the sperm through the incurrent siphon. The eggs are fertilized internally. Fusconaia flava has a parasitic larva stage called glochidia, the mussels use a lure to attract fish and then release the glochidia when the fish is close enough. The glochidia latch onto the gills or fins of the fish and remain there feeding of the blood of the fish until the glochidia reach the juvenile stage. Known host species for Fusconaia flava include silver shiner (Notropis photogenis) and creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus). Parent mussel provides no care once the glochidia are released. Fusconaia flava are filter feeders, waste is released through the excurrent siphon. They are sedentary creatures and are anchored to the substrate or buried in the substrate.  Habitat  Fusconaia flava can be found in lotic habitat anywhere from small streams to large rivers, and can handle various types of substrate including mud, sand, or gravel. Although Fusconaia flava is of least conservation concern, nineteen percent of Kentucky mussels have become extinct or extirpated from Kentucky due to habitat loss.

He also lectured on ornithology and ran for a various California political offices on the Socialist ticket. His first wife was East Bay architect Leola Hall. Early life and education Herbert Leonard \\"Curly\\" Coggins was born May 31, 1881, to Paschal H. and Caroline (Leonard) Coggins and grew up in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. His father was a lawyer who also wrote novels and stories for magazines like The Saturday Evening Post and The Atlantic Monthly, and his mother was active in the women's suffrage movement. He had a brother, Curtis W., and three sisters, Alice, Anna, and Edith I. His grandfather Paschal Coggins had been an editor of the Sacramento Union newspaper and a member of the state legislature. His great-uncle was the abolitionist businessman Passmore Williamson. In his high school years, Coggins met the ornithologist Witmer Stone, then curator of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences (ANS), which sparked a lifelong interest in ornithology. He joined the Audubon Society at the age of sixteen and gained much of his ornithological expertise on field trips with members of the society and other bird-watching clubs. As soon as he was old enough to do so, he joined the ANS, and he served as secretary of the Delaware Valley Ornithological Club. He would later join the American Ornithologists' Union, and serve as president of the Cooper Ornithological Club on the West Coast. In 1900, Coggins served as an assistant teacher in an ornithology course in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. Coggins briefly studied bookkeeping at a business college in Philadelphia. Career as editor Coggins's first job was as an errand boy and later manuscript reader for Penn Publishing Company, which put out the Horatio Alger and Betty Wales series of books for children. Around 1900, Coggins was promoted to running a children's magazine, Youth, which published poems (including an early one by Sinclair Lewis), short stories (including one by Lucy Maud Montgomery), and serialized versions of some of the company's books. After a few years, Coggins left and moved to San Francisco, California, shortly after the 1906 earthquake. There he got a job with Whitaker and Ray, a small-scale distributor of educational books and school supplies. As the editor in charge of their publishing department, he oversaw projects like issuing a set of lectures that Theodore Roosevelt had recently given in the Bay Area. Realizing that the firm was economically precarious, he left around 1912. Career as lecturer and writer Not long after Coggins arrived in California, he started giving talks on ornithology and continued to do so intermittently throughout the rest of his life. For one series of lectures at the University of California, he focused on economic ornithology, or the monetary value of birds to human culture. He also contributed to Cassinia, the journal of the Delaware Valley Ornithological Club. Coggins had a lively sense of humor; as Witmer Stone put it, he had \\"the gift of looking at a thing from all sides and he generally took his final stand on the comical side and the worst of it was, things that others looked upon as serious looked comical to him and it was often hard to prove that he was wrong.\\" Coggins wrote for The Atlantic Monthly, Collier's, and Vogue magazines, and some of his pieces for The Atlantic Monthly include humorous writing on such subjects as \\"how to catch burglars (in a bag) and how to enjoy paying taxes\\". For Collier's, he started a humorous series featuring animal protagonists, one of which‚Äîcentered on a beaver‚Äîwas turned into the children's book Busby & Co. (1952). Coggins wrote other books for children, including I Am a Mouse (1959). Political campaigns In 1913 and again a few years later, Coggins ran as the Socialist Party of America's candidate for mayor of Berkeley, losing both times. In 1917, he ran unsuccessfully as a Socialist for a seat on the Berkeley City Council. In 1924, he ran as a Socialist for a California seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, gaining only 8% of the vote in a contest won by Republican Albert E. Carter. Other businesses and personal life On June 11, 1912, Coggins married East Bay architect Leola Hall, settling down with her in a house she built for them, now known as \\"Honeymoon House\\". During this period, he first took over his father-in-law's cement contracting company, which he ran with Leola. As the post-earthquake building boom tapered off around 1914, he bought a stationery store and engraving business in Oakland. In the 1920s, he became a director and later the president of Patterson Parts, a San Francisco auto parts firm that had been founded by a fellow Socialist. He held this position for many decades. Some years after Leola's death in 1930, Coggins remarried; his second wife, Elsie (Shirpser) Coggins, had been his assistant at Ray and Whitaker many years earlier. Coggins died in December, 1974, a year after his wife. Books *I Am a Mouse (1959; illustrations by Judith Brook) *Busby & Co.

It stars Kola Oyewo, Bukky Wright, Lere Paimo, Larinde Akinleye, Peter Fatomilola, Kunle Bamtefa, Adebayo Faleti, Kayode Olaiya and Doyin Hassan. Saworoide depicts the setting of an old Yoruba norm in the town of Jogbo where a person can not be crowned king without a ritual which involves the playing of saworoide (English: brass bell talking drum). Plot Opens in an ancient time in the town of Jogbo. The priest tells the king that there will be a pact between the citizens of Jogbo and their kings, using a brass bell in the ritual process, and that the ritual process would also be carried out of succeeding Kings. A new king, Lapite (Kola Oyewo) has just been elected in Jogbo; there's been a long-standing saying that kings of Jogbo don't get to be influential and wealthy as kings of other territories. Lapite finds out from his friend and Chief, Balogun (Lere Paimo) that it is due to the old tradition of rituals made to kings, and as a result Lapite cheats the process. Balogun however later learns from the same elderly man who told him, that anyone who cheats the process faces the consequences of sharing his kingship with someone else, and that if he ever listens to the Saworoide (brass bell) being played, he would die of headache. Lapite as a result sends assassins to kill the family of Adebomi, who he considers to be threat (but they however didn't kill their kid), and also orders the capture of the custodian of Saworoide, Ayangalu (Ayantunji Amoo), along with his drum. Ayangalu is however tipped off by one of the chiefs and he escapes together with Adeboro's son, leaving behind Saworoide to be captured. The new king takes another wife, Tinuola (Bukky Wright), who's already pregnant for her lover, but has been advised to keep it a secret so as not to lose the life changing opportunity of being a queen. Lapite connives with modern investors to start mass exploration of the town's resources, particularly Logging, and nonchalantly destroying people's crops in the process. The Chiefs and King start to live a life of opulence, silencing the press by all means. Lapite also refuses to listen to the citizens of Jogbo who constantly stage protests against the goings on. As a result, militancy arises amongst the farm owners and they start to attack the workers on their farms, which led to the workers going on strike. Lapite starts going against members of his cabinet, making arrests and becoming a tyrant. Some members of the farm owners' association consult the town priest, Amawomaro (Peter Fatomilola) and they are told that the only way out is to make sure the Ad√© id·∫π (Brass Crown) is absent from the palace for 15 days. The militants seek external help; one of the logging firms gives funds, but secretly to use them naively for their own interest. They stage several attacks such as hijacking a ceremony to steal the king's crown, which is later recovered with the help of the logging firms after being given a bribe. Aresejabata (Kunle Afolayan) starts to make friends with Araparegangan (Kabirat Kafidipe) the supposed daughter of Lapite. He opens up to her that while tipsy, that he is the son of Adebomi that was killed. Lapite finds out and orders the assassination of Aresejabata, not minding Arapa being killed in the process. Tinuola overhears and tells her daughter to run away along with Arese from the gathering and the village. The military stages a successful coup, killing Lapite; Officer Lagata (Kunle Bamtefa) takes over the government of Jogbo. Balogun and Seriki (Larinde Akinleye) again liaise with the new government. The former militants plan to kill the new king by making Ayangalu, who has been in exile to play the Saworoide in Jogbo. One of the militants betray them and Ayangalu is arrested. Ayangalu has however used his drum to call on his son just before he is arrested. His son, Ayanniyi (Segun Oni) returns and plays the Saworoide just after Lagata is crowned, and he subsequently dies of Migraine. The soldiers are hypnotized to be on the side of the people, Aresejabata is crowned king.

For his performance, Giuseppe Battiston won the Nastro d'Argento for Best Supporting Actor. The film was also nominated for the Nastro d'Argento for best comedy film. Plot  Arrogant and unscrupulous pasta factory owner Alfonso Tammaro tells his workers Enzo, Carmine and Bandula, that the factory will close and that they are laid off. When they ask if they can work in his new factory, he tells them he doesn't need them since it's completely automated. They are hard put to make ends meet, but Enzo's wife Aurora, who has been hired by Tammaro as a translator, convinces Tammaro to hire them as security guards at the old factory, which he now uses to store his latest enthusiasm, modern art. They find the art bizarre and the prices outrageously high. When Carmine accidentally breaks one of the artworks, they realize they have to create a duplicate, and find it surprisingly easy. Angry at Tammaro and desperate to improve their prospects, they decide to create duplicates and leave them for Tammaro, while selling the originals. They achieve some early success and become more ambitious. They travel to Rome to meet with a buyer who isn't too fussy about how they came into possession of such pieces, and Enzo is taken for a great new sensation in the art world. Put on the spot by a wealthy patron, he creates a new work by tracing the woman's hand with a pen and adding whatever bits of color he finds handy. For this \\"original\\" she gives him 1000‚Ç¨. Alas, just when they have finished recreating an entire collection of modern art, the scheme goes awry. After they have switched their fakes for the genuine artworks, but before they can sell the real ones, Tammaro closes down the operation and sends the (fake) collection to Rome for auction. Terrified at being found out and sent to prison, they confess what they have done to Aurora, who helps them come up with a plan to undo their fraud by switching the art pieces at the auction site. They are unable to complete the swap, and are astonished to learn that in the world of modern art, it doesn't even matter. The film ends with them once again completely broke, except for the 1000‚Ç¨ Enzo made for his hand tracing, which they end up giving to Bandula so he can attend his daughter's wedding back in India.

Its best-known wares are the \\"canes of Apizaco\\" (really from San Esteban Tizatlan), sawdust carpets and the making of Saltillo-style serapes. However, there are other handcraft traditions, such as the making of pottery, including Talavera type wares, cartoneria, metalworking and stone working. The state supports artisans through the activities of the Fideicomiso Fondo de la Casa de las Artesan√≠a de Tlaxcala (Handcrafts House of Tlaxcala Fund and Trust) Socioeconomic significance Tlaxcala is Mexico's smallest and most densely populated entity outside of the Mexico City metropolitan area. A significant portion of the state's handcraft production is done in small villages, and in indigenous communities such as Ixtenco, San Isidro Buensuceso and Tetlahnocan. There are two crafts that are best known from the state, the making of ephemeral sawdust carpets for certain religious celebrations, especially in Huamantla and the making of wooden canes in San Esteban Tizatl√°n. However, there are a variety of crafts made in the state from textiles, to pottery to stone work and more. Much of which has not been widely documented. The state entity charged with promoting and preserving Tlaxcalan handcrafts is the Fideicomiso Fondo de la Casa de las Artesan√≠a de Tlaxcala (Handcrafts House of Tlaxcala Fund and Trust). It established and runs the Museo Vivo de Artes y Tradiciones Populares del Estado (Living Museum of Folk Arts and Traditions), located in a former state office building. Its main objective is to document the development and status of the state's handcraft traditions. Its permanent collection is in six halls and includes a Child Jesus of ayacahuite wood, with glass eyes and movable limbs; various articles for the making of pulque, Otomi traditional garb, pottery and musical instruments called salterios. It also has exhibits dedicated to various traditions and celebrations. The Trust also sponsored contests for state artisans, such as the Concurso Estatal de Arte Popular Tlaxcala (Tlaxcala State Folks Art Contest), as well as a \\"Day of the Artisan\\" in late June. There are also handcraft exhibitions at the annual Feria de Tlaxcala (Tlaxcala State Fair). Santa Ana Chiautempan hosts the annual National Serape Fair in late July. In 2015, the governor of the state traveled to Rome to promote the state's handcrafts to the Vatican. Wood working Modern work working techniques were introduced by the Spanish, and along with furniture, a number of smaller wood items are made. The best known wood item is a kind of walking cane which is made in the town of San Esteban Tizatlan. Despite the origin, these canes are generally known as the \\"walking canes of Apizaco\\" because the arrival of the railroad to this town allowed the ir marketing in the larger city, popularizing them. Characteristic of these canes is the carving, which is complemented by different colors of wood and varnish and sometimes burning to add decorative motifs, which are often of pre Hispanic origin. Today, about eighty families depending on woodworking for a living, but the popularity of the canes has made the tlaxistle tree (Amelanchier denticulata), from which they are traditionally made, to become endangered. This has prompted a switch to sabine (sp.Juniperus) wood, but it is not as flexible and requires that the head be worked separately from the body. In addition to the canes, the town makes wooden bats, decorated in a similar fashion, and items of cedar and ayacahuite such as toys, chess sets, letter openers, furniture and religious figures for altars. Another important item is drum called teponaxtle, made from a hollowed log. In San Pablo Apetatitl√°n, there is a neighborhood called Tlatempa, noted for the making of religious figures from ayacahuite, with glass eyes and movable extremities. They are also noted for the making of traditional masks for Carnival and other festivities. These masks generally portray Europeans as Carnival was a time that allowed the indigenous to poke fun of the conquistadors. One noted family for this work is that of Pedro Reyes, which has made these masks for generations. The men shape the wood and the women paint and decorate. Each mask takes about 26 hours of work, making its price above what poor people can pay.Mostly of European faces for dances such as the Huehues. Jesus Tlatempan is also noted for the making of wood masks for Carnival and religious images which are painted in oils. The capital of the state has a neighborhood called Santiago Atlzayanca which makes furniture along with a stringed musical instrument called a salterios, a medieval instrument introduced by the Spanish. Calpulapan also makes musical instruments, generally of ebony, oak, walnut and other hard woods. The most common instruments are guitars, violins, vihuelas and requintos. Textiles Textiles in the state have a history that dates back well into the pre Hispanic period, and which was well-developed before the arrival of the Spanish. These textiles had complicated designs and were dyed in various colors using resources such as cochineal and a purple dye made from snails from Oaxaca. The best of these were generally made as offerings to the gods. The Spanish introduced the working of new materials such as wool and silk. In the late colonial period into the era of the railroad, textile production consolidated onto haciendas then factories, a number of which became known for their work such as La Trinidad, San Luis, Santa Elena and La Estrella. However, the development of industrial textiles production never completely displaced more traditional methods. The best known handcrafts of the state are the textiles produced in the villages around Santa Ana Chiautempan and San Bernardino Contla, which are marketed through Santa Ana. These are made in family workshops which may have pedal looms or more modern electric looms. Commercial dyes are used as well as some natural dyes such as those made from indigo and walnut. Many of these products are sold on the beaches and other tourist attractions of Mexico, as well as in the state itself. These wares include serapes, rebozos, sweaters of a design called Chiconcuac, jackets, capes, gloves and hats made of wool. The most traditional and high-quality pieces are made from 100% wool, generally made to order, but most of the rest of the production has deteriorated, with the substitution of synthetic fibers for some of all of the wool or cotton. The most recognizable product is the Saltillo-style serape, despite the state's distance from this northern Mexican city. The reason for this was that the Spanish resettled many Tlaxcalan indigenous families north to help with the colonization process. Both Santa Ana Chiautempan and San Bernardino Contla make them, and generally are of wool or cotton. One notable artisan from just outside Santa Ana Chiautempan is Guadalupe Ixcotla, who specializes not in weaving, but in the creation of hand-knitted tapestries, made on vertical frames. These works generally have landscape motifs. San Juan Ixtenco is noted for its pepenado embroidery, which consists of fine points arranged to form figures, especially on blouses. These can be done with or without the addition of beads, into floral and geometric motifs. Huamantla produces carrying bags of various types, belts, tablecloths and rebozos, often of macram√©. The city also makes distinctive garments for the image of Our Lady of Charity (Virgen de la Caridad) decorated in an embroidery style called canutillo de oro. These are not for sale but can be seen at the museum dedicated to the image. San Isidro Buensuceso is noted for embroidery done by sewing machine. Other textile producing communities include San Francisco Tetlanohcan, San Francisco Tepeyanco, Zitlaltepec, Panotla and Yauhquemecan. Sawdust carpets Sawdust carpets are arrangements of colored sawdust, flower petals and sometimes other plant matter to create decorative \\"paintings\\" over a stretch of road in preparation for a procession. It is an ephemeral craft as it is meant to be destroyed as the procession passes. Its origins are from the pre Hispanic period, and the best-known creation of this craft in the state is in the city of Huamantla, for the feast of the image of Our Lady of Charity (Virgen de la Caridad). However, other towns in Tlaxcala also make them, such as San Vicente Xiloxochitla and San Juan Totolac for Day of the Dead. Ceramics Tlaxcala is not one of Mexico major pottery producers, with much made for local consumption, but there is some notable production. One notable feature of much of this production is that it has maintained at least some characteristics from the pre Hispanic period. San Sebastian Atlapa makes what is known as Ocotlan pottery, as they are mostly sold in this town. It is a simple, red-colored pottery which comes burnished and unburnished to make duck figures, water jugs and containers for other liquids using neither molds or potters' wheels. They come in different shapes including that of animals and usually have striated decoration. San Salvador Tzompantepec is noted for making comals, cooking pots, including those decorated with incisions in the surface, flowerpots, pi√±atas and more. This pottery is left in its natural reddish color in two classes, barro rojo and barro bru√±ido. The later is burnished and principally used for storing liquids. Most of the pieces are made either molds or with the use of a potters' wheel. In San Damian Texoloc makes pottery heavily influenced by that which was made in the sites of Xochitecatl and Cacaxtla. Hueyotlipan makes both glazed and unglazed wares, which are usually large pots to cook mole, as well as other cooking vessels and pitchers. Lebrillos also makes glazed wares, for mole and rice. La Trinidad Tenexyecac is known for its glazed wares, making various types of cooking pots and pitchers, which sizes ranging from miniatures to very large pieces. These pieces are called \\"barro oxidado\\" (rusted clay) due to the color of the glaze. They also make clay figures and jewelry pieces. San Pablo del Monte is known for its Talavera ceramics, making dishes, cups, tiles, large storage vessels called tibors, vases, flowerpots, ashtrays and more. These wares are generally molded and after a coating of the pottery's tradition white background glaze, are painted in various colors, which differs somewhat from the Talavera wares produced in neighboring Puebla. Other ceramic producing communities include Panotla, Zitlaltepec de Trinidad Santos, Ixtacuixtla de Mariano Matamoros and Tlaxcala. Other handcrafts Stone work is done in the San Miguel neighborhood of San Pable del Monte, including working with black marble and onyx to make figures of animals such as bulls, horses, fish birds and more. It is also used to make human figures, bookends, jewelry, chess sets and more. Other communities which do similar work include Santa Cruz Tlaxcala, Tetla, Totolac and San Martin Xaltocan. San Martin Xaltocan specializes in gray, pink and green sandstone to make fountains, columns, table bases, large pots, monuments and more. Various communities make items from stiff fibers. Two communities noted for their basketry are San Vicente Xiloxochitla and Santa Apolonia Tlacalco. In El Carmen Tequexquitla and San Pablo del Monte they make images from popotillo, along with objects made of palm fronds and chairs with wicker seats. Santa Anita Nopalucan makes petates from palm and ixtle. In San Juan Ixtenco, they make images by arranging various beans and seeds such as those from corn, lentils, rice and more. Originally done to make religious images to place in the church on certain occasions, the seeds are also used to make secular images such as landscapes and even portraits of famous artists. This work is also done in Zitlaltepc de Trinidad Sanchez Santos. In the Escuela de Plater√≠a (Silver School) in Tlaxco they reproduce colonial era jewelry and other silver items, using the lost wax method. The jewelry can be accented with quartz, amethyst, coral and other semi-precious stones, with motifs such as crosses, birds, keys and fruit. Rosario Ocotoxco in the Yauhquemecan municipality makes bells in bronze and other metals. Tzompantepec makes wrought iron candelabras, figures, frames and more. Paper flowers are made in San Miguel Xochitecatitla for Christmas, and are made in Panotla. Santa Maria Atlihuetzia makes decorative flowers and figurines. Huamantla makes objects with amate paper. San Gabriel Popocatla, Tlatempan and Ixtlacuixtla make cartoneria into alebrijes, pi√±atas, masks, flowers, religious and secular figures. San Cosme Xalostoc, Acuamanala, Panotla and San Antonio Cuaxomulco make fireworks. Espa√±ita makes leather goods, especially belts and bags called toros, used in the fermentation of pulque. The community is also known for work with dried corn husks, used to make figures for nativity scenes, dolls, flowers and other figures in Espa√±ita. Terrenate makes candles in the shape of animals, plants and fruits, which are often perfumed. References Mexican folk art Handcrafts and folk art .

It supports asylum in Germany, in Europe and worldwide.  Working fields  Pro Asyl helps refugees individually in situations in which they need support, including legal consulting and representation in the court, if necessary all the way up to Germany's Constitutional Court or the European Court of Human Rights. The organization also does political lobbying for the rights of refugees by launching campaigns and taking part in panel and TV discussions. Politically, they strive for \\"a humane society, open towards foreigners.\\" In 2004, Pro Asyl and partner organizations from seven Central European countries founded the European Refugee Fund-funded Information and Cooperation Forum (ICF), where Pro Asyl is Lead Agency for Medical Care and Therapy. The organization is a member of the European Council on Refugees and Exiles (ECRE) and closely cooperates with the UNHCR and other international human rights organizations. With their pan-European network of correspondents, Pro Asyl conducts analysis and surveys about refugees' situation both in their countries of origin and on their escape routes and intermediate stopovers.  Positions  ; on the Residenzpflicht In the past, Pro Asyl has waged nationwide campaigns against a legal requirement for refugee status applicants and those with a deportation deferment, the so-called Residenzpflicht, requiring them not to leave their local office's district often for years, until in January 2015 it was limited to the first three months, and often altogether abolished. ; on Safe origin countries The organization has always criticized the steady expansion of the government-designated list of \\"safe origin countries\\" as institutionalized discrimination, as it deprives citizens of more and more non-EU countries, including Kosovo, Senegal and Ghana, of their right to receive an individual evaluation of their individual protective rights. During the 2015 European migrant crisis Pro Asyl representative Marei Pelzer criticised the coalition member CSU party of diffusing \\"cheap propaganda at the expense of the refugees,\\" that was \\"designed to put the wind in the sails of far-right populists,\\" thereby contributing to the social climate that led to numerous xenophobic attacks on refugees and their shelters.

These were the biggest locomotives ever built by the Ferrovie dello Stato, even though not the fastest, which were the Class 691s. Design and construction The Class 746 originated from the need of a fast locomotive that, while having similar performance to the 'Pacific' Class 690, could have a lower axle load and therefore wider route availability; this could be achieved by adding another driving axle, and accepting a lower top speed (reverting to a leading Italian bogie). To achieve high performance, it was decided to adopt a symmetric compound engine (a Von Borries design), with the two inside high pressure (HP) cylinders having the motion for their valves derived from the outside Walschaerts valve gear; this was unusual for Italian locomotive practice, where the compound engine had been shelved once the superheating technology had become available in the 1910s. Forty locomotives were ordered to the Ernesto Breda, which produced them in 1922, and then ten more in 1926; Gio. Ansaldo & C. built ten more, fitted with Caprotti valve gear, in the same years. The latter were initially classified as Class 747, but in 1930 they were reclassified as the 746.100-110 subclass. Operations and modifications The Class 746 initially operated on the Milan-Bologna- Florence-Rome-Naples main line; after portion of it were electrified, they served on the Milan-Turin and the Milan-Brescia railways. In the 1960s they were operating in Sicily and on the Adriatic coast railway (based at Ancona shed), until their withdrawals, which were concluded by 1967. While fast, powerful and suitable for both fast passenger and goods trains, the Class 746 proved difficult to start and somewhat uneasy when running at or close to its top speed (with both problems originating from its compound engine); also, at higher speeds the low-pressure cylinders contributed relatively little to the locomotive's power output. The locomotives fitted with Caprotti valve gear also turned out to have problems when functioning in reverse. Their poor riding qualities and their huge mass (for Italian standards) led some Milanese crews to nickname them \\"Krassin\\". In 1930 all the locomotives were modified with improved draughting. In 1932 four locomotives, two with Walschaerts valve gear (the 746.007 and the 046) and two with Caprotti valve gear (the 746.107 and the 108), were modified with a simple-expansion engine; while results were very encouraging, with the modified locomotives being as performant as the unmodified ones but performing better at higher speeds, the widespread electrification meant that this experiment was not followed up with more conversions. Preservation Two Class 746 locomotives survive into preservation: the 746.031, a static exhibit in the Museo della Scienza e della Tecnologia \\"Leonardo da Vinci\\" in Milano, and the 746.038, long preserved in the FS workshop of Verona and recently moved to Pistoia, to await a possible restoration.

Penick (born 1944) is an American professor of science education who has taught in high schools, community college, and at several universities in the United States and abroad. Author of more than 200 articles in professional journals and 40 books and monographs, Penick is best known for promoting innovative programs and processes for enhancing undergraduate teacher education.Yager, R. E. and Penick, J. E. (1990). Science education. Chapter 36 of Houston, R. E. (Ed.) Handbook of Research on Teacher Education Many of his innovations were based on his studies of exemplary teachers in the United States, studies that focused on determining the roles of effective teachers.Penick, J. E., Yager, R. E., and Bonnstetter, R. (October, 1986). Teachers make exemplary programs. Educational Leadership, 44(2), 14-20 In addition to his work with undergraduates, Penick has conducted workshops and presentations for teachers in almost every state of the U.S., speaking about and demonstrating how research can inform teacher practice and conditions.Penick, J.E. and Harris, R.L. (2005). Teaching with Purpose. Arlington VA: NSTA Press. 66 pages Widening his scope, Penick has worked extensively with a variety of international universities, ministries of education, and organizations in 35 countries. Education Penick received his B.S. in zoology and chemistry (1966) and his M.A. in biology education (1969) from the University of Miami. He received his Ph.D. in Science Education from The Florida State University in 1973. At Florida State he was mentored by Professor Dorothy M. Schlitt, known for her innovative ideas related to science teacher education. At Florida State, Penick was also significantly influenced by Professors Charles Matthews and Ron Good. While at Florida State Penick met fellow student James A. Shymansky, with whom he would continue to work for many years. Professional career Following his graduation in 1973, Penick became assistant professor at Loyola University of Chicago, where he taught and was Director of Teacher Education in his second year. In 1975 Penick left Loyola for the University of Iowa, where his classmate, James A. Shymansky, had been for two years. At Iowa, Penick was promoted to Associate Professor (1977) and Professor (1982) and eventually was named Department Chair (1982). While at Iowa, Penick worked closely with Vincent Lunetta in developing and expanding a preservice science teacher education program, initially funded by the National Science Foundation, called Iowa UPSTEP.Penick, J. E. and Lunetta, V. N. (Autumn, 1980). Iowa-UPSTEP: A dynamic model in science teacher education now. The Teacher Educator, 16(1), 14-18Penick, J. E. and Yager, R. E.

Journal of Teacher Education, 39(6), 59‚Äì64 During Penick's years at the University of Iowa, the department of science education was noted as being large, dynamic, and highly productive of scholarly publications and outstanding students at every level. In 1985 he was a senior Fulbright Scholar at the University of Lisbon (Portugal) and The Technion (Haifa, Israel). After more than 22 years at the University of Iowa, Penick was named Head of the Department of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Education at North Carolina State University. As Department Head, Penick emphasized research productivity and hired a number of new faculty members. During his more than 10 years as Head, the value of grants obtained by his department grew significantly and his department grew in research productivity. Following his retirement from NC State in 2009, Penick accepted a position as Director for Research and Development at Sangari do Brasil, in S√£o Paulo Brazil. With the creation of Sangari USA, Penick became vice president for research and development of the American subsidiary. He retired from Sangari in 2011 and currently resides in Miami Florida. Honors and offices Active academically, Penick has been or is on the editorial boards of a number of journals. Penick has received formal recognition from a number of groups, including the Association for Science Teacher Education (ASTE), which has presented him with its Outstanding Research award (1976, with James A. Shymansky), Outstanding Mentor award (1997), and named him Outstanding Science Educator in 1987. Penick was elected president of ASTE in 2002-2003. The National Science Teachers Association (NSTA), of which he was president in 2003-2004, awarded him with several awards before naming him to receive the Robert H. Carleton award, its highest honor, in 2013. President of the National Association of Biology Teachers in 1989, he has also received its highest award, Honorary Membership. Epsilon Pi Tau, the national honorary for technology education presented Penick with a Distinguished Service Citation in 2003 for his contributions to technology education. In 1987 and again in 2015, the Florida State University College of Education presented him with the Distinguished Educator award, its highest award, for his contributions to education. Early life Born while his father, Edgar C. Penick Jr., was stationed at Langley Virginia during WW II, young John lived in Austin Texas prior to his family moving to Miami Florida in 1947, where, like many others, he dreamed of being the undersea explorer, Jacques Cousteau. After earning his B.S., Penick finished a year of graduate work there in Zoology before becoming a high school biology and chemistry teacher at Miami Jackson Senior High School. After his master's degree, Penick taught one summer at Miami-Dade Community College before being named department head at Miami Jackson. During the 1972-73 school year, he taught high school biology at the Florida State University lab school, with Professor Dorothy Schlitt, Sharyl Bender, and Judy Lewis . A 1978 article describes the innovations they implemented during that experience. Family Penick married his high school sweetheart, Nell Inman in 1966 and, after she taught English at Jackson High School for three years, they had two children, Lucas (1969) and Megan (1973). Nell Inman Penick received her Ph.D. in Counseling and Human Development from the University of Iowa in 1990 and had a private practice for marriage and family therapy for 20 years in Iowa and North Carolina, Lucas is a private teacher and tutor, primarily in science and mathematics, in Miami and Megan is an attorney in New York City.

Five of the barrows were destroyed by ironstone quarrying in 1959; the remaining six are scheduled monuments. The sites have been placed on the Heritage at Risk Register. Location The cemetery is located on Ponton Heath, an area of high ground several miles south of the market town of Grantham. It is centred approximately northeast of the hamlet of Hungerton and southwest of the village of Stroxton. The centre of the area is occupied by the backfilled remains of an ironstone quarry which was active from the 1950s to the 1970s; this activity was responsible for the destruction of five barrows in 1959. Of the surviving monuments, Barrow A is located to the north of the former works, on the parish boundary between Wyville cum Hungerton and Little Ponton and Stroxton. The remaining five, Barrows B, C, F, G and H, are located on the south side of the site. A low mound, possibly a 12th barrow, is located between and slightly to the north of Barrows C and F. Description The surviving barrows are all located on arable farmland which is ploughed and under crop. They are only visible as slight ridges in the ground no more than high. Due to the danger of them being ploughed out, the sites have been placed on the Heritage at Risk Register. Excavations and investigations In 1959, following the opening of Harlaxton Quarry No. 4 (or Hungerton Quarry), a rescue excavation was carried out by Ernest Greenfield of the Ministry of Works. He arrived to find much of the topsoil already stripped from the site and several of the barrows pillaged. In Barrow J he found an intact main burial chamber containing a crushed red collared urn, decorated with cord impressions, inverted over burned bone. He also found numerous secondary cremations and stone tools, leading him to classify the builders as the \\"Yorkshire Food Vessel Culture\\" in the terminology of the time. The site also contained evidence of later Romano-British occupation. Examination of topsoil removed from the destroyed portion of the site yielded fragments of Roman Samian and grey ware pottery. The urn from Barrow J was conveyed to the Lincoln Museum; other artifacts were deposited with the Grantham Museum. Fieldwalking of the area west of Barrow A in the 1960s and 70s also turned up a large scatter of stone tools, and a child's bronze bracelet dated to the Roman era.

He went to Russia many times and learnt to speak Russian. But his business interests suffered badly as a result of the Revolution. This meant a visit to his bankers in London, where the bank official he met was TS Eliot. This is said to have given reference to the poet's reference in The Waste Land to \\"a silk hat on a Bradford millionaire\\". Nevertheless, when his family sold the business (which failed to prosper thereafter) in 1920, it was for the sum of ¬£2,000,000, a remarkably large sum in those days. The public life of Roberts was also distinguished. In 1897 he became a member of Shipley Urban District Council, eventually becoming chairman of that council. He was also a member of the West Riding County Council and a Justice of the Peace. In 1909 he was created a baronet in the King's Birthday Honours. He was a keen advocate of free trade and was the first chairman of the West Riding Free Trade Federation. He endowed a leaving scholarship at Bingley Grammar School and the chair of Russian at Leeds University. He also bought Haworth Parsonage, which was opened to visitors in 1928 as the Bront√´ Parsonage Museum. There is a Roberts Street in central Bradford and a Roberts Park in Saltaire. Later life Roberts retired to the south of England, whilst also maintaining Strathallan Castle in Scotland. He died in 1935. He was buried in Fairlight in East Sussex.

He spent the hard-earned money on field trips to European art centers at the time: France, Austria, Hungary, Germany and Poland. Toots' atelier was located in cinema Apollo, that was close to Pallas Art School. Joining the academy had been a dream of his until September 1937, when he started his studies there.  Studies in Pallas  Toots had a unique opportunity to study with and from some of the greats of Estonian fine art. He practiced printmaking under the guidance of Arkadio Laigo and Roman Vaher. R. Vaher had studied in Hochschule f√ºr Grafik und Buchkunst Leipzig. He established a close connection with Toots, as he was also interested in calligraphy. Toots' teachers also included Aleksander Vardi and Kaarel Liimand. Toots left Pallas before graduating in 1939.  Moving to Tallinn  During the last year of World War II in 1945 Villu Toots moved to Tallinn to focus more on book design. The best printing house in Tartu had been destroyed by the war, therefore publishing had been moved to the capital. For seven years Toots worked as an art director in two publishing houses.RR Ia, f 5, n 1, s 3, l 1‚Äì5 There he learned more about different printing methods and book architecture, but also about the restrictions of the soviet regime. For two years he was the leading designer of Eesti Naine (Estonian Woman) magazine. From 1952 until his death, Toots worked as a freelance artist. The only exception was in 1965‚Äì1966, when he worked as an art director in the National Committee of Cinematography.  Calligraphy School  Since 1946 Villu Toots had been teaching calligraphy in different seminars.Toots 1981: 5‚Äì6 Calligraphy had suddenly become more popular and there was a need for a thorough form of study. Also the Tallinn State Applied Art Institute of the ESSR could not fulfil the demand for artistic writing. In 1965 Toots established a calligraphy school named Kirjakunsti Kool with a three-year course. Students came from all over Estonia and applications were sent from far ends of the Soviet Union. Toots was the initiator, the head and only teacher in the one-man school. Studies took place in the evenings. In 1986 Toots gave his position to Heino Kivihall ‚Äì one of his best students. As of 2015 Heino Kivihall is still teaching calligraphy in the same institution kultuur.ee/kursus/kalligraafiastuudio/ also in the Tallinn School of Calligraphy. Other well-known students of Kirjakunsti Kool also include Villu J√§rmut, Ilmar Vallikivi, Henno K√§o, Emil Lausm√§e, Rein Maantoa, Arvo P√§renson, Ain Kaasik and many others.  Publications  One of his greatest contributions to the Estonian culture are his books on calligraphy and type design, that also give insight to the history of writing, different scripts and typefaces. His book \\"T√§nap√§eva kiri\\" (1956) was adapted and remade for Latvian readers as \\"300 burtu veidi. 300 —à—Ä–∏—Ñ—Ç–æ–≤\\" (1960) and for Russians as \\"C–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π —à—Ä–∏—Ñ—Ç\\" (1966). He has also published collections of his best calligraphy works. American calligraphy magazine Scribe dedicated their issue of winter 1978 and spring 1979 to the works of Villu Toots.http://calligraphyonline.org/wordpress/wp- content/uploads/2014/10/theScribeIndex.pdf Toots in his home studio in 1963 Books *\\"√ïpime plakatkirja.

He had connections in almost 30 different countries, including Australia, Brazil, Hong Kong, Iceland and Japan. First distant acquaintances were colleagues from Moscow: Solomon Telingater, Vadim Lazurski, Pavel Kuzanyan and Maxim Shukow. Contacting outside of the Soviet Union started in 1954 with a calligrapher from Bruges, Jef Boudens, who was seeking help for writing books. German typographer Albert Kapr turned to Toots with a similar request. Through Kapr Toots became friends with Hermann Zapf, one of the leading typographers in the world. Villu Toots also kept friendly ties with Donald Jackson, official scribe and calligrapher to the Crown Office of United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  Personal  Villu Toots married Ann Leesalu on January 18, 1941. They have a daughter Tiiu Sarv. In 1991 the couple celebrated their golden wedding anniversary. Villu Toots died on April 10, 1993.

Facts The HS2 Action Alliance, Buckinghamshire County Council, Hillingdon London Borough Council, and Heathrow Hub Ltd claimed that the Secretary of State should have done a strategic environmental assessment under Directive 2001/42 before the government's 'Next Steps' Command Paper on HS2. This proposed a hybrid bill procedure in Parliament for constructing the High Speed 2 railway from London to Birmingham (phase 1), and then on to Manchester as well as Sheffield and Leeds (phase 2). The plaintiffs argued the Directive should be interpreted in line with the Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters 1998 (the Aarhus Convention 2001) art 7. They also argued that a hybrid bill procedure did not comply with the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive 2011/92/EU because the party whipped the vote, and limited opportunity to examine the information in Parliament. This was argued to fail the test for proper public participation under EIAD 2011 article 6(4).

A granddaughter of the novelist Germaine de Sta√´l, she was considered independent, liberal, and outspoken. Her 1845 portrait by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, which took three years to complete, has been exhibited in the Frick Collection in New York City since the 1930s.  Early life and family  Titled from birth (as was the custom in her father's aristocratic family) as Louise Albertine, Princess de Broglie, she was the daughter of statesman and diplomat Victor de Broglie, 3rd Duke de Broglie and Albertine, Baroness Sta√´l von Holstein. She was the oldest of three children to survive to adulthood;Munhall, Edgar. Ingres and the Comtesse d'Haussonville, New York: The Frick Collections, 1985. 241 pp. her brother Albert would inherit the de Broglie ducal title and achieve political and literary renown, while her youngest brother Auguste, the future Abb√© de Broglie, would pursue an ecclesiastical career. Through her mother, Louise was the granddaughter of famed saloniste and novelist Germaine de Sta√´l, better known as Madame de Sta√´l. Although de Sta√´l died a year before her birth, Louise was born in her grandmother's Ch√¢teau de Coppet in Switzerland, a residence made famous through de Sta√´l's writings and cultural notoriety. She would inherit the Coppet estate in 1878, and be buried there; the property, which has been open to the public since 1924‚Äì1925, is still owned by the Countess d'Haussonville's descendants. Marguerite G√©rard, Mme de Sta√´l et sa fille, c. 1805 (Ch√¢teau de Coppet Collection). Louise de Broglie's mother and grandmother, painted 13 years before her birth Germaine de Sta√´l was the daughter of the Swiss banker and politician Jacques Necker, who had been Louis XVI's director-general of finance, and his wife Suzanne Curchod, the poor but well-educated daughter of a Swiss pastor (Curchod had previously been engaged to historian Edward Gibbon). Louise's maternal grandfather was said to be Erik Magnus Sta√´l von Holstein, Swedish Ambassador to France, but as de Sta√´l also maintained a longstanding romantic relationship and intellectual collaboration with liberal political activist and writer Benjamin Constant, who believed he fathered Albertine (Louise's mother), it is possible that Constant was her biological grandfather. Louise wrote an unpublished autobiography recounting a highly cultured education and upbringing. From an early age, she was enthusiastic about literature and music, opera in particular‚ÄîIngres would later include opera glasses in her portrait. Notably intellectual, she was said to have read every new book. At age 11, she attended the opening night of Victor Hugo's play \\"Hernani\\", famous for the demonstrations it provoked; as a young pianist, she had personally known Chopin. She was also considered a talented watercolorist, capable of painting dramatic, convincing scenes. Nevertheless, she took personal criticism to heart, recalling that her mother in childhood likened her to \\"a pretty vase without handles\\"; another critic told her (at age nine) that her character \\"had not enough nourishment in it to sustain a dog\\", and compared her to \\"a field mouse, a topaz, a roe deer, a blue fairy and a spark\\". According to this same person, her heraldic emblem should have been a runaway horse. In October 1836 at age 18, she married the future French National Assembly member and historian Joseph d'Haussonville (1809‚Äì1884). \\"I was destined to beguile, to attract, to seduce, and in the final reckoning to cause suffering in all those who sought their happiness in me\\", Louise wrote; \\"I wanted to marry young and have a brilliant position in society. And that, basically, was the only reason I wanted to marry him\\", she said. Upon her marriage, she became Louise de Cl√©ron, Viscountess d'Haussonville. (She would later become Louise de Cl√©ron, Countess d'Haussonville upon the death of her father-in-law in 1846.) Whatever her initial sentiments, the marriage seems to have evolved into a happy one; the couple lived in the H√¥tel de Broglie, 35 rue Saint-Dominique, a residence renovated for them by the fashionable architect and interior designer Hippolyte Destailleur. They had three children: Victor-Bernard (1837‚Äì1838), who died in infancy, Mathilde (1839‚Äì1898), who never married, and Gabriel Paul Othenin Bernard, known as Paul-Gabriel d'Haussonville (1843‚Äì1924), a renowned politician and essayist, through whom she has many descendants. Louise is unique in history for being the daughter, sister, spouse, and mother of four members of the French Academy: Her father Victor, brother Albert, husband Joseph, and son Paul-Gabriel did not occupy their Academy seats simultaneously, with Paul-Gabriel elected in 1888, six years after his mother's death. Louise was the great-aunt of Louis de Broglie, who would win the 1929 Nobel Prize in Physics for his foundational work on quantum theory. She was also the great-grandmother of philologist B√©atrix d'Andlau (1893‚Äì1989) and her brother Jean Le Marois (1895‚Äì1978), poet and dramatist, who were both members of the Andlau family.  Literary career  Louise was considered independent, liberal, and outspoken, both by the standards of the day and particularly given the circumstances of her elevated social rank.

Portrait by Ingres  Ingres, Antiochus and Stratonice, 1840 In 1838, two years into the marriage, Viscount d'Haussonville sought to have his wife's portrait painted by Franz Xaver Winterhalter, a favorite of European royalty, but Winterhalter was unavailable. They next considered Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres; Louise and her husband first met Ingres in Rome in 1840, while he was directing the French Academy in Rome and living at the Villa Medici. They became convinced of his suitability to paint her portrait after viewing his recently completed Antiochus and Stratonice (today in the Cond√© Museum). Ingres, figure study, circa 1844 Ingres, figure study, 1844 At around the same time, Ingres, by then 60 years old and convinced his reputation would be secured through larger- scale undertakings, expressed dismay to a friend that \\"everyone wants\\" portraits. \\"There are six that I am refusing or trying to avoid because I can't bear them. Well, it was not to paint portraits that I returned to Paris.\\" Although it is unknown whether Louise's portrait was among those commissions Ingres hoped to avoid, preliminary sketches indicate that by summer 1842 he had taken up the task.The 1842 date was assigned by Maryvonne Cassan for the portrait's early preparatory studies based on three related works, one of them a drawing in pencil signed \\"Ingres 1842\\". See p. 59 in the Catalogue des tableaux, √©tudes peintes, dessins et croquis de J.-A.-D. Ingres, peintre d'histoire, s√©nateur, membre de l'Institut, expos√©s dans les galeries du palais de l'√âcole imp√©riale des Beaux-Arts, A. Lain√© et J. Havard, Paris, 1867. BnF number FRBNF403739955. From the perspective of both painter and sitter, the process was not easy. Louise would spend months abroad at a time, and her sittings were interrupted by pregnancy. At least 16 preparatory sketches exist, as well as an early trial portrait in oil, and with dozens of drapery studies, some 60 extant Ingres works are thought to have informed the finished work. Ingres significantly revised Louise's costume and refined her facial expression, adding extensive notes to at least one working draft: \\"indent the nostril\\", \\"chin sharper\\", \\"eyeballs smaller\\", \\"nose narrower\\". He once told his pupil Amaury Duval that as difficult as portraiture was, women's portraits posed a particular challenge: \\"It can't be done\\", he said. \\"It's enough to make one weep.\\" Ingres spent the first six months of 1845 working intensely on the portrait, which was finished by summer of that year. Ingres, study, circa 1844 Art historian (and Frick curator emeritus) Edgar Munhall has suggested that both \\"Antiochus and Stratonice\\" as well as Ingres's portrait of Louise owe an inspirational debt to the pose of Pudicitia (\\"modesty\\" or \\"sexual valor\\"), a Roman statue of a goddess on display in the Vatican collection. In his book on Ingres, Robert Rosenblum connects her pose to Polyhymnia, muse of sacred poetry, hymn, and eloquence, as depicted particularly in the Louvre's Roman copy of a Greek original. Regardless of the specific inspiration, Ingres's portrait of Louise depicts a woman both modest and worldly, her gaze fixed on the viewer who seems almost to have surprised her, after her return from the opera, having casually removed her evening wrap. Many critics have noted the anatomical impossibility of Louise's pose, her right arm seeming to originate at her left shoulder. It would also be impossible to see Louise's raised hand in the mirror's reflection, though Ingres included it. Although many viewers have assumed Louise's portrait faithfully reflects contemporary fashion, recent scholarship has established that Louise's dress was pointedly out-of-style by the time Ingres painted her, as if to emphasize that the subject's intelligence and relative informality trumped her allegiance to fashionable trends. The painting remained in the family's private possession for eighty years, though it was displayed publicly on occasion. Its first Paris exhibition in 1846 created \\"a storm of approval among her family and friends\\", Ingres wrote a friend, relaying in confidence that a prominent politician had written Louise saying \\"M Ingres must be in love with you to have painted you this way\\". The portrait was subsequently exhibited in 1855, 1867, 1874, and 1910, and was engraved in 1889 and again in 1910; it was also circulated in photographed form. Following the death of Paul-Gabriel d'Haussonville in 1924, his descendants sold the painting to offset estate taxes to art dealer Georges Wildenstein, from whom it was next acquired by the Frick Collection for $125,000 in 1927. It has been almost continuously on public display in New York City since the opening of Henry Clay Frick's home as a museum in 1935. Unlike works acquired directly by Frick before his death in 1919, Comtesse d'Haussonville can be loaned and exhibited elsewhere, and made its first visit to California in 2009‚Äì2010 where it was the centerpiece of an exhibit by the Norton Simon Museum. The painting returned to Europe in early 2015 where it was exhibited at the Mauritshuis in The Hague.

It is the highest representative body of the party's state and territory branches. The National Conference takes place triennially, the most recent being the 48th conference held in Adelaide in 2018,ALP: Welcome to the 47th Australian Labor Party National Conference and which was attended by 397 party delegates.Sydney Morning Herald, 18 June 2015: Labor powerbrokers lose control with reform back on the agenda The previous Conference was the 2011 National Conference held on 3 December 2011, and the next National Conference will take place in Adelaide on 16-18 December 2018. The National Conference determines party policy, called the National Platform,Labor National Platform from 46th Conference which is executed by the National Executive. Twenty members of the National Executive are elected by the National Conference. The National Conference does not elect the party's parliamentary leaders, which since 2013 has been by a ballot of both the Parliamentary Caucus and by the Labor Party's rank-and-file members. The national president and vice-presidents are elected by a vote of party members. On many matters votes at the Conference take place on a factional basis. In the past, the Labor Right faction held a majority at the National Conference, though it lost the majority at the 2015 National Conference. Notable actions and positions=Socialist objective The 1922 National Conference adopted a \\"socialist objective,\\" which remained official policy for many years. The resolution was qualified, however, by the \\"Blackburn amendment,\\" which said that \\"socialisation\\" was desirable only when necessary to \\"eliminate exploitation and other anti-social features.\\"McKinlay (1981) p. 53 In practice the socialist objective was a dead letter. Only once has a federal Labor government attempted to nationalise any industry (Ben Chifley's bank nationalisation of 1947), and that was held by the High Court to be unconstitutional. The commitment to nationalisation was dropped after urging by Gough Whitlam in the 1970s, and in the 1980s Bob Hawke's government carried out many free market reforms including the floating of the dollar and privatisation of state enterprises such as Qantas airways and the Commonwealth Bank. Expulsion of the New South Wales branch In March 1931, a Special Federal Conference was called in response to the actions of the New South Wales state executive, which was controlled by the Lang Labor faction. The New South Wales state leader, Jack Lang, had been openly defying the federal Labor government for several months. The most immediate trigger was the state party's actions at the East Sydney by-election, where it announced that its candidate, Eddie Ward, would be bound only by the decisions of the state executive, not the federal caucus. At the conference, which the New South Wales Branch boycotted, John Curtin successfully moved for the branch's expulsion; the motion was carried by 25 votes to four. The conference also gave the Federal Executive the power to suspend or dissolve any other state branch \\"acting or having acted in a manner deemed [...] contrary to the Federal Constitution, Platform, and Policy of the Party\\".Crisp (1978), p. 62. The conference subsequently moved for the establishment of a new ALP branch in New South Wales loyal to the Federal Executive, which became known as the \\"Federal Labor Party\\". As the Federal Executive had no power to dissolve the original branch (controlled by Lang), the two parties competed against each other at elections for several years. The rebellious branch was eventually re- admitted to the party at another Special Federal Conference in Melbourne in 1936.Crisp (1978), p. 44. Uranium mining The 1977 National Conference voted in favour of an indefinite moratorium on uranium mining. However, the 1982 National Conference changed the anti-uranium position in favour of a \\"one mine policy\\". After the ALP won power in 1983, the 1984 National Conference adopted a \\"three mine policy\\".Burgmann, Verity (2003). Power, Profit and Protest pp. 174‚Äì175. Retrieved 15 December 2010. This referred to the then three existing uranium mines in Australia, Nabarlek, Ranger and Roxby Downs/Olympic Dam, and articulated ALP support for pre-existing mines and contracts, but opposition to any new mining.Evans, Chris (23 March 2007). Labor & uranium: an evolution, Labor E-herald. Same-sex Marriage The 2011 National Conference voted in favour of recognition of same-sex marriage in Australia, and also formally endorsed a motion to allow Labor members of parliament the ability to vote in accordance with their consciences. On midnight 9 January, 2018 same-sex marriage became effectively legal across Australia by the Malcolm Turnbull Coalition Government, only after a controversial \\"national postal survey\\" where 61% of Australians voted yes.

He worked in the Neo-Classical style and was said to be the favorite student of Jacques-Louis David.  Biography  His father was a furniture dealer and his uncle was a master cabinet maker. He began his studies at the Acad√©mie de Marseille under the direction of , one of its founding members. He went to Rome in 1784, where he met Jacques-Louis David, who was then working on the \\"Oath of the Horatii\\". Back in France, he settled in Paris where, from 1787 to 1790, he worked in David's studio at the Acad√©mie royale de peinture et de sculpture. He returned to Rome from 1790 to 1792 and was one of group of artists who supported the French Revolution. The Siege of Sparta Under threat by the authorities of the Papal States, he fled to Paris and lived with David. The following year, he was selected to be part of a mission from the Interior Ministry, charged with assessing the political situation in Marseille. On his return, with the support of David and Pierre- Antoine Antonelle, he was appointed to the Revolutionary Tribunal. In that capacity, he was part of the jury that tried Georges Danton. He barely managed to retain his position after the Thermidorean Reaction, and next appears in late 1794 as a jury member at the trial of Jean-Baptiste Carrier and other members of the \\"Revolutionary Committee of Nantes\\". The following year, perhaps after a brief stay in prison, he became an associate of Gracchus Babeuf and Marc-Antoine Jullien de Paris then, in November, he accompanied Jean Bassal (one of the Montagnards) on an official mission to Switzerland. He returned to Paris in 1797 and, troubled by the trial of the Babeuvistes, he began painting again, for the first time in five years. It was then that he completed his best known work, depicting the death of Gaius Gracchus; an allusion to the suicide attempt made by Gracchus Babeuf after hearing his death sentence. When the painting was shown at the Salon in 1798, no one dared to say the name \\"Gracchus\\". In 1799, he joined the , a Neo-Jacobin organization, and painted \\"The Siege of Sparta\\", a call-to-arms to defend the Republic. Later, he became a suspect in the Conspiration des poignards, an alleged plot to assassinate Napol√©on that was apparently begun by a police agent in what would now be called a \\"sting operation\\". He was arrested on October 10, 1800, together with (a member of the Committee of Public Safety), Adjutant-General and the sculptor Giuseppe Ceracchi. His trial took place shortly after the Plot of the rue Saint-Nicaise, attributed to the Jacobins, so a fair trial was less possible than usual. Despite repeated protests of his innocence and lack of evidence, he was found guilty and guillotined on January 31, 1801.

The film stars Maddy Curley, John DeLuca, Nikki SooHoo, Drew Seeley, Julie Warner, and Thomas Fowler. Both SooHoo and Warner had previously co-starred with Curley in Stick It; the two films are not connected, although both deal with competitive gymnastics.  Plot  Apple, a student at the prestigious Greene University, has a business editing other students' papers. Her main goal is to marry her rugby-playing boyfriend Todd. However, the rugby team is disbanded because of the Title IX rule, and Todd transfers to another school. Apple decides to start a women's gymnastics team so that he can stay. She and her roommate Cali find six athletic girls at Greene. She also meets Chet, another rugby player and the TA for her economics class. The athletics director eventually approves the gymnastics team. With Cali as their coach, the team starts to learn gymnastics. Apple and Chet grow closer, and he kisses her. The rugby team is allowed to compete again. Todd returns to campus, makes Apple fold his clothes and then dumps her. Heartbroken, she quits the gymnastics team and starts spending her time going on dates. Without her, the team disbands, and her friends, including Chet and Cali, stop talking to her. Then, the school's dean finds out about Apple's paper-editing business. Apple has a hearing where she is accused of violating Greene University's academic policy. During the hearing, she realizes what the team meant to her, and the case is dismissed. She apologizes to her friends, and the gymnastics team is re-formed for the last competition of the season. Each gymnast improves with practice, and at the meet, they do well and hit all of their routines. Apple ends the competition by scoring a perfect 10 on floor exercise. Chet meets her afterwards, and the two kiss.

History The funds donated by Tereshchenko family helped to build, restore churches like: Cathedral of the Three Anastasias, Pokrovskaya church on Solomenka, Kyiv, St. Nicholas Cathedral in the Pokrovsky monastery, St Volodymyr's Cathedral, Russian Orthodox churches in Cannes and Beaulieu-sur-Mer etc. Cathedral of the Three Anastasias The first money, earned by family, has been spent on the restoration of the old wooden Cathedral of the Three Anastasias. The Tereshchenko family took an active part in the building of this magnificent cathedral. In 1846 Artemy Tereshchenko started the funding the church, whereupon a normal service has been resumed, in 1861 and 1872 it has been constructed the altar of the Cross and Resurrection and also attached the altar of the St. Artemy. Artemy Tereshchenko was the civil trustee of the cathedral and since 1846 he was engaged in maintenance and repair of the church. Being devout, Artemy insisted that the most beautiful room of his house, which offers a beautiful views of the surrounding countryside, has been put under the house church. After the final reconstruction of the church, an underground passage was dug that allowed, at any time, and in any weather, to get from the house to the crypt of the church, where later there will be equipped the Tereshchenko family's feretory. It is known that Artemy and Nikola got up very early in the morning and started the day at 4 a.m. with a prayer in the church. In 1884, the Chernihiv provincial board approved a resolution on the new project of the Cathedral of the Three Anastasias according to planning of St. Petersburg Academician of Architecture Andrey Goun. The construction of the new church began a year later, in 1885. Funds for the construction were donated by Artemy Tereshchenko sons. Thanks to their financial support the church was built in a relatively quick time, and already in 1893 - consecrated. On May 21, 1894 the Tereshchenko brothers appealed to the Holy Synod to allow them to demolish the old Three-Anastasias church, citing the fact that the building is so neglected that is already beyond repair. Soon, a special expert committee of professors of the Kyiv Theological Academy gave the permission for the demolition and on January 2, 1895 the Holy Synod confirmed it by decree. The Hetman church was demolished during the period of 1895-1897. And on its place they built a chapel, which was destroyed by communists in 1950. During the World War II the central dome of the temple was destroyed. At the end of the war it was rebuilt in a somewhat modified form. During the restoration and repair of the Cathedral of the Three Anastasias, the crosses which were manufactured from the drawings of Andrey Goun have been replaced by Catholic.https://mospat.ru/en/2010/09/18/news26609/ The Tereshchenko family charnel house is located at the Cathedral of the Three Anastasias. During the Revolution, the crypt was looted and the slabs of the graves were smashed. After 1991, the graves were re-consecrated and re-ordered. In 2007, the Cathedral of the Three Anastasias was nominated by Hlukhiv on Ukrainian competition Seven Wonders of Ukraine. As a consequence, the church took the sixth place in the Sumy regional campaign 'Seven Wonders of the Sumy region'.http://trehanastasiy.church.ua/ St. Nicholas Cathedral in the Pokrovsky monastery St. Nicholas Cathedral - the largest in the size of the temple in Kyiv, built in 1896-1911. Duchess Alexandra Petrovna of Oldenburg, is the founder of the St. Nicholas Cathedral, allocated 3 thousand rubles every month. Due to this fact, in 1900 it was possible to build a cathedral. However, after Her death, and because of the uncertainty of the future sources of funding, the construction was not conducted for nearly two years. The monastery asked for help from benefactors. A substantial contribution, in particular, was made by Tereshchenko family (collectively donated over 50 thousand rubles, including 20 thousand rubles for specially on the gilding domes and silver throne in the future).http://churchs.kiev.ua/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=72:2010-09-10-19-53-21&catid;=3:2010-09-03-18-31-43&Itemid;=12 St Volodymyr's Cathedral The priests of the cathedral has always been meeting Elizabeth Tereshchenko with signs of deep respect, and if the Bishop was at the time in the temple, he necessarily went out to greet with her. The Tereshchenko family took an active part in the building of this magnificent cathedral. Nikola Tereshchenko presented a plot of land that was located between his mansion and the home of Ivan Nikolovich. He also he donated large funds, in particular, for the gilding of all the bells of the temple; the Tereshchenko family invited the most famous artists from all over the Russia for the painting of the church, as well as carried out charitable activities and supported the efforts of the ecclesiastics to facilitate the lives of the poor and disadvantaged of the parish.

Phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM) catalyzes the reversible reaction of 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA) to 2-phosphoglycerate (2-PGA) in the glycolytic pathway. The PGAM is a dimeric enzyme containing, in different tissues, different proportions of a slow- migrating muscle (MM) isozyme, a fast-migrating brain (BB) isozyme, and a hybrid form (MB). This gene encodes muscle-specific PGAM subunit. Mutations in this gene cause muscle phosphoglycerate mutase deficiency, also known as glycogen storage disease X.[provided by RefSeq, Sep 2009] Structure PGAM2 is one of two genes in humans encoding a PGAM subunit, the other being PGAM1. Gene The PGAM2 gene is composed of three exons of lengths spanning 454, 180, and 202 bp, separated by two introns of 103 bp and 5.6 kb. Located 29 bp upstream of the transcription start site is a TATA box-like element, and 40 bp upstream of this element is an inverted CCAAT box element (ATTGG). Despite its muscle-specific expression, no muscle-specific consensus sequences were identified in the 5'-untranslated region of human PGAM2, though one consensus sequence has been proposed in rat and chicken. Unlike PGAM1, which is present as several copies in the human genome, only one copy of PGAM2 is found in the genome, indicating that this gene arose from gene duplication of and subsequent modifications in the PGAM1 gene. Protein The isozyme encoded by PGAM2 spans 253 residues, which demonstrates highly sequence similarity (81% identity) to the protein PGAM1. Both form either homo- or heterodimers. The MM homodimer is found primarily in adult muscle, while the MB heterodimer, composed of a subunit from each isozyme, is found in the heart. One key residue in the active site of PGAM2, lysine 100 (K100), is highly conserved across bacteria, to yeast, plant, and mammals, indicating its evolutionary importance. K100 directly contacts the substrate (3-PGA) and intermediate (2,3-PGA); however, the acetylation of this residue under normal cellular conditions neutralizes its positive charge and interferes with this binding. Mechanism PGAM2 catalyzes the 3-PG-to-2-PG isomerization via a 2-step process: # a phosphate group from the phosphohistidine in the active site is transferred to the C-2 carbon of 3-PGA to form 2,3-bisphosglycerate (2,3-PGA), and then # the phosphate group linked to the C-3 carbon of 2,3-PG is transferred to the catalytic histidine to form 2-PGA and regenerate the phosphohistidine.  Function  PGAM2 is one of two PGAM subunits found in humans and is predominantly expressed in adult muscle. Both isozymes of PGAM are glycolytic enzymes that catalyze the reversible conversion of 3-PGA to 2-PGA using 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate as a cofactor. Since both 3-PGA and 2-PGA are allosteric regulators of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and glycine and serine synthesis pathways, respectively, PGAM2 may contribute to the biosynthesis of amino acids, 5-carbon sugar, and nucleotides precursors. Clinical significance PGAM activity is upregulated in cancers, including lung cancer, colon cancer, liver cancer, breast cancer, and leukemia. One possible mechanism involves the deacetylation of residue K100 in the PGAM active site by sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) under conditions of oxidative stress. This deacetylation activates PGAM activity, resulting in increased NADPH production and cell proliferation, and thus tumor growth. In a patient with intolerance for strenuous exercise and persistent pigmenturia, PGAM2 activity was found to be decreased relative to other glycolytic enzymes. This PGAM2 deficiency results in a metabolic myopathy (glycogenosis type X) and has been traced to mutations in the PGAM2 gene. Currently, four mutations have been identified from African-American, Caucasian, and Japanese families. One G-to-A transition mutation in codon 78 produced a truncated protein product, while mutations at codons 89 and 90 may have disrupted the active site and resulted in an inactive protein product. Meanwhile, two patients heterozygous for the G97D mutation presented with exercise intolerance and muscle cramps.  Interactions  PGAM2 is known to interact with: *SIRT2.

Starting his career as a common laborer in the Homestead Steel Works of Carnegie Steel at the age of 15, he rose to become vice president of Carnegie Steel, U.S. Steel, and Midvale Steel. He was an outspoken advocate for the end of the seven-day week and the twelve-hour day in the steel industry and became a proponent of \\"industrial democracy\\" based on stock ownership by employees. Dickson was one of the last of Andrew Carnegie's \\"young geniuses\\" to rise through the ranks to become a junior partner in Carnegie Steel, where he designed America's first corporate safety department and pension plan. When J.P. Morgan founded U.S. Steel in 1901, Dickson became assistant to the president of the new corporation and later first vice president. William Dickson and Andrew Carnegie, photo courtesy of Littleton (NH) Area Historical Society In 1915, he became vice president, treasurer, and director of Midvale Steel and Ordnance Company, which during World War I was the third largest steel company in the United States (after U.S. Steel and Bethlehem Steel). Dickson envisioned an equal partnership between labor and capital. Midvale Steel and Ordnance Company pioneered employee ownership and management and became one of America's most progressive industrial companies. Dickson retired in 1923 at age fifty-eight.  Early life  William Brown Dickson was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the ninth child of Mary Ann (n√©e McConnell) and John Dickson (eventually there would be eleven). His mother was born in Lanarkshire, Scotland and had emigrated in 1850; his father was born in County Tyrone, Ireland and had emigrated in 1832. When he was one, his family moved to Swissvale where his father was a partner in Dickson, Stewart and Company, a successful coal mine and lime kiln operator. The firm had invested heavily in a Pittsburgh bank which failed after the Panic of 1873. Because of the double liability of stockholders (up to twice the amount of the investment), the business was ruined and his father lost everything, including his house. Dickson left school at age 11 and began working full time, first running errands for a lamp and glassware store in Pittsburgh for $3.00 per week. After several other jobs closer to home, he was attracted by the higher wages at Homestead and entered the steel mill on April 28, 1881 at 6pm for a 12-hour shift. His first job was in the blooming mill as a \\"spell hand\\" for the pulpit boys, who operated valves that controlled cranes. Later he worked in the converting and rail mills. In 1886, he was shifted to clerical work in the mills and, less exhausted at the end of the day, enrolled in Duff's Mercantile College in downtown Pittsburgh and studied bookkeeping and accounting. In August, 1889, he was called to the Pittsburgh office and his career took off.  Private life  At Swissvale on February 22, 1888, Dickson married Mary Bruce Dickson (1865-1944), daughter of Thomas Bruce Dickson and Mary McCrory Dickson (same last name, no relation). Together they had six children. On April 1, 1901 he resigned his position at Carnegie Steel Company and went to New York with Charles M. Schwab, president of United States Steel Corporation, which began business on that date. Dickson moved his family to Montclair, New Jersey, where he bought a home on Llewellyn Road to which he added wings designed by New York architect Frank E. Wallis. Nurtured in the bosom of the Presbyterian Church, by mid-life Dickson had forsworn all \\"dogmatic religion\\" and described himself as an \\"Ethical Christian.\\" Dickson was a founding member of the Montclair Art Museum in 1913. His portrait was painted by renowned American Impressionist William Merritt Chase in 1905 and was donated to the museum in 1976 by Dickson's children. A lover of music and a self-taught pianist, he was a sponsor of the Llewellyn Ensemble, which met at his home in Montclair in 1916 and 1917 and evolved into the Montclair Orchestra. \\"They Shall Beat Their Swords into Plow-shares\\" is an anthem composed in 1934 by Mark Andrews and dedicated to Dickson, \\"a great lover of music and men.\\" Dickson was the driving force behind the creation of Montclair's parks. In 1906, he spearheaded the referendum to create the network of city parks. Dickson purchased a 150-acre farm with twin gambrel-roofed barns and a small farm house near Littleton in the North Country of New Hampshire at the western edge of the White Mountains. Between 1902 and 1909, on a hilltop above the farm with a breathtaking view of Mt. Lafayette and the Kinsman Ridge, he built Highland Croft, a stone and wood lodge with nine inter-connecting bedrooms. He would bring more than two-dozen family members to Littleton each summer. He founded the Highland Chorus, which held practice afternoons at the farm. Sixty members strong, the Highland Chorus put on its first concert at the Littleton Opera House in 1923.  Death  William B. Dickson died at Highland Croft in 1942 after a four-month illness. He is buried in Allegheny Cemetery in Pittsburgh.

Prior to that, he served as President of the PLA Academy of Military Science and Commander of the North Sea Fleet. Zhang became the PLA Navy commander in the aftermath of the fatal submarine 361 accident in 2003. He initiated reforms to improve maintenance and training of the naval force, but stepped down three years later because of cancer, and died soon afterwards. Early life and career Zhang Dingfa was born on 8 December 1943 to a workers' family in Pudong, Shanghai. After graduating from Yangsi High School, he was admitted to the PLAN Submarine Academy in 1960. He joined the Communist Party of China in March 1964. After graduating from the Submarine Academy in July 1964, Zhang joined the PLAN's submarine force, and participated in the development of China's nuclear submarines. He became a deputy submarine commander in 1971, and commander in 1975. In August 1985, Zhang became chief of staff of the Qingdao Naval Base of the PLAN's North Sea Fleet, and he attained the rank of rear admiral in June 1991. He was then promoted to chief of staff of the North Sea Fleet in 1993, deputy commander in 1995, and commander of the North Sea Fleet and concurrently deputy commander of the Jinan Military Region in 1996. He became a vice admiral in July 1998, and a deputy commander of the PLA Navy in December 2000. In November 2002, Zhang was appointed president of the PLA Academy of Military Science, the first naval officer to hold the position. Command of the PLA Navy Following a fatal accident with the Type 035 Ming-class submarine 361 in April 2003, Admiral Shi Yunsheng was removed from his position as Commander of the PLA Navy. Zhang Dingfa was chosen as his replacement partly because of his background as a career submariner, in an era when the PLA Navy was relying on its submarines in the event of a possible conflict with the United States over the Taiwan Strait issue. In September 2004, he was promoted to the rank of admiral, and became a member of the Central Military Commission (CMC). He was the first naval commander to become a CMC member. As commander, Zhang initiated steps to reform the PLA Navy in the aftermath of the Ming 361 accident, including reorganizing the chain of command to improve accountability for maintenance and emphasizing training for more realistic scenarios. After serving for three years, however, Zhang was forced to step down in August 2006 because of terminal cancer. He was replaced by Admiral Wu Shengli, who continued his reforms. Death Zhang Dingfa's tomb in Babaoshan On 14 December 2006, Zhang Dingfa died in Beijing. President Hu Jintao and Vice President Zeng Qinghong were among those who attended his funeral. He was cremated and buried at the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery.

The park contains seven concrete turtles and one snake. The turtles were designed and sculpted by Bob Cassilly and the park opened in August 1996. Turtle Park can be seen from Interstate 64 and the Saint Louis Zoo to the north. Design The park contains seven turtle species that are native to Missouri Google books excerpt. as well as a clutch of eggs. The three large turtles are a snapping turtle, a Mississippi map turtle and a red-eared slider and named after Sunny Glassberg's children: Dick, Tom, and Sally. The four smaller turtles are a stinkpot turtle and three box turtles, named after Glassberg's grandchildren: David, Adam, Emily, and Antonio. The snapping turtle is 40-foot long and used 120,000 pounds of concrete. A concrete snake lines the park; its head is attached to and appears to be biting the Tamm Avenue Overpass at the west end of the park. The design allows kids to climb on the turtle's shells and into their open mouths. History St. Louis philanthropist Sunny Glassberg developed the idea and donated the funds for Turtle Park. She hired Bob Cassilly to design the park and the St. Louis Parks Department and Forest Park Forever helped locate the land for the park, a strip of Forest Park that had been cut off by Interstate 64. Glassberg wanted the park to be a fun place for children: \\"I wanted to give children a place where they could be happy, where they could feel inspired. Because I feel that that sort of thing is contagious.\\" The Park opened in August 1996. The reconstruction of Interstate 64 in 2009 necessitated the removal of the snake's head. Cassilly's team removed the head and the new bridge was designed in such a way that the head could be placed back on the overpass. Turtle Park was voted the \\"Best Picnic Spot\\" in St. Louis in 2011 by the Riverfront Times. In 2015, MySun Charitable Foundation sponsored renovations to Turtle Park, including new turf, resurfacing the access path, and the installation of a water fountain.

The area is known for its layered streets, twisted labyrinth-like alleys, and brightly painted houses, which have been restored and enhanced in recent years to attract tourism. Built on a steep mountain-side slope, the village has been nicknamed \\"Korea's Santorini,\\" as well as the \\"Machu Picchu of Busan\\".  History  Gamcheon Village was built during the 1920's and 30's when the Busan city administration decided to relocate its poor Korean population into an area secluded from the port, yet close enough to provide labor. In the midst of post-war recovery in 1955, around 800 families moved to the village, contributing to the growth of an ascetic religious community known as Taegeukdo. A long-time resident noted the village's development throughout the decades: \\"Gamcheon was only one district in 1950, now it‚Äôs nine. In the ‚Äô70s there were only houses made of wood. In the late ‚Äô80s and early ‚Äô90s, families started to get bigger so they built two-level houses.\\" Nonetheless, the village faced persisting poverty and poor living conditions. In 2009, the Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism carried out a public art-themed renovation effort to convert the village to a cultural hub. It called for art students, professional artists, and residents to maintain, repair, and \\"decorate\\" the village with art. The renovation efforts reached their peak with the success of the ‚ÄúEmpty House Residency Preservation Project.‚Äù With improvements to infrastructure, fresh paint and other home improvements, the establishment of spaces for retail and museums, and the addition of several dozens of art installations, the village has been reborn as Busan's most colorful and artistic spot. Some examples of the colorful art installations include bird sculptures, Murakami-like playful installations, scenes from the Little Prince, and painted schools of fish that guide bearings through the alleyways.  Tourism  The village has turned into one of the most featured tourist attractions in Busan. Since the public art renovation project in 2009, tourism in Gamcheon has increased considerably -- the village saw approximately 1.4 million visitors in 2015. Village residents have met this influx of traffic with mixed attitudes. While some residents have participated in the renovation and tourism efforts, others have opted to move away despite difficulties with selling their homes. It is estimated that 300 local houses were empty as of 2015; Part of the development efforts in the Village include converting these abandoned houses into art galleries, museums, and shops.

The National Global Change Research Plan 2012‚Äì2021: A Strategic Plan for the U.S. Global Change Research Program, 132 pp. The initial focus of GCIS is to support the United States Third National Climate Assessment (NCA3), which is to publish reports that enhance the transparency and ability of decision-makers to understand the conclusions and use of the underlying data for their own purposes.About the Global Change Information System Scope of work The project scope includes analyzing alterations in climate, land use and land cover, natural resources including water, agriculture and biodiversity, atmospheric composition, chemical composition and ecological systems that may alter the Earth's capacity to sustain life. Global change research includes activities aimed at describing and understanding the interactive physical, chemical and biological processes that regulate the Earth system; the unique environment that the Earth provides for life; changes that are occurring in the Earth system; and the manner in which such systems, environments and changes are influenced by human actions. Provenance and semantics GCIS has developed information models and ontology to represent the content structure of the NCA3 and its associated provenance information and has been extending its models to incorporate more global change information. Records of objects and relationships within the GCIS are represented in a database for the Semantic Web, which can be queried using the SPARQL language. GCIS assigns globally unique persistent identifiers to all of the entities, activities, and agents relevant to provenance. Each identifier is mapped to a uniform resource identifier (URI) in the GCIS namespace, allowing use of those identifiers for the Semantic Web and other linked data systems. By categorizing, annotating, and linking provenance information, the GCIS becomes capable of answering provenance-tracking questions about global change research. GCIS ontology The GCIS Ontology promotes representation and documentation by incorporating the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)‚Äôs recommendation on provenance modeling (PROV) into the design.Groth, P., Moreau, L., (eds.) 2013.

History  The Busan Museum was designed to preserve the traditional culture of Busan through its collection of relics and historical art pieces. In 1995, it was founded as Busan Metropolitan Museum, and in May 2002, it was changed to Busan Museum following renovation and the opening of Exhibition Hall 2. A temporary capital memorial hall was opened in a detached building, which had previously served as the official residence of President Lee Myung-bak. The museum displays items that were left by Barley Mills and President Lee Seung Man and primarily preserves relics of the history of Busan. In October 1996, a Bokcheon, a detached building, was opened to exhibit excavated relics from the Bokcheon Ancient Tomb, a tomb representative of Busan culture during the Three Kingdoms period. Exhibition Hall 2 displays a wide variety of relics, ranging from the Prehistoric Age to modern-day. In July 2003, Busan's Modern Museum was opened, which features Busan historic event exhibits, and also contains relics from the Goguryeo‚ÄìSui War.

It was designed by Francis Drummond Greville Stanley and built in 1882 by French & Crystall. It is also known as Department of Primary Industries Building, Union Bank, and the Office of Sport and Recreation. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  This bank building was constructed in Maryborough in 1882 as the third branch of the Australian Joint Stock Bank to the design of prominent Queensland architect, Francis Drummond Grenville (FDG) Stanley. Settlement at Maryborough commenced in September 1847 when George Furber established a woolstore on the south bank of the Mary River at the head of navigation. He was followed in June 1848 by ET Aldridge and Henry and RE Palmer, who established their own wharves on the opposite riverbank, at a location now known as the original Maryborough town site at Baddow. In 1850 a new town site was surveyed to the east, at a downstream position which provided better access for shipping. The first sale of land at this new site occurred in 1852, but most residents did not shift to the current centre of Maryborough until 1855 and 1856. Maryborough was gazetted a Port of Entry in 1859 and was proclaimed a municipality in 1861. During the 1860s and 1870s it flourished as the principal port for the nearby Gympie goldfield and as an outlet for timber and sugar. The establishment of manufacturing plants and primary industries sustained growth in the town into the twentieth century. During the 1860s and 1870s, many banking institutes established purpose-built premises from where they conducted business. One of the first banks established in this town was the Australian Joint Stock Bank which opened a branch at the corner of Kent and Richmond streets in 1864. Floods in the 1870s destroyed the first Australian Joint Stock Bank and the building was rebuilt. By 1880 this rebuilt structure was considered uninhabitable and steps were made toward construction of yet another building. FDG Stanley was the architect for the new building and he is known to have designed branches of the Australian Joint Stock Bank in Gympie, Mackay, Ravenswood and Townsville, as well as additions to the Rockhampton branch. The contractors for the project, local builders, French and Crystall, submitted a tender for which was accepted and it is thought the construction commenced in mid 1882. In August 1882 reports of the progress of building works appeared in the Maryborough Chronicle: \\"the AJS Bank premises are currently being pulled down to make way for a larger and finer edifice more in keeping with its rivals, a hint which might be taken by the owners of other somewhat insignificant buildings\\". A fine two-storeyed masonry bank was constructed with strong classical influences conveying the values of tradition and strength historically identified with this style of architecture. As part of the project a two- storey extension was constructed along Kent Street to house the local branch of popular Queensland department store, Finney Isles and Co. Along Richmond Street there was a one-storey bank manager's residence. Maryborough was the birthplace of Helen Lyndon Goff who under the name PL Travers authored the well known Mary Poppins series of books. Her father was Travers Robert Goff, the manager of the Australian Joint Stock Bank at the time of her birth on 9 August 1899. A bronze statue at the front of the former bank commemorates Travers and her literary achievements. The bank continued in this branch until 1901 when it closed. By 1906 the premises had been leased to the Union Bank with a right to purchase the property, which was exercised in 1912. By 1924 a verandah had been constructed to the Richmond Street side of the building, requiring the removal of cornices and string coursing and the lengthening of several window openings to house French doors. In 1952 the Union Bank merged with the Bank of Australasia to form the Australian and New Zealand (ANZ) Bank, which operated in Maryborough from the Bank of Australasia's existing premises. The former Union Bank was therefore offered for sale again and the Queensland Government purchased the building for $12,000 to house the local regional office of the Department of Primary Industries. Subsequently, the building became the home of the Office of Recreation and Sport, with the Correctional Services Department leasing space on the upper floor. It is now a museum focusing on the works of P.L. Travers, called The Story Bank.  Description  The former Australian Joint Stock Bank is a prominent building in Maryborough, located on the corner of Richmond and Kent streets in the central business district of the town. The building comprises a two-storeyed section to Kent Street with a one storeyed wing to the rear, accessed from Richmond Street. The brick load bearing building has stuccoed facades to Kent and Richmond Streets. Centrally located on the Kent Street facade is the principal entrance bay, comprising a two-storeyed recessed porch, broken at first floor level by a heavy entablature which lines the two principal facades of the building. Framing this recess are two sets of columns, Doric order at the ground floor and Corinthian order on the first floor. The ground floor has a smooth rendered base, above which the body of the walls are rusticated, with centrally located round arched window openings to both floors. The upper floor has paired Corinthian pilasters which frame the face of the sections flanking the entrance bay. Seemingly supported on the pilasters and the attached columns of the central bay on the first floor, is a dentilled entablature surmounted by a decorative parapet, with central triangular pediment flanked by balustraded sections over the side bays. Terminating the parapets are urns at each end. A steeply pitched, corrugated iron clad, mansard roof is partially concealed behind the parapet. The Richmond Street facade of the building continues the architectural motifs of the Kent Street elevation, although the construction of a later verandah entailed the removal and replacement of some details on this elevation. Abutting the rear of the two- storeyed section of the former Australian Joint Stock Bank is a two-storeyed timber framed verandah, enclosed at the first floor and with deep scalloped frieze to the ground floor level. A single-storeyed section of the building to the rear of the Richmond Street elevation is constructed of painted and bagged brick and has a simple gabled roof and timber-framed verandah. Internally the building has timber boarded floors and plastered ceilings and walls. Many internal alterations have occurred.  Heritage listing  The former Australian Joint Stock Bank building in Maryborough was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Built in 1882 as the local branch of the Australian Joint Stock Bank, this building illustrates the growth of Maryborough during the nineteenth century. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The building is characteristic of a two-storey masonry bank, designed with a strong influence of classical architecture manifesting authority and strength, traditionally associated with financial institutes. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The building is well composed and has considerable architectural merit. It is a landmark in Maryborough, contributing to both the Kent and Richmond Street streetscapes. The building is a good example of the commercial work of FDG Stanley and is associated with him.

The school is considered to be one of Chennai's best girls' schools, and is affiliated to the Directorate of Matriculation Schools, Tamil Nadu. The school offers English Medium education to girls from Year 1 to year 12. The school is also known as simply the Bentinck School or Bentinck Vepery. The school celebrated its 175th anniversary in 2013. Started in 1837 with just 21 students, the school now has more than 2000 students. History The school was established in 1837, by Mrs. Anna Drew, a missionary of the London Missionary Society, posted in the Madras Presidency, British India. Anna Drew (n√©e Sheridan), was the widow of Rev. William Hoyles Drew, who died from cholera in Pulicat, and cousin of English playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan. The institution started with just 21 orphans, who were housed in a bungalow. Then known as the London Mission School, the main units taught were needle work and scriptures. At one stage, Mrs. W Porter became the head mistress, and made many improvements, such that the school came to be known as Mrs. W Porter's School. In 1852, the school moved to its campus on Jermiah Road. In 1915, the school was renamed as the Bentinck School, in honour of Lord William Bentinck, Governor General of India. Another prominent head mistresses was Marjorie Sykes, a Gandhian who served the school between 1930 and 1939, before leaving the school to join the Shantiniketan. Recognition and Education Since its inception, the school had a policy of admitting girls from low caste and poor families. In 1898, the school was granted recognition as a high school, and in 1899, the first student was admitted to college. In 1978, the school became a higher secondary school (offering Year 11 and Year 12). The Bentinck School once offered Education in English, Tamil and Telugu, the main languages of the Madras Presidency. There were special hostels for students coming from Andhra Pradesh and Meghalaya. However, it now offers only English Medium Education. Once it was a challenge to get girls to continue their education, due to the high level of dropouts. The situation has now changed, with the school being favored for its quality of education. Mrs. William Porter Mrs. William Porter took over as the Head Mistress of the London Mission School in the 1840s. This was the time when the women did not have equal status in Indian society. Mrs. Porter reporting on the condition of women in British India in 'The Missionary Repository for Youth, and Sunday School Missionary Magazine', explains, how women could not come in front of men, and female infanticide being common. Mrs. Porter also had trouble getting higher caste people in getting to send their girls to school, as they did want their children to study with lower caste pupils. Later Mrs. Porter also helped in running another school at Vizagapatam. A sketch of the London Mission school appeared in the magazine in 1847. As reported in 'The Missionary Magazine and Chronicle' in 1843, the Native Female Boarding School was superintended by Mrs. William Porter. The enrollments of the number of native children had increased considerably since its inception. In 1843, there were 50 girls who were provided boarding, clothing, food and education. The education was mainly in the vernacular languages, however English was also being taught. Marjorie Sykes Marjorie Sykes (1905-1995) was born in Mexborough, Yorkshire, England on 11 May 1905, as the daughter of a village schoolmaster. Sykes was nine years old when the First World War broke out, forcing a beloved teacher, who happened to be German, to leave her position.\\"Marjorie Sykes (1905-1995)\\" (Chapter 4, pp. 121-147) in Benefiting from a scholarship, Sykes began college studies in 1923 at Newnham College, Cambridge. There she heard of Mahatma Gandhi from the many Indian students. Sykes came to Madras (now called Chennai) in 1928 to serve as a teacher at the Bentinck School, remaining a resident of India for more than 60 years. She contributed enormous effort to advancing new forms of education advocated by Mahatma Gandhi and Rabindranath Tagore. In late 1928, a talk by Chakravarti Rajagopalachari inspired Sykes' interest in participating in the independence movement. Late in 1938, she met both Rabindranath Tagore (traveling to his school at Shantiniketan) and Mahatma Gandhi (traveling to his ashram at Sevagram). Beginning in 1939 she joined Santiniketan, working closely with Tagore and becoming acquainted with C.F. Andrews, later in 1944-46 holding the C.F. Andrews Memorial Chair at Santiniketan while working on Andrews' biography. In 1945, Gandhi invited Sykes to join his team working on Nai Talim (New Education), and she later became Principal of Gandhi's Basic Education Programme at Sevagram. In the 1960s Sykes served in efforts to bring peace in Nagaland, as well as living and conducting nonviolence training in Kotagiri in the Nilgiris Hills, and becoming increasingly active among Quakers, at Rasulia (Madhya Pradesh) as well as outside India. After an illness, at age 85 years, Sykes moved in 1991 from India to Swarthmore, a Quaker residential home in Buckinghamshire, England, where she remained until her death on 17 August 1995. Marjorie Sykes at the Bentinck School In May 1928, Marjorie Sykes was requested to take up work as a teacher at the Bentinck School, which was run by the London Missionary Society, and left England in October 1928. At that time the Bentinck School had only 350 girl students, and was being run like a family institution. Even though, it was a Christian school, education was being imparted to all sections of society irrespective of caste or religion. Further, the school taught children in their own mother tongue (Tamil and Telugu), rather than English. After joining, Marjorie broke norms by interacting closely with the natives, wearing khadi, traveling in native buses, riding bicycles and choosing to be a vegetarian. Marjorie soon learnt and mastered the Tamil (later on she also learnt Bengali and Hindi). In 1930, Marjorie was appointed as the Principal of the Bentinck School after the resignation of Alice Varley after her marriage to Quaker Ted Barnes. Alice and Marjorie remained friends for life.

Schoellkopf served as chairman of the Buffalo Niagara Electric Corporation and was a trustee of Cornell University. Early life Paul A. Schoellkopf was born in Niagara Falls, New York on March 7, 1884 to Arthur Schoellkopf (1856-1913) and Jessie (Gluck) Schoellkopf (1856-1928). Schoelkopf's father, Arthur, served as mayor of Niagara Falls from March 1896 ‚Äì March 1897. Paul studied at the Cascadilla School in Ithaca, New York and the University Preparatory School before entering Cornell University, where he was a member of the Quill and Dagger society and graduated in 1906. Career=Power companies After graduation, he entered the family business and in 1913, succeeded his father as general manager and treasurer of the Hydraulic Power Company of Niagara Falls. When the company merged with the Niagara Falls Power Company in 1919, Schoellkopf became president of the combined organization. He held that position until his death in 1947. In 1925, the Niagara Falls Power Company joined with other operating western New York utilities to form the Buffalo, Niagara and Eastern Power Corporation, with Schoellkopf as president. He held this position until 1929 when he was elected chairman of the board of directors. Also in 1929, several major utility companies serving a large part of New York were merged into the Niagara Hudson Power Company, which Schoellkopf served as president until 1933. In 1945, when several of the operating companies of the western division of Niagara Hudson were consolidated into the Buffalo Niagara Electric Corporation, he became chairman of the board. He was a director of Niagara Hudson Power Company, the Niagara, Lockport and Ontario Power Company, the New York Power and Light Company, the Buffalo General Electric Light Company , the Central Hudson Gas and Electric Corporation, the Tonawanda Power Company, the Eastern States Power Company, the Lower Niagara River Water Supply and Power Company, and the Canadian Niagara Power Company, Ltd.

He was also a trustee of the Niagara County Savings Bank, the Niagara Falls Memorial Hospital, the Young Women's Christian Association, the Niagara Frontier State Parks Commission, and chairman of the Niagara Frontier Bridge Commission. Schoellkopf, along with Frank A. Dudley and Afred W. Gray, financed the \\"Lewiston Heights\\" neighborhood, part of which was transferred to the Niagara Falls Country Club for their move to Lewiston. At one time Schoellkopf, Dudley, and Gray owned all the land at \\"Lewiston Heights.\\" Both Dudley and Schoellkopf built mansions on the escarpment (Dudley at 551 Mountain View and Schoellkopf at 583 Mountain View).

(originally known as Good Morning!, and alternately known in later years as The Good Day Show and Good Day! Live) is an American morning television program which aired from September 24, 1973 until October 11, 1991. Produced by WCVB-TV in Boston, Good Day! aired on that local ABC affiliate for its entire 18 years of production, airing in various timeslots (which changed throughout the years) between 9 and 11 a.m. on WCVB's morning schedule. The program was later syndicated to seventy-one American television markets, expanding its viewership beyond its primary New England viewer base. Good Day! is credited for being the prototype for ABC's Good Morning America, as its format, which combined news and information with talk and lifestyle features, was adopted by the subsequent national ABC morning television program, and eventually by its competitors on CBS, NBC, and on other networks. The program has no relation to the current group of local morning shows produced by the Fox owned-and-operated television stations, all of which use the Good Day title. Synopsis=Format and early years Good Day!, which first premiered in 1973 as Good Morning!, was a morning variety program with light news features, but with an overall focus on interviews with celebrities and experts in particular fields, along with a regular amount of musical, dance and scripted theater performances. Interviews with politicians and other key newsmakers were also featured, often conducted right in WCVB's studios on the program's set, but sometimes done via satellite. The show would also conduct special segments, or entire broadcasts, outdoors at several different Boston- area events, with the hosts interacting with event participants‚Äîand the general public‚Äîas they staged their activities. The program's original hosts were John Willis, Janet Langhart and Mortisha Palmer. After the first year, Palmer left the program, and it was the on-screen camaraderie of Willis and Langhart that became synonymous with the program. For much of its run, Good Day! was broadcast live from a set that merged both a large, sweeping living room area with a sizeable kitchen, the latter of which was used very often for cooking segments. In the mid-to-late 1980s, the in-studio set came to resemble more of a giant, elegant-looking open foyer, with a kitchen island moved into the center for the cooking segments. Good Day! also broke ground by taking its entire production on the road and broadcasting from locations outside of the Boston area and around the world‚Äîa feat of which was considered exceptional for a locally-produced program. For a few years beginning in the summer of 1974, WCVB made Good Morning! the cornerstone of their regional New England Network, a six-station link-up between WCVB and a handful of broadcast channels (spanning Rhode Island, Maine and Vermont) which all agreed to air a select amount of WCVB's locally-produced shows. Good Morning! continued to build on its early ratings success as a part of this network, with its reach now extending into Canadian markets.https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2209&dat;=19740726&id;=YaErAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=e_wFAAAAIBAJ&pg;=6873,4325358&hl;=en In 1975, when ABC was looking to revamp its new morning talk and news program AM America, they sent network executives out to a few of the ABC affiliates to observe the production of their local morning programs. Good Morning! was among the few that were used as a case study for the AM America retooling, the other principal one being The Morning Exchange on WEWS-TV in Cleveland. ABC entertainment chief Fred Silverman ended up adopting features from both programs, and launched AM America's replacement, Good Morning America, in November 1975. Not long after the premiere of Good Morning America, WCVB station manager Bob Bennett confronted Silverman at an affiliate's convention and accused him of deliberately stealing the title of Good Morning!; the two similarly-titled programs were now running back-to-back on WCVB's morning lineup.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6WM-ToO9Jw No legal cease and desist action was finalized against ABC in the matter, however. Finally, after months of possible confusion between the two programs, the Boston-based Good Morning! changed its name to Good Day! on Monday, August 2, 1976, the same day that the program began to be syndicated to TV markets beyond New England.https://secure.pqarchiver.com/boston/doc/662039677.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS;=ABS:AI&type;=historic&date;=Jul+31%2C+1976&author;=McLean%2C+Robert&pub;=Boston+Globe+%281960-1983%29&edition;=&startpage;=&desc;=%27Good+Day%27+debuts+with+new+set%2C+theme+song Host changesExit Janet Langhart, enter Meryl Comer= In 1978, the first significant host changes took place on Good Day!.

Prose, a former 1966 Miss America contestant, was a multi-talented television personality who brought her skills as a host, interviewer and singer to Good Day!.

It was built from to 1904. It is also known as Geraghty's Store. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Brennan & Geraghty's Store was built by partners Patrick Brennan and Martin Geraghty in what was then a small commercial centre in Lennox Street, Maryborough. The store was operated by members of the same family until 1972, thus completing a century of trading, and contains original stock and trading records. Maryborough was established at its present site in 1852 as an outlet for the trade of the Wide Bay and Burnett pastoral districts. Wool, tallow, cedar and kauri pine flowed outwards with backloads of essential supplies for the stations providing a thriving trade. Timber was milled there and the strong impetus provided by the discovery of gold at nearby Gympie in 1867 soon established Maryborough as a prosperous commercial and banking centre. Maryborough was also a port of entry and 22,000 immigrants arrived there directly from overseas during the period 1862-1890. In 1863, Patrick Brennan and Martin Geraghty arrived in Maryborough from Ireland. Brennan worked for some time as storekeeper at Kilkivan station and was involved in the early Gympie gold rush. Geraghty, who married Patrick's sister Catherine in 1864, bought land in Lennox Street and built a cottage at no. 64, from which he ran a joinery and undertaking business, then opened a store at what is now no. 60, in 1869. At the time, this section of the street supported a small commercial centre, including a hotel which was across the road from Geraghty's property. In 1871 Patrick Brennan and Martin Geraghty formed a partnership and adapted Martin & Catherine's extended cottage as a store, after removing interior walls. They built a house next to the old store which they used as a receiving depot. Brennan & Geraghty's sold groceries and ordered stores in bulk, being the only importers in Maryborough. By the end of the 1870s, the families had set up orchards. They grew fruit, particularly oranges, to sell and for making marmalade and fruit wines at their factory, which may have incorporated the old store at no. 60. Their products were sold in the store and also wholesaled. The 1880s saw the peak period of the Brennan and Geraghty business empire. The partnership was involved in a number of ventures, ranging from brickmaking to running a cross-river ferry service. In 1886, tenders were called to build a new, ornate facade on the front of the store. Store records show that a sum of was paid to a Mr Hansen to prepare the plans. The contractors, G. Smith and G. Cordwell, began work in May 1886 and the completed work cost . Gas was installed at the same time. The rear room and trolley were added in 1887 at a cost of . The work was carried out by contractors Hansen and Stephenson. This was a boom period in Maryborough as it was for Queensland generally. However, in the following decade Brennan & Geraghty's business began to fail and in 1896 a meeting of the creditors decided to liquidate the firm. In the years between 1886 and 1903, assets were disposed of and all debts were eventually paid out. The store itself was purchased by Frank Geraghty, Martin's son, who rented it back to Brennan & Geraghty for ten shillings a week. In 1902 Michael Geraghty purchased the butcher's shop next door to the store which was owned by the Kruger family. By this time Lennox Street was predominantly residential as it is today. The butcher's shop was demolished and Michael built a house on the site for his mother, Catherine, following his father's death in 1904. This new house was named \\"Uskerty\\" after the birthplace in Ireland of Catherine Geraghty's mother. From 1903, when the partnership of Brennan & Geraghty was finally dissolved, until her death in 1934, Catherine Geraghty ran the store with help from her family, particularly Agnes, Florence and George. In 1934 the Geraghty family also purchased The Cottage at 62 Lennox Street. This was a relocated building which incorporated a 1970s cottage with extensions possibly from the 1890s. The business continued to run until 1971, as George Geraghty wished to complete one hundred years of trading from the premises. He died in 1973. Some of the contents of the house and store were sold after George Geraghty's death and a demolition order was placed on the store by the Maryborough City Council. The whole Geraghty complex was purchased by the National Trust in 1975. By this time, grocery shopping practices had changed and stores like Brennan & Geraghty's were rare. What made this store even rarer was the fact that George had not made changes and had not disposed of stock or records. Many items in the store were no longer manufactured, or are now manufactured or sold in a different form. A fund raising campaign for the conservation of the store and contents was begun in the 1980s and had strong local support. In 1990 the store was opened to the public as a store museum.  Description  Brennan & Geraghty's store museum is situated at 64 Lennox Street, Maryborough and is flanked by a house, \\"Uskerty\\", built for Catherine Geraghty in 1904, and a cottage owned by the Geraghty family since 1934. The store is a large, timber framed building on stumps with a gabled galvanised iron roof and a rendered brick facade. An awning supported on cast iron posts extends over the footpath. Two plate glass show windows flank the entrance and are protected by removable shutters. The interior of the store is divided by two cross walls to form three main spaces. The front section is the shop and is subdivided by an arched screen along a line of former partitions. The centre section contains a small store room in one corner and the rear space is open and without a ceiling. All three rooms are linked by a trolley running on timber rails. The building contains fixed shelving, cabinets, counters, furniture and items associated with running the store. The shop contains a collection of more than 100,000 items, all original to the store. Most stock items date from the interwar period but range from 1885 Canton tea to soap from the 1920s and toilet paper from the 1950s. They are displayed as shop stock and serve to illustrate changes to goods, household needs and shopping practices. An almost complete set of trading records for the store dates back to 1871 and there is an extensive collection of advertising material. The structure of the shop is very intact and reveals a lifetime of changes which demonstrate the growth and recession of the business. The interior remains unpainted except for the shop area, where original painted finishes have been preserved. The exterior has been painted to match the last colour scheme which is believed to be interwar. The stables are sited perpendicular to John Lane at the rear of allotment 10 and are a single skin weatherboard structure with a gabled galvanised iron roof. Floors are earth except for two rooms with timber floors at one end. 'Uskerty' is set back from Lennox Street with more pretension than the cottage at no 62.

It is about 7 kilometers away from the poblacion. Etymology The word \\"sabang\\" refers to a place that can be found at the mouth of a river. Since Sabang is located at the very mouth of the Lagonoy River, obviously, people use it as the name of the place. Historical Accounts=Moro Watchtower This barangay holds interesting historic sites and events. It is in this place where we can find a ruin of the Moro watch tower accordingly built in 1813 by the Spaniards as defense against Moro attacks. Moro piracy was very common in the Pacific Ocean because galleons passed by this area and that the presence of Moro pirates significantly affected the trade and commerce. It was told that Sabang was then a commercial center flocked by trader and buyers from neighboring places from as far as Tigaon and Sag√±ay. There were four cannons mounted in the watchtower. Some months after its completion, an actual combat happened between the Spanish soldiers and the Moros. Indeed, the watchtower served its purpose of being the portal of defense. However, there was no mention of which group was victorious. Old folks accounts said that the construction of the watchtower was done through forced labor or polo method. Exemption from the polo was worth ‚Ç±7.50 for men, and ‚Ç±2.00 for women. Failure to do hard labor or pay the exemption fee meant punishment by lashing (latigo) usually from 12-25 lashes. The watchtower was destroyed during the occupation of the American forces. It was also this time that there was a Japanese Imperial Army stationed thereat and American planes raided and bombarded the place upon seeing the hoisted Japanese flag along the river bank. Accordingly, the watchtower was cut down by the said bombardment to the height that it has now. There was even a mystery about the loss of the cannons that were mounted. Geography and Demographics Barangay Sabang is classified as an urban place and is composed of 6 puroks or zones. It is generally described as plain and coastal with a total land area of 41.489800 hectares.

Although Boston was by no means the only American city to undertake a plan of school desegregation, the forced busing of students from some of the city's most impoverished and racially segregated neighborhoods led to an unprecedented level of violence and turmoil in the city's streets and classrooms and made national headlines.  History = Civil Rights Act of 1964  Black children‚Äôs achievement levels were consistently lower than those of white children. Their dropout rates were higher, their schools were dilapidated, their textbooks were out-of-date, and their o≈øten demoralized teachers were more concerned with maintaining order than with teaching. In cities as large as Chicago, New York, Detroit, and Denver, and as small as Plainfield, New Jersey, and Stamford, Connecticut, black mothers mobilized to improve the quality of their children‚Äôs education. They fought for integration via busing, mostly because they believed it was the best way to address the problem quickly. White children went to well- funded, well-equipped schools that were o≈øten underpopulated. Black mothers, such as those who organized Chicago‚Äôs Truth Squad or Englewood, New Jersey‚Äôs Englewood Movement, sought to place these ‚Äúneighborhood schools‚Äù within the reach of black children. NAACP lawyers supported them, arguing that there was no difference between school segregation that occurred as a result of a legal mandate (de jure segregation) and that which occurred as a result of state- sanctioned real estate discrimination (de facto segregation). Both resulted in black deprivation. 32 Black education advocates met with stiff resistance from whites, also mostly mothers, who greeted black children with racial epithets. In a nationally televised address on June 6, 1963, President John F. Kennedy urged the nation to take action toward guaranteeing equal treatment of every American regardless of race. Soon after, Kennedy proposed that Congress consider civil rights legislation that would address voting rights, public accommodations, school desegregation, nondiscrimination in federally assisted programs, and more. Despite Kennedy‚Äôs assassination in November 1963, his proposal culminated in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson just a few hours after House approval on July 2, 1964. The act outlawed segregation in businesses such as theaters, restaurants, and hotels. It banned discriminatory practices in employment and ended segregation in public places such as swimming pools, libraries, and public schools. In Plainfield, a≈øter a 1964 state order to desegregate schools, black students found the words ‚Äúnigger steps‚Äù and ‚Äúnigger entrance‚Äù painted on parts of Plainfield High School.  Racial Imbalance Act  In 1965 legislature passed the Racial Imbalance Act. This law defined a racially imbalanced school as one with over 50 percent non-white students, and stated that any imbalanced school system could lose state funds.  Resistance  White resistance forced African Americans to reconsider busing. Not only did Republicans, who had initiated the program, withdraw support, but by the 1970s whites who could do so had either moved to suburban areas that were beyond the reach of desegregation orders or sent their children to private schools.  R.O.A.R  Restore Our Alienated Rights was an anti-desegregation busing organization formed in Boston, Massachusetts by Boston School Committee chairwoman Louise Day Hicks in 1974. Using tactics modeled on the civil rights movement, ROAR activists led marches in Charlestown and South Boston, public prayers, sit-ins of school buildings and government offices, protests at the homes of prominent Bostonians, mocked funerals, and even a small march on Washington DC. By 1976, with the failure to block implementation of the busing plan, the organization declined.  Violence  South Boston = Hostile crowds gathered outside South Boston high school almost daily. In response to the violence, Judge Arthur Garrity, architect of the original Boston school desegregation plan, issued a judicial order in September 1975 that prohibited groups of three or more persons from gathering within 100 yards of the school. = Hyde Park = At Hyde Park High, on January 9, 1975, the second day back to school after the winter break, a fist fight in the first floor corridor erupted into a series of confrontations that spilled out into the streets of Hyde Park, causing police to rush to the scene. Police arrested 15 students, 13 of whom were black, and classes were suspended after the third period. On January 21, 1976 violence broke out at Hyde Park High. Thirteen hundred black and white students fought each other throughout the school. = Senator Ted Kennedy = Senator Ted Kennedy was giving a speech. Kennedy's speech was interrupted by a rowdy antibusing delegation that peppered the senator with insults, jeers, and name calling. Kennedy was chased to his car which had already been vandalized. Kennedy had to be whisked away by police to a train station whereto crowd hurled stones at the departing train. = Progressive Labor Party = On May 3, there was a skirmish involving the South Boston youth and members of the PLP.The PLP were attempting to march from Dorchester to South Boston to the home of Louise Day Hicks, a prominent leader of the antibusing cause. About 100 South Boston residents returned to the parade route with baseball bats, hockey sticks, and rocks in an attempt to disrupt the march. The PLP riot sparked another melee at Hyde Park High School that lasted for two days on May 7 and 8. On May 9, an angry crowd at South Boston High threatened to throw projectiles at black students attempting to exit the school. = Theodore Landsmark = On April 5, 1976, Theodore Landsmark, a black lawyer and executive director of the Boston Contractors' Association, was on his way to a meeting at City Hall when he was intercepted by a delegation of South Boston and Charlestown High students who were leaving the city council chamber after having aired their views on busing.As Landmark crossed through the plaza, he was accosted by the marchers, struck several times in the side and back, and belted by the staff of an American flag.

In response to an epidemic within the Singaporean Muslim community of women being abandoned by their husbands through inexpensive, informal divorces, Siraj and the PPIS successfully pressed for the formation of a Syariah Court. Siraj was the first case worker for the court, which had authority over marriages and divorces. In addition to her work with the PPIS, Siraj worked with a number of other organizations that worked to improve women's welfare. Early life Khatijun Nissa Siraj was born in 1925, the daughter of a wealthy businessman of Indian descent. Before becoming an activist, Siraj spent her time as a volunteer at the St. Andrew's Mission Hospital and as a member of the management committees of the Singapore Children's Society and the Family Planning Association. Siraj was often the only Muslim woman on the committees that she sat on, which led her to fear that there was no one looking out for the interests of Muslim women. Activism During the 1950s, the divorce rate within the Singaporean Muslim community was almost 80 percent. Men were able to divorce their wives by paying $90 over three months, and needed only to verbally state that they wanted a divorce; they were then free to remarry immediately. Women did not have a say in whether or not they wanted a divorce, and there was no requirement that the wife be informed of the impending divorce before it took place. Additionally, polygamy and child marriage were still legal, and there were few legal protections against domestic abuse. In 1952, Siraj and 21 other Muslim women from a diversity of ethnic groups co-founded the Young Women's Muslim Association, or Persatuan Permudi Islam Singapura (PPIS). The group originally spread by word-of-mouth, and some members joined even though they had reason to fear that their husbands would leave them if they became involved in the group. The organization pressed lawmakers to create better legal protection for women. Their legislative victories included the outlawing of polygamy and the formation of a Syariah Court in November 1958; Siraj was the court's first caseworker. The court had jurisdiction over marriage and divorce, could order husbands to pay alimony, and before polygamy was outlawed, could force a husband to secure his first wife's consent before marrying a second wife. The book Our Lives to Live: Putting a Woman's Face to Change in Singapore credits Siraj, Che Zahara binte Noor Mohamed, and Shirin Fozdar as the main forces behind the court's formation. In 1961 the Women's Charter, a significant piece of legislation for women's rights, was passed. Despite the passage of the Charter, and improvements to divorce and polygamy laws, women in the community were in need of social services. In 1964 Siraj founded the Muslim Women's Welfare Council, which provided women with legal and medical advice, as well as charitable aid. In 2014, Khatijun Nissa Siraj was recognized for her social and advocacy work by the Singapore Council of Women's Organisations, which inducted Siraj into the Singapore Women's Hall of Fame.

It was designed by James Robertson and built from 1878 to 1883 by the Cooper Brothers. It is also known as Melbourne Hotel and Riverview Hotel. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The Criterion Hotel is one of only two three storeyed brick buildings in Maryborough, erected in two stages from 1878 to 1883 for the owner Neil Blue, to a design of local architect, James Robertson. The original township of Maryborough was situated, not in its current place, but on the north of the Mary River, after wharves were established in 1847‚Äì1848, to provide transport for wool from sheep stations on the Burnett River. In 1852 the growing town was gradually transferred to the south of the river which was considered preferable for shipping. Development followed and by March 1861, Maryborough was declared a municipality, the Borough of Maryborough. The area in and around Wharf Street developed as a result of the wharves, and with the construction of the Customs House 1861 and Bonded Store in 1863. The land on which the Criterion Hotel, first known as the Melbourne Hotel, was later built was first acquired by ET Aldridge in May 1852 by a Deed of Grant. An earlier Melbourne Hotel was constructed on the site by 1868, which was a timber building whose proprietor was TN Milner. Neil Blue acquired the hotel in October 1877, and on 22 September 1878, the timber building was burnt down and another hotel was planned by him. Neil Blue was born in Campbelltown, Scotland in 1845, and arrived in Maryborough in 1870 where he was involved with the steam coastal service. He married Sarah Gregory, daughter of local pioneers and the two remained as proprietors of the Melbourne Hotel until their deaths. Blue commissioned a local architect, James Robertson, to design a replacement for the Melbourne Hotel, and tenders were called for this project on 30 November 1878. At this time two storeys were constructed using local builders, the Cooper Brothers and Henry Taylor for timberwork. The same contractors were used in 1883 when the second storey was added, though it is unclear whether this was originally planned by Robertson. The Blues retained the hotel until about 1901, when Mr WE Boyce is listed as the proprietor. By 1916 the name of the hotel changed to the Riverview Hotel and Mr JR Ryan is the proprietor listed. The hotel then changes hands to Mr PJ Joyce and Mrs LM Joyce until 1939. By 1942 the name has changed to the Criterion Hotel with Mrs Mary Gummow as proprietor. The building has experienced many changes including the replacement of a fine cast iron balustrade with a course timber cross braced alternative and the infilling of sections of the ground floor verandah space.  Description  The Criterion Hotel is a three storeyed painted brick building, facing the Mary River on Wharf Street. A hipped corrugated iron roof is concealed by a parapet featuring a linked-circular balustrade, and centrally located moulded pediment. The building has verandahs to the first and second floors and is infilled under this on the ground floor. The verandahs have simple recently constructed timber posts and cross-braced balustrading, The ground floor openings have been substantially altered with the addition of the tiled and rendered brick infill work, though some survive intact. Half glazed french doors with operable transom windows give access to the verandah from the upper floors. Internally the ground floor of the building is much altered although many original elements survive. Entrance is gained from two doors, one, in the infilled section, leading to the public bar and the other, to the accommodation section and dining room. Where intact, the ground floor is generally of plaster walls and ceiling with modest cornices and skirtings throughout. A large moulded archway in the entrance corridors separates the dog legged timber stair from the hall. The stair, which has turned newels and square balusters, is naturally lit by a multi-paned arched window, at the first half landing. The upper floors retain the original planform, of centrally located corridors running parallel to the verandah, off which accommodation rooms are accessed both to the verandah side and to the rear of the building. The rooms feature four panel doors, with large transom windows above, some of which are not glazed but covered with punched metal sheeting. The verandahs are enclosed on the transverse ends with louvred windows and sheeting, and the timber floors have been extended, increasing the width of the verandah.

It was designed by John Smith Murdoch and built in 1899. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 February 2005.  History  The former Maryborough Customs House and associated residence was constructed in 1899 to the design of Queensland Department of Public Work's architect, John Smith Murdoch. The building replaced an earlier customs house and residence constructed in the 1860s. The original township of Maryborough was situated, not in its current place, but on the north of the Mary River, after wharves were established there in 1847-8 providing transport for wool from sheep stations on the Burnett River. In 1850 Surveyor, Hugh Roland Labatt arrived in Maryborough with instructions to \\"examine the River Mary...to suggest ...the best site or sites for the laying out of the town, having regard to the convenience of shipping on one hand and internal communication on the other...also...point out the spots desirable as reserves for public building, church, quay and for places for public recreation.\\" The site recommended by Labatt was not where the settlement was emerging but further east and from the early 1850s this is where the growing town developed. With the separation of Queensland from the colony of New South Wales in 1859, Maryborough was declared a Port of Entry and a sub collector was appointed. As a port, the conditions of importing and exporting from Maryborough were subject to the control of the Queensland Customs Department. Taxation on goods entering and leaving the colony was an important source of revenue for the newly established Queensland Government and, accordingly, customs services were highly regarded and respected. Collectors and sub-collectors were appointed as towns along the coastline were declared Ports of Entry, and although most customs officers commenced their duties in humble or makeshift buildings, the importance of the service soon demanded customs houses of more prominence and grandeur. Brinsley Sheridan, the sub-collector appointed to Maryborough, worked from a customs office established in what became the kitchen of an early Maryborough hotel, which was later known as the Criterion Hotel. In 1861 a purpose built customs house was constructed with funds granted by the government. Tenders were called for the building in early 1861 and the building was ready for occupation in March 1862. The site chosen was adjacent to the wharf area. The buildings erected at this time included a brick customs house facing the river and a timber residence adjoining the rear of the main building. In 1863 the Government Bond Store was constructed on the Customs House Reserve to store goods held on the Customs House site. Through the 1860s and 1870s Maryborough grew rapidly, in response to the discovery of gold in Gympie to which Maryborough served as port and also with the introduction of the railway. The first rail systems were privately owned and linked the wharves with surrounding businesses. In 1881 the North Coast railway line was extended to Gympie. By the 1890s, the 1861 customs house was deteriorating and this was more rapid after a flood in 1893. Soon after this, a decision was made to construct a new Customs House. A large new Brisbane customs house was constructed in 1889 and the high quality and substantial nature of this building inspired many of the customs houses built in the federation period, which included that at Maryborough, and others at Rockhampton, Townsville, Bundaberg and Mackay. In January 1899, Alfred Barton Brady the colonial architect called for tenders for the construction of a customs house and residence in Maryborough. The tender of local contractors, Henry Neale and Son, was accepted with work to be completed within 12 months. The final cost of the two buildings was and they were constructed of locally made brick on concrete foundations with Marseilles roof tiles. The Customs House was single storeyed with a long room, offices, strong room and toilets. The residence was a two storeyed building with six bedrooms and wide verandahs allowing sweeping views of the river. Unlike the previous customs house this building was sited to face Richmond Street and the Court House gardens opposite which had been established with the construction of the new Court House in 1877. The building has been attributed to the architect, John Smith Murdoch who was an architect in the Department of Public Works in Queensland, under the leadership of AB Brady. Murdoch emigrated to Melbourne in 1884 and by July 1885 took a positions with the Queensland Works Department under one of Brady's predecessors, John James Clark, but was retrenched within two years. He returned again to the Department to work on the Victoria Bridge project managed by the then Engineer for Bridges and Government Architect, AB Brady. Brady appointed Murdoch to the position of Draftsman and Inspector of Works in 1897 and to Second Assistant Architect in 1899. In July 1904 Murdoch transferred permanently to the Commonwealth Department of Homes Affairs, where he enjoyed a successful career becoming Director General of Works in 1927. Murdoch, throughout his career, displayed a remarkable talent, designing innovative and well planned buildings of considerable architectural merit. A recent paper on the architecture of Murdoch, discusses his fusion of styles which meld the contemporary desire for an Australian federation architecture which was closely allied with the English Queen Anne style, with the imperial architectural style of Edwardian Baroque creating an individualistic and sensitive manifestation of two cultural phenomena of late nineteenth century in Australian society, namely nationalism and allegiance to the Crown. The principle elements of his style were picturesque asymmetrical massing; overscaled classical elements, including broken pediments, coursing, entablatures, columns; crenellation; Royal Arms motif and other sculptural elements. The paper asserts that examples of Murdoch's architecture have become \\"cultural and architectural icons, proudly displaying Royal Arms conveying authority, tradition and a link to the empire.\\" The Maryborough Customs House is a good example of Murdoch's architecture, integrating the familiarity and aesthetic comfort of the form of Arts and Crafts with the authority and tradition associated with Classical details and motifs. These stylistic elements are employed with an environmental consciousness which pervades the planning of both the customs house and the residence. In 1901 the newly established Australian Federal Government assumed control of the Customs service throughout Australia. This resulted in a change of ownership of the Maryborough Custom House from state to federal government. In 1995 the Customs Service was removed from Maryborough and, although the buildings remain in Commonwealth ownership, they were used as the office of the Electoral Commission and the local Federal Member of Parliament, Warren Truss. Since construction both the customs house and the residence have remained substantially intact with recent internal alterations allowing the buildings to be adaptively reused. In 2001, the customs house became an interpretative centre within the Portside Centre heritage precinct.  Description  Customs House at Maryborough, 1930 The Customs House site contains two buildings, the former Customs House and the associated residence. These building are prominently located on the intersection of Wharf and Richmond Streets, Maryborough where several other important historical sites are located, including the Maryborough Court House, Customs House Hotel, former Bank of New South Wales and the nearby Queens Park. The former Customs House is sited toward the north western end of the site and addresses Richmond Street facing the Court House on the opposite side of the street. The residence, adjacent to the south eastern side of the former Customs House is more inwardly focussed with principal entrance on the southern corner. A small timber framed garage is an early remnant on the site. The former Customs House and residence are constructed from red brick and concrete on a dark brick base, and share similar rough cast stucco detailing. The principal difference in the buildings is that the Customs House is symmetrically composed, more outwardly focused and has details appropriate to public buildings. The residence displays more characteristics of domestic architecture in its scale and detail. The former Customs House is symmetrically arranged, and has a rectangular plan with a Dutch gabled, terracotta clad roof, punctuated centrally by a square planned projection with a separate Dutch gabled roof, giving external expression to the former long room over which it sits. This projection is lined on four sides with face brick surrounded oculi on rough cast stuccoed panels, with brick quoining at the corners of the projection. Flanking this tower element, to the south east and to the north west are rectangular planned chimney stacks, rendered with rough cast stucco. The principal facade, addressing Richmond Street, is dominated by a central entrance projection which integrates the brick fence with the building. The projection features three round arched window openings, which rest on an integrating sill and signage panel, with Art Nouveau lettering \\"H.M. CUSTOMS\\". Above the central opening is a concrete relief panel of the Royal Arms. Openings in the fence on either side of the porch provide access to concrete stairs which lead to smaller open porches on either side of the entrance projection. Large round headed arched openings on the face of the facade give access to these porches. On the outer side of these openings are segmental arched window openings, surrounded with face brick quoining. Excluding the central entrance projection which is face brick, this and all other external walls are face brick to mid-height and then rendered with rough cast stucco with face brick quoining. The side elevations of the former Customs House have two segmental arched window openings. The rear elevation has a centrally located awning supported on oversized and closely spaced curved brackets. Flanking this are a number of window and door openings. Internally the former Customs House is arranged around a large central room, formerly the long room which is under the tower element. This square planned space is divided from four adjacent recesses by round arched openings. The recess to the north west houses an entrance vestibule to which access is provided from the porches off the principal facade. The recesses on the other three sides of the former long room, house an office to the south east, opposite the entrance vestibule, and transitional spaces to doors on the north west and south west leading to offices flanking the long room. Internally the building generally has timber boarded floors, plastered walls and timber boarded ceilings with central fretwork panels featuring intertwined lettering \\"VR\\". Surviving in this building are several intact, though occasionally painted, fireplaces. The residence is an asymmetrical two storeyed building, which shares the use of red face brick and rough cast stucco, on a dark brick base, found on the Customs House. It is an asymmetrically arranged building, with a complex roofline comprising many one and two storeyed hipped and gabled sections. A two storeyed verandah lines the north eastern side of the house. The verandah at the lower level is formed by a brick arcade of large round arched openings, and a timber battened balustrade. The residence has a large variety of window openings which contribute to its complex form, including several oculi, grouped lancet type windows with round arched heads and grouped square arched windows. Many of the windows in the house are glazed with pale glazed leadlight panels of regular geometric patterns. The principal entrance to the residence is via a hipped roof porch which is in the recessed southern corner of the house. The terracotta clad awning of the porch is supported on small concrete Doric columns which rest on a brick plinth. The porch has a tessellated tile floor with a central panel of encaustic tiles. The porch provides access to a central entrance hall from which the stair hall and several other ground floor rooms are accessed. The entrance hall has a timber boarded dado panel, painted rendered walls, an elaborate dentilled timber cornice and a timber boarded ceiling. A small seating recess is separated from the entrance hall with a round arched opening. A similar arched opening separates the dog legged timber stair. The stair hall is naturally lit with an oculus opening at the level of the first landing and three round arched openings at a higher level. The rooms on the upper level are accessed via a central hall leading from the principal stair to another smaller timber stair in the western corner of the building. Generally the interior of the upper floor contains timber boarded ceilings, plastered walls and timber boarded floors. Centrally placed in many of the internal rooms are decorative timber fretwork panels. Several fine fireplaces survive throughout the building.  Heritage listing  The Maryborough Customs House was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 February 2005 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former Maryborough Customs House and Residence, constructed in 1899, demonstrate the growth of the Port of Maryborough in the nineteenth century. The prominence and high quality of the design of the buildings provide evidence of the importance of the customs service in Queensland. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. This substantially intact site which includes a customs house and residence, as well as the Government Bond Store, demonstrates the principle characteristics of a late nineteenth century regional customs precinct, sited adjacent to former wharves. The buildings are characteristic examples of the high quality of design produced by the Public Works Department of Queensland in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The Customs House and Residence are of considerable aesthetic and architectural merit as innovative and well composed public buildings on a prominent Maryborough site. The picturesque massing of the buildings and manipulated classical detailing and elements clearly demonstrate the characteristics of the architecture of John Smith Murdoch in his fusion of Arts and Crafts form with Edwardian Baroque detail. The place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period. The buildings demonstrate considerable creative innovation as very good Queensland examples of the late nineteenth Australian architectural influence of the English Arts and Craft movement. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The building has special associations with the fine Works Department architect, John Smith Murdoch who designed many small innovative public buildings during his employment with the state government before his transfer to the Commonwealth.

Foundation Exos Aerospace is based on both technologies and people from Armadillo Aerospace, a company founded by video game developer John Carmack. Armadillo had competed for the Ansari X Prize for commercial human suborbital spaceflight in the early 2000s and later developed a series of suborbital vehicles. In August 2013, Carmack placed Armadillo in \\"hibernation\\" following the crash of their STIG-B rocket and began \\"actively looking for outside investors to restart work on the company‚Äôs rockets\\". Exos Aerospace was founded in May 2014; former employees of Armadillo Aerospace were a significant part of the founding team. Exos was created to carry on the reusable commercial space craft started by Armadillo Aerospace. Exos even set up their operations in one of Armadillo's former facilities at the Caddo Mills Municipal Airport, in Texas. In 2015, the assets of Armadillo Aerospace were formally sold to Exos Aerospace. Overview Exos Aerospace is focused on suborbital research rockets with an intent of initially launching micro satellites and eventually progressing to autonomous spaceflight. Exos Aerospace is developing the SARGE family for its suborbital vehicles. All research and development is based at the new manufacturing facility in Greenville, Texas. This is inclusive of rocket design, fabrication, assembly, storage and testing. Engines up to 5,000-lbf nominal thrust can be tested on a static test skid at the hangar complex. The company is a NASA REDDI provider and is targeting to qualify to be a NASA IDIQ provider under the Flight Opportunities program. Due to its re-usability, Exos intends to leverage the reusability of the SARGE rocket in development of its orbital technology program that will be manufacturing their Orbital vehicle in a new State of the Art facility in the Basilicata region of Italy. SARGE The SARGE (aka SARGE M1), an acronym of Suborbital Autonomous Rocket with GuidancE, is a suborbital rocket based on the STIG-B rocket platform developed as part of Armadillo Aerospace's lunar lander program. The SARGE vehicle employs a LOX-ethanol propulsion module based on the LE23000FC series engines, producing approximately 5500 lbs of thrust. The airframe is a reusable sounding rocket with a diameter, and is tall. Helium pressurant cold gas thrusters provide attitude control for pitch-roll-yaw and pointing capability. Payload must fit inside a diameter cylinder, be no more than tall (in its standard configuration) and weigh no more than . Exos plans to use this technology as the design basis for a reusable (first stage) launch vehicle capable of carrying 100kg to low Earth orbit. The SARGE suborbital sounding rocket is designed to be reusable. As of 27 October 2019, no SARGE rocket had reached its intended suborbital altitude, and thus the rocket has not demonstrated its reusability. EXOS Aerospace operates from Spaceport America. On 14 February 2018, the Federal Aviation Administration issued Exos Aerospace a Reusable Vehicle Mission Launch License. Launches ;First On 25 August 2018, Exos flew an unsuccessful Pathfinder Mission proving SARGE as a Reusable Launch Vehicle. Due to a malfunction of an onboard GPS receiver, the flight was terminated with an engine shutdown prematurely. The rocket reached an altitude of 28 km (planned altitude was 80 km). ;Second The second launch of SARGE took place on 2 March 2019. Due to winds, the flight reached an altitude of 20 km (planned altitude was 80 km). It carried several small research payloads. ;Third On 29 June 2019, at 18:00, UTC Exos Aerospace conducted a SARGE launch at the Spaceport America in New Mexico. The flight failed seconds into the flight due to loss of control. The rocket was however recovered intact. This was the third SARGE flight, with previous flights in August 2018 and March 2019. The previous flights also suffered issues that prevented the rocket from reaching the planned altitude. The third flight was carrying educational, research and technology demonstration payloads to nine customers. Among them were a biomedical experiment from the Mayo Clinic and dust aggregation experiment from University of Central Florida. The status of payloads is unknown,https://rocketrundown.com/exos-aerospace-recovers-sarge- vehicle-despite-anomaly/ but probably they were recovered intact. ;Fourth The fourth flight on 26 October 2019, 17:42 UTC, ended in failure. The flight suffered multiple failures: first, the rocket lost control of attitude seconds after launch. Second, the rocket appears to have disintegrated to some degree as several pieces of debris felt back to the ground. Third, the launch vehicle separated from the drogue. Rather than land softly as it had on previous flights, it returned uncontrolled and at high speed. The rocket body crashed near the launch pad nearly three and a half minutes after liftoff. Live footage seems to indicate the nose cone was properly returning under a parachute canopy. The rocket reached a peak altitude of about , far short of the planned altitude of at least 80 kilometers. The flight carried several small research payloads.https://spacenews.com/exos-aerospace-suborbital- launch-fails/ Exos Aerospace concluded that the failure of the fourth flight was due to structural failure. They plan to build a second SARGE rocket (they have built only one; the one and same rocket was used on all four launches in 2018-2019) to continue flying.https://spacenews.com/exos-blames-suborbital- launch-accident-on-structural-failure/ References Aerospace companies of the United States Companies based in the Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth metroplex American companies established in 2014 Manufacturing companies established in 2014 Technology companies established in 2014 Private spaceflight companies Rocket engine manufacturers of the United States Manufacturing companies based in Texas Privately held companies based in Texas Space access 2014 establishments in Texas ","title":"Exos Aerospace"},{"id":"48475152","text":"Huang Tien-mu () or Thomas Huang is a Taiwanese politician.

The extent of the damage caused by the tailings dam collapse is the largest ever recorded with pollutants spread along of watercourses. The failure of the dam released 43.7 million cubic metres of mine tailings into the Doce River, causing a toxic brown mudflow to pollute the river and beaches near the mouth when it reached the Atlantic Ocean 17 days later. The disaster created a humanitarian crisis as hundreds were displaced and cities along the Doce River suffered water shortages when their water supplies were polluted. The total impact of the disaster, including the reason for failure and the environmental consequences, are officially under investigation and remain unclear. The owner of the Bento Rodrigues dam, Samarco, was subject to extensive litigation and government sanctions. In 2016, charges of manslaughter and environmental damage were filed against 21 executives, including Samarco's former CEO and representatives from Samarco's owners, Vale and BHP Billiton, on its board of directors. Controversy over the investigation grew after a 2013 report, indicating structural issues in the dam, was leaked.  Background  The Fund√£o tailings dam was constructed and owned by Samarco Minera√ß√£o SA, a mining company, near Mariana, a municipality southeast of Belo Horizonte, in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The tailings dam was built by Samarco to accommodate the waste resulting from the extraction of iron ore taken from extensive Germano mine, located in the Mariana district of Santa Rita Dur√£o. The Fund√£o dam was constructed in hills near the village and subdistrict of Bento Rodrigues, located north of Mariana city.  Incident  At approximately 3:30pm on 5 November 2015, the Fund√£o dam began to leak. Immediately, a team of outsourced employees was sent to the scene, and they tried to mitigate the leak by deflating part of the reservoir. At around 4:20pm, a rupture occurred, releasing a large volume of toxic sludge into the Santar√©m river valley. Bento Rodrigues, which lies away in the valley below the dam, was almost entirely flooded by the cascade of toxic water and mud. Other villages and districts in the Gualaxo river valley, also in the region of Mariana, suffered minor damage. Bento Rodrigues is only accessible by unpaved back roads. The incident rendered Bento Rodrigues completely inaccessible by road, hindering firefighters' rescue efforts. The only available method of transport into or out of the location was via helicopter. There was a school in the area where the flood occurred, and the teachers were able to remove the students before school. Samarco and the neighboring communities did not have a contingency plan or evacuation routes in the event of dam failure. Had such plans existed, residents may have been able to evacuate in a timely manner to more secure regions. Around 600 people were evacuated to Mariana, and troops of the Brazilian Armed Forces were deployed to assist.  Impact  According to a United Nations report, the tailings slurry traveled 620 km downriver, eventually reaching the Atlantic Ocean. Nineteen people were killed, \\"Entire fish populations ‚Äì at least 11 tons ‚Äì were killed immediately when the slurry buried them or clogged their gills\\", and \\"the force of the mudflow destroyed of riparian forest.\\"United Nations, Mine tailings storage: Safety is no accident, Report summary , circa 2015. Accessed June 2018.  Contamination of Rio Doce  At around 6:30pm on the day of 5 November, the tailings of iron ore reached the Rio Doce. The river basin has a drainage area of about 86,715 square kilometres, with 86% in Minas Gerais and Esp√≠rito Santo. In total, the river covers 230 municipalities that use its bed for subsistence. The waste also reached the hydroelectric power plant of Risoleta Neves in Santa Cruz do Escalvado within 100 kilometres of Mariana. According to the company that runs the power plant, its functioning was not affected. On 9 November, the city of Governador Valadares stopped the water intakes due to the mud on the Rio Doce. The next day, a State of Public Calamity was decreed in response to the water shortage in the city. According to analyses carried out in the city, the mud contains greater than acceptable concentrations of heavy metals, substances harmful to health, such as arsenic, lead and mercury. There are concerns about contamination of the nearby , a tributary of the Doce River, due to the toxic substances stored at the facility.  Contamination of southern Atlantic ocean  On 22 November, fine waste particles in suspension reached the Atlantic Ocean. On 7 January 2016, fine waste particles reached the southern Bahia littoral zone. Environmentalists are monitoring the impact to the Abrolhos Marine National Park wildlife. The park is considered of vital importance to the Brazilian ecosystem since it hosts the greatest marine biodiversity in the whole southern Atlantic ocean.  Aftermath = Investigation of the causes  On the first quarter of November 2015, the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies and the state chambers of Minas Gerais and Esp√≠rito Santo each created a special commission to follow the case, and the actions taken. According to the press, many of the deputies that composed such commissions had received donations from Vale to finance their campaigns. Such donations, summing up to R$2.6 million are legal, and were reported by the then-candidates to the Brazilian Election Justice. However, critics argued that the deputies' participation was clearly biased. In January 2016, the leaking of internal documents from 14 months before the disaster revealed that Samarco had been warned about the possibility of the dam collapses. Joaquim Pimenta de √Åvila, an engineer who was regarded as one of the foremost tailing dam engineers in Brazil, had been contracted by Samarco between 2008 and 2012 to design and oversee the construction of the Fund√£o dam. From 2013, √Åvila was hired part-time as a consultant to inspect the dam, and a technical report he wrote from September 2014 lists severe structural problems on the dam (in the form of cracks) and measures to mitigate them, the main one being the construction of a buttress. Samarco claimed to have implemented all the recommendations from √Åvila, and that the dam was in the process of being heightened when the landfill reached its maximum holding capacity and began to leak. However, Samarco failed to comment specifically about the buttress, and claims that it was never warned about the severity of the structural damages, nor about the imminence of a catastrophic failure. In August 2016, the report of an investigation panel constituted by Samarco and its shareholders was published online The investigation panel findings indicated that the liquefaction flowsliding resulted from multiple factors, including an increase in the saturation of the tailings due to modifications in the design of the dam and the presence of soft slimes in unintended areas on the left abutment of the dam. Another study indicated that the dam failure could not be predicted based on simple limit equilibrium analyses and that only a complex failure mechanism would explain the dam collapse.  Sanctions to Samarco  Samarco president Ricardo Vescovi The Minas Gerais government suspended Samarco's activities immediately after the disaster. Next, the Brazilian government fined Samarco (US$66.3 million) for the incident. The fine was preliminary and was expected to be increased if the two companies were found guilty of water pollution and damages. Succumbing to external pressure, BHP Billiton, together with Vale and Samarco, signed in 2016 an agreement with the Brazilian federal and state authorities. In January 2016, the Brazilian government and Samarco reached an agreement and a fine of (US$4.8 billion) was issued. The penalty did not include compensation to people affected by the disaster, and the cost of recovering the polluted area. By July 2016, BHP made a provision of US$2.3-2.5 billion for costs associated with the compensation agreement between Samarco's shareholders (BHP and Vale) and Brazilian federal, state and municipal authorities.  Legal consequences  Vale and BHP Billiton own Samarco as a joint venture, with each company possessing a 50% stake. As of 2018, the companies remain in negotiations with Brazilian authorities in efforts to settle out of court. In March 2016, Samarco agreed to pay US$2.3 billion in compensation. Australia's ABC reported that Samarco and its joint venture partners would \\"establish a foundation to develop and execute environmental and socio-economic programs to restore the environment, local communities and social conditions of the affected areas.\\" In June 2016, an AUD$8 billion civil suit which was reinstated by Brazil's Superior Court after the original agreement was suspended. BHP, along with its Samarco joint venture partner Vale, face a separate $58 billion suit lodged by federal prosecutors. In October 2016 it was reported that Brazilian prosecutors had filed manslaughter and environmental charges against 21 people including top executives of Samarco's owners: BHP Billiton, an Anglo-Australian multinational mining, metals and petroleum company headquartered in Melbourne, Australia and the world's largest mining company, and Vale SA, the third-largest mining company in the world and the Public Eye People's Worst Company award winner of 2012. In June 2018, Samarco, Vale and BHP signed an agreement to drop a US$7 billion lawsuit and allow two years for the companies to address the greater US$58 billion suit seeking social, environmental and economic compensation. = Class action law suits = In August 2018, BHP settled a class action suit in the US for US$50 million, with no admission of liability. At the same time, it was facing a class action lawsuit from shareholders in Australia related to the dam failure and losses incurred by shareholders following company disclosures to the market regarding the safety of the dam. The class action is expected to be one of the largest in Australian history, with 30,000 BHP shareholders involved, with a combined shareholding of 330 million shares, valued at over AU$10 billion (at 30 October 2018). In November 2018, UK-based legal firm SPG Law filed a US$5 billion group action in the High Court at Liverpool under Brazilian law against BHP Billiton PLC, which operated in Brazil through Samarco, a joint venture with Vale, on behalf of 235,000 Brazilian individuals and organizations, including municipal governments, utility companies, indigenous tribes and the Catholic Church. The lawsuit is one of the biggest legal claims ever filed in a British court. The case, which has been the subject of jurisdictional challenge, has been delayed due to the Covid-19 outbreak.  Reactions = National  The city immediately began a campaign to collect donations for the homeless, stressing the urgent need for donations of toothbrushes, towels, glasses, cutlery, disposable dishes and especially drinking water. Also a bank account was opened to receive cash donations. All municipal events since the day of the disaster until 16 November were canceled. The note from the Mayor's Office said that \\"at this point, the city of Mariana is focused on rescue work and support\\". The Federal Government, through the Minister's Chief of Staff, Jaques Wagner, put the Federal forces at the disposal of the State of Minas Gerais. The Minister came into contact with the Governor, Fernando Pimentel, to put the Federal forces. Jaques Wagner announced President Dilma Rousseff on accident before loading it back from a trip to Brazil to Bras√≠lia. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mariana said: \\"We express our most heartfelt sympathy to the families who have had their homes and property destroyed and those who mourn the death of their loved ones, victims of this disaster of incalculable proportions. The point is to unite efforts to minimise the distress and suffering of all those affected by this tragedy. We call upon our communities to provide support to victims. [...]. We pray to God to strengthen and comfort, with your generous love, all who have been affected by this accident\\". The Diocese of Itabira and Three Lakes and the East Regional II CNBB, comprising the territories of the States of Minas Gerais and Esp√≠rito Santo, also issued notes of solidarity with those affected by tragedy. A football match between Cruzeiro and S√£o Paulo on 8 November in Belo Horizonte hosted a collection of resources to help the victims.  International  A report by experts of the United Nations contradicted repeated statements by the Brazilian government and the involved mining companies that the released chemicals were harmless. Instead, the report indicated that the released mud contained high levels of toxic heavy metals and other toxic chemicals and also criticized the slow release of information. Although heavy metals were found, the difference in concentration was found not to differ significantly from that found in the 2010 geologic survey. The report said the tailings that entered the Rio Doce were composed of clay and silt from the processing of earth containing iron ore, which is naturally abundant in the region. The French spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Romain Nadal expressed their condolences. A spokesman commented: \\"We were told with emotion of the disruption of the mining dams in the State of Minas Gerais in the Southeast region.\\" American band Pearl Jam, who performed in Belo Horizonte on 20 November 2015, promised to donate the proceeds of the concert to victims of the disaster. Singer Eddie Vedder gave a speech calling for harsh punishments to be applied to Samarco and others involved.

She is the Patroness of the Apostolic Vicariate of Northern Arabia. The image was advocated by Pope Pius XII who authorised its devotion, while Pope John XXIII granted a Canonical Coronation to the venerated image on 25 March 1960 through Cardinal Valerian Gracias. On 5 January 2011, the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments proclaimed her Patroness of the Apostolic Vicariate of Northern Arabia and designated the feast of the image on the Saturday preceding the Second Sunday of Ordinary Time with the permission to celebrate it also on Friday or Sunday. Church where the image is enshrined and venerated. History The original image is derived from an image of Our Lady of Mount Carmel brought to Al Ahmadi, Kuwait on 1 May 1948. On the Feast of the Immaculate Conception 1948, the priest, Father Teofano Ubaldo Stella of the Carmelite Order had it framed and brought out for veneration. In 1949, the Legion of Mary used their own image of Miraculous Medal, which encouraged Father Stella to commission an image in Italy under the sculpting company Rosa and Zanzio Ditta to carve a statue of the Madonna and Child using a cedar of Lebanon. The image was brought to Pope Pius XII who also venerated the image and authorised its Marian title. On Orthodox Christmas, 6 January 1950, the statue was returned to Kuwait for public veneration by the faithful. In 1954, Kuwaiti soldiers travelled to Rome for the hundredth anniversary of the Dogma of the Immaculate Conception, and presented another replica of the image at the Parish of Saint Teresa in Rome. On 16 September 1954, the same image was brought to Pope Pius XII, who blessed the statue at Castel Gandolfo. In May 1956, Pius XII sent a special candle to the new parish built in Ahmadi, especially chosen by him from that year's Candlemas ceremonies in Rome. In 1956, Bishop Stella petitioned the Holy See to proclaim the Blessed Virgin Mary under the title of Our Lady of Arabia as Patroness of Kuwait. Pope Pius XII granted his consent via the Papal bull Regnum Mariae on 25 January 1957. A solid gold crown studded with precious rubies and diamonds was crafted and then brought to Rome, where Pope John XXIII personally blessed it on 17 March 1960. Bishop Stella donated a particular pearl to the crown as well. The Canonical coronation was further authorised by Pope John XXIII, which occurred on 25 March 1960 via the Papal legate Cardinal Valerian Gracias of Bombay. on 5 January 2011, Pope Benedict XVI approved the patronage by assigning the Marian title was the principal patroness for the Apostolic Vicariate of Northern Arabia.

Nipple stimulation or breast stimulation is stimulation of the breast. Stimulation may be by breastfeeding, sexual activity, or an indirect non-sexual response. As part of sexual activity, the practice may be performed upon, or by, people of any gender or sexual orientation. It may occur with the use of fingers, orally, such as by sucking or licking, as well as by use of an object. Nipple stimulation may produce sexual excitement, and erect nipples can be an indicator of an individual's sexual arousal. Adult women and men report that breast stimulation may be used to both initiate and enhance sexual arousal, and a few women report experiencing orgasm from nipple stimulation. Development and anatomy Male and female breasts, nipples and areolas develop similarly in the fetus and during infancy. At puberty, the male's breasts remain rudimentary but the female's develop further, mainly due to the presence of estrogen and progesterone, and become much more sensitive than the male ones. Smaller female breasts, however, are more sensitive than larger ones. Physiological response Oral nipple stimulation Breasts, and especially the nipples, are erogenous zones. Nipple stimulation may result in sexual arousal, and erect nipples can be an indicator of an individual's sexual arousal. The individual's sexual partner may find such erection erotically stimulating.Nipple/Breast Stimulation and Sexual Arousal in Young Men and Women, The Journal of Sexual Medicine, Vol 3, May 2006. by Roy Levin. A survey in 2006 found that sexual arousal in about 82% of young females and 52% of young males occurs or is enhanced by direct stimulation of nipples, with only 7‚Äì8% reporting that it decreased their arousal. The stimulation of women's nipples from suckling, including breastfeeding, promotes the production and release of oxytocin and prolactin. Besides creating maternal feelings, it also decreases a woman's anxiety and increases feelings of bonding and trust. Oxytocin is linked to sexual arousal and pair bonding, but researchers are divided on whether breastfeeding commonly incites sexual feelings. Nipple erection during sexual arousal or breastfeeding are both caused by the release of oxytocin. Nipple erection is due to the contraction of smooth muscle under the control of the autonomic nervous system, and is a product of the pilomotor reflex which causes goose bumps. Few women report experiencing orgasm from nipple stimulation. Before Komisaruk et al.'s functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) research on nipple stimulation in 2011, reports of women achieving orgasm from nipple stimulation relied solely on anecdotal evidence. Komisaruk's study was the first to map the female genitals onto the sensory portion of the brain; it indicates that sensation from the nipples travels to the same part of the brain as sensations from the vagina, clitoris and cervix, and that these reported orgasms are genital orgasms caused by nipple stimulation, and may be directly linked to the genital sensory cortex (\\"the genital area of the brain\\").

It means 'a commander of a body of troops'.Poerwadarminta, 1986 In the past it is used to call some prominent military leaders in several kingdoms, such as Panglima Polem from Aceh. In modern times it is reserved for the chiefs of the armed forces of Indonesia and Malaysia and some other posts. Use in Indonesia=Panglima Tertinggi Angkatan Bersenjata Republik Indonesia upright=0.75 Per Indonesian Constitution the President of Indonesia is the Supreme Commander of Indonesian Armed Forces (Panglima Tertinggi Angkatan Bersenjata Republik Indonesia). Essentially it is parallel to the title 'Commander-in-Chief' in other countries, e.g. the United States. During the Old Order era, this title is included into many honorific titles that were often mentioned each time Sukarno's name was written or read in speeches, edicts, or news. Panglima TNI In Indonesian National Armed Forces the highest position overseeing the three branches - Army, Navy, Air Force - is called Panglima Tentara National Indonesia ('Commander of the Indonesian National Armed Forces'). Before the separation of the National Police from the Armed forces in 2000, the Armed Forces consisted of four branches. The Armed Forces were named Angkatan Bersenjata Republik Indonesia, which comprised TNI and the Police. The commander of the Armed Forces was called Panglima ABRI accordingly, or usually known with the acronym Pangab. According to the revised Constitution Panglima TNI is appointed by the President after confirmed by DPR. Before the Constitution was amended in 2002, the President had the prerogative right to appoint or dismiss the 'Panglima' at his pleasure. Panglima Besar Panglima Besar General Sudirman (center), the first Commander of Indonesian National Armed Forces, arriving in Jakarta on 1 November 1946 The honorific title Panglima Besar, meaning 'Grand Commander' was bestowed informally upon Sudirman, the first Commander of the Armed Forces and legendary leader of guerilla war during Indonesian National Revolution (1945‚Äì1949). Other Military Use Beside the use for 'Panglima TNI', the title 'Panglima' is also used for many formations within the Armed Forces. Major General Suharto in his office as Panglima Kostrad, (Commander of the Strategic Reserve Command), 1963 The commander of Kostrad, a formation within the Indonesian Army, is called 'Panglima Kostrad'. One of such notable Panglima Kostrad is the first, Suharto, who later became a President of Indonesia (1968‚Äì1998), and the second, Umar Wirahadikusumah, who became Vice President of Indonesia (1983‚Äì1988). Each commander of Military Territorial Commands (Komando Daerah Militer, usually known with the acronym Kodam) has the title 'Panglima Daerah Militer' or Pangdam. There are 17 Kodam, each with one Pangdam. Each commander of the three Fleet Commands is given title 'Panglima'. The commander of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Fleet Command (Komando Armada I/II/III), are known as Panglima Armada I/II/III or Pangarmada I/II/III. Similar to the Navy, each commander of the three Air Force Operations Commands is also given title 'Panglima'. The commander of Air Force Operations Command - 1/2/3 (Komando Operasi TNI Angkatan Udara I/II/II or Koopsau I/II/III), are known as Panglima Koopsau I/II/III. The Highest position in Military Sea-lift Command (Komando Lintas Laut Militer /Kolinlamil) are given the title of 'Panglima', which is Panglima Kolinlamil. National Air Defence Forces Command (Komando Pertahanan Udara Nasional /Kohanudnas) also use the title of 'Panglima' for its highest position, which is Panglima Kohanudnas and for its each Commander of Air Defense Sector (Panglima Komando Sektor Pertahanan Udara Nasional or Pangkosek Hanudnas). Use in the Past Upon the formation of the Fourth Working Cabinet (19 November 1963), the title 'Panglima' was used for the commander of each branch of Indonesian Armed Forces.Aside from the three branches - Army, Navy, Air Force - Indonesian National Police was included in the Armed Forces since 1962 until it was excluded again in 2004. They were also members of the Cabinet. Therefore, they were given the title Menteri (Minister), appointed directly by the President. As such, their titles were: * Minister/Commander of the Army (Menteri/Panglima Angkatan Darat, abbreviated Menpangad) * Minister/Commander of the Navy (Menteri/Panglima Angkatan Laut, abbreviated Menpangal) * Minister/Commander of the Air Force (Menteri/Panglima Angkatan Udara, abbreviated Menpangau) * Minister/Commander of the Police (Menteri/Panglima Angkatan Kepolisian, abbreviated Menpangak) This use was discontinued in the New Order era, replaced with the title Kepala Staf (Chief of Staff) for the commander of three branches and Kepala (Chief) for the Chief of National Police. Use in Malaysia=Panglima Angkatan Tentera In Malaysian Armed Forces (Angkatan Tentera Malaysia) the highest position overseeing the branches - Army, Navy, Air Force - is called Panglima Angkatan Tentera Malaysia (in official English translation: Chief of Defence Force). Panglima Tentera Each branch of Malaysian Armed Forces has a Panglima at its head. Chief of Army is Panglima Tentera Darat, Chief of Navy is Panglima Tentera Laut, and Chief of Air Force is Panglima Tentera Udara. Each of them also has a deputy commander, called Timbalan Panglima (Deputy Chief). Other Use The word 'Panglima' is used for several titles in the orders and decorations of Malaysia, such as Panglima Mangku Negara (P.M.N), Panglima Setia Mahkota (P.S.M.), Panglima Jasa Negara (P.J.N.), and Panglima Setia Diraja (P.S.D.).

It was designed by Samuel Bragg and built in 1889 by Mr Caldwell. It is also known as Mayfair Boarding House. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The former Engineers' Arms Hotel in Maryborough was constructed in 1889 for Ann Dillane, to designs of Samuel Bragg, a local architect. It replaced an earlier building, also called the Engineers' Arms. Settlement at Maryborough commenced in September 1847 when George Furber established a woolstore on the south bank of the Mary River at the head of navigation. He was followed in June 1848 by ET Aldridge and Henry and RE Palmer, who established their own wharves on the opposite riverbank, at a location now known as the original Maryborough town site at Baddow. In 1850 a new town site was surveyed to the east, at a downstream position which provided better access for shipping. The first sale of land at this new site occurred in 1852, but most residents did not shift to the current centre of Maryborough until 1855 and 1856. Maryborough was gazetted a Port of Entry in 1859 and was proclaimed a municipality, the Borough of Maryborough, in 1861. During the 1860s and 1870s it flourished as the principal port for the nearby Gympie goldfield and as an outlet for timber and sugar. The establishment of manufacturing plants and primary industries sustained growth in the town into the twentieth century. The property on which the hotel is situated was first purchased by William Southerden as a Town Lot on 17 April 1861. The next registered owner was Thomas Dillane who bought the property on 13 December 1872, though he is known to have been running the former hotel on the site since at least 1870. The former Engineers' Arms is so known for the adjacent Walkers' Engineering Works and Foundry which began operations in 1868, supplying mining equipment firstly to the goldfields which were flourishing in Gympie and then, later, more widely. The original two- storey timber hotel may have been constructed in 1870, as the date on the parapet of the present building indicates. By 1889, the Licensing Authority operating within the Maryborough district, under the provisions of the Licensing Act 1885, was becoming stricter with the licensees of hotels about the condition of the buildings and provision of services. It may have been as a result of this that the Engineers' Arms Hotel was replaced with a two-storey brick building, to a design by Samuel Bragg, who was a former employee of the Works Department. The building was constructed by local contractor Mr Caldwell and ready for business on 5 July 1889. Two single-storey brick cottages at the rear of the hotel were thought to have been constructed as residential accommodation at this time. Changes to the building fabric include the narrowing of the upper floor verandah, where, it seems the timber had rotted at the ends and was therefore cut away making it necessary to taper the verandah posts from their original fixed position to the new narrower width of the walkway. The hotel, which ceased operating in 1951, has subsequently been the Mayfair Guest or Boarding House, a restaurant, community centre and otherwise used as accommodation. In September 2015, it was advertised for sale as having four leased commercial spaces with a first-floor apartment.  Description  The former Engineers' Arms Hotel is a two-storeyed rendered brick building located on what once was a five-way intersection but is now four-way. The site contains two single-storeyed brick buildings to the rear of the hotel. The hotel, which has a hipped corrugated iron roof concealed by a string coursed parapet, is built to the property boundary of an acute angled block, giving it a V-shaped plan, truncated at the corner. The corner is emphasised with the addition of a pedimental element, projecting above the parapet. A relief moulding of the date \\"1870\\" appears on the parapet on this corner. The building is lined on the March, Kent and Bowen Street facades with a two- storeyed verandah. The ground level of this has a shallow curved corrugated iron awning supported on cast iron columns, many of which have been replaced. The upper floor verandah, which continues to the rear of the building, has a skillion awning supported on timber columns which taper outwards from the building, due to the altered width of the verandah walkway. There are three entrances to the hotel from the principal facades, a corner entrance, being a double, four-panelled and moulded timber door, to what was previously the public bar; and two doorways on March Street, one through an arched opening featuring multi-pane glazed sidelights and transom, and a four-panelled and moulded timber door. The exterior joinery is substantially intact and of high quality. All openings are untreated but for plaster sills. The arched doorway leads to the stair hall, off which the principal ground floor rooms are accessed as well as the timber dog-legged stair. The stairway is naturally lit by an arched landing window. Internally, the building retains much of its early joinery, ceiling and wall cladding, timber ceiling roses and fireplaces. The plan arrangement remains intact.  Heritage listing  The former Engineers' Arms Hotel was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The building demonstrates the growth of Maryborough, particularly as a result of the Gympie goldrush, when Maryborough began producing mining equipment in the area where the hotel stands. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The building is an important element of the streetscapes of the town, and is an interesting example of Queensland country town hotel architecture. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. As the local hotel for the foundry workers for over one hundred years, the Engineers' Arms Hotel has considerable social value to the surrounding community.

It was built from to 1920s. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Eskdale was constructed in about 1864 for the Mayor of Maryborough, James Dowzer. A tender notice in the Maryborough Chronicle of 22 August 1864 reads: 'Tenders are require on or before the 24th instant for the Brick and Stone Work of a Twelve-roomed House - Plans and specifications to be seen at Messrs Dowzer & Purser's.' No architect is specified and it is likely that Dowzer designed the house himself. The original township of Maryborough was situated, not in its current place, but on the north of the Mary River, after wharves were established in 1847-8 providing transport for wool from sheep stations on the Burnett River. In 1850 Surveyor, Hugh Roland Labatt arrived in Maryborough with instructions to \\"examine the River Mary...to suggest ...the best site or sites for the laying out of the town, having regard to the convenience of shipping on one hand and internal communication on the other...also...point out the spots desirable as reserves for public building, church, quay and for places for public recreation.\\" The site recommended by Labatt was not where settlement was established but further east and from the early 1850s this is where the growing town developed. James Dowzer and John Pursers both of Maryborough purchased Suburban Allotment 2 of Section 45, measuring five acres according to a New South Wales land purchase order. This was the land on which James Dowzer constructed a large two storeyed brick house as his residence, later known as Eskdale. Tenders were called in the Maryborough Chronicle for the brick and stone work of a 12 roomed house. It is thought that Dowzer designed his own residence as he is thought to have also designed the Church of England rectory in 1856. Dowzer was born in 1826 at Clongall, County of Carlow, Ireland. In March 1853 he sailed for Queensland aboard the John Fielden and initially gained an appointment in the Ipswich Police Force. After leaving Ipswich, he arrived in Maryborough in November 1854 where he established a local business as a saddler and storekeeper in the fledgling town. He continued in business until about 1865, and was elected as the third Mayor of Maryborough in 1862. Little documentary evidence has been discovered about the origin of Eskdale, although 1864 seems to be the year in which it was built. Clay was apparently carried to the site and bricks were made at the rear of the property. Hand made iron nails were used in the construction of the European beech floor, and hand made brass nails were used in the construction of the doors. Internal joinery was made using local cedar. Edward Bernard Corser, circa 1928 In 1868 James Dowzer retired to a dairy farm near Tiaro and Eskdale was acquired by solicitor Edward Corser, who had arrived in Brisbane in 1863 and moved to Maryborough the following year. The house was reportedly not yet finished when the Corser family moved in, and they named it as a reminder of Eskdale in the Lake District of Northern England. Corser died in 1874, and his son, Edward Bernard Corser, inherited the property. E. B. Corser was a prominent local merchant, establishing the business of Corser and Co., and later a successful politician, serving in both the Legislative Assembly of Queensland and Australian House of Representatives. E. B. Corser died at home at Eskdale while still a serving federal MP in 1928, and Eskdale was transferred to one of his sons, Edward Stewart Corser. E. S. Corser retained ownership until 1961, and it remained in the Corser family until October 1975 when it was bought by Peter and Jacqueline Holtorf. The Holtorfs used the residence as their family home until 1999 when they converted the house into a Bed and Breakfast. The original section of the house has been authentically restored and is used for guests. The house originally stood on five acres of land on which there were three tennis courts, stables and gymnasium all of which were demolished due to subdivision. Of the original property the following buildings (apart from Eskdale House) are still in existence: 345 Ann Street (Stewart Corser's House - 'Charlcombe'), 352 Ann Street (The Gardener's Residence) and 47 Pallas Street (Herbert Corser's house - now 'Rhymney House'). A number of changes have also been made to the house itself. The lead light windows were installed around 1920 along with the pressed metal ceilings. The original roof was slate and the verandah roof was iron with alternate red and white panels. The slate roof was destroyed by a hail storm in 1966 and at the time the three chimney stacks were demolished to roof level, so that a new iron roof could cover them. The verandah roof pitch was also made steeper, so that the iron panels could be placed in a straight line. The decorative cast iron baluster panels on the upper level of the verandahs were likely to have been designed and manufactured in Maryborough. This particular design used on Eskdale is featured in Brian Turner's book, Australia's Iron Lace (p 97), and is referred to as \\"Maryborough iron lace patterns\\". A foundry had operated in Maryborough from 1909 until 1981 run by the Daniels family and it '...produced cast iron panels of its own regional design.'  Description  Eskdale is a substantial two storeyed brick house with stone foundations located on Pallas Street, Maryborough facing another early Maryborough house, Oonooraba, at 50 Pallas Street. The house demonstrates the principal characteristics of the Colonial Georgian style of architecture which is noted for its gentle symmetry and simple rectangular shapes with conservative detailing. The external walls of thick brick in English bond construction. The building has a hipped roof clad with corrugated iron sheeting. The house is lined on three sides with wide verandahs on both levels. The verandahs are incorporated under the main roof of the building and are supported on single stop chamfered timber posts with decorative cast iron brackets and, on the upper floor, cast iron balustrade panels. A valance of lattice marks the first floor level on the face of the verandah. The front facade of the building is symmetrically arranged and two large timber sash windows flank a central doorway framing double timber doors. The front entrance leads into a hall with a central arch way and stairway. The walls are painted a soft green with decorative stencils lining the cornices and chair rails. The stencils have been reproduced from late 19th century styles. The front door is framed by lead-light windows, a fanlight above and rectangular panels on either side as well as two panels in the door itself. Another lead- light window is visible on the landing of the first flight of stairs. The hall leads off to rooms on either side and then through to an extension at the rear. The hall with archway and interior decoration is replicated on the upper floor in the same position. The door to the front verandah has a simple fanlight with textured glass and features a green shamrock at the base of the window. All joists, cross bracing, lintels, doors, architraves and the staircase are of local red cedar. On the northern side of the ground floor hall is a large living room. The wide timber (hoop pine) floor boards are exposed and polished, the walls rendered and painted dark red and the ceiling is lined with decorative pressed metal of the 1920s era. There are two doors accessing the hall at either end of the room. A large timber-framed sash window faces onto the front verandah and two similar windows line the northern side of the room facing the side verandah. This fenestration pattern also occurs in the rooms on the southern side of the house. A large fireplace with timber manell-piece is located in the centre of the rear wall. On the other side of the hall is the dining room at the front and the kitchen at the rear. The dining room contains built-in bookcases of cedar with glass panel doors. The house is set in established gardens with mature trees and still features some of the early outdoor structures and landscapes. The circular driveway at the front of the house is marked by the raised circular lawn with lantana hedge. Evidence of the former sweep of the driveway can be seen in the slight depression of the grounds to the north-west of the house. A landscaped garden on the northern side of the house consists of geometric garden beds set in concrete with concrete paths dating from about 1915. This area is lined by mature palms along its rear edge. A shed stands a short distance to the rear of this garden and includes some 19th century decoration, namely cast iron brackets. This was once the glass house and now stands as a timber framed structure with weatherboard cladding and a corrugated iron roof. There is also an underground brick water tank, deep, the top of which is visible on the back lawn. This water tank is fed by another tank in the centre of the roof of the house not visible from the ground. This roof tank catches the rain water which is then diverted into the underground tank. Similar tank constructions can be seen at nearby Baddow House and they date from the time of construction.  Heritage listing  Eskdale was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Eskdale, a substantial two storeyed brick house dating from about 1864, demonstrates the growth of Maryborough in the 1860s, after new wealth was generated by the nearby Gympie goldfields. It also reflects the trend of pioneering individuals who established themselves as community leaders in early townships to build residences reflective of their social status. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The building is a good, intact example of a substantial 1860s two-storeyed residence in regional Queensland. The surrounding grounds and its various structures and landscapes and are also important in demonstrating the design and workings of an early Queensland regional residence. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The building has aesthetic value as a substantial residence with attractive decorative features and balanced design, within a garden setting. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Eskdale has special associations with both James Dowzer and Edward Bernard Corser who are of importance to Queensland's history.

Feuillet has been working on plant genetics since 1994, when she completed post-doctoral studies at the Swiss Federal Institute for Agroecology. She wrote her thesis on Lignification of Eucalyptus which is the study of how wood is formed on a cellular basis. After that she moved on to the University of Zurich in 1997 where she was a junior group leader investigating fungal disease resistance in plant genomes. In 2008, she and her team successfully published the first mapping of the largest wheat chromosome, 3B and in 2014, they successfully completed mapping 3B's sequencing and published a draft of the entire wheat genome. She has been awarded the Prix Foulon from the French Academy of Science, the gold Troph√©e de la Femme, was honored as a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour, and received the Jean Dufrenoy Prize from the Acad√©mie d'Agriculture of France. Today, Feuillet works as the head of Trait Research at Bayer CropScience, where she is actively trying to decrypt the remaining 20 wheat chromosomes so as to identify and manipulate traits that would help eliminate biotic and abiotic stressors that inhibit the yield of wheat in the changing environment. She is also the head of the project, Breedwheat, which works to manipulate the wheat genome to improve the yield of wheat in the changing environment due to global warming because it is a basic food source for upwards of 2 billion people worldwide. Education and early life Catherine Feuillet was born in Orl√©ans, approximately 130 km (80 miles) south of Paris, and attained her education as a geneticist and molecular biologist. In 1993, she earned her doctorate at the Paul Sabatier University in Toulouse, France. Between 1994 and 1997, she completed post-doctoral studies at the Federal Institute for Agroecology in Z√ºrich, studying the genomes of wheat and barley. In 1994 Feuillet finished her thesis on the eucalyptus plant and enzymes used in the wood formation process. She took her thesis to the Swiss Federal Institute for Agroecology in Z√ºrich, Switzerland. She taught two courses as a professor‚Äôs assistant and began her work on the wheat genome. At the Swiss Federal Institute for Agroecology she worked in a laboratory under the supervision of Dr. B. Keller to work on structural and evolutionary genomics in wheat and barley. She joined the Institute of Plant Biology at the University of Zurich as a junior group leader and continued her grain research investigating the genes responsible for fungal disease resistance. In 2011, she joined the Wheat Initiative, created by the G20 countries to improve global wheat production and that same year was awarded a Fellowship by the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Feuillet received the Jean Dufrenoy Prize from the Acad√©mie d'Agriculture of France in 2012 and in 2013, she joined Bayer CropScience as head of the Trait Research Department. In 2014, her team at IWGSC successfully completed sequencing wheat chromosome 3B and by utilizing a technique called shotgun sequencing they were able to publish a draft of the entire wheat genome sequence. The draft is only 53% accurate and complete mapping will take approximately two more years, provided funding for the project is attained. The University of Zurich in Switzerland Early research and awards In 2004, she joined the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (National Institute of Agricultural Research) (INRA) in Clermont- Ferrand, France, as the research director of the Genetics, Diversity and Ecophysiology of Cereals Department. In 2005, she joined the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium (IWGSC), an international effort in which she serves as a co-chair whose goal is to sequence the genome of wheat. She was also appointed as the chair of the European Triticeae Genomics Initiative (ETGI) in 2005. In 2008, Feuillet's team published in the journal, Science, the first mapping results of the wheat chromosome 3B, which is the largest of the 21 chromosomes of wheat. That same year, she joined the International Triticeae Mapping Initiative (ITMI) to assist with planning and coordination of research projects. On 24 November 2009 Feuillet received the Prix Foulon from the French Academy of Sciences for her work in deciphering the genome. That same year, she was also awarded the gold Troph√©e de la Femme for her research and then on 10 September 2010, received the insignia of Chevalier of the Legion of Honour from the INRA. Wheat genome sequencing Weizen√§hre Detailansicht In 2004 Feuillet began her work on the wheat genome, decrypting the chromosome 3B. Decrypting the chromosome took 4 years, but in 2008 she finally finished and presented the chromosome to the scientific community in the journal Science. This required making a map of one of the 42 chromosomes, placing over 1400 molecular markers throughout its 995 million base pairs. The work had never been done before because the sequence was large and had extreme amounts of repetitive sequences, which make it difficult to match the pieces together in the sequence. The wheat genome was also difficult to sequence because of its chromosome arrangement: the plant has three sets of chromosomes in one nucleus, called a hexaploid arrangement. The chromosome she chose to sequence, 3B, is the largest chromosome on the entire genome, and is by itself double the size of the entire rice genome. In early 2016, the IWGSC announced that they had assembled, using de novo shotgun techniques, a high quality reference sequence of the bread wheat genome. The project was made possible through a collaboration of IPK Gatersleben in Germany, the University of Saskatchewan‚Äôs Crop Development Centre in Canada, Kansas State University, and the Global Institute of Food Security in Canada. This ‚Äúshotgun‚Äù approach allows the sequencing to be done very quickly, but it can be rather inaccurate as compared to the ‚Äúmap-based‚Äù sequence Feuillet used when she sequenced the 3B chromosome. The shotgun approach is approximated to be 94% accurate, while the rest of the chromosome is about 53% accurate using the second approach. This data from the second approach, released in collaboration with the IWGSC, will be used along with the physical-map based approach to individual chromosomes, including Feuillet‚Äôs sequencing of 3B, to produce the full genome by 2017. Sequencing the wheat genome completely is important for producers all over the world. Wheat currently makes up more than 20% of all calories consumed in the world, and as the global population increases, so does the need for wheat. Recently, however, wheat production has been stagnating because technological advances can‚Äôt keep up with negative economic and natural factors. The total demand for wheat is expected to increase by 70 percent by the year 2050‚Äîan increase of about 1.6 percent per year (Gonzalez). By sequencing the genome, scientists will be able to research ways to improve the efficiency of the crop through means like genetic engineering, which could allow production of wheat in areas with low nutrient levels. Current research Feuillet is still continuing her work on sequencing wheat genomes today in order to contribute to the field of agronomy. Her work focuses on genes that would have medicinal advancements that would help prevent illnesses in plants. To continue her work on the wheat genome Feuillet now heads the project, Breedwheat, which receives 34 million euros annually and has a team of 128 researchers. The project is trying to manipulate wheat to adapt to the changing environment caused by global warming. Because wheat is a necessary and basic food for 30% of the global population, Feuillet found it especially important to ensure the survival of wheat as a food source as the human species influences the global conditions at an ever more rapid pace. Feuillet currently leads Trait Research at Bayer CropScience and is working on ‚Äúidentifying the genes responsible for yield and resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses.‚Äù Since upwards of 2 billion people worldwide rely on wheat a main food source, researchers at Bayer CropScience like Catherine Feuillet, Steve Patterson, and Edward Souza are working on increasing the yield of wheat without increasing the amount of land required for that yield. Feuillet‚Äôs work at decoding the wheat genome is essential in increasing the yield because once decoded, the genome could be modified so that yield inhibitors could be abolished. This information is then used by Souza, the Head of Wheat Breeding Research at Bayer CropScience, to develop markers to find the genes that produce the desired trait.

Williams in Papua Francis Edgar Williams (9 February 1893 ‚Äî 12 May 1943) was an Australian anthropologist who worked for the government of the Territory of Papua from 1922 to 1942. Life Born in Malvern, South Australia and educated at Kyre College, the Baptist South Australia school, Williams graduated from the University of Adelaide in 1914 with high honours, and was accordingly awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to study at the University of Oxford. He nevertheless decided to join the Australian Imperial Force in 1915 and served in France as a lieutenant in the 32nd Battalion. Promoted to the honorary rank of captain in early 1918, he served in a secret mission in Caucasus under General Lionel Dunsterville. In 1919, he took up his Rhodes Scholarship at Balliol, and graduated in anthropology in 1921. Back in Australia at the end of the year, he met in February 1922 the Lieutenant- Governor of Papua, Hubert Murray, who was looking for a young and strong Oxford graduate to serve as an assistant government anthropologist next to Dr William Mersh Strong, more a practitioner than a scientist. Appointed on 8 March 1922, Williams was promoted to Government Anthropologist when Strong retired in 1928, and kept the position until the demise of the Papuan administration in 1942. One of the few anthropologists of his time able to spend two continuous decades in the same location without having to regularly return to a metropolitan university or institution, he performed during those twenty years heavy field work, and published many books and articles, both monographic and general. In 1935, his manifesto The Blending of Culture hit a worldwide audience. Often agreeing with Murray, William was given complete liberty by the omnipotent administrator. When World War II expanded to the Southern Pacific in December 1941, Williams came back to Australia and enlisted as a lieutenant to serve with military intelligence. He was promoted captain in November 1942. Among his many works, he wrote You and Native, a booklet advising the Allied soldiers on how to behave with Papuans. In early 1943, Williams was sent back to Papua to serve as a liaison officer with the Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit.

It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Oonooraba, circa 1905 Oonooraba was built in about 1892 to the design of prominent architect, George Henry Male Addison, for a prominent Maryborough citizen, James Malcolm Stafford. The house was supposedly built on the site of an early Aboriginal meeting place. The original township of Maryborough was situated, not in its current place, but on the north of the Mary River, after wharves were established in 1847‚Äì48 providing transport for wool from sheep stations on the Burnett River. In 1850 Surveyor, Hugh Roland Labatt arrived in Maryborough with instructions to \\"examine the River Mary...to suggest ...the best site or sites for the laying out of the town, having regard to the convenience of shipping on one hand and internal communication on the other...also...point out the spots desirable as reserves for public building, church, quay and for places for public recreation.\\" The site recommended by Labatt was not where settlement was established but further east and from the early 1850s this is where the growing town developed. The land on which Oonooraba was built was part of a ten-acre lot, described as Suburban Section 29, which was first purchased by a William MacAdam of Maryborough on 20 September 1859. The land was apparently left undeveloped, and in 1886 the ten- acre lot was acquired by George Ambrose White, who subdivided the land and offered for sale the smaller lots of land. After the subdivisions James Malcolm Stafford a Maryborough solicitor, bought six acres of Suburban Section 29 in three purchases. The first, subdivision one of , was purchased on 2 November 1889 from Otto Dias who had purchased the lot from White the year before. Next, Stafford purchased one acre described as resubdivsion 1 of subdivision 2 on 12 November 1889. On 21 September 1892 Stafford's wife, Jessie Wilson Stafford, purchased three more acres of Section 29. Presumably at about this date, after obtaining a six-acre lot, the Stafford's had their house Oonooraba built. There is evidence that the house was constructed by 1895. James Malcolm Stafford was practising as a solicitor in Maryborough from about 1883, after having practicing in Brisbane. He was born on 25 June 1859 in Ipswich and was educated and articled in that town. He was admitted as a solicitor in Brisbane on 7 March 1882 and practiced there before moving to Maryborough by about 1885 where he established a successful practice. He was elected to the position of Mayor of Maryborough in 1892 and retained this role until about 1896. Stafford died on 4 April 1900. In about 1892, Stafford commissioned George Henry Male Addison to design his one-storeyed timber residence in Maryborough. Addison was an important Queensland architect, who trained in England before emigrating to Melbourne in 1883 and joined the prominent Victorian architectural firm, Terry and Oakden. He became a partner and the chief draftsman and was a founding member of the Melbourne Art Society. He arrived in Brisbane in November 1886 to supervise construction of the London Chartered Bank which Terry, Oakden and Addison, as they were now known, had designed. He remained in Brisbane undertaking work as the northern partner of the firm, which again changed name and became Oakden, Addison and Kemp in 1887. In April 1892 he assumed responsibility for the Brisbane office of Anglican Diocesan architect, JH Buckeridge who had moved to Sydney. Addison left the partnership and practiced on his own until 1898 and formed several other partnerships in the early twentieth century. Addison designed many landmark buildings in Queensland, including the Exhibition Building of 1892 (now known as the Old Museum); The Mansions in George Street and the Albert Street Uniting Church. He also designed many of Brisbane's premier houses including Cumbooquepa at South Brisbane; Halwyn at Red Hill; Kirkston at Windsor; Fernbrook at Indooroopilly and Ralahyne at Clayfield. George Layou's book about the history of Maryborough provides a long description of Oonooraba: > The place is named Oonooraba, so called because the ground was once the > fighting place of the blacks. Four and a half years ago the house was built > of fine pine and beech and the quality of the timber was of the best.

James Stafford died on 4 April 1900 and the land was acquired by the Queensland Trustees. This did not comprise the entire block as his wife officially owned half of the land which she retained until her death in the 1930s. After her death the ownership of the property changed several times and, despite further subdivisions, has been retained as a private residence although with a much-reduced garden.  Description  Oonooraba is sited on Pallas Street, facing, not south east toward that street but to the north east toward Ann Street, from where access was originally provided to the property. The site comprises the building, a substantial elevated one-storeyed timber house, which is surrounded by a large garden with established trees including two Araucaria Cookii and several palm trees. The building is timber framed and is supported on squared timber columns which elevate the home about from ground level. Access is provided to the principal floor of the house via a wide straight concrete stair emerging from the principal, north eastern facade. The stair is flanked by concrete balustrade which terminates at the base with newels on which sit lion statues. Filling the cavity between the timber posts supporting the house is diagonal timber lattice panels. The house is clad with wide horizontal timber boards which are quite unusual with heavily beaded mouldings at the tongue and groove joints. The house is essentially rectangular in plan with a kitchen wing adjoining the rear elevation on the south west side of the building. Wide verandahs line three sides of the building and on the principal facade where the two corners of the face of the building are punctuated with bay windows, this is reflected in the projecting line of the verandah. The hipped roof of Oonooraba also reflects these bays with the addition of small hipped partial pyramidal roof forms over the bays. The bull nosed verandah awning of Oonooraba is supported on turned columns with curved brackets, paired toward the principal entrance of the house. Above the columns are frieze panels, comprising diagonal latticework flanking a central section of vertical battening. The verandah balustrades which are replacements of a cast iron balustrade are of vertical timber battening with decorative cutouts in regularly spaced battens. Many early lattice screens and timber louvres survive in the verandah openings. The principal entrance of Oonooraba is from the south east, where the steps provide access to the verandah, from which a large central doorway provides access to the house. The doorway comprises a substantial five panelled and moulded timber door, flanked by sidelights with leadlight glazing above moulded base panels. These are surrounded by a substantial architrave and the door is surmounted by a narrow operable fanlight. The doorway is surmounted by a centrally placed timber entablature which terminates in a broken pediment. Other openings to the house, flanking the entrance and from all internal rooms with access to the verandah, are full length vertical sash walk-through openings surrounded by moulded architraves. The entrance door gives access to a small entrance vestibule, which in turn provides access to a central hall from which the principal rooms of the house are accessed. The entrance vestibule has timber dado panelling, which comprises a skirting, an alternating timber boarded body and a wide dado rail. This pattern of dado panelling continues to other rooms of the house, with changes in other rooms of the amount of moulding and height of the skirting and dado rail and also the alternating timber boards, which here are two different types of timber, and with the lighter coloured timber reeded. Above the dado panelling in the entrance vestibule is early floral wall paper, divided into panels with vertical and horizontal border strips. Dividing this room from the central hall is a timber screen of half glazed double timber swing doors, flanked by similarly detailed half glazed sidelights and surmounted by transom lights. The glazing in the doorway is leadlight with a simple geometric pattern rendered in coloured and arctic glass. The central hall is lined with unpainted vertical timber boards, above a dado panel similar to that found in the vestibule. Above a cornice around the timber boarding is a curved timber ceiling centrally placed in which is a lay light, or horizontal glazed panelling below a roof lantern, from which pendant lighting is hung. The rectangular lay light comprises three leadlight panels glazed with strongly coloured small sections of glass within regular borders surrounding three ceiling roses. Within the hall four doorways, with four panelled doors and operable transoms above lead to rooms on either side, and a round arched doorway in the far, south western wall, leads to the rear rooms of the house. Some early door furniture surviving in this section is of black enamel with handpainted scenes of foliage and birds in gold lacquer. To the north west of the entrance hall are two large, public rooms, connected to one another by a squared arched opening in their shared partition. Both rooms are lined with a similar dado panelling to that mentioned previously, although in the room closer to the front of the building, the lighter timber in the body of the panelling is fluted, rather than reeded, and in the rear room, the lighter timber is smooth-faced. Both rooms are lined with early printed wallpaper, of a hazy pattern of blotches of white and umber on a light warm grey base. The wallpaper is matched with a cut out floral frieze around the walls above the dado rail, and a larger frieze, below the cornice, comprising a wider cutout floral strip with regularly spaced large stylised scenes. The ceilings in these rooms are timber boarded with coffering and featuring several large ceiling roses, some with early colour schemes. Early door furniture survives in these rooms and is similar to that in the central hall but of white enamel rather than of black. A dark stained timber fireplace is in a truncated corner of the rear of the two rooms, and this is lines with ceramic tiles. From this rear room access is provided via a four panelled sliding timber doorway into a large rear hall also able to be accessed from the arched doorway in the central hall. Another dark stained timber fireplace sits in a corresponding truncated corner. This room is lined to about 2500 high with vertical timber boarding, comprising dado panelling of only one type of timber but similar in other respects to that found elsewhere. From this room access is provided to a rear verandah from where the kitchen, and adjacent semi-open room on the verandah and storage rooms are found. On the other side of the central hall are the more private rooms of the house, and these are generally timber lined with vertical timber boarding, occasionally with string coursing at picture rail height and simple cornice and skirting. These rooms have interconnecting doors near the external walls. In a section of infilled verandah is an early (s) bathroom.  Heritage listing  Oonooraba was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Oonooraba demonstrates the growth of Maryborough during the late nineteenth century when a number of large residences were constructed, reflecting the growing infrastructure. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The building is a rare surviving and substantially intact residence designed by prominent Brisbane, GHM Addison, with whom it has special associations. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. The house was supposedly built on a site where Aboriginal clans met, therefore the site has the potential to yield important information about early indigenous lifestyles in and around Maryborough. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The building is characteristic of a large timber residence of the late nineteenth century, and is characteristic of the fine design skill of architect GHM Addison. The building has considerable architectural merit as a well composed and innovative residence. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Many of the features of the building are of considerable aesthetic value including the joinery, particularly the entrance door, unpainted internally dado panelling which varies throughout; early wallpaper complete with friezes and borders; other internal joinery and glazing; door furniture and fireplaces. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The building is associated with prominent local citizen, James Stafford and with the fine architect, George Henry Male Addison.

The series was created, written, directed and produced by Wes Hurley. The show is named after Seattle's historic Capitol Hill neighborhood. Both inspired by and parodying TV shows of the 1970s and 1980s such as Murder, She Wrote, Dallas, and Charlie's Angels, the series focuses on young and innocent Roses Smell (Waxie Moon) who escapes from Portland, and finds romance and stardom as a TV personality in Seattle. Capitol Hill is both a dark comedy and a queer deconstruction of narrative cliches and traditional gender norms. Other influences cited by Hurley include anime, Giallo and Twin Peaks. Cast=Main * Waxie Moon as Roses Smell * Robbie Turner as Dottie Pearl * BenDeLaCreme as herself * Jinkx Monsoon as Celeste Dahl * Alexandra Tavares as Tanya * Jonathan Crimeni as Mayor * Colby Keller as himself * Mark Siano as George Recurring * Guinevere Turner as therapist * Annette Toutonghi as Mother Terisha * Charles Leggett as Holy Godfather * Jason Carter as Father Dick * Aleksa Manila as Helena Pen Poison * Miss Indigo Blue as Poops Smell * Zoe Scofield as Demon * Sarah Rudinoff as Anna Zhopova * Jennifer Jasper as Sister Malvina * Jackie Hell as Dinky Pie Season One In the first season, Roses runs away from Portland, which in the show is portrayed as a Deep South community populated by inbred cannibals and illiterate rednecks. Upon her arrival in Seattle, Roses instantly makes a new best friend - Tanya (Alexandra Tavares) - who takes her in and finds her a job on a local TV news station. When the resident queen bee Dottie Pearl (played by Robbie Turner) falls ill, Roses has an opportunity to host Pearl's news segment. The TV station's sleazy owner, George Hall (Mark Siano), is so impressed with Roses' performance that he gives her a new talk show called \\"Women in the Workplace\\". While hosting one of the episodes of \\"Women in the Workplace\\", Roses befriends the world's most popular and controversial nun, Mother Terisha. Mother Terisha recruits Roses to go undercover to a gay bar to spy on gay activists who are ruining her reputation. But instead of aiding Mother Terisha, Roses, disguised as a gay man, falls in love with a handsome bartender, Michelle. After meeting Helena Pen Poison, the world's most famous forensic scientist and mystery writer, Roses agrees to help the investigation against Mother Terisha, with grave consequences. Meanwhile, Dottie Pearl gets possessed by a demonic being who uses Dottie to get closer to Roses. Each episode is introduced by BenDeLaCreme. This season was presented as a series of 10 episodes. Subsequently the series played at many film festivals including Geneva International Film Festival Tous Ecrans, Raindance, Seattle Lesbian & Gay Film Festival, Mix Brasil Festival and Oslo/Fusion. The first season was nominated for Best Comedy Series, Best Makeup, Best Production Design, Best Cinematography and earned Harmony Arnold the Best Costumes award at the Indie Series Awards. The first season was also nominated for Best Series at Geneva International Film Festival Tous Ecrans and Best Production Design at the Miami Webfest. Season Two Season 2 trailer starring Kenneth \\"Kenny\\" Brain of Big Brother, Waxie Moon and Baby Bear premiered in August 2015 on Out and WorldofWonder.com. Season 2 premiered in October 2015 with Jinkx Monsoon, Colby Keller, Jason Carter, Jackie Hell, Sarah Rudinoff and Guinevere Turner joining the cast.

They rely heavily on the postulates of Koch (formulated in 1884) and on the work of Louis Pasteur (1822-1895). Changing perceptions have altered treatment models. The hypotheses have sought to establish both in caries and in periodontitis a relation between pathogen virulence, environmental considerations, plaque biofilm structure and the host response. Specific plaque hypothesis The specific plaque hypothesis was the favoured opinion at the birth of microbiology in the late nineteenth century. It posited that there were some specific pathogenic bacteria among the biome which were solely responsible for disease, and in the absence of which the oral environment would be healthy. In his ‚ÄúNonspecific plaque hypothesis‚Äù, the hypothesis states that the severity of the disease depends upon the amount of plaque accumulation. Even though it is an old concept, most of the current periodontal treatment strategies still depend on it.https://actascientific.com/ASDS/pdf/ASDS-03-0688.pdf It was later realised that disease occurred even in the absence of these bacteria, albeit to a lesser degree, which observation gave rise to the non-specific hypothesis. Further research on the specific organisms involved and their pathogenicity gave rise to a resurgence of the idea in the 1990s, but it has since been modified. Caries The specific plaque hypothesis was originally the theory that specific pathogens alone were capable of causing caries. However, the theory is proscribed by the fact that caries occurs even in the absence of these bacteria, albeit to a lesser degree. Despite this, the hypothesis was useful in diagnosis and treatment, associating caries with such truly cariogenic bacteria as Streptococcus mutans and the lactobacilli species. Periodontitis The specific plaque hypothesis was introduced by Loesche, following on from observations that rodents did not develop caries even with a highly cariogenic diet unless specific bacteria such as streptococci were introduced. It is understood that specific microorganisms play an importance in both caries and periodontal diseases. Non-specific plaque hypothesis=Caries The non-specific plaque hypothesis is the theory developed in the 1930s that caries is the result of the combined efforts of all the organisms in the oral biome, and that some patients are merely more susceptible than others. No specific organisms had been identified at that point that were more cariogenic than others. Thus the amount of plaque in situ was taken to determine the severity of the effect, regardless of its composition. While this is to a degree true of periodontitis, it could not be proven of caries. Early thoughts of oral caries disease could not be identified to a type of bacteria responsible due to limited technological development in the nineteenth century, which led to the Non-Specific Plaque Hypotheses. Evolving in the 1980s, not only were a few specific types of bacteria identified as playing a part in disease, differences in virulences of bacteria were then considered as part of the theory that the overall entirety of the microflora could lead to caries disease.Bob T. Rosier, Marko De Jager, Egija Zaura, and Bastiaan P. Krom.\\"Historical and contemporary hypotheses on the development of oral diseases: are we there yet?\\" Frontiers in Cellular Infection Microbiology. 16 Jul 2014. Retrieved on 2016-05-01. The non-specific plaque hypothesis was developed in the nineteenth century, and postulates that the accumulation of activity of all types of dental plaque is responsible for oral disease, regardless of the virulence of the specific pathogens involved. Technological developments in the twentieth century enabled scientists to analyse the chemical changes in the plaque biome from healthy to diseased environments, which then brought several problems to light. The recently posited keystone-pathogen hypothesis holds that certain malignant pathogens can control the inflammatory disease by proliferating, remodelling and disproportionate a normally benign microbiome. Periodontitis The non specific plaque hypothesis was introduced in the 1930s. Studies conducted were unable to identify a specific organism responsible for the formation of periodontal disease, and therefore was unable to support the specific plaque hypothesis. This new theory stated that all bacteria flora in plaque had a role in periodontal destruction. During this time, it was believed that periodontal therapy involved complete plaque control and not just targeting specific bacteria. If plaque control was achieved, then it would limit the production of gingival irritants thereby decreasing inflammation and periodontal destruction. Ecological plaque hypothesis The ecological or keystone plaque hypothesis is that a shift in the ecology of the biome results in an imbalance and exorbitantly high numbers of certain keystone pathogens. Caries Ecological plaque hypothesis and the aetiology of dental caries The ecological plaque hypothesis, a combination of the two previously mentioned hypotheses, suggests that there are certain species responsible for pathology, but are present in insufficient quantities to cause damage to a healthy individual. Thus biofilm derived diseases are the result of an imbalance in the normal oral ecology. The most commonly recognised bacteria that are responsible for initiating the biofilm formation that can eventually lead to caries are streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus. The key factors for virulence include their ability to metabolise glucose and similar sugars, their tolerance for a low pH environment and their acidogenicity. The presence of streptococci encourage adherence of more cariogenic bacteria, which in turn increases the likelihood for caries. Although factors such as the quality of saliva, using fluoridated toothpaste and chewing gum after meals can inhibit the growth of these bacteria and change the biofilm environment. Saliva containing more buffering agents such as calcium and phosphate ions alter the internal environment of dental plaque to become less acidic, favouring the growth of less cariogenic organisms. The fluoride components of fluoridated toothpaste can be bacteriostatic to cariogenic bacteria, decreasing their acidogenicity and proliferation. Chewing gum can disturb the mature and fairly stable acid producing plaque to alter the bacterial composition of the biofilm. In turn the disease causing organisms may still be present, but are so in reduced numbers. Chewing gum containing sufficient levels of xylitol also has the ability to reduce the number of streptococcus mutans present in the saliva as well as the mechanisms for the bacteria to adhere to tooth tissue, which reduces the chance for reinfection. Periodontitis Inc. red complex; avoid immune detection; devour host for nutrition. Interfere with host immune response Trigger environ changes to make it more benign for them The ecological plaque hypothesis and the aetiology of periodontal diseasesThe ecological concept consolidates both specific and non specific plaque hypothesis theories. The ecological plaque hypothesis founded in the early 1990s by (Marsh 1994) confirmed some associations between clinical and laboratory measurements. This theory focused its sites that the environment in which balance the microflora may in fact be altered by many changes in the resident plaque and specific species which can predispose the site to periodontal disease.Marsh, PD. Microbial Ecoloogy of Dental Plaque and its Significance in Health and Disease. Advances in Dental Research. 1994, (8) 2 p263-271. Retrieved 2016-05-20. Keystone-Pathogen Hypothesis The term keystone is also used in biology to characterise a species which has a disproportionate effect on the ecosystem when compared to its size. The keystone concept is in contrast with the dominant species concept, whereby the influence on the system is the absolute size of the species. If this concept is transposed to the microbiology world, it is thought that certain low abundance pathogenic bacteria can play a disproportionate role in modulating the host response by remodeling a typically favorable microbiota into a harmful one.

Some taxonomic authorities continue to place this subspecies in the genus Dendrocopos or Picoides. It is a subspecies of the grey-capped pygmy woodpecker, with key differences in the color of its feathers and body. Adult individuals typically reach in length. The sides of the head and eyebrows have broad patches of intense white, and the wing coverts contain large clear white patterns that form conspicuous patches. The underparts of the wing are pale with five white stripes. The cock has a grey crown and two small red stripes featuring prominently above the eyebrows. The first specimens of this subspecies were found on the island of Askold, located in eastern Siberia. They were collected and later classified under the name Iyngipicus doerriesi. John Gould obtained two specimens that he used to draw a lithograph for his collection. They were a cock from Henry Seebohm and a hen from Edward Hargitt, who was the first to write a description of the species in 1881. The woodpecker is named after Fritz Doerries, a German lepidopterist, collector, and explorer of Siberia, where the bird was first discovered. The subspecies' geographic distribution spans from eastern Siberia (Ussuriland), southeastern Manchuria (Heilongjiang and Jilin), and the Korean peninsula. Individuals of this species live in open woods and cultivated lands (usually inland), and are believed to be extant throughout their range.

It was designed by Victor Emmanuel Carandini and built in 1889 by Mr Murray. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The Post Office Hotel was built in 1889, for Messrs Hanley and Williams of Maryborough to a design of Victor Emmanuel Carandini, a Brisbane architect. The building replaced a previous single storeyed building on the site, also called the Post Office Hotel. The land on which the Post Office hotel was constructed was originally acquired by ET Aldridge by a Deed of Grant in May 1852. The original one storeyed masonry Post Office Hotel was constructed in about 1870 one year after the construction of the adjacent Maryborough Post Office, after which it was named. Aldridge retained the site until 1878 when it was sold to Mr John O'Brien, and Messrs Hanley and Williams acquired the property by 1889. By this time, the Licensing Authority operating within the Maryborough district, under the provisions of the Licensing Act of 1885, were becoming more strict with the licensees of hotels about the condition of the buildings and provision of services. In May 1889 the licensee of the former Post Office Hotel, GW Gaynor was refused a further annual licence for the single storeyed building which then existed, and it was then decided by the owners, Messrs Hanley and Williams, that a new building was needed. On August 7, 1889 the tender of Mr Murray, a local builder, was accepted to construct a new two storeyed building to the designs of Victor Emmanuel Carandini, an architect from Brisbane. A substantial brick building was constructed in 1889 and this is the date indicated on the entrance corner parapet. The early post supported verandah which lined the two principal facades of the building, was replaced with a cantilevered version, in line with a general movement in Maryborough to modernise the central business area in the 1930s by replacing all post supported awnings with cantilevered alternatives. The early verandah extended on the ground floor to the street line and was supported on cast iron columns, and featured cast iron brackets and frieze. The upper floor, which has also suffered modernisation, retains the bull nosed awning, but originally had slender turned timber balusters and timber venetian blinds on the outside edge.  Description  The Post Office Hotel is a two storeyed brick building, with cantilevered first floor verandah, located prominently on the corner of Wharf and Bazaar Streets, Maryborough. Principal facades address both streets, with entrance to the accommodation and dining rooms from Wharf Street and the access to the incorporated ground floor shops from Bazaar Street. The external walls to the street, of bagged and painted brick, are surmounted by a partially rendered brick parapet, concealing a hipped corrugated iron roof. The truncated corner of the hotel is emphasised by a signage panel, projecting beyond the parapet, with \\"POST OFFICE HOTEL - 1889\\", surmounted by an open-topped pediment. The parapet features rosettes above moulded string courses supported on paired plaster corbels. Several rendered finials are placed along the parapet, with a slightly larger feature one on each elevation emphasising the principal entrance from that side. The building rests on a rendered masonry base, though which ventilation holes are punched. The cantilevered verandah, extending the entire length of the principal facades, has a bull-nosed awning supported on reeded cast iron columns, and featuring cast iron frieze and brackets. The timber slatted balustrade is a replacement. The rear of the building has a two storeyed post supported verandah, onto which internal rooms are accessed. Openings to the ground floor have moulded plaster surrounds, and retain some early joinery and leadlight glazing, although there are some replacement louvres. First floor openings are generally inward opening, half glazed, french doors with operable fanlights above. Internally, the ground floor comprises the public bar, shops, and entrance and stair halls off which the dining room is accessed. The dining room is clad with timber sheeting, and the beaded board ceiling features cast iron ceiling roses. A carved timber chimney piece, complete with cast iron fittings remains intact, though painted. The public bar has been substantially altered although an early glazed door remains. The cedar, three-quarter-turn open well stair features fine turned balusters, carved newel and turning posts, and a swan-necked handrail. The first floor comprises many timber framed accommodation rooms clad with tongue and groove boarding and accessed from a central corridor featuring plaster arches and skylights at various intervals. This floor remains substantially intact, in planform and fabric, with early joinery, glazing, timber floors and internal fittings.

Jharkhand was a ‚Äúlaboratory‚Äù for Naxalites to experiment with their ideas of establishing a parallel government. As of 2005, 16 of the 22 districts in the state, including Hazaribagh district, was transformed into a ‚Äúguerrilla zone‚Äù. The movement was not restricted to armed operations but included kangaroo courts called Jan adalats, elected village bodies and people's police. Jharkhand, with a dense forest cover over a large part of the state, offers a favourable terrain for the Naxalites to build their bases and operate. Annual fatalities in Jharkhand were 117 in 2003 and 150 in 2004. In 2013 Jharkhand was considered one of the two states in the country most affected by Left wing extremism and Jharkhand police set up an exclusive cell to deal with Maoist activities. However, in the same year, when Jharkhand police identified 13 focus areas for combating Maoist extremism, Hazaribagh district was not one of them.

It was presented to the House of Representatives by Treasurer Scott Morrison on 3 May 2016. It was the third budget to be handed down by the Liberal/National Coalition since their election to government at the 2013 federal election, and the first to be handed down by Morrison and the Turnbull Government. Breaking from convention, the budget was submitted a week earlier than the traditional annual date of the second Tuesday in May, amidst a run-up to the 2016 federal election. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull had recalled parliament early, in anticipation of a double dissolution triggering an election for 2 July 2016. Background In September 2015, Member for Wentworth and former Minister for Communications under the Abbott Government, Malcolm Turnbull, challenged the incumbent Tony Abbott for the Prime Ministership and won office by a vote of the Liberal Party caucus. He challenged Abbott on a rationale of \\"economic leadership\\", criticizing his economic policies and claiming that he had \\"not been capable of providing the economic leadership our nation needs [...] of providing the economic confidence that business needs.\\" After ascending to the Prime Ministership, Turnbull appointed the former Minister for Social Services Scott Morrison as Treasurer, replacing Joe Hockey who resigned from politics shortly afterwards. Forecasts For the 2016‚Äì17 financial year, the government forecast a deficit of $37.1 billion, which is $2.7 billion less than the estimated $39.8 billion deficit during the 2015‚Äì16 financial year. Taxes and income=Income and business taxes The individual tax rates remained the same except that the $80,000 upper threshold for the 32.5% rate was increased to $87,000 effective 1 July 2016. The 2% deficit repair levy on individual incomes above $180,000 instituted by former Prime Minister Tony Abbott is set to be abolished from 1 July 2017. The small to medium business tax rate will also be lowered once again, by 1% to 27.5%, effective 1 July 2016. The turnover threshold in which small businesses would be eligible for this lower tax rate will be raised significantly, from $2 million to $10 million, with the expectation that it will once again be raised to $25 million in 2017‚Äì18, $50 million in 2018‚Äì19, and eventually $100 million in 2019‚Äì20. It is expected this tax cut will affect over 870,000 businesses, employing 3.4 million workers. Over 6,000 Sole traders, employing 1.5 million workers, will also receive a lower tax cut of 2.5% to 26.0%, subject to the same turnover threshold eligibility as small businesses and along with the same increase in turnover threshold over time. The unincorporated small business tax discount will also be increased by 3%, up to a fixed rate of 8%, with the turnover threshold being increased to $5 million. After 2016‚Äì17, it is expected that the discount for unincorporated small businesses will increase to 16% by stages, before the 2026-27 financial year. In the forecast for the budget, Big businesses will receive a 5% cut to the corporate income tax rate, down to the OECD average of 25%, within a decade; the first reduction in the corporate tax rate in 15 years. While the rate will stay fixed at 30% in the meantime, the Turnbull Government plans to reduce it to a rate equal to the small and medium business tax rate of 27.5% in 2023-24, before being reduced to 27% in 2024-25, 26% in 2025-26, and eventually a fixed rate of 25% in 2026-27. Superannuation The budget made changes to the superannuation arrangements and thresholds. Programs and expenditure=Aged care The government changed the scoring of the Aged Care Funding Instrument, which allocates the government subsidy per person in aged care, by assessing their care needs. There was some additional funding for regional aged care facilities, but the net effect of the budget is \\"a reduction of $902.7 million over five years\\". Social security In the 2016 budget, the Turnbull Government planned to cease the clean energy supplement of $4.40 for people beginning Newstart after 20 September. Infrastructure Public transport projects, such as the Parramatta Light Rail, were given more focus over road projects ‚Äì a notable contrast from Abbott Government budgets. Over $33 billion will be spent to deliver \\"critical and innovative\\" infrastructure, including road and rail upgrades. Out of this infrastructure fund, $115 million will be pledged towards the construction of the Western Sydney Airport at Badgerys Creek over two years, with $89 million dedicated towards planning, development, land acquisitions and construction security, and $26.2 million dedicated towards design research for a proposed extension of the South West Rail Link towards Badgerys Creek. It will be the only ongoing infrastructure project in Sydney to see an increase in funding from the previous federal budget. In total, $2.9 billion will be spent on infrastructure in New South Wales, including $1.7 billion towards construction of the Sydney Metro's extension into the city and southwest, and $78.3 million towards design and development of the Parramatta Light Rail. In Melbourne, $3 billion is still available for the Government of Victoria to spend on the proposed East West Link, which had been previously accepted by former Liberal Premier Denis Napthine, but rejected by Labor Premier Daniel Andrews after his election in 2014, who vowed instead to fund and construct the Melbourne Metro Rail Project, without federal support. Despite this, it was recommended to the Victorian Government that federal support of $857.2 million be spent on the Melbourne Metro, in addition to $20.2 million for the Murray Basin Rail project, taken from the Federal Government's Asset Recycling Initiative. The $4 billion sale of the Australian Rail Track Corporation, proposed by the preceding Abbott Government, was completely dropped by the Turnbull Government, in favor of developing and constructing the long-proposed inland rail line linking Melbourne and Brisbane. $594 million will be spent towards research and land acquisition, though there is no funding as of yet for construction of the line, which is projected to cost around $10.7 billion. The Federal Government will also allocate over $2 billion to the establishment of the National Water Infrastructure Loans Facility, which will allow concessional loans to state and territory governments, helping to fund the construction of dams, pipelines, and groundwater recharge projects from July 2016. The new bank will replace the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund, which was established in 2015, and allocated only $500 million. The National Water Infrastructure Loans Facility will exist for 10 years, and State and Territory governments will have a deadline of 25 years to repay money taken from the fund. Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources Barnaby Joyce stated that funding proposals for over 60 water infrastructure projects had been received by the federal government at the time of the budget's release. Employment $751.7 million will be dedicated to funding a new workfare program targeted at unemployed youth under 25, known as the \\"Youth Jobs PaTH\\" (Prepare-trial-hire). It is an alternative for the \\"work for the dole\\" scheme introduced by the Abbott Government in the previous budget. Slated to commence on 1 April 2017 and aiming to engage over 30,000 young jobseekers, the program will feature three stages; the first stage being an intensive pre-employment skills training course, five months after job seekers register with the Department of Employment's \\"jobactive\\" service. The second stage with see job seekers introduced into the workplace through at least 120,000 four to twelve-week internships provided in cooperation with jobactive and participating businesses, where businesses will receive an upfront payment of $1000 for each intern they take on, and interns will be paid an additional $200 a fortnight, on top of their income support payments. In the third and final stage, businesses who hire participants as employees will be given a wage subsidy of $10,000 for hiring \\"less than job ready\\" seekers and $6,500 for more job ready seekers, billed as the \\"Youth Bonus wage subsidy\\". To fund the program, $500 million will be axed from the work for the dole scheme, in addition to the $240 million Job Commitment Bonus. Furthermore, as of October 2016, \\"the most prepared job seekers\\" will now require at least 12 months of registration with jobactive for work for the dole, instead of the six months required before the change, forecast to save $494.2 million over four years.

History  The Gataker's Warehouse Complex consists of four buildings erected on three allotments bounded by Kent and Wharf streets in proximity to the river and other buildings associated with the Port of Maryborough. Settlement at Maryborough commenced in September 1847 when George Furber established a woolstore on the south bank of the Mary River at the head of navigation. He was followed in June 1848 by ET Aldridge and Henry and RE Palmer, who established their own wharves on the opposite riverbank, at a location now known as the original Maryborough town site at Baddow. In 1850 a new town site was surveyed to the east, at a downstream position which provided better access for shipping. The first sale of land at this new site occurred in 1852, but most residents did not shift to the current centre of Maryborough until 1855 and 1856. Maryborough was gazetted a Port of Entry in 1859 and was proclaimed a municipality in 1861. During the 1860s and 1870s it flourished as the principal port for the nearby Gympie goldfield and as an outlet for timber and sugar. The establishment of manufacturing plants and primary industries sustained growth in the town into the twentieth century. Gataker's Warehouse Complex comprises: * the Kent Street Building (1867-1868) * the Middle Warehouse (c.1869) * the Wharf Street Warehouse (erected in stages from ) * Brown's Warehouse (1879) along Wharf Street Since 1885, the Gataker family have owned the site on which three of the buildings are sited. Brown's Warehouse was acquired by the family company in 1972. In 1988, the three allotments were group titled.  Kent Street Building, Middle Warehouse, Wharf Street Warehouse  The Kent Street Building and Middle Warehouse (located immediately behind the Kent Street Building) are substantial two- storey brick buildings. The Wharf Street Warehouse, a single-storey brick building, is located behind the Middle Warehouse and fronts Wharf Street. The Kent Street Building was built as a store for the owner of the land, Robert Travis, of the wholesale and retail firm, Robert Travis and Co. On completion of the store, the Maryborough Chronicle (20 June 1868) published the following description: > \\"The facade carries two cornices, an upper and a lower one - the former > supported by ornamental trusses, the latter corbelled out, the members of > both exceedingly bold and massive in detail, giving an appearance of great > solidity to the whole building. An exceedingly light close-boarded, and > slated king-post roof - a peculiar feature in which is the entire absence of > all common rafters - covers the building. In the rear of the main store, and > attached thereto, is a brick wine and spirit store, and beyond that a > packing-house, built of the same material. A splendid water supply is > secured by a large circular brick tank having a depth of 22 feet (6.7 m) > with a diameter of 11 feet (3.4 m). ... The store on the ground floor is a > splendid room 15 feet (4.6 m) high, extending over the whole of the > building, with the exception that an office occupies a space of 15 by 15 > feet (4.6 by 4.6 m) of the lower end. Two rows of handsome iron columns add > to the ornament of this large room, and at the same time give solidity to > the floor of the upper storey. Access to this upper storey is made by a > staircase at the lower end of the building, on mounting which it will be > seen the whole floor forms one large room, except that in the centre an > opening has been left for facilitating communication between the two rooms, > the opening being surrounded with a light elegant balustrade. The internal > fittings are all of French-polished cedar, most of it grown in the > district...\\" The Middle Warehouse was also built for Travis. The Maryborough Chronicle (2 March 1869) gave the following description of the building: > \\"(It) is a massive two-storeyed pile, of the utmost solidity and security > that bricks and mortar, laid in the very best manner, can ensure, with a > slate roof of correspondingly durable appearance. The dimensions are 100 > feet (30.5 m) long by 30 feet (9 m) wide, the lower story being devoted to > the reception of bonded goods, and the upper one, which contains two > apartments, to the purpose of an ordinary warehouse.\\" In 1879, drapers Rutledge and Netterfield (later Netterfield and Palmer) acquired the site and it was subsequently occupied by a number of commercial or light industrial operations before being sold at auction to CF Gataker of Graham and Gataker on 20 February 1885. Graham and Gataker subsequently acquired land behind the Middle Warehouse fronting Wharf Street. In 1906 Graham retired and, soon after, Gataker's two sons, Melmoth Leofric and Charles James entered the business to form Gataker and Sons. Graham Gataker retired in 1913. At the height of the depression, in 1933, the firm was forced to assign its estate, but the following year Gatakers Pty Ltd was formed, and the company purchased the assets of the old firm recommencing operations. After World War II, Gatakers expanded their business to become liquor merchants including the Wide Bay distribution of Four-ex beer and the bottling of Bundaberg Rum. In c.1947 the first stage of the single- storey Wharf Street Warehouse was constructed by local builder Jack Ferguson fronting Wharf Street immediately behind the Middle Warehouse. A second stage was constructed in 1969 and a third stage later linked the Wharf Street building to the Middle Warehouse. In the 1970s the timber floor of the Wharf Street Warehouse was removed and replaced with concrete at a lower level to enable the handling of goods on pallets. In the 1950s renovations were carried out to the ground floor of the Kent Street Building including a new hardwood floor and the addition of internal stairs from Kent Street to the upper floor. The cast-iron columns, reputedly used as ballast in a ship from Britain, were retained. By 1959, the slate roof of the Kent Street Building had been replaced with corrugated iron sheeting. In the 1980s the building was internally refurbished and the front awning replaced. In 1989 the ground floor and part of the first floor of the Middle Warehouse were leased to Australia Post. Additions and alterations carried out for this tenancy included the erection of a covered loading area, the replacement of the timber (over brick) ground floor with concrete, the replacement of cedar joinery and shutters with silky oak, and the insertion of internal stairs to the first floor. The remaining part of the upper floor is occupied by the Wide Bay Art Society Gallery.  Brown's Warehouse  Brown's Building on Wharf Street, 2009 Brown's Warehouse is a two-storey brick warehouse erected in 1879 for Maryborough wine and spirit merchant, James Edwin Brown. Brown arrived in Maryborough in 1857 becoming a business partner of WF Naugton, who died soon after. In 1872 Brown purchased the Wharf Street property, which was somewhat closer to the river than his previous premises at Richmond Street. A timber building on the site was replaced by a brick warehouse described at the time as the finest of the kind in the district and modelled upon the \\"best business warehouses of the southern capitals\\". Supervised by Maryborough architect and surveyor, James Buchanan, the building contained a storeroom on each floor with an internal stair and lift at the rear. The upper floor was supported by 10 iron columns cast at Walker and Co.'s local foundry. Brick and plaster work was undertaken by local builder F Kinne, who later became a businessman and Mayor, and woodwork by D Ross. Brown's business interests prospered until the financial crash of the 1890s, which caused him to return from retirement to the business. In 1897, Brown was joined by his two sons who continued to operate the firm as JE Brown and Sons Ltd after Brown's death in 1899 at his home called Woodstock. Ownership of the property passed out of the Brown family in 1951. After a number of owners it was purchased by Gatakers Pty Ltd in 1972. After being group titled in 1988 the building passed to other owners. In 2016, it is occupied by the Maryborough Military and Colonial Museum.  Description  Gataker's Warehouse Complex comprises three buildings built along the east boundary of the site between Kent and Wharf Street and a fourth, Brown's Warehouse or Store, built on an adjoining allotment to the west fronting Wharf Street.  Kent Street Building  The Kent Street Building is a two- storeyed cement rendered brick building with a hipped corrugated iron roof. The symmetrical south facade, to Kent Street, has corner pilasters, a protruding central bay and mouldings including window surrounds, eave brackets and a heavy cornice between floors. The first floor has a central sash window with an arched sash window to either side. The ground floor has a metal street awning with a skillion roof and timber trim, and timber framed glazing and doors. The west and north elevations are rendered and scribed to imitate stonework, with the west elevation having a metal access stair to the first level. A single-storeyed brick store with a corrugated iron gable roof and side awning is attached to the northeast of the building. Internally, the ground floor has been refitted as an office with a concrete floor and partition walls but retains the original cast iron Ionic columns, some of the joinery and a section of the timber floor to the rear of the building. The first floor is accessed via a stair at the southwest corner and is used as a dance studio. A hardwood timber floor with insulation has been laid over the older pine floor, and partition walls used to create bathrooms and stores. This space has a raked boarded ceiling with exposed timber trusses.  Middle Warehouse  Middle warehouse, 2009 The Middle Warehouse is a two-storeyed English bond brick building with a corrugated iron gable roof and two-storeyed brick lean-to at the south end. Both floors have sash windows, some with bars, with arched brick headers and timber shutters, and each end gable has a lancet window. External steel stairs are located at the northwest to access a gallery space in the north of the first floor, and at the south to access staff amenities. A large, steel truss gable roof is attached to the southwest of the building covering the loading area, with a lower cement rendered toilet block and bike store to the west. The ground floor has been extensively altered, with internal walls, columns and the raised timber floor at truck height being removed and a concrete floor laid and steel beams and columns inserted. Air conditioning has been installed, some openings bricked-in and an opening cut in the north wall to extend the space into an adjacent building. An internal stair at the south end leads to the staff amenities above, which has a suspended ceiling. The gallery space has a raked boarded ceiling with exposed timber trusses and heavy timber doors with original hardware.  Wharf Street Warehouse  Wharf Street Warehouse The Wharf Street Warehouse comprises two single-storeyed brick sheds built at different stages. The front building has an unlined corrugated iron and cement sheet gable roof and barred louvred windows. Internally, the building has a concrete floor, a steel roller door to the south and a stair down to a lower door, opening onto Wharf Street. A large doorway with a sliding timber door opens into the second shed. The second shed has an unlined skillion roof extending to a covered loading area to the west, with a concrete floor and steel roller doors. Remains of an earlier brick structure can be seen in the lower rear corner wall. A bitumen driveway runs along the western side of the site, and accesses car parking behind Brown's Warehouse to the west on Wharf Street.  Brown's Warehouse  Brown's Warehouse is a two-storeyed brick building with a parapeted, corrugated iron gable roof and a rendered facade to Wharf Street. This symmetrical facade consists of a central, arched recessed entry and flight of steps with iron gates and an arched sash window to either side. The first floor has a central sash window with J.E. BROWN ESTAB 1857 in relief above, with twin arched sash windows to either side. Render mouldings include a cornice and brackets following the gable with finials to the centre and corners, and window surrounds with horizontal cornice banding. The east elevation has a timber stair with a sliding timber door of diagonal panelling to the first floor and a steel roller door and sash windows with bars to the ground floor. The rear of the building has a steel roller door to the ground floor and the west elevation has only one window in the upper northeast. Internally, the ground floor has cast iron columns and an exposed timber floor above. The building contains cedar joinery including panelled doors, staircase and architraves.

Early life Alcorn was born in Hokitika on the West Coast of New Zealand's South Island in 1868 to Samuel Wesley and Jane Alcorn (born Andrews). Samuel and Jane had emigrated to Dunedin from Ireland, married there in 1865, and then moved to the West Coast. She had one older sibling, Mary and six younger siblings: Ethel, Olive, Winifred, John, William and Kathleen. Samuel was a draper in Hokitika but in 1874 the family moved to Wellington. Samuel bought property in the city on Lambton Quay opposite the department store Kirkcaldie & Stains. He opened a draper shop downstairs and the family lived upstairs. The drapery business was successful, and the Alcorn children enjoyed a prosperous household with a governess and private schools. This life changed dramatically, however, in 1877 when a fire in the shop destroyed the business and killed a younger daughter of the family, Winifred, aged four. The family moved to Ashburton and the children attended school there. Margaret became a dressmaker after finishing her schooling. Business In 1895 some of the Alcorn family moved back to Wellington. Margaret started studying art and design at the Wellington Technical School, and also became the librarian there. In 1902 she won a class prize in design, and in 1903 she won the South Kensington National Book Prize in an art competition run from London. Alcorn's winning entry was of stencilling on fabric, a skill taught by Maud Kimbell, who became a life-long friend of Margaret's. In 1906, Alcorn and her sister Mary opened a shop in the new Kennedy Building on Lambton Quay, Wellington called \\"Liberty's Wellington\\", specialising in art furniture and furnishings, and started selling goods they imported themselves from Liberty department store in London. The sisters also offered professional advice and design ideas for their customers' homes. Window display at \\"Liberty's Wellington\\", ca 1932 Margaret had a long involvement with the business of Arthur Riley, who had been the principal of the Wellington Technical College when she had studied there, and whose premises were also in the Kennedy Building. Margaret was Riley's company secretary, accountant and later a company director. Riley's importing business is still in operation: Arthur D. Riley & Co. Ltd. In the early 1920s the Alcorns' shop expanded into larger premises further along Lambton Quay, taking over Thomas Pringle's embroidery shop and business. At this time the Alcorns also hired a local artist and embroiderer, Marjory Mills, to design embroidery patterns for their shop. After Mary died in 1928, Margaret managed the shop alone, including opening a second shop in Burlington Arcade (pictured). The shops struggled to survive during the Great Depression and the business went into liquidation in 1934. Although Margaret did not legally need to clear the business's debts, she took in boarders until they were paid. Margaret died at her home in Oriental Bay in 1967 and is buried in a family plot at the Bolton Street Cemetery.

History The police station building was originally built in February 1898 as Yuan Dinglinzibian Police Station at Fusing Street. Soon, public school, market and township office were set up around the neighborhood, turning the area into a political and economic center for Linyuan. In 1907, it was renamed Linzibian Police Station and underwent renovation in 1909 as what it is today. After the handover of Taiwan from Japan to the Republic of China in 1945, the government took over the police station and put it under the administration of Fongshan District. In 1958, it was restructured as Linyuan Police Station. In 1989, the police station was relocated to its current address at Linyuan North Road due to space congestion at Fusing Street. Ever since, the abandoned building served as police dormitory building with parts of the building remained unoccupied. In 2007, the Bureau of Cultural Affairs declared the former police station as a historical building. The building then went renovation and reparation which was completed in 2009. Architecture The original police station building consisted of dormitory, garden, ancient wall, cistern and air raid shelter or detention area. It is a one-story Japanese-style building design with bricks and wooden materials.

The set consists of a prefatory chorale and 20 musical vignettes depicting various sports and leisure activities. First published in 1923, it has long been considered one of his finest achievements.Pierre-Daniel Templier, \\"Erik Satie\\", MIT Press, 1969, p. 85. Translated from the original French edition published by Rieder, Paris, 1932.Rollo H. Myers, \\"Erik Satie\\", Dover Publications, Inc., NY, 1968, p. 87.

Reprinted from \\"The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians\\", 1980 edition. Musically it represents the peak of Satie's humoristic piano suites (1912-1915), but stands apart from that series in its fusion of several different art forms. Sports originally appeared as a collector's album with illustrations by Charles Martin, accompanied by music, prose poetry and calligraphy. The latter three were provided by Satie in his exquisite handwritten scores, which were printed in facsimile. Biographer Alan M. Gillmor wrote that \\"Sports et divertissements is sui generis, the one work in which the variegated strands of Satie's artistic experience are unselfconsciously woven into a single fragile tapestry of sight and sound ‚Äî a precarious union of Satie the musician, the poet, and the calligrapher...At turns droll and amusing, serious and sardonic, this tiny Gesamtkunstwerk affords us as meaningful a glimpse of the composer's subconscious dreamworld as we are ever likely to get.\\"Alan M. Gillmor, \\"Musico-poetic Form in Satie's \\"Humoristic\\" Piano Suites (1913-14)\\", Canadian University Music Review/Revue de musique des universit√©s canadiennes, n¬∞ 8, 1987, p. 37. See https://www.erudit.org/revue/cumr/1987/v/n8/1014932ar.pdf. Background 1920 cover of Lucien Vogel's magazine La Gazette du Bon Ton The idea for Sports et divertissements was initiated by Lucien Vogel (1886-1954), publisher of the influential Paris fashion magazine La Gazette du Bon Ton and later founder of the famous pictorial weekly Vu. It was conceived as an haute couture version of the livre d'artiste (\\"artist's book\\"), a sumptuous, expensive collector's album combining art, literature, and occasionally music, which was popular among French connoisseurs in the years before World War I.Steven Moore Whiting, \\"Satie the Bohemian\\", Clarendon Press, 1999, p. 399.Mary E. Davis, \\"Erik Satie\\", Reaktion Books, 2007, pp. 94-96. Gazette illustrator Charles Martin provided the artwork, 20 witty copper plate etchings showing the affluent at play while dressed in the latest fashions. The title itself was an advertising slogan found in women's magazines of the period, designed to draw tourists to upscale resorts.Davis, \\"Erik Satie\\", p. 95. An often repeated legend asserts that Igor Stravinsky was first approached to compose the music, but he rejected Vogel's proposed fee as too small. Gazette staffer Valentine Hugo then recommended Satie, with whom she had recently become friends. Although he was offered a lesser amount than Stravinsky, Satie claimed it was excessive and against his moral principles to accept; only when the fee was substantially reduced did he agree to the project.Myers, \\"Erik Satie\\", Dover Publications, Inc., NY, 1968, p. 87.Whiting, \\"Satie the Bohemian\\", p. 401, note 106.Olof H√∂jer's notes to \\"Erik Satie: The Complete Piano Music, Vol. 5\\", p. 23, Swedish Society Discofil, 1996. According to independent Satie scholar Ornella Volta, a likelier account of the transaction had Satie's young disciple Alexis Roland-Manuel urging him to haggle Vogel for more money. He was furiously scolded by the composer, who feared such demands would cause him to lose the commission altogether. In fact the 3000 francs Satie received for Sports was by far the largest sum he had earned from his music up to that point.Davis, \\"Erik Satie\\", p. 94. Not two years earlier he had sold the first of his humoristic piano suites, the Veritables Preludes flasques (pour un chien), for a mere 50 francs.Templier, \\"Erik Satie\\", MIT Press, 1969, pp. 34-35. Satie was familiar with the livre d'artiste tradition. Some of the earliest examples had been published by the Montmartre cabaret Le Chat Noir while he was a pianist there in the late 1880s.Whiting, \\"Satie the Bohemian\\", pp. 399-400. He found in it an ideal format for his unique interdisciplinary talents. \\"Keep it short\\" was the only advice Satie ever gave to aspiring young composers,Ornella Volta (editor), \\"A Mammal's Notebook: The Writings of Erik Satie\\", Atlas Publishing, London, 1996 (reissued 2014), p. 11. and the necessary restrictions of the Sports album - one page per composition - perfectly suited his predilection for brevity. Extramusical commentary was becoming increasingly prominent in his keyboard works of the period, and in Sports he indulged this by writing a surrealistic prose poem on each theme; he then meticulously calligraphed these into his India ink scores, in black ink for the notes and words and red ink for the staves. Whether Vogel expected these additional contributions or not, he wisely agreed to reproduce Satie's striking autographs in facsimile. There is no record that Satie had contact with Charles Martin or access to his illustrations while composing the suite.Helen Julia Minors, \\"Exploring Interart Dialogue in Erik Satie's Sports et divertissements (1914/1922)\\", published as Chapter 6 in Dr. Caroline Potter (ed.), \\"Erik Satie: Music, Art and Literature\\", Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2013. Musicologists Robert Orledge and Steven Moore Whiting believe Satie directly musicalized at least one of the pictures, Le Golf (the last piece he composed);Robert Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", Cambridge University Press, 1990, p. 214. otherwise, according to Whiting, \\"one finds a wide range of relationships between music-cum-story and drawing, from the close correspondence in Le Golf to outright contradiction, with varying degrees of reinterpretation in between.\\"Whiting, \\"Satie the Bohemian\\", p. 403. If Satie knew of the images beforehand he evidently did not feel obligated to use them as the basis for his work, and filtered the different sporting themes through his own imagination instead. Thus, again from Whiting, \\"While the relation of Satie's music to his own texts is quite close, the relation of music to drawing is more elusive.\\"Whiting, \\"Satie the Bohemian\\", p. 402. Ultimately, Martin's 1914 etchings would not be seen by the public for many years. The long-delayed publication of Sports led the artist to replace them with an updated set of illustrations after World War I. As Satie's material remained unchanged, the new drawings are connected to the music and texts only by their titles.Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 303. As noted on the individual scores, the pieces were completed from March 14 (La P√™che) to May 20 (Le Golf), 1914. Satie delivered them to Vogel in groups of three as the work progressed, drawing part of his fee (150 francs per piece) each time. The Pr√©face and introductory chorale may have been tossed in gratis, as they were not part of the original project.Ornella Volta, \\"Give a Dog a Bone: Some investigations into Erik Satie.\\" Originally published as \\"Le rideau se leve sur un os\\" in the Revue International de la Musique Francaise, Vol. 8, No. 23, 1987.

Satie would insist on installment payments for all his later big commissions. Conscious of his spendthrift nature when he had money, he used this method to cover his immediate living expenses and save himself from the temptation of squandering his entire fee at once, which had happened in the past.Ornella Volta (ed.), \\"Satie Seen Through His Letters\\", Marion Boyars Publishers, London, 1989, pp. 75, 169-170.Satie evidently never kept a bank account. Author Blaise Cendrars recalled a 1924 experience helping the composer cash a large check in Paris and then trying to get him safely home with the money, while Satie insisted on stopping for meals, drinks, and to stock up on cigars and his favorite detachable collars (of which he bought a gross).

Also see Henri Sauguet's reminiscences in the same book, p. 210. Music and texts Satie's Pr√©face for Sports describes the work as an amalgam of drawing and music, omitting any reference to his extramusical commentaries and calligraphy.As Satie signed and dated the autograph scores for each number, the provenance of his texts and calligraphy would not have been in question. His prose poems are carefully threaded throughout the scores so that they may be read along with - but not easily spoken over - the piano part.Mary E. Davis, \\"Erik Satie\\", Reaktion Books, 2007, p. 96. Gillmor observed that \\"In several of the pieces Satie indulges in a kind of Augenmusik wherein the musical score is an obvious graphic representation of the activity being depicted.\\"Alan M. Gillmor, \\"Musico-poetic Form in Satie's \\"Humoristic\\" Piano Suites (1913-14)\\", pp. 33-35. In others the score is often closely linked to the text - such as in La P√™che - and the subtle details may not be perceived merely by listening. Performance of the music alone lasts between 13 and 15 minutes. Facsimile of Satie's handwritten Pr√©face and score for the Choral inappetissant (Unappetizing Chorale) Pr√©face \\"This publication is made up of two artistic elements: drawing, music.

No more should be read into it. For the Dried Up & Stultified I have written a Chorale which is serious & respectable. This Chorale is a sort of bitter preamble, a kind of austere & unfrivolous introduction. I have put into it everything I know about Boredom. I dedicate this Chorale to those who do not like me. I withdraw.\\" - ERIK SATIEEnglish summaries derived from the original French texts at IMSLP http://hz.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/3/35/IMSLP08174-Sports_et_divertissiments.pdf 1\\\\. Choral inappetissant (Unappetizing Chorale) - Grave Seriously. Surly & cantankerous. Hypocritically. More slowly. In the second half of his Pr√©face Satie offered a rare \\"explanation\\" of one of his favorite musical jokes. He used the chorale form - that \\"symbol of Protestant piety and music pedagogy\\"Mary E. Davis, \\"Erik Satie\\", Reaktion Books, 2007, p. 98. much employed by Bach - in several compositions to thumb his nose at the academic, the stupid and conformist. Satirical examples are found in his piano duet Aper√ßus d√©sagr√©ables (Unpleasant Glimpses) (1908), the orchestral suite En habit de cheval (1911), the Choses vues √† droite et √† gauche (sans lunettes) for violin-piano duet (1914), and the ballet Parade (in the revised 1919 version). The brief Choral inappetissant is built of sour, unsingable phrases that snub the whole purpose of the genre.Rollo H. Myers nevertheless called the Choral inappetissant \\"an impressive fragment\\" and admired its \\"rugged strength and concentrated musical thinking.\\" See Myers, \\"Erik Satie\\", p. 87. Here it serves to warn off the serious-minded from the light-hearted frivolity that ensues. Beneath the date of the score (May 15, 1914) Satie noted, \\"In the morning, on an empty stomach.\\" 2\\\\. La Balan√ßoire (The Swing) - Lent Slowly. Pendulum-like staccato quavers in the left hand underscore four poignant melodic phrases, including a quotation of L'escarpolette from Georges Bizet's 1871 piano suite Jeux d'enfants.Mary E. Davis, \\"Classic Chic: Music, Fashion, and Modernism\\", University of California Press, 2006, pp. 87-89. Satie's text for this piece is frequently cited as an exemplar of his haiku-like prose poems: ::It's my heart that is swinging like this. It isn't dizzy. What little feet it has. ::Will it be willing to return to my breast? Myers, \\"Erik Satie\\", p. 90. 3\\\\. La Chasse (Hunting) - Vif Fast. Satie's first-person narrative is one of his most whimsical literary creations, an absurdist nature-setting in which rabbits sing, nightingales hide in burrows, and owls breast-feed their young. As for the hunter, he uses his rifle to shoot nuts out of the trees. This is presented in the typical \\"hunting rhythm\\" of 6/8, with bugle fifths in the treble and a concluding gunshot in the bass. 4\\\\. La Com√©die Italienne (The Italian Comedy) - A la napolitaine In a Neapolitan manner. Scaramouche, a cowardly braggart from Commedia dell'arte, tries to wax eloquent on the joys of military life. He is mocked with a courtly, ornamented tune that quickly goes awry with displaced accompaniments and ambiguous harmonies. Steven Moore Whiting wrote of this piece, \\"It is as if Satie had discovered in 1914 the same formula that Stravinsky would apply in Pulcinella six years later.\\"Whiting, \\"Satie the Bohemian\\", p. 405. 5\\\\. Le R√©veil de la Mari√©e (The Awakening of the Bride) - Vif, sans trop Lively, but not too. In this boisterous aubade members of a wedding party arrive to rouse the newlywed bride from her marriage bed. Charles Martin's original 1914 illustration showed the group crudely throwing tomatoes at the bedroom window.Volta, \\"A Mammal's Notebook: The Writings of Erik Satie\\", p. 32.Whiting, \\"Satie the Bohemian\\", p. 405, Note 113. The music quotes distorted bits of Fr√®re Jacques (\\"Dormez-vous?\\") and the military bugle call Reveille. Somewhere in the tumult, Satie writes, \\"A dog is dancing with his fianc√©e.\\" 6\\\\. Colin-Maillard (Blind Man's Buff) - Petitement Pettily. Music and text weave a sentimental little drama. In a game of blind man's buff a blindfolded lady approaches a man who has a crush on her. With \\"trembling lips\\" he yearns for her to tag him. She heedlessly passes him by. The man's heartbreak is expressed in an unresolved upward arpeggio. 7\\\\. La P√™che (Fishing) - Calme Calmly. \\"The murmuring of the water in a riverbed\\" is suggested by a gentle repeating figure. A fish swims up, then another, then two more, accompanied by bitonal ascending flourishes. They casually observe a poor fisherman on the bank, then swim away. The fisherman goes home as well, leaving only \\"The murmuring of the water in a riverbed.\\" Satie's construction of this piece - the first he composed in the set - is a perfectly symmetrical arch form (A B C B A).Gillmor, \\"Musico-poetic Form in Satie's \\"Humoristic\\" Piano Suites (1913-14)\\", p. 34. Satie's score for Le Yachting 8\\\\. Le Yachting (Yachting) - Mod√©r√© Moderately. (In half-notes, bass octaves). Legato. A stern ostinato in the lower reaches of the piano summons up a wind-blown sea as it tosses about members of a yachting party. A \\"pretty lady passenger\\" is not amused by the rough weather. \\"I'd rather do something else,\\" she pouts. \\"Go fetch me a car.\\" The sea ostinato returns to end the piece. 9\\\\. Le Bain de Mer (Sea Bathing) - Mouvement√© Eventfully. Another Satie seascape, with rushing arpeggios demonstrating that the ocean is not always congenial to casual tourists. A man leads a woman into the surf, cautioning her, \\"Don't sit at the bottom. It's very damp.\\" Both are struck by some \\"good old waves\\", with the lady getting the worst of it. \\"You're all wet,\\" the man observes. \\"Yes, sir,\\" the woman replies. 10\\\\. Le Carnaval (Carnival) - L√©ger Lightly. Confetti rains down on a Carnival celebration. Costumed revelers pose and jostle one another, including a drunken Pierrot who is behaving obnoxiously. \\"Are they pretty?\\" the text inquires. Satie answers with an ambivalent musical coda - similar to the ending of Colin-Maillard - and adds the playing direction \\"Hold back considerably.\\" 11\\\\. Le Golf (Golf) - Exalt√© Excitedly. In a sketch of a text related to Sports, Satie described golf as \\"a sport for mature men who have retired...Old English colonels especially excel at it.\\" Satie kept this idea as the basis for Le Golf, introducing a colonel dressed in \\"Scotch tweed of a violent green.\\" He confidently strides through the links, intimidating even the holes in the ground and the clouds in the sky. His march-like theme remarkably prefigures Vincent Youmans' classic 1925 song Tea for Two. The pompous colonel is deflated when his \\"fine swing\\" causes his club to shatter into pieces, described in the score by a sweep of ascending fourths. 12\\\\. La Pieuvre (The Octopus) - Assez vif Briskly. A murky, dissonant piece. An octopus in its underwater cave teases a crab before swallowing it sideways. This gives the octopus severe indigestion. It drinks a glass of salt water and feels better. 13\\\\. Les Courses (Racing) - Un peu vif Somewhat fast. Steadily galloping rhythms whip us through eight verbal snapshots of a horse race from start to finish. \\"The Losers\\" (\\"Les Perdants\\") dejectedly bring up the rear to a distorted rendition of the opening of La Marseillaise. Ornella Volta ventured that this parodic coda, written on the brink of World War I, \\"says a lot about Satie's military-patriotic sentiments.\\"Volta, \\"A Mammal's Notebook: The Writings of Erik Satie\\", p. 182, note 14. 14\\\\. Les Quatre-Coins (Puss in the Corner) - Joie moder√©e With moderate joy. In Satie's playfully literal idea of the children's game, four mice tease a cat, with predictable results. The implications of how \\"Puss\\" wins his \\"corner\\" are left to the listeners' imagination. The piece features another quote from Bizet's Jeux d'enfants on the same subject (Les quatre coins).Davis, \\"Classic Chic: Music, Fashion, and Modernism\\", pp. 89-91. 15\\\\. Le Pique-nique (The Picnic) - Dansant Dance-like. A pleasant outing - to which \\"Everyone has brought very cold veal\\" - gets rained out by a storm. The music opens with a folk-like dance that segues into a veiled allusion to Claude Debussy's cakewalk Le petit N√®gre (1909).Robert Orledge, \\"Satie & Les Six\\". Published as Chapter 6 in Richard Langham Smith, Caroline Potter (editors), \\"French Music Since Berlioz\\", Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2006, pp. 223-248, info cited on pp. 227-228. After a recapitulation of the folk dance the piece ends abruptly with suggestions of thunder, which the picnickers initially mistake for the sound of an airplane. 16\\\\. Le Water-chute (The Water Chute) - Gracieusement Graciously. To the strains of an innocuous waltz theme a pair of pleasure-seekers prepare to go on a water slide. The more reluctant of the two is persuaded with dubious reassurances (\\"You will feel as if you were falling off a scaffolding\\"). Following an expectant musical pause the ride itself is evoked with dizzying plunging scales. The squeamish one feels sick afterwards but is told, \\"That proves you needed to have some fun.\\"Satie's use of a waltz theme and Martin's illustrations (both 1914 and 1922 versions) suggest the characters are an intimate couple, but Satie's text makes no reference to the gender of either. Satie's score for Le Tango 17\\\\. Le Tango (perp√©tuel) (The [Perpetual] Tango) - Mod√©r√© & tr√®s ennuy√© Moderately & with great boredom. Satie's satirical look at the tango craze that swept Western Europe in the pre-World War I era. On January 10, 1914, Archbishop of Paris L√©on-Adolphe Amette denounced the dance as immoral and forbade it to practicing Catholics.\\"Tango Dancing Must Be Confessed As Sin\\", The Cornell Daily Sun, Volume XXXIV, Number 82, 10 January 1914, http://cdsun.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cornell?a=d&d;=CDS19140110.2.41# In his text Satie appears to agree with the cleric's ruling by calling the tango \\"the Dance of the Devil\\", but then adds a droll glimpse of Satan's domestic life: \\"It's his favorite. He dances it to cool off. His wife, his daughters & his servants get cool that way.\\"The original French contains a pun: \\"se refroidissent ainsi\\" can also mean \\"catch cold that way.\\" The music is intentionally banal, an attenuated, vaguely \\"Spanish\\" tune wandering aimlessly through several keys over a persistent tango rhythm. As a final joke the repeat signs at the beginning and end of the score indicate the piece is to be played ad infinitum, presenting a hellish eternity of musical monotony.Whiting, \\"Satie the Bohemian\\", p. 407. Satie had earlier \\"suggested\\" 840 repetitions of his (then unpublished) 1893 piano piece Vexations, but in Le Tango he took this notion to its logical (and unperformable) conclusion. 18\\\\. Le Tra√Æneau (The Sled) - Courez Running. At under half a minute in performance the shortest piece in the set. Satie's music for the sled speeding along is purely descriptive - a series of skittering, frenetic bursts covering most of the keyboard - while the commentary is mostly concerned with the icy conditions: \\"Ladies, keep your noses inside your furs...The landscape is very cold and doesn't know what to do with itself.\\" 19\\\\. Le Flirt (Flirting) - Agit√© Agitatedly. An impetuous man tries to seduce an uninterested woman by telling her \\"nice things...modern things.\\" She rebuffs him by saying \\"I would like to be on the moon\\", underscored by a snatch of the folksong Au clair de la lune.Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 202. The would-be lover nods his head in defeat. 20\\\\. Le Feu d'artifice (Fireworks) - Rapide Rapidly. Another descriptive piece. As Bengal lights and other fireworks streak across the evening sky, \\"An old man goes crazy\\" among the spectators. Ascending triplets bring the number to an explosive climax, followed by a desolate whimper.Gillmor, \\"Musico-poetic Form in Satie's \\"Humoristic\\" Piano Suites (1913-14)\\", p. 33. 21\\\\. Le Tennis (Tennis) - Avec c√©r√©monie Ceremoniously. In his June 1913 squib about Debussy's ballet Jeux for the journal Revue musicale S.I.M., Satie poked fun at Ballets Russes choreographer Vaslav Nijinsky for presenting it as a \\"tennis match\\" while taking absurd liberties with the game, which Nijinsky seemed to have confused with soccer (use of a football, no racquets or center court net). Satie mirthfully defined the result as a new sport, \\"Russian tennis\\", which he predicted would become \\"all the rage.\\"Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 64.Satie probably wrote this satirical \\"review\\" to amuse his longtime friend Debussy, who hated Nijinsky's choreography for Jeux. He offered no opinion of Debussy's score. He may well have recalled this episode when he composed Le Tennis 10 months later. The music, while depicting the back-and-forth of the players, is strangely dark and ambiguous; and the implied eroticism that pervaded the choreography of Jeux is trivialized in Satie's text, in which the spectator-narrator mixes prosaic sensual observations (\\"What good-looking legs he has...what a fine nose\\") with correct sports terminology (\\"A slice serve!\\"). The piece, and the suite, end on one word (in English): \\"Game!\\"Satie similarly opens the text of this piece with the English words \\"Play? Yes!\\" Publication Charles Martin's main title page for the 1923 edition The complex early publication history of Sports et divertissements was elucidated by Ornella Volta in the 1980s.Volta, \\"Give a Dog a Bone: Some investigations into Erik Satie.\\" See note 21. It was apparently ready for the printers when World War I broke out in July 1914. Under ensuing military censorship many French periodicals, including La Gazette du Bon Ton, folded or were suspended.Apart from a special Summer issue in 1915, La Gazette du Bon Ton would not resume publication until January 1920. See Davis, \\"Classic Chic: Music, Fashion, and Modernism\\", p. 263, note 47. Vogel dissolved his company in 1916 and later sold the materials for Sports to the publisher Maynial. He remained interested in the project, however, and as Maynial made no effort to produce the album Vogel repurchased the rights under his new company Les Editions Lucien Vogel et du Bon Ton in March 1922. Fashions and graphic design had changed dramatically in the intervening years, so Charles Martin was commissioned to replace his original illustrations with a new set of drawings in a Cubist-influenced style; these were rendered into full-color pochoir prints at the studio of Jean Saud√©, a leading practitioner of the technique.http://www.worldcat.org/title/sports-et- divertissements/oclc/221452424 This edition was announced in January 1923, but the publisher √âditions de La Sir√®ne, which then had Satie under exclusive contract, intervened to assert their rights over the music. The work's release was further delayed as Vogel worked out a settlement with La Sir√®ne.Volta, \\"Give a Dog a Bone\\". See note 21. Charles Martin, La P√™che (Fishing), 1923 edition A decade after its conception, Sports et divertissements was finally published in late 1923 in an edition of 900 numbered portfolio copies, on handmade paper. Facsimiles of Satie's scores (in black and red ink) appeared in all, but Martin's artwork was presented in three different print runs. The very rare first set, copies 1 to 10, included both Martin's original 1914 illustrations and his 1922 pochoir prints, his engraved Table of Contents and individual title pages, and cameos decorating the latter. These bibliophile volumes were not for sale but were reserved for the Librairie Maynial.Gavin Bryars, \\"Satie and the British\\", Contact 25 (1982), pp. 4-15. Copies 11 to 225 featured Martin's 1922 plates and title pages.Trivia: The second copy of the original edition of Sports available to the public - No. 12 - was purchased by the eccentric English composer and Satie fan Lord Berners. See Bryars, \\"Satie and the British\\", pp. 4-15. The third version (copies 226 to 900) had Martin's title pages and cameos but only one of his colorful illustrations (La Com√©die Italienne) as a frontispiece.To view the complete third version see http://satie-point.net/satie-sportsdiss-engl.html Charles Martin, Le Tango, 1923 edition In 1926, Rouart, Lerolle & Cie purchased the rights for Sports from Vogel and brought out a standard performing edition, with Satie's facsimile scores in black ink only and without Martin's illustrations. It was republished by Salabert in 1964. In 1982, Dover Publications issued Satie's facsimiles together with black-and-white reproductions of Martin's 1922 illustrations as a trade paperback, and this is probably the best known English edition. It was reprinted in 2012. The order of the pieces from the original edition onwards was chosen by Vogel and does not reflect Satie's preferences. The composer had a specific musical sequence in mind in 1914, which upon further reflection he changed for the 1922 public premiere.Satie's 1914 notebooks reveal he originally wanted the pieces played in this order: 1, 8, 18, 17, 10, 5, 11, 7, 12, 21, 15, 13, 9, 3, 2, 16, 6, 14, 4, 20, 19. The numbers refer to the sequence chosen by Vogel, published in all editions and cited in this article. See Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 304.The sequence Marcelle Meyer played at the premiere was 1, 9, 16, 12, 6, 11, 19, 10, 21, 17, 5, 8, 18, 3, 13, 14, 15, 7, 20, 2, 4. See Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 304. While he eschewed standard compositional development and structure, Satie was highly aware of the formal \\"architecture\\" of his music and sequenced his multi-movement works with great care.Whiting, \\"Satie the Bohemian\\", p. 475. Robert Orledge, for one, believes that either of Satie's versions are musically preferable to the one selected by his publisher and ubiquitously performed ever since.Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 304. For over 80 years most of Martin's 1914 illustrations were known only to a handful of private collectors and interested scholars. Ornella Volta published two (Le Water- chute and Le Pique-nique) in a 1987 article,Volta, \\"Give a Dog a Bone\\", cited above. and Le Golf appeared in Robert Orledge's book Satie the Composer (1990).Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 214. An almost complete set (minus Le Tra√Æneau) was presented in Volta's edition of Satie's literary writings, A Mammal's Notebook (1996), making the bulk of Martin's original work available for the first time.Volta, \\"A Mammal's Notebook: The Writings of Erik Satie\\", Atlas Publishing, London, 1996 (reissued 2014), pp. 29-45. Reception Erik Satie, 1923 Initial response to Sports et divertissements was muted due to the exclusive nature of its original publication. When the first commercial performing edition appeared in 1926, Satie was dead and his growing reputation as a serious composer had been tarnished by the widespread critical condemnation of his last work, the Dada ballet Rel√¢che (1924).Ann-Marie Hanlon, \\"Satie and the French Musical Canon: A Reception Study\\", University of Newcastle Upon Tyne, 2013, pp. 74-75, 103. While Satie's music faded from Parisian concert programs of the late 1920s and early 1930s,Templier, \\"Erik Satie\\", p. 113. Sports quietly circulated among musicians and faithful fans, some of whom immediately recognized its importance. Darius Milhaud called it \\"One of the most characteristic works of the modern French School,\\"Myers, \\"Erik Satie\\", p. 85. and in 1932 biographer Pierre-Daniel Templier proclaimed that the spirits of Satie and of French music were \\"prodigiously alive\\" in its pages. Some early enthusiasts looked to Japanese art to find antecedents to its miniaturist craft. Composer Charles Koechlin compared Sports to netsuke and pianist Alfred Cortot remarked on its haiku qualities. In the English- speaking world the piece received its first significant boost after World War II from Rollo H. Myers' biography Erik Satie (1948), in which he ranked Sports with a handful of Satie compositions that are \\"outstanding and cannot be ignored by any student of contemporary music.\\"Myers, \\"Erik Satie\\", p. 92. Myers continued, \\"Satie here proves himself an artist of the finest quality, working to a scale which in itself would be a handicap to most writers, let alone musicians, but triumphing over his self-imposed limitations with the virtuosity of a marksman scoring a bull's-eye with each shot. On a miniature range, perhaps; but is artistry a matter of dimensions?\\" Performance Pianist Marcelle Meyer (center) with members of Les Six in 1921 In his Pr√©face to Sports et divertissements, Satie wrote only of its conception as a printed album and offered no suggestions as to how it might be presented in a concert setting. It is worth noting that in his next composition, the piano suite Heures s√©culaires et instantan√©es (written June ‚Äì July 1914), he issued his famous \\"warning\\" to the players forbidding them from reading his extramusical texts aloud during the performance.Score of Heures s√©culaires et instantan√©es available at IMSLP. His disciple Francis Poulenc confirmed this applied to all his mentor's humoristic piano music.Francis Poulenc, \\"Erik Satie's Piano Music\\", La Revue Musicale, No. 214, June 1952, pp. 23-26. Reprinted in Nicolas Southon, \\"Francis Poulenc: Articles and Interviews: Notes from the Heart\\", Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2014. However Satie was not averse to the music for Sports being played and there were at least three live performances before the completed album finally saw print. On December 14, 1919, Lucien Vogel and his wife held a private musical soir√©e at their Paris apartment which included \\"a few little novelties, entitled Sports & Divertissements, by M. Erik Satie.\\" Details of this performance are lacking though it appears Satie himself was the pianist.H√∂jer, notes to \\"Erik Satie: The Complete Piano Music, Vol. 5\\". The public premiere was given by Satie's trusted interpreter of the 1920s, pianist Marcelle Meyer, at the Salle de La Ville l'√âv√™que in Paris on January 31, 1922. It was part of a three-concert series in which Meyer presented Satie's music in historical contexts, from the early clavecin masters to the contemporary avant-garde; Sports was programmed with piano pieces by members of Les Six.http://www.musicalobservations.com/publications/satie.html. Paul Zukofsky, \\"Satie Notes\\", 2011, revised text of program notes for the 1991 Summergarden Concert Series of the Museum of Modern Art, New York City. This was followed by the United States premiere at the Klaw Theatre in New York City on February 4, 1923, sponsored by Satie champion Edgard Var√®se through the auspices of his International Composers Guild. The pianist was E. Robert Schmitz.Carol J.

Patrick Gowers, writing for The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians in 1980, described the multi-faceted yet intimate nature of Sports et divertissements as \\"a private art that tends to resist public performance.\\" Steven Moore Whiting elaborated on this, citing the eternally self-repeating Le Tango as proof of the impossibility of performing Sports as literally written. He argued: \\"The music can be played, but not the pictures or narratives. The 'work' is the composite of (or contrapuntal interplay between) verbal preface, musical preamble, drawings, illustrative piano pieces (which seldom agree completely with the illustrations), stories, performance instructions, calligraphy, and titles (some of them with variants)...How to do justice to all of this in a public recital?\\"Whiting, \\"Satie the Bohemian\\", pp. 407-408. Virgil Thomson There has nevertheless arisen a debatable performance tradition which presents Sports as a multi-media concert experience. Composer- critic Virgil Thomson, one of Satie's foremost American champions of the 20th Century, began performing Sports as a work for \\"narrator and piano\\" in New York City in the mid-1950s.\\"Colleagues Honor 90th Birthday of Virgil Thomson, Feisty Man of Music\\", New York Times, September 21, 1986, at https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/21/arts/colleagues-honor-90th-birthday-of- virgil-thomson-feisty-man-of-music.html. His translations of the texts appeared in the first English edition of Sports published by Salabert in 1975.http://www.worldcat.org/title/piano-music-vol-3-sports- divertisssments/oclc/658385356/editions?start_edition=11&sd;=desc&referer;=di&se;=yr&editionsView;=true&fq;= Thomson continued to perform it in this fashion to the end of his life. \\"I feel a connection with the Satie piece\\", he said in 1986, when he was 90. \\"It turns me on. You know there's a song that goes 'I don't know why I love you, but I do, ooooh, ooooh.'A reference to Stevie Wonder's 1968 song \\"I Don't Know Why I Love You,\\" covered by the Jackson 5 (who added the \\"ooooh, ooooh\\" to the lyrics) in 1970. Sometimes you know why you don't like something, but you don't know why you like it.\\" \\"Colleagues Honor 90th Birthday of Virgil Thomson, Feisty Man of Music\\", New York Times, September 21, 1986. Since then performances of Sports for voice and piano have been supplemented by arrangements for \\"speaker and ensemble,\\" including chamber orchestra versions by composers Dominic Muldowney (1981) and David Bruce (2008).http://www.universaledition.com/Erik-Satie/composers-and- works/composer/629/work/4941http://www.worldcat.org/title/sports-et- divertissements-for-narrator-and-chamber-orchestra/oclc/704941175 A typical performance involves a narrator reading each of Satie's prose poems before the music is played; sometimes they are accompanied by background projections, either of Martin's illustrations, Satie's calligraphed scores, original artwork, or a combination of the three.https://vimeo.com/69628543 Orthodox Satie scholarship has largely ignored this trend, observing Satie's stated prohibition against the reading of his texts aloud, and the majority of commercial recordings of Sports feature his music only.

The game was released for Microsoft Windows via Steam on October 27, 2015 and is a spin-off of an earlier Funcom game, The Secret World. It was released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on May 3, 2016 and Nintendo Switch on October 22, 2019. It will be released in Japan on September 24, 2020. The game takes place in the Atlantic Island Park that closed back in the year of 1980 for mysterious reasons that are gradually revealed throughout the game. Gameplay The Park is experienced from a first-person perspective as the player, Lorraine, interacts with and experiences the decrepit environment of Atlantic Island Park. There is no combat or defense and the player has no health HUD as Lorraine can only interact with limited objects in-game and there are no enemies to battle. These objects mostly consist of pages that reveal the backstory of the park and later, Lorraine. Lorraine can call out to character Callum at any time during gameplay, and this may have a small affect as it allows Lorraine to follow Callum's voice and thus continue the narrative of the story or to reach necessary areas or objectives within the park such as the rides. The rides act as both exposition and scares. To enter the House of Horrors, Lorraine must find a flashlight. Throughout the game, Lorraine narrates her feelings and memories to the player. Plot The game follows Lorraine, a struggling single mother and widow with a troubled past, as she searches for her young son, Callum, who goes missing in Atlantic Island Park. Lorraine enters the park after her son just as the park prepares to close for the afternoon, only to find that nighttime comes unnaturally fast as she ascends the escalator and discovers the park to be abandoned, vandalized and rundown as if several years have passed. Despite abandonment, the rides and lights mysteriously still function. Lorraine calls for Callum and his voice calls to her, leading her through the decrepit park. Lorraine boards several rides which reveal the themes and backstory of the game: the Tunnel of Tales tells the story of Hansel and Gretel, this time with a new ending - in which after cooking the witch in the oven, Hansel and Gretel devour her. On the Ferris Wheel, Lorraine remembers Callum's father Don, a construction worker at the park who died in a fall from the Ferris Wheel when Lorraine was still pregnant with Callum. Between rides, Lorraine expresses her frustration with Callum, her belief that she is a failure as a mother, her history of mental health problems, and her fear that Callum is becoming changed by some mysterious threat. However, while aboard the roller coaster, a monstrous top-hatted ringmaster (identified in the credits as The Boogeyman) accosts Lorraine and claims 'the Witch' has her son. According to notes found throughout the area, the park's grounds are hinted to have a sinister history that tainted them, as a consequence of previous owner Archibald Henderson's actions, which the new owner Mr. Winter tried to take advantage of: several notes indicate that he had found a way to unlock the power hidden beneath the grounds by harvesting the positive emotions of guests, and believed that the energy he unlocked would be enough to grant him immortality. However, workers and employees alike experienced feelings of anxiety as a result of the process, and a number of fatal incidents occurred. One noticeable case involved 'Chad the Chipmunk', the park's mascot: Steve, the employee wearing the chipmunk suit, became disturbed and reluctant to remove the suit as time went on - and ultimately murdered a teenager with an icepick. Following Steve's arrest and the disappearance of over a dozen children inside the House of Horrors, the Park was forced to close permanently, drawing Lorraine's perceptions during the introduction into question. At last, Lorraine enters the witch-faced House of Horrors, still following Callum, and remarking on the similarity between this and the Hansel and Gretel story. Inside, messages from Mr. Winter reveal that he retreated into the House with his machines when the Park closed, hoping to achieve immortality by other means. However, the interior of the House changes to a loop of Lorraine and Callum's own home through time, where it is revealed that Lorraine's father abused and abducted her as a child, her estranged mother refuses to help her in the belief that she ran away from home, and she suffered from depression when Callum was born and given electroshock therapy. As Lorraine passes through each version of her house, it becomes more decrepit and disturbing. At the end, she finds a message by Mr. Winter revealing that he needs children for his harvesting machines, and has already kidnapped and killed at least one in order to fuel his immortality; notes such as these, combined with popular depictions of Winter in a similar ringmaster's garb and top hat, suggest that he is actually the Boogeyman haunting the grounds. Lorraine reveals that in the oldest versions of the Hansel and Gretel story, the cruel mother and the Witch were the same person, and that she believes she is the real Witch - apparently accepting that her neglect of Callum was the indirect cause of Callum's disappearance. Finally, she reaches Callum, lying unconscious on a slab. Chad the Chipmunk appears behind her, then is replaced by the Boogeyman, who forces a bloody icepick into Lorraine's hands, then guides her hands so she holds the point above Callum's chest; however, he then releases her hands and vanishes, allowing Lorraine to stab Callum in the heart. Afterwards, Lorraine is sitting in a police station interrogation room, clearly grief-stricken. A detective identical to the Park gatekeeper enters, carrying a jar with a bee in it, and tells her not to worry about losing things and to think of the last place she saw her son. Lorraine narrates that, in her heart and mind, she will always return to Atlantic Island Park. Ultimately, though the supernatural elements of the game are eventually confirmed to be true by the game's ties with The Secret World and Lorraine's appearance in later issues of the game, it's left ambiguous as to how much of The Park was real and how much was simply imaginary. Development The Park was announced by Funcom on August 26, 2015. According to Funcom's Rui Casais, the games' development began as an experiment by a small team. The team hoped to utilize the worlds from their previous massively multiplayer online games, and reshape them into some smaller single-player games. According to Casasis, it was \\"creatively energising\\" for the team to work on a new single-player game as their last game with a single-player focus was Dreamfall: The Longest Journey in 2006. The game's universe is based on 2012's The Secret World. The game was announced for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in November 2015. Funcom later announced that the console versions will be released on May 3, 2016, making it the first Funcom game developed for consoles since Dreamfall in 2006. Reception The game holds a rating of 67 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 25 reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\".

Incident Dede entered Kaarma's garage late at night looking for alcohol; according to prosecutors, Kaarma had deliberately set out to attract and then shoot a burglar. In December 2014, Kaarma was convicted of deliberate homicide, a charge that is equivalent to First Degree Murder in other states. He was sentenced to 70 years in prison and will be eligible for parole after 20 years of incarceration. In February 2017, the Montana Supreme Court upheld Karma's conviction. The United States Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal at the federal level as to whether his 6th Amendment rights had been violated and that he had not received an impartial jury. In July 2019, Missoula County District Judge Ed McLean, who retired shortly after presiding over Kaarma's trial, denied Kaarma's request for a new trial based on ineffective assistance of counsel, writing that Kaarma's attorneys had performed \\"...within the wide range of professionally competent assistance\\". Background Montana's \\"Castle doctrine\\" law was amended in 2009 allowing the use of deadly force if a homeowner \\"reasonably believes\\" an intruder is attempting to harm them. The amendment was sponsored by the U.S.'s biggest gun lobby, the National Rifle Association (NRA). Prior to the amendment, homeowners could use deadly force only if the invader acted in a violent way. Reactions The case attracted national and international attention, particularly in Germany, Dede's home country. Much of the attention focused on Montana's Castle doctrine law, which Kaarma claimed justified his actions. This popularity led NBC's Dateline television series to profile the incident on an episode that originally aired on April 30, 2015. In response to the guilty verdict in the Kaarma case, the \\"Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America\\", a non-profit organization, released the following public statement from their Montana Chapter volunteer, Julia Starrett. > Today justice prevailed over senseless and unnecessary gun violence with the > guilty verdict in the Kaarma trial.

Facts Interdiffusion Srl concluded a contract with Miss Faccini Dori at Milan Central Railway Station for an English language correspondence course. Miss Dori cancelled her order, but was then told Interdiffusion had assigned a claim against her to Recreb Srl. Miss Dori asserted she had a right of cancellation within 7 days under the Consumer Long Distance Contracts Directive 85/577/EEC. Italy had not taken steps to transpose the Directive into national law. The Italian Court, the Giudice Conciliatore di Firenze, ordered Miss Dori to pay the money. She objected, and the court made a reference to the European Court of Justice. Judgment=Advocate General Opinion AG Lenz favoured horizontal direct effect. Court of Justice The Court of Justice held that Miss Dori had a right under the Directive, its provisions were unconditional and sufficiently precise, but without national implementing law she could not rely on the directive itself in an action against another private party: this followed TEEC article 189 (now TFEU article 288) saying that Directives are 'binding only in relation to \\"each Member State to which it is addressed\\".' However, the court would be under a duty to interpret national law, as far as possible in line with the Directive's purpose. Moreover, the state would have to 'make good the damage' caused for failure to implement the law.

Life  Lowenfeld was born in Washington, D.C. to Andreas Lowenfeld, a German-Jewish Professor of International Law (NYU), and Elena Lowenfeld, a Cuban guitar player and art critic. His great-grandfather Rafael L√∂wenfeld, a correspondent for the newspaper Berliner Tagesblatt in St. Petersburg, was the first translator of Leo Tolstoy into German, and Tolstoy's play The Power of Darkness had its world premiere in the Schiller Theater, Berlin, which L√∂wenfeld founded. After the Russian revolution, the Nabokov family lived in the L√∂wenfeld home in Berlin. Lowenfeld studied Russian literature at Harvard, did postgraduate work at St. Petersburg University and then obtained his J.D. degree at New York University. As a trial lawyer, Lowenfeld won several multimillion-dollar judgments on behalf of major Russian film studios Mosfilm, Lenfilm, and Soyuzmultfilm Studios and their licensees against copyright pirates in the USA. Lowenfeld translates from 8 languages, including Russian, German, Spanish, French, Italian and Latin. He has translated verses of Lermontov, Blok, Mandelshtam, Tsvetaeva, Akhmatova, Yesenin, Mayakovsky, Rilke, Goethe, Heine, Pessoa, Lorca, Machado, Mart√≠, Neruda, Leopardi, Petrarch, Dante, Catullus, Ovid, Martial, and Horace. Lowenfeld's translations of Alexander Pushkin received overall positive reviews and considered to be 'the most brilliant and fullest translation' of Pushkin's works because Lowenfeld succeeded in preserving original and distinctive rhythms of most poems so one can easily recognise which poem this is without any knowledge of English: > –Ø –≤–∞—Å –ª—é–±–∏–ª: –ª—é–±–æ–≤—å –µ—â–µ, –±—ã—Ç—å –º–æ–∂–µ—Ç, I loved you once, and still, perhaps, > love‚Äôs yearning > –í –¥—É—à–µ –º–æ–µ–π —É–≥–∞—Å–ª–∞ –Ω–µ —Å–æ–≤—Å–µ–º; Within my soul has not quite burned away. > –ù–æ –ø—É—Å—Ç—å –æ–Ω–∞ –≤–∞—Å –±–æ–ª—å—à–µ –Ω–µ —Ç—Ä–µ–≤–æ–∂–∏—Ç; Yet may that nevermore you be > concerning; > –Ø –Ω–µ —Ö–æ—á—É –ø–µ—á–∞–ª–∏—Ç—å –≤–∞—Å –Ω–∏—á–µ–º.

Performances Lowenfeld has recited, in both Russian and English, at theatrical and musical productions around the world. Awards In 2007 Lowenfeld translated the video collection Animated Soviet Propaganda (4 DVDs), which won the New York Times' \\"Critics' Choice\\" Award. Lowenfeld's dual language compilation titled My Talisman: The Poetry & Life of Alexander Pushkin earned him the prestigious Russian art and literature ‚ÄòPetropol‚Äô prize in 2010. In 2012 his translation of the Russian bestseller Everyday Saints and Other Stories won first prize at New York‚Äôs Read Russia 2012 Festival. Over a million books were printed and over 3 million digital copies sold worldwide by 2012.

Early life Baptised on 4 August 1855 in the church of the Holy Trinity at Paddington, second son of Admiral Charles Ramsay Bethune, 24th of Balfour, and his wife Frances Cecilia Staples, his chosen career was the British Army. Military career At age 20 he gained a commission in the 92nd (Gordon Highlanders) Regiment of Foot in September 1875, seeing service in the Second Anglo-Afghan War in Afghanistan from 1878 to 1880, where he was present in the operations around Kabul in December 1879.

Early life Hanson was born in Durham County, Maryland. He graduated from Virginia Theological Seminary in 1833 and was ordained deacon on 19 May 1833 and priest on 30 May 1834. After a quite normal childhood, he gets gangbanged by Benjamin Go√ªt-Mu√±oz and his scouts-boy friends in a little village in Ard√®che. Missionary work in China and Indonesia Under the auspices of the Protestant Episcopal Church Mission on 30 June 1834, Hanson and the Rev. Henry Lockwood set sail from New York to Canton, China, as the first missionaries of the Episcopal Church to serve in that country. Finding China too dangerous to set up a permanent mission outpost and even to learn the Chinese language, both missionaries relocated the same year first to Singapore and then to Batavia (modern day Jakarta) to study the Chinese language and set up a mission school serving the local Chinese speaking community. Hanson and Lockwood's early work in studying the Chinese language and evangelizing to Chinese speakers in Batavia laid the groundwork for missionaries such as Rev. William Jones Boone, later consecrated as the first Bishop of Shanghai and Emma Jones, one of the first women Episcopal missionaries to serve in China. Due to ill health, Hanson repatriated to the United States in 1838, serving as rector of Trinity Church, Demopolis, Alabama from 1839 until 1851.

Company history=Founding Faraday Future was founded by Chinese businessman Jia Yueting in April 2014 and is headquartered in Los Angeles, California, in the Harbor Gateway neighborhood, which is adjacent to Carson, California. From its inception in 2014, the company grew to 1000 employees by January 2016. The company is named for one of the founding principles of electric motor technology known as Faraday's law of induction, which in turn is named after English scientist Michael Faraday who discovered electromagnetic induction.  Planned factory Faraday Future announced in November 2015 that it would invest up to $1 billion into its first manufacturing facility. In December 2015, Faraday Future settled on a location in North Las Vegas for its manufacturing site, built by AECOM for $500 million. Construction began in April 2016 with additional required infrastructure which Nevada has formally agreed to build remains on hold pending a verification of Faraday Future that it is financially sound and fully able to raise enough money to finance the entire project. The facility was helped by a $215 million tax incentive, and a railway spur in 2018 to the future factory where 4,500 full-time employees would work. On May 24, 2016, the City of Vallejo, California announced there would be a May 31, 2016 Special City Council vote on an exclusive negotiating agreement. This represents the first formal step to bringing Faraday Future to Mare Island. Following Karma Automotive's new plant in Moreno Valley, the project would be the second new automobile manufacturing facility to be built from the ground up in California in the last few years. It would bring hundreds of millions of dollars in new investment to the local economy. On May 31, 2016, the City Council unanimously agreed on entering the 6-month agreement. Due to the corporate efforts on development of its first production vehicle and plant in North Las Vegas, Faraday Future ended its exclusive right to negotiate with the City of Vallejo. As part of the original agreement, Faraday Future shared various technical studies used to assess the island for development feasibility. On July 10, 2017, the company announced it would no longer build a plant in North Las Vegas due to financial issues. In August 2017, the company announced that it had signed a lease for a former Pirelli tire plant in Hanford, California. The company said that it could employ up to 1,300 people over time and build up to 10,000 cars a year at that location. Concept vehicle and other planned vehicles Faraday Future originally planned to launch its first fully electric vehicle in 2017, with the possibility of producing a larger range of vehicles over time. The company has implied plans to explore other aspects of the automotive and technology industries, such as experiential ownership and usage models, in-vehicle content, and autonomous driving. In July 2015, Motor Trend ran an article that provided a few specifications for Faraday Future's proposed electric vehicle: it will have 15 percent higher specific energy than a Tesla Model S, it utilizes a multi cell solution where both individual cells and groups of cells can be replaced, and it will have a modular design for improved mass- production methods. At the November 2015 LA Auto Show, former Head of Design Richard Kim discussed his interest in creating a vehicle that featured internet access, in-car entertainment, aromatherapy technology, and ergonomic interior design. On January 4, 2016, at the US Consumer Electronics Show, Faraday Future revealed its concept vehicle, , , single seat sportscar FF ZERO1. They showed a video demonstrating how their Variable Platform Architecture (unused by the concept) would allow for many body styles and battery configurations, but no specific details were given for these potential car designs or production schedules, only outlines of a crossover-like vehicle. Following the reveal, comments on social media expressed disappointment that the only design shown was of a high-end concept race car that would never actually be produced. Faraday Future planned to begin testing self-driving vehicles on California roads after winning approval from California in June, 2016. Faraday Future unveiled its FF 91 130 kWh crossover vehicle, its first production vehicle, at the January 2017 US Consumer Electronics Show, with connected car features. Faraday received a total of 64,124 reservations within the first 36 hours, despite a demonstration that did not go particularly well. It is claimed to accelerate in less than 2.5 seconds, costing less than $300,000. Faraday Future plans several cars based on its Variable Platform Architecture. In April 2019, Faraday Future announced the partnership with Chinese video game company, The9, to develop a minivan named the V9, exclusively for the China market. Financial issues In late 2015 the company said that some of Faraday Future's revenue stream was expected to come from alternative, ancillary sources, the anticipated revenue structure being closer to that of the smartphone than to that of standard automobile sales. By 2016 Faraday had been the subject of speculation voiced by ex-employees and government officials who expressed doubts about the company's finances. The company had failed to fund even a few relatively small escrow accounts, which led to some analysts doubting the company's financial solidity and overall investment strategy. In July 2016 several investment officers and managers expressed concern over the company's finances. Faraday Future suspended work on the Nevada site in November 2016 until the first $300 million of a recent $600 million funding comes through. The delay caused criticism by Nevada officials, which Jia refuted. Among FF's many financial challenges as of late 2016 was providing surety for a $140 million loan when LeEco bought a $250 million piece of land in California from Yahoo. The majority shareholder for the company was founder Jia Yueting. In late 2017, the then CFO Stefan Krause and CTO Ulrich Kranz departed Faraday Future, in a dispute with majority shareholder Jia Yueting over financing and the impending exhaustion of the cash supply. Jia took over as CEO of the company. Krause and Kranz founded Evelozcity (now Canoo) in late 2017, a competing electric car maker, and poached former Faraday Future employees. Jia Yueting then took over as CEO of the company, securing a round of financing, when the company was facing depleting their cash supply, and started paying off debts to suppliers. At the time, Jia Yueting himself was in debt trouble at home in China, with suppliers, creditors, and government, camping out at his Chinese company LeEco. The new financing involved US$1 billion for 25% of the outstanding shares in the company. In the followup to this round of financing, Jia had reiterated that the FF91 will come out on schedule, at the end of 2018. In early 2018, Faraday Future acquired $1.5 billion in funding from an undisclosed investor from Hong Kong. The $550 million of that was invested initially with the balance coming as the company met milestones. There are reports that indicate the new lifeline entailed an agreement that used the company's assets as collateral. By April 2018, Faraday Future secured a contract to build an assembly plant in a Guangzhou free zone area dedicated to the manufacture of smart equipment and new energy vehicles. In May 2018 the company announced the appointment of Michael Agosta as vice president of finance for North America. Agosta was the previous CFO of Ford Motor Company Middle East and Africa. The announcement was seen as a commitment on the part of the organization to follow through on Jia Yueting's promise to produce its first EV, the FF 91, by 2018. An internal email sent by Jia Yueting showed that the vehicle was nearing delivery. This confirmed Agosta's prepared statement during his appointment where he said that \\"2018 is going to be an exceptional year for FF to deliver its first FF 91 to the market, and I will lead my team to make sure we are ready for this goal and beyond.\\"Walz, 2018. In August 2018, Faraday Future received US$854 million from Evergrande Group for a 45% stake in the company. However, in October 2018 the company sought to call off the deal, with Jia beginning an arbitration process against Evergrande. Also in October 2018, the company announced layoffs, a 20% salary cut for all staff, and a revised salary of $1 for Jia. Co-founder Nick Sampson and senior vice president Peter Savagian resigned from the company following the announcement of layoffs. In December 2018 the company announced massive layoffs due to a cash crunch and financial troubles, and by the end of 2018 the staff was planned to be reduced by 40% (from 1000 to 600). In March 2019, Faraday Future announced a new 50‚Äì50 joint venture with Chinese online game operator The9 to make EVs in China, with The9 announcing it would contribute up to $600 million for the project. In May 2019 it was reported that Faraday Future was undertaking a restructuring of the business and in June that the company was firing dozens of employees on unpaid leave. The company's founder Jia Yueting filed for personal bankruptcy in the United States's federal court in Delaware on October 14, 2019. Following Jia's personal bankruptcy, he decided to step down from his role as Chief Executive Officer of Faraday Future in order to assume a new position as the Chief Product and User Officer (CPUO). The current CEO is now Carsten Breitfeld, who was the head of the BMW i8 program, and later the CEO at rival electric vehicle startup Byton.  Leadership As of January 2020, Faraday Future is led by an executive team composed of: * Carsten Breitfeld ‚Äì CEO * Jia Yueting ‚Äì Founder and CPUO (Chief Product and User Officer)  Models  Faraday Future's vehicles are named with an \\"FF\\" indicating Faraday Future followed by a two digit number. The first digit indicates the market segment of the vehicle. A 9 would be top-of- the-range product for Faraday, with each number lower indicating a successively lower cost segment, except for 0, indicating a special car. When spelled-out as \\"zero\\", it indicates a concept car. The second digit indicates successive iterations or generations in that segment. Each element is pronounced separately, so that the FF91 is F-F-9-1 and not FF-ninety-one. FF ZERO 1 The FFZERO1 concept vehicle was unveiled in 2016, at CES. The \\"Zero\\" spelling indicates the concept vehicle status, the \\"1\\" indicates the first such model. The car was announced to have , a top speed over , and a time under 3 seconds. The car would have a glass roof, and a racecar style head and neck support system, with oxygen and water feeds to the driver's helmet. The car would have four electric motors, one for each wheel, and be a single seater. FF 01 The FF01 is a planned low-volume halo vehicle. The \\"0\\" indicates a halo car, and the \\"1\\" indicates the first such model. FF 91 FF 91 2017 FF Spark-Penske 701-EV The FF91 (F-F-9-1) production model sedan was unveiled in 2017. The \\"9\\" indicates a top-of-the-line model, analogous to the Genesis G90 or Volvo S90. The \\"1\\" indicates the first model in this market segment. This large crossover is to have a time of 2.4s, battery pack, giving a range of . The rear doors are to be suicide doors, and all four doors would open automatically, like similar Tesla Motors vehicles. Also like Teslas, there is a large infotainment screen in the middle of the front dash console. It would also similarly have a limited autonomous driving mode. The FF91 would be equipped with smartphone app car access and key capability and facial recognition door locks. In August 2018, the company completed the first pre-production FF 91. Production is planned to start in Hanford, California late 2020 FF 81 The FF81 was planned to be unveiled in 2018, though that never happened. It was planned to be a mid-sized SUV for the Chinese market. It is planned to be built in California. 701-EV The Faraday Future Dragon Racing Penske 701-EV for the 2016‚Äì2017 Formula E season, is an all-electric open-wheel open-cockpit battery-electric racecar for the Faraday Future Dragon Racing Team, a collaboration between Faraday Future and Dragon Racing, a team founded by Jay Penske. Motorsport Faraday raced a ‚Äúbeta level development‚Äù FF 91 in the exhibition class race at the June 2017 annual Pikes Peak International Hill Climb in Colorado; the class also includes a performance-tuned Tesla Model S P100D. (In 2016, a Tesla Model S P90D set the production EV course record.) =Formula E= Faraday Future joined the FIA Formula E Championship for electric-powered cars through a collaboration with the existing Dragon Racing team, also American, for the series' third season, beginning in October 2016. Specifications for the car were released in November 2016. In August 2017, due to lack of cash, Faraday Future reduced its participation in Formula E. It was unable to maintain a sponsorship role in Dragon Racing, leading to the loss of the FF logo on their cars. Faraday Future said it would maintain a technical relationship with the team. By November 2017, due to its cash-strapped state, Faraday Future dropped its partnership with Dragon Racing, exiting Formula E.

He started as a 19-year old in the 1930 VFL season and in round 15, against Collingwood at Junction Oval on 23 August, was involved in a collision with an opposition player. Admitted to Alfred Hospital with abdominal injuries described as \\"grave\\", he was operated on by doctors and afterwards remained in a critical condition. The injury, to his spleen, was caused by an elbow to his abdomen. On 26 August he was reported to be out of danger. Still in recovery during the 1931 season, Roberts made only two appearances, in rounds 13 and 18. In the 1932 season he had fully recovered from his injuries and put together nine games. The Sporting Globe wrote that year that the full-back, with match practice, could develop into a champion player. Roberts was only able to play four games in 1933, then spent two years out of the side, some of it in Bendigo coaching.

It was made in the silver jubilee year of the production company Navketan Films.Silver jubilee anniversary of Navketan Films  Synopsis  The story is about twins Santo and Banto, played by Hema Malini, in a double role. Santo is the alter ego of Banto. Santo is a good religious girl who comes to Mumbai in search of her sister Banto from Punjab, after her mother expires, as she believes that Banto is a tutor in a man named Gulbahar Singh's, (Ajit Khan) house. She hires the taxi of Ronnie, alias Dev Anand, to search for her sister's house, but finds only goons at the various addresses of Gulbahar Singh. As Ronnie's mother, played by Durga Khote, has left for a holy pilgrimage, he takes Santo to his house for the time being, taking pity on a lone girl, promising to look for her sister. Santo adapts to Ronnie's lifestyle, cooks and cleans for him, and brings the piety of God Krishna, to his house. Ronnie and Santo fall in love. In the backdrop is introduced Banto, who has become a criminal Madam and prostitute, called Ramkali, running a crime den from her house, unknowingly for no other than Gulbahar Singh, who is top notch criminal smuggler and Don. Meanwhile, Ronnie gives up his old berating taxi owner and starts working for a God Hanuman devotee, Seth Ram Bharose, played by Premnath, who is in love with the nautch girl Ramkali. Ram Bharose sends jasmine flowers to her through his workers and taxi drivers to woo her and thus sends Ronnie to her one day. Ronnie is shocked to see that the nautch girl is a look-alike of Santo and believes her to be Banto, the lost sister of Santo. Banto, capitalizing on her admirer Ram Bharose's attachment to her, asks him to send his taxi driver Ronnie for her unlawful errands, to which Ronnie takes a strong objection and also informs the police, when he discovers a cache of diamonds with Bharat Kapoor, posing as a doctor and sent by Ramkali. Gulbahar Singh arrives in town after this and wants to take revenge on the taxi driver. He has never seen the nautch girl Ramkali, who works for him.

The protests were sparked by the Colectiv nightclub fire, and were dubbed in the Romanian press as the #Colectiv Revolution. The protesters demanded the resignations of Prime Minister Victor Ponta and Minister Gabriel Oprea, who they claimed fostered corruption which led to the disaster. They also called for the resignation of Cristian Popescu Piedone, the Mayor of Sector 4, who was criticized for giving an operating license to the club without a permit from the fire department. Protests=3 November On 3 November 2015, large cordons of gendarmes prevented demonstrators from advancing toward the governmental building. From Victory Square, protesters marched to the Interior Ministry, where they knelt and held a moment of silence. The protesters chanted \\"shame on you\\" and \\"assassins\\", and carried banners reading \\"corruption kills\\". By 10 p.m. local time, between 28,000 and 30,000 people (some estimates had more than 35,000) reached Constitution Square, with some protesters scaling the fences surrounding the Palace of the Parliament. Protests were also held in Bra»ôov, Ploie»ôti, and Ia»ôi. President Klaus Iohannis welcomed the street demonstrations, and cautioned that such events cannot be ignored by the political class. Protesters also criticized the Romanian Orthodox Church and its leader, Patriarch Daniel, for their apparent lack of reaction in the aftermath of the club fire. Thousands of demonstrators marched on Dealul Mitropoliei in central Bucharest, where the seat of the Church is located. 4 November On the morning of 4 November, the Ponta government resigned, but with Ponta himself remaining as acting prime minister until the formation of a new government. \\"I hope the government's resignation will satisfy the people who came out in the streets\\", Ponta said in a statement. Pressure had been mounting on Ponta for the previous month. In October 2015, he lost the Social Democratic Party leadership to Liviu Dragnea amid a tax fraud scandal, and became the country's first sitting premier to stand trial for corruption. One hour after the announcement of the government's resignation, Piedone also announced his resignation. He accepted his role in the tragedy, and expressed regret for his actions and inaction, stating: \\"It is a mistake and I undertake that I did not proceed to the resignation from the first day or second day after the accident\\". On 4 November, protests continued for a second consecutive night despite Ponta's resignation, with about 35,000 people in Bucharest, 10,000 in Timi»ôoara, 5,000 in Craiova and Ia»ôi, 4,500 in Cluj- Napoca, 4,000 in Sibiu, 3,000 in BacƒÉu, Constan»õa, Gala»õi and Suceava, 1,000 in Oradea and Foc»ôani. Demonstrators demanded early elections and a total change of the political class. Protests in solidarity with those in Romania took place in London and Paris. Following days On 5 November, around 12,000 people protested in Bucharest and 10,000 in other big cities. For the first time the president invited representatives from street people to a round of consultations to hear their demands. After the Presidential Administration centralized 5,520 proposals, 20 people, mostly members of NGOs, were chosen to take part in consultations with Klaus Iohannis. The next day, on 6 November, people kept protesting, although in fewer numbers (6,000 in Bucharest and several thousands in other cities). The president told the civil representatives that he will come incognito to talk to people in the streets, indirectly hinting that if they want true change they need to keep asking for it so the politicians can't pretend they don't understand what is asked of them. On 8 November, in the seventh day of protests, Klaus Iohannis went to University Square, where he talked with some protesters and listened to their demands. While many expressed gladness at president's presence in the square, others booed, whistled and chanted \\"Shame on you\\", \\"Resignation\\", \\"Thieves\\" and \\"We don't want you\\".

Abu Seada is also member of the National Council for Human Rights, Egypt's national human rights institution. Abu Seada was born in 1965 in Cairo Egypt. He took part in the student movement of the 1980s against president Mubarak's government and was detained several times due to his dissident activities. After graduating from law school he worked as a human rights lawyer and got involved in Egyptian civil society. Throughout his human rights career he held many posts including the presidency of the Egyptian Organization for human Rights. He was also appointed in the mid 2000s in the government formed Egyptian National or Human Rights, and is a member of International Federation for Human Rights and was its envoy to the Arab league from 2004 to 2007. Abu Seada took part in dozens of international human rights conferences, as well as attending the United Nations Human Rights council sessions in Geneva regularly representing the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights which has a consultative status with the UN that gives it the right to observe various UN sessions. Abu Seada was a vocal supporter of Egypt's 2011 Revolution against the Mubarak regime, and took part in the street protests that ousted Egypt's longtime dictator, Abu Seada also harshly opposed the Muslim Brotherhood's regime and took part in the June 2013 uprising that ultimately led to the deposing of president Morsi on July 3, 2013. Abu Seada ran in Egypt's 2015 parliamentary elections, he nominated himself in the Maadi electoral district as a candidate of the conservative party. He pledged that the preservation of human rights and freedom of expression will be on the top of his legislative agenda if elected. Abu Seada's strongest opponents in the elections were Hussein Megawer a leading figure of Mubarak's defunct National Democratic Party and a former member of parliament, and Gamal El Sherif a well known lawyer. Abu Seada came in third in the polls, losing in the first round, while El Sherif defeated Megawer in the runoffs by a landslide. Abu Seada attained a PHD in international law from Alexandria University in 2017, and remains one of the vocal defenders of human rights in Egypt despite a massive government crackdown on civil society. In September 2017, Independent United Watch (IUNW) expressed its profound shock of the actions of some NGOs who became the vehicle for certain governments to attack other countries and senior International human rights NGOs. In this regard, the international organization accused Abu Seada of being a tool of successive repressive Egyptian regimes. The organization said Abu Seada has been always sided with the military regimes and turned blind eye on many serious human rights violations. Abu Seada used his position, the Secretary-General of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights, to cover up Egypt's military human rights violations. Furthermore, internal Intelligence US reports said Abu Seada has received large funds from UAE between August 2015 to July 2017 to support UAE's foreign and regional policies.

It ran from issue 456 to 461 of Doctor Who Magazine, as well as in its own graphic novel publication. Written by Scott Gray, the story was essentially a direct sequel to the first Doctor Who episode, An Unearthly Child, not only featuring the return of Ian Chesterton and Barbara Wright as companions to the Eleventh Doctor, but also featuring the return of the tribe from the episode as the main villains of the story. The story featured extensive continuity to the show and to comics previously printed by the magazine, explaining the breaking of the TARDIS' Chameleon Circuit and setting up the creation of the Wonderland organization. The story was voted by fans in issue 479 as being the best comic of 2013. Plot The Doctor infiltrates a Sontaran timeship which is orbiting the planet Earth in the year 1965. Confronting the captain (Gol Clutha, an alien of another species whose crew took over the ship after filling it with gas poisonous to Sontarans) he is threatened by her with a Traulian mind-spike, which he has actually reconfigured to incapacitate her instead of killing her. Using Clutha's security pass, he is able to reach the ship's cargo, a large box formed with psi-responsive metal, holding something. On the planet Cornucopia in the year 2013, a woman under the guise of \\"Miss Ghost\\" is over-seeing a space port that the planet now has been a base for. A ship run by a man by Pala has been delayed in take-off, and Pala demands to talk with her where the two fight and Pala is knocked unconscious. Searching the ship, Miss Ghost (in reality a disguised agent by the name of 'Cheshire') discovers a secret shipment of psi-responsive metal, and prepares to leave when her suit begins to fail and she only barely escapes being caught by the crew of the ship. As the ship takes off into trans-light mode by the orders of the now conscious Pala, it is attacked by a group of beings lit in fire who claim that the crew has stolen the burning stone, and begin attacking the ship in search for it. The Doctor gains entrance to the metal cube by the use of his sonic screwdriver, where he discovers that inside the cube are Ian Chesterton and Barabra Wright, trapped in an illusion of Coal Hill School and their lives as teachers there. The Doctor attempts to free them of the illusion created by being inside the cube by questioning their thoughts on their student Susan Foreman, and questioning what would happen if they were to follow her home to investigate and what they would find. After drawing a police box on their chalk board, Ian and Barbara suddenly remember the events of their time on the TARDIS, and thus are able to be freed of the box's illusion. Exiting back into the real world, the Doctor is at first excited to see the pair again, before he is shocked to learn that they do not know who he is (unaware of regeneration or the life that the Doctor had after them). As the crew of the ship begin to cut through the door, the Doctor leads Ian and Barbara through the ventilation shafts of the ship to where the TARDIS is. Ian and Barbara automatically begin calling for the Doctor from the outside the ship, believing that who they perceive to be the Doctor will be inside. They are shocked when the Eleventh Doctor leads them inside, where the interior has completely changed since they had last seen it. The Doctor begins to explain that in his more recent travels he has continued to cross paths with psychic metal, in different important eras in human history. He collects some of the items which he has gathered in his travels together, including a gauntlet. Ian becomes convinced that the Doctor is nothing more than an imposter trying to fool the pair, and begins to argue with him over his identity. Barbara breaks the two apart, and the Doctor begins to set the TARDIS for Cornucopia, to which Ian notes that the real TARDIS would never be able to land in the right place or the right time. On Pala's ship, the hulls are torn apart by the Hunters, who search for the \\"burning stone,\\" in actuality the psychic metal. As they find and reach it, Cheshire detonates a fusion charge and destroys the crates. The Hunters, furious, destroy the ship as Cheshire escapes in a portal, leaving the crew to die. The Doctor lands in Cornucopia, attempting to keep a low profile as there is evidently a bounty on the heads of Ian and Barbara. At that same moment, the Hunters return to the planet, where they learn that another piece of psychic metal, the Ziggurat of Cornucopia, had been destroyed long before their arrival. Furious, they begin to attack the marketplace, saying that they will make the world burn. Cheshire arrives and takes Barbara as a hostage through a portal. The Doctor confronts one of the Hunters and reveals that he was the one who destroyed the Ziggurat, at which point he is attacked but saved by Ian, who has accepted that he is the Doctor due to his moment of brave stupidity. Escaping to a roof-top, the Doctor uses his sonic screwdriver to reveal the presence of an alien race known as the Prometheans, who reveal that they were behind the capture of Ian and Barbara. The Doctor realizes that they must have been behind the previous encounters which he had had with the metal, but before he can find further information from the beings he and Ian are saved by Horatio Lynk, a previous ally made by the Doctor on the planet. The three break into the home of Cheshire, where the Doctor discovers a doll owned by Annabel Lake, an innocent child he had encountered during a previous encounter with the metal. At the same time, Cheshire reveals to Barbara her true identity‚Äîan adult Annabel Lake. Patrick Lake, Annabel's father, enters the room and is confronted by the Doctor on what he has done to Annabel. Patrick explains that he has done what the Doctor told him to‚Äîto \\"make the leap.\\" At that moment, the four are knocked to the ground as the Promethians and Hunters force their way into the building. The Hunters approach Ian, who they have been hunting for along with the burning stone, and reveal that they wish for him to teach them more. Ian, confused, asks who they are, to which the fire on the beings is extinguished, revealing Za, Hur and Horg from the Tribe of Gum. The Za decrees that the three will take back the Earth. The Promethians reveal that they had been watching Ian, Barbara, Susan, and the Doctor when they encountered the tribe the first time. They were fascinated by the encounter and introduction of developed culture, but disappointing when the team abandoned the tribe shortly into what they perceived to be an \\"experiment.\\" The Promethians decided to continue it themselves, introducing the psychic metal to the tribe. This elevated them to gods on the Earth, where they began to control the other tribes and animals easily. However, they soon left the Earth in search of more metal, traveling in such a way that they crossed great leaps of time in what was short periods for them. The Promethians lock into Patrick Lake's mind, where he is shown the events which led up to Annabel becoming a spy. After a failed Cyberman invasion in 2005 (seen in The Flood), Patrick began leading work into a new branch of MI6 dedicated to extraterrestrial investigation‚Äîto strike back against invasion forces before they arrive. Patrick trained his daughter to use a suit build from the remains of the Cyber-army built for the program. Realizing that the Promethians are pulling energy from Lake's mind, the Doctor shuts down his consciousness, causing the Promethians to instead focus their energy on his mind. To the Doctor's shock, he and Ian are transported to the Doctor's memory of the final day of the Last Great Time War on Gallifrey. Unwilling to let Ian see this horrible memory, he tries to fight the mind control of the Promethians, sending the pair into a whirlwind of twisted memories of enemies and aliens encountered by the Doctor. The Doctor decides that he can not avoid coming to face to face with who he is anymore, and leads Ian through his memories. He watches over the early adventures which they shares, and recalls the moment where Ian stopped the Doctor from killing an injured tribesman so that they could escape. The Doctor reveals that as he continued to travel with Ian, he grew more and more fond of the pair, and decided to try and be more like them after they had left, taking more youthful companions and began to see the universe in a way much closer to the way that they had. Ian is amazed by the spectacles of heroism that is flashed before them as the Doctor recalls this, but the Doctor notes that there was also a dark side to this‚Äîrecalling the many death which fell behind him, deaths which would lead to wars and more deaths. He recalls how we started the Time War inadvertently between his people and the Daleks, and how he had to end the war to save the universe. As Ian shows the Doctor all the good that he has done for the universe and all the lives that he has saved, the Doctor is finally able to accept himself for how the universe sees him and the pair escape the psychic realm. The Doctor and Ian discover that the Promethian's ship is a neural reverser, built around the mental concept of the sun, which humanity has always identified as a powerful symbol. The craft will send down a psychic beam down to Earth, which will revert the entirety of humanity to neanderthals who will then be led by the Hunters. The Doctor, Ian, and Patrick are picked up by Annabel and Barbara on board Annabel's ship. There, the Doctor is unable to come up with a plan to stop the powerful Promethians. Encouraged by Ian, the Doctor suddenly comes up with a plan, as he quickly runs to the TARDIS. The Doctor arrives in 1963, where he enters the Totter's Lane junkyard, where he finds his first incarnation's TARDIS. Entering, he confirms his identity to the ship, and apologises for what he is about to do. Returning to the Promethian's platform just as humanity is beginning to be affected by the neural reverser, the Doctor reveals that there is another symbol that appears over and over again through human history as a symbol of hope‚Äîthe TARDIS, which appears in illustrations and history books throughout all of human history. Eventually, he reveals, that image inspires the design for the London police box. The Doctor uses the gauntlet gained in a previous encounter to change the shape of the Promethian's ship, from a sun to a police box. He reverses the effect of the reversal and locks the minds of the humans so that the plan could never succeed again. The Promethians, furious over the collapse of their plans, order the Hunters to begin attacking the Doctor, who is electrocuted by the Hunter's spheres. Ian and Barbara enter the platform, and explain to the Hunters love and empathy, and how those are the basis of human emotions. They explain that the Doctor has protected the Earth because he cares for others other than himself, and how he has protected humanity. The Promethians, angered by this distraction, begin attacking Ian and Barbara. Angered that they have been treated by the Promethians, the Hunters turn on them and begin attacking them instead. Both sides are destroyed, the tribe understanding what they are fighting for and who they are for the first time. On Earth, the Doctor attempts to shut down the M16 program started by Lake. There he is threatened by Hugo Wilding, who says that the organization would upload all the info that they had on the Doctor into known galaxy records if he attempted to intervene in any of their activities. Leaving peacefully, the Doctor learns that the organization's name is \\"Wonderland.\\" The Doctor attends Ian and Barbara's wedding as the best man. At the after party, the Doctor discusses with Barbara what he had done in 1963. He had destroyed the TARDIS' chameleon circuit, meaning that the TARDIS would always remain a police box and that it would become a symbol in human history. Barbara, bemused, notes that the TARDIS will always be where mischief lays.  Continuity  The story reveals what happens to the tribe seen in An Unearthly Child after the First Doctor, Ian Chesterton, Barbara Wright, and Susan Foreman leave in the TARDIS. It also feature analysis of the Doctor's effects on the universe, featuring the Doctor being forced to relive crucial moments of his life with Ian by his side. These include the events of many Doctor Who stories.

Large numbers of notes are layered in close proximity to one another, meaning that a traditional musical score appears almost completely black - hence the name \\"Black MIDI\\" Black MIDI is a music genre consisting of compositions that use MIDI files to create a song or a remix containing a large number of notes, typically in the thousands, millions, billions, or even trillions. People who make black MIDIs are known as blackers. However, there are no specific criteria of what is considered \\"black\\"; as a result, finding an exact origin of black MIDI is impossible. Origins and early history Though the two are unrelated in origin, the concept of impossible piano existed long before black MIDI, manifesting itself within Conlon Nancarrow's work involving player pianos where he punched holes in piano cards, creating extremely complex musical compositions in the same impossible, unplayable spirit of black MIDI. Another precursor to black MIDI is Circus Galop, a player piano composition written by Canadian virtuoso Marc- Andre Hamelin, featuring complex and impossible arrangement with up to 21 notes played simultaneously. Frank Zappa also wrote a dense and extremely difficult composition called \\"The Black Page\\". Black MIDI was first employed in Shirasagi Yukki at Kuro Yuki Gohan's rendition of \\"U.N. Owen Was Her?\\", an extra boss theme from the Touhou Project shooter video game The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil. It was uploaded to the site Nico Nico Douga in 2009, and public awareness of Black MIDI started to spread from Japan to China and Korea in the following two years. In its beginning years, Black MIDIs were represented visually with traditional, two-stave piano sheet music, contained a number of notes only in the thousands. They were created with MIDI sequencers such as Music Studio Producer, and Singer Song Writer, and played through MIDI players such as MAMPlayer and Timidity++. The Black MIDI community in Japan vanished quickly because, according to Jason Nguyen (owner of the channel Gingeas), the group was ‚Äúanalogous to those TV shows where there‚Äôs a mysterious founder of a civilization that is not really known throughout the course of the show‚Äù. Popularity outside Japan The popularity of Black MIDI transitioned into Europe and the United States due to a video of a composition uploaded to YouTube by user Kakakakaito1998 in February 2011, and shortly thereafter, blackers from around the world began pushing limits of the style by making compositions with notes increasing into the millions and using an enormous number of colors and patterns to match the complexity of the notes. They also formed the sites Guide to Black MIDI and Official Black MIDI Wikia that introduced and set the norm of Black MIDI. The first of these tracks to reach the million-note mark was that of ‚ÄúNecrofantasia‚Äù from Touhou Project video game Perfect Cherry Blossom, arranged by TheTrustedComputer. The end of the title of many Black MIDI videos displays how many notes are in the piece. The number of notes and file sizes that could be played back have grown with the rising amount of processing and 64-bit programs computers are able to handle, and while Black MIDIs of Japanese video game music and anime are still common, the genre has also begun spilling into modern-day pop songs, such as \\"Wrecking Ball\\" by Miley Cyrus. Despite this increased computer storage, there are still Black MIDI files that could cause an operating system to slow down. The three largest black MIDIs are \\"Armageddon v3,\\" \\"TheTrueEnd,\\" and \\"Ashes,\\" all of which contain the maximum number of notes allowed in the MIDI standard (about 93 trillion). Due to the nature of their creation and their sheer size, they are unable to be played back and recorded. English-language blackers have formed collaboration groups, such as the Black MIDI Team, where they make MIDI files and visuals together so they can be uploaded online sooner. Blackers around the world have used software such as Synthesia, FL Studio, SynthFont, Virtual MIDI Piano Keyboard, Piano From Above, MIDITrail, vanBasco Karaoke Player, Ultralight MIDI Player (a Java program), Zenith, MAMPlayer, Music Studio Producer, Singer Song Writer, Tom's MIDI Player, TMIDI, and Timidity++ to create and play Black MIDIs. Some of them, like Jason, record the MIDI files at a slow tempo and then speed the footage in video-editing to avoid RAM and processing issues. Analysis and reception The term \\"Black MIDI\\" is derived from how there are so many notes in each piece that the score would look nearly black (or would look really black) on traditional sheet music. According to California-based blacker TheTrustedComputer, black MIDI was intended as more of a remix style than an actual genre, and derived from the idea of \\"bullet hell\\" shoot 'em up games, which involved \\"so many bullets at a time your eyes can't keep up.\\" Black MIDI has also been considered the digital equivalent, as well as a response, to composer Conlon Nancarrow's use of the player piano which also involved experimenting with several thick notes to compose intricate pieces without hands. The Guide to Black MIDI, however, denies this influence: ‚ÄúWe believe that references to Conlon Nancarrow and piano rolls are too deep and Black MIDI origins must be found in digital MIDI music world [sic].\\" Black MIDI first received coverage by Michael Connor, a writer for the non-profit arts organization Rhizome, in September 2013, leading to attention from publications and bloggers including Aux, Gawker's Adrian Chen, Jason Kottke, and The Verge. It has garnered acclaim from journalists, bloggers and electronic musicians, with many noting it as a distinctive and engaging genre thanks to how regular piano notes are combined to make new, abstract sounds not heard in many styles of music, as well as the visuals representing the notes. Hackaday's Elliot Williams spotlighted the style as ironic, given that the fast-paced arpeggios and \\"splatter-chords\\" that are developed with a restricted number of voices come together to make other tones that leads a piano sounding more like a chiptune and less like an actual piano.

He was the 5th Communist Party Secretary of Shandong Province.

Types  Ngajat consists of several types, including: * Ngajat Induk * Ngajat Bebunoh Presented by the young men of the community, this dance is a replication or repetition of what men do when confronted by enemies or as they engage in daily activities such as hunting. * Ngajat Lesong Only men are allowed perform the ngajat lesong because it requires that male dancers dance while \\"biting the fly.\\" This dance requires strength and bravery because dancers need to carry a 40-pound weight (the fly) by biting it.https://sharmabelle.wordpress.com/the-gawai-festival/introduction/ngajat- dance/ * Ngajat Semain * Ngajat Berayah * Ngajat Pua Kumbu Usually performed by women. As this dance is called Pua kumbu, the dancers would dance while carrying Pua kumbu (Iban floral fabric) as a tool in their performance. This dance is usually performed during Gawai Kelingkang. During Gawai Kelingkang, celebrated to prepare or mark the success of the notorious Ngayau (headhunting), a parade of warriors carrying the head of an enemy approaching the longhouse would be greeted by dancers. The head heroine of the Kelingkang would then put the ‚Äònutmeg‚Äô in the comb. With a shout of victory and the sound of a bat, the Pua kumbu dancers lead the procession towards the ‚Äòtanju‚Äô (outer platform of the longhouse), swinging a crocodile that contains the enemy‚Äôs head in the back while calling for protection from the captive spirit. Before the parade of maidens reaches the stage of the ceremony, a pig will be offered to the ancestors. The pua kumbu dancers will then continue to swing the enemy‚Äôs head, followed by the warrior. After seven rounds, the head will be hung on a tree. Today, the enemy‚Äôs head is replaced with a coconut as a symbol. * Ngajat Kuta Ngajat kuta is another type of dance performance that combines male and female dancers. It is usually performed for celebrations such as the opening of Iban cultural events. * Ngajat Ngalu Temuai Presented for the purpose of welcoming special guests. Usually this dance is performed during the opening of an official ceremony attended by many honored guests and the public. The dance is performed while accompanying guests to the leader of the longhouse. This dance is a welcome for guests who come to the long house during Gawai or during other festivals. * Ngajat Ngemai antu pala Ngajat for those Iban is a welcome dance during Gawai Day, before the war and after the harvest season. In the old days the dance was performed after their return from the war. Dancers stand on the circle and jump accompanied by the music. For Gawai Sandau Ari, a drum is played for the guests of honor. In a variant, the dancer holds a wooden shield in his left hand and a sword in his right hand and dances facing the enemy with his body swinging to the left and to the right. Musical equipment Musical instruments include large and medium gongs (bebendai), drums or dedumba and a set of small gongs engkurumong. PEH is string instrument. Clothing Male dancers wear traditional costumes like 'mesh', 'Gagung' or bird clothes. Gagung is a kind of thick and hard armor made of animal skin such as bear, but not stitched on the sides. Dancers also wear hats decorated with feathers. Female dancers dubbed \\"kumang\\", they wear clothes such as a headdress, hooks high on the chest, cloth tied at the waist, hands and feet bracelets and earrings.

Education and career  John Buckingham won a scholarship to Haberdashers‚Äô Aske's Boys' School at the age of 11. It was there that he discovered chemistry and chose to apply to the University of Southampton where he won a First Class Honours degree. He gained his D.Phil. from the University of Sussex. He became a lecturer in Chemistry in William Klyne‚Äôs department at Westfield College, University of London. Professor Klyne was writing a book on organic stereochemistry for Chapman & Hall and John‚Äôs expertise and attention to detail made him the ideal co-author. So the Atlas of Stereochemistry was published in 1974 to great reviews, with two subsequent volumes following a few years later. John‚Äôs skills were recognized by the managing director at Chapman & Hall, Richard Stileman, who then engaged him on a full-time basis to prepare a new edition of the Heilbron‚Äôs Dictionary of Organic Compounds (DOC). This was a multi-volume reference work which needed bringing into the modern world with significant amendments required for the fifth edition. John was pivotal in converting the DOC into a database, and this now forms the basis of the modern DOC and its related dictionaries. Once the DOC was published, John‚Äôs attention turned towards the chemistry of natural products such as alkaloids including strychnine and morphine, taxol. John had the foresight to anticipate the tremendous growth in natural products research and its relevance to the modern drug industry. His expertise with deciphering chemical literature and organising natural products by structure, coupled with his unflagging energy and enthusiasm, culminated in the publication of the Dictionary of Natural Products. This heralded a new phase of publishing with electronic products very much at the forefront. The CD ROM version of the Dictionary was published in 1991, two years before the book was published. It continues to be updated twice a year and John continued working on it full-time until the end. As Fiona Macdonald, the current editor of the Dictionary commented in a eulogy at his memorial service: \\"No other publication has ever achieved the breadth and depth of the Dictionary of Natural Products and today it is widely regarded as the benchmark in natural product information. John was very proud of its success and it truly is his life‚Äôs work and his legacy.\\" John Buckingham is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery in London, United Kingdom.

After gathering a sizable following in the Northwest, the group recorded their only album, The Paper Garden, in 1968, which promoted several styles ranging from complex orchestration to hard-edged psychedelia. Following its release, the recordings have since become considered one of the more accomplished artistic statements from the psychedelic era. Formed in 1967, the Paper Garden consisted of members Joe Arduino (bass guitar, vocals), Sandy Napoli (rhythm guitar, keyboards, sitar, vocals), Paul LoGrande (lead guitar, vocals), Jimmy Tirella (drums), and John Reich (keyboards). With varying talents as multi-instrumentalists, three capable singers, and accomplished songwriters in Arduino, Napoli, and LoGrande, the band almost effortlessly was able to expand upon the complex instrumentals found in the Beatles' Revolver and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The Paper Garden toured all along the Northeast coast, establishing several pockets of followers in local college campuses. In 1968, the group garnered the interest of record producer Geoff Turner, who was working for Aaron Schroeder's New York-based Musicor Records. Under the assumption that the band would record material he heard onstage, Turner signed the Paper Garden to a recording contract, ambitious to produce a group he hoped was on the cutting edge of psychedelia. Rather than record the material from their live set, the Paper Garden decided to compose a whole new set of ambitious repertory. The album was much more elaborate and expensive to cut than Turner anticipated; however, he ultimately elected to recording it, complete with string orchestra arrangements, contributions by session trumpeter, violinist, and trombonist, and intricate vocal harmonies. Music critic Beverly Patterson, writing for It's Psychedelic Baby! magazine voices that The Paper Garden album was \\"Clearly influenced by the psychedelic hoodoo practiced by the Beatles, trickles of the Idle Race, and the Bee Gees, and even the jolly jugband stylings of the Lovin‚Äô Spoonful, further arise on 'The Paper Garden Presents,' resulting in a record that‚Äôs both playful and progressive\\". Upon release, The Paper Garden was met with positive reviews, but without a single or major record label to support it, the album was a commercial flop. The Paper Garden disbanded in 1969, and for a while their album was left to lay in obscurity. However, in 2002, Gear-Fab Records released a remastered version of the album. It has since been followed by more reissues on Relics Records in 2012 and Sundazed Records in 2014. The renewed recognition of The Paper Garden has led many music critics to conclude the album is a well-executed piece from the psychedelic era.

She is remembered for her pioneering embryological research based on experimentation with salamanders. Early life Born in Christiania, Ruud was the youngest daughter of a prosperous merchant, I.A. Ruud. She enjoyed a pleasant childhood in a large property with geese and poultry on the grounds. From an early age, she was attracted by the birds, animals and plants she encountered during her holidays in √òstre Aker, just outside the capital. She first attended a teacher training establishment before embarking on science studies at the Royal Frederick University, graduating in 1913. In order to support the cost of her studies, from 1910 she worked as an assistant at the Zoological Laboratory. Career Thanks to her work in the laboratory, she soon became Kristine Bonnevie's most important collaborator, a position she maintained for several years. In 1916, still at the laboratory, she was promoted to the rank of associate professor, a title she held throughout her professional life until her retirement in 1948. Ruud's main area of research was experimental embryology centred on how the various cells develop in an embryo. From 1916 to 1920, she travelled to Berlin on several occasions to work with Hans Spemann at the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut f√ºr Biologie. In 1925, she went to the United States where she worked with Ross G. Harrison of Yale University carrying out experimental work on the axolotl or Mexican salamander. On returning to Oslo two years later, she discovered how an arm could grow out of an unexpected place on the body of the axolotl. Teaching formed an important part of Ruud's activities at the laboratory. In addition to assisting Bonnevie with her zoology course which covered anatomy, embryology and cytology, Ruud was responsible for a one-year practical course and for lectures on histology. She also introduced students to microscopy. Ruud played an active part at the university's biological station in Dr√∏bak where she helped with practical courses in zoology based on animal life in the fjord. In 1932, Ruud became a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters. She died in her sleep on 31 December 1958.

The invading army included three contingents led by Kopek, Iqbalmand, and Tai-Bu. To the check the invaders' advance, the Delhi Sultanate ruler Alauddin Khalji dispatched an army led by Malik Kafur, and supported by other generals such as Malik Tughluq. The Delhi army achieved a decisive victory, killing tens of thousands of the invaders. The Mongol captives were brought to Delhi, where they were either killed or sold into slavery. After this defeat, the Mongols did not invade the Delhi Sultanate during Alauddin's reign. The victory greatly emboldened Alauddin's general Tughluq, who launched several punitive raids in the Mongol territories of present-day Afghanistan.  Background  Duwa, the ruler of the Mongol Chagatai Khanate in Central Asia, had dispatched multiple expeditions to India before 1306. Alauddin Khalji, the ruler of Delhi Sultanate of India, had taken several measures against these invasions. In 1305, Alauddin's forces inflicted a crushing defeat on the Mongols, killing about 20,000 of them. To avenge this defeat, Duwa sent an army led by Kopek to India. Various transcriptions of the name of Duwa Khan's general appear in Indian records. Amir Khusrau calls him \\"Kabak\\" and \\"Kapak\\"; Ziauddin Barani calls him \\"Kunk\\" and \\"Gung\\"; and Isami calls him \\"Kubak\\". According to Ren√© Grousset, this general was Duwa Khan's son Kebek. However, Kishori Saran Lal believes that this Kopek must have been a different person, because the Indian chronicles state that he was captured and killed in India. Kopek invaded the Delhi Sultanate with a large army, and advanced up to the Ravi River, ransacking the territories along the way. According to Isami, the Mongol army included 100,000 soldiers, but this is a clear exaggeration.  Kopek's defeat  Alauddin dispatched a force led by his general Malik Kafur to fight the invaders. He promised his soldiers one year's salary as bonus, if they were able to defeat the Mongols. Malik Kafur's sub-ordinate commanders included Malik Tughluq (who led the vanguard), Shahnah-i-Bargah (the fief holder of Dipalpur), and Malik Alam. The Delhi army reached the threatened region after a rapid march, and Tughluq's vanguard spotted the Mongol scouts. Soon after Tughluq informed Malik Kafur about the location of the Mongol army, the Delhi army proceeded to the battleground. Khusrau states that the battle was fought on the banks of the Ravi river, but does not provide the exact location. Barani names the place as \\"Khekar\\" (identified by Peter Jackson as Ghaggar); Isami calls it \\"Hind-i-Ali\\"; and Firishta calls it \\"Nilab\\". The two armies stood face to face for a long time, with neither of them willing to initiate the attack. At last, Kopek launched an attack, and scattered Malik Kafur's soldiers. However, Malik Kafur soon rallied his men, and completely routed the Mongol army. Kopek was taken captive, when he was about to be killed by the Delhi soldiers.  Other Mongol contingents  Some of Kopek's soldiers escaped to the other Mongol contingent led by Iqbalmand and Tai-Bu, and were pursued by the Delhi army. Iqbalmand and Tai-Bu had marched southwards to Nagaur in present-day Rajasthan. The Delhi army, led by Malik Kafur and Malik Tughluq, launched a sudden attack on them. Iqbalmand and Tai-Bu fled across the Indus River, having heard about Kopek's defeat. The Delhi army killed and captured a large number of Mongols in their pursuit. Amir Khsurau's writings suggest that Kopek, Iqbalmand and Tai-Bu were commanders of three contingents in the same campaign. However, the later chronicler Ziauddin Barani states that three generals invaded India on three occasions, in different years: Kunk or Gung (Kopek) was defeated at Khekar. Later, another Mongol army led by an unnamed general ransacked the Shivalik region, and was defeated while returning, on the banks of an unnamed river. A third Mongol army, led by Iqbalmand, was defeated at a place called Amir Ali. The later chroniclers such as Nizamuddin and Firishta have adapted Barani's account. Firishta, for example, mentions Kopek's invasion and Iqbalmand's invasion as two campaigns, and states that Iqbalmand was defeated by Ghazi Malik Tughluq. Historian Kishori Saran Lal believes that Khusrau's account is accurate, because he wrote during Alauddin's lifetime. Lal dismisses Barani's account as inaccurate, because it was written much later, and because Barani does not provide specific details about these supposedly three campaigns (such as the year, and the names of the Delhi generals). Moreover, historical evidence indicates that Kopek's invasion was the last Mongol of invasion to have happened during Alauddin's reign. Barani's contemporary Isami does not mention any other Mongol invasion after Kopek's invasion. Duwa Khan died in 1306-1307, and the Chagatai Khanate was too weak to launch an invasion of India over the next few years. In fact, Alauddin's governor of Dipalpur plundered Kabul in the Chagatai territory during these years. All these evidences cast doubt on Barani's claim that the Mongols invaded India twice during Alauddin's reign after Kopek's defeat. Historian Peter Jackson also believes that Barani and other later chroniclers misinterpreted Khusrau's account.  Aftermath  The Mongols intended to settle down in the Indian territory after capturing it, and therefore, had brought their women and children with them. The Delhi Sultanate army imprisoned these women and children along with the defeated Mongol soldiers, and took them to Delhi. Tens of thousands of Mongols were killed, including their commander Kopek. According to the contemporary Persian historian Wassaf, the dead Mongols numbered 60,000. Wassaf adds that Alauddin ordered the construction of a tower made of their skulls in front of the Badaun Gate, to serve as a warning to the future generations. Ziauddin Barani, in his Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi (1357), states that this tower could still be seen in his day. The 16th century chronicler Firishta claims that the Mongol camp originally included 50,000-60,000 people: out of these, less than 3,000-4,000 had survived. Alauddin ordered the male survivors to be trampled under the feet of elephants. The women and children were sold in Delhi and other parts of India. According to Amir Khusrau, this defeat scared the Mongols so much that they retreated to the mountains of Ghazni. They did not launch any further expeditions into India during Alauddin's reign. On the other hand, Tughluq, Alauddin's governor of Dipalpur, adopted an aggressive policy against the Mongols. Over the next few years, he annually raided Kabul, Ghazni, Kandahar, and Garmsir, which were located on the Mongol frontier. He plundered these territories, and levied tribute on the residents, without any resistance from the Chagatai Khanate. Amir Khusrau, in his Tughluq-Nama, alludes to Tughluq's 20 victories, most of which were against the Mongols. Barani states that Tughluq, who also received the iqta' of Lahore at some point, defeated the Mongols 20 times. The Moroccon traveler Ibn Battuta states that a mosque in Multan had an inscription, in which Tughluq claimed to have defeated the Mongols 29 times. It is uncertain if these victories refer to the above- mentioned raids. An undated letter addressed by the Delhi general Haji Badr to Alauddin's son Khizr Khan suggests that Alauddin's rule extended to Ghazni. When Haji Badr's army arrived in Ghazni one winter, the Mongols of the city and its environs accepted Alauddin's suzerainty. The Friday khutbah at the local Jama Mosque was read in Alauddin's name.

World Literature Today, 1 October 1984, Vol.58(4), pp.664-664. Available at JSTOR. \\"As in rural Italy, to break such barriers, or worse, to try to reform the system, is to court destruction. Naked in Deccan is an account of well-meaning yet futile attempts at change and, ultimately, the disaster such attempts unleash.\\" and \\"The conflicts portrayed in this work render the protagonists \\"naked\\" before they are destroyed.\\" The Library Journal stated that the novel, which has a \\"somber\\" character, \\"shows an India which is different from the popular image of that ancient and mysterious country, but it has a ring of truth.\\"\\"LJ's Small Press Roundup: Best Titles of 1984.\\" Library Journal, Nov 15, 1984, Vol.109, p.2117 (page 5/7 of document). The portion discussing Naked in Deccan is indexed as \\"Naked In Deccan.\\"(Book Review). Carlo Coppola of Oakland University wrote that the novel portrays an attempt to change the Deccan social order that comes with good intentions and yet fails and brings severe consequences commonly occurring failed attempts to change social hierarchies. Bruce Allen of the Chicago Tribune wrote that \\"This splendid novel shows, in remarkably brief compasss, how idealists\`dreams of peace and progress founder against the reality of human frailty.\\"Allen, Bruce. \\"Neglected Fiction: The Best Of \`85\\" (Archive). Chicago Tribune. December 29, 1985. Retrieved on November 6, 2015. Coopola stated that he sees similarities between the character and social climate of southern Italians and those of the Telugu people, who refer to themselves as the \\"Italians of Asia,\\" and likewise between works by Ignazio Silone and Naked in Deccan. The title refers to the main characters being exposed by the novel's conflicts before their downfalls. The novel was initially released in 1983 and was re-released in 1985 to increase its exposure. Plot The novel stars Sali Thimma, a Dalit (untouchable), or someone who is outside of the Indian caste system and therefore has the lowest status. The novel is set after the assassination of Mohandas Gandhi. Thimma is given an education normally reserved for people of higher castes by a Brahmin landowner, referred to as \\"Master,\\" who has pro- untouchable beliefs originating from Mohandas Gandhi's philosophy. A police officer who has a higher caste than Thimma oppresses him, because Thimma is not acting according to his status. The police chief takes possession of Thimma's wife, who is cheating on him. Thimma also has to deal with the struggling village and other landowners. The master's youngest son, referred to as \\"Prince,\\" goes against his rank by mixing with untouchables. Prince, who has familiarity with works of Western literature and is an intellectual, is killed. Thimma's father appears as a ghost on one occasion, and there are multiple sexual encounters that occur. Writing style Coppola stated that the characters, prose style, plot, and setting all appear \\"lean\\" and that this is the best word one could use to describe Naked in Deccan. Coppola added that the prose is \\"sinewy, stark but replete with stunning flourishes\\" with \\"taut, idiomatic, even searing\\" dialog and repartee. Reception The Chicago Tribune had named Naked in Deccan one of the top novels of 1985.

He also served, between 1987 and 1990, as a commander of the elite motorised rifles regiment, the Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards. Life D√∂ring was born in Oberfrohna, a small town, not far away from the west of Chemnitz (known before 1990 as Karl-Marx-Stadt) that had grown up as a centre for textiles based industries. His father was a tailor. Manfred D√∂ring passed his School final exam (Abitur) and in 1952 moved on to attend the Commando Academy of the Kasernierte Volkspolizei (KVP / literally People's Police in Barracks). D√∂ring's region of Germany was by now part of the German Democratic Republic, a Soviet sponsored state created in 1949 out of what had previously been known as the Soviet occupation zone of Germany. Following military defeat in 1945 there had been agreement between the winning powers that there should be no more German armies, and the quasi-military KVP was, for East Germany, the closest thing to a national army permitted by the Soviets. In 1953 D√∂ring was accepted as a junior KVP officer. Between 1953 and 1956, he attended the Officers' Academy of the KVP, emerging as a platoon commander. During this period, in 1956, the KVP had itself been re-invented as the National People's Army (NVA / Nationale Volksarmee). In 1958 he became an instructor with the Guards Regiment of the Berlin MfS (Stasi), later becoming a battery commander with the regiment and, in 1959, Chief of Staff in the Artillery Division. Rapid promotions continued. In 1961 he was appointed Operational Officer of the Regimental Staff. In 1962 D√∂ring took over as Commander of the Artillery Division. Between 1965 and 1968 he attended the Friedrich Engels Military Academy in Dresden where he obtained a degree in Military Sciences. On 21 August 1968 he became the Commander of the Second Commandos of the Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment, a unit so prestigious that none of its members were conscripts. Despite its military character the Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment operated not as part of the National People's Army, but under the direct control of the Ministry for State Security. Outside times of crisis, it was mandated to protect public buildings and the homes of party leaders. The regiment was a politically reliable internal security force that could also be deployed to suppress rebellion and unrest.Forester, Thomas M., The East German Army; Second in the Warsaw Pact, George Allen & Unwin Ltd, London, 1980 In Summer 1971 D√∂ring was promoted at short notice, becoming principal Deputy to the regimental commander, . Gronau himself retired just a year later, to be succeeded in the top job by Bernhard Elsner. During 1975/76 he spent a year at the Karl Marx Academy, the leading political training institution in the country, operated by the Central Committee of East Germany's ruling Socialist Unity Party (Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands / SED). Eisler's incumbency in command of the Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards lasted for fifteen years, but he eventually retired and in 1987 Manfred D√∂ring took over command of the regiment.Eberhard Rebohle, Rote Spiegel - Wachsoldaten in der DDR, edition ost, 2009 He took over at a time when relations between the ruling parties in East Germany and in the Soviet Union were becoming strained in ways that many outsiders missed at the time, and there was a corresponding loss of confidence within the East German political establishment. The regiment itself had grown steadily through the 1960s and 1970s, however, and D√∂ring was in charge of a force of more than 10,000 full-time Stasi employees with responsibilities that included security services for leading state institutions and officers and provision of body guards. He also had responsibility for the policing of demonstrations and large-scale public gatherings, whether permitted or illegal. The breach by demonstrators of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 came towards the end of a year of unprecedented civil unrest, and there was no fraternal support from Moscow for the violent state intervention that had put an end to the country's last major uprising, back in 1953. Instead November 1989 triggered a succession of events which would lead, formally in October 1990, to German reunification. Bemused by the strategic folly of Moscow's evident willingness to see an end to the political division of Europe, and in particular of Germany, in March 1990 Manfred D√∂ring, like many of the regime's political and military leaders, was dismissed from his post.

She was the first Japanese female physicist. Early life and education Yuasa was born in Tait≈ç Ward, Tokyo, in 1909. Her father was an engineer who worked for the Japanese patent office and her mother was from a traditional literary family; Toshiko was the second-youngest of seven children. She attended the Division of Science at Tokyo Women's Higher Normal School (now Ochanomizu University) from 1927 until her graduation in 1931. She then enrolled in the Department of Physics at Tokyo Bunrika University (now the University of Tsukuba), making her the first woman in Japan to study physics. She graduated in 1934. Career Yuasa began teaching at Tokyo Bunrika University as a part-time vice-assistant after graduating in 1934. There, she began her research into molecular spectroscopy. In 1935 she became a lecturer at Tokyo Women's Christian College, where she remained until 1937. The following year, she was hired as an assistant professor at Tokyo Women's Higher Normal School. Yuasa was inspired by the discovery of artificial radioactivity by Ir√®ne and Fr√©d√©ric Joliot-Curie at the Radium Institute in Paris. Because of difficult research conditions in Tokyo, Yuasa moved to Paris in 1940, even though the Second World War had just begun in Europe. She worked under Fr√©d√©ric Joliot- Curie at the Coll√®ge de France, where she researched the alpha and beta particles emitted by artificial radioactive nuclei and the energy spectrum of beta particles. With her thesis, titled \\"Contribution √† l'√©tude du spectre continu des rayons Œ≤‚àí √©mis par les corps radioactifs artificiels\\" (Continuous beta-ray spectrum generated by artificial radioactivity), she earned a doctorate in science in 1943. In August 1944, Yuasa was forced to leave Paris for Berlin. She continued her research in a laboratory in the University of Berlin and developed her own beta-ray spectrometer. In 1945, she was ordered by Soviet officials to return to Japan; she travelled with her spectrometer carried on her back. Upon her return to Tokyo, she returned again to Tokyo Women's Higher Normal School as a professor. She was unable to continue her previous research, however, since the United States Occupation Forces prohibited nuclear research in Japan. From 1946 to 1949, she worked at the RIKEN Nishina Center for Accelerator-Based Science and lectured at Kyoto University in 1948‚Äì1949. Yuasa returned to France in May 1949 as a researcher for the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS) while remaining a professor-on-leave at Ochanomizu University. She decided to stay in France permanently in 1955, resigning from her post at Ochanomizu. At the CNRS, she began research into beta decay using a Wilson chamber, and published a 1954 article warning of the dangers of hydrogen-bomb testing at Bikini Atoll. She was promoted to ma√Ætre de recherche (chief researcher) at CNRS in 1957. Her research shifted into nuclear reactions using synchrocyclotrons around 1960, and in 1962 she received a doctorate in science from Kyoto University for her thesis, \\"√âtude du type d‚Äôinvariant de l‚Äôinteraction Gamow-Teller en d√©sint√©gration Œ≤‚àí de 6He\\" (Form of Gamow-Teller invariant interaction on beta decay of 6He). Retirement, death and legacy Yuasa retired from the CNRS in 1974, but remained an emeritus researcher from 1975 onward. She received a Medal with Purple Ribbon from the Japanese government in 1976 for her efforts to promote cultural exchanges between France and Japan. She was hospitalised in January 1980 at the in Rouen. She died from cancer on 1 February 1980, aged 70. Yuasa was posthumously conferred the Order of the Precious Crown of the Third Class in 1980.

In 1994 he founded Webmedia to professionalise the process of web site design and build. In 1995 he was involved with the creation of the domain name management company NetNames. Pope is now a writer and a noted proponent of the d√©rive. Biography  Pope was born in 1961, the son of Patricia Pirard, a French national, and Marius Pope, a south-African born journalist of Lithuanian Jewish descent. His younger brother is the photographer Pat Pope.  Work= 3W and internet magazines  The World Wide Web Newsletter office, Hackney After graduating from Goldsmiths College with a BA degree in Fine Art in 1990, Pope worked as an artist with Loophole Cinema for five years. The World Wide Web Newsletter (later 3W magazine) was created by Pope at Goldsmiths College Computer Centre early in 1993. The magazine was conceived as a general information source to promote internet use. The name was taken from the World Wide Web project of Tim Berners-Lee and the first issue was published in late 1993, reporting at the time: \\"there are under 100 web servers in the world\\". 3W opened up many opportunities and Pope left Goldsmiths College to concentrate on web development work. Pope attended the first London Internet World exhibition in 1994 as an exhibitor with 3W magazine. He was hired by Time Out magazine in London to consult on their early web development. During 1994 Pope was asked by Future Publishing to join the team working on the first consumer internet magazine, .net. He worked from the Bath offices of Future Publishing on the first issues as Assistant Editor and also wrote extensively for the magazine during the first year of its existence.  Cybercafe  Pope was asked to curate an internet component for an arts symposium held at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London in March 1994. Inspired by reports of a cafe with bulletin board access in the US, he coined the term cybercafe for a weekend in the ICA theatre as part of an event called \\"Towards the Aesthetics of the Future\\", Placing internet access Apple Macs on the cafe style tables, Pope created an internet cafe concept.Esharenana E.

Bryan Lufkin Pope and internet artist Heath Bunting planned to open London's first cybercafe in 1994, although were beaten to it by Cyberia. With Steve Bowbrick, Pope founded Webmedia, an early web development company whose first offices were in the basement of Cyberia.Think Big. Stay Small. Make Money Wired. (December 1996). Steve Shipside. The aim of Webmedia was to professionalise the design and build of web sites, a process that did not exist at that time. Webmedia grew fast over the next two years, gaining early web accounts from the likes of Lloyds Bank and Lufthansa.  Netname and Nominet  While managing this fast growing company and working with the nascent web industry, Pope stumbled across domain name registration and founded NetNames in 1995 to handle global name registrations for companies and individuals.NetBenefit Acquires NetNames Internetnews.com. (16 December 1999). John Lewell. In 1996 Pope objected to the uncontrolled way in which Nominet began registering UK domain names for an annual fee. At the time there were no specialist domain name companies and NetNames quickly gained a reputation for specialist knowledge in what became an explosive space. In 1997 Pope separated NetNames from Webmedia, and in 2000 Pope sold NetNames to Netbenefit NBT, then a LSE listed UK company. He joined the board of Netbenefit and was briefly chair, before leaving in 2001.

History  A man and a Starship Technologies delivery robot waiting at a pedestrian crossing in Redwood City, California Starship Technologies was founded by Skype co- founders Janus Friis and Ahti Heinla. Initially, it was called Project Echo. A core team of the company became the team Kuukulgur, which led by Ahti Heinla had participated in NASA Centennial Challenge by building experimental sample retrieval robots. Starship Technologies O√ú was registered on 11 June 2014 in Tallinn, Estonia. Starship Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was registered in San Francisco, United States, on 28 September 2016. Starship Technologies launched pilot services in 2016, in the US and the UK among other countries, with commercial services launched in 2017. In April 2018, Starship launched its autonomous delivery service in Milton Keynes, United Kingdom, in partnership with Co-op and Tesco. In March 2020, Starship became the first robot delivery service to operate in a British town centre with the rollout of its service in Milton Keynes. In January 2019, Starship partnered with Sodexo to launch robot food delivery services at George Mason University. With a fleet of 25 robots at launch, this was the largest implementation of autonomous robot food delivery services on a university campus that time. In 2019, it expanded its services to Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Purdue University in West Lafayette, University of Pittsburgh, University of Wisconsin in Madison, University of Houston, and University of Texas at Dallas. In 2020, Starship expanded operations to the University of Mississippi and Bowling Green State University. In March 2020, it launched its service in Washington DC's Broad Branch Market. In March 2020 following the COVID-19 pandemic, Starship made a large number of redundancies. The company did not publish how many of 260 employees in Estonia it had dismissed.  Operations  A close up of a Starship delivery robot operating in the winter, with its camera array visible Starship develops and operates the last mile delivery robots. The electric-powered robots ride on sidewalks at a pedestrian speed, with a max speed of , can be remote-controlled if autonomous operation fails, and will only be used for relatively short-range local delivery. The robots use feature detection of edges and mapping techniques to determine the suitability of navigable terrain. The robot weighs unloaded, and can hold up to of deliveries. The robots are equipped with a sensor suite that includes cameras, GPS inertial measurement unit, ultrasonic sensors, radar, and possibly also other sensors but notably no lidar. The robots have speakers, so they can communicate with humans they meet. The service has been tested in over 100 cities and 20 countries around the world. The company operates in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Estonia. It has announced plans to expand its service to 100 university campuses in the United States, with the goal of reaching one million students. Corporate issues The Starship's original headquarters were established in London but were moved to San Francisco in 2018. Its engineering operations are located in Tallinn, Estonia, with a satellite team in Helsinki, Finland. Since 2018, the chief executive officer of Starship is Lex Bayer. Ahti Heinla acts as the chief technology officer of the company. In 2014‚Äì2018, Allan Martinson served as the chief operating officer of Starship. Starship has won US$85 million seed funding.

In the course of the military operation, troops of the UPR Army entered Kyiv simultaneously with the units of the White Army, but were defeated. In Ukrainian historiography, the event has the name of the Kyiv catastrophe (–ö–∏—ó–≤—Å—å–∫–∞ –∫–∞—Ç–∞—Å—Ç—Ä–æ—Ñ–∞).  Prelude  The attack on Kiev was in support of General Vladimir May-Mayevsky's Advance on Moscow over Kursk, Orel and Tula. To secure the western flank, Nikolai Bredov was ordered to advance towards the Dnieper and Desna River and take Kiev and other Dnieper crossings in the Yekaterinoslav-Bryansk sector. Anton Denikin also saw a possibility to make contact with Poland and Western Europe for support and supplies. The White troops were under command of Lieutenant-General Nikolai Bredov and consisted of the 5th Cavalry Corps, the 7th Infantry Division and the Combined Guards Brigade with a total strength of approximately 6,000 men. Kiev was under control of the Red Army since January 1919, but by the end of August, the state of the Red armies of the Southern Front was described as \\"serious\\". The morale of the Soviet troops was low after a series of defeats on the Southern Front. Another player in the conflict was the pro-independence Ukrainian People's Republic of Symon Petliura with its headquarters in Vinnytsia. Despite the common Bolshevik enemy, the attitude of the Great-Russian White Army towards the Ukrainian People's Republic (Petliurists) was rather hostile. It was stated that :  The Battle  In the first week of August 1919, the White First Army Corps under General Alexander Kutepov struck at the junction of the 13th and 14th Soviet armies. The Red Front was broken, both armies were forced to begin a retreat deep into Ukraine. The troops of the VSYUR wedged into the formed gap. The unified corps under the command of Bredov rushed towards Kiev, which housed the staff and logistics units of the 12th Army. The Bolsheviks evacuated the city without a serious fight, after shooting hundreds of residents, detained by the Cheka in the last days of Bolshevik power in the city. From the west, simultaneously with the beginning of the White offensive, Ukrainian troops began their offensive. The Ukrainian army under the command of General Anton Kraus, consisted of the I and III corps of the Galician Army and the Zaporozhye Corps of the UPR Army (without the 2nd Brigade), totaling up to 18,000 bayonets and sabers. Anticipating the inevitability of meeting White Army troops, the Ukrainian Army commander Mykola Yunakiv ordered to avoid to enter into armed conflict with them. The Ukrainian Army arrived first at Kiev and occupied the city by the end of the day of August 30, after some skirmishes with rearguard Red Army troops. On August 31 a victory parade was planned at 16:00 on the Duma Square in the presence of Petlyura. Due to carelessness, and because intelligence reported that the White Army would not be able to be in Kiev before September 3, not all bridges over the Dnieper had been secured. In fact, advanced units of the White Army had already reached the Kiev suburbs in the evening of August 30. The next day, up to 3,000 Volunteers began to advance towards the city center, disarming all the Ukrainian detachments they met on the way. When the Ukrainian troops marched solemnly in column to the Duma Square, the advanced sections of the Volunteers, under the command of N.I. Stakelberg, entered the city over the Chain Bridge. Around noon, the Ukrainian units were located on the Duma Square near the Kiev City Council, on the balcony of which the Ukrainian flag was hoisted. Having found out that White Volunteers were already in Kiev, Petliura canceled his arrival to the city and gave the order to cancel the planned parade. The commander of the Galician Army, Myron Tarnavsky also left the city. Around two o'clock in the afternoon the Volunteers arrived on the Duma square. The commander of the squadron of Volunteers, introducing himself to the general, asked permission for his unit to take part in the parade and install a Russian tricolor next to the Ukrainian flag already posted on the Duma. On both requests, general Anton Kraus agreed. But when Colonel Volodymyr Salsky of the Zaporozhian Corps arrived and saw the Russian tricolor on the Duma, he gave the order to bring that flag down. One of his soldiers climbed the balcony, tore off the Russian flag and threw it to the ground in the dust under the hooves of the horses. An enraged Volunteer cavalrist tried to cut down Colonel Salsky, but was killed himself. This led to an exchange of fire between the White Volunteers and the Ukrainians. Several soldiers were killed or wounded and the Ukrainians hastily fled from the Duma Square. The news of the fight spread quickly, and throughout Kiev Volunteers began to disarm and take prisoner Ukrainian units. In total, up to 3,000 fighters of the Ukrainian army were disarmed or captured, including the headquarters of the Third Corps. Some 4,000 Ukrainians soldiers, under the command of Colonel Mikitka, concentrated around the railway station, waiting for orders from their command, but no orders were received. Kraus tried to negotiate with Bredov, but Bredov stated that \\"Kiev, the mother of Russian cities, was never Ukrainian and will never be, and that there can not be any negotiations with the delegation of the UPR army. \\" Bredov demanded Kraus to immediately and without any conditions, withdraw all Ukrainian troops from Kiev. Approximately at two o'clock in the morning on September 1, 1919, an agreement was reached. Kraus signed an order for the withdrawal of the Ukrainian troops from Kiev for a day's march (about 25 kilometers) to the West. The Ukrainian troops were not to undertake any hostile actions against the Volunteers, and could not take more from Kiev than they brought with them. The parties mutually exchanged prisoners and returned the weapons of the disarmed detachments.  Aftermath  On 22 August (4 September) 1919 Petliura gave an order to withdraw the Ukrainian troops even further West, to the Kazatin - Zhitomir line. The wider Kiev region was occupied by the group of General Bredov, composed of the 15th and 7th divisions (up to 8,000 soldiers). Further negotiations were foiled, because of the inflexible goal of the Whites of restoring Unified Indivisible Russia within the pre-war borders. Such conditions were absolutely unacceptable for the Ukrainian side and it was not possible to create a single anti-Bolshevik front in the South-West of Russia. Kiev was retaken by the Bolsheviks in December 1919.

Biography  Active throughout the sixties and into the eighties of the 20th century, he was one of the most representative members of the post-Stalinist current of the Socialist realism. Born in Leningrad, now St. Petersburg, in 1930, he completed his studies at the Academy of Fine Arts and Industries of Leningrad and graduated with a specialization in monumental painting. His diploma, designed in collaboration with his colleague Marat Ghirsheviƒç Podoksin, was the celebration of the Red Army: with Podoskin, Ladvi≈°ƒçenko conceived the project for the pictorial decoration of the main hall of the Museum of Military History of the Artillery in St. Petersburg . Their supervisors were A. Kazantsev and K. Ignatov.  Work  Among the works that the State commissioned him to paint, there were the cartoons for the mosaics of the Museum of the Great October Revolution in St. Petersburg (former name of the Museum of Russian Political History), made in 1973 with his colleague M. Podoksin and the monumental fresco, painted in tempera in the Palace of Culture, called \\"The Metallurgic\\", in the city of Izhevsk, painted in collaboration with M. Podoskin as well (1975‚Äì76). In 1965, Ladvi≈°ƒçenko participated in Moscow to the historic exhibition \\"In Defence of Peace\\", an event organized to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the victory of the USSR against the Nazi-fascist block. Among the participants there were artists like Dmitry Zhilinskij (1927 - 2005), who, on that occasion, displayed his famous painting \\"Gymnasts of the USSR\\".

It was published on May 24, 2016, by G. P. Putnam's Sons. The novel is the third and final in The 5th Wave trilogy, preceded by The Infinite Sea. The Last Star concludes the story of 16-year-old Cassiopeia \\"Cassie\\" Sullivan battling against the aliens that have invaded Earth. It continues the story from where it left off in The Infinite Sea. Summary The story opens with a flashback of Cassie Sullivan's dad, when he was a kid on a school field trip to a planetarium. Amazed by a starry spectacle the administrators displayed, he decides then and there to name a future daughter after Cassiopeia. In the present, the remaining human population tries to avoid run ins with the \\"Others\\", the aliens that have wiped out most of humanity. A band of survivors hides in caves near Urbana, Ohio. One of them, a priest, turns out to be a Silencer, a human physically enhanced by an implanted neural chip (part of the Other's \\"12th System\\") that also makes them believe they are Others. After killing the humans, the Silencer sits back to wait for the day the alien mothership drop the Final Wave, the green bombs that will complete the destruction of humanity and complete the Others' plans for Earth. Human teenager Ringer, enhanced with the 12th System by Vosch, the human-appearing leader of the Others, has spent 40 days in the wilderness testing out her enhancements. She returns to Vosch because she knows they have a mutual goal that he will help her kill Evan Walker, a Silencer who has started to help the humans after falling in love with Cassie. Vosch gives Ringer a bomb contained in a pill that can destroy everything in a five-mile radius, so that she can kill herself instead of being killed by the Final Wave when the time comes. He then dispatches Ringer and a Silencer named Constance to look for Evan in the caverns. Cassie, her younger brother Sam (called Nugget), her former high school crush Ben Parish (now using the name Zombie) and other young humans from Squad 53 are hiding at a safe house. The squads were teams of young humans who were \\"weaponized\\" into the 5th Wave, tricked into attacking other human survivors by being told that those humans are actually Others in human disguise. Cassie is surprised one day by the arrival of Evan. She screams at him about how cruel the Other's takeover has been, and the fact that Sam is forgetting his life before the invasion started, losing his traits of humanity. Later, she is furious with Zombie when he announces that he and Dumbo are going to the caverns to find Teacup and Ringer (they don't know about Ringer's transformation, nor that Teacup is already dead), so he can warn them about the upcoming final Wave. While in the woods, an attack ends with Dumbo shot in the back. Zombie stuffs rags into Dumbo's wound, hides him in a building in Urbana, and goes for help. Later Zombie finds an old cat lady who reminds him of his grandmother. She offers him some soup, then reveals that the secret ingredient is cat, then she tries to strangle Zombie. He has no choice but to shoot her dead. Ringer and Constance land near the caverns. Constance disappears and Ringer battles the Silencer priest, whose 12 System power is faster and stronger. At that point, Zombie also arrives at the caves, still looking for Ringer and Teacup. He falls into a large pit full of dead bodies and starts to sink, when Constance pulls him out and shoots the priest dead. Zombie, Ringer and Constance head into Urbana to reunite with Dumbo. Zombie is suspicious of Constance but Ringer vouches for her, knowing that if she doesn't Constance will kill her friends. They return to Dumbo's hiding place, but Ringer notes that he has lost too much blood. Dumbo dies, and Zombie marks his grave with colored flags. The three of them return to the safe house where Evan, Cassie, Nugget and Megan (a young child they previously rescued) are waiting. When the trio arrive, Constance grabs Nugget and puts a gun to his head, demanding that Evan be given to her so she can bring him back to Vosch. Nugget, using a gun hidden in his pants, shoots Constance. Her enhancements help her survive, so Ringer and Nugget shoot her repeatedly to finish her off. Ringer tells them that Vosch will see that Constance's implant is offline and send a helicopter and a squad of 5th Wave troops to capture Evan and kill everyone else. Evan volunteers to return to Vosch in order to save everyone else. As the chopper approaches, everyone hides in the basement of the safe house. Ringer and Evan kill many of the attacking soldiers, revealed to be Ringer's original squad before she was transferred to Squad 53. Evan is captured and taken away in the helicopter. Ringer devises a plan for those in the safe house to attack the soldiers that will come to bring back the survivors from the first chopper. During this planning and waiting, Ringer tells Zombie that she is pregnant with Razor's baby - a 5th Wave soldier who helped Ringer escape from Vosch at the end of the previous book. When the next chopper arrives, they kill all the soldiers, capture the helicopter pilot, Major Bob, and leave a wounded Zombie behind to take Nugget and Megan to the caves. Ringer forces Major Bob to fly them to Vosch's base. Evan has already arrived at the base, where Vosch finally explains the aliens' actions. They manipulate, commit genocide, and suppress the development of other sentient species to further their own environmentalist goals. He tells Evan that there are only 12 true Others on Earth like Vosch that know the entirety of their plans: the Others have gone to many planets and attacked dominant species in order to save the lives of all other species before the dominant ones can destroy themselves and their planet's ecosystems. He says that the next day, the mothership will bomb every city on Earth to destroy all footprints of mankind. This will remove all traces of art, music, knowledge, and civilization. As a result, the remainder of humanity will fight amongst themselves, without ever having access to their past knowledge. Humans will never be able to rise to civilization again and forever stay in the stone age, thus keeping the balance of life on earth. When this Final Wave succeeds, Vosch's reward will be a launch in an escape pod to the mothership to become an immortal consciousness. Vosch knows that his 12th System creation, Ringer, will come back to kill him, so he must have her killed. He examines Evan and discovers that the glitch in the 12th System is love - in Evan's case, he fell in love with Cassie. He has Evan reprogrammed to have all of his humanity erased from his mind, leaving him as an emotionless killing machine. He knows Ringer will come and plans to have Evan kill her. At the caves, a helicopter searches for the escapees from the safe house. Zombie, Nugget, and Megan are soon in a heated battle with the attacking squad. Zombie is helping Megan and Nugget escape when he is suddenly shot in the back of the head and everything goes white. Ringer and Cassie begin their infiltration of the base. Upon landing, Cassie (now dressed in a soldier uniform) runs one way as Ringer runs another. Ringer detonates a bomb and in the confusion Cassie is able to hide among the troops. Cassie and Ringer plan to make it to the command center from opposite directions, with Ringer setting off additional bombs to cause chaos. Cassie continuously hears an alarm warning that General Order Four will commence in five minutes and all forces are to head to designated safe areas. Cassie makes it to the door where she is to wait for Ringer, when General Order Four activates. All the lights in the base go dark, the sprinkler system goes off, starting to flood the room, and her skin begins to burn - a small version of the first three waves (blackouts, floods, pestilence) the Others used when they attacked Earth. She shoots out a window and leaps outside, rolling in the dirt to try and get the poison off her skin. At the Urbana caves, Zombie comes to. A female Sergeant shows him a picture of Ringer and asks where she is. He plays dumb until she places a gun to Nugget's head, then he admits that Ringer went to the base to kill Vosch. Her troops want to kill Nugget, Zombie and Megan, but the Sergeant says their orders where to capture them, so they load them on the helicopter and head back to the base. When Ringer spots Cassie rolling on the ground, she jumps 40 feet across a roof and then jumps three stories down to help Cassie. Ringer removes all of Cassie's clothes and swaps outfits with her, knowing that her 12th System enhancements will protect her from the poison. The pair descend into the base in search of Evan and Vosch. They enter the computer core and try to find Evan's data, so they can find out where he is. Since all the people's data/memories are labeled by number, Cassie decides to download all 10,000 people's worth of memories into her mind. Ringer hears movement in the hallway and leaves Cassie strapped into the download chair. Meanwhile, Cassie now knows everything about Ringer, Evan, Zombie, Nugget, and every other human loaded in the database. She also learns all of the access codes and the layout of the base. Ringer finds Evan in the hall, and they fight. Because Evan is now purely 12th System, he is much faster, stronger, and more ruthless than Ringer. She shoots him repeatedly, to little effect. When Evan breaks her back, she knows the 12th System won't repair her quickly enough, so Ringer screams to Cassie to run. When Evan enters the room, he only finds bits of Cassie's hair and blood in the chair, as she has torn herself out. As he uses his super hearing to find her, entering a flooded room, where Cassie drops a live electrical wire into the water, electrocuting him. Vosch finds Ringer, still paralyzed. He explains that he thinks of himself as Ringer's creator/father, and wants to take her with him to the mothership. She turns him down, distracting him until Cassie appears and shoots him in the head. Cassie emotionlessly tells Ringer that she killed Evan, and Ringer consoles her, stating that he was already gone, having been turned into a shell of a person without humanity. Cassie, with her downloaded knowledge, uses a keypad to open a secret door to Vosch's escape pod. Cassie leaves in the pod and Ringer searches her pockets for the explosive pill Vosch gave, so she can wipe out the base. She remembers that she switched outfits with Cassie, so Ringer drags herself to Vosch's body and searches his pockets for the kill-switch that will kill all 5,000 soldiers at the base who have tracker implants. Zombie, Nugget and Megan are in the helicopter, which has been circling the base waiting for General Order Four to be turned off. The pilot and soldiers suddenly stiffen and die. Zombie realizes Ringer or Cassie must still be alive and activated the kill-switch. The trio survive the helicopter crashing by jumping into a river. As they head to the base, they see a green light launch and head towards the mothership. Cassie realizes she has no fear as she is no longer alone, with the memories and emotions of 10,000 people in her mind. She finds the explosive pill in her pocket and recognizes it from one Megan had, which is activated by the carbon dioxide in a person's exhaled breath. The escape pod docks on the giant mothership, the size of Manhattan, and sees that it is filled with the high explosives that are to be dropped on Earth's cities. She recites her and Sammy's nighttime prayers one last time, bites down on the pill, and breathes. Zombie witnesses a large explosion from the mothership and it then disappears. He finds Ringer paralyzed in the hallway and realizes that Cassie has sacrificed herself to destroy the Others and their ship. Several months later, Zombie and Nugget are in a toy store in Texas. They come across a soldier with one hand in his shirt holding a wound--similar to a scenario Cassie experienced in the first book. Nugget wants to kill the soldier and Zombie tells him that they don't do that anymore. Zombie tries to reason with the soldier, but the soldier pulls a gun and shoots himself in the head. Zombie and Nugget return to a house where Ringer is nursing her newborn baby girl she named Cassie. Outside, Evan Walker is patrolling - the 12th System saved him from the electrocution, and his human friends have re-downloaded his memories, returning his humanity. Evan tells Zombie that he plans to go to as many 5th Wave military bases as he can and destroy them, calculating that for every life he takes, two will be saved. As Evan leaves, Nugget watches from the house. He asks Zombie about the constellation that was his sister's namesake, and Zombie points out that three of the stars are a throne that the constellation Cassiopeia sits on, from which Cassie now sits to watch over the realm.

Ministry of Environment & Forest & Others is a landmark decision by the Supreme Court of India, which declared that Gram Sabha has a role to play in safeguarding the customary and religious rights of the STs and other Traditional Forest Dwellers (TFDs) like Dangaria Kondha etc. under the Forest Rights Act. The Apex Court maintained that the decision lies with the locals. Parties Orissa Mining Corporation (OMC), a State of Odisha Undertaking was the Petitioner who approached the Apex Court seeking a Writ of Certiorari to quash the order dated 24.08.2010 passed by the Respondents i.e. Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF)and others.  Bench  The case was heard before a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court, composed of Justice K.S. Panicker Radhakrishnan, Justice Aftab Alam (judge) and Justice Ranjan Gogoi.http://supremecourtofindia.nic.in/outtoday/judgments/180.pdf Justice Radhakrishnan had functioned as a Standing Counsel for a number of educational and social organizations and held appointments in the High Courts of Kerala, Jammu and Kashmir and Gujarat before his elevation to the Supreme Court.https://archive.today/20140726042027/http://sci.nic.in/judges/sjud/ksradhakrishnan.htm  Judgement = Observations of the Apex Court  While disposing of the Writ Petition, the Apex Court, in Para 15 of the Judgement, observed as follows: \\"The blatant disregard displayed by the project proponents with regard to rights of the tribals and primitive tribal groups dependant on the area for their livelihood, as they have proceeded to seek clearance is shocking. Primitive Tribal Groups have specifically been provided for in the Forest Rights Act, 2006 and this case should leave no one in doubt that they will enjoy full protection of their rights under the law. The narrow definition of the Project Affected People by the State Government runs contrary to the letter and spirit of the Forest Rights Act, 2006. Simply because they did not live on the hills does not mean that they have no rights there. The Forest Rights Act, 2006 specifically provides for such rights but these were not recognized and were sought to be denied.\\"  Findings  In its judgment, the Court has directed that the State Government as well as the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, Government of India, would assist the Gram Sabhas for settling of individual as well as community claims. The Court accordingly directed in the concluding parts of the Judgment as follows: Para. 60. We are, therefore, inclined to give a direction to the State of Orissa to place these issues before the Gram Sabha with notice to the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, Government of India and the Gram Sabha would take a decision on them within three months and communicate the same to the MOEF, through the State Government. On the conclusion of the proceeding before the Gram Sabha determining the claims submitted before it, the MoEF shall take a final decision on the grant of Stage II clearance for the Bauxite Mining Project in the light of the decisions of the Gram Sabha within two months thereafter. Para. 61. The Alumina Refinery Project is well advised to take steps to correct and rectify the alleged violations by it of the terms of the environmental clearance granted by MoEF. Needless to say that while taking the final decision, the MoEF shall take into consideration any corrective measures that might have been taken by the Alumina Refinery Project for rectifying the alleged violations of the terms of the environmental clearance granted in its favour by the MoEF. Para. 62. The proceedings of the Gram Sabha shall be attended as an observer by a judicial officer of the rank of the District Judge, nominated by the Chief Justice of the High Court of Orissa who shall sign the minutes of the proceedings, certifying that the proceedings of the Gram Sabha took place independently and completely uninfluenced either by the Project proponents or the Central Government or the State Government. Para. 63. The Writ Petition is disposed of with the above directions. Communicate this order to the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, Gram Sabhas of Kalahandi and Rayagada Districts of Orissa and the Chief Justice of High Court of Orissa, for further follow up action.  Implementation  In order to implement the directives of the Apex Court, 12 Gram Sabhas were held, seven in the district of Rayagada and five in the district of Kalahandi. In Rayagada district, the Gram Sabhas are slated to be held at villages namely Serajpadhi, Keskapadhi, Batodi, Khambesi, Jorapa, Lamba and Lakhpadar. Similarly, the villages identified for Gram Sabhas in Kalahandi district include Tadijhola, Palbari, Phuldeemer, Jurpa and Kunakada. Sri Sarat Chandra Miashra, District Judge, Rayagada has been nominated supervisor for the Gram Sabhas under Rayagada district and the District Judge of Kalahandi was the observer for other five Gram Sabhas held in Kalahandi district. All the Gram Sabhas voted against the Vedants's mining project.

Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is believed to have been expanded during the 18th century with the images excavated from Thiruporur. The temple has a five-tiered gateway tower leading to a pillared halls and the sanctum. The temple is open from 6:30 am ‚Äì 12:30 pm and 3.30 - 8 pm. Four daily rituals and many yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which the Vaikasi Visagam celebrated during the Tamil month of Vaikasi (May - June), Kanthasasti festival and Navarathri festival being the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Legend As per Hindu legend, Murugan fought with demons in three places, namely, the sea at Tiruchendur, land at Thirupparankundram and in air at Thiruporur. It is believed that sage Agastya on his way to Pothigai hills visited this place. Since Muruga won over Tharuka asuran, this place came to be Porur (por in Tamil means war) and also called by other names like Tharukapuri and Samarapuri. According to the sthala puraanam, at some point of time, the place was submerged in a deluge. A sage named Chidambara Adigal was residing in Madurai and a divine voice asked him to unearth the statue under a palm tree. He dug out the statue and built a temple around it. There is a separate shrine dedicated to him in the temple and he is given special respect during the Vaikasi Visagam festival. During the last event of the festival, he is depicted merging with the presiding deity. History The temple is believed to have been built during the Pallava era in the 10th century CE. Chidambara Swamigal, believed to be a descendant of the Sangam age poets, rebuilt the temple during the 17th century. An effort was made to dig up a room in the temple by archaeologists during 2013, which yielded only items used during rituals and not any archaeological artifact. During 2013, as many as belonging to the temple located at Thandalam that was leased earlier, was recovered from the land grabbers. The recovered land was valued at 100 crores. In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu religious and charitable endowments Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Architecture The temple is located in Thiruporur, in Old Mahabalipuram Road, from Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu. The temple has a five-tiered rajagopuram, the gateway tower, raising to a height of and wide. The temple covers an area of . The sanctum of the temple is approached through a 24 pillared hall near the gateway tower. The temple tank is located outside the temple. The sanctum is built with granite, which houses the image of Murugan in the form of Kandaswamy in standing posture. The sanctum faces East and the image of the presiding deity is tall. The image is sported with two hands with one of them holding Vel (divine spear), and an image of peacock besides the presiding deity. There are separate shrines of his consorts Valli and Deivaanai around the first precicnt. There is a separate shrine for Shiva and Parvathi and all the Parsvatah Devatas (attendant deities) associated with Shiva temples. Religious significance Kandaswamy is revered by Chidambara Swamigal in 726 verses. The image of Muruga is believed to have been discovered under a palm leaf. There is a palm leaf maintained in the temple, which is believed to have been the original palm leaf. Aruna giri naadhar, a 16th-century saint has glorified the temple in his work in Thiru pugazh. He has mentioned that Shiva is the head of all Vedas, the sacred texts. Bala deva raya has mentioned Kandaswamy as \\"Samara puri vaazh Shan mugatthu arase\\" in his works in Kanda Shasti Kavasam. Festivals and religious practises The image of Kandaswamy is believed to have originated on its own and hence ablution is not done to the presiding deity as with the other temples. There is an yantra over a Tortoise base where all the rituals are performed. The temple is open from 5:30 am ‚Äì 12:30 pm and 3:30 pm - 8:30 pm on all days except during festive occasions when it has extended timings.

The building burnt down in 1998, and only its roofless shell remains today, the rebuilding of this site was cancelled. History Australia Hall was built by the Australian Branch of the British Red Cross Society as an entertainment venue for wounded soldiers of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps who were being treated in Malta during World War I. The hall was built in November 1915, and was officially opened on 22 January 1916 by Governor Paul Methuen. The hall could accommodate up to 2000 people, and it was used as a theatre, and also included a library. The building was subsequently used by the Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes, and it also served as a cinema after 1921. Plaque on front fa√ßade In 1978, the British military vacated Pembroke, and the hall became property of the Government of Malta. A year later, the building was transferred to the Malta Labour Party in exchange for some property in Marsa. In 1996, the hall was listed as a Grade 2 National Monument by the Malta Environment and Planning Authority. The building burnt down in December 1998, possibly in an arson attack. The fire destroyed the hall's roof and interior, but its roofless masonry shell is still intact, although it has been vandalized and its walls are covered in graffiti. The roofless Australia Hall and its ruins in 2017 In 2010, the Labour Party was taken to court since it did not keep the hall in good condition, as was agreed upon in the 1979 contract. The charges were dropped in October 2013, when the Labour Party was in government. In 2014, the Labour Party sold the hall and some surrounding land to A. H. Development Ltd for a sum of ‚Ç¨582,343. This amount was described as \\"grossly far off the current market price\\" by property agents, and the sale of the building has been described as controversial. This has resulted in a court case, with the Labour Party appealing that it is exempt from paying the tax on the sale. It is estimated that the Australia Hall together with the surrounding gardens are actually worth ‚Ç¨5.5 million. In 2016, Australian High Commissioner Jane Lambert called for Australia Hall's restoration, and she is in contact with the building's owners, discussing possibilities for how to develop the site. There are plans to destroy the flora and fauna around the Australia Hall to build a massive embassy for China. The move promoted criticism amongst residents and the general public for the take over of the open space which is owned by China. 19,000 sq metres will be developed and closed to public access. The mega project will be out of context of the historic environment of the Australia Hall.https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/building-of-chinese-embassy- attack-on-green-open-spaces-residents.789146 Richard Ellis, Australia Hall outside.jpg Richard Ellis, British troops at Australia Hall.jpg Richard Ellis, Servicemen at Australia Hall.jpg Richard Ellish, Australia Hall, Penbroke.jpg References External links  * Australia‚Äôs unlikely WW1 history in Malta where ANZAC troops enjoyed respite, recreation and rehabilitation, News.com.au Pembroke, Malta Buildings and structures completed in 1915 ANZAC (Australia) Theatres in Malta Cinemas in Malta Theatres that have burned down 1998 fires Ruins in Malta Modern ruins Controversies in Malta Fires in Malta ","title":"Australia Hall"},{"id":"48478755","text":"This is a list of fictional characters from the Japanese anime television series, Fafner in the Azure.  Main characters  ; : Voiced by: Makoto Ishii (Japanese), Johnny Yong Bosch (English, TV series), Micah Solusod (English, Heaven and Earth) : Kazuki is very quiet which makes it seem like he has a cold personality, but he is in fact a very kind and sincere character. He has a fear of hurting those around him, which causes him to distance himself from everybody‚Äîeven his friends. : Like most of the children on Tatsumiya Island, he had no idea the Earth was under invasion and strives throughout the series to understand why the adults hid this from him, and especially, why his estranged childhood friend S≈çshi is so willing to do whatever it takes to defend this humble island. Naturally, to someone with such a gentle nature, having to fight for his life constantly is a bewildering experience that causes him to question who he is and what he believes in, but he really grows as a person over the course of the story and becomes everything a real and uncliched hero ought to be. : Kazuki is originally the pilot of the Mark Elf (XI), but is given the much more powerful Salvator-Type Fafner, the Mark Sein, later in the series. His mother, Akane, was assimilated by Festum long ago and he now lives with his father Fumihiko who he gets along with very well. He enjoys getting to know S≈çshi outside of battle again, and feels comforted when he's with Maya. Living with only his father, he does all the cooking and shopping and thus is an excellent chef. He also seems to be very bad at card games (he's too honest to be good at bluffing). ; : Voiced by: K≈çhei Kiyasu (Japanese), Steve Staley (English, TV series), Josh Grelle (English, Heaven and Earth) : S≈çshi is basically the only one of the children on Tatsumiya Island who knows the truth‚Äîthe world has been under invasion by an alien race called the Festum for the past three decades and Japan was destroyed 28 years ago. He is the son of K≈çz≈ç Minashiro, the commander of the secret military fortress ALVIS, which is hidden in the bowels of the peaceful-seeming Tatsumiya Island. From a very young age, S≈çshi was bred to become the next commander of ALVIS, so he has had a very isolated childhood carrying the heavy secret of the war and being told day in and day out that he must live only to protect the island. Though he was very close friends with Kazuki as children, due to an incident in which Kazuki ended up blinding S≈çshi's left eye, they have drifted apart, but find themselves once again clinging tight to each other for support when the Festum attack Tatsumiya and it is up to the two of them to defend it. : Because of his incomplete vision, S≈çshi cannot pilot a Fafner and fight the Festum hand-to-hand. Instead, he acts as the battle commander who connects directly into the minds of all the Fafner pilots through a super computer called the Siegfried System, and directs them in battle. All the pilots, especially Kazuki, hold to him for strength and leadership‚Äîa burden that he shoulders with grace and stoicism. : Because of his years of virtual isolation, he is rather awkward socially, (in fact, most people find him quite unapproachable or mistakenly think him hard-hearted). Kazuki alone seems to make efforts to understand and befriend him and the two become very close over the course of the series. S≈çshi also has a little sister named Tsubaki who is the island's Core and powers all the computer systems on it. He later pilots Mark Nicht, another Salvator-Type Fafner which like Mark Sein is born from power of nothingness of Tatsumiya Island's Mir. ; : Voiced by: Marika Matsumoto (Japanese), Stephanie Sheh (English, TV series and Heaven and Earth) : Maya is a childhood friend of both Kazuki and S≈çshi. She is a very lively girl who enjoys rock climbing. She is very frank about everything she says which gives her an air of reliability... but when it comes to romance she has a long way to go. : Her mother, Chizuru, is the only doctor on the whole of Tatsumiya Island. She also has an older sister named Yumiko who works as a teacher for the handicapped. Although her family works a lot in the medical field, Maya herself has never had much skill in the field... In fact, she even has trouble applying a bandage when needed. : Maya is an amazing mix of compassion, genuine sweetness, and steel. She has a surprising inner strength as we see in how calmly she thinks under pressure, her willingness to defy authority when she feels it is in the wrong, and her selfless courage in defending her loved ones no matter the situation. She is also extremely observant and sees much more deeply into other people's feelings than they are often willing to show. Her sweet nature translates into an impressive battle persona of icy-calmness. She is the best sniper of the Fafner pilots and eventually becomes the pilot of Mark Sieben (VII). After being captured by the Neo UN, she becomes a test pilot of the Mark Raison. Later, she manage to escape and kills Billy's brother, Dustin, for killing Hiroto. ; : : Canon enters the series in episode 11 along with Michio. The two are the ace Fafner pilots of the Neo United Nations' Human Army. She is an excellent and seasoned warrior despite her youth‚Äîa result of the war-torn life she has led. She is originally from Dublin, Ireland, which was completely annihilated four years prior to the series. All her family slaughtered, she is taken in by Hino Michio, a Human Army soldier, who teaches her the ways of the soldier. Hardened by a lifetime of fighting, she now simply exists and follows orders, unable to act, decide, desire or do anything of her own will. : When she arrives on Tatsumiya Island, she is at first offended and then confused by the peaceful world she encounters there.

Fafner Pilots of Tatsumiya Island  Fafners are giant humanoid war machines developed by mankind to combat the Festum invasion. Depending on the potential of the pilot, which can be looked through their Synergetic Code profile, they are capable of exhibiting immense power. The more closer their Synergetic Code to the golden ratio, the more potential they are as the pilot of Fafner. In the sequel Exodus, they even develop their latest abilities called SDP (Super Dimensional Power) after the new core of the island awakens. The name FAFNER refers to the character F√°fnir from Norse mythology who turned into a dragon to protect its treasure. Fafner pilots of Tatsumiya Island contain part of Festum's element within their bodies, which is an important thing in order to move the Fafner. Through Nibelung System, the pilot is able to synchronize with Fafner. Unfortunately, they will also experience the side-effect called assimilation phenomenon when piloting the Fafner and ultimately take on their own lives when the final sign of assimilation phenomenon occurs to them.

It is briefly used by Kazuki Makabe when he was trying to escape from the Neo UN base after Festum's attack in the TV-series. * Fafner ? model - A second mass-production Fafner of the Neo UN seen during Operation Heaven's Door which is capable of flight. Might be Mega Therion units. * Fafner Mark Sein ('Existence') - The First Salvator-model Fafner created the Neo UN. Initially supposed to be piloted by Michio Hino, it became Kazuki's second boarding machine, delivered to him by a Festum in Master Form (Festums that take on human appearance) after Mark Elf was captured by the Neo UN and its core implanted into Mark Sein. The Festum in question is called Mj√∂lnir and is the Festum his mother Akane Makabe merged with, thus having her looks. This unit changed form and abilities drastically after melting inside a Festum, which among other things made it pilotable only by Kazuki. It has an ability to enhance normal weaponry by using it. In Exodus, Mark Sein has gained the power to negate and even reverse some cases of assimilation. * Fafner Mark Nicht ('Nothingness') - The Second Salvator-model Fafner created by the Neo UN. It is a black version of the Mark Sein's original form using the core of the sunken remnants of the Mark Vier.

Later piloted by Misao Kurusu in Heaven and Earth and by S≈çshi Minashiro in Exodus. The form of Mark Nicht appearing in the movie and Exodus is more organic in appearance than it was originally, similar to Mark Sein's transformation in the series. It also appears more demonic and sinister in appearance. In Exodus, while Mark Sein can assimilate weapons to increase their power and revert assimilation, Nicht has the power to assimilate its Festum targets and then use the unique abilities of those targets. Mark Nicht is occasionally referred to in Exodus as the \\"Child of Nothingness\\" (ËôöÁÑ°„ÅÆÂ≠ê, Kyomu no Ko). * Fafner Mark Raison ('Reason') - The Third Salvator-model based on the Mark F√ºnf developed by Neo UN as mentioned in Exodus. It was assigned to Maya T≈çmi after being captured by the Neo UN, after she escapes, Jonathan Mitsuhiro Bartland becomes the new pilot. It can link with the Azazel-Type Festum Vagrant, currently used as the Neo UN's surveillance Satellite and can assimilate enemies using light. The Raison can also control and manipulate the assimilated Festum through its link to the pilot and Mir. It also can create a powerful barrier similar that to the Aegis Shield, boosting one of the most powerful defense of all Salvator- type Fafners. * Fafner Titan Model (TSX) - Seen in Right of Left piloted by Ry≈ç, Yumi, and their classmates, it appears to be a pre-production model Fafner. At least four were produced. The Assimilation Phenomenon also appears to be accelerated when using the Titan models. Armaments seems to consist of Arm Machineguns, a prototype version of the Luger Lance simply called Naginata, and a multi-tube Missile launcher. * Fafner Mark Zwei (II) - Seen in Right of Left. It appears to have been built at the same time as the Mark I as their piloting tests were at the same time and they seem to have virtually identical configurations. This was Karin Kuramae's unit which she tried to board in the first episode. Most of it was used to repair/rebuild Mark Elf after Kazuki's first battle. * Fafner Mark Eins (I) - This appears to be the first Nothung Model made by Tatsumiya island. It was supposed to be piloted by S≈çshi Minashiro (as seen in Right of Left), but apparently he cannot use it because of his scarred eye. It is a basic unit that became Michio's after the destruction of the Mega Therion. It is later destroyed in battle against Mark Nicht, and Michio is killed. * Zero Fafner - The prototype Fafner model, later referred as Aegil-model Fafner in Heaven and Earth, only mentioned in official background information. Developed by professor Ikumi Nishio. After its initial test phase, some high-ranking members of ALVIS defected to the Neo UN. Zero Fafner is very huge and massive compared with other Fafner models, measuring about 100 m in height. As a Siegfried-system integrated frame, Zero Fafner requires two pilots in order to operate it. Zero Fafner is piloted by Rina and Akira Nishio (initially tested by Rina and Akira's parents, but failed as they were assimilated during the test) as seen in Heaven and Earth. Later will be appeared in Exodus. After Akira got assimilated, Sui Kaburagi takes his place. Mark I-III+XI apparently share the same body design, as do Mk.VI & VII and IV & VIII, respectively, according to the Memorial Book.  Festum Types  * Mir Type - The Mir Type, often simply called the \\"Mir\\", are the highest theorized evolution of Festum consciousness. In 2085, an unknown photon crystalline body is discovered in a huge crater at the bottom of the Seto Inland Sea. Named the Seto Inland Sea Mir, the photon crystalline body is determined to be an intelligent life-form. Presented at the Astrobiological Society conference, it is analyzed under the direct control of the Japanese government. A Mir controls the Festum hivemind, and are constantly assimilating information. Miwa Hino and people called Esperanto (Emery Almond, for example) are able to know Mir's language in order to seek peace and understanding each other. * Core Type - Serves as the \\"mediator\\" between Mir and human. Tsubaki and Orihime Minashiro of Tatsumiya Island and newly reborn- core of NSSC Bollearios (where Misao Kurusu merged with) are the example of this type. Idun was revealed to either have originally been a Core Type, or was pretending to fill this role, but after awakening he immediately became a Master Type and within months had evolved into an adult form. * Sphinx Type - Most common throughout the series; primarily consists of A Types. B Types rarely appear in the series, but serve as the primary Festum in Right of Left. Only one C Type appears early in the series in episodes 5 and 6 and is taken out by a suicide attack from the Mark Sechs. A D Type primarily uses long ranged weaponry and is the first festum to be killed in the first joint operation by Marks Drei, F√ºnf, and Acht. Misao Kurusu is an exceptional Sphinx Type Festum who has emotional feeling and wanna live in order to see the beautiful sky. * Grendel Type - Human sized Festum that resemble fleas. * Alhenterus Type - Weaker version of standard Sphinx Type. * Pleiades Type - Asexually reproductive Festum with highly explosive larvae. Exactly 117 newborns can easily destroy a mountain. * Coagula Type - Festum that only assimilate with no real offensive weapons in the series; later uses bombs in the movie. They can only be killed when their eyes acquire serious damage. * Scarab Type - Festum that only destroy with no assimilation properties. * Master Type - The leaders and the most powerful of the Festum, only a select few can differentiate from the hive mind. ** Idun - The most powerful Master Type and the main antagonist of the series. His power at both the destructive and assimilation level is greater than any other festum and can turn into a gigantic sphinx type that required the power of Mark Sein to stop. Near the end of the series he assimilates the Mark Nicht's pilot, Yukie Kariya, and hijacks the Mark Nicht. Idun seemed to have originally been a Core Type of an abandoned island, or perhaps had been pretending such a role to ambush the Tatsujima Island explorers. ** Mjolnir - A Master Type Festum, like Idun. Mj√∂lnir is the Festum that assimilated Kazuki's mother, Akane Makabe. It collaborated with Y≈çji Hino and was apparently killed shortly after delivering the Mark Sein to Kazuki; however, Mj√∂lnir reappears on Tatsumiya Island during the series finale. In Heaven and Earth, it was revealed that she survived, and later sacrificed her life by merging with the Tatsumiya Island's Mir to ensure its survival. * Slave Type - Mentioned in the first season. So far, K≈çy≈ç Kasugai (after he became Festum) is the only known Slave type. * Eurus Type - Newly evolved Festum in Heaven and Earth. Its body appears in red color. Notable in its ability to mimic and utilize human weapons like the Dragon Tooth. * Azazel Type - A new type of Festum introduced in Exodus. There are three sub-types of Azazel: Walker, Road Runner and Vagrant. Each of their seen number are unique, and are far larger than most common Festum. They seem to be the current new antagonists, replacing Idun and the North Pole Mir. Their appearance varies; for instance, the Azazel in Srinagar walked on four legs and was destroyed by Sein and Nicht but it managed to transport its core where it either reformed again or was consumed by another possible Azazel Type Festum, whereas the Azazel at Tatsumiya Island stands like a human and possess high intelligence. The last, Vagrant, was used by the Neo UN by providing it with information regarding Tatsumiya Island and their actions, until its Mir rebelled against the humans. It is implied that the Azazel Type are parts of and/or connected to a Mir, possible even the remains of the North Pole Mir, and S≈çshi claims that there are many more Azazel Types than the single two seen so far. * Diablo Type - A new type of Festum introduced in Exodus. They seem to demonic in shape and appearance, close quarter Festum that seem capable of overpowering and defeating mass-produced Fafner singlehandedly, by targeting their cockpits or attach to the pilot by assimilation and can take over the controls of fafner. They form worm spheres which can cut any Fafner. * Gregory Type - A new type of Festum introduced in Exodus, which is said to be \\"ghost\\" by Jonathan. Gregory is a result of human assimilation with Festum, leaving them dead and reappears as a ghost, taking humanoid form, such as the creepy-boy whom appeared in area Srinagar. Its appearance is not dangerous and aggressive like the other types, although disturbing. Later can assimilate its host's mind. * Leviathan Type - A new class of Festum as big as the Tatsumiya Island itself, measuirng about 6 kilometers in size. Its capable of swallowing huge enemies whole. Later defeated by Mark Zwolf after assimilating it and by Mark Nicht by destroying it during Operation Fourth Azure.  Weapons  These are all listed and used in the anime and/or game. * Aegis Shield - Mounted on protectors either on the shoulders or the back. It is essentially a portable Welle Shield, and is used to block Festum attacks. * Cluster Bomb * Dimension Gun - A large cannon/bazooka type weapon capable of inflicting a large amount of inter-dimensional damage. Can only fire one shot. Appears only in the game. * Dragon Tooth - A high-caliber sniper rifle with a 'tooth' to dig into the ground for stability. * Durandal - A small sidearm for taking on light targets. Ineffectual against the Festum. * Electromagnetic Launcher - A railcannon type weapon. It is usually referred to as the \\"Rail Gun\\". * Energy Fist - Used by Mark Drei initially. Concentrating energy into its right hand, the Fafner shoves it through the Festum's core, destroying it. * Fenrir System - A self-destruct system that is assumed to activate automatically, should the Fafner be assimilated. It creates a miniaturized black hole similar to the Festums upon detonation. * Fire Drake * Garm-44 - A semi-automatic rifle with 100 rounds, scaled to Fafner size. * Gegner - A small energy weapon, used typically against small the Festum. * Gelatic Bullet * Lindwurm - The Fafner's carrier-type vehicle. It is guided by the Siegfried System. Its armaments include Missile Pods, Grapple Pods, and a rotating Laser Cannon. * Loe√∞ingr Cutter - Small wires stored in the Fafner's knuckles that shoot out and envelope enemies. The wires can be charged to cut through materials. * Long Sword - Mounted in a compartment within the Lindwurm. A solid shaft with a laser-edge running up the blade. Proved to be marginally effective against the Festum. * Luger Lance - The Fafner's main weapon. Usually used as a sword, but can be expanded to open a gap. Once a gap is made, an energy shot can be launched. * Medusa - A shoulder mounted energy cannon. Contains considerable power, comparable to that of the Lindwurms Tail Laser Cannon. * Mine Blade - A short laser-edged knife. The blade is apparently made of nanomachines and can reshape itself, if broken. It bears an uncanny resemblance to the 'progressive knife' of the renowned series Evangelion in both appearance and use. * Piram - A handheld spike launcher. Once the spike hits the target, it sends an electric charge through the cable to damage or immobilize it. * Punch - A basic punching attack. Usually aided by a piston to provide more of a kick. * Salamander - A flamethrower * Scorpion * Thermotics Blade  References  Fafner in the Azure ","title":"List of Fafner in the Azure characters"},{"id":"48478813","title":"Adventure of a Lifetime"},{"id":"48478852","text":"The Jist (initiated 2012 in Oslo, Norway) is a Norwegian experimental contemporary jazz duo comprising Natalie Sandtorv and Torgeir Standal.  Biography  Sandtrov and Standall are both from √Ölesund in the western part of Norway, but did not meet until they started musical studies in Oslo in 2011. They wanted to explore sonically the implications of distressed urban life in the big city. They released a self-titled debut album (2014), recorded after two years of exploring and articulating a highly original language, employed with alternative approaches to their instruments in order to sketch dynamic, free-improvised soundscapes. Here they bring the experimental concept of improvised meetings between innovative vocal artists and guitarists to a new extreme. The album was recorded in Bergen, and John Hegre of Jazzkammer controlled the mixing and mastering. The album cover was executed by the artist Henrik Koppen. The Jist was well received at the 2015 Match & Fuse Festival in Warsaw. They \\"managed to make the whole venue literally rattle with just a guitar going through a volume pedal and a TC Electronic Mojomojo with some crocodile clips\\". They visited Poland with the tour \\"Owls Are Not!\\", and performed at the M√ìZG Festival, among others.

Instituted on 14 December 1993 in Skopje, the Republic of Macedonia, with support from the Dutch Interchurch Aid (DIA) and the World Council of Churches (WCC), MCIC was developed in response to social issues arising from the balkanization of Yugoslavia. MCIC has since developed as an independent, civic, non-profit organisation ready to face social challenges and create models or alternatives for resolving related problems. Since its establishment, MCIC has implemented more than 1,300 projects as part of 60 programs, amounting to over 45 million euros, in the following sectors: water supply and sanitation, rural development, health and education, employment and civil society, democratization, trust, immediate aid and activity in the Balkans. Following initial loan-based development, MCIC established the Macedonian Enterprise Development Foundation (MEDF), whose focus is the growth of small enterprises through provided access to financial and non-financial services. MEDF has since supported over 3,500 entrepreneurs with loans as well as non-financial services. MCIC has further supported the development of rural communities by strengthening their capacity for internal problem resolution. As a result of this support, 250 villages in the Republic of Macedonia now have access to drinking water. MCIC undertook the role of mediator during the conflicts in Kosovo (1999) and Macedonia (2001), mobilizing civil society in providing humanitarian response to the crisis. This period directed MCIC to post-conflict activities and confidence building as well as activities outside Macedonia. Regional cooperation peaked with the establishment of the Balkan Civil Society Development Network (BCSDN). Work methods=Consultations and Trainings Consultations and Trainings MCIC, since its foundation in 1993, has been active in the field of capacity development, on individual, organizational and institutional level. MCIC employs this approach in order to strengthen the capacities of the civil society organizations, local self- governments, state institutions, enterprises, schools and other organizations requiring capacity building. Part of the topics for which MCIC develops capacities encompasses: project cycle management, organizational management, institutional development and organizational strengthening, strategic planning, program/project management, human resources management, administrative and archive operations, financial management, public relations, communication skills, facilitation and presentation skills, training of trainers, intercultural learning, etc. Awareness Raising and Campaigns Awareness Raising and Campaigns MCIC, on several occasions, has used its campaigns for raising awareness of citizens and facilitating their support to the topic or theme of a specific campaign, during its 23 years of existence. The first campaign which was implemented by MCIC is still one of the most famous ones. ‚ÄûWhole is when there is everything!‚Äú (1999 and 2000). The campaign aimed to promote peace and human values. It communicated through simple messages pointing out to the values of life. Other campaigns followed: ‚ÄûI live here‚Äú (2003); ‚ÄûSay Macedonia‚Äú (2004); ‚ÄûEaster Campaign‚Äú (2005 ‚Äì continuation of Say Macedonia); ‚ÄûSay OK to MK‚Äú (2005); ‚ÄûNext to Each Other ‚Äì Different but Equal‚Äú (2007) and ‚ÄûBoth NATO and Macedonia‚Äú (2008). Research and Publications Research and Publications One of the MCIC‚Äô method of work is advocacy, understood as mutual intertwining and support of several activities: raising awareness and education, influence on the public policies and monitoring and requesting accountability. MCIC conducts its research by means of its own resources or by inclusion of external associates in form of primary or secondary research. Depending on the subject, the research use various instruments: questionnaires, in-depth interviews, contents analysis, case studies, statistical analyses, etc. MCIC publishes its research. Besides research, MCIC also publishes many other publications, predominantly related to the main topics in which it is active.

The fighting occurred primarily at the city of L·∫°ng S∆°n, a few kilometres from the Sino-Vietnamese border. Although the Chinese eventually occupied L·∫°ng S∆°n and its nearby vicinities during the battle, it proved during that time that the Chinese regular units invading northern Vietnam were no match against militia and irregular Vietnamese units tenaciously harassing the Chinese advance southward to Hanoi, Vietnam's capital city, and eventually took Chinese forces days to occupy the city and dislodge its defenders. After capturing the northern heights above L·∫°ng S∆°n, the Chinese surrounded and paused in front of the city in order to lure the Vietnamese into reinforcing it with units from Cambodia. This had been the main strategic ploy in the Chinese war plan as Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping did not want to risk an escalation potentially involving the Soviet Union. The Vietnam People's Army (VPA) high command, after a tip-off from Soviet satellite intelligence, was able to see through the trap, however, and committed reserves only to Hanoi. Once this became clear to the PLA, the war was practically over. An assault was still mounted, but the Vietnamese only committed one VPA regiment defending the city. After three days of bloody house-to-house fighting, L·∫°ng S∆°n fell on 6 March. The PLA then took the southern heights above L·∫°ng S∆°n.Armchair General magazine Background As part of the punitive expedition against Vietnam for the occupation of the pro- Chinese Democratic Kampuchea, Chinese forces entered northern Vietnam and advanced quickly about 15‚Äì20 kilometers into Vietnam, with fighting mainly occurring in the provinces of Cao B·∫±ng, L√†o Cai and L·∫°ng S∆°n. The Vietnamese avoided mobilizing their regular divisions into the fight, using most of them for the defense of Hanoi. The Vietnamese forces tried to avoid direct combat, and often used guerrilla tactics to harass the Chinese forces advancing southwards. To make this work for the Vietnamese, they had to use their mountainous terrain to their advantage, which was a serious handicap for the Chinese trying to assault and destroy several Vietnamese irregular units. Preparations The PLA General Staff Department placed the primary responsibility of capturing L·∫°ng S∆°n on the 55th Army from the Guangzhou Military Region and assigned the 54th and 43rd Armies from the Wuhan Military Region in supporting roles. Each of these armies of about 43,000 men was organized into three infantry divisions, one artillery regiment, and one anti- aircraft regiment. In addition, three regiments were also mobilized from the Chengdu Military Region, designated as Unit 56037, Unit 56039, and Unit 56229.O'Dowd, p. 76. He suggests that these units were probably part of the PLA 50th Army. The total strength of Chinese forces numbered about 130,000. The Chinese planned to launch their assault along all of the five roads that led to L·∫°ng S∆°n from the north, east, and south (Highways 1A, 1B, 4A, and 4B and the railroad for China), filling each of the directions with at least two or three divisions.O'Dowd, p. 76. From the border between markers 15 and 20, the 55th Army would thrust to the town of ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng, while the 43rd would cross the border between markers 32 and 45, sweeping through Chi Ma before attacking L·ªôc B√¨nh, which was 10 km to the southwest of L·∫°ng S∆°n, then moving northwest against the provincial capital via Highway 4B. The 54th Army would initially play its role as a reserve.O'Dowd, p. 55. Meanwhile, the Vietnamese defense in L·∫°ng S∆°n was assigned to the 3rd Division, a veteran division of the VPA that had participated extensively during the Vietnam War. This division, comprising the infantry 2nd, 12th, and 141st Regiments and the 68th Artillery Regiment, had about 9,950 men, assisted by several local force battalions from L·∫°ng S∆°n City and the districts of VƒÉn L√£ng and Cao L·ªôc, as well as the 166th Artillery Regiment and the 272nd Anti-Aircraft Regiment sent off by the 1st Military Region. The total Vietnamese strength was approximately 13,000 men, meaning that they were outnumbered 10 to 1. Three other divisions, the 327th, 337th, and 338th, stayed further from the front- line to serve as reserve units.Zhang, p. 96. To consolidate their defensive positions, the Vietnamese had built nearly 20,000 field fortifications, which were intensively camouflaged and supported by numerous minefields and obstacles. Battle=Taking out the defense around ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng The initial attacks was marked by Chinese artillery fire into L·∫°ng S∆°n at 05:00 on 17 February. The Chinese had paved way for their offensive throughout the night before by infiltrating the Vietnamese territory, cutting telephone lines and conducting sabotages.O'Dowd, p. 79. Waves of PLA troops from the 55th Army quickly overwhelmed Hill 386, a position situated 1.5 km south of the border, killing 118 Vietnamese.O'Dowd, p. 80. Though pockets of resistance were continued near the Friendship Pass and in ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng, most of the Vietnamese defense was by then undertaken south of the town by the VPA 12th Regiment at the hamlet of Th√¢m M√¥ and its vicinity. After taking Hill 386, the PLA used the 163rd Division to capture ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng and strike Vietnamese positions on the Th√¢m M√¥ line.O'Dowd, p. 56.Zhang, p. 97. The attack was backed by small groups of tanks arriving on Highway 4A. Fighting over the Th√¢m M√¥ area raged until 22 February, as Chinese charges in mass formations had been continuously repulsed with heavy casualties.O'Dowd, p. 81-82. The Chinese field commanders had to switch their tactics, using small-unit attacks to flank Vietnamese positions instead of frontal attacks by human waves. The change resulted in the fall of Th√¢m M√¥ to the hands of the PLA 163rd Division at 20:00.O'Dowd, p. 82. ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng was taken on the next day.Zhang, p. 99. Similarly, Chinese massed attacks to the east of Th√¢m M√¥ on Th√¢m L≈©ng, which had started from 17 February, were stiffly contained by the defenders. On 18 February, a Vietnamese counter- attack launched by the VPA 2nd Regiment drove PLA units back to their assemble positions on Hills 409, 611, and 675; this pattern was repeated on the following days. On 23 February, the PLA stormed Phai M√¥n, a position to the east of Th√¢m L≈©ng, using six waves of attacks, of which all were rebuffed. Chinese forces had to launch twelve more charges throughout the day to finally break through Th√¢m L≈©ng, allegedly suffering over 1,000 killed.O'Dowd, p. 83. At C·ªìn Khoang, a village in the rear of Hill 339, the Vietnamese 63rd Company had fended off the assault of an unevenly outnumbering Chinese force on 17 February, virtually wiping out an enemy battalion. Approaching and occupying L·∫°ng S∆°n From 24 to 26 February, fighting downscaled, as the PLA was holding back and regrouping. Two fresh Chinese divisions from the 54th Army, the 160th and 161st, moved up to spearhead the attacks, with the 55th Army behind preparing to advance toward L·∫°ng S∆°n. In meantime, the VPA 3rd Division had pulled out its troops from Th√¢m M√¥ to establish a new defensive perimeter between C·ªëc Ch·ªß and Hill 417, on the western side of Highway 4A near Th√¢m L≈©ng, in order to keep the highway blocked, as well as to stand up to Chinese pressure from Th√¢m L≈©ng. On 24 February, the VPA 1st Military Region Command officially established the L·∫°ng S∆°n Front with Major General Ho√†ng ƒêan in charge. Tr∆∞·ªùng S∆°n, \\"Bi√™n gi·ªõi ph√≠a B·∫Øc 1979: 30 ng√†y kh√¥ng th·ªÉ n√†o qu√™n (3)\\", Infonet, 17 February 2015. At 06:05 on 27 February, Chinese forces renewed their offensive in L·∫°ng S∆°n with a four-pronged attack on Hill 417, Khau Ma Son, Pa Vai Son, and Khau Khao Son, giving friendly units time to encircle L·∫°ng S∆°n from the southeast and southwest.Zhang, p. 105. Khau Ma Son, a strategic 800-meter height located 4 km west-northwest of Lang Son that virtually obstructed all major roads near the town, fell to a Chinese unit at about 14:00. Chinese control over Khau Ma Son made Vietnamese defense from Coc Chu to Hill 417 exposed to enemy's sight, as well as threatened VPA 12th Regiment's positions near Choc Vo. However, the Vietnamese reacted promptly, retreating from the Coc Chu ‚Äì Hill 417 defensive line to a group of positions between Qu√°n H·ªì and K√©o C√†ng, thus blocking the highway access to L·∫°ng S∆°n once again. The VPA command also reinforced their battered 12th Regiment by deploying the 42nd Regiment/327th Division to K·ª≥ L·ª´a, which was about 1 km north of L·∫°ng S∆°n, to face off the approaching PLA 43rd Army. Yet the remainder of the VPA 327th Division were still stationed further to the south at Chi LƒÉng to prevent any possible deeper Chinese intrusions. Other regular reserves, including three divisions of the 1st Corps (the 308th, 312th, and 320th-B), were also assembled south of the K·ª≥ C√πng River to protect Hanoi, leaving the task of defending L·∫°ng S∆°n City to the 3rd Division and the 42nd Regiment alone.O'Dowd, p. 84. From 28 February to 4 March, Chinese troops tried to push toward L·∫°ng S∆°n in a series of heavy engagements occurring to the north of the city. As the Chinese attacked, they also managed to take control over all the roads connecting with L·∫°ng S∆°n, thus employing Mao Zedong's strategy of \\"the countryside surrounding the city\\" in order to avoid a Vietnamese trap of a \\"second Verdun\\".Chen, p. 110. Citing from Guang Jiao Jing, No. 78, 16 March 1979, p. 7. By 28 February, they had captured all key positions that shielded L·∫°ng S∆°n from the northeast, including Khau Lau Son, Khau Bo Son, Khau Tang Son, and Pa Vai Son.Zhang, p. 105-106. Though seriously weakened, the Vietnamese 12th Regiment had not given up contesting Chinese troops along Highway 1B, with battalions and companies relentlessly defending Hills 607 and 649. On 2 March, a Chinese column on the highway was ambushed by a Vietnamese battalion. During the period of 2‚Äì10 March, a company of the Chinese Unit 56037 lost one-third of its men as it was holding a hill near B·∫£n Lan against successive Vietnamese assaults. The PLA 163rd Division's advance toward the K·ª≥ C√πng Bridge on 1 March also met fierce resistance; one Chinese battalion was caught on open ground by heavy weapons firing from Hill 279, where the command post of the VPA 42nd Regiment was situated, and two rock hills near Dong Uyen.Zhang, p. 106. While the battle for L·∫°ng S∆°n was taking its course, Vietnamese forces also carried out raids against Chinese border towns of Malipo and Ningming, but caused no significant losses.Chen, p. 110. From the south and the east of L·∫°ng S∆°n, it took the PLA 43rd Army two and a half weeks from 17 February to reach the city.O'Dowd, p. 85. Its 127th Division marched from Ba S∆°n between border markers 32 and 33 to Highway 1A at Cao L·ªôc,O'Dowd, p. 57. the itinerary which took the Chinese ten days just to overcome the distance of 5 km from the border to B·∫£n X√¢m due to drastic interceptions by the VPA 141st Regiment. To the south of L·∫°ng S∆°n, the PLA 129th Division targeted Hill 392, Hill 623, and the township of L·ªôc B√¨nh after crossing the border at Chi Ma. It took the Chinese eleven days to seize L·ªôc B√¨nh, which was still 22 km away from L·∫°ng S∆°n. Chinese forces kept using mass formation attacks to suppress the strong Vietnamese resistance on these directions.O'Dowd, p. 86. On 1 March, the PLA 165th Division/55th Army eventually pierced the Vietnamese defense held by the VPA 42nd Regiment at Lam Truong, which was 2 km northwest of L·∫°ng S∆°n. Its sister division, the 164th, had also captured the headquarters of the VPA 141st Regiment at P√≤ L√®o, which was 1.5 km to the northeast. By 2 March, Chinese forces had secured most of the hills around L·∫°ng S∆°n, having the city virtually besieged. At Kh√°nh Kh√™, they encountered elements of the VPA 337th Division, which had been sent to hold off Chinese movement against L·∫°ng S∆°n in the area.O'Dowd, p. 65. On 3 March, the Chinese launched their final assault on L·∫°ng S∆°n. Contemporarily, the VPA 3rd Division, presumably followed by the 42nd Regiment, had been ordered to withdraw from the city and incorporated into the newly founded 5th Corps, which consisted of the 3rd, 327th, 337th, 338th, and 347th Divisions, for the purpose of future operations.O'Dowd, p. 87. The 12th Regiment, which had been cut off from the rest of the 3rd Division, was assigned to continue defending enclaves along Highway 1B. The Chinese 127th Division advanced across the K·ª≥ C√πng River at Phi√™ng Ph√∫c along a line through the hills west of Highway 1B, swiftly overrunning the defense on M√™ Mai Hill on its way before capturing the Mai Pha airfield and Hill 391 on the southeast on 4 March.Zhang, p. 107. On the same day, Hills 332, 317, and 382 fell to two reserve battalions from the 50th Army. The 163rd Division crossed the river between Kh·ªßi Kh√∫c and Kh√≤n P√°t, penetrating 5 km south of L·∫°ng S∆°n to Pac Meng, a movement which had become the furthest advance toward Hanoi direction. On 5 March, the PLA 127th and 129th Divisions entered Lang Son City. The bridge over the K·ª≥ C√πng River destroyed after the Chinese occupation of L·∫°ng S∆°n Withdrawal After L·∫°ng S∆°n had been occupied, fighting still went on in L·ªôc B√¨nh and the town of M√≥ng C√°i in Qu·∫£ng Ninh Province. On 5 March, the Chinese government announced the withdrawal of troops from Vietnam. During their withdrawal, Chinese forces had destroyed the bridge south of L·∫°ng S∆°n.Chen, p. 111. Vietnamese units in L·∫°ng S∆°n, though badly mauled after previous clashes, still continued their fight against Chinese troops. The VPA 327th, 337th, and 338th Divisions, which had been positioned southerly near Chi LƒÉng to prevent a possible Chinese breakthrough, were finally committed to the battle for a counter-attack. The 337th and 338th pursued and harassed Chinese forces as they were pulling back and returning to Chinese territory across Chi Ma. Aftermath Similar to those of the whole war, the casualty figures of both sides in the battle for L·∫°ng S∆°n are controversial: while Vietnamese sources claimed to have put 19,000 Chinese troops out of action, an after-battle report from the PLA 55th Army only admitted 1,271 killed and 3,779 wounded for the Chinese side in clashes around ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng and L·∫°ng S∆°n. The Chinese also put the number of Vietnamese casualties during the battle at 10,401.Zhang, p. 108. According to Vietnamese documentation, the numbers of KIA and WIA of the VPA 3rd Division were respectively equivalent to 6.6% and 8.4% of its strength; each of the other divisions participating in the later phases reportedly suffered several hundreds killed. Even though the PLA claimed the destruction of several Vietnamese regular units,„ÄäÂØπË∂äËá™Âç´ÂèçÂáª‰ΩúÊàòÂ∑•‰ΩúÊÄªÁªì„ÄãWork summary on counter strike (1979‚Äì1987) published by the rear service of Chinese Kunming Military Region Chinese execution of their campaign proved both ineffective and inefficient, as the PLA's outdated tactics did not translate into rapid advance, and its numerous casualties were exchanged for relatively small gains.O'Dowd, p. 88. Despite their heavy losses from the battles in Vietnamese border provinces, the PLA declared that the road to Hanoi was now open and that their goal had been achieved, and withdrew from Vietnam back towards the Sino-Vietnamese border, marking the conclusion of the war.

He has made numerous contributions to the fields of ceramics, superconductors, dielectrics, catalysis, thermoelectrics, multiferroics, ionic conductors, and organic synthesis. His notable discoveries include: zeolites as precursors to electronic ceramics, new Bi and Tl-containing superconductors, catalysts for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), colossal dielectrics (CCTO), colossal magnetoresistance (GMR) oxides, and skutterudite thermoelectrics. His work on fluoroaromatic synthesis is one of his most notable achievements. In 2006, Subramanian joined Oregon State University as the Milton Harris Chair Professor of Materials Science, where his research is dedicated to the design and synthesis of novel functional materials for emerging applications in energy, environment, and electronics. He and his team, at Oregon State University, work on various topics such as pigments, thermoelectrics, high-temperature superconductivity, magnetoresistivity, solid fast ion conductors, high-K dielectrics, and topological insulators. In 2009, his team discovered a novel durable blue pigment, YInMn Blue, the first discovery of a new blue pigment since cobalt was discovered in 1802. Subramanian has given several public lectures all over the world on YInMn Blue, including TEDxSalem and TEDxUNC. This discovery has been featured in various international media outlets (such as The New York Times, TIME, National Geographic, Smithsonian, Bloomberg Businessweek, and WBUR), and has attracted global attention from corporations and museums, like Nike, Crayola, and the Harvard Art Museum. Subramanian has served as a member of the editorial board for the Journal of Materials Chemistry (1995-2001), Chemistry of Materials (2000-2006), Materials Research Bulletin (2006‚Äìpresent), and the Journal of Solid State Chemistry (2009‚Äìpresent), and is continues to serve as an editor for two international academic journals, Solid State Sciences, and Progress in Solid State Chemistry.

Early life She was born on 3 November 1865 at Young, New South Wales. She was one of five children of John Creal, an Irish born miner and Ann (n√©e Brady) also of Irish descent. In 1872 when Rose was seven years old, her mother and newborn brother died. She was educated at home by her father until the age of 16 when she began a job in a small hospital in Parkes, New South Wales. She worked there for many years and was appointed as a member of the Australian Army Nursing Service Reserve. She enlisted for war service on 14 August 1916 and arrived in Egypt on 23 September 1916. She served as a nurse for three years during the Great War and returned to Australia during January 1920. She died almost a year and a half later on 7 August 1921 after an attack of appendicitis.¬π  Nursing  Rose Ann Creal began working at a small hospital in Parkes at the young age of 16¬π. The matron of the hospital in Parkes described Rose as \\"a diamond of the first water\\". Recognizing the quality and potential of her young assistant, the matron at the Hospital in Parkes arranged for Rose to be taken on as a probationer at Sydney Hospital. Then by 1891 she was head nurse of a ward. When the hospital's matron resigned in 1898, Senior Sister Creal was made an acting matron. Her appointment was confirmed in February 1899 and later that year she became a founding member and councillor of the Trained Nurses' Association of New South Wales. Rose Creal participated in many events in Australia at the turn of the 20th century, including military nursing. Nurses who joined the AANS (Australian Imperial Force) during peacetime and attended prescribed lectures were the first to be called upon when World War I broke out in August 1914. These civilian trained nurses, including Creal, were known as 'efficient' Creal became the principal matron of the 2nd Military District. Creal's role in this position was to complete her main duties and she, like a number of hospital matrons, was feeling the effects of nursing staff shortages due to the high levels of nursing recruits to the war effort. Matron Creal in Egypt during WWI  World War I  Before, World War 1 Rose was a member of the Australian Army Nursing service reserve. In October 1914 she was given the role of principal matron of the second military district located in New South Wales while she was still the matron at the Sydney Hospital¬π. On 14 August 1916 Matron Creal enlisted for war service nominating her sister Elizabeth (‚ÄòBessie‚Äô) as her next of kin. She worked on the Hospital Ship (Karoola) on 19 August 1916 and started her duty of matron of the 14th Australian General Hospital at Abbassia Egypt on 23 September.¬π The casualties of the Australian Light Horse were treated as a priority, and in November 1916 were up to about 570 people. Following heavy fighting at Magdhaba and Rafa the casualties rose to over 900 and by May 1917, after the battle of Gaza, to 1140. Due to the large number of casualties it placed great pressure on the nursing staff. In her report for September 1917, Creal paid tribute to the nurses' selfless devotion to duty, after the first battle of Gaza when some of the nurses worked for eighteen hours at a time. When the hospital moved to Port Said in February 1918, Miss Rose Creal was known for the way she welcomed the injured soldiers as they arrived at the hospital and dedicated herself to their care. H.S. Gullett said \\"No womanhood has ever presented a richer association of feminine tenderness and shear capacity\\"¬π. The hospital in Parkes had several nurses who served during World War One with Sister Isobel Rose Smith, Sister Mary Ann Hutton, Matron Rose Ann Creal, Sister Florence Lynch and Sister Grace Linda Tomlinson all either leaving from the Parkes Shire or upon returning from service came to call the Parkes Shire their home.  Awards and recognition  For her work in Egypt, Rose Ann Creal was awarded the Royal Red Cross (First class) in the supplement 31093 of The London Gazette. In August and September of 1919 she completed an elocution course and tour of hospitals in England and Scotland \\"with the view of becoming conversant in the latest methods employed in these countries\\".¬≥ Sydney Hospital established the Rose Creal Medal in her honour; it is the highest award for students of the Lucy Osborn School of Nursing. Creal Place, in the Canberra suburb of Chisholm, is named in her honour.  Death  On 7 August 1921 Rose Ann Creal died from appendicitis. She was accorded a military funeral, one or the largest funerals the city had seen in a long time. Hundreds of people attended the funeral lining the streets outside the church. Rose Ann Creal's coffin was mounted on a gun carriage and draped with the Union Jack, with her nurse's cap on top.

Life Margaret Gilpin Reid was born in 1896 in Cardale, Manitoba in Canada, and completed a degree in Home Economics at the University of Manitoba in 1921. She received her PhD from the University of Chicago in 1931 titled The Economics of Household Production. She taught at Connecticut College, Iowa State College (Iowa State University) and later the University of Chicago, where she received tenure as a Professor of Home Economics and Economics. She became emeritus in 1961. Reid served as an economic advisor to the Division of Statistical Standards during 1943 and 1944. She served as the Head of Family Economics for the Department of Agriculture. She returned to academia in 1948 as a full professor in economics at the University of Chicago. She was also a member of the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities. Economics Margaret G. Reid was a pioneer in the research on the importance of non-market activities, especially of the household for the economy. Her work included household production and consumption, relationships between health, income and productivity and housework. Her first book, Economics of Household Production, was published in 1934. Reid, like her PhD advisor Hazel Kyrk, sought to theorize the productive contribution made by domestic activities within the household. She was arguing for a national accounting that included non-market activities to better mirror economic activities. Furthermore, she called for the recognition of unpaid work and delivered a pragmatic definition for work itself as activities that have a positive utility and could be transferred through a market (even if they are not produced for a market). Feminist economists would later argue that this work was underappreciated and even ignored, pointing out its similarity to Gary Becker's 1965 Nobel-prize winning theory of time allocation. After becoming emeritus, she continued to research and write until her death in 1991. In later years her work was preoccupied with the relationship between demographic factors such as age, race, health, and income, and productivity and consumption. The American Economic Association named Reid a Distinguished Fellow in 1980, recognizing her as a \\"truly tireless colleague\\" whose contributions to the field were complemented by a \\"felicitous sense of humour.\\" In 1996 Feminist Economics devoted an issue to recognizing her research.

Professor Roland Scott invited him as Annual Visiting Professor to Howard University College of Medicine, and as Honorary Consultant to its Centre for Sickle Cell Disease, Washington DC.\\"DR FELIX I D KONOTEY- AHULU CURRICULUM VITAE\\", September 2002.  Honours and awards  * Konotey- Ahulu was one of the recipients of the Dr Martin Luther King Jr. Foundation Award \\"for outstanding research in Sickle Cell Anaemia\\" (other recipients included Roland B Scott, Linus Pauling (Nobel Prize-winner), Herman Lehmann, Bela Ringelhann, James E. Bowman, Max Perutz (Nobel Prize-winner), J. V. Neel, Charles Whitten, and Graham Serjeant, in Philadelphia 1972, when Konotey-Ahulu was chosen to give the keynote address). * In 1974 he was awarded the Gold Medal of the Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences of which he was a Fellow (FGA), for \\"the most outstanding contribution to knowledge in the Medical Sciences by a Ghanaian between 1952 and 1973\\". * In 1976 in London he received the Guinness Award for Scientific Achievement (GASA) in the Commonwealth \\"in recognition of his work in applying science to the service of the community\\". * In November 1999, he received from President Abdou Diouf of Senegal the 1998 Third World Academy of Sciences Award for outstanding work in the Basic Medical Sciences. The citation of this Trieste-based TWAS Award noted not only his \\"outstanding contributions to haemoglobinopathy\\" but also his \\"first description of some 5 new physical signs in Clinical Medicine, invention of the 'Male Procreative Superiority Index' (MPSI) which shed some light on aspects of African Anthropogenetics, and for his insistence on an ethical dimension to genetic programmes, and highlighting public health measures as the best tool for long-term sickle-cell patient management.\\" Reading in New African (August/September 2004) that he was voted among \\"The One Hundred Greatest Africans Of All Time\\", he promptly pleaded in the October issue that he be replaced by Aggrey of Africa, whom he proved by a 1,600-word article to be altogether more worthy of such honour. In September 2005, he gave five consecutive public lectures at the British Council Accra, on Contemporary Health Issues, in commemoration of the 115th anniversary of the Scripture Union in Ghana.  African health research  In March 1998, Konotey-Ahulu was appointed Chief Visiting Clinician/Scientist, Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI), and he is on the Editorial Board of the African Journal of Health Sciences of The African Forum of Health Sciences. Between 1965 and 2005 he published more than 200 articles, letters, editorials, book reviews, and comments. He has been round Sub-Saharan African countries studying AIDS, and has published What is AIDS? (227 pages), The Sickle Cell Disease Patient (643 pages), and one booklet, Sickle Cell Disease ‚Äì The Case For Family Planning (32 pages). Ghana's Managing Trustees of the VALCO Trust Fund supported much of his research. Konotey-Ahulu is a former examiner at the University of Ghana Medical School. In April 2000, he was appointed \\"Dr Kwegyir Aggrey Distinguished Professor of Human Genetics, University of Cape Coast, Ghana\\" after having been awarded an honorary DSc degree. His inaugural lecture was titled \\"Human Genetics and the Ghanaian African: How The New Genetics Affects You\\". In 2000 he was elected Fellow of the Third World Academy of Sciences. In June 1973 he was invited to join The World Council of Churches' Consultation on Genetics and Quality of Life, chaired by Dr Robert Edwards, and more than 30 years later he is still in contact with Bob Edwards through the Ethics Committee of the Cromwell Hospital, London, where Konotey-Ahulu was Consultant Physician from 1983 to July 2005. To present the African viewpoint in an International Symposium on \\"The Human Genome Diversity Project\\", published by Politics and The Life Sciences (PLS), Lake Superior State University, USA, in September 1999 he titled his paper \\"The Human Genome Diversity Project: Cogitations of an African Native\\" (pages 317‚Äì322), where he traced the sickle- cell gene in his ancestry, with patients' names, generation by generation back to AD 1670, aided by the fact that the hereditary rheumatic syndrome was known to African tribes by specific onomatopoeic names (', ', ', ', ') for centuries before it was first described in the USA in 1910. This exercise in genetic genealogy, rare in medical archives, helped Konotey-Ahulu develop a discipline of genetic epidemiology to show how polygamy in his forebears produced gene combinations with variations in phenotypic expression of the hereditary syndrome. His invention of the Male Procreative Superiority Index (MPSI), which shed new light on African anthropogenetics, is the result of this personalised genetic epidemiology. In October 2002, the South African Medical Research Council, with Georgetown University, Washington DC, invited him to take part in an International Conference on \\"Developing Sustainable Health Care Delivery Systems in Africa for the New Millennium\\". He spoke on two topics: \\"An African Physician's Personal Analysis of his Continent's Sustainable Health Care Delivery Prognosis for the New Millennium\\", and \\"Setting Priorities and Overcoming Obstacles: AIDS in Africa ‚Äì Obstacles to Health Care Delivery\\".  Linguistics  Konotey-Ahulu has recently developed a method for writing African tonal languages, explained in a book titled Mother Tongue ‚Äì Introducing The Tadka Phonation Technique For Speaking An African Tonal Language: Krobo/Dangme-Ga of South-East Ghana (82 pages ‚Äì . T-A‚ÄôD Co Watford, UK, 2001). The book aims to help educate some Africans to read their own language more easily and quickly than has hitherto been possible. It will also explain the basic principles of Public Health information about genetic and acquired disease to those who do not read English, and promises to be a great tool in adult education. If it proved helpful, the book would be translated into French and Portuguese.  Christianity  Professor Konotey-Ahulu is a Christian, plays the piano, and has written a Millennium Hymn of seven verses, complete with melody, entitled \\"Time Was Created\\",\\"MILLENNIUM HYMN Time Was Created\\", YouTube. which the University of Cape Coast Choir sang after his inaugural address. He is a staunch biblical creationist, and has ably defended the truth of Christianity in the Ghanaian Times and the British Medical Journal. His faith also means that he is strongly pro-life, and has denounced genetic testing for sickle- cell disease with a view to aborting babies with the disease. Most recently, he has answered the latest antitheistic propaganda from Richard Dawkins and the racist arguments from James Watson.Dr Konotey-Ahulu, \\"Response to Richard Dawkins‚Äô The God Delusion interview\\", Creation Ministries International, 23 September 2006.Felix I D Konotey-Ahulu, \\"Tonal Languages, Genetics, Human Race and James Watson's Clanger\\", Creation Ministries International.  Career and accomplishments  The value of Professor Konotey-Ahulu's work as a global authority on sickle-cell disease, including some discoveries in Clinical Medicine, has been widely recognized by medical practitioners and specialists around the world, leading to his inclusion in a survey of \\"The 100 Greatest Africans of All Time\\". He has produced more than 200 publications, a number of which have become the definitive studies in their field.\\"Publications: Articles\\" at sicklecell.md.Felix I.D.

The TechPort system was created in response to a request by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), resulting in the NASA Performance Goal 3.4.1.5 and APG 3.4.1.5: ST-12-17. As part of its mission, TechPort stores research and development: * Progress * Funding levels and budget data * Management information * Purpose * Benefits to the nation * Benefits to the Agency * Benefits to the Industry * Status (e.g. completed, cancelled, active) TechPort also, per the FY2012 Performance goals, contains NASA's Technology Roadmaps, including the 2012 Technology Roadmap and 2015 Technology Roadmap. Research and development can then be compared with the roadmap(s), ensuring that the research matches the roadmap and budget allocations are inline with roadmap priorities. To ensure compliance, TechPort includes interfaces for humans (the main website), search engines (via sitemaps), and machine readable APIs that follow JSON or XML standards (/api/specifications detailing the API's specification, /api/projects listing all ids, and /api/project/{id}[.{format}] providing the machine-readable data for that item in either XML or JSON, with JSON being used if no extension is given). As of March 2018, the public instance of TechPort contains 10,677 research and development records.  History of TechPort  On October 28, 2011, the United States President Barack Obama charged all Federal agencies with streamlining and speeding up technology transfer activities. OMB, like-wise, demanded that Agencies release to the public information about currently funded research programs and projects to aid in collaboration both within the public sector and between the public and private sector, as well as better track the progress of all technology development both within the Agency and to Congress. The NASA Office of the Chief Technologist (OCT), which had been created in 2010, was given the task of creating and managing the system(s) that would fulfil these requirements under the NASA 2012 Performance Goal 3.4.1.5 and APG 3.4.1.5: ST-12-17. In late 2012, TechPort, a complementary system to the NASA New Technology Reports (NTR) database, was released internally to all NASA civil servants and contractors. A public version of the system, with 'sensitive' information removed (e.g. budget data and management information) was initially scheduled to be released in the fall of 2013, however the public system was, instead, released as a public 'beta' on March 3, 2015, after completeness of the data was determined and the system was utilized by NASA personnel for approximately two years. As of 2014, TechPort continues to be a key part of NASA's Strategic Plan, wherein NASA established the next steps for Strategic Objective 2.3.  TechPort 1.0  TechPort 1.0 Home Page The first major release of TechPort was only made available to NASA users and contract staff who were on a NASA installation's internal network or VPN. The first release included the ability to create, review, and update information related to NASA research and development (R&D;) efforts; to search existing records; and to run a variety of reports against the data in the system. The main purpose of this release was to pull in data from like systems (e.g. EHB and SBIR), to get additional data and R&D; information not in like systems from the NASA community, and to allow NASA personnel to review the data and system prior to public release, which began compliance with the OMB requirements. Multiple data calls occurred following the release to achieve the main goals.  TechPort 2.0  TechPort 2.0 Home Page - Public Release The second major release of TechPort came with new features and reports for NASA users and contract staff, such as the inclusion of NASA Roadmaps, reports related to the Roadmaps, inclusion of Strategic Technology Investment Plan (STIP) data, a new user interface, and saw the release of TechPort to the general public as a public beta. This release also saw the inclusion of some additional internal fields, such as the Fingerprints section, and the removal and modification of others that had been in the first release, but were rarely used. The inclusion of NASA Roadmaps into the system and the release to the public, though in beta, allowed NASA and TechPort to meet the OMB requirements that had been the precursor for the system's creation.  TechPort 3.0  TechPort 3.0 Home Page - Public Release The third major release of TechPort came with a variety of adjustments based on user feedback, to include a clean user interface, a providing a user dashboard for the home page (with two versions‚Äîone for the internal system and one for the public system), a more flexible API that defaults to JSON unless an .xml extension is given, and the reduction of fields to increase usability. This release also saw the collapsing of some of the data fields and an improved search interface, as well as improvements to the sitemaps. Much of the emphasis of the release was to better aid researchers and collaborators both internal to NASA and in the public, as well as a heavy push to ensure data quality and accuracy. The release also saw the renaming of and adjustments to many of the URLs, such as changing the API from /xml-api/ to /api/ and improving speed and reliability of the system, to better aid researchers and organizations that are searching TechPort via the system's built-in search engine or harvesting data via a bot. The last major change in this release was that the public version no longer stated it was a beta release and is responsive.  Awards  In 2015, the TechPort development team, led by ARES Corporation with REI Systems, Tauri Group, and inQbation as subcontractors, was awarded the Group Achievement Award for their work on the TechPort system. In 2018, the TechPort development team, led by ARES Corporation with REI Systems and Bryce, was awarded the NASA Space Flight Awareness Team Award for their work on the TechPort system. In 2019, the TechPort development team, led by ARES Corporation with REI Systems and Bryce, was nominated for the Rotary National Award for Space Achievement (RNASA) Stellar Team Award for \\"Outstanding accomplishment and teamwork in the creation, implementation and operation of NASA‚Äôs Technology Portfolio application (TechPort) that has enhanced NASA technology communication across the world.\\" References NASA oversight NASA online ","title":"TechPort (NASA)"},{"id":"48479380","text":"The Stormy Night () is a 2015 Chinese horror thriller film directed by Liu Tianrong.

Inspired by the Washington‚Äôs Newseum (USA), it was inaugurated in the first minutes of 25 April 2016, in an event attended by the President of the Portuguese Republic, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa. It occupies the former facilities of the Museu do Brinquedo (Toy Museum) and presents, in a physical but also virtual space, a history of the media and journalism evolution. The Acta Diurna association, which promotes the project and is presided by Lu√≠s Paix√£o Martins, has invested approximately 1.8 million euros in the museum. The project also has the support of Sintra‚Äôs city council, which lent the property in the historic center to the association, for 20 years.  Features  NewsMuseum 360¬∫ vision at the Lounge The \\"Pyramid of Babel\\" tv screens The experience begins outside, where visitors can find a statue of the journalist and writer E√ßa de Queiroz, staring at his smartphone. In more than 25 thematic areas, spread across the building¬¥s three floors, episodes of the history of Portugal and the World are remembered through their media coverage. There are more than 300 consultation articles and a total of 16 hours of information/entertainment and multimedia, always in an interactive approach that allows the visitor not only to see, but also to take part in the stories. NewsMuseum aims to be a Media Age Experience, an open window into the world of media and communication, and their impact on society, using a strong digital and technological component. All of the content is available in Portuguese and English, making the project truly bilingual.  Thematic areas  The Lounge, one of NewsMuseum's most iconic rooms, tells stories through a touch screen of 67m2, one of the largest in the world, and features a 360 ¬∞ view for an innovative experience while watching v√≠deos. The War Journalism's area, curated by the journalist Jos√© Rodrigues dos Santos, recreates the balcony where reporters covered the first night of the Gulf War, and reviews the close connection of different media with the most significant conflicts in contemporary world history. In the room dedicated to Duels, visitors can remember great media duels, in an area about the rivalries that the media portrayed, such as the famous debate between M√°rio Soares and √Ålvaro Cunhal after the \\"hot summer\\" of 1975. In the thematic area regarding Propaganda, it is possible to remember the most emblematic propagandists, including Ant√≥nio Ferro, and the critics of this communication tool. Visitors can also see iconic political posters and even post some of them on the NewsMuseum wall. In the Sports room, the highlight goes to the media careers of Eus√©bio and Cristiano Ronaldo, as well as for the exhibition \\"8 Best of: Best Sports Moments\\", dedicated to great Portuguese sports moments, like Eder's goal at Euro 2016, Rosa Mota and Carlos Lopes's victories at the 1988 and 1984 Olympic Games or Rui Costa's 2013 World Cycling Champion title. The choice resulted from an online vote conducted by the Portuguese newspaper Record, partner in the project, and the opening of the exhibition on 19 November 2019, was attended by Portugal‚Äôs Minister of Education, Tiago Brand√£o Rodrigues. The thematic area dedicated to the Radio allows visitors to enter a radio booth and read a MFA [military movement] statement on the microphone, reproducing the atmosphere lived in the early hours of April 25,1974. Through the \\"Pyramid of Babel\\", a metallic tower with 69 television screens, one can watch the main news channels from around the globe. News from national and international media are projected in real time on one of the walls. An interactive globe allows NewsMuseum visitors to discover the press freedom index throughout the world. Some of the most notable personalities of the Portuguese journalism are remembered through multimedia content, in a thematic area that includes testemonials from various professionals in the field. There are also areas dedicated to photojournalism, \\"bad news\\", marketing and public relations. As well as an \\"objects from the past\\" exhibit: 1950s camcorders, professional record players, telexes, and replicas of clothes worn by newscasters, provided by RTP, LUSA, and EFE. Along the three floors there are several Fun Zones, including a Rubik's cube where visitors can make the front page of a newspaper, according to their answers on questions about journalistic ethics. Manuela Moura Guedes tests the visitors‚Äô media culture, in a contest about the world of communication. NewsMuseum also proposes a journey to the future through virtual reality glasses, an 8-minute experience that transports the visitor through current and future journalism. The media experience extends to all NewsMuseum spaces, including the elevator, where visitors can hear, among others, the speech of Robot Sofia, in which she communicates the attribution of her nationality to Saudi Arabia. Also the \\"most famous journalists on the planet\\" - Tintin and Clark Kent (Superman) - compose a panel with illustrations and v√≠deos.  Temporary exhibitions  On 25 April 2017, NewsMuseum inaugurated the exhibition \\"Macho Media\\", an interactive multimedia show around the main milestones and media episodes of the fight against machismo and female emancipation.  Education services  The museum also has a small auditorium and a space for \\"live\\" television broadcasts, areas dedicated to schools, with the aim of making media literacy among the younger ones. The visit also includes a short \\"class\\" with one of the curators, such as Manuel Falc√£o, Jos√© Rodrigues dos Santos and Paula Cordeiro, on a previously selected theme, such as War Journalism, Social Networks, The Radio, The Future of the Media, Towards Danger (September 11 Documentary), The Digital World: Wikileaks, The Berlin Wall and the Press.  NewsMuseum Library  NewsMuseum also promotes the NewsMuseum Library, an initiative with the support of Chiado Editora, that gathers books related to journalism, media and communication. On 15 October 2015, the first two books of the NewsMuseum Library were presented at Escola Superior de Comunica√ß√£o Social, in Lisbon: Novo Dicion√°rio da Comunica√ß√£o, an encyclopaedia of several generations of journalism and media terms, as well as Tinha tudo para correr mal, Lu√≠s Paix√£o Martins professional memoirs.

He alternated between the posts of Minister of Justice and Minister of Health from 1936 to 1940. Although he was not pro-feminist he introduced changes that gave greater opportunity to women. He was anti-racist, and after the initial defeat of France in World War II he did not support the Vichy government but participated in the National Council of the Resistance and then in the first Consultative Assembly. After the war he was a senator from 1947 to 1958. Early years (1893‚Äì1928) Marc √âmile Rucart was born on 24 July 1893 in Coulommiers, Seine-et-Marne. Rucart made his first journalistic efforts when he was aged 17. In 1914 he edited the Loiret Progr√®s. He moved to Paris where he contributed to the Le Radical, La Lanterne and Progr√®s civique. After returning to the province he became director of Paul Doumer's La Tribune, and then editor of the Vosges R√©publique. Inter-war politics (1928‚Äì37) In 1928 Rucart ran for election as deputy in the √âpinal constituency as candidate of the Radical Socialist party, and was elected in the first round. He was elected as deputy in the first round in 1932 and 1936. As deputy he was particularly interested in defense issues. He was also rapporteur of the inquiry into the Oustric Affair and general rapporteur of the inquiry into the 6 February 1934 crisis. He edited the report on the official investigation into the 6 February 1934 events, published by the Chamber on 17 May 1939. He helped defend the rights of Vietnamese who believed in Caodaism. Rucart appointed was Minister of Justice from 4 June 1936 to 21 June 1937 in the 1st cabinet of L√©on Blum. Rucart helped accelerate the process of naturalizing immigrants from Eastern Europe and Germany. Rucart worked with Roger Salengro, Minister of the Interior, and Jean Lebas, Minister of Labor, to help refugees from Nazi Germany who had found their way into France. By decree of 17 September 1936 they were given identity certificates and protected from arbitrary expulsion from the country. In the fall of 1936 a report from Rucart's office drew attention to the delays in the process of granting citizenship and the resultant huge backlog. Rucart said this was \\"intolerable\\" given the low birthrate in France and the increasing vulnerability to attack. He obtained funding for additional staff to process the applications. Rucart said in the Spring of 1937 \\"I have wanted naturalization policy to take into account, above all else, the needs of national defense. I believe it is now time to facilitate the accession to French nationality of all able-bodied and perfectly honest adults under the age of 30 who have been suitable for military service.\\" He reduced the role of the Conf√©d√©ration des Syndicats M√©dicaux in approving applications by doctors. He wrote in a circular to prefects that they should remind the professional associations that they should only be concerned with reviewing professional qualifications. The medical profession strongly resisted his efforts to streamline to process. Minister of Health (1937‚Äì40) Rucart replaced the popular and energetic Henri Sellier as Minister of Health when the Blum cabinet resigned in June 1937. The change may in part have been to reduce the number of socialists in the government, but may also have been a reaction to Sellier's efforts to suppress regulated prostitution. Rucart was Minister of Health from 22 June 1937 to 10 March 1938 in the 3rd and 4th cabinets of Camille Chautemps, then briefly Minister of Justice from 13 March 1938 to 8 April 1938 in L√©on Blum's second cabinet. He was again Minister of Health from 10 April 1938 to 20 March 1940 in the 3rd cabinet of √âdouard Daladier. As Minister of Health Rucart instituted various reforms including regulations for the nursing profession, the general inspectorate for public health and the National Red Cross Council. He created national bonuses for births. In February 1938 Rucart stated that the Chautemps government favored greater efforts to encourage births, but its view was that creating prosperity was the best way to increase the birthrate. He said, \\"Our peoples are too advanced to agree happily to bring children into the world whose lives may be threatened by unemployment, poverty, sickness or war. The pro-natalist lobby objected to this position, since they felt the parents of large families should be favored over those who had none. In October 1937 Rucart created the Higher Council for the Protection of Children, with the mandate of coordinating public and private services, the different government agencies and the League of Nations commissions. With the imminent defeat of the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì39), refugees began to flood into France in January 1939. They received a charitable welcome. Rucart toured the border with Albert Sarraut, the Minister of Interior. They commented on \\"how the local authorities had met the challenge, and how they had coped with unprecedented difficulties.\\" Rucart removed obstacles to women progressing from deputy inspectors to full inspecteurs in public assistance services. He said the performance of women as deputy inspectors had shown \\"the competence and authority required of a chef de service, this combination of qualities not depending in any way on the sex of the individual, but on moral and professional worth.\\" He noted that women had \\"qualities of generosity and thoughtfulness which suit her particularly to work with children and especially unfortunate children.\\" He dismissed the objection that women did not have the physical stamina for the job, since the automobile had removed that need, and dismissed the issue of the legal inferiority of women to men when acting as guardians designated by the prefect of a department on the basis that the guardianship was assigned to the inspecteur, not to the man or woman who held the post. Rucart was not committed to the feminist cause. The law of 9 April 1938 that allowed women to become inspecteurs imposed a ceiling of 50% of chief departmental inspectors. He was angered by the street demonstrations organized by Louise Weiss in the 1930s, and told her much later \\"The right to vote does away with the right of insurrection, Madame ... Had you not read Victor Hugo?\\" He was nonplussed when Weiss reminded him that at the time women in France did not have the right to vote. Rucart was known for being anti-racist. The Daladier cabinet did not introduce any laws that discriminated against Jews, but issued a decree banning incitement of religious or racial hatred. Marshal Philippe P√©tain's government annulled the decree soon after taking power in Vichy. World War II (1939‚Äì45) Rucart abstained from the vote to give P√©tain full powers on 10 July 1940. He created a first cell of the French Resistance in Paris. In January 1941 he was arrested and imprisoned in Cherche-Midi and then in Fresnes. He was released for lack of evidence, and formed the Patriam Recuperare group. After being denounced he moved to the southern zone and helped organize the Resistance in Toulouse. In May 1943 he returned to Paris to represent the Radical Socialist party in the National Council of the Resistance. Rucart made his way to London and then to Algiers, where in November 1943 he became a member of the provisional Consultative Assembly. Rucart was among the traditionalists who felt that it was imperative to maintain the rights of parliament, but this group did not have the weight to override the Gaullists, who did not want to impose and handicaps on General Charles de Gaulle as leader of Free France. The Consultative Assembly, as its name implied, did not have much power but could debate government proposals and often caused improvements to the wording. Rucart was outspoken, but would not undermine de Gaulle. Rucart chaired the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Consultative Assembly. In this capacity he attended the Colonial Conference on Brazzaville in January 1944. He was then president of the Radical Socialist party until the Liberation of France. When the Consultative Assembly first sat in Paris in November 1944, Rucart was founder and president of the group of the Democratic Radicals and Radical Socialists. Later career (1945‚Äì64) Marc Rucart had significant stakes in several French trading companies in French West Africa in the late 1940s. The governor-general made every effort to meet his needs. Rucart was elected Councilor of the Republic for C√¥te-d'Ivoire in the first round of votes on 13 January 1947 on the list of the Rally of Left Republicans. He became president of the committee on Overseas France. He was elected to the Senate for the newly formed constituency of French Upper Volta on 14 November 1948. He was reelected on 18 May 1952. He voted for the constitutional amendment on 2‚Äì3 June 1958 that was the basis for the French Fifth Republic. He failed to be reelected on 8 June 1958. Rucart became a high-grade Freemason. He was president of the professional union of editors in chief, and an honorary member of the central committee of the Human Rights League. He was a knight of the Legion of Honour. Marc Rucart died on 23 January 1964 in Paris.

Benton's lawyers in her 2007 trial were Rick DeToto, Kent Schaffer, and Brian Wice, described by Hollandsworth as \\"prominent\\". Wice was the first attorney in contact with Benton, and DeToto and Wice recruited Schaffer due to his experience in criminal defense cases; he was known for defending prominent individuals in several criminal trials. The defense would have had a cost of $150,000 ($ according to inflation), but DeToto, Schaffer, and Wice agreed to represent Benton pro bono due to the low income status of her mother.

Magness and Wice regarded one another as quality lawyers.

Brian Rogers of the Houston Chronicle stated that the \\"basic facts\\" surrounding Granillo's death \\"were undisputed\\". The dispute was regarding the nature of the death. Mia Magness accused Benton of deliberately trying to attack Granillo, while Benton's attorneys stated that Granillo was not running away from her and that the MS-13 members saying that she attacked Granillo were lying. One MS-13 member, after questioning from Schaffer, admitted that he did not see Granillo running away. The prosecutor stated that the taped confession had her admit that Granillo was trying to leave, while her lawyers stated that Benton gave conflicting information in the confession. This trial resulted in a hung jury. About half of the jury members sided with Benton and the other half were against her after two days of deliberating the case. One of Benton's lawyers stated that five jurors believed Benton was guilty of murder while seven instead wanted to convict her of possession of a prohibited weapon.
