He was a pioneer of the documentary, educational, propaganda and scientific film, as well as being the producer of the world's first successful motion picture colour system.Silent nature documentary The Four Seasons (1921) by Charles Urban and Raymond Lee Ditmars, showing the cyclic changes in living nature through the four seasons with lyrical intertitles. Duration: 01:18:14. Intertitles in Dutch. Early life Urban was born Carl Urban in Cincinnati, Ohio, the second child (of ten) of Joseph Urban, originally from Ronsberg, Austro-Hungary, and Anna Sophie (n√©e Glatz), from K√∂nigsberg, East Prussia. He lost the sight in his left eye aged twelve after a baseball accident. He changed his names to Charles after leaving school in 1882, then worked as a book agent across Ohio, before managing a stationery store in Detroit, Michigan. Career Urban first entered the film industry in 1895 when he exhibited the Kinetoscope in Detroit, Michigan early in 1895. He moved to Britain in August 1897, and became managing director of the Warwick Trading Company, where he specialised in actuality film, including newsfilm of the Anglo-Boer War. In July 1903 he formed his own company, the Charles Urban Trading Company, moving to London's Wardour Street in 1908, the first film business to be located in what became the home of the British film industry. The building, at 89-91 Wardour Street, still bears the name Urbanora House.https://www.flickr.com/photos/78112161@N00/7223737470/ In August 1903, he launched his 'Unseen World' film show at the Alhambra Theatre in London, featuring microcinematographical films taken by F. Martin Duncan. Scientific films had never before been presented as entertainment to a variety theatre audience, but the show was a considerable success, in particular the film Cheese Mites which features cheese mites crawling around on a piece of Stilton. 'The Unseen World' went on to run for an unbroken nine months at the Alhambra and confirmed Urban's belief in the entertainment value of scientific and educational films. Urban made many kinds of non-fiction film at the Charles Urban Trading Company, including travel films, war reportage, exploration films, sports films, advertising films and natural history films. Filmmakers who worked for him include Jack Avery, Joseph Rosenthal, Charles Rider Noble, Harold Mease Lomas, the mountaineer Frank Ormiston-Smith, George Rogers, J. Gregory Mantle and the naturalist F. Percy Smith. Smith made one of Urban's most successful films, The Balancing Bluebottle (1908), which featured a fly balancing objects such as a wine cork with its legs. In 1906, Urban made a 1,275-feet documentary film called The Streets of London. The film shows Londoners going about their business on a typical day. Urban's own website states that ten minutes of footage rediscovered at the National Film and Sound Archive in Australia in 2007 is from this documentary. The National Film and Sound Archive claims, however, that film expert Ian Christie has identified it as being part of Urban's 1904 documentary Living London. He also made fiction films, of which the most notable examples are the proto-science fiction films of Walter R. Booth such as The Airship Destroyer (1909) and The Aerial Submarine (1910). Among his other business interests was a French production company in Paris called √âclipse, which Urban founded in 1906, mainly to supply fiction films. His connection with that company lasted until 1909. He also established Kineto Limited in 1907, primarily for the production of scientific and non-fiction films. Kinemacolor In 1906, his associate George Albert Smith (1864‚Äì1959) developed a two-colour (red-green) additive motion picture system, which Urban launched in May 1908. From 1909 it was known as Kinemacolor. This enjoyed great success worldwide until 1914. Urban's most celebrated Kinemacolor film was a 2 1/2 hour epic With Our King and Queen Through India (1912), also known as The Durbar in Delhi, depicting the December 1911 Delhi Durbar which celebrated the coronation of George V. Kinemacolor companies were formed in France, the USA, Germany, Switzerland, Brazil, Holland (with Belgium and Luxembourg), Italy, Canada and Japan. Of these the most prominent was the Kinemacolor Company of America, whose most notorious production was the unreleased The Clansman, a colour version of the Thomas Dixon story later filmed by D.W. Griffith as The Birth of a Nation. Urban had nothing to do with this film or with the Kinemacolor Company of America once he had sold the rights to Kinemacolor. He made Kinemacolor fiction films, with studios in Hove and Nice, including By Order of Napoleon (1910), the western Fate (1911), Santa Claus (1912) and the feature-length The World, the Flesh and the Devil (1914). He also produced a 33-minute-long Kimemacolor version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in 1913, but it was very sparsely exhibited.Kinnard,Roy (1995). \\"Horror in Silent Films\\". McFarland and Company Inc. . Page 54.Workman, Christopher; Howarth, Troy (2016). \\"Tome of Terror: Horror Films of the Silent Era\\". Midnight Marquee Press. p. 108. . Urban's Kinemacolor business came to an end in 1914 after a court case was brought by William Friese-Greene, producer of a rival colour system, Biocolour, who challenged the validity of the Kinemacolor patent. Though Urban won the initial hearing, the verdict was overturned on appeal. Lord Justice Buckley wrote: The patent is I think invalid because it does not achieve the result which the patentee says it will achieve. The matter may be summarised thus: The patentee says his process will reproduce the natural colours or approximately so. Blue is a colour. He says: Drop the tri-colour blue; do not employ the blue end of the spectrum - blue or approximately blue will still be reproduced. It will not. The patent is consequently invalid. Although Kinemacolor could still be operated, it was no longer an exclusive and lost much of its commercial value. Urban made his last Kinemacolor film in 1915, and the last film to feature Kinemacolor was probably Saiy√ªki zokuhen, made in Japan in 1917. World War I During World War I, Urban worked for the covert organisation Wellington House and other British propaganda outfits. He produced the documentary feature Britain Prepared (1915) for Wellington House, which included Kinemacolor sequences of the British fleet at Scapa Flow. Urban was recruited to promote this film and other British propaganda productions in America, although he faced considerable resistance from US exhibitors who were resistant to any form of war propaganda. He worked with the Patriotic Film Corporation, formed by William Robinson to support distribution of what had been retitled How Britain Prepared, but he ran into trouble with the British propagandists when he tried to do a deal with William Randolph Hearst's International News Service, which the British viewed as pro-German and anti- British.Luke McKernan, 'Propaganda, Patriotism and Profit: Charles Urban and British official war films in America during the First World War‚Äô, Film History vol. 14 nos. 3-4, 2002 Another company, Official Government Pictures, achieved better distribution by use of more sensationalist advertising, but Urban's task became much easier once America entered the war in April 1917. He edited the classic documentary The Battle of the Somme (1916), making the crucial decision to release the footage in feature-length form rather than as a series of short releases. Urban continued to edit and promote British documentary films in America to the end of the war, editing the government newsreel Official War Review. He formed a new business, the Kineto Company of America, in 1917. Later life Urban remained in the United States post-war to re-establish himself as a producer of educational films through his umbrella company, Urban Motion Picture Industries Inc. He produced the cinemagazine series Charles Urban Movie Chats (started 1919) and Kineto Review (started 1921), and made the documentary features The Four Seasons (1921) and Evolution (1923). He built a large studio at Irvington, New York, where he planned to introduce a new color film system called Kinekrom, based on the earlier Kinemacolor, and to distribute educational films on disc using the Spirograph. However, his business interests collapsed in 1924 and he returned to the UK in the late 1920s. He died in Brighton in 1942, at age 75, in relative obscurity.

He was a popular composer of chansons, and may have been a friend of Josquin des Prez. Life and work Nothing is known about his life except for a brief period during the late 1470s, although it is probable he was born in Picardy. He was one of the members of the famous Sforza chapel choir in Milan between 1474 and 1476, which included Alexander Agricola, Loyset Comp√®re and Johannes Martini, the time when this institution had one of the most famous groups of singers and composers in Europe. After the assassination of Galeazzo Sforza in 1476, he left Milan, as did most of the musicians; Japart went to Ferrara where he was quickly employed by Ercole I d'Este; not only did he become one of the most highly paid singers at the Ferrarese court, but the Duke gave him a house in Ferrara. By 1481 he was gone, and there is no further record of him. Japart was the composer of 23 chansons which are extant. A lost composition by Josquin, Revenu d'oultrements, Japart is often cited as evidence of a friendship between the two composers; if so, they probably met in Milan after 1481, since Josquin did not go to Italy until around 1484. Stylistically, Japart's music is influenced by Busnois, one of the earlier group of Burgundian composers. He was fond of the quodlibet, the combination of several pre-existing tunes in ingenious ways, and he also wrote puzzle canons -- compositions which the singers were intended to figure out from clues given in the text. For example, one of his chansons can only be performed correctly by transposing one of the parts down a twelfth and singing it in retrograde motion. (When a puzzle canon is solved correctly, the parts fit together without violation of the prevailing rules of counterpoint, which in the 15th century are described in the works of theorists such as Tinctoris.) Japart's music was evidently popular, since many of his chansons were reprinted by Petrucci and achieved wide distribution.

With N real scalar fields, we can have a \\\\varphi^4 model with a global SO(N) symmetry given by the Lagrangian :\\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\varphi_1,...,\\\\varphi_N)=\\\\frac{1}{2} [\\\\partial^\\\\mu \\\\varphi_a \\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\varphi_a - m^2 \\\\varphi_a \\\\varphi_a] -\\\\frac{1}{4} \\\\lambda (\\\\varphi_a \\\\varphi_a)^2, \\\\quad a=1,...,N. Expanding the complex field in real and imaginary parts shows that it is equivalent to the SO(2) model of real scalar fields. In all of the models above, the coupling constant \\\\lambda must be positive, since, otherwise, the potential would be unbounded below, and there would be no stable vacuum. Also, the Feynman path integral discussed below would be ill-defined. In 4 dimensions, \\\\phi^4 theories have a Landau pole. This means that without a cut-off on the high-energy scale, renormalization would render the theory trivial. Feynman integral quantization The Feynman diagram expansion may be obtained also from the Feynman path integral formulation.A general reference for this section is . The time ordered vacuum expectation values of polynomials in œÜ, known as the n-particle Green's functions, are constructed by integrating over all possible fields, normalized by the vacuum expectation value with no external fields, :\\\\langle\\\\Omega\\\\mathcal{T}\\\\\\\\{{\\\\phi}(x_1)\\\\cdots {\\\\phi}(x_n)\\\\\\\\}\\\\Omega\\\\rangle=\\\\frac{\\\\int \\\\mathcal{D}\\\\phi \\\\phi(x_1)\\\\cdots \\\\phi(x_n) e^{i\\\\int d^4x \\\\left({1\\\\over 2}\\\\partial^\\\\mu \\\\phi \\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\phi -{m^2 \\\\over 2}\\\\phi^2-{\\\\lambda\\\\over 4!}\\\\phi^4\\\\right)}}{\\\\int \\\\mathcal{D}\\\\phi e^{i\\\\int d^4x \\\\left({1\\\\over 2}\\\\partial^\\\\mu \\\\phi \\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\phi -{m^2 \\\\over 2}\\\\phi^2-{\\\\lambda\\\\over 4!}\\\\phi^4\\\\right)}}. All of these Green's functions may be obtained by expanding the exponential in J(x)œÜ(x) in the generating function :Z[J] =\\\\int \\\\mathcal{D}\\\\phi e^{i\\\\int d^4x \\\\left({1\\\\over 2}\\\\partial^\\\\mu \\\\phi \\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\phi -{m^2 \\\\over 2}\\\\phi^2-{\\\\lambda\\\\over 4!}\\\\phi^4+J\\\\phi\\\\right)} = Z[0] \\\\sum_{n=0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{1}{n!} \\\\langle\\\\Omega\\\\mathcal{T}\\\\\\\\{{\\\\phi}(x_1)\\\\cdots {\\\\phi}(x_n)\\\\\\\\}\\\\Omega\\\\rangle. A Wick rotation may be applied to make time imaginary. Changing the signature to (++++) then gives a œÜ4 statistical mechanics integral over a 4-dimensional Euclidean space, :Z[J]=\\\\int \\\\mathcal{D}\\\\phi e^{-\\\\int d^4x \\\\left({1\\\\over 2}( abla\\\\phi)^2+{m^2 \\\\over 2}\\\\phi^2+{\\\\lambda\\\\over 4!}\\\\phi^4+J\\\\phi\\\\right)}. Normally, this is applied to the scattering of particles with fixed momenta, in which case, a Fourier transform is useful, giving instead :\\\\tilde{Z}[\\\\tilde{J}]=\\\\int \\\\mathcal{D}\\\\tilde\\\\phi e^{-\\\\int d^4p \\\\left({1\\\\over 2}(p^2+m^2)\\\\tilde\\\\phi^2-\\\\tilde{J}\\\\tilde\\\\phi+{\\\\lambda\\\\over 4!}{\\\\int d^4p_1d^4p_2d^4p_3\\\\delta(p-p_1-p_2-p_3)\\\\tilde\\\\phi(p)\\\\tilde\\\\phi(p_1)\\\\tilde\\\\phi(p_2)\\\\tilde\\\\phi(p_3)}\\\\right)}. where \\\\delta(x) is the Dirac delta function. The standard trick to evaluate this functional integral is to write it as a product of exponential factors, schematically, :\\\\tilde{Z}[\\\\tilde{J}]=\\\\int \\\\mathcal{D}\\\\tilde\\\\phi \\\\prod_p \\\\left[e^{-(p^2+m^2)\\\\tilde\\\\phi^2/2} e^{-\\\\lambda/4!\\\\int d^4p_1d^4p_2d^4p_3\\\\delta(p-p_1-p_2-p_3)\\\\tilde\\\\phi(p)\\\\tilde\\\\phi(p_1)\\\\tilde\\\\phi(p_2)\\\\tilde\\\\phi(p_3)} e^{\\\\tilde{J}\\\\tilde\\\\phi}\\\\right]. The second two exponential factors can be expanded as power series, and the combinatorics of this expansion can be represented graphically. The integral with Œª = 0 can be treated as a product of infinitely many elementary Gaussian integrals, and the result may be expressed as a sum of Feynman diagrams, calculated using the following Feynman rules: * Each field \\\\tilde{\\\\phi}(p) in the n-point Euclidean Green's function is represented by an external line (half-edge) in the graph, and associated with momentum p. * Each vertex is represented by a factor -Œª. * At a given order Œªk, all diagrams with n external lines and k vertices are constructed such that the momenta flowing into each vertex is zero. Each internal line is represented by a factor 1/(q2 \\\\+ m2), where q is the momentum flowing through that line. * Any unconstrained momenta are integrated over all values. * The result is divided by a symmetry factor, which is the number of ways the lines and vertices of the graph can be rearranged without changing its connectivity. * Do not include graphs containing \\"vacuum bubbles\\", connected subgraphs with no external lines. The last rule takes into account the effect of dividing by \\\\tilde{Z}[0]. The Minkowski-space Feynman rules are similar, except that each vertex is represented by -i\\\\lambda, while each internal line is represented by a factor i/(q2-m2 \\\\+ i Œµ), where the Œµ term represents the small Wick rotation needed to make the Minkowski-space Gaussian integral converge. 488px Renormalization The integrals over unconstrained momenta, called \\"loop integrals\\", in the Feynman graphs typically diverge. This is normally handled by renormalization, which is a procedure of adding divergent counter-terms to the Lagrangian in such a way that the diagrams constructed from the original Lagrangian and counterterms are finite.See the previous reference, or for more detail, . A renormalization scale must be introduced in the process, and the coupling constant and mass become dependent upon it. It is this dependence that leads to the Landau pole mentioned earlier, and requires that the cutoff be kept finite. Alternatively, if the cutoff is allowed to go to infinity, the Landau pole can be avoided only if the renormalized coupling runs to zero, rendering the theory trivial. Spontaneous symmetry breaking An interesting feature can occur if m2 turns negative, but with Œª still positive. In this case, the vacuum consists of two lowest-energy states, each of which spontaneously breaks the Z2 global symmetry of the original theory. This leads to the appearance of interesting collective states like domain walls. In the O(2) theory, the vacua would lie on a circle, and the choice of one would spontaneously break the O(2) symmetry. A continuous broken symmetry leads to a Goldstone boson. This type of spontaneous symmetry breaking is the essential component of the Higgs mechanism.A basic description of spontaneous symmetry breaking may be found in the previous two references, or most other Quantum Field Theory books. =Spontaneous breaking of discrete symmetries= The simplest relativistic system in which we can see spontaneous symmetry breaking is one with a single scalar field \\\\varphi with Lagrangian :\\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\varphi) = \\\\frac{1}{2} (\\\\partial \\\\varphi)^2 + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\mu^2 \\\\varphi^2 - \\\\frac{1}{4} \\\\lambda \\\\varphi^4 \\\\equiv \\\\frac{1}{2} (\\\\partial \\\\varphi)^2 - V(\\\\varphi), where \\\\mu^2 > 0 and : V(\\\\varphi) \\\\equiv - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\mu^2 \\\\varphi^2 + \\\\frac{1}{4} \\\\lambda \\\\varphi^4. Minimizing the potential with respect to \\\\varphi leads to : V'(\\\\varphi_0) = 0 \\\\Longleftrightarrow \\\\varphi_0^2 \\\\equiv v^2 = \\\\frac{\\\\mu^2}{\\\\lambda}. We now expand the field around this minimum writing : \\\\varphi(x) = v + \\\\sigma(x), and substituting in the lagrangian we get : \\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\varphi) = \\\\underbrace{-\\\\frac{\\\\mu^4}{4\\\\lambda}}_{\\\\text{unimportant constant}} \\\\+ \\\\underbrace{\\\\frac{1}{2} [( \\\\partial \\\\sigma)^2 - (\\\\sqrt{2}\\\\mu)^2 \\\\sigma^2 ]}_{\\\\text{massive scalar field}} \\\\+ \\\\underbrace{ (-\\\\lambda v \\\\sigma^3 - \\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{4} \\\\sigma^4) }_{\\\\text{self-interactions}}. where we notice that the scalar \\\\sigma has now a positive mass term. Thinking in terms of vacuum expectation values lets us understand what happens to a symmetry when it is spontaneously broken. The original Lagrangian was invariant under the Z_2 symmetry \\\\varphi \\\\rightarrow -\\\\varphi. Since : \\\\langle \\\\Omega  \\\\varphi  \\\\Omega \\\\rangle = \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{ \\\\frac{6\\\\mu^2}{\\\\lambda} } are both minima, there must be two different vacua: \\\\Omega_\\\\pm \\\\rangle with : \\\\langle \\\\Omega_\\\\pm  \\\\varphi  \\\\Omega_\\\\pm \\\\rangle = \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{ \\\\frac{6\\\\mu^2}{\\\\lambda} }. Since the Z_2 symmetry takes \\\\varphi \\\\rightarrow -\\\\varphi, it must take  \\\\Omega_+ \\\\rangle \\\\leftrightarrow  \\\\Omega_- \\\\rangle as well. The two possible vacua for the theory are equivalent, but one has to be chosen. Although it seems that in the new Lagrangian the Z_2 symmetry has disappeared, it is still there, but it now acts as \\\\sigma \\\\rightarrow -\\\\sigma - 2v. This is a general feature of spontaneously broken symmetries: the vacuum breaks them, but they are not actually broken in the Lagrangian, just hidden, and often realized only in a nonlinear way.Schwartz, Quantum Field Theory and the Standard Model, Chapter 28.1 Exact solutions There exists a set of exact classical solutions to the equation of motion of the theory written in the form : \\\\partial^2\\\\varphi+\\\\mu_0^2\\\\varphi+\\\\lambda\\\\varphi^3=0 that can be written for the massless, \\\\mu_0=0 case as :\\\\varphi(x) = \\\\pm\\\\mu\\\\left(\\\\frac{2}{\\\\lambda}\\\\right)^{1\\\\over 4}{\\\\rm sn}(p\\\\cdot x+\\\\theta,-1), with \\\\, \\\\rm sn\\\\\\\\! a Jacobi elliptic function and \\\\,\\\\mu,\\\\theta two integration constants, provided the following dispersion relation holds :p^2=\\\\mu^2\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{2}\\\\right)^{1\\\\over 2}. The interesting point is that we started with a massless equation but the exact solution describes a wave with a dispersion relation proper to a massive solution. When the mass term is not zero one gets :\\\\varphi(x) = \\\\pm\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2\\\\mu^4}{\\\\mu_0^2 + \\\\sqrt{\\\\mu_0^4 + 2\\\\lambda\\\\mu^4}}}{\\\\rm sn}\\\\left(p\\\\cdot x+\\\\theta,\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{-\\\\mu_0^2 + \\\\sqrt{\\\\mu_0^4 + 2\\\\lambda\\\\mu^4}}{-\\\\mu_0^2 - \\\\sqrt{\\\\mu_0^4 + 2\\\\lambda\\\\mu^4}}}\\\\right) being now the dispersion relation :p^2=\\\\mu_0^2+\\\\frac{\\\\lambda\\\\mu^4}{\\\\mu_0^2+\\\\sqrt{\\\\mu_0^4+2\\\\lambda\\\\mu^4}}. Finally, for the case of a symmetry breaking one has :\\\\varphi(x) =\\\\pm v\\\\cdot {\\\\rm dn}(p\\\\cdot x+\\\\theta,i), being v=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2\\\\mu_0^2}{3\\\\lambda}} and the following dispersion relation holds :p^2=\\\\frac{\\\\lambda v^2}{2}. These wave solutions are interesting as, notwithstanding we started with an equation with a wrong mass sign, the dispersion relation has the right one. Besides, Jacobi function \\\\, {\\\\rm dn}\\\\\\\\! has no real zeros and so the field is never zero but moves around a given constant value that is initially chosen describing a spontaneous breaking of symmetry. A proof of uniqueness can be provided if we note that the solution can be sought in the form \\\\varphi=\\\\varphi(\\\\xi) being \\\\xi=p\\\\cdot x. Then, the partial differential equation becomes an ordinary differential equation that is the one defining the Jacobi elliptic function with p satisfying the proper dispersion relation.

India has a long tradition of comic readership and themes associated with extensive mythologies and folk-tales have appeared as children's comic books for decades. Indian comics often have large publication. The comic industry was at its peak in the late 1980s and early 1990s and during this period popular comics were easily sold more than 500,000 copies over the course of its shelf life of several weeks. Currently, it only sell around 50,000 copies over a similar period. India's once-flourishing comic industry is in sharp decline because of increasing competition from satellite television (children's television channels) and the gaming industry. Over the last three decades Diamond Comics, Raj Comics, Tinkle, Balarama and Amar Chitra Katha have established vast distribution networks countrywide and are read by hundreds of thousands of children in a wide range of languages. Famous comic creators from India include Anupam Sinha, Aabid Surti, Uncle Pai and cartoonist Pran Kumar Sharma and famous characters are Chacha Chaudhary, Bahadur, Detective Moochhwala, Nagraj, Super Commando Dhruva, Doga, Ved, Varun, Karma, Suppandi and Shikari Shambu. Anant Pai, affectionately known as \\"Uncle Pai,\\" is credited with helping to launch India's comic book industry in the 1960s with his \\"Amar Chitra Katha\\" series chronicling the ancient Hindu mythologies.  History  India's comic industry began in the mid-1960s when the leading newspaper The Times of India launched Indrajal Comics. The industry evolved later in India than in the West. Up until the late 1960s the comics were only enjoyed by the children of wealthy parents. But from that time until the early 1990s they established themselves in the market. The evolution of Indian comics can be broadly divided into four phases. Around 1950s saw syndicated strips like The Phantom, Mandrake, Flash Gordon, Rip Kirby being translated to Indian languages. The success of such comic books was followed by a swarm of publishers trying to emulate these titles. The second phase in the late 1960s came in the form of Amar Chitra Katha (literally translated as \\"immortal picture stories\\"), comics with hundred percentage Indian content. The Indian adaptation of Spider-Man, Spider- Man:India, was mainly bought by collectors In the 1970s several indigenous comics were launched to rival the Western superhero comics. The superhero comics in the early '80s marked the third wave, with creators and publishers hoping to benefit from the success of the superhero genre in the West. However, one of India's earliest superheroes is Batul the Great, was created during the 1960s by Narayan Debnath., whose early comic strip Handa Bhonda, inspired by Laurel and Hardy, had been launched in the magazine Shuktara in 1962.D. Ghosh Dastidar, ‚ÄúProspects of Comic Studies in India,‚Äù Gnosis 3 (2019), 113‚Äì128 (116). In the 1980s, at least 5.5 million copies of comics such as Heroes of Faith series were sold in India. Dozens of publishers churned out hundreds of such comic books every month, but this trend nosedived in the late '90s with the advent of cable television, Internet and other modes of entertainment in India. However, publishers like Raj Comics and Diamond Comics along with comics like Amar Chitra Katha (with characters such as Suppandi) have been able to sustain their readership. After a lull, new publishing companies such as the Virgin Comics, Yali Dream Creations, Green Gold, Jr. Diamond etc. has appeared on the market in the last few years. Comic publishers meanwhile have been accused by critics of lacking innovation in the face of digital competition. Webcomics have been a popular medium in India since the early 2000s. Indian webcomics are successful as they reach a large audience for free and they are frequently used by the country's younger generation to spread social awareness on topics such as politics and feminism. These webcomics reach a large amount of exposure by being spread through social media. India hosted its first ever comics convention in February 2011. According to 2012 estimates, the Indian comic publishing industry was worth over 100 million dollars. Raj Comics is the most popular Indian comic book company right now. Raj Comics is the home for all Indian superheroes. Comic characters like Nagraj and Super Commando Dhruva which are India's most popular comic book heroes, are the gift of comic creators like Pratap Mullik and Anupam Sinha.Raj comics has gained immense viewership and fan following from 1980's. The popularity of manga and anime in India has led to Japanese manga-inspired comic books, such as Mythology a comic book based on Hindu mythology that has been released in India, Singapore, Malaysia and Europe. From 2005 to recent times there are many attempts by recently ventured and old comics publishers to revive the Indian comics industry including initiatives from Level 10 Comics, Yali Dream Creations, Holycow Entertainment, Chariot Comics, Ayumi Comics, Red Streak Comics, Rovolt Comics, Vimanika Comics and TBS Planet Comics, UFC, Dream Comics, Swapnil Comics, Vaishnavi Comics, Fenil Comics, Dhaansu Productions and the surviving Raj Comics itself. Amar Chitra Katha, Raj Comics and Diamond Comics has ventured into other entertainment media like feature films, web series, games, mobile applications etc. since late 1990s and continuously attempting to widen their impact on the comics- reading population. By the end of 2019, many new comic-making companies have shown a great interest in the upbringing of the Indian comic industry and are fighting to make a mark in the industry.

Landser is an old-fashioned German colloquialism for a low-ranking soldier. The band, who are outlawed in Germany, were previously called Endl√∂sung (Final Solution), and were founded by members of the neo-Nazi group Die Vandalen - Ariogermanische Kampfgemeinschaft (The Vandals - Aryan Germanic Combat Association), which was founded in 1982 in the former German Democratic Republic.http://www.politische-bildung-brandenburg.de/extrem/rechtsrock3.htm#3 Biography of Landser (in German) They performed only one concert that was open to the public, and did so wearing masks. However, they held several private concerts in restaurants in Berlin, Germany. Landser had their CDs manufactured abroad, mainly in the United States, Canada and Eastern Europe. The music is distributed online, by underground dealers through peer to peer networks or purchased from music labels in the United States and in some European countries where their music is legal (mostly in Eastern Europe and the United Kingdom).  History  Michael Regener, Landser's singer and guitarist, started a gang of neo-Nazi rockers called Vandalen in East Berlin in 1982. The Vandalen advocated a return to Odinism. In 1991, the band that would become Landser were formed by Soren B (vocals and guitar), Andreas L (bass) and Horst S (drums). This proto-Landser were non-political and played covers of German and English songs. Regener replaced Soren in early 1992 and named the group Endlosung, then Landser. Landser's first major release was Das Reich kommt wieder (The Reich Will Rise Again) in September 1992. Shortly after its release, Landser played their only public concert, wearing masks. Their other albums include Republik der Strolche (Republic of Rascals, 1995), Rock gegen Oben (Rock against the Top 1997) and Ran an den Feind, (Engage the Enemy, 2000), which includes a remake of the 1940 German military march \\"Bomben auf England\\", retitled \\"Bomben auf Israel\\". The song \\"Rudolf Hess\\" from Rock gegen Oben glorifies Nazi Rudolf Hess as a martyr and, in \\"Sturmf√ºhrer\\", Michael Regener, the band's leader, pays tribute to his grandfather, who was a Waffen Schutzstaffel (SS) officer. The track \\"Verkauft und Verraten\\" (Sold Out and Betrayed) from Rock gegen Oben compares life in East Germany, where Regener was born, to life in modern Germany. In it, he says that he \\"can still see the snipers lurking in the watchtowers\\" and at the end, he exclaims that he has been \\"sold out and betrayed by the fucking Democrats\\". Most of their songs espouse an aggressively nationalist perspective of the world and are highly critical of the Federal Republic of Germany, its surveillance and censorship agencies (i.e. the Bundesamt f√ºr Verfassungsschutz), liberalism and the Left. A number of songs speak against communists, pedophiles and homosexuals, as well as ethnic minorities in Germany, such as the Poles, Jews, Russians, Gypsies, Turks, Vietnamese, blacks and Czechs but also against refugees. Many songs are decidedly racist against all Non-Whites. Some of their songs are non-political and inspired by German drinking songs. Others praise German icons such as Frederick the Great or take an anti-drug stance.  Legal action  In Germany, the band has been deemed a criminal organization and its three members were fined and ordered to perform community service. The court also found all three men guilty of \\"incitement of the masses\\" and \\"spreading hate propaganda\\" in addition to \\"forming a criminal organisation\\". Bassist Andre M√∂hricke and drummer Christian Wenndorff both received a year and nine months‚Äô probation after the judge said they helped investigators and expressed remorse; the band's leader, Michael Regener was sentenced to more than three years in prison. This was the first time a band had been declared illegal in Germany and its members jailed. On 10 March 2005, the German Federal Court of Justice, Germany's highest court, rejected Regener's appeal of his sentence. Owing to M√∂hricke and Wenndorff making long statements to the police and courts to receive shorter sentences, Michael Regener dissolved the band forever. He stated his former friends and band members had \\"liberty expensively bought, at the price of honour!\\" All Landser albums were censored via a process called indexed. As a result of the indexing, two compilation albums, \\"Rock gegen ZOG\\" and \\"Tanzorchester Immervoll\\", were released containing all the songs that did not have forbidden lyrics. Regener was still producing CDs while waiting for his appeal. After the forced breakup of Landser, Regener founded a new band in 2004, Die Lunikoff Verschw√∂rung (The Lunikoff conspiracy). They have made several CDs, including 2004's Die R√ºckkehr des Unbegreiflichen, Amalek Vol. 1 & 2, and 2005's Niemals auf Knien. The lyrics of these CDs were vetted by lawyers to make them not actionable according to German law. On October 21, 2006, approximately 750 neo-Nazis launched a protest outside the jail where Regener was being held, demanding his release.http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6073664.stm In January 2007, under German law because Michael Regener had already served two-thirds of his jail sentence his lawyers filed for probation. The justice sentencing court of Berlin agreed with probation and suspended the remaining time. The Federal prosecutors office took the case to the court of appeal against the Berlin decision and on 19 March 2007, the original sentence was upheld. He was released early March 2008.  Discography  All these albums are indexed, but used copies are still available from other countries and they circulate on peer-to-peer sites. * Das Reich kommt wieder (1992) * Republik der Strolche (1995) * Rock gegen Oben (1997) * Ran an den Feind (2000) * Endl√∂sung - Final Solution (2001, compilation of pre-Landser demos recorded when the band were still calling themselves Endl√∂sung) * Rock gegen ZOG - hepp-hepp! ...und noch einmal (2002, compilation) * Tanzorchester Immervoll... jetzt erst recht (2002, compilation)  Personnel  = Final lineup = * Michael Regener ‚Äì vocals, guitar (1992‚Äì2003) * Andr√© M√∂hricke ‚Äì bass (1995‚Äì2003) * Christian Wenndorff ‚Äì drums (1997‚Äì2003) = Past members = * S√∂ren B. ‚Äì vocals, guitar (1991‚Äì1992) * Andreas L. ‚Äì bass (1991‚Äì1995) * Horst S. ‚Äì drums (1991‚Äì1997) See also * Combat 18 * Blood and Honour * List of neo-Nazi bands References German musical groups Neo-Nazi musical groups Musical groups established in 1991 Musical groups disestablished in 2003 1991 establishments in Germany ","title":"Landser (band)"},{"id":"1382070","text":"Hadrumetum, also known by many variant spellings and names, was a Phoenician colony that pre-dated Carthage.

Surviving Roman inscriptions and coinage standardized its latinization as Hadrumetum but it appears in other sources as Adrumetum, Adrumetus, Adrimetum, Hadrymetum, &c.; Upon its notional refounding as a Roman colony, its formal name was emended to Ulpia Trajana Augusta to honor its imperial sponsor. It was renamed Honoriopolis after the emperor Honorius in the early 5th century, then Hunericopolis after the Vandal king HunericO. Maenchen-Helfen, The World of the Huns. IX. footnote 113. and Justinianopolis after the Byzantine emperor Geography Hadrumetum controlled the mouth of a small river on the Gulf of Hammamet (), an inlet of the Mediterranean along the Tunisian coast.  History  = Phoenician colony = In the 9th century, Tyrians established Hadrumetum as a trading post and waypoint along their trade routes to Italy and the Strait of Gibraltar. Its establishment preceded Carthage'sSallust, Jug., 19. but, like other western Phoenician colonies, it became part of the Carthaginian Empire following 's long siege of Tyre in the 580s and 570s. =Carthaginian city= Agathocles of Syracuse captured the town in 310 during the Third Sicilian War, as part of his failed attempt to move the conflict to Africa. Hadrumetum later provided refuge to Hannibal and other Carthaginian survivors after their 202 defeat at Zama, which decided the outcome of the Second Punic War. The total length of the Punic fortifications was apparently ; some ruins survive. =Roman city= During the Third Punic War, the government of Hadrumetum supported the Romans against CarthageAppian, The Punic Wars, ¬ß94. and, after Carthage's destruction in 146, it received additional territory and the status of a free city in thanks.CIL, Vol.I, p.84. During this period, it chose its own shufets () and minted its own bronze coins with the head of \\"Neptune\\" or the Sun. During the civil war between Pompey and Julius Caesar, G. Considius Longus secured Hadrumetum for the Optimates with forces equivalent to two legions. Despite being reinforced by Gn. Calpurnius Piso's Berber cavalry and footmen from Clupea, however, he was obliged to allow Caesar to land nearby on 28 December 47.Caesar & al., Afr. War, Ch.iii. According to Suetonius, this landing was the occasion of the famously deft recovery, when Caesar tripped while coming ashore but dealt with the poor omen by grabbing handfuls of dirt and proclaiming \\"I have you now, Africa!\\" ()Suetonius, Div. Jul., ¬ß59. & Caesar's attempts to negotiate with Longus were rejected but the campaign subsequently led to his victory over Metellus Scipio and Juba at Thapsus, after which Longus was killed by his own men for the money he was carryingCaesar & al., Afr. War, ¬ß76. and the town went over to Caesar.Caesar & al., Afr. War, ¬ß89. Roman ruins at Hadrumetum Hadrumetum was one of the most important communities in Roman North Africa because of the fertility of its hinterland (modern Tunisia's Sahel), which made it an important source of Rome's grain supply. It quarreled with its neighbor Thysdrus over the temple of a goddess equated to Minerva, which stood on their shared border. Under Augustus, Hadrumetum's coins bore his face obverse and the name (and often face) of Africa's proconsul reverse; after Augustus, the mint was closed. Hadrumetum revolted while Vespasian was proconsul of Africa.Suetonius, Vesp., Ch. iv. It nonetheless continued to prosper; Trajan gave it the rank of a Roman colony, giving its residents Roman citizenship. A breathtaking legacy of intricate mosaics survives from this era, together with many early Christian objects from the catacombs. It was the second city in Roman Africa after Carthage and the birthplace of Clodius Albinus, who attempted to become emperor in the 190s. At the end of the 3rd century, it became the capital of the new province of Byzacena (modern Sahel, Tunisia). =Later history= In 434, it was largely destroyed by the Vandals; their fervent Arianism produced a number of orthodox martyrs in the remaining community, including SSFelix and Victorian. A century later, Hadrumetum was retaken and rebuilt by the Byzantines during the Vandal War.Procop., Build., Book VI, ¬ß6. It was conquered by the Umayyad Caliphate in the 7th century. The ruins of Hadrumetum stood in the village of Hammeim, from the later Sousse,. which grew up to include them in its outskirts. Under colonial rule, the French engineer A. Daux rediscovered the jetties and moles of the Roman town's commercial harbor and the line of its military harbor; both had been mostly artificial and have silted up since antiquity. Louis Carton and Abb√©Leynaud rediscovered the Christian catacombs in 1904; the tunnels extend for miles through small subterranean galleries filled with Roman and Byzantine sarcophaguses and inscriptions. Ruins In addition to the Punic walls, Roman harbors, and Byzantine catacombs, there are ruins of the Byzantine acropolis and basilica; the Roman horse track, cisterns, the theater; and a Punic necropolis. Religion As a major Roman city, Hadrumetum produced a number of Christian saints, including Mavilus during the regional persecutions of Caracalla's reign and the Bishop Felix and proconsul Victorian during the Vandals' efforts to forcibly convert their subjects to Arianism. From 255 to 551, the city was the seat of a Christian bishopric. The see was revived in the 17th century as a Catholic titular see. =List of bishops= There were nine ancient bishops of Hadrumetum who are still known. * Polycarp, who appeared at the 256 Council of CarthageEpistle of Cyprian to Cornelius. * StFelix, martyred by Gaiseric * StPrimasius * Martin, Weihbischof in Augsburg, konsekrierte am 16.10.1457 den Chor der Stadtpfarrkirche Heideck (Bayern), belegt durch Urkunde * Raphael de Figueredo (1681.05.14 ‚Äì 1695.10.12) * Salvator-Alexandre-F√©lix-Carmel Brincat (1889.05.12 ‚Äì 1909.04.02) * Giacinto Gaggia (1909.04.29 ‚Äì 1913.10.28) * Jean- Marie Bourchany (1914.01.13 ‚Äì 1931.11.27) * Carlo Re, IMC (1931.12.14 ‚Äì 1951.12.29) * Jorge Manrique Hurtado (1952.02.23 ‚Äì 1956.07.28) * Celestin Bezmalinovic, OP (1956.08.07 ‚Äì 1967) * Mijo ≈†kvorc, SJ (1970.06.16 ‚Äì 1989.02.15) * Marian B≈Ça≈ºej Kruszy≈Çowicz, OFM Conv (1989.12.09 ‚Äì present)  References  =Citations= =Bibliography= * . * . * . * . * .

After extreme dedication and perseverance by the brothers and their father, Raj Comics was propelled to great heights and fame. Nearly every teenager spent their afternoons glued to the latest comic addition. = The Golden Age = In 1997, television ad for Nagraj featuring Sonu Sood aired on TV for advertising. The whimsical nature of the television show garnered attention from popular youtuber CarryMinati https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qmp7eLkcsJY During this era, Raj Comics allegedly sold over a million copies a year making it one of the most widespread publications for that time period. = Modern Age = Raj Comics has now expanded to multiple different publication streams, with TriColor and other various business entities taking venerable steps in penetrating the Indian book market. Beyond which, ongoing discussions with studio heads have been disclosed to the public about live feature films and the like based on their comic universe however nothing has since come to fruition. Raj Comics has released a short feature film named Aadamkhor, partially self-produced and crowdfunded. It released on YouTube to critical acclaim by its audience. Raj Comics also diversified its portfolio by investing in the digital sector. Headed by Manish Gupta[CEO], an android application was released for the general public in 2015. It has since garnered a massive following and has an average rating of 4.5+ stars. Raj Comics released a concept trailer for Nagraj on its official YouTube channel. It has since garnered over a million views.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DmYkiVM6LM Series =King Comics= King Comics was a line of comics published through Raja Pocket Books. While the division was initially successful, its popularity declined and the line went defunct after only about 2‚Äì5 years of activity. It was intended that many of King Comic's characters would be merged into Raj Comics, but only a few characters such as Gamraj were merged.

Released in 1996, FX!32 was developed by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) to support their Alpha microprocessors. At the time, there was a belief that RISC-based microprocessors were likely to replace x86-based microprocessors, due to a more efficient and simplified implementation that could reach higher clock frequencies. The one thing that held the Alpha back was application-compatibility with existing Win32 x86 applications. Emulation had been around for a while as a concept, but FX!32 went one stage further. It analyzed the way programs worked and, after the program ran, used binary translation to produce dynamic-link library (DLL) files of native Alpha code that the application could execute the next time it ran. This way even in the early 1.0 release, the FX!32 achieved speeds for Win32 x86 applications that ran 40-50% as fast as native x86 code, with a 70% speed projected as likely with improved optimization. Maurice Marks served as manager of the technical team. Eric Perkins provided the primary information on Windows NT, and wrote a runtime system to allow binary translated application to run on Intel Windows NT based machines. A prototype of the system was demonstrated at COMDEX in 1993.

The property opened on June 28, 1988, as the Grand Floridian Beach Resort. The name changed to Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa during the fall of 1997. The resort contains 867 rooms among six buildings at an average of per room. The resort is owned and operated by Disney Parks, Experiences and Products. The Grand Floridian is categorized as a \\"deluxe\\" resort, one of four types of accommodations at the Florida site. It is also distinguished as Disney's flagship and most opulent resort.  History and influences  The Grand Floridian was inspired by the Victorian era beach resorts built along Florida's east coast during the late 19th century and early 20th century; its exterior is modeled after the Mount Washington Resort in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire and Hotel del Coronado in Coronado, California, with red gabled roofs and white walls. Additional design inspiration was taken from the former Belleview-Biltmore Hotel in Belleair, Florida. The resort's outer lodge buildings ‚Äî Sago Cay, Sugarloaf Key, Conch Key, Boca Chica and Big Pine Key‚Äîare named for islands in the Florida Keys. The hotel's main building features a five story lobby, a replica cage elevator, stained glass domes, and Italian marble floors with inlays of various Disney characters. During daytime hours, a grand pianist performs in the main lobby while a house orchestra plays on the second floor balcony every evening. Initially, Walt Disney wanted a Polynesian resort (reflecting Adventureland), the Contemporary Resort to echo Tomorrowland, and other resorts that mirrored the 'lands' of the Magic Kingdom. Main Street and The Grand Floridian act as analogous reflections. The resort was designed by the Disney company and executed by the architectural firm Wimberly, Allison, Tong & Goo. Along with Disney's Polynesian Village Resort, the Grand Floridian sits on the shores of the man-made Seven Seas Lagoon near the Magic Kingdom. The hotel occupies land that had been earmarked for an Asian themed resort during the initial development of Walt Disney World Resort in the late 1960s. The Beach Boys performed there in 1988 to film the music video for their song Kokomo. In 1992, a convention center opened adjacent to the hotel, which contains a business center. The hotel has completed some major renovations in recent years. Since 2007, all guestrooms, restaurants, retail shops, and common areas of the resort have been updated. In 2011, the Grand Floridian Spa and Health Club underwent an extensive 18 month remodel. In 2013, the hotel completed a remodel of all pool areas along with the installation of a beachside fire pit and children's water area themed to Disney's Alice in Wonderland. The Villas at Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa Completed in 2013, the Disney Vacation Club building at Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa houses 147 villas and studios. The Villas continue the theme of Victorian-era Palm Beach resorts found in the Grand Floridian while catering to the needs of DVC guests. The expansion makes the Grand Floridian the second monorail resort to receive a DVC addition, following Bay Lake Tower at Disney's Contemporary Resort which opened in 2009. Like Bay Lake Tower, The Villas at the Grand Floridian features its own lobby and porte cochere, and guests can check in and out and access concierge services without needing to visit the Main Building. The Villas also include a leisure area (including barbecue pit) adjacent to the resort's spa. A covered walkway links the Villas to the main building. Villas and studios include split bathrooms alongside Disney theming to Dumbo and Mary Poppins.  Recreation and amenities  Disney's Grand Floridian Resort and Spa offers multiple amenities and recreational activities. *Courtyard Pool - Situated between the guest room buildings, the pool features zero-entry access, a jacuzzi, cabanas, and the Courtyard Pool Bar. *Beach Pool - Located beachside between the main resort and Villas, the zero-entry Beach Pool offers an Alice in Wonderland water playground for children, as well as a slide, cabanas, and pool bar. *White Sand Beaches - The resort fronts the Seven Seas Lagoon and features a stretch of man-made white sand beaches, which continue to the nearby Polynesian Village Resort. *The Captain's Shipyard - A marina containing watercraft rentals, fireworks and fishing excursions, and a yacht. *Arcadia Games - Connected to Gasparilla Island Grill. *Senses Spa and Fitness Center - Senses - A Disney Spa is located adjacent to the Villas building and also houses a 24-hour fitness center for the use of Grand Floridian and Polynesian guests. *Jogging Trail - The Grand Floridian and Polynesian Village have an interconnecting jogging trail which is approximately one mile in length. *Shopping - Located within the Main Building is a variety of stores. *Dining - 1900 Park Fare is located within the Main Building which is an old time carnival and carousel themed character buffet. The antique Limonaire Band Organ \\"Big Bertha\\" is located overhead where the guests eat and plays occasionally. The organ was formerly a part of the Paul Eakins collection. Other locations include Citricos, Narcoossee's and Victoria and Alberts (all upscale dining), Grand Floridian Cafe (casual dining), the Garden View Tea Room and Gasparilla Island Grill (quick service). *Ivy Trellis Salon - a hair and beauty salon. *Lobby Entertainment - The Main Building lobby features live music in the form of piano and singer during the daytime, and a dedicated orchestra in the evenings. *Convention Center - Situated to the right of the lobby upon exiting, the Grand Floridian features its own convention center. *Walt Disney World Transportation System - The resort has its own Walt Disney World Monorail System station, as well as a water launch to the Polynesian Village Resort and the Magic Kingdom. Buses provide access to all other Walt Disney World attractions. *Disney's Wedding Pavilion - Disney's Wedding Chapel located on the property. Incidents * On October 9, 1989, a 33-year-old woman from Glen Cove, New York, was killed when a tiny speedboat collided with a ferry boat. She and her 8-year-old son were broadsided by the ferry while trying to videotape friends and family members who were water skiing in the Seven Seas Lagoon. A crew member and a visitor on the ferry dove into the water and rescued her son. The boy was not hurt in the accident.

The street and subsequently the station were named after Prince William I, the later German Emperor. U-Bahn station Prinzenstra√üe, about 1900 The station on the first Berlin U-Bahn line from Potsdamer Platz to Stralauer Tor was opened on 18 February 1902. Because the station is on a viaduct above the junction of Prinzenstra√üe and Gitschiner Stra√üe, a street level entrance hall could only be erected on its south side on the grounds of a gas plant, while the stairs to the northern platform had to be included in the opposite residential building. Destroyed in World War II on 28/29 January 1944 and 3 February 1945, the station was rebuilt in the 1950s. It later received new entrance halls in a hotly disputed Postmodern style, in 1984J.

Dates given are 16 May 1609 and 24 May 1610. ‚Äì 9 November 1641) was Governor of the Spanish Netherlands, Cardinal of the Holy Catholic Church, Infante of Spain, Infante of Portugal (until 1640), Archduke of Austria, Archbishop of Toledo (1619‚Äì41), and military commander during the Thirty Years' War.  Biography  = Youth = Born at the El Escorial near Madrid, Spain in 16091, he was the son of the King of Spain and Portugal, Philip III and II and Margaret of Austria, sister of Emperor Ferdinand II.Parker, Geoffrey and Simon Adams, The Thirty Years' War, (Routledge, 1984), 292. His older siblings were King Philip IV and III and the French queen Anne of Austria. As his father wished that he pursue an ecclesiastical career, Ferdinand was elevated to the Primacy of Spain in 1619, becoming Archbishop of Toledo.Zimmerman, Benedict, Carmel in England, (Burns & Oates, Limited, 1899), 166. Shortly afterwards he was created Cardinal. The style Cardinal-Infante was a combination of his dignity as Cardinal and his station as a royal Prince (Infante in Spanish) of Spain. Ferdinand was never actually ordained a priest (though he received the minor orders). = Events leading to the Battle of N√∂rdlingen = In 1630 the Cardinal Infante's aunt Isabella Clara Eugenia planned to make him her successor as governor of the Spanish Netherlands. To move to the Netherlands in a style befitting a governor, a strong army had to accompany him. Travel by ship from Spain was not an option as it would expose him to risk of battle with the Dutch navy in the then ongoing Eighty Years' War, so in 1633, he went to Genoa, having quit his governorship of Catalonia where he had been trained. He met with an army from Milan for a planned march through the famous Spanish Way across Lombardy, Tyrol, and Swabia, and then following the Rhine to the Netherlands. Ferdinand also planned to secure this supply route with a string of garrisons, and to support the army of King Ferdinand III of Hungary, his brother-in-law the emperor's son and heir, who was leading the Imperial army facing the Swedes in the Thirty Years' War. Since disease delayed his travels, he sent half of his army ahead under the command of the Duke of Feria. However, this army was severely depleted during fighting with the Swedish army of Bernhard of Saxe- Weimar and Gustaf Horn. The Spanish requested 4000 cavalry from the Imperial general Albrecht von Wallenstein, but this being denied, the Spanish had to fund the troops on their own. The Cardinal-Infante was able to continue his travels in 1634, collecting in Bavaria the remains of the army of G√≥mez Su√°rez, who had died in January 1634. = Battle of N√∂rdlingen = Meanwhile, Ferdinand of Hungary was able to defeat the Swedish army at Regensburg in July 1634. Ferdinand and his cousin the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand then raced to merge their armies. The Swedish forces of Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar and Gustaf Horn desperately tried to prevent this merger, but were unable to catch up with Ferdinand of Hungary. The Cardinal-Infante crossed the Danube in August 1634. In September both armies were able to merge, and camped south of N√∂rdlingen in Swabia. At that time N√∂rdlingen was protected by a small Swedish garrison. Shortly thereafter, the armies of Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar and Gustaf Horn also reached N√∂rdlingen, preparing the events for the decisive Battle of N√∂rdlingen. Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand and his cousin Ferdinand then prepared for battle, ignoring the advice of the more experienced generals, such as the Imperial general Matthias Gallas. Bernhard and Horn also prepared for battle, but they were by now rivals and in disagreement with each other. They also underestimated the numerically superior enemy forces, due to incorrect reports that did not realize the Spanish Army of the late Duke of Feria had joined the Cardinal-Infante and believed that the enemy forces numbered only 7,000, not 21,000 infantry, compared to 16,000 Swedish infantry. During the battle, almost anything that could go wrong went wrong for the Swedish forces, due to the strong defensive efforts of the Spanish Infantry (the most feared Tercios Viejos, mainly those commanded by Fuenclara, Idi√°quez and Toralto) after pushing back fifteen Swedish assaults against Blue and Yellow Horn regiments on the hill of Albuch they protected, so the two Ferdinands achieved a decisive military victory. Gustaf Horn was captured, the Swedish army was destroyed, and the remainder that fled to Heilbronn was only a shadow of the former glorious army. As a whole this battle proved that the deployment improvements devised by Maurice of Orange and the late Swedish King did not yet match the old Tercio when Spanish troops were engaged in the fighting. = The Spanish Netherlands = Archduke Ferdinand in 1635 depicted by Flemish painter Peter Paul Rubens. Collection of John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art The King of Hungary tried to convince his cousin to stay and to strengthen their hold on Germany, but the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand moved his troops almost immediately after the battle to continue to Brussels. At the end of 1634 he entered Brussels with all the glory befitting a Governor-General. Due to the unpopularity of the clergy in Brussels, he downplayed his religious status and instead emphasized his worldly ranks. Ferdinand was a skilled politician and diplomat, and quickly reformed the government and the military. He especially managed to win the support of the Flemings against France. However, his powers were secretly limited, and the leader of his army was instructed to follow Spanish orders instead of Ferdinand's orders if necessary. In 1635 the French attacked Namur, planning to merge with the Dutch near Maastricht but were held off by well prepared defenses while Ferdinand brought the full weight of the Army of Flanders to bear on the Dutch invaders. At the siege of Leuven, the invading Franco-Dutch forces suffered a major defeat which allowed Spanish forces under Ferdinand to go on the offensive. The Dutch were driven back and the French retreated. Ferdinand subsequently was able to capture Diest, Goch, Gennep, Limbourg, and Schenk. Coat of Arms of the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Spain. \\"Ferdinand Receives the Keys of the City from the Virgin of Ghent\\", print after a painting made by Antoon van den Heuvel for the Joyous Entry by the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand into Ghent in 1635 In 1636 Ferdinand disempowered the last Protestant priests in the Spanish Netherlands, and continued his military counter-offensive by capturing Hirson, Le Catelet, and La Capelle, and securing Luxembourg using the usual mixed nationalities typical of the early modern age that included Croatian troops, and reaching as far a stronghold in France as Corbie, threatening Paris. = Fall from grace = With Spanish forces concentrated in the fight with the French, a relatively lightly defended Breda was recaptured in 1637 after a 10-month siege by the Prince of Orange after being under Spanish control for 12 years. The loss of Breda was a blow to Spanish prestige but of minor strategic importance compared to the gains made by Ferdinand that year by taking the towns of Venlo and Roermond in the Meuse, effectively cutting Maastricht from the Dutch Republic and, thus, preventing further Dutch attacks on the Spanish Netherlands from the east.Van Nimwegen, Olaf: The Dutch Army and the Military Revolutions, 1588-1688.

In the southern front Ferdinand lost the towns of La Capelle, Landrecies, and Damvillers to the French, but then he forced them to retreat south of Maubeuge.Thion, St√©phane: French Armies of the Thirty Years' War. Auzielle: LRT Editions, 2008. , p. 23. In 1638 Ferdinand's army successfully defended Antwerp, Saint-Omer and Geldern from the Dutch and French armies.Gonz√°lez de Le√≥n, Fernando: The Road to Rocroi: Class, Culture and Command in the Spanish Army of Flanders, 1567-1659. Leiden: Brill, 2009. , p. 235. Ferdinand achieved a decisive victory over the Dutch at the Battle of Kallo in June, when he took 2,500 Dutch prisoners, 81 river barges and a good amount of artillery. In a letter to his brother the King shortly afterwards, Ferdinand described the battle as \\"the greatest victory which your Majesty's arms have achieved since the war in the Low Countries began\\".Israel, Jonathan: Conflicts of Empires: Spain, the Low Countries and the Struggle for World Supremacy, 1585-1713. London: The Hambledon Press, 1997. , p. 83. The next year Ferdinand managed again to thwart the Franco-Dutch plans. The Dutch navy defeated an important Spanish fleet in the Battle of the Downs, off the English coast, but it failed to prevent most of the army it was carrying, some 7,000 to 10,500 infantry, from landing at Dunkirk.Van Nimwegen, p. 260. While Ferdinand frustrated the Prince of Orange's move against Hulst, a Spanish army under Count Piccolomini destroyed the main French army in the south at the Battle of Thionville. In 1640 Dutch attacks on Hulst and Bruges were repelled by the local Spanish garrisons.Guthrie, William P.: The Later Thirty Years War: From the Battle of Wittstock to the Treaty of Westphalia. Westport: Greenwood Press, 2007. , p. 168. In the south, after a failed attack on the Spanish fortress of Charlemont in Givet, the French army launched a great offensive upon Arras, the capital of the County of Artois. Ferdinand took the command of the Spanish Army and attempted unsuccessfully to break the French lines. The city finally surrendered on 9 August. Its capture was the first victory of importance for the French in the war after five years of fighting.Maffi, Davide: La gran ilusi√≥n: Francia en guerra (1635‚Äì1643). In Desperta Ferro Moderna, 9. Madrid: April‚ÄìMay 2014, p. 36. Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria as Actaeon by Diego Vel√°zquez More dangerous than his military enemies were, however, his enemies at the Spanish court. Numerous rumors and lies floated about, and it was claimed that Ferdinand was planning to become an independent ruler of the Spanish Netherlands with the help of the French King, an enemy of Spain. This rumor was enhanced by another rumor that the French court was planning to marry Ferdinand to Anne Marie Louise d'Orl√©ans, Duchess of Montpensier, the (eldest) daughter of Gaston, Duke of Orl√©ans, the French king's brother. The former claim was untrue however his sister Anne of Austria did suggest a marriage between Ferdinand and Anne Marie Louise, the greatest heiress in Europe . At the same time, the Spanish empire was in a bad state both military and financially. The Cardinal-Infante was even given conflicting orders to send troops to Spain to aid against the 1640 Portuguese uprising. Death Ferdinand fell ill during battles in 1641, and died on 9 November 1641 in Brussels at age 32.Griffis, William Elliot, Belgium: the land of art: its history, legends, industry and modern expansion, (Houghton Mifflin Co., 1919), 231. It was thought that death was caused by exhaustion combined with ill health. Reports talk about a stomach ulcer, but rumors also claimed that he was poisoned. Before his death he had an illegitimate daughter, Marie Anne de la Croix, born in Brussels in 1641 and died a nun in Madrid in 1715. His body was brought to Spain in 1643, and 12,000 requiem Masses were performed in accordance with his last wishes. He was buried in the Pante√≥n de Infantes. Disputes about his successor as the Governor-General of the Spanish Netherlands destroyed the alliance between the Emperor in Vienna and the Spanish in Madrid. The Emperor (by now the Cardinal-Infante's old comrade in arms, Ferdinand III) favored his brother Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria, a militarily unfortunate but otherwise a capable ruler. Madrid favored John of Austria the Younger, the twelve-year-old illegitimate son of Philip IV and the actress Mar√≠a Calder√≥n. The inauguration of the unpopular bastard was delayed, and the rule of the Spanish Netherlands was taken over by Francisco de Mello, Marquis of Terceira.

It is named after historic Hallsches Tor (Halle Gate) of the Berlin Customs Wall, erected in the 18th century. Overview The historic gate of the Customs Wall, laid out from 1737 onwards to replace the medieval city fortifications, marked the southern tip of the Friedrichstadt neighbourhood. It was located at the southern end of Friedrichstra√üe and the Rondell (renamed Belle-Alliance-Platz in 1815 and Mehringplatz in 1946). Neighbouring gates were on Potsdamer Platz in the west and on Wassertorplatz (Water Gate) in the east, where the present course of the U1 viaduct roughly corresponds to the former city wall. South of the gate, a wooden bridge led across the Landwehr Canal; from here the road ran via Tempelhof to the city of Halle, part of Brandenburg-Prussia since 1680. The present-day stone bridge was built between 1874 and 1876. Construction, 1901 The U1 and U3 platform on an elevated railway at the northern banks of the Landwehr Canal opened on 18 February 1902 with Berlin's first U-Bahn line (Stammstrecke) from Stralauer Tor to Potsdamer Platz. The underground U6 (then: Linie C) platform was finished on 30 January 1923, linked by a pedestrian tunnel. Up to today, changing from one platform to the other is (for Berlin) a quite long distance.J. Meyer-Kronthaler: Berlins U-Bahnh√∂fe. be.bra Verlag (1996) Though severely damaged by the bombing of Berlin in World War II, both parts of the station had to be shut down due to numerous bombing hits and electricity shortage in April 1945. U-Bahn service at the underground platform was already resumed on 4 July 1945; a provisional upper platform opened in October. The viaduct was rebuilt by 1949, the lower platform was elongated and refurbished in 1976.

Overview Gleisdreieck accident, 1908 The station's name literally means \\"railway triangle,\\" or wye in English, and marks the spot of an earlier major train hub that opened in 1902, where the three branches of the first Stammstrecke U-Bahn line from Zoologischer Garten, Potsdamer Platz and Warschauer Br√ºcke met. A major accident at the triangle happened on 26 September 1908, when two trains collided. One car derailed and fell from the viaduct, killing 18 people and injuring 21. Upon another dangerous incident, the single level triangle from 1912 was rebuilt and replaced by the current two-level station. Since then there is no direct rail connection between the two lines at Gleisdreieck, but only an intersection. Lower U2 platform Though in 1939 the North-South Tunnel was opened in the vicinity, there is no interchange with the S-Bahn system.J. Meyer-Kronthaler, Berlins U-Bahnh√∂fe, Berlin: be.bra, 1996 On 28‚Äì29 January 1944, the viaduct suffered heavy bombing, and on 14 February 1945, there were additional serious bombing impacts causing heavy air pressure damage to the station's steel construction. It took a direct hit on 3 February 1945, destroying a train. On 11‚Äì12 March 1945, the signal box was destroyed, and on 18 March 1945, the upper platform was destroyed. A viaduct was totally destroyed in the Battle of Berlin. After the building of the Berlin Wall beginning 13 August 1961, the lower platform became the eastern terminus of the U2, until service was finally discontinued on 1 January 1972. Between 1984 and 1991 it served as the southern terminal of the short-lived M-Bahn maglev running to Kemperplatz near the Philharmonie. The U2 train service on the lower platform was restarted on 13 November 1993. It is the westernmost station in Kreuzberg for both lines. The German Museum of Technology (Deutsches Technikmuseum) is adjacent to the station. The name Gleisdreieck also refers to a large area in the south, the former freight yards of the Anhalter and Potsdamer Bahnhof, which have been redeveloped as an urban park.

Although his only album to date, ...och stora havet, was released in 1989, he is still well known in his native country. Background The son of two teachers, Jakob Hellman grew up in rural north Sweden, just south of the polar circle. In school, he was in the same class as Zemya Hamilton, later to be known as the lead singer of house music act Clubland. In the lyrics of his first single, Hellman states that he was \\"born between the mirror and the grammophone\\" (\\"f√∂dd mellan spegeln och grammofon\\"), attesting to his early pop star ambitions. At a young age, he played in a local band, Ampere, with his friends Anders Viklund, Ulf Johansson and Tommy Johansson. In a 2006 interview, the members recalled singing through a megaphone at the start, since they did not have a proper microphone. At the start, the only song they could play was \\"Smoke on the Water\\". Later, \\"Do You Wanna Dance?\\" and \\"The House of the Rising Sun\\" were added to the repertoire. Jakob Hellman's family later moved to Falun, where he played with a band named Fortune. In the mid-1980s, Jakob Hellman moved to Stockholm. Since the 1990s, Hellman resides in Malm√∂ in Southwestern Sweden. He became a father for the first time in 2009. In July 2014, he married Karolina Svensson and went on a summer tour of Sweden. The recording of ...och stora havet Without previous experience of the music business, Jakob Hellman sent his demo to ten different record companies in December 1987. Magnus Nygren, at the time A&R; at the Swedish division of EMI Music, took interest and arranged a meeting. Much to his own surprise, Hellman soon had a record contract in his hand. Recordings started in the EMI studio in the Stockholm suburb of Sk√§rmarbrink in 1988. Hellman also spent some time touring, opening for the rock band Wilmer X. Session musicians included Per H√§gglund from Imperiet (keyboards), Eddie Sj√∂berg, ex-member of Reeperbahn (guitar), Werner Modigg√•rd from Eldkvarn (drums), and Wilmer X member Mats Bengtsson (piano). Titiyo provided backing vocals for the song \\"Avundsjuk p√• dej\\". In a 2007 interview in a Jakob Hellman special on the Swedish public service music radio show Musikjournalen (broadcast on 15 January 2007 on SR P3), producer Dan Sundquist told the story of a rather strenuous recording experience, due to Hellman's unwillingness to compromise with his convictions on how the music ought to sound. Many of the participating musicians support his view stating that Hellman wanted the album to sound rawer and rockier.http://home.swipnet.se/nolander/hellman2.html =The album's release= The first single, \\"T√•g\\" (Train) was released in 1988. The same year Jakob Hellman won a Grammis (the Swedish equivalent of a Grammy Award) as Best Newcomer. The album followed on 13 February 1989. Seven out of the nine songs featured on the demo were included on the album. The original release contained twelve tracks; a later reissue adds the single B-sides and a few other tracks for a total of 19. Although Hellman himself wanted to name the album De sista melodierna (The Last Melodies) it instead borrowed its title from one of the non-single songs, ...Och stora havet (...And the great sea). Musically, most of the album's songs can be described as quite radio-friendly guitar-based music in the singer-songwriter vein, although Hellman's syncopated singing style set him apart from most of the competition. In interviews, Jakob Hellman cited Elvis Costello as his greatest influence, and although his music by no means could be called a carbon copy, similarities can easily be found. The lyrics, entirely in Swedish, range from rather simple love songs to more philosophical themes. They are characterized by inventive turns of phrase, often imitated by followers. =Reception= At the time of its release, Hellman's album got positive, although not jubilant, reviews, and the single \\"Vara v√§nner\\" (Being Friends) became a major hit. The accompanying video is notable for its extremely minimalistic scenography. At the 1989 Swedish Grammis Awards Jakob Hellman won the Best Male Rock artist award, but not the Best Album one (it was given to Jerry Williams). With the passing of time, however, the record has come to be regarded as one of the most influential Swedish pop records, and in 1997 it was voted the best Swedish record ever in N√∂jesguiden, a monthly entertainment magazine. A few covers of Hellman's songs have been recorded. In 1997, the band Jumper had a minor hit with the single \\"Hon har ett s√§tt\\". The track was also remixed by house music act Antiloop. In 2006, singers Anna Stadling and Idde Schultz covered the B-side \\"V√§gar hem\\" on an album named after the song. As of 2007, ...och stora havet has sold a total of over 160,000 copies. =After the album= Hellman did not succeed in following up the album's major success despite writing songs ‚Äì one titled \\"Min Marie\\" was debuted live in √ñrebro in April 1989http://www.hakanpettersson.se/blogg.php?id=2823 ‚Äì for an album intended for release one year after the debut. After appearing on an Evert Taube tribute album and featuring in a duet with folk-rock act Perssons Pack in 1991, he withdrew from the spotlight entirely. Reluctantly interviewed, he told journalists he had been studying different subjects at Lund University and had no plans for a new record despite later admitting to writing a large number of songs that he kept in a cassette tape archive at his home. In 1995, he briefly joined Brainpool in the studio to provide backing vocals for the Painkiller album track \\"We aim to please\\". In the end of the 1990s Hellman started to occasionally appear on stage again. In recent years, Hellman has been playing several smaller venues and minor festivals, performing both old and unreleased tracks, fueling his fans' hopes for a return to recording. In 2005 Hellman did enter the studio for the first time in a decade, contributing two covers to an Olle Adolphson tribute album. The following year, he appeared on a duet with Nina Ramsby, \\"Du min v√§n\\", on the Nina Ramsby & Martin Hederos album Jazzen. However, these episodes seem to be isolated events. In recent years, Hellman has completed three tours in Sweden in 2011 ‚Äì 2012, playing many new songs alongside his classics,http://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/musik/rockbjornen/article14117340.ab and played one show only in 2013, at the club Debaser in Stockholm in December.http://debaser.se/kalender/12831/I Interviews In a 2005 interview (in Bo.stad, a magazine for the tenants of the Lund student housing foundation AF Bost√§der), Hellman, at the time living in a shared flat in Malm√∂, speculated on \\"maybe\\" releasing a new album some day, although not in the immediate future. \\"Not in the next six months, anyway. If I found the right musicians to work with, maybe in another genre, it would be fun. I want to do simple songs, which is what I'm good at.\\" The same year, he recorded two songs, \\"Lenas Visa\\" and \\"Mina B√•tar\\", for the Olle Adolphson tribute album Dubbeltrubbel. In July 2006, his childhood band Ampere reformed to play at the Kulturkraft festival in Vuollerim. \\"It is fun to play in a band again. [...] Compared to being on my own, playing under my own name, it feels very relaxed,\\" Hellman commented. In the 2007 Musikjournalen Hellman radio special, Jakob Hellman spoke about feeling as if he were the album's \\"luxury wife\\", still partly living off its revenue. He said a new album felt \\"far away\\", and that he was focusing on writing one song at a time to be able to play live.

At work are (l. to r.) Ed Dodd, Jack Elrod, Tom Hill and Rhett Carmichael. The 130-acre Lost Forest was the model for the fictional Lost Forest National Forest in the strip. Dodd's house was located on Marsh Creek, a tributary of the Chattahoochee River. To see this image at full resolution, go to the Preservation Society for Spring Creek Forest. Mark Trail is a newspaper comic strip created by the American cartoonist Ed Dodd. Introduced April 15, 1946, the strip centers on environmental and ecological themes. As of 2020, King Features syndicated the strip to \\"nearly 150 newspapers and digital outlets worldwide.\\" https://www.comicskingdom.com/mark-trail When Mark Trail began, it was syndicated through the New York Post in 1946 to 45 newspapers. Dodd, working as a national parks guide, had long been interested in environmental issues. The character is loosely based on the life and career of Charles N. Elliott (November 29, 1906 - May 1, 2000). At the time a U.S. forest ranger, Elliott would go on to edit Outdoor Life magazine from 1956 to 1974. Dodd once said that the physical model for Trail was John Wayt, his former neighbor in north Atlanta. Characters and story Mark Trail, the main character, is a photojournalist and outdoor magazine writer whose assignments lead him into danger and adventure. His assignments inevitably lead him to discover environmental misdeeds, most often solved with a crushing right cross. Trail lives in the fictional Lost Forest National Forest with his St. Bernard, Andy; veterinarian Doc Davis; Doc's daughter, and Trail's girlfriend and eventual wife, Cherry, and their adopted son, Rusty. \\"Mark reflects a reverence for God's creatures, nature, and the conservation of woods, water and wildlife\\" (Hill, 2003). His assignments in later story arcs tended to involve more sleuthing than wildlife photojournalism. *Mark Trail ‚Äì Wildlife photographer and writer for Woods and Wildlife Magazine. In his early 30s; honest and upright; his strongest imprecation was famously \\"What th'?!\\" *Rusty ‚Äì Introduced in 1981, Rusty Wilson is an orphan and the nephew of an abusive alcoholic named Joe. Rusty bonds with Sassy, one of a litter of Dalmatian puppies, against his animal-hating uncle's wishes. When Joe abandoned Sassy in the woods, Rusty went looking for her and became lost as well, until he was discovered by Mark and Cherry. Mark's intervention saved Rusty's life, and he was taken in as one of their own. Rusty was officially adopted into the Trail family in 1993, when Mark and Cherry married. *Andy ‚Äì Mark's faithful Saint Bernard and personal accountant. *Cherry Davis ‚Äì Longtime (47 years) girlfriend of Mark until they married in 1993, living with Mark and her father (Doc) at Lost Forest. She is usually a supporting character, but she has sometimes (e.g., 1998) had her own wildlife adventures. *Tom \\"Doc\\" Davis ‚Äì A veterinarian who is Cherry's elderly father. *Johnny Malotte ‚Äì A presumably French-Canadian outdoorsman friend of Mark's since the 1950s, living with his family in the Quetico area of western Ontario, and recently reintroduced into the strip. *Kelly Welly ‚Äì Pretty wildlife photographer whose flirtations with Mark, and competitiveness with him, land both of them in trouble; a semiregular character. *Bill Ellis ‚Äì Mark and Kelly's editor at Woods and Wildlife Magazine, appearing intermittently when sending Mark on another assignment. *Ranger Rick Rogers ‚Äì Wildlife ranger (2006), one of Mark's ubiquitous friends and contacts around the country who tend to appear in single adventures (possibly named for the National Wildlife Federation's mascot Ranger Rick) Cartoonists Jack Elrod at work on a Mark Trail Sunday strip In the mid-1940s, Ed Dodd was employed in advertising. Dodd and Jack Elrod met when they were with the Boy Scouts; Dodd was a Scout leader and Elrod was a Scout. In 1946, after Dodd sold Mark Trail to a syndicate, the strip was launched on April 15 in the New York Post.Mark Trail at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on February 13, 2016. In 1950, Dodd hired Elrod to work as the strip's background artist and letterer. During the late 1940s, the cartoonist Jack Davis worked one summer inking Mark Trail, which he later parodied in Mad as \\"Mark Trade.\\" In addition to Davis and Elrod, Dodd also hired Tom Hill, Barbara Chen (who did the lettering) and secretary Rhett Carmichael. The strip's popularity grew through the mid-1960s, with Mark Trail appearing in nearly 500 newspapers through the North America Syndicate. Artist and naturalist Tom Hill, who joined Dodd on Mark Trail in 1946, drew the Sunday strip, which was devoted to natural history and wildlife education, until 1978. Hill drew most of the daily strip art too after 1950, freeing Dodd to specialize in the scripting. Tom Hill's son, Jack Hill, recalled life at Dodd's studio in the Lost Forest outside Atlanta: :The art studio where Tom Hill (my father), Jack Elrod and Barbara Chen worked was on the second floor, where they had a great view of the Forest. There was also a homesteader, groundskeeper Hubert Hamrick and his family, who lived at Lost Forest and maintained the ranch and animals. Besides native wildlife which abounded on the Forest, there was riding stables, guinea fowl, caged pigeons, a 10-acre fishing lake and of course, Andy, the great Saint Bernard who appeared as Mark‚Äôs companion in the comic strip. I would visit Andy every time I went to visit Ed Dodd or to go fishing at the Lost Forest lake. Andy never had the freedom of his fictional counterpart and was kept in a running pen bounded by chain links. Ed‚Äôs other dog, Mose, was usually found at his master‚Äôs feet as Ed smoked his afternoon pipe. Famous people would visit Lost Forest, such as Marlin Perkins, sharpshooters, big game hunters and newspaper/magazine journalists. Ed Dodd was a personal friend of Daniel Beard, one of the founders of the Boy Scouts in 1910 and a fellow naturalist and illustrator. They both attended the Art Students League in New York City.Hill, Jack. \\"Memories of Lost Forest,\\" lecture at the Pleasant Oaks Gem and Mineral Society, June 5, 2003. Dodd retired in 1978, shortly after Hill died. Elrod then continued the strip, adding new characters and taking over the Sunday edition. Based on the complaint of a reader in 1983, Elrod had Mark Trail abandon the trademark pipe that had been part of him from the beginning under likewise pipe-smoking Dodd; and in 1993, Mark and Cherry finally married. In 2010, after years of tutoring, Jack Elrod brought on the assistance of artist James Allen. Allen initially began assisting on the weekly Sunday page, continuing the themes of wildlife education and natural history and also alerting readers to endangered species and notifications of newly discovered species as well. Starting with the strip dated April 11, 2014, Elrod retired as the strip's primary artist, and Allen formally took over the position, though Elrod-drawn Sunday strips continued to appear for two months. Elrod died on February 3, 2016, at the age of 91. By mutual consent with the syndicate, Allen abruptly left the position as Mark Trail's artist and writer in 2020.\\"JAMES ALLEN AND MARK TRAIL TAKE DIFFERENT PATHS\\" The feature was right in the middle of a story arc, which was left unresolved. Beginning July 27, 2020, Mark Trail began rerunning daily strips from the Jack Elrod era. New Allen-penned Sunday strips continued through August 16, 2020, after which point Jack Elrod-era Sunday pages were rerun. Jules Rivera, creator of the webcomic Love, Joolz, took over the strip after Allen's departure, with her run beginning on October 12, 2020.https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/25/arts/mark-trail-new-cartoonist.html Reception According to the Fish and Wildlife Service, \\"Elrod's comics typically present information promoting public awareness of imperiled species.\\"Jack Elrod A notable exception is the strip that ran on March 11, 2007, which depicted the African Elephant not as imperiled, but as a peril itself. Letters appeared in numerous papers taking issue with the strip's contention that, \\"The two main killers in East Africa are HIV/AIDS and wild animals, particularly elephants.\\" Several papers ran letters to the editor objecting to this assertion. Jack Hill has criticized the strip for declining in quality since 1978. According to Hill, the earlier versions of the strip featured well-written plot and character development and a detailed art style, whereas later versions were marked by a loss of accuracy and detail and \\"a free-floating approach to perspective.\\" In addition, time froze: scenes and plots have been recycled from the past. According to King Features, Mark now stays \\"forever 32\\". Ironically, these changes, along with the uneven art work and misplaced speech balloons (often pointed at foregrounded animals), attracted a new following among fans called \\"Trailheads\\". In some cases, daily strips have recycled art and slightly updated plots from 20- or 30-year-old strips. Updating includes deleting pipes and ashtrays, and rearranging panels. Close-ups of recycled animal art are added to cover extraneous word balloons or to create a new panel to add new dialogue.\\"Mark Trail: 1979 versus 2010\\" at These Strange Worlds (via archive.org) Soon after being brought in to assist on the Sunday strip in 2010, James Allen also started assisting on the daily stories as well. Some readers and fan sites noted a realistic change in the characters' anatomy and the sense of perspective in both longshots and landscapes. Radio On January 30, 1950, Mutual Broadcasting System launched a radio adaptation, Mark Trail, featuring Matt Crowley in the title role. The 30-minute episodes aired three times weekly, and 174 episodes were produced, running until June 8, 1951. A second radio series, starring Staats Cotsworth, was broadcast on ABC beginning September 18, 1950, with 51 half-hour shows that ran thrice weekly until January, 1952. The series then switched to a 15-minute format, producing 125 episodes that aired weekdays through June 27, 1952. Only a handful of the 15-minute episodes are known to have survived. The Minneapolis-St. Paul, public radio station KFAI hosted Mark Trail Radio Theatre starting in 1991. Produced by Babs Economon, its 17 adventures aired in 228 weekly installments on Friday evenings through September 2002. A National Weather Service public service announcement using Mark Trail to promote NOAA Weather Radio. In 1997, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) began using Mark Trail as its official mascot, making him the voice of the National Weather Service and NOAA Weather Radio. A television pilot for a \\"Mark Trail\\" series was filmed in Australia and Canada in 1969, starring Todd Armstrong as Trail, and Robert Dunlap as Scotty. Produced by Bob Stabler, the pilot also featured Michael Pate, Gordon McDougall, and Susan Lloyd.A Worthy New TV Hero; Sydney Morning Herald, November 27th 1969, p.6. Books and magazines Mark Trail: The Magazine of Adventure for Boys Between 1955 and 1959, Mark Trail's adventures were reprinted in comic books by Fawcett Publications and then Standard/Nedor/Pines. The strip spawned numerous books and coloring books, including: *Mark Trail's Book of Animals (North American Mammals) by Ed Dodd (1955) *Mark Trail's 2nd Book of Animals: (North American Mammals) by Ed Dodd (1959) *Mark Trail's Hunting Tips by Ed Dodd (1969) *Mark Trail's Cooking Tips by Ed Dodd (1971) *Mark Trail's Camping Tips by Ed Dodd (1971) *Mark Trail in the Smokies!: A Naturalist's Look at Great Smokey Mountains National Park and the Southern Appalachians by Ed Dodd (1989) For the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, Elrod wrote and illustrated coloring books which have been distributed to students throughout the U.S. They include: Wetlands Coloring Book, Take Pride in America with Mark Trail: A Coloring Book, and Mark Trail Tells the Story of a Fish in Trouble. The 1950s magazine, Mark Trail: The Magazine of Adventure for Boys, merged with The American Boy and The Open Road for Boys. The magazine was aimed at boys in the 9-17 age group to guide them in natural history and conservation. Awards James Allen at the head of the Mark Trail Wilderness in the Chattahoochee National Forest Mark Trail has won more than 30 conservation awards from private organizations and government agencies, including the American Waterfowl and Wetland Association, the Georgia Wildlife Association, the National Forest Association, the National Wildlife Federation, the U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service. An annual Mark Trail Award is presented to individuals, organizations or corporations that assist in expanding the radio network, or recognizing courageous effort in saving lives during weather or civil emergencies. Mark Trail has also appeared in a number of publications by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in efforts to educate children concerning conservation and environmentalism. In 1991, Congress allocated 16,400 acres (67 km2) of former logged forest along the Appalachian Trail in Georgia to be designated the Mark Trail Wilderness. As of 2006, Mark Trail remains the only comic strip character to be recognized in such a manner, although an official association between Walt Kelly's Pogo and the Okefenokee Swamp was established in 1987, with an Annual Pogo Fest, followed by Pogo and the U.S. Postal Service's 1989 inauguration of a National Wetlands postcard dedicated to the Okefenokee Swamp.

Kristen is best known for her role as Judy Robinson, the oldest child of Professor John Robinson and his wife Maureen, in the television series Lost in Space (1965‚Äì1968). Her character was a young adult, around 20 years of age. Early life Kristen was born Birgit Annalisa Rusanen in Oslo, Norway, to a Finnish mother and a German soldier father who was killed during World War II. She spent her first years in an orphanage in Norway, and was then adopted in 1949 by an American couple from Detroit, Michigan, Harold Oliver Soderquist, and Bertha, who renamed her Martha Annalise Soderquist. Her adoptive father was a professor of education at Wayne University, Detroit. Marta also has an adopted brother whom her parents adopted later. In 1959, Kristen moved to Los Angeles, California when her father was on a sabbatical. She remained there, with a guardian, and is a graduate of Santa Monica High School.  Career  Reflecting her Scandinavian heritage, she adopted the more European-sounding \\"Marta\\" and used Marta Kristen as her stage name. She first appeared in a 1961 episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, \\"Bang! You're Dead\\", alongside Billy Mumy, who later co-starred with Kristen in Lost in Space.

This inorganic chemical exists in the anhydrous form, as well as the dihydrate (MnCl2¬∑2H2O) and tetrahydrate (MnCl2¬∑4H2O), with the tetrahydrate being the most common form. Like many Mn(II) species, these salts are pink, with the paleness of the color being characteristic of transition metal complexes with high spin d5 configurations.N. N. Greenwood, A. Earnshaw, Chemistry of the Elements, 2nd ed., Butterworth-Heinemann, Oxford, UK, 1997. Preparation Manganese chloride is produced by treating manganese(IV) oxide with concentrated hydrochloric acid. :MnO2 \\\\+ 4 HCl ‚Üí MnCl2 \\\\+ 2 H2O + Cl2 This reaction was once used for the manufacture of chlorine. By carefully neutralizing the resulting solution with MnCO3, one can selectively precipitate iron salts, which are common impurities in manganese dioxide.. Sample of anhydrous MnCl2.

Each Mn center is coordinated to four doubly bridging chloride ligands. The octahedron is completed by a pair of mutually trans aquo ligands. Subunit of MnCl2(H2O)2 lattice. Chemical properties The hydrates dissolve in water to give mildly acidic solutions with a pH of around 4. These solutions consist of the metal aquo complex [Mn(H2O)6]2+. It is a weak Lewis acid, reacting with chloride ions to produce a series of solids containing the following ions [MnCl3]‚àí, [MnCl4]2‚àí, and [MnCl6]4‚àí. Both [MnCl3]‚àí and [MnCl4]2‚àí are polymeric. Upon treatment with typical organic ligands, manganese(II) undergoes oxidation by air to give Mn(III) complexes.

When manganese chloride is added to a vesicular solution, Mn2+ paramagnetic ions are released, perturbing the relaxation time of the phospholipids' phosphate groups and broadening the resulting 31P resonance signal. Only phospholipids located in the outermost monolayer exposed to Mn2+ experience this broadening. The effect is negligible for multilamellar vesicles, but for large unilamellar vesicles, a ~50% reduction in signal intensity is observed.

It is situated east of Shildon and north-west of Newton Aycliffe. The village is situated near a quarry that was mined by the people many generations ago. There is one public house in the village, the Bay Horse. History Following the fall of the Roman Empire, the Angles arrived in the area around 500 AD and created several settlements, including Middridge. The name \\"Middridge\\" is derived from its location at that time on the \\"middle ridge\\" between Eldon and School Aycliffe (near the current Aycliffe golf course). Anglo-Saxon Middridge lasted for five hundred years before being destroyed by the Normans during William the Conqueror's Harrying of the North. Those who survived this massacre (and the resulting disease and starvation) were enslaved by the invaders. They were forced by the Bishop of Durham to toil in the surrounding fields as serfs, and forcibly relocated to gloomy huts centred on the village green. The \\"serfs\\" eventually gained their freedom and the village green survives to this day, although the housing has improved considerably. The arrival of the industrial age in the nineteenth century resulted in two coal mines: Charles Pit and Eden Pit. These pits were collectively known as Middridge Colliery, and provided employment for hundreds of people in their heyday while producing a combined daily total of 600 tons of coal,http://www.dmm.org.uk/colliery/m032.htm before closing in the early 20th century. The remains of this era live on in the names of places such as Charles Row, Eden Grove and the \\"pit heap\\", a small hill used in the winter as a sledge run. Until recently, the pit heap was also used to host the annual village bonfire. Notable buildings, structures and features Middridge Grange is a Grade II listed building situated just outside the village itself, between Shildon and School Aycliffe. It is one of the oldest buildings in the region, beginning life as a large Elizabethan manor in 1578. However, the current Middridge Grange bears little resemblance to the original manor, much of which was destroyed by fire in the 19th century. Used as a farmhouse, it has been owned by the Scott family since the early 20th century but has not been lived in since the 1970s, after falling into serious disrepair. A site of great interest to historians, it is currently undergoing an extensive renovation. Middridge Village Hall was originally built as a school for the children of the village and local farming community. It served this purpose for many years, but due to a continuing fall in pupil numbers in the 1950s and 1960s and changes in education policy, it closed. To prevent the building becoming derelict, the committee of the village association took over the administration of the hall. After various repairs and alterations, it became the village hall, which it has been for well over thirty years. The village hall is used as a venue for discos, church services, parties and social gatherings such as the monthly wine club. The hall has recently been refurbished, with an entirely new roof section, plumbing structure and electrical system. Middridge Quarry is a site of special scientific interest. Famous residents The Byerley Turk, the great stallion owned by the then Captain (later Colonel) Robert Byerley, was arguably Middridge's most famous resident. The Byerley Turk was one of the threeThe Byerley Turk by Jeremy James, publ. Merlin Unwin Books, founding stallions of today's thoroughbred horses and was stood at Middridge Grange, until being moved to Goldsborough Hall, near Knaresborough, North Yorkshire, when his owner married his cousin, Mary Wharton, in 1692. Robert Byerley was the son of Colonel Anthony Byerley, a cavalry officer who served Charles I in a unit known as \\"Byerley's Bulldogs\\". The Byerley line eventually died out, but their name lives on in place names around the region, such as Byerley Park and Byerley Road. It is believed that King Charles I of England took refuge in Middridge Grange during the English Civil War. John Marley (geologist) was born at Middridge Grange in 1823. He made the commercial discovery of Cleveland ironstone which led to the industrial growth of Middlesbrough. Legends and folklore The Middridge fairies (or faeries) are, according to legend, very different from the kind, winged fairies of popular culture. They are rumoured to be evil demons that scourge people and generally cause mischief. The story goes that the fairies chased a traveller, who took refuge in Middridge Grange, getting inside the building just before the pitchfork struck the door. The pitchfork mark was reputedly on this door for many years afterwards. They were also blamed for disruptions to the building of the Stockton and Darlington railway. The village fete Middridge village fete is a yearly event for the local community (but people come from miles around). It is usually a combination of a jumble sale, children's entertainment, competitions and other events, usually ending in a barbecue that is enjoyed alongside copious amounts of alcohol. Archeology In 1974, during excavations for the foundation of the Bay Horse Pub extension, a hoard of coins mainly dating from Edward 1 era was found. Known as \\"The Middridge Hoard\\", the significant hoard was mainly distributed at an auction by Dinning in 1976, although some remain in the Dorman Long Museum in Middlesbrough, and the British Treasury Museum in London. The hoard of 3072 coins was estimated to be buried in 1311, and consisted of mainly English, but also Irish, Scottish and Continental coins. References * Leighton, H.R.

It is situated about 825 km south of Suez, 260 km east of Aswan in Upper Egypt and 140 km south of Marsa Alam. It was founded in 275 BC by Ptolemy II Philadelphus (285‚Äì246 BC), who named it after his mother, Berenice I of Egypt.\\"A Letter Concerning Boats in Berenike and Trade on the Red Sea.\\" Michael Peppard. Zeitschrift f√ºr Papyrologie und Epigraphik, Bd. 171 (2009), p. 196. Troglodytica refers to the aboriginal people of the region, the \\"Troglodytai\\" or \\"cave dwellers\\". Although the name is attested by several ancient writers, the more ancient Ptolemaic inscriptions read Trogodytai (which G.W.B. Huntingford has speculated could be related to the same root as Tuareg). It is possible that later copyists confused this name with the more common term Troglodytai. Built at the head of a gulf, the Sinus Immundus, or Foul Bay, of Strabo, it was sheltered on the north by Ras Benas (Lepte Extrema). A lofty range of mountains runs along this side of the African coast, and separates Berenice from the Nile Valley. The emerald mines of Zabara and Saket are in its neighbourhood. The harbour is indifferent, but was improved by art. Berenice stood upon a narrow rim of shore between the hills and the Red Sea. The harbor of Berenice was sheltered from the northeast wind by the island Ophiodes (, Strabo xvi. p. 770; Diod. iii. 39), which was rich in topazes. History Berenice was quite famous and prosperous in antiquity. The city is noted by most ancient geographers, including Strabo, Pliny the Elder (vi. 23, 26, 29, 33), and Stephanus of Byzantium (s. v.). Its prosperity after the third century was owing in great measure to three causes: the favour of the Macedonian kings, its safe anchorage, and its being a terminus of the great road from Coptos (now Qift) on the Nile, which rendered Berenice and Myos Hormos the two principal emporia of the trade between Aethiopia and Egypt on the one hand, and Syria, Tamilakkam and Tamraparni (ancient Sri Lanka) on the other. The road across the desert from Coptos was 258 Roman miles long, or eleven days' journey. The road was provided with watering stations (Greek hydreumata, see Hadhramaut); the wells and halting places of the caravans are enumerated by Pliny (vi. 23. s. 26), and in the Itineraries (Antonin. p. 172, f.). Belzoni (Travels, vol. ii. p. 35) found traces of several of these stations. From the 1st century BC until the 2nd century AD, Berenice was one of the trans-shipping points of trade between India, Sri Lanka, Arabia, and Upper Egypt. It was connected to Antino√∂polis on the River Nile in Lower Egypt by the Via Hadriana in 137. The trade from Berenice along the Red Sea coast is described in the 1st century AD travelogue Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, written by a Greek merchant based in Alexandria. The Periplus indicates that \\"on the right-hand coast next below Berenice is the country of the Berbers\\", thereby placing Berenice Troglodytica just north of ancient Barbara. In the 4th century Berenice again become an active port, but after the 6th century the port was abandoned. Under the Roman Empire, Berenice formed a district unto itself, with its peculiar prefect, who was entitled Praefectus Berenicidis, or P. montis Berenicidis. (Orelli, Inscr. Lat. no. 3880, f.) In 1818, the ruins of Berenice were identified by Giovanni Battista Belzoni, confirming an earlier opinion of D'Anville. Since then, several excavations have been undertaken. The port is now nearly filled up, has a sand-bar at its entrance and can be reached only by small craft. Most important of the ruins is a temple; the remnants of its sculptures and inscriptions preserve the name of Tiberius and the figures of many deities, including a (goddess?) Alabarch or Arabarch, also the name of the head magistrate of the Jews in Alexandria under Ptolemaic and Roman rule. The temple is of sandstone and soft calcareous stone, in the Egyptian style. It is long, and 43 wide. A portion of its walls is sculptured with well-executed basso relieves, of Greek workmanship, and hieroglyphics also occasionally occur on the walls. Belzoni said that the city measured from north to south, and 2,000 from east to west. He estimated the ancient population at 10,000. (Researches, vol. ii. p. 73.) Recent archaeological finds A visit to Berenice, Wellsted, 1838 Ruins of a Temple - Wellsted, 1838 Excavations were launched at Berenike in 1994 by a team of archaeologists from the University of Delaware led by Prof. Steven E. Sidebotham, with partners from several other institutions and continued until 2001. Work was resumed by teams from the University of Delaware and the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology, University of Warsaw, Poland, in the winter of 2007/2008 and is still continuing. Apart from the excavations, non- invasive magnetic prospecting was carried out. Tomasz Herbich from the Institute of Archeology and Ethnology of the Polish Academy of Sciences made a magnetic map of the western part of the site. A large number of significant finds have been made providing evidence of the cargo from the Malabar Coast and the presence of Tamil people from South India and Jaffna being at this last outpost of the Roman Empire. :\\"Among the unexpected discoveries at Berenike were a range of ancient Indian goods, including the largest single concentration (7.55 kg) of black peppercorns ever recovered in the classical Mediterranean world (‚Äúimported from southern India‚Äù and found inside a large vessel made of Nile silt in a temple courtyard); substantial quantities of Indian-made fine ware and kitchen cooking ware and Indian style pottery; Indian-made sail cloth, basketry, matting, etc. from trash dumps; a large quantity of teak wood, black pepper, coconuts, beads made of precious and semi-precious stones, cameo blanks; ‚Äúa Tamil Brahmi graffito mentioning Korra, a South Indian chieftain‚Äù; evidence that ‚Äúinhabitants from Tamil South India (which then included most of Kerala) were living in Berenike, at least in the early Roman period‚Äù; evidence that the Tamil population implied the probable presence of Buddhist worshippers; evidence of Indians at another Roman port 300 km north of Berenike; Indian-made ceramics on the Nile road; a rock inscription mentioning an Indian passing through en route; ‚Äúabundant evidence for the use of ships built and rigged in India‚Äù; and proof ‚Äúthat teak wood (endemic to South India), found in buildings in Berenike, had clearly been reused‚Äù(from dismantled ships).\\" In 2009 the first find of frankincense was reported and \\"two blocks of resin from the Syrian fir tree (Abies cilicica), one weighting about 190 g and the other about 339 g, recovered from 1st- century AD contexts in one of the harbor trenches.

His producing credits included the series The Twilight Zone, Gilligan's Island, and Bewitched. He was a writer for such shows as Adventures in Paradise, The Dick Powell Show, Charlie's Angels, and The New Twilight Zone. He authored numerous books on screenwriting, including Screenwriting Tricks of the Trade, Zen and the Art of Screenwriting I and II, The Screenwriter Looks at The Screenwriter, and How I Escaped from Gilligan's Island: Adventures of a Hollywood Writer-Producer, published in 2005 by the University of Wisconsin Press. One of Froug's students, actor and screenwriter Dan O'Bannon, included a reference to Froug in the 1974 film Dark Star. O'Bannon's character, Sergeant Pinback, claims that his real name is \\"Bill Froug.\\" Early life William Froug was born in Brooklyn, New York in May 1922 and placed for adoption through the Louise Wise agency there. Soon after he was adopted by William and Rita Froug of Little Rock, Arkansas where he spent his childhood before the family moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma (Froug's Department Stores). He graduated from Little Rock Senior High School in 1939. The family home of Froug's grandfather, Abraham Froug, has been preserved as a historic home and is located adjacent to the Governor's Mansion in the Little Rock Historic District. Froug attended and graduated from the renowned Missouri School of Journalism at the University of Missouri in 1943 before enlisting in the U.S. Navy. He was selected for the V7 Navy Officer Training Program at Columbia University and graduated as one of the \\"90 Day Wonders\\". He served as an officer aboard a subchaser stationed at Pearl Harbor before taking command of his own ship, USS PC800, in 1945 at Eniwetok Atoll. Writing career After his honorable discharge in 1946, he set to work on his passion and gift for writing. He sold his first novella to True Detective Magazine in 1946. He then moved into radio writing and was Vice President of Programs at CBS Radio Hollywood by 1956. Among his radio work, Froug produced, directed, and adapted for CBS Radio, Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, which is listed as one of the 50 greatest radio programs of the 20th century. He then transitioned into television and in the 1958‚Äì59 awards period won both an Emmy and a Producer of the Year award for the Alcoa-Goodyear Theatre production of \\"Eddie.\\" He was also nominated for the Producer of the Year award by the Producers Guild of America for his work on Mr. Novak, Playhouse 90 and The Twilight Zone.http://www.emmys.com/news/interviews-project- news/writerproducer-william-froug-turns-90 As a writer-producer he went on to write numerous optioned screenplays, one of which was bought by 3 different studios, and wrote and/or produced for such iconic television series as Adventures in Paradise, The Twilight Zone, Bewitched and Gilligan's Island. James Michener sent him a telegram congratulating him on the script he wrote for Adventures in Paradise, \\"Angel of Death,\\" calling it, \\"A real achievement.\\" His shows were called must-see TV for millions of viewers and fans. He wrote more than 100 scripts for other series' such as Bonanza, Quincy M.E., Paper Chase and Charlie's Angels, among other top shows. The pilot for which he served as a producer, Adam's Rib, was accepted into the permanent collection of the Museum of Broadcasting in New York. Froug was nominated for another Emmy as producer on Bewitched, became executive producer in charge of drama at CBS, and began lecturing at USC's film school before leaving for UCLA as an adjunct professor. He authored numerous books on screenwriters and screenwriting and continued in leadership positions with the Writer's Guild of America West and Producer's Guild of America. In 1987 Froug was honored with the prestigious Valentine Davies Award from the Writers Guild of America, West. Teaching As a tenured professor at UCLA, he revamped the screenwriting program and taught select graduate level courses. His advanced screenwriting seminars had long wait lists and were the most popular and inspiring courses, according to former students and colleagues. In a 1976 interview for the Los Angeles Times, Froug was quoted as saying. \\"I often tell my students at the first class that if one of them ever sells a screenplay, it will be a minor miracle\\". By that time, he had taught more than 500 students at USC and UCLA and said he guessed that fewer than 10 percent of those students would be able to make a career in film, let alone screenwriting. Froug retired from UCLA in 1987. He taught advanced screening writing courses in several countries in addition to colleges in Hawaii and Florida after his retirement. He found much joy in mentoring and was proud of the success of so many of his students. As an author, Froug's books were used as textbooks in film schools around the world. In The Ultimate Writer's Guide to Hollywood, author Skip Press describes Froug's Screenwriting Tricks of the Trade as \\"one of the best screenwriting books I've ever read\\" and listed the book in his \\"Top 10 Hollywood Reads.\\" In 2011 Froug was selected as one of the Emmy Legends of Television by the Archive of American Television. His interview is available online at EmmyLegends.org The UCLA Film and Television Archives hold many of his scripts, interviews and legacy items. The UCSB Special Collection Library holds his extensive research documents on the \\"Oklahoma Run\\" which he used for a proposed series, \\"El Dorado.\\" Personal life William Froug was a political and social activist and served on the boards of both the Writers Guild of America, West and Producers Guild of America. In addition, he was a founding member of \\"The Caucus for Producers, Writers and Directors\\" for which he served as both chair and co-chair over the years. Froug died at the age of 91 in August 2013 in Sarasota, Florida. Roger Ebert once wrote of Froug, \\"I know an old writer. His name is William Froug, he lives in Florida and if you look him up on Amazon, you will see he is still writing brilliant and useful books about screenwriting and teleplays. He is not merely as sharp as a tack, he is the standard by which they sharpen tacks. If he had been advising the kid, the kid would have made a better movie, and if he had been advising the director of 'The Man in the Chair,' we would have been spared the current experience. Just because you're old doesn't mean you have to be a decrepit caricature. One thing that keeps Froug young is that, unlike Flash Madden, he almost certainly does not sit on an expressway overpass guzzling Jack Daniels from a pint bottle.\\" References External links * 1922 births 2013 deaths Writers of books about writing fiction Writers from Little Rock, Arkansas UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television faculty American male screenwriters United States Navy officers Writers from New York City American television writers Television producers from New York City American male television writers Screenwriters from New York (state) Screenwriting instructors Missouri School of Journalism alumni Bewitched Screenwriters from California Screenwriters from Arkansas ","title":"William Froug"},{"id":"1382226","text":"The Naked Jungle is a 1954 American adventure film directed by Byron Haskin, and starring Charlton Heston and Eleanor Parker. Telling the story of an attack of army ants on a Brazilian cocoa plantation, it was based on the 1937 short story \\"Leiningen Versus the Ants\\" by Carl Stephenson. It is noteworthy for its use of special effects, especially the time-lapse photography, which was a hallmark of George Pal, and is often said to have been overlooked that year in the Oscar for Special Effects. However, the film is largely an unconventional romance, while the special effects, though impressive, are confined to the final scenes of the film.http://nzpetesmatteshot.blogspot.com/2010/06/george-pals-naked-jungle- more-ants-than.html Plot Set in 1901, Joanna arrives from New Orleans at a South American cocoa plantation to meet her new husband, plantation owner Christopher Leiningen. This has been arranged by his brother in New Orleans. Leiningen is upset that she is a widow, as he wished to marry a virgin. She tells him a piano plays better if it has already been played. Leiningen is cold and remote to her, rebuffing all her attempts to make friends with him. She is beautiful, independent, and arrives ready to be his stalwart helpmate. There is a strong sexual tension, which appears hard to resolve. Although there is a mutual softening he resolves to send her back to America. Leiningen decides to advance this plan by a month when he hears from the local commissioner of a potential attack by an army of ants, as he does not wish her to be harmed. As she awaits the boat to take her back to the United States, they learn that legions of army ants - the \\"marabunta\\" - will strike in a few days' time. Leiningen refuses to give up the home he fought so hard to create. Instead of evacuating, he resolves to make a stand against this indomitable natural predator. The ants take several days to arrive and during that time their joint effort brings them closer and love begins to blossom. Joanna joins the fight to save the plantation. Leiningen's most drastic action is blowing up a timber dam to flood his own estate, washing the ants away. Cast Production The screenplay was co-written by Ranald MacDougall and the blacklisted writer Ben Maddow. The film was produced in Technicolor by George Pal, who also made The War of the Worlds, Tom Thumb, and The Time Machine. William Conrad, who had starred as Leiningen in adaptations of Stephenson's story for the radio programs Escape and Suspense, appears in the film as a district commissioner. The unique \\"sound\\" of the ants devouring everything in their path was created by swirling a straw in a glass of water with crushed ice, which was then amplified. Much of the Rio Negro (Amazon) jungle riverscape, as well as the bridge dynamiting and sluice scenes, are second- unit stock footage shot in Florahome, Florida, according to IMDb. Impact The film was adapted for radio on the June 7, 1954 broadcast of the Lux Radio Theatre; Charlton Heston reprised his role as \\"Leiningen\\" and Donna Reed played \\"Joanna\\". A scene from the film was used in the 1971 film The Hellstrom Chronicle. The film strongly influenced the 1985 MacGyver episode \\"Trumbo's World\\", which also featured clips from the film. Trivia In 1970, it aired on WVUE-TV in New Orleans, Louisiana, as part of its highly publicized switch of channel positions with that city's PBS member station, WYES-TV.

Founded in 2003 by Burnie Burns, Matt Hullum, Geoff Ramsey, Jason Salda√±a, Gus Sorola, and Joel Heyman, Rooster Teeth is a subsidiary of Otter Media, which is itself a subsidiary of WarnerMedia Commercial, a division of AT&T;'s WarnerMedia. Rooster Teeth began with the production of Red vs. Blue, which premiered in April 2003 and is still in production, making it the longest-running episodic web series of all time. Due to server and web hosting costs, the founders created \\"Sponsorships\\" which is now known as \\"FIRST\\", a subscription to exclusive and earlier access to content and discounts on their merchandise store, among other benefits. The company later branched out into live-action shorts, series, comedy, Let's Play videos, and full animated productions. Other projects include reality shows, video game development, entertainment news programs, and podcasts. In 2015, Rooster Teeth released its feature-film debut Lazer Team, a science-fiction action comedy. The company hosts an annual convention, RTX, in several cities around the world. The company's videos are regularly released on its own website and app while podcasts and Let's Plays are still released on their YouTube channel as well. As of March 2019, Rooster Teeth's primary YouTube channel has 9.6 million subscribers and has over 5.8 billion video views. Including all of their other channels, they maintain over 45 million subscribers.  Company history  Rooster Teeth's office on Congress Street in Austin in 2008 While attending the University of Texas at Austin, Burnie Burns and Matt Hullum collaborated with actor Joel Heyman on a 1997 independent film called The Schedule.Moltenbrey, Gross. The film helped Hullum and Heyman to find work in Los Angeles, but otherwise had limited success.Moltenbrey Working for a local company named Telenetwork, Burns later met Geoff Ramsey (then named Geoff Fink), Gustavo Sorola, Dan Godwin, and Jason Salda√±a, and the five formed drunkgamers.com, a website where the five reviewed various video games while drunk.Gross; Konow, 1. According to Ramsey, the group tried to receive free games to review, but \\"incurred the wrath\\" of several game developers in doing so.Konow, 1. One of the non-gameplay videos that the drunkgamers crew created during this time was a live-action parody of the Apple Switch ad campaign. This video featured Sorola as the main actor, used Peter Tchaikovsky's \\"Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy\\" as background music, and focused on the lack of games available for the Apple Macintosh computer.Mac Gamer Switch Parody. Sorola and Burns said that the name change from 'Drunk Tank Podcast' to 'Rooster Teeth Podcast' was for the same reason that 'Drunk Gamers' was changed to 'Rooster Teeth': Nobody would give games or sponsor something with 'drunk' in the title \\"because it was so unprofessional.\\" On settling on Rooster Teeth, Burns stated, \\"We named it something else to give people the idea that we were going to be doing more than that\\". The name \\"Rooster Teeth\\" is a euphemism for \\"cockbite\\", an insult from the original Red vs. Blue trailer that Burns described as a \\"touchstone for the audience\\". Among the company's core philosophies, Burns stated, \\"we only make content that we would want to see ... it comes from a very genuine space. I think that our audience appreciates that voice\\". As of 2017, production costs for an episode vary from $15,000 to $100,000. Rooster Teeth's business strategy is a hybrid model composed of subscriptions, preroll ads, YouTube preroll ads, licensed studio productions, branded merchandise, and annual live events. Rooster Teeth has attributed their success to maintaining their community site and was reluctant to join YouTube initially, stating they viewed them as a \\"competitor\\". In 2014, having signed a two-year lease, the entire company (now consisting of over 90 employees) moved into Stage 5 at Austin Studios. In November 2014, Rooster Teeth was acquired by Fullscreen for an undisclosed amount. Rooster Teeth agreed to be bought to give itself \\"the resources and tools\\" needed to compete against other producers. Burns elaborated by saying they consider Netflix, HBO, and Amazon their current competition. On February 3, 2015, Burns confirmed that Rooster Teeth would be establishing an office in Los Angeles. These offices were used by a whole new division, Funhaus. The company released their feature film debut in 2015 with Lazer Team, a science fiction comedy. In 2016, Rooster Teeth hired three content executives to help with audience expansion: Luis Medina as Senior VP of Partnerships, Evan Bregman as Director of Programming and Ryan P. Hall as Head of Development. It was announced that Medina would co-manage the Let's Play family with Ramsey, including Achievement Hunter, Funhaus, and ScrewAttack, and manage partnerships with third-party brands such as Cow Chop and Kinda Funny. Bregman will be responsible for programming strategy and boosting growth across all platforms such as apps, the community site, YouTube, and Facebook. Hall will oversee Rooster Teeth's development slate and lead efforts to identify up-and-coming projects and talent. Each year, the company participates in Extra Life, a gaming-themed fundraiser with Rooster Teeth's proceeds going to Dell Children's Medical Center of Central Texas. During their 2017 Extra Life stream, they raised a total of US$1,209,970.73. The 2018 Extra Life stream raised $1,417,288 for Extra Life and Dell Children's Medical Center. The 2019 Extra Life stream raised US$1,222,371. On January 26, 2018, Fullscreen President and former COO Ezra Cooperstein was appointed as President of Rooster Teeth.

Animated, and Rooster Teeth's Murder Room, and also announced Spikeface, a new 2D/dark comedy show to be coproduced with Rob McElhenney and his RCG Productions. In December 2018, Otter Media restructured Fullscreen, consolidating Rooster Teeth, along with Crunchyroll and VRV, under Ellation. The companies will align sales efforts to attract advertising and partnerships. During the transition, Otter Media CEO Tony Goncalves highlighted the foundation of increased programming quality at Rooster Teeth, pledging changes to the company would be minimal in order to preserve the brand. Machinima would be subsumed into Fullscreen. On December 18, 2018, Rooster Teeth added to their overall content library by partnering with animation channels CypherDen and Flashgitz, premiering their future content on Rooster Teeth First. On January 31, 2019, Yvonne Secretan, COO of Rooster Teeth, announced her retirement. Ezra Cooperstein stepped down as President of Rooster Teeth on April 26, 2019. In June 2019, following accusations of poor working conditions, Hullum made a statement apologizing \\"all who have been affected\\". On September 12, 2019, Hullum announced Rooster Teeth had laid off 13% of its workforce, approximately 50 employees. Two weeks after announcing the layoffs, Jordan Levin was named General Manager with most of Rooster Teeth's founders stepping down into creative roles: Matt Hullum stepped down as CEO and became Chief Content Officer, Burnie Burns stepped down as Chief Creative Officer to Executive Producer and Geoff Ramsey became Executive Creative Director. In November 2019, it was announced that the company's Vice President of Product and Engineering was terminated from his position after domestic abuse and assault charges were filed against him. The following month, Rooster Teeth promoted Doreen Copeland to VP, Head of Production, and Joe Clary and Sean Hinz to Co-Heads of Animation, leading day-to-day operations across all of Rooster Teeth's animated productions; Clary and Hinz will report to Copeland, who will oversee all physical production. In June 2020, Heyman claimed that he was \\"laid off\\" from Rooster Teeth and would no longer perform in Red vs. Blue. Burns resigned in June 2020, maintaining a first-look deal with Rooster Teeth. In August 2020 Rooster Teeth announced it was reviewing its online content library as part of a diversity initiative. On October 7, 2020, Rooster Teeth issued a statement saying it had \\"parted ways\\" with Adam Kovic and Ryan Haywood (of Funhaus and Achievement Hunter, respectively) for breach of the company's code of conduct. Explicit photos of the two were leaked online, and Haywood was accused of grooming fans, some of whom were underage.  Animated production  Rooster Teeth Animation is a division of Rooster Teeth that was founded in 2014, with Gray Haddock as the former head of the department. On December 13, 2019, it was announced that Joe Clary and Sean Hinz were promoted to co-heads of the department to replace Haddock. = Red vs. Blue = season 4, made using the Halo 2 engine In a parody of science-fiction films and gamesLeggat and of military life,Burns, et al., 2003, Audio Commentary, episode 2.

In 2010, Burnie Burns stated he, \\"could not imagine RedVsBlue or Rooster Teeth without the community site.\\" In 2014 Gus Sorola stated, \\"From the beginning we have always maintained and promoted our own community site, since before YouTube even existed\\". Building community is key to having an engaged, active audience who really enjoy your content.\\" Burns expanded on this in September 2014, attributing how they've managed to build a global audience to constantly engaging in a two-way conversation with the company's \\"hyper engaged core\\". In 2016, Burns reiterated their growth again to listening and taking the community's feedback to heart. Burns repeated in 2016 that he considers the secret to the company's successes is their community and their conversation with the community. \\"Our model revolves around being the home for a core community, and growing it year-after-year ... the loyalty of a community to spread the gospel of your brand is absolutely critical\\" Fullscreen CEO George Strompolos, after acquiring Rooster Teeth, cited the \\"insanely powerful community\\" as a reason they felt the company was a perfect match to buy and later attributed Lazer Team's success to the power of the community. In 2015, during the production of Rooster Teeth's first feature, co-founder and Director Matt Hullum stated, \\"We would not have been able to make Lazer Team without the community and really I don't think we would've wanted to.\\" In 2017, Burns re-emphasized that \\"community is the cornerstone of Rooster Teeth\\" and one of their core values they impress upon new employees. = Distinguished community members = Community members have distinguished themselves on and beyond the website. Notable people to come from the community include Gavin Free, Barbara Dunkelman, and Kent Nichols. In October 2008, community member \\"Jeffson\\" became the first person to post that Barack Obama's presidential campaign had taken out billboards within the Xbox 360 version of Burnout Paradise. After being posted to his journal, the story was picked up by major news outlets, including GamePolitics, MTV and Wired. In 2010, Achievement Hunter community members \\"AxialMatt\\" and \\"Hightower\\" garnered attention with their Japan World Cup 3 video. For Red vs. Blue: Revelation, Rooster Teeth used 10 community members to help unlock Halo 3 armor suits for machinima production purposes. In February 2011, Burns tweeted that community member \\"madmanmoe\\" discovered the Rooster Teeth website was not blocked by the Libyan government and was blogging events on the website from Tripoli during the Libyan Civil War. The longest-running external resource site, RoosterTooths, has existed since 2005 and contains transcripts, biographies, and a history of the Red vs. Blue title screen. Community members have been utilized for RT productions at every single RTX. In 2011, some 400 community members were used as zombie extras for a Horde Mode episode of Immersion. In 2012, 1,800 attendees were used as extras for a scene in the RT production, Day 5, which involved shutting down the main road in downtown Austin. In 2013, hundreds of fans were used as extras for a water-bomb attack in an episode of The Slow Mo Guys. In 2014, casting calls and auditions for minor speaking roles in Lazer Team were held for RTX attendees. In 2015, attendees were invited to participate in an interactive, \\"narrative-driven experience\\" called Murder at The RTX which involved hunting clues at prepared \\"crime scenes\\". On June 20, 2016 Rooster Teeth confirmed they would be filming audience members at an RTX panel for use in their latest production, Crunch Time. Many employees have come from the community. In 2014, Burns estimated \\"at least a third\\" of the company of 85 started in the fan community, adding it \\"keeps us grounded\\" and \\"makes a whole lot of sense from a business standpoint ... I don't have to explain to them what this company is trying to do.\\" Ben McSweeney, illustrator of Rooster Teeth's logo, was hired by Burns after being found on the site's community forums in April 2003. Others include community manager Barbara Dunkelman, composers Nico Audy-Rowland and Jeff Williams of Trocadero, cartoonist Luke McKay, Achievement Hunters Caleb Denecour and Ray Narvaez, Jr., Rooster Teeth Animated Adventures creator Jordan Cwierz, and RWBY writer and director Kerry Shawcross. In August 2014, former intern and current content producer Blaine Gibson garnered media attention when he posted photos proposing to Disney Princesses at Walt Disney World. In July 2014 it was announced at RTX that fan Jordan Scott would be making the RWBY video game after posting footage of a demo he had made to his YouTube page. It was also announced during the RTX 2014 Achievement Hunter panel that Community Hunters Matthew \\"AxialMatt\\" Bragg and Jeremy \\"Jerem6401\\" Dooley would be joining AH as its newest employees. = Events = Community- run events have occurred regularly since 2005. These included RvBTO in Toronto (the first event, now retired and replaced with Toronto:Unconventional), RvBCanWest in Vancouver, RT Philly in Philadelphia, RooTeeth in Melbourne, and SideQuest in Austin. In February 2011, Sorola announced the date for the first RTX, the company's first official fan event. Burns credited RTX \\"starting\\" with the early fan events in Canada.

Mahina struck Bathurst Bay, Cape York Peninsula, Queensland, on 4 March 1899, and its winds and enormous storm surge combined to kill more than 300 people. While the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, which is the Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre of the basin, estimates Mahina's peak central pressure to be , the World Meteorological Organization is currently considering an application from Queensland scientists and researchers to have this value upgraded to , based on data from post-storm analysis. This would officially make Mahina the most intense cyclone recorded to have hit the Australian mainland, and the most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Southern Hemisphere, a title currently held by Cyclone Winston. Cyclone Mahina also produced the largest storm surge on record, generating a 13-metre (43-foot)-high surge. Impact Storm path of Cyclone Mahina, 1899 Tropical Cyclone Mahina struck Australia on 4 March 1899, with a likely minimum central pressure of . Mahina ranks among the most intense cyclones ever observed in the Southern Hemisphere and almost certainly as the most intense cyclone ever observed off the Eastern states of Australia in recorded history. Clement Lindley Wragge, Government Meteorologist for Queensland, pioneered the naming of such storms and gave this storm its name, Mahina. Storms of such intensity occur extremely rarely. Scientists identified two other Category-4 or 5 super- cyclones that struck Australia, in the first half of the 19th century, from their effects on the Great Barrier Reef and the Gulf of Carpentaria. This same research shows that on average, such super-cyclones occur in the region only once every two or three centuries.*Michael Allaby, Richard Garratt, Hurricanes, page 98, Infobase Publishing, 2003 . A pearling fleet, based at Thursday Island, Queensland, was anchored in or near the bay before the storm. Within an hour, the storm drove much of the fleet ashore or onto the Great Barrier Reef; other vessels sank at their anchorages. Four schooners and the manned Channel Rock lightship were lost. A further two schooners were wrecked but later re-floated. The fleets lost 54 luggers, and a further 12 were wrecked but re-floated. People later rescued more than 30 survivors of the wrecked vessels from the shore; however, the storm killed more than 400 people, mostly non-European immigrant crew members.Whittingham, H.

However, reviewing the evidence for this surge, some scientists modeled a surge only to in height, based on the official central pressure. They also surveyed the area, seeking wave-cut escarpments and deposits characteristic of storm events, but found none higher than . Of the surge, they suggested an incorrectly cited ground level or an involvement of freshwater (rain) flooding. A later study considers this conclusion likely premature and questions the barometer reading as unreliable and not representative of the actual lowest pressure. This subsequent study also examined new evidence of exceptionally high storm surge and inundation. The cyclone continued southwest over Cape York Peninsula, emerging over the Gulf of Carpentaria, before doubling back and dissipating on 10 March.Bathurst Bay, Qld: Cyclone (incl Storm Surge) Emergency Management Australia Disasters Database. Accessed 29 December 2008. Casualties The exact number of casualties is not known, as many deaths were not recorded. Estimates range between 307 and 410. In September 1899, the Queensland Marine Department published a list of 247 known fatalities. The Queensland Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages has 283 registered deaths attributed to the cyclone, including 250 on pearling ships. One of the pearling fleet owners estimated another 30 people not officially registered as crew were killed and not reported to the Cooktown Registrar. Around 100 Aboriginal Australians were killedTropical Cyclones: Hazard Modelling and Risk Assessment, GeoscienceAustralia Report no. 68013, 2006 but not recorded, as Aboriginal people were not counted as part of the population at the time. They had tried to help shipwrecked men, but the back surge caught them and swept them into the sea. Only eight Aboriginal people were recorded among the casualties, all of whom died on shore. The Queensland Historical Atlas reported the death toll as \\"307 pearl divers and sailors and an unreported number of Aborigines\\". Aftermath People found thousands of fish and some sharks and dolphins several kilometres (miles) inland, and the storm embedded rocks into trees. On Flinders Island (Queensland), people found dolphins on the cliffs; however, this finding does not necessarily indicate a surge of this height; on this exposed site, wave run-up readily can produce these results even within the more modest calculated surge. At Cape Melville, survivors erected a memorial stone to \\"The Pearlers\\" lost to the cyclone, naming 11 Europeans but only citing \\"over 300 coloured men\\" for the other seamen.Outridge Monument The Anglican church on Thursday Island, Queensland, also commemorates this disaster.

One author accepted the report from the Olive and the report from the Crest of the Wave, seemingly unaware of the discrepant reports.

Heliodons are used primarily by architects and students of architecture. By placing a model building on the heliodon‚Äôs flat surface and making adjustments to the light/surface angle, the investigator can see how the building would look in the three-dimensional solar beam at various dates and times of day. Scientific background The Earth is a ball in space perpetually intercepting a cylinder of parallel energy rays from the sun. (Think of a tennis ball being held in the wind.) The angle of any earthly site to the solar beam is determined by *The site‚Äôs latitude, which gives its position on the curve of the Earth between the Equator and one of the Poles. *The time of day at the site, measured by its progress eastward around the Earth‚Äôs axis from sunrise to sunset. *The date, which locates the Earth on its annual orbit of the sun. The change due to date is the most difficult to visualize. The Earth‚Äôs axis is steady but tilted: the plane that includes the Earth‚Äôs equator, which is perpendicular to the axis, is not parallel to the plane that includes the center of the sun and the center of the Earth, called the ecliptic. Think of the Earth as a car on a Ferris wheel. The car‚Äôs axis always points ‚Äúdown‚Äù, which changes its relation to the center of the wheel. A light at the center of the wheel would touch the bottom of the car at the top of the orbit and the top of the car at the bottom of the orbit. As the Earth orbits, the location of the centerline of the solar cylinder changes, sliding from the Tropic of Cancer (in June) to the Tropic of Capricorn (in December) and back again. This changes sun angles all over Earth according to the date. See more at analemma. Utility Heliodons can mimic latitude, time of day, and date. They must also show a clear north-south direction on their surface in order to orient models. Some heliodons are very elaborate, using tracks in a high ceiling to carry a light across a large studio. Others are very simple, using a sundial as a guide to the adjustments and the sun of the day as a light source. In general, the date adjustment causes the most difficulty for the heliodon designer, while the light source presents the most problems in use. The parallel rays of the sun are not easy to duplicate with an artificial light at a useful scale, while the real sun is no respecter of deadlines or class hours. All heliodons can benefit by including a moveable, tiltable device that can be set to match any surface on a model to show angle of incidence. The angle of incidence device indicates the relative intensity of the direct beam on the surface. The device consists of a diagram of concentric rings around a shadow-casting pointer perpendicular to the diagram. Each ring represents a percent of the direct solar beam incident on the surface. The percentage varies from 100%‚Äîthe ray runs straight down the pointer perpendicular to the diagram‚Äîto zero‚Äîthe ray runs parallel to the diagram and misses surface. The cosine of the angle of incidence gives the percentage. A cosine of 0.9, 90%, for example, corresponds to an angle of incidence of 26.84 degrees. The radius of the ring for the angle is equal to its tangent times the height of the shadow casting pointer. A 45 degree angle of incidence would generate a cosine of about .7, 70%, for example. Since the tangent of 45 degrees is 1, the radius of the 70% ring would be equal to the height of the shadow-casting rod.

It has a population of approximately 50,000 people (12,000 in the urban center). It is found in the mountainous centre of western Honduras. History The word gracias means \\"thanks\\" in Spanish. It is said that upon arriving at the site of the city of Gracias, the Spanish explorers, tired after having trekked through the mountainous terrain, said \\"Gracias a Dios hemos llegado a tierra plana,\\" meaning \\"Thank God we have arrived at flat land.\\" The city was made the regional capital of the Audiencia de los Confines in 1544. However, this decision created resentment in the populated areas of Guatemala and El Salvador. In 1549, the capital was moved to Antigua, Guatemala, and Honduras remained a province within the Captaincy General of Guatemala until 1821. Geography Elevation ranges from roughly 800 meters at the town square to 2,870 meters at the peak of Monta√±a Celaque (also known as Cerro Las Minas). Climate is greatly influenced by elevation, with the low-lying portions having a wet-dry (monsoonal) pattern. Monta√±a Celaque is the highest mountain and largest cloud forest in Honduras, and is protected through Celaque Mountain National Park. Transportation Gracias serves as a transportation hub for the immediate region. The town is connected to the northern city of Santa Rosa de Copan by a paved 2 lane highway, and construction of a paved 2 lane highway to La Esperanza has been underway for several years. Economy Agriculture is both subsistence and export based. Agricultural crops vary with elevation and climate, with corn and beans grown at lower altitudes and fruits/vegetables grown at higher altitudes. The development of a tourist economy is seen as a driver of economic development. This tourism is based on the town's historic and natural attractions including colonial churches, Celaque Mountain and hot springs.

Its common names include red ant and red harvester ant. These large (5‚Äì to 7-mm) ants prefer arid chaparral habitats and are native to the Southwestern United States. Nests are made underground (up to 2.5 m deep) in exposed areas. Their diets consist primarily of seeds, and they consequently participate in myrmecochory, an ant-plant interaction through which the ants gain nutrients and the plants benefit through seed dispersal. Red harvester ants are often mistaken for fire ants, but are not closely related to any fire ant species, native or introduced. Colonization Red harvester ant nests are characterized by a lack of plant growth and small pebbles surrounding the entrance to the tunnel, which usually descends at a pronounced angle. Hulls of seeds may be found scattered around the nest. In grassland areas, such as ranches, the lack of plant life makes red harvester ant colonies very easy to spot, and where they are very plentiful, they may make serious inroads into the grazing available to livestock. The mounds are typically flat and broad, high, and in diameter. Even larger denuded areas have been reported, on the order of . Three to eight trails typically lead away from the mound, like \\"arms\\". These trails are used by ants to collect and bring food back to the mound. \\"Scout\\" ants are the first ones out of the mound every morning. They seek food, and mark their path as they return to the mound to alert the worker ants. The worker ants follow the scent trail and collect the food. Other worker ants clean, extend, and generally tend to the mound, the queen, and the brood. All the ants in the colonies are females apart from the winged males produced in the breeding season. =Initial colony formation= The reproductive unit of ant populations is the colony. A single virgin queen first mates with several males at a reproductive aggregation site formed by male harvester ants. She then flies to a new site to produce an offspring colony. Diet The main food source for red harvester ants usually consists of seeds, which they hoard in great numbers. The food is first ground to a bread-like consistency using the ants' large mandibles, and is then stored in a granary, assuring the colony access to food year-round. Seed collection on behalf of the red harvester ants benefits their ecosystem through the process of myrmecochory, in which ants aid in the dispersal of seeds while foraging for food. Both plants and ants benefit from this relationship: the plants increase their dispersal range and density, while the ants benefit from acquiring nutrients and ensuring a more secure food supply in future harvests. This is typically understood as a mutualistic interaction. Dead insects are also collected during foraging. Red harvester ants =Foraging= Much research has been done on the foraging behavior of the red harvester ant. Three types of workers are most involved in the foraging process: nest patrollers, trail patrollers, and foragers. On a given day, nest patrollers emerge first from the nest to assess the safety and profitability of foraging. The colony gets the majority of its water from the metabolism of the fats in seeds. If food is scarce, or if it is a particularly hot day, the energy and water benefits of foraging may be outweighed by its energy and water costs. In this case, the colony may be forced to rely on its extensive food stores. Seeds may be stored in the nest for months or even several years. The colony is able to communicate through momentary antennal contact involving the transfer of cuticular hydrocarbons. Other visual, temporal, and olfactory cues may also be involved. Based on the nest patrollers‚Äô reports, trail patrollers may leave the nest to determine the best possible foraging direction. This decision is based upon various economic factors such as food availability and neighboring nests‚Äô foraging behavior. As both types of patrollers return, foragers assess their rates of return to decide whether to leave the nest to find food. In an experiment involving patroller mimics, a return rate of one patroller every 10 seconds stimulated the highest level of foraging activity. This return rate indicates high availability of food and good foraging conditions, therefore a favorable cost-benefit ratio for the foragers exists. If the patroller return rate is too high, it may be a warning of danger, such as the sighting of a predatory lizard. A lower return rate could indicate lack of available food, or heavy competition Ant foraging is guided by chemical signals that lead the ants up to 50‚Äì60 m from the nest at times.\\"Harvester Ant (Pogonomyrmex barbatus).\\" antARK. antARK, Web. 30 Oct. 2013. . Once an ant has decided to forage, it will almost always continue until it has found food to take back to the nest; 90% of returning foragers are ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù. Therefore, forager return rate is a good indicator of food availability. Logically, overall foraging activity is influenced by the rate of returning foragers. When food is plentiful, foragers quickly find it and immediately return to the nest. Foragers still in the nest interpret this to mean food searches will be profitable: low energy input with a high chance of a seed reward. Foraging activity consequently is increased. Likewise, a decline in food availability, indicated by a decrease in forager return rate, causes the colony to decrease its foraging activity. The ability for a colony to quickly regulate its foraging behavior is quite important since their food source is variable and scattered. This regulatory ability is variable in itself, influenced by food availability, current need to eat, and colony health. Colonies are more likely to adapt to varying forager return rates when the rate of foraging is high, which may be because variances are simply harder to detect during low rates. Overall, the red harvester ant demonstrates a remarkable ability in social cognition, cost-benefit analysis, and behavioral economics. =Collective regulation= Harvester ant populations operate without a centralized control system by means of a decentralized chemical communication system, through the process of chemical signalling. Foraging is regulated using positive and negative feedback loops. Ants returning to the colony stimulates outgoing foraging. When ants return to the colony at a higher rate with seeds, this in turn causes the outgoing rate of foragers to increase. As fewer ants bearing seeds return to the colony, the rate of outgoing foragers decreases. The result is foraging regulation relative to the abundance of available food at any given time. The interactions between returning and outgoing foragers operates on a timescale of seconds. It typically only took three to eight seconds for an outgoing forager to leave the nest as a result of an increase in successful returning foragers. Relative abundance of food available is gauged by the average time spent foraging per seed, rather than the distance traveled to find each seed. Foragers take less time when food is more abundant. Faster foraging signals faster rates of outgoing foragers, maximizing the harvest of food relative to the abundance in the area. Seeds are used as a source of water for ants, and are often kept in the nest for a few months to several years. Interference competition in foraging Interspecies competition exists between harvester ant populations, presenting challenges to successful foraging. One example of this is the competition for access to seed resources between the Novomessor cockerelli and Pogonomyrmex barbatus species of harvester ants. Novomessor cockerelli ants engage in interference competition against Pogonomyrmex barbatus colonies by \\"plugging\\" entrances to the nest with sand and small rocks. This delays activity of P. barbatus for one to three hours, shifting the onset of foraging until later in the day when the temperature is substantially higher. This reduces productivity in two ways; firstly, the ants are delayed and consequently have less time to forage; secondly, high soil temperatures prematurely drive harvest ants back into their nests, shortening the range of possible foraging. Research indicated that the affected P. barbatus populations did not take efforts to compensate for the interference in their activities, such as by inducing higher rates of foraging. As such, nest plugging by rival species impedes the overall productivity of worker ants in the species Pogonomyrmex barbatus. Division of labor =Caste system= Red harvester ant nest entry Red harvester ants are eusocial insects, characterized by a high level of cooperation and an organized division of labor. The worker caste is sterile. As with most ant species, reproduction is performed by a mating caste that consists of winged alates (reproductives) that reside in the nest until weather permits them to fly away and mate. After copulation, the male usually dies, while the now-fertilized queen returns to the ground to search for a suitable nesting site. Once she has chosen a site, she sheds her wings and begins to reproduce, creating a new colony. She produces \\"worker ants\\" for 1‚Äì20 years until her death. Some queens have been known to live up to 30 years in the wild. In P. barbatus, reproductive and nonreproductive tasks are divided into a caste system, as discussed above. Some individuals are specialized for reproductive function, while other ants are responsible for nonreproductive roles such as defense, caring for the brood, and foraging for food. The system of division of labor naturally arises in conjunction with the formation of the group, rather than as a secondary adaptation; otherwise solitary queen harvest ants placed in forced association had division of labor arise in groups that lack an evolutionary history of such social arrangements. =Nonreproductive caste= Within nonreproductive P. barbatus worker ants, five major tasks are performed: foraging, maintenance of the nest, defense, midden work, and convening. Roles are not constant and chemical interactions determine when certain ants engage in certain activities. As such, these tasks are relatively fluid and cannot be understood as separate processes. The transition in behavior on behalf of one group triggers behavioral transitions in other groups of worker ants. =Reproductive caste= The reproductive P. barbatus caste is responsible for the formation of new colonies. A single queen ant establishes every colony. Large numbers of winged male ants and virgin queen ants fly to mating aggregation sites following midsummer monsoon rains. To found a successful colony, P. barbatus queens must mate with males from two separate lineages. One lineage results in ants that become the workers of the colony. These are the ants responsible for the nonreproductive tasks of the colony. The other lineage produces reproductive female ants. After mating with the male ants at the aggregation site, the queen flies away to establish a new colony. Upon arriving at her new nest site, the queen loses her wings and builds a nest in the soil. The entrance into the nest is then sealed off to lay her eggs in safety. With this, the colony is born. Over the course of the following six to eight weeks, the primary brood of nonreproductive worker ants emerges and begins to forage and build the colony. Reproduction =Mating behavior= Mating is perennial and species- specific between subspecies of the red harvester ant. Males distinguish reproductive females of their species from females of other species using pheromones. This occurs as a result of sexually stimulating pheromones secreted from the poison glands of reproductive P. barbatus females. These pheromones are perfectly detected by males of the species upon physical contact, resulting in the stimulation of sexual behavior. Mating occurs at reproductive aggregation sites. Secretions from the mandibular glands of males initially mark these sites. The secretions attract females, as well as additional males, resulting in strong male competition for mates. The system of mating within P. barbatus is comparable to lek behavior performed by many vertebrate species. The male ants congregate and collectively give off a pheromone that attracts reproductive females. The more males present to give off the pheromone, the stronger the attraction for the females. Although this practice strongly favors certain males and leaves many others without mates, the congregation of males attracts more females on the whole as opposed to pheromone release on behalf of a solitary male. Consequently, it is more desirable for the less attractive males to remain in the lek than to attempt to attract females on their own. =Sexual selection= Within reproductive aggregations of P. barbatus ants, strong male competition exists. Males engage in communal mating displays to attract females. Male ants attempt to mate with any female they encounter, but females resist copulation from the males. Consequently, the communal mating displays heavily favor reproduction with larger or more persistent males which are able to overpower the females and successfully copulate. The male ants copulate for as long as possible, likely to restrict access to the female from other males to ensure their sperm survives to reproduce. =Predation= Red harvester ants are a favorite food for desert horned lizards. Harvester ants defend their colonies vigorously against real or perceived attacks, whether by large or small animals. They may bite ferociously and their stings are venomous and painful. The effect spreads through the lymphatic system, sometimes causing dangerous reactions, especially in animals sensitive or allergic to their venom. Over the years, their numbers have been declining, and this has often been attributed to competition for food with the invasive red imported fire ant and the Argentine ant. Their decline has affected many native species, especially those for which the red harvester ant is a chief source of food, such as the Texas horned lizard.

It is currently the highest recognised village in the United Kingdom. Population details taken at the 2011 census can be found under Quarnford. It was an early centre for Wesleyanism. Location and geography Flash is the main village in Quarnford Parish. It lies just off the A53 main road about 4 miles southwest of Buxton. It is on the southern slope of the highest ground on Axe Edge Moor, which rises to a peak of . The parish forms the Staffordshire corner of Three Shire Head, a tripoint marked by a packhorse bridge on a tributary of the River Dane, where Staffordshire, Derbyshire and Cheshire meet. To the south is Morridge, with a trig point at at Merryton Low which provides views across the Cheshire plain and The Roaches. Also in this area is Ramshaw Rocks, a part of the range which includes Hen Cloud and The Roaches. The Winking Man is a rock outcrop on Ramshaw Rocks that resembles a human face in profile; its eyehole appears to 'wink' to passing travellers on the A53. The River Dane rises within the parish. East of Flash, and just over the A53, are the heads of the River Dove and River Manifold. Further south is the head of the River Churnet and to the north is the head of the River Goyt. Other interesting features include caves on the west side of Axe Edge, one of which is known as \\"The Devil's Hole\\" from some strange sounds heard there when the wind blows in the right direction. =Highest village in Britain= At above sea level, Flash claims to be the highest village in Great Britain. In 2007 the claim was upheld by the BBC, which settled a dispute with its rival claimant, Wanlockhead in Dumfries and Galloway. The Ordnance Survey measured the highest house in each village and Flash was higher, although the results were disputed by residents of the Scottish village. More recently the claim has been disputed by the residents of Nenthead in Cumbria. There is, however, no doubt that the former Methodist Chapel is the highest in Britain; the certainty is helped by the scarcity of Methodist chapels in the Southern Uplands.This was the subject of debate in The Methodist Recorder in the late 20th century. A letter from Rev. R O Higginson, whose work as a Methodist minister had included Flash, settled the matter. The village During the first half of the 19th century the population of the parish was around 700; it had reduced to half that by the end of the 1800s. In 1851 there were 40 agricultural labourers, about the same number of silk workers, and almost as many colliers. There were also stonemasons, dressmakers, blacksmiths and cordwainers, and a shoemaker, errand boy, wheelwright, game-keeper, grocer, peddlar and tailor, as well as a number of house servants, 275 young people and 50 scholars. At one time 29 families were receiving weekly relief and 23 families occasional relief, nearly a quarter of the population. The first record of coalmining in the parish comes from 1401 when Thomas Smith took a year's lease on the 'vein coal' of Black Brook, near Upper Hulme. There were a large number of coal pits in the area, including Orchard Common, Blackclough, Hope, Goldsitch and Knotbury. They were worked throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, and some into the early 20th century, for both commercial and domestic use. Flash is an isolated community with a small population; it previously had a school attended by as few as four pupils (the school is now closed). Flash previously had a reputation for being a centre for illegal activities such as cock fighting and counterfeiting ('Flash money').Flash village history booklet available in Parish Church According to some sources, the counterfeit money manufactured at Flash used to be exchanged at the nearby Three Shires Head (where Staffordshire, Cheshire and Derbyshire meet, and where prizefighting was also said to have taken place). The village currently has a village shop, Flash bar stores with a web cam, and a brewery, Flash Brewery, which has bottled beer suitable for vegans. St Paul's is the parish church of Quarnford, located in the middle of Flash village. The church was rebuilt in 1901 to the design by Buxton architect William Radford Bryden and it is a Grade II listed building. Methodist history Wesleyan Methodism was so well-established in Flash during the 18th century that a chapel was built as early as 1784. At this time, there were 61 Methodist \\"members of Society\\".J B Dyson, \\"Wesleyan Methodism in the Leek Circuit\\", 1853 This account suggests that Flash became a centre from which Methodism and spread into other neighbouring villages, such as Hollinsclough.Dyson, op cit records the conversion of John Lomas who later built Holinsclough Chapel See also *Listed buildings in Quarnford Notes and references External links * Quarnford Parish page on ONS website Villages in Staffordshire Towns and villages of the Peak District Staffordshire Moorlands ","title":"Flash, Staffordshire"},{"id":"1382319","text":"Grant Park refers to the oldest city park in Atlanta, Georgia, United States, as well as the Victorian neighborhood surrounding it. Park Grant Park is a 131-acre green space and recreational area and is the fourth-largest park in the city, behind Chastain Park, Freedom Park and Piedmont Park. Zoo Atlanta, established in 1889 and originally known as the Grant Park Zoo, is located in the park and attracts more than 1 million visitors annually. =History= Grant Park Grant Park was established in 1883 when Lemuel P. Grant, a successful engineer and businessman, gave the city of Atlanta in the newly developed \\"suburb\\" where he lived. In 1890, the city acquired another for the park and appointed its first park commissioner, Sidney Root. In 1903, the Olmsted Brothers (sons of Frederick Law Olmsted) were hired to create a plan for the park. The original park included a lake, named Lake Abana, to handle storm-water runoff. A failed circus gave birth to the eventual Zoo Atlanta when local lumber merchant George Gress purchased animals from the circus and donated them to the city in 1889. The city decided Grant Park was the best location for the zoo and carved space out for the attraction. Later zoo expansions and parking requirements caused the removal of a portion of the lake. In 1892, the circular painting of the Battle of Atlanta was exhibited in the park. The cyclorama would eventually gain its own dedicated building in the park in 1921. Near the zoo is the Erskine Memorial Fountain, Atlanta's first public fountain, which was built in 1896 and moved to Grant Park in 1912. In 1948, another park landmark, the Thomas W. Talbot Monument, was dedicated by members of the International Association of Machinists, honoring their founder, Thomas W. Talbot. In 1996, after years of neglect and abuse, the City of Atlanta Parks Bureau commissioned a new master plan for the park. The consultants working on the plan met with a citizen advisory group that would eventually become the Grant Park Conservancy. The Conservancy works to raise funds to enhance and protect the park for the enjoyment of all its visitors. Neighborhood The Grant Park commercial district, near Oakland Cemetery Front of the Lemuel P. Grant Mansion, second-oldest house in Atlanta Grant Park, the intown neighborhood surrounding the park, is one of Atlanta's oldest and most important historic districts, listed on the NRHP.\\"Grant Park Historic District\\", National Park Service - National Register of Historic Places Travel Itinerary - Atlanta It is bordered by the Cabbagetown neighborhood on the north, Ormewood Park on the east, Boulevard Heights on the southeast, Chosewood Park on the south, and Summerhill and Peoplestown on the west. It includes the park, 48 acres or 35 hectares of Oakland Cemetery (established 1850), where Margaret Mitchell, Bobby Jones, 25 former mayors of Atlanta, six former governors of Georgia, and many Civil War dead are buried. It also includes the Atlanta Stockade; Fort Walker; and the 1858 mansion of Lemuel P. Grant, for whom the park and neighborhood were named. The mansion is the second-oldest house still standing on its original location in Atlanta. The Grant Park Neighborhood Association represents local residents. Together with Inman Park, Grant Park contains the largest remaining area of Victorian architecture in Atlanta. Most buildings were built between the neighborhood's founding in 1882 and the first decades of the 20th century. Large two-story mansions face the park, more modest two-story, modified Queen Anne houses were built on surrounding streets, and one-story Victorian era cottages and Craftsman bungalows were built to the east of the park. The neighborhood is home to St. Paul United Methodist Church, which for a time in the early 1900s had the largest Methodist congregation in the Southeast, and which continues to be a thriving congregation. St. Paul is well known for its beautiful stained glass windows and an organ that was acquired in 1887. Each December, St. Paul, the Grant Park Cooperative Preschool (which is located on the first floor of St. Paul), and the Grant Park Parent Network host the Grant Park Candlelight Tour of Homes and Artist Market. There is also a Tour of Homes in the autumn sponsored by the Grant Park Neighborhood Association.

The Mosquitia region is part of the Gracias a Dios Department of northeastern Honduras, the second largest department of the country after Olancho, with 16,630 km2. Most of the territory is a very hot and humid plain, crossed by numerous streams and rivers, including the Pl√°tano, Patuca, Waruna, and Coco rivers. The largest coastal lagoon in Honduras, Caratasca Lagoon, is in the region. It is shallow, with saline water, and is separated from the sea by a thin stretch of sand. The climate of La Mosquitia promotes the growth of a dense tropical forest, which is now set aside for preservation.

The railway is operated by the Southern Railway and is the only rack railway in India. The railway relies on its fleet of steam locomotives. NMR switched to diesel locomotives on the section between Coonoor and Udhagamandalam. Local people and visitors led a campaign to return to steam locomotives in this section. In July 2005, UNESCO added the Nilgiri Mountain Railway as an extension to the World Heritage Site of Darjeeling Himalayan Railway. The site then became known as Mountain Railways of India.NMR added as a World Heritage Site History In 1854, plans were made to build a mountain railway from Mettupalayam to the Nilgiri Hills. However, it took the decision-makers 45 years to cut through the bureaucratic red tape and complete the construction. The line was completed and opened for traffic in June 1899. It was operated first by the Madras Railway under an agreement with the government. The Madras Railway Company continued to manage the railway line on behalf of the government for a long time until the South Indian Railway company purchased it. In 1907, the railway received four Double Fairlie locomotives to work the line. These were part of a batch built by the Avonside Engine Company in 1879 and 1880 for service in Afghanistan, but had been in store since 1887. The Fairlies continued in use until at least 1914. Initially, Coonoor was the final station on the line. In September 1908, the line was extended to Fernhill. By 15 October 1908, it was extended to Udagmandalam. These extensions from Coonoor on the same gauge over a distance of were done at a cost of Rs. 24,40,000/-.

The X Class locomotives are six to eight decades old. These locomotives give NMR a distinct charm, taking scores of passengers to Coonoor and Udhagamandalam, crossing , 108 curves, 16 tunnels and 250 bridges. The steam locomotives can be used on any part of the line, while the diesel locomotives can operate only on the section between Coonoor and Udagamandalam. Each diesel engine weighs a little over 50 tonnes and cost Rs. 10 crore. They have pilot and primary burners. Separate tanks hold about of diesel and of furnace oil. The hauling capacity of this new engine is . It can run at a speed of on plains and at an hour climbing a gradient. The arrival of the new engines eliminated the disruptions in service that occurred frequently. The steam locomotives are marshalled at the downhill (Mettupalayam) end of the train. The average gradient in this rack section is 1 in 24.5 (4.08%), with a maximum of 1 in 12 (8.33%). Between Coonoor and Udagamandalam, the train is operated by a YDM4 diesel locomotive using conventional rail adhesion principles. On this section, the locomotive is always at the Coonoor end of the train as although the line is not steep enough to need a rack rail, the ruling gradient out of Coonoor is steep at 1 in 25 (4%). Southern Railway carries out the majority of the locomotive repairs at the Coonoor shed but has rebuilt many of the steam locomotives at the Golden Rock Workshops. Many carriage repairs take place at Mettupalayam. Like the locomotives, major work on the carriages takes place at one of the larger railway workshops. Route The uphill journey takes around 290 minutes (4.8 hours), and the downhill journey takes 215 minutes (3.6 hours). It has the steepest track in Asia with a maximum gradient of 8.33%. As of 2007, a daily train crosses the rack section, which starts from Mettupalayam at 07:10 and reaches Udhagamandalam at noon. The return train starts from Udhagamandalam at 14:00, and reaches at 17:35. The train is scheduled to connect to the Nilgiri Express, which travels from Mettupalayam to Chennai via Coimbatore. A summer special service runs in April and May, starting from Mettupalayam at 09:30 (AM) and from Udhagamandalam at 12:15 (PM). Between Coonoor and Udagamandalam, four daily trains run each way. Even though the NMR supplies networked computerized ticketing systems for onward journeys, it still issues Edmondson style manual tickets for the Udhagamandalam-Mettupalayam journey to preserve its 'World Heritage Site' status. Ticket booking is similar to conventional trains and can be done via the Indian Railway website. It is advisable to book tickets well in advance, especially during peak season. =Stations= *Mettupalayam has the line near to . Passengers cross the platform to board the NMR. A small locomotive shed is there and the carriage workshops for the line. Leaving Mettupalayam, the line is adhesion-worked and actually drops for a short distance before crossing the Bhavani River, after which it starts to climb gently. *Kallar is closed as a passenger station, although it is where the rack rail begins. As the train leaves the station, the gradient is 1 in 12 (8.33%). *Adderly is used only as a water stop. *Hillgrove is a block post and water stop with passenger refreshments. *Runneymede is used only as a water stop. *Kateri Road: trains no longer not stop there. *Coonoor is the main intermediate station, sited near the locomotive workshops as well as the top end of the rack rail. Trains must reverse a short distance before continuing their climb to Udhagamandalam. It is normal for the locomotive to be changed there with diesel traction, normally used for all trains to Udhagamandalam. *Wellington *Aravankadu *Ketti *Lovedale: From a short distance before Lovedale, the line descends into Udhagamandalam. *Udhagamandalam has preserved much of its equipment from the Raj. In addition to the original 1908 building, it operates a water dispenser for steam locomotives, and a weighing scale made in 1907 by Hendry Boomley & Son of Birmingham.

Coonoor station and its heritage locomotive appear in many Indian films. Wellington station finds a place in most of the films casting the Indian army or army training storyline, mainly due to the MRC Indian Army Regiment, Defence Services Staff College, the Cantonment and the Cordite Factory. Ketti station was used as the location in a Malayalam film Summer in Bethlehem. Lovedale station is featured in films including the Tamil hit, Moonram Pirai. The famous Hindi song \\"Chaiyya Chaiyya\\" from Dil Se.. was shot on the rooftop of NMR. Udhagamandalam station has featured in Tamil and other South Indian films. It is prominently featured in some Bollywood films. One of the X Class locomotives on the Nilgiri Mountain Railway was the model for Ashima in the film Thomas & Friends: The Great Race. =Television= In the UK, the BBC made three 2010 documentaries dealing with Indian Hill Railways, featuring NMR in the second programme. (The first film covers the Darjeeling-Himalayan Railway and the third film, the Kalka-Shimla Railway.) The films were directed by Tarun Bhartiya, Hugo Smith, and Nick Mattingly, and produced by Gerry Troyna. The series won the UK Royal Television Society Award in June 2010.

V) was an act of the United Kingdom Parliament designed to stimulate the declining British film industry. It received Royal Assent on 20 December 1927, and it came into force on 1 April 1928.Hansard Description It introduced a requirement for British cinemas to show a quota of British films, for a duration of 10 years. The Act's supporters believed that it would promote the emergence of a vertically integrated film industry, with production, distribution and exhibition infrastructure being controlled by the same companies. The vertically integrated American film industry had rapid growth in the years immediately following the end of World War I. The idea, then, was to try to counter Hollywood's perceived economic and cultural dominance by promoting similar business practices among British studios, distributors, and cinema chains. By creating an artificial market for British films, the increased economic activity in the production sector was hoped to lead to the eventual growth of a self-sustaining industry. The quota was initially set at 7.5% for exhibitors but was raised to 20% in 1935. The films included ones shot in British dominions, such as Canada and Australia. A British film was defined in the following ways: * The film must be made by a British or British-controlled company. * Studio scenes must be photographed within a film studio in the British Empire. * The author of the scenario or the original work on which the screenplay was based must be a British subject. * At least 75% of the salaries must be paid to British subjects,Jill Nelmes, An Introduction to Film Studies (Routledge, 2003), p. 325 excluding the costs of two persons, at least one of whom must be an actor. (That caveat refers to the fact that a British film could engage a highly paid international star, producer, or director but still be regarded as a British film.)Summary of film-related legislation on the UK parliament's website Aftermath The act is generally not considered a success. On the one hand, it occasioned the creation of speculative investment, in lavishly-budgeted features, that could not have hoped to recoup their production costs on the domestic market (such as the output of Alexander Korda's London Films, a boom-and-bust, which was satirised in Jeffrey Dell's 1939 novel Nobody Ordered Wolves); at the other end of the spectrum, it was criticised for the emergence of the opportunistic \\"quota quickie\\", which purposed a quick financial return occasioned by modest production investment. =Quota quickie= The quota quickies were mostly low-cost, low-quality, quickly-accomplished films commissioned by American distributors active in the UK or by British cinema owners purely to satisfy the quota requirements. In recent years, an alternative view has arisen among film historians such as Lawrence Napper, who have argued that the quota quickie has been too casually dismissed and is of particular cultural and historical value because it recorded performances unique to British popular culture (such as music hall and variety acts), which would not have been filmed under normal economic circumstances. The act was modified by the Cinematograph Films Act 1938, removing films shot by nations in the British Empire from the quota and further acts, and it was eventually repealed by the Films Act 1960.

Nocard studied veterinary medicine from 1868 to 1871 and (after a brief service in the Army) from 1871 to 1873 in the √âcole V√©t√©rinaire de Maisons-Alfort. From 1873 to 1878 he was hired as Head of Clinical Service at the same school, working with Dumesnil. In 1876 he is charged with the creation of a new journal, the Archives V√©t√©rinaires. In this journal, Nocard will publish a great number of scientific papers, on medicine, surgery, hygiene and jurisprudence. In 1878 he is approved in a public contest as Professor of Clinical and Surgical Veterinary of the √âcole Veterinaire. Among his many pupils who became famous was Camille Gu√©rin, co-discoverer of the Bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG). In 1880 Nocard entered the laboratory of Louis Pasteur in Paris as an assistant. There, he helped Pasteur and Emile Roux in their classic experiments of vaccination of animals against anthrax at Pouilly-le-Fort. In 1883, he traveled to Egypt with Roux, Straus, and Thuiller, in order to study an outbreak of cholera there, but they were unable to isolate the germ responsible for the disease. He returned on the same year to Alfort, and established a well-equipped research laboratory, in close liaison with Pasteur's. In the next three years, Nocard demonstrated his great skills in laboratory work in the new science of bacteriology by developing a number of new techniques, such as methods of harvesting blood serum, new culture media for the bacillus of tuberculosis, the introduction of anesthesia of large animals with intravenous chloral hydrate, as well as for controlling tetanic convulsions. His scientific and academic victories were rewarded, in 1887, with the title of director of the School, and chair of infectious diseases, and, in 1888, with an invitation to become a member to the first editorial board of the Annals of the Pasteur Institute. He became a full member of the Pasteur Institute in 1895. From 1892 to 1896, he strived to convince the medical and general public, in a series of communications, conferences, booklets, and demonstrations, that the use of the tuberculin of Robert Koch could provide the foundations for the prevention of bovine tuberculosis. He published in the classic La Tuberculose Bovine : ses Dangers, ses Rapports avec la Tuberculose Humaine (The Bovine Tuberculosis: Its Dangers and its Relationship with Human Tuberculosis). Nocard‚Äôs main contribution to medicine has been the discovery of the genre of bacteria which was named, in his honor, Nocardia. It causes nocardiosis, a disease which manifests itself mainly in animals of economic importance, such as bovine farcy, for which he discovered the first Nocardia, named by him initially as Streptothrix farcinica. The Nocardia may also cause disease in humans, particularly in immunocompromised patients, such as those with AIDS. In the field of veterinary pathology he discovered the pathogen of endozootic mastitis, Streptococcus agalactiae. Nocard also discovered the virus which causes bovine peripneumonia and studied psittacosis. He died on 2 August 1903 in Saint- Maurice (Marne) External links Edmond Nocard.

Wittenbergplatz is one of the oldest U-Bahn stations in Berlin, opened on 11 March 1902 with the first Stammstrecke (present-day U1) line running under the eponymous square and adjacent Tauentzienstra√üe, today one of the major shopping streets in Berlin. Initially a common underground station with two tracks on two side platforms, it was completely refurbished as an interchange from 1910 onwards. The new station serving three U-Bahn lines opened on 1 December 1912 with two island platforms and one side platform, serving five tracks at one below ground level and under a single roof. The remarkable entrance hall in the centre of Wittenbergplatz square, designed in an Art Nouveau style by Alfred Grenander, was finished in 1913; spanning over all three platforms, it reflecteded the prestigious building of the large KaDeWe department store across the street. The station building was badly damaged during the bombing of Berlin in World War II and reconstructed afterwards. Wittenbergplatz quickly became one of the most frequented stations of the West Berlin urban traffic network, though after the building of the Berlin Wall the present-day U2 line to Nollendorfplatz was closed in 1972 and not re-opened until 1993.

That is, for each pair of elements of V, we have : \\\\langle u,v \\\\rangle = \\\\langle Tu,Tv \\\\rangle \\\\, . Since the lengths of vectors and the angles between them are defined through the inner product, orthogonal transformations preserve lengths of vectors and angles between them. In particular, orthogonal transformations map orthonormal bases to orthonormal bases. Orthogonal transformations in two- or three-dimensional Euclidean space are stiff rotations, reflections, or combinations of a rotation and a reflection (also known as improper rotations). Reflections are transformations that reverse the direction front to back, orthogonal to the mirror plane, like (real-world) mirrors do. The matrices corresponding to proper rotations (without reflection) have a determinant of +1. Transformations with reflection are represented by matrices with a determinant of ‚àí1. This allows the concept of rotation and reflection to be generalized to higher dimensions. In finite- dimensional spaces, the matrix representation (with respect to an orthonormal basis) of an orthogonal transformation is an orthogonal matrix. Its rows are mutually orthogonal vectors with unit norm, so that the rows constitute an orthonormal basis of V. The columns of the matrix form another orthonormal basis of V. The inverse of an orthogonal transformation is another orthogonal transformation. Its matrix representation is the transpose of the matrix representation of the original transformation. Examples Consider the inner-product space (\\\\mathbb{R}^2,\\\\langle\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot\\\\rangle) with the standard euclidean inner product and standard basis.

A number of Earth-observing radar satellites, such as RADARSAT, have employed synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to obtain terrain and land-cover information about the Earth.  Military  In the United States, Discoverer II was a proposed military space-based radar program initiated in February 1998 as a joint Air Force, DARPA, and NRO program. The concept was to provide high-range-resolution ground moving target indication (GMTI), as well as SAR imaging and high-resolution digital mapping. This program was cancelled by Congress in 2007. SBR is a less-ambitious version of Discoverer II. Space- based radar (SBR) is a proposed constellation of active radar satellites for the United States Department of Defense. The SBR system would allow detection and tracking of aircraft, ocean-going vessels (similar to the Soviet US-A program), and potentially land vehicles from space. This information would then be relayed to regional and national command centers, as well as E-10 MC2A airborne command posts. = Active military radar satellites = * American Lacrosse * Chinese Huanjing * German SAR-Lupe * Russian Kondor * Japanese Information Gathering Satellite *Indian RISAT  Earth-observing radars  Use of radar sensor for Earth observation purposes was started by NASA/JPL's Seasat satellite, which carried three different radar sensors: * a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for high-resolution imaging * a radar altimeter, to measure the ocean topography * a wind scatterometer to measure wind speed and direction After Seasat, SARs, altimeters and scatterometers have been flown on several other space missions. While the SAR, in principle, is similar to its airborne counterparts (with the advantage of the increased coverage and worldwide access offered by the satellite platform), the other two are specific to satellite operations. A satellite radar-altimeter is a nadir- looking radar with very high range resolution, which measures the ocean surface topography with an accuracy in the order of few centimeters. Additionally, analysis of the echo amplitude and shape can extract information about the wind speed and wave height, respectively. Some radar-altimeters (like CryoSat/SIRAL) employ synthetic aperture and/or interferometric techniques: their reduced footprint allows mapping of rougher surfaces like polar ices. A wind scatterometer observes the same portion of the ocean surface from different (at least 3) angles of view as the satellite passes by, measuring the echo amplitude and the corresponding surface reflectivity. Reflectivity being affected by the ocean surface \\"roughness\\", which in turn is affected by the wind and also dependent on its direction, this instrument can determine the wind speed and direction. These three types of radar are currently used on several satellites. Scatterometers are of high value for operational meteorology, allowing reconstruction of wind fields on a global scale. Data from radar altimeters are used for the accurate determination of the geoid, monitoring of tides, ocean currents and other large-scale ocean phenomena such as El Ni√±o. SARs applications are many: they range from geology to crop monitoring, from measurement of sea ice to disaster monitoring to vessel traffic surveillance, not to forget the military applications (many civilian SAR satellites are, in fact, dual-use systems). SAR imaging offer the great advantage, over its optical counterparts, of not being affected by meteorological conditions such as clouds, fog, etc., making it the sensor of choice when continuity of data must be ensured. Additionally, SAR interferometry (both dual-pass or single-pass, as used in the SRTM mission) allows accurate 3-D Reconstruction. Other types of radars have been flown for Earth observation missions: precipitation radars such as the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission, or cloud radars like the one used on Cloudsat. Like other Earth observation satellites, radar satellites often use Sun-synchronous orbits so that diurnal variations of vegetation are ignored, allowing long- term variations to be more accurately measured.

Imaging radars: Synthetic aperture radars are the only instruments capable of penetrating heavy cloud cover around planets such as Venus, which was the first target for such missions. Two Soviet spacecraft (Venera 15 and Venera 16) imaged the planet in 1983 and 1984 using SAR and Radar altimeters. The Magellan probe also imaged Venus in 1990 and 1994. The only other target of an imaging radar mission has been Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, in order to penetrate its opaque atmosphere. The radar of the Cassini probe, which orbited Saturn between 2004 and 2017, provided images of Titan's surface during each fly-by of the moon. The Cassini radar was a multimode system and could operate as Synthetic Aperture Radar, radar altimeter, scatterometer and radiometer. Sounding radars: these are low-frequency (normally, HF - 3 to 30 MHz - or lower) ground-penetrating Radars, used to acquire data about the planet sub- surface structure. Their low operating frequency allow them to penetrate hundreds of meters, or even kilometers, below the surface. Synthetic aperture techniques are normally exploited to reduce the ground footprint (due to the low operating frequency and the small allowable antenna dimensions, the beam is very wide) and, thus, the unwanted echo from other surface objects. The first radar sounder flown was ALSE (Apollo Lunar Sounder Experiment) on board Apollo 17 in 1972. Other sounder instruments flown (in this case around Mars), are MARSIS (Mars Advanced Radar for SubSurface and Ionosphere Sounding) on board the European Space Agency's Mars Express probe, and SHARAD (mars SHAllow RADar sounder) on JPL's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). Both are currently operational. A radar sounder is also used on the Japanese Moon probe SELENE, launched September 14, 2007. A similar instrument (primarily devoted to ionospheric plasma probing) was embarked on the Japanese Martian mission Nozomi (launched in 1998 but lost).

Fairbairn and Eric A. Sykes prior to World War II. It is a hand- to-hand combat system based on practical experience mixed with Jujutsu and boxing that was developed to train the Shanghai Municipal Police, and was later taught in expanded form to Office of Strategic Services and Special Operations Executive members during World War II. Development Based on his training and knowledge in boxing, wrestling, Savate, Jujutsu, Judo and street fighting he was involved in during his police work, Fairbairn began to develop his own system of hand to hand combat, initially referring to it as \\"Defendu\\". It was designed to be simple to learn and to provide effective results. Fairbairn published his book, Defendu, in 1926 (re-printed as Scientific Self Defence in 1931), illustrating this method and it is here that the term \\"Defendu\\" first appeared. This confused early readers of the book, who assumed that the techniques within had been based mainly in the Eastern martial arts that Fairbairn had learned. Thus, in an attempt to highlight the originality of Fairbairn's material, the term did not appear in the 1931 edition of the book. Fairbairn was called upon by the British to help train Allied troops in World War II. Fairbairn and others expanded on this system to create the Close Quarters Combat system that was then taught to the troops. This system was built on Defendu, but modified for military applications, rather than police and riot control. The original Defendu was oriented towards self-defense and restraint, while the Close Quarters Combat system concentrated on rapid disabling of an opponent, with potentially lethal force. The militarized version of Defendu is described in the military manual All in fighting 1942, used as a supplement during WW2 CQB-training. This book was later published in a civilian edition, missing the chapters on bayonet-fighting and rifle sighting, under the name Get Tough! How To Win In Hand-To-Hand Fighting. As Taught To The British Commandos And The U.S. Armed Forces. Fairbairn's CQC- system is also described in Rex Applegate's book Kill or Get Killed. Fairbairn published several more books on the subject of self-defense, all of which refer to Defendu only in relation to the earlier book. World War II The start of the Second World War saw the Allied forces needing every advantage to give their soldiers and special forces a winning edge. They found one such edge in Fairbairn's system. Immediately, Fairbairn was commissioned in the British Commandos and ordered to teach a lethal version of his system at the Commando school in Scotland. It was at this top secret Scottish location that Colonel Rex Applegate of the U.S. Army studied under Fairbairn. Through Col. Applegate and other instructors such as Col. Anthony Biddle, these highly effective skills were taught to U.S. troops including US Marines and Rangers, as well as OSS operatives and later to the FBI and CIA as the foundation of their basic training. Once the British Commando School in Scotland was able to produce its own Fairbairn/Sykes qualified instructors, both men were transferred. Fairbairn to North America, and Sykes to SOE, where he trained special agents for behind the lines duties . Fairbairn's 'special assignment' in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada, was to teach his system to Allied special forces at the most highly classified training operation of WWII, Camp X. Agents were trained in depth to dispose of their enemy quickly and quietly with brutal effectiveness. Following his instruction at Camp X, Fairbairn was rejoined by Col. Applegate to form the United States Camp B, now known as Camp David. This introduction of 'The Fairbairn Fighting System' at Camp X in conjunction with input from many highly skilled instructors with various backgrounds and fighting skills was the beginning of the evolution of Defendu. As close quarters battle or unarmed combat training progressed throughout this period, it was added to and refined utilising western fighting principles. Basic principles Defendu encourages its practitioner to end a confrontation as quickly as possible using \\"ungentlemanly\\" means by rapidly attacking vital spot area (such as the groin, throat, side of the neck, shin, eyes, ears, etc.) by using only several pragmatic and powerful strikes. These strikes are taught as a method and not as disconnected isolated strikes found in traditional martial arts. Done properly, these strikes will \\"chain\\" at each other just like boxing. Defendu was also designed to be able to be mastered in mere days due to the extremely compressed curriculum. Students are also taught to always take initiative, employ artifice, and remain at offense (as no block or parry were found in the system).

In close quarters combat where life- threatening situations often arise suddenly allowing little time for precise aiming, it is difficult to apply proper marksmanship techniques without risking oneself to be hit and killed, which is why point shooting advocates a less sighting-oriented style of shooting prioritizing on achieving a tactical advantage through fire superiority and suppression. Point shooting is also a technique used by trained archers and marksmen to improve general accuracy when using a bow, crossbow, firearm or other ranged weapon. By developing a muscle memory for a given weapon such as a handgun, the shooter can become so accustomed to the weapon's weight and where it is aimed that they can remain relatively accurate without the need to focus on the sights to aim. By continuously practicing with a weapon, a shooter can develop a subconscious hand-eye coordination utilizing proprioceptive reflex to aid in the proper and accurate use of a ranged weapon to the point that they can fire said weapon by \\"instinct\\". Overview One point shooting method, referred to as aimed point shooting, has been used and discussed since the early 19th century. The method employs the use of the index finger along the side of the gun to aim the gun, and the middle finger is used to pull the trigger. Mention of the use of the middle finger can be found in books from the early 1800s up through the 20th century: 1804, 1810, 1816, 1829 1835, 1885, 1898, 1900, 1908, 1912, and in many other military manuals on the M1911. The US Army's first instructional manual on the use of the Model 1911 pistol specifically mentions it, but in a cautionary way due to the design of the slide stop. The slide stop pin protrudes out from the right side of the pistol, and if depressed when the gun is fired, the M1911 can jam. > The trigger should be pulled with the forefinger. If the trigger is pulled > with the second finger, the forefinger extending along the side of the > receiver is apt to press against the projecting pin of the slide stop and > cause a jam when the slide recoils. Similar cautionary language is repeated in many other military manuals published from 1912 and up until the 1940s: 1915, 1917, 1918, 1920, 1921, 1922,On page 13 of Training regulations: TR. - United States.

Several US patents have drawings showing the method used with firearms: US Patent # 694969 issued Mar. 11, 1902, US Patent # 896099 issued Aug. 18, 1908,This is wording from the 1908 US Patent 896099 issued to M. H. Gardner: \\"This invention relates to a device adapted for attachment to fire-arms of various kinds, more especially to shot - guns or hunting rifles, and has for its object to facilitate quick and accurate pointing of the weapon without being obliged to adjust the gun-stock to the shoulder for aiming at birds just rising from the bush or in flight, or at other game. The invention is based largely upon the fact that the conscious or sub-conscious faculties intuitively enable men to point the index finger directly and accurately at any visible object without bringing the outstretched finger into alignment with or between the eye and the object.\\" US Patent # 2270707 issued Jan. 20, 1942, US Patent # 5166459 issued Nov. 1992. Early 20th century shooting experts such as William E. Fairbairn and Rex Applegate advocated point shooting, while many experts later in the century advocated the use of sights. Later sight-reliant methods include Jeff Cooper's modern technique method which became popular after World War II. The modern technique is also known as \\"sight-reliant shooting\\" or \\"sight shooting\\". The issue of using sight-reliant shooting, which relies on the use of the sights for aiming in close quarters combat situations, versus point shooting, which does not rely on the sights for aiming in close quarters combat situations, has been debated since as early as 1835. Basis for the use of aimed point shooting Video showing aimed point shooting being used to shoot at and hit a string of aerials (pop cans tossed into the air at a distance of Aimed point shooting employs humans' innate ability to point accurately at targets in such a way that the shooter can use that ability to hit targets with a firearm. The following is from Chap. 2, Sect. II, US Army Field Manual 23-25, Combat Training With Pistols & Revolvers: > When a soldier points, he instinctively points at the feature on the object > on which his eyes are focused. An impulse from the brain causes the arm and > hand to stop when the finger reaches the proper position. When the eyes are > shifted to a new object or feature, the finger, hand, and arm also shift to > this point. It is this inherent trait that can be used by the soldier to > rapidly and accurately engage targets. Walter J. Dorfner SSgt VSP, the Vice Chair of the Use of Force Committee of the Vermont Criminal Justice Training Council at the Vermont Police Academy in Pittsford, VT, wrote a paper that details his experimentation with using that method of aiming and shooting. He also was the lead firearms instructor for the VSP. The one thing that point shooting methods have in common is that they do not rely on the sights, and they strive to increase the shooter's ability to hit targets at short range under the less-than-ideal conditions expected in close quarters, life-threatening situations, self-defense, and combat situations. In military doctrine Point shooting is often included in military tactical training, alongside other topics such as combatives and urban warfare. A variety of point shooting methods have entered military doctrine at various times and places. =Fairbairn, Sykes, and Applegate= Front view of handgun point shooting position Soon after the creation of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) in 1942, then Second Lieutenant Rex Applegate was given the task of adapting the training being given to British Commando forces for use by OSS agents. Applegate's methodology was published in his book, Kill or Get Killed which was first printed in 1943, and based on his training program for the OSS developed with William E. Fairbairn and Eric A. Sykes. This method is often referred to as the Fairbairn, Sykes, and Applegate method, or FSA (though sometimes the order is altered to FAS). By 1976, it was into its fifth edition, and was re-published in 1991 as Fleet Marine Force Reference Publication FM12-80, Kill or Get Killed. This book covers a wide range of topics, from armed and unarmed combat to prisoner control and riot control techniques. Chapter 5, \\"Combat Use of the Hand Gun\\", covers the basic use of a handgun in a combat situation, while chapter 6, \\"Combat Firing with Shoulder Weapons\\", covers techniques for submachine guns, rifles and shotguns. While aimed fire techniques are covered in both chapters, along with topics such as use of cover and different firing positions, the point shooting techniques generally attract the most attention. Much of Applegate's instruction on point shooting involves developing a firm, consistent shooting position that allows the student to consistently hit where he is looking. Side view of shoulder weapon point shooting position While Applegate did cover firing handguns from the hip (from a position he called the \\"1/2 hip\\" position), he was careful to point out that this method only worked on targets at the same level as the shooter, and only at very close range. For one hand shooting, the gun is held in a low ready position and on center of the body, and with the wrist and arm locked. The arm stays locked (stiff), as the pistol is then raised from the shoulder. And when on target, a convulsive squeeze is used to fire. To reduce error in the stance, targets not directly in front of the shooter are engaged by turning the upper body at the hips, since turning the arm at the shoulder, elbow, or wrist will result in a loss of control and a miss, while turning at the waist keeps everything aligned correctly. Another of Applegate's training innovations was the use of particularly intense combat firing ranges, which he called the \\"house of horrors\\". A cross between an obstacle course, a haunted house, and a shooting range, it used a three dimensional layout with stairs and tunnels, pop-up targets, deliberately poor lighting, psychologically disturbing sounds, simulated cobwebs and bodies, and blank cartridges being fired towards the shooter. The range was designed to have the greatest possible psychological impact on the shooter, to simulate the stress of combat as much as possible, and no targets were presented at distances of greater than from the shooter. Applegate also used his house of horrors as a test of the point shooting training. Five hundred men with no previous handgun shooting experience were run through the house of horrors after standard, bullseye-type, introductory target pistol training with no gun handling instruction, and then again (with modifications in the layout) after training in Applegate's approach to point shooting and basic gun handling. The average number of hits in the first group was four out of twelve targets hit (with two shots per target). After point shooting, the average jumped to ten out of twelve targets hit. Further shooters trained only in point shooting, including those who had never fired a handgun before receiving point shooting training, maintained the high average established by the first group. Similar methods were in use as early as the 1920s and continue to this day, for example the FBI facility called Hogan's Alley. =Rifle Quick Kill= The proper method of sighting to hit aerial targets with the sightless BB gun A method of point shooting with a rifle was developed by Lucky McDaniel and taught by the US Army beginning in 1967. It was called \\"Quick Kill\\", and it was taught using an air rifle. The Quick Kill method was fully detailed in-step-by-step fashion in Principles of Quick Kill. It was taught starting with a special Daisy BB gun that had no sights. The slow moving steel BB was visible in flight on sunny days, making it an inexpensive tracer round. The students began by firing at diameter metal disks thrown in the air slightly in front of the student and above the student's head. After an 80% hit rate is attained firing at these disks, the student is then presented with diameter disks. Once proficiency is attained with the aerial targets, it shows the student has mastered the fundamentals, and training moves on to stationary targets on the ground, first with the BB gun and then with a service rifle having its front and rear sights taped over. The reason the quick kill method works is that the shooter learns to sight above the barrel, rather than along the barrel. While focusing on the target, the muzzle is placed about below the target (the distance being measured at the muzzle), which places the barrel nearly parallel to the line of sight of the shooter. To hit the aerial targets, or other targets above eye level, the shooter focuses on the top edge of the target. When shooting at targets on the ground or below eye level, the shooter focuses on the bottom of the target. One of the points emphasized in quick kill is that it is essential to focus on a single spot on the target, such as the top edge of a thrown disc, or the bottom edge of a can on the ground. A key to hitting the target is for the shooter to track the target by moving their head with the rifle seated against it, instead of just following it with the eyes. The Daisy company commercially sold sightless BB guns and target throwers for a number of years under the name Quick Skill, along with an instruction book that was a demilitarized version of the aerial target portion of the \\"quick kill\\" course. =Pistol Quick Kill= In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Robin Brown (a former student of Lucky McDaniel) popularized Pistol Quick Kill. With Pistol Quick Kill, the pistol is gripped and pointed at a target much like a person would point their finger. \\"When you point, you naturally do not attempt to sight or aim your finger. It will be somewhat below your eye level in your peripheral vision, perhaps 2-4 inches below eye level.\\" The same applies when pointing a gun at a target. Just as with pointing their finger, the user will \\"...see the end of the barrel and/or front sight while looking at the target...You have not looked at the gun or front sight, just the target.\\" \\"With Quick Kill, the focus is always on the target, never having to adjust one's gaze or focus even remotely on the near object [the gun or sights].\\" =Quick fire= Quick fire is a method previously used by the US Army for teaching point shooting. It is described in the following excerpt from US Army Field Manual FM 23-9: > Aimed. When presented with a target, the soldier brings the rifle up to his > shoulder and quickly fires a single shot. His firing eye looks through or > just over the rear sight aperture. He uses the front sight post to aim at > the target. Using this technique, a target at 25 meters or less may be > accurately engaged in one second or less. > Pointed. When presented with a target, the soldier keeps the rifle at his > side and quickly fires a single shot or burst. He keeps both eyes open and > uses his instinct and peripheral vision to line up the rifle with the > target. Using this technique, a target at 15 meters or less may be engaged > in less than one second. =Reflexive fire= US Navy sailor practices reflexive firing during a periodic weapons assessment Reflexive fire is a method currently used by the US Army to teach short-range marksmanship with a rifle or carbine, but it is considered to be the least accurate of the techniques taught. =Israeli method= The \\"Israeli method\\" is a point shooting system devised by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for use in training personnel to use rifles, submachine guns, and handguns. In its initial stages of training, it closely resembles the FSA method. In later stages, training in the rapid acquisition of the sights is taught, as well as a more advanced method of point shooting. In law enforcement Instinct shooting, referred to as \\"Quick Kill\\", was taught to the U.S. Army using rifles by Lucky McDaniel as far back as the 1960s. McDaniel also taught his point shooting techniques to the police, but using BB guns. Point firing, or instinctive shooting, with rifles developed as a result of direct combat experiences. It is taught by the Israeli, British and French militaries. Instinct shooting with a handgun has been taught at most police academies worldwide since the 1980s. Point firing is similar to Quick Kill, with the sights not being used. The target is usually in close range, between 1‚Äì21 feet, in a life-or-death situation. Chuck Klein defines instinctive combat shooting as \\"the act of operating a handgun by focusing on the target and instinctively coordinating the hand and mind to cause the handgun to discharge at a time and point that ensures interception of the target with the projectile.\\" The shooter should focus on a small point, like a button, stain or corner, not the attacker or target in general. This intense focus is tunnel-vision, which is widely discouraged, but is mandatory for the brief moment when the shooter transitions from deciding to shoot to the completion of shooting. Additional threats and innocents who may be hurt are scanned before the decision to shoot is made, and can be seen in peripheral vision. Between the point at which one decides to shoot and completion of the shot(s), full concentration, oblivious to everything else, is required. The time in which the shooter is engaged in tunnel vision only lasts a matter of milliseconds. Race car driver Phil Hill says, \\"True concentration is not aware of itself.\\" There are no rigid requirements for positioning the body, feet or arms, as the practical use of this technique requires the shooter to be able to shoot from any position, though it is recommended that the shooter practice the technique using common target shooting stances.

(; 1556 ‚Äì 5 February 1597)D'Mello, Ashley, \\"St Gonsalo Garcia: The 1st Indian saint\\", The Times of India, October 13, 2008, was a Franciscan lay brother from Portuguese India, who died as a martyr in Japan and is venerated as a saint, one of the Twenty-six Martyrs of Japan so venerated. The first Indian born to attain sainthood was born in the western coastal town of Ba√ßaim, later Bassein in English (now known as Vasai, an exurb of the city of Mumbai. During his lifetime, the town was under Portuguese colonial rule. Historical background Bassein (or Vasai) is about 30 miles north of Bombay. The Portuguese ruled this place for about 205 years (1534-1739 A.D). In 1498 A.D Vasco da Gama arrived at the harbour of Calicut (Kozhikode) on the western coast of India.http://www.history.com/topics/exploration/vasco-da-gama It was after this that the Portuguese established their power on the western coast of India. During that time John III of Portugal had ascended the throne of Portugal. He appointed Nuno da Cunha as the Governor of Goa in order to conquer the island of Diu from the sultan of Gujarat. Under his leadership, the Portuguese started endeavours to conquer the island of Diu. The Portuguese tried to siege Bassein, because they believed that conquering Bassein would provide them a strategic momentum to acquire Diu. During this period Da Cunha learned that the Sultan Bahadur Shah of Gujarat had sent his forces to build a small fort in Bassein. Governor Nuno da Cunha soon realized that if the Sultan built the fort in Bassein, their desire to conquer Diu would soon be vanished.http://www.portugalweb.net/portugalnomundo/asia/vasai01.asp Ultimately Governor Nuno da Cunha decided to conquer Bassein, after consulting the council of fidalgos (noblemen) in Goa. Portuguese fidalgos and thousands of naval soldiers sailed in the direction of Bassein on 150 ships. A battle took place between the Portuguese forces and those of the Sultan of Gujarat on 20 January 1533, which was won by the Portuguese on the feast day of Saint Sebastian. The fort came into the actual control of Portuguese on 23 December 1534 when Bahadurshah signed a treaty with the Portuguese to hand over the complete authority of Bassein. Following the event, Captain Garcia de S√° was appointed to build Fort Bassein and the work began on 20 January 1536. A number of rich Portuguese fidalgos living in the different towns were attracted to Bassein's climate and location. They came to Bassein and built castle-like palaces in the vicinity of the fortress. Because of these changes the area took on characteristics of a European city. The Portuguese king issued a special order and gave this city the status of ‚Äò√âvora‚Äô i.e. a city in Portugal. The Portuguese nicknamed the city as \\"Dom Ba√ßaim (Bassein)\\" mocking the numerous \\"Dom (a Portuguese title for Sir)\\" people residing in the city of Bassein. The prosperity of Bassein increased such that it was considered among the richest cities among the Portuguese colonies in the world at that time. The dominion of the Portuguese in this part increased and the city became the capital of the Portuguese Province of the North of India; Goa being the capital of Portuguese Province of South. Life =Childhood= Garcia was born in 1557. Documents in the Lisbon Archives (ANTT) describe him as \\"natural de Aga√ßaim\\" (a resident of Agashi village) in Bassein. His father was a Portuguese soldier and his mother a Canarim as the Portuguese called the inhabitants of the Konkan. Modern scholars such as Gense and Conti accept the fact that Gonsalo‚Äôs mother was from Bassein.http://brmichaelindia.blogspot.in/2014/02/feast-of-st-gonsalo- gracia.html According to Garcia's companion, Marcelo de Ribandeneira, who became a historian and is considered as the most authentic source on his life, Garcia once told him that his mother was from Bassein and his father a Portuguese soldier. Hence the papal bull declaring Garcia a saint mentions that he was Basseinite (a native of Bassein). As the child of a European father and an Indian mother he was a mesti√ßo in the Portuguese sense of term. Window pane in the Cathedral of Pune Garcia spent eight years (1564-1572) in Fort Bassein. The fort was reserved for the European people and their servants. According to the policy adopted by the Portuguese colonial government, any Portuguese who got married with a local woman was given certain privileges. So Garcia‚Äôs father was permitted to quit the job and stayed in the fort as a civilian employee, and because of that his family came to reside inside the fort. He studied at the Jesuit school of Fort Bassein and helped in their Igreja do Santo Nome de Jesus (Church of the Holy Name of Jesus), now known as St. Gonsalo Garcia Church. Here Garcia came into contact with the Jesuit priest, Sebasti√£o Gonsalves, who became a friend and guide throughout his life. During his stay with the Jesuits, he learned grammar, philosophy and Roman history. =Lay missionary= Garcia was willing to accompany to Japan the Jesuit missionaries who were sent there from Bassein. In 1569 he told Gonsalves about his desire to go East, but his request was turned down as he was quite young. But in 1572 Gonsalves permitted him when he was fifteen. He surprised Garcia by disclosing that he had also decided to leave for Japan. The two missionaries left Bassein together in the first week of March 1572 and reached Japan the following July. During the course of his voyage, Garcia learned Japanese with the help of a Japanese native who accompanied them on the same ship. Garcia was appointed a catechist () by the Jesuit missionaries he had accompanied. As a missionary, he went about in public places drawing children to himself by his amiable disposition, by his fluency in the language of the country and by his kindness. Garcia reached one and all and soon became a favorite with the Japanese. He served them faithfully as a catechist for eight years. In the meantime, he had expressed the desire to join the Jesuit Order. Though promises of admission were held out to him, his Indian ancestry proved to be a bar to his entry in the Society of Jesus. Finally Garcia lost hope and left the company of the Jesuits, much to their regret. =Missionary-turned-merchant= On leaving the Jesuits, Garcia went to another city named Alacao. There he established himself as a merchant. He did not, however, lose his spirit of piety and Christian zeal because of his new career. Gradually, his business transactions expanded and he was able to found new establishments. His commercial relations brought him into contact with all the ranks of Japanese society. His business flourished and he gained great wealth. Still, at heart, he remained a religious man in word and deed. Later, he resolved to become a Franciscan Friar. His petition for admission to the Friars Minor, which he made to the Guardian of the Franciscan friary in Manila was accepted. In this way, as a Friar Minor, Garcia began the second phase of his missionary activities. =A Franciscan preacher= Garcia was very much delighted when he was accepted into the Franciscan order. In Manila, he came into contact with the Franciscan missionary, Friar Peter Baptist, who remained his companion until their shared death. Garcia started his career as a catechist in Manila. The main advantage for him was his ability to speak the Japanese language. From the different parts of Japan, people began to send him invitations to return. It was at this time that the King of Spain wanted to send a delegation to Japan. The Spanish Governor of Manila selected Peter Baptist as the leader of the delegation, and, since he did not know the Japanese language, Garcia was selected as his translator as well as his companion. Garcia was so happy with this offer that he immediately accepted the responsibility. The missionaries left Manila on 21 May 1593 and reached Hirado, a harbor in Japan, on 8 July 1593. In Japan, Garcia became the center of attraction, as he knew Japanese language well. After facing some initial difficulties the Franciscans settled in Japan and began their missionary work in Kyoto, Osaka, etc. The Japanese regent Toyotomi Hideyoshi was very friendly with these Franciscans. It was a time when Jesuits were facing lot of opposition in Japan. The people of Japan appreciated the simple way of living adopted by these Franciscan missionaries. It helped them to accelerate their conversion program. Many Japanese, including their overlords. began to accept Christianity. Slowly Japan became the great center of evangelization for the Franciscan missionaries. =Clouds of adversity= The Franciscans were very successful in their conversion policy. In response, however, the traditional religious lenders began to express opposition. They tried to influence the regent Hideyoshi to take action against the Franciscans and to expel them, but Hideyoshi refused to budge. The situation, however, took a turn for the worse with the arrival of the ill-fated Spanish ship San Felipe. It was bound from Manila to Acapulco, but due to a terrible tempest, it was driven onto the coast of Japan. It was laden with gold and silver when it anchored in Urado Bay. The pilot of the ship, Francisco de Olandia, while conversing with the Japanese customs officials, spoke of \\"La Espanha de los Conquistadores\\" and boasted that the King of Spain had captured many countries in the world. He told them that the King of Spain sent the missionaries first to instigate the people against their ruler. When the matter was reported to Toyotomi Hideyoshi, he became enraged. The situation was exploited by Yakuin Zenso, his physician and close advisor. The shogun issued an order to arrest and execute all Christian missionaries in Japan. The Franciscans, including Peter Baptist, Garcia and others were arrested on 8 December 1596 and were sentenced to death. There were three Jesuits also, including the native seminarian, Paul Miki. =Road to martyrdom= On 4 January the prisoners who had been sentenced to death began their journey from Kyoto. They traveled six hundred miles from Kyoto to Nagasaki through Sakai, Okayama, Hiroshima, Shimonoseki, and Karatsu. They reached Nagasaki on 4 February 1597. The next morning they were taken to a hill known as Nishigaoka where Terazawa Hazaburo, the brother of the Governor of Nagasaki, had planned for the crucifixion to take place. As Garcia was prominent among the missionaries, he was given the middle place. There Garcia met one of his friends from Fort Bassein, Francis Rodrigues Pinto, to whom he said: \\"My good friend, God be with you. I am going to heaven. A hearty hug to Father Sebasti√£o Gonsalves on my behalf\\". The execution started at 10 o'clock in the morning. He, Peter Baptist, and the other friars were crucified, along with fifteen teenage boys who were members of the Third Order of Saint Francis, as well as the three Jesuits. The condemned were so tired that they could not endure it for long and within half an hour everything was over. The two soldiers who worked as executioners completed their task by stabbing their spears into the missionaries' chests. The Portuguese and Japanese Christians attending the execution broke past the guards and started soaking pieces of cloth in the blood of the executed, gathering lumps of the blood-soaked dirt, and tearing up their religious habits and kimonos for holy relics. The guards beat the relic-hunters away and order was reestablished. Terazawa positioned guards all around the hill, with strict orders not to allow anyone near the crosses. After completing the task, Terazawa withdrew from the hill. Veneration After the sensational drama, the corpses of the victims were neglected by the local authorities thinking that they would be eaten by the vultures. But for nearly forty days they remained intact. Afterwards it was reported in The Examiner (12 March 1904) that the Portuguese brought the head of Garcia to India, where it was kept at Fort Bassein. They carried it to Goa when they left Bassein in 1739 (page 82). Since the author of the article does not mention the source of the information, it cannot be taken to be a historical fact. Then followed a series of miracles on the concerned hill in Nagasaki. So in 1627, thirty-five years after the crucifixion of the martyrs, Pope Urban VIII declared Garcia and his co-martyrs as ‚ÄòBlessed Ones‚Äô and permitted the Jesuits and the Franciscans to venerate them. This permission was extended to other religions later on, but in 1629 the same Pope completed the beatification of these martyrs. The matter was neglected for more than two centuries. It was once again taken up in 1862 and on 8 June 1862 Pope Pius IX did the canonization of Gonsalo Garcia and his co-martyrs. Brother Gonsalo Garcia became St. Gonsalo Garcia. The first catholic Saint of India and the Indian Sub-Continent, and 8 June 2012 marked the 150th anniversary of his canonization. Legacy Garcia's memory is kept alive with a college named after him in Vasai. He is the patron saint of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Vasai and his feast day is a joint one for the group of martyrs, on February 6 (as the actual day of his heavenly birth, February 5, is the feast of St. Agatha). Thomas Dabre, the Bishop of Vasai, says Garcia's relevance even today lies in the universalism of his charity and love. A small statue of Gon√ßalo Garcia was taken from Portugal to Recife in Brazil as early as 1745 by a local Brazilian -because of his brown complexion (a further proof of his Indian ancestry)- where his veneration soon took off.

It is part of the Ewart Park Phase that dates from the ninth century BC. Numerous distinctive metal items have been found in founder's hoards from the Thames valley and Kent that differ from items found elsewhere in Britain. Related items have been found in Ireland and in France. The period was one where experiments in alloying lead with bronze were being used to develop new artefact types some of which have an uncertain purpose. The complex is named after the carp's tongue sword but other objects include triangular perforated knives, hog's back knives, socketed and end-winged axes, and mysterious bugle-shaped objects. Quite why so much experimentation was taking place at a time when iron was increasingly supplanting bronze as the material of choice is uncertain. Colin Burgess has argued that new techniques triggered a kind of industrial revolution, others that there was an oversupply of bronze that smiths were obliged to find something to do with.

Their range is much of Southeast Asia (northeast India, southern China, Borneo, Thailand, Java, and Bali). Most of the species in this genus can be referred to as lutungs, langurs, or leaf monkeys. The name \\"lutung\\" comes from the Sundanese language and means \\"blackness\\"; it is preferred by some authors because it distinguishes the genus from the \\"true\\" langurs of the Indian subcontinent. Description Lutungs have a rather slim build with a long tail. The fur color varies, depending on the species, from black and grey to orange yellow. Many species have skin designs and a brighter lower surface, the hair on the head is often compared to a hood. Their arms are very short in comparison to the feet and their thumbs are also somewhat shorter. The inner surfaces of the hands and feet are hairless so that their fur does not get caught when reaching into branches. These animals reach a length of 40 to 80 cm and a weight of 5 to 15 kg, with males generally larger than females. A bulge over the eyes and other details, primarily in the head, differentiate it from the surilis. Francois' langur (Trachypithecus francoisi) Habitat and behaviour Lutungs live in the forests, often preferring rain forests, although occasionally they are also found in secluded mountain forests. They spend the largest part of the day in the trees, where they crawl along the branches on all fours, although they can also jump well from tree to tree. They are diurnal, although more active in the early mornings and the afternoon. They live in groups of five to 20 animals, mostly in harems, i.e. a single male with several females. Young males must leave their birth group when fully mature, often forming bachelor groups. If a new male takes over a harem, defeating and scaring off the harem leader, he often kills the children of the group. Lutungs are territorial, with loud shouting to defend their territories from other lutung interlopers, resorting to force if the outsiders are not scared off. They have a common repertoire of sounds with which they warn group members. Also, mutual grooming plays an important role. Lutungs are herbivores, primarily eating leaves, fruits, and buds. To digest the tough leaves, they developed a multichambered stomach. Reproduction Rarely twins, a typical single birth comes after a seven-month gestation period. Newborns usually have a golden-yellow fur. The mother shares responsibilities of rearing the young with the other females (\\"aunties\\") of the harem. They hand the young around, play with it, carry it, and cuddle it, while the mother searches for food. If the mother dies, another female adopts the young animal. Lutungs are weaned in the latter half of their first year, and reach full maturity at 4 to 5 years. The life expectancy is estimated at 20 years. Species Nilgiri langur, formerly classified within the genus Trachypithecus but since moved to the genus Semnopithecus As of 2005, the authors of Mammal Species of the World recognize the following Trachypithecus species: * Genus Trachypithecus ** T. vetulus group - moved into genus Semnopithecus in most recent classifications *** Purple-faced langur, Trachypithecus vetulus *** Nilgiri langur, Trachypithecus johnii ** T. cristatus group *** Javan lutung, Trachypithecus auratus *** Silvery lutung or silvered leaf monkey, Trachypithecus cristatus *** Germain's langur, Trachypithecus germaini *** Tenasserim lutung, Trachypithecus barbei ** T. obscurus group *** Dusky leaf monkey, Trachypithecus obscurus *** Phayre's leaf monkey, Trachypithecus phayrei ** T. pileatus group *** Capped langur, Trachypithecus pileatus *** Shortridge's langur, Trachypithecus shortridgei *** Gee's golden langur, Trachypithecus geei ** T. francoisi group *** Francois' langur, Trachypithecus francoisi *** Hatinh langur, Trachypithecus hatinhensis *** White-headed langur, Trachypithecus poliocephalus *** Laotian langur, Trachypithecus laotum *** Delacour's langur, Trachypithecus delacouri *** Indochinese black langur, Trachypithecus ebenus Since then, the T. vetulus group (the purple-faced langur and the Nilgiri langur) have been moved the genus Semnopithecus based on DNA and other evidence. In 2008, Roos, et al described the Malay Peninsula form of the silvery lutung as a separate subspecies and subsequently it has been elevated to a separate species within the T. cristatus group as the Selangor silvered langur, T. selangorensis. Roos, et al also elevated the West Javan Langur, Trachypithecus mauritius, and Annamese Langur, Trachypithecus margarita, to species status (formerly subspecies of T. auratus and T. germaini, respectively). This leaves the current understanding of the genus Trachypithecus to be: * Genus Trachypithecus ** T. cristatus group *** East Javan langur, Trachypithecus auratus *** West Javan Langur, Trachypithecus mauritius *** Silvery lutung or silvered leaf monkey, Trachypithecus cristatus *** Selangor silvered langur, T. selangorensis *** Germain's langur, Trachypithecus germaini *** Annamese Langur, Trachypithecus margarita *** Tenasserim lutung, Trachypithecus barbei ** T. obscurus group *** Dusky leaf monkey, Trachypithecus obscurus *** Phayre's leaf monkey, Trachypithecus phayrei ** T. pileatus group *** Capped langur, Trachypithecus pileatus *** Shortridge's langur, Trachypithecus shortridgei *** Gee's golden langur, Trachypithecus geei ** T. francoisi group *** Francois' langur, Trachypithecus francoisi *** Hatinh langur, Trachypithecus hatinhensis *** White-headed langur, Trachypithecus poliocephalus *** Laotian langur, Trachypithecus laotum *** Delacour's langur, Trachypithecus delacouri *** Indochinese black langur, Trachypithecus ebenus Lutung or Spectacled Leaf Monkey seen searching for leaves early in the morning in SK Taman Rakan, Kajang in Malaysia. Evolution Trachypithecus cristatus robustus skull Genetic analysis indicates that the ancestors of the modern species of lutung first differentiated from one another a little over 3 million years ago, during the late Pliocene. The various species alive today then diverged during the Pleistocene, presumably driven by habitat changes during the Ice Ages. The oldest fossils clearly identified as belonging to the genus date from the middle Pleistocene of Vietnam and Laos; later fossils are also known from Thailand, Java, and Sumatra. The closest living relatives of the lutungs are probably either the gray langurs or the surilis, although the exact relationships remain unclear, possibly due to hybridisation between these genera during the course of their recent evolutionary history. Trivia The city Luodong in Taiwan is named after this monkey species. A lutung features in the Sundanese folktale Lutung Kasarung (\\"The lost lutung\\"), which in 1926 was adapted into the first Indonesian movie.

With an enrollment of over 12,000 students as of fall 2017, the university is the third-largest institution in the Texas A&M; University System. Founded in 1889, the institution is also the fourth-oldest state university or college in the State of Texas. Located on the north eastern edge of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, approximately 65 miles from downtown Dallas, the university attracts traditional resident students from the Metroplex and also from the smaller communities of Northeast Texas. In addition to the main campus in Hunt County, the university has satellite campuses in downtown Dallas, and Mesquite; it also offers courses in Corsicana and Midlothian in partnership with Navarro College and in Frisco and McKinney with Collin College. History Cooper in 1890 ETSTC Heritage Garden The history of Texas A&M; University‚ÄìCommerce commenced in 1889 with its establishment as East Texas Normal College (ETNC) in Cooper by Kentucky native William L. Mayo as a private teachers' college based on Normal principles. ETNC relocated to Commerce after its original campus was destroyed in a fire in July 1894. One of Commerce's chief advantages was that it was well connected by rail, boasting regular service on the St. Louis Southwestern Railway of Texas (\\"Cotton Belt\\") to Dallas, Sherman, and Texarkana and on the Texas Midland Railroad to Paris, Ennis, and Houston. ETNC was renamed East Texas State Normal College in 1917 after it was acquired by the State of Texas and transformed into a public college. In 1923, it was renamed East Texas State Teachers College to define its purpose \\"more clearly\\", and in 1935, it began its graduate education program. The institution was renamed East Texas State College in 1957, after the Texas Legislature recognized its broadening scope beyond teacher education. Following the inauguration of the institution's first doctoral program in 1962, its name was changed to East Texas State University (ETSU) in 1965. It integrated in 1964 when ordered to do so by the board of regents. ETSU obtained a separate board of regents in 1969, and the approval to open a branch campus in Texarkana in 1971. While the student body shrank in size in the late 1970s and early 1980s, it became increasingly diverse as older nontraditional students, ethnic and racial minorities, and international students all grew in numbers. The economic downturn in Texas in the mid-1980s seriously threatened the university, leading to proposals to close it entirely before a bus trip with 450 supporters trekked to the State Capitol in a show of support that ultimately secured its continued existence. In 1996, ETSU was admitted into the Texas A&M; University System (TAMUS) and renamed Texas A&M; University‚ÄìCommerce (A&M;‚ÄìCommerce). ETSU's former branch campus in Texarkana was renamed Texas A&M; University‚ÄìTexarkana and admitted into TAMUS as a separate university. = University presidents = # William Leonidas Mayo (1889‚Äì1917) # Randolph Binnion (1917‚Äì24) # Samuel Henry Whitley (1924‚Äì46) # Arthur C.

The College of Education and Human Services is perhaps the most well-known college within the university and is one of the foremost education- focused institutions in the state of Texas among all universities, both public and private, and has produced numerous successful and notable teachers and school administrators. Texas A&M; Commerce has agreements with many school districts in the DFW area and Northeast Texas to send their undergraduates to student-teach, and also has a notable graduate school for those educators who are in pursuit of advanced degrees in teaching and education and also, a well known doctoral program for those pursuing a PhD in education. Accordingly, Texas A&M-Commerce; is a Level II Doctoral Research University, classified by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. In the summer of 2013, the College of Education and Human Services at Texas A&M-Commerce; was ranked number one in Texas for teaching education among all universities, public and private, and 13th in the entire nation by the Directory of U.S. Colleges Database Online Magazine. The College of Business (CB) has over the past three decades become a highly respected Tier II business school in Texas and beyond. The CB offers graduate and undergraduate degrees in accounting, finance, general business administration, management, marketing, applied arts and sciences, and business analytics. The CB has been nationally recognized for its MBA program, and was ranked as the fifth-best program overall in the 2012 edition of U.S. News & World Reports annual \\"Best Graduate School\\" issue. Both the MBA and the undergraduate accounting programs were mentioned in both Forbes and the Wall Street Journal as best buys for programs offered by Tier II schools in Texas. The college also has a large number of professors with tenure and emeritus status, who provide lectures and speaking engagements nationally and internationally, which reflects the quality of business- oriented educational opportunity that Texas A&M-Commerce; has to offer. Art Building The College of Humanities, Social Sciences, and Arts offers degree programs for most liberal-arts programs offered at Texas A&M-Commerce.; Degrees and courses of study offered in this college include liberal arts, history, performing arts, music and music education, literature and language, mass media and communications, theatre, political science, and sociology and criminal justice. The college also offers undergraduates who are pursuing a political science degree who wish to attend law school for postgraduate work, a career in a law-preparatory program, as well as LSAT test preparation that is also administered on campus. Students who major in broadcast journalism and mass media are given the opportunity to join the staff for the school newspaper, and also use and perfect skills working for KKOM, KETV-3, and the region's source for public broadcasting radio news and information, KETR. The College of Science and Engineering is the most recent academic addition at Texas A&M; University‚ÄìCommerce. This college offers degrees in biology, environmental sciences, chemistry, computer Science and information systems, computational science, mathematics, engineering technology, physics, and astronomy. The physics and astronomy department has an award-winning planetarium located within the McFarland Science Building, attracting students from area schools and interested visitors, as well. The College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources The School of Agriculture was renamed the College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources in April 2018. Majors include agribusiness, agricultural sciences, agricultural science and technology, animal science, wildlife and conservation science, and equine studies. The college operates an educational farm and ranch about 5 miles south of Commerce on Texas State Highway 24, where students are able to engage in a hands-on approach to agriculture sciences and animal handling.http://www.tamuc.edu/academics/colleges/scienceEngineeringAgriculture/departments/agriculturalSciences/default.aspx  Campus  Aerial shot of Texas A&M; University-Commerce The campus is located 15 minutes from Interstate 30 and an hour drive from Dallas, Texas State Highway 24 intersects the campus into two separate sections. The majority of the campus is located on the east side of Highway 24, and a smaller portion is located on the west side. A picturesque lake is located near the main campus entrance. The campus has a range of newer and older buildings, with the oldest building being Ferguson Social Sciences Building, which opened in 1926 with classrooms and a large auditorium. One of the newer buildings on campus is the Phase II residence hall which was constructed in 2013. The university also owns and operates an 1,800-acre farm and ranch with an equine center located near the main campus. A new Music Building was recently constructed that includes a state of the art concert hall for various musical performances. = Waters Library = Waters Library Velma K Waters Library is named in honor of the first undergraduate African American student to enroll at A&M-Commerce.; She graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree from the university in 1968 and taught in Carthage, Texas. The library was previously named in honor of Dr. James Gilliam Gee, a former president of the university who served from 1947 to 1966, but was renamed in August 2020.

Pin shooting is often described as one of the most enjoyable shooting games and one of the easiest means of introducing a new shooter into regular competitive shooting. Pinshooting appeals to both genders. There are many female pinshooters and many distinguished female pinshooters. History Massad Ayoob credit the origin of bowling pin shooting with Richard Davis in the mid 1970s. The sport peaked in popularity in the 1980s. Rules Depending on the caliber of handgun used and the table employed, the pins must be knocked backwards up to to be knocked clear of the table and onto the ground. The pin shooting tables typically consist of one of the following varieties: # 3 pins placed on a waist high table, with 2 additional pins placed on a second tier over the others at each end, forming a crude \\"U.\\" # 5 pins placed on a flat table, with the pins being placed from the back edge, or rear of the front edge. Targets used can vary, but are usually tenpin bowling pins. Steel targets or electronic targets are also sometimes used. Pin shooting is conducted with both revolvers and semi- automatic pistols in calibers ranging from .22 Long Rifle to .480 Ruger, and others. Bowling pin competition is often recognized to be a big-bore event in which large caliber or high-power handguns such as the .38 Super, .357 Magnum, 10mm, .41 Magnum, .44 Magnum, .45 ACP, .45 Colt and other large-bore handguns have the greatest advantage in removing the pins from the table. Frequently, no allowance is made for shooters who shoot lower-power handguns, though some range officers may permit the distance to the back of the table be reduced to for \\"minor\\" calibers like 9mm Luger and .38 Special so that these \\"minor\\" calibers can approximate head-to-head equivalency with \\"major\\" calibers. While handloaded ammunition is regularly employed among pinshooters, it is considered a serious breach of etiquette and sportsmanship for a shooter of a \\"minor\\" caliber to handload \\"minor\\" ammunition to levels approaching \\"major\\" calibers, thus taking unfair advantage of a rule intended to allow novice shooters to participate. Shooters who shoot \\"hot\\" \\"minor\\" ammunition should declare such to the range officer and shoot targets from the regular pin placement. Some ranges conduct centerfire handgun competition based on class. When classes are employed, three classes often are recognized: revolver, stock, and pin gun. Magazine capacity may limited to 8 rounds in most competitions in which magazine-fed guns compete only against magazine-fed guns. In events where revolvers compete with magazine-fed guns, magazines are restricted to seven shots, out of respect for the customary six-shot revolver cylinder. The \\"pin gun class\\" is for highly advanced, often very expensive \\"race guns\\" in which almost all manner of enhancement is allowed, including optical sights (generally red dot sights) and compensators. The pins are placed far enough away from each other that they are unlikely to interact when hit, so a separate shot is needed to down each pin. The broad spacing and different levels make it challenging to move from target to target. Indirect hits will result in pins lying on their sides on the table in a situation known as \\"deadwood,\\" where multiple shots may be required to clear the pin from the table. \\"Deadwood\\" is further complicated in that one deadwood pin may be lying next to another deadwood pin, interfering with a clear path to knocking either deadwood pin from the table. Generally, .22 Long Rifle competitions shoot the tops of the pins, known as \\"pin-tops,\\" which are lighter and more easily knocked down by the light, comparatively low energy bullets. Occasionally, a .22 match may be shot by placing pins at the very back of the table so that the comparatively light .22 hit will still knock the pin off the table. Some matches are also shot with a semiautomatic or pump shotgun, firing buckshot. As shotgun rounds quickly disintegrate the pins, such matches are customarily reserved for the end of a match, when a supply of pins unfit for handgun matches may be put to final utility. Some types of matches allow carbines or submachine guns.  Types of competition  Bracket- style: \\"Bracket-style\\" is shot in pairs of shooters. Each shooter will have his or her own table of pins, and the winner of the round is the shooter whose entire obligation of pins hits the ground first. Pins that are merely in flight do not count until they hit the ground. It is similar to the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship, in which shooters are paired against one another, with the round winner advancing to the next level, until an overall match winner is determined. Matches conducted along such lines are tremendously exciting, as a top shooter may fumble, pause or have a momentary equipment failure, allowing a lesser shooter to claim the round. \\"Bracket- style\\" competitions often contain a concurrent \\"losers' bracket,\\" where the losers in the \\"winners' bracket\\" compete for a lesser bracket win. \\"Bracket style\\" has sometimes been referred to as a \\"gun drag race\\". Timed: Some ranges conduct matches in a timed format, where a shooter clears three tables in an observed time, and the averages of the three tables are computed in a simple mean. The shooter with the overall fastest average wins the match. King of the Hill: Two shooters conduct a round. The winner shoots against a new shooter, though a sixth pin is added to the winner's table, while the challenger shoots the regular five pins. If the winner takes the subsequent round, a seventh pin is added to the winner's table, until such time as a challenger will be able to clear five pins than the King's ever-growing allotment. When the King of the Hill is beaten, the challenger becomes the new King, and a sixth pin is added, and the round continues until the participants arrive at a stopping point. Magazine restrictions are typically removed for King of the Hill matches.  The pins  Bowling pins are often discarded by bowling alleys after a certain amount of use, at which time pin shooters collect them for use in pin shooting. Modern plastic coated bowling pins are very resilient, and can absorb many rounds before becoming too splintered or unbalanced to function as targets. Generally pins start out as targets for the centerfire handguns, then when they start to disintegrate they are saved for use as shotgun targets. At the start of the event, or when a fresh pin is introduced, a smaller-caliber handgun may be able to remove a pin with comparable authority as a large-bore handgun. As rounds are shot, however, the pins will add weight, as the pins become filled with lead bullets. When the pins add weight, smaller-caliber handguns suffer a great disadvantage, as the smaller round loses ability to move the pin, while the large-bore guns are easily able to clear a bullet-laden pin from the table with speed and authority. Pins that will no longer stand on their bases have their heads sawed off down to become rimfire targets for the .22 match, where the \\"pin tops\\" are engaged by the shooter. Given the very light weight of the \\"pin top,\\" the .22 is quite capable of removing the target from the table with a single well-placed shot.  The goal of pinshooting  Pinshooting is fun, competitive, practical shooting that sharpens one‚Äôs handgun skills under time pressure. While winning is the ultimate goal and obviously rewarding, all pinshooters can expect an event that will improve their skills in the company of fellow shooters who are supportive.

History Under the Iraqi constitution of 1925, Iraq was a constitutional monarchy, with a bicameral legislature consisting of an elected House of Representatives and an appointed Senate. The lower house was elected every four years by manhood suffrage (women did not vote). The first Parliament met in 1925. Ten general elections were held before the overthrow of the monarchy in 1958. The electoral system, however, was manipulated by the King and his advisors, who were Sunni Muslims, to ensure that the Shi'a majority were prevented from taking power. Between 1958 and 2003 Iraq was ruled by a series of military governments, all dominated by Iraqi Arabs, particularly after the emergence of the Ba'ath Party in the early 1960s. Under the regime of Saddam Hussein, who came to power in 1979, Kurds and Shi'a majority were persecuted. Saddam's rule was largely run by Sunni Arabs from Tikrit (a mainly Sunni area), his home region. On 16 October 2002, after a well-publicized show election, Iraqi officials declared that Saddam had been re-elected to another seven-year term as President by a 100% unanimous vote of all 11,445,638 eligible Iraqis, eclipsing the 99.96% received in 1995. Outside governments dismissed the vote as lacking credibility.  January 2005 Iraqi parliamentary election  The multinational force's 2003 invasion of Iraq overthrew Saddam's government and installed an interim administration. An initial Iraqi attempt at holding local elections was canceled by Paul Bremer. This government held elections on 30 January 2005 to begin the process of writing a constitution. International groups and the formerly excluded factions claimed that the January 2005 elections were the first free elections in Iraq's history, with a fair representation of all groups. This is in stark contrast to previous elections. After the 16 October 2002 referendum on the extension of his role as President, Saddam Hussein claimed that 100% of the voters voted \\"yes\\" and that 100% of Iraqi's had voted (approximately 24,001,820 people). Opponents of the occupation, such as the various insurgent groups, claimed the elections were not free and fair, citing flaws in the process. The UN adviser to Iraq's election commission Craig Jenness said the complaints were not significant; \\"I don't see anything that would necessitate a rerun.... There were nearly 7,000 candidates standing in this election and only 275 seats, so you're always going to have winners and losers and it's normal that the losers won't always be happy about it.\\"  December 2005 Iraqi parliamentary election   2009: request for national elections  The issue arising was the interpretation of Article 56 of the constitution which states: First: The electoral term of the Council of Representatives shall be four calendar years, starting with its first session and ending with the conclusion of the fourth year. Second: The new Council of Representatives shall be elected forty-five days before the conclusion of the preceding electoral term. The previous election had been on 15 December 2005. The opening session of the Council of Representatives had been 16 March 2006 (the swearing in session) and the first substantive session of the Council of Representatives was then held on 22 April 2006. The Court was of the opinion that the swearing in session on 16 March 2006 was the \\"first session\\" as required by Article 56(First). It therefore followed that the conclusion of the fourth year would be on 15 March 2010 and that the election should be 45 days prior to 15 March 2010, i.e., 30 January 2010. The court decided that the calendar year referred to was the 365-day Gregorian year (and not for example the 360-day Hijri year).  2010 Iraqi parliamentary election  2013 provincial councils (local government) elections =2013 elections statistics\\"Iraq 2013 Elections Numbers & Turnout,\\" Posted by H Al Researcher, especialview.wordpress.com (21 April 2013).= *Overall turnout: 51% (Similar to turnout in 2009 Elections) *Number of registered eligible voters: Approx. 13,800,000 (Including 14,000 prisoners, 55,000 hospital patients and 53,000 displaced Iraqis eligible to vote). *Number of voters turned out: 6,400,777 voters *Elections are held: 12 provinces (out of 18 provinces). ::Four provinces are part of the semi-autonomous region Kurdistan with their Elections in September 2013, two provinces (Anbar, Nineveh) requested to postpone their elections due to security reasons. *No. of seats contested: 378 seats in Province Councils (Local Government). *Number of candidates: 8138 *Female candidates: 2205 *Male candidates: 5933 This is the sixth voting exercise by Iraqis in 10 years: *2004 National Assembly Elections *2005 Constitution Referendum *2005 Parliamentary Elections *2009 Provincial Councils *2010 Parliamentary elections *2013 Provincial Council (Saturday 20 April) *Number of parties and alliances competing: 256 parties and 50 political alliances *International independent observers (non-Iraqi): 350 *Local independent observers: 6,000 *Political parties‚Äô observers (political entity representatives): 267,388 *Polling stations: 5,370 (5,178)¬π *Ballot boxes: 32,445 (32,201)¬≤ election ballot box ::Including polling stations in prisons and hospitals. *Polling stations opening time: 07:00 to 17:00 (Baghdad Time) *IHEC Help Centre Freephone: 2800 calls received from voters. *Local Help Centres set up by IHEC: 12 (one in each province). *IHEC staff (including reserve staff): 180,000 ::100% of staff in this election were Iraqis *Local journalists and media: 2,256 *International journalists: 187 =Basrah= In Basrah the numbers were as follows: Voter turnout: 42%http://newslinexpress.wordpress.com/2013/05/02/basrah-iraqs-oil-city- elections/ Registered eligible voters: Approx. 1,600,000 Ballots cast: Approx. 650,000 Candidates: 656 Contested seats: 35 Council seats (1 seat reserved for Christian quota) Political entities: 25 (party and alliance) In the first elections since the withdrawal of U.S. forces, the Iraqi Independent Electoral Commission (IHEC) confirmed that 6,400,777 voters cast their votes. 2018 parliamentary election See also * Assyrian elections in Iraq * History of Iraq * Electoral calendar * Electoral system * 2010 Iraqi Status of Forces Agreement referendum References External links *Iraqi Independent High Electoral Commission *Op-Ed by former Iraqi Premier Ayad Allawi on Iraqi electoral reform *Adam Carr's Election Archive *UN rules out Iraqi election rerun *UN-led team finds Iraq election credible *Iraq's Electoral system is a part of the problem says Regional Expert *Provincial Elections in Iraq: Blow to Confessionalism (Qantara.de) *Global Justice Project: Iraq * Iraq Inter-Agency Information & Analysis Unit Reports, Maps and Assessments of Iraq from the UN Inter-Agency Information & Analysis Unit ","title":"Elections in Iraq"},{"id":"1382488","text":"River Derwent Allensford is a small country park and hamlet in County Durham, in England.

Like most martial arts, combat pistol shooting is practiced both for defense and for sport. Many of the action shooting disciplines are based on combat pistol techniques, and take the form of simulations of defensive or combat situations. History International Settlement in Shanghai, during the 1920s. Combat pistol shooting, as separate from target shooting, began to evolve in the early 1900s. Modern tactics of pistol combat were developed in the 1920s by two British members of the Shanghai Municipal Police. (Shanghai was then governed by an international government). At the time the Shanghai streets were rife with criminal activity, and policing in the city was becoming a very dangerous line of work. Captain William E. Fairbairn and Sergeant Eric A. Sykes developed innovative pistol shooting techniques and handgun specifications for the police force. During the Second World War, they were recalled to Britain, and trained the British Commandos in their combat tactics, including their system of combat pistol shooting. Their methodology was later disseminated through their book Shooting To Live With The One-Hand Gun, published in 1942. These techniques were also adopted for the training of American Office of Strategic Services troops by Rex Applegate. This system lives on today in modern point shooting techniques. In the 1950s, American instructor Jeff Cooper was instrumental in establishing both a combat pistol based sport, International Practical Shooting Confederation, and a combat pistol training school, Gunsite. Cooper's methodology has become known as the modern technique. The methods promoted by Fairbairn and Cooper differ in many respects, and to this day there are arguments between supporters of the different methodologies. Combat pistol drills =El Presidente= One combat pistol drill is the El Presidente drill, developed by Jeff Cooper in the 1970s and published in the January/February 1979 issue of American Handgunner magazine. This is used as a benchmark to gauge a shooter's skills, as it tests the draw and reload, and requires good transitions and follow- through. The El Presidente drill is set up as follows: *Three silhouette targets are placed 1 meter apart in a line 10 meters from the shooter. *The shooter starts with six rounds in a holstered handgun, and a spare magazine or speedloader with another six rounds. *The shooter begins facing directly away from the targets, often with hands clasped in front or over the head. *Upon the starting signal, the shooter turns and draws, fires two shots at each target, reloads, and then fires two more shots at each target. Scoring varies; the simplest method uses hit/miss scoring, with a time penalty (often 10 seconds) for each miss. El Presidente drills scored under the IPSC Comstock system take the total number of points on the targets (possible 60 points) and divide that by the time taken to complete the drill. This generates a number called \\"hit factor,\\" which is a numerical representation of how many points the shooter placed on target per second during the drill; e.g., shooting 55 points in 5.5 seconds would give the shooter a 10.0 hit factor. Originally, a time of 10 seconds with a stock handgun, and all the points on target, was considered good. Today, shooters using modern IPSC raceguns with muzzle brakes and red dot sights are close to breaking the three-second barrier, and even shooters using production guns with no muzzle brakes or optical sights routinely break the five-second mark. =The Dozier Drill= This drill was invented by Jeff Cooper after the kidnapping of Brigadier General James L. Dozier by Italian Red Brigade terrorists. The terrorists had entered General Dozier's apartment by posing as plumbers. As many as eight completed the gang and four or perhaps five entered the apartment. One of the terrorists removed a submachine gun from his bag of tools while another terrorist read a political statement to General Dozier. At that time, US military personnel were prohibited by Italian law from carrying firearms within their areas of accommodation, which were within the local community and not on US bases. General Dozier was unarmed and unable to defend himself. In response to this incident, Jeff Cooper designed the \\"Dozier drill\\". The range is set with five metal silhouette targets which are hinged at their base (called \\"Pepper Poppers\\") so as to fall backwards when struck. A second participant stands well to one side and is tasked with retrieving a pistol and a magazine from a toolbag, which he must assemble and ready for action. This action mimics the terrorist who retrieved his submachine gun from his toolbag and provides a datum against which the shooter must compare his performance. On the signal, the shooter must draw his pistol and engage the five targets, representing the five terrorists, before the participant representing the terrorist retrieves his weapon and readies it for use. =Malfunction clearing drills= When engaged in combat shooting, sometimes cartridges do not feed into the chamber properly. These malfunctions must be corrected quickly so that firing can be resumed. There are variations of malfunction drills, including the two most often required in competition: clearing a cartridge that fails to fire, and clearing a double feed malfunction. # User error: Magazine improperly seated, ammunition is not loaded upon racking of the slide. # Stovepipe: Spent round does not fully eject and is often seen standing upright in the ejection port appearing like a stovepipe. # Double feed: Spent or unspent round remains in chamber while another round also tries to load into same space. =Instinct drills= Up until the mid-1980s, standard police trainers taught sight- picture shooting at all but contact distances. With the dissemination of the concept of instinct shooting with a handgun, described and explained in Chuck Klein's 1986 book, Instinct Combat Shooting, Defensive Handgunning for Police, the method began to be accepted by the police trainers. Though William E. Fairbairn, Sergeant Eric A. Sykes and Jeff Cooper touted the advantages of sightless shooting at close quarter distances, they did not explain how it was achieved, which was Chuck Klein's contribution. Instinct shooting requires the same eye, hand, and mind events as throwing a baseball or darts. The shooter must devote full attention on the smallest part of the target whilst drawing the weapon to fire. Once the weapon is at the ready, the shooter must fire immediately, to avoid losing the intense focus and missing the target. This technique is most often practiced with a moving target, such as clay birds. The practical use of this drill is for life or death situations, in which the gun handler must instinctively and accurately shoot the target, or die himself. The shooter must almost simultaneously: * See the target * Decide to shoot * Start moving the gun to position * Focus on a small part of the target * Pull the trigger the instant the weapon reaches position See also *Gun fu *Pistol-whipping *Buttstroke *World War II combatives References External links *USPSA, United States Practical Shooting Association *IDPA International Defensive Pistol Association *ICPS Israeli Combat Pistol Shooting *IPSC Classifier CM 99-11, El Presidente, setup and scoring sheet *Rob Leatham discusses IPSC El Presidente times and strategy Shooting sports North American martial arts European martial arts ","title":"Combat pistol shooting"},{"id":"1382500","text":"The Ewart Park Phase refers to a period of the later Bronze Age Britain. Samples of weapons It is named after a founder's hoard discovered in Ewart Park in Northumberland and is the twelfth in a sequence of industrial stages that cover the period 3000 BC to 600 BC. The Ewart Park phase dates from 800 to 700 BC, preceded by the Wilburton complex in the south and the Wallington complex and Poldar phase in the north. There are several regional sub groups including the Carp's Tongue complex in the south east, the Llantwit-Stogursey tradition in south Wales, the Broadward complex in the Welsh Marches, the Heathery Burn tradition in the north and the Scottish Duddington, Covesea, and Ballimore traditions. The Irish parallel is the Dowris Phase. Alloying metal with lead became a common practice during the period and numerous hoards date to this period. In common with the continental Hallstatt culture, horse harnesses and vehicle fittings were developed and links with the late Urnfield Culture and Hallstatt early C are apparent. Recently, the Ewart Park Phase, and related Atlantic phases, have come to be seen as the probable point of origin of some developments in metalwork, that then spread widely across inland continental Europe. This reverses the previously assumed direction of travel. The types concerned include swords, winged chapes and buckets.Koch, John T., p. 9 in: Gosden, Christopher, Crawford, Sally, Ulmschneider, Katharina, Celtic Art in Europe: Making Connections, 2014, Oxbow Books, , 9781782976585, google books Ewart Park Sword According to the Portable Antiquities Scheme: \\"Most Bronze Age swords in museum collections in Britain come from the Ewart Park Phase. Generally these swords have a bulging shape in the blade at the midway point before narrowing towards the shoulders and the terminal which is fan shaped. Size and number of rivets vary greatly. These swords developed from the Wilburton swords with little influence from the continent and it appears they first occurred in Northern Britain.\\" The Ewart Park phase was succeeded by the Llyn Fawr Phase which is parallel to Hallstatt C proper.

The population taken at the 2011 Census was less than 100. Details are maintained in the parish of Walworth. It is associated with an abandoned village site under pasture and farm buildings, and situated a short distance to the north- west of Darlington. The lost settlement was in existence by the early 15th century, and remained inhabited at least until the 1890s. There was a moated manor house at the southern end, part of which remains as the Old Hall, now a barn. At the north end of the site was the chapel, and in the middle were tofts and enclosures, with a ridge and furrow field and a trackway leading to the south-east. The site of the abandoned village is now a scheduled monument and the Old Hall is a listed building. Geographical and political Townend Farm The underlying composition here is of glacial clay with pockets of gravel, sand, peat and alluvium, and patches of dolomite and carboniferous limestone. This is a small hamlet incorporating Hall Farm, Garthorne Farm and Townend Farm on an approach road south of Newton Lane. It is the focus of the parish of Archdeacon Newton rural ward, and its councillor is Rosalind Tweddle. It is situated on flat land to the north-west of the Branksome suburb of Darlington, and to the north-west of the A1 road. At Cockerton near the southern end of Newton Lane and to the south-east of the hamlet is its namesake, the Archdeacon pub; Michael Perry, Archdeacon of Durham, posed for the sign in 1980, although the sign has since been replaced. History The hamlet apparently once contained a chapel; it now a parish of ,1856‚Äì1865 map, on Keys to the Past site although it was once part of Darlington parish. The area enclosed by Townend Farm and Archdeacon Newton's approach road to the west, Newton Lane to the north, and Hall Farm to the south contains the site of a medieval abandoned village, with visible earthworks in pasture at the northern end and farm buildings at the southern end of the site: this is a scheduled monument. The hamlet's name derives from the fact that in the Middle Ages the Archdeacon of Durham founded and built what is now the abandoned village. An alternative theory says that the land was leased from the archdeacon. Around 1800, Hilton \\"High Price\\" Middleton of Archdeacon Newton bred a great Durham Ox, and the now-defunct Newton Kyloe pub at Cockerton Green was named after it. In 1894 the land was owned by the Church Commissioners and the population was 52; down from its highest level of 72 in 1801, when pews were reserved for Archdeacon Newton people at St Cuthbert's in the centre of Darlington, and Methodist prayers were said in a farmhouse kitchen. This was before the nearer church of Holy Trinity, Darlington, was built in 1836. The 1851 census shows residents with surnames of Brown and Geldart or Geldert. =Archaeological sites and finds= The manor of this village survives at Hall Farm as a farm building with some medieval features, and an adjacent farm building was probably once an early 16th-century house. Apart from these buildings, the abandoned village is indicated by earthworks of a medieval moated site and enclosures. There are also indications of three fish ponds, of which one is still a duck pond, and two contain rubbish; however it is now thought that there was originally a single fish pond. One of the supposed fish ponds is among the farm buildings and is overgrown. Prehistoric and Roman remains have not yet been found here, as there have been no excavations as of April 2010. Abandoned settlement The area to the east of the Archdeacon Newton approach road, and to the south of Newton Lane, is the location of the medieval abandoned village and scheduled monument. The manor and house were at the southern end of a settlement which had three farms and a row of cottages, indicated in the existing pasture by house platforms. It is now thought that the buildings were tenant tofts attached to the manor, and not a nucleated village. Cobbled banks and ditches running east to west and situated towards the north end of the site identify the original enclosures of these tofts. The banks are wide and high, and the ditches are wide and deep. There is an associated ridge and furrow field, and a wide trackway runs from halfway along the east side of the site, in a south- easterly direction, for as far as a modern fence. An undated trench for electricity supply was dug at Hall Farm at the southern end of the hamlet's approach road, surveyed by an archaeological watching brief, but nothing of historical interest was found. Old Hall and moated site Hall Farm with Old Hall to its right The Old Hall, one of the farm buildings at the centre of Hall Farm, is a surviving medieval domestic building or manor house, probably dating from the 14th century and remodelled in the 16th and 17th century. It was burned and then re-roofed in the early 21st century, and no internal partitions survive. This is a two-storey listed building which was converted to a barn in the 19th century, has a Welsh slate roof and seven internal bays. It is built of squared and rubble masonry with ashlar dressing. The structure includes medieval and Tudor carved stone, including mullions and fireplaces. Buttresses, broken arches and fireplaces of the manor are still standing and are incorporated in the Old Hall. It is by , containing two Tudor fireplaces, with the remains of archways on the outside walls at each end. The moated manor house stood at the southern end of the abandoned village site, where there are now farm buildings. In the 16th and 17th centuries the manor had a hall with parlour and chamber over the hall, a new chamber, a little chamber, a \\"lofte beneath the doors\\", a buttery, a kitchen and a stable. Depressions in the ground at the southern end of the site indicate the position of the original moat. Chapel It is thought that the chapel was on the high triangular platform at the north end of the site and on the south side of Newton Lane. There is a ditch along the south side of this feature. Evidence for the chapel exists in a licence given in 1414 to Robert Fisher, John Nicholson and John Deves to hold religious services in a chapel at Archdeacon Newton. Enclosure Another enclosure has been identified by aerial photography north-west of the hamlet, and on the south side of Newton Lane.

(July 23, 1822 ‚Äì February 12, 1897) was an American soldier, businessman, and naturalist. He served as a career U.S. Army officer during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, the Second Seminole War, and as a general officer in the Union Army during the American Civil War. During the Civil War, Couch fought notably in the Peninsula and Fredericksburg campaigns of 1862, and the Chancellorsville and Gettysburg campaigns of 1863. He rose to command a corps in the Army of the Potomac, and led divisions in both the Eastern Theater and Western Theater. Militia under his command played a strategic role during the Gettysburg Campaign in delaying the advance of Confederate troops of the Army of Northern Virginia and preventing their crossing the Susquehanna River, critical to Pennsylvania's defense. He has been described as personally courageous, very thin in build, and (after his time in Mexico) frail of health.Gambone, Major-General Darius Nash Couch, p. 51. Early life and career CouchThe correct pronunciation is \\"couch\\", not \\"coach\\", according to biographer Gambone, Major-General Darius Nash Couch, p. 1 footnote reads \\"According to family members, the proper pronunciation is Couch as in Ouch, not Cooch as is sometimes suggested. was born in 1822 on a farm in the village of Southeast in Putnam County, New York, and was educated at the local schools there.Warner, Generals in Blue, p. 95. In 1842 he entered the United States Military Academy at West Point, graduating four years later 13th out of 59 cadets. On July 1, 1846, Couch was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant and was assigned to the 4th U.S. Artillery.Eicher, Civil War High Commands, p. 186. Fort Johnston in March 2008; Couch was stationed there in 1851 and 1852. Couch then saw action with the U.S. Army during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, most notably in the Battle of Buena Vista on February 22‚Äì23, 1847. For his actions on the second day of this fight, he was brevetted a first lieutenant for \\"gallant and meritorious conduct.\\" After the war ended in 1848 Couch began serving in garrison duty at Fort Monroe in Hampton, Virginia. The following year he was stationed at Fort Pickens, located near Pensacola, Florida, and then in Key West. Couch next participated in the Seminole Wars during 1849 and into 1850. Returning to garrison duty, later that year Couch was sent to Fort Columbus in New York Harbor, and in 1851 Couch was involved in recruiting at Jefferson Barracks located on the Mississippi River at Lemay, Missouri. Later in 1851 he returned to Fort Columbus, and then was ordered to Fort Johnston in Southport, North Carolina, staying there into 1852, and next in garrison at Fort Mifflin in Philadelphia until 1853. Couch then took a one-year leave of absence from the army from 1853 to 1854 to conduct a scientific mission for the Smithsonian Institution in northern Mexico. There, he discovered the species that were known as Couch's kingbird and Couch's spadefoot toad.Heidler, Encyclopedia of the American Civil War, p. 505. Upon his return to the United States in 1854, Couch was ordered to Washington, D.C., on detached service. Later that year he resumed garrison duty in Fort Independence at Castle Island along Boston Harbor, Massachusetts. Also in 1854 he was stationed at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and would remain there into the following year. On April 30, 1855, Couch resigned his commission in the U.S. Army. From 1855 to 1857 he was a merchant in New York City. He then moved to Taunton, Massachusetts, and worked as a copper fabricator in the company owned by his wife's family. Couch was still working in Taunton when the American Civil War began in 1861. American Civil War service Darius Couch as a major general in the Union Army =Early service= At the outbreak of the Civil War, Couch was appointed commander of the 7th Massachusetts Infantry on June 15, 1861, with the rank of colonel in the Union Army. That August he was promoted to brigadier general with an effective date back to May 17. He was given brigade command in the Military Division then Army of the Potomac that fall, and Couch was given divisional command in the VI Corps in the following spring.Dupuy, Harper Encyclopedia of Military Biography, p. 194 From July 1861 to March 1862 he helped train and then maintain the defenses of Washington, D.C.. He participated in the Peninsula Campaign, fighting in the Siege of Yorktown on April 5‚ÄìMay 4 and the Battle of Williamsburg the following day. =Seven Pines= Map of 1862's Battle of Seven Pines Couch led his division during the Battle of Seven Pines on May 31 and June 1, 1862. In this engagement his corps commander, Brig. Gen. Erasmus D. Keyes, ordered Couch's division and that of Brig. Gen. Silas Casey forward of the Union defensive line, Couch's men right behind those of Casey. This placed the IV Corps in an isolated position, vulnerable to attack on three sides; however poorly coordinated Confederate movements allowed Couch and Casey to partially prepare entrenchments for impending the assault. As the fighting continued throughout May 31 both Couch and Casey were slowly driven back, with their right flank units in the most peril. At this time Couch counterattacked with his old 7th Massachusetts Infantry and the 62nd New York Infantry in an attempt to bolster that side, however he did not succeed and was forced back, as was the rest of the Union IV Corps by nightfall.Eicher, Longest Night, pp. 276‚Äì78. Couch continued to lead his division during the 1862 Seven Days Battles that followed, fighting in the Battle of Oak Grove on June 25 and the Battle of Malvern Hill on July 1. Later in July Couch's health began to fail, prompting him to offer his resignation. The army commander, Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan, refused to send it to the U.S. War Department, and instead Couch was promoted to major general, to date from July 4. Couch was involved in the Maryland Campaign that fall, although absent from the Battle of Antietam on September 17.Aztec Club of 1847 site biography of Couch; Warner, Generals in Blue, p. 95Dupuy, Harper Encyclopedia of Military Biography, p. 194. =Fredericksburg= II Army Corps attacks during the 1862 Battle of Fredericksburg On November 14, 1862, Couch was assigned command of the II Corps, and he led it during the Battle of Fredericksburg as part of Maj. Gen. Edwin V. Sumner's \\"Right Grand Division\\". In this fight Couch's corps contained three divisions, led by Brig. Gens. Winfield Scott Hancock, Oliver Otis Howard, and William H. French.Eicher, Longest Night, p, 396. Early on December 12 infantry from his corps attempted to support the Union engineers' efforts to lay pontoon bridges across the Rappahannock River and into the town. When Confederate fire repeatedly prevented this, and a heavy artillery bombardment failed as well, the decision was made to send small groups of soldiers in pontoon boats across to dislodge the defenders. This amphibious assault was executed by one of Couch's brigades under Col. Norman J. Hall (3rd Brigade, 2nd Division ‚Äì 19th & 20th Massachusetts, 7th Michigan, 42nd & 59th New York, & 127th Pennsylvania) which finally succeeded in driving out the Confederates.Catton, Army of the Potomac: Glory Road, pp. 35‚Äì39. As the Union soldiers entered a smoldering Fredericksburg they began to sack the city, forcing Couch to order his provost guard to the bridges and collect the loot. The next day his corps was ordered to attack the Confederate position at the base of Marye's Heights above Fredericksburg. To better watch his men's progress Couch entered the town's courthouse and climbed its cupola, where he could see French's division advancing. As they approached the Confederate defenses, Couch could see his men taking very heavy fire and easily repulsed, described \\"as if the division had simply vanished.\\" Hancock's division followed that of French, meeting the same fate with high casualties as well. Howard, who was to go in next, was with Couch as Hancock's division attacked. Briefly through the smoke they could see the mounting casualties, and Couch reportedly said \\"Oh, great God! See how our men, our poor fellows, are falling.\\"Catton, Army of the Potomac: Glory Road, pp. 42, 50, 53, 55‚Äì56. Couch ordered Howard to march his division toward the right and possibly flank the Confederate defenses his other two divisions had failed to dislodge. However the terrain did not permit any force marching from Fredericksburg towards Marye's Heights to attack anywhere other than at the stone wall along its base. When Howard's men attacked they were crowded back to the left, meeting the same resistance and were repulsed. As other Union soldiers followed the II Corps in, Couch ordered his artillery to move into the field and blast the Confederates at close range. When his own artillery chief protested exposing the gun crews in this fashion, Couch stated that he agreed but it was necessary to slow the Confederate fire in some way. The cannon stopped about 150 yards from the stone wall and opened fire, but quickly lost most of their crews and did little to slacken the enemy fire. During this Couch moved slowly along his line of men, who were on the ground firing as best they could until nightfall.Catton, Army of the Potomac: Glory Road, pp. 56, 58‚Äì59. Recounting the attack on the heights on December 13, Couch wrote after the war: In the attack Couch's force suffered heavily, as did the rest of the Right Grand Division. He reported the II Corps sustained over four thousand casualties during the Fredericksburg Campaign. French's division lost an estimated 1,200 soldiers and Hancock around 2,000. Howard lost about 850 men, 150 of which were hit on December 11 supporting the engineers at the river. That night the Union wounded remained in the field, and Couch wrote after the war what he saw: \\"It was a night of dreadful suffering. Many died of wounds & exposure, and as fast as men died they stiffened in the wintry air, & on the front line were rolled forward for protection to the living. Frozen men were placed for dumb sentries.\\" =Chancellorsville= Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws in the morning of May 3, 1863, during the Battle of Chancellorsville Following the Union defeat at Fredericksburg and the inglorious Mud March in January 1863, the commander of the Army of the Potomac‚ÄîCouch's immediate superior‚Äîwas again replaced. Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside was relieved and Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker named to his place. Hooker reorganized the army and drew up plans for a new campaign against the Army of Northern Virginia. He wished to avoid attacking the Confederate defenses at Fredericksburg and flank them out of position, thereby fighting on more open ground. After the reorganization Couch continued to lead the II Corps, with his divisions commanded by Hancock and French (both now major generals) and Brig. Gen. John Gibbon at the head of Howard's former division, a total of about 17,000 soldiers.Eicher, Longest Night, pp. 473‚Äì74, 475. During the ensuing Chancellorsville Campaign Couch was the senior corps commander, making him Hooker's second-in-command. In late April, Hooker began moving his corps across the Rappahannock and Rapidan Rivers, ordering two of Couch's divisions to entrench and defend the Banks's Ford crossing of the Rappahannock and detach Gibbon's 5,000 men to remain at the Union camp back at Falmouth on April 29. The following day Couch had cleared the ford and was marching toward Chancellorsville. In the afternoon of May 1 Hooker‚Äînormally quite aggressive‚Äîcautiously slowed his marching army, and soon he stopped their movement altogether, despite some success against the Confederates and the loud protests of his corps commanders. Couch sent Hancock's division to bolster the Union men already engaged and informed Hooker they could handle the enemy in front of them. However, Hooker's orders stood; march back into the positions they held the previous day and assume a defensive posture. Couch complied and ordered Hancock's division to form a rear guard as they withdrew. As Hancock formed his men, Couch could see Confederate artillery aiming for the massed Union columns, and he told his staff \\"Let us draw their fire.\\" The group of mounted officers clustered around a clearing where the enemy cannon could easily view them, thus attracting their fire and sparing the marching infantry; Couch and his staff also went unharmed. By nightfall the Union soldiers were busy fortifying the ground. Couch formed his divisions behind the XII Corps in roughly the center of Hooker's line.Eicher, Longest Night, p. 475, 476, 478Catton, Army of the Potomac: Glory Road, pp. 168‚Äì169. By late afternoon on May 2, Hooker's line was hit on the right (the XI Corps led by Howard) by Confederates under Lt. Gen. Thomas Jonathan \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson, and despite resisting the XI Corps was routed and ran toward Chancellorsville. The remaining corps tightened into a \\"U\\" shaped formation by May 3, and Confederate artillery began shelling their positions, including Couch's men. At about 9 a.m. that day Hooker was stunned by enemy fire when a shell hit the pillar he was leaning on, temporarily incapacitating him within an hour. At that time Hooker turned command of the army over to Couch, and through consulting with a \\"groggy\\" Hooker it was decided to withdraw the army to defensive lines to the north, with the other commanders (except an embarrassed Howard) strongly advocating an attack instead.Fredriksen, Civil War Almanac, pp. 287‚Äì293; Eicher, Longest Night, pp. 485‚Äì486. =Gettysburg= Couch requested reassignment after quarreling with Hooker. President Abraham Lincoln offered him command of the Army of the Potomac, but he declined, citing poor health. He commanded the newly created Department of the Susquehanna during the Gettysburg Campaign in 1863.Gambone, Major-General Darius Nash Couch, pp. 137‚Äì38. Fort Couch in Lemoyne, Pennsylvania, was constructed under his direction and was named in his honor. Assigned to protect Harrisburg from a threatened attack by Confederates under Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell, Couch directed militia from his department to skirmish with enemy cavalry elements at Sporting Hill, one of the war's northernmost engagements.Gambone, Major- General Darius Nash Couch, p. 170. Couch's militia then joined pursuing Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia into Maryland after the Battle of Gettysburg. =Subsequent activities= Confederates again invaded Couch's Department of the Susquehanna in August 1864, as Brig. Gen. John McCausland burned the town of Chambersburg.Gambone, Major-General Darius Nash Couch, pp. 208‚Äì209. In December, Couch returned to the front lines with an assignment to the Western Theater, where he commanded a division in the XXIII Corps of the Army of the Ohio in the Franklin-Nashville Campaign and for the remainder of the war. Couch finished his military service after the Carolinas Campaign in 1865. Postbellum career and death Mount Pleasant Cemetery Couch returned to civilian life in Taunton after the war, where he ran unsuccessfully as a Democratic candidate for Governor of Massachusetts in 1865. He later briefly served as president of a mining company in West Virginia. Couch moved to Connecticut in 1871, where he served as the Quartermaster General, and then Adjutant General, for the state militia until 1884. In 1888 he joined the Aztec Club of 1847 by right of his service in the Mexican War. He also joined the Connecticut Society of the Sons of the American Revolution in 1890. He died in Norwalk, Connecticut. He was buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery in Taunton. Legacy According to Herman Hattaway and Michael D. Smith: :Couch is best remembered as an able division and corps commander in the Army of the Potomac. His career occasionally was marred by personal traits of impatience and temper directed at both subordinates and superiors. He also suffered from prolonged bouts of ill health, which led to his acceptance of the post of department commander.Herman Hattaway and Michael D. Smith, \\"Couch, Darius Nash\\" in American National Biography (2000) https://doi.org/10.1093/anb/9780198606697.article.0400270 In 2017, General Couch's portrait was featured on a mural in Lemoyne, Pennsylvania in commemoration of the defenses mounted in the town under his name during the Gettysburg campaign. The fort served as the last line of defense for Pennsylvania' capital city of Harrisburg. Couch is commemorated in the scientific names of two species of reptiles: Sceloporus couchii and Thamnophis couchiiBeolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (\\"Couch\\", p. 60)., and one frog: Scaphiopus couchii. He also has one bird species named for him: Couch's Kingbird.

It is located on Kurf√ºrstendamm boulevard in the central Charlottenburg quarter of Berlin, among a mix of chain and high end shopping facilities. History Uhlandstra√üe station, 1937 The station opened on October 12, 1913 at the intersection of Kurf√ºrstendamm and Uhlandstra√üe, named after the poet Ludwig Uhland. Built according to plans designed by Alfred Grenander it was meant as the first section of a projected metro line connecting Wittenbergplatz with Berlin-Halensee station which, however, was never built. Damaged by the bombing of Berlin in World War II, the station was closed briefly in 1945; it again went out of service for four years from 1957, because of the construction of the neighbouring Kurf√ºrstendamm underground station. From 1970, trains only went to Wittenbergplatz station ( length) but since 1993 trains are going to Warschauer Stra√üe station again.J. Meyer-Kronthaler, Berlins U-Bahnh√∂fe, Berlin: be.bra, 1996 The second entrance at the eastern end of the station, at the junction of Kurf√ºrstendamm and Fasanenstra√üe, was closed in 1964, but re-opened in 2005. Platform Up to today, the area is somewhat reminiscent of the period of promoterism (Gr√ºnderzeit) and the Wirtschaftswunder days of the 1950s. Quiet, green roads with mostly expensive flats make the area one of the most desirable but unaffordable in Berlin, comparable for instance to the area between Westminster and Kensington in London.

The 34 mentions appear in sentences such as \\"'A Bulgari necklace in the hand is worth two in the bush', said Doris\\" or \\"They snuggled together happily for a bit, all passion spent; and she met him at Bulgari that lunchtime\\". Such heavy use of product placement was not only a novelty in literature but also unprecedented for a published, established author (The Bulgari Connection was her 23rd novel), and a front-page article was published about it in the New York Times, quoting such writers as Rick Moody, J. G. Ballard, Michael Chabon, and Jeanette Winterson.

A half mile walk to the West through part of the adjacent industrial estate will bring you to the Locomotion One, which shut down in 2017 due to low demand, another former pub, which is located on the line of the original Stockton and Darlington Railway. The village also features a large industrial estate, which connects the village to nearby town Newton Aycliffe. The industrial estate features many buildings dating back to World War 2. One building, which now goes by the name of ROF 59, was originally a factory where bombs were made, and many of the original WW2 memorabilia can be seen within the building. Current Today's Aycliffe Village is a mixture of cottages, old houses and new builds. On the whole, its architecture is varied with some houses dating back several hundred years to a small amount of relatively new-build properties.

They live in the Thai-Malay Peninsula, on Sumatra, Borneo, Java and smaller nearby islands. Besides surili, the common names for the monkeys in the genus also sometimes use the terms \\"langur\\" or \\"leaf monkey.\\" Surilis are rather small, slimly built primates. Their fur at the top is brown, grey, black, or orange, and at the lower surface whitish or greyish, sometimes also orange, with some species having fur designs at the head or at the hips.Novak, R. M. (1999). Walker's Mammals of the World. 6th edition. Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore. Rowe, N. (1996). The Pictorial Guide to the Living Primates. Pogonias Press, Rhode Island. Their German name of M√ºtzenlanguren (\\"capped langurs\\") comes from the hair on their head, which forms a tuft. They differ from the other langurs by characteristics in the shape of their head (particularly the poorly developed or absent brow ridges, and the prominent nasal bones), in the teeth, and by the size of their small thumbs. Surilis range in adult length from 40 to 60 cm (with a 50- to 85-cm- long tail) and a weight of 5 to 8 kg. Diurnal forest dwellers, they spend nearly their entire lives in the trees. They live in groups of up to 21 animals (typically 10 or fewer animals in most species) consisting of a male, several females, and their young. A few species have been observed in monogamous pairings (particularly the Mentawai langur), although this might be a reaction to the decrease of their habitat. Lone males and all-male groups have also been reported. The groups are hierarchically developed, with intergroup communication that is both vocal and postural. The surilis' diet consists of leaves, fruits, and seeds. Gestation time is 5‚Äì6 months, and births are typically of single young. Newborn animals are white colored and have a black strip at the back, although some have a cross-shaped mark. By one year old, the young are weaned and at an age of 4‚Äì5 years, they are fully mature. The typical life expectancy in the wild remains poorly known for most species, but captive Sumatran surilis have lived more than 18 years. Several species in this genus are restricted to regions with extensive habitat destruction, and are also threatened by hunting. Consequently, eight of the 11 species are rated as vulnerable or worse by IUCN,IUCN (2008). 2008 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

His next record, a remake of his 1960 debut song \\"Tribute to Buddy Holly\\", hit No. 2 in October of that same year. In 1977, \\"I'm A Rocker,\\" released on Flemish record label Scramble Records (owned by Radio Mi Amigo DJ Norbert), failed to chart. In 1980, he had a chart success in the UK, with \\"The Sunshine of Your Smile,\\" a cover version of a romantic song which was produced by Chas Hodges; this had originally been written before the First World War and recorded by Jessie Broughton in about 1915. In 1985, his song \\"Everyone's A Wally\\" was included as the b-side to the video game by Mikro-Gen of the same name. His most recent CD was About Time Too!, recorded in Nashville, Tennessee with The Crickets.

McGlinchey was one of 11 siblings born into a staunchly republican family from Bellaghy, County Londonderry. In 1971 he was interned without charge for ten months in Long Kesh; not long after his release the following year, he was imprisoned again on arms charges. During his imprisonment, he married his wife Mary in 1975; she was to become as ruthless an operator as McGlinchey. Together they had three children. After his release, McGlinchey joined Ian Milne and future Provisional IRA hunger strikers Francis Hughes and Thomas McElwee, and waged a campaign of shooting and bombing throughout the county and beyond. Together, they later joined the Provisional IRA. The gang spent the late 1970s on the run, carrying out operations and evading both the British Army and the Garda S√≠och√°na. The latter force arrested McGlinchey in the Republic of Ireland in 1977. He was convicted of hijacking a police vehicle and threatening officers with a gun. In 1982, while serving his sentence in Portlaoise Prison, he clashed with the prison's IRA leadership and was either expelled by them for indiscipline or left the due to strategic differences. Following his departure from the IRA, McGlinchey joined the recently founded INLA. Following his release, due to his experience, he rose through the ranks, becoming chief of staff by 1982. Under McGlinchey, the INLA, which had previously had a reputation for disorganisation, became extremely active in cross-border assassinations and bombings. These included many individual assassinations and woundings, but also massacres such as the Droppin Well bombing of 1982 in which both civilians and soldiers died. There were failed operations, and McGlinchey‚Äîwho believed that this was the result of an informer in the ranks‚Äîdevoted much time and energy to finding the cause. Those suspected of betraying the organisation were treated brutally, often by McGlinchey personally. As a result of this resurgence of activity and McGlinchey's high profile, the press nicknamed him \\"Mad Dog\\". Under his tenure the Darkley massacre was carried out, ostensibly by another group but using a weapon supplied by McGlinchey. In late 1983, McGlinchey‚Äîstill on the run‚Äîgave an interview with the Sunday Tribune newspaper in which he condemned the Darkley killings but also laid out his political philosophy and plans for the future. By 1984 McGlinchey had fallen out with members of a powerful Republican family from South Armagh over what he considered missing funds. Men loyal to this family were subsequently killed by McGlinchey's unit, which included his wife. In March the same year, he was captured in County Clare following a gunfight with the Garda√≠. At this time, McGlinchey was wanted in the north for the shooting of an elderly woman, but republicans had traditionally been able to avoid extradition by claiming their offences were political. The bloody war in the north was leading the Republic to re-evaluate its position, however, and McGlinchey became the first Republican to be extradited to Northern Ireland. Although convicted and sentenced there to life imprisonment, this was overturned in 1985. As a result, McGlinchey was returned to the Republic, where he was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment on firearms charges. While he was incarcerated, his wife was shot dead at her Dundalk home. McGlinchey was released in March 1993 and, claiming to have no further involvement with the INLA, moved to Drogheda. He survived an assassination attempt soon after his release from prison, but in February 1994 his enemies caught up with him, and he was shot to death in front of one of his children while using a public phone. Although his and his wife's killers have never been found, they have generally been linked to the deaths of the Armagh men years before. McGlinchey's posthumous reputation has ranged from being a \\"psycho\\" to his enemies to being an inspiration to those who followed him. Commentators have speculated on what he would have contributed to Irish politics had he lived. Some have suggested that he would have contributed to the Northern Ireland peace process, while others have argued that dissident republicans, opposed to that process, would have found him a willing rallying point. McGlinchey has remained an influence on Irish fiction and music, with both Edna O'Brien and Martin McDonagh producing acclaimed pieces based on McGlinchey's life and career. He has also featured in popular songs. Background The IRA's last campaign in Northern Ireland, which was called off in 1962, had failed to make an impact on either the government or nationalist consciousness, and contributed towards the organisation's move towards Marxist politics. Since Northern Ireland's creation in 1922, the Catholic minority had suffered from varying degrees of discrimination from the Protestant and Unionist majority. By the middle of the decade, there was a growing popular, peaceful campaign for civil rights for Catholics. The Northern Ireland government accused the campaign of being a front for republicanism and communism, and indeed the IRA had infiltrated it from its foundation. Within a few years, the tension this created between the two sides had descended into violence, and the IRA attempted to position itself as the defenders of the Catholics. However, in 1969, the IRA split into two separate factions. These were the 'Provisional' and 'Official' groups. In 1972, the latter had called a ceasefire and embraced non-violent civil agitation, while the new Provisional IRA had intensified its armed campaign against British forces. Two years later, the Officials expelled Seamus Costello, its Operations Officer for what it termed \\"factional activity\\". Costello, dissatisfied with the leadership's group's rejection of armed struggle, proceeded to found a new organisation. This group, he intended, would fight the British as the Provisionals did, yet promote the Marxist politics of the Officials. The INLA, and its political wing, the IRSP, was founded on 8 December 1974 in the Spa Hotel in Lucan, Dublin. The Officials, comments the journalist Liam Clarke, made a \\"determined effort to strangle the breakaway INLA at birth\\". A bloody feud soon broke out between the groups in Belfast which killed six men. Costello had fought in the Border campaign in south County Londonderry \\"and his reputation still carried weight in the area; his new organisation had no difficulty in winning recruits from the Officials\\", suggest Holland and McDonald. By 1977, the area's almost entire Official IRA membership had joined them. Founder members included Jimmy Brown, Tom McCartan, Gino Gallagher, Dessie O'Hare, John \\"Jap\\" O‚ÄôReilly, Gerard \\"Sparky\\" Barkley and Gerard \\"Dr Death\\" Steenson, most of whom McGlinchey would fight with over the next decade. Early life Dominic McGlinchey was born in 1954, in the family home in Ballyscullion Road, Bellaghy, in rural south Londonderry. He was the third of eleven children in a staunchly republican family. His father owned a garage; some of his father's police customers would later die at McGlinchey's hands. His mother Monica was a devout Catholic. McGlinchey had seven brothers and four sisters. Educated at the local school, he was a bright child, although not outstandingly so, classmates later said. When he was 16 he began an apprenticeship in his father's garage. About this time he was joining the numerous civil rights marches that were taking place in the county. His precise reasons for doing so are unclear, but Dillon speculates that \\"he was reacting to events around him and the idea of participating in marches offered glamour and a close identification with his own community\\". = Internment and Irish republicanism = In August 1971 the British army launched Operation Demetrius, which involved the mass arrest and of 342 people suspected of being involved with the IRA. McGlinchey was one of those interned as a result, interrupting his fledgeling career as a car mechanic. He spent five days being interrogated in Shackleton Barracks; like his fellow internees, he had no access to either family or legal representation. He was then transferred to Magilligan Prison, and later Long Kesh. There he met IRA veterans from the Border campaign, some of whom ran classes in left-wing politics‚Äîbased on the writings of Marx and James Connolly‚Äîas well as military tactics. One man imprisoned with McGlinchey later recalled him as \\"a big kid out of his depth\\" who possessed only a limited knowledge of republican history and ideology. Released in either May or June 1972, his experience appears to have been the catalyst for him to join the physical force movement. that Coming from a deeply republican area‚Äîthe failed Border Campaign still a fresh memory‚Äîhis background gave him \\"first-class\\" republican credentials. For those intending to follow such a path, there was still a choice to be had between joining the Official or the Provisional IRAs; McGlinchey chose neither. Instead, he joined with Francis Hughes‚Äîa childhood friend‚ÄîIan Milne and Tom McElwee, and together they formed their own informal unit. McGlinchey later explained their rationale for doing so during what he called \\"that colourful period\\": \\"You meet fellows who now say they had a political philosophy but they had not. You just went out and did it. When I was doing that at the start. I had no idea I was reacting against the State.\\" The choice of McGlinchey and Hughes to join the Provisionals was probably, Dillon speculates, based on its local image. Particularly in the clubs and bars McGlinchey frequented, \\"young Provisionals quickly acquired a hero- worship status\\", and the movement was rooted in the same romantic nationalism that he had grown up with. Having joined the IRA's South Derry Brigade, he almost immediately went on the run. Often going south for days or weeks at a time, he was able to avoid immediate re-internment. His training, McGlinchey claimed, was rudimentary, later saying \\"I just picked it up as I went along\\". Although he occasionally attended IRA training camps with Hughes‚Äîwho showed an innate aptitude for marksmanship‚ÄîMcGlinchey's skills were in organising and logistics. McGlinchey was arrested in 1973 for possession of guns, for which he received 18 months imprisonment. Back in Long Kesh, he recommenced his studies in politics and history. This time the class leaders were not old Border campaigners, but relatively young Provisionals. During the period of his incarceration, the external leadership were in secret negotiations with the British government and was considering a ceasefire. McGlinchey did not approve, telling Hughes that he felt that there was an element within the Army Council that was insufficiently committed to the armed struggle. IRA career On his release from Long Kesh McGlinchey was appointed \\"Double O\\"‚ÄîOperations Officer‚Äîfor the region, and lived on the run for the next three years. This promotion, says Dillon, now allowed him to select his own targets. Reuniting with Hughes and the others, he told them that he would not become an \\"armchair general\\" and would continue to take part in their operations. They carried out frequent and brutal attacks on the British Army. Their activities, says the author Tim Pat Coogan, became the stuff of legend. Such was their impact, says David Beresford in his book Ten Men Dead‚Äîgiving the example of their murders of Constables John McCracken and Keneth Sheehan in Magherafelt on 8 April 1977‚Äîthat the Royal Ulster Constabulary issued wanted posters of McGlinchey and the others. These posters‚Äîdescribed by later writers as \\"an unprecedented step\\" and \\"a desperate attempt to elicit public support\\"‚Äîlisted at length the bombings, shootings and deaths the men were wanted for. According to McGlinchey, the trio expanded their theatre of operations‚Äî\\"we didn't confine ourselves to South Derry\\", he said‚Äîafter the IRA's failed 1974 ceasefire. Their activities included bombing barracks (for example, Magherafelt and Toomebridge), towns (including Killalea, Maghera and Ballymena), as well as killing RUC and UDR men. He particularly favoured those of the latter who lived in isolated, exposed houses, as this made them particularly vulnerable. The towns and police stations he targeted were always in strongly nationalist towns, as he felt that not only would the operation be popular but they would have good escape routes. McGlinchey later calculated that this amounted to over 200 operations over \\"an intricate maze of fields, lanes, country roads and ditches with which they were intimately familiar\\". They knew where to hide, how to escape, and who was sympathetic to them; the latter provided them not only with food and drink but intelligence on police and army movements. On one occasion in 1977, McGlinchey evaded the RUC in Randalstown, Antrim‚Äîthree members of which he had just shot at‚Äîwith the help of a friendly fisherman who hijacked a motorboat and ferried him across Lough Neagh to Tyrone and his escape. The author Ed Moloney interviewed an anonymous IRA man from the time who described McGlinchey's gang, as well as relations between them and the IRA leadership of Martin McGuinness and Gerry Adams. > Dominic McGlinchey, Frank Hughes, and their gang were in Donegal hiding out > for a while. They looked like mujahideen, longhaired, scruffy, heavily > armed, driving wrecks of cars. They were fed up staying in cow barns when > they heard Adams and McGuinness were on holiday in the area. They found out > where Adams was staying and turned up at his chalet, where they were > sniffily shown the door. There was no way Gerry and Colette would let that > crowd darken their door. So then they went to where McGuinness was staying. > He was annoyed and cursed them up and down, but he let them in and allowed > them to stay. In June 1973, McGlinchey's unit left a car bomb in Coleraine; six people were killed. McGlinchey was also active in internal security, particularly hunting down those he believed to be assisting the security forces. His victims included a caterer from Derry City who was employed at Fort George British Army base. In March 1977 McGlinchey was allegedly part of a gang that killed 67-year-old Hester McMullan, a retired postmistress, in Toomebridge. They had already shot and wounded her son, an RUC reservist, and she died when they then fired on her house. The IRA claimed the attack. A later commentator described how \\"the woman had been riddled with bullets during an attack on her house in the early hours of the morning, and other members of her family had narrowly escaped\\". The SAS placed patrols to intercept McGlinchey in areas their intelligence expected him to be in the north, especially along the border. On one such occasion, believing him to be drinking in a specific bar, they raided the house, firing into the ceiling. The SAS reasoned that the patrons would throw themselves to the floor‚Äîall except McGlinchey, whom they expected to reach for a weapon and return fire. However, their intelligence was erroneous; McGlinchey was elsewhere. Under McGlinchey's leadership, his area became one of the most dangerous areas of Northern Ireland for the security forces. This brought him into confrontation with the IRA leadership, to whom he regularly complained about the quality of his men's equipment (\\"units in South Armagh had 'better gear' than his teams\\", he moaned). His repeated requests for more and more powerful arms were denied. For an 18-month period between 1976 and 1977, McGlinchey's unit often cooperated with that of the local INLA, their volunteers often taking part in each other's operations. However, by the spring of 1977 the INLA in the region had suffered a number of damaging arrests. To avoid losing the IRA's best operatives to a similar fate, McGuinness ordered McGlinchey, Hughes and Milne to go to New York and stay for a while with sympathisers. This may also have been a form of exile due to their indiscipline and over-enthusiasm, as McGuinness was rarely able to control them. He also knew that their capture \\"would have been a major propaganda coup for the authorities\\". McGlinchey's stay was a lively one; while there, they were wrongly accused of a robbery, which had been committed by an Irish republican fundraiser. McGlinchey wanted to kill the man but was persuaded against it. The three men returned to Ireland soon after this episode. In 1977, following a mailvan robbery, McGlinchey was arrested in Monaghan for carjacking a Garda patrol vehicle and threatening the officer with a pistol, although McGlinchey claimed that the gun was actually a wheelbrace. He failed to make bail at Dublin's Special Criminal Court after a Garda Superintendent argued that McGlinchey would fail to attend court if bailed. McGlinchey was convicted and sent to the Republic of Ireland's maximum-security Portlaoise Prison. In the north, Hughes and Milne carried on as usual, but some veteran republicans, says Dillon, believed that they had lost an experienced advisor, and following the loss of Hughes, writes the ex- Provisional and lawyer Kieran Hughes, \\"south Derry was never the same after the break-up of the unit centred on Francis Hughes and Dominic McGlinchey\\". During McGlinchey's incarceration, suggests Dillon, he reconsidered his role as an operator. McGlinchey, he says, was aware that the amount of attention he would attract on his release would constrain his freedom of action and possibly endanger those he fought alongside. He may also have been warned by the IRA leadership that, for the same reason, he would be unable to return to a commanding role. Consequentially he appears to have considered looking for a new role in Sinn F√©in, probably to provide him with cover while organising overall strategy. But, says Dillon, \\"the more McGlinchey considered the option of a political role, the less he was enamoured of the idea\\". He suspected he would dislike taking orders from a Sinn F√©in manager, and even more so from one that \\"had never pulled a trigger\\". An anonymous ex-volunteer told Dillon that \\"the prospect of being an armchair general didn't much appeal to [McGlinchey], considering the fact that he hated armchair generals\\". D√°ith√≠ √ì Conaill 1974; originally a woodwork teacher before joining the IRA, this became a source of contempt for McGlinchey after the two men fell out in Portlaoise =Breakdown of relations with IRA= Towards the end of his term, McGlinchey fell out with the IRA's prison leadership, particularly with the ex-Vice-President of Sinn F√©in, D√°ith√≠ √ì Conaill, and the Dublin leadership generally, whom he called \\"armchair generals\\". As McGlinchey saw it, as he saw it, they were \\"sitting in the relative security of Dublin while he and Hughes were out shooting up the countryside of South Derry\\". The confrontation almost turned physical. Dillon's source told him that McGlinchey \\"was not a man to back down‚Äîthat was his nature. There was a rumour that he told O'Connell [D√°ith√≠ √ì Conaill] he was nothing but a fucking schoolteacher and an armchair general\\". This was ill-advised, says the source, as the other IRA prisoners in Portlaoise admired √ì Conaill as a \\"hero and intellectual\\". As a result, McGlinchey and the Provisional IRA parted company, and he joined the INLA. Whose decision this was, remains unclear. The IRA leadership said they expelled McGlinchey from the republican wing for indiscipline; McGlinchey, in turn, claimed the Provisionals \\"had become too soft\\". A volunteer who was inside with McGlinchey at the time later recalled how vague the information was: \\"They say that when he was in Portlaoise that he left the Provos and went to the INLA. The Provos say that he couldn't take orders, he wanted to be the big guy, so they threw him out, court-martialled him...some would say there was other stuff involved.\\" While imprisoned, McGlinchey had begun to develop his political understanding of Irish Republicanism and political philosophy, reading among other, writings by James Connolly, Frantz Fanon, Am√≠lcar Cabral, Che Guevara and the Belgian Marxist Ernst Mandel. The prisoners frequently indulged in political discussions, which expanded McGlinchey's political understanding. The development of McGlinchey's own political radicalism may also have contributed to a decision of his to leave the IRA. Whatever its origins, contemporaries believed his joining the INLA was firmly encouraged by his wife. McGlinchey maintained regular contact with the outside, and was particularly keen to recruit the last INLA chief of staff‚Äîbut who had since left the group‚Äîback into the organisation. This individual‚Äîwhose identity remains unknown‚Äîseriously considered the offer, but ultimately declined. The reporter Gavin Esler suggests that McGlinchey may have taken a number of disaffected Provisionals from the border region with him to the INLA. Move to the INLA Former police station, Bellaghy, seen in 2011. Note the concrete block to the left; Dillon writes how on one occasion, \\"in an attack on Bellaghy station, McGlinchey casually walked up to the concrete bunker outside the station and shot the policeman inside it\\". Following McGlinchey's move to the INLA, says Coogan, \\"the subsequent history of the movement is appalling\\". His defection was a \\"bitter blow\\" to McGuinness, say the latter's biographers, as he and McGlinchey had become close friends. But the INLA, argues Dillon, was the only armed group at the time \\"capable of providing McGlinchey with the action he craved\\", and for his part, McGlinchey's reputation preceded him. He was released from Portlaoise in 1982, having nearly served five years, and made an \\"immediate impact\\" on his new organisation. Immediately appointed to the General Headquarters Staff on release, he was soon given the post of director of operations, while a now-unknown Belfast man was appointed chief of staff in July. Within a short time of his release, McGlinchey had moved his family from Bellaghy to Dundalk. Here he was better situated to organise INLA operations in the Armagh-Newry-Tyrone-South Derry-South West Antrim area. McGlinchey recruited both disaffected Provisionals and new people, and (ruthlessly) put an end to the group's intermittent internal feuding. Anne Dolan, writing in the Dictionary of Irish Biography, suggests that this was one of the reasons he had been recruited by the INLA in the first place. One of his first actions in office was to contact McGuinness in Derry and attempt a rapprochement. This he saw as having‚Äîin terms of exchanging intelligence, for example‚Äîadvantages for both groups. He still respected McGuinness and when they met, McGlinchey assured him that he would not be against joint operations. McGlinchey began his INLA career \\"orchestrat[ing] a sustained bombing campaign\\" against Unionist leaders with a swathe of‚Äîalbeit unsuccessful‚Äîbomb attacks on their homes and offices. Not only did the INLA fail to hit any of its designated targets, but a number of their operations killed Catholic children, with three dying in Belfast as a result of INLA explosions in a five-month period. These were propaganda disasters for McGlinchey, and, say Holland and McDonald, \\"gave the INLA a reputation for recklessness\\". On the political front, The Times reported in May 1983 that the IRSP was considering standing McGlinchey in the East Londonderry constituency for the recently called election. Meanwhile, on McGlinchey's command, the INLA killed Jim Flynn‚Äîthought to have been responsible for assassinating Costello‚Äîin Dublin in June 1982. Chief of staff By June 1983 the INLA chief of staff, McGlinchey's Belfast man, had become unpopular with a number of important figures in the group after a bar-room argument turned ugly. At an Army Council meeting in Ardee held later that month, the Belfast man was sidelined and McGlinchey was elected. This may not have been to his choice; he was later described by those he fought with as someone who would rather rule through proxies than do so directly himself. By now the organisation was on the brink of disintegration. It had been badly hit by the supergrass Harry Kirkpatrick, with many of its best men imprisoned on his statements, and paranoia and internal suspicion were rife as a result. Jack Holland and Henry McDonald comment on the INLA's situation in the early- to mid-1980s: > When the INLA seemed on the verge of collapse, it defied all predictions. > Instead of breaking apart, it actually raised its violent campaign to levels > of bloodshed and horror never equalled before or since in the organisation‚Äôs > history. One of the reasons it was able to do so was the rise to power of a > man who became known throughout Ireland as \\"Mad Dog\\" McGlinchey. McGlinchey introduced the policy of \\"direct military rule\\" (DMR) which mandated a policy of execution for all crimes by the group's members and brought the headquarters under the direct control of the chief of staff. McGlinchey was now able to act without reference to the rest of the organisation when he chose. Dolan describes him as \\"unleash[ing] a reign of personal terror over the undisciplined organisation; opponents and suspected informers were ruthlessly purged\\", while the Lost Lives team comment that \\"in practice, [DMR] appeared to give him licence to carry out shootings without reference to the rest of the organisation\\". As a result of the free licence this policy gave McGlinchey, tensions heightened with other republicans, particularly in South Armagh. McGlinchey, says Dillon, \\"soon discovered that it was not an easy task to control some of the men under his command or to prevent what he termed 'botched operations'\\". Following a series of counter- productive actions in Belfast, McGlinchey refocussed on the rural areas, whose commanders he told to \\"pull their weight\\". =Droppin Well bombing= Following McGlinchey's criticism of the Derry Brigade's lack of activity, they devised a plan that met with his approval. The target was the Droppin Well bar in Ballykelly, where, McGlinchey was advised, soldiers from the army base regularly drank. McGlinchey instructed them to proceed with the bombing and to ensure maximum casualties. He knew, but ignored, the near-inevitability of civilian deaths. On 6 December 1982 17 people‚Äî11 soldiers of the Cheshire Regiment and six civilians‚Äîwere killed after a timebomb exploded in the middle of a disco. This brought the roof of the pub in. To McGlinchey, they‚Äîwhether Protestant or Catholic‚Äîwere fraternising with the enemy. Four of the dead were women; the INLA's subsequent claim of responsibility described them and the other injured women as \\"consorts\\". Although McGlinchey later claimed that the bar owner had received multiple warnings against serving soldiers, it is unlikely that any such warnings were given. Following the Droppin Well bombing, McGlinchey became a \\"hate figure\\": DUP MP Willie McRea called for the destruction of \\"this insane devilish brat McGlinchey\\" in the House of Commons, calling him a \\"well-known mass-murderer\\", while Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald told the Oireachtas that the bombing was a \\"blasphemous sectarian act\\". McGlinchey, already a \\"prime target\\" for British intelligence, was now called the \\"most wanted man in Ireland\\". The British Government had been attempting to persuade that of the Republic to extradite republicans to face justice in the North for many years, with no success. The Ballykelly bombing encouraged the Irish court to reconsider its position: the following day, Ireland's Supreme Court ordered McGlinchey to be extradited to Belfast in response to an earlier RUC request for McGlinchey to be returned to them to face trial for the murder of Hester McMullan. This was despite the INLA being still a legal organisation at that point and McGlinchey himself‚Äîhaving already absconded from bail while in the north‚Äîbeing on the run and unobtainable. The court's decision was a dramatic break with precedent, and a controversial one, as the Republic objected to the use of Diplock courts in the north; it had rejected 48 similar applications from the north since 1970; this was the first such extradition since the creation of the Irish Free State in 1922. McGlinchey, in absentia, fought the decision. Although he rejected accusations of involvement in the murder, he claimed‚Äîin the words of the Extradition Act of 1965‚Äîthat the Toomebridge operation had been \\"a political offence or an offence connected with a political offence\\". Through his solicitors, McGlinchey presented evidence of his IRA active service at the time in the form of wanted posters, charge sheets and articles naming him in the Ballymena Guardian. This was not accepted, and McGinchley re-approached his challenge, this time basing it on the clause of the Act which prevented extradition if there were grounds for believing that, following transfer the individual would then in any case still be prosecuted for political offences. In a two-hour hearing, Chief Justice Tom O'Higgins rejected this claim also. He recorded the court's opinion that \\"modern terrorist violence...is often the antithesis of what could reasonably be regarded as political, either in itself or in its connections‚Äù. Higgins also declared that whether the victim of the alleged political offence‚Äîin McGlinchey's case, Hester ‚Äîwas killed or not was irrelevant to the question; the important point, he stressed, was that she was a civilian. \\"An elderly grandmother riddled with bullets\\", he continued, was in no way what \\"reasonable civilised people would regard as political activity\\". Public interest in McGlinchey's extradition subsided following the judgement, as, notes the jurist Alpha Connelly, he \\"did not oblige the Irish authorities by presenting himself to them for the purpose of extradition pursuant to the Supreme Court judgment\\". = Internal security = McGlinchey only ever crossed the border into Northern Ireland when an operation required it, which made it harder for the security services to maintain effective surveillance. In spite of secret surveillance south of the border, the Special Reconnaissance Unit had difficulty monitoring McGlinchey, argues the journalist Peter Taylor. As a result, they \\"did the next best thing and latched on to an INLA associate\\", Seamus Grew. Grew was a close friend of Mary McGlinchey. By tailing Grew north of the border, the SRU hoped to be led to McGlinchey. The RUC's intelligence arm, E4A, believing him to be in Armagh, thought they knew the route he would be taking back to the south. Six days after the Droppin Well bombing, Grew and another INLA member Roderick \\"Roddy\\" Carroll, were shot dead at an RUC checkpoint while driving through Mullacreevie. McGlinchey‚Äîthe intended target‚Äîhad been seen getting into their car in the south by The Det surveillance. He was believed to be bringing a bag of guns into the north. This was not the case; the handbrake was on, and neither were Grew or Carroll armed. It seems probable that he had been in the vehicle a few minutes earlier, but had alighted before reaching the roadblock, with what the Belfast priest and peace activist Fra Raymond Murray has called an \\"instinctive intuition\\". Dillon posits that the army had a shoot-to-kill policy with regard to McGlinchey, believing him to be always heavily armed and unlikely to surrender without a fight. The deaths of Grew and Carroll reinforced McGlinchey's conviction that there was a mole in the organisation with the sole intention of \\"setting up McGlinchey\\". Six months after Grew and Carroll were killed, McGlinchey believed he had found the source of E4A's information: Eric Dale, he believed, had provided the RUC with the information they required to locate Grew and Carroll. On the evening of 3 May 1983, McGlinchey personally led the gang who kidnapped Dale in front of his girlfriend, Claire McMahon, in Monaghan. She later said that the men originally said they wanted to speak to Dale \\"about guns or something that was missing\\". McGlinchey's role in the operation was to keep McMahon calm in the front room while other gang members interrogated Dale in the hallway. Mary McGlinchey was part of this team. McMahon later said that the only time she saw her partner again he was lying face-down on the floor surrounded by six people with guns. Dillon describes McGlinchey's appearance that night: > McGlinchey‚Äôs balaclava had slits for his eyes and stretched below his chin; > he wore a combat jacket, and a shoulder holster resting on his chest > contained a .44 magnum revolver. His right hand was positioned near the gun > butt and his left held the holster. McGlinchey told Claire that Dale would be returned to her shortly, and then emptied McMahon's car boot and bundled Dale into it. McGlinchey told her that if she had not heard from Dale by morning, she was to make her way to Culloville for information; McMahon, realising that the gang were going to steal her car as well, asked how she was expected to travel from Monaghan to South Armagh without a vehicle. She was not to see Dale again; his body was found four days later outside Killean. An INLA statement claimed that he had been executed for‚Äîamong other things‚Äîtrying to establish the whereabouts of \\"an alleged INLA man wanted on both sides of the border\\". This was an indirect reference to McGlinchey himself. As the Dale case illustrates, McGlinchey occasionally tortured his victims, often \\"with the aid of instruments such as a red-hot poker\\", says Coogan, often using Tom McCartan, a \\"quick-tempered and violent man\\", for such work. McGlinchey's efforts in counterintelligence did not stand in the way of the armed campaign. In May 1983 both McGlincheys, with two other men, took part in a drive by gun attack on a Cookstown checkpoint, him with a machine gun and her using a pistol. A police constable reservist, Colin Carson, was killed and fire was exchanged between those in the van and the RUC in a sangar. McGlinchey's fingerprints were later found in the van. The operation, said the UPI at the time, was claimed by the IRA's Tyrone Brigade as their responsibility, although it is generally considered to have been carried out by McGlinchey's group. Money and weapons were essential for the INLA's campaign, and McGlinchey‚Äîby now accompanied by Dessie O'Hare‚Äîorganised a number of bank and Securicor robberies, on one occasion stealing ¬£100,000 in a single raid. This allowed tentative plans to buy arms from the United States to be put into effect, although, in the event, the plan came to nothing. Another two robberies in Cork brought the group ¬£300,000 between them. Another favourite fundraising technique was fraud, one case of which was meant to have netted the group ¬£140,000 in stolen bankers' orders. However, √âamon McMahon from South Armagh, whose job it was to cash the orders, paid nothing. McMahon was an associate of Patrick Mackin‚Äîwith whom McGlinchey was involved in a personal feud‚Äîand, to resolve the issue, both men agreed to meet Mary McGlinchey in the Imperial Hotel in Dundalk. Trusting her, suggest Holland and McDonald, \\"was a fatal mistake\\": Mary had lured them there for her husband to kill. British intelligence also continued its attempts to capture McGlinchey. One extreme tactic, allegedly used in October 1983, was described by The Guardian as \\"badly botched\\". A fake tour operator called Caruso, under cover of an address in London's Albemarle Street, wrote to Tony and Margaret Hayde in September informing them that they had one third-prize in a competition, an all-expenses-paid week in Torremilenos. The Haydes were founder members of the IRSP, and The Times reported that \\"the couple, who admit to having met Dominic McGlinchey, allegedly INLA chief of staff and Ireland's most wanted man, say they were offered immediate cash and the promise of a further ¬£10,000 in return for information\\". By the end of 1983, relations with the Derry IRA had become fraught. The IRA had publicly condemned an INLA no-warning carbomb, and a number of IRA men had equally publicly left the organisation for the INLA. Matters came to a head in early December when an INLA man was accused of stealing an IRA gun, to which he retaliated by threatening senior Derry republicans. McGuinness, in an attempt to forestall a feud, contacted McGlinchey‚Äîboth men had stayed in contact after McGlinchey had left‚Äîfor assistance. McGlinchey met his man in Dundalk and instructed him to return the gun, in exchange for assurances as to the volunteer's safety. In an attempt to restore the peace, in a December 1983 interview with the Starry Plough, McGlinchey supported Sinn F√©in's decision to increase its political involvement in the Republic and called for greater cooperation in the north between the two groups. INLA violence continued alongside fundraising ventures and personal vendettas, although often unsuccessfully. For example, two operations had been planned for 13 August 1983. An RUC reservist was to be killed at a checkpoint in Markethill, while in Dungannon the police station was to be shot up. Both attempts were failures. At Markethill the unit failed to kill any police, while in Dungannon the INLA unit was ambushed and two volunteers shot dead. At the debriefing of the surviving volunteers, an attendee later recalled, McGlinchey \\"went mad and called us all stupid cunts\\". McGlinchey was also concerned about the loyalty of certain members of his Belfast Brigade, a number of whom were summoned to the Ardee farmhouse in late October 1983. Also kidnapped and brought to Ardee at the same time was ex-INLA member Gerard \\"Sparky\\" Barkley, who had been a close friend of Kirkpatrick. Although Barkley had publicly left the organisation, McGlinchey suspected him to be robbing banks with INLA weapons but not paying over anything to his old comrades as would be expected. Barkley swore that he was now merely an \\"ODC\\", or ordinary decent criminal. He was not believed. Following interrogation, Barkley was shot on McGlinchey's orders by either Paul \\"Bonanza\\" McCann or Mary McGlinchey. =Darkley massacre= alt=Darkley Pentecostal Church On 21 November 1983 two armed men walked into the Pentecostal Church in Darkley, South Armagh. They opened fire on the congregation, who were singing \\"Are You Washed in the Blood of the Lamb?\\", and shot a number of worshippers, three of whom died with many more injured. A previously unknown group calling itself the Catholic Reaction Force soon claimed responsibility for the killings, which it called a \\"token retaliation\\". The RUC confirmed that weaponry used in previous INLA operations had been used. The INLA, however, denied involvement and condemned the attack, although McGlinchey later acknowledged the presence of an INLA volunteer in the group to whom, McGlinchey admitted, he had loaned a Ruger rifle. McGlinchey expressed dismay at the attack and seems to have been unaware it was to take place, but notwithstanding this, the political damage was done and his name was now linked firmly to violent sectarianism. The attack had been the idea of a Belfast INLA man as revenge for the death of his brother at the hands of loyalists; he told McGlinchey that he wanted weapons to target a known UVF man. McGlinchey quickly acted to put distance between himself and the Darkley massacre. Referring to the reason for the attack he had originally been given, he claimed that the INLA man, following the death of his brother, involved\\"must have been unbalanced or something to have organised this killing\\". In an interview with the IRSP's newspaper, The Starry Plough, he stated of the Darkley killings: \\"I condemn them. Those people were only hillbilly folk who had done no harm to anyone. They are in no way a legitimate target. These killings are contrary to republican socialism. They cannot be defended.\\" Coogan also suggests that the man who planned the attack was \\"clearly deranged\\". The Irish anthropologist S. Bruce argues that McGlinchey's approach can \\"reasonably\\" be inferred to have been that \\"if Protestants get caught in the cross-fire, they deserve it\\". Darkley was yet another propaganda disaster for the INLA, and whether McGlinchey liked it or not, symbolised what it was best known for. The murders heightened McGlinchey's profile further, and, argue Holland and McDonald, for much of 1983 \\"Ireland and Britain were gripped by 'Mad Dog' fever\\". McGlinchey‚Äîstill on the run‚Äîwas reportedly spotted all over the island. McGlinchey's tactics for evading capture, the Garda√≠ later reported, included never staying in the one place too long and frequently disguising his appearance. On one occasion, claimed The Guardian, his disguise was good enough to enable him to attend his sister's wedding \\"and that not even those standing in the church during the ceremony realised that he was there\\". Sunday Tribune interview Six days after the Darkley attack, McGlinchey gave an interview to the Sunday Tribune, conducted by its editor, Vincent Browne. Browne said that the public had a right to know about McGlinchey, and McGlinchey was keen to put his side of the story across, as by now the IRA had also condemned Darkley as purely sectarian. He appears to have offered the BBC the opportunity to interview him first, but they declined. Browne and McGlinchey talked for four hours, only being interrupted for occasional refreshment. Browne later annotated his notes of the interview, describing McGlinchey as speaking \\"with a soft Derry accent...for the most part, relaxed, composed and fairly articulate\\". Browne suggested that the term \\"Mad Dog\\" seemed misapplied to the man he interviewed although also that \\"there is a coldness about him in relation to the consequences of his actions which is chilling\\". Browne realised that McGlinchey was not used to speaking with journalists, as he was \\"quite devoid of the caution and guile\\" Browne was usually met with by his subjects. McGlinchey may, Browne said, have been overly tired. Conversely, Browne noted, the pressure of the situation may have sharpened McGlinchey's wits, for Browne wrote that McGlinchey soon \\"perked up\\" and became \\"unusually well able to carry the drift of an argument through several convolutions\\". Their conversation shifted from Irish politics to the global; this may have been deliberate on McGlinchey's part to distract from the Darkley attack and questions as to his own role in it. Browne discussed McGlinchey's preferred tactics on an operation, asking, for example, whether McGlinchey ever saw the face of his victim: Vincent Browne, who interviewed an on-the-run McGlinchey in 1983, photographed in 2008 > Usually, for I like to get in close, to minimise the risk for myself. It‚Äôs > usually just a matter of who gets in first and by getting in close you put > your man down first. It has worked for me down the years. I wouldn‚Äôt be as > good as they are [the security forces] shooting it out over distances > because I don‚Äôt get the opportunity for weapons and target training like > they do. So I believe in getting in close‚Äô. The last time this had happened, added McGlinchey, was \\"the Cookstown job\\", referring to the death of Constable Carson in May that year. McGlinchey described how he \\"went up to the bunker outside the police station and just opened up on the policeman in the bunker\\". One of the few times McGlinchey seemed uneasy in the interview, wrote Browne, was when he was asked about the children of McGlinchey's victims, to which he replied in generalities. He also became agitated, saying that he refused to be \\"blackmailed by the grief of children\\". McGlinchey showed no remorse for his activities, said Browne, only a \\"frightening indifference\\". After the interview was published, the Garda√≠ visited the Tribune's offices and studied it minutely to extract any clue as to his whereabouts. In Britain, The Guardian newspaper described McGlinchey's availability for interviewing by anyone he wanted \\"embarrassing\\" for the Garda√≠ at a time when the police were under pressure to capture him. = Capture = The manhunt for McGlinchey and his gang involved hundreds of soldiers and Garda√≠, while the media \\"followed their trail around the Republic in some awe\\". A Garda√≠ patrol eventually discovered him accidentally in Cork City on 2 December 1983. Far from being a police triumph, the encounter was \\"one of the more farcical incidents\\" among what Dolan calls their \\"picaresque\\" manhunt. Two Garda√≠ knocked on the door and, receiving no answer, attempted to force an entry. McGlinchey‚àíwith Mary‚àíand comrades were covering them with their guns as the police entered. A later report suggested that Mary had wanted to kill them, but her husband restrained her. The republicans made them strip at gunpoint‚Äîa tactic McGlinchey used a number of times in encounters with the Garda√≠‚Äîand tied them up. The officers took three hours to escape from their bonds, by which time McGlinchey and his gang had stolen a car and escaped with the help of a local man. McGlinchey's \\"humiliation\\" of the Garda√≠, says Dillon, \\"energised\\" the manhunt. It also, suggests Coogan, \\"inject[ed] something of a Robin Hood element\\" to republican propaganda, as well as‚Äîby making them \\"peel off\\" their uniforms‚Äî\\"adding a new definition to the tern 'peeler'\\". The gang were armed with automatic assault rifles, pump- action shotguns and short arms. McGlinchey and his gang were eventually captured on his way to meet his children‚Äîon which account, he later said, he panicked when he was surrounded‚Äîon St Patrick's Day 1984 in County Clare. They holed himself up in the house of John Lyons, a musician; although Lyons was absent, his wife and children were at home, hostages for McGlinchey. The Garda√≠'s Security Task Force‚Äînumbering 40 men‚Äîdid not expect to be able to force his surrender, so they were accompanied by the Irish Army who were equipped with Uzi submachine guns. As the police drove up to the house, McGlinchey opened fire on the leading vehicle from an upstairs room. Garda Chris Power was hit in the shoulder, and was forced to remain in the car for safety while the firefight took place, even though he was bleeding heavily. Both sides exchanged shots, until a priest was sent in to negotiate with McGlinchey from the bottom of the stairs. At 7:15pm, having been wounded, and to safeguard Mrs Lyons, and both their children‚ÄîMcGlinchey's were nearby, in the care of a supporter‚Äîhe surrendered. The priest, Father Timothy Tuohy, later told how McGlinchey and his gang wanted him to stay with them as they left the house, expressing fears that they would be assassinated if there were no witnesses. Extradition, imprisonment, release and imprisonment B113, or Old Dublin Road‚Äîwhere McGlinchey was handed by the Garda√≠ to the RUC, and then back again; the border itself lies approximately by the yellow sign to the right of the road Following McGlinchey's arrest, he was interrogated in Ennis police station. In Dublin, events moved fast. The Supreme Court had already authorised his extradition to the north, and now had to be \\"hastily convened\\"‚Äîsince it was the evening of a bank holiday‚Äîto action it. This occurred \\"fairly promptly\\", noted Gemma Hussey, Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, in her cabinet diary. There was some uncertainty as to whether McGlinchey would be extradited immediately or be prosecuted in the south for his offences there first. McGlinchey appealed the decision, questioning the constitutionality of the 1965 Act. This was rejected ex tempore by the court. In O'Donnell's words, thanks to the Attorney General Peter Sutherland \\"and an unprecedented\\" court sitting, within 18 hours of his arrest in Clare he was transferred to the RUC at the Killeen border checkpoint. This took place at around 1am on the morning of 18 March 1984 and had been the fastest extradition in Irish history. It was also the first: no republican had ever been extradited from the Republic to the North. McGlinchey appointed a Newry man called \\"Jap\\" chief of staff during McGlinchey's enforced absence. McGlinchey's extradition was criticised in the Republic by those who wished him to face justice first for the crimes he had committed there \\"before caving in on the important principle of extradition\\". The British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Prior, hailed the arrest as \\"a major victory in the struggle against terrorism\\", while the MEP for Northern Ireland, John Taylor called it \\"the best news to come out of Dublin for many years\\". Sinn F√©in said the extradition had caused \\"a sense of treachery and anger\\" in the Nationalist community; The Economist wrote that, while \\"the IRA had no love for Mr McGlinchey...it must fear the creation of precedents that could affect its own gunmen\\". The largest mainstream left-wing political party in the Republic, Fianna F√°il, \\"kept an uneasy silence while some backbenchers protested\\" against it, while the Taoiseach gave it his \\"vigorous backing\\". A month after McGlinchey's capture, The Economist suggested that McGlinchey faced \\"only a single, seven-year-old murder charge, which could be hard to prove\\". While he was on remand, McGlinchey's daughter Ma√≠re died of meningitis. He was released on parole to attend her funeral in Bellaghy. Nearly six months after his extradition, McGlinchey appeared in court for the murder of Hester McMullan in December 1984. Five crown witnesses failed to appear, but the Crown used McGlinchey's own admissions to the SCC regarding his IRA activity as evidence on Christmas Eve Justice Hutton sentenced McGlinchey to life imprisonment. Following what Arizona jurist Michael P. P. Simon calls a \\"controversial and politically sensitive decision\\", Coogan says that it then \\"soon became clear that the Northern authorities had little or no evidence\\" on which to hold McGlinchey. He was released by Belfast Appeal Court the following year. Lord Justice Gibson found that McGlinchey's previous confession to the Garda regarding his IRA membership did not necessarily mean that he was involved in every action the IRA carried out in the area. Further, Gibson ruled that the fingerprints that had been found on the getaway car could have been placed on the vehicle up to 30-hours after Hester's death. Both McGlinchey's confession to membership, and his fingerprints, said Gibson in a 45-minute judgment, were thus inadmissible as evidence. =Return to the Republic= Having been the first republican to have been extradited from the south to the north, on 11 October 1985 he also became the first person to be re-extradited from the north back. The then-leader of Sinn F√©in, Gerry Adams, later joked in Fortnight magazine that the Catholic Church was insistent that \\"although reports that Mr McGlinchey was seen to move have been verified by many observers, his movements back and forth across the border do not meet the conditions used to describe a mirable\\". McGlinchey was handed back to the Garda√≠ at the Killeen border crossing, and immediately re-arrested on charges relating to the Clare siege. As well as Garda√≠ Special Branch armed with Uzis, McGlinchey was greeted by spectators with placards, note Holland and McDonald. Of these read c√©ad m√≠le f√°ilte, while another said \\"Welcome home, Daddy\\". By this point, argues Coogan, \\"the pendulum of public opinion had swung back towards him considerably\\". His photograph had appeared in the news often enough for the \\"Mad Dog\\" image to appear a misnomer, and his wife and young children were photogenic. McGlinchey was convicted at the Special Criminal Court in March 1986 for firearms offences from two years earlier. The presiding judge, Mr Justice MacMahon commented during his sentencing that \\"it was to his credit\\" that MvGlinchey had not fired on the Garda√≠ although having had many opportunities to do so. McGlinchey was sent to Portlaoise for 10 years, where he became a model prisoner, immersing himself in the study of constitutional and extradition law, on which he became expert. As a result, he became an informal advisor to other prisoners and was able to dismiss his barristers and prosecute his own appeals. The Supreme Court advised McGlinchey to seek payment of the state aid paid to defence counsel as he was acting on his own behalf. McGlinchey's appeals failed in Ireland and then also in the European Court of Human Rights. He then appealed to the Supreme Court again, on the new grounds that the 1981 warrant from Belfast was flawed. Justice Declan Costello initially agreed, noting that the police officer upon whose oath it had been issued had failed to sign it as he should have. However, said Costello, there were sufficient safeguards in the extradition process to have allowed McGlinchey to have presented this evidence on an earlier occasion; he had not done so, and the appeal was therefore dismissed. Dillon suggests that during this period of imprisonment, McGlinchey reconsidered the direction of his life, resolving to retire from military activity and become a family man. On the outside, though, McGlinchey was beginning to be seen as a potential leader for a disaffected group of Provisionals from the East Tyrone Brigade. McGlinchey, they knew, \\"had even less regard for the Adams leadership than the East Tyrone men\\". INLA feuding Bernadette McAliskey photographed in 1986 While McGlinchey was in Portlaoise he could not control external events. In December 1985 members of the INLA in the north were released after their convictions in the supergrass trials, including a previous chief of staff, Gerard Steenson. Many of them‚Äîalready distrustful of each other after Kirkpatrick's many allegations and the \\"dirty laundry aired\\" as a result‚Äîcame into conflict with each other as they attempt to retake the positions in the group. Their conflict soon descended into a violent feud, with the INLA effectively splitting into four distinct factions. The mass-imprisonments following Kirkpatrick's evidence had been extremely damaging for the INLA, and between December 1986 to March 1987 there were 12 deaths‚Äîincluding much of the IRSP and INLA leadership‚Äîand many more injuries in an increasingly bloody feud. =Killing of Mary McGlinchey= Mary McGlinchey‚Äîcalled \\"Mrs Mad Dog\\" by the ex-soldier and writer Ken Wharton‚Äîmay have continued to organise her husband's operation while he was incarcerated, perhaps even running it. Publicly, she appears to have distanced herself from political activity (notwithstanding, noted The Sunday Tribune, that \\"her window displayed a Sinn F√©in election poster\\"). She probably to have supported the faction still controlled by her husband's man‚Äî\\"Jap\\" O'Reilly‚Äîin the INLA's faction feuding but not to the extent of playing a direct role. On 1 February 1987, at around 9:20pm, at the family home in Dundalk, she was bathing their two children upstairs when two-balaclava-clad men broke into through the back door and ran upstairs. They fired at Mary McGlinchey with automatic weapons, shooting her in the face. Declan, the eldest child, escaped out of the house and raised the neighbours, who found Mary shot, with her head in the bath. Regional newspaper The Argus later reported that the killing \\"caused shock waves in the town\\". RT√â reported the next day that McGlinchey had been asleep in the ground floor block of Portlaoise's E-Wing‚Äîwhich housed, in part, \\"members and former members of the INLA\\"‚Äîwhen prison authorities were informed of his wife's killing. McGlinchey was awakened and moved to another section of the prison, where he was given the news. However, noted RT√â, \\"the prison authorities refused to disclose what his reaction was\\", that being personal information. When asked whether his move had been because McGlinchey was considered to be in danger among other INLA men, the prison official said it was \\"prudent and in the best interests of everyone\\". The McGlinchey children were taken into care by Brigid Makowski, who had previously been their legal guardian. Mary's inquest was delayed three months as McGlinchey's counsel argued he had only been informed two days earlier and had not had sufficient time to instruct him. Holland and McDonald argue that \\"because [McGlinchey] was the personification of all that happened to the INLA from 1982 to early 1984, those who suffered under his reign blamed McGlinchey personally.\\" Many people‚Äîincluding some republicans‚Äîwanted him dead. She is known to have taken an active part in McGlinchey's activities; the RUC wished to question her in the matter of 20 deaths, and had made enemies of her own, particularly by luring victims for her husband's execution squads. The method of her murder also, says Dillon, \\"implied personal revenge\\". With McGlinchey in enforced absence in Portlaoise, it is likely that her killers took advantage of the general chaos of the on-going INLA feud to settle an old score. Although it is unclear exactly what was requested and what was denied, Holland and McDonald state that McGlinchey applied for permission to attend her funeral. This was refused by the Department of Justice on the grounds of the security risk. McGlinchey was reported as being \\"devastated\\" by her death. Although the Justice Department offered him the opportunity to hear a private service for his wife within the prison‚Äîwith his children and close friend Bernadette Devlin McAliskey attending‚ÄîMcGlinchey refused, demanding he be allowed to the funeral itself. Mary may have been killed the same gang that would later be responsible for McGlinchey's death, part of a \\"long-running feud\\", suggested a group of Belfast journalists researching the conflict's mortality rate. It may also have been over money. Coogan suggests that her killers‚Äîwho blamed her for the part she played in the deaths of McMahon and Mackin‚Äîflew in from the United States the day before and having shot her with borrowed guns, \\"were back on a plane to America the next day\\". Both the Garda√≠ and the INLA judged it an IPLO operation, and within a few days the latter had assassinated one of that group. The IRSP concurred, their spokesman Kevin Quillan saying in a radio interview the next day that they \\"could quite clearly state that we would lay the blame for this brutal murder at the door of the so-called IPLO, one of the factions of these dissident groupings\\", and further suggested that the IPLO received the assistance of British intelligence in targeting Mary McGlinchey. However, her death appears to have been unconnected with it. McGlinchey wanted to investigate Mary's death, but he was hampered by the fact that no-one was willing to discuss it with him while the feud was still on- going. Her death also put an end to the on-going contact between the INLA and the disaffected elements of the East Tyrone Brigade who had contacted McGlinchey. After their mother's death, Declan and Dominic lived with their maternal and paternal grandparents, in Toomebridge and Bellaghy respectively. Following his wife's death, McGlinchey released a statement from Portlaoise in which he denounced the INLA's feud and said that neither he nor Mary had had any dealings with the group since his incarceration begun. Therefore, he said, there was no reason for any organisation to play any part in her funeral. In October 1992 McGlinchey applied for temporary parole in order to see his children over the public holiday, but the request had been turned down on security reasons. Two months later he applied again, this time to spend five days over Christmas with them. This request was accepted. McGlinchey was released for good in March the following year. He had served seven of his 10-year sentence. He announced his intention of refocussing the INLA's efforts on investigating the money laundering activities of the UVF and its connections with Irish gangsterism. Still politically hardline, he condemned the on-going Hume‚ÄìAdams talks, as well as the Downing Street Declaration, which he considered a betrayal of the republicanism's ethos. Later career Following his release, McGlinchey lived temporarily in Dublin and then moved to 62 Meadowview, south Drogheda. He found part-time work in a nearby supermarket. He spent time with his children, taking them on holiday to the Aran Islands. The journalist Maggie O'Kane later described McGlinchey's last days: \\"Since his release from prison last year he had lived on the east coast of Ireland in the town of Drogheda in a house attached to Thornton's grocer‚Äôs shop and video store. Locals tended to boycott it when they heard McGlinchey had arrived. They believed his occasional appearances at the counter were a cover for a new armed gang he was forming in the Republic\\". His old organisation, meanwhile, had continued its campaign, on his release, attempting‚Äîbut failing‚Äîto kill a UVF man in north Belfast in January 1993, for example. If McGlinchey had decided to turn his back on armed struggle, suggests Dillon, within a short space of time he discovered that his enemies had not. In June 1993, he was driving to his son Dominic's birthday party in Newtowndarver, Dundalk. A car pulled up next to him, and McGlinchey, probably thinking it was the Garda√≠, approached it. A man with a machine gun got out, but as he was cocking the weapon, McGlinchey grabbed hold of it: a short of fire skimmed McGlinchey's head, but the weapon jammed. The attacker then drew a pistol, with a number of shots hitting McGlinchey; he, however, was able to take cover in a shrubbery. Coogan comments that one of McGlinchey's children ran after the car to take its number. Although McGlinchey survived the attack, a bullet was lodged in his skull. This and others were removed under surgery. McGlinchey was kept under armed guard while recovering in hospital. The identity of the gunmen is unknown. McGlinchey, at different times, blamed both British Intelligence‚Äîhe said his attackers had English accents‚Äîand the Loyalist leader Billy Wright, whom McGlinchey had previously attempted to assassinate. The IPLO also claimed responsibility, although McGlinchey rejected the suggestion. Reiterating his view that British intelligence was responsible, he claimed that \\"the only people who would gain from me going home to Bellaghy in a box were the British\\". McKittrick suggests that there was much contemporaneous speculation as to the involvement of South Armagh republicans. Others have also suggested that it was a UVF operation, or perhaps carried out by friends of Sparky Barkley. Holland and McDonald comment, however, that: > The choice of venue to gun down one of Ireland‚Äôs most notorious paramilitary > figures...pointed to the real identity of the gang. It was not an accident > that they had chosen the spot near Ardee, County Louth, because it was there > that he assumed the leadership of the INLA almost exactly ten years before. Notwithstanding his disowning of the INLA, McGlinchey, it seems, also had scores to settle, for both the attack on him and the death of his wife. When he was released from Portlaoise he said had a death-list naming 15 enemies. Some contemporaries, though, have stated that he appears to have mellowed after Mary's death. He had moved to Drogheda and was now living in near- anonymity; few of his neighbours were aware of his past. He may have felt that having effectively left the INLA, his enemies would forget him‚Äîor at least, argues Dillon, not risk travelling that far into the Republic of Ireland to target him. He was still involved with the movement ideologically, however, and with McAliskey, he was working on a draft constitution for a united Ireland. Comments Dolan, \\"although there were some suggestions that he was trying to assemble a new republican unit and returning to the racketeering he had engaged in throughout the 1980s, he strongly denied it\\". For their part, the Garda√≠ believed him responsible for a number of armed robberies that took place in Counties Louth and Tipperary in early 1994. According to McGlinchey's son Dominic, speaking in 2014, his father was working alongside a senior Provisional IRA man investigating links between a corrupt IRA unit and the UVF in Dublin. Death Maggie O'Kane described the scene of McGlinchey's death in Drogheda: \\"On the wall of a nurses' home overlooking the scene, an outstretched angel surveyed his final moments...[his son ran] to one of the red-bricked houses that line Hardman's Gardens\\". In Northern Ireland, by spring 1994, writes Moloney, \\"the violence continued apace...with both republicans and loyalists killing freely\\". The INLA's 1986‚Äì1987 feud had also reignited. Sinn F√©in, on the other hand, was actively promoting a strategy of peace to the IRA and the mainstream republican movement. A former Provisional explained to Dillon why McGlinchey was more personally vulnerable at this time than he probably realised. Part of McGlinchey's problem, the volunteer said, was that after his release McGlinchey \\"no longer had a terrorist group to protect him\\". The source said that, without the safe-houses, the intelligence reports, the support network and the instinctive security precautions that had guided his life on the run, he had become \\"as vulnerable as some of those people [he] used to target. That was McGlinchey's problem. He failed to understand that he'd become a sitting duck\\". Effectively, argues the journalist Fergal Keane, by the time of McGlinchey's death, \\"there was no-one left in the organisation to protect him\\". At around 9:30 on the evening of Thursday, 10 February 1994, McGlinchey had visited friends of his in Duleek Road, near his home, and dined there. He left around forty minutes later, intending to take a video back to a shop in Brookville, on the north side of town. McGlinchey later described his father's demeanour that night as \\"agitated and emotionally upset\\". He said he asked his father whether he believed himself to be in danger from the IRA, to which McGlinchey replied \\"I am just sick of my name being blackened by men who never fired a shot...no, the IRA would never kill me, son\\". At around 11pm McGlinchey and the 16-year- old Dominic were returning home, when‚Äî\\"for reasons never made clear\\", says Dillon‚ÄîMcGlinchey pulled up to make a phone call from a public kiosk on Hardman's Gardens, near Lourdes Hospital. Almost immediately‚Äîdespite the presence of four witnesses‚Äîa red Mazda pulled up alongside him. While his son watched from the car, three men got out and beat McGlinchey. Once McGlinchey was on the ground the men‚Äîwho were armed with three pump action shotguns and a pistol‚Äîfired into him 14 times. The attack finished with a coup de gr√¢ce to the head, although he was dead already. His last words were reputed to be \\"Jesus, Mary help me\\"; his son yelled for an ambulance. According to the first officer on the scene, Dominic junior told her, \\"it's my dad, it's my dad, he's been shot. Quick, get up the checkpoints\\". \\"The horrifying impact of witnessing such cold brutality on McGlinchey‚Äôs son can only be guessed at\\", observe Holland and McDonald. The following day, an autopsy was carried out in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, which showed McGlinchey had been hit in the neck, skull, the left upper chest, the left arm, and both legs. His inquest was held in Drogheda two weeks later, suspended and then reopened in November 1996. Garda√≠ forensic officers told the coroner that they had compared the shell casings they had found with the database, but no matches had been made to other known weapons; the officer noted that, as of that time, no such information had been received from the RUC. The shotguns used were impossible to trace ballistically, but it had been ascertained that the Mazda was registered in the north. Bernadette McAliskey made a statement for the family, in which she condemned the Garda√≠'s investigation into the McGlinchey's killing and suggested that the killers were two known UVF men from the north. Further, she said > Despite the fact that he was himself under constant Garda surveillance, > despite a previous attempt on his life and the existence of photo fit > identification of two assailants in that attempt and the fact that they bear > an uncanny resemblance to two known members of the UVF in the North, it is > inconceivable to the McGlinchey family that the Gardai have been unable to > keep any, further progress in this inquiry. However, the Garda√≠ stated that they were not watching McGlinchey, and that \\"he was not hiding. He drove his car around the town and was known to us here.\\" They also stated that they did not believe that he had been engaged in criminal conspiracies or activities. Keane directly linked both McGlinchey's and his wife's deaths to the killings of McMahon and Mackin years before. Keane suggests that an associate of the dead men had already returned to Dundalk in 1989‚Äîwhen it had seemed as if McGlinchey's appeal might be successful‚Äîfrom abroad and had been open about his intentions if McGlinchey was released. Following McGlinchey's death, a number of stories appeared in the Irish press accusing him of drug dealing and other crimes, such as fencing stolen lorries from the border region. Coogan asserts that these stories were the product of Garda Special Branch press briefings. =Funeral= Grave of Dominic, Mary and M√°ire McGlinchey in Bellaghy McGlinchey was buried in Bellaghy. Around 60 mourners, mostly family, saw off his body from Drogheda before the journey north. McAliskey kissed the coffin, which was carried by her, Sean McGlinchey, Dominic junior and Father O'Daly, who had given McGlinchey the last rites on Hardman's Gardens. The hearse was accompanied by what the Garda√≠ described as a \\"low key\\" security operation. Their spokesman said \\"we did not wish to flood the scene with Garda√≠ or there would have been more of them than mourners\\". McGlinchey's funeral was held on 13 February 1994 in Bellaghy, with no republican accoutrements. There was no INLA colour party, and only an Irish tricolor draped over the coffin. Over 1,500 people attended watched closely by 200 RUC. Police armoured vans were held on the perimeter. McGlinchey was buried alongside Mary and their young daughter M√°ire. His coffin was carried from the McGlinchey family home to St Mary's Church by pall-bearers who were swapped out from the crowd every 40-yards or so. Martin McGuinness was among them, as was Bernadette McAliskey and her daughter R√≥is√≠n. McGlinchey's sons carried the coffin for the final yards; comments Keane, \\"Dominic and Declan McGlinchey have seen more than most because of the troubles in Northern Ireland\\". The priest, Father Michael Flanagan, condemned what he called the media's glorification of McGlinchey's killing, telling the crowd \\"no-one deserved to die like that. There's a little bit of good in the worst of us and a little bit of bad in the best.\\" Dillon's anonymous Provisional source confirmed that McGuinness's presence at the funeral indicated the high-standing as a soldier in which the IRA held McGlinchey, despite its disapproval of his organisation. McGlinchey's grave had a flagpole next to it from which a Tricolour flew after the burial. His grave lies a short distance from that of Francis Hughes, who had died on hunger strike in May 1981. Bernadette McAliskey gave the graveside oration, which effectively eulogised McGlinchey. She condemned the recent press coverage which had accused McGlinchey of drug dealing and criminality and said of the journalists responsible that they were > Curs and dogs. May every one of them rot in hell. They have taken away > Dominic McGlinchey's character and they will stand judgement for it. He was > the finest republican of them all. He never dishonoured the cause he > believed in. His war was with the armed soldiers and the police of this > state. Following this speech, some of the mourners turned on the observing press corps and shouted abuse, reported The Times. A couple of months after the funeral, McAliskey later explained her thinking to The Guardian. Their reporter, David Sharrock, asked if her tirade had been intended to counteract the negative stories about McGlinchey that had recently appeared in the press. McAliskey said > It's very difficult to conduct a conversation about a person who bore no > resemblance in the media to the person I knew for 10 years. His thinking was > just fundamentally democratic and to acknowledge that Dominic McGlinchey had > an intellect was to acknowledge the reality of this conflict here. > Republicanism is not simply anti-partitionist and confined to Ireland. It is > a tradition of secular egalitarian democracy. So yes. Dominic was the finest > republican of his generation. The rest of it I might take back...I don't > even believe in hell. In the New Statesman the following month, the journalist and political activist Eamonn McCann‚Äîdiscussing Sinn F√©in's \\"search for respectability\\"‚Äîconsidered the speech of his \\"old comrade\\" McAliskey, which he said he had been \\"taken aback by the ferocity\\" of. However, said McCann, in context this was less surprising than should otherwise have been expected. The press coverage of McGlinchey's death, argued McCann, suggested that \\"the killing had been a good thing [and] the details of how he died were recounted with undisguised relish\\". The focus, he said, was on portraying McGlinchey was different from the brand of Irish republicanism that was increasingly becoming part of mainstream political discourse. Family and personal life McGlinchey was raised a Catholic and remained so for the rest of his life, although he described himself as a \\"believing one\\" rather than a practising one. While imprisoned, on 5 July 1975 McGlinchey married Mary, daughter of Patrick O'Neil from Toomebridge. The author Ed Moloney describes her as a \\"formidable\\" women, who became an \\"experienced and ruthless operator in her own right\\". Dominic and Mary McGlinchey had two sons, Declan, born in 1978, and Dominic, who was a year younger. They also had a daughter Ma√≠re, in 1985; she died of meningitis the following year. Three of McGlinchey's brothers joined the IRA. Sean was convicted of the 1973 Coleraine bombings and received a life sentence; he became a Sinn F√©in councillor after the Belfast Agreement. Paul was jailed for 14 years after attempting to assassinate the Reverend Overend in 1976‚Äîwhom the INLA would later try and blow up on McGlinchey's orders; he later stood against Sinn F√©in in the 2007 Assembly election. A third brother, Michael, was convicted of IRA membership. McGlinchey's son Declan was also active in the republican socialist movement and remained living in Bellaghy. In 2009 he was arrested and investigated under suspicion of involvement in the Real IRA's attack on Masereene Barracks. Declan died of a suspected heart attack in Bellaghy on 31 October 2015. He was given what the Irish News described as a \\"paramilitary-style funeral\\", involving a masked colour party and a gun salute the night before. His brother, Dominic √ìg supported the Adams-McGuinness Sinn F√©in leadership until 2007, when they endorsed the PSNI. He has been critical of the party since, describing them as \\"not too different to that of any corporate company\\". Since then, however, he has stated that he does not \\"see mass appetite at a street level for the armed campaign\\", and has stated his wish to \\"start to have a conversation about the removal of the gun from Irish politics\\" with dissident groups. He is also involved in broader left-wing activism such as opposition to the Iraq War. Dominic, like Declan, was also named in court as having been implicated in the Masereerne attack, which he denied. On his father's death, Dominic √ìg is reported as believing that McGlinchey was killed in order to remove a potential obstacle to the burgeoning Peace Process. Aftermath and legacy =Aftermath= McGlinchey's death did not stop the INLA's internal feuding, and by this point, says Coogan, it had also turned to drug dealing and racketeering. In 1996, another INLA chief of staff‚ÄîGino Gallagher‚Äîwas also shot dead, probably by a rival faction. This led to a further bloody feud. McGlinchey had \\"helped keep the INLA on the map after the hunger strike\\", says Davies, and Holland and McDonald suggest that the INLA's fragmentation after his death indicates McGlinchey's importance to the organisation. They argued that he acted as \\"a makeshift bolt\\"; while he was alive, and particularly while he was operational, the bolt had held the component parts of the group together. But with his death, \\"that terror machine finally broke into disparate parts. The descent into chaos had begun.\\" Although the armed struggle continued, it was generally ineffectual. The INLA cast itself as defenders of the Catholic community and tried to take the war to Loyalism. However, over the next few years the group killed over 40 civilians and 10 of its own volunteers while accounting for only five loyalists. =Legacy= The scholar Arwel Ellis Owen has blamed McGlinchey for the INLA's subsequent descent into factionalism, which he argues was a direct result of McGlinchey's being on the run throughout his leadership. His enforced absence, Owen suggests, prevented him from taking day-to-day control. This was particularly caused by McGlinchey's emasculation of the Army Council and collective decision-making processes; when he left, there was no-one to fill the vacuum his departure created. The INLA's increased focus on internecine feuding also distracted them their political or strategic aims. and McGlinchey has also been criticised for failing to support the political struggle waged by the IRSP. Their finances were consistently low or non-existent and they relied on the military wing to provide them with funds. Little was forthcoming, in spite of the INLA's numerous successful robberies. McGlinchey appears, therefore, to have had little interest in any form of struggle other than the military. This was despite, note Holland and McDonald, of concerns raised by seasoned INLA men such as Harry Flynn and Gerry Roche that socialist politics and activity was fundamental to the existence of both groups. Despite McGlinchey's claim that his priority for the republican socialist movement to provide \\"political leadership on the class struggle in Ireland\\", argues the author Daniel Finn, politics \\"withered on the vine\\" under his command. McGlinchey, commented the author Thomas G. Mitchell, \\"had minimal interest in the party. Instead, he wanted to ake the INLA the most ruthless and feared terrorist group in Northern Ireland.\\" Although McAliskey praised the memory of McGlinchey, in practical terms, suggest Holland and McDonald, his \\"effect on the organisation Mrs McAliskey once supported was negative\\", and his legacy should be seen as division and paranoia within the INLA, they suggest. It is possible that, before he was killed, McGlinchey had come to regret leaving the IRA. One of their ex-volunteers told Dillon that had McGlinchey remained with the Provisionals, they \\"would have stood him down from active service. He'd probably still be alive and part of the peace process.\\" Alternatively, it has been suggested that McGlinchey had already been identified by elements within the IRA opposed to Sinn F√©in's peace strategy as a potential future rallying point for dissidents. Dermot Finucane, brother of murdered Belfast solicitor Pat Finucane, later told the investigative author Kevin Toolis that the \\"Wanted\\" posters put up about McGlinchey and Hughes influenced him to join the IRA in 1978. Finucane told Toolis how \\"I remember seeing Dominic McGlinchey and Ian Millen and Francis Hughes 'Wanted' posters when they were on the run as the most wanted men in Ulster, and I remember mentally saying: 'That is what you want, you want to inflict so much damage on the enemy they want you badly'\\". McGlinchey was commemorated in the INLA wing of the Maze Prison with a mural on a communal wall. McGlinchey is portrayed in a black beret and against a fiery background and a silhouetted hillside. The caption read \\"Comrade Dominic McGlinchey. Proudly remembered by the INLA POWs. Long Kesh\\". Similarly, the scholar Paul K. Clare said that, while researching public opinion in Northern Ireland, he asked a group of young men in Turf Lodge \\"if there was any one individual who they admired more than anyone else. 'Mad Dog' McGlinchey\\" was their reply.\\" Such views, argues Clare, were \\"not so uncommon that they would be considered abnormal\\". Personality and reputation = Personality and approach = The author Martin Dillon met McGlinchey in the mid-1980s and described him as \\"six feet tall, and lean, with a receding hairline. In his 30s, his slightly rounded face gave him the look of a much younger man.\\" Coogan also visited McGlinchey in Portlaoise and wrote that he appeared \\"tired, reduced by his past and by prison\\". He had a tricolour tattoo on his left forearm. The Garda√≠ later described McGlinchey as vain, and enjoying melodrama. Edna O'Brien described him as \\"most reflective and at the same time most forthcoming\\". She later told Marianne Heron of the Irish Independent that she had told McGlinchey \\"that she liked everything about him except what he was [and] he told her that his mother said the same thing\\". O'Brien also denied ever having an affair with McGlinchey; she claimed later that, as a result of her research for a book, she had to refute questions as to whether she \\"had love affairs with republicans\\". His reputation, suggests the writer Jonathan Stevenson, became that of \\"fabled killer\\", while Coogan describes him as \\"a latter-day Ned Kelly\\", as committed to republicanism as Frances Hughes yet with far greater notoriety. He was also, suggest Holland and McDonald, \\"probably the most famous and most charismatic INLA chief of staff since S√©amus Costello\\". Where Costello ruled by collective agreement, though, McGlinchey ruled by decree; his tenure as INLA chief of staff has been summed up as \\"brutal, authoritarian, but nonetheless still relatively cohesive\\" by researcher Gary Ackerman. McGlinchey, at his own estimate, killed \\"around...30\\" people in his career, of whom all but one, he said, were members of the security forces; the historian Keith Jeffrey has calculated that McGlinchey was responsible for 28 murders, 30 bombings and 11 armed robberies. According to the journalist Nicholas Davies, his victims were \\"mainly officers of the RUC, the army and the UDR. He also murdered civilians.\\" Holland and McDonald suggest that during his tenure as Chief of Staff McGlinchey \\"held the organisation together\\" at a time when it was expected to implode. McGlinchey, a contemporary said, \\"made his own luck\\", and Davies described McGlinchey as \\"a fearless man who would take extraordinary risks\\", particularly in his tactic of close-quarters engagements. the scholar C. M. Drake notes, however, that \\"where there is little protection for a human target...a close-quarter assassination is a simple option\\". After his death, an IRSP spokesman, Fra Halligan defended McGlinchey's lack of political idealism, pointing out that he \\"wouldn't have had any problem saying [so] to you\\". For example, when Adams ideologically linked the republican campaign to the ANC's struggles in South Africa against Apartheid, McGlinchey is claimed to have said that, in rural nationalist areas \\"they don't know anything about Mandela but they see Brits in their fields and they don't like it\\". McGlinchey summed up his own approach as being \\"to do what had to be done and don't think about it thereafter\\". Although he was never completely unafraid, he said‚Äî\\"you need a certain amount of fear to keep you on edge\\"‚Äîhe believed in controlling his fear and that, ultimately, he had a stronger motivation to fight than his enemy. He also claimed to take no pleasure in killing. During his interview with Vincent Browne, Browne asked him what his greatest regret was. After a pause, McGlinchey told him about a Protestant boy he had grown up with. The boy had joined the RUC and subsequently been killed by the IRA; \\"McGlinchey said he felt badly about that\\". The ex-volunteer who spoke to Dillon also discussed McGlinchey's approach to various aspects of his leadership. He commented, for example, with regard to McGlinchey's views on informers (\\"a bullet in the head‚Äîno messing\\"), drugs (not tolerated), civilian casualties (\\"he would just say it was war\\") and sectarianism (\\"he took the view that if they killed our people, we should strike back but he didn't spend his time going around saying \\"let's kill all the Prods\\"). He concludes that McGlinchey \\"was not a holy Joe, but his main targets were the British war machine\\". A Garda√≠ source told The Times, \\"he lived by the gun and died by the gun. He was not a man who was going to die in his bed of old age\\". McGlinchey saw himself similarly. In an interview with the Starry Plough, he commented‚Äîwhen asked what the effect of his death or capture would have‚Äîthat \\"the movement will not end with me. I‚Äôm only one individual, not God.\\" He also refuted that he had ever, or ever would, become a legend, telling a journalist \\"I'm no Che Guevara, just an ordinary Irish republican socialist who is determined to strive for a free socialist Ireland\\". O'Kane compared his and his wife's cooperation as having a \\"touch of Bonnie and Clyde\\" about them, she wrote. McGlinchey's falling out with the Provisionals in the late 1970s, commented an anonymous colleague, indicated that he could issue orders but was a very poor follower of them. Other ex-comrades have since described him as \\"volatile and impulsive\\", and his approach to man-management as \\"if you‚Äôre on the run you should be armed. If not, fuck off home.\\" Another called him a \\"cunning countryman [who] liked to manipulate others but did not like to be in overall responsibility\\". His treatment of popular and previously loyal INLA men such as Barkley convinced many of those under him that he would brook no dissent or questioning of his orders. The result was bad news for the INLA's cohesion, as paranoia and fear became widespread. to the extent that, when attending Army Council meetings, say Holland and McDonald, some members would only go armed. However, they also argue, it could never be said of McGlinchey, as it could of so many of his colleagues, that his struggle was motivated by personal gain: he was motivated solely by ideology. One such fellow traveller of McGlinchey's later described the INLA leader thus: > He wasn't the mad dog the media talked about. He was very focussed. People > would listen when he talked. He had a grasp of international politics and > often discussed the agendas of other revolutionary movements. He wanted to > see the INLA as part of an international socialist brigade. He was also a > hard man and when anyone stepped out of line‚ÄîGod help him or her. = Reputation = Christopher S. Morrison of the University of Wisconsin- Madison describes McGlinchey as earning \\"a personal reputation for sheer readiness to murder that no single republican figure of the Troubles has come close to challenging\\". A lieutenant general in the British Army, Maurice Robert Johnston, later described McGlinchey as a \\"lunatic\\", and more of an enemy to the British government than Martin McGuinness. McGlinchey not only lacked McGuinness's restraint, said Johnston, but would \\"shoot his own mother and all the rest of it\\". McGlinchey's \\"Mad Dog\\" nickname was given him by the security services‚Äîthe modern historian Ru√°n O'Donnell calls the term a \\"pejorative soubriquet\\"‚Äîwho considered him a \\"psycho\\". Dillon suggests that, in reality, the army did not consider him a mad dog but a \\"committed terrorist who had proved...dangerous and unpredictable\\", while the investigative journalist Mark Urban says McGlinchey had \\"driven the INLA into active and reasonably effective terrorism\\". The former INLA Chief of Staff‚Äîwho McGlinchey had failed to re-recruit in the late 1970s‚Äîlater told how he was ultimately deterred when he considered the direction McGlinchey wanted to take the group in. Holland and Mcdonald tell how‚Äîthe two men having shared a cell in Portlaoise for some time‚Äîthe ex-chief considered McGlinchey to be \\"unpredictable\\", and that his involvement increased the likelihood of a bloodbath at some point. A Garda who knew McGlinchey during his last term of imprisonment said that notwithstanding the urbane, academic facade McGlinchey adopted, he was still \\"a complete dictator\\" who wanted to dominate all around him. The label \\"Mad Dog\\", argue Holland and McDonald, is a misnomer: he was neither mad nor a dog. For example, they say, by the time of his death he was sufficiently well versed in the constitution‚Äîthe result of his studies in Portlaoise‚Äîto cogently argue against the Downing Street Declaration, which was being negotiated shortly before he died. Republicans tended to ignore the \\"Mad Dog\\" and \\"psycho\\" tags, which they deemed to part of what they believed to be a normal British propaganda campaign, albeit, says the author Gene Kerrigan, \\"in a cartoon fashion, as a bogeyman\\". Ackerman has argued that the fact McGlinchey was able to spend so long on the run demonstrates the level of support he enjoyed in the countryside. Another of McGlinchey's Portlaoise companions argued that he was comparable to the hero of a previous generation of republicans, O'Donovan Rossa, while the literary critic Richard Pine has called McGlinchey's career of violence part of the continuing republican theme, arguing that the \\"'religion of ecstasy' which carried Emmet, Pearse and Plunkett through the blood-sacrifice has also...sustained Terence McSwiney in 1920, the hunger-strikers in Long Kesh and sustain[ed] Dominic McGlinchey\\". McCann argued that McGlinchey \\"wasn't way out of line with, and can't be cast from, the mainstream history of nationalist Ireland\\". At his last trial, McGlinchey's defence counsel argued that, like thousands of others of his generation, \\"but for the fact that he was born in the community of South Derry, it is highly unlikely that he would ever be before any court\\". Holland and McDonald believed that McGlinchey would have known he would not meet with a peaceful death. On one occasion he stated his belief that \\"I will be remembered for nothing. I have no illusions about myself. There is no glory or anything to this. The only people who will remember me will be my family and particularly my children.\\" It is possible that the June 1993 assassination attempt had brought out a fatalistic quality in him, for during one interview he commented on his nickname, saying \\"what do you do with a Mad Dog except put it down?\\". Before his death, he told a local detective \\"you either hide or you go on living as long as you can\\". Vincent Browne asked McGlinchey what he thought would happen to him eventually. McGlinchey answered: > I will probably get shot. There is a good possibility of my not seeing the > end of the struggle. I could be lucky but just because I have been set up by > the media as the most wanted man in Ireland, I suppose that increases the > chances of my getting done in. But I don‚Äôt really give it a lot of thought, > I always try to avoid being shot. Cultural depictions alt=black and white photo of Edna O'Brien In the early 1990s novelist Edna O'Brien interviewed McGlinchey several times in Portlaoise while meticulously researching her novel House of Splendid Isolation. In the novel, the protagonist is an on-the-run republican terrorist named Roger McGreevy. Believing he has found an empty house to hole up in, he discovers an elderly woman in residence. The narrative explores the evolving relationship between the two, which moves from fear and distrust on her part to \\"a sort of mutual liking, even tenderness\\", writes the critic John Dunne, although noting that McGreevy \\"is no Mad Dog\\". The scholar Richard Bradford argues that the novel indicates a degree of \\"macabre\\" hero worship on behalf of O'Brien towards McGlinchey, upon whom scholars accept she generally based the character and who she treats with concomitant sympathy: McGreevy describes himself as seeking \\"Justice. Personal identity. Truth\\". Similarities between McGreevy and McGlinchey include their wives having been killed previously, both being interned at a young age and both spending their lives on the run. O'Brien, comments the researcher John Maher, \\"builds up, through the old woman‚Äôs interactions with McGreevy, an increasingly sympathetic picture of the terrorist [which] reflects O ‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs own strong republican sympathies\\". McGlinchey was an obvious source for O'Brien, suggests the critic Rebecca Pelan, because McGlinchey had already \\"deliberately imposed himself on public consciousness\\". O'Brien's interviews with McGlinchey were themselves notorious, and demonstrated her willingness to court controversy. O'Brien herself denied that the character was McGlinchey. She countered that, while \\"he certainly played a strong part in the people that talked to me\\", McGreevy was a composite of many different men. The central character of Martin McDonagh's 2001 black comedy‚Äîand \\"satire on sectarian violence\\"‚ÄîThe Lieutenant of Inishmore, Padraic, was based on the public image of McGlinchey, according to Morrison. Set against the backdrop of the early days of the Peace Process, \\"Mad Patrick\\" is stated to be a member of the INLA in 1993 Ireland. Padraic's activities involve pulling out the toenails of drug dealers, assassination and torture. Morrison, though, argues that \\"some of McDonagh‚Äôs information was derived from a highly inaccurate image of McGlinchey provided by sensationalist British and Irish newspaper reports at the time of the prolific murderer‚Äôs heyday\\", and argues that, unknowingly, McDonagh has reiterated this image. The author Henry McDonald, writing in The Guardian, agrees that Padraic \\"bears some comparison with the real life\\" of McGlinchey, as both are portrayed as being \\"too extreme even for the Provisional IRA\\". A 2007 Irish film reinterpretion of Macbeth‚Äîretitled Mickey B. and filmed in Maghaberry Prison‚Äîwas set against the backdrop of prison drug dealing. The murder of Macduff's family in act IV scene ii, comments the director Tom Magill, \\"draws heavily\\" on the 1987 murder of Mary McGlinchey while bathing her children. Magill later explained The central figure in Shane MacGown's 1997 song Paddy Public Enemy No. 1 is based on McGlinchey; when asked his opinion of him, MacGowan said \\"he was a great man\\". The Irish Brigade's ballad, \\"Hands Up, Trousers Down\\" referenced McGlinchey's treatment of the Garda√≠ while on the run.

History Barningham is listed in Domesday Book as a property owned in 1066 by a Saxon lord, Thor, prior to the Norman conquest; by 1086, the ownership had transferred to Enisant Musard, with Count Alan of Brittany as a tenant. Barningham is historically located in the North Riding of Yorkshire but along with the rest of the former Startforth Rural District it was transferred to County Durham for administrative and ceremonial purposes on 1 April 1974, under the provisions of the Local Government Act 1972. Amenities Barningham is a tranquil conservation village of around 60 houses. It has a large village green, a church, a stately hall occupied by a local landowning baronet, a village hall used by the Women's Institute and other local interest groups, and a tiny pub (no bar: they serve from the cellar). It is on the edge of moors stretching westwards to Cumbria and is a good base for walking the local dales and hills. The village has an enthusiastic local history society which runs a website and offers assistance to anyone trying to trace ancestors from the area.

It is centered at Clinton Avenue, and bounded roughly by Elizabeth Avenue in the east, Hawthorne Avenue in the south, Avon Avenue in the north, and Irvington in the west. Upper Clinton Hill is predominantly residential, with many of the homes also being the offices of professionals. Most retail activity along Clinton and Hawthorne Avenues is in the form of neighborhood-oriented convenience-type stores. Residents can patronize a shopping center on Chancellor Avenue near the Irvington border or one on nearby Springfield Ave. Nearest to the commercial streets, the housing is largely two- and three-family conversions, while the interior streets include many large, well-maintained single-family houses. To the south, near I-78, are several vacant and abandoned properties. There is some light industry in the southeastern part of the neighborhood. Hawthorne Hill is the southwest section of Upper Clinton Hill. The Hawthorne Hill/Upper Clinton Hill neighborhoods are served by the Newark Public Library's Madison branch. M&M;'s first factory was at 285 Badger Avenue in the neighborhood. It is now a vacant lot. Newark's highest concentration of vacant land and empty buildings can be found in the Lower Clinton Hill neighborhood. You can see whole blocks of vacant land, much of it cleared of all but a few clusters of older residences. Indeed, more than half the neighborhood is vacant land. There is some commercial activity along Avon Avenue and at the intersection of Peddie Street and Elizabeth Avenue and a scattering of small, convenience-oriented businesses on Clinton Avenue and Bergen Street. The Lower Clinton Hill neighborhood is served by the Newark Public Library's Clinton branch. History The name refers to the no-longer extant Clinton Township, Essex County, New Jersey, of which the neighborhood was once part. A three-block long street that extends from Runyon St. is called Tillinghast Street, believed named after Philip Tillinghast, who moved there in 1854 or early 1855 with his family of seven children from Manhattan. Philip was a well-to-do commission merchant and broker who worked in the Wall Street area and lived near fashionable Washington Square in the 1840s. As commercialization and immigration overtook such Dutch and English Old New York Protestant neighborhoods, wealthy families moved further uptown into free- standing mansions or townhouses made of newly discovered chocolate sandstone (Brownstone) from Paterson, New Jersey. St Andrews Others were influenced by writers like Andrew Jackson Downing and Davis who advocated villa living in semi-rural areas in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Staten Island, and the Orange area of New Jersey, where Llewellyn Park was created in West Orange. Tillinghast also joined the land speculators during this era to establish a suburban enclave of wealthy families in what was then East Orange. His home, thought to be called Hawthorn Hill, was located in this area (then a part of East Orange) with green spaces and punctuated by churches such as St. Andrews Episcopal and First Presbyterian on Clinton Ave. to serve the WASP (white Anglo-Saxon Protestant) population that inhabited the new neighborhood. Philip was ruined in the Panic of 1873. A daughter, Mary Elizabeth Tillinghast, was a famous embroidery and stained glass window artist (Grace Church, New-York Historical Society, St. Vincent's Hospital chapel) who had been a partner of John La Farge before going on her own. She moved back to NYC after Philip died in 1879, and lived at 3 N. Washington Square, near her old house. When she died in 1912, her studio was taken by Edward Hopper. Gradually, immigration spread out from Newark and surrounded this enclave, whose inhabitants moved further westward to West Orange (and St. Mark Episcopal church and 'new' Presbyterian church on Main Street). Left behind were mostly lower middle-class Ukrainian- Americans and Jewish-Americans. Now it is mostly lower-income African- American.

Geography and administration =Civic history= Bowes lies within the historic county boundaries of the North Riding of Yorkshire, but along with the rest of the former Startforth Rural District it was incorporated into the non-metropolitan county of Durham for administrative purposes on 1 April 1974, under the provisions of the Local Government Act 1972. The A66 and A67 roads meet at Bowes. History The Roman name for Bowes was Lavatrae. A Roman fort was located there, which was re-used as the site for Bowes Castle. The place-name 'Bowes' is first attested in a charter of 1148, where it appears as Bogas. This is the plural of the Old English boga meaning 'bow', probably signifying an arched bridge.Eilert Ekwall, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names, p.56. The village church is dedicated to St Giles. The only pub in the village, The Ancient Unicorn,The Ancient Unicorn is reputed to be haunted by several ghosts. This 17th-century coaching inn famously played host to Charles Dickens as he toured the local area. Dickens found inspiration in the village academy, which he immortalised as Dotheboys Hall in Nicholas Nickleby, and the graves of two of the people who inspired characters portrayed by the great author can be seen in Bowes churchyard to this day. William Shaw (1782-1850) was the headmaster of The Bowes Academy, and is said to have been the model for Wackford Squeers in Nicholas Nickleby ‚Äì they share the same initials. And George Ashton Taylor, who died in 1822 aged 19, apparently inspired Dickens to create the character of Smike in the same novel. From 1861 to 1962, the village was served by Bowes railway station. The village is also home to possibly the smallest former working men's club in the country. Now known as Bowes Social Club, it is run by volunteers and is often used as a venue to raise money for local events.

This is contrary to the custom of the men typically inviting the women to school dances such as prom in the spring and homecoming in the fall.  History  The Sadie Hawkins dance is named after the Li'l Abner comic strip character Sadie Hawkins, created by cartoonist Al Capp. In the strip, Sadie Hawkins Day fell on a given day in November (Capp never specified an exact date). The unmarried women of Dogpatch got to chase the bachelors and \\"marry up\\" with the ones that they caught. The event was introduced in a daily strip that ran on November 15, 1937. In 1939, Sadie Hawkins events were held at over 200 colleges, according to Life magazine.  Similar dance events  Similar dances, sometimes called Spinsters' Balls, have been organized for adults. The custom of holding Spinsters' Balls has spread outside the U.S., and exists in countries such as Australia. If held during the winter months, the Sadie Hawkins dance may be called the Snow Ball or some other wintry name. In a variation on pure Sadie Hawkins custom, a particular song may be designated a snowball dance by the DJ or master of ceremonies. In that case, also known as \\"speed dancing\\" (because of its similarities to speed dating), the DJ picks two people to start dancing, usually to a slow dance. Periodically the DJ will shout, \\"snowball,\\" signaling that the dancers must find new partners, thus increasing the number of partners on the floor. Half of the people asking new dancers to come to the floor will be girls asking boys, Sadie Hawkins-style. By the end of the song, most of the people at the dance are on the dance floor. The \\"snowball dance\\" is typically used to get the dancing started, as school dances can be notoriously slow to start. In some areas, people chosen to dance cannot refuse, thereby ensuring people get onto the dance floor, and thus the \\"snowball\\" gains momentum and grows. The Tolo Dance in the Pacific Northwest began several decades before Capp's comic strip. The word tolo comes from the University of Washington's Mortar Board, which began as an all-women's honor society called the \\"Tolo Club,\\" from the Chinook word for success and achievement. To raise funds, the group held a dance where women asked men.

The civil parish also includes the hamlet of Lane Head.  History  The name \\"Hutton Magna\\" translates to \\"large farm on a hill\\" with the word magna being the Latin word for \\"large\\", possibly to distinguish it from the hamlet of LIttle Hutton to the east. Known simply as Hutton, the village was recorded in the Domesday Book, with a population of 11 households. In 1870-72 John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales described Hutton Magna as: > \\"a village and a township in Teesdale district, and a parish partly also in > Richmond district, N.

Early life William deGarthe (1907-1983) was born Birger Edward Degerstedt in Kaskinen, also known as Kask√∂ (Swedish), a remote island town off the northwest coast of Finland. He was the son of Edward Degerstedt, a Swedish- speaking school principal and artist. The third-oldest in a family of five brothers, deGarthe was competitive and athletic but demonstrated an early aptitude for art. After graduating from high school with his strongest marks in art and drawing, deGarthe studied art in Helsinki while awaiting his call- up for active duty in the Finnish military.Pope, D. (1989). DeGarthe: His life, marine art and sculpture. Hantsport NS: Lancelot After his release from service, deGarthe obtained his passport ‚Äì declaring his profession as \\"artist\\"‚Äîand emigrated to Canada in the fall of 1926. Landing in Halifax, Nova Scotia, he boarded a train for Toronto, Ontario intending to join other expatriate Scandinavians in the northern Ontario forestry trade. The work was hard and the climate unforgiving; after only two months he left the woods bound for Montreal, Quebec. Virtually penniless, he made his way to a mission where he showed the supervisor some of his drawings. Impressed with the work and with the 19-year-old's determination, the man introduced deGarthe to a local publisher who hired him as an illustrator in January 1927 at a rate of $7 a week.Pope, D. (1989). DeGarthe: His life, marine art and sculpture. Hantsport NS: Lancelot It was around this time that the young artist changed his name from the Scandinavian Degerstedt to the French-sounding deGarthe. While continuing his work as a commercial artist, deGarthe continued his formal art studies in Montreal at the Museum of Fine Art under Edmond Dyonnet but the restless young man was still seeking something more. Declaring he was on a quest to find \\"the most beautiful spot on earth\\", in 1930 deGarthe quit his job in Montreal with the goal of sailing to Brazil to join an aunt there. He travelled by rail to Halifax to board a ship bound for South America but on disembarking he was struck by the similarity between Nova Scotia and the rugged seacoast of his native Finland. He later declared, \\"I didn't have to travel any farther.\\"Pope, D. (1989). DeGarthe: His life, marine art and sculpture. Hantsport NS: Lancelot. Page 28. Painting Soon after his arrival in Nova Scotia, deGarthe was introduced to Frank Wallace, a prominent Halifax marketing executive who immediately offered him a job as a commercial illustrator. deGarthe would continue to work for Wallace Advertising for the next 15 years before launching his own advertising company, deGarthe Advertising Art, in 1945; however, it was the onset of World War II that rekindled his passion for fine art. Biographer Douglas Pope recounts that when the Soviet Red Army invaded Finland in November 1939Alex, D. (2014). Winter war: Soviet Invasion of Finland timeline. In http://www.secondworldwarhistory.com/winter-war-soviet-invasion-of-finland.asp deGarthe was determined to return to his homeland to fight. With his four other sons already enlisted, Edward Degerstedt begged his middle child to stay in Canada. Inspired by the work of Alex Colville and other prominent Canadian war artists, deGarthe resolved to use his art to inspire others. Around 1940 he began painting under the tutelage of Leonard Brooks.Pope, D. (1989). DeGarthe: His life, marine art and sculpture. Hantsport NS: Lancelot. Over the next few years deGarthe would study oil painting under Stanley Royle at Mount Allison University in Sackville, New Brunswick. deGarthe later studied marine painting in Rockport, Massachusetts under Stanley Woodward, followed by Emile Gruppe in East Gloucester, Massachusetts and George Groz at the Art Students League in New York City. He also spent many winters studying in Europe at the Academie de la Grand Chaumiere in Paris as well as Acad√©mie Julian in Paris and the Accademie di Belle Arti in Rome.Ask Art Artists' Bluebook at http://www.askart.com/askart/d/william_edward_de_garthe/william_edward_de_garthe.aspx Throughout his career de Garthe worked in many mediums; however he is best known for his atmospheric oil paintings depicting scenes of life on and around the rugged Nova Scotia coast. He also completed works in charcoal, pen and ink, lithograph and fresco and, in later life, sculpture. Beginning in 1942 deGarthe taught commercial art at the Nova Scotia College of Art, now Nova Scotia College of Art and Design University (NSCAD), later teaching younger students at the city's YMCAs and YWCAs and at his own studio.Ask Art Artists' Bluebook at http://www.askart.com/askart/d/william_edward_de_garthe/william_edward_de_garthe.aspx deGarthe became a prominent member of the Nova Scotia arts community and a strong promoter of the province's artistic tradition. In the early forties he joined a lively \\"round table\\" of Halifax's most influential artists including gallery owners Marguerite and LeRoy Zwicker, prominent editorial cartoonist Robert Chambers, photographer Robert Norwood and war artist Brooks.Pope, D. (1989). DeGarthe: His life, marine art and sculpture. Hantsport NS: Lancelot. During his career deGarthe created a number of important works in oils, notable among them Looking for the Mothership, an evocative 1955 painting depicting a dory carrying a lone fisherman, searching for his lost home schooner. The same year, the Nova Scotia Museum of Fine Arts, now the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia, acquired its first deGarthe painting, Out of the Hurricane. In 1963, deGarthe created two large murals for St. John's Anglican Church in Peggy's Cove. The canvasses, 136 x 210 cm, depict a fishing boat on stormy seas with four fishers appearing to reach out to a figure of Christ on the water, surrounded by 12 gulls. deGarthe created Harvesting the Sea for a Nova Scotia Light and Power cover in 1966. (Detail) In 1970, deGarthe created what he considered to be his finest painting, Out of the Mist, a work Pope called a \\"simplified, condensed and more charged version of earlier themes\\", depicting a schooner in full sail emerging from the fog, seeming \\"to owe its existence to two worlds, the seen and the unseen, the world of fact and the world of fancy.\\" Pope, D. (1989). DeGarthe: His life, marine art and sculpture. Hantsport NS: Lancelot. Page 91. deGarthe refused to sell the painting and it remains on display in his Peggy's Cove gallery. In 1958, deGarthe exhibited 138 works at the Halifax Memorial Library in a show sponsored by the Nova Scotia Museum of Fine Arts, now the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia. In 1959 over 100 of his paintings were exhibited at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal. His painting \\"Approaching Storm\\" was voted most popular at the 1959 Maritime Art Exhibition at the Beaverbrook Art Gallery in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada. His work was also shown in Toronto, London, Florida and Barbados.Ask Art Artists' Bluebook at http://www.askart.com/askart/d/william_edward_de_garthe/william_edward_de_garthe.aspx deGarthe's work became popular among individual and corporate collectors; he sold his first painting to the Imperial Bank of Canada, now the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, in 1949. In 1951, Nova Scotia Light and Power Company, Limited (NSLP) commissioned deGarthe to paint a Nova Scotia seascape for the cover of its annual report. Pleased with the result, the artist and company would continue their relationship for another two decades. In all, deGarthe created 21 paintings for NSLP. Most depicted scenes of the Atlantic coast, including fishers at work and sailing vessels, but a series of four covers from 1953 to 1956 featured scenes of Halifax Harbour. Beginning in 1959, NSLP produced fine art prints of deGarthe's work which it made available at no cost upon request. For many years, framed copies of deGarthe's paintings for NSLP were a common sight in Nova Scotia homes and offices.Nova Scotia Light and Power Company, Limited. Annual Reports (1951-1972). deGarthe authored and illustrated three books: This is Peggy's Cove Nova Scotia (1956), Painting the Sea (1969), and The Story of the Herring Gull: Larus Argentatus (1977). Sculpture Fishermen's Monument at Peggy's Cove, Nova Scotia, Canada by William Edward deGarthe. Carved on-site from granite in-situ. (detail) In 1962, deGarthe wintered in Florida where he studied sculpture under the direction of Leslie Thomas Posey (1900-?) at the Longboat Key Center for the Arts. He later studied sculpting in marble at Pietrasanta in Tuscany. In the late 1970s, deGarthe began a ten-year project to sculpt a \\"lasting monument to Nova Scotia fishermen\\" on a 30 m (100 ft) granite outcropping behind his Peggy's Cove Home. In 1976 deGarthe invited one of his students, J. Rene Barrette (Lt. Col. Retd) to help him with the sculpture. They worked together for 5 years. The project was about 80-per cent complete when the artist died in 1983.Nova Scotia Archives: https://novascotia.ca/archives/virtual/degarthe/default.asp?Language=English With deGarthe's approval, Rene Barrette documented their progress on the sculpture in journals that were printed and sold to tourists who gathered around to watch the two artists at work. The work depicts thirty-two fishermen and their wives and children enveloped by the wings of the guardian angel St. Elmo. It also features the image of Peggy, a legendary late-18th century shipwreck survivor deGarthe believed gave her name to the village. deGarthe bequeathed the sculpture to the province of Nova Scotia and it can be viewed in a park located behind his former home.St. Margaret's Bay Regional Tourism Development Association: http://www.peggyscoveregion.com/peggys-cove-area- things-to-do-visit-degarthe-museum/ deGarthe gallery deGarthe's Peggy's Cove home has been transformed into The William E. deGarthe Gallery where 65 of his paintings and sculptures are on permanent exhibition. It is open from May 1 until October 31 each year. The gallery is part of the Nova Scotia Museum network. Although none of the works at the gallery is for sale, the North Shore Historic Art Gallery in nearby Lunenburg carries deGarthe's work. A permanent display of deGarthe painting is exhibited at the Nova Scotia Archives in Halifax. His works are also in the collection of the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia and the Barbados Museum as well as numerous private collections around the world. Personal life deGarthe became a Canadian citizen in 1934. In 1935 he met weaver and editor Phoebe Agnes Payne (1906-2008) at a house party and within a few months they married. In 1931 deGarthe visited Peggy's Cove, a rugged and picturesque fishing village near Halifax, for the first time. Inspired by the community's stark beauty, deGarthe and his wife bought a summer home there in 1948. He was to visit there frequently to paint and exhibit his work. In 1955 deGarthe closed his city advertising business and moved to Peggy's Cove permanently. He would remain there for the rest of his life, rebuilding his studio after it was destroyed by Hurricane Ginny in 1963. deGarthe and his wife were seasoned travellers, spending winters in the Caribbean and Florida, and visiting Spain, Portugal, Italy, Africa, and the Galapagos Islands among other places. In 1975, 35 years after he first embarked for Brazil, he finally reached Rio de Janeiro where the sight of the statue of Christ the Redeemer inspired him to create his own monument in stone in Peggy's Cove. Health problems in the last years of his life slowed deGarthe's progress on the Fishermen's Monument. He suffered a heart attack in 1979 and was diagnosed with cancer in 1982. He died in a Toronto hospital on February 13, 1983. His funeral was held at Peggy's Cove and his ashes interred inside the Fishermen's Monument.Pope, D. (1989).

Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Law. riot gun n: a small arm used to disperse rioters rather than to inflict serious injury or death; especially : a short- barreled shotgun The riot shotgun is used by military personnel for guard duty and was at one time used for riot control, and is commonly used as a door breaching and patrol weapon by law enforcement personnel, as well as a home defense weapon by civilians. Guns of this type are often labeled as breaching shotguns, tactical shotguns or special-purpose shotguns to denote the larger scope of their use; however, these are largely marketing terms. Characteristics Hatsan Escort Magnum, security and law enforcement purpose12 gauge semi-automatic shotgun The primary characteristic of a riot shotgun is a \\"short\\" barrel (generally 14 to 20\\" long; 18\\" is the shortest length available in the U.S. that is not subject to additional federal BATFE regulation, though such restrictions are rarely a problem for police departments and thus shorter-barrel shotguns are not uncommon among police) which makes the shotgun more compact and easier to handle, easier to stow inside a police vehicle, and more suitable for quick aiming at (close) stationary targets. Generally they have an open (cylinder-bore) choke, to permit the shot to spread quickly and to allow use with other types of projectiles, and they may be equipped with bead, rifle, or ghost-ring sights. Riot guns are most often pump-action due to this design's lower cost and higher reliability, although in recent years a number of semi-automatic shotguns designed primarily for defensive use have become available and are used by military, law enforcement and civilians alike. Most riot guns are chambered in 12-gauge and can handle either 2.75\\" \\"standard-length\\" or 3\\" \\"magnum\\" cartridges. Most non-shotshell loads, such as less lethal ammunition like bean bags, are made only in 12-gauge. However, 20-gauge and .410 shotguns in riot gun configuration are available. Smaller bores are popular for home defense, as the reduced power and recoil make them more suitable for less experienced shooters who may be more recoil-sensitive. While most hunting shotguns hold between 2 and 5 shells (often 3 shells, to comply with U.S. regulations for migratory bird hunting), riot shotguns can have a magazine tube as long as the barrel, allowing for 6 to 10 shells to be loaded depending on the model, barrel length, and type of shells loaded. Standard capacity magazine tubes are also used on riot shotguns. For example, the popular Remington 870 Police model riot shotgun often ships and is used with the stock 4 round magazine tube by Law Enforcement personnel. Configurations of grips and stocks for riot shotguns vary widely, but often feature reinforced plastic \\"furniture\\" instead of the wood common on hunting firearms. Wood was used for riot gun stocks in the past, and sometimes still is. As compared to hunting shotguns, riot guns more often feature pistol grips, with or without a shoulder stock. Without a shoulder stock (or with a folding stock), a riot shotgun becomes more compact and thus is able to be brought to bear more rapidly in very close quarters. With the stock, the pistol grip facilitates control of the weapon and provides a more ergonomic grip when the shotgun is fired from the shoulder. Foregrips, or forends, also vary, often with the inclusion of a pistol-grip fore-end (further increasing control and absorbing recoil), and/or the addition of an accessory rail or other mounting point for a tactical light. The multiple projectile ability of a shotgun greatly increases the probability of a hit on an assailant, and the multiple projectiles increase the likelihood of a disabling hit. Though many sizes and configurations of shotshell are used by police, among the most common is the 12-gauge 2-inch (70 mm) 00 (\\"double-aught\\") buckshot shell, which consists of 8 or 9 .33 caliber (8.5 mm) round lead balls, each of which is similar in size and velocity to a 9mm/.38 caliber handgun bullet (which actually have a diameter of .354-.357\\"). This shot spreads out to a greater or lesser degree depending on the barrel choke, and can be effective at ranges as far as 75 yards (70 m). Also popular is the #4 buckshot load, which sacrifices individual pellet size (each pellet is about .24 caliber) for greater numbers (usually 21 pellets per shell) and is very effective at most indoor ranges (<50 feet), where the shot has less distance in which to scatter and thus hits the target in a relatively localized pattern. \\"Deer slugs\\" (1 oz rifled slugs) provide a powerful, accurate shot with minimal spread, but more risk of overpenetration. \\"Hybrid\\" loads combining different sizes of shot, or a slug and shot, are available but less common. These cartridges generally advertise a compromise or \\"best of both worlds\\" between the power of slugs or buckshot and the spread of smaller pellets. The delivery of the large number of projectiles simultaneously makes the shotgun the most effective short range weapon commonly used, with a hit probability 45% greater than a submachine gun, and twice as great as an assault rifle. The ability to use shotgun slugs extends the range and penetration capability of the shotgun. Police officers in the US commonly secure a shotgun in their vehicles, for use when armed resistance is expected or at any time greater firepower than the officer's sidearm is needed. Riot vs. combat shotguns The difference between the riot shotgun and the combat shotgun is blurry, and may be more a matter of application than design. A combat shotgun would be used in military combat situations as a primarily offensive weapon, where a riot shotgun would be used in law enforcement or civilian situations as a primarily defensive weapon. Common additions to a combat shotgun would be provision for attaching a bayonet, and the addition of a ventilated heat shield over the barrel (though this heat shield is a common addition to riot shotguns as well) designed to prevent the operator's fingers from being burned by a barrel heated by multiple shots, and thus to allow the operator to secure a full grip on the weapon while using the attached bayonet, even when the barrel is far too hot to touch (otherwise, there is little reason to enshroud the barrel and hinder the cooling airflow). One or both of these features can be seen on many military long-arms, including the 1903 Springfield, the SMLE, M1 Garand, and Mauser rifles, to name some of the more obvious types. The U.S. Army specifications for shotguns require a metal trigger guard for durability, which reduces the number of \\"special purpose\\" models used by police that would also be suitable for the military (the Mossberg 590A1 and Benelli M1014 are the standard-issue pump and semi-auto shotguns currently in service; the standard Mossberg 500 and 590 models, and most variants of the Remington 870, have plastic trigger groups). Riot shotguns are also more limited in range than combat shotguns by the nature of their use. A combat shotgun is considered effective out to 75 yards (70 m) because on average at least 1 pellet of a 9 pellet 00 buckshot load will hit a human sized target at that range. This is enough to degrade the combat effectiveness of an enemy soldier, but it is not enough to reliably disable an assailant in a defensive situation. For that, there must be multiple hits to the target, enough that one or more pellets will hit a vital region. Generally this is well under 27 yards (25 meters) with a cylinder bore barrel. Beyond this range, slugs and good iron sights are recommended, extending the range to over 109 yards (100 meters). Less lethal alternatives Two rounds of Fiocchi 12 gauge rubber buckshot The latter part of the 20th century saw a new role for the riot shotgun, with the advent of a wide variety of less lethal ammunition for police use. These vary from the early \\"bean bag\\" shooting flexible baton rounds, rubber bullets and other impact munitions, to tear gas and, released in October 2009, a 12 gauge electroshock weapon from TASER International. Using the shotgun as the delivery system allows the officers to quickly choose a lethal or a less lethal weapon, so responding officers can adapt to changing situations; An officer in a standoff can quickly eject a chambered buckshot cartridge and replace it with a less-lethal cartridge such as a bean bag, and is not required to unload the magazine as with most rifles or handguns. Alternatively, one officer can be equipped with less lethal munitions, while others, equipped with buckshot, can provide a backup in case the less lethal rounds fail to stop the target. Entry and breaching shotguns H&K; Fabarm FP6 Entry - features a 14\\" barrel and is subject to regulation under the National Firearms Act in the U.S. The entry shotgun or breaching shotgun is a role that can be filled by a standard riot shotgun, or one further modified for these purposes. They may have an extremely short barrel (14\\" or less) and often only a pistol grip rather than a buttstock, or a folding or collapsing buttstock if it is provided with one. In addition, the barrel often has a muzzle brake, used to disperse hot gases that might otherwise be deflected toward the shooter. This type of shotgun is designed to fire special breaching rounds which are designed to disable or destroy door latches while limiting overpenetration of the projectiles used beyond the door. Since these shotguns would in most areas be classified as short barreled shotguns, they are highly restricted under gun control laws such as the National Firearms Act and generally only used by police and military. has pictures of Remington \\"Entry\\" and \\"Breaching\\" modelsPicture of a Mossberg 500 Tactical Cruiser, with a special breaching barrel with stand-off device on the muzzle Usage A policeman with a pellet shotgun during a clash with violent protesters in Kashmir in September 2017. Pellet shotguns are used as the last \\"non-lethal\\" resort by security forces for crowd control in Jammu and Kashmir. In 2006, during anti-corruption protests in Budapest (Hungary) some people were hit on the head by shotgun-fired bean bag rounds. At least 3 of them have been blinded. One man committed suicide in 2013 because he could not live with the blindness. In addition, many people suffered minor injuries (nose and finger fractures, hemorrhagic bruises), a few patient needed permanent psychological help because of the shock. Pellet shotguns have been used in Bahrain, Egypt and Tunisia for breaking up protests. Since 2010, in the Indian state of Jammu Kashmir, police forces have used pellet shotguns (known locally as pellet guns or pump action guns) as a 'non-lethal' defensive crowd control measure against violent, stone pelting mobs in the region. The usage of pellet shotguns in Jammu and Kashmir has been widely criticised. In the United States of America, the use of shotguns by police officers is in decline. Many agencies have adopted patrol rifles for increased precision and better range when compared to shotguns. However, many agencies retain the shotguns for use by newer officers and for less-lethal munitions.

Culture and community  One of Ovington's distinguishable landmarks is a 60ft high maypole situated on the village green and an intgral part of the village's annual May Day celebrations. The original maypole was erected in 1897 to commemorate the diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria, it became a grade II listed structure in 1987, in 2006 the pole was replaced after costs to maintain the original structure had become too high, in November 2015, high winds caused the maypole to snap however by September 2016 it had been replaced, and sections of the former maypole were crafted into benches on the green. The village has one public house, The Four Alls, which dates back over 200 years, and a village hall, in which the parish council conducts their meetings.

As of 2012 the population was 4,896. A small medieval town situated in the historical Warmia region, Reszel possesses many architecturally-renowned monuments and various attractions. The gothic castle, the main square and the core surrounded by brick defense walls are very popular among incoming tourists. History The castle ca. 1833 Reszel was originally a settlement built by the Bartian tribe of Old Prussians and conquered by the Teutonic Knights in 1241. The native Prussians later recaptured the settlement and held it for five years, but were eventually defeated by the German crusaders. Reszel received its town privileges in 1337 under Che≈Çmno Law. After the Polish victory in the Battle of Grunwald in 1410, the town was briefly captured by Poles led by King W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço. In 1440 the town joined the anti-Teutonic Prussian Confederation, and upon its request in 1454 Polish King Casimir IV Jagiellon signed the act of incorporation of the region along with Reszel to Poland,Karol G√≥rski, ZwiƒÖzek Pruski i poddanie siƒô Prus Polsce: zbi√≥r tekst√≥w ≈∫r√≥d≈Çowych, Instytut Zachodni, Pozna≈Ñ, 1949, p. XXXVII, 54 (in Polish) an event that sparked the Thirteen Years' War. In 1455 the Teutonic Knights captured the town and later on, in 1462, ceded their power to the Warmian bishop, who once more in 1464 recognized the Polish King as the rightful ruler of Warmia with Reszel. The incorporation of Reszel to the Kingdom of Poland was confirmed in a peace treaty signed in Toru≈Ñ in 1466.G√≥rski, p. 99 In the 17th century, the Jesuits came to Reszel and established a college in 1632 and the Polish King John II Casimir Vasa created a scholarship fund for its students. In 1772 Reszel was annexed by Prussia in the First Partition of Poland, and became part of the Prussian Partition of Poland. In the late 18th century the local parish priest was Marcin Krasicki, and he was often visited by his brother Ignacy Krasicki, leading Polish Enlightenment poet and prince-bishop of Warmia. In 1811 Barbara Zdunk was sentenced by the Prussian court to death for witchcraft and setting the castle alight in 1807. The trial is sometimes described as the last burning of witches in Europe. From 1871 the town was part of Germany and as a result of the treaty of Versailles on 11 July 1920 the 1920 East Prussian plebiscite was organized under the control of the League of nations, which resulted in 3,260 votes to remain in Germany and none for Poland, which just regained independence. Following the Potsdam Conference of 1945, just after the Second World War, the town was transferred from Germany back to Poland. Tourist attractions The main tourist attraction is the Gothic Episcopal castle. It was built 1350‚àí1401 on a steep hill side above the right bank of the river Sajna by the Teutonic Order. The Gothic St Peter's Church dating back to the 14th century boasts the painting of the church's patron dating back to the end of the 18th century. Other worthy of note buildings are the Jesuit complex, St John's Church and the church and convent of the nuns of the Order of St Catherine ‚àí all from the 15th and the 16th century. Large fragments of preserved defensive walls and the Classicist town hall in the market square dating back to the 19th century are also worth visiting.

Howard Hughes' Hughes Aircraft Company formed the Aerospace Group within the company when they bought the facility in 1955,History of El Secundo Boeing facility when the Nash company became American Motors Corporation and divided the facility into: * Hughes Space and Communications Group * Hughes Space Systems Division In 1953 the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) was formed, and Hughes Aircraft reformed as a subsidiary of the foundation. The charity status of the foundation allowed Hughes Aircraft to avoid taxes on its huge income. In 1961 the two Aerospace Group divisions were reformed as Hughes Space and Communications Company. Hughes Space and Communications Company launched the first geosynchronous communications satellite, Syncom, in 1963. On April 5, 1976 Howard Hughes died at the age of 70, leaving no will. In 1984 the Delaware Court of Chancery appointed eight trustees of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, who decided to sell Hughes Aircraft to General Motors for $5.2 billion‚Äîthis transaction was completed in 1985.

In 1997 GM transferred Delco Electronics from Hughes Electronics to its Delphi Automotive Systems and later in the year sold the aerospace and defense operations of Hughes Electronics (Hughes Aircraft) to Raytheon. Hughes Space and Communications Company remained independent until 2000, when it was purchased by Boeing and became Boeing Satellite Development Center.

Jackson, Julianne Moore, Edie Falco, Ron Eldard, William Forsythe, Aunjanue Ellis, and Anthony Mackie. It is based on Richard Price's 1998 novel of the same name, which touches on themes of covert racism. Plot Brenda (Julianne Moore) walks through a predominantly African American housing project and enters an emergency room, apparently in shock and with cut and bleeding hands. Police detective Lorenzo Council (Samuel L. Jackson) is sent to take a statement from Brenda, who says that her car has been stolen. When Lorenzo gets there, she reveals that her young son, Cody, was in the back seat of the car. The police frantically begin searching for Cody. Brenda's brother, Danny (Ron Eldard), a police officer in a neighboring town, calls a massive police presence in to search the housing project for clues. This angers the residents who protest their innocence. Lorenzo begins to suspect that Brenda is holding back details from him and pressures her to tell the truth. She insists that she has told the truth and would never harm her son. With a sketch artist she produces a picture of the man she says stole her car. Danny's white coworkers arrest a man from the housing project who they think matches the picture. Danny flies into a rage and beats him. Desperate to find Cody, Lorenzo enlists the aid of a volunteer group which helps search for missing children. He suggests that they search Freedomland, an abandoned foundling hospital nearby. As they search, the group's leader Karen Collucci (Edie Falco) talks with Brenda. Collucci had lost her own son years before and convinces Brenda to admit that Cody is dead. She leads them to a nearby park where they find Cody's body in a shallow grave, covered with heavy rocks. Lorenzo realizes that Brenda could not have moved the rocks herself. Under interrogation Brenda admits to having been engaged in an affair with a man named Billy (Anthony Mackie) who lived in the projects. She would give Cody cough syrup so that he would fall asleep and she could visit Billy. On the night in question she had returned to find Cody dead, having drunk a whole bottle of cough syrup. Billy helped her bury his body. When the police go to arrest Billy, they are confronted by residents angry over previous unfounded police harassment and a riot erupts. Brenda is charged with criminal neglect, and Lorenzo promises to visit her in jail. Cast Production Shooting took place mostly in Yonkers, New York. Reception On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 23% based on 151 reviews. The consensus states: \\"Poorly directed and overacted, Freedomland attempts to address sensitive race and class issues but its overzealousness misses the mark.\\" On Metacritic it has a score of 43% based on 35 reviews.

A cook is sometimes referred to as a chef, although in the culinary world, the terms are not interchangeable. Cooks' responsibilities include preparing food, managing food stations, cleaning the kitchen, and helping the chefs. Restaurants will give a title to the cooks according to their designated stations. Examples are broiler cooks, fry cooks, pantry cooks, and sauce cooks.A cook at work (15th- or 16th-century German illustration) History  In 776 BC, Coroebus of Elis who won the Ancient Olympic Games in a sprint race was also a cook. In the Middle Age of Northern France (around 9th-15th century), being a cook was a known profession in the community. In a sense, cooks were acknowledged as trained craftsmen. Taillevent wrote in the Le Viandier- a classic recipe collection in Medieval France- that he underwent different levels of training such as being an apprentice and journeyman before he acquired a master grade. The master or queu attained knowledge passed from one generation to another. Georges Auguste Escoffier (1846-1935) described cook in the Brigade De Cuisine as the Cuisinier. They help the top levels in the hierarchy, such as chefs, and prepare specific dishes. = Ming China = During the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), the profession of cook was one that served, on the most part, the upper echelons of society, serving the likes of merchants, officials and landlords. E.N. Anderson, ‚ÄúInvolution: Late Imperial China.‚Äù, The Food of China. (Yale University Press, 1988), pp. 94-123. The development of the culinary world in China during the Ming dynasty, due to the new ‚ÄòNew World‚Äô crops, such as maize, potatoes, and chilis, created an environment which led to a new and quality foods being accessible to more and more people in Ming China.Moll-Murata, Christine. ‚ÄúWork Ethics and Work Valuations in a Period of Commercialization: Ming China, 1500-1644.‚Äù International Review of Social History, vol. 56, 2011, pp. 165‚Äì195. The new variety in foods on offer to cooks even led to various instruction manuals and recipe books on food preparation.E.N. Anderson, ‚ÄúChina.‚Äù Food in Time and Place: The American Historical Association Companion to Food History, edited by Paul Freedman et al., 1st ed., (University of California Press, Oakland, California, 2014), pp. 41‚Äì67.  Cook Employment  The Cooks that prepared and cooked the food for those of the Chinese population that were in the upper echelons of society and therefore could afford it, would operate through inns, restaurants and even by roaming the streets as a street vendor, thus offering customers a variety of options. However, despite the growing variety of foods and food sellers in Ming China, the services of most of the professional cooks was reserved for the elite class. The Court was an extremely large employer of cooks throughout the entirety of the Ming dynasty, with over 9,000 cooks employed in the 15th Century, the cooks in the employment of the court would be expected to provide for around 10,000 to 15,000 people on a daily basis, including providing them all with wine. Aside from just cooking food to be eaten, the court also employed around 1,800 cooks to prepare sacrifices and offerings for rituals, around 200,000 animals were sacrificed yearly, including vast amounts of geese, pigs, and sheep. Cooks would provide meals for merchants and landlords as well, but, they weren‚Äôt employed at the same high rate as the cooks employed by the court. The merchants and landlords who could afford the luxury of personally cooked food by a professional chef could usually expect a great quality and even extremely skill-heavy and laborious types of cooking, for example baking and sugar animals. This exclusivity of cooks for the rich associated the profession and its work with the greed and gluttony of the elite classes, so, often private food preparation with cooks would be connected with evil or villainy.  Status of cooks  The cooks in Ming China, as mentioned before, was only available to be utilised by the very wealthy. Despite the exclusive nature of the job and the status levels of those they prepared food for, the occupation of the cook during Ming times was not a highly coveted profession due to the amount of animal killing involved with being a cook. The negative karma associated with killing the sentient living beings, and then using this as a means of making a living, makes the profession of cook one that was described to be avoided. The nature of a cooks work and the religious values of Taoism and Buddhism clash heavily, reinforcing this idea of a cook being an undesirable occupation, furthermore, cooks were known to request the safe passage of their slaughtered animals to the Pure Land through Amitabha. Despite the various negative aspects associated with the cook profession in Ming China, there were still some positives for it, being a cook required a certain level of skill and to a certain extent it was artisanal, demanding fine tuning of skills and finesse, which in turn earnt the profession of cook and other similar professions respect amongst their peers.  Recipe Books  Cooks in Ming China could learn their trade through the multitude of recipe books and herbal guides that was published during the Ming Dynasty.Yong Chen ‚ÄúTHE CHINESE BRILLAT-SAVARIN.‚Äù Chop Suey, USA: The Story of Chinese Food in America, (Columbia University Press, 2014), pp. 153‚Äì172. These books and guides were published as a way to promote individual health, and mostly dealt with the health benefits of foods and yangsheng(ÂÖªÁîü), meaning ‚Äònourish life‚Äô. An example of one of these Recipe books is titled the Old Glutton‚Äôs Collection (Laotao ji ËÄÅÈ•ïÈõÜ), written by Zhang Dai.Campbell, Duncan. ‚ÄúThe Obsessive Gourmet: Zhang Dai on Food and Drink.‚Äù Scribes of Gastronomy: Representations of Food and Drink in Imperial Chinese Literature, edited by Isaac Yue and Siufu Tang, Hong Kong University Press, 2013, pp. 87‚Äì96. Zhang Dai not only provided recipes for guidance, he also wrote about the connections between food and health as well as the relationship to class levels and food  Salary & Economics Value  Based on the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of work opportunities for cooks is expected to go up by 6 percent during the time period of 2016 to 2026. In 2016, the number of jobs for a cook was at 2,403,000. The rate is projected to increase slower than food preparation workers, bakers, and chefs (all of which are projected to increase by at least 8 percent from 2016 to 2026).A group of professional and aspiring cooks in a hotel kitchen (1990) In addition, cooks earn about $22,850 a year, which is about $10.99 an hour. As of October 2017, the average income for cooks was around C$33,400 a year. As of 2018 cooks in Australia earn about AU$20.48 for every hour of work.  Education  = United States = There is not a strict set of achievements that one must accomplish before one can become a cook. There are institutions that provide culinary programs, such as vocational cooking schools. There are mandatory lessons that cover topics such as food safety, sanitation, hospitality, and advanced cooking. This will last for less than two years to four years. It is also known that some cooks receive their education through culinary apprenticeships that can be sponsored by professional culinary institutes or trade unions. Apprenticeships usually have a duration of one year and provide on-the-job experience along with technical training. Based on the American Culinary Federation, the minimum requirements for entering such programs include being 17 years old and having a high school diploma or equivalent. Should they seek out a promotion to higher level culinary professions, they may get a culinary certification that proves them to have at least two years of job experience and basic knowledge of kitchen skills. = United Kingdom = GCSE in English and Maths could help individuals who are interested in becoming cooks. However, it is more valuable if they experienced apprenticeship or training in any culinary institution or courses. There are certain colleges from different areas that provide training and development programs. Among these are Wales, England, and Northern Ireland. Examples of certificate or diploma available are Diploma in Introduction to Professional Cookery, Certificate in General Cookery, and Diploma in Food Production and Cooking.  Health Concerns  There are various health concerns that arise from working in a kitchen. Cooks who deal with uncooked meat have the chance to catch food-borne illnesses. Additionally, cooks are at risk of breathing in and touching chemical products such as bleach and glass cleaner. Two other potential concerns are the risk of getting injured from the use of sharp objects, or from touching hot surfaces. Another possible health danger is that cooks could fall due to wet and slick floors.  Regional Differences  = Middle East = Professional cooks in the Middle East are predominantly men. Because of religious restrictions (except for a small amount of Christian- based groups), cooks typically refrain from using pork to make meals while lamb and chicken are the standard meats used. Then, the meat will be served with either bread or rice. According to Jill Eversole Nolan, there is a high percentage of Middle Easterners that are lactose intolerant which is why dairy is not frequently used when eating meals. Cattle are frequently used for carrying or moving items and are to only be used for food when there is no other purpose for them. Even then, beef is not easy to use as a food source and are served in chunks, either dried, raw, or cooked. On the other hand, eggplants are easy to buy off the streets and are highly used by Middle Eastern cooks with over 40 dishes prepared while just using the main ingredient. = Mexico = Mexican cooks make a strong point to respect the dishes they make and that these dishes reflect their ‚Äúheritage\\" and \\"soul.\\" The amount of passion they have directly tied into how well their food comes out and how flavorful it may be. Cooks will often haggle and buy their ingredients from street markets while their corn tortillas are either handmade (which is considerably time-consuming) or bought from tortillerias. Mexican cuisine has been influenced by French invaders and integrates both styles in their food. Cr√™pes, or crepas, as they are called in Mexico, were introduced to them by the French invaders and are widely used for various dishes.

He was born at Lubersac and died at Versailles. After long service in the French Royal Army, he was elected to lead a volunteer battalion in 1792 during the French Revolution. He was promoted to general of division in September 1793 after playing a prominent role in the defense of Dunkirk. In May 1794 with his commander absent, he took temporary command of the Army of the North and defeated the Coalition army at Tourcoing. He led the covering forces at the Siege of Ypres and participated in the successful invasion of the Dutch Republic. He spent many years in occupation duties in Holland and then his career suffered because of his association with Pichegru and Moreau. Starting in 1809 he was employed in Spain during the Peninsular War, winning the Battle of Vich where he was wounded. In army command again, he forced Wellington's army to retreat at Tordesillas in 1812. The following year he led a division at L√ºtzen and a corps at Leipzig. He remained loyal to the Bourbons during the Hundred Days. French revolutionary years Coats of arms of Joseph Souham Souham served in the Royal French army as a private from 1782 to 1790. In 1792, having shown himself active in the cause of the Revolution, he was elected chef de bataillon of a volunteer battalion from the Corr√®ze. He served with his unit at the Battle of Jemappes. By 1793, Souham had risen to the rank of g√©n√©ral de division during the Flanders Campaign. When his army commander, Jean-Charles Pichegru fell ill, Souham assumed army command and defeated the Allied army at the Battle of Tourcoing in May 1794. He served under Pichegru in Holland (1795), but in 1799 he fell into disgrace on suspicion of being involved in Royalist intrigues. He was reinstated in 1800 and served under Jean Moreau in the Danube campaign of that year. During the French Consulate he appears to have been involved in conspiracies and was suspected with his old commanders Moreau and Pichegru of participation in the plot of Georges Cadoudal. Empire and later years He was unemployed from 1800 to 1809. In the latter year a shortage of available experienced officers caused him to be put back on active duty. He was sent to Spain where he took a notable part in Gouvion St Cyr's operations in Catalonia. The actions at Vic in which he was wounded won him the title of comte de l'empire. When Marshal Marmont had been wounded at the Battle of Salamanca in 1812, Marshal Andr√© Mass√©na, who was unable to assume the post himself, recommended Souham for the post. The latter was thus pitted against Wellington, and by skilful maneuvers drove the allied general back from Burgos and regained the ground lost at Salamanca. In January 1813, he was recalled to France. In 1813, he took command of a division in Marshal Michel Ney's III Corps. At L√ºtzen he greatly distinguished himself. Faced by the bulk of the combined Russian and Prussian armies, he bitterly defended the area around Gross-Gorschen. At the Battle of Leipzig he was wounded while leading III Corps. After the fall of the First Empire he deserted the emperor and, having suffered for the Royalist cause, was well received by Louis XVIII, who gave him high commands. These honors Souham lost at the return of Napoleon and were regained once more after the Second Restoration. He retired in 1832, and died on 28 April 1837 in Versailles.

He did most of his work in Southern California, especially in San Diego and Los Angeles. He is considered a pioneer of the modern movement in architecture. Twelve of his buildings throughout Southern California are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and many others are designated as historic by local governments. Early life Gill was born on April 26, 1870, in Tully, New York to Joseph and Cynthia Scullen Gill. His father was a farmer, and later a carpenter. As a child, Gill attended the Madison Street School in Syracuse. By 1889, Gill was working as a draftsman under Ellis G. Hall in Syracuse. Then, in 1890, he moved to Chicago to work with Joseph Lyman Silsbee, who was Hall's partner years prior. Finally, in 1891, Gill went to Adler and Sullivan. His apprenticeship there coincided with several import Chicago School architects including Frank Lloyd Wright. While there, he worked on the Transportation Building, an exhibition hall at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. Long after his death it was claimed that Gill never saw the end of that project due to illness. The veracity of this claim has never been documented and is highly unlikely. In 1893, the year of the Fair, he moved to San Diego to open his own architectural practice. Career Once in San Diego, Gill's health improved, and he began an architectural practice of his own. Though he was reported to have been working around this time, records of his projects were not well preserved. In 1894, Gill partnered with Joseph Falkenham, who had built a successful practice of his own. The two formed a firm named \\"Falkenham & Gill, the Architects\\", and completed several projects, including some large commercial buildings. Falkenham left San Diego in 1895, and Gill began to take on large residential projects for important figures in San Diego. He also worked on the Granger Hall for Ralph Granger, a local musician. In the late 1890s, Gill's designs began to use concrete more heavily, and his work in that medium contributed significantly to its use in the future. In 1896, he formed a partnership with William S. Hebbard. The Hebbard & Gill firm was known for work in the Tudor Revival and later the Prairie School styles. The George W. Marston House (now a museum) was their most famous project. In this period, Gill trained Hazel Wood Waterman who helped with a group of houses built near Balboa Park for socialites Alice Lee and Katherine Teats. Waterman later went on to become an architect with her own practice. After California passed a law requiring architects to obtain a certificate in 1901, Gill was automatically granted a certificate because his practice was already in operation. In 1903, Gill was appointed to a special seat on a Chamber of Commerce committee to build the U.S. Grant Hotel, which was ultimately designed by Harrison Albright, despite Hebbard & Gill's submission of designs to the committee. In 1907, Gill was accused of unauthorized work on a sewer line, causing a clog. Gill denied the accusations, but his partnership with Hebbard was damaged beyond repair. Less than a month later, Gill entered into a partnership with Frank Mead, who had been a Hebbard & Gill employee. The partnership lasted seven months, and completed only a few houses. Gill designed the Broadway Fountain, also known as the Electric Fountain, in 1908, for the center of Horton Plaza Park, in Downtown San Diego. Though designed in the prime of his Modernist period, its revivalist style is atypical of his work. Gill's design was chosen in a competition among professional architects, and was one of the first projects in the country to combine water and colored electrical light effects. La Jolla Woman's Club (photo taken 1971) In 1911, Gill's nephew, Louis John Gill, joined his firm as a draftsman. That same year, Gill lost an important commission for the Panama-California Exposition (1915) to Bertram Goodhue. He did work for a time as an associate of Goodhue, including the design of the Balboa Park Administration Building, Balboa Park's first structure, which is located just outside the California Quadrangle. Today, it is known as the Gill Administration Building of the San Diego Museum of Man, and houses offices and the Gill Auditorium. Gill was commissioned by Ellen Browning Scripps in 1913 to design the La Jolla Woman's Club. In its construction, he used a \\"tilt-slab\\" construction technique to assemble the exterior arcade walls on site. The result is California's first tilt-up concrete building. These walls integrate hollow, clay-block infill to lighten the slab's weight. For the interior walls and central \\"pop-up\\" volume, however, he employed conventional balloon-frame construction. Though Gill is often associated with the tilt-up method, he used it in only a handful of structures. Shortly thereafter, in 1914, he accepted his nephew Louis as a partner. After this time, Gill began living and working mainly in Los Angeles County, although the Gill & Gill partnership lasted until 1919. Multiple projects for the fledgling city of Torrance may have prompted the move. Gill returned to live in North San Diego County in the 1920s, but his pace of work slowed considerably due to lingering illness, changing public tastes, and his diminishing willingness to compromise with clients. After the late 1920s, his work added Art Deco or \\"Moderne\\" touches. In the late 1920s, Gill produced several civic buildings for the city of Oceanside, California. This would be his final large project. His last contract was to create houses for several displaced Native American families who would then settle at the Rancho Barona Indian Reservation near Lakeside, California. Importance Cossitt House, San Diego, California Irving Gill was concerned with the social impact of good architecture and approached his projects with equal skill and interest, whether he was designing for bankers and mayors or for Indian reservations, an African American church, or migrant Mexican workers and their children. Gill's architecture established \\"a new beginning in life and art\\" and represented a \\"grand rejection\\" of the common \\"architectural mise en scene from other times and places,\\" according to historian Kevin Starr. His work was described as \\"cubist\\" in publications of the time. Gill's interiors were concerned with removing most unnecessary detailing, partly for reasons of economy and hygiene. His houses are known for minimal or flush mouldings; simple (or no) fireplace mantles; coved, and therefore fluid, floor-to-wall transitions; enclosed-side bathtubs; plentiful skylights;, plastered walls with only occasional, but featured, wood elements; flush five-piece doors; concrete or Sorel cement floors; and a general avoidance of dividing lines, ledges, and unnecessary material changes. According to Joseph Giovannini, \\"the desire for an easily maintained, sanitary home drove Gill's aesthetic toward purity.\\" Gill's aesthetically best work, much of it dating from the 1910s, favors flat roofs without eaves, a unity of materials (mostly concrete), casement windows with transoms, white or near-white exterior and interior walls, cubic or rectangular massing, plentiful ground-level arches or series of arches creating transitional breezeways in the manner of the California missions. His best-known work still in active use today includes the Ellen Browning Scripps residence (now the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego), the earliest buildings of The Bishop's School, the La Jolla Woman's Club, the La Jolla Recreation Center and the George W. Marston House. He designed ten churches, of which the best known is the Christian Science Church at Second and Laurel Streets in San Diego. The Woman's Club and Marston House are among those listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Despite frequent recent references to Gill as \\"forgotten\\" or \\"unappreciated,\\" he was reasonably well documented during his life. For example, his work was more frequently published in Gustav Stickley's \\"Craftsman\\" magazine than any other Western architect, including the Greene & Greene firm. Gill's reputation did quickly fade after his death, and it languished until he was included in the 1960 book Five California Architects by Esther McCoy and Randell L. Makinson. This book (still in print) helped to renew interest in his work, and in early California architecture in general. In the decades since its publication Irving Gill has come to be recognized as a major figure in the modern movement. Personal life On May 28, 1928, at the age of 58, Gill married for the first and only time. His wife was Marion Waugh Brashears. While some have speculated that the marriage was unsuccessful, a few remaining letters in Gill's own hand indicate his deep and fond feelings for his wife. Gill was alone on his wife's family ranch in Carlsbad, California when he died on October 7, 1936. Works Selected works by Gill include: * Maj.

There were a few films that featured Singaporean actors and were set in Singapore, including Saint Jack, They Call Her Cleopatra Wong and Crazy Rich Asians.Singapore Film Market With the increasing global success and globalization of the Singaporean film industry, the past two decades have seen Singaporean actors like Tan Kheng Hua and Fiona Xie star in Hollywood films, Singaporean auteurs such as Jack Neo direct English-language works and Singaporean films be remade in the United States, China, Japan as well as other markets. The Singapore International Film Festival has also grown to become one of Asia's largest and most important film festivals. After 1990 =Early 1990s pioneers= The first fully Singapore funded film came in 1991's Medium Rare, which was based on a real-life local cult killer, Adrian Lim, who was hanged in 1988 for murder. Although it cost over S$2 million in production, the film performed dismally at the box office. The film took in merely S$130,000 locally but broke the ice for the next coming Singapore movie, Bugis Street, which was released in 1995. Bugis Street was a gaudy film about the famous sleazy district where transvestites and transsexuals were found. Both Medium Rare and Bugis Street were directed by non Singaporeans. The same year saw the release of Mee Pok Man, the first full-length film made by an independent Singaporean filmmaker, Eric Khoo, on a tight budget of S$100,000. Concerning a lonely noodle seller who falls for a prostitute, Mee Pok Man earned much critical accolade worldwide and encouraged more experimental, independent filmmaking in the nation. Army Daze, made in 1996, took a humorous look at Singapore's national service, and turned in high profits at the box office. In 1997 came another Eric Khoo feature film, 12 Storeys, a highly acclaimed production which was the first Singaporean film to be shown at Cannes. Interweaving 3 stories about life in the HDB high-rise flats, 12 Storeys was seen as a breakthrough for Singaporean films, combining a coherent plot with Singaporean production crew and actors, such as Jack Neo and Koh Boon Pin. The rest of the decade was encouraging for the growing film industry. Glen Goei's Forever Fever (1998) was picked up by Miramax for S$4.5 million and re-released in the U.S. as That's the Way I Like It. These two years saw the releases of a number of other films, such as A Road Less Travelled (1997), God or Dog (1997), Tiger's Whip (1998) and The Teenage Textbook Movie (1998). =Late 1990s successes= However, it was the phenomenal success of Money No Enough (1998) which eventually catapulted the nation's drive towards movie-making. Using a local crew of actors drawn from television comedies, this 'heartland' comedy written by Jack Neo used a smattering of Singlish and Hokkien to make a realistic, easily identifiable drama about everybody's quest to make a quick buck. Made with less than S$1 million, it raked in S$5,800,000, making it the most commercially profitable local film to date. It also demonstrated the viable potential of Singapore's film industry. The next year would be a boom year for local films. Eight Singaporean feature films were made in 1999 alone, the most notable being Liang Po Po: The Movie (starring Jack Neo in a reprisal of his television cross-gender role), That One No Enough, the first directorial effect of Jack Neo, and Eating Air, made by film critic Kelvin Tong and film editor Jasmine Ng on a budget of S$800,000. Eating Air did not break even; That One No Enough barely did and only Liang Po Po: The Movie continued the vein of commercial success of Money No Enough, collecting S$3.03 million. 1999 also marked a watershed for Singapore films. Raintree Pictures, the filmmaking subsidiary of MediaCorp Productions, was started. Raintree Pictures invested in two regional co-productions, Liang Po Po and The Truth About Jane and Sam, which starred Singaporean television lead actress Fann Wong with Taiwanese singer Peter Ho and Hong Kong director Derek Yee. Raintree Pictures would finance a number of local and Hong Kong productions in years to come, and are the producer company of the films of Jack Neo. Subsequent productions, such as 2000 AD (2000) and The Tree (2001), also drew on Hong Kong star power; the company invested in critically acclaimed regional films such as The Eye (2002) and Infernal Affairs II (2003). Raintree Pictures also produced two English-language local productions, Chicken Rice War (2000) and One Leg Kicking (2001). With the financing of a local production company and the setting up of organisations such as the Singapore Film Commission (SFC, set up in 1998), budding filmmakers, especially independent ones, found it easier to make movies on subsidies and loaned funding. The advent of digital video also meant that some novice filmmakers could experiment with cheaper alternatives. Features like Stories about Love (2000) and Return to Pontianak (2001) were both shot on digital videos, even though they were not commercial successes. =Early 2000s= The success story since the turn of the 21st century must be from local comedian-turned-director Jack Neo. Financed by Raintree Pictures, he made a number of hits dealing with Singapore's heartland problems in an engaging and deceptively light-hearted fashion. I Not Stupid (2002) was a peek into the ultra-competitive academic lifestyle as seen through three local students who performed poorly in grades; its acerbic social commentary marked another height for Singaporean films. Homerun (2003) was a remake of the Iranian Children of Heaven in a local, pre-independent era context; it won for its young lead Megan Zheng the first Golden Horse Award for Best Newcomer. The Best Bet (2004) took a humorous dig at heartlanders' obsessions with lotteries. Neo averages a film per year and his productions feature local Singaporean (usually television) artistes in filmic roles. They have been successes locally and abroad, especially in those places with a Chinese- language market, such as Hong Kong. He has started his own artiste management company, J-Team Productions. Royston Tan, a young Singapore TV commercial director who has been making award-winning shorts for years, released 15: The Movie, his first feature, in 2003. An expanded version of an earlier short film he made, this 90-min movie on the fringe and drug-abusing delinquents used bold subject-matter and featured some graphic scenes with non- professional actors. When the film censorship board passed it with cuts, it prompted a backlash from the director in the form of Cut, an all-singing musical satire √† la Tsai Ming-liang lampooning the system. This short film was passed uncensored by the board and was seen during the Singapore International Film Festival, but there were open discussions about it during local parliamentary sessions, prompting remarks that the government was \\"not amused\\" by it. Royston Tan has since made three more features, 4:30 (2005), 881 (2007) and 12 Lotus (2008). =2005 to 2009= 2005 could be seen as another mini- boom year for Singaporean cinema, with commercially successful fares like Kelvin Tong's horror flick The Maid, two Jack-Neo co-directed movies, I Do I Do and One More Chance, and less mainstream offerings like Eric Khoo's critically acclaimed Cannes opener Be with Me, and Perth, Djinn's dark take on Scorsese's Taxi Driver. In 2006, the independent feature Becoming Royston paid homage to the above-mentioned filmmaker. It was made under new Originasian Pictures. The film went on its festival run in Europe and South Asia and was released in 2007. 2006 also saw the premiere of Singapore Dreaming by Woo Yen Yen and Colin Goh, who won the Montblanc New Screenwriters Award at the San Sebastian International Film Festival, the first Singaporeans to do so. The film was also screened at numerous festivals worldwide and, in 2007, became the first Singaporean feature to win the Audience Award for Narrative Feature at the Asian American International Film Festival in New York. In 2007, Jack Neo released another film known as Just Follow Law which took a dig at bureaucracy in the civil service, as well as the lengthy procedures one had to go through in Singapore to get a permit for various things. This film garnered generally positive reviews and was moderately successful at the box office. However, the success story of the year was Royston Tan's 881, which brought Singapore's seventh month getai culture to the big screens. While it was intended to be a niche film, it exceeded expectations and became one of the highest grossing local films of all time. Critics generally gave it positive reviews, and many believe that it was the fact that the film gave younger Singaporean Chinese more insight into their traditional culture that made it a success. In addition, the use of Hokkien songs, which had been suppressed by the government as part of the Speak Mandarin Campaign, may have contributed to its popularity. In 2008, Eric Khoo's Tamil language social drama My Magic became Singapore's first film to compete for the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. =2010 and beyond= A wave of young filmmakers, considered the Singaporean new wave, who are educated in local and overseas film schools, begin to dominate the film scene. Ilo Ilo, the debut feature of director Anthony Chen, premiered at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival as part of the Directors' Fortnight on 19 May 2013 to very positive reviews. The film was awarded the Camera d'Or award, thus becoming the first Singaporean feature film to win an award at the Cannes Film Festival. It received six nominations at the Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards., and won 4: Best Film, Best New Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actress for Yeo Yann Yann.

Etymology  'Mama' and 'papa' use speech sounds that are among the easiest to produce: bilabials like , , and , and the open vowel . They are, therefore, often among the first word-like sounds made by babbling babies (babble words), and parents tend to associate the first sound babies make with themselves and to employ them subsequently as part of their baby- talk lexicon. Thus, there is no need to ascribe to common ancestry the similarities of !Kung ba, Aramaic abba, Mandarin Chinese , and Persian baba (all \\"father\\"); or Navajo am√°, Mandarin Chinese , Swahili mama, Quechua mama, and Polish mama (all \\"mother\\"). For the same reason, some scientists believe that 'mama' and 'papa' were among the first words that humans spoke. Linguist Roman Jakobson hypothesized that the nasal sound in \\"mama\\" comes from the nasal murmur that babies produce when breastfeeding: = Variants = Variants using other sounds do occur: for example, in Fijian, the word for \\"mother\\" is nana, the Turkish word is ana, and in Old Japanese, the word for \\"mother\\" was papa. The modern Japanese word for \\"father,\\" chichi, is from older titi. Very few languages lack labial consonants (this mostly being attested on a family basis, in the Iroquoian and some of the Athabaskan languages), and only Arapaho is known to lack an open vowel /a/. The Tagalog -na- / -ta- (\\"mom\\" / \\"dad\\" words) parallel the more common ma / pa in nasality / orality of the consonants and identity of place of articulation. Examples by language family \\"Mama\\" and \\"papa\\" in different languages:mama on the mappapa on the map =Afro-Asiatic languages= *Aramaic: Imma for mother and Abba for father *Hebrew: Ima for mother and Aba for father * Dialectal Arabic/Maltese (\\"Imm\\") for mother and (\\"Ab\\") for father =Austroasiatic languages= * Khmer has different words that indicate different levels of respect. They include the intimate ·ûò·üâ·û∂·ûÄ·üã (mak/meak) and ·ûî·üâ·û∂ (pa), the general ·ûò·üâ·üÇ (mai/me) and ·ûñ·ûª·ûÄ (puk), and the formal ·ûò·üí·ûä·û∂·ûô (madaay) and ·û™·ûñ·ûª·ûÄ (ovpuk). *Vietnamese, m·∫π is mother and b·ªë is father. M√° and ba or cha respectively in Southern Vietnamese. =Austronesian languages= *Tagalog, mothers can be called ina, and fathers ama. Two other words for the same in common use, nanay and tatay, came from Nahuatl by way of Spanish. Owing to contact with Spanish and English, mam√°, pap√°, ma(m(i)), and dad or d√°di are also used. *In Indonesian, mother is called Emak (mak) or Ibu (buk), father is called Bapak or Ayah. The modern Indonesian word for father is papi and mother is mami. The words mami and papi have been used since the days of the Dutch Indies Colonial, causing the mixing of the words \\"Papa & Mama\\", Europe to \\"Papi & Mami\\", Indonesia. =Dravidian languages = * Though amma and nana are used in Tulu, they are not really Tulu words but used due to the influence of neighboring states' languages. The actual words for mother in Tulu is nane () and the word for father in Tulu is amme (). Note that the usage of these words is at odds with the usage pattern in other languages (similar to Georgian in that sense). * In Telugu, \\"Thalli\\" and \\"Thandri\\" are used for mother and father in formal Telugu. amma and nana or bapu are used for mother and father for the informal way. Notice how nana refers to maternal grandfather in Hindi, and how that differs from its Telugu meaning. \\"Nayana\\" is also used for father in informal Telugu in the Rayalaseema region of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana of India. Note that the usage of these words is at odds with the usage pattern in other languages (similar to Tulu and Georgian in that sense). * In Malayalam, the word for mother is \\"Amma\\" and for father is \\"Achan\\". In scholastic usage, Mathav and Pithav are used respectively. \\"Achan\\" is a transformed Malayalam equivalent of the Sanskrit \\"Arya\\" for \\"Sir/Master\\" (Arya - ajja -> ayya). Other words like \\"Appan\\", \\"'Bappa'\\" etc. are also used for father, and words such as \\"Umma\\", \\"Ammachi\\" for mother. * In Tamil, \\"Thaai\\" and \\"Thanthai\\" are the formal Tamil words for mother and father; informally Amma and Appa are much more common words for mother and father respectively. *In the Kannada language, \\"Thaayi\\" for mother and \\"Thande\\" for father are used formally. But to address them informally Kannadigas use amma for mother and appa for father. =Uralic languages= * Estonian ema * Hungarian apa means \\"father\\" and anya means mother, which tends to use open vowels such as and . For formal usage, these words are applied, but both mama and papa are used as well, in informal speech. For family internal addressing, apu and anyu (variants of \\"apa\\" and \\"anya,\\" respectively) are also used. * Finnish em√§ (note: The use of \\"em√§\\" is considered archaic in the meaning \\"mother of a child\\". The modern word is \\"√§iti\\" derived from Gothic \\"ai√æei\\".) =Indo-European languages= In the Proto-Indo-European language, *mƒÅÃÅtƒìr (modern reconstruction: *m√©h‚ÇÇtƒìr) meant \\"mother\\" and *p«ùt·∏ór (modern reconstruction: *ph‚ÇÇt·∏ór) meant \\"father\\", and √°tta meant \\"papa\\", a nursery word for \\"father\\".

Informally, the terms mammi and pappƒÅ are also used, possibly due to English influence. * Hindi has the word mƒÅtƒÅ and pitaji as the formal words for \\"mother\\" and \\"father\\", though the shorter informal term maa and pita is more common. Due to English borrowings, the words mamma and pappa are also common. * Konkani language, the word \\"aai\\" for \\"mother\\" and \\"baba\\" \\"father\\" are used, given the language's close similarity to Marathi. However due to English borrowings, the words mamma and pappa are much more common today. * Maithili language has the word Mami and Papa to refer mother and father respectively, which were borrowed from English and are very popular in Mithila federal state of Nepal and Bihar state of India. * Marathi Aai (‚Äú‡§Ü‡§à‚Äù) for mother and Baba (‚Äú‡§¨‡§æ‡§¨‡§æ‚Äù) for father. In some parts of Maharashtra Amma (\\"‡§Ö‡§Æ‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ\\") for mother and Appa (\\"‡§Ö‡§™‡•ç‡§™‡§æ\\") or Tatya (\\"‡§§‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ\\") for father is also used. However due to English borrowings, the words mummy and pappa are much more common today in urban areas. * Nepali language has the words \\"ama\\" or \\"ma\\" to refer to mother and \\"baba\\" or \\"ba\\" for father. * Odia uses bapa (‡¨¨‡¨æ‡¨™‡¨æ) for father and bou (‡¨¨‡≠ã‡¨â) for mother. However due to English borrowings, the words mamma and pappa are much more common today. * Sinhalese, the word for mother originally was \\"abbe\\" (\\"abbiyande\\") and father was \\"appa \\" (\\"appanande\\"). Use of \\"amma\\" for mother and \\"nana\\" for father is due to heavy influence of Tamil.

Their arrest and imprisonment led to the Trades Union Congress (TUC) calling a general strike. Injunction The events took place against the background of a clash between the Conservative government of Edward Heath and the trade union movement, involving the first national miners‚Äô strike in Britain since 1926, with mass picketing, and clashes between police and workers. Dockers at the Chobham Farm container depot, Temple Mills, Newham, were unofficially striking and picketing the site. The National Industrial Relations Court (NIRC) had issued an injunction barring further picketing, following an application by Midland Cold Storage Company.Midland Cold Storage Co. Ltd. v Steer [1972] (ICR) Arrest Picketing continued despite the injunction. Five shop stewards were named by private investigators for the cold storage company ‚Äì Conny Clancy, Tony Merrick, Bernie Steer, Vic Turner and Derek Watkins. Warrants were issued by the court for their arrest for contempt of court, and they were imprisoned on 21 July 1972. Protests Following their arrest, a rolling series of strikes began to cause work stoppages until there was virtually an unofficial national strike. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) then called for an official national strike on 31 July, demanding the release of the five shop stewards. Thousands of striking workers marched through North London to Pentonville Prison. Release The \\"Five\\" were released within a week of their arrest when Official Solicitor Norman Turner, on receipt of the papers, successfully applied to the Court of Appeal. The Official Solicitor is a court official who represents those who are unable to represent their own interests. For this case, he was assisted in the Court of Appeal by barrister John Vinelott, later a High Court judge. The Official Solicitor was successful in his application to overturn the arrest warrants, on the grounds that the National Industrial Relations Court had insufficient grounds to deprive them of their liberty, and that the evidence of the private investigators was insufficient. Legacy Subsequently Vic Turner continued to work in the docks, transferring from the Royal Docks to Tilbury. However he left the docks under the voluntary redundancy scheme and started working for Newham London Borough Council. He was then elected a councillor and served for many years before being elected mayor. During this period he was also presented with the Transport and General Union Gold Medal for his work for the union. His death was reported in December 2012. Film The radical film group Cinema Action made a documentary called Arise Ye Workers during the struggle, which was released in 1973. The film won the Silver Dove at the Leipzig Film Festival and was screened by the jailed dockers on the anniversary of their release from jail. References * Death of The Docks, Colin Ross, 2010.

It can be accomplished in several ways, both pre- and post- implantation of an embryo, as well as at childbirth. It has been marketed under the title family balancing. According to the United Nations Population Fund, the reasons behind sex selection are due to three factors and provide an understanding for sex ratio imbalances as well as to project future trends. The factors are: # A preference for sons which stems from household structures ‚Äúin which girls and women have a marginal social, economic and symbolic position, and consequently enjoy fewer rights.‚Äù These household structures also focus on security in which sons are expected to provide support to their parents throughout their life; # Technological growth of prenatal diagnosis which allows parents to know the sex of their unborn child; and # Low fertility which increases the need for sex selection by reducing the probability of having a daughter in smaller families. The United Nations Population Fund states that ‚ÄúLocal fertility restrictions and spontaneous rapid fertility decline below replacement levels tend to compel parents who want both a son and a small family size to resort to sex selection.‚Äù  Preference for sex of child  In many cultures, male offspring are desired in order to inherit property, carry on the family name and to provide support for parents in old age. In countries such as India, China, Indonesia and Nepal sons have been favored over daughters. According to a 2011 Gallup poll, American parents favor boys by a 40% to 28% margin. The results were similar to a survey in 1941, when Americans preferred a boy to a girl by a 38% to 24% margin. The overall preference was driven by men, of whom 49% preferred a son compared to 22% who preferred a daughter. Men's preference for sons was most pronounced among men aged 18 to 29. Women, on the other hand, showed no preference for either sex, with 33% stating that they preferred a girl and 31% responding that they favored a boy. A 2009 study at the University of Ulster found that having sisters, as compared to brothers, can enhance the quality of an adult's life. = Cultural son preference = World map of birth sex ratios, 2012 The one child policy in China has contributed to the imbalanced sex ratios. Image shows a community bulletin board in Nonguang Village, Sichuan province, China, keeping track of the town's female population, listing recent births by name and noting that several thousand yuan of fines for unauthorized births remain unpaid from the previous year. There is a preference of parents to have a son over a daughter in many countries. This can be observed through sex ratios of children in various countries. Although biologically the sex ratio of children is around 95 girls to every 100 boys, this number generally evens out due to the higher infant mortality rate of boy infants. Scholars argue that the expected birth sex ratio in a normal population is in the range of 103 to 107 males to females at birth.Report of the International Workshop on Skewed Sex Ratios at Birth United Nations FPA (2012)Kraemer, Sebastian. \\"The Fragile Male.\\" British Medical Journal (2000): n. pag. British Medical Journal. Web. 20 Oct. 2013. However, in a number of countries of South Asia, East Asia and the Caucasus, the sex ratio of children is severely distorted. The problem is particularly severe in China and India. The preference for sons over daughters can be connected to a number of reasons. In these countries, it is argued that son preference is linked to factors including economics, religion, and culture. Having a son ensures that families are more economically secure by not having to provide dowry payments, but rather being on the receiving end of this practice. In China, the one child policy has contributed to the sex imbalance, while the dowry system in India is responsible for a strong son preference. Furthermore, in countries where there are discriminatory practices regarding women inheriting, owning, or controlling land by law, having a son ensures that the family will not have to worry about the legal aftermath if something were to happen to them. It can also be argued that parents in these countries are aware of the potential hardship their daughter would have to endure in her lifetime, and therefore prefer to have a son in order not to see their daughter endure such difficulties. Many times this son preference results in female foeticide and pre-natal sex selection. Methods =Pre-implantation= Two major types of pre-implantation methods can be used for social sex selection. Both of them are based on actively rendering the second sex chromosome to be either a Y chromosome (resulting in a male), or an X chromosome (resulting in a female). The Ericsson method The Ericsson method, first applied in a clinical setting in the 1970s by Dr. Ronald J. Ericsson, uses higher concentrations of sperm of the desired sex to increase the likelihood of conceiving that sex. When used to increase the likelihood of a female child, studies have resulted in between 70% and 80% female children. When used to increase the likelihood of a male child, studies have resulted in between 50% to 75% male children. Currently, approximately 50 gender selection centers in the United States use the Ericsson Method for artificial gender selection. The Ericsson method separates male and female sperm by passing them through a column filled with blood protein, human serum albumin. As the sperms enter the human serum albumin, the differences in mass between the X and Y chromosomes manifest as the lighter male sperms push deeper into the protein than the females dragged down by the weight of the extra \\"leg\\" of the X sex chromosome. This tiny difference creates separate layers of concentrated male and female sperm. The layers of gender-selected sperm are of higher concentrations but not pure. This lack of purity explains the 30% chance of gender selection failure of the Ericsson method. IVF/PGD technique An 8-celled embryo prior to IVF/PGD analysis After ovarian stimulation, multiple eggs are removed from the mother. The eggs are fertilized in the laboratory using the father's sperm in a technique called in vitro fertilization (IVF). \\"In vitro\\" is Latin for \\"within glass\\". Fertilized eggs are called embryos. As the embryos develop through mitosis, they are separated by sex. Embryos of the desired gender are implanted back in the mother's uterus. Prior to fertilization with IVF, the fertilized eggs can be genetically biopsied with preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) to increase fertilization success. Once an embryo grows to a 6-8 cell size, a small laser incision in the egg membrane (zona pellucida) allows safe removal of one of the cells. Every cell in the embryo contains an identical copy of the genome of the entire person. Removal of one of these cells does not harm the developing embryo. A Geneticist then studies the chromosomes in the extracted cells for genetic defects and for a definite analysis of the embryo‚Äôs gender. Embryos of the desired sex and with acceptable genetics are then placed back into the mother. The IVF/PGD technique is favored over the Ericsson method because of the stricter control of the offspring gender in the laboratory. Since only embryos of the desired sex are transferred to the mother, IVF/PGD avoids the small likelihood present in the Ericsson method of an undesired sperm fertilizing the egg. Gender selection success rates for IVF/PGD are very high. The technique is recommended for couples who will not accept a child of the undesired gender. Timing methods Timing methods aim to affect the sex ratio of the resultant children by having sexual intercourse at specific times as related to ovulation. Studies have not been consistent about whether timing methods have any influence on the sex of the baby, with some showing no correlation and others showing just the opposite. *The Shettles method, first formally theorized in the 1960s by Landrum B. Shettles, proposes that sperm containing the X (female) chromosome are more resilient than sperm containing the Y (male) chromosome. The method advocates intercourse two to four days prior to ovulation. By the time ovulation occurs, the cervix should contain a higher concentration of female sperm still capable of fertilization (with most of the male sperm already dead). Intercourse close to ovulation, on the other hand, should increase the chances of conceiving a boy since the concentration of Y sperm will be higher at the height of the menstrual cycle. *The Whelan method is an \\"intercourse timing\\" method that advocates the opposite of the Shettles method. The Whelan method suggests intercourse four to six days prior to ovulation to increase the likelihood of fertilization by male sperm. Sperm sorting Sperm sorting is an advanced technique that sorts sperm \\"in vitro\\" by flow cytometry. This shines a laser at the sperm to distinguish X and Y chromosomes, and can automatically separate the sperm out into different samples. During the early to mid 1980s, Dr. Glenn Spaulding was the first to sort viable whole human and animal spermatozoa using a flow cytometer, and utilized the sorted motile rabbit sperm for artificial insemination. Subsequently, the first patent application disclosing the method to sort \\"two viable subpopulations enriched for x- or y- sperm\\"US Patent 5,021,244, column 9, Sorting Sperm was filed in April 1987 as US Application Serial Number 35,986 and later became part of US Patent 5,021,244; and the patent included the discovery of haploid expression (sex-associated membrane proteins, or SAM proteins) and the development of monoclonal antibodies to those proteins. Additional applications and methods were added, including antibodies, from 1987 through 1997.US Patent 5,021,244; 5,346,990; 5,369,012; 5,439,362; 5,496,722; 5,648,468; 5,660,997; PCT/US1989/002069 At the time of the patent filing, both Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories and the USDA were only sorting fixed sperm nuclei, after the Application Serial Number 35,986 patent filing a new technique was utilized by the USDA where \\"sperm were briefly sonicated to remove tails\\". USDA in conjunction with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, 'Beltsfield Sperm Sexing Technology' relies on the DNA difference between the X- and Y- chromosomes. Prior to flow cytometric sorting, semen is labeled with a fluorescent dye called Hoechst 33342 which binds to the DNA of each spermatozoon. As the X chromosome is larger (i.e. has more DNA) than the Y chromosome, the \\"female\\" (X-chromosome bearing) spermatozoa will absorb a greater amount of dye than its male (Y-chromosome bearing) counterpart. As a consequence, when exposed to UV light during flow cytometry, X spermatozoa fluoresce brighter than Y- spermatozoa. As the spermatozoa pass through the flow cytometer in single file, each spermatozoon is encased by a single droplet of fluid and assigned an electric charge corresponding to its chromosome status (e.g. X-positive charge, Y-negative charge). The stream of X- and Y- droplets is then separated by means of electrostatic deflection and collected into separate collection tubes for subsequent processing. The technology is already in commercial use for animal farming.ABC Landline, Dairy farms use gender selection process, 2006. It is currently being trialed on humans in the US under the trademark MicroSort; it claims a 90% success rate but is still considered experimental by the FDA. =Post-implantation= Sex selection after implantation can be performed by prenatal sex discernment, followed by sex-selective abortion of any offspring of the unwanted sex. For prenatal sex discernment, a blood test can be taken from the mother for testing of small amounts of fetal DNA within it, and has been estimated to be reliable more than 98% of the time, as long as the samples are taken after the seventh week of pregnancy. =Post-birth= Sex- selective infanticide - Killing children of the unwanted sex. Though illegal in most parts of the world, it is still practiced. Sex-selective child abandonment - Abandoning children of the unwanted sex. Though illegal in most parts of the world, it is still practiced. Sex-selective adoption - Placing children of the unwanted sex up for adoption. Less commonly viewed as a method of social sex selection, adoption affords families that have a gender preference a legal means of choosing offspring of a particular sex. Ethical concerns The application of these techniques to humans creates moral and ethical concerns in the opinion of some, while the advantages of sensible use of selected technologies is favored by others. In contrast, in an interview study, sex-selection technology providers generally argued that sex selection is an expression of reproductive rights, was initiated and pursued by women, and was a sign of female empowerment that allowed couples to make well- informed family planning decisions, prevented occurrences of unintended pregnancy and abortion, and minimized intimate partner violence and/or child neglect. The Ethics Committee of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine concluded that it is ethically appropriate to employ these new reproductive technologies to avoid the birth of children suffering from X-linked genetic disorders. However, to use preimplantation genetic diagnosis and sex selection solely for non-medical reasons, the Committee claims, is morally inappropriate. Also, primary care physicians questioned whether women could truly express free choice under pressure from family and community. In addition, primary care physicians voiced the concerns that sex selection led to invasive medical interventions in the absence of therapeutic indications, contributed to gender stereotypes that could result in child neglect of the lesser-desired sex, and was not a solution to domestic violence. In addition, social risks of sex selection outweigh the social benefits of sex selection Post-conceptual selection by preimplantation testing (PGD) also involves preferential use of embryos, and termination of pregnancy for gender selection also raises many ethical questions of the abortion debate. Demographic concerns In addition to the ethical concerns mentioned, issues of demographics arise in societies where social sex selection is common. A society may exhibit a widespread bias towards having children of a specific gender, either due to cultural biases or economic concerns (e.g. male children may be more employable in the future and thus provide more financial support). When combined with frequent social sex selection, this bias may produce a gender imbalance that has undesirable consequences. This phenomenon has been observed in many nations in the Far East, such as India and China, where social sex selection has produced unnaturally high male/female ratios in the population. Couples in these areas use reproductive technologies to choose the sex of their children, which ultimately leads to a skew the human sex ratio toward a disproportionately male population. Sex selection has also been detected in several countries of Eastern Europe such as Albania or Azerbaijan.SEX IMBALANCES AT BIRTH IN ALBANIA (2012) A 2012 report by UNFPA estimates that the total gender gap due to prenatal and postnatal gender discrimination amounts to 117 million women.Sex Imbalances at Birth, United Nations Population Fund (2012) China's gender imbalance is further increased by the One Child Policy, although applicable only in most urban populations. In these nations, a lack of opportunity for many men to marry is believed to be producing increases in crime, demand for prostitution, mass emigration, and the selling of brides.India's lost girls, BBC Online, 4 Feb 2003. China's 'one child family' policy is considered largely responsible for the substantial imbalance of the sex ratio. Chinese government reports show that the sex ratio for newborns is 118:100 (boys:girls), higher in rural areas such as Guangdong and Hainan (130:100) compared to the average of 104:100 in developed countries. It is believed that the ratio would increase further to the point that, by 2020, men of marriageable age would be unable to find mates, resulting in large social problems. Some nations, such as India, have attempted to curtail these gender imbalances with criminal statutes. In contrast, bioethicist Jacob Appel of New York University has argued that governments should pay couples to choose to have female children. According to Professor Appel, \\"if female babies [were] worth their weight in rupees and yuan, economic and educational opportunities for girls would soon follow.\\" In contrast, actual experience in Western cultures provides no evidence for any degree of gender imbalance from technologies which have long been available and legal ‚Äì such as selective abortion or preimplantation embryo testing. When used for family balancing indications in such countries as the United States, pre-conceptual sex selection is widely sought without any preferential selection of males. A 1993 survey of more than 2300 pregnant women in the British population found no overall preference for either sex. These findings are largely consistent with other surveys conducted in the US. Thus the right of individual families to determine whether or not to balance gender of offspring in their families is not and will not become, in many countries, a demographic issue. Furthermore, in countries where such demographic issues exist because of strong gender preferences in a segment of the population, regulatory and legal control of, without denial of access to, sperm sorting technology can be utilized to provide individuals with choices while ensuring that equal numbers of boys and girls are produced for population demographic equality. History and folk beliefs Sex selection is not new.Gender-biased sex selection. United Nations Population Fund There are a wide variety of social sex selections methods which have not been demonstrated to be effective. Because even implausible and ineffective methods have a success rate of 50%, many continued to be recommended by word of mouth. The Greeks and Romans did not have a consistent theory of how sex was determined. Pliny the Elder claims that tying the right testicle of a ram will cause him to produce only females, but does not claim this about other creatures.Pliny the Elder, The Natural History, Book XXX, Chapter 16. Pseudo-Plutarch lists many Greek theories of sex determination, including heat and cold, left and right testicles, left and right sides of the body, sperm crossing or not crossing from one side of the womb to the other, and the strength or dominance of various body parts.Pseudo-Plutarch, Placita Philosophorum, Book V, Chapter VII. An 18th-century French book called The art of boys suggested an extreme method of ensuring children of one sex. The author suggests that one testicle and one ovary are intended for each sex. By removing a testicle or ovary, children of the other sex can be guaranteed.Michel Procope-Couteaux, L'art de faire des gar√ßons, 1770, p. 129. Since the ancient China, Chinese people use Chinese Gender Chart to predict and select baby‚Äôs gender. Chinese Gender Calendar was buried in an imperial mausoleum with a history of over 300 years. It was calculated and deduced by the ancient Chinese based on Yin-Yang, Five Elements, Eight Diagrams and time. This calendar is a simple chart who matches the day of conception of the future child with the age of the mother at the day of conception. This table contains one more chance to conceive a boy. This may reflect the current female / male ratio. Census data from India show an imbalance in sex ratios among children in the early 20th century, such disparities almost always reflect a preference for sons. In the past, son preference may have resulted in the neglect or killing of female infants. However, since the early 1980s, ultrasounds and other technologies have enabled parents to detect the sex of a foetus during prenatal screenings. Those who prefer sons may arrange to abort female foetuses. This has accelerated sex-ratio imbalances at birth in parts of the world. It is estimated that, over the past generation, tens of millions of female foetuses have been aborted. Since the 1990s, some areas have seen up to 25 per cent more male births than female births. Sperm sorting utilizes the technique of flow cytometry to analyze and 'sort' spermatozoa. During the early to mid-1980s, Dr. Glenn Spaulding was the first to sort viable whole human and animal spermatozoa using a flow cytometer, and utilized the sorted motile rabbit sperm for artificial insemination. Subsequently, the first patent application disclosing the method to sort \\"two viable subpopulations enriched for x- or y- sperm\\" was filed in April 1987 as US Application Serial Number 35,986 and later became part of US Patent 5,021,244; and the patent included the discovery of haploid expression (sex-associated membrane proteins, or SAM proteins) and the development of monoclonal antibodies to those proteins.

The stream of X- and Y- droplets is then separated by means of electrostatic deflection and collected into separate collection tubes for subsequent processing. Recently, a study published in 2006 indicated that mothers with toxoplasmosis have a significantly higher sex ratio of boys to girls. This has been discussed in connection with the manipulation hypothesis of parasites. Another study found a link between sex and the diet of the mother, but this may be due to statistical chance, and has yet to be confirmed. Legality Sex selection is legal in most of the world. There is fertility tourism from the United Kingdom,US clinic offers British couples the chance to choose the sex of their child From The Times. August 22, 2009 Australia and Canada to the United States for sex selection, because preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD, a potential expansion of IVF), which can be used for sex selection, is prohibited in the UK, Australia and Canada, except when it is used to screen for genetic diseases, while the laws in the US are more relaxed in this subject. Sex selection is illegal in China, but the Chinese government admits that the practice is widespread, especially in rural areas of China and among lawless groups such as ghettoized migrant workers in cities.Gender imbalance in China October 27, 2008 - Shorenstein APARC, AHPP, SCP News. By Shannon Davidson, Jennifer Bunnell and Fei Yan Sex selection is illegal in India. Prenatal determination of sex through ultrasound is also illegal in India.Krishan S. Nehra, Library of Congress. Sex Selection & Abortion: Canada In 1994, the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques Act banned prenatal sex determination, and was strengthened by an amendment in 2003. These laws were instituted to combat the prevalent practice of sex-selective abortion. Every genetic counselling centre, genetic laboratory or genetic clinic engaged in counselling or conducting pre-natal diagnostics techniques, like In vitro fertilisation (IVF) with the potential of sex selection (Preimplantation genetic diagnosis) before and after conception comes under purview of the PCPNDT Act and are banned. However, these laws have generally failed to be effective in rural areas and, despite education efforts, sex- selective abortion continues to be practiced in certain small parts of India.

It currently controls about 8,000 megawatts of regulated electric generating capacity in Kentucky and delivers electricity to more than 10 million customers in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and the United Kingdom. PPL is the parent to seven regulated utility companies in the U.S. and U.K., and it also provides natural gas delivery service to 329,000 customers in Kentucky. PPL Electric Utilities (formerly known as PP&L; and Pennsylvania Power and Light) is PPL Corporation's primary subsidiary. The company is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange. History Pennsylvania Power & Light was founded in 1920 out of a merger of eight smaller Pennsylvania utilities. It gradually extended its service territory to a crescent-shaped region of central and northeastern Pennsylvania stretching from Lancaster, through the Lehigh Valley into Scranton and Wilkes-Barre. In 1995, it reorganized as a holding company, PP&L; Resources, which changed its name to the current PPL Corporation in 2000. The company limited its activities to Pennsylvania until deregulation of electrical utilities in the 1990s encouraged PPL to purchase assets in other states. The largest of these transactions was PPL's 1998 purchase of 13 plants from Montana Power (leaving NorthWestern Energy - the buyer of the former Montana Power transmission and distribution systems - vulnerable to high \\"spot\\" prices on the energy market). This added over 2,500 MW of capacity and was the largest expansion in PPL's history. In 2014, those hydroelectric facilities were sold to NorthWestern. In 2010, PPL completed the acquisition of two regulated utilities in Kentucky ‚Äî Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities. In 2011, PPL completed the acquisition of two regulated regional electricity distribution companies in the United Kingdom. Together, with two previously acquired regional electricity distribution companies, they operate under the name Western Power Distribution. On June 6, 2014, PPL announced it will be divesting its electrical generation facilities to a newly formed company, Talen Energy. On June 1, 2015, the Talen spinoff was completed, allowing PPL to concentrate on the transmission and distribution aspects of the electric utility business.

PPL Electric Utilities, which serves 1.4 million customers in 29 counties in Pennsylvania, has received 27 J.D. Power and Associates awards for customer satisfaction. Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities, which serve 1.3 million customers in almost 100 counties across Kentucky and Virginia, have won 24 J.D. Power awards for customer satisfaction. Headquarters The PPL Building is the tallest building in Allentown, Pennsylvania. =PPL Building= The PPL Building is now the tallest building in not just Allentown, but in the greater Lehigh Valley, after the demolition of the Martin Tower on May 19, 2019. The building has 23 stories and is tall. It is located at the intersection of Hamilton and Ninth Streets in the downtown area of the city. Investments In a speech before the Edison Electric Institute Financial Conference in November 2019, William Spence, PPL's former chairman and chief executive officer, said that the company is focusing on building more advanced cleaner energy technologies and is also increasing its effort on a strategy known as \\"Energy Forward.\\" The company is investing around $15 billion through 2022 to improve infrastructure and technology in order to \\"create a smarter, more reliable and resilient energy grid,\\" according to Spence. In the third quarter of 2019, PPL completed a $470 million investment in replacing meters with \\"advanced\\" meters in Pennsylvania. Marketing In February 2010, PPL Corporation purchased the naming rights to the venue originally known as PPL Park in Chester, Pennsylvania (which is outside of PPL's service territory), the home stadium of Major League Soccer's Philadelphia Union. As part of the $25 million, 11-year deal, PPL EnergyPlus provides sustainable energy to PPL Park derived from other sources in Pennsylvania. After PPL spun off its non-regulated generation business into the separate Talen Energy, the stadium naming rights were assumed by the spinoff company and the venue became known as Talen Energy Stadium. In February 2020, the park was named Subaru Park. PPL owns the naming rights to the PPL Center in Allentown, which hosts the Lehigh Valley Phantoms of the American Hockey League starting with the 2014 season. PPL paid an undisclosed sum over ten years.

The opera house caught fire during a stage play sponsored by nearby St. John's Lutheran Church. The fire started when a kerosene lamp being used for stage lighting was knocked over starting a fire on the stage. In short order the spreading fire ignited a mixture of lighting gas and oxygen from a malfunctioning stereopticon machine being used to present a magic lantern show at intermission. Audience members waited for the fire to be extinguished by theatre personnel, wasting the precious minutes they needed to escape safely. The stage and auditorium were located on the 2nd floor and the few emergency exits available were either unmarked or blocked. Two fire escapes were available but were only accessible through latched windows whose sills were located 3 feet above the floor. Of the approximately 400 men, women, and children either in attendance or associated with the performance of the play, 171 perished in various ways as they tried to escape the conflagration. In the panic to escape many were crushed in the narrow main entrance stairway as well as against the jammed main exit swinging doors of the 2nd floor auditorium. In a few instances entire families were wiped out. One firefighter John Graver, was also killed while responding to the incident. Play The play being performed on this Monday night was \\"The Scottish Reformation\\" by Harriet Earhart Monroe, who was heavily involved in the production. A slide (magic lantern) show and lecture were presented at intermission to provide historical background for the play. Approximately sixty people were involved in the production, including stagehands and others not actually performing. 312 tickets were sold for the Monday night performance, though there is no certain count of the number actually in attendance, and a number of accounts state that there were many patrons standing. Monroe was subpoenaed to appear before the inquest, but refused to appear. She was accused of employing an inadequately trained young man to operate the stereopticon, but inquest's jury found her innocent. Private lawsuits were brought against her by the families of several victims. The result of these lawsuits is unclear from surviving records. Monroe's sister, Della Earhart Mayers, was killed in the fire and is buried in Boyertown's Fairview Cemetery. Building The \\"Rhoads Opera House\\" was not a structure normally described as an opera house. It was a three-story commercial brick building which contained a hardware store and bank on its first floor, an auditorium ( the \\"opera house\\" ) and offices on its second floor, and several meeting rooms and offices on its third floor. The auditorium was a rental facility made available for public and private events such as business meetings, lectures, school graduations and public entertainment events. The auditorium included a small stage located at the back end of the auditorium. It is doubtful that any opera was ever performed on this stage. The present day building occupying the same site as the original Rhoads Building on the corner of Washington Street and Philadelphia Avenue is somewhat similar in overall appearance to the original Rhoads Building. The main difference is in the overall height of the building and its second floor windows. In the new building these are approximately six feet tall, in the original building they were closer to eight feet tall. The original auditorium was approximately 12 feet in height thus accommodating the taller windows. The present day building does not house an auditorium at all, the second floor is consequentially of a lesser height as are its windows. Additionally, the present day building is not equipped with fire escapes. The original building had three: one on its front fa√ßade, one on the Washington Street fa√ßade, and one on the opposite side fa√ßade. In many other major characteristics the present day building is similar to the original except for certain architectural and decorative details. The present day building was constructed approximately two years after the fire using fire insurance proceeds the building's owner and prominent Boyertown citizen, Dr. Thomas Rhoads, received as a result of the complete destruction of the original building. Aftermath According to the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry, Philadelphians contributed relief funds of $18,000. Three morgues were set up and approximately fifteen thousand people attended funerals on a single day. One hundred and five new graves were dug in Boyertown's Fairview Cemetery. Just over $22,000 was received in response to an appeal for contributions toward burial of the dead. The incident spurred the Pennsylvania legislature into passing new legislative standards for doors, landings, lighting, curtains, fire extinguishers, aisles, and marked exits. All doors were required to open outward and remain unlocked. Pennsylvania governor Edwin Stuart signed Pennsylvania's first fire law on May 3, 1909. The building of apartments and stores has now been built on the former opera house's site with a plaque commemorating the tragedy.

Description The term can refer to the head of kitchen staff in a great house or to the cook- housekeeper, a far less prestigious position involving more physical labour. The cook in an English great house was traditionally female; today's residences may employ a head cook or chef who may be of either gender. The cook is responsible for the preparation of daily meals and menus, as well as menus for parties and other special occasions. The cook is also responsible for the ordering of food, the maintenance of the kitchen and for keeping accounts with local merchants. The holder of the position reports directly to the lady of the house or sometimes to the housekeeper. The cook supervises all kitchen staff. In large households, especially at a noble or royal court, this comprises an elaborate hierarchy, at the bottom of which come the kitchen boys (who, despite the name, were not always minors), in the largest households even further subdivided, perhaps the lowliest position being that of spitboy or turnbrooch, who had to remain close to the hot fire to turn the roasting meat; there were six at Hampton Court palace in Henry VIII's reign. There can be occasional staff conflicts over who supervises between staff, who may have duties that bring them into the realms of the cook, the housekeeper and the butler. In the hierarchy of domestic service, a cook usually earned her position through apprenticeship, perhaps beginning in service as a kitchen maid. Today's cooks are likely to have spent years in domestic service in different households, or have gone to cooking school. Few modern families can afford retinues of domestic workers, so the cook is often expected to be a cook-housekeeper and responsible for cleaning and nannying as well.

Early life  Christopher Richter Robison was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the younger of two sons of poet Margaret Robison and John G. Robison, former head of the philosophy department at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. He is eight years younger than his brother, fellow memoirist John Elder Robison. He was raised in various towns in Massachusetts, including Shutesbury, Amherst, and Northampton. His older brother had already escaped the unstable home before their parents divorced on July 29, 1978. His mother then sent the 12-year-old Christopher to live with the family of her psychiatrist, Dr. Rodolph Harvey Turcotte, whose ever-changing collection of children, adopted children and patients lived in a large ramshackle property in Northampton. Robison's mother assigned legal guardianship to Turcotte, who believed that children became adults at 13. A few months after Robison moved in, Turcotte allowed him to drop out of sixth grade. Education and writing career Robison obtained a GED at age 17; at age 18, living on his own in Boston, he legally changed his name to Augusten Xon Burroughs. He later enrolled at Holyoke Community College in Holyoke, Massachusetts, as a pre-med student, dropping out before the end of the first semester. He decided to settle in New York City and worked for a Manhattan-based advertising company. In 1996, he sought treatment for alcoholism at a rehabilitation center in Minnesota before returning to Manhattan. Some of Burroughs' childhood experiences were chronicled in his successful first memoir, Running with Scissors (2002), which was later made into a film by the same name. East Village. In addition to Scissors, Burroughs penned a second memoir, Dry (2003), about his experience during and after treatment for alcoholism. It was followed by two collections of memoir essays, Magical Thinking (2003) and Possible Side Effects (2006). His first novel, Sellevision (2000), is currently in production as a feature film. Burroughs' writing focuses on subjects such as advertising, psychiatrists, religious families, and home shopping networks. It has appeared in publications such as The New York Times, House & Garden, BlackBook, New York, The Times, Bark, Attitude, and Out. Burroughs writes a monthly column for Details. Early in his career, he was a regular commentator on National Public Radio's Morning Edition. In 2005, Universal Studios and Red Wagon Productions bought the rights to a film based on a then-unreleased memoir about Burroughs' relationship with his father. The book, called A Wolf at the Table, was released on April 29, 2008. In October 2009, Burroughs released You Better Not Cry: Stories for Christmas, a book of short Christmas stories based on true events that occurred during his childhood. In 2012, Burroughs released This Is How, a book of advice and memoirs. Burroughs released his latest book, Toil & Trouble: A Memoir, in October 2019. The work details his experience coming out as \\"a witch\\" and moving from his apartment in New York City into a mansion in Connecticut with his husband. Burroughs' books are published by St. Martin's Press and Picador. Personal life In a January 2005 interview, reflecting on his life with his then partner, graphic designer Dennis Pilsits, Burroughs said paying tax should allow same-sex couples full legal entitlements: > That's what gay people need to be allowed to do ‚Äì get married. Not have > domestic partnerships; that's not acceptable. I don't believe for a moment > [gay marriage] would destroy the sanctity of marriage. But let's just say > for a moment that it does. Well, then the sanctity of marriage just has to > be destroyed. It's just too bad. You can't have one set of benefits and only > give them to some of the people. Burroughs divides time between New York City and Amherst, Massachusetts. On April 1, 2013, Burroughs married his longtime agent and companion Christopher Schelling at the Staten Island Borough Hall of New York City. Burroughs has been profiled in People, The Guardian, and Entertainment Weekly, where he ranked 15 on the 2005 list of \\"The 25 Funniest People in America\\" and was named to the magazine's \\"It List\\". Burroughs was presented with a special Trustee Award at the Lambda Literary Awards in 2013. Lawsuit over Running with Scissors The family of Dr. Turcotte (who died in 2000), Burroughs' legal guardian when he was a child, were concerned about the depiction of the Finch family in Running with Scissors. In August 2007, Burroughs and his publisher, St. Martin's Press, settled with the Turcotte family, who stated that their presentation as the Finch family was largely fictional\\"Ruthless with Scissors\\", Vanity Fair, Buzz Bissinger. January 2007. and written in a sensational manner. The Turcottes originally sought damages of $2 million for invasion of privacy, defamation, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Burroughs defended his work as \\"entirely accurate,\\" but agreed to call the work a \\"book\\" (instead of \\"memoir\\") in the author's note, to alter the acknowledgments page in future editions to recognize the Turcotte family's conflicting memories of described events, and express regret for \\"any unintentional harm\\" to the Turcotte family.\\"Burroughs Settles Lawsuit with Scissors Family\\", USA Today, Rodrique Ngowi.

A non- profit community radio station for Franco-Ontarians in Toronto, Ontario, the station broadcasts at 105.1 on the FM dial. CHOQ is also available as a digital television radio feed on Rogers Cable in the Greater Toronto Area on channel 957. CHOQ's studios are located on Lansdowne Avenue (near Dundas Street West) in the Dufferin Grove neighbourhood, while its transmitter is located atop First Canadian Place. CHOQ is owned by a cooperative, La Coop√©rative Radiophonique de Toronto. History The history of this station dates back to 1991, when the group was granted a special temporary FM licence for a French-language community radio programming undertaking at Toronto, on a frequency of 99.1 MHz.Decision CRTC 91-369 The station would broadcast programs during \\"La Semaine fran√ßaise √† Toronto\\", from June 16 to 23, 1991 and was incorporated as \\"La Coop√©rative radiophonique de Toronto inc.\\" on July 5 the same year. On June 16, 2000, the station was denied a licence to operate a French-language community FM radio station at Toronto on the frequency 93.5 MHz.Decision CRTC 2000-206 This 93.5 frequency was awarded to CFXJ-FM. On April 17, 2003, La Coop√©rative radiophonique de Toronto inc. received CRTC approval for a new French-language community FM radio station at Toronto, to operate at 105.1 MHz.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2003-116 On October 18, 2004 the station received a $75,000 startup grant from the Ontario Trillium Foundation. The station's launch was originally scheduled for 2005. The station did air a testing signal for three weeks in November of that year, but did not launch its permanent signal until May 1, 2006. CHOQ-FM was one of 27 applicants for the 88.1 frequency vacated by the revocation in early 2011 of CKLN-FM's license,\\"Stations vie for vacant radio licence\\".

It is misnamed, as it lives on level land. Unlike most plovers, it is usually not found near bodies of water or even on wet soil; it prefers dry habitat with short grass (usually due to grazing) and bare ground. Description The word plover came from a Latin world pluvia which means \\"rain\\". In Medieval England some migratory birds became known as plovers because they returned to their breeding grounds each spring with rain. In 1832 American naturalist John Kirk Townsend spotted a species of unknown bird near the Rocky Mountains, and assumed that all these birds live in mountains. The plover comes back each spring to its breeding grounds, and so the wrong name mountain plover was given to the species. The mountain plover is 8 to 9.5 inches (20 to 24 cm) long and weighs about 3.7 ounces (105 grams). Its wingspread is 17.5 to 19.5 inches (44.5 to 49.5 cm). The mountain plover's call consists of a low, variable whistle. Both sexes are of the same size. In appearance it is typical of Charadrius plovers, except that unlike most, it has no band across the breast. The upperparts are sandy brown and the underparts and face are whitish. There are black feathers on the forecrown and a black stripe from each eye to the bill (the stripe is brown and may be indistinct in winter); otherwise the plumage is plain. The mountain plover is much quieter than its relative the killdeer. Its calls are variable, often low-pitched trilled or gurgling whistles. In courtship it makes a sound much like a far-off cow mooing. Distribution It breeds in the high plains of North America from extreme southeastern Alberta and southwestern Saskatchewan to northern New Mexico and the Texas panhandle, as well as an isolated site in the Davis Mountains of West Texas. About 85 percent of the population winters in the San Joaquin and Imperial Valleys in California. Its winter range also extends along the U.S.-Mexican border, more extensively on the Mexican side. The mountain plover needs about 70 acres of territory for breeding, and about 25 acres for survival in non-breeding times. Around late July, mountain plovers leave their breeding range for a period of post-breeding wandering around the southern Great Plains. Little is known about their movements at this time, although they are regularly seen around Walsh, Colorado and on sod farms in central New Mexico. By early November, most move southward and westward to their wintering grounds. Spring migration is apparently direct and non-stop. Ecology and status It feeds mostly on insects and other small arthropods. It often associates with livestock, which attract and stir up insects. Mountain plovers nest on bare ground in early spring (April in northern Colorado). The breeding territory must have bare round with short, sparse vegetation. Plovers usually select a breeding range that they share with bison and black tailed prairie dogs. These animals are grazers that keep vegetation short. Plovers like to nest among prairie dog colonies because the foraging and burrowing that these animals do expose even more bare soil which creates an ideal habitat for plover nest sites. It is believed that plovers like to nest on bare soil because they blend into the land hiding them from birds that may prey on them and the short vegetation allows them to easily detect predators on the ground. It is also believed it is easier for them to spot insects to eat. A mountain plover nest has a survival rate that ranges from 26 to 65%. This wide range may be due to the impact that varying climate has on nest survival. A nest made in a colder climate with less precipitation has a better chance of survival. These conditions are preferred because of the climate's effect on the eggs directly, changes in predatory behavior, or changes in vegetation that can affect the mortality rates of parents. Higher heat may expose eggs to heat stress;also, a wetter climate may factor in to predators having a more sensitive sense of smell, aiding the discovery of nests. Nest predators are the biggest cause of nest destruction. Because of this, it is a primary driving force of survival rate. Increase in soil moisture may the environment of bare grounds and short grass that prairie birds thrive in. Their breeding season extends over the summer months and ends some time around late July or early August. During mating the male will set a territory and perform displays to attract a female. Females lay multiple clutches of eggs with three eggs to a clutch; the eggs are off-white with blackish spots. Egg size decreases as the breeding season goes on because of the high energy cost on the females. It has been found that eggs laid during a time of drought tend to be larger providing the incubating chick with more nourishment and so a greater chance at survival. Mountain plovers perform uniparental incubation by both sexes. Females leave their first clutch to be incubated and tended to by the male and then lay a second clutch, which she tends to herself. This type of incubation suits the mountain plover well and allows for a greater yield of chicks compared to similar species of birds in which both the male and female tend a single clutch together. Females can mate with several males and have several male tended nests in one breeding season. This would result in a greater reproductive success for the female but there is a high energy cost on the female laying so many eggs and so it is more common for a female to lay only two clutches. If the eggs survive various dangers, especially such predators as coyotes, snakes, and swift foxes, they hatch in 28 to 31 days, and the hatchlings leave the nest within a few hours. In the next two or three days, the family usually moves one to two kilometers from the nest site to a good feeding area, often near a water tank for livestock. The population has been estimated at between 5,000 and 10,000 adult birds, although those numbers have recently been revised to the range of 11,000 to 14,000, with a total population estimate of about 15,000 to 20,000. In March 2009, a multi-agency report, the first of its kind, issued by the Cornell University Lab of Ornithology in conjunction with federal agencies and other organizations, indicated that the mountain plover is one of the birds showing serious declines in population.Many bird populations in trouble, report says. CNN (2009-03-19). Retrieved on 2011-05-10. The population of mountain plovers is in decline because of cultivation, urbanization, and over- grazing of their living space. Fritz Knopf has closely studied the mountain plover, and has tracked population declines. These downhill trends led to a 1999 proposal to list them as a threatened species. On June 29, 2009 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service published a proposed rule to list the mountain plover as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.FR Doc 2010-15583. Edocket.access.gpo.gov. Retrieved on 2011-05-10. Preservation A 2005 report details that in a study conducted by Stephen J Dinsmore, Gary C White, and Fritz L Knopf, the populations of mountain plovers and prairie dogs in southern Phillips County in north-central Montana were observed in the effort to provide clues about the ecosystem and mountain plover preservation. Mountain plovers like to build their habitats in prairie dog colonies, meaning that an increase in prairie dogs will coincide with an increase in mountain plovers. This knowledge can be useful in mountain plover conservation efforts. The loss of prairie dog colonies is a huge threat to mountain plovers in Montana; if prairie dog colonies can be preserved, there is a greater chance that mountain plovers can be saved. Other proposed plans of preservation include protecting remaining breeding and wintering habitats, and stopping the conversion of grasslands for agricultural purposes. The connection between mountain plovers and prairie dogs is particularly strong in Montana, but less so in the grasslands of Colorado and the grasslands and shrub-steppe habitats of Wyoming. In places where prairie dogs aren't as prominent in the ecosystem, fire or grazing can act as substitutes for prairie dogs in creating suitable plover nesting because they maintain low vegetation. In the construction of suitable plover habitats, more success would be found in short-grass prairie habitats. However, concerning conservation, a large portion of the overall plover population breeds near the northern limit of their range in Montana, and it would be wise to make this area a conservation priority. The population of plovers in Wyoming is lower than that of other states, but Wyoming's population of mountain plovers and mostly intact expanses of grazed rangeland will probably become much more important in the coming years as urban and agricultural development continues in contiguous states. In Oklahoma, 90% of mapped mountain plover locations are in cultivated fields, often bare and flat. Their preferred land areas contain clay loam soils, as the sandier soils are less reliable when sand can easily be blown around, covering nests, obscuring vision, and irritating eyes. Additional study is needed to help ensure the continued presence of mountain plovers in Oklahoma. Mountain plover populations should continue to be monitored and investigated so as to understand how to support their survival. Plovers are important to the ecosystem at large because they are considered indicators of the health of their respective habitats. Local population managers can best help the plovers by protecting the land and prairie dog colonies from human disturbances such as mining, and monitoring the size and health of suitable plover habitat in each region. Lower chick survival contributes to the decline in population. Efforts to increase nest survival provides minimal growth when compared to ensuring juvenile chick survival. Population growth can be helped more by learning more about post-egg survival. Footnotes References * Knopf, Fritz L. (1997): A Closer Look: Mountain Plover.

Most of the land runs along the R√≠o Pl√°tano. The reserve has a number of endangered species and some of Honduras largest sections of forest. It has been a World Heritage site and biosphere reserve since 1982. In 2011, UNESCO placed the reserve on the List of World Heritage in Danger. The reserve encompasses both mountainous and lowland tropical rainforest, full of diverse wildlife and plant life, and has more than 2000 inhabitants. The reserve is part of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor that stretches from Mexico southwards through Central America. Although the reserve covers a large portion of Honduras, very little is recorded about the biological diversity within it. While previous management plans have proven successful, a continued investigation into ongoing management plans and future conservation issues will be necessary to keep this valuable reserve safe. Currently there are threats to the conservation of the reserve which include illegal hunting, logging and clearing of land to graze cattle. Recent rafting expeditions from the Rio Pl√°tano headwaters through all three zones of the reserve (cultural, buffer and core) have documented cattle grazing in the core zone, commercial fishing and hunting camps along the river and clear cutting of forest near Las Marias. History In 1960, the land was set aside as the \\"Cuidad Blanca Archaeological Reserve,\\" named after the rumored ancient settlement known as la Ciudad Blanca. The reserve was renamed \\"R√≠o Pl√°tano Biosphere Reserve\\" in 1980 and added to the World Heritage list in 1982. A management and development was designed in 1980 and implemented in 1987 by the Department of Natural Renewable Resources. In 1997, an additional 3250 km¬≤ was designated as a buffer zone for the reserve. In 1997, the German Development Bank began a plan that would significantly expand the reserve to the Patuca River and the Bosawas Biosphere Reserve in Nicaragua. Currently, the German plan has been delayed. =Archeological sites= The reserve still has over 200 archeological sites, including the point where Christopher Columbus first arrived in mainland America. The reserve also contains ruined settlements, including stone from buildings and roads, rock carvings, and other remains. Few of these sites are protected, in fact some have been looted and many are a significant factor for tourism. Although the archeological value of the region initially played a large part in the formation of the reservation, the reservation currently focuses mostly on the protection of the forests. According to tradition, La Ciudad Blanca is located in the region. Over the years, many professional and amateur archeologists have claimed to find it, but none have produced credible evidence and most professionals remain skeptical that it ever existed. Local population The reserve is home for more than 2,000 indigenous people and a growing number of migrant inhabitants. The population includes four very different and unique cultural groups: Miskito, Pech, Garifunas, and the ladino. The smaller groups, the Pech, Garifunas, and Miskito inhabitants live mostly in the north, alongside the river. These people have a variety of rights to the land and mostly use the land for agriculture. The smaller-scale agriculture of the Pech is easily made sustainable. Many of the largest group, the ladino, entered the reserve from the south. Conflict over land rights is a prominent source of conflict between ethnic groups. Current conflict over land rights involves non native peoples invading and threatening indigenous land owners‚Äîforcing them from their historical lands. Conservation In 1996 the reserve received the World Heritage in Danger designation. A reserve management plan, implemented in 2000, included macrozoning, subzoning, and specific plans for conservation issues. The macrozoning plan established buffer zones, cultural zones, and nucleus zones. The overall threat, especially in the nucleus zones, had decreased in 2006 recognizing a significant improvement in conservation efforts, leading to the removal of the World Heritage in Danger designation in 2007. From recent investigations in 2010 and 2011, however, it appears that what ever gains were initially recognized, that is not the case currently. UNESCO recently (2011) did a mission to the Rio Pl√°tano and found illegal activity within the core zone. Drug smuggling, clearing of land for cattle grazing, and illegal fishing and hunting along the river are currently happening. In 2011, UNESCO placed the reserve on the List of World Heritage in Danger. The area is protected by policy from the Department of Protected Areas & Wildlife, State Forestry Administration in Honduras, and receives some funding from the World Wildlife Fund and other private organizations. A number of governmental and non-governmental organizations and committees have developed and implemented conservation plans in the region. The main goal of the reserve is to protect the land from deforestation and development. The reserve‚Äôs conservation plan aims to integrate local inhabitants into their environment via sustainable agricultural practices (see La Ruta Moskitia Ecotourism Alliance). Indigenous populations play a large part into the success of the conservation plan, both inside the reservation and outside the reservation in the buffer zones. Assigning titles and recognizing de facto property rights played an important part of the beginning of the conservation plan in the reserve. There is currently a need to update any conservation plan for the reserve. The conservation plan requests continued commitment to clarifying land ownership in and around the reserve. More research needs to be done to understand the value of the reserve and the potential threats it faces. There are currently no park guards or any official entity actively patrolling or guarding the reserve. Climate The annual precipitation is between , and the local inhabitants have noticed a trend towards dryer seasons. The climate in the region is key to preserving the valuable wet forests and important for the agriculture upon which the indigenous people depend. The reserve also receives an average of four severe tropical storms every ten years. The tropical storms echo through the rest of the reserve through the numerous waterways. Development plans and agriculture depend upon the river‚Äôs natural levees to drain water from low-lying areas. The after- effects of the Hurricane Mitch in 1998 disrupted the development of the Patuca II hydroelectric facility. Geography The land stretches from La Moskitia coast through lagoons and along the R√≠o Pl√°tano up into the mountains. The buffer area also includes the Paulaya and Sico valley, and will eventually extend to the Patuca River. The reserve is mostly mountainous, including Pico Dama, a giant granite formation, and Punta Piedra, the highest peak at . The reserve includes nearly the entire watershed of the R√≠o Pl√°tano, and many other smaller waterways. Much of the region is covered with mountainous terrain. The rivers wind through both the lower and mountainous regions. The forms many oxbows as it crosses the long stretch of flat lowland that separates the foothills from the lagoons. The river has created oxbow lakes, marshes, and natural levees. The geography of the region makes agriculture and conservation especially complicated. The low-land areas covered with water throughout the winter, and the rivers and the various tributaries house a wide variety of flora. The coastal region to the north is more commonly documented, so the rest of the region needs more thorough exploration. Flora and fauna Baird's tapir Brown-throated sloth The reserve contains part of the largest surviving area of undisturbed tropical rainforest in Honduras and one of the few remaining in Central America, with numerous endangered species. Although there is a growing amount of research available on the biodiversity within the reserve, the current management plans emphasize the need for more research on the flora and fauna of the region. =Flora= The major ecosystems include mangrove and freshwater swamps and marshes, sedge prairie, pine savanna, and gallery forest. There is a diverse amount of flora, estimated at over 2,000 species of vascular plants, although little has been written about it because many species are new or undiscovered. Jaguar There are two major mangrove ecosystems along the coast: the Brus Lagoon and the Iban Lagoon. The Brus area is 120 km¬≤ and brackish, and the Ibans area is 63 km¬≤ and freshwater. The mangroves are valuable and fragile, so they are a significant part of the value of the reserve. Puma Further in, the land becomes prairie and savannah with pine and palm, depending upon the availability of water. Along the watershed of the rivers, the vegetation is thick wet forest, which is again, poorly studied. Giant anteater =Fauna= The documented fauna of the region includes 39 species of mammals, 377 species of birds and 126 species of reptiles and amphibians. The region is rich with birds, including the king vulture, harpy eagle, great curassow, crested guan, scarlet macaw, green macaw and military macaw. Collared peccary Mantled howler The representative species include white-headed capuchin, mantled howler and spider monkeys, brown- throated sloth, paca, kinkajou, coatimundi tayra, Central American otter, puma, collared peccary, white-lipped peccary and red brocket. =Rare and endangered species= The rare or endangered species: giant anteater, jaguar, ocelot, margay, Caribbean West Indian manatee, and Central American tapir. The amount of environmental education that exists in Honduras is minimal, so it is difficult to protect these endangered species. The widespread poverty and lack of accurate research on the ecosystems makes protection increasingly difficult. While the conservation programs are reaching their goals, it is difficult to tell whether or not the management plans are successfully protecting these species directly. Protecting the ecosystems, like the rainforest, upon which the endangered species depend serves as an important indirect benefit. Tourism The high density of wildlife along La Mosquitia coast makes it a popular destination for ecotourists. Although private organizations are launching ecotourism enterprises throughout the region, the government does not have a comprehensive plan to control or benefit from ecotourists. Ecotourism can offer relief for poverty stricken local populations, increased awareness of biological value, and can generate income that can be used to fund projects for the reserve. Currently there are guided 10- to 12-day rafting trips being offered down the entire length of the Rio Pl√°tano. Although a properly implemented tourist industry could benefit the reserve, the currently unregulated industry has created a large amount of traffic and damaged archeological sites. The tourism industry has an impact across the entire reserve, but the unprotected archeological sites are especially hurt. Without developing infrastructure, it is difficult to have a profitable and sustainable ecotourism industry, especially in a reserve with difficult conservation issues. Conservation issues Despite its removal from the World Heritage in Danger designation, the reserve still faces a few conservation threats. Logging and development continue to be problems, and the situation is exacerbated by an increasing population from poorer parts of Honduras or refugees from Nicaragua. =Logging= The government regulates the logging industry in Honduras through the Honduran Cooperation for Forestry Development. Despite oversight of these and other organizations and a moratorium on logging inside the reserve, mahogany continues to be cut and removed. The Honduran government has failed to pass laws strict enough to have a substantial impact on preventing deforestation. The entire reserve could quickly disappear, even through unregulated deforestation. Local populations admit that a large amount mahogany is leaving the reserve, but many poorer sections of the economy see the high price of mahogany as enough incentive to clear away valuable ecosystems that provide irreplaceable services to the water and soil. The loggers behind much of the reserve‚Äôs deforestation is still mostly unknown. =Development= Development within and around the reserve poses a problem for the conservation plans. The construction of the Patuca II hydroelectric plant in the Patuca river highlights the elements of the debate. A hydroelectric plant does more than affect the waterway where it is built. It also requires infrastructure that disturbs the environment around it. A lot of the reserve does not have developed roadways or power. A hydroelectric facility would require development throughout the reserve. Agriculture throughout the reserve poses a more direct threat. As the populations expand within the reserve, so do their agricultural operations. Much of the wetland area is unsuitable for agriculture, needing levees and continued development to be productive. Much of the non-legal de facto ownership has spurred conflict, sometimes violent, among different cultural groups over rights to agriculturally productive areas. Poorer farmers resort to destructive techniques, like slash-and-burn, that are particularly damaging to the savannah and prairie land. Although the current management plan aims to educate farmers about these destructive practices, they continue. Future management goals aim to promote sustainable technique among a larger number of the traditional farmers. =Refugees= Poverty in Honduras and neighboring Nicaragua, and an increasing number of hurricanes have driven many refugees into the reserve, making conservation efforts increasingly complicated. These refugees often enter through the south of the reserve, and sometimes create more conflict integrating with the indigenous populations. While traditional farming practices can be somewhat destructive, the stress created by larger populations is much more damaging to the reserve. Currently, the Honduran Corporation for Forestry Development with the help of the Honduran Public Safety Force polices the reserve, hoping to decrease the number of people who invade. Regardless of their efforts, refugees continue to enter. The reservation considered a plan to relocate refugees outside the reserve, creating both an increased buffer and reducing the stress within the reserve. This plan was met with political opposition.

While researching the life and works of Leonardo da Vinci, including \\"his part in faking the Turin Shroud\\" which the authors document in their book Turin Shroud‚Äî In Whose Image?, they discover a number of signs of unorthodox Christian thinking in the imagery used to portray some of the central characters in the New Testament, especially John the Baptist. Some paintings examined for their unusual choice of imagery include the two versions of Madonna of the Rocks and The Last Supper. In the latter painting, they propose that the person in the painting seated, from a viewer's point of view, to the left of Jesus is Mary Magdalene rather than John the Apostle, as most art historians identify that person. Furthermore, they point out that their body angles form the letter M, a reference to the Magdalene, and that she and Jesus are dressed in similar but oppositely colored clothes, a negative image of each other. They also mention a number of other signs: a mystery knife pointed at one of the characters, that Leonardo da Vinci himself is in the painting with his face pointing away from Jesus, and that Jesus is confronted by an admonishing hand to his right making ‚Äúthe John gesture,‚Äù an index finger pointing up. In trying to understand the significance of these unusual images they conducted research into what they term a ‚Äúthread of heresy‚Äù that reaches back over 2000 years. They claim to find evidence for this occult tradition in such assorted subjects as The Knights Templar, the Cathars, Gnosticism, the Holy Grail, and the legends connected with southern France, and in particular the town of Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau. They utilise the historical and biblical scholarship of such people as Morton Smith, Hugh J. Schonfield, G.R.S. Mead, Frances A. Yates, and Geza Vermes on which to build their claims. Among their conclusions are the following: * Jesus was a disciple of John the Baptist, and that John's religious teachings were essentially that of the Egyptian mystery religion of Isis-Osiris-Horus. * Jesus was initiated into the inner circle of John the Baptist, but was not selected to succeed him. Rather it was Simon Magus who was selected as John the Baptist's successor. * Mary Magdalene had a ritualized, ‚Äúsacred‚Äù sexual relationship with Jesus, in keeping with their religious beliefs, and as his initiator into the sacred mysteries had an equal relationship to Jesus. * Politics and religion were synonymous in ancient Israel, and Jesus was an astute and aggressive political competitor against John. * The Jesus group may have been responsible for the death of John the Baptist. * Jesus‚Äô disciples were not initiated into the inner mysteries of his teachings. * The term Christ had a different significance to the participants in the biblical drama than they do nowadays. To those in John the Baptist's circle it would have referred to all who were baptized and initiated into the arcana of their belief system. * Numerous images and stories in the canonical New Testament are in actuality adaptations of those found in other religious traditions, and are not unique. * Jesus is one in a line of many dying-and- rising gods, who share many similar traits. The authors offer, but not claim, that perhaps Leonardo da Vinci was sending veiled messages through his art, which could be understood only by others who were open to their meaning. And while on the surface these paintings seem to be simple biblical depictions, they represent in fact his belief in the superiority of John the Baptist over Jesus.  Perspective and criticism  Seven years after this book was published, some of the ideas presented in this and other similar books (e.g. The Last Templar), have become central to the best-selling 2003 novel The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown. It may seem that The Templar Revelation even provided Brown with the title of his novel: one chapter is called \\"The Secret Code of Leonardo Da Vinci\\". Brown's reliance on The Templar Revelation is also confirmed by the fact that he imports certain factual errors from this book (see √âglise Saint-Sulpice, Paris for an example).

The parish includes the village of Purton Stoke and the hamlets of Bentham, Hayes Knoll, Purton Common, Restrop, the Fox and Widham. The River Key, a tributary of the Thames, crosses the parish near Purton Stoke. The village is a linear settlement along the old road between the historic market towns of Cricklade to the north and Royal Wootton Bassett to the south. Purton is on a minor road from the B4553 and from junction 16 of the M4 motorway. The village is on the brow of a hill, with views across to Cricklade and the Thames floodplain. Nearby, Bradon Forest stretches out to Minety in the west. Village amenities include several shops, a sub-post office, a library, public houses and restaurants, a GP's practice, dentist and veterinary surgery. The village has grown such that its retailers are not all concentrated in one centre. A few shops are on the main road at the junction with Pavenhill, and a few are around the bend in the road near the village hall. The Church of England parish church of Saint Mary the Virgin is unusual in having a tower at each end, one of which has a spire. It is one of only three parish churches in England with both a spire and another tower. The other two are at nearby Wanborough, Wiltshire, and Ormskirk, Lancashire. History Purton in a copper engraving of about 1830 The toponym Purton is derived from the Old English pirige for \\"pear\\" and tun for \\"enclosure\\" or \\"homestead\\". =Early history= Ringsbury Camp has evidence of settlement during the Neolithic period but is considered to be an Iron Age hill fort dating from about 50 BC. There is a suggestion that the remains of a Roman villa lie under the soil at Pavenhill, on the Braydon side of Purton. At the Fox on the east side of the village, grave goods and bodies from a pagan Saxon cemetery have been excavated. The earliest known written record of Purton dates from AD 796 when the Saxon King Ecgfrith of Mercia gave 35 hides from Purton to the Benedictine Malmesbury Abbey. The Abbot of Malmesbury continued to be the chief landlord of Purton throughout Saxon and Norman times, suggesting that an earlier church stood at Purton. The ancient royal hunting forest of Bradon stretches out to Minety in the west. In ancient times it encompassed about 30,000 acres. =Civil War= It is thought a battle took place during the English Civil War in the Restrop area. A cannonball was discovered in the area and several place names refer to a battle, including the alternative name of Restrop Road, Red Street (which may signify the road was covered in blood) and Battlewell. A mile away are Battle Lake in Braydon Wood, and Battlelake Farm. =Railway= The Cheltenham and Great Western Union Railway through the parish was opened in 1841 and was absorbed by the Great Western Railway in 1843. Purton railway station opened in 1841 to the north of the village, in the hamlet of Widham. The station closed in 1963 but the line remains open. =Second World War= There are a number of concrete pillboxes in the parish, which were part of the defences of Southern England during the Second World War. They form part of the GHQ Line Red, along which an anti-tank trench also ran, between Ballards Ash near Royal Wootton Bassett and the River Ray near Blunsdon railway station. RAF Blakehill Farm, north of Purton Stoke, was a RAF Transport Command station that operated from 1944 until 1946. United States troops were stationed in Braydon Wood, and attended dances at the Angel Hotel. Anti-tank devices (chains across the road, set in concrete blocks) were installed on the parish boundary across Tadpole Bridge that spans the River Ray. The Cenotaph on Purton High Street is a memorial to those who died in both world wars. =Local studies= A study of the interconnections of people within the parish, based on the registers and other historical evidence, since the earliest recorded period, is being prepared (2006) under the working title, The Plenteous Pear Tree: Pedigrees and Progress of Purton's People Past and Present, a parish prosopography of Purton, Wiltshire, with ramifications elsewhere in North Wilts. and beyond, under the auspices of Richard Carruthers-≈ªurowski, a Canadian-based, Oxford- trained historian and genealogist. Volume 18 of the Wiltshire Victoria County History, published in 2011, covers Purton. Religious sites The Church of England parish church of St Mary the Virgin appears at one time to have been dedicated to Saint Nicholas. The building is from the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries and was restored by William Butterfield in 1872. In 1955 it was designated as Grade I listed. There was a Friends' meeting house at Purton Stoke during the late 17th century and early 18th century. There was a Congregational chapel, licensed in 1829, where the Scout Hut is now in Purton High Street. Congregational use ceased in the 1920s and it was demolished in 1969. There were two Methodist chapels in Purton village. The Primitive Methodist chapel was built at Upper Square in 1856 and enlarged in 1893; the Wesleyan Methodist chapel at Play Close was built in 1882, replacing a smaller chapel from the 1870s. By 1969, after declines in numbers, the two congregations united. The Play Close chapel was renovated and reopened in 1973 as Purton Methodist Church, then the Upper Square chapel was sold for residential use. There was a Methodist church opposite Dairy Farm in 1832 at Purton Stoke. It was demolished in 1868 and rebuilt in Pond Lane. This building was sold in 2011 and converted for residential use. Governance An electoral ward in the same name exists, covering the parishes of Purton and Braydon. The population of the ward taken at the 2011 census was 4,271. Education There are two schools in Purton: * St Mary's Church of England Primary School is housed in a modern building opened in 2012, funded by the government's Primary Capital Programme and built on the site of the former junior school. Previously the school was split between two sites, with infants taught in the original Victorian building which opened in 1861 while juniors were in nearby buildings which opened in the early 1970s, along with the school's swimming pool. * Bradon Forest School is the secondary school. It was built in 1962 and caters for pupils from Purton parish, Lydiard Millicent, Cricklade, Ashton Keynes and West Swindon. The school has no sixth form, so students go on to either Royal Wootton Bassett Academy, Cirencester College, Swindon College or New College, Swindon. Until 1978, Purton Stoke had its own primary school, on the Purton to Cricklade road. It opened in 1894 and at its peak had 100 pupils. However, numbers dropped continually from the 1930s when older pupils were educated in Purton, until there were only around 30 pupils left in the 1970s. The school closed in 1978. The building is now used for the Jubilee Gardens Project, a charity which provides education and training for adults with learning difficulties. Nature reserves There are four Wiltshire Wildlife Trust nature reserves in the parish: #Brockhurst Meadow is at the end of Brockhurst Lane, just below Ringsbury Camp. A rushy hay meadow with signs of ridge and furrow farming. Wildlife includes many wildflowers of wet meadows: ragged robin, sneezewort, meadowsweet, marsh thistle, common spotted orchid, heath spotted orchid, adder's-tongue fern, sedge species and the insects which feed on them such as the marbled white butterfly. . #Blakehill Farm, partly in Purton parish, is the former RAF Blakehill Farm airfield from the Second World War. Its grasslands are habitat for mammals including roe deer and brown hare, birds including kestrel, skylark, wheatear, whinchat and stonechat and butterflies include small copper and brown hairstreak. The trust bought the site from the Ministry of Defence to form a large meadow of about , and opened it to the public in 2005. It rears a small quantity of organic grade beef, usually rare breeds such as longhorn cattle. These cattle ensure grasses and other common plants do not begin to dominate over the other rarer plants. . #Stoke Common Meadows are at the end of Stoke Common Lane in Purton Stoke. A small wood and grasslands, with ancient hedgerows and ditches. The meadows are habitat for many wildflowers including pepper saxifrage, sweet vernal-grass, heath spotted orchid, adder's-tongue fern (Ophioglossum), bugle, ox-eye daisy and common knapweed. Some of the fields are a Site of Special Scientific Interest. . #Red Lodge Pond is at the beginning of Red Drive in Braydon Wood, just off the B4042 road between Braydon Crossroads and Minety Crossroads. The reserve includes a large pond and a small meadow with a concrete platform in the middle: the remains of an old sawmill. Wildlife includes plants such as water horsetail, common spotted orchid; and woodland butterflies including Eurasian white admiral and silver- washed fritillary. . Restrop Farm and Brockhurst Wood is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. It is at the end of Mud Lane, or at the end of Brockhurst Lane, but is mainly private land. Brockhurst Meadow is part of the farm. Public houses There are three pubs in the parish: * Angel Hotel in the High Street, thought to be the oldest pub in the village, dating from 1704. * Royal George at Pavenhill, the west end of the village. * The Bell at Purton Stoke. There are two members' clubs: the Red House Club on Church Street, and the working men's club, now Purton Club, on Station Road. Several former pubs in Purton have closed: * Blue Pig was on Purton's boundary at the Brinkworth to Minety and Purton to Garsdon crossroads near to Ravensroost Wood. It closed in the late 20th century. * Forester's Arms was next door to the Royal George in Pavenhill. It closed in 1904. * Another pub called the Forester's Arms was situated on the parish boundary at Common Platt. It closed in 2010. * Fox Inn served the Fox area. * Railway Hotel was renamed the Ghost Train after British Railways closed Purton railway station in 1963. The pub closed in 2008. * Hope Inn at the Collins Lane junction was closed in 1995 and is now the Elmgrove Saddlery. * Live and Let Live in Upper Pavenhill had the best views of any pub in the parish, looking over the Braydon area. It closed in 1967. * Mason's Arms was in a house in the Upper Square. It was a pub until 1945. * New Greyhound in Pavenhill. It closed in early 2008. * Queen's Arms was near the sub-post office in the High Street. Sports and leisure Purton has a Non- League football team Purton F.C. who play at the Red House. Purton Youth Football Club has teams ranging from under sevens to under eighteens. The club has gained FA Charter Club Standard and is affiliated to Wiltshire Football Association. Purton has a tennis club, based in the centre of the village.Purton Tennis Club The cricket club, founded in 1820, claims to be the oldest in Wiltshire.Purton Cricket Club Notable people People connected with Purton include: *The Rt. Hon. Sir Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury *The Lady Anne Hyde, Duchess of York, first wife of James II of England *Dave Gregory, long-time guitarist and keyboard player in the English rock band XTC, spent his childhood in the village *The Right Honourable Sir Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon *James Kibblewhite, pre-Olympic English running champion *The Reverend Dr Nevil Maskelyne, D.D., 5th Astronomer Royal (from 1765 til his death in 1811), buried next to the parish church *Dr Desmond Morris, zoologist *The Reverend John Papworth, clergyman, writer and activist *Billie Piper, singer and actress =Local families= Maskelyne In the Tudor period the Maskelyne family were significant landlords and landowners in Purton, having inherited rights granted by the last Abbot of Malmesbury Abbey to the Pulley or Pulleyne family, from whom they descended on the distaff side. The Reverend Dr Nevil Maskelyne (1732‚Äì1811) was appointed Astronomer Royal in 1765. The Maskelynes were involved in Purton life for more than four centuries from the 16th century. Nevil Maskelyne was born in London, lived at Down Farm and is buried in Purton churchyard. A Miss Maskelyne who lived in the village died in the 1960s aged over 100. Hyde and Ashley-Cooper The Royalist statesman and author Edward Hyde, who served as MP for the nearby Wootton Bassett constituency in the 1630s, lived at College Farm in the centre of Purton. It is likely that his daughter Anne Hyde, first wife of James II also lived here for a time. After serving Charles II during his years of exile under the Commonwealth and Republic, Hyde later became Lord Chancellor of England, was ennobled as Earl of Clarendon, and appointed Chancellor of the University of Oxford. Hyde's Whig arch-rival, Sir Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury, also had property in Purton parish. The Ashley-Cooper family also held the advowson of St. Mary's parish church. Sadler By the late 19th century and into the early part of the 20th century, other local families had risen to the gentry level after becoming significant landowners in the parish. Among these was James Henry Sadler, Esq., D.L., J.P., (1843‚Äì1929) who, though a Purton native, lived in nearby Lydiard House in the neighbouring parish of Lydiard Millicent until his death. A strict but generous benefactor, Sadler gave the cricket ground and Working Men's Institute to the village. Described as the last unofficial Squire of Purton, his father was Dr Samuel Champernowne Sadler, F.R.C.S., of Purton. In 1859 or 1860Critall, 1959, pages 386‚Äì388 Dr Sadler had the Pump House built at Salt's Hole, a natural mineral water spring near Purton Stoke, used for medicinal purposes since the Middle Ages and possibly earlier. Under Dr Sadler and subsequent owners, attempts were made to develop this natural attraction as Purton Spa, and to market the spring waters for their healing qualities.

Osborn III Convention Center is a convention center located in downtown Jacksonville, Florida. Opened in 1986, it was built incorporating Jacksonville Terminal Complex / Union Station as well as several thousand square feet of newly built structure. Located in the Jacksonville neighborhood of LaVilla, the Prime Osborn contains two exhibition halls totaling , several ballrooms and meetings rooms. The City of Jacksonville is looking to replace the Prime Osborn within the next decade, with a larger 500,000+ square foot convention center in downtown Jacksonville. The LaVilla station of the JTA Skyway is located across the street. History Last remaining segment of the original Union Depot, which opened in 1895 LaVilla, at that time a suburb of Jacksonville, was for many years an important railroad hub. The first union station in the area was built by the Savannah, Florida and Western Railway (later part of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad) in 1883. The Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railway (also later part of the ACL) began to use it in 1884. Other terminals served the Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad (later part of the Seaboard Air Line Railway), the Florida East Coast Railway, and the Georgia Southern and Florida Railway. The company was incorporated in 1894 by Henry Flagler, who owned the Florida East Coast Railway. Its first Union Depot opened on February 4, 1895, and was completed on January 15, 1897. It came to be known as the Flagler Depot. Ownership was split between five railroad companies, Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, Florida East Coast Railway, and Seaboard Air Line Railway each with 25% ownership, Southern Railway and Georgia Southern and Florida Railway each with 12.5% ownership. New Union Terminal, opening in 1919 When the second Union Station opened in 1919 (on the site of the original one), it was the largest railroad station in the South. At its peak, the terminal handled as many as 142 trains and 20,000 passengers a day.http://www.metrojacksonville.com/article/2010-jan-lost-jacksonville- union-terminal Some of the passenger trains handled in Jacksonville were 18 to 22 railcars long. Within the terminal, there was a restaurant, snack bars, news stands, a barber shop, florist, a drug store, and gift shops.http://www.flarr.com/jtc.htm The Jacksonville terminal had 32 tracks. 29 of those tracks were passenger tracks with platforms. Of those, 1-15 were stub or \\"head\\" tracks, which ended at the bumper posts. (Some of these massive decorative concrete posts still stand within the Convention Center Concourse). The station was last used on January 3, 1974; Amtrak moved to a new smaller station on the Northside. In 1982, a public-private partnership was started, led by former CSX chairman Prime F. Osborn III. The new convention center opened on October 17, 1986. Future and proposed projects First Coast Commuter Rail is a proposed passenger rail system serving Jacksonville, FL and the Northeast Florida region. It is currently in the early planning stages. Three routes were analyzed in depth: north to Yulee, FL, southwest to Green Cove Springs, FL, and southeast to St. Augustine, FL. Feasibility Study Final Report Brightline is a inter-city passenger rail system between Miami, FL and West Palm Beach, FL with an under-construction extension to Orlando, FL. Jacksonville is a likely expansion point for the near future, as the FEC Railway already owns the tracks running there.

After seven days, they flew to Vienna, Austria, where they held a Bagism press conference. During April 1969, Lennon and Ono sent acorns to the heads of state in various countries around the world in hopes that they would plant them as a symbol of peace. Their marriage (\\"You can get married in Gibraltar near Spain\\"), the first bed-in (\\"Talking in our beds for a week\\"), the Vienna press conference (\\"Made a lightning trip to Vienna...The newspapers said...\\"), and the acorns (\\"Fifty acorns tied in a sack\\") were all mentioned in the song \\"The Ballad of John and Yoko\\".1967‚Äì1970 lyric booklet Due to the couple's very public image, the Amsterdam bed-in was greeted by fans, and received a great deal of press coverage. Following the event, when asked if he thought the bed-in had been successful, Lennon became rather frustrated. He insisted that the failure of the press to take the couple seriously was part of what he and Ono wanted: \\"It's part of our policy not to be taken seriously. Our opposition, whoever they may be, in all manifest forms, don't know how to handle humour. And we are humorous.\\"Wiener, Jon: Come Together: John Lennon in His Time, page 91. Illini Books, 1991. However, Ono also earned controversy in the Jewish community for claiming during the press conference that Jewish women could've changed Hitler by becoming his girlfriend and sleeping with him for 10 days.https://jewishweek.timesofisrael.com/yoko-ono-if-only-hitler-had-sex- with-jewish-women/ It was acknowledged that some Nazis, including Nazi \\"First Lady\\" Magda Goebbels, had at one point in their lives had Jewish lovers. = Montreal bed-in = Recording \\"Give Peace a Chance\\".

Instead they intended to hold the event in the Bahamas at the Sheraton Oceanus Hotel, flying there on May 24, 1969, but after spending one night in the heat, they decided to move to Canada. They first landed in Toronto and stayed at the King Edward Hotel. They interviewed with Canadian Immigration and were granted a 10 Day Visitor Status. The choice was between Toronto and Montreal. Since they needed the New York press coverage, they decided to move it to Montreal because of its proximity to New York.https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2015/10/10/beatlemania-and-bed-ins- when-john-and-yoko-came-to-canada.html They flew to Montreal on May 26 where they stayed in Rooms 1738, 1740, 1742 and 1744 at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel. During their seven-day stay, they invited Timothy Leary, Tommy Smothers, Dick Gregory, Murray the K, Al Capp, Allen Ginsberg and others, and all but the hostile Capp sang on the peace anthem \\"Give Peace a Chance\\", recorded by Andr√© Perry in the hotel room on June 1, 1969. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation conducted interviews from the hotel room.Documentary series CBC Film The event received mixed reaction from the American press.Kruse, p. 17. In December 1969, Lennon and Ono spread their messages of peace with billboards reading \\"WAR IS OVER! If You Want It ‚Äì Happy Christmas From John and Yoko\\". These billboards went up in eleven major world cities.  Inspired bed-ins  The bed-in performance has since been re-interpreted and re-used in protests by a number of artists since 1969, most notably Marijke van Warmerdam with her gallerist Kees van Gelder at the same Amsterdam Hilton in 1992 and the Centre of Attention in 2005 in Miami. A fictional bed-in protest was also featured in a 2006 Viva Voce music video. In 2010, Liverpool's centre for the contemporary arts, Blue-coat, staged a 62-day event, Bed-in at the Blue-coat, which used Lennon & Ono's event as a template for 62 daily performances by artists, activists, community groups and others to do \\"something for a better world.\\" Ono gave her blessing and sent a video message. The project started on 9 October, on what would have been Lennon's 70th birthday, and ended on 9 December, which marked 30 years since his death.  In popular culture  The event was referenced in the song \\"Don't Look Back in Anger\\" by Oasis, in which lead singer Noel Gallagher sings \\"I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed / 'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head \\". The latter lyric was supposedly said by Lennon during a taped conversation he had at his room at The Dakota. In the music video for the Marcy Playground 1999 song, \\"It's Saturday\\", the group finds their way to the bed of John Lennon and Yoko Ono during their bed in. Wax figures of the Lennon's Montreal bed-in at Mus√©e Gr√©vin Montreal Linkin Park members Chester Bennington and Mr. Hahn imitated the incident in a photograph taken by Greg Watermann in their book From the Inside: Linkin Park's Meteora. In late 2006, Billie Joe Armstrong, lead singer of Californian rock band Green Day, and his wife, Adrienne Armstrong, did a similar bed-in, featuring Billie Joe and Adrienne lying on the bed, with a poster above their heads saying \\"Make Love Not War\\" in Spanish. On Lewis Black's Root of All Evil, comedian Andy Daly exhibits a video clip showing that he has also attempted a bed in to protest the War in Iraq. Trying to mimic Lennon and Ono's original bed in, he climbs into the bed of an Asian woman, who pepper-sprays Daly. Japanese pop duo Puffy AmiYumi made a homage to the bed-in on the cover of their 2003 album Nice. American singer Jhen√© Aiko imitated the image with Childish Gambino of John Lennon and Yoko Ono in their bed for her single \\"Bed Peace\\" off her 2013 EP Sail Out.

It was used for quarantine of immigrants. Swinburne Island is the smaller of two islands near South Beach, the other being Hoffman Island. History After several cholera pandemics in the nineteenth century, the federal government built Swinburne Island and Hoffman Island to serve as areas of quarantine for immigrants arriving by ship and carrying contagious diseases. Along with Hoffman Island, which was constructed in 1873, Swinburne was used through the early 20th century to quarantine immigrants to the United States who were found to be suffering dangerous contagious diseases upon arrival at the Port of New York. Immigrants suspected of having such diseases were taken to the quarantine hospital and were not allowed to go to Ellis Island for entry until they were shown to be well or were cured of the disease. The island was used to quarantine patients during the last cholera outbreak in the United States in 1910‚Äì1911, which started with a passenger from Naples on the Moltke, a ship of the Hamburg-American line. Swinburne was the second built, about a mile south of the earlier island, and it has a crematorium. The island was originally called Dix Island, but was renamed in honor of Dr. John Swinburne (1820‚Äì1899), a military surgeon during the American Civil War.Swinburne was born on May 30, 1820 and he died on April 4, 1889 During World War I, immigration was reduced. Later, the United States passed the Immigration Act of 1923, which sharply lessened immigration from southern and eastern Europe. By this time, the city and state had learned other means of controlling infectious diseases, so the quarantine facilities were little used. By the start of World War II, the United States Merchant Marine had adapted both islands as a training station, which had opened in 1938.Kenneth T. Jackson: The Encyclopedia of New York City: The New York Historical Society; Yale University Press; 1995. P. 149. It built additional quonset huts, which still stand. Current use Both islands (Hoffman, 11 acres, and Swinburne, 4 acres) are now managed by the National Park Service as part of the Staten Island Unit of the Gateway National Recreation Area. Within the past decade, Swinburne Island has become a popular haul out site for Lower New York Harbors population of Harbor and Grey seals.

Biography and early years Walter J. Freeman was born on November 14, 1895, and raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, by his parents. Freeman's grandfather, William Williams Keen, was well known as a surgeon in the Civil War. His father was also a very successful doctor. Freeman attended Yale University beginning in 1912, and graduated in 1916. He then moved on to study neurology at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School. While attending medical school, he studied the work of William Spiller and idolized his groundbreaking work in the new field of the neurological sciences. Spiller also worked in Philadelphia and was credited by many in the world of psychology as being the founder of neurology. Freeman applied for a coveted position working alongside Spiller in his home town of Philadelphia, but was rejected. Shortly afterward, in 1924, Freeman relocated to Washington, D.C., and started practicing as the first neurologist in the city. Upon his arrival in Washington, Freeman began work directing laboratories at St. Elizabeth's Hospital. Working at the hospital and witnessing the pain and distress suffered by the patients encouraged him to continue his education in the field. Freeman earned his PhD in neuropathology within the following few years and secured a position at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., as head of the neurology department. In 1932, his mother died at the Philadelphia Orthopedic Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. =Lobotomy= The first systematic attempt at human psychosurgery ‚Äì performed in the 1880s‚Äì1890s ‚Äì is commonly attributed to the Swiss psychiatrist Gottlieb Burckhardt.For example: However, Kotowicz notes a difference, irregularly observed, among medical historians and medical practitioners in their location of the origin of psychosurgery. The latter group, he contends, tend to favour beginning the narrative with Burckhardt whilst the former group favour starting with Moniz. * In the context of early psychosurgery, Berrios unusually also refers to the operations performed in 1889 by a surgeon (Harrison Cripps) at the behest of the British psychiatrist Thomas Claye Shaw in which fluid was drawn from the brain of a patient diagnosed with General Paralysis of the Insane. While the purpose of the operation was aimed towards the alleviation of mental symptoms attendant on the condition the procedure did not aim to interfere directly with brain tissue and therefore it has been excluded from most conventional accounts of psychosurgery. * Burckhardt's experimental surgical forays were largely condemned at the time and in the subsequent decades psychosurgery was attempted only intermittently. On November 12, 1935, a new psychosurgery procedure was performed in Portugal under the direction of the neurologist and physician Egas Moniz. His new \\"leucotomy\\" procedure, intended to treat mental illness, took small corings of the patient's frontal lobes. Moniz became a mentor and idol for Freeman who modified the procedure and renamed it the \\"lobotomy\\". Instead of taking corings from the frontal lobes, Freeman's procedure severed the connection between the frontal lobes and the thalamus. Because Freeman lost his license to perform surgery himself after his last patient died on the operating table, he enlisted neurosurgeon James Watts as a research partner. One year after the first leucotomy, on September 14, 1936, Freeman directed Watts through the very first prefrontal lobotomy in the United States on housewife Alice Hood Hammatt of Topeka, Kansas. By November, only two months after performing their first lobotomy surgery, Freeman and Watts had already worked on 20 cases including several follow-up operations. By 1942, the duo had performed over 200 lobotomy procedures and had published results claiming 63% of patients had improved, 24% were reported to be unchanged and 14% were worse after surgery. After almost ten years of performing lobotomies, Freeman heard of a doctor in Italy named Amarro Fiamberti who operated on the brain through his patients' eye sockets, allowing him to access the brain without drilling through the skull. After experimenting with novel ways of performing these brain surgeries, Freeman formulated a new procedure called the transorbital lobotomy. This new procedure became known as the \\"icepick\\" lobotomy and was performed by inserting a metal pick into the corner of each eye-socket, hammering it through the thin bone there with a mallet, and moving it back and forth, severing the connections to the prefrontal cortex in the frontal lobes of the brain. He performed the transorbital lobotomy surgery for the first time in Washington, D.C., on a housewife named Sallie Ellen Ionesco. This transorbital lobotomy method did not require a neurosurgeon and could be performed outside of an operating room without the use of anesthesia by using electroconvulsive therapy to induce seizure. The modifications to his lobotomy allowed Freeman to broaden the use of the surgery, which could be performed in psychiatric hospitals throughout the United States that were overpopulated and understaffed. In 1950, Walter Freeman's long-time partner James Watts left their practice and split from Freeman due to his opposition to the cruelty and overuse of the transorbital lobotomy. Following his development of the transorbital lobotomy, Freeman traveled across the country visiting mental institutions, performing lobotomies and spreading his views and methods to institution staff. (Contrary to myth, there is no evidence that he referred to the van that he traveled in as a \\"lobotomobile\\".) Freeman's name gained popularity despite the widespread criticism of his methods following a lobotomy on President John F. Kennedy's sister Rosemary Kennedy, which left her with severe mental and physical disability. A memoir written by former patient Howard Dully, called My Lobotomy documented his experiences with Freeman and his long recovery after undergoing a lobotomy surgery at 12 years of age. Walter Freeman charged just $25 for each procedure that he performed. After four decades Freeman had personally performed possibly as many as 4,000 lobotomy surgeries in 23 states, of which 2,500 used his ice-pick procedure, despite the fact that he had no formal surgical training. In February 1967, Freeman performed his final surgery on Helen Mortensen. Mortensen was a long- term patient and was receiving her third lobotomy from Freeman. She died of a cerebral hemorrhage, as did as many as 100 of his other patients, and he was finally banned from performing surgery. His patients often had to be retaught how to eat and use the bathroom. Relapses were common, some never recovered, and about 15% Alt URL died from the procedure. In 1951, one patient at Iowa's Cherokee Mental Health Institute died when Freeman suddenly stopped for a photo during the procedure, and the surgical instrument accidentally penetrated too far into the patient's brain. Freeman wore neither gloves nor mask during these procedures. He lobotomized nineteen minors, including a four-year-old child. At fifty-seven years old, Freeman retired from his position at George Washington University and opened up a modest practice in California. An extensive collection of Freeman's papers were donated to The George Washington University in 1980. The collection largely deals with the work that Freeman and James W. Watts did on psychosurgery over the course of their medical careers. The collection is currently under the care of GWU's Special Collections Research Center, located in the Estelle and Melvin Gelman Library.Guide to the Walter Freeman and James Watts Papers, 1918-1988, Special Collections Research Center, Estelle and Melvin Gelman Library, The George Washington University Freeman was known for his eccentricities and he complemented his theatrical approach to demonstrating surgery by sporting a cane, goatee, and a narrow-brimmed hat. Death Freeman died, of complications arising from an operation for cancer, on May 31, 1972. He was survived by four children ‚Äî Walter, Frank, Paul and Lorne ‚Äî who became defenders of their father's legacy. Paul became a psychiatrist in San Francisco and the eldest, Walter Jr., became a professor emeritus of neurobiology at University of California, Berkeley. Contributions to psychiatry Walter Freeman nominated his mentor Ant√≥nio Egas Moniz for a Nobel prize, and in 1949 Moniz won the Nobel prize in physiology and medicine. He pioneered and helped open up the psychiatric world to the idea of what would become psychosurgery. At the time, it was seen as a possible treatment for severe mental illness, but \\"within a few years, lobotomy was labeled one of the most barbaric mistakes of modern medicine.\\" He also helped to demonstrate the idea that mental events have a physiological basis. Despite his interest in the mind, Freeman was \\"uninterested in animal experiments or understanding what was happening in the brain\\". Freeman was also co-founder and president of the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology from 1946 to 1947 and a contributor and member of the American Psychiatric Association.

Its text was revised in 1962. This is the last manuscript Mildred Wirt Benson wrote in her initial run. She would return for volume 11, The Clue of the Broken Locket, and remain with the series until 1948, then return for a final ghostwrite in 1953. Plot summary - 1932 edition Nancy and her friends Bess and George, on their way home from a carnival, discuss a financially struggling Swedish immigrant, Mrs. Swenson, and her daughter, whom the girls have just helped to enjoy the carnival attractions by being their hosts for the evening. As they are driving, a luxurious roadside estate bursts into flames. The girls park the car and make sure that no one is trapped inside. In doing so, Nancy sees someone fleeing the property, and discovers an anonymous Swedish diary on the ground. She picks up this clue, and as firefighters and gawkers arrive on the scene, she notices an attractive young man moving her car away from the flying embers. At first suspicious of Ned Nickerson, Nancy warms to him when he helps her out of a jam. Ned proves to be a good friend, and is a perennial admirer of Nancy's from then on. Meanwhile, Mrs. Swenson's husband is missing, and she identifies his diary as the one picked up at the fire. To top it all off, the owner of the burned house, Felix Raybolt, is missing, and his wife claims Joe Swenson has murdered her husband. Raybolt, it turns out, swindles inventors like Swenson out of their patents and copyrights, and used one such invention to start the fire. 1962 revision This version tells essentially the same story, eliminating some detail and subplots, downplaying Nancy's initial response to Ned, eliminating a country club dance not essential to the plot, and adding a new subplot involving mail fraud. Adult series collectors have criticized the addition of a mail fraud subplot, taking place over only two chapters; its appearance does not advance the story and seems to serve as filler material for sections of descriptive but non-essential action deleted in the new edit. At the time of the 1962 revision, this plot device existed (and still exists) both here and in Nancy's Mysterious Letter, which is the next volume following, and serves as one of two equally important mystery plots in the story, and in The Hidden Window Mystery. Nancy struggles to decipher the diary and find the two missing men, aided by her best friends, and a new friend, the attentive Ned Nickerson. Artwork The original edition featured an image of an immaculately dressed Nancy retrieving the title object, and four illustrations by Russell H. Tandy; he updated his own frontispiece to a pen and ink drawing for the 1943 imprint. The cover art for this volume has not changed since 1950, when the revision art was introduced by Bill Gillies, showing a very animated Nancy running after a suspect with the diary falling from her hand, a building burning behind her.

Colegio San Ignacio de Loyola, Quick Facts. It has educated some of the most influential figures in Puerto Rico such as Fernando Pic√≥, Ruben Berrios and Ra√∫l Juli√°. Location The school was originally located in Santurce but the Jesuits moved it to its current location in San Juan, Rio Piedras in 1955. Colegio San Ignacio resembles a small university campus as it has several buildings: two identical buildings consisting of classrooms, named San Luis Gonzaga (formerly \\"Building A\\") and San Francisco Javier (formerly \\"Building B\\"); one building with a computer center on the first floor and a humanities library on the second floor; the Padre Pedro Arrupe Building which houses classrooms and offices; the cafeteria building; \\"Building C\\" which houses the science classrooms and laboratories and a science and math resource center; the Complejo Cultural, a state-of-the-art humanities building completed in the year 2004 which houses English, Spanish, music, drama, and oratory classrooms and an auditorium; the administration building which houses most of the administrative staff. San Ignacio is near its sister school, Academia Mar√≠a Reina, an all-female school. Academics Colegio San Ignacio de Loyola seeks to offer a superior, Catholic education in the Jesuit tradition to all young men who show aptitude, motivation, and their families' support, and so to serve society and announce the Kingdom of God. The school has programs in waste reduction, agroecology, water conservation, and reduction of plastic bottling and consistently receives Eco-School certification from The Organization for Sustainable Environment. San Ignacio participates in the Jesuit Virtual Learning program. It also has a special program for gifted students, with administrative and teaching staff trained at the University of Connecticut. Nine advanced placement courses are offered.  Pastoral program  All students participate in a retreat experience each year, culminating in a 4-day Kairos retreat offered to those in 12th grade. The school celebrates the Eucharist each morning before classes; students may attend if they wish. A Family Formation Program offers talks, workshops, and Ignatian spirituality experiences to assist parents in raising adolescents in today's world. Service opportunities include tutoring at public schools, assisting at a center for special education, a home for abused children, and a home for the elderly, and work on environmentalism. For service opportunities, some join the Friends of Jesus and Peer Ministers groups. School anthem Translated from Spanish: Lion of my shield, martial and rampant, raise your eyes and light the path that gives life. With your warrior chest advance each step, forward to triumph. Already you strained your body, hard as granite. On steady foot raised from the ground, rhythmically beating, you advance with a roaring scream, the march of war. Undaunted in battle who can frighten you? You will see at your advance on all sides the fierce enemy will fall before the radiance of your regal banner.  Athletics and activities  San Ignacio participates in the Puerto Rico High School Athletic Alliance in football, basketball, baseball, bowling, cross country, golf, indoor soccer, swimming, track and field, tennis, and volleyball. Students organizations include Student Council, Chorus, National Honor Society, Peer Ministers, and Cultural Tours. Clubs are sponsored in areas such as school band, debate, United Nations, chess, art, science, medicine, theater, cinema, mathematics, technology, ECO-Ignatian, business, investors, robotics, photography, French, history, and engineering.

It is an advocacy group promoting the interests of lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and intersex (LGBTI) people, at the European level. Its membership comprises more than 500 organisations from throughout Europe and Central Asia. The Association enjoys consultative status at Economic and Social Council of the United Nations (ECOSOC) and participatory status at the Council of Europe.Base de don√©es ONG : European Region of the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA-Europe) Council of Europe, accessed 2 November 2013. History ILGA-Europe was founded in 1996, when its parent organisation, the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, established separate regions. It took over responsibility for supporting the development of the LGBT movement in Europe including Transgender Europe, Inter-LGBT, and for relationships with the European Union, Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe. Initially ILGA- Europe worked entirely on the basis of volunteer resources. However, in 2001, its potential contribution to the European Union's anti-discrimination policies (established under Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam) was recognised through the provision of core funding, currently through the PROGRESS Programme. This enabled ILGA-Europe to set up an office in Brussels, to recruit permanent staff, and to conduct an extensive programme of work in relation to sexual orientation discrimination within the EU Member States and the accession countries. Financial support from the Sigrid Rausing Trust, the Open Society Institute, Freedom House, the US State Department and the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science of the Netherlands allows ILGA- Europe to extend its work in areas not covered by EU funding, including Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and on transgender issues. ILGA-Europe has hosted its annual conference at the end of October, since 2000, where member organisations elect the Executive Board and decide on the next year's working priorities. * 2000 ‚Äì Bucharest, Romania, theme Accepting Diversity * 2001 ‚Äì Rotterdam, Netherlands, theme Creating Partnership * 2002 ‚Äì Lisbon, Portugal, theme Recognising Diversity, Promoting Equality * 2003 ‚Äì Glasgow, United Kingdom, theme Policy into Practice ‚Äì making LGBT equality happen * 2004 ‚Äì Budapest, Hungary, theme Coming out to the EU * 2005 ‚Äì Paris, France * 2006 ‚Äì Sofia, Bulgaria, theme We are Family ‚Äì Our families in Europe and the European family * 2007 ‚Äì Vilnius, Lithuania, theme LGBT Rights are Human Rights ‚Äì Respect, Recognition and Responsibilities * 2008 ‚Äì Vienna, Austria, theme Think globally, act locally * 2009 ‚Äì Malta, theme Overcoming Religious & Cultural Barriers to LGBT Equality * 2010 ‚Äì The Hague, Netherlands, theme Expressing our differences, challenging our prejudices, developing our alliances * 2011 ‚Äì Turin, Italy, theme Human Rights and \\"Traditional Values\\": clash or dialogue? * 2012 ‚Äì Dublin, Ireland, theme Advancing LGBTI equality in challenging economic times * 2013 ‚Äì Zagreb, Croatia, theme Family matters!

The Association provides funding and training for its 500 member organisations, \\"to maximise efficiency and the use of resources by LGBTI organisations in working towards achievement of their goals; to maximise the impact of advocacy work at the European level; to ensure sustainability of the LGBTI movement in Europe.\\" ILGA-Europe works with EU Institutions, the Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe to promote equality by lobbying and advocacy, including supporting the adoption of the proposed EU Anti-Discrimination Directive, that would ban discrimination on the grounds of age, disability, religion or belief and sexual orientation in all areas of EU competence. It also uses strategic litigation at the European Court of Human Rights and the European Court of Justice to end discrimination, by identifying gaps in protections, encouraging organisations and individuals to develop court cases, and support such cases with legal resources and amicus curiae briefs. For the 2014 European Parliament election, ILGA-Europe promoted its Come Out 2014 European Election Pledge to candidate MEPs, which focused on priority LGBTI issues for the 2014‚Äì2019 Parliament: an EU roadmap on LGBTI equality; EU human rights enforcement; completing the EU Anti-Discrimination directive; combating homophobic and transphobic violence; an inclusive definition of 'family'; trans rights and depatholigisation; action against school bullying; health discrimination and inequalities; LGBTI asylum seekers; and making the EU champion LGBTI rights worldwide. 187 elected MEPs (25 percent) signed the pledge, including 83 members of the PES, 14 ALDE members and 14 from the EPP. Today ILGA-Europe has more than 20 staff who work in four areas: Advocacy, Communications, Finance and Administration, and Programmes. All are based at the organisation's office in the European Quarter in Brussels. Rainbow Europe Each May, ILGA-Europe releases its Rainbow Europe review, to mark the International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia. It reviews the human rights situation and assesses what life is like for LGBTI people in every European country, covering discrimination, family recognition, hate speech/crimes, gender recognition, freedom of assembly, association and express, and asylum laws. In 2016, Malta came top of the rankings; it was rated to have 88% progress toward respect of human rights and full equality, just ahead of Belgium and the United Kingdom. Azerbaijan was ranked as the worst for LGBTI equality, scoring just 5%, closely followed by Russia, Armenia and Turkey. The biggest increase since the 2015 review, was that of Greece by 19 points (picking 58%).

Danzan- ry≈´ jujutsu is of mainly Japanese origin but is most common in the West coast of the United States. The Danzan-ry≈´ syllabus is syncretic, and includes non- Japanese elements. History Seishiro Okazaki was born in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan in 1890. In 1906, he immigrated to the island of Hawaii. Soon after, he was afflicted with a pulmonary condition which may have been tuberculosis. It was during this time, however, that young Okazaki began studying under Y≈çshin-ry≈´ jujutsu sensei by the name of Yoshimatsu Tanaka in Hilo, Hawaii. Okazaki intensely pursued his studies under Tanaka and he found after sometime that his respiratory condition had gone into remission. Okazaki felt that the study of martial arts had played a large role in his physical recovery and as a result he decided to dedicate his life to the study and teaching of jujitsu and related disciplines. Later in his life he would adopt the Western first name, Henry. In 1924, Okazaki returned to Japan and underwent a study of the various schools, or ry≈´-ha, of the then most popular J≈´jutsu styles of Y≈çshin-ry≈´, Namba-Shoshin Ry≈´, Iwaga Ry≈´, Kosogabe Ry≈´, K≈çd≈çkan J≈´d≈ç, and several others. Later that year when he returned to the Hawaiian Islands, he continued the study of j≈´jutsu under the various masters who had emigrated from Japan to Hawaii. Incorporating not only traditional j≈´jutsu, but also Lua, Sh≈çrin-ry≈´ Karate, Eskrima, Boxing, Chin Na and Folk Wrestling, he began to synthesize the most effective aspects of these various styles into an eclectic system which he called Danzan Ry≈´. Okazaki used this name to honor his Chinese martial arts teacher, Wo Chong. The Chinese name for Hawai'i is T'an Shan (Ê™ÄÂ±±). When used in Japanese, these kanji are pronounced Dan Zan. Their literal meaning is \\"sandalwood mountain\\". =First classes= Okazaki's school was founded in Hawaii. The name Kodenkan (Âè§‰ºùÈ§®) may be translated as 'The School of the Ancient Tradition'. Okazaki's method of instruction prescribed that senior students to teach their junior students in the spirit of mutual assistance. Okazaki declared that this method of instruction was the foundational philosophy of the AJJF; Okazaki called this philosophy kokua, which in Hawaiian is defined as to mutually help one another. Okazaki was willing to teach both people of non-Asian extraction and women the arts. This was frowned upon by parts of the Asian community in Hawaii at that time. By all accounts the original classes were grueling, and as below, Okazaki taught different courses to different individuals. (Esmailzadeh 1) Around the time of the founding of Kodenkan it took approximately four years to earn a Shodan ranking. During this time students trained 6‚Äì7 days a week. =Seifukujutsu= \\"Upon completing about a year of study,\\" Okazaki wrote in his Esoteric Principles (contained in the Mokuroku scroll given to his pupils who mastered his system), \\"I acquired a body of iron\\" (paraphrased), so he dedicated his life to the study of martial arts and the healing techniques associated with each style he took up. Some among his students carried on his healing traditions. In 1984 third and fourth generation devotees standardized his style of massage from notes by Okazaki's students into the AJJF certification program in Okazaki Restorative Massage (recognized by the AOBTA as ORM, but also known as Okazaki Long Life, Nikko Restorative Massage). = World War II and later = Shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, on December 7, 1941, Okazaki was allegedly interned for six months. This is alleged, but not substantiated through FOIA requests to the U.S. Government. It is possible that he was only held under arrest and not placed in an internment camp. He was released relatively quickly because of the intervention of Curley Freedman who used his FBI contacts to aid in Okazaki's release. Curley was the first tile contractor in Honolulu, and installed tile in the homes and businesses of many Japanese. Because of his craftsmanship, he was well liked and widely known. The FBI asked his assistance in identifying Japanese Fishing Sanpans that may have been contacting Japanese Subs and relaying US Naval Pearl Harbor activity. The FBI would also ask Bud Estes, who worked for Curley in the tile business, to assist in identifying drug dealers on another island during the harvest period. As Bud had knowledge of the island from his Salvation Army missionary days, he agreed and assisted the FBI until his cover was revealed. Okazaki was also fortunate in that his dojo was unmolested, as his students protected it from looters who ransacked Japanese homes and businesses. Because of the preservation of his assets, he was able to lend aid to the Asian community who had formerly shunned him. In this way he became accepted by them. During wartime, Okazaki continued teaching and also assisted the US military in creating a hand-to-hand combat curriculum based largely on the 120 Commando Technique list. Ironically, at the same time, Gichin Funakoshi, the father of modern Karate, was responsible for hand-to-hand training of many members of the Japanese military (Funakoshi 88). Okazaki is sometimes said to have been responsible for the WWII US Army Field Combatives Manual FM 21-150, but that manual gives credit to those from the American Judo Club of New York City. Illness and death Okazaki suffered a stroke in July 1948, from which he recovered somewhat in 1949, when he continued teaching. Okazaki died on July 12, 1951 at the age of sixty-two.  Today  There are many other Danzan Ry≈´ and DZR-influenced organizations which have developed over time and are now separated into various schools of thought. The most widely known international federations today are the American Jujitsu Institute, Jujitsu America, the American Judo and Jujitsu Federation, and Small Circle Jujitsu. =The American Jujitsu Institute= The original Danzan Ry≈´ organization was the American Jujitsu Institute (AJI) founded by Okazaki in 1939. The AJI is the oldest martial arts organization in the United States. The AJI has continued to the present day, and is currently under the direction of its President, Professor Daniel W. Saragosa and Vice President Sensei Scott Horiuchi. Its patronage and sponsorship of the major Danzan Ryu projects over the past two decades have proved crucial to their success.http://www.americanjujitsuinstitute.org/pages/organization/board_of_directors =The American Judo and Jujitsu Federation= The American Judo and Jujitsu Federation (AJJF) was founded in 1948 by Bud Estes, Richard Rickerts, John Cahill and Ray Law. In 1958, the AJJF was incorporated in the State of California as a non-profit organization. (Active Cal. Corp. C0353438, 4/21/1958; Cal. Sec. State, Business Search 5/19/2008) The AJJF now has dojos all over the country and looks after the interests of over a thousand members. They have also created a standardized curriculum. It is a nonprofit, tax- exempt corporation represented by Jujitsu, Judo and other martial arts schools across the nation, and the world. Most individual registrants of the AJJF are associated with AJJF schools, although this is not a requirement. Registration in the AJJF is non-discriminatory. The AJJF promotes the Danzan Ryu system of Jujitsu, an effective system of self-defense that incorporates physical and mental training within a philosophy of ethical and moral development. As a registrant of the American Judo and Jujitsu Federation, you become part of a national organization that provides the many benefits described below. =Small Circle Jujitsu= Wally Jay had studied boxing, weightlifting, judo and jujitsu from various instructors before 1944, when he received his black belt in Kodenkan Danzan Ryu Jujitsu from Okazaki. Small Circle Jujitsu‚Ñ¢ evolved from combining many sources and elements, but owes its roots to Ken Kawachi, the Hawaiian judo champion for many years. Sensei Kawachi was a physically small man who stressed the use of the wrist action to gain superior leverage. So effective was he in using the subtleties of the grip and its leverage that he routinely dominated other judoka literally twice his mass and defeated many visiting wrestlers and other grapplers from the mainland. It was that same wrist action that became the key to Small Circle Jujitsu and continues to evolve as Jay and others enhance the style with their knowledge. In August 2002, Wally Jay held the ceremony officially handing the title of Grandmaster over to his son Leon Jay in his hometown of Alameda, California. =Kaito Gakko= Kaito Gakko was formed under David Kawaikoolihilihi Nu'uhiwa, who studied with Okazaki starting in 1938, and John Cahill, (Danzan- Ryu's sensei, during Okazaki's internment.) After a fighting career with more than 100 consecutive undefeated matches, Professor Nuuhiwa blended his real world fighting experiences, including death matches in Africa and Asia, with his training in Danzan-Ryu Jujitsu, Karate, Aikido, Makaho, and Lua, and started teaching self-defense classes under the name 'Kaito Gakko', a title he was given in Japan in 1958, upon receiving a 12th Dan in karate. Kaito literally means ‚ÄúThe Best of the East and West.‚Äù He was awarded the legendary Red Belt in Japan. At the time, he was one of only five in the world to hold this rank and the first American ever to hold this honor.https://www.kaitogakko.org/aboutus/ David was also an expert in the ancient Hawaiian fighting art of Lua and a healing arts practitioner. Many professional athletes, including Sugar Ray Leonard, came to Nu'uhiwa for pre- fight training, or physical therapy. David Nu'uhiwa Sr. died on January 21, 2005 in Honolulu, Hawai‚Äôi after a courageous battle with cancer. Today, his Kaito Gakko school, aloha and teachings are carried on by Professor Nu'uhiwa's students: Kalani Akui (President of Kaito Gakko), Alyxzander Bear (Vice President of Kaito Gakko), Bruce Keaulani of 'Kaito Gakko Nu'uhiwa Ryu' in Oahu, Hawaii, and Carlos Gallegos of 'Kaito Gakko Martial Arts' in Orange County, California. =Kodenkan Yudanshakai= The Kodenkan Yudanshakai, founded in 1967 by Joseph Holck, is a traditional martial arts association with locations in major metropolitan areas of Arizona. The Kodenkan Yudanshakai was founded by Joseph Holck and his family in 1967 to continue the school founded by Joseph's Brother Roy Holck in 1962. The Yudanshakai teaches such martial arts as Danzan Ry≈´ J≈´jutsu, Shorin-ry≈´ Karate, Matsuno Ryu Goshinjitsu, Nihon Jujitsu, Kodenkan Bokkendo, Hiraido Jujitsu, Northern Praying Mantis Kung Fu, Judo, and other arts. The Kodenkan Yudanshakai has grown over the years and presently has dojos in Arizona, Hawaii, California and Montana, including six in the Tucson-Phoenix metro area. The organization continues its perpetuation of the martial arts under the guidance of Joseph Holck and his family; Vinson Holck, Barry Holck, Meleana Holck-Tomooka, Amy Holck, Aaron Holck, Emmet Holck, Joyce Holck, Wilbert Holck, and Willard Holck. =Shoshin Ryu Yudanshakai= Shoshin Ryu Yudanshakai was founded by Michael Chubb to provide an educational, athletic, and recreational outlet to aid the physical, moral, and social development of adults and children within the framework of the sport and martial art of Danzan Ryu Jujitsu. It was incorporated in 1987 in the State of California and has been instrumental in the creation and maintenance of several inter-organizational projects, including the Ohana weekends, the Danzan Ryu Hall of Fame and the H.S. Okazaki National Jujitsu Championships. =Jujitsu America= In 1978 Wally Jay, John Chow-Hoon, Carl Beaver and Willy Cahill created Jujitsu America. They seceded from the Hawaiian-based American Jujitsu Institute (which was the Kodenkan organization) after a conflict of ideologies and methodologies. This group represented the mainland jujitsuka who decided to break away from the old organization. The Hawaiian leaders wished to perpetuate the traditions of the Kodenkan system while the statesiders wanted to update and improve their fighting skills to reflect certain modern realities. The objects and purposes of Jujitsu America shall be to promote and foster the development and cultivation of a better understanding of the art and science of Jujitsu among its members; and to promote and propagate the teachings and philosophies of the recognized and established systems of Jujitsu in America and affiliate International Unions of Jujitsu. It is further the intent and purpose of Jujitsu America to encourage a systematic practice of modern Kodenkan Jujitsu and related arts, in honor of the founder of Kodenkan Jujitsu, Henry Okazaki. Jujitsu America has recently affiliated with the United States Judo Association (USJA) to promote their Sport Jujitsu programme. =KDRJA= The Kodenkan Danzan-Ry≈´ Jujitsu Association (KDRJA) was proposed by Professor Kiehl in 1978. That same year, Professors Kiehl, Ancho and Kufferath founded the Kodenkan Danzan Ryu Jujitsu Association or KDRJA. The Founders established a Board of three (3) Elders to direct the organization. The original elders were Profs. Ancho, Kufferath and Janovich. It is now known as the Board of Professors, Profs Doug and Jane Kiehl and Prof. Tony Janovich. Other individuals awarded the title of ‚ÄúProfessor‚Äù by the KDRJA serve to advise the Board of Professors. The Founders‚Äô objective was to create an organization whose collective consciousness reflected the spirit and teachings of Danzan Ryu. Its mission is: 1. To provide students with guidelines and a road map for understanding and practicing the ancient arts and sciences of Kodenkan Danzan Ryu Jujitsu as taught by H. Seishiro Okazaki. 2. To carry-on the teaching and perspective of the late Kufferath and Ancho. 3. Support the activities of the Danzan Alliance. =Kodenkan Hombu= Kodenkan Hombu (Costa Rica)www.kodenkancr.com, of Ramon Lono Ancho Jr (deceased). and Bill Beach's Hawaiian Jiu-Jitsu System, Inc., as well as The Southern California Jujitsu Association founded in 1979 by James A. Marcinkus (deceased). =Dojo Danzan Ryu Kodenkan Costa Rica= Sensei Luis Soto 5th Dan, Hanshi Ramon Lono direct Student on the arts of Judo, jujitsu and karate Kempo =Christian Jujitsu Association= The Christian Jujitsu Association was founded by Gene Edwards. The Christian Jujitsu Association is a Danzan Ry≈´ organization including the Christian religion. =KaishinKai= KaishinKai translates as 'gathering of open minds'. The goal of KaishinKai Dojo is to train quality instructors that will propagate the teachings of Henry S. Okazaki and the Kodenkan Danzan-ryu system of Jujitsu. KaishinKai was founded by Ron Jennings in 1978 and consists of affiliate dojos and students primarily in the Pacific Northwest. The KaishinKai Dojo itself is also registered with the American Jujitsu Institute, Jujitsu America, and the ShoshinRyu Yudanshakai. =The Bushidokan Federation= The Bushidokan Federation is a union of dojos from around the world practicing the art of Dan Zan Ryu Zenyo Bujitsu. This system was originated by Herb Lague who began his martial arts studies in 1950, studying Boxing, Judo, Savate, Aikido, Lama Pai, and Jujitsu. Dan Zan Ryu Zenyo Bujutsu was formulated from these systems and uses a framework of Danzan Ryu Jujitsu to teach the principles of Zenyo throughout the system. While upholding certain principles common to many dojos, each dojo in the Bushidokan Federation retains its own autonomy and recognizes the sensei of each dojo as the head instructor. Member dojos are currently in Canada, Colombia, Ecuador, Israel, Italy, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, Serbia/Yugoslavia, and the United States (Alaska, California, Florida, Hawaii, Maine, and Nevada). =Quantum Jujitsu= Quantum Jujitsu was founded by Stephen Copping and developed by Jeremy Corbell. =Evolution Jujitsu= Evolution Jujitsu was founded by Alex Aquino Sensei in Pasadena California 1995, as an answer to the rise of the mixed martial arts phenomenon in the US. The focus of the group is simple: Use Danzan Ryu as a vehicle to go back to the combat tested roots of Jujutsu, and constantly evolve, and develop, through experimentation, and competition. =Kodenkan Ohana Alliance= The Kodenkan Ohana Alliance is a group of autonomous Kodenkan Danzan-Ryu Jujitsu and affiliated organizations dedicated to the principles handed down by Henry S. Okazaki and aligning themselves to the Ohana family and actively supporting the Ohana convention event. This group is responsible for planning and implementing the Ohana convention. =Zen Budokai Jujitsu= Zen Budokai Aiki Jujitsu was founded by Raymond \\"Duke\\" Moore who began his training in the 1940s with Ray Law. Moore received advanced black belts in karate, judo, and jujitsu and by the 1960s had formulated his system which was influenced by his direct training with Ray Law (jujitsu), George Yoshida (judo), Kiyose Nakae (jujitsu), Mitz Kimura (judo), Richard Kim (karate and jujitsu), Hidetaka Nishiyama (karate), and Masutatsu Oyama (karate). Today, the system consists of approximately a dozen schools most of which are in California and New England. Zen Budokai focuses on practical jujitsu and self-defense and is taught by 9th dan (and current system leader) Tim Delgman at the San Francisco dojo and 9th dan Jim Moses at Stanford University at the Stanford Jujitsu Club. See either link for more information. Events The most focal event of the post-Okazaki era in Danzan-Ry≈´ is the biannual Ohana Celebration. This event includes members from all of the organizations focused on the teachings of Okazaki. The organizations come together for a weekend of clinics, competition, and camaraderie to share the Kodenkan spirit. Ohana was founded in 1990 by Shoshin Ryu Yudanshakai instructors Mike Chubb, Bill Fischer and Roger Medlen, and is hosted by a different organization each time. It is usually held on Labor Day weekend. Other past events include the two Kodenkan Okugi classes held in Santa Clara, CA. These two events, one in the summer of 1993 and one in the winter of 2003, brought a number of Danzan-Ry≈´ instructors together to learn the system from Sig Kufferath and his senior student Tony Janovich. Kufferath had been a graduate of the same class held in 1948 under the direction of Okazaki. Over the many years, the methods of performing Okazaki's arts had diverged into a number of different styles. This class, whose contents were designed by Janovich under the direction of Kufferath, was designed to show interested instructors how the arts had been done by Okazaki according to Kufferath, and how he had modified several arts. Students were instructed in all of the combat arts as well as the eleven required methods of resuscitation. The students who graduated from these classes were awarded Kaiden no Sho, or complete transmission certificates, and were given the title of either Renshi (trainer), Kyoshi (teacher) or Shihan (master). Before Kufferath's death in 1999, he and Janovich had planned to hold a second class in 2003, ten years after the previous class. This had been the plan of Okazaki after his 1948 class, but his death in 1951 prevented this. Janovich carried out the plan and held this class in January and February 2003. There are tentative plans for the Kodenkan dojo to hold another class in the future. Note 1: Other classes that have been called \\"okugi\\" have taken place, but were not sanctioned by Kufferath. Note 2: Okazaki's 1948 class was called the \\"special Sunday class\\" and not the Okugi class. The name \\"Okugi Class\\" was coined and copyrighted by Tony Janovich.

There are two versions of his life that are known to us, a Syriac one and a Greek one. Syriac version According to Syriac tradition St. Alexius was an Eastern saint whose veneration was later transplanted to Rome. The relocation of the veneration to Rome was facilitated by the belief that the saint was a native of Rome and had died there. This Roman connection stemmed from an earlier Syriac legend which recounted that during the episcopate of Bishop Rabbula (412‚Äì435) a \\"Man of God\\" who lived in Edessa, Mesopotamia, as a beggar, and who shared the alms he received with other poor people, was found to be a native of Rome after his death.  Greek version  The Wedding of Saint Alexius; Garcia Fernandes, 1541. The Greek version of his legend made Alexius the only son of Euphemianus, a wealthy Christian Roman of the senatorial class. Alexius fled his arranged marriage to follow his holy vocation. Disguised as a beggar, he lived near Edessa in Syria, accepting alms even from his own household slaves, who had been sent to look for him but did not recognize him, until a miraculous icon of the Blessed Virgin Mary (later this image was called Madonna of St.Alexius) singled him out as a \\"Man of God.\\" () Fleeing the resultant notoriety, he returned to Rome, so changed that his parents did not recognize him, but as good Christians took him in and sheltered him for seventeen years, which he spent in a dark cubbyhole beneath the stairs, praying and teaching catechism to children. After his death, his family found a note on his body which told them who he was and how he had lived his life of penance from the day of his wedding, for the love of God. Veneration Alexius seems to have been completely unknown in the West prior to the end of the tenth century. Only from the end of the 10th century did his name begin to appear in any liturgical books there. Since before the 8th century, there was on the Aventine in Rome a church that was dedicated to St Boniface. In 972 Pope Benedict VII transferred this almost abandoned church to the exiled Greek metropolitan, Sergius of Damascus. The latter erected beside the church a monastery for Greek and Latin monks, soon made famous for the austere life of its inmates. To the name of St Boniface was now added that of St Alexius as titular saint of the church and monastery known as Santi Bonifacio e Alessio. It is evidently Sergius and his monks who brought to Rome the veneration of Saint Alexius. The Eastern saint, according to his legend a native of Rome, was soon very popular with the folk of that city.. This church, being associated with the legend, was considered to be built on the site of the home that Alexius returned to from Edessa. St. Alexius is mentioned in the Roman Martyrology under 17 July in the following terms: \\"At Rome, in a church on the Aventine Hill, a man of God is celebrated under the name of Alexius, who, as reported by tradition, abandoned his wealthy home, for the sake of becoming poor and to beg for alms unrecognized.\\"\\"Martyrologium Romanum\\" (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2001) While the Roman Catholic Church continues to recognize St. Alexius as a saint, his feast was removed from the General Roman Calendar in 1969. The reason given was the legendary character of the written life of the saint\\"Calendarium Romanum\\" (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969) page 130 Johann Peter Kirsch remarked: \\"Perhaps the only basis for the story is the fact that a certain pious ascetic at Edessa lived the life of a beggar and was later venerated as a saint.\\" The Tridentine Calendar gave his feast day the rank of \\"Simple\\" but by 1862 it had become a \\"Semidouble\\" and, in Rome itself, a \\"Double\\".Missale Romanum 1862 It was reduced again to the rank of \\"Simple\\" in 1955General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII and in 1960 became a \\"Commemoration\\".General Roman Calendar of 1960 According to the rules in the present-day Roman Missal, the saint may now be celebrated everywhere on his feast day with a \\"Memorial\\", unless in some locality an obligatory celebration is assigned to that day.General Instruction of the Roman Missal , 355 c The Eastern Orthodox Church venerates St Alexius on 17 March.Neon anthologion plerestaton te kai akribestaton...

There are numerous churches bearing his name in Greece and Russia but also the other orthodox countries. Saint Alexius is well known to the region of north Peloponnese because of the honorable skull of the Saint which is kept in the monastery of Agia Lavra. Churches dedicated to St. Alexius are found in Aigio and Patras. Greek icon of Saint Alexius man of God (found in St Andrew's Cathedral, Patras) Relics Relics of Saint Alexius are found in some churches and monasteries in Greece like Esphigmenou monastery, mount Athos and Dormition of Theotokos Monastery, Boeotia. In Russia relics of St. Alexius are kept in the Alexander Nevsky Lavra in Saint Petersburg. In Cyprys relics are kept in the Kykkos Monastery. The most precious relic is a large part of the honorable skull of the Saint which is kept in the monastery of Agia Lavra near in Kalavrita, Greece. According to the Ktetorikon (monastic foundation codex) of the monastery, the honorable skull was donated to the monastery by the Byzantine emperor Manuel II Palaiologos in 1398 (this is also the inscription on the reliquary).Agia Lavra monastery in Kalavrita, texts from the codices of the monastery, Kostas Lappas, 1975 (in Greek) Online access from the website of National Hellenic Research FoundationHagia Lavra Monastery Greek monasteries website monastiria.grMonastery of Holy Lavra, article in OrthodoxWikiŒëŒ∫ŒøŒªŒøœÖŒ∏ŒØŒ± Œ∫Œ±Œπ Œ≤ŒØŒøœÇ œÑŒøœÖ ŒøœÉŒØŒøœÖ Œ∫Œ±Œπ ŒòŒµŒøœÜœåœÅŒøœÖ Œ†Œ±œÑœÅœåœÇ ŒóŒºœéŒΩ ŒëŒªŒµŒæŒØŒøœÖ œÑŒøœÖ Œ±ŒΩŒ∏œÅœéœÄŒøœÖ œÑŒøœÖ ŒòŒµŒøœç : œàŒ±ŒªŒªŒøŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒ∑ œÑŒ∑ ŒôŒñ' ŒúŒ±œÅœÑŒØŒøœÖ, ŒµŒΩ ŒÆ œÑŒµŒªŒµŒØœÑŒ±Œπ Œ∑ ŒºŒΩŒÆŒºŒ∑ Œ±œÖœÑŒøœç (Life and hymns of Saint Alexius man of God , chanted in 17 March ,Printed in Patras, 1875 (online access in the digital library of the university of Crete) References to St. Alexius A 1674 theatre show program for the Saint Alexis the Man of God, presented in Kiev and dedicated to tsar Alexis of Russia * Saint Alexis Parish and School, located in Wexford, Pennsylvania, is named for St Alexius. * Stefano Landi wrote an opera about him (1632). * Camilla de Rossi wrote an oratorio about him (1710). * Rimsky-Korsakov wrote a secular cantata about him. * Alexander Radishchev, in his Journey from St Petersburg to Moscow (1790), refers to the story of St Alexis as sung by a blind soldier begging in Klin, near Moscow. * Mikhail Kuzmin wrote a play (\\"Komediia o Aleksee cheloveke bozhyem\\" - comedy about Alexis, the Man of God) about the life of St. Alexis. * In 1769, San Elijo Lagoon and beach in San Diego County, California were named San Alejo by the Portola Expedition for Saint Alexius.

It was the last serious act of resistance against William in the Norman Conquest.Edward Augustus Freeman (1901). A Short History of the Norman Conquest of England. Page 113-114. Cause The revolt was caused by the king's refusal (in his absence ‚Äì he had been in Normandy since 1073) to sanction the marriage between Emma (daughter of William FitzOsbern, 1st Earl of Hereford and Adelissa de Tosny) and Ralph de Guader, Earl of East Anglia in 1075. They married without his permission. Then, in William's absence, Ralph, Roger de Breteuil, 2nd Earl of Hereford (his new brother-in-law), and Waltheof, 1st Earl of Northumberland began the revolt;Mike Ibeji, Treachery of the Earls, by Mike Ibeji, from \\"BBC History of the Normans\\". but it was plagued by disaster. Waltheof soon lost heart and confessed the conspiracy to Archbishop of Canterbury Lanfranc, who urged Earl Roger to return to his allegiance, and finally excommunicated him and his adherents, and then to William, who was in Normandy. Roger, who was to bring his force from the west to join Ralph, was held in check at the River Severn by the Worcestershire fyrd which the English bishop Wulfstan brought into the field against him. Ralph in the meantime encountered a much superior force under the warrior bishops Odo of Bayeux and Geoffrey de Montbray (the latter ordered that all rebels should have their right foot cut off) near Cambridge and retreated hurriedly to Norwich, hotly pursued by the royal army. Leaving Emma to defend Norwich Castle, Ralph sailed for Denmark in search of help. He eventually returned to England with a fleet of 200 ships under Cnut and Hakon, but they failed to do anything effective. Meanwhile, the Countess held out in Norwich until she obtained terms for herself and her followers, who were deprived of their lands, but were allowed forty days to leave the realm. The Countess retired to her estate in Brittany, where she was rejoined by her husband. Aftermath William deprived Ralph of all his lands including his earldom. Roger was also deprived of his lands and earldom, but unlike Ralph he was sentenced to perpetual imprisonment. He was briefly released along with other political prisoners, but was promptly beheaded after William's death in 1087. On 31 May 1076 Waltheof was beheaded, on St Giles's Hill near Winchester. He was the only Englishman to have been dealt such a punishment during King William's reign. It is said he had been a man of immense bodily strength, but weak-willed and unreliable yet devout and charitable, and so was regarded by the English as a martyr. Miracles were said to have been worked at his tomb at Crowland in Lincolnshire.

It is part of the major Croydon Vision 2020 regeneration scheme. It has been subject to substantial public debate which has featured in the national media. Croydon is the principal office district in South London, having been rebuilt on a large scale in the 1960s, but much of the remaining office stock from that era is now dated. The \\"Croydon Gateway\\" site, a former railway goods yard, represents the largest single development opportunity in the district. Plans =Arrowcroft= An artist's impression of the failed Croydon Arena in the arrowcroft scheme The London Borough of Croydon actively supported an alternative proposal, developed in partnership with property company Arrowcroft, which would involve the construction of a 12,500-seat indoor arena, named the Croydon Arena, as well as 59,234 m¬≤ of offices and 874 homes‚Äîincluding affordable housing. Unlike the Stanhope scheme, this proposal received the full backing from Croydon Council, then went to a public inquiry after being 'called in' by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government. It also required compulsory purchase of the site. The Council made a Compulsory Purchase Order to assemble the land required and the objections to which were considered at the same public inquiry. The public inquiry took place between September and November 2007. The Secretary of State rejected the CPO and Planning Permission in July 2008. = Croydon Arena = Croydon Arena was a proposed arena part of the Croydon Gateway re-generation scheme in the south London district of Croydon. The site is next to East Croydon station and has been in the ownership of the rival development Ruskin Square. The Arena scheme was backed by Croydon Council with developer partner Arrowcroft. The matter was the subject of a public inquiry that took place from September to November 2007. The full decision rejecting the Planning Application and the Compulsory Purchase Order was issued on the 31 July 2008 and the 6 August 2008. =The Stanhope Schroders Scheme= The site owner's plan has been prepared by the developer, Stanhope, and their financial backers, Schroders;Ruskin Square the scheme includes 560 homes with 50% affordable housing, office buildings, a replacement Warehouse Theatre and an urban park. There would be a landmark 29-storeyhttp://www.ruskinsquare.com/masterplan skyscraper which would front on to George Street, next to East Croydon Station. Norman Foster's firm are the principal architects of the scheme.  Site progress  Wettern House demolition Throughout September to November 2005, the last office block located on the site, Wettern House, was slowly demolished under a protective wrapper to protect the rail infrastructure and surrounding buildings. Between February and April 2006, the site was cleared of all occupiers (car parks and car rental, etc.) with the exception of the Warehouse Theatre, with new hoardings now marking the boundaries of the main site. Stanhope Schroders now own large parcels of land to the north of the main site as well as office blocks in Croydon's central business district. July and August 2007 saw the company Mace appointed as site managers by Stanhope. Further clearance works (enabling works) are now underway. Final designs of all buildings are being worked up by Foster + partners prior to foundations being dug this Autumn. During September 2007, a new branding for the development took shape and all hoardings were brought up to standard ready for the commencement of works. Meanwhile, Croydon Council was under significant pressure to agree the final 'technical' planning conditions (such as the lighting scheme, drainage etc.) to enable the Stanhope Scheme to commence its construction phase. On 12 September 2007, Stanhope announced that the scheme would be renamed Ruskin Square. In October 2007, Croydon council continued to sit on the release of the final planning obligations on the Ruskin Square development. It is not known if the delay was connected to the public inquiry / Arrowcroft. On 2 June 2006, Stanhope and Schroders were granted formal planning permission for their proposed Gateway scheme. Ms Ruth Kelly, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government endorsed the report of the local planning inspector and granted permission. The planning inspector Keith Durrant said of the scheme: The new Conservative administration which took over in Croydon in May 2006 endorsed competing Arrowcroft project, which enabled the Compulsory Purchase Order by which the Council planned to acquire the site to enable its development with Arrowcroft to proceed, to be made in January 2007. The CPO was dealt with separately from the issue of compensation, which will assess the compensation value of the site to be paid, potentially in proceedings in the Lands Tribunal if the order is confirmed. The gap in value is currently around ¬£50Million. Arrowcroft assumed a purchase price of ¬£25Million and Stanhope nearer ¬£80Million as a selling price. Nevertheless, assumptions had to be made about the value of the site, and this was based on the value for development since Stanhope have secured permission. Looking at the Croydon property market, this is the largest piece of land in a single ownership in Croydon. Recent sales suggested a land value higher than the Arrowcroft estimate. Construction The site of the planned Ruskin Square development - Building 1, in 2017 * October 2008 ‚Äì January 2009.

Henry I had to defend his holdings in Normandy several times and his victory at this battle repelled a French invasion. The French defeat at Br√©mule effectively crippled the baron's rebellion and led to King Louis having to accept William Adelin as Duke of Normandy. William was officially invested with the duchy in 1120, even though King Louis continued to support William Clito's claim to the honour. This battle is the result of a fortuitous encounter between the two neighbours who were engaged in a lawkeeping operation on their respective borders, the limits of their kingdoms being still imprecise in the Vexin and in the valley of the Seine. Chronicles from the French side describe the battle as a fierce and bloody one where Louis the Fat, despite his heavy weight, fought so close to the opposing knights that a Norman seized his horse's reins and shout, \\"The King is taken!\\", to which the King replied with a heavy blow from his mace, shouting back: \\"The King is not taken, neither at war, nor at chess!\\" However, this was later proven to be a misattribution.Rozan, Charles (1888), Petites ignorances historiques et litt√©raires, pp. 4‚Äì5. On the other side, chronicles from the Norman side tell that their knights gained much profit from the ransoms paid by their many prisoners, and that they had only three casualties on their side.Orderic Vitalis, Historia Ecclesiastica VI 240‚Äì241.

The show was broadcast by the BBC from 1977 to 1988. Overview The plot revolved around the various adventures of a family of furry characters called The Flumps. It was created and written by Julie Holder and narrated by Gay Soper. The theme tune was played by George Chisholm on the trombone. In 1978, the BBC released a record, The Flumps (REC 309), that had 4 stories from the TV series narrated and sung by Gay Soper: \\"Keep Fit\\", \\"Balloons\\", \\"Moon Shot\\" and \\"Something Different\\". In 2000, The Flumps was released on DVD. During early 2008, the theme tune was used in a series of adverts for Auto Trader magazine in the UK. These adverts were run again in Q3 2009.

In chemistry, absorption is a physical or chemical phenomenon or a process in which atoms, molecules or ions enter some bulk phase ‚Äì liquid or solid material. This is a different process from adsorption, since molecules undergoing absorption are taken up by the volume, not by the surface (as in the case for adsorption). A more general term is sorption, which covers absorption, adsorption, and ion exchange. Absorption is a condition in which something takes in another substance. In many processes important in technology, the chemical absorption is used in place of the physical process, e.g., absorption of carbon dioxide by sodium hydroxide ‚Äì such acid-base processes do not follow the Nernst partition law. For some examples of this effect, see liquid-liquid extraction. It is possible to extract a solute from one liquid phase to another without a chemical reaction. Examples of such solutes are noble gases and osmium tetroxide. The process of absorption means that a substance captures and transforms energy. The absorbent distributes the material it captures throughout whole and adsorbent only distributes it through the surface. The process of gas or liquid which penetrate into the body of adsorbent is commonly known as absorption. Absorption Equation If absorption is a physical process not accompanied by any other physical or chemical process, it usually follows the Nernst distribution law: :\\"the ratio of concentrations of some solute species in two bulk phases when it is equilibrium and in contact is constant for a given solute and bulk phases\\": :: \\\\frac{[x]_{1}}{[x]_{2}} = \\\\text{constant} = K_{N(x,12)} The value of constant KN depends on temperature and is called partition coefficient. This equation is valid if concentrations are not too large and if the species \\"x\\" does not change its form in any of the two phases \\"1\\" or \\"2\\". If such molecule undergoes association or dissociation then this equation still describes the equilibrium between \\"x\\" in both phases, but only for the same form ‚Äì concentrations of all remaining forms must be calculated by taking into account all the other equilibria. In the case of gas absorption, one may calculate its concentration by using, e.g., the Ideal gas law, c = p/RT. In alternative fashion, one may use partial pressures instead of concentrations. Types of absorption Absorption is a process that may be chemical (reactive) or physical (non-reactive). = Chemical absorption = Chemical absorption or reactive absorption is a chemical reaction between the absorbed and the absorbing substances. Sometimes it combines with physical absorption. This type of absorption depends upon the stoichiometry of the reaction and the concentration of its reactants. They may be carried out in different units, with a wide spectrum of phase flow types and interactions. In most cases, RA is carried out in plate or packed columns. = Physical absorption =  Water in a solid  Hydrophilic solids, which includes many solids of biological origin, can readily absorb water. Polar interactions between water and the molecules of the solid favour partition of the water into the solid, which can allow significant absorption of water vapour even in relatively low humidity. = Moisture regain = A plant fibre (or other hydrophilic material) that has been exposed to the atmosphere will usually contain some water even if it feels dry. The water can be driven off by heating in an oven, leading to a measurable decrease in weight, which will gradually be regained if the fibre is returned to a 'normal' atmosphere. This effect is crucial in the textile industry ‚Äì where the proportion of a material's weight made up by water is called the moisture regain.

A trademark was to put his hand over part of his face at the punchline. Wilton was born in Everton, Liverpool, and had a dry Lancashire accent which suited his comic persona as a procrastinating and work-shy impediment to the general public. Wilton's comedy emerged from the tradition of English music hall, especially popular in the North of England, and he was a contemporary of Frank Randle and George Formby, Sr.. He portrayed the human face of bureaucracy; for example, playing a policeman who shilly-shallies his way out of acting upon a reported murder by pursuing a contrarian line of questioning. Wilton, rubbing his face in a world-weary way, would fiddle with his props while his characters blithely and incompetently 'went about their work', his humour embodying the everyday and the absurd ‚Äì and the inherent absurdity of the everyday. He has been acknowledged as an influence by fellow Lancashire comedians Ken Dodd and Les Dawson, and the film historian Jeffrey Richards has cited him as a key influence for the TV sitcom Dad's Army (1968‚Äì1977); he made several monologues in the person of a layabout husband, who wryly takes part in the Home Guard. His gentle, if pointed, manner of comedy is similar to the wistful adventures of the more famous Walmington-on-Sea platoon. Wilton's most popular catchphrase was \\"The day war broke out...\\". The phrase was taken from his opening routine for radio which was \\"The day war broke out, my missus said to me, 'It's up to you...You've got to stop it'. I said, 'Stop what?'. She said, 'The war.'\\" \\"Ooh, she's a funny woman!\\" Another frequently reconstructed Wilton monologue was the 'fire station sketch', in which a bumbling fire officer takes a call reporting the location of a fire, but is sidetracked into trying to remember where it is instead of taking the details of the conflagration: \\"Grimshaw Street... No, don't tell me... Oh, I could walk straight to it...\\", finishing with the classic line to the long-suffering householder: \\"Can you keep it going 'til we get there?\\" Possibly his best- known character, Mr Muddlecombe, an incompetent J.P., appeared in a number of radio series during the 1930s and 1940s and was known for the phrase \\"You shouldn't have done that!\\". He would also frequently make the comment: \\"Ee, what a to-do!\\" He was also a stand-up comedian and one of his jokes was: \\"A bloke went into a pub and asked, \\"What soft drinks have you got, barman?\\" Barman says, \\"I've got some without vanilla, some without lime, some without lemon. Ah, and one with peppermint!\\" \\"Oh, damn\\", says the customer, \\"That's the very one I wanted without!\\" In October 1928, he appeared in a short film, The Fire Brigade, made in the Phonofilm sound-on-film process. He then appeared in several films from 1934, generally in supporting comic roles. His last film appearance was in the Arthur Askey vehicle The Love Match in 1955. Wilton was inducted into the exclusive entertainers' fraternity, the Grand Order of Water Rats and served as its \\"King Rat\\" in 1947. He was a grand-uncle of actor Robin Askwith.

This example discusses the general principle using visible light as a specific example. A white light source ‚Äî emitting light of multiple wavelengths ‚Äî is focused on a sample (the pairs of complementary colors are indicated by the yellow dotted lines). Upon striking the sample, photons that match the energy gap of the molecules present (green light in this example) are absorbed, exciting the molecules. Other photons are transmitted unaffected and, if the radiation is in the visible region (400‚Äì700 nm), the transmitted light appears as the complementary color (here red). By recording the attenuation of light for various wavelengths, an absorption spectrum can be obtained. In physics, absorption of electromagnetic radiation is how matter (typically electrons bound in atoms) takes up a photon's energy ‚Äî and so transforms electromagnetic energy into internal energy of the absorber (for example, thermal energy). A notable effect (attenuation) is to gradually reduce the intensity of light waves as they propagate through a medium. Although the absorption of waves does not usually depend on their intensity (linear absorption), in certain conditions (optics) the medium's transparency changes by a factor that varies as a function of wave intensity, and saturable absorption (or nonlinear absorption) occurs. Quantifying absorption Many approaches can potentially quantify radiation absorption, with key examples following. * The absorption coefficient along with some closely related derived quantities * The attenuation coefficient (NB used infrequently with meaning synonymous with \\"absorption coefficient\\") * The molar attenuation coefficient (also called \\"molar absorptivity\\"), which is the absorption coefficient divided by molarity (see also Beer‚ÄìLambert law) * The mass attenuation coefficient (also called \\"mass extinction coefficient\\"), which is the absorption coefficient divided by density * The absorption cross section and scattering cross-section, related closely to the absorption and attenuation coefficients, respectively * \\"Extinction\\" in astronomy, which is equivalent to the attenuation coefficient * Other measures of radiation absorption, including penetration depth and skin effect, propagation constant, attenuation constant, phase constant, and complex wavenumber, complex refractive index and extinction coefficient, complex dielectric constant, electrical resistivity and conductivity. * Related measures, including absorbance (also called \\"optical density\\") and optical depth (also called \\"optical thickness\\") All these quantities measure, at least to some extent, how well a medium absorbs radiation. Which among them practitioners use varies by field and technique, often due simply to the convention. Measuring absorption The absorbance of an object quantifies how much of the incident light is absorbed by it (instead of being reflected or refracted). This may be related to other properties of the object through the Beer‚ÄìLambert law. Precise measurements of the absorbance at many wavelengths allow the identification of a substance via absorption spectroscopy, where a sample is illuminated from one side, and the intensity of the light that exits from the sample in every direction is measured. A few examples of absorption are ultraviolet‚Äìvisible spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Applications Rough plot of Earth's atmospheric transmittance (or opacity) to various wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation, including visible light Understanding and measuring the absorption of electromagnetic radiation has a variety of applications. * In radio propagation, it is represented in non-line-of-sight propagation. For example, see computation of radio wave attenuation in the atmosphere used in satellite link design. * In meteorology and climatology, global and local temperatures depend in part on the absorption of radiation by atmospheric gases (such as in the greenhouse effect) and land and ocean surfaces (see albedo). * In medicine, X-rays are absorbed to different extents by different tissues (bone in particular), which is the basis for X-ray imaging. * In chemistry and materials science, different materials and molecules absorb radiation to different extents at different frequencies, which allows for material identification. * In optics, sunglasses, colored filters, dyes, and other such materials are designed specifically with respect to which visible wavelengths they absorb, and in what proportions. * In biology, photosynthetic organisms require that light of the appropriate wavelengths be absorbed within the active area of chloroplasts, so that the light energy can be converted into chemical energy within sugars and other molecules. * In physics, the D-region of Earth's ionosphere is known to significantly absorb radio signals that fall within the high-frequency electromagnetic spectrum. * In nuclear physics, absorption of nuclear radiations can be used for measuring the fluid levels, densitometry or thickness measurements.

He was a left-arm wrist spin bowler, and a lower-order left-handed batsman. His earlier international career was revitalised by Shane Warne's absence from cricket in 2003 due to suspension from a drugs test and subsequent retirement from one-day cricket. He is Australia's ninth most successful One Day International bowler and second most successful spinner in terms of wickets taken. He was a member of Australia's victorious 2003 and 2007 Cricket World Cup teams. He retired from International cricket on 4 March 2008 after the 2007‚Äì08 Commonwealth Bank Series. In a surprise comeback to the T20 format at the inaugural Big Bash League in 2011, Hogg became a cult hero of the short form, bringing about a call-up to the 2012 and 2014 T20 World Cup Australia sides, as well as international T20 contracts around the world. Hogg is the world's current oldest top level cricket player, and the only player over 40 years of age to take 100 wickets in the T20 format.http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/cricket/brad-hogg-to-be-oldest- world20-player/story-e6frg7rx-1226823624384http://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/australia/brad- hogg-states-case-for-recall-to-australia-side-for-world-twenty20/news- story/36df5f98d24ca76ceb9c8a73b3a9d2a9 Hogg released The Wrong'Un, an autobiography with Greg Growden, in November 2016http://www.booktopia.com.au/the-wrong-un-order-your-signed-copy--brad- hogg/prod9781863958783.html;jsessionid=be5f5aqXZoUHlJR8boEQcL-0.undefined and enjoys a career as a cricket commentator and has become a popular media personality between cricket commitments. Early life and career Hogg grew up on a sheep farm in Williams, Western Australia as an only child, and is a former pupil of Aquinas College, Perth. Later, he completed a Bachelor of Commerce majoring in Accounting & Marketing at Curtin University.Sports Of World - Brad Hogg Profile Hogg made his first-class cricket and domestic limited overs debut for Western Australia in February 1994 as a middle order batsman.NSW vs WA 1993/94 Sheffield Shield He did not begin to bowl left-arm wrist-spin until former Australian test leg-spinner Tony Mann asked him to bowl them in the nets as preparation for the batsmen to face NSW spinner David Freedman. In 1999 he made a brief foray in umpiring Australian rules football, making his way up to Westar Rules Colts (under 18) level. International career In 1996, he was selected in the Australian team to tour India as a replacement for Warne who was injured. He made his Test debut against India in Delhi, taking 1/69 and making 1 and 4. He also played seven One Day International matches. However, the belief at the time was that he was merely a place-holder for Warne and he was discarded from the international squad for some time. Hogg was also in and out of the Western Australian squad for the next few years as he struggled for form. Hogg was absent from the international scene until called up to replace Warne during the 2002-03 VB Series (an annual tri-nations one day tournament in Australia) after Warne injured his shoulder. However, Warne then tested positive to a banned diuretic in a pre-World Cup drugs test, leaving Hogg to play as Australia's specialist spinner in Australia's Cup winning side and filled that role until his own retirement, this was due to Warne's retirement from the one day game. Hogg was recalled to the Australian Test team to tour the West Indies in April 2003, where he played two matches (making his wait between his first and second Tests of seven years and 78 games the longest for an Australian ). He also played against Zimbabwe at the SCG later that year, but was upstaged by part- time left-arm wrist spin bowler Simon Katich, who took 6/90 for the match (Hogg took 3/119). He was left out of the Test team pushy in 2004 but remained in the national one day team as the preferred spinner to Stuart MacGill. In 2005-06, he became a one-day only player with Western Australian selectors preferring to play young spinner Beau Casson ahead of Hogg in the state's Pura Cup side. However, with Casson's move to New South Wales in 2006-07, Hogg has regained his place in the first-class side. In 2007-08, after a four-year layoff, Hogg was recalled to Test cricket to play against India after Stuart MacGill had to withdraw from the team due to suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome in his bowling hand. On 2 January 2008, Hogg scored a Test-career- best 79 as part of a 173-run partnership with Andrew Symonds‚Äîa 7th wicket record for both the Sydney Cricket Ground and Australia vs. India. Hogg's highest ODI score is 71 not out against England, and his best bowling figures in an innings are 5/32 against the West Indies. Hogg is a noted fitness fanatic, scoring the highest beep test result in the Australian team in 2005, with a score of 14.6. On 27 February 2008, Hogg announced his retirement from international cricket, effective after the Commonwealth Bank Series.Hogg quits in spin crisisHogg to quit international scene BBC News retrieved 27 February 2008 His test career (17 wickets at 54.88) was ultimately unremarkable, but his 156 One Day International wickets at 26.84 coupled with useful lower-order batting placed him among Australia's best one-day players. Comeback to cricket On 4 November 2011, Hogg signed with the Perth Scorchers, one of the franchises in the Australian domestic Twenty20 competition, the Big Bash League. He took 12 wickets in the tournament at an average of 13.5, better than any other spinner in the competition bettered in wickets only by James Faulkner and Rana Naved-ul-Hasan. On 23 January 2012, on the back of his form with the Scorchers, Hogg earned a recall to the Australian Twenty20 squad. He was also picked up by Sylhet Royals for the inaugural Bangladesh Premier League, the Nashua Mobile Cape Cobras for the South African T20 League, the Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League players auction, and the Sri Lanka T20 Tournaments. On 1 February 2012, Hogg returned to international cricket at the Sydney Olympic Stadium in a Twenty20 international against India, returning figures of one wicket (that of Virat Kohli) for 21 runs from four overs.Ron Reed: Every day a birthday for re-born Brad Hogg In the second match of the Twenty20 series at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, he took the wicket of Virender Sehwag in his first over,India finally win in Australia and ended up with bowling figures of 1/19. Hogg has since been selected for the 2014 Australian T20 World Cup team, plus the three games against Pakistan in Dubai in the leadup to that competition. On 7 February 2014, Hogg was man of the match in the winning Big Bash final with his team the Perth Scorchers. Over the tournament, Hogg had an economy rate of 6.19, the fifth best by a spinner in the tournament. This earned him a recall to the Australian T20I team for the series in South Africa and the 2014 ICC World Twenty20. On 12 March that year he became the oldest player to play in T20I's, at 43 years and 34 days.http://www.cricwaves.com/cricket/news/articles/HHzE2kI0eG_drh- sevawcirc/top-10-oldest-players-to- play-t20-internationals.htmlhttps://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/cricket/brad- hogg-to-be-oldest-world20-player/news-story/c934ba803def425d618c84f93b9bc36a He was bought by the Kolkata Knight Riders at the 2015 IPL auction as a backup to replace Narine who was sidelined halfway into the season due to 'suspect bowling action'. Hogg triumphed in the role and took 9 wickets in six games, and won two man of the match awards before Narine assumed his position in the team again.http://www.cricket.com.au/news/match-report/kolkata-knight-riders- chennai-super-kings-ipl-brad-hogg-gautam-gabhir-pat-cummins-ms- dhoni/2015-04-30 On 28 April 2015, he became the oldest player ever to feature in an IPL match when he played against Chennai Super Kings at the age of 44 years and 81 days. He made headlines again in 2015 when he re-signed for the 2015/16 Perth Scorchers team in the BBL with his unique comedy announcement. Hogg made the surprising move from the Perth Scorchers to the Melbourne Renegades for BBL06.http://www.smh.com.au/sport/cricket/melbourne-renegades- sign-veteran-spinner-brad-hogg-20160711-gq2vj2.html Approaching BBL08, he was left unsigned and has not featured in any form of cricket since. The Melbourne Renegades ultimately won the title that season. Playing style He is one of the few bowlers who bowls left-arm wrist spin in international cricket. He has an excellent wrong'un and a well-disguised flipper, which he used to bowl Andy Flower, who was then considered to be one of the world's best at playing spin bowling, during the 2003 World Cup. In his book, Walking to Victory, Adam Gilchrist described it as \\"one of the balls of the tournament.\\" During the 2007 Cricket World Cup, Hogg beat Andrew Flintoff with two consecutive wrong'uns, with the second one resulting in Flintoff being given out stumped. Hogg is well known for his use of his tongue while bowling, poking it out just before he bowls, which was considered his trademark.  Controversy  During the second test against India in Sydney it was alleged that Hogg called the Indian captain Anil Kumble and vice-captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni \\"bastards\\". Hogg faced a ban of between two and four Test matches after being charged with the level three offence under the International Cricket Council's Code of conduct which refers to abuse by reference to a player's \\"race, religion, gender, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin.\\" The hearing was set to take place on 14 January in Perth, but the BCCI dropped the charges a few days later.Australian cricketer Hogg charged for making offensive remark 2008-01-08India withdraw Hogg abuse charge;BBC Sport;2008-01-14 References External links 1971 births Antigua Hawksbills cricketers Australia One Day International cricketers Australia Test cricketers Australia Twenty20 International cricketers Australian cricketers Cape Cobras cricketers Cricketers from Western Australia Curtin University alumni Kolkata Knight Riders cricketers Living people People educated at Aquinas College, Perth People from Narrogin, Western Australia Perth Scorchers cricketers Melbourne Renegades cricketers Sylhet Sixers cricketers Warwickshire cricketers Wayamba United cricketers Western Australia cricketers Australian people of Scottish descent ","title":"Brad Hogg"},{"id":"1384021","text":"Harvey Norman Murray Patterson (September 12, 1924 - April 8, 2014) was a Canadian politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served as a New Democratic member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1973 to 1975. His term in office is usually remembered for the controversial nature of his election. The son of Norman Clifford Patterson and Isabel Baker, he was born in Roland, Manitoba and educated at University of Manitoba, and served overseas with the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders in World War II. Patterson married Margaret Black in 1946. Before entering politics, he worked as a tractor trailer driver. In 1961, he was a delegate to the founding convention of the New Democratic Party in Ottawa, Ontario. He was actively involved in Winnipeg's labour movement, serving as President of the Winnipeg Labour Council in the early 1970s (at a time when the WLC was losing members to the Manitoba Federation of Labour). He was also the chairman for the province's 1970 Panel on Labour Relations and its 1971 Panel on Human Rights and Consumer Affairs. In the provincial election of 1973, Patterson ran for the NDP in the Winnipeg riding of Crescentwood against Progressive Conservative Lawrie Pollard and Liberal June Menzies. Patterson won on election night, but a judicial recount invalidated 150 ballots and handed the victory to Pollard. The recount was appealed and a revised count was a tie. The returning officer broke the tie in Patterson's favour. After an investigation into the ballot-counting process, Patterson's election was declared void on February 20, 1975. He ran again in the succeeding by-election, but finished third against Progressive Conservative Warren Steen and Liberal leader Charles Huband. He did not seek a return to public office after this time. In 1978, Patterson became Executive Secretary of the Winnipeg Labour Council. He retired in the mid-1980s.

Many policy areas specifically affect the youth of the United States, such as education issues and the juvenile justice system. The general trend in voter turnout for American elections has been decreasing for all age groups, but \\"young people's participation has taken the biggest nosedive\\". This low youth turnout is part of the generational trend of voting activity. Young people have the lowest turnout, though as the individual ages, turnout increases to a peak at the age of 50 and then falls again. Ever since 18-year-olds were given the right to vote in 1972, youth have been under represented at the polls. In 1976, one of the first elections in which 18-year-olds were able to vote, 18‚Äì24 year-olds made up 18 percent of all eligible voters in America, but only 13 percent actually voted ‚Äì an under- representation of one-third. In the next election in 1978, youth were under- represented by 50 percent. \\"Seven out of ten young people‚Ä¶did not vote in the 1996 presidential election‚Ä¶ 20 percent below the general turnout.\\" In 1998, out of the 13 percent of eligible youth voters in America, only five percent voted.

Recently, in the 2008 U.S. presidential election, the number of youth voters tripled and even quadrupled in some states compared to the 2004 elections.Harris, Chris. \\"Super Tuesday Youth Voter Turnout Triples, Quadruples in Some States.\\" MTV News. retrieved 6 Feb 2008. In 2008, Barack Obama spoke about the contributions of young people to his election campaign outside of just voter turnout. History of the Youth Vote  Initially, the framers of the U.S. Constitution and state voting laws were skeptical of the role of young people in American politics. States uniformly set 21 as the voting age, although Connecticut debated lowering it to 18 in 1819. In general, young Americans were expected to be deferential to their elders, and John Adams famously cautioned that expanding suffrage would encourage ‚Äúlads from twelve to twenty-one‚Äù to demand the right to vote. Adams, John, The Works of John Adams, Second President of the United States, vol. 9, Ed. quoted in Charles Francis Adams (Boston, 1856), 378. Yet as the suffrage expanded to non-property-holders in the early 1800s, young people came to play a larger role in politics. During the rise of Jacksonian Democracy, youths often organized Young Men‚Äôs clubs in support of the Democratic, National Republican, Whig, or Anti-Masonic parties. Grinspan, Jon. (2016) The Virgin Vote: How Young Americans Made Democracy Social, Politics Personal, and Voting Popular in the Nineteenth Century, (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press) Presidential campaigns often organized torch-lit rallies of thousands of marchers, and analyses of these club rosters show that members were often in their late teens and early twenties. Grinspan, Jon. (2009) ‚Äú‚ÄòYoung Men for War‚Äô: The Wide Awakes and Lincoln‚Äôs 1860 Presidential Campaign.‚Äù Journal of American History 96, 367. The demands of popular democracy ‚Äì which often drew voter turnouts above 80% of eligible voters ‚Äì led political machines to rely on youths as cheap, enthusiastic campaigners for political machines. In 1848, Abraham Lincoln suggested that the Whig Party in Springfield, Illinois, make use of ‚Äúthe shrewd, wild boys about town, whether just of age or a little under age.‚Äù Lincoln Abraham, June 22, 1848, Abraham Lincoln: The Collected Works, Eight Volumes, Ed. Roy P. Basler, (New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1953), 1: 491. In the mid- to-late 1800s, young men enthusiastically cast their ‚Äúvirgin vote‚Äù when turning 21. Voting was often seen as a rite of passage and public declaration of manhood, adulthood, and citizenship. Young African-Americans participated in voting and campaigning where they could vote, and young women, though prevented from voting themselves, followed politics closely, read partisan newspapers, and argued politics with the young men in their lives. Grinspan, Jon. (2016) The Virgin Vote. Around the turn of the 20th century, political reformers reduced party‚Äôs reliance on young activists in an effort to clean up politics. Youth turnout fell shortly thereafter, especially among first time ‚Äúvirgin voters,‚Äù whose turnout declined 53% between 1888 and 1924. Kleppner, Paul. (1982), Who Voted? The Dynamics of Electoral Turnout, 1870-1980, (New York: Praeger, 1982), 68-9 As turnout fell in the early 20th century, young people played less role in campaigning. Though individual campaigns, like those of Theodore Roosevelt in 1904, Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1932, and John F. Kennedy in 1960, specifically appealed to youth, political parties generally showed less systematic interest in the youth vote. Sustained interest in lowering the voting age began during World War II when Congress passed legislation allowing young men to be drafted at the age of eighteen. While a few individual states began to allow 18-year-old voting before the Civil Rights Extension Act of 1970 and 26th Amendment (1971) lowered the voting age to eighteen, efforts to lower the voting age generally garnered little support. By the late 1960s and early 1970s, young people had shown themselves to be vital political actors and were demanding more of a role in American public life. The qualities associated with youth ‚Äì young people's idealism, lack of \\"vested interests,\\" and openness to new ideas ‚Äì came to be seen as positive qualities for a political system that seemed to be in crisis. Rising high school graduation rates and young people's increasing access to political information also spurred re-evaluations of 18-year-olds' fitness for voting rights. In addition, Civil Rights organizations, the National Education Association, and youth-centered groups formed coalitions that coordinated lobbying and grassroots efforts aimed at lowering the voting age on both the state and national level. After the passage of the 26th Amendment, voter turnout among 18‚Äì24 year olds fell throughout the 1970s, ‚Äò80s, and ‚Äò90s, although there seems to have been a resurgence in the last generation. Variables affecting the youth vote in the United States The lack of youth participation in the voting process is not a random phenomenon. There are multiple variables that have an influence on the voting behaviors of youth in the United States. =Voting process= The voting process has two steps. An eligible voter ‚Äì a U.S. citizen over the age of 18 ‚Äì must first register to vote and then commit the act of voting. The voting process is regulated by each state individually and therefore varies from state to state. The process of registering to vote is different depending on the state. Pre-registration is available to youth under the age of 18 in 20 states and Washington D.C. Potential voters may also register on Election Day ‚Äì or on the day on which they vote early ‚Äì in 10 states and Washington D.C. This may be done at the polling place or at an election official's office. Residents of the 40 states which do not allow same day registration require potential voters to register by a deadline, typically from eight to 30 days out from the election. Over half of the states in the U.S. offer some sort or online voter registration. This consists of the same process as a paper registration form, only it is digital and sent to election officials to review over the web. This process was first introduced in Arizona in 2002. There are different regulations on the time and avenue through which a citizen can vote. Early voting is available in 33 states and Washington D.C. This must be done in person at a designated polling place. Early voting period lengths vary from state to state. If a potential voter is not able to vote in person on Election Day or during the early voting period, they may request an absentee ballot. In 20 states, an excuse must be filed to receive the absentee ballot. In 27 states and Washington D.C., a voter may acquire an absentee ballot without an excuse. In Washington, Oregon and Colorado, all voting is done through the mail. A ballot is mailed to the voters residence and after the voter fills it out, he/she may mail it back. No in person polls are conducted. Otherwise, the typical voting period is twelve hours on a weekday at which time voters must go to the polls in person and cast their votes. =Two party system= The winner-take-all system in the United States limits the success of third party candidates who may have a difficult time achieving an electoral majority. Young people are increasingly supporting third party candidates, though the American political system has continued to foster a two-party system. In 1992, Ross Perot, a third party candidate for president, won 22 percent of the 18‚Äì24 year-old vote, his strongest performance among any demographic group. These third party candidates who gain such support from the youth of the U.S. do not benefit from major party coffers ‚Äì they must campaign by themselves. =Frequent change of residence= Between the ages of 18 and 24, youth have the potential to graduate high school, move away to college and change residences multiple times as they begin their career. As youth change residences often, the local issues and elections relevant to the area may not affect the youth yet or be significant and change from residence to residence. College students face the decision whether to stay registered in their hometowns or to register in the community in which they will reside. The fewer federal tax obligations that apply to youth ages 18‚Äì24 only loosely tie them to the government and policy making decisions and do not entice youth to vote and make a change. =Lack of candidate contact= Young people complain that those in politics do not communicate with them. Political candidates and their campaigns know, through past election data, that youth are not a reliable voting group and choose to spend their campaign dollars on those who are more likely to turn out to vote. For this reason, candidates tend to focus on issues that pertain to their targeted voters to gain their support, further discouraging youth voters. The discouraged youth complete the cycle of neglect by not turning out to vote, proving to candidates that the youth are not a reliable voting group. \\"Elected officials respond to the preferences of voters, not non-voters,\\" therefore ignoring the youth of America who do not turn out to vote. =Volunteering efforts= Though many consider voting a civic activity, youth today seem to have separated the political from the civic. Youth often participate in volunteer opportunities, fundraisers and other activist activities. In this way, youth can make a difference in their communities and are able to see change immediately when seeing the larger picture of a movement, including the political aspect, may be more difficult or intangible. Efforts to encourage youth vote =Organizations= A variety of organizations worked to encourage young people to vote. By 2018, Rock the Vote, a platform used by grassroots campaigns, had registered over 7 million votes and gained over 350 partners directing people to its online registration tool. Another organization working on registering young voters nationwide is The Civics Center, a sister organization of Rock the Vote. It has launched a campaign that engages with over 1,000 schools nationwide. Efforts before the 1970s include: * Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee *Black Panthers * Young Lords *Youth Liberation of Ann Arbor Later efforts include: * 18 in '08 *18by.Vote * Bus Federation Civic Fund * Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE) * College Republicans and College Democrats of America all over country * Declare Yourself * HeadCount, picked by the Ad Council in 2018 for a spot to be seen by 10 million * Hip Hop Summit Action Network * Inspire U.S. * League of Young Voters * Make It 100 * MTV * National Stonewall Democrats * New Voters Project * New York Public Interest Research Group (NYPIRG) * Sean Combs's \\"Vote or Die\\" campaign * Spitfire Strategies * Our Time * TurboVote.org (with Snapchat and others) * When We All Vote, co-chaired by Michelle Obama * World Wrestling Entertainment's Smackdown Your Vote * Young Greens Caucus * Young Voter PAC * Young Voter's Alliance * YouthVote USA =Campaign strategies= Because the youth population is so large, many campaigns try to gain their support during elections. Efforts to capture the youth vote include registration drives, outreach, and specifically youth-friendly policy platforms. An example of a fairly successful voter registration drive would be the \\"Reggie the Rig\\" drive by the Republican National Committee in the 2004 election. With a goal of registering three million new voters, the \\"Reggie the Rig\\" bus traveled to college campuses, a place to reach thousands of potential youth voters at once. During the same election, the Democrats held their own campus visits, but instead of focusing on registration, the Kerry campaign spread the word about their youth policy platform called Compact with the Next Generation. The Democrats also placed targeted ads on TV during shows such as Saturday Night Live and The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. This targeted campaign on TV has often been supplemented with outreach through the internet in modern campaigns. New technology, especially the internet, is making it easier for candidates to reach the youth. It has been found that \\"young people who encounter campaign information on their own accord and spend time interacting with political material may come to see themselves interested in politics.\\" Young adults are \\"over-represented among all computer and Internet users\\" ‚Äì three fourths of Americans under the age of 18 are able to access a computer and, on average, use it for half an hour a day. As the Internet and computers have become more accessible to youth, such methods have been used to seek and find information and share it on social media cites. Websites such as Facebook and YouTube not only allow youth who don't subscribe to newspapers or watch the evening news to stay on top of the polls, but also allows them to share their opinions of the polls and candidates.Von Drehle, David. \\"Why Young Voters Care Again.\\" Time Magazine. Feb 2008:34-48 If the use of technology were to be fully integrated into politics, the youth and adult groups would be equally active in politics. Online news media, in particular, is believed to have a positive impact on young citizens due to its interactivity. It not only provides them with the information they need to form their political beliefs, become more informed regarding democracy, and to gain a better understanding of current issues, but it also provides them with a platform to discuss these ideas with other individuals, not only on a more localized scale but also on a global scale. =Legislation= In the United States, there has been legislation passed to help youth access the vote. The National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), often called the \\"motor-voter\\" law, passed in 1993, allows those 18 years and older to register to vote at a driver's license office or public assistance agency. The law also required states to accept a uniform mail-in voter registration application. Additionally, some states have extended the period in which citizens can vote instead of requiring a vote within 12 hours on a single day. Two cities in Maryland, Takoma Park and Hyattsville, allow 16 and 17-year-olds to vote in local elections.

Dedicated 1994 The Temple in Independence, Missouri, is a house of worship and education \\"dedicated to the pursuit of peace\\".Doctrine and Covenants, Section 156:5 It dominates the skyline of Independence and has become the focal point of the headquarters of the Community of Christ (formerly, the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.Questions and Answers on Church Name Change) The temple was built by the Community of Christ in response to a revelation presented at their 1984 World Conference by church prophet-president Wallace B. Smith. The revelation was the culmination of instructions shared over the course of more than 150 years by prior prophet-presidents recognized by the Community of Christ. Groundbreaking for the temple took place on 6 April 1990, and the completed structure was dedicated on 17 April 1994. Structure and building Looking up the spire from the sanctuary of the temple. The temple was designed by Gyo Obata and evokes the spiral shell of the nautilus with a stainless steel spire that rises .Chiat, Marilyn; North American Churches, Publications International, Ltd.:2004, p. 72. The facility displays art which comprises a collection of modern and traditional religious art from around the world. The entry to the sanctuary is through an etched glass archway depicting the Sacred Grove where Joseph Smith had his initial revelatory experience. This leads to the gently ascending worshipper's path of textured stone which spirals around its periphery. Along the path are artworks and a fountain symbolizing the \\"living water\\" of John 4:10 for meditative focus. The temple's main sanctuary has seating for approximately 1,600. It houses a Casavant pipe organ with 60 stops, 102 ranks, and 5685 pipes. At the exit foyer in the mouth of the spiral, \\"The Field is White, Already to Harvest\\" (see John: 4:35) is a large stained glass wall depicting rice and wheat, that earned an American Institute of Architects award for religious art. Adjacent are the massive bronze exit doors which carry the church seal depicting the peaceful lion, lamb, and child from Isaiah 11:6 and the word \\"PEACE\\". The wide steps open up onto a world plaza with global map of inlaid brick. The public is welcomed to the temple, where there is a Daily Prayer for Peace at 1:00 p.m. Central Time on behalf of a selected nation of the world. A meditation chapel with paintings by Jack Garnier of the Sacraments being performed around the world opens onto a Japanese style meditation garden and serves the needs of individuals or small groups of visitors. The temple also contains the church archives, the Temple School, administrative offices of church headquarters, theaters used for visitors and also for meetings, presentations, and classes, a museum and gift shop. The building has become a popular attraction with guided tours available. Approximately 60,000 people visit the temple each year. Temple ministries The Temple as seen from the Temple Lot. The temple is regarded as a symbol of the church's mission and has long been closely associated with the denomination's developing theology of Zion, or the peaceable Kingdom of God, first advocated as basileia tou theou by Jesus Christ. The first major event held at the temple prior to its dedication was the International Women's Conference in June 1993. The temple has no private ceremonies and is open to everyone. The sacraments performed there are communion, administration to the sick (laying on of hands), and priesthood ordination. Initially, six temple ministries centers were created in response to the building of the temple. The temple according to Ken Robinson, former member of the First Presidency, \\"gives form to our commitment to Jesus Christ\\" and that it \\"is at the center of meaning and identity for members of...Community of Christ\\" Robinson, Kenneth N., \\"A People of the Temple,\\" The Herald, July 2006, p. 12. Temple lot Wallace B. Smith's great-grandfather and founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, Joseph Smith, visited Jackson County in 1831 and prophesied that a temple to the Lord would be built there.Doctrine and Covenants (Community of Christ), Section 57:1d The early Latter Day Saints purchased a parcel of land known as the \\"greater temple lot.\\" At that time a portion of the property was dedicated as the site for a temple, and cornerstones were laid. However, the church members were driven from the county before any construction began. The original temple site proper is now owned by the Church of Christ (Temple Lot). The Community of Christ's temple is built on the greater temple lot, as is the Auditorium, the headquarters chapel of the Church of Christ (Temple Lot) and a visitor center of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The Community of Christ also owns the temple in Kirtland, Ohio, the first temple actually built (rather than merely planned) by the Latter Day Saint movement, which continues to be a place of worship and education. As part of its educational ministry that site is open as a National Historic Landmark.

He was a founder and co-leader with James Laxer of the Waffle, a left-wing political formation within the New Democratic Party that advocated an \\"independent socialist Canada\\" and Canadian nationalism. He was appointed a Member of the Order of Canada in 2019. Life and career Watkins was born on May 15, 1932 on a farm near McKellar, Ontario; one of six children born to Wilmot and Sadie Watkins. At the age of 16, he and his twin brother, Murray, enrolled at the University of Toronto where among his lecturers was Harold Innis, whose staples thesis became a lifelong influence on his thinking. He pursued graduate work as a classical economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He became a professor of economics at the University of Toronto in 1958 and, in 1963, published an academic article, \\"A Staple Theory of Economic Growth‚Äù, which revised and updated Innis's staples thesis and was influential in the growing Canadian economic nationalist movement and also brought him to the attention of Canadian finance minister Walter L. Gordon. His political activity followed his work heading up the federal government's Task Force on Foreign Ownership and the Structure of Canadian Investment, which investigated the impact of growing American control of the Canadian economy. Striking this task force of economists had been urged upon the Pearson government by former Liberal finance minister Walter Gordon. The \\"Watkins Report\\", as it was widely known, was issued in 1968 and recommended strict regulation of foreign investment in Canada, particularly foreign ownership of Canadian businesses and resources. Its findings led to the establishment of the Canada Development Corporation to help facilitate greater Canadian ownership as well as the Foreign Investment Review Agency to regulate foreign ownership. His concern for Canadian economic sovereignty led him to join others in 1969 to found the Waffle, which issued a Manifesto for an Independent Socialist Canada calling for increased public ownership of the economy as a means of securing Canadian independence from the United States, as well as establishing social and economic equity. The group was essentially expelled from the New Democratic Party (NDP) in 1972 and while Watkins supported the group's attempt to form a new left-wing political party, the Movement for an Independent Socialist Canada, his interest and involvement waned, particularly when he left to spend time in the far north to investigate the living conditions of the indigenous Dene people. After the collapse of the Waffle in 1974, Watkins spent most of his time teaching and writing. In the early 1970s, Watkins was hired by the Dene Nation (then known as the Indian Brotherhood of the Northwest Territories) as the economic adviser for their delegation to the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline Inquiry. In the 1980s and 1990s, he was active in opposition to the Canada‚ÄìUnited States Free Trade Agreement and then to the North American Free Trade Agreement describing them as \\"charters of rights for corporations.\\" He eventually rejoined the NDP, and ran as its candidate in Beaches‚ÄîEast York in the 1997 and 2000 federal elections. He placed second on both occasions behind Liberal Maria Minna. Watkins supported the New Politics Initiative, which was formed in 2001 to attempt to convince the NDP to join with social movements to found a new left-wing party. He retired from academia and moved to Constance Bay in eastern Ontario, where he continued to write a column for This Magazine and pieces for other publications. He was also a board member of and regular contributor to the online newsmagazine Straight Goods. He also served as president of Science for Peace, and a was a was member of Pugwash Canada.

He is a disc jockey based in Detroit, Michigan whose on-air journey of musical and social development shaped a generation of music-lovers in Detroit and throughout southeastern Michigan and Canada and was of importance to the development of Detroit techno. He is recognized for having introduced many artists into the Detroit radio market, including Prince, The B-52's, and Kraftwerk,http://music.aol.com/artist/the- electrifying-mojo/biography/1154963 and was occasionally thanked on-air by the artists for his support of their work. Prince granted Mojo a telephone interviewhttp://princetext.tripod.com/i_mojo85.html following a sold out birthday concert at Cobo Arena on June 7, 1986, during an era when Prince rarely if ever granted interviews. He was visited in the studio by The B-52's and The J. Geils Band with the latter thanking him for playing \\"Flamethrower\\" from their album Freeze Frame. History Mojo's seminal radio show ran from 1977 through the mid-1980s, and while broadcast on stations marketed toward the African-American market, his programming was a combination of soul, funk, new wave, hip hop, and rock. He also wrote music, sometimes under the name \\"C. J. Surge\\". After serving in the Air Force, Johnson attended the University of Michigan in the mid-1970s where he began broadcasting on the University radio station and then on Ann Arbor station WAAM (at the time a popular Top 40 station). In 1977, he began broadcasting on WGPR (107.5) in Detroit and soon gathered a diverse audience attracted to his \\"genre bending\\" format. Moving to WJLB around 1982, Mojo gained additional listeners at the more easily found 97.9 frequency and billboards throughout Detroit touted the \\"Landing of the Mothership\\" at 10:00 every night. Mojo moved to WHYT (96.3) in 1985 and then WTWR-FM in Toledo, Ohio after a management turnover at WHYT in 1987, until 1990, when he accepted an offer to return to the Detroit airwaves at WMXD. At this time, Mojo began doing remote broadcasts, driving around Detroit, talking to people in the city, while his Production assistant Wendell Burke kept the music going at the studio. In the mid-nineties, Mojo went back to WGPR. Musically, this included shows focused on single themes, such as symphonic music by black composers, a survey of the jazz and symphonic music of Duke Ellington, and one alternating the music of Billie Holiday with spoken excerpts from her autobiography. He, as before, frequently played recordings in their entirety. In an unusual arrangement, Mojo was purchasing his air-time from WGPR and then finding his own sponsors for the show. His two primary sponsors at this time were a deli and an insurance agency. He also dedicated airtime to reading excerpts from his 500-plus page book, The Mental Machine (), a work of poetry and prose about community and societal ills. The late 1990s brought Mojo to WCHB for a stretch in 1998 where he began broadcasting his show over the internet for a short time. He also was making guest appearances on the now defunct WDTR around 2004. Influence Mojo's habit was to play entire recordings without interruption. Mojo would often play hours of Prince's music, not only his hits, but deep album cuts and b-sides. When Prince was about to release a new album, Mojo would often play the album in its entirety, and this practice continued into the 1990s. The trio of artists widely cited as the founders of Detroit Techno, Juan Atkins, Kevin Saunderson, and Derrick May have all made mention of Mojo's influence on their musical development , as have second generation Techno artists like Richie Hawtin (Plastikman), Jeff Mills (The fm98 Wizard) and Carl Craig . Other Detroit radio personalities imitated concepts from his shows during his absence from the Detroit airwaves in the mid-1990s, like with WHYT disk jockey Lisa Lisa, who produced segments on her evening show such as the \\"Midnight Mix Association\\" and her version of \\"Lover's Lane.\\" For a brief period the Midnight Mix Association used a \\"spaceship\\" introduction which was similar to Mojo's show which was later replaced by an introduction that had a mixture of The Wizard of Oz, church bells and a Civil defense siren: \\"We're not in Kansas anymore...it's among the hour to come amongst you and amaze you with absolute incredible out of this world type sounds, look out here we go.\\" Mojo also made calls to the Lisa Lisa show encouraging, as well as thanking her for continuing his \\"format\\" in a way that he could be proud of .

He served as a New Democratic member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1973 to 1977, representing Emerson. He played baseball as a catcher with the Vita Cubs, Tolstoi Jets, Winkler Royals and Rossburn. After he retired from baseball, he continued to play slow pitch and was a member of the winning Manitoba Fastball provincial champion team in the age 65+ category in 2000. Derewianchuk was named to the Manitoba Baseball Hall of Fame in 2007. In the provincial election of 1973, he defeated Progressive Conservative candidate Garnet Kyle by 437 votes; a strong showing by Liberal Mark Smerchanski may have split the centre-right vote, and contributed to Derewianchuk's victory. Derewianchuk was the first, and to date the only, candidate of the NDP to be elected in the rural, southeastern riding of Emerson. He does not appear to have played a major role in the legislature.

The film is a sequel to the 2001 horror film Jeepers Creepers. Francis Ford Coppola executive produced the film. The film was followed 14 years later in 2017 by Jeepers Creepers 3 which received a limited release in theaters. Plot On its twenty-second day of feeding, The Creeper disguised as a scarecrow abducts young Billy Taggart in front of his father Jack, and older brother Jack Jr. The next day, a school bus carrying a high school basketball team and cheerleaders suffers a blowout, after one of the tires is hit by a hand- crafted shuriken made of bone fragments. Later, cheerleader Minxie Hayes has a vision of Billy Taggart and Darry Jenner, another victim of the Creeper, who attempt to warn her about The Creeper, before he blows out another tire, disabling the bus. With the team stranded, The Creeper abducts bus driver Betty Borman and Coach Charlie Hanna; Coach Dwayne Barnes attempts to flee back into the bus, but is taken by The Creeper when Scotty Braddock confronts him and refuses to let him in. When he returns, he singles out six of the students: Dante Belasco, Jake Spencer, Minxie Hayes, Scotty, Andy ‚ÄúBucky‚Äù Buck, and Deaundre ‚ÄúDouble D‚Äù Davis. Minxie has another vision in which Darry says The Creeper emerges every twenty-third spring, for twenty-three days to eat humans, and she tells the other students. After hearing several police reports, the Taggarts go hunting for The Creeper and soon make radio contact with the school bus. The Creeper attacks Bucky, but Rhonda stabs it through the head with a javelin. Dante begins prodding the Creeper‚Äôs wing, only for it to grab and decapitate him. The Creeper tears off its injured head and uses Dante‚Äôs severed head to replace its own. The students decide to leave the bus to find help, but the Creeper returns and chases them into a field, where The Creeper kills Jake and takes Scotty. When The Creeper attacks Jonny, Chelsea, and Bucky on the bus again, the Taggarts arrive and Jack shoots it with a home-made harpoon, but The Creeper fights him off and manages to escape after flipping over the bus. Rhonda, Izzy Cohen, and Double D find a truck and attempt to escape but are chased by the Creeper again. Izzy pushes Rhonda out of the truck before causing the vehicle to crash, injuring both Double D and the Creeper, who loses an arm, a leg, and a wing, although Izzy crawls from the wreckage before the truck explodes. The Creeper continues to pursue Double D by leaping towards him and, when it has Double D pinned down, Jack shows up and shoots the Creeper in the head with the harpoon. He repeatedly stabs the Creeper in the chest but it goes into a hibernation state before it can die. 23 years later, a group of teenagers drive to the Taggart farm, where the Creeper is a sideshow attraction, called \\"The Bat Out of Hell\\". They see an elderly Jack watching it with the harpoon at his side, and when they ask him if he is waiting for something, he looks up at the Creeper and says: ‚Äúabout three more days, give or take a day or two\\".

It was published in 2002. Plot summary Fitz has succeeded in rescuing Prince Dutiful from the clutches of the Piebald rebels. But once again the cost of protecting the Farseer line has been dear: Nighteyes is dead. Fitz, though bitter and grieving after the death of his beloved wit-partner, the wolf Nighteyes, reluctantly takes the post of Skillmaster to teach prince Dutiful the Skill. He feels he must since he is almost Dutiful's father. Dutiful, the heir to the throne, was conceived by Verity using Fitz's body fifteen years earlier with the use of the skill, and because of this is both Skilled and Witted. Fitz is not a great teacher and barely has control of his own Skill, but he is the only one left that has been actually taught how to use it. He knows that Dutiful must be protected from the addictive qualities of the Skill, as well as the dangerous temptations of the Wit and the political machinations surrounding both as the Piebalds threaten to throw the Six Duchies into civil war. At the urging of his old mentor the Master Assassin Chade, now Queen Kettricken's Lord Councillor, he also attempts to seek new Skill users as companions for Dutiful. Maintaining a pose as the servant Tom Badgerlock to the Fool's own pose as the decadent noble Lord Golden, he stays in the castle and teaches his new Skill coterie, including the overeager Chade. His search leads him to a most unlikely candidate; a mentally-challenged young man named Thick, suspicious after years of mistreatment but stronger in the Skill than anyone Fitz has ever encountered. At the same time, the Six Duchies also faces what may be its salvation in a long-term peace, or a new threat to the fragile peace that has existed since the end of the Red Ship War. Queen Kettricken plans to betrothe Dutiful to the Outislander Narcheska (Princess) Elliania, to forge a lasting alliance between the two lands as her marriage to Verity once did. The task is less simple than it appears, and Fitz becomes aware of wheels within wheels, as different interests war with each other with the stakes higher than anyone has imagined. These finally come to a head as Elliania declares she will not wed Dutiful without his undertaking a quest to slay Icefyre, one of the last true dragons.

It is one of several igneous \\"volcanic plug\\" formations that feature on the landscape near the Capricorn Coast. Traditionally home to a group of Aboriginal Australians known as the Darumbal people, it was returned to them in 2007 under the Aboriginal Land Act. History Gawula is the traditional home of the Taroombal people. Many indigenous groups from the region would meet at this site to exchange tools and arrange marriages. Accessed 6 February 2016 A confrontation between early European settlers and the Aboriginal Darumbal people reportedly occurred on or near Mt Wheeler, involving a number of Aboriginal deaths. In 1868 gold was found on the mountain. While initial mining was successful, a report in 1887 states that one of the largest gold nuggets in Queensland was found there; the same report also indicates that the mining success quickly petered out. More recently Mt Wheeler became something of a lookout spot for scenic views during the 20th century, and has been used as a Recreation Reserve for bushwalking and mountain biking. In 2007, ownership of the mountain was handed over to 25 trustees representing the Darumbal, the traditional owners of the mountain. The deed of grant to the Gawula Aboriginal Land Trust was the first in the Rockhampton region under the Aboriginal Land Act (1991). Naming According to local historians, Gawula was given the name \\"Mount Cock‚Äôs Comb\\" by Captain Cook in 1770. However this is not corroborated by Cook's Endeavour journal or other sources. The mountain was later named Mt Wheeler. Although some have suggested it was named after Frederick Wheeler, an inspector with the Native Police, who is alleged to have been involved in a massacre of Aboriginal people at the site, forcing them to jump off the cliffs by the hundreds - archival evidence suggests it was more likely named such after Gold Commissioner John Wheeler who worked in the area during the 1860s. Physical features Gawula is a steep-sided volcanic plug, similar to other surrounding mountains like Mount Jim Crow and Pine Mountain. There are large cliffs on its western face. On the south-east face is a type of soft rock which has formed into many huge caverns and overhangs. Mount Wheeler stands at approximately high.

Life Glaser was born in Manhattan, the daughter of Max Meyer (1916-1998) and his wife Edith (1919-2003), and grew up with her brother Peter in Hewlett Harbor, New York; her father was the CEO of Ex-Lax. Glaser was a sister of Alpha Epsilon Phi at the University of Wisconsin, and also attended Boston University, earning a master‚Äôs degree in early childhood education. She became a teacher, and a director of the Los Angeles Children's Museum. Elizabeth married Paul Michael Glaser in 1980. Illness In August 1981, Elizabeth contracted HIV through blood transfusions she received due to complications before the birth of the couple's first child, Ariel. She did not find out that she had unknowingly passed the virus on to Ariel through breast milk, and that her son, Jake (born October 1984) had contracted the virus in utero until four years later, when she, Ariel, and Jake tested positive for HIV in 1985. Her husband, Paul, tested negative for the virus. Ariel Glaser had developed advanced AIDS at a time when the medical community knew very little about the disease, and there were no available treatment options; she suffered some of the same ostracism from her school as Ryan White experienced. Early in 1987, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration finally approved AZT as an effective drug to extend the lives of AIDS patients, but the approval only extended to adults. With their daughter's condition rapidly deteriorating, the Glasers fought to have her treated with AZT intravenously. However, the treatment came too late, and the child eventually succumbed to the disease late in the summer of 1988.\\"Breaking a Silence: 'Starsky' Star, Wife Share Their Family's Painful Battle Against AIDS\\" Los Angeles Times. 25 August 1989. Accessed 6 December 2006. Legacy Mourning the loss of her daughter and determined to save her surviving child Jake, along with other HIV-positive children, Glaser co-founded the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation in 1988, with friends Susan DeLaurentis and Susie Zeegen. Glaser's work raised public awareness about HIV infection in children and spurred funding for the development of pediatric AIDS drugs as well as research into mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV. (Glaser's children received the virus through two of the most common means of MTCT.) The foundation is a major force in funding the study of pediatric HIV problems and tackling juvenile AIDS, both domestically and globally. Her book In the Absence of Angels (1991), written with journalist Laura Palmer, was described as \\"a handbook of how the connected make waves in America\\". Glaser entered the national spotlight as a speaker at the 1992 Democratic National Convention where she criticized the federal government's under-funding of AIDS research and its lack of initiative in tackling the AIDS crisis. This speech is listed as #79 in American Rhetoric's Top 100 Speeches of the 20th Century (listed by rank). The AIDS Memorial Quilt contains five panels with Elizabeth Glaser and her daughter Ariel Glaser's name on each of them, three panels with Elizabeth Glaser's name alone on each of them, and two panels with Ariel Glaser's name alone on each of them. In 2000, Alpha Epsilon Phi adopted the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation as their national philanthropy. Ariel later had a Beanie Baby named in her honor with the logo being a picture she drew when she was five. Elizabeth Meyer Glaser died at the age of 47, from complications of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), at her home in Santa Monica on December 3, 1994. Her son Jake is now an adult who often speaks publicly on behalf of AIDS patients. Jake remains relatively healthy due to a mutation of the CCR5 gene that protects his white blood cells.

The concept of a PNR was first introduced by airlines that needed to exchange reservation information in case passengers required flights of multiple airlines to reach their destination (‚Äúinterlining‚Äù). For this purpose, IATA and ATA have defined standards for interline messaging of PNR and other data through the \\"ATA/IATA Reservations Interline Message Procedures - Passenger\\" (AIRIMP). There is no general industry standard for the layout and content of a PNR. In practice, each CRS or hosting system has its own proprietary standards, although common industry needs, including the need to map PNR data easily to AIRIMP messages, has resulted in many general similarities in data content and format between all of the major systems. When a passenger books an itinerary, the travel agent or travel website user will create a PNR in the computer reservation system it uses. This is typically one of the large Global Distribution Systems, such as Amadeus, Sabre, or Travelport (Apollo, Galileo, and Worldspan) but if the booking is made directly with an airline the PNR can also be in the database of the airline‚Äôs CRS. This PNR is called the Master PNR for the passenger and the associated itinerary. The PNR is identified in the particular database by a record locator. When portions of the travel are not provided by the holder of the Master PNR, then copies of the PNR information are sent to the CRSs of the airlines that will be providing transportation. These CRSs will open copies of the original PNR in their own database to manage the portion of the itinerary for which they are responsible. Many airlines have their CRS hosted by one of the GDSs, which allows sharing of the PNR. The record locators of the copied PNRs are communicated back to the CRS that owns the Master PNR, so all records remain tied together. This allows exchanging updates of the PNR when the status of trip changes in any of the CRSs. Although PNRs were originally introduced for air travel, airlines systems can now also be used for bookings of hotels, car rental, airport transfers, and train trips. Parts From a technical point, there are five parts of a PNR required before the booking can be completed. They are: *The name of the passenger *Contact details for the travel agent or airline office. *Ticketing details, either a ticket number or a ticketing time limit. *Itinerary of at least one segment, which must be the same for all passengers listed. *Name of the person providing the information or making the booking. Other information, such as a timestamp and the agency's pseudo-city code, will go into the booking automatically. All entered information will be retained in the \\"history\\" of the booking. Once the booking has been completed to this level, the CRS will issue a unique all alpha or alpha-numeric record locator, which will remain the same regardless of any further changes made (except if a multi-person PNR is split). Each airline will create their own booking record with a unique record locator, which, depending on service level agreement between the CRS and the airline(s) involved, will be transmitted to the CRS and stored in the booking. If an airline uses the same CRS as the travel agency, the record locator will be the same for both. A considerable amount of other information is often desired by both the airlines and the travel agent to ensure efficient travel. This includes: *Fare details, (although the amount may be suppressed, the type of fare will be shown), and any restrictions that may apply to the ticket. *Tax amounts paid to the relevant authorities involved in the itinerary. *The form of payment used, as this will usually restrict any refund if the ticket is not used. *Further contact details, such as agency phone number and address, additional phone contact numbers at passenger address and intended destination. *Age details if it is relevant to the travel, e.g., unaccompanied children or elderly passengers requiring assistance. *Frequent flyer data. *Seat allocation (or seat type request). *Special Service Requests (SSR) such as meal requirements, wheelchair assistance, and other similar requests. *\\"Optional Services Instruction\\" or \\"Other Service Information\\" (OSI) - information sent to a specific airline, or all airlines in the booking, which enables them to better provide a service. This information can include ticket numbers, local contacts details (the phone section is limited to only a few entries), airline staff onload and upgrade priority codes, and other details such as a passenger's language or details of a disability. *Vendor Remarks. VRs are comments made by the airline, typically generated automatically once the booking or request is completed. These will normally include the airline's own record locator, replies to special requests, and advice on ticketing time limits. While normally sent by the airlines to an agent, it is also possible for an agent to send a VR to an airline. In more recent times, many governments now require the airline to provide further information included assisting investigators tracing criminals or terrorists. These include: *Passengers' gender *Passport details - nationality, number, and date of expiry *Date and place of birth *Redress number, (if previously given to the passenger by the US authorities). *All available payment/billing information. The components of a PNR are identified internally in a CRS by a one-character code. This code is often used when creating a PNR via direct entry into a terminal window (as opposed to using a graphical interface). The following codes are standard across all CRSs based on the original PARS system: * - Name * 0 Segment (flight) information, including number of seats booked, status code (for example HK1 - confirmed for 1 passenger) and fare class * 1 Related PNR record ids. * 2 PNR owner identification (airline, CRS user name and role) * 3 Other airline Other Service Information (OSI) or Special Service Request (SSR) items * 4 Host airline OSI or SSR items * 5 Remarks * 6 Received from * 7 Ticketing information (including ticket number) * 8 Ticketing time limit * 9 Contact phone numbers Storage The majority of airlines and travel agencies choose to host their PNR databases with a Computer Reservations System (CRS) or Global Distribution System (GDS) company such as Sabre, Galileo, Worldspan and Amadeus.Strauss, Michael (2010): Value Creation in Travel Distribution Privacy concerns Some privacy organizations are concerned at the amount of personal data that a PNR might contain. While the minimum data for completing a booking is quite small, a PNR will typically contain much more information of a sensitive nature. This will include the passenger‚Äôs full name, date of birth, home and work address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card details, IP address if booked online, as well as the names and personal information of emergency contacts. Designed to ‚Äúfacilitate easy global sharing of PNR data,‚Äù the CRS-GDS companies ‚Äúfunction both as data warehouses and data aggregators, and have a relationship to travel data analogous to that of credit bureaus to financial data.‚Äù.Electronic Privacy Information Center, Privacy & Human Rights ‚Äì An International Survey of Privacy Laws and Developments 2004, 81. A canceled or completed trip does not erase the record since ‚Äúcopies of the PNRs are ‚Äòpurged‚Äô from live to archival storage systems, and can be retained indefinitely by CRSs, airlines, and travel agencies.‚ÄùPrivacy & Human Rights, 81. Further, CRS-GDS companies maintain web sites that allow almost unrestricted access to PNR data ‚Äì often, the information is accessible by just the reservation number printed on the ticket. Additionally, ‚Äú[t]hrough billing, meeting, and discount eligibility codes, PNRs contain detailed information on patterns of association between travelers. PNRs can contain religious meal preferences and special service requests that describe details of physical and medical conditions (e.g., ‚ÄúUses wheelchair, can control bowels and bladder‚Äù) ‚Äì categories of information that have special protected status in the European Union and some other countries as ‚Äúsensitive‚Äù personal data.‚ÄùPrivacy & Human Rights, 80. See Edward Hasbrouck, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs in A Passenger Name Record (PNR)?,‚Äù http://hasbrouck.org/articles/PNR.html Despite the sensitive character of the information they contain, PNRs are generally not recognized as deserving the same privacy protection afforded to medical and financial records. Instead, they are treated as a form of commercial transaction data.

For those 0.05% to 0.1% of passengers who are referred to Customs for further evaluation, the airline PNR data are temporarily retained, but not stored, pending resolution of the border evaluation. After resolution, their PNR data are erased from the PC of the Customs PAU officer concerned and are not entered into Australian databases.

It made its world debut in Detroit, at the 2005 North American International Auto Show.Infiniti Kuraza Concept - Infiniti Online Newsroom The Infiniti Kuraza ultimately never made it to production. Design The Kuraza focuses more on space than utility in its design, featuring stadium-style six-passenger seating, which allow passengers unhindered access to rear seats using third-row doors. The designers built the Kuraza on the idea that all luxury passengers should be treated equally. This spawned the idea that all seats in the luxury vehicle will be equally as comfortable in all dimensions. Nagano stated that the Kuraza concept was about hospitality rather than transportation, with the design intending the vehicle to be a social space. The Kuraza design team decided that one of the limiting factors of comfort in luxury SUVs was convenient access to rear seating, and there are wide, unhinged, 3rd row doors on the Kuraza to deal with inconvenient access. Japanese Design Elements The Kuraza team aimed to fuse the elements of traditional Japanese heritage and luxury with modern technology. The shape of the seatbacks are meant to suggest traditional the Japanese kimono. The layers of fabric reference Juni-hitoe design. The Infiniti logo is also on each seat, that is supposed to represent where a family crest could be found. The Uramasari tradition of fine clothing is also represented by the combination of materials used in the seats, leather for outer areas and raw silk underneath. The aluminium and wood flooring is also cut in the traditional Chijimi grain method. The Kuraza has a large touch screen 16 by 6 inch vertically oriented center monitor. This monitor is a modern interpretation of Kakejiku. The design team stated that they were looking for new ways to add an emotional element to information-centric monitors. The monitor can also be programmed with modern applications, such as weather and road conditions. Interior The interior of the Kuraza includes six-passenger seating, a center beam console, LED lightning, door grips, foot rests, foot wells, and six individual reading lights. The Kuraza also has large windowed areas, with a glass overhead made of three panels for a panoramic view from all seats, with soft overhead lighting at night.Infiniti Kuraza Concept Exterior The Kuraza‚Äôs exterior includes an Infiniti-style ‚Äúdouble-arch‚Äù tinted aluminum grille, multi-lamp LED headlights, with a tiny ‚Äúsurround-view‚Äù camera for blind spots. The Kuraza‚Äôs exterior is a deep violet color, with a metallic flake. Fine-grain finish aluminum is used all around the exterior of the vehicle. The vehicle runs on 23-inch 8-spoke aluminum- alloy wheels, and Special Dunlop 305/45R23 tires.

It was acquired in July 2005 by UPS. History The company's history dates back to the nationalisation of the British Railways after World War II. Each of the pre nationalisation companies had formed a local delivery network, based on lorries and vans, to extend the railway to the customer's door, thus enabling parcels and light freight to be delivered in the control of the railway company. These services were amalgamated to form a division of British Road Services in January 1955, known in its shortened version of BRS Parcels. National Carriers was the name given to the amalgamated companies that concentrated on rail transport, while BRS Parcels became Roadline The Conservative Government of Margaret Thatcher privatised these services in 1982, making shares in the newly formed National Freight Corporation available to employees at a price which proved to undervalue the company when they were floated on the stock market. National Carriers and Roadline were merged and operated briefly under the name National Carriers Roadline, before settling on the name Lynx Express Delivery Network. This remained the company's full title, although it was popularly shortened. Following a reorganisation, rationalisation of core business interests and rebranding exercise, National Freight Corporation, by this time shortened to NFC plc, merged with Ocean Group plc and became known as Exel, and Lynx Express was seen as outside its main area of concentration. It was the subject of a management buyout from Exel in June 1997. The newly independent company was subsequently renamed Lynx Express. Lynx Express became majority owned by Bridgepoint Capital. In January 1999, the company acquired British Rail's remaining local delivery asset, Red Star Parcels.Lynx Express acquires Red Star In July 2005, Lynx Express was acquired by Atlanta, Georgia based UPS for ¬£55.5 million (US$97.1 million).

It is the lead ship of the Vista-class vessels, so named for the extensive use of glass in their superstructure, and is sister to three other HAL ships, , , and . The prefixes of the four ships' names represent the four directions of the compass in Dutch. The ship shares similar exterior dimensions with Carnival Cruise Lines' and Costa Cruises' . Cunard Line's is an enlarged version of the same design, as is HAL's Signature class. As with all Vista-class ships, Zuiderdam is equipped with a diesel-electric power plant and an Azipod propulsion system, and eighty-five percent of her staterooms have ocean views and sixty-seven percent have verandahs. Her art collection carries a Venetian theme throughout the ship; the most dazzling features figures in the time of Carnival in Venice, created by Daniel Ogier. Service history MS Zuiderdam at Hoek van Holland on August 16, 2019. Zuiderdam was christened by American broadcaster Joan Lunden at Port Everglades on December 14, 2002. Between October to April, Zuiderdam largely runs a southern Caribbean itinerary which includes a half-transit of the Panama Canal through the Gatun Locks. From May to September, the vessel travels to Alaska or the Northern Europe/Baltic region. On 9 June 2019, the ship's departure from the Kiel was delayed when members of climate activist group Smash Cruiseshit used smaller boats, blocking the seaport. Technical information The machinery spaces of Zuiderdam are vast and stretch along with two of its lowest decks for the most part of the vessel. MS Zuiderdam is powered by a CODAG propulsion system encompassing five (three 16-cylinder and two 12-cylinder) Sulzer ZAV40S diesel engines (built under license by Grandi Motori Trieste, now owned by W√§rtsil√§, in Trieste, Italy) and a GE LM2500 Gas Turbine. Zuiderdam was the first Holland America Line ship to use a CODAG propulsion arrangement, a GE LM2500 turbine or ABB Azipod propulsors. It is propelled by two 17.62 MW, 160 rpm synchronous freshwater-cooled ABB Azipod propulsors. Past Zuiderdams The first vessel with the \\"Zuider\\" prefix launched in 1912 as the 5,211-ton cargo ship Zuiderdijk; at the time, \\"dijk\\" or \\"dyk\\" was the suffix used for cargo vessels, \\"dam\\" was used for passenger ships. She sailed between Rotterdam and Savannah, Georgia, for Holland America through 1922 as well as during World War I as a transport. The second NASM ship to have the name prefix \\"Zuider\\", and the first to be whole \\"Zuiderdam\\", was launched from a shipyard in Rotterdam for outfitting in 1941. However, on 28 August 1941, she was damaged by a British air raid. The ensuing blaze was fought for at least two days with sergeant W. Ollesch from the German Fire Regiment \\"Sachsen\\" killed while fighting the fire aboard the ship on 30 August 1941. The Germans raised her hull and re-floated her by 25 July 1942 only to be scuttled in order to block the port of Rotterdam to Allied forces by 22 September 1944. She was raised a final time after World War II, but the ship was never completed.

Roosevelt. Background Lucy Page Mercer was born on April 26th, 1891, in Washington, D.C., to Carroll Mercer, (1857‚Äì1917), a member of Theodore Roosevelt's \\"Rough Riders\\" cavalry military unit in the campaigns in Cuba, on the south shore of the island near Santiago during the brief Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in 1898, and Minna Leigh (Minnie) Tunis, (1863‚Äì1947), an independent woman of \\"Bohemian\\" exotic, free-spirited tastes. Lucy had one sister, Violetta Carroll Mercer (1889‚Äì1947). Though they were both from wealthy, well-connected families, Mercer's parents lost their fortune through the Financial Panic of 1893 and subsequent great recession/depression which curtailed their lavish spending. The pair separated shortly after Lucy's birth, and Carroll became an alcoholic. Minnie then raised the girls alone. Affair with Franklin D. Roosevelt As a young woman, Lucy Mercer worked in a dress shop. In 1914, Mercer was hired by Eleanor Roosevelt to become her social secretary. She quickly became an established part of the Roosevelt household, and good friends with Eleanor. According to historians Joseph Persico and Hazel Rowley, the affair between Mercer and Franklin likely began in 1916, when Eleanor and the children were vacationing at Campobello Island to avoid the summer heat, while Franklin remained in Washington, D.C. In 1917, Franklin often included Mercer in his summer yachting parties, which Eleanor usually declined to attend. In June 1917, Mercer quit or was fired from her job with Eleanor and enlisted in the US Navy, which was then mobilizing for World War I. Franklin was at that time the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, and Mercer was assigned to his office. Mercer and Franklin continued to see one another privately, causing widespread gossip in Washington. Alice Roosevelt Longworth‚Äîdaughter of Theodore Roosevelt, and a cousin of Eleanor's‚Äîencouraged the affair, inviting Mercer and Franklin to dinner together several times. She later commented, \\"He deserved a good time. ... He was married to Eleanor.\\" In 1918, Franklin went on a trip to Europe to inspect naval facilities for the war. When he returned in September, sick with pneumonia in both lungs, Eleanor discovered a packet of love letters from Mercer in his suitcase. Eleanor subsequently offered her husband a divorce. Franklin's mother, Sara Delano Roosevelt, was adamantly against the idea of divorce, however, as it would mark the end of Franklin's political career, she stated that she would cut him off from the family fortune if he chose separation. Historians have also debated whether, as a Roman Catholic, Mercer would have been willing to marry a divorced man. Eleanor Roosevelt biographer Blanche Wiesen Cook expressed skepticism that this had been a serious obstacle, noting the depth of Mercer's feelings. Persico also doubts that this was a factor, observing that Mercer's mother Minnie had divorced and remarried, and that the family had come to Roman Catholicism only recently. In the end, Franklin appears to have told Mercer disingenuously that Eleanor was not willing to grant a divorce. He and Eleanor remained married, and he pledged never to see Mercer again. The Roosevelts' son James later described the state of the marriage after the incident as \\"an armed truce that endured until the day he died\\". Eleanor later wrote, \\"I have the memory of an elephant. I can forgive, but never forget.\\" The incident marked a turning point in her life; disillusioned with her marriage, she became active in public life, and focused increasingly on her social work rather than her role as a wife. Marriage and continued contact with Roosevelt Mercer left Washington after the affair and became the governess for the children of Winthrop Rutherfurd, (1862‚Äì1944), a wealthy New York socialite. Winthrop Rutherfurd was famous for winning the heart of socialite/heiress Consuelo Vanderbilt, (1877‚Äì1964), back in 1896, only to see her social-climbing mother instead force her into marriage with Charles Spencer-Churchill, 9th Duke of Marlborough, (1871‚Äì1934), (cousin to later British prime minister Winston Churchill). Now in his fifties, Rutherfurd was considered one of society's most eligible widowers. About a year and half later, on February 11, 1920, Mercer became his second wife. Franklin Roosevelt learned of the marriage by overhearing news of it at a party. The Rutherfurds had one child, Barbara Mercer Rutherfurd (June 14, 1922‚ÄìNovember 6, 2005), who married Robert Winthrop \\"Bobby\\" Knowles, Jr. in 1946. Despite Franklin's promise to Eleanor, he kept in contact with Lucy Rutherfurd after her marriage, corresponding with her by letter throughout the 1920s. Historian/author Persico speculates that these letters may have been the cause of the 1927 nervous breakdown of Franklin's long-time unmarried first secretary Marguerite \\"Missy\\" LeHand, (1898‚Äì1944), as LeHand was also reputedly in love with Roosevelt and no medical cause for her breakdown was found. In 1926, Roosevelt mailed Rutherfurd a copy of his first public lecture after his 1921 paralytic illness, privately dedicating it to her with an inscription. At his first memorable presidential inauguration on March 4, 1933, Roosevelt made arrangements for Rutherfurd to attend and witness his swearing-in. When her husband later suffered a stroke, she contacted Roosevelt to arrange for him to be cared for at well-regarded Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C. Historian/author Doris Kearns Goodwin speculated that an entry in the White House ushers diary for August 1, 1941 included a code name for Lucy Rutherfurd, suggesting that she attended a private dinner with the president then. After her husband's death in 1944, when the two began seeing each other more occasionally, Rutherfurd also arranged for her friend Elizabeth Shoumatoff, (1888‚Äì1980), a well-known artist, to paint Roosevelt's portrait. Winthrop Rutherfurd died in March 1944 after a long illness. Rutherfurd continued to meet more frequently with Roosevelt in the months that followed. In June 1944, Franklin requested of his daughter Anna, who was then managing some White House social functions and acting as hostess, that she help him arrange to meet Rutherfurd without Eleanor's knowledge. Aware of Rutherfurd's role in her parents' early marriage, Anna was at first angry that her father had put her in such a difficult position. However, she ultimately relented and set up a meeting in Georgetown. To her surprise, Anna found that she liked Rutherfurd immediately, and the pair became friends. There were supposedly several dinners in the White House's second floor private quarters during Roosevelt's last year which were attended by Rutherfurd in a group with Anna's presence and obvious acceptance. When Eleanor discovered, shortly after Franklin's death, from some female cousins, of Anna's role in arranging these meetings, the relationship between Eleanor and Anna became strained and cool for some time.http://www.gwu.edu/~erpapers/teachinger/glossary/halstead- anna.cfm In early April 1945, Anna arranged for Rutherfurd to come over from her South Carolina estate in Aiken to meet her father at his \\"Little White House\\" in Warm Springs, Georgia, the small plain rustic cottage built at the polio therapy center by the heated mineral water springs resort that Roosevelt helped develop beginning in the 1920s. Rutherfurd and Shoumatoff along with two female cousins were sitting there as the artist worked on her painting of Roosevelt as he sat at a card table by the living room stone fireplace, fine- tuning a future speech and reading over some other papers on the early afternoon of April 12, 1945. In this quiet domestic scene as the two had just been smiling at each other, Roosevelt suddenly placed his hand up on his forehead and temple, saying \\"I have a terrific headache\\", then slumped over losing consciousness. Later his two doctors - called in soon after the event - said he suffered a fatal cerebral hemorrhage. Since a thorough medical exam a year before, he had received increasingly more intensive care and concern from a young recently recruited private physician. The two women, Mercer and Shoumatoff, immediately packed and left the cottage. Eleanor nonetheless soon later learned the truth from the cousins and felt doubly betrayed to learn of her daughter's role in the long-time deception. Finding Shoumatoff's unfinished preliminary watercolor among Franklin's possessions some time later however, she mailed it to Rutherfurd, to which Rutherfurd responded with a warm letter of thanks and condolences. In 1947, Rutherfurd's sister Violetta committed suicide after her husband requested a divorce, and only a month later on Christmas Day 1947, her mother Minnie died at age 84. Just 7 months later, Rutherfurd herself died from leukemia at the young age of 57, on July 31, 1948, just 3-1/4 years after FDR, having destroyed almost all of her correspondence with Franklin. Rutherfurd is buried along with her husband in Green Township, New Jersey. Public revelation of affair Following Roosevelt's death, his administration concealed from the press the fact that Rutherfurd had been present during his death, fearing the scandal that would ensue. Shoumatoff's presence became known, and she gave a press conference to address questions, but managed to hide Rutherfurd's role and was even not mentioned in early post-war biographies and administration histories for almost two decades. Roosevelt's second private secretary Grace Tully, (1900‚Äì1984), who had also been at Warm Springs at the time of his death, did briefly mention Rutherfurd's presence in \\"F.D.R., My Boss\\", her 1949 memoir, but gave no further hint of the relationship. Though it was reported several times in Eleanor's lifetime that Roosevelt had had a serious affair with an unnamed Catholic woman, this remained only a rumor for decades. The Mercer‚ÄìRoosevelt affair became wider public knowledge in 1966, when revealed in \\"The Time Between the Wars\\", a memoir of the decades 1920s and 1930s, written by Jonathan W. Daniels, (1902‚Äì1981), a former Roosevelt aide from 1943 to 1945. When the news of the memoir's contents broke, Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jr., (1914‚Äì1988), said that he had no knowledge of an affair between Rutherfurd and his father,\\"Kin Deny Account of F.D.R. Romance,\\" The New York Times, 13 August 1966, while Rutherfurd's daughter Barbara flatly denied that any such romance had occurred. Well-known historian/author Arthur Schlesinger Jr., (1917‚Äì2007), stated of the affair that if Rutherfurd \\"in any way helped Franklin Roosevelt sustain the frightful burdens of leadership in the second world war, the nation has good reason to be grateful to her\\". Popular culture Mercer's friendship with Franklin Roosevelt is portrayed in the well-regarded TV mini-series Eleanor and Franklin starring Edward Herrmann and Jane Alexander, with Mercer portrayed by actress Linda Kelsey from the 1976 telecast, (a second series was also subsequently broadcast in 1977 entitled Eleanor and Franklin: The White House Years with flash-backs to earlier episodes) and based on the earlier best-selling biography of the same name by Eleanor's personal friend Joseph P. Lash in 1971. In addition, the relationship was covered in a documentary film in XX - FDR for \\"The Presidents\\" series of multi-part video retrospectives for the American Experience series on American history and biography on the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), and in the 2014 documentary film, also televised for the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), The Roosevelts, directed by noted documentary film-maker Ken Burns, with an accompanying companion pictorial book by Geoffrey Perrett.

Founded in 1988, the organization works in 12 countries around the world. History =Background= Elizabeth Glaser (n√©e Elizabeth Meyer) (November 11, 1947 ‚Äì December 3, 1994) was an American AIDS activist and child advocate. She was married to actor and director Paul Michael Glaser. Glaser contracted HIV in 1981 during the early stages of the AIDS epidemic after receiving a transfusion of contaminated blood while giving birth to her daughter Ariel. Glaser unknowingly passed the virus to Ariel and to her son Jake, who was born three years later. The virus went undetected in all three family members until they underwent HIV testing in 1985, at which time Ariel began suffering from a series of unexplained illnesses. Ariel had developed advanced AIDS at a time when the medical community knew very little about the disease, and there were no available treatment options particularly for children. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved AZT in 1987 as a drug that could extend the lives of AIDS patients, but this approval only extended to adults. Although the Glasers fought to have their daughter treated with AZT intravenously, Ariel died from complications of AIDS in 1988. In the aftermath of Ariel's death, and determined to save her son Jake, as well as to give hope to other HIV-positive children, Glaser co-founded the Pediatric AIDS Foundation in 1988 with friends Susan DeLaurentis and Susie Zeegen. Their work raised public awareness about HIV infection in children, and spurred funding for the development of pediatric AIDS drugs as well as research into mother- to-child transmission of HIV. In 1991, Glaser published an autobiography about her family's ordeal. The book was entitled In the Absence of Angels, and it was co-written with author Laura Palmer. An advocate for the elimination of pediatric AIDS, Glaser became known to audiences nationwide when she was a featured speaker at the 1992 Democratic National Convention. During her speech, she criticized the federal government's underfunding of AIDS research and its lack of initiative in addressing the AIDS crisis. Elizabeth and her family also were profiled in a 1991 edition of People. Glaser died in 1994, and the Pediatric AIDS Foundation was renamed the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation in her honor shortly thereafter. =1994 - present= As of December 31, 2009, the Foundation reached the following milestones in its prevention, care, and treatment initiatives: * The Foundation worked in 17 countries and supported more than 4,800 sites. * In 2009, more than 2.3 million women accessed Foundation-supported services for prevention of mother- to-child transmission of HIV. Since the beginning of its global programs, the Foundation has provided more than 9.2 million women with the services to prevent transmission of HIV to their babies. * In six years, the Foundation's care and treatment programs, focused on children and their families, have enrolled more than 923,000 individuals, including nearly 75,000 children. Since enrollment began, more than 482,000 individuals have begun antiretroviral treatment ‚Äî and more than 39,000 are children under the age of 15. Activities EGPAF works to eliminate pediatric AIDS in three ways: * International Programs: Responding to the need for HIV prevention, care, and treatment services, the Foundation works in regions of the world most affected by HIV and AIDS. Working together with governments and partners, Foundation- supported programs provide a range of HIV-related services: counseling, testing, the establishment of prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) programs, and lifelong care and treatment for children and families. * Research: Foundation-funded researchers around the world work to improve HIV prevention, care, and treatment programs; to train the next generation of international pediatric HIV research leaders; and to pursue the development of a pediatric HIV vaccine. * Public Policy and Global Advocacy: The Foundation‚Äôs public policy and global advocacy efforts work to challenge national governments and international organizations to commit the political and financial resources necessary to achieve the elimination of pediatric AIDS. =Grants and awards= The Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation provides several grants and awards to scientists performing research aimed towards the study and eradication of pediatric AIDS.The Elizabeth Glaser Scientist Award is one of the many awards that the foundation offers through a competitive award application process.

Owned and operated by the Community of Christ, formerly the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS), the house of worship was the first temple to be built by adherents of the Latter Day Saint movement. The design mixes the Federal, Greek Revival, and Gothic Revival architectural styles.Chiat, Marilyn, North American Churches, Publishers International, Ltd.: 2004, p. 71. Construction Beginning in 1831, members of the Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints) under the direction of church founder and president Joseph Smith, began to gather in the Kirtland area. In December 1832 Smith reported to have received a revelation that called for the construction of a house of worship, education, and order. On May 6, 1833, Smith reported that he had received a revelation from God, directing members of the church to construct \\"a house ... wholly dedicated unto the Lord for the work of the presidency,\\" \\"dedicated unto the Lord from the foundation thereof, according to the order of the priesthood.\\" Directions were given to build a \\"lower court and a higher court,\\" and a promise given that the Lord's \\"glory shall be there, and [his] presence shall be there.\\" (LDS Doctrine & Covenants RLDS Doctrine and Covenants Section 91:3). This building which would have sat next to the Kirtland Temple was never started, nor the third building which was to be a house for the printing operations of the church. Instead the functions of this office building ended up in the attic of the Kirtland Temple. The date of this document is also in question as it makes reference to the Kirtland Temple which is described in the following section of the Doctrine Covenants and dated June 1, 1833. Construction commenced soon thereafter, quarrying Berea sandstone from the base of Gildersleeve Mountain, and gathering lumber from the surrounding area, particularly from the gravel pits on the other side of Gildersleeve mountain along Hobart Road. Church members donated labor and building materials, including glass and pottery which was ground up into the stucco. The Kirtland Temple was not originally white on the exterior as it is today. The original exterior was a bluish-gray according to Truman Coe, a local minister in the 1830s. The roof is believed to have been red, and the front doors olive green. Presently, only the doors are the original color. The first structure of its kind to be built by the Latter Day Saint movement, the Kirtland Temple is different in purpose from the Nauvoo temple built in the 1840s. It is different in both design and purpose from the temples built by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) portion of the movement in latter years as they embraced and grew from Nauvoo temple theology. The lower inner court is used primarily for various worship services. It has two sets of pulpits, one set on either end, and the pews featured an adjustable design which allowed the audience to face either end. The second floor was designed for education, and was to house a school for church leaders known as the \\"School of Mine Apostles\\" (See School of the Prophets). Use of the third floor alternated use between general academic classes during the day, Church quorum meetings in the evenings, the Kirtland Theological Institution, the School of the Elders (possibly an enlargement of the school of the prophets, and may have been destined to become the school of mine apostles), Church offices, including that of Smith, were also located on the third floor. At the time of construction, none of the ordinances associated with LDS temple worship, such as baptism by proxy, had been instituted. Papyri Fragments, part of the collection Joseph Smith used to translate the Book of Abraham\\"Egyptian Papyri, circa 300 BC‚ÄìAD 50,\\" The Joseph Smith Papers, accessed June 29, 2019, https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper- summary/egyptian-papyri-circa-300-bc-ad-50/6 Truman O. Angell recorded in his journal that about this time Frederick G. Williams, one of President Smith's counselors, came into the temple one day during construction and related the following: > Joseph received the word of the Lord for him to take his two counselors, > Frederick G. Williams and Sidney Rigdon, and come before the Lord and He > would show them the plan or model of the house to be built. We went upon our > knees, called on the Lord, and the building appeared within viewing > distance. I being the first to discover it. Then all of us viewed it > together. After we had taken a good look at the exterior, the building > seemed to come right over us, and the makeup of this hall seemed to coincide > with what I there saw to a minutia. According to Leonard Arrington's economic history of the Latter Day Saint movement, Great Basin Kingdom, the completed temple had cost $40,000. Temples of nearly identical design were planned at about the same time period in Missouri at Temple Lot (in Independence), Far West, and Adam-ondi-Ahman. However, none were built because of the 1838 Mormon War which evicted the members from the state. Many members of the Church were important to the construction of the Kirtland Temple. Of particular note is Artemus Millet. He has been credited by many for providing the method of the exterior wall construction, head mason, creating the mix of the exterior stucco, and as the superintendent of construction for a portion of the work. There is some disagreement as to the question if Millet was baptized before or after his building skills were needed and recommended by Brigham and Joseph Young. Either way, he was baptized by Brigham Young and Confirmed by Joseph Young while in Canada, and Millet came afterwards to help provide methods, labor, and financial support for the building of the Kirtland Temple. Dedication The Kirtland Temple The temple was dedicated in a seven-hour service on March 27, 1836. A reported \\"one thousand persons\\" attended the gathering, which introduced such traditional dedication rites as the Hosanna Shout and singing of W. W. Phelps's hymn \\"The Spirit of God Like a Fire Is Burning.\\" Following a two-and-a-half hour sermon given by church leader Sidney Rigdon, Smith offered a dedicatory prayer that had been prepared by a committee of church leaders,https://byustudies.byu.edu/content/oliver-cowderys-kirtland-ohio- sketch-book Oliver Cowdery's Kirtland, Ohio Sketch Book] as reprinted in BYU Studies 12:4 (1972). [Saturday, March 26, 1836] \\"This day our school did not keep, we prepared for the dedication of the Lord's house. I met in the president's room, pres. J. Smith, jr. S. Rigdon, my brother W. A. Cowdery & Elder W. Parrish, and assisted in writing a prayer for the dedication of the house.\\" which he indicated was given to him by revelation.History of the Church, 2:420. Two other church leaders, Brigham Young and David W. Patten, were reported to have been inspired to speak in tongues following the prayer (). Truman O. Angell recorded in his journal the following account: > When about midway during the prayer, there was a glorious sensation passed > through the house [Kirtland Temple]; and we, having our heads bowed in > prayer, felt a sensation very elevating to the soul. At the close of the > prayer, F. G. Williams being in the upper east stand- -Joseph being in the > speaking stand next below--rose and testified that midway during the prayer > an holy angel came and seated himself in the stand. When the afternoon > meeting assembled, Joseph, feeling very much elated, arose the first thing > and said the personage who had appeared in the morning was the Angel Peter > come to accept the dedication. Angells.com cache at archive.org Visions and miracles On January 21, 1836, before the temple was completed, Smith reported the first of several visions received at the temple. As he and his associates performed a feet washing and anointing ritual, he saw \\"the celestial kingdom of God, and the glory thereof ... [and] the blazing throne of God, whereon was seated the Father and the Son.\\" Smith also reported seeing Adam, Abraham, and three family members, only one of which had previously died; this experience of Smith was canonized by the LDS Church as revelation and published as section 137 of the Doctrine and Covenants for the first time in 1981. Not long after the dedication, several more visions were reported. On April 3, Smith had his scribe, Warren Cowdery,Faulring, Scott H., ed., An American Prophet's Record: The Diaries and Journals of Joseph Smith (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 1987), 156 footnotes write down in his personal journal an account of a spiritual experience Smith and Oliver Cowdery had while praying in the pulpits. In this experience Joseph states that he and Oliver saw Jesus Christ \\"standing upon the breastwork of the pulpit.\\" According to Smith's account, Christ accepted the church's dedication of the temple, and promised blessings according to their obedience. Following the conclusion of this vision of Christ, the account goes on to tell of Smith and Cowdery then receiving visions of Moses, Elias and Elijah. The account in Smith's journal is the only known telling of this occurrence during Smith's lifetime. The LDS Church canonized it as section 110 of their Doctrine and Covenants in 1876. Shifting ownership Smith's time in Kirtland after the temple came into use was limited. In 1837, he became involved with the foundation of a bank known as the Kirtland Safety Society. The failure of this bank was a factor that caused a schism among Latter Day Saints in Kirtland. The dissenters were led by Warren Parrish, Smith's former secretary, and included Martin Harris, one of the Three Witnesses of the Book of Mormon. Parrish's group took control of the temple and other church property. By the beginning of 1838, Smith was forced to flee the state, relocating to Far West, Missouri with hundreds of loyalists. After the Mormons moved west in 1838, the Temple was used by the Western Reserve Teacher's Seminary. Parrish's group dissolved and by 1841 the remaining Latter Day Saints in Kirtland had come back into communion with the main body of the church, which had subsequently relocated to Nauvoo, Illinois. A period of confusion followed the assassination of Smith in 1844 as rival leaders and factions vied for control of the temple. In 1845, the Kirtland Latter Day Saints under the leadership of S. B. Stoddard, Leonard Rich and Jacob Bump organized their own church in opposition to those of Brigham Young, James J. Strang and other leaders. This group later merged with a faction led by William E. McLellin whose president was David Whitmer, one of the Three Witnesses. By 1848, another Latter Day Saint faction led by Hazen Aldrich and James Collin Brewster was organized in Kirtland and maintained control of the temple. This faction also dissolved and most of the members who were in Kirtland eventually joined the Community of Christ (then known as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, adding the word Reorganized to their name in 1872) led by Joseph Smith III. In 1860, a probate court in Ohio sold the Kirtland Temple as a means of paying off some debts owned by Joseph Smith's estate.Roger D. Launius, \\"Joseph Smith III and the Kirtland Temple Suit\\", BYU Studies 25:110‚Äì116 (Summer 1985). Joseph Smith III and Mark Hill Forscutt purchased a quitclaim deed to the temple in 1874. In 1880, the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church, now known as the Community of Christ) began the Kirtland Temple Suit, in an attempt to gain clear legal title to the temple. The court opinion stated that the RLDS Church was the lawful successor of the original church, but ultimately dismissed the case.Kim L. Loving, \\"Ownership of the Kirtland Temple: Legends, Lies, and Misunderstandings\\", Journal of Mormon History (Fall 2004), 1-80. Although the case had no legal bearing, the Community of Christ secured ownership of the temple through adverse possession by at least 1901. The local RLDS congregation met in the building on a regular basis for Sunday worship until the 1950s. Due to preservation concerns, a new church was built across the street (for the congregation) and the temple saw more direct management and funding from the world church. Today, the building is used for approximately 50 to 60 worship services, classes, retreats and other special events throughout the year primarily by various Latter Day Saint denominations. Unlike the later built Nauvoo Temple, the Kirtland Temple was never destroyed or burned down. The same stones from the original construction are still in place today. Although the majority of church members left the Kirtland area for Missouri in 1838, the Kirtland Temple was never completely abandoned by the church. From its inception to the present day it has always been in the possession of members of the original and schismatic Latter Day Saint movements. It has been a place of worship and a symbol of the movement since it was dedicated in 1836. E. Cecil McGavin says the temple was used as a barn for their animals. \\"The ... beneficiaries of the Mormon exodus from Ohio did not need a house of worship as large as the temple, so they used it as a barn. They made a sloping driveway into the basement, using that large room as a shelter for the milch cows of the community during the winter months\\", \\"while they filled the ground floor room with sheep\\"E. Cecil McGavin. The Nauvoo Temple. Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1986. Present day The Kirtland Temple was used as the meetinghouse for Kirtland's RLDS congregation until the 1950s, when a modern church was built across the street. Today, the temple is usually experienced through guided tours, community services, and prearranged meetings for out-of-town groups. Each year tens of thousands take tours of the temple.Laurie Williams Sowby (September 5, 2009). Kirtland's history interwoven with the Restoration. Church News published by Deseret News Publishing Corporation. Last accessed January 27, 2009. Temple guides are typically local residents, usually but not always members of the Community of Christ. During the busy summer months, college-aged adults augment the Temple's staff as part of the Alma Blair Internship Program. Throughout the year, other volunteers travel to the temple for stints as guides, maintenance staff, or gardeners. There are about 50 worship services and/or educational events held each year at the Kirtland Temple. The Temple holds community services for Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve, and Holy Week, as well as the annual Emma Smith hymn festival in June. Additionally, members of various Latter Day Saint denominations travel to the temple where they are permitted to hold their own services with prior arrangement. A Spiritual Formation and Visitors' Center was opened in March 2007. The center's exterior is inspired by that of the Kirtland Temple, and its layout has been described as reflecting a dove. It enhances the ministries of the temple by providing classroom space, worship space, a multi-use theater, offices, and a small museum. The museum contains artifacts related to the temple and original documents from the Kirtland era. There is also a museum gift shop which features a broad selection of books on Latter Day Saint history and the various expressions of the movement. A historic cemetery and gardens are located outside the temple. Footnotes Further reading * Truman O.

The game was produced using Macromedia Flash (now Adobe Flash) and was an early influential example of the escape the room genre.For lots of gamers, escapism means starting out in a trap, Toronto Star, January 20, 2008 There are 20 levels of varying length, some consisting of a single room and others consisting of a large network of rooms. Though advertised as a constant work-in-progress with \\"new levels coming soon,\\" MOTAS has not been updated since May 2008. The game is currently available in 15 languages, including English, French, German, Japanese, and both traditional Chinese and simplified Chinese. There is also a moderated chat room available for players to discuss the game. The levels have been noted for their jazz soundtrack, especially the Christmas-themed Level 8 and its jazz representation of \\"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town\\". Levels 9 and 13 play a MIDI version of The Way You Look Tonight. Gameplay As with most games of this genre, the player interacts with the environment within the game by pointing at and clicking the elements within the game's environment in order to solve the game's puzzles, with many of them exhibiting a high technology and science fiction influence. The environment may be \\"searched\\" by clicking at various spots within the game's environments to uncover hidden items; for example, in the first room, the player has to retrieve a hidden key under the bed's pillow. Retrieved items can then be used to interact with elements within the environment to solve puzzles. A player uses retrieved items by clicking on it in their inventory (shown on the upper left corner), and then clicking on the element within the environment to interact with the element using the selected item. Taking the key from the previous example, a player can click on it when it is in their inventory, and then click on the cupboard's door again to open the cupboard using the retrieved key. If the item is not meant for the element, then nothing happens. Again using the key as an example: if the player tries to use the key on the door instead of the cupboard, nothing happens and the door remains locked. Often, solving one part of the puzzle will reveal items, codes (passwords), or pathways that in turn that help solve another part of the puzzle. The aforementioned cupboard, for example, yields a screwdriver, and the screwdriver is used to unscrew the painting, which yields a screw in return, and so on. The player must often apply lateral thinking when trying to find uses for the items retrieved in order to solve the puzzles. Codes can be in a variety of formats, usually involving simple number sequences but can also be as complex as involving colours, directions and binary; these must be entered into the appropriate elements inside the game's environment correctly in order to advance through the game. Some of the puzzles may be presented as a single element within the game's environment itself, rather than involving multiple items and elements within the game's environment; these are usually presented in the form of locks preventing access to other elements or pathways. For example, in one of the rooms on the tenth level, the player must unlock a safe by solving a circular, colourful pie chart-like puzzle, through interaction with the elements of the puzzle itself. Many elements within the game, such as many pieces of furniture and some of the puzzles themselves, can be interacted without using any additional items. For example, unlocked doors can be opened simply by clicking on them, and some chairs can be moved around by clicking on them. As the game advances, the gameplay itself steadily evolves at the same time, the levels and puzzles gradually becoming more complex and multi- layered. Levels begin taking place over multiple rooms at once and eventually ventures into an outside world beyond locked buildings. In later levels, the player acquires a device called the Manipulator of Time and Space (MOTAS) device, which takes the player back to previous levels via time travel in order to retrieve items; the player then returns to the current level to solve the puzzles using the items retrieved. Plot Unique among many games of this genre, MOTAS features a plot that changes and evolves as the player advances through the course of the game. MOTAS begins in a relatively formulaic fashion; as is the convention in escape the room games, the player awakens in a bedroom that is locked from the outside with no memory of prior events. As the game progresses, the player discovers several elements throughout the game's environment that suggest the player is a clone, such as a letter left on a table in one of the rooms on the seventh level regarding an escaped clone, and a manual about cloning left on a table in the eleventh level, which leaves the player wondering about their existence afterwards. There are also subtle hints throughout the game suggesting that the player may be an alien, such as at the end of level eight the player puts on what is described as an \\"Alien Suit\\". Depictions of aliens can also be found throughout the game: for example, on the ninth level the player sees the dead body of an alien lying outside a crashed UFO in the first room. Both possibilities are most strongly hinted at on the sixteenth level. On that level, an encrypted mission report, written by an unknown group of persons aboard an \\"artificial moon\\" and left on a computer to be discovered and decrypted by the player, mentions clones being trained in a \\"Logic Training facility\\" on the artificial moon along with the discovery of a planet that is named by the writers as \\"Terra Prime\\", and is reported as being called Earth by its inhabitants. This strongly suggests that the writers may be extraterrestrial aliens; the report also mentions hostilities from the inhabitants of the planet after the writers' presence in the Solar System was uncovered, and of the measures taken against it by the writers of the report, including the creation of a clone to \\"hopefully save the planet\\"; this clone is hinted at the end of the report as being the player. One plot suggestion has been dismissed though: on the eighth level of the game, a figure in a pink alien suit was shown apparently following the player by exiting one of the two doors inside a room after the player has left the level; this figure was revealed in the seventeenth level to be merely the player themselves, the pink colour explained as the result of an accident while attempting to hide behind the door. The version of the player in the pink suit had travelled from the future using the MOTAS device; the item also helps serve to further the game's metafictional elements. Other elements that serve as plot suggestions include a book named after the game itself, various notes left behind by persons unknown throughout the game (with one reading \\"No unauthorised time travel\\"), and the use of portals and teleportation devices to advance between some levels of the game. Development MOTAS was created in November 2001. At that time MOTAS was hosted on a free web server and the game featured only one room (level). In February 2002, a counter was added. As of May 2008, MOTAS has 20 levels plus the guestbook/end level. At several points, the game became so popular that bandwidth became a problem, and so the game was moved to another web host. Reception Mystery of Time and Space is considered to be a highly significant escape the room adventure that helped propel the genre to significance as a subset of online games. It has been referenced in other adventure games, such as the similarly alien-themed Cybee's Adventure, in which a \\"MOTAS Deluxe box\\" appears as an item.JammJamm.de - Flash Games & Entertainment The credits of the seminal escape the room adventure Crimson Room name MOTAS as an inspiration.Fasco-Cs > Crimson Room Channel 4 has commented on the game, describing it as \\"a treat\\" with \\"intricate problems\\", although it also criticized the game for the obscurity and difficulty of its puzzles.4Games: Game Review: The Mystery of Time and Space Nytimes.com mentioned MOTAS in its article \\"GAME THEORY; A Little Getaway: Small, Simple, Fast and Fun\\".https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE6DB1730F933A25755C0A9629C8B63 June 10, 2004 MOTAS is also mentioned in an article on TheStar.com: \\"For lots of gamers, escapism means starting out in a trap - 'Room escape' games, with their endless variations, are booming\\".

Their work helped bring Indonesia back from dire economic conditions and the brink of famine in the mid-1960s. They were appointed in the early stages of the New Order administration.Tom McCawley, \\"Economic upside - and downside.\\" Asia Times Online. 28 January 2008. Almost three decades of economic growth followed. Their efforts also began long-term U.S.-Indonesian strategic cooperation, which was important during the Cold War. The group included Widjojo Nitisastro, Mohammad Sadli, Emil Salim, Subroto, and Ali Wardhana. Origins of the group In the mid-1950s, the economists who would become the Berkeley Mafia were students at the Faculty of Economics at the University of Indonesia (FEUI). The faculty was headed by Sumitro Djojohadikusumo, an economist who had served as Minister of Trade and Industry and Minister of Finance for the Government. Sumitro, being the only teacher with an economics doctorate, had to turn to foreign lecturers from the Netherlands and lecturers from other faculties to assist in educating the students at FEUI. As tensions grew between Indonesia and the Dutch Government over West Irian (now known as West Papua), Dutch lecturers began to leave the country. Sumitro turned to the Ford Foundation for assistance. The Ford Foundation then began a process where students from the FEUI were chosen to undertake overseas studies at the University of California, Berkeley. After the Ford Foundation conducted some preliminary preparations, the overseas studies program began in 1957. By the early 1960s, all of the students who had been sent abroad had returned from Berkeley and had begun taking up positions as lecturers at the Army Staff and Command College (SESKOAD). In 1966, General Suharto took over executive control in Indonesia from president Sukarno by virtue of Supersemar. Although he would not formally become president for another two years, Suharto began laying down the foundations for what would become the New Order regime. In late August 1966, Suharto held a seminar at SESKOAD to discuss political and economic matters and the way in which the New Order would approach these problems. The FEUI economists, headed by Widjojo Nitisastro, attended the seminar. During the seminar the economists set out their ideas and policy recommendations. The presentation impressed Suharto, who invited them to begin work as a team of experts in the field of economics and finance.  Accomplishments and controversies  On October 3, 1966, on the advice of these economists and others, Suharto announced a program aimed at stabilization and rehabilitation of Indonesia's economy. At the end of the Sukarno era, Indonesia's inflation rate touched a four-digit number and there was rapidly growing debt.William Pesek, '‚ÄòBerkeley Mafia‚Äô Now Has $514 Billion at Stake', . BusinessWeek. Accessed February 4, 2010. Things deteriorated in this way because the government under Sukarno spent so much money building expensive monuments, nationalizing industry, and financing the budget deficit with foreign loans and by borrowing from the Indonesian central bank (in effect, printing money). The Berkeley Mafia aimed to tackle the problem with more cautious economic policies with an emphasis on some deregulation, bringing inflation under control, and balancing the budget. The program also aimed at rehabilitation of infrastructure and development of the agricultural sector. At the same time, an international program to support economic recovery was established under the auspices of a newly-formed Inter- Governmental Group on Indonesia. The new economic program was successful at stabilizing the economy. Inflation fell from 650% in 1966 to only 13% in 1969. After Suharto became president in 1968, the members of the Berkeley Mafia team were appointed to ministerial and senior advisory posts in Suharto's cabinet. Thus, the group had a great influence on economic policy; they then successfully brought Indonesia's economy into an unprecedented growth period. The growth rate was high, averaging around 6.5% per year between the late 1960s and 1997, when South East Asia was hit by the severe Asian financial crisis. The Berkeley Mafia's liberal approach towards economics was not supported by all. Within the New Order they encountered opposition from generals such as Ali Murtopo, Ibnu Sutowo and Ali Sadikin, whose economic approaches were more nationalistic in nature. Some other groups, like the Indonesian branch of Hizb ut-Tahrir, considered the Berkeley Mafia to be traitors - a view stemming particularly from their willingness to privatise the nation's industries.Mafia Berkeley: Pengkhianat!. Hizbut-Tahrir Indonesia. Accessed Februari 4, 2011. With the beginning of the oil boom in the mid-70s, Suharto favored the economic nationalists and as a result, the Berkeley Mafia's influence was restricted. Suharto would turn to the Berkeley Mafia again in the mid-1980s, when the price of oil began to drop and with it, Indonesia's economic growth. The Berkeley Mafia presided over the liberalization, deregulation and as a result, renewed growth of the Indonesian economy. Once again, the Indonesian economy began to grow and once again, the Berkeley Mafia encountered political opposition. This time their opponents were Sudharmono and Ginandjar Kartasasmita, who advocated economic nationalism, as well as BJ Habibie, who wanted a technology-centered economic development. As on the previous occasion, Suharto sided with the economic nationalists and the Berkeley Mafia's power weakened. During Indonesia's economic collapse due to the Asian financial crisis in 1997, people blamed the Berkeley Mafia and considered them as part of the New Order regime. In the reform period, only Widjojo was retained in the government. Berkeley Mafia during the post-Suharto era Out of the Berkeley Mafia group, only Widjojo continued to have a significant influence within government during the post- Suharto Reform era, by becoming an economic advisor to presidents B. J. Habibie, Wahid (Gus Dur), and Megawati. Mohammad Sadli remained well known as a senior economic commentator until his death in 2008. Emil Salim continued to be active on environmental issues, both within Indonesia and in international circles.

The story centers around a corrupt summoner and his interactions with the Devil. It is preceded by The Wife of Bath's Tale and followed by The Summoner's Tale.  Plot summary  On the way to extort money from a widow, the Summoner encounters a yeoman who is dressed in Lincoln green, a costume worn by outlaws and poachers. The two men swear brotherhood to each other and exchange the secrets of their respective trades, the Summoner recounting his various sins in a boastful manner. The yeoman reveals that he is actually a demon, to which the Summoner expresses minimal surprise‚Äîhe enquires as to various aspects of hell and the forms that demons take. Each makes a vow with the other to take whatever is offered to them and share it between them. During their travels, they come upon a carter whose horses have become temporarily stuck. Frustrated, he says that the devil may take them. Hearing this, the Summoner asks the demon why he isn't holding him to his word and seizing the horses; he replies that the man does not truly mean what he says‚Äîthat it is not his \\"entente\\" (intent)‚Äîand therefore he cannot take them. They proceed to the house of the widow. The Summoner claims he will do better than the demon and fabricates a court summons in order that the widow will have to bribe him to dismiss the case. He also demands she give him a new pan in payment for an old debt, falsely claiming he paid a fine to get her off a charge of adultery. Incensed, the old woman damns the summoner to hell unless he repents of his false charges; the devil confirms her \\"entente\\"; as the Summoner does not have any inclination to repent, the demon takes his body and soul‚Äîas well as the frying pan‚Äîto hell.  Summoner vs. Friar  The tale is a satirical and somewhat bitter attack on the profession of summoner‚Äîan official in ecclesiastical courts who summons people to attend‚Äîand in particular The Summoner, one of the other people on the pilgrimage. Unlike the Miller and the Reeve who tell tales that irritate the other and do not get on for that reason, the Friar and the Summoner seem to have a longstanding hatred between them. The Friar is of one of the mendicant orders which traveled about preaching and making their livings by begging. Part of the animosity between the two characters may be due to these orders of friars, which had been formed relatively recently, interfering with the work of the summoners. Once a friar had taken confession and given absolution to someone they could not be charged in an ecclesiastical court with the same sin. The Friar's tale has no clear original source like many of Chaucer's tales but it is of a type which is common and always seems popular: \\"the corrupt official gets their comeuppance\\". The tale itself continues in the denigration of summoners with its vivid description of the work of a summoner. This includes bribery, corruption, extortion and a network of pimps and wenches acting as informants making this important clerical office seem more like a 14th-century protection racket. The Friar then says that luckily friars are not under summoners' jurisdiction but the Summoner snaps back that neither are women in , meaning brothels; which were licensed to operate by archdeacons.\\"Geoffrey Chaucer.\\" British Writers Retrospective Supplement II. Ed. Jay Parini. Charles Scribner's Sons, 2002, p. 33-50. Indeed the Friar in the Prologue seems to be more worldly than was acceptable: he would rather go out on a hunt than stay in a monastery; for that matter he cares little about a poor widow who gives her last penny to him instead of feeding her starving child; Chaucer ironically remarks that the Friar is in the \\"business\\" of seeing unmarried women [mistress without marriage] linked to men {See the comment about above). In other words the Friar and the Summoner are hypocritcal competitors in the same \\"rackets\\" [extortion and prostitution] See also *Chaucer's special manuscript words  References   External links  *\\"The Friar's Tale\\" - a plain-English retelling for non-scholars.

The signatories were Interim President David G. Burnet for Texas and Santa Anna for Mexico. Texas intended the agreements to provide a conclusion of hostilities between the two armies and to offer the first steps toward the official recognition of Texas's independence from Mexico. Santa Anna had been captured by Texans following the Battle of San Jacinto. Many Texans wanted Santa Anna to be hanged (\\"a just vengeance\\"), bur Sam Houston saved his life and extracted a promise from Santa Anna that Mexican troops would be removed from Texas. Santa Anna persuaded Burnet that if he was allowed to return to Mexico City, he would argue for the independence of Texas. Santa Anna signed both a public agreement and the secret treaty, but neither was ratified as a treaty by the Mexican government because he had signed the documents under duress while a prisoner. Santa Anna later said, \\"I did promise to try to get a hearing for the Texas Commissioners, but this in itself did not bind the government to receive them.\\" The Mexican Congress considered Santa Anna's actions scandalous and nullified both. Mexican conservatives removed Santa Anna as president and installed Anastasio Bustamante, and there was agreement with the Mexican Congress that Santa Anna had \\"offered nothing in the name of the nation.\\"Christiansen, Carol and Thomas. The U.S.-Mexican War. Companion to the PBS Series The U.S.-Mexican War, 1846-1848. San Francisco: Bay Books 1998, pp. 26-28. A biographer of Santa Anna, Will Fowler, considered that the \\"general of tricks was at his most ingenious\\" with the negotiations with the Texas since he did not commit himself to do anything other than to permit Texas commissioners to present their case to the Mexican government. His negotiations were with the premise that he was a captive, \\"no longer in a position to act freely, and anything he said or signed would not be validated by Congress\\" since as a captive, he was no longer president. A draft of the agreement, which Santa Anna refused to sign until it was amended, stated that he recognized as \\"Head of the Mexican Nation\\" Texas's independence, text that was later dropped. Santa Anna sent a message to General Vicente Filisola to retreat below the Rio Grande, but his message made it clear that Filisola was in charge. Fowler argues that Filisola should have known that Santa Anna was in no position to be issuing orders since he had been captured. Both Filisola and Santa Anna were blamed for the defeat, but signing the documents at Velasco did not commit either Santa Anna or Mexico to Texas independence.Fowler, Will. Santa Anna of Mexico. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press 2007, pp. 176-77.

Polk in his justifications for war some ten years later, as US Representative Abraham Lincoln pointed out in 1848.A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774 - 1875 Lincoln's efforts earned the freshman Whig US representative the derisive sobriquet \\"Spotty\\" Lincoln because of his Spot Resolutions that demanded to know that the \\"spot\\" at which American troops were killed was on American soil, which Polk argued to justify war with Mexico. Text of Public Agreement This is the text of the Public Agreement:Treaties of Velasco =Untitled preamble= Articles of an agreement entered into between his Excellency David G. Burnet President of the Republic of Texas of the one part & His Excellency General Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana President General in Chief of the other part-- =Article 1= General Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna agrees that he will not take up arms, nor will he exercise his influence to cause them to be taken up against the people of Texas, during the present war of Independence. =Article 2= All hostilities between the Mexican and Texan troops will cease immediately both on land and water. =Article 3= The Mexican troops will evacuate the Territory of Texas, passing to the other side of the Rio Grande del Norte. =Article 4= The Mexican Army in its retreat shall not take the property of any person without his consent and just indemnification, using only such articles as may be necessary for its subsistence, in cases when the owner may not be present, and remitting to the commander of the army of Texas or to the commissioner to be appointed for the adjustment of such matters, an account of the value of the property consumed--the place where taken, and the name of the owner, if it can be ascertained. =Article 5= That all private property including cattle, horses, negro slaves or indentured persons of whatever denomination, that may have been captured by any portion of the Mexican army or may have taken refuge in the said army since the commencement of the late invasion, shall be restored to the Commander of the Texian army, or to such other persons as may be appointed by the Government of Texas to receive them. =Article 6= The troops of both armies will refrain from coming into contact with each other, and to this end the Commander of the army of Texas will be careful not to approach within a shorter distance of the Mexican army than five leagues. =Article 7= The Mexican army shall not make any other delay on its march, than that which is necessary to take up their hospitals, baggage [---] and to cross the rivers--any delay not necessary to these purposes to be considered an infraction of this agreement. =Article 8= By express to be immediately dispatched, this agreement shall be sent to General Filisola and to General T.

Text of Secret Treaty This is the text of the Secret Treaty:Treaties of Velasco Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, General in Chief of the Army of Operations and President of the Republic of Mexico, before the Government established in Texas, solemnly pledges himself to fulfill the stipulations contained in the following Articles, so far as concerns himself. =Article 1= He will not take up arms nor cause them to be taken up against the People of Texas during the present War of Independence. =Article 2= He will give his Orders that in the shortest time the Mexican Troops may leave the Territory of Texas [sic]. =Article 3= He will so prepare matters in the Cabinet of Mexico that the Mission that may be sent thither by the Government of Texas, may be well received, and that by means of negociations all differences may be settled and the Independence that has been declared by the Convention may be acknowledged. =Article 4= A treaty of Commerce, Amity and limits will be established between Mexico and Texas. The territory of the latter not to extend beyond the Rio Bravo del Norte. Nonratification by Mexico Although Mexican General Vicente Filisola began troop withdrawals on May 26, 1836 the government of Mexican President Jos√© Justo Corro in Mexico City resolved on May 20 to disassociate itself from all undertakings by Santa Anna while he was held captive. Mexico's position was that Santa Anna had no legal standing with the Mexican government to agree to those terms or to negotiate a treaty. Santa Anna's position was that he had signed the documents under coercion as a prisoner, not as a surrendering general in accordance with the laws of war. In fact, he had no authority under the Mexican Constitution to make a treaty, and the agreements were never ratified by the Mexican government.de la Teja, Jes√∫s. \\"Texas Secession\\" in Encyclopedia of Mexico. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, 1495-96. Santa Anna's return to Veracruz Santa Anna was not allowed to return to Veracruz until 1837. He was kept as a prisoner of war (\\"clapped in irons for six months,\\" he later claimed) in Velasco and then in the Orozimbo Plantation, before he was taken to Washington, DC to meet with US President Andrew Jackson, ostensibly to negotiate a lasting peace between Mexico and Texas, with the US acting as mediator. Sailing on the frigate USS Pioneer, the \\"guest\\" of the US Navy, he did not arrive in Veracruz until February 23, 1837. Aftermath Because the provisions of the public agreements had not been met, the terms of the secret agreement were not released until much later. Neither the de facto independence of Texas nor its later annexation by the United States was formally recognized by Mexico until the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which ended the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and recognized the Rio Grande (R√≠o Bravo del Norte) as the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border.

The ZIP Code is 93001, and the community is inside area code 805. On January 10, 2005, a major landslide occurred in La Conchita. The 2005 landslide killed 10 people, and destroyed or damaged dozens of houses. The landslide recurred on part of a previous landslide in 1995. History La Conchita from the air, looking northeast; the landslides into the town are visible on the extreme right \\"La Conchita\\", Spanish for little conch shell, was first used as the name of a spur on the Southern Pacific railroad line in the 1880s and it was a name generally used to describe a broader area than the present day village. During this time until 1923, the small beach settlement was named \\"Punta\\" and the street names still carried today (San Fernando, Ojai, Bakersfield, Carpinteria, etc.) commemorated the home town areas of the railroad workers who settled in the town while building the Southern Pacific line. The name change and designated area then known as La Conchita are crucially important to any understanding of the region today and its geologic history. Up through the 1930s as historically documented, the area from Bates Road down to Mussel Shoals (then known as Mussel Rock) was referred to as La Conchita. =1817-1912= Prior to the establishment of the village of Punta, the coastal area was named Punta Gorda. \\"Punta Gorda\\", Spanish for massive point, referred to the outstanding feature of this coastal area, a large rock promontory. A monk who stopped at the Mission San Buenaventura in 1817 first mentioned the site. The history of the hamlet of La Conchita is closely tied to developments in the Rincon Point area. The name \\"The Rincon\\" was also routinely used to designate the area from Carpinteria's Rincon Point to Ventura's Sea Cliff. From 1850 until 1873 when Ventura County was established, Punta Gorda was part of Santa Barbara County. What is now the community of La Conchita was originally part of the Mexican land grant Rancho El Rincon given by Governor Jos√© Figueroa to Teodoro Arrellanes in 1835. Arrellanes‚Äô daughter Maria married Dr. Matthew Biggs, and the property was transferred to Biggs in 1855. During the 1860s following a long period of drought, the record rainfall of 1868 produced major flooding throughout the county. It was during this time that major portions of the old ranchos were subdivided and sold off by heirs to an increasing number of arriving immigrants and settlers. The Homestead Act of 1862 had brought many newcomers to settle in California. Levi Gould Stanchfield, born in Leeds, Maine in 1841, established a ranch at Punta Gorda in 1875 where he raised sheep, grew lima beans and built a ranch house at Mussel Rock. Stanchfield was married to Luisa Arenas. Her father, Luis Arenas, held several land grants, and in 1838 was Mayor of Los Angeles. Her mother Josepfa Palomares was the sister of Ygnacio Palomares one of the first settlers of the San Gabriel Valley. Stanchfield sold the property to Charles. E. Ablett in 1879. Ablett, born in England, was well known as a druggist in Santa Barbara and a key figure in the homesteading activity of the Punta Gorda area from the 1880s on. At this time, the La Conchita section of the Southern Pacific railroad coast route was almost completed and the village of Punta was established. Among the founding families of Punta were the Callis from Kentucky; the Mullins from Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada; and the Gaynors from Ireland. Members of these families were prominent in local history for the next sixty years. From 1880-1916 a U.S. post office was sited in Punta, and Punta Gorda served as a stop for both the stagecoach and the railroad. Charles E. Ablett served as the first postmaster. In 1883 the Rincon School district was established and classes were first held in the home of Robert Callis with nine pupils in attendance. The 1883 census listed 17 children living in Punta. In 1890 the name was changed to the Punta Gorda School District, and the first school structure was built in the village. The Ventura County Register of 1890, as well as the Rincon district electoral records from 1900‚Äì1916, reflects a varied mix of ethnicities among the residents in Punta and the Rincon area. A right of way was granted to the Southern Pacific railroad in 1887 and narrow ledges were blasted for the tracks. Since there was no room for a wagon road after that, the idea of building a series of wooden causeway around the cliffs was first developed in 1910. The idea was taken from the European models that existed at the time in Monte Carlo. The \\"causeway,\\" a timber pile trestle with a roadway, was built as part of the Rincon Sea Level Road, a cooperative project between Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties. By 1912, Rincon Road became part of the state highway system. In 1926, it was replaced with cement concrete pavement. Farming remained the predominant occupation of the area through the First World War. It was a precarious way of life, since there was little fresh water available. During the severe drought of 1898, news accounts detailed the record number of livestock being driven north to pasture and to early market as well as the constant drilling efforts for sources of artesian water to ease the plight of the farmers. Oil leasing, which started in the area as early as the 1850s, became increasingly important. The Punta Gorda Land & Oil Company was established in 1900. The Rincon Oil Field, adjacent to the town on the south, was discovered in 1927. =1913-1926= Dr. C.E. Bates was an English doctor drawn to the California gold rush. He later practiced medicine in Santa Barbara. His son, Robert W. Bates, returned from military service in Europe during World War I and worked the ranch along with his brother Edward. A parcel map of La Conchita was first recorded in the 1920s. At that time it was primarily occupied by workers in the nearby oil fields. Robert Bates and Andrew Bailard purchased land in La Conchita in hopes of finding oil in the area. (Andrew Bailard had purchased of land in Carpinteria in 1868). This enterprise was to fail financially. As noted in the memoirs of Edward Bates, from 1910 until the late 1920s the beach area of the Rincon was viewed as more of a liability than an asset. Unsuccessful drilling for water also began in earnest at this time. Edward C. Ramelli, bought land that had a resort hotel called the Mussel Rock Inn and property in La Conchita at the water's edge in 1923. His brother Milton was a civil engineer and surveyor. He laid out the first nineteen homes and called it La Conchita del Mar.Reynolds, Christopher (August 22, 1991) \\"The Town at the End of The Tunnel\\" Los Angeles Times The following May, Milton Ramelli laid out 327 more lots on a dozen streets on the uphill side of the railroad tracks.\\"MAP OF LA CONCHITA DEL MAR NO. 2.\\" 12 MR 31. Ventura County Recorder Retrieved November 21, 2013 from CountyView GIS. La Conchita del Mar was promoted as an affordable seaside paradise with lots available starting at $200, which included oil rights. It was called a \\"beach with a future.\\" Milton Ramelli also subdivided the 66-lot community of Mussel Shoals in 1924 on land owned by the Hickey Brothers. Ten years later he also developed Solimar Beach on leased land. =1927-1959= On March 11, 1931, famed German film director F.W. Murnau suffered a severe head injury in a single-car accident on the highway near Rincon Beach. He was taken to a hospital in Santa Barbara where he died the next day. Successful oil drilling off of Mussel Rock began in 1927. Oil workers leased rental property in La Conchita. A mild interest in beach property began to grow in the early 1930s. However, despite oil fields producing in Sea Cliff and elsewhere on the Rincon, no oil was discovered in La Conchita. The fresh water promised to all lots never materialized either. For many years La Conchita remained a small and quiet community. Many people who had purchased property here initially built summer homes right on the beach, drawn to the serenity and the unspoiled beauty of the beach, ocean and the view. The La Conchita Story project used oral histories and memories of a residents of the community from 1928 on. Eleanor Gallardo Ramey was born in La Conchita in 1928 in the house built by her father Joseph Gallardo a year earlier. The Gallardo homestead still stands on Sunland Avenue, which was then known as Ventura Avenue. Joseph Gallardo, a native of Mexico, worked for the railroad as a watchman and Eleanor has vivid memories, as well as photographs, of all the years she attended the Punta Gorda (one room) Schoolhouse in La Conchita. Pete Richardson came to La Conchita in 1928 when he was two years old. His father Harry Richardson was an oil worker who dug the first oil well in Mussel Shoals (then known as Mussel Rock). At that time, Richardson remembers his family as having the only \\"real house in La Conchita\\", an adobe, whose foundation can still be found just south of town. Dick Talaugon's father Federico Talaugon leased a large house from the Gaynor family on the site of the current Phillips oil storage facility. The family moved there in the winter of 1932 and were part of a growing Pacific Islander community working the farms and ranches of the major landowners of the region. Here Talaugon farmed lima beans and barley. Both Pete Richardson and Dick Talaugon attended Punta Gorda School, the one-room schoolhouse in La Conchita. The school was moved in the mid-1950s to Santa Clara Street in Ventura and used as a kindergarten. Prior to demolition of the building, part was salvaged and moved to its present location in La Conchita at 6746 Ojai Street. Remnants of the concrete foundation can still be found just west of town near the avocado orchard across from Carpinteria Street. By 1930 there were a dozen or so families living in small cottages at the foot of the hill. Lima beans grew on either side of the community and the community sloped down to the shore broken only by the railroad tracks and the old Rincon Highway. For 25¬¢ per five-gallon jug, the Matilja Water Company delivered water to La Conchita residents. A reliable source of water came to the area with the construction of Casitas Dam that was completed in 1959. In 1931 Rudy Scheidman and Frank Regamey purchased the Mussel Rock Inn on the beach side of the railroad track at Mussel Shoals. It once had a glass-enclosed dance floor over the water, eventually lost to the winter surf and attracted such Hollywood celebrities as Marie Dressler, Warner Oland and opera singer Lotte Lehmann. When the highway was widened to three lanes in 1935, the restaurant had to be moved to the beach at La Conchita and was renamed as Frank and Rudy's. It closed in 1942. In 1949 the Highway was widened to four lanes with outer edges of the seawall protected by a riprap seawall of boulders weighing up to brought by rail from Riverside County. In the early 1950s the La Conchita cottages on the beach were either relocated or demolished when the highway was widened after the state acquired additional property. During the 1950s and 1960s La Conchita became a popular vacation destination for many families in the San Fernando Valley. Mobile homes and small beach cottages started popping up in the small lots, and as the town became more popular, larger custom homes. In 1956-7, Richland Oil Company constructed an artificial island, now known as Rincon Island, for oil drilling off Mussel Shoals. =1960-2005= View of the main 2005 landslide, from the air, just offshore. Prior to 2005 the houses formed a straight line along the base of the hill. 1967- Phillips Petroleum Company proposed its processing plant on previously zoned for homes. 1971- Highway 101 completed 1975- La Conchita Ranch Co. started to farm the plateau, a marine terrace above the community, for citrus and avocado. 1985- Seaside Banana Gardens established in La Conchita Until its forced closure in 1998, after the financial impact of the 1995 mudslide led to it losing its lease,Loree, Brenda (February 10, 1998) \\"Yes, La Conchita Has No Banana Gardens\\" Los Angeles Times the Seaside Banana Gardens operated by Doug Richardson (and his partner Paul Turner) were a leading attraction in La Conchita. The Gardens were featured in both national and international publications. Although it was widely assumed that bananas could not be commercially grown in California, the garden cultivated over 50 exotic varieties in the unusual microclimate of the area. 1986- Internationally recognized Artist Roger Brown moves to La Conchita. Roger Brown (1941‚Äì1997) lived primarily in La Conchita from the late 1980s until his untimely death in 1997. The community and its environment inspired many of the artist's paintings during the last decade of his life. Brown was a member of the class- action lawsuit filed against La Conchita Ranch as a result of the 1995 mudslide, and some of his works depict the cataclysmic events of that day rendered in his signature style. His works are in major museums and private collections throughout the country. The artist's estate and collections are maintained at the Roger Brown Study Collection at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.http://www.artic.edu/saic/art/brown/rbsc/index.html 1992- renowned Chicago architect Stanley Tigerman Architect, (b. 1930- ) completes the studio home of artist Roger Brown (1941‚Äì1997) on Ojai Street. The pink adobe home has become a significant landmark in La Conchita. Brown had fought for more than two years to get the design of this studio through the Ventura County Planning Commission and even commemorated his frustrations with the Commission in a now famous painting. 1995- first major mudslide affecting the village of La Conchita. 2004- Roger Brown residence purchased by ER Nurse Bill Harbison. 1.5 months later the 2005 landslide occurred, during which he was responsible for two live rescues, for which he was awarded the Medal of Valor by the Ventura County Fire Department and the State of California. =2005-present= Damaged buildings are surrounded by mud in La Conchita. FEMA photo, 01-15-2005. Damaged and destroyed vehicles line the side of the road in La Conchita. FEMA photo, 01-15-2005. 2005- On January 10, 2005, the 2005 La Conchita Landslide took the lives of ten La Conchita residents. On Jan. 15, 2005 the residents formed the La Conchita Community Organization (LCCO).La Conchita Community Organization website Accessed 6 November 2013 The LCCO has worked with Local, State and the Federal Government officials to resolve the landslide situation that has affected the community since 1995. In March 2006 Governor Schwarzenegger announced the allocation of $667,000 for a \\"comprehensive study to examine how to ensure the safety of the beachside community.\\" The contract to the consulting firm was signed in April 2007 and a \\"draft\\" report was received at the beginning of 2009. In 2008 plaintiffs representing family members of those killed and residents who lost property in the 2005 La Conchita mudslide successfully settled a lawsuit filed against the La Conchita Ranch. The Ranch was found partly negligent and settled. The assets of the ranch plus a cash settlement were turned over to the plaintiffs. (See:\\"Firm to Settle Suit Over Deadly La Conchita Slide \\"Los Angeles Times, California Section, Sept.9, 2008) among other California papers. The ranch has since been purchased and La Conchita residents are working with the new owners to coordinate the efforts for the future safety of all residents. The plaintiffs also sued the County of Ventura for damages arising out on the 2005 landslide. Plaintiffs claimed that the wall that the County built at the base of the landslide caused or contributed to their damages. At trial, the County prevailed against the plaintiffs on all claims. Plaintiffs appealed, but the Court of Appeal ruled in favor of the County. It found that warnings the County gave of the dangers of living in La Conchita were \\"sufficient to advise any reasonable person to stay away from La Conchita...\\" As of 2015, La Conchita remains an active community of about 300 residents, despite warnings of a continuing risk of further slides. Proposals have been made to improve the safety of the area by grading the hill, at an estimated cost of $50 million, as well as an alternative proposal for the government to buy up and empty the town through eminent domain, but neither alternative has gone forward.Covarrubias, Amanda (January 3, 2015) \\"10 years after fatal mudslide, tiny La Conchita accepts the risks\\" Los Angeles Times Geography The entire town consists of two streets parallel to the shore, with ten short perpendicular streets, ending at the base of Rincon Mountain. La Conchita is at 119.448 degrees west longitude and 34.364 degrees north latitude, on a southwesterly-facing portion of the coast. The town is called \\"Punta\\" on USGS topographic maps. It is between Rincon Point to the northwest and Mussel Shoals to the southeast; Rincon Mountain rises sharply to the northeast. The nearest incorporated town is Carpinteria, about to the northwest.  Landslides  The village of La Conchita is along a portion of the coast prone to mudslides, and sits beneath a geologically unstable formation. In 1909, a devastating mudslide occurred approximately one-half mile north of the town, and in 2005 slides closed Highway 101 in both directions, trapping residents. USGS Image of debris flow from 1995 Landslide Sandwiched between a steep, unstable hillside (with the La Conchita Ranch Company situated on the plateau directly over the community), and the Pacific Ocean, La Conchita has been the site of recent major mudslides: *On March 4, 1995 at 2:03pm, a mudslide buried or damaged seven homes, injuring no one. After the main failure, the weather forecast predicted more rain for the following week. *On March 10, 1995, a debris flow occurred in the canyon west of the March 4 slide, damaging four or five more residences and a banana plantation. *On January 10, 2005 at 12:30pm, a massive mudslide buried four blocks of the town in over of earth. Ten people were killed by the slide and 14 were injured. Of the 166 homes in the community, fifteen were destroyed and sixteen more were tagged by the county as uninhabitable. La Conchita Ranch Co. was sued by those affected by the 2005 landslide. A settlement was reached, giving the plaintiffs the company's assets and $5 million.

The genus is rare and needs much more research. Some taxonomists group snub-nosed monkeys together with the genus Pygathrix. Snub-nosed monkeys live in Asia, with a range covering southern China (especially Tibet, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou) extending into the northern parts of Myanmar and Vietnam. These monkeys get their name from the short stump of a nose on their round faces, with nostrils arranged forward. They have relatively multicolored and long fur, particularly at the shoulders and backs. They grow to a length of 51 to 83 cm with a tail of 55 to 97 cm. Snub-nosed monkeys inhabit mountain forests up to elevations of more than 4,000 m. In the winter they move into the deeply secluded regions. Higher elevation areas are more remote and difficult for humans to access and utilize and other studies have found less deforestation, more reforestation and afforestation, less range contraction, and less extinction in topographically steep areas. All Rhinopithecus species inhabit primary forest and grid cells with tree cover ‚â• 75% might constitute important potential habitat. They spend the majority of their life in the trees. They live together in very large groups of up to 600 members, splitting up into smaller groups in times of food-scarcity, such as in the winter. Groups consist of many more males than females. They have territorial instincts, defending their territory mostly with shouts. They have a large vocal repertoire, calling sometimes solo while at other times together in choir-like fashion. The diet of these animals consists mainly of tree needles, bamboo buds, fruits and leaves. A multi- chambered stomach helps them with digesting their food. The impulse for mating starts with the female. She takes up eye contact with the male and runs away a short bit, then flashes her genitals. If the male shows interest (which does not always occur), he joins the female and they mate. The 200-day gestation period ends with a single birth in late spring or early summer. Young animals become fully mature in about six to seven years. Zoologists know little about their lifespan.

The cave was the main objective of the Atea 1978 expedition, a highly organised Australian- led expedition with 50 members from five countries, and was then surveyed at over 30 km in length and 143m in depth, at that time classified as the longest cave in the southern hemisphere. The cave has a variety of interesting features, including several very large breakdown chambers, a lengthy and impressive main riverway, and an exceptionally large number of secondary systems and smaller passages. Since 1978, there have been a small number of subsequent visits, extending the depth of the cave to 350m and the length to 34.5 km.

The station is located underground on two levels, below the site of a former mainline terminus. It is the busiest station in Liverpool, though considerably smaller than Lime Street station, the mainline terminus, and the busiest station to operate fully the Merseyrail network. The station is the busiest underground station outside London serving 40,000 people daily. The station in passengers per platform is the busiest underground railway station in the United Kingdom at 5,217,547 per platform per annum and laying third in all stations, underground or overground.http://orr.gov.uk/statistics/published-stats/station-usage- estimates Liverpool Central is one of nine stations on the Merseyrail network to incorporate automatic ticket gates. The main concourse is part of a shopping centre, and includes a closed subway link to the former Lewis's department store.  History  =High Level terminal station= The original station, which was a large, above-ground terminal station, opened on 2 March 1874, at the end of the Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC) line to Manchester Central. It replaced Brunswick station as the CLC's Liverpool terminus, becoming the headquarters of the committee. The three-storey building fronted Ranelagh Street in the city centre, with a high, arched iron and glass train shed behind. There were six platforms within the station, offering journeys to Manchester Central (in 45 minutes, making the route the quickest and most direct between Liverpool and Manchester), London St. Pancras, Hull, Harwich, , and an alternative London route to that of the Midland Railway, terminating at London Marylebone. Until the nationalisation of Britain's railways, the station was always busy, but as with many other stations in the UK, it was closed under the Beeching Axe, as the routes served could be taken from nearby . In 1966, most services on the CLC route were diverted to Lime Street via the Hunts Cross chord, leaving only a dozen urban commuter trains per day to and from . These final services were withdrawn on 17 April 1972, with a promise to reinstate the Gateacre route when the Merseyrail network was completed in 1978. The High Level station was demolished in 1973, having served a short time as a car park, although some former station buildings remained while work was in progress on rebuilding the underground station in the mid-1970s. The area of the train shed now forms the centre of the stalled Central Village development. =Underground urban station= A 1909 Railway Clearing House Junction Diagram showing railways in the vicinity of Liverpool Central ‚Äì Low Level station (Mersey Railway) in purple; High Level station (Cheshire Lines) in orange Liverpool Central Low Level underground terminal station opened on 11 January 1892, at the end of the Mersey Railway's route, via the Mersey Railway Tunnel from Birkenhead, when the route was extended from James Street station. The Mersey Railway platforms were underground, accessed from stairs within the High Level station and situated in roughly the same position as the escalators accessing the Northern Line today. The Mersey Railway tunnel entering Central Low Level from the north of the station was aligned with the High Level station's approach tunnel from the south. This was to ensure minimum engineering work if ever the two tunnels were to be linked up‚Äîas did occur in the 1970s. =Merseyrail= The Merseyrail network was created in the 1970s by merging separate railways into one integrated network. Central underground station would service the Northern and Wirral Lines. A new loop tunnel was built in Liverpool city centre for Wirral Line trains, linking James Street station with Moorfields, Lime Street and Liverpool Central stations, and returning to James Street. A new deep-level underground platform was built at Liverpool Central as part of this loop tunnel. The former CLC route was taken underground connecting to the underground Mersey Railway platforms. Another new tunnel, the Link Tunnel, allowed trains to continue northwards via to the approach lines to Liverpool Exchange, creating one long line from Hunts Cross to Southport. Liverpool Exchange terminal station was closed in 1977; this route became the Northern Line. The rebuilt underground station was opened by British Rail in the same year. In the original 1970s Merseyrail plan, southbound trains would have continued to Warrington and Manchester; however, services terminated at Garston, then later extended to . Simultaneously, works to allow the Northern Line to be connected to the Victoria Tunnel, called the Edge Hill Spur, to connect the eastern section of the city to the city centre underground section were undertaken, then later abandoned. Trains would have operated from Central station to the east of the city and out to St Helens. =2012 refurbishment= It was announced in September 2011 that, through a ¬£40 million investment from Network Rail, Liverpool Central was to have a major refurbishment programme to improve the concourse and platforms. Works included new lighting, flooring, new toilet facilities and new escalators to the Northern Line platforms. The entire station closed for refurbishment on 23 April 2012. The station partly reopened on 25 August 2012, with the refurbishment of the main concourse and Wirral Line platform completed. The station fully reopened on 22 October 2012 with the work on the Northern Line platforms completed.Northern Line Reopening  Facilities  Liverpool Central sign A street-level travel centre opened in November 2009, replacing the former ticket office and newsagents; this sells tickets, newspapers, food and drink. There are also toilets, cash machines, free Wifi and food-vending machines. Escalators and lifts lead to the two Northern Line platforms and the deep-level Wirral Line platform. There are cycle racks for 30 cycles and secure storage for 16 cycles.  Future The Liverpool City Region Long Term Rail Strategy document, produced by Merseytravel in 2014, states that it hopes to re-open the Wapping Tunnel to allow Liverpool Central to connect with Edge Hill and beyond. Merseytravel commissioned a feasibility study into a new rail link between Central and Edge Hill, which was completed in May 2016. The report found that the Wapping Tunnel was in good condition‚Äîthough suffering from flooding in places and requiring some remedial work‚Äîand that the concept of re-opening the tunnel was viable. Plans were developed in 2006 to build a shopping complex on the site of the car park behind the former High Level station (bounded by the rear of the station, Cropper Street, Newington and Bold Street). Known as Central Village, it was to consist of a high-rise tower for residential and business use, retail outlets, bars and restaurants and was also to have a canal running the length of Bold Street. Development of the site was troubled, with delays caused by parties involved going into receivership and potential tenants pulling out. In September 2017, new owner Augur announced plans to develop the site while leaving space for the expansion of the station, potentially seeing new platforms built. Augur stated it had discussed its plans with Network Rail and Liverpool City Council, and hoped to have planning permission submitted during 2018. Network Rail was scheduled to install an extra lift giving access to the Northern Line platforms in 2016/17. No work had begun by the end of 2016; the Transport Minister, Paul Maynard, confirmed that owing to funding issues, work would not start until 2019 at the earliest. The Liverpool Echo published an article in October 2018 which claimed that unless the station was redeveloped to increase capacity it would be facing restrictions on passenger movement. Merseyrail managing director Andy Heath suggested that by the mid 2020s passengers could end up having to queue upstairs as the platforms would have insufficient capacity. Merseyrail chairman Cllr Liam Robinson stated that, due to the potential size of the works, Merseytravel were in discussions with the government over their plans to expand the station. Plans could include a new concourse and new platforms as well as making use of a previously constructed but unused tunnel portal to the east of the underground station.  Services  The Northern Line platforms Wirral Line platform Both lines on the Merseyrail network, the Northern Line and the Wirral Line, serve the station. On the Northern Line, off-peak service level is as follows: * 4 trains per hour to * 4 trains per hour to * 4 trains per hour to * 4 trains per hour to via During late evenings, frequencies are reduced to 2 trains per hour on the Kirkby and Ormskirk branches; the Southport and Hunts Cross service retains 4 trains per hour until end of service. Sunday services reflect the evening service, but the service from Southport to Hunts Cross is also reduced to 2 trains per hour on Sundays. Services remain at 4 trains per hour on Sunday during the summer season to Southport. On the Wirral Line, off- peak service level is as follows: * 4 trains per hour to * 4 trains per hour to * 4 trains per hour to * 2 trains per hour to There are also extra services between Liverpool Central and Hooton during peak times. During early hours, late evenings and on Sundays, frequencies are reduced to 2 trains per hour on all branches. These services are all provided by Merseyrail's fleet of Class 507 and Class 508 EMUs. Northern Line Services use platforms 1 and 2 at the station. Usually trains to Kirkby and Hunts Cross depart from platform 1, and trains to Southport and Ormskirk use platform 2, although delays on the trains can cause these to change. All Wirral Line services depart from platform 3.  Northern to Wirral services  Empty Coaching Stock (non-passenger) services have to reverse at Liverpool Central station, when going from Kirkdale Depot to Birkenhead North TMD and vice versa, making use of a single track chord known as the \\"Stock Interchange Line\\" linking Liverpool James Street station (Wirral Line) and Liverpool Central (Northern Line). No passenger services are scheduled to use the link, although it has seen very occasional use by charter trains.\\"Third Rail Centenary Tracker\\"Heyevents 7 February 2016; Retrieved 18 May 2016 This was the route taken by Wirral Line trains between Central L.L & James Street prior to the building of the Link & Loop tunnels in the 1970s.

Altogether, about 200 people were tried. Recent historical interpretation One interpretation of the historical record suggests that she was a resident of Salem Town and thus not the tavern owner. Perhaps she did not know her accusers. This would be supported in her deposition in Salem Village before the authorities stating, \\"I never saw these persons before, nor I never was in this place before.\\" The indictments against her clearly note that she was from \\"Salem\\" which meant Salem Town, as other indictments against residents of Salem Village specified their locations as such.See the indictment against Sarah Good, a resident of Salem Village She was often confused with Sarah Bishop, one of the other accused during the Salem trial.https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/salem- story/june-10-1692/8C649858DE6C4B5FD493F54E2CB1E9D9 Traditional historical interpretation Family Bridget's maiden name appears to have been Mangus or Playfer. She was married three or possibly four times.

She had another daughter from her marriage to Thomas Oliver, Christian Oliver (sometimes spelled Chrestian), born 8 May 1667.Vital Records of the Town of Salem, Volume 1, Births, Salem, MA: Essex Institute. 1916. She was earlier accused of bewitching Thomas Oliver to death, but was acquitted for lack of evidence. Her third marriage c. 1687 was to Edward Bishop, a prosperous sawyer, whose family lived in Beverly. Nature of allegations Bishop was accused of bewitching five young women, Abigail Williams, Ann Putnam, Jr., Mercy Lewis, Mary Walcott, and Elizabeth Hubbard, on the date of her examination by the authorities, April 19 1692. A record was given of her trial by Cotton Mather in \\"The Wonders of the Invisible World.\\" In his book, Mather recorded that several people testified against Bishop, stating that the shape of Bishop would pinch, choke or bite them. The shape also threatened to drown one victim if she did not write her name in a certain book. During the trial, anytime Bishop would look upon one of those supposed to be tortured by her, they would be immediately struck down and only her touch would revive them. More allegations were made during the trial including that of a woman saying that the apparition of Bishop tore her coat, upon further examination her coat was found to be torn in the exact spot. Mather mentions that the truth of these many accusations carried too much suspicion, however. William Stacy, a middle aged man in Salem Town, testified that Bishop had previously made statements to him that other people in the town considered her to be a witch. He confronted her with the allegation that she was using witchcraft to torment him, which she denied. Another local man, Samuel Shattuck, accused Bishop of bewitching his child and also of striking his son with a spade. He also testified that Bishop asked him to dye lace, which apparently was too small to be used on anything but a poppet (doll used in spell-casting). John and William Bly, father and son, testified about finding poppets in Bishop's house and also about their cat that appeared to be bewitched, or poisoned, after a dispute with Bishop. Other victims of Bishop, as recorded by Mather, include Deliverance Hobbs, John Cook, Samuel Gray, Richard Coman, and John Louder. During her sentencing, a jury of women found a third nipple upon Bishop (then considered a sure sign of witchcraft), yet upon a second examination the nipple was not found. In the end Mather states that the biggest thing that condemned Bishop was the gross amount of lying she committed in court. According to Mather, \\"there was little occasion to prove the witchcraft, it being evident and notorious to all beholders.\\" Bishop was sentenced to death and hanged.

A common example is a plant root growing in humid air bending toward a higher relative humidity level. This is of biological significance as it helps to increase efficiency of the plant in its ecosystem. The process of hydrotropism is started by the root cap sensing water and sending a signal to the elongating part of the root. Hydrotropism is difficult to observe in underground roots, since the roots are not readily observable, and root gravitropism is usually more influential than root hydrotropism. Water readily moves in soil and soil water content is constantly changing so any gradients in soil moisture are not stable. Root hydrotropism research has mainly been a laboratory phenomenon for roots grown in humid air rather than soil. Its ecological significance in soil-grown roots is unclear because so little hydrotropism research has examined soil-grown roots. Recent identification of a mutant plant that lacks a hydrotropic response may help to elucidate its role in nature. Hydrotropism may have importance for plants grown in space, where it may allow roots to orient themselves in a microgravity environment. This behavior is thought to have been developed millions of years ago when plants began their journey onto dry land. While this migration led to much easier consumption of CO2, it greatly reduced the amount of water readily available to the plants. Thus, strong evolutionary pressure was put on the ability to find more water. Mechanism Plants recognize water in their environment in order to absorb it for metabolic purposes. The universally used molecules must be sensed and absorbed in order to be used by these organisms. In plants, water can be sensed and is mainly absorbed through the roots, chiefly through young fine roots as compared to mother roots or older fine roots as shown with maize in Varney and Canny‚Äôs research. The direction and rate of growth of these roots towards water are of interest because these affect the efficiency of water acquisition. Scientists have known that the roots‚Äô receptors for most stimulus are housed in cells of the root cap since Darwin‚Äôs 1880 publication of ‚ÄúThe power of movement of plants‚Äù in which he described his gravitropism experiments. Darwin‚Äôs experiments studied Vicia faba seedlings. Seedlings were secured in place with pins, the root caps were cauterized, and their growth was observed. Darwin noted that the cauterized root caps did not grow towards any stimulus. However until very recently, only within the last decade, have scientists found a likely receptor in root caps for signals of water potential gradients. Receptor-like kinases (RLKs) appear to be responsible for this sensing of water potential gradients because of their apt location in the cell membranes of root caps as well as their interactions and effect on a type of aquaporin water channel known as plasma membrane intrinsic protein (PIP). PIPs are also found in the cell membrane and appear to involved in root hydraulic conductivity. Dietrich hypothesizes that a signal of lower water potential likely affects the interaction between the PIPs and RLKs resulting in differential cell elongation and growth due to fluxes in abscisic acid (ABA) and its following pathways. ABA is a biosynthesized phytohormone that is known to be active in many physiological plant cell development pathways. Support for ABA pathways resulting in hydrotropic responses comes from mutant strains of Arabidopsis thaliana that could not biosynthesize/produce ABA. The mutants were found to have decreased hydrotropic responses such that their root growth towards higher water potentials was not significant. After application of ABA, however, heightened responses of root growth towards higher water potentials were observed. Furthermore, we have gathered that cytokinins also play a crucial role. This is interesting because cytokinin works antagonistically with auxin, which is a significant part of the gravitropic response pathway. The cytokinins cause the degradation of the auxin transporting PIN1 proteins, which prevents auxin from accumulating in the desired areas for gravitropic bending. This leads us to believe that hydrotropic response can counteract the gravitropic desire to move toward the center of the Earth and allows root systems to spread toward higher water potentials. This mechanism is supported strongly by the observation of growth patterns of the Arabidopsis abscisic acid mutants (aba1-1 and abi2-1) and no hydrotropic response mutant (nhr1). Abscisic acid mutants were unable to produce abscisic acid, and haphazardly were unable to show any significant response to water pressure gradients. It was not until ABA was artificially added to the mutant that is was able to display any hydrotropic response. Equally interesting, the nhr1 mutant shows increased growth rates of roots in response to gravity, and no response to hydrotropic cues. This may be due to the root system being able to freely respond to gravity, without the antagonistic hydrotropic response. The nhr1 plants would begin to show hydrotropic response only in the presence of kinetin, which is a type of cytokinin. This clearly supports the idea that cytokinins play a big role in hydrotropic response. Despite the great support this mutant provides, the genes responsible for these mutants are unknown. The signal for root growth, in this case, is varying water potential in a plant‚Äôs soil environment; the response is differential growth towards higher water potentials. Plants sense water potential gradients in their root cap and bend in the midsection of the root towards that signal. In this way, plants can identify where to go in order to get water. Other stimuli such as gravity, pressure, and vibrations also help plants choreograph root growth towards water acquisition to adapt to varying amounts of water in a plant‚Äôs soil environment for use in metabolism. Thus far, these interactions between signals have not been studied in great depth, leaving potential for future research. Misconceptions * The greater growth of roots in moist soil zones than in dry soil zones is not usually a result of hydrotropism. Hydrotropism requires a root to bend from a drier to a wetter soil zone. Roots require water to grow so roots that happen to be in moist soil will grow and branch much more than those in dry soil. * Roots cannot sense water inside intact pipes via hydrotropism and break the pipes to obtain the water. * Roots cannot sense water several feet away via hydrotropism and grow toward it. At best hydrotropism probably operates over distances of a couple millimeters‚Ä≥ References * Tropism Auxin action ","title":"Hydrotropism"},{"id":"1384358","text":"Goondiwindi Macquarie Dictionary, Fourth Edition (2005). Melbourne, The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd. is a rural town and locality in the Goondiwindi Region, Queensland, Australia. It is on the border of Queensland and New South Wales. In the , Goondiwindi had a population of 6,355 people. Geography Goondiwindi is on the MacIntyre River in Queensland near the New South Wales border, south west of the Queensland state capital, Brisbane. The town of Boggabilla is to the south-east on the New South Wales side of the border. Most of the area surrounding the town is farmland. History flooding affected the town in 1921 Bigambul (also known as Bigambal, Bigumbil, Pikambul, Pikumbul) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken by the Bigambul people. The Bigambul language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Goondiwindi Regional Council, including the towns of Goondiwindi, Yelarbon and Texas extending north towards Moonie and Millmerran. In the late 1840s, squatters Richard Purvis Marshall and his brother Sampson Yeoval Marshall established the Gundi Windi pastoral station on the McIntyre River. They faced strong Aboriginal resistance for the first few years of their occupancy until Frederick Walker and the Native Police under his command arrived to crush most of the opposition in mid 1849. Richard Purvis Marshall became a Native Police officer in 1850 and was later appointed Commandant of the force in 1855. The name Goondiwindi derives from an Aboriginal word with goondi indicating droppings or dung and windi indicating duck, probably connected with the roosting place on a large rock in the Macintyre River. The name was believed to be first used for a pastoral run in the area. Gundiwindi Post Office opened by 1860. It was renamed Goondiwindi by 1861. Goondiwindi State School opened on 1 September 1864. Goondiwindi was first proclaimed a municipality on 20 October 1888. The town boundaries have not altered to this day, and, before the Federation of Australia in 1901, the town served as a border crossing between Queensland and New South Wales. The customs house from that era is now a museum. Goondiwindi East Provisional School opened on 4 July 1898, becoming Goondiwindi East State School in 1909. The school closed about 1914, reopening again in 1920. It finally closed in 1947. Goondiwindi West Provisional School opened in 1900, becoming Goondiwindi West State School on 1 January 1909. It closed about 1950. Goondiwindi North Provisional School opened in 1901, becoming Goondiwindi North State School on 1 January 1909. It closed due to low student numbers about 1911 but reopened on 24 November 1913 as the Moogoon Road State School. The school closed again due to low student numbers in 1925, but reopened in 1931. It finally closed about 1939. St Mary's Convent and School, 1924 St Mary's Catholic School opened in 1911 operated by the Sisters of Mercy providing for boarding and day students through Years 1 to 7. In 1965, the school added a secondary department to extend the schooling to Year 10 but the secondary department was closed in 1972. The Sisters operated the school until December 1983, after which lay teachers were employed. The Goondiwindi War Memorial was originally located in Herbert Street and was dedicated on 21 September 1922 by the Queensland Governor, Matthew Nathan. The gates were unveiled in April 1949. Goondiwindi State High School opened on 28 January 1964. The most famous resident of Goondiwindi was Gunsynd, a Thoroughbred race horse known as \\"The Goondiwindi Grey\\". Guided by Bill Wehlow, in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Gunsynd had 29 wins including the 1971 Epsom Handicap and the 1972 Cox Plate and came third in the 1972 Melbourne Cup. The name \\"Gunsynd\\" came from Goondiwindi Syndicate (Gun=Goondiwindi, Synd=Syndicate). There is a statue of Gunsynd in the town centre.Gunsynd 'The Goondiwindi Grey' There is also a Gunsynd museum located in the Goondiwindi Regional Civic Centre at 100 Marshall Street. Another school, the Goondiwindi Christian Education Centre, opened in 1991 but closed on 13 December 1996. The Border Rivers Christian College was established in 2015, as a primary and secondary school (P-12) although only P-8 schooling was available in its first year, with Years 9 to 12 classes commencing each successive year. The school commenced using the buildings of the former Goondiwindi Christian Education Centre at 111 Calladoon Street. The current Goondiwindi Public Library building was opened in 2015. In the , Goondiwindi had a population of 6,355 people. Heritage listings Goondiwindi Civic Centre, 2012 Goondiwindi has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Marshall Street: Goondiwindi War Memorial * 100 Marshall Street: Goondiwindi Civic Centre * 1 McLean Street: Customs House Museum * Millmerran Road, Wyaga: Wyaga Homestead Population According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 6,355 people in Goondiwindi . * Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 5.9% of the population. * 83.1% of people were born in Australia and 86.6% of people spoke only English at home. * The most common responses for religion were Anglican 28.9%, Catholic 28.2% and No Religion 15.7%. Climate Transport Marshall Street, circa 1945 The town is a major transport nexus between the southern states and Queensland. The Newell, Leichhardt, Gore, Cunningham, Barwon and Bruxner Highways all merge at Goondiwindi or close by. The town is the administrative centre for the Goondiwindi Region. Goondiwindi is a popular stopping point for interstate travellers, and has several motels and restaurants.Welcome to Goondiwindi & District Goondiwindi Airport is located north of the town off the Cunningham Highway (). Education Goondiwindi State School is a co-educational government primary school (P-6). In 2016, the school had an enrolment of 514 students with 45 teachers (37 full-time equivalent) and 23 non-teaching staff (18 full-time equivalent). The school opened on 1 September 1864 and is one of the oldest primary schools in Queensland. Goondiwindi State High School is a co-educational government secondary school (7-12). In 2016, the school had an enrolment of 526 students with 53 teachers (49 full-time equivalent) with 29 non-teaching staff (20 equivalent). The high school opened on 28 January 1964. St Mary's Parish School is a co-educational Roman Catholic primary and middle school (P-10). In 2017, the school has an enrolment of 395 students. The Border Rivers Christian College is a co-educational non-denominational primary and secondary Christian school. In 2017, the school is moving to purpose-built premises in Lilly Street, which are expected to included boarding facilities. These schools are well-established, have solid community ties, and contribute to the community and surrounding areas. Goondiwindi State High School won the 2006 Showcase award, given to schools which display excellence in all areas. Retailers Goondiwindi has many large retailers including Coles, two hardware stores Home timber and hardware, a Mitre 10 Home & Trade, Betta Home Living, The Reject Shop, Repco and a Foodworks (Goondiwindi Co Op) and Price Busters. Farming Goondiwindi is a centre for agriculture, producing a diverse range of crops and fibres including wool and beef, cotton, sorghum, corn, wheat, barley and chickpeas. Average annual rainfall for this region is . Goondiwindi is well known for its dry season but still lasting in with many crops Attractions War Memorial Park Monument Goondiwindi hosts the Natural Heritage and Water Park. The development of the park was the result of the closure of nearby Boobera Lagoon (approximately 20 km west of Goondiwindi) to power boats in order to better preserve artifacts or evidences of indigenous culture. The Lagoon had been a favourite spot for waterskiing for the local area and was the only suitable waterbody for the purpose. The Goondiwindi Town Council petitioned the Australian Government, which responded (through Environment Australia) by funding the National Heritage & Water Park, to make available skiing and boating facilities and to provide a focal point for tourism and recreation in the town and district. The 210 ha recreational water park opened in early 2004. The purpose built water channel allows water sports such as waterskiing, wakeboarding, canoeing and boating. It is home to a varied bird life; it provides picnic and swimming areas.Goondiwindi Regional Council Remedial work was performed in 2008 to seal leaks, which caused the lagoon to be dry for a period.Report, SMK Consultants pty ltd, to Goondiwindi Regional Council, October 2009 The Goondiwindi Botanic Garden of the Western Woodlands on the western side of the town features 25 hectares of species native to the Upper Darling Basin. It is unique in that plants are displayed in communities merging into each other as occurs in nature. With the first plantings in 1986, many of the upper-storey large trees are approaching maturity, and the focus is now on mid and lower storey plantings. The Garden has an extensive Eremophila collection. Some 22 plant communities feature endemic species such as brigalow (Acacia harpophylla), belah (Casuarina cristata), Chinchilla white gum (Eucalyptus argophloia), ooline (Cadellia pentastylis), ironbark (Eucalyptus sideroxylon) and gidyea (Acacia aneura). The planting program is supported by an on-site propagation facility comprising a glass house, heater- mister unit, large shade house and storage container. Owned and run by the community for the community, the Garden features an island surrounded by a deep lake.

The company was founded in 1982 at Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, Japan as , but changed to its current name sometime in 1984. It is currently owned by Hitoshi Hamada. One of their earliest arcade hits was the 1989 rail shooter Dynamite Duke, one of the first to combine close combat with long-range shooting. A year later, Seibu Kaihatsu became best known for their 1990 vertical-scrolling shoot 'em up arcade game Raiden, which was successful enough to earn several sequels and spin-offs in its series of titles. In 1991, a development department known as was spun off from Seibu Kaihatsu. During the late '80s, Fabtek bought the rights to internationally distribute Seibu Kaihatsu's arcade titles outside Japan. This partnership started with Dead Angle, which was Fabtek's first game to be released, and ended with Raiden Fighters Jet, which was both Fabtek's and Seibu Kaihatsu's last game to be released. In 1999, its arcade division vanished and its official website shut down. It was also rumored that they filed for bankruptcy; in fact, Seibu Kaihatsu temporarily disbanded itself. Therefore, Fabtek's international distribution rights expired while closing its business. During the same year, they established , right before the dissolution of their relationship with adult video game developers h.m.p. and Mink to develop adult mahjong video arcade games. In 2005, the development staff left Seibu Kaihatsu to apply at MOSS, then bought the development rights to the Raiden franchise from Seibu Kaihatsu to develop Raiden III and Raiden IV in order to keep the franchise's fanbase hyped with Seibu Kaihatsu assisting them.

(In early American usage, a brigantine was referred to as a hermaphrodite brig.) Porpoise was later re-rigged as a brig. She was based on the same plans as . Porpoise was authorized by Congress on 30 June 1834; built in 1835; and launched 31 May 1836; Lieutenant William Ramsay in command. Porpoise sailed from Boston, Massachusetts on 25 August 1836, called at various southern ports, and conducted coastal surveying operations under the direction of Lt. Charles Wilkes in the summer of 1837. In October 1837, she hunted pirates along the southern coast, and then resumed her survey work in December. Porpoise, Lt. Cadwalader Ringgold in command, was then assigned to the squadron which Wilkes was to command on an extended exploratory expedition around the world. She stood out of Hampton Roads on 18 August 1838 with the United States Exploring Expedition Squadron. She assisted in the exploration and survey work of the Expedition as it confirmed the existence of the Antarctic Continent, charted vast areas of the South Pacific, circumnavigated the world, and returned to New York four years later. Porpoise underwent overhaul at New York at the end of 1842 and sailed on 8 February 1843 for the west coast of Africa to join the squadron patrolling for slavers. She returned to New York on 19 November 1844. From February 1845-July 1847, Porpoise cruised in the Gulf of Mexico, participating in the Naval operations against Tampico, P√°nuco, and Veracruz during the War with Mexico. Upon return to Norfolk, Virginia, she remained decommissioned until 1 January 1848. During the next three and a half years, she hunted slavers along the west coast of Africa, touching at the U.S. in the spring of 1850. Returning to New York from this extended cruise on 19 December 1851. She again decommissioned on 3 August 1852. Recommissioned in May 1853, she was assigned to North Pacific Exploring and Surveying Expedition under Commander Cadwalader Ringgold, a veteran, like Porpoise, of the Wilkes Expedition. She joined the squadron at Hampton Roads, and with it, stood out to sea on 11 June 1853. Porpoise rounded the Cape of Good Hope, and with the squadron explored and charted many Pacific islands and shoals before arriving in China in March 1854. The squadron put to sea once more to explore in the Bonins, the Ladrones, and the Marianas. Porpoise parted company with the other vessels on 21 September 1854 between Formosa and China, and was never heard from again. It is supposed that she foundered in a heavy typhoon which occurred a few days after her separation from the squadron.

It comprises essays written during a difficult time in Twain's life (1904‚Äì09), when he was deeply in debt and had recently lost his wife and one of his daughters. The content concerns morality and religion and strikes a tone that is sarcastic, Twain's own term throughout the book. Initially, another of his daughters, Clara Clemens, objected to its publication in March 1939, probably because of its controversial and iconoclastic views on religion, claiming it presented a \\"distorted\\" view of her father. Henry Nash Smith helped change her position in 1960. Clara explained her change of heart in 1962 saying that \\"Mark Twain belonged to the world\\" and that public opinion had become more tolerant. She was also influenced to release the papers by her annoyance with Soviet reports that her father's ideas were being suppressed in the United States. The papers were selected, edited and sequenced for the book in 1939 by Bernard DeVoto. Content Letters from the Earth consists of a series of commentaries in essay and short story form. Many of these pieces express Twain's discomfort with and disdain for Christianity, both as a theological position and a lifestyle. The title story consists of eleven letters written by the archangel Satan to archangels Gabriel and Michael, about his observations on the curious proceedings of earthly life and the nature of Man's religions. Other pieces in the book include a morality tale told as a bedtime discussion with Twain's children, Susy and Clara, about a family of cats, and an essay explaining why an anaconda is morally superior to Man. Date of writing Letters from the Earth was written after the deaths of Twain's daughter Suzy (1896) and of his wife Olivia (1904). Textual references make clear that sections, at least, of Letters from the Earth were written shortly before his death in April 1910. (For instance, Letter VII, in discussing the ravages of hookworm, refers to the $1,000,000 gift of John D. Rockefeller Jr. to help eradicate the disease, a gift that was announced on October 28, 1909, less than six months before Twain's death.) However, the following excerpt appears in a discussion of the Palestinian town of Nablous, in The Innocents Abroad. This passage was written more than four decades before his death, in 1867 or 1868 and appears to be an oblique reference to the idea that later became Letters from the Earth: Louis J. Budd, editor of Mark Twain: Collected Tales, Sketches, Speeches, and Essays: Volume 2: 1891‚Äì1910 (1992), a volume in the Library of America series, places Letters from the Earth sequentially in 1909.

First and foremost Tibetan music is religious music, reflecting the profound influence of Tibetan Buddhism on the culture. The new-age 'singing bowl' music marketed in the West as 'Tibetan music' is of 1970s US origin. History The Lama Mani tradition ‚Äì the telling of Buddhist parables through song ‚Äî dates back to the 12th century. The songs were performed by wandering storytellers, who travelled from village to village, drawing on their own often humble origins to relate to people from all backgrounds. Vividly illustrated Buddhist thangka paintings depicted the narrative and helped the audience understand what was essentially a teaching. Tibetan \\"street songs\\" were a traditional form of expression particularly popular as a means of political and other commentary in a country that was previously without newspapers or other means of mass communication. They provided political and social commentary and satire and are a good example of a bardic tradition, akin to that in medieval Europe or, more recently, the role calypsos played in the West Indies. As song lyrics in Tibet usually contained stanzas of 4 lines of 6 syllables each, the lyrics could be easily adapted to almost any melody.Goldstein, Melvyn C. (1982). Lhasa Street Songs: Political and Social Satire in Traditional Tibet. The Tibet Journal. Vol. VII Nos. 1 & 2\\\\. Spring/Summer 1982, pp. 56-66. Secular Tibetan music has been promoted by organizations like the Dalai Lama's Tibetan Institute of Performing Arts. This organization specialized in the lhamo, an operatic style, before branching out into other styles, including dance music like toeshey and nangma. Nangma is especially popular in the karaoke bars of the urban center of Tibet, Lhasa. Another form of popular music is the classical gar style, which is performed at rituals and ceremonies. Lu are a type of songs that feature glottal vibrations and high pitches. There are also epic bards who sing of Tibet's national hero Gesar. Popular and modern Tibetans have a very strong popular-music culture, and are also well represented in Chinese popular culture. Tibetan singers are particularly known for their strong vocal abilities, which many attribute to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. Tseten Dolma (ÊâçÊó¶ÂçìÁéõ) rose to fame in the 1960s for her music- and-dance suite \\"The Earth is Red\\". Kelsang Metok (Ê†ºÊ°ëÊ¢ÖÊúµ) is a popular singer who combines the vocal traditions of Tibet with elements of Chinese, Indian and Western pop. Purba Rgyal (Pubajia or Ëí≤Â∑¥Áî≤) was the 2006 winner of Jiayou Haonaner (), a Chinese reality talent show. In 2006, he starred in Sherwood Hu's Prince of the Himalayas, an adaptation of Shakespeare's Hamlet, set in ancient Tibet and featuring an all-Tibetan cast. In the multi-ethnic provinces of Qinghai and Sichuan, whose Tibetan inhabitants are regarded as part of the \\"Amdo\\" cultural tradition, there is a very strong local scene, mostly exposed through videos on local buses. Amdo stars are among others Sherten (short for Sherab Tendzin) My date with a pop star, TravelBlog 15 March 2007 and Yadong, who both have reached outside the borders of China with their music. The first fusion with Western music was Tibetan Bells, a 1972 release by Nancy Hennings and Henry Wolff. The soundtrack to Kundun, by Philip Glass, has helped to popularize Tibetan music. Foreign styles of popular music have also had a major impact within the Tibetan diaspora, where Indian ghazal and filmi are very popular and American rock has produced the India-based Rangzen Shonu. Within Tibet itself, among rock groups the bilingual Vajara (Tian Chu) sextants are the oldest and most famous act. Since the relaxation of some laws in the 1980s, Tibetan pop, popularised by the likes of Yadong (Tibet), Dadon (now living in the US), Jampa Tsering (Tibet), 3-member group AJIA, 4-member group Gao Yuan Hong, five-member group Gao Yuan Feng, are well known. Gaoyuan Hong in particular has introduced elements of Tibetan language rapping into their singles. Alan Dawa Dolma is the first and currently only artist of Tibetan ethnicity to be active in both Chinese and Japanese music industry. Tibetan dancing Western representations Although it is sometimes stated that 'Tibetan singing bowls' date back to a pre-Buddhist, shamanic Bon-Po tradition, the manufacture and use of bowls specifically for the purpose of 'singing' (as opposed to standing bells/bowls that are intended to be struck) is believed to be a modern and non-Tibetan phenomenon. The historical records and accounts of the music of Tibet are silent about singing bowls. Such bowls are not mentioned by Perceval Landon (a visitor in 1903-1904) in his notes on Tibetan music, nor by any other visitor. Wolff and Hennings' seminal recording Tibetan Bells was followed by the development of a unique style of American singing bowl music often marketed as 'Tibetan music'. This has remained very popular in the US with many recordings being marketed as World music or New- age music since the introduction of those terms in the 1980s. 'Tibetan singing bowls' have as a result become a prominent visual and musical symbol of Tibet, to the extent that the most prevalent modern representation of Tibet within the US is that of bowls played by Americans.

Though lineal succession is now largely abandoned, the offices connected with the practice were those of the President of the Church and the Presiding Patriarch. Priesthood Latter Day Saint scripture teaches that a person may also be called through their lineage, so that they have a legal right to a priesthood office. The Doctrine and Covenants teaches that descendants of Aaron have legal right to the priesthood: \\"And if they be literal descendants of Aaron, they have a legal right to the bishopric, if they are the firstborn among the sons of Aaron.\\"Doctrine and Covenants (LDS Church ed.) 68:16‚Äì21. In a revelation to Joseph Smith, he was promised his lineage would have the priesthood: \\"Therefore, thus saith the Lord unto you, with whom the priesthood hath continued through the lineage of your fathers‚ÄîFor ye are lawful heirs, according to the flesh, and have been hid from the world with Christ in God‚ÄîTherefore your life and the priesthood have remained, and must needs remain through you and your lineage until the restoration of all things spoken by the mouths of all the holy prophets since the world began.\\"Doctrine and Covenants (LDS Church ed.) 86:8-10. One who has the right and calling to hold these positions through lineage must still be ordained by the church hierarchy before officiating in the office. Church President During his lifetime, Joseph Smith was the President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. At the time of Smith's assassination in 1844, most Latter Day Saints agreed that his older brother, Hyrum Smith, would have been Smith's successor, had he not also been assassinated. Another likely successor was Smith's younger brother Samuel, who died less than one month later. A few asserted that the last surviving Smith brother, William, should become church president, and William made that claim for a time and gathered a small faction of followers around him. Many Latter Day Saints believed that a son of Joseph Smith should be the successor to the church presidency. Several prominent leaders asserted that a patriarchal blessing given to Smith's eldest son, Joseph Smith III, designated the boy to succeed his father. However, at the time of his father's death, Joseph III was only 11 years old. As a result, many leaders arose who either argued against lineal succession or suggested that the church would have to wait for Joseph Smith III to mature. The largest group, led by Brigham Young, were proponents of a system whereby the senior member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles would succeed to the church presidency, absent any lineal succession. This system of apostolic succession continues in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).Several relations of Joseph Smith have become President of the LDS Church (Joseph F. Smith, George Albert Smith, Joseph Fielding Smith), but they were appointed to the position by the church's regular apostolic succession and were not given preference based on their ancestry. Other Latter Day Saints living in the Midwest United States continued to support lineal succession and in 1860, they invited Joseph Smith III to become president of what would later be called the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church), known today as Community of Christ. This church continued to appoint presidents who were patrilineal descendants of Joseph Smith until 1996, when President Wallace B. Smith (a great-grandson of the Latter Day Saint founder) designated W. Grant McMurray (who was unrelated to the Smiths) as his successor. Abandonment of lineal succession by the RLDS Church was a factor that caused a schism and foundation of several small Latter Day Saint churches, including the Remnant Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, which accepted Frederick Niels Larsen (a grandson of Frederick M. Smith through his daughter Lois) as its Prophet‚ÄìPresident. Presiding Patriarch Most Latter Day Saints originally believed that the Presiding Patriarch of the church should be transmitted by lineal succession. The first Presiding Patriarch, Joseph Smith, Sr., was the father of the founding prophet. On his death bed, Joseph Sr. appointed his eldest living son, Hyrum Smith, Presiding Patriarch \\"by right\\" of inheritance. When Hyrum was assassinated in 1844, his youngest brother, the apostle William Smith, became Presiding Patriarch. William broke with Brigham Young, President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, who was acting as President of the Church in Nauvoo, Illinois, in part over the office. William asserted that the Presiding Patriarch's title was \\"Patriarch over the Church\\" and Young argued for the less grand \\"Patriarch to the Church.\\" William was later excommunicated by Young's faction, which became the LDS Church. William joined with James J. Strang, a rival claimant for the church presidency. Breaking with the Strangites, William eventually joined his nephew, Joseph Smith III, and the RLDS Church. William petitioned Joseph III to restore him to the office of Presiding Patriarch of the RLDS Church, but the re-appointment never occurred. After William's death, Joseph Smith III reinstituted the office of Presiding Patriarch, appointing his brother Alexander Hale Smith to the office. Thereafter, the office of Presiding Patriarch in the RLDS Church remained within the Smith family and was passed by lineal succession until 1958. In that year, Church President W. Wallace Smith ended the tradition by calling Roy Cheville to be Presiding Patriarch. Today, Presiding Patriarchs of what is now the Community of Christ are known as \\"Presiding Evangelists.\\" After William Smith was excommunicated by Brigham Young, \\"Uncle\\" John Smith (brother of Joseph Smith, Sr.) was appointed by Young to be Presiding Patriarch of the LDS Church. After the death of Uncle John Smith, another John Smith (a son of Hyrum Smith) became Presiding Patriarch of the LDS Church. Thereafter, the majority of the Presiding Patriarchs of the LDS Church were descendants of Hyrum, in keeping with the tradition of lineal succession. The LDS Church ceased to include Presiding Patriarchs in its hierarchy after 1979. Apostleship In the LDS Church, some leaders have regarded the office of apostle as one that may be transmitted by lineal succession, though such a practice has never been formalized in the church. The following father‚Äìson apostle combinations have existed in the LDS Church: *Brigham Young selected and ordained three of his sons to be apostles at relatively young ages: Brigham Young, Jr., (age 29), John Willard Young (age 11), and John Willard Young (age 29). *John Taylor selected and ordained his son John W. Taylor to be an apostle at age 25. *Wilford Woodruff selected and ordained his son Abraham O. Woodruff to be an apostle at age 23. *Joseph F. Smith selected and ordained his sons Hyrum M.

It is the only order in the class Ellioviricetes. The name Bunyavirales derives from Bunyamwera, where the original type species Bunyamwera orthobunyavirus was first discovered. Ellioviricetes is named in honor of late virologist Richard M. Elliott for his early work on bunyaviruses. Bunyaviruses belong to the fifth group of the Baltimore classification system, which includes viruses with a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA genome. They have an enveloped, spherical virion. Though generally found in arthropods or rodents, certain viruses in this order occasionally infect humans. Some of them also infect plants. In addition, there is a group of bunyaviruses whose replication is restricted to arthropods and is known as insect-specific bunyaviruses. A majority of bunyaviruses are vector-borne. With the exception of Hantaviruses and Arenaviruses, all viruses in the Bunyavirales order are transmitted by arthropods (mosquitos, tick, or sandfly). Hantaviruses are transmitted through contact with deer mice feces. Incidence of infection is closely linked to vector activity, for example, mosquito-borne viruses are more common in the summer. Human infections with certain members of Bunyavirales, such as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever orthonairovirus, are associated with high levels of morbidity and mortality, consequently handling of these viruses is done in biosafety level 4 laboratories. They are also the cause of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome. Hantaviruses are another medically important member of the order Bunyvirales. They are found worldwide, and are relatively common in Korea, Scandinavia (including Finland), Russia, western North America and parts of South America. Hantavirus infections are associated with high fever, lung edema, and pulmonary failure. The mortality rate varies significantly depending on the form, being up to 50% in New World hantaviruses (the Americas), up to 15% in Old World hantaviruses (Asia and Europe), and as little as 0.1% in Puumala virus (mostly Scandinavia). The antibody reaction plays an important role in decreasing levels of viremia.  Virology  = Structure = Peribunyavirus virion structure Bunyavirus morphology is somewhat similar to that of the Paramyxoviridae family; Bunyavirales form enveloped, spherical virions with diameters of 80‚Äì120 nm. These viruses contain no matrix proteins. = Genome = Bunyaviruses have tripartite genomes consisting of a large (L), medium (M), and small (S) RNA segment. These RNA segments are single-stranded, and exist in a helical formation within the virion. Besides, they exhibit a pseudo-circular structure due to each segment's complementary ends. The L segment encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, necessary for viral RNA replication and mRNA synthesis. The M segment encodes the viral glycoproteins, which project from the viral surface and aid the virus in attaching to and entering the host cell. The S segment encodes the nucleocapsid protein (N). Most of bunyaviruses have a negative- sense L and M segment. The S segment of the genus Phlebovirus, and both M and S segment of the genus Tospovirus are ambisense. Ambisense means that some of the genes on the RNA strand are negative sense and others are positive sense. The ambisense S segment codes for the viral nucleoprotein (N) in the negative sense and a nonstructural protein (NSs) in the positive sense. The ambisense M segment codes for glycoprotein (GP) in the negative sense and a nonstructural protein (NSm) in the positive sense. The total genome size ranges from 10.5 to 22.7 kbp. = Replication = Nairovirus life cycle. The ambisense genome requires two rounds of transcription to be carried out. First, the negative- sense RNA is transcribed to produce mRNA and a full-length replicative intermediate. From this intermediate, a subgenomic mRNA encoding the small segment nonstructural protein is produced while the polymerase produced following the first round of transcription can now replicate the full-length RNA to produce viral genomes. Bunyaviruses replicate in the cytoplasm, while the viral proteins transit through the ER and Golgi apparatus. Mature virions bud from the Golgi apparatus into vesicles which are transported to the cell surface. = Classification = There are currently 383 virus species recognised in this order, organized into the following 12 families: *Arenaviridae *Cruliviridae *Fimoviridae *Hantaviridae *Leishbuviridae *Mypoviridae *Nairoviridae *Peribunyaviridae *Phasmaviridae *Phenuiviridae *Tospoviridae *Wupedeviridae Plants can host bunyaviruses from the families Tospoviridae and Fimoviridae (e.g. tomato, pigeonpea, melon, wheat, raspberry, redbud, and rose). Members of some families appear to be insect-specific, for example the phasmavirids, first isolated from phantom midges, and since identified in diverse insects including moths, wasps and bees, and other true flies. Diseases in humans Bunyaviruses that cause disease in humans include: * California encephalitis virus, La Crosse encephalitis virus, Jamestown Canyon virus and Snowshoe hare virus vector: mosquitoes Family: Peribunyaviridae * Hantavirus reservoir: small mammals or rodents vector: aerosolized excreta from these mammals Family: Hantaviridae * Crimean‚ÄìCongo hemorrhagic fever reservoir and vector: ticks, amplifying hosts and vector: small mammals, domestic mammals Family Nairoviridae * Rift Valley fever reservoir: bats vector: mosquitoes amplifying hosts: small mammals, domestic mammals Family: Phenuiviridae * Bwamba Fever reservoir: monkeys vector: mosquitoes, amplifying hosts: donkeys Family: Peribunyaviridae * Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome * Lassa fever and Argentine hemorrhagic fever reservoir: rodents vector: aerosolized excreta from these mammals Family: Arenaviridae Bunyaviruses have segmented genomes, making them capable of rapid recombination and increasing the risk of outbreak. The bunyavirus that causes severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome can undergo recombination both by reassortment of genome segments and by intragenic homologous recombination.Lv Q, Zhang H, Tian L, Zhang R, Zhang Z, Li J, Tong Y, Fan H, Carr MJ, Shi W.

The viral incubation period is about 48 hours. Symptomatic infection typically causes non-specific flu-like symptoms with fever lasting for about three days. Because of their non-specific symptoms, Bunyavirus infections are frequently mistaken for other illnesses. For example, Bwamba fever is often mistaken for malaria. Prevention Prevention depends on the reservoir, amplifying hosts and how the viruses are transmitted, i.e. the vector, whether ticks or mosquitoes and which animals are involved. Preventive measures include general hygiene, limiting contact with vector saliva, urine, feces, or bedding. There is no licensed vaccine for bunyaviruses. As precautions Cache Valley virus and Hantavirus research are conducted in BSL-2 (or higher), Rift Valley Fever virus research is conducted in BSL-3 (or higher), Congo-Crimean Hemorrhagic Fever virus research is conducted in BSL-4 laboratories.

It operates according to a principle known as \\"common consent\\" and is presided over by the First Presidency. The functioning of the councils, quorums and orders of the church are also considered an important part of the World Conference.Community of Christ Bylaws, webpage, retrieved June 24, 2006 Delegates to the conference are elected by Mission Center conferences. Motions are often debated vigorously and the results are sometimes close and controversial. World Conferences are traditionally held at Community of Christ World Headquarters, with the legislative and main worship services held in the Auditorium in Independence, Missouri. History World Conferences were originally known as \\"General Conferences.\\" The first General Conference of the church, then known as the Church of Christ, was held on June 9, 1830‚Äîonly two months after its organization. Convened in Fayette, New York, it was presided over by Joseph Smith. The conference included a gathering of the 27 members of the church. Originally held semiannually, or as need arose, the church switched to an annual meeting in the late-nineteenth century. With many members desiring to meet more than once a year, summer gatherings were held, starting in 1883, as reunions (a tradition that continues to this day). In the twentieth century, the church decided to meet biannually. Then, at the 2007 World Conference, it was decided that World Conferences would be held tri- annually. Switching to a conference every three years, instead of every two, was anticipated to be less taxing on church resources, and to provide for greater participation by members who reside abroad. The most recent World Conference was held April 2019. Agenda and format The World Conference Opening Ceremonies traditionally include a ceremony featuring the flags of the nations where the church is organized and often include a welcome address by a featured speaker from another denomination, as well as welcomes by local elected officials. The councils, quorums and orders of the church hold separate meetings during World Conference as do several delegate caucuses. The usual agenda calls for these meetings during weekday mornings, with most of the general legislative sessions of the World Conference in the afternoon. Evening worship services often include a contemporary worship service, an outreach service, and a service in which the President of Community of Christ addresses the church in an important address that sets the agenda and tone, not only for the conference, but for the work of the church in the coming years. A group of communion services are usually held on the Sunday morning of the conference, including a very large and well-coordinated service held in the Auditorium, which is regarded by many as one of the highlights of the World Conference. Worship services feature the Auditorium Organ and the Temple Organ. Organ recitals are typically held during the lunch break following the Daily Prayer for Peace. On occasion, the Community of Christ International Peace Award has been presented during a World Conference. Organization and management The Conference Organization and Procedures Committee normally submits the rules and procedures to be followed at a particular conference.Conference Organization and Procedures Committee, webpage, retrieved June 24, 2006 The conference manager attends to the logistics of the conference while the World Church Secretary serves as the legislative clerk. Voting is by a show of hands, however on close votes when the chair is in doubt, votes are counted by delegation and apportioned based on the relative membership of each mission center/jurisdiction. This rather complex voting procedure is designed to protect the voting rights of international delegations that may not have been able to recruit a full slate of delegates to represent them in the conference. Delegates attend from a majority of the fifty nations where the church is organized. The largest numbers of delegates are from the United States, Canada and French Polynesia. Translators for more than a dozen languages sit overhead the main conference floor and present real time translations of the conference to any of the delegates on the floor who prefer to participate in a language other than English. Numbered lecterns in the conference chamber are available to those who wish to speak. They gain the floor to make motions or speak by submitting a card to a computer attendant at the lectern who enters the request into a queue. In this fashion, the presiding officer is able to call upon speakers with alternating pro and con viewpoints, as well as give preference to priority motions. According to church bylaws Roberts Rules of Order Newly Revised is the parliamentary authority for the conference except where they may be in conflict with the bylaws, adopted rules of order for the conference, and past resolutions. Great deference is normally shown by most delegates to the President of the church in regards to the management of the agenda and debate, however, controversial issues are sometimes brought to the conference, thoughtfully considered from many viewpoints, and may be decided by close or split votes. Main order of business The usual items of business that come before the conference are votes to sustain leadership, approve priesthood calls to major offices, elect the Board of Trustees of Graceland University, elect the World Church Finance Board, set the budget for the church, approve legislative resolutions and set the dates for the next conference. When an inspired document is presented to the church by the prophet-president, its consideration and the decision of whether or not to include it in the Doctrine and Covenants becomes the primary matter of reflection for the body.

A Ku Klux Klan organizer, he planned and directed the murders of James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner, three civil rights activists participating in the Freedom Summer of 1964. He was found guilty in state court of three counts of manslaughter on June 21, 2005, the forty-first anniversary of the crime, and sentenced to 60 years in prison. He appealed the verdict, but the sentence was upheld on April 12, 2007, by the Supreme Court of Mississippi.Killen v. State, 958 So.2d 172 (Miss. 2007). He died in prison on January 11, 2018, six days before his 93rd birthday. Early life Edgar Ray Killen was born in Philadelphia, Mississippi, as the oldest of eight children to Lonie Ray Killen (1901‚Äì1992) and Jetta Killen (n√©e Hitt; 1903‚Äì1983). Killen was a sawmill operator and a part-time minister.Profile, Law2.umkc.edu; accessed April 5, 2015. He was a kleagle, or klavern recruiter and organizer, for the Neshoba and Lauderdale County chapters of the Ku Klux Klan. Murders Mt. Zion Church state history marker During the \\"Freedom Summer\\" of 1964, James Chaney, 21, a young black man from Meridian, Mississippi and Andrew Goodman, 20, and Michael Schwerner, 24, two Jewish men from New York, were murdered in Philadelphia, Mississippi. Killen, along with Cecil Price, then deputy sheriff of Neshoba County, was found to have assembled a group of armed men who conspired against, pursued, and killed the three civil rights workers. Samuel Bowers, who served as the Grand Wizard of the local White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan and had ordered the murders to take place, acknowledged that Killen was \\"the main instigator\\". At the time of the murders, the state of Mississippi made little effort to prosecute the guilty parties. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), under pro-civil-rights President Lyndon B. Johnson and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, conducted a vigorous investigation. A federal prosecutor, John Doar, circumventing dismissals by federal judges, convened a grand jury in December 1964. In November 1965 Solicitor General Thurgood Marshall appeared before the Supreme Court to defend the federal government's authority in bringing charges. Eighteen men, including Killen, were arrested and charged with conspiracy to violate the victims' civil rightsThe Civil Rights Act of 1968, passed in part due to this case, provided for life imprisonment or the death penalty for deprivations of civil rights resulting in bodily injury or death. Prior to that, the maximum penalty was ten years. in United States v. Price. The trial, which began in 1966 at the federal courthouse of Meridian before an all-white jury,Prior to the 1986 Supreme Court decision Batson v. Kentucky, prosecutors could use the peremptory challenge to arbitrarily exclude individuals from a jury based solely on their race. In addition, all-white juries had been standard in the South because blacks were disenfranchised from voting since 1890, and therefore could not serve on juries. convicted seven conspirators, including the deputy sheriff, and acquitted eight others. It was the first time a white jury convicted a white official of civil rights killings.Campbell Robertson, \\"Last Chapter for a Courthouse Where Mississippi Faced Its Past\\", New York Times, September 18, 2012, pp. 1, 16 For three men, including Killen, the trial ended in a hung jury, with the jurors deadlocked 11‚Äì1 in favor of conviction. The lone holdout said that she could not convict a preacher. The prosecution decided not to retry Killen and he was released. None of the men found guilty would serve more than six years in prison. More than 20 years later, Jerry Mitchell, an award-winning investigative reporter for The Clarion-Ledger in Jackson, Mississippi, wrote extensively about the case for six years. Mitchell helped to secure convictions in other high- profile Civil Rights Era murder cases, including the assassination of Medgar Evers, the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing, and the murder of Vernon Dahmer. Mitchell assembled new evidence regarding the murders of the three civil rights workers. He also located new witnesses and pressured the state to take action. Assisting Mitchell were high school teacher Barry Bradford and a team of three students from Illinois. The students persuaded Killen to do his only taped interview (to that point) about the murders. That tape showed Killen clinging to his segregationist views and competent and aware. The student-teacher team found more potential witnesses, created a website, lobbied the United States Congress, and focused national media attention on reopening the case. Carolyn Goodman, the mother of one of the victims, called them \\"super heroes\\". The film Mississippi Burning is related to the murders. Reopening of the case In early January 2004, a multiracial group of citizens in Neshoba County formed the Philadelphia Coalition, to seek justice in the 1964 murders. Led by co-chairs Leroy Clemons and Jim Prince, the group met over several months and then issued a call for justice, first in March of 2004 and then on the 40th anniversary of the murders. At that event, attended by over 1500 people, including the sitting Mississippi governor and four congressmen, including Rep. John Lewis and Rep. Bennie Thompson, included a lauded speech by former Mississippi Secretary of State Dick Molpus, imploring those with information about the crimes to come forward. http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2004/jun/21/dick-molpus-raises-the-roof- in-neshoba-county/ After that June call for justice, the members of the Coalition met over the summer with the state attorney general Jim Hood, along with Andrew Goodman's mother Carolyn Goodman and brother David Goodman. They asked Hood to re-open the case. The group also met with local district attorney Mark Duncan. Throughout the process, the group was supported by the William Winter Institute for Racial Reconciliation. In the fall of 2004, an anonymous donor provided funds through the Mississippi Religious Leadership Council for anyone with information leading to an arrest. On January 6, 2005, after these numerous calls from local leaders, AG Hood and DA Duncan convened a local grand jury, which indicted Edgar Ray Killen for the murders.See Renee Romano's Racial Reckoning: Prosecuting America's Civil Rights Murders and http://edition.cnn.com/2005/US/01/07/cnna.guyot/index.html In 2004, Killen declared that he would attend a petition-drive on his behalf, which was to be conducted by the Nationalist Movement at the 2004 Mississippi Annual State Fair in Jackson. The Nationalist Movement opposed communism, integration and non-speedy trials. The Hinds County sheriff, Malcolm McMillin, conducted a counter-petition, calling for a reopening of the state case against Killen. Killen was arrested for three counts of murder on January 6, 2005. He was freed on bond. His case drew comparisons to that of Byron De La Beckwith, who was charged with the killing of Medgar Evers in 1963 and rearrested in 1994. Killen's trial was scheduled for April 18, 2005. It was deferred after the 80-year-old Killen broke both of his legs while chopping lumber at his rural home in Neshoba County. The trial began on June 13, 2005, with Killen attending in a wheelchair. He was found guilty of manslaughter on June 21, 2005, 41 years to the day after the crime. The jury, consisting of nine white jurors and three black jurors, rejected the charges of murder, but found him guilty of recruiting the mob that carried out the killings. He was sentenced on June 23, 2005, by Circuit Judge Marcus Gordon to the maximum sentence of 60 years in prison, 20 years for each count of manslaughter, to be served consecutively. He would have been eligible for parole after serving at least 20 years. At the sentencing, Gordon stated that each life lost was valuable, and he said that the law made no distinction of age for the crime and that the maximum sentence should be imposed regardless of Killen's age. Prosecuting the case were Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood and Neshoba County District Attorney Mark Duncan. On August 12, Killen was released from prison on a $600,000 appeal bond. He claimed that he could no longer use his right hand (using his left hand to place his right one on the Bible during his swearing- in) and that he was permanently confined to his wheelchair. Gordon said he was convinced by the testimony that Killen was neither a flight risk nor a danger to the community. On September 3, The Clarion-Ledger reported that a deputy sheriff saw Killen walking around \\"with no problem\\". At a hearing on September 9, several other deputies testified to seeing Killen driving in various locations. One deputy said that Killen shook hands with him using his right hand. Gordon revoked the bond and ordered Killen back to prison, saying that he believed Killen had committed a fraud against the court. On March 29, 2006, Killen was moved from his prison cell to a City of Jackson hospital to treat complications from the severe leg injury that he sustained in the 2005 logging incident. On August 12, 2007, the Supreme Court of Mississippi affirmed Killen's conviction by a vote of 8‚Äì0 (one judge not participating). Incarceration and death The entrance of Mississippi State Penitentiary, where Killen was incarcerated Killen entered the Mississippi Department of Corrections system on June 27, 2005, to serve his sixty-year sentence (three twenty-year sentences running consecutively). That same year, after a circuit court judge denied Killen's request for a new trial, he was sent to the Central Mississippi Correctional Facility (CMCF) in an unincorporated area of Rankin County, near Pearl. He underwent evaluation, and prison officials were deciding whether to keep him at CMCF or to send him to the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman, an unincorporated community in Sunflower County.Myers, Debbie Burt. \\"Killen taken to Rankin County correctional facility\\", The Neshoba Democrat, June 27, 2005; retrieved September 1, 2010. Killen's release date was September 1, 2027 (by which time he would have been 102 years old). His location last changed on July 29, 2014. On February 25, 2010, the Associated Press reported that Killen filed a lawsuit against the FBI. The suit alleged that one of Killen's lawyers in his 1967 trial, Clayton Lewis, was an FBI informant, and that the FBI hired \\"gangster and killer\\" Gregory Scarpa to coerce witnesses. On February 18, 2011 U.S. Magistrate F. Keith Ball recommended that the lawsuit be dismissed. On March 23, 2011, District Judge Daniel P. Jordan, III, adopted the magistrate's report and dismissed the case. James Hart Stern, a black preacher from California, shared a prison cell with Edgar Ray Killen from August 2010 to November 2011 while the former was serving time for wire fraud. During that time, Killen and Stern forged a close relationship and Killen hand wrote dozens of letters to Stern outlining his views on race as well as confessing to other crimes. In addition to the letters, the former leader of the KKK signed over power of attorney and his land in Mississippi to his cellmate. Stern detailed his experience in the 2017 book Killen the KKK, co-authored by North Carolina author Autumn K. Robinson. Using his power of attorney, Stern disbanded Killen's incarnation of the KKK on January 5, 2016. On January 12, 2018, it was announced that he had died at the age of 92 at the Mississippi State Penitentiary in Parchman, Mississippi.

The United Nations and peacekeeping forces stationed in Rwanda at the time made little effort to suppress the massacre. They would eventually be ordered to leave, prior to the conclusion of the genocide, even though many peacekeepers were providing protection to Tutsis who sought refuge.\\"Genocide in Rwanda.\\" The United Human Rights Council. 4 May 2012. Archived from the original on 2013-08-27.\\"Rwandan Genocide.\\" History. A&E; Television Networks. [2009] 2019. Retrieved 14 August 2020.  Background  As the Tutsi had historically been the ruling class of Rwanda (as enforced by Belgian colonialism), centuries of Hutu hostility toward the elite minority had made politics a tense arena in the country. In 1959, the Tutsi elite were overthrown by a Hutu revolution, after which a Hutu government was established in 1961 with the support of European powers. President Juv√©nal Habyarimana, a moderate Hutu who came to power in 1973, increased divisions between the Tutsi and Hutus. On 6 April 1994, Habyarimana was shot down in a plane, thereby sparking what began the 100 days of genocidal violence against the Tutsi and moderate Hutu. The population of Rwanda in 1994 was approximately seven million people, composed of 85% Hutu, 14% Tutsi, and 1% Twa (a Pygmy tribe). It is estimated that about 800,000 people‚Äîthree-quarters of the Tutsi population in Rwanda‚Äîwere killed in the genocide. Anyone suspected of being a Tutsi was killed while fleeing the roadblocks and leaving the country. Proclaimed to be traitors, Hutus opposing the genocide were also killed. The Hutu extremists, Interahamwe, were successful in their genocide, as the lives of hundreds of thousands of Rwandans were claimed, with 2 million refugees (mostly Hutus) having fled Rwanda further exacerbating a humanitarian crisis. The massacre would only cease after the Rwandan Patriotic Front, the rebel group of Tutsis based in Uganda, stopped the Interahamwe. Paul Kagame, the leader of the RPF, subsequently became the president of Rwanda. Response Much of the international community infamously took little action in preventing the Rwandan genocide, hoping to avoid the loss of life and political entanglement that the American debacle in Somalia had created a few years prior. As reports of the genocide spread through the media, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) supplied more than five thousand troops to provide a strong force; however the delay and denial of recommendations prevented the force from reaching there on time, arriving months after the genocide was over. A UNSC vote in April 1994 led to the withdrawal of most of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) peacekeeping operation. In the events that took place after the genocide, government officials in the community mourned over the loss of many and were surprised about the world‚Äôs obliviousness to the situation that could have prevented the massacre from taking place. Just as the atrocities in Yugoslavia, the Rwandan genocide did not seem to interest the outside world.Lorch, Donatella. 20 September 1995. \\"Pope Calls for End to Killings in Rwanda\\". New York Times. EBSCO Host. =Belgium= Belgium was a colonial power in Rwanda and had a deep political connection with their government even after decolonization, their main connection being the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR), which was initially mostly composed of Belgian soldiers. Out of the 2,548 troops authorized by the United Nations in October 1993, initially only 800 were deployed, half of which were Belgian. Concerned about the continued armament of militia in February 1994, Belgium warned the UN of the potential for a massacre and urged the international community to strengthen UNAMIR's peacekeeping force. These warnings fell on deaf ears:Adelman, Howard. 2009. \\"The role of non-African states in the Rwandan Genocide.\\" YorkSpace. US: Centre for Refugee Studies, York University. . soldiers were told that they were in Rwanda for purposes of a peace mission and were not allowed to fight, as this was not their assignment. After the attack of 6 April 1994, the Radio des milles collines spread the rumor that Belgian soldiers from UNAMIR were the source. The Rwandan presidential guard captured and assassinated Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana and her husband, as well as the ten Belgian soldiers assigned to protect them. Lt. Thierry Lottin had contact with General Dallaire about the serenity of the situation while protecting the Prime Minister, but Dallaire initially did not see the urge to retreat.Klep, Chris. 2009. Somali√´, Rwanda, Srebrenica: De nasleep van drie ontspoorde vredesmissies. Boom. This dramatic episode drove Belgium into a depressive consternation which entailed its disengagement from UNAMIR. As to justify its decision, Belgium carried the UN along with a spiraling number of countries who were leaving UNAMIR. An informer, known as \\"Jean-Pierre\\" by General Dallaire, had revealed to Dallaire that the people behind the genocide were counting on the fact that western nations couldn't tolerate their own casualties and thus would pull out of the mission. Beginning from 7 April, Belgium demanded an extension of the mandate of UNAMIR in order to evacuate the 1,520 Belgian residents. The intentions of the Belgian ambassador were provided in the Belgian Senate report of 12 April 1996: \\"We are preoccupied above all with the personnel who have worked for us, of certain people associated with the process of democratization, with clergymen.\\" The report follows: \\"Finally, operation 'Silver Back' began on April 10 and will be completed on April 15 when the last Belgian civilians will have left Rwanda.\\" After the genocide, a traumatized Belgium began a parliamentary reflection, with the senate instituting the Commission d'enqu√™te parlementaire ('Parliamentary Inquiry Commission'), which inquired and composed a parliamentary report.\\"Commission d'enqu√™te parlementaire concernant les √©v√©nements du Rwanda\\" (Parliamentary document n¬∞ 1-611/7). S√©nat de Belgique, Session de 1997-1998. 6 December 1997. On 6 April 2000, Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt attended the ceremony commemorating the 6th anniversary of the genocide in Kigali. He took the occasion to make apologies, taking on \\"the responsibility of my country, according to what we have learnt afterwards in the name of my country and of my people, I beg your pardon.\\"\\"Le mond durant le g√©nocide: l'ONU, la Belgique, la France et l'OUA [The world during the genocide: the UN, Belgium, France, and the OAU].\\" Ch. 15 in Rapport de l'OUA sur le g√©nocide au Rwanda. ¬ß 52. =Canada= In July 1993, UNAMIR Force Commander General Rom√©o Dallaire received little information on the background of the conflict in Rwanda. Upon requesting current intelligence, he was denied and given little access to the information. Forced to proceed on his mission blindly due to the lack of information Canada was given, the mission was planned poorly, especially as they were provided with inexperienced experts in economic, political and human rights operational planning. This came as a result of military operations that had ignored requirements for long-term addresses to the cause of the Rwandan conflict. Their mandate allowed them only to monitor the implementation of the Arusha Accords and to support the transitional Government. The mission was also restricted with little funding or time, and force was prohibited except in self-defence. After the 1994 shooting down of President Habyarimana's plane, Dallaire called for reinforcement and was denied. By April 10, it was clear the non-battle pole strategy had failed to prevent the genocide. Belgium withdrew its forces after a number of their soldiers were massacred and the majority of the UN force followed shortly afterwards. UNAMIR eventually took under protection 40,000 Rwandans despite their strict mandate. The Peacemaking (Chapter VII) UNAMIR II deployed once the airport had been retaken and forces could begin to arrive (UN ARCH). Canadian (Operation Lance), British (Operation Gabriel), and Australian (Operation Tamor) forces were among the first western nations to arrive and join the small UN force and begin assisting Rwandan in achieving peace and healing, including intervening in the genocide. Canada‚Äôs new role in genocide prevention is to take action under the United Nations Charter as they consider appropriate, in an attempt to prevent and suppress the violent acts of genocide. With the use of a bipolar strategy, military defense prevention and suppression, Canadian policy makers can respond when it may be the only practical way of stopping genocides.Beardsley, Brent. 2010. \\"Responding to the Terror of Genocide: Learning from the Rwandan Genocide of 1994.\\" Pp. 197‚Äì216 in Understanding Terror: Perspectives for Canadians, edited by K-A.

To honor the lost and injured, the Rwandan embassy and Chinese communities organized events in Beijing and in a few Rwandan communities. Memorials were marked with silence, prayers, songs and presentations on the history of Rwanda; they expressed the hope that the world could learn from this tragedy.\\"Rwandans in China mark Genocide.\\" The New Times. Ebsco Host. =France= From October 1990 to December 1993, the French army led Op√©ration Noroit, when the president of the French Republic responded to the Rwandan Republic. France openly supported the regime of Juv√©nal Habyarimana against the RPF rebels, contributing a 'French presence to the limit of direct engagement' according to the title of a chapter of the report of the French parliamentary mission. This operation allowed the French to organize and train Rwandan troops, who subsequently formed the Interahamwe militias, or even future militiamen. Oppositely, France, in agreement with the international community, endorsed the peace process of the negotiations of the Arusha accords between the Rwandan government, their opposition, and the exiles of the FPR. In December 1993, France used the arrival of UNAMIR, who had come to the implementation of the Arusha accords, as a front, while according to diverse sources, some military technicians continued to operate in Rwanda. A couple of Frenchmen were notably assassinated, reportedly by the RPF, in the hours that followed the attack, while they were engaged in setting up sophisticated electronic equipment. On 8 April 1994, two days after the attack against president Habyarimana, France launched Op√©ration Amaryllis in order to permit the secured evacuation of 1500 residents, mainly westerners. The Rwandan survivors have strongly criticized that operation which, according to numerous testimonials, did not include the evacuation of the Rwandans threatened with the massacres, even when they were employed by the French authorities. France also evacuated dignitaries from the Habyarimana regime, and on 11 April, 97 children from the orphanage protected by Madame Habyarimana were evacuated. According to several sources, several dignitaries close to the Habyarimana family were also evacuated. Operation Amaryllis terminated on 14 April. UNAMIR's Kigali sector commander, Belgian Col. Luc Marchal, reported to the BBC that one of the French planes supposedly participating in the evacuation operation arrived at 0345 hours on 9 April with several boxes of ammunition. The boxes, weighing about , were unloaded and transported by FAR vehicles to the Kanombe camp where the Rwandese Presidential Guard was quartered. The French government has categorically denied this shipment, saying that the planes carried only French military personnel and material for the evacuation. France was very active at the UN in the discussions about the reinforcement of the UNAMIR in May 1994. In front of the inertia of the international community, France obtained the backing of the UN to lead Op√©ration Turquoise from June 22 to August 22, 1994. The declared goal was to protect the \\"threatened populations,\\" both by the genocide and by the military conflict between the FPR and the temporary Rwandan government. No hierarchy between the two types of threatened people was established. The two parties of the military conflict assimilated them and the system was organised to remain neutral between the two different groups. This system was humanitarian in some cases, notably during a cholera epidemic in refugee camps in Za√Øre, the modern-day Democratic Republic of the Congo, however it was the source of many distinct controversies surrounding the French role at the time of Operation Noroit and the criticism of having facilitated the desertion of those responsible for the genocide and a massive refugee movement of the population to Congo (around two million people). France has accused the FPR of having provoked half of these movements by refusing the advice of French authorities not to get involved in the northwest of the country. France, one of the five permanent members of the Security Council of the UN, has been accused of a role that some of those answerable to France refute and who claim that Operation Turquoise was an exemplary humanitarian intervention. Some use as context that in supporting a group that would become genocidal, and who, according to the French parliamentary report, did not hide their genocidal intentions, France would have favoured the launching of the genocide. As the outgrowth of a press campaign, especially the articles written by the journalist Patrick de Saint-Exup√©ry which appeared in 1994 and in 1998 in the French newspaper Le Figaro, the French parliament decided to examine the actions of France in Rwanda using a parliamentary information mission for Rwanda. Some French NGOs who specialise in Rwanda would have preferred a parliamentary enquiry mission whose judicial powers would have been more extensive in order to find the truth. After several months of work, the president of the parliamentary mission, the former Defence Minister Paul Quil√®s, concluded that France was \\"not guilty\\" (December 1998).  21st century  Ten years later, during the year 2004, books, films, radio programmes and television shows have brought the controversies surrounding France's role in Rwanda back to life. Unsatisfied by the conclusions of the report from the parliamentary mission for Rwanda, some citizens and NGOs have formed a citizens' enquiry commission. After a week of work in Paris, their \\"provisional conclusions\\" were read on 27 March 2004 at a conference that they organised the enclave of the French Assembl√©e nationale in the presence of one of two of the original people who had publicly stated the findings of the parliamentary mission, the former deputy Pierre Brana. On April 7, 2004 a serious diplomatic incident took place between France and Rwanda during the commemoration of the genocide in Kigali. In the course of the ceremonies, the Rwandan President publicly accused France of not having apologised for its role in Rwanda while desiring to participate in the ceremonies. In July 2004, the ministers of Foreign Affairs from the two countries convened in order to \\"share the work of a memory piece\\" about the genocide. Rwanda announced several days later, according to a dispatch from Agence France-Presse from August 2, 2004, that \\"the council of ministers has adopted the organic law project to aid in the creation of the independent national commission charged with assembling proof of the implication of France in the genocide perpetrated in Rwanda in 1994.\\" The French minister of Foreign Affairs \\"took action\\" for the creation of the Rwandan commission. On 22 October 2004 the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda officially demanded that the \\"Republic of France\\" allow former ambassador Jean Michel Marlaud and one of his military representatives, officer Jean Jacques Maurin to respond to the demand of the defence of the presumed mastermind of the genocide: Colonel Bagosora pending judgement. Colonel Bagosra was the first Rwandan officer to have graduated from the French √âcole des Officiers. On 27 November 2004 in a televised debate on France 3, after the showing of the French film Tuez les Tous ('Kill Them All'), created by three students of political science, the president of the parliamentary mission for information for Rwanda, Paul Quil√®s stated for the first time that \\"France asks to be pardoned by the people of Rwanda, but not by their government.\\" On 6 April 2014, Rwandan president Paul Kagame repeated the charges against France as \\"direct role of Belgium and France in the political preparation for the genocide\\" in an interview with Jeune Afrique magazine. He also accused French soldiers who took part in a military humanitarian mission in the south of the former Belgian colony of being both accomplices and \\"actors\\" in the bloodbath. =Rwandan report of 2008= On 5 August 2008, an independent Rwandan commission said France was aware of preparations for the 1994 Rwanda genocide and helped train the ethnic Hutu militia perpetrators. It accuses France of training Hutu militias responsible for the slaughter, helping plan the genocide, and participating in the killings. The report accused 33 senior French military and political officials on Tuesday of involvement in the genocide. Among those named were then- President Fran√ßois Mitterrand, Prime Minister √âdouard Balladur, Foreign Minister Alain Jupp√©, and his then-chief aide, Dominique de Villepin. \\"French soldiers themselves directly were involved in assassinations of Tutsis and Hutus accused of hiding Tutsis,\\" said the report, which was compiled by a team of investigators from the Justice Ministry. =United States= Following the events surrounding the Battle of Mogadishu in Somalia the year prior, the United States refused to provide requested material aid to Rwanda.Evidence of Inaction: A National Security Archive Briefing Book, ed. Ferroggiaro France, China, and Russia opposed involvement in what was seen as an \\"internal affair.\\" Dallaire was directly \\"taken to task,\\" in his words, for even suggesting that UNAMIR should raid Hutu militants' weapons caches, whose location had been disclosed to him by a government informant.Barnett, 'Eyewitness to a Genocide'. The informer was Jean-pierre Twatzinze The UN failed to respond adequately to Dallaire's urgent requests.\\"Statement of the Secretary-General on Receiving the Report,\\" Report of The Independent Inquiry into the Actions of the UN During the 1994 Genocide in Rwanda, 1999 The role of the United States was directly inspired by the defeat they had undergone during their 1993 intervention in Somalia. President Bill Clinton and U.S. Ambassador to the UN Madeleine Albright repeatedly refused to take action; government documents that were declassified in 2004 indicate that the Clinton administration knew that Rwanda was being engulfed by genocide in April 1994, but buried the information to justify the United States' inaction. Intelligence reports obtained using the Freedom of Information Act show that the cabinet and (almost certainly) the president had been told of a planned \\"final solution to eliminate all Tutsis\\" before the slaughter reached its peak.Carroll, Rory. 31 March 2004. \\"US chose to ignore Rwandan genocide Classified papers show Clinton was aware of 'final solution' to eliminate Tutsis.\\" The Guardian. For two months, from April to May 1994, the American government argued over the word genocide which is banned by the Convention for the Prevention and the Repression of Crime and Genocide (adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 10 December 1948). Senior US officials privately used the term genocide within 16 days of the beginning of the killings, but chose not to do so publicly as Clinton had already decided not to intervene. In 2001, the government of the United States declassified documents that confirm the attitude of the United States of not having taken into account the reality of the situation starting in January 1994.\\"The US and the Genocide in Rwanda 1994\\". Clinton and Albright would both later express regret for their inaction. Clinton would go on to provide major funding for the Genocide Memorial in Kigali. He would also visit Rwanda in 1998 and 2005, apologizing both times, saying that he \\"expressed regret for what he says was his 'personal failure' to prevent the slaughter of an estimated 800,000 people.\\" Moreover, through the Clinton Foundation, he has attempted amends by sponsoring initiatives to help rebuild Rwanda. =Other African states= The OAU, which has today become the African Union, created a report on the genocide in 2000.\\"Rapport de l'OUA sur le g√©nocide au Rwanda.\\" Organisation of African Unity. 2001. Before the UNAMIR mission led by Gen. Rom√©o Dallaire (military) and Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh (civilian), the OAU had indeed sent a Neutral Military Observation Group, known by its French initials as GOMN. =United Nations= The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) has accepted the failing of their responsibility to prevent the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Following the death of ten Belgium soldiers, the United Nations reported the removal of most 2,500 peacekeepers. Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy stated \\"none present could look back without feeling guilt and devastation at the lack to help the Rwandan civilians at their time in need\\" (BBC News). Even as the council stopped short and delivered an apology, 15 council members focused on a report about lessons to be learned. It was based on the lack of support and help in Africa. The United Nations presents a core policy and a great challenge to prevent another round of genocidal violence. The councils have already evidently learned how to bring peace from lessons of past failures. The Rwandan ambassador Joseph Mutaboba has welcomed the report and its apologies stating that the council could do more, it's not too late. In 1994, the UNSC had appointed General Kofi Annan to the Council and to the Head of United Nations Peacekeeping operations. Annan commissioned the report and was publicly criticized for not delivering warnings about the upcoming genocide. Kofi Annan has accepted the conclusions based on recorded reports.\\"UN Admits Rwanda genocide failure.\\" BBC News. UK: BBC News Broadcasting. 15 April 2000. The United Nations has been criticized for inaction. In terms of responsibility, the UN is retrospectively considered to be followed by France, who moved in too late and ended up protecting the genocidaires thereby permanently destabilizing the region; and the United States, who actively worked against an effective UNAMIR and became involved only to aid the same Hutu refugee population and the genocidaires as France, leaving genocide survivors to flounder. On April 12, 1994, The Guardian stated that when viewing a woman \\"being hauled along the road by a young man with a machete\\": :...none of the troops moved. 'It's not our mandate,' said one, leaning against his jeep as he watched the condemned woman, the driving rain splashing at his blue United Nations badge. The 3,000 foreign troops now in Rwanda are no more than spectators to the savagery which aid workers say has seen the massacre of 15,000 people. Michael Barnett, who was a senior official at the UN at that time, has provided evidence that the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) failed to pass on to the Security Council information that could have bolstered a case for intervention. This information included the location of Interhamwe arms caches and information preceding the genocide that the Interhamwe were compiling a list of all the Tutsis in Kigali. The informer was Jean-Pierre Twatzinze, who has been asked to compile the list. According to Barnett, UN inaction stemmed from its desire not to get involved in a potentially PR-risky operation which could damage the prospects for future peacebuilding operations, given that 18 UN troops had recently been killed in Somalia, even though UN troops had the capacity to save thousands of lives.Feil 2005, 'Could 5000 Peacekeepers Have Saved 500,000 Rwandans?' \\"For many at the UN\\", Barnett writes, the moral compass pointed \\"away from and not toward Rwanda.\\" Barnett 2006, Eyewitness to a Genocide Arms shipments =From France= In the early morning of January 22, 1994, a DC-8 aircraft loaded with armaments from France, including 90 boxes of Belgian-made 60 mm mortars, was confiscated by UNAMIR at Kigali International Airport. The delivery was in violation of the cease-fire clauses of the Arusha Accords, which prohibited introduction of arms into the area during the transition period. General Dallaire put the arms under joint UNAMIR-Rwandan army guard. Formally recognizing this point, the French government argued that the delivery stemmed from an old contract and hence was technically legal. Dallaire was forced to give up control over the aircraft.Arms Shipments and the Rwandan Genocide. Online posting.

They first appear under that name in the 1st century AD Germania of Tacitus as a Germanic tribe that lived to the north of the Lower Rhine. Their name probably survives in the region today called Hamaland, which is in the Gelderland province of the Netherlands, between the IJssel and Ems rivers. Etymology The Germanic name of the Chamavi has been reconstructed as *Hamawiz, whereby the ham- element is generally taken to refer to alluvial land near an estuary; in this case those of the rivers IJssel and Rhine. In this interpretation the tribal name could be translated as \\"those who dwell near the river mouth\\". Less commonly accepted etymologies connect the Chamavi to hamo- an early West Germanic loan of Latin hamus, meaning fishhook; ie. \\"the Fishermen\\"; or to Proto-Germanic *hami√æja (related to Old Norse hamr and Gothic hamon) which described a piece of clothing or covering; the Dutch word lichaam (body, literally a \\"shape/likeness covering\\") is related to the same root.M. Philippa, F. Debrabandere, A. Quak, T. Schoonheim en N. van der Sijs (2003-2009) Etymologisch Woordenboek van het Nederlands, 4 delen, Amsterdam Location and historical mentions According to Velleius Paterculus, in 4 BC, Tiberius crossed the Rhine and attacked, in sequence, the Chamavi, Chattuari, and Bructeri implying that the Chamavi lived west of the other two named tribes. The Bructeri lived between the Ems and Lippe, so the Chamavi also probably lived west of the Ems. Tacitus reports in his Annals that in the time of Nero (apparently 58 AD), the Angrivarii, having been ejected from their homes further to the north, pleaded with Rome to allow them to live in a military buffer zone on the northern bank of the Rhine, saying that \\"these fields belonged to the Chamavi; then to the Tubantes; after them to the Usipii\\".Tac. Ann. 13.55 These fields, being on the Rhine between IJssel and Lippe, were to the south of modern Hamaland, and to the west of the Bructeri. In this passage he does not explain where the Chamavi had moved to. In his Germania, Tacitus reported that the Chamavi and Angrivarii had moved, apparently recently in his time (around 100 AD) into the lands of the Bructeri, the Bructeri having been expelled and utterly destroyed by an alliance of neighboring peoples....Tac. Ger. 33 The Bructeri lived in the area between the Lippe and Ems rivers, to the southeast of modern Hamaland, which is to the west of the Ems. Tacitus also reports that to the north of the Chamavi and Angrivarii lived \\"the Dulgubini and Chasuarii, and other tribes not equally famous\\".Tac. Ger. 34 To their south then were the Tencteri, at that time between the Rhine and the Chatti.Tac. Ger. 32 (The Bructeri however continue to appear in the record and apparently moved south.) Ptolemy in his Geographia (2.10), mentions several tribal names which could refer to different reports of the Chamavi's position. But the text is notoriously difficult to unravel: *Ptolemy describes the peoples between the Frisians and Chauci on the North Sea coast, and the more nomadic and newly arrived Suebic nations who he describes (unusually) as now living in a band from their more well-known locations near the Elbe all the way to the Rhine, where he places at least part of the Suebic Langobardi. From west to east: Between the Frisians and the Rhine, he places the lesser Bructeri; between the Ems and Weser rivers he places the greater Bructeri, and the \\"Chaimai\\"; and between Weser and Elbe, the Angrivarii, \\"Laccobardi\\" (probably Langobardi, and this is a more normal place for them to be reported living), and Dulgubnii. These \\"Chaimai\\" are therefore neighbours of the Angrivarii, Chauci, and Dulgubni, roughly matching Tacitus, although the Bructeri have not disappeared. So this passage matches other classical texts. *On the other hand, coming from the direction of the Elbe, and now south of the Suebian band of peoples, the Kamauoi (Latinized to Camavi) are mentioned together with the Cherusci at \\"Mount Melibocus\\", which is thought to be the Harz mountains. Both are said to be \\"under\\", meaning south of, the Calucones, who lived on both side of the Elbe. Matching the Harz, the Elbe is also to the west, where the \\"Bainochaimai\\" live. Although these Cherusci are close to where other texts report them, this is quite far to the east of Hamaland, and also somewhat to the east of the land of the Bructeri. So this is an unusual placement to be reported for the Chamavi. *In a third place, when describing the tribes south of the band of Suevi, and east of the Abnobian mountains running parallel to the Rhine, apparently coming from the west this time, Ptolemy mentions first that \\"under\\" the most westerly Suevi are, apparently from north to south, the Chasuarii, then Nertereani, then Danduti, then the Turoni and Marvingi, then under the Marvingi, the Curiones, then Chattuari, as far as the Danube and the Parmaecampi. The next apparent north to south series starts not with Suevi but with the Camavi (presumably the ones in the Harz mountains, who are described as being south of the Suebi) \\"under\\" whom are the Chatti and Tubanti, and then between these and the Sudetes mountains, thought to be the Erzgebirge, the Teuriochaemae (an otherwise unknown name, but in the place previously inhabited by the Hermanduri and later by the Thuringii, with these three names often thought to be equivalent).http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0064:entry=teuriochaemae- geo Not only the Chamavi, but also the Tubanti, Chasuarii, and Chattuari, are described by Tacitus and other sources as living much further to the north of the Rhine and the Harz mountains, nowhere near the Danube. The Chatti however, are in approximately the expected place. In about 293 or 294, according to the Latin Panegyrics VIII, Constantius Chlorus, had victories in the Scheldt delta, and his opponents are often thought to have been Chamavi and Frisii, because the author of the text then mentions that as a result, Chamavi and Frisians now plow his land and the price of food is lower. Some also apparently became soldiers, and about 300 the 11th cohort \\"chamadoroi\\" were noted in Peamou in Upper Egypt, corresponding to the 11th cohort Chamavi known from the Notitia Dignitatum.In Praise of Later Roman Emperors: The Panegyrici Latini, edited by C. E. V. Nixon, Barbara Saylor Rodgers https://books.google.be/books?id=0WlC_UtU8M4C We know the Chamavi were among them because there was a settlement pagus (Ch)amavorum (French; Amous) . In 313, Constantine the Great also defeated Franks near the Rhine. The Panegyric which survives mentions the Bructeri, Chamavi, Cherusci, Lancionae, Alemanni and Tubantes. The new name \\"Franks\\" also started to be used to refer to both Salians, Chamavi, and some other tribes, in this period. On the Peutinger map, which dates to as early as the 4th century, is a brief note written in the space north of the Rhine, generally interpreted as Hamavi qui et Pranci which is translated as The Hamavi, who are Franks. In the 350s there were many conquests claimed by emperor Julian against Franks on the Rhine. In the winter of 357/358 he defeated plundering Salians and Chamavi on the Maas river, and left the Salians in Roman territory because of their permission to live there, but forced the Chamavi to leave.Lanting; van der Plicht (2010) p.67 Unlike the Salii, these Chamavi were expelled from Roman lands, though they clearly lived close by, where their grain was disappointingly unready for Roman use.Ammianus Marcellinus, Res Gestae, Book XVII-8 In an apparent description of the same events, Zosimus does not mention the Chamavi, but a Saxon group known as the \\"Kouadoi\\", a Greek spelling of \\"Quadi\\", which some authors believe might be a misunderstanding for the Chamavi. According to him, this tribe had pushed into Batavia, displacing the Salians.Zosimus Nova Historia Book III In 392 AD, according to a citation by Gregory of Tours, Sulpicius Alexander reported that Arbogast crossed the Rhine to punish the \\"Franks\\" for incursions into Gaul. He first devastated the territory of the Bricteri, near the bank of the Rhine, then the Chamavi, apparently their neighbours. Both tribes did not confront him. The Ampsivarii and the Chatti however were under military leadership of the Frankish princes Marcomer and Sunno and they appeared \\"on the ridges of distant hills\\". At this time the Bructeri apparently lived near Cologne. Note that the Chamavi and the Ampsivarii are the two peoples that Tacitus had long before noted as having conquered the Bructeri from their north. This description would place the lands of the Chamavi still close to the old Bructeri lands. The Chamavi also appear in the 5th century Notitia Dignitatum as a Roman military unit. Gregory of Tours also mentions the Chamavi as having been among the Franks. The Lex Chamavorum Francorum is the modern name of a Frankish legal code known from the 9th century, which was official under Charlemagne. It is not clear whether it was really intended to refer to Chamavi.Text: here, but there are doubts, see for example here.

Like Farinelli, Caffarelli was a student of Nicola Porpora. Early life and training Caffarelli was born Gaetano Carmine Francesco Paolo Majorano to Vito Majorano and Anna Fornella in Bitonto. His early life is uncertain. His stage name, Caffarelli, is said to be taken from an early teacher Caffaro who taught him music in childhood, others say it was taken from a patron, Domenico Caffaro. There is evidence that he personally desired to be castrated. When aged ten, he was given the income from two vineyards owned by his grandmother, according to the legal document, so that he could study grammar and, especially, music: \\"to which he is said to have a great inclination, desiring to have himself castrated and become an eunuch\\".Rosselli, p153 He became the pupil of Nicola Porpora. According to legend, Porpora kept the young Caffarelli working from one sheet of exercises for six years, and then eventually declared: \\"Go, my son: I have no more to teach you. You are the greatest singer in Europe\\".Heriot, p48; Heriot doubts the truth of this story, though Franz Hab√∂ck published a copy of what purports to be Porpora's page of exercises in his Die Kastraten und ihre Gesangskunst (Stuttgart, 1927, p382-385), and it may have been something of this kind from which Caffarelli worked. Career In Carnival 1726, aged 15, he made his debut at Rome in Domenico Sarro's Valdemaro, singing the third female role, and listed with the stage name ‚ÄúCaffarellino.‚Äù His fame spread rapidly throughout Italy during the 1730s, with performances at Venice, Turin, Milan, Florence, before returning to Rome for a great success in Johann Adolf Hasse's Cajo Fabricio. His time in London was not particularly successful, public memory of Farinelli being too strong, but at the King's Theatre during the 1737‚Äì38 season he created roles in Giovanni Battista Pescetti's pasticcio Arsace and Handel's Faramondo, in addition to the title role in Handel's Serse, singing the famous aria \\"Ombra mai f√π\\".Dean a caricature of Caffarelli by Pier Leone Ghezzi, c1740 In later years he worked at Madrid (1739), Vienna (1749), Versailles (1753), and Lisbon (1755). His career in France, to which he had been invited by Louis XV, was suddenly cut short after he badly wounded a poet during a duel, and left in disgrace after only one year . In 1734 the singer had taken up a post at the royal chapel of Naples, and over the next twenty years he often performed at the Teatro di San Carlo. At Naples he sang for Pergolesi, Porpora, Hasse, and Leonardo Vinci, not to mention starring in Gluck's La Clemenza di Tito. After 1756 he sang little, though in 1770 Charles Burney heard him and praised his \\"expression and grace.\\" Always a favourite of royal families and a first-rate castrato who could command vast fees, Caffarelli made a large fortune, and was able to buy himself a dukedom and impressive estates in Naples and Calabria. On a palazzo he built he added the superscription \\"Amphion Thebas, ego domum\\" (\\"Amphion built Thebes, I this house\\"). However, he fell foul of local wit when some wag mockingly added to this \\"ille cum, tu sine\\" (\\"he with, you without\\").Heriot, p152 Character Caffarelli was notorious for his unpredictability and displays of temperament, both on and off stage. On stage he is reputed to have sung his own preferred versions irrespective of what his colleagues were doing, mimicking them while they sang their solos and sometimes conversing with members of the public in their boxes during the same. Off stage his pugnacity and fierce demeanour led to his willingness to fight duels under little provocation. Such behaviour led to spells of house arrest and imprisonment for assault and for misconduct during performances. Most infamously he completely humiliated a prima donna during a performance of Hasse's Antigono in 1745. On the other hand, with Handel, also a famously fiery character, he seems to have been able to coexist on a peaceable basis, perhaps due to the fantastic sums of money the composer paid him for his work. Time, furthermore, seemed to soften Caffarelli. In the latter years of his life he donated extensively to charity, and when Burney met the singer then he was impressed by his politeness. He died in Naples. Voice and reputation Caffarelli's voice was that of a mezzo-soprano, with an extensive range and a high tessitura. Those who heard him sing ranked him only behind his direct competitor Farinelli as the finest singer of that time. Farinelli, however, ended his public career at just 32, while Caffarelli kept performing well into his fifties and over. Even at the end of his career, Burney thought that he had been \\"an amazing fine singer\\". His teacher, Porpora, who (according to Burney) loathed Caffarelli's overweening arrogance, nonetheless claimed that he was \\"the greatest singer Italy had ever produced\\". Friedrich Melchior Grimm summed up his qualities: With the nickname \\"Caffariello,\\" Caffarelli is brought up in the libretto for Rossini's opera The Barber of Seville written by Cesare Sterbini. He is singled out in Act 2 by the stuffy Dr. Bartolo as a singer who exemplified the greatness of operatic culture of the past.

It has been involved in both national programs and multinational efforts coordinated via the European Space Agency (ESA). The Austrian Space Agency was established in 1972, its headquarters is located in Vienna. On 1 January 1987, Austria became a member state of the ESA. The agency is notable for coordinating the first space flight of an Austrian, that of engineer Franz Viehb√∂ck with a Soviet Soyuz spacecraft, during 1990. History =Background= Prior to the formation of the Austrian Space Agency, Austria had been actively involved in space activities. During the late 1950s and 1960s, the nation opted to increasingly involve itself in numerous international space-orientated committees, typically via the United Nations. Austrian delegates coordinated with international counterparts to formulate numerous early treaties and establish laws related to the use of space. The Austrian government also developed an interest in promoting space-based activities, particularly its domestic efforts. During early 1961, the nation was involved in talks towards founding the European Space Research Organisation (ESRO); upon its founding three years later, Austria opted for observer status. This was reportedly due to a lack of an agreement on the nation's financial contributions. The Austrian government did not involve itself in the European Launcher Development Organisation (ELDO) initiative; this is primarily due to it being a violation of the Austrian State Treaty. While the nation was not a full member of the ESRO, several figures within Austria were keen to pursue a more active role in space activities. In May 1962, the Austrian Astronautical Society was established to launch scale model rockets with a vision towards future programmes. Between 1967 and 1972, the society represented Austria at the International Astronautical Federation, ceasing in this role following its replacement by the Austrian Space Agency. The formation of the Austrian Space Agency had been first proposed in 1962. In May 1968, the Austrian Federal Ministry for Foreign Affairs established a committee to investigate the possibility. Following the establishment of the Federal Ministry for Science and Research in 1970, a task force to realise the envisioned agency was put together. During 1972, the Austrian Space Agency was established. =Active years= The Austrian Space Agency's stated long term goal has been to strengthen the international standing of Austrian industry, business and science in space-based technologies to achieve economic and technological development, as well as to look after the growth of the Austrian aerospace sector. One function of the agency is the implementation of national aerospace policy, as well as to represent Austria on various international aerospace committees. During 1975, Austria began actively participating in the European Space Agency (ESA), the successor to the ESRO. During 1981, Austria was recognised as an associate member of the ESA. On 1 January 1987, the country formally became a full member of the ESA. Austria's involvement with the ESA activities extended beyond mandatory activities, such as space science, technology, and study programmes, into various optional programmes, including Earth observation and microgravitation research, space infrastructure and scientific experiment development, along with space navigation and telecommunications projects. Austria has pursued bilateral cooperative projects with various international partners. During 1989, Austria came to an agreement with the Soviet Union for a common Austrian-Soviet spaceflight; this led to engineer Franz Viehb√∂ck becoming the first Austrian citizen to experience space flight, having conducted a mission onboard a Soyuz spacecraft to the Mir space station during the following year. Other Austrian- Soviet cooperative efforts resulted in Austria developing numerous scientific instruments for probes, leading to its involvement in a range of missions. Other nations that Austria has conducted bilateral projects with include Norway, Sweden, France, Switzerland, and Germany.

The battle saved the city of Norfolk, and the adjacent city of Portsmouth, from British invasion. Especially important to Virginia and northeastern North Carolina, the region was a major hub for American commerce. Background Admiral Sir George Cockburn commanded a British fleet blockading Chesapeake Bay. In early 1813, Cockburn and Admiral Sir John B. Warren planned to attack the Gosport Shipyard in Portsmouth and capture the frigate U.S.S. Constellation. Brigadier General Robert B. Taylor commanded the Virginia Militia in the Norfolk area. Taylor hastily built defenses around Norfolk and Portsmouth, but he had no intentions of letting the British penetrate as far as those two cities. Instead Taylor commandeered several ships and created a chain barrier across the Elizabeth River between Fort Norfolk and Fort Nelson. He next built the Craney Island Fort on the island of the same name at the mouth of the Elizabeth River near Hampton Roads. Since the Constellation was already penned up in the Chesapeake because of the British blockade, the ship's crew was used to man some of the redoubts on the island. In all, 596 Americans were defending the fortifications on Craney Island. Battle On the morning of June 22, 1813, a British landing party of 700 Royal Marines and soldiers of the 102nd Regiment along with a company of Independent Foreigners came ashore at Hoffler's Creek near the mouth of the Nansemond River to the west of Craney Island. When the British landed, the defenders realized they were not flying a flag and quickly raised an American flag over the breastworks. The defenders fired, and the attackers began to fall back, realizing that they could not ford the water between the mainland and the island (the Thoroughfare) under such fire. British barges manned by sailors, Royal Marines, and the other company of Independent Foreigners then attempted to attack the eastern side of the island. Defending this portion was a company of light artillery under the command of Captain Arthur Emmerson. Emmerson ordered his gunners to hold their fire until the British were in range. Once they opened fire, the British attackers were driven off, with some barges destroyed, and they retreated back to the ships. Results The Americans had scored a defensive victory in the face of a much larger force. Norfolk and the Gosport Navy Yard were spared from attack. Having failed in their attempt to attack Norfolk, Admirals Warren and Cockburn moved north for actions in the Chesapeake Bay, including an attempt to attack St. Michaels, Maryland, in August. Two days later, the British crossed the Hampton Roads from Craney Island to take revenge on Hampton, Va. ‚Äì the town was burned and left in ruins. Most of the atrocities were committed by men of the Independent Companies of Foreigners, former French prisoners of war recruited from British prison hulks. While they were renowned for indiscipline, their actions at Hampton were not entirely unprovoked. During the landing, a boat containing 17 men of the Independent Companies became stranded on a shoal off shore, and the men were massacred by the American defenders despite their attempts to surrender. Enraged by the merciless treatment of their comrades by the Americans, the remainder of the Independent Companies ran amok when they landed. A British officer recorded the result in his diary: \\"Every horror was perpetrated with impunity ‚Äì rape, murder, pillage ‚Äì and not a single man was punished.\\" The repulse at Craney Island did not deter the British from further operations in Hampton Roads the next year. That year in 1814, they proceeded up the Chesapeake Bay to burn Washington, D.C., as there were no forts guarding the mouth of the bay at the time (this led to the building of Fort Monroe beginning in the 1820s, to close the bay to enemy vessels). American troops defeated a British landing attempt at Caulk's Field one week later and an assault on Baltimore roughly two weeks after that, ending British incursions in the mid-Atlantic. Legacy Three active battalions of the US Regular Army's 4th Infantry Regiment (1‚Äì4 Inf, 2‚Äì4 Inf and 3‚Äì4 Inf) perpetuate the lineages of the old 20th Infantry Regiment, which had elements that participated in the Battle of Craney Island.

Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska is named in his honor. In 1997 Carl Ben Eielson was inducted into the North Dakota Aviation Hall of Fame. Background Carl Ben Eielson was born in Hatton, North Dakota to Norwegian immigrant parents. His interest in aviation went back to his childhood. Following America's entry into World War I, Eielson found his chance to become an aviator. Eielson learned to fly in the U.S. Army Air Service in 1917. In January 1918 he enlisted in the newly formed aviation section of the U.S. Army Signal Corps. World War I ended while Eielson was in flight training. Eielson returned to North Dakota to help in his father's store and finish his degree at the University of North Dakota. During the winter of 1919-20, he and others founded the Hatton Aero Club, the first flying club in North Dakota. After graduating from the university in 1921, he enrolled at Georgetown Law School (now Georgetown University) in Washington, D.C. Working part-time as a police officer at the Capitol, he met the Alaska Territory's delegate to the Congress, Daniel Sutherland, who persuaded Ben to go to Alaska to teach secondary school. Career Eielson soon became the sole pilot for the Farthest North Aviation Company which was formed in 1923. In 1924, he flew the first air mail in Alaska from Fairbanks to McGrath, Alaska in under 3 hours, a distance dog sleds took up to 30 days to cover. He also flew the first air mail from Atlanta to Jacksonville, Florida in 1926. In March 1927, Australian polar explorer George Hubert Wilkins and Eielson explored the drift ice north of Alaska. They touched down in Eielson's airplane in the first land-plane descent onto drift ice. In April 1928, Eielson and Wilkins flew across the Arctic Ocean in the first flight from North America over the North Pole to Europe. The flight, from Point Barrow to Spitsbergen, covered and took 20 hours. When Eielson accompanied Wilkins on an Antarctic expedition later in 1928, they became the first men to fly over both polar regions of the world in the same year. During the Antarctic summer of 1928-1929, Eielson and Wilkins made air explorations of the Antarctic, charting several islands which were previously unknown. After his return from the Arctic flight, Eielson was asked to establish Alaskan Airways, a subsidiary of the Aviation Corporation of America. In 1929, Eielson died alongside his mechanic Earl Borland in an air crash in Siberia while attempting to evacuate furs and personnel from the Nanuk, a cargo vessel trapped in the ice at North Cape (now Mys Shmidta). Althoff, William F. Drift Station: Arctic outposts of superpower science (Potomac Books Inc., Dulles, Virginia. 2007. p. 35) Their bodies were discovered on February 18th, 1930. Legacy Carl Ben Eielson School and the Liberty ship SS Carl B. Eielson are named in his honor, as is Mount Eielson and the new visitor center at Denali National Park and Preserve. The Carl Ben Eielson Memorial Building on the University of Alaska Fairbanks campus is named in his honor. A peak in the West-Central Alaska Range is also named in his honor. An elementary school on Grand Forks Air Force Base in North Dakota is named after him as well as Ben Eielson High School on Eielson Air Force Base outside of North Pole, Alaska, and Carl Ben Eielson Middle School in Fargo, North Dakota. The Carl Ben Eielson House in Hatton, North Dakota is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. and In 1929, he was awarded the Harmon Trophy.

Suevian peoples in red, and other Irminones in purple. The Chasuarii were an ancient Germanic tribe known from the reports of authors writing in the time of the Roman Empire. They lived somewhere to the east and north of the Rhine, near the modern river Hase, which feeds into the Ems. This means they lived near modern Osnabr√ºck. Tacitus in his Germania (Chapter 34) says they are between Ems and Weser, to the north of the Angrivarii and Chamavi (who had also expanded into the area once belonging to the Bructeri, between Ems, Weser and Lippe). In this same area as the Chasuarii were the Dulgubnii (but then probably nearer the Weser). To their north, on the coast of the North Sea, were the Chauci. By the account of Tacitus, the Chauci in his time had not only the coast in this region, but would have also stretched down to the lands of the Cherusci (north of the Harz mountains) and Chatti (in modern Hessen). Claudius Ptolemy in his Geography places Chasuarii (ŒöŒ±œÉŒøœÖŒ¨œÅŒøŒπ), east of the Tencteri and Abnoba mountains which run north-south and parallel with the Rhine, and west of the Harz mountains where he places some Chamavi (Camavi) between the Cherusci and the Chatti. Interpretation of this passage in Ptolemy is difficult, and it may contain systematic errors. The position for the Chasuarii and Chamavi and many other tribes does not correspond to other sources, and for example in the case of the Chamavi and Tubantes, this includes post Roman records. Although the theory is not widely supported, the Chasuarii are sometimes thought to be equivalent to, or related to, the Chattuari, and maybe even the Chatti, based on similarity of names.

These functions can be thought of as one- dimensional matrix representations and so are special cases of the group characters that arise in the related context of character theory. Whenever a group is represented by matrices, the function defined by the trace of the matrices is called a character; however, these traces do not in general form a group. Some important properties of these one-dimensional characters apply to characters in general: * Characters are invariant on conjugacy classes. * The characters of irreducible representations are orthogonal. The primary importance of the character group for finite abelian groups is in number theory, where it is used to construct Dirichlet characters. The character group of the cyclic group also appears in the theory of the discrete Fourier transform. For locally compact abelian groups, the character group (with an assumption of continuity) is central to Fourier analysis. Preliminaries Let G be an abelian group. A function f: G \\\\to \\\\mathbb{C}\\\\setminus\\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\} mapping the group to the non-zero complex numbers is called a character of G if it is a group homomorphism from G to \\\\mathbb C^\\\\times‚Äîthat is, if f(g_1 g_2) = f(g_1)f(g_2) for all g_1, g_2 \\\\in G. If f is a character of a finite group G, then each function value f(g) is a root of unity, since for each g \\\\in G there exists k \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N} such that g^{k} = e, and hence f(g)^{k} = f(g^{k}) = f(e) = 1. Each character f is a constant on conjugacy classes of G, that is, f(hgh‚àí1) = f(g). For this reason, a character is sometimes called a class function. A finite abelian group of order n has exactly n distinct characters. These are denoted by f1, ..., fn. The function f1 is the trivial representation, which is given by f_1(g) = 1 for all g \\\\in G. It is called the principal character of G; the others are called the non-principal characters.  Definition  If G is a abelian group, then the set of characters fk forms an abelian group under pointwise multiplication. That is, the product of characters f_j and f_k is defined by (f_j f_k)(g)= f_j(g) f_k(g) for all g \\\\in G. This group is the character group of G and is sometimes denoted as \\\\hat{G}. The identity element of \\\\hat{G} is the principal character f1, and the inverse of a character fk is its reciprocal 1/fk. If G is finite of order n, then \\\\hat{G} is also of order n. In this case, since f_k(g) = 1 for all g \\\\in G, the inverse of a character is equal to the complex conjugate.  Orthogonality of characters  Consider the n \\\\times n matrix A = A(G) whose matrix elements are A_{jk} = f_j(g_k) where g_k is the kth element of G. The sum of the entries in the jth row of A is given by :\\\\sum_{k=1}^n A_{jk} = \\\\sum_{k=1}^n f_j(g_k) = 0 if j eq 1, and :\\\\sum_{k=1}^n A_{1k} = n. The sum of the entries in the kth column of A is given by :\\\\sum_{j=1}^n A_{jk} = \\\\sum_{j=1}^n f_j(g_k) = 0 if k eq 1, and :\\\\sum_{j=1}^n A_{j1} = \\\\sum_{j=1}^n f_j(e) = n. Let A^\\\\ast denote the conjugate transpose of A. Then :AA^\\\\ast = A^\\\\ast A = nI. This implies the desired orthogonality relationship for the characters: i.e., :\\\\sum_{k=1}^n {f_k}^* (g_i) f_k (g_j) = n \\\\delta_{ij} , where \\\\delta_{ij} is the Kronecker delta and f^*_k (g_i) is the complex conjugate of f_k (g_i).

It was founded in East Germany in 1945 and continued publication after reunification. History and profile Berliner Zeitung was first published on 21 May 1945 in East Berlin. The paper, a center-left daily, is published by Berliner Verlag. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the paper was bought by Gruner + Jahr and the British publisher Robert Maxwell. Gruner + Jahr later became sole owners and relaunched it in 1997 with a completely new design. A stated goal was to turn the Berliner Zeitung into \\"Germany's Washington Post\\". The daily says its journalists come \\"from east and west\\", and it styles itself as a \\"young, modern and dynamic\\" paper for the whole of Germany. It is the only East German paper to achieve national prominence since reunification. In 2003, the Berliner was Berlin's largest subscription newspaper‚Äîthe weekend edition sells approximately 207,800 copies, with a readership of 468,000. The current editor-in-chief is Brigitte Fehrle. Gruner + Jahr decided to leave the newspaper business and sold the Berliner Zeitung in 2002 to the publishing group Georg von Holtzbrinck. This sale was blocked by the German antitrust authorities since Holtzbrinck already owned another major Berlin newspaper, Der Tagesspiegel. The Berliner Zeitung was then sold in the fall of 2005 for an estimated 150‚Äì180 million euros to the British company Mecom Group and the American company Veronis Suhler Stevenson. The employees criticized this sale vehemently, fearing that journalistic quality could suffer as a result of excessive profit expectations by Mecom boss David Montgomery. The Berliner Zeitung was the first German newspaper to fall under the control of foreign investors.Brooks (2005) Andrew Marr, former editor of The Independent, which like the Berliner Zeitung was taken over by David Montgomery, said of the Berliner Zeitung that \\"[a]nyone who was working at The Independent in the mid to late Nineties will find all this wearisomely familiar. David's obsession at that time was removing as much traditional reporting as possible from the paper and turning it into a tabloid-style scandal sheet for yuppies.\\"As quoted in a 2006 article The Independent (Elkins and Burrell 2006). On 23 March 2009, it was announced that the Berliner Verlag would be sold by Mecom to the publisher M. DuMont Schauberg (MDS) in Cologne. The price was about 152 million Euro. Mecom was forced to sell its publishing interests in Germany as well as Norway because of heavy debts. Holger Friedrich and his wife Silke bought the Berliner Verlag in September 2019 from M. DuMont Schaumberg. This company published beside Berliner Zeitung also Berliner Kurier and Berliner Abendblatt.https://kress.de/news/detail/beitrag/143584-berliner-verleger- silke-und-holger-friedrich-wir-sind-branchenfremd-aber-sehen-das-als- chance.html Friedrich wrote in the first number after he bought Berliner Zeitung, that their vision was to make politics and society more interesting again.

It is written in first-person narrative from the viewpoint of Nevare Burvelle and follows his life through his first year in the King's Cavalla Academy. Plot summary Young Nevare Burvelle is the second son of a second son in the fantasy nation of Gernia. According to Gernian religious practice, firstborn noble sons are heir to the family fortunes, second sons bear swords as soldiers, and third sons are consecrated to the priesthood. Holy Writ specifies other roles as well for subsequent sons. Nevare will follow his father ‚Äì newly made a lord by the King ‚Äì into the Cavalla (cavalry); to the frontier and thence to an advantageous marriage to carry on the Burvelle name. It is a golden future, and Nevare looks forward to it with relish. From the age of eight, Nevare is schooled daily in math, physics, engineering, and of course combat and military strategy. With the help of Sergeant Duril, a man who once served under Nevare's father, he learns to live off the land and survive in the harsh plains environment. For twenty years King Troven's cavalla have pushed the frontiers of Gernia out across the grasslands by building King's Road, Troven's vision of future trade with the east, and also subduing the fierce tribes of the plain on its way. Now they have driven the frontier as far as the Barrier Mountains, home to the enigmatic Speck people. The specks ‚Äì a light sensitive, dapple-skinned, forest-dwelling folk ‚Äì are said to retain vestiges of magic in a world which is becoming progressive and technologised. The 'civilised' peoples base their convictions on a rational philosophy founded on their belief in the good god, who displaced the older deities of their world. To them, the Specks are primeval savages, little better than beasts. Superstitions abound; it is said that they harbour strange diseases and worship trees. Sexual congress with them is regarded as both filthy and foolhardy, though not unheard of; the Speck plague, which has ravaged the frontier, has decimated entire regiments. During Nevare's youth, his father hires a man named Dewara, a plainsman of the Kidona tribe and a former enemy of Lord Burvelle, to teach Nevare things he cannot learn from a friendly tutor. After a grueling set of lessons, Dewara offers Nevare the chance to \\"become a Kidona\\" by participating in a ritual and killing an enemy of the Kidona. During the ritual, Dewara places a dried poisonous toad in Nevare's mouth and Nevare experiences a vision. The vision involves Nevare crossing a strangely constructed series of bridges and culminates in a meeting with Tree Woman. Dewara urges Nevare to kill her, because she is the enemy. However, Nevare falls off the final bridge and only with Tree Woman's aid can he survive. He accepts her assistance and as payment, she claims him as her weapon to halt the destruction of her people. Nevare awakens at his father's house, nearly dead from beating and exposure and missing a patch of hair and skin from his scalp. Soon after his 18th birthday, Nevare heads to the King's Cavalla Academy to begin his formal training. His upbringing and tutors' lessons serve him well at the Academy, but his progress there is not as simple as he would wish. He experiences prejudice from the old aristocracy; as the son of a 'new noble' he is segregated into a patrol comprising other new nobles' sons, all of whom will encounter injustice, discrimination and foul play in that hostile and deeply competitive environment. In addition, his world view will be challenged by his unconventional girl-cousin Epiny; and by the bizarre dreams which visit him at night. And then, on Dark Evening, the carnival comes to Old Thares, bringing with it the first Specks Nevare has ever seen... This first contact proves to be a dramatic one, as the other self of Nevare comes to the fore and instructs the Specks to do the \\"dust dance\\". This dance, which consists of the dancers showering the on-lookers with dust, results in a widespread Speck plague both in the Academy of the cavalla and in Old Thares. Seized by a fever, Nevare finds himself once again crossing the bridge sealed by his own sword during the ritual set up by Dewara. He is not alone however, as he finds himself with what appears to be ghostly forms of all the people dying from the plague, including notably Caulder, and Spink. He does not end his crossing, as he is expelled from that realm, as Tree woman still needs him in the physical world. Joined by Epiny in the infirmary, Nevare finds Spink dying next to him. Aided by his cousin, he journeys once more to the bridge in what ends up to be a climactic battle between him, his other self and the Tree woman. Despite the odds stacked against him, he manages to turn the tide of the battle by retrieving his sword, the \\"iron magic of his people\\". The bridge disappears and Nevare manages to slash the Tree woman, allowing Epiny to save his friend, before being once more expelled. Nevare eventually recovers and this part of the story ends as he finds himself returning to the Academy.

He has produced and directed over 350 visual effects sequences and main title sequences across a broad array of film and various broadcast mediums.  Early life and education  = Childhood = Cooper was born on a Friday the 13th in Salem, Massachusetts. As a child, Cooper spent his days obsessed with sketching monsters. He was also fascinated by comic books, monster makeup books, and horror movies. Cooper stated in an interview with Revert to Saved that he had always wanted to be a film director, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always been interested in film and editing‚Äîmore specifically, the juxtaposition of images in film or on a single page. However, I felt it more comprehensive to tell stories over time. Print design can provide great single moments, but I wanted to work with a sequence that had a beginning, middle and end\\". = Education = When it came time for Cooper to go to college, he attended the University of Massachusetts Amherst, studying interior architecture. While on the brink of failing, he convinced his professor to let him pass by making a promise -- that he would never actually work as an interior designer. Cooper then went on to earn his Master of Fine Arts in graphic design at Yale University in 1988. He studied independently with renowned American modernist Paul Rand during his time there. Cooper wrote his thesis on director Sergei Eisenstein, and was awarded the Mohawk Paper Traveling Fellowship to complete his thesis research in the then Soviet Union.  Career  = Early work = After graduating with his M.F.A. from the Yale School of Art, Cooper went on to work at R/GA (then known as R/Greenberg Associates) from 1988 to 1996, first in New York City and then Los Angeles. During this period, Cooper created the title sequence for the 1995 American crime film Seven (1995 film), a seminal work which received critical acclaim and is credited for inspring a number of younger designers for years to come. According to Cooper, at the time he made the title sequence for Seven, main title sequences were behind what was happening in print, music videos, and commercials. Cooper has stated he aimed to create main titles that would raise the bar creatively for future title sequences. = Founded companies = In 1996, Cooper founded Imaginary Forces with Peter Frankfurt and Chip Houghton. Imaginary Forces went on to become one of the most successful creative agencies in Hollywood that came out of the West Coast division of R/GA. ‚ÄúWe have spent a long time building and refining a brilliant creative and production team‚Ä¶ Keeping this group together as our own company is truly exciting,‚Äù commented Cooper about the name change. Too involved by the business side of running a design company the size of Imaginary Forces, Cooper decided it was time for him to focus more on his creative work. In 2003, Cooper left imaginary forces and founded Prologue, a creative agency in which he works in a small team while concentrating on creating title sequences. = Influences = Cooper has claimed his greatest influence in his choice of profession is Stephen Frankfurt‚Äôs opening title sequence for To Kill a Mockingbird (film). Cooper also pulls inspiration from William Shakespeare ‚Äì his former production company, Imaginary Forces, takes its name from a line in the prologue of Shakespeare's Henry V (play). The idea to name the company after this prologue is based on the idea that opening titles often act like a prologue to a film. This of course can also be seen as an influence for his current company, ‚ÄúPrologue‚Äù. All that said, Wired (magazine) notes Cooper isn‚Äôt typically hired due to a signature ‚Äústyle‚Äù. He‚Äôs hired to \\"dig under the celluloid and tap into the symbolism of a film\\". This was a precedent he started with some of his earliest work, notably Seven (1995 film).  Awards and acclaim  Details magazine credits Cooper with ‚Äúalmost single- handedly revitalizing the main title sequence as an art form‚Äù. Los Angeles magazine calls him the ‚ÄúDa Vinci of main titles‚Äù. He is ‚Äúone of the top 50 biggest and best creative thinkers from the last 20 years of advertising and consumer culture,‚Äù according to Creativity magazine. Wired magazine states, ‚ÄúNot since Saul Bass‚Äô legendary preludes ‚Ä¶ have credits attracted such attention‚Äù. Cooper is a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and holds the title of honorary Royal Designer for Industry from the Royal Society of Arts in London. He has seven Emmy nominations and two wins. In 2014, he was also the recipient of the lifetime achievement medal from the American Institute of Graphic Arts, recognizing him for designing title sequences for film and television with a ‚Äúbold and unexpected style‚Äù.

He became a Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church in 1591, and briefly acted as regent of the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza for his nephew Odoardo from 1622 to 1626. Portrait by Annibale Caracci. Cardinals Alessandro and Odoardo Farnese Cardinal Odoardo is probably best known today for commissioning the Bolognese artist Annibale Carracci to fresco the Camerino in the Palazzo Farnese in Rome. Carracci undertook this from 1595 to 1597, just prior to starting his decoration of the more famous and elaborate Farnese Gallery in the same palace. The Camerino was Farnese's private study. The subject of the central scene in the ceiling is The Choice of Hercules. The scene is surrounded by a painted frame, an example of quadro riportato, which gives the illusion of a framed oil painting hung on the ceiling when in reality both the scene and its frame were frescoed. This quadro riportato device was brought to fruition by Carracci in the Farnese Gallery a few years later. In addition, Farnese commissioned various oil paintings from Carracci, including his Rinaldo and Armida now in the Capodimonte Museum in Naples and Christ in Glory with Saints and Odoardo Farnese now in the Galleria Palatina in Florence. It was on Carracci's recommendation that he commissioned Domenichino to fresco the Chapel of St Nilo in the abbey at Grottaferrata.Robertson, Clare.

Abuelita is a brand of chocolate tablets, syrup, or powdered mix in individual packets, made by Nestl√© and used to make Mexican-style hot chocolate, also known as chocolate para parties (English: \\"table chocolate\\"). It was originally invented and commercialized in Mexico since 1939, by F√°brica de Chocolates La Azteca. The name is an affectionate Spanish word for \\"grandma\\" (literally translated as \\"little grandmother\\" or \\"granny\\"). Since 1973, Mexican actress Sara Garc√≠a has been the image for the brand before it was acquired by the Swiss company in the 1990s. The chocolate usually comes in round tablets that can be split into 1/8 or 1/4-disc wedges, and then melted into milk. The drink can also be mixed with spirits such as Kahl√∫a.The product ingredients (in order of percentage): sugar, chocolate processed with alkali, soy lecithin, vegetable oils (palm, shea nut and/or illipe nut), artificial cinnamon flavor, PGPR (an emulsifier). Abuelita has been a staple Mexican product for more than 60 years, and can be identified by its unique taste and packaging. One suggested method for preparing Abuelita is to bring a saucepan of milk (not water) to a boil, and add the tablet of chocolate and stir continuously with a whisk or molinillo (a whisk-like wooden stirring spoons native to Meso America) until melted and frothy or creamy. The drink is served hot, or chilled in preparation for mixing with alcoholic drinks.

Its name is derived from the Dutch Aal Plaats, or \\"Place of the Eels.\\" Alplaus is in the southeast corner of the town of Glenville. Some consider it part of the hamlet of East Glenville; however, it is generally recognized as a separate community. Alplaus is, however, part of the East Glenville census- designated place. Census data for the ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) associated with Alplaus for the 2000 census had a total population of 431 people in 175 households. Alplaus has a Residents Association (ARA) which helps coordinate activities within the hamlet and manage relationships with town, county, and state government.  Geography  Since Alplaus is not an incorporated area, its borders are not specific. Some consider the ZIP Code 12008 to define Alplaus, while others may say it is the Alplaus volunteer fire department (officially known as Glenville Fire District #2). Alplaus is located at . It has an elevation of approximately at the Mohawk River. Rexford, a hamlet in the town of Clifton Park in Saratoga County, borders Alplaus to the east. The Mohawk River borders on the south. Generally, the Glenridge and Schenectady Country Airport represents the western border. The major natural feature of the hamlet is the Alplaus Kill (creek), which is a tributary to the Mohawk River. There is one main road (Alplaus Avenue), with several streets branching from it. On this road in the center of the hamlet are two important community facilities: the post office and the fire station.  Airports  The Schenectady County Airport (FAA code KSCH) lies partially within Alplaus. The Stratton Air National Guard Base is located on this airport. The 109th Airlift Wing, based at Stratton, supports Arctic and Antarctic operations using C-130 aircraft. The Wells Seaplane Base (FAA id 94D) is located at the Mohawk Marina near the mouth of the Alplaus Kill.

Historically it was part of Westmorland. The town lies on the A685, surrounded by sparsely populated hill country and about from the nearest larger towns: Kendal and Penrith. The River Eden rises away in the peat bogs below Hugh Seat and passes by the eastern edge of the town. Kirkby Stephen has a parish council and acts as a centre for surrounding villages and parishes, including Nateby, Ravenstonedale and Mallerstang. A community and council centre in the library provides information and services for all local councils (county, district and parish). Town geography and history =Parish church= =Schools= There are primary schools in Kirkby Stephen and in the neighbouring parishes of Brough and Ravenstonedale. Secondary education for the town and surrounding area is provided by Kirkby Stephen Grammar School. This was founded in 1566 by Thomas Wharton, 1st Baron Wharton, under letters patent granted by Queen Elizabeth I. Although it has retained the name \\"grammar school\\", its old buildings were replaced long ago, and it is now a comprehensive school and Sports College with approximately 410 pupils. Within the grounds of the grammar school there was at one time an open-air swimming pool built in the 1960s for the school and local community, which was open from May to August to members of the Kirkby Stephen and District Swimming Club and to visitors to the area. =Market= In 1352‚Äì1353, Roger de Clifford, Baron of Westmorland, obtained a charter from King Edward III for a market and two annual fairs to be held in the town. This was reaffirmed by a charter granted in 1605 to George, Earl of Cumberland, by King James I, for \\"one market on Monday and two fairs yearly; one on the Wednesday, Thursday and Friday after Whitsuntide and the other on the two days next before the feast of St. Luke.\\" The Monday market, with livestock sales at the Mart in Faraday Road and stalls on Market Square, remains an important event in the town and surrounding countryside. There were special celebrations to mark the 400th anniversary of the King James charter. St Luke's Fair, or \\"Charter Day\\", is celebrated every year at the end of October, when the Charter is read at the \\"Charter Stone\\" in Market Street. The special \\"Tup sales\\", very important in this sheep-rearing area, still take place at around this time each year. =Other facilities= The town has a range of shops: several antique shops, restaurants, caf√©s, pubs, and an Upper Eden Visitor Centre. Kirkby Stephen has won several awards from Cumbria/Britain in Bloom. Kirkby Stephen serves as a base for tourism in the Upper Eden Valley area and for walking tours of the Valley. It is on the route of the Coast to Coast Walk, devised by Alfred Wainwright,A Wainwright, Wainwright's Coast to Coast Walk, Michael Joseph, 1987. Each June there is held the \\"Mallerstang Horseshoe and Nine Standards Yomp\\", which takes a strenuous route along the high ground on both sides of the neighbouring dale of Mallerstang, including Wild Boar Fell and the summit of nearby Nine Standards Rigg. The surrounding countryside attracts walkers. There is a Kirkby Stephen Mountain Rescue Team to assist those not fully prepared for harsh conditions on the fell tops. Faraday connection It is sometimes said that Faraday Road (parallel with High Street and Market Street) is named in honour of the scientist, Michael Faraday (1791‚Äì1867), but in fact it remembers his uncle, Richard Faraday, who was a respected local tradesman. Richard's younger brother James was for some time the blacksmith in Outhgill, but his third child, Michael, was born soon after they had moved to London. The Faraday brothers moved from Clapham in the West Riding to the Kirkby Stephen area because the family were all members of the Sandemanian sect, and at that time there was locally one of the few Sandemanian communities with a chapel, which stood in the courtyard behind what are now the Costa Coffee premises. Governance Kirkby Stephen is in the parliamentary constituency of Penrith and the Border. Neil Hudson was elected its Conservative Member of Parliament at the 2019 General Election, replacing Rory Stewart. Before Brexit, the town was in the North West England European Parliamentary Constituency. An electoral ward in the same name exists. This stretches south to Aisgill, with a total population at the 2011 Census of 2,580. Scenic highlights thumb *Stenkrith Park is to the south of the town, on the B6259 road to Nateby. The river scenery marks a change from limestone at the head of the Eden Valley in Mallerstang to the red sandstone characteristic further along the Eden Valley. The main rock, from which most houses in Kirkby Stephen are built, is brockram, composed of fragments of limestone in a cement of red sandstone. The river at Stenkrith has carved this rock into many fantastic shapes, collectively known as the Devil's Grinding Mill or Devil's Hole. This natural scenery has been supplemented, in recent years, by three human additions. *The 'Poetry Path' has 12 stones, which were carved by the artist Pip Hall and bear poems by Meg Peacock that depict a year in the life of a hill farmer. *Eden Benchmarks: Beside the river there is a sculpture by Laura White, entitled 'Passage', one of the ten \\"Eden Benchmarks\\", a series of sculptures that have been placed at intervals along the River Eden from its source in Mallerstang to the Solway Firth. *The Millennium Bridge was opened in 2002 and provides pedestrian access from the park to a walk along the old south Durham railway track. Among many other scenic features in the area are: Nine Standards Rigg to the north-east Pendragon Castle and Wild Boar Fell, to the south. Unlike neighbouring Brough, Kirkby shows no evidence of Roman settlement, but there are many traces of even more ancient eras in the area, including the remains of a large Iron Age earthwork or hill fort known as Croglam Castle, on the south-eastern edge of the town. Railways Kirkby Stephen West station, on the Settle‚ÄìCarlisle line, is located over south-west of the town. The line keeps to high ground, avoiding any descent into the valleys where possible. A second, older railway station is Kirkby Stephen East station at the southern edge of the town. Originally a large junction of the South Durham & Lancashire Union Railway and the Eden Valley Railway, the station was reopened by the Stainmore Railway Company in August 2011 as a heritage centre and operational railway representing the 1950s. It is open to visitors every weekend.

The vessel entered service in 1979 as Franklin and was renamed Sir John Franklin in 1980 and served as such until 1996. Declared surplus, the vessel was used as an accommodation ship in Labrador in 1996 and placed in reserve in 2000. In 2003, the ship was reactivated and underwent conversion to an Arctic research vessel. The ship recommissioned as Amundsen. Design and description The Pierre Radisson class were designed for Coast Guard operations in the Arctic Ocean.Maginley and Collin, p. 154 Amundsen has a standard displacement of and is fully loaded. The vessel has a gross tonnage of 5,911 and a net tonnage of 1,678. The ship is long overall with a beam of and a draught of .Saunders, p. 95 The vessel is propelled by two fixed-pitch propellers and one bow thruster powered by a diesel-electric system comprising six Alco M251F diesel engines that when driving the shafts create and six GEC generators creating 11.1 megawatts sustained powering two motors that when driving the shafts create . Amundsen is also equipped with one Caterpillar 398 emergency generator. This gives the vessel a maximum speed of . The vessel can carry of diesel fuel and has a range of at and can stay at sea for up to 100 days. Amundsen is equipped with a Sperry navigational radar operating on the E/F and I bands. The icebreaker has a flight deck and hangar and can carry one light helicopter of the MBB Bo 105 or Bell 206L types. The vessel is certified as Arctic Class 3 and has a complement of 31 with 11 officers and 20 crew. Amundsen has an additional 51 berths. Operational history The ship's keel was laid down 4 January 1977 by Burrard Dry Dock at their yard in North Vancouver, British Columbia with the yard number 222. The ship was launched on 10 March 1978 and entered in Coast Guard service in March 1979. The ship was named Franklin in honour of Arctic explorer Sir John Franklin. After completing the vessel performed sea trials in the western Arctic and Northwest Passage. While transiting the Northwest Passage, heading to the icebreaker's assigned base in Newfoundland, Franklin lost a propeller in Viscount Melville Sound and was rescued by and returned to the west coast. The two ships then transited to the East Coast of Canada via the Panama Canal.Maginley and Collin, p. 155Maginley, p. 126 In 1980, the vessel was renamed to Sir John Franklin at the request of the crew. The ship worked out of CCG Base Dartmouth and CCG Base Quebec City for most of the 1980s and 1990s, being tasked to winter icebreaking operations in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and St. Lawrence River and off Newfoundland. During the summer season, Sir John Franklin was often tasked to support the annual Arctic Summer Sealift operation for escorting cargo ships to remote port communities in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. In 1981, Sir John Franklin was used to test Coast Guard procedures in the oil spill exercise called \\"Baffin Island Oil Spill\\". In 1987, the ship escorted the Arctic cargo ship/oil tanker to Nanisivik. In July 1989, the icebreaker again attempted to transit the Northwest Passage but was forced to break off the attempt after ice conditions were found to be too severe. In June 1994, at the height of the Turbot War, Sir John Franklin was among the Coast Guard vessels sent to monitor the European fishing fleets on the Grand Banks. The ship was kept just out of sight but within radar range of foreign fishing trawlers. These actions led to the detainment and seizure of the Spanish fishing trawler Estai.Maginley, pp. 126, 129‚Äì30, 195 =Decommissioning= Following the 1995 transfer of the Canadian Coast Guard from the Department of Transport to the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, Sir John Franklin was deemed surplus to the fleet in 1996. That summer, she was contracted to Newfoundland-based shipping company Canship for use as an accommodations vessel during exploration work at a coastal nickel deposit at Voisey's Bay in northern Labrador. She was subsequently decommissioned from the Canadian Coast Guard in 2000 and placed in non-operational reserve. =Conversion to Arctic research vessel= Amundsen in May 2013, finishing refit at Port Weller, Ontario In 2001, the Canadian Coast Guard announced that it could not provide an icebreaker for research purposes in the Arctic that year. This led to several scientific groups looking for a possible replacement. In 2002, a consortium of Canadian universities and federal departments submitted a proposal to convert Sir John Franklin into an Arctic Ocean research vessel. The proposal was accepted and the ship given new life in August 2003 after funding was received for the new dedicated research vessel. The total cost for the refit was CAN$30.7 million with $27.7 million provided by the Canadian Foundation for Innovation and $3 million provided by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. The ship was towed from St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador and underwent the 10-month conversion of Sir John Franklin at a shipyard in Les Mechins, Quebec. There, part of the vessel's storage holds were transformed into laboratory space. The refit included the addition of a moon pool, which enables scientists to lower scientific instruments from inside the hull without cutting a hole in the ice, multi-beam sonar, the replacement of heating and electrical systems, and installation of state-of-the-art scientific equipment. The vessel was recommissioned into the Canadian Coast Guard as Amundsen, named in honour of Arctic explorer Roald Amundsen, on 26 August 2003. Amundsens sponsor was Lily Schreyer, the sponsor of Franklin when the vessel first entered service. The ship remained the property of the Canadian Coast Guard and continues to support Coast Guard functions but is the dedicated science platform for scientists in the Arctic. =Return to service= Shortly after re-entering service, Amundsen began its career as a research vessel, departing for King William Sound. The ship remained in the Arctic for 398 days, split over two missions, an expedition to the Beaufort Sea and the other in support of Inuit communities in Nunavik. In 2004, Amundsen became the first Canadian vessel to offer hospital services to the Aboriginal peoples living in remote locations in Canada's north since the controversial was taken out of service in 1970. The ship supports ArcticNet's marine-based research program. In July 2007, Amundsen departed for a 15-month expedition to the Canadian Arctic to work on several projects. In 2009, the ship was sent to collect new environmental data in the Beaufort Sea in co- operation with the oil exploitation sector. In August 2010, Amundsen responded to 27 August grounding of the cruise liner Clipper Adventurer in the Coronation Gulf. Arriving on 29 August, the icebreaker took off the 120 passengers and crew and brought them to Kugluktuk, arriving on 30 August. In 2011, it was announced that an image of the vessel would be placed on the backside of the new Canadian 50 Dollar polymer banknote. This was intended to mark Canada's northern frontier and arctic research. In December 2011 a routine maintenance inspection discovered dangerous cracking in four of her six engines. The engines required immediate replacement, and she was unavailable throughout 2012. Amundsen departed on 26 July 2013 for deployment in the Arctic. The helicopter attached to Amundsen crashed in the Arctic on 9 September 2013, with a loss of three lives, including the commander, the helicopter pilot and an academic from the University of Manitoba. In July 2015, Amundsen was redirected from a 115-day science cruise to northern Baffin Bay to aid resupply ships for northern communities which were navigating heavy ice in Hudson Bay. On 24 August 2018, Amundsen was directed to assist Akademik Ioffe, a cruise ship that had run aground in the western Gulf of Boothia. Once on the scene, Amundsen and her helicopter were used to transfer passengers from the cruise ship to Akademik Ioffes sister ship Akademik Sergey Vavilov.

He explained why the Israeli operation was necessary and why it needed to end: \\"Precisely because the Gazans are our neighbors, we need to be proportionate in this operation. We need to try to reach a cease-fire as quickly as possible. We will always be neighbors, so the less blood is shed, the better the future will be.

Consortium HIRLAM programme is a cooperation between following European meteorological institutes: * Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI)(Denmark) * Estonian Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (EMHI) (Estonia) * Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI) (Finland) * Icelandic Meteorological Office (IMO) (Iceland) * Lithuanian Hydrological and Meteorological Service (LHMS) (Lithuania) * Met √âireann (ME) (Ireland) * Norwegian Meteorological Institute (MET) (Norway) * Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) (The Netherlands) * Agencia Estatal de Meteorolog√≠a (AEMET), formerly INM (Spain) * Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI) (Sweden) In addition, M√©t√©o-France (France) is a research partner in the international HIRLAM cooperation.  The Programme  The aim of the HIRLAM programme is to develop and maintain a numerical short- range weather forecasting system for operational use by the participating institutes. The cooperation, started in September 1985, comprises a series of 3-year projects between 1985 and 2005, and 5-year programmes HIRLAM-A (2006‚Äì2010) and HIRLAM-B (2011‚Äì2015). The collaboration resulted in successful launch of the limited area Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model, HIRLAM forecast system, which has been used in the HIRLAM member services for routine weather prediction of up to 3 days at a grid resolution of 3 to 16 km. Since 2006, the HIRLAM cooperation shifted its focus to the development of meso- scale (convection-permitting) numerical weather prediction system (HARMONIE) through close collaboration with the ALADIN consortium (led by Meteo France) and the ECMWF (European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasting). The HARMONIE forecast system is the main operational weather forecast system at HIRLAM weather services with a typical grid resolution of 2.5 km. Through collaboration with the ALADIN consortium, a 52-ensemble Pan-European Grand Limited Area Ensemble Prediction System (GLAMEPS) has been developed by the HIRLAM programme. With a resolution of ca 8 km grid size GLAMEPS has been operational since 2013, to serve the needs of 2-day probabilistic forecasts at the HIRLAM and ALADIN member services.

The prophet / president of the church is Terry W. Patience. History In the 1970s and 1980s, the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (now called Community of Christ) was criticized from within, by its membership, for various changes in policy and leadership. These issues, among other issues, included female priesthood, the ending of the doctrine of Lineal succession, and the construction of the Independence Temple.Doctrine and Covenants, Section 156 D&C; Section 156 This led to several branches of the RLDS Church to form groups of independent Restoration Branches. In May 1999, several members of these branches met as the Conference of Restoration Elders, including Frederick Niels Larsen, great-grandson of Joseph Smith, Jr. They published the \\"Proclamation and Invitation to the Faithful\\", which led to the creation of the Remnant Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints on April 6, 2000. In April 2002, as a descendant of Joseph Smith, Larsen was chosen to become the President of the High Priesthood of the Remnant Church, and he was sustained as the prophet and president of the church until his death. Larsen died on April 26, 2019. Following his death, Terry Wayne Patience became President of the High Priesthood/Prophet/President of the church on June 29, 2019 during a special conference of the church. Doctrine Conference center and meetinghouse in Independence, Missouri Through its history with the Reorganized Church, the Remnant Church considers itself to be a remnant of the Church of Christ organized by Joseph Smith, Jr. in 1830, and thus the \\"one true church\\". The church has its headquarters near the Temple Lot, across from the Independence Temple (headquarters of the Community of Christ), and within the former William Chrisman High School (built in 1918). The Remnant Church maintains belief in a geophysical \\"Zion\\", a central belief of the Church during the time of Joseph Smith, Jr. Members of the Remnant Church believe that the Inspired Version of the Bible, Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants are sacred texts. The Pearl of Great Price of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as a whole, is not part of the Remnant canon of scripture. The Remnant Church's Doctrine and Covenants shares the same sections as that of Community of Christ up to Section 144 (the last revelation from the presidency of Israel A. Smith). As of 2015, there are an additional 17 sections unique to the Remnant Church, all of which were given through Frederick Larsen. A document outlining their foundational beliefs, as written by Joseph Smith, Jr. is published on the Remnant Church's website as \\"Our Epitome of Faith\\". The Presiding Bishop of the church, W. Kevin Romer, is recognized as a \\"literal descendent of Aaron\\" (cf. Kohanim) and thus holds the unique office of ‚ÄúAaronic High Priest‚Äù. References *Roger D.

The galaxy is one of the few elliptical galaxies proven to have significant amounts of dark matter.

The dark matter halo is estimated to have 10 times the mass of the stars in the galaxy. NGC 4555 is important because of its isolation. Most elliptical galaxies are found in the cores of groups and clusters of galaxies, and almost all those for which dark matter estimates are available are located in the centres of these larger systems. In these circumstances it impossible to know whether the dark matter is associated with the galaxy or the surrounding cluster.

It is published every day but Sunday as a city, two regional and one nationwide issues and offers an online edition (see link below) as well as an e-paper. Local major competitors are the conservative-liberal Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ), the local edition of the conservative tabloid Bild-Zeitung, the best-selling newspaper in Europe, and the smaller local conservative Frankfurter Neue Presse. The Rundschau's layout is modern and its editorial stance is social liberal. It holds that \\"independence, social justice and fairness\\" underlie its journalism. Frankfurter Rundschau Druck and Verlagshaus GmbH filed for bankruptcy on 12 November 2012. Then the paper was acquired by Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and Frankfurter Societ√§t (publisher of the Frankfurter Neue Presse) in 2013, by taking over just 28 full-time journalists.Frankfurter Allgemeine rescues left-leaning rival newspaper Reuters. 28 February 2013. The FR editorial board continues to be bound by the legacy of Karl Gerold and the commitment to a \\"left-liberal\\" political line, and continues to be integrated in the national and international editorial and correspondents network of the DuMont Mediengruppe, the former majority owners. The private foundation managing Karl Gerold's legacy still owns 10% of the shares. But all commercial activity of the paper, printing, selling advertisement and distribution is in the hands of the Frankfurer Societ√§t. The FR printing enterprise was closed. The contracts for printing BILD-Zeitung and other papers went from the FR's printshop to the FAZ's Societ√§tsdruckerei. History and profile Eschenheimer Tor. The Rundschau published its first issue on 1 August 1945 shortly after the end of World War II in Europe. It was the first newspaper published in the US sector in occupied Germany and the third newspaper in post-war Germany. The licence was handed over to the first team of editors consisting of Emil Carlebach, Hans Etzkorn, Wilhelm Karl Gerst, Otto Grossmann, Wilhelm Knothe, Paul Rodemann and Arno Rudert, a progressive think- tank of social democrats, political Catholics and communists, who had spent years in the resistance and Nazi concentration camps or in exile. With the coming of the Cold War, the American occupation authority forced all communist members of the editorial team to leave the paper two years later. The paper was awarded the European Newspaper of the Year in the category of judges' special recognition by the European Newspaper Congress in 2011.. In the 2013 elections the magazine was among the supporters of the Social Democratic Party (SPD). The 1993 circulation of the paper was 189,000 copies. In the first quarter of 2015, the newspaper boasted a circulation of around 70,000 copies. In 2019, the newspaper published an editorial titled \\"The Eternal Netanyahu\\" about Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu. The name evoked a Nazi Germany film titled The Eternal Jew. Ulf Poschardt, editor-in-chief of German newspaper Die Welt, tweeted a condemnation of the Frankfurter Rundschau, as did a top journalist for German newspaper Bild. The Frankfurter Rundschau claimed that the association was accidental. Changes On 30 May 2007 the Rundschau changed its format to the award-winning smaller tabloid size. Restructuring In 2003, the paper had financial difficulties and was supported by a guarantee from the federal state of Hesse. In May 2004 the Deutsche Druck- und Verlagsgesellschaft (DDVG), owned by the SPD, acquired 90 percent of the shares of the Druck- und Verlagshaus Frankfurt am Main (DuV), the publisher of the FR until then. The social democrats emphasized that they wanted to assure the future of one of the few left-liberal daily newspapers in Germany and asserted they would not exert influence on the articles. The social democrats also announced that they wanted to reduce their share to under 50 percent until 2006. In order to save the paper from insolvency, the DDVG soon drastically cut back expenditures. By means of dismissals and outsourcing, the number of employees shrank within the last three years from 1700 to 750. Amid speculation on DDVG's complaints about too friendly articles on the new left party Die Linke and its plan to sell the majority of its shares (see article in the newspaper Junge Welt from 30 August 2007) Wolfgang Storz's term as editor-in-chief ended abruptly on 16 May 2006. The appointed next editor-in-chief was Uwe Vork√∂tter (effective 1 July 2006). Only a few days later, on 18 July 2007, the DDVG announced that it would sell 50 percent plus one share to the independent publishing company M. DuMont Schauberg based in Cologne, Germany. Today, DuMont Schauberg holds 50 percent plus one share, the DDVG owns 40 percent and the Karl-Gerold-Foundation holds 10 percent of the newspaper.

It is considered by some to have been the unofficial national anthem of the Confederate States of America. The commonly heard version was composed by Charles W. A. Ellerbrock, while C. T. De C≈ìni√©l later composed a different tune for the song.  History  \\"God Save The South\\" was written in 1861 by Miles as Ernest Halphim with the music for it being composed by Charles Wolfgang Amadeus Ellerbrock. Halphim wrote it with the intent to inspire Confederate soldiers during the American Civil War that God would be with them. It was also written as an intent to counter the Union's usage of the newly-written \\"Battle Hymn of the Republic\\" as a rallying hymn. It was also used as a way to develop a unique Southern national culture to distinguish the Confederate States from the United States. When it was published in New Orleans, it was the first song published in the Confederate States since the Ordinance of Secession. The hymn was later included in the Confederate hymnal, The Soldier's Companion given to all Confederate soldiers during the war. \\"God Save The South\\" is considered as the national anthem for the Confederate States and was published in Virginia with the subtitle of \\"Our national Confederate anthem\\" with the image of a Confederate soldier carrying the Stainless Banner with \\"God Save The South\\" on it. However, \\"Dixie\\" was popular amongst Confederate soldiers and citizens and thus was a marching song and parade song of Confederate troops. However, in 1950 Richard Harwell wrote: \\"[Dixie] can hardly be said to meet the requirements of a national anthem, [although] it has become a truly national tune, permanently enshrined in the hearts of Americans in both the North and the South. That honor rightly belongs to 'God Save the South' not just by virtue of its status as the new nation's first published song but also because of its stirring poetry and its outstanding musical setting.\\"  Composition  While the anthem mostly used Ellerbrock's music, it was also set to the tune of the British national anthem, \\"God Save the Queen\\". Because of this association, as well as a perceived lack of originality, ‚ÄúGod Save the South‚Äù was criticized in Southern Punch, a weekly periodical modeled after Britain‚Äôs Punch. C. T. De C≈ìni√©l also wrote another tune for \\"God Save the South\\" after Ellerbrock's original, which gained popularity at the time. The fifth verse has been used by one writer as an example of the citizens of the Confederacy's perceived affiliation with George Washington, as he was also considered to be a rebel during the American War of Independence.

Lasting almost seven hundred years, it is by some measures the longest-lasting treaty in history. The name comes either from the Egyptian's term for barter, or the Greco-Roman term for pact. History Despite its longevity not much is clear about the baqt and almost all the information about it comes from Muslim sources. The Baqt was signed after the 641 conquest of Egypt by troops coming from the Arabian peninsula. That year, the Hejazi general Abdallah ibn Abi Sarh led an army south against the Christian kingdoms of Nubia. Later Islamic historians state that Nubia was not worth conquering and the expedition was simply to subordinate the region to Egypt. Earlier sources give the more likely story that the Arab armies met a rare defeat at the Battle of Dongola and only acceded to the Baqt when they realized that the conquest of the region would be difficult. The treaty was negotiated between Abi Sarh and the Makurian King Qalidurat. =Provisions= There is no extant copy of the treaty they signed, and the earliest copies are several centuries after the fact and are quite varied. The treaty might not have been written at all and may have just been an oral agreement. Some sections of the baqt are clear: *the Arabs would not attack Nubia and the Nubians would not attack Egypt *the citizens of the two nations would be allowed to freely trade and travel between the two states and would be guaranteed safe passage while in the other nation *immigration to and settlement in the other nation's lands was forbidden *fugitives were to be extradited, as were escaped slaves *the Nubians were responsible for maintaining a mosque for Muslim visitors and residents *the Muslims had no obligation to protect the Nubians from attacks by third parties *The most important provision was that 360 slaves per year were to be sent to Egypt. These slaves had to be of the highest quality, meaning that the elderly and children were excluded. The slaves sent had to be a mix of male and female. In some reports an extra forty were due which were distributed among notables in Egypt. =Sources= Ibn Abd al-Hakam, one of the first historians to discuss the treaty, gives two different versions of the treaty. The first has only Nubia sending slaves north, thus symbolizing its subservience to Egypt. The second version adds an obligation of the Egyptians to also send goods south including wheat and lentils in exchange for the slaves; this would put the two nations on a more equal footing. =Context and consequences= This treaty was unprecedented in the history of the Arab conquests, being more similar to the arrangements the Eastern Roman Empire sometimes made with its neighbours. It is also unmatched in that it largely blocked the spread of Islam and the Arabs for half a millennium. Spaulding reports that the exchange of goods was a common diplomatic arrangement in Northeast Africa and the Nubians would have had long experience with such agreements. The Baqt caused some controversy among Islamic theologians as there was disagreement over whether it violated the duty to expand the borders of Islam. =History of Enforcement= The Baqt was not always without controversy and conflicts between the neighbours were not unheard of. Abbasid period In the 830s, Egypt plunged into civil war and King Zacharias III of Makuria halted payment of the Baqt. When the Abbasid government gained firm control of Egypt, the Abbasids demanded resumption of the Baqt and payment of arrears. Unable or unwilling to pay this large sum Zacharias sent his son and heir Georgios on a long journey to Baghdad in 835 to negotiate directly with the Caliph. This expedition was a great success; the arrears were canceled and the Baqt was altered so that it only had to be paid every three years. Fatimid period The closest relations were during the Fatimid period in Egypt. The Shi'ite Fatimids had few allies in the predominantly Sunni Islamic world, and Nubia was an important ally. The slaves sent from Nubia made up the backbone of the Fatimid army. Ayyubid and Mamluk periods Relations were worse under the Ayyubids and very poor under the Mamluks, with full-scale war eventually breaking out. Even after Makuria collapsed in the thirteenth century, the Egyptians continued to insist upon its payment by the Muslim successor kingdoms in the region. The Baqt finally ended in the mid-fourteenth century with the complete collapse of organized government in the region.

Its face is black, its fur is blackish-brown and it has a relatively short tail. It is a diurnal species, feeding in small groups in the rainforest canopy on leaves, and to a lesser extent, fruit and berries. Little is known of its natural history, but it is heavily hunted, its populations have been declining rapidly and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being \\"critically endangered\\". It has been included on a list of the World's 25 Most Endangered Primates. Description The pig-tailed langur is a large and rather heavily built Old World monkey, adapted to climbing with its long arms. Its fur is black-brown, and its hairless face is also black. It is the only monkey in the subfamily Colobinae to have a relatively short tail; the tail is only slightly furred and is only 15 cm long. The short nose is pointed upward. The pig-tailed langur reaches a full grown length of approximately 50 cm (20 in) and a weight of 7 kg (15.5 lbs). Traditionally, it has been placed in the genus Nasalis together with the proboscis monkey - a treatment still preferred by some.Bradon-Jones, D., A. A. Eudey, T. Geissmann, C. P. Groves, D. J. Melnick, J. C. Morales, M. Shekelle, and C. B. Stewart. 2004. Asian primate classification. International Journal of Primatology. 23: 97-164. Distribution This primate lives only on the Mentawai Islands, where it is known as simakobou in Siberut and simasepsep on the southern islands of Sipura, North Pagai, and South Pagai. Two of these islands, North- and South- Pagai, are its main range. It is a diurnal and arboreal rain forest dweller, rarely coming to the ground. It lives in small groups (3 to 8 animals), which consist of a male, one or more females, and their offspring. Its diet consists mainly of leaves and, to a lesser extent, fruits and berries.

The season officially began on June 16, 1947, and ended on November 1, 1947. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. However, the first tropical cyclone developed on June 13, while the final system was absorbed by a cold front on December 1\\\\. There were 10 tropical storms; 5 of them attained hurricane status, while two became major hurricanes, which are Category 3 or higher on the modern day Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale. Operationally, the third tropical storm was considered two separate tropical cyclones, resulting in the storm receiving two names. The eighth tropical storm went undetected and was not listed in HURDAT until 2014. Nearly all tropical storms impacted land during the season, some of which caused many fatalities and left destruction. The second storm caused severe flooding and mudslides in Mexico, leaving at least 48 dead and 43 others missing. In September, the strongest and costliest hurricane of the season, the Fort Lauderdale hurricane, left severe damage in Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi due to strong winds, heavy rainfall, and abnormally high tides. There were 51 fatalities and about $160.2 million (1947 USD) in damage. The ninth storm, also known as the Cape Sable hurricane, caused additional flooding in South Florida and left wind damage in Georgia and South Carolina. The storm left about $20 million in damage. Overall, the systems of the season caused about $184.2 million in damage and at least 101 fatalities. __TOC__ Season summary ImageSize = width:800 height:200 PlotArea = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20 Legend = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270 AlignBars = early DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/06/1947 till:01/01/1948 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal ScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/06/1947 Colors = id:canvas value:gray(0.88) id:GP value:red id:TD value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1) legend:Tropical_Depression_=_‚â§39_mph_(‚â§62_km/h) id:TS value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96) legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39‚Äì73_mph_(63‚Äì117_km/h) id:C1 value:rgb(1,1,0.80) legend:Category_1_=_74‚Äì95_mph_(118‚Äì153_km/h) id:C2 value:rgb(1,0.91,0.46) legend:Category_2_=_96‚Äì110_mph_(154‚Äì177_km/h) id:C3 value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25) legend:Category_3_=_111‚Äì129_mph_(178‚Äì208_km/h) id:C4 value:rgb(1,0.56,0.13) legend:Category_4_=_130‚Äì156_mph_(209‚Äì251_km/h) id:C5 value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38) legend:Category_5_=_‚â•157_mph_(‚â•252_km/h) Backgroundcolors = canvas:canvas BarData = barset:Hurricane bar:Month PlotData= barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till from:13/06/1947 till:14/06/1947 color:TD text:\\"Depression (TD)\\" from:31/07/1947 till:02/08/1947 color:TS text:\\"Baker (TS)\\" from:09/08/1947 till:16/08/1947 color:C2 text:\\"Charlie (C2)\\" from:18/08/1947 till:27/08/1947 color:C1 text:\\"Dog-Easy (C1)\\" from:01/09/1947 till:02/09/1947 color:TD text:\\"Depression (TD)\\" from:04/09/1947 till:21/09/1947 color:C4 text:\\"George (C4)\\" from:07/09/1947 till:09/09/1947 color:TS text:\\"Fox (TS)\\" barset:break from:15/09/1947 till:30/09/1947 color:TD text:\\"Depression (TD)\\" from:20/09/1947 till:26/09/1947 color:TS text:\\"How (TS)\\" from:07/10/1947 till:09/10/1947 color:TS text:\\"Item (TS)\\" from:08/10/1947 till:11/10/1947 color:TS text:\\"Eight (TS)\\" from:08/10/1947 till:16/10/1947 color:C2 text:\\"King (C2)\\" from:17/10/1947 till:22/10/1947 color:C3 text:\\"Love (C3)\\" from:25/10/1947 till:26/10/1947 color:TD text:\\"Depression (TD)\\" barset:break from:28/11/1947 till:01/12/1947 color:TD text:\\"Depression (TD)\\" bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas from:01/06/1947 till:01/07/1947 text:June from:01/07/1947 till:01/08/1947 text:July from:01/08/1947 till:01/09/1947 text:August from:01/09/1947 till:01/10/1947 text:September from:01/10/1947 till:01/11/1947 text:October from:01/11/1947 till:01/12/1947 text:November from:01/12/1947 till:01/01/1948 text:December TextData = pos:(570,30) text:\\"(From the\\" pos:(617,30) text:\\"Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale)\\" The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 16, 1947. However, tropical cyclogenesis began with the development of a tropical depression on June 13. There was a total of seven tropical storms, five of them strengthened into hurricanes, while two of those became major hurricanes - Category 3 or higher on the modern day Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale. The final system, a tropical depression, was absorbed by a cold front on December 1, one month after the official end of the season on November 1, 1947. Four hurricanes and four tropical storms made landfall during the season. Overall, the tropical cyclones of this season caused about $184.2 million in damage and at least 101 fatalities.  The United States death toll of 53 was low compared to 20 years earlier in spite of the Fort Lauderdale (George) and Cape Sable (King) hurricanes crossing urban areas. The Weather Bureau attributed this to adequate warnings from the hurricane warning office and mass evacuations. A then-record total of 159 bulletins were issued from Weather Bureau offices. The first tropical cyclone of the season, a tropical depression, existed from June 13 to June 14\\\\. However, activity went dormant for over a month and a half. On July 31, Baker developed in the Gulf of Mexico. In August, two tropical storms developed - Charlie and Dog-Easy. September featured five tropical cyclones, including Fox, George, and How, as well as two tropical depressions. George, more commonly known as the Fort Lauderdale hurricane, was the most intense tropical cyclone of the season, peaking as a Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 145 mph (230 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . October also had five tropical cyclone, including Item, King, Love, an unnamed storm, and a tropical depression. With four tropical storms, this was the most in the month of October since 1933. The season's final tropical cyclone, a depression, developed on November 28 and was absorbed by a cold front on December 1. The season's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 88. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39 mph (63 km/h), which is tropical storm strength. Systems =Tropical Storm One (Baker)= A low pressure area in the Bay of Campeche developed into a tropical depression at 06:00 UTC on July 31. Moving north-northwestward, the depression deepened into a tropical storm six hours later. The storm, identified as \\"Baker\\" by the United States Air Force, then intensified slowly and gradually curved to the northwest. At 00:00 UTC on August 2, the storm attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . The latter was observed at Port Isabel, Texas, while the former was estimated based on the pressure-wind relationship. Simultaneously, Baker made landfall in Tamaulipas about south of the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border. The system weakened to a tropical depression by 12:00 UTC on August 2 and dissipated near Reynosa shortly thereafter. Small craft were advised between the lower and middle coast of Texas were advised to remain in port. The American Red Cross recommended that residents of Port Aransas evacuate as a precaution, but mainly only tourists in the area fled. Most of the damage was done to cotton crops, due to heavy rainfall, with up to observed at Raymondville. However, the precipitation was more beneficial than damaging. The storm caused just over $2 million in damage. =Hurricane Two (Charlie)= A tropical depression developed about 125 mi (200 km) north-northwest of Colombia early on August 9\\\\. The depression moved northwestward across the Caribbean Sea and remained weak for a few days, before reaching tropical storm status on 00:00 UTC on August 12\\\\. About 16 hours later, the cyclone - known to the United States Air Force as Tropical Storm Charlie - made landfall near Punta Allen, Quintana Roo, with winds of . After entering the Bay of Campeche on August 13, the system resumed strengthening, becoming a hurricane early on August 14\\\\. Later that day, Charlie peaked as a Category 2 hurricane on the modern day Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale with maximum sustained winds of 110 mph (175 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of , both of which were observed by during a reconnaissance aircraft flight. On August 15, the system curved southwestward and made landfall just south of Tampico, Tamaulipas, around 10:00 UTC, at the same intensity. The storm rapidly weakened after moving inland and dissipated by 06:00 UTC on August 16\\\\. Heavy rainfall, strong winds, and storm surge walloped portions of Mexico, especially in Tampico and the state of Veracruz. In the former, storm surge forced the evacuation of residents near the coast. Winds unroofed several homes and resulted in the closure of many businesses. Signs atop buildings fell, while some equipment used by the Servicio Meteorol√≥gico Nacional was destroyed. Additionally, the city of Tampico was left without electricity for about five hours. Heavy rainfall caused small lakes and rivers to rise rapidly, flooding homes in the poorer sections and forcing a number of families to flee to higher ground. In El Higo, one of the worst impacted communities, the P√°nuco River exceeded its bank, inundating the village with over of water. Most of the one story buildings were submerged, while water approached the second story of taller buildings. Thirty-six deaths occurred in the city. In Chontla, 24 homes were destroyed. Flooding and mudslides in San Luis Potos√≠ resulted in another 12 deaths. Overall, the hurricane caused at least 48 fatalities and left 43 other people missing. =Hurricane Three (Dog-Easy)= A tropical wave developed into a tropical depression just northeast of Havana, Cuba, late on August 18. The depression briefly moved inland along the north coast of Cuba, before emerging into the Gulf of Mexico early on August 19\\\\. At 06:00 UTC, the system intensified into a tropical storm. Shortly thereafter, the cyclone curved northwestward, before turning westward late on August 19\\\\. About 24 hours later, the storm curved north-northwestward. At 14:00 UTC on August 22, the system made landfall near Golden Meadow, Louisiana, with winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). However, the cyclone turned southwestward and soon reemerged into the Gulf of Mexico. The storm then curved northwestward on August 23 and finally began to strengthen significantly. At 06:00 UTC on August 24, it intensified into a hurricane. About 12 hours later, the hurricane peaked with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of ; the latter was observed on land and was used to estimate the former. The cyclone made landfall in Galveston, Texas, at 22:00 UTC. Moving inland, the system weakened to a tropical storm early on August 25 and to a tropical depression later that day. Thereafter, the depression slowly weakened, until dissipating over Oklahoma on August 27\\\\. Operationally, this cyclone was believed to have been two systems, causing the United States Air Force to inadvertently assign it two names - Dog and Easy. The storm left little impact in Louisiana, with mainly squalls reported and winds up to observed at Grand Isle. In Texas, tides reached above normal in Galveston. A sustained wind speed exceeding was observed in the city, damaging roofs, signs, and the interior of dwellings. Numerous power wires were downed, causing the electricity to be shut down to avoid residents coming into contact with a live wire, but not before a man touched a downed power line and died. In Galveston County, but outside the city, crop damage reached about $32,500, while property damage totaled about $150,000. At Texas City, communication lines were downed, signs were toppled, homes were deroofed, and boats were washed ashore or set adrift. In Dickinson, several dwellings were destroyed. Farther north, 35 to 40 people at a prison near Houston escaped in the midst of the storm, though 10 of them were recaptured by the following day. Overall, the total damage was estimated at $757,000, with $500,000 of that amount incurred to buildings and improvements, while the remainder was to crops. =Hurricane Four (George)= The Fort Lauderdale Hurricane of 1947 A tropical wave developed into a tropical depression about 175 mi (280 km) west-southwest of Senegal early on September 4. Several hours later, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm, which was named George by the United States Air Force in real time. After moving generally westward for several days, the storm failed to intensify significantly and turned northwestward on September 10\\\\. By the following day, George finally became a Category 1 hurricane. The storm intensified further over the next few days and later peaked as a Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 145 mph (230 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . Early on September 16, George weakened to a Category 3 and curved westward while approaching the northern Bahamas. At 19:00 UTC, the hurricane struck the Abaco Islands with winds of 120 mph (195 km/h). In the Bahamas, the storm produced a large storm surge and strong winds, damaging or destroying many homes and docks on the western end of Grand Bahama. Thereafter, George continued westward and re- intensified into a Category 4 at 12:00 UTC on September 17, just three and a half hours before the storm made landfall near Fort Lauderdale, Florida, with winds of 130 mph (210 km/h). In Florida, advance warnings and stringent building codes were credited with minimizing structural damage and reducing loss of life to 17 people, but nevertheless widespread flooding and coastal damage resulted from heavy rainfall and high tides. Many vegetable plantings, citrus groves, and cattle were submerged or drowned as the storm exacerbated already high water levels and briefly threatened to breach the dikes surrounding Lake Okeechobee. However, the dikes held firm, and evacuations were otherwise credited with minimizing the potential death toll. On the west coast of the state, the storm caused further flooding, extensive damage south of the Tampa Bay area, and the loss of the Cuban fishing vessel Antonio Cerdado offshore Fort Myers, resulting in seven deaths. Damage in Florida reached $31.8 million. On September 18, the hurricane entered the Gulf of Mexico and threatened the Florida Panhandle. Later, George made landfall southeast of New Orleans, Louisiana, on September 19 as a strong Category 2 with winds of 110 mph (175 km/h). George weakened to a tropical storm later that day, and then to a tropical depression on September 20\\\\. The cyclone was absorbed by a cold front over Missouri on the following day. Strong winds in the vicinity of Lake Pontchartrain caused water to over-top the levees, leaving some lakefront streets inundated \\"waist-deep\\" and many areas of the city under about of water. New Orleans alone suffered about $100 million in damage. The widespread flooding spurred flood-protection legislation and the creation of an enlarged levee system to safeguard the flood-prone area. Some coastal flooding also occurred in Mississippi. The state suffered slightly more than $28.4 million in damage. The storm destroyed 1,647 homes and structurally impacted 25,000 others in both Louisiana and Mississippi. Throughout its path, the hurricane caused $160.2 million in damage and 51 casualties. =Tropical Storm Five (Fox)= At 00:00 UTC on September 7, a low pressure area developed into a tropical depression about 135 mi (215 km) south-southwest of Cape St. George Island, Florida. The depression moved northward and intensified, reaching tropical storm status about 18 hours later, and being assigned the name \\"Fox\\" by the United States Air Force. Around that time, the cyclone curved north-northwestward. Early on September 8, Fox peaked with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 km/h), which was observed by a ship. Between 07:00 and 10:00 UTC, an observation station in Mobile, Alabama, recorded a barometric pressure of , the lowest known in association with the cyclone. At 14:00 UTC on September 8, the storm made landfall on Dauphin Island, Alabama, and later near Bayou La Batre. By early the next day, the system weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated over southern Mississippi shortly thereafter. Some coastal areas reported strong wind gusts, including in Mobile, Alabama, and in Pensacola, Florida. At Mobile Bay, two ships were beached, but were re-floated later that day. Overall, damage from the storm was minimal. =Tropical Storm Six (How)= A tropical wave developed into a tropical storm just north Jamaica on September 20\\\\. The storm, assigned the name \\"How\\" by the United States Air Force - moved west- northwestward to northwestward and slowly intensified as it passed near Cayman Brac, Cayman Islands.https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/metadata_master.html#1947_6 At 22:00 UTC on September 21, the cyclone struck Cuba's Isla de la Juventud with winds of 50 mph (85 km/h), about five hours before making landfall near the modern day border of Artemisa and Pinar del R√≠o provinces. Thereafter, the storm moved northward to north-northeastward. How made landfall near Crystal River, Florida, with winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) around 22:00 UTC on September 23\\\\. The wind speed, the highest associated with the storm, was estimated based on an observation of a barometric pressure of at St. Leo. The storm was already losing tropical characteristics prior to landfall, and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone by 00:00 UTC on September 24, just two hours after moving inland. The remnants moved northeastward over Georgia and the Carolinas, before emerging into the Atlantic from North Carolina on September 25\\\\. By early the following day, the remnants of the cyclone dissipated. Throughout Florida, wind speeds of were observed, with winds of common between Sarasota and Cedar Key. A series of tornadoes left damage across Central and North Florida. A tornado in Seffner destroyed three homes and damaged several trees. In Ocala, a tornado downed trees and power lines and deroofed two homes. Two twisters in Jacksonville damaged roofs, trees, and electrical and power lines, while another tornado in Arlington (which was later annexed by Jacksonville) moved a home off its foundation, damaged roofs, and downed trees. Heavy rainfall in some areas worsened the flooding situation that began with the Fort Lauderdale hurricane. Above normal tides caused some erosion between Bradenton and Tarpon Springs. The storm left about $100,000 in damage in Florida. The storm and its remnants brought heavy rainfall to Georgia, including of precipitation at Brunswick in 24 hours. Street flooding was reported there, with water nearly entering businesses. In Savannah, streets were inundated with several feet of water, resulting in the rescue of several families. =Tropical Storm Seven (Item)= An extratropical low pressure area transitioned into a tropical storm offshore North Florida on October 7, after acquiring a more symmetrical structure and the strongest winds moving closer to the center. However, the system had characteristics of a subtropical cyclone, including a moderate temperature gradient still existing at the center and an upper-level trough remaining associated with the storm. The United States Air Force referred to this system as \\"Item\\". At 00:30 UTC on October 7, a ship observed winds of and a barometric pressure of . The former was used to estimate the storm's maximum sustained wind speed of 60 mph (95 km/h), while the latter was the lowest barometric pressure in association with the cyclone. Item made landfall near Kings Bay, Georgia, at peak intensity around 04:00 UTC on October 7\\\\. The storm weakened to a tropical depression about eight hours later. It executed a cyclonic loop, briefly emerging into the Gulf of Mexico near Apalachicola, Florida, before moving inland again over rural Taylor County. Thereafter, Item moved north-northeastward and continued weakening, before dissipating over northern Georgia on October 9. In North Florida, the coast was hit by abnormally high tides, after previously experiencing above normal tides for more than a week. The storm spawned a tornado in Jacksonville that was on the ground for about . The twister crossed a wartime housing project, a trailer park, and a business section of town. Twenty-eight trailers were flipped over or smashed against each other, while the dwellings in the housing project were deroofed. The walls and interiors of some stores in a four block area were damaged. Trees and automobiles also suffered damage. Overall, the tornado left $100,000 in damage, 40 people homeless, and at least 13 injured persons. =Tropical Storm Eight= A low pressure area detached from a cold front and developed into a tropical depression on October 8, about southwest of Flores Island in the Azores. Moving slowly northeastward, the cyclone strengthened, despite relatively cool air and sea surface temperatures, with sustained winds reaching 60 mph (95 km/h) later that day. Early on October 9, the system curved east- northeastward. The following day, a ship observed a barometric pressure of , the lowest pressure associated with the storm. By early on October 11, the system was absorbed by an extratropical cyclone about west-southwest of Flores Island. =Hurricane Nine (King)= A tropical depression was detected off the coast of Nicaragua on October 8. The depression drifted northward, becoming Tropical Storm King the next day. The tropical storm then passed over the western tip of Cuba, producing a peak wind gust of 57 mph (92 km/h). King strengthened over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico to attain hurricane status on October 11. After brushing the Florida Keys, the hurricane made landfall near Cape Sable, Florida on October 12 with winds of and a central pressure of about . The hurricane moved offshore near Pompano Beach and later turned back to the west, toward the Southeastern United States. The storm strengthened as it turned to the west, and on October 15, King made its final landfall near the Georgia-South Carolina state line as a Category 2 hurricane. After moving inland, King quickly weakened to a tropical storm and then a tropical depression early on October 16, before dissipating over Alabama later that day. The hurricane was noted for the first time hurricane seeding was conducted in the Atlantic basin by the United States Weather Bureau through an operation called Project Cirrus. A Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress dropped of dry ice onto the storm from above its cloudtop after it had moved off Jacksonville, Florida. Shortly afterward, the storm reversed course and headed for Savannah. The scientists conducting the experiment believed they had caused this change, but a 1906 hurricane followed a similar path. An airport in south Florida recorded peak winds of 80 mph (130 km/h). The hurricane dropped of rain across central and southern part of the state, including in Hialeah where the storm produced in a one-hour period and over in a 75-minute period. The flooding rains left many neighborhoods in up to six feet of water due to a previously wet summer, and left over 2,000 Miami-Dade County residents homeless. The flooding also closed Route 1 from Miami to Fort Lauderdale, as well as a highway to Everglades City. The hurricane spawned a tornado in both Coral Gables and Miami, one of which destroyed three warehouses. Following the passage of the hurricane, Hialeah mayor Henry Milander declared a state of emergency and restricted access to the city. In Miami, many residents had to use boats and rafts to survey the damage and look for survivors, due to the flooding. Winds in Georgia peaked at 85 mph (135 km/h) in Savannah. Elsewhere in the state, the storm caused $500,000 in damage, mainly due to a tornado that touched down near Hinesville. Tides above normal were reported from Georgia to South Carolina. The high tides in Charleston, South Carolina, caused minor beach erosion and isolated street flooding, and one person was killed there by a falling tree. In North Carolina, the high tides caused minor flooding. Overall, the hurricane caused about $20 million in damage. =Hurricane Ten (Love)= The tenth and final tropical storm of the season likely developed from a tropical wave just north of the Leeward Islands early on October 17. The storm, designated as \\"Love\\" in real time by the United States Air Force, moved west-northwestward and re- curved to the northwest, avoiding landfall in the Leeward Islands, the Greater Antilles, and the Bahamas. Around 06:00 UTC on October 18, Love intensified into a Category 1 hurricane, shortly before beginning to move northward. Early the following day, the cyclone strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane while re-curving to the north-northeast. Upon reaching Category 3 intensity around 12:00 UTC on October 19, Love became the second major hurricane of the season. About six hours later, the storm attained maximum sustained winds of 120 mph (195 km/h), estimated based on averaging-out sustained wind speeds by a reconnaissance aircraft. On October 19, Hurricane Love became the first storm to be flown into at the low-levels by the 53d Weather Reconnaissance Squadron. Around 12:00 UTC on October 20, the hurricane passed close to Bermuda. The island reported sustained winds of and gusts up to . Winds downed many tree limbs and damaged crops, especially bananas and tomatoes. Winds also toppled electrical and telephone wires, leaving Hamilton without those services for several days. Ten buildings were destroyed, though little damage occurred to structures with Bermuda's standard building codes. The hurricane sank 11 boats in the vicinity of the island. Overall, 10 people were injured and damaged totaled over $1 million. Late on October 20, a reconnaissance aircraft flight observed a barometric pressure of , the lowest in association with the hurricane. Early the following day, Love weakened to a Category 2 hurricane. The cyclone then accelerated and curved east-northeastward late on October 21\\\\. At 00:00 UTC on October 22, the storm weakened to a Category 1 hurricane and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about six hours later while situated about southeast of Newfoundland. The remnants were soon absorbed by a larger extratropical storm. =Other systems= Several other tropical depressions developed throughout the season. The first formed over the Bay of Campeche near the southeast coast of Mexico by June 13\\\\. By the following day, the depression either dissipated over moved rapidly northeastward ahead of a cold front and was last noted in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico. On September 1, another tropical depression formed offshore The Carolinas from a low pressure area that detached from a frontal system. The depression moved northward and merged with another frontal system on the following day. A tropical wave developed into a tropical depression south of the Capo Verde Islands on September 15\\\\. The depression tracked slowly west-northwestward for several days, before turning northeastward on September 23\\\\. Thereafter, the depression began moving erratically, with multiple small cyclonic loops from September 24 to September 28, before curving northward and then northeastward. By September 30, the depression became extratropical while well southwest of the Azores. The next tropical depression developed from a low which formed along either a trough or decaying front to the northeast of the Lesser Antilles on October 25\\\\. However, the depression transitioned into an extratropical cyclone by the following day. The final tropical cyclone of the season developed just north of Martinique on November 28\\\\. The depression moved westward and then curved northwestward, passing near the eastern tip of the Dominican Republic on November 30\\\\. Early the following day, the depression was absorbed by a cold front to the northeast of the Turks and Caicos Islands. Storm names This was the first season in which the Air Weather Service began assigning names to tropical cyclones using the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet.

A dark fantasy with a contemporary setting, the novel concerns a company called Vampire$, Inc. which treats vampire-hunting as a commercial enterprise, funded by large payments from the vampires' potential victims and secretly supported from the highest levels of the Roman Catholic Church.  Plot summary  Vampire$, Inc. cleans out a nest of vampires, but has some difficulty collecting their payment and ultimately hosts a wild party at a local motel with all of the team and some townsfolk. The party is interrupted by a \\"master vampire\\" who slaughters everyone at the party with the exception of Jack Crow and his second-in-command \\"Cherry Cat\\" Catlin. The shaken Jack begins to plan the formation of a new team, aided by Father Adam, a knowledgeable young priest sent to him by the Vatican. Events at the motel slaughter lead Jack to realize that silver, particularly blessed silver from a cross, can be used as a weapon against vampires. He has his weaponsmith Carl begin creating silver bullets and he recruits a skilled gunman named Felix, that Jack met while working as a government agent in Mexico. Felix proves to be as deadly with a pistol as Jack hoped and they seem to have a new and powerful resource to use against the vampires. In addition to the silver bullets, Carl also develops a \\"vampire detector\\" for use by the team, which proves to be a useful tool against the vampires (which are portrayed as fantastically fast and powerful compared to humans, particularly the 'master vampires'). A series of battles ensues, using these silver bullets against the vampires, but key members of Jack's team are killed by the vampires, including Annabelle, the office manager of the team's residence, and the aging Carl. Jack, depressed and beaten, suicidally returns to a known favorite hotel where the vampires are sure to find him. Felix, Cat and Father Adam stage a rescue attempt but it ends with Father Adam dead and Jack spirited away by the vampire. The novel closes with Felix taking a leadership role within Vampire$ Inc., after thwarting an attempt by the now-vampirized Jack Crow to attack the Pope. Relation to Armor Part of the novel is about the relationship between the lead vampire hunter, ex-DEA agent Jack Crow, and the gunman he hires, an ex-drugrunner named Felix. A note on the copyright page states, \\"This Felix is no other Felix. This Jack Crow is no other Jack Crow.\\" In this novel, Felix is the owner of a bar called the Antwar Saloon; the main characters of Steakley's military SF novel Armor are named Jack Crow and Felix and they fight in \\"the Ant War\\". Despite the disclaimer, the Jack Crow and Felix characters in both novels have many parallels; Jack Crow is the wisecracking almost-anti-hero in both works, and Felix is the gifted-but- reluctant warrior.

The village has a population of 410. The parish includes the hamlet of Beer (sometimes Bere or Bere Aller) and the deserted medieval village of Oath on the opposite bank of the River Parrett. History Aller was listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Alre, meaning 'The alder tree' from the Old English alor. The parish of Aller was part of the hundred of Somerton. Most of the valuable meadows had been enclosed by 1577, but the surrounding fields were not enclosed until 1797. Between 1614 and 1616 there was a struggle between the lord, Sir John Davis, who had recently purchased the manor, and the tenants over the building of hedges and gates to increase the value of the remaining of common ground. The meadows remained open and Davis sold the manor to John Stawell of Cothelstone in 1623. Oath Lock marks the tidal limit of the River Parrett. It was added when it was realised that the locks at Stanmoor, Langport and Muchelney, with a half-lock at Thorney, would not provide the depth of water specified in the Act of Parliament of 4 July 1836 which authorised the building of the navigation.G.

Gallop, (2006), Parrett River Trade, Fiducia Press, Charles Hadfield, (1967), The Canals of South West England, David and Charles Church St Andrew's Church The Church of St Andrew has Saxon origins with some parts dating from the 12th and 13th centuries, with restoration work undertaken several times since, the most major of which was in 1861‚Äì62 by John Norton. It is a Grade II* listed building. English Heritage has included it in the Heritage at Risk Register. The font is a simple limestone bowl, less than a metre tall, which is thought to be Saxon in origin, one of only three in England and was possibly the one used for the baptism of Guthrum after his defeat by King Alfred The Great after the Battle of Ethandun in 878. It was retrieved from the pond of the vicarage garden around 1870 and now stands in the south-west corner of the nave. A copy of the font was made by a stonemason in Corvallis, Oregon, in the 1880s, to memorialise the son of the rector of Aller, Rev. J.Y. Nicholson. The copy of Aller's historic font was in the Episcopalian Church of the Good Samaritan.

They are appointed by their people who believe the chosen elders have the capacity to teach and guide both current and future generations. KaumƒÅtua have good knowledge of tikanga, history, and Te Reo; and their contribution ensures that the mana of the whƒÅnau, hap≈´ and iwi are maintained. Barlow (1994) refers to kaumƒÅtua as being the \\"keepers of knowledge and traditions of the family, sub-tribe and tribe\\". Although the term kaumƒÅtua is widely used to refer to all elders, male kaumƒÅtua are more correctly called koroua or koro, and female elders are called kuia. Characteristics KaumƒÅtua never self-proclaim their elder status, as the rules of mana prohibit this; instead the people acknowledge an elder's status as kaumƒÅtua. KaumƒÅtua comport themselves with humility, honesty, and integrity, and typically possess deep knowledge of a particular subject such as whakapapa or tikanga, and know people who have expertise in other fields. Powers In the past, kaumƒÅtua were believed to be \\"the reincarnation of a person who had acquired a supernatural or godly status after death, and who had become the protector of the family\\". These supernatural powers allowed the reincarnated spirits to return to earth to provide influential guidance to the remaining family. It was believed that these powers allowed the kaumƒÅtua transform themselves into birds, fish and insects. Elders of the tribe made reference to these transformed states when predicting the future and fortunes of the tribe. Additionally, along with leadership and guidance of family and marae, many kaumƒÅtua exert a protective influence over the seas, rivers, lands and forests. Relationships with health organisations KaumƒÅtua are essential to any MƒÅori community as well as health organisations which have affiliations with MƒÅori. This includes kaimatai hinengaro (clinical psychologists), especially if they treat MƒÅori clients or carry out health research on MƒÅori participants. KaumƒÅtua that are involved in health organisations play a pivotal role in guiding kaimatai hinengaro, similar to their role in the MƒÅori community. Whilst the importance of kaumƒÅtua guidance has been predominantly acknowledged by MƒÅori, greater awareness in non-MƒÅori circles is beginning to acknowledge their knowledge bases as well. Non-MƒÅori kaimatai hinengaro treating MƒÅori clients or carrying out medical research on MƒÅori are realizing the benefits of working under the guidance of kaumƒÅtua. For kaimatai hinengaro carrying out health research on MƒÅori, kaumƒÅtua of local iwi can be contacted through Te Puni K≈çkiri. The offices of Te Puni K≈çkiri employ MƒÅori liaison authorities who maintain a \\"register of local iwi contact people\\". Once contact is made, research objectives and outcomes are discussed with kaumƒÅtua and other tribal elders. Key contact individuals are appointed for both research and iwi sides. While the contact person for the research may be the kaimatai hinengaro, kaumƒÅtua usually represent the iwi and provide feedback on satisfaction with research methods and treatment of MƒÅori participants.

He was born in Drohobych to a wealthy, Yiddish and Polish-speaking orthodox Jewish family living in Galicia. It was then part of the Austrian sector of Partitioned Poland, now Western Ukraine. Considered one of the most talented students of Jan Matejko, Gottllieb died at the age of 23. Career Maurycy (Moses) was one of Isaac Gottlieb and Fanya n√©e Tigerman's eleven children. He was introduced to painting in Lemberg (Lviv) by Micha≈Ç Godlewski. At fifteen, he enrolled at the Vienna Fine Arts Academy for three years. In 1873 he went to Krak√≥w to study under Jan Matejko and became close friends with Jacek Malczewski. However, an anti-semitic incident at the School of Fine Arts prompted him to leave Krak√≥w after less than a year in spite of Malczewski's protests. He traveled to Norway and stayed in Molde. He returned to Vienna and from there travelled to Munich in 1875 to study under Karl Piloty and Alexander Wagner. In 1876 he won the Gold Medal at the Munich Academy for his painting, Shylock and Jessica. In the same year, he moved back to Vienna to attend the workshop of Heinrich von Angeli. He lived and worked in Vienna for the next two years and produced paintings with biblical themes, as well as illustrations for Friedrich Bruckmann Publishing of Munich. In the fall of 1878, Gottlieb travelled to Rome, where he befriended Henryk Siemiradzki. At a banquet in his residence at Via Gaeta, Gottlieb met with Matejko, who convinced him to come back to Krak√≥w as one of his best students, to work on a series of monumental paintings including scenes from the history of the Jews in Poland. In 1879 Gottlieb settled in Krak√≥w and began working on his new major project. He died in the same year from health complications. Matejko attended his funeral and promised his father to look after his younger brother Marcin. Gottlieb won a gold medal at the Munich art competition for his painting, Shylock and Jessica (1876), portraying a scene from Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice. The painting was exhibited in Lviv in 1877, and in 1878 at Zachƒôta in Warsaw and widely acclaimed. Gottlieb based Jessica's face on that of Laura Rosenfeld, to whom he had proposed marriage. However, Laura rejected his proposal and wed a Berlin banker. Gottlieb planned to marry Lola Rosengarten, but when he heard about Rosenfeld's marriage, he knowingly exposed himself to the elements, dying of complications from a cold and sore throat.Erik Weems, Biography of Maurycy Gottlieb at Eeweems.com, Richmond VA. Retrieved November 19, 2012 Despite his premature death at the age of 23, more than three hundred of his works survive (mostly sketches, but also oil paintings), though not all are finished. After the fall of the Iron Curtain, many Polish collections unknown in the West were popularized, and his reputation grew greatly. His brother Leopold Gottlieb was born five years after his death and became known as a painter as an adult.

According to him, the film takes the name \\"pleasure dome\\" from Samuel Taylor Coleridge's atmospheric poem \\"Kubla Khan\\". Anger was inspired to make the film after attending a Halloween party called \\"Come as your Madness\\". The film has gained cult film status. Earlier prints of the film had sequences that were meant to be projected on three different screens, an idea inspired in part by Abel Gance's Napol√©on (1927 film). The three-screen version was shown at the Brussels World's Fair. Anger subsequently re-edited the film to layer the images. The film (primarily in the second or third version) was often shown in American universities and art galleries during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. The original edition soundtrack is a complete performance of Glagolitic Mass by the Czech composer Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek (1854‚Äì1928). In 1966, a re- edited version known as 'The Sacred Mushroom Edition' was made available. In the late 1970s, a third revision was made, which was 'The Sacred Mushroom Edition' re-edited to fit the Electric Light Orchestra album Eldorado, omitting only \\"Illusions in G Major\\", a blues-rock tune that Anger felt did not fit the mood of the film. The differences in the visuals of the 1954 original and the two revisions are minor. An early version‚Äîshown only once on German television in the early 1980s, and held to this day by NDR‚Äîincludes an additional three minutes at the beginning, including a reading of the poem \\"Kubla Khan\\" by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. The film reflects Anger's deep interest in Thelema, the philosophy of Aleister Crowley and his followers, as indicated by Marjorie Cameron's role as \\"The Scarlet Woman\\" (an honorific Crowley bestowed on certain of his important magical partners). Crowley's concept of a ritual masquerade party where attendees dress as gods and goddesses served as a direct inspiration for the film. The film uses some footage of the Hell sequence from the 1911 Italian silent film L'Inferno. Near the end, scenes from Anger's earlier film Puce Moment are interpolated into the layered images and faces.

The aim was to build a spacecraft concept to study the effects of Mars-level gravity (~0.38g) on mammals. Presentations were given to Robert Zubrin (Mars Society), and the award for best design was given to The University of Washington (UW). The UW team continued to develop the concept until the end of the school year (June 2002), after which funding became an issue. The team from UW contacted members of the team that presented from MIT, and the two universities agreed to continue development together. Later University of Queensland ‚Äì Australia (UQ) joined the team as well. The program ended in 2009. Program history and overview The Mars Gravity Biosatellite program began in 2001 as a Mars Society initiative called Translife that grew out of a discussion between Robert Zubrin and Elon Musk. It was intended to study the effects of the gravity of Mars (about one-third that of Earth) on mammals, for which no data was available. Over the next few years, the program grew both scope and vision, with staff and students from MIT (Payload), UW (Spacecraft Bus) and UQ (Reentry) collaboratively designing various parts of the mission concept. With ongoing funding challenges, UW and UQ withdrew after several years and Georgia Institute of Technology stepped in to build on their design work. The effort represented the most ambitious and complex student satellite project to date. The mission concept was envisioned to carry 15 mice in low Earth orbit for five weeks. The satellite was designed to spin at approximately 32 rpmKorzun, Ashley M.; Wagner, Erika B.; et al. (2007).

At the end of its mission, the satellite would reenter Earth's atmosphere and its cargo of mice would be retrieved. In 2007, a tentative launch date for the Mars Gravity Biosatellite had been set for 2010 or 2011, as the primary payload on a Falcon 1E or a Minotaur IV launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida. In 2005, the involved universities received a $200,000 NASA advanced projects development grant to support the development of a full payload engineering model.NASA Grant Energizes Student-Developed Mars Project. Leonard David, Space. September 30, 2005. In 2006, the students of Mars Gravity developed a novel microfinancing platform called Your Name Into Space. This was meant to help finance the development of their spacecraft. This initiative is designed to give individuals and corporations the opportunity to fly images of their choice into orbit. By the program's end in 2009, the project had engaged over 600 undergraduate, graduate, and high school students in aerospace engineering, space life sciences, and program management. Over 20 conference presentations and papers were published, earning multiple student awards. On 24 June 2009, a status report was released declaring the end of this program, due to lack of funding and shifting priorities at NASA. Science Gravity on Mars is only about 38% as strong as it is on Earth, and the long-term effects of such reduced gravity are unknown. Astronauts who are weightless for long periods of time lose significant amounts of bone and muscle mass. It is unclear if the gravity on Mars is strong enough to avoid or minimize these health problems. The Mars Gravity Biosatellite was meant to provide data on how mammalian health is affected by long-term exposure to lower levels of gravity, focusing on bone loss, changes in bone structure, muscle atrophy, and changes in the inner ear. The results from the five-week mission experiment would have been compared against a variety of Earth-based controls, including vivarium, hindlimb suspension, partial weight suspension, flight habitat effects, and short-radius centrifuge testing.

The tri-band camera phone uses GPRS and EDGE for its internet connections. The phone can be seen as an upgrade of the Nokia 3200. Like the 3200, custom rear face plates can be created by the user. A stencil is available in the pack. While features such as infrared and a built-in FM radio are removed, new features such as rhythmic LED flashing lights (two on each side), wave messaging, voice dialing, themes, and a video recorder are added. With the addition of an optional face plate, when the phone is waved back and forth rapidly, a light message of text is produced in mid-air. An FM radio can be added on with the use of the phone's Pop-Port. The 3220 features a 16-bit (65,536) color screen, which is an improvement over the 3200's 12-bit (4096) color screen. The phone also has more internal memory than the 3200. The CIF camera is also upgraded to 0.3 megapixels VGA (640x480 resolution, for photos), and features video recording (128x96) capability. At just 86 grams, the Nokia 3220 is also very lightweight.https://www.zdnet.com/product/nokia-3220/ The phone has a built-in browser which seems to be very slow (in terms of data processing) to many.

It was the custom of \\"flower children\\" to wear and distribute flowers or floral-themed decorations to symbolize ideals of universal belonging, peace, and love. The mass media picked up on the term and used it to refer in a broad sense to any hippie. Flower children were also associated with the flower power political movement, which originated in ideas written by Allen Ginsberg in 1965. Origins A protester dressed as a flower child at the Occupy Wall Street event, September 24, 2011 The term originated in the mid-1960s in the wake of a film version of H. G. Wells's The Time Machine that depicted flower-bestowing, communal people of the future in a story characterized by antiwar themes. American political activists like Allen Ginsberg and Abbie Hoffman advocated the giving of flowers as a means of peaceful protest.\\"Allen Ginsburg\\", American Masters, Public Broadcasting System, pbs.org, retrieved 30-04-2009Tony Perry, \\"Poet Allen Ginsberg Dies at 70\\", Los Angeles Times, April 06, 1997 Images of flower-wielding protesters at the 1967 Pentagon March, such as Marc Riboud's image of Jan Rose Kasmir titled The Ultimate Confrontation: The Flower and the Bayonet and Bernie Boston's Pulitzer prize-nominated photograph Flower Power,Bernie Boston, \\"Flower Power\\", The Washington Evening Star, October 21, 1967 popularized the association of flowers with the counterculture movement of the 1970s. Hippies embraced the symbolism by dressing in clothing with embroidered flowers and vibrant colors, wearing flowers in their hair, and distributing flowers to the public, becoming known as flower children.Rennay Craats, History of the 1970s, Weigl Publishers Inc., 2001, p.36 San Francisco 130px John Phillips of The Mamas & the Papas wrote the song \\"San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)\\" for his friend Scott McKenzie to promote the Monterey Pop Festival that Phillips was helping to organize. Released on May 13, 1967, the song's lyrics urged visitors to San Francisco to \\"wear some flowers in your hair\\", in keeping with the festival's billing as \\"three days of music, love, and flowers\\". The song was a popular hit, reaching number 4 on the music chart in the United States and number 1 in the United Kingdom and most of Europe, and became an unofficial anthem for hippies, flower power and the flower child concept. Summer of Love After the January 14, 1967 Human Be-In organized by artist Michael Bowen (among other things, announcements told participants to bring flowers), as many as 100,000 young people from all over the world (that is, United States and a few countries in Western Europe) flocked to San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury district, Berkeley, and other Bay Area cities during the Summer of Love in search of different value systems and experiences. The Summer of Love became a watershed event in the development of a worldwide 1960s counterculture when newly recruited flower children returned home at the end of the summer, taking with them new styles, ideas, and behaviors and introducing them in all major cities of the U.S. and western Europe. Social analysis In his book, Prometheus Rising, the philosopher Robert Anton Wilson suggested that the flower children could be viewed in Jungian terms as a collective social symbol representing the mood of friendly weakness. 'She/He is self-critical, shy, timid, easily led, \\"spineless,\\" and always looking for somebody to Take Charge and Give Orders. The unearthly Angel, or in modern symbolism, the Flower Child'.

The Three Witnesses is the collective name for three men connected with the early Latter Day Saint movement who stated that an angel had shown them the golden plates from which Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon; they also stated that they had heard God's voice, informing them that the book had been translated by divine power. The Three are part of twelve Book of Mormon witnesses, who also include Smith and the Eight Witnesses. The joint statement of the Three Witnesses‚ÄîOliver Cowdery, Martin Harris, and David Whitmer‚Äîhas been printed (with a separate statement by the Eight Witnesses) in nearly every edition of the Book of Mormon since its first publication in 1830. All three men eventually broke with Smith and the church he organized, although Harris and Cowdery were eventually rebaptized into the church after Smith's death. Whitmer founded his own Church of Christ (Whitmerite). All three men upheld their testimony of the Book of Mormon at their deaths. (\\"the three witnesses all defected from Smith and his church, (only Whitmer permanently), though all maintained until death the truth of the affidavits.\\")In 1838, Joseph Smith called Cowdery, Harris, and Whitmer \\"too mean to mention; and we had liked to have forgotten them.\\" B.H.

After some time, Harris left the other three men, believing his presence had prevented the vision from occurring. The remaining three again knelt and said they soon saw a light in the air overhead and an angel holding the golden plates. Smith retrieved Harris, and after praying at some length with him, Harris too said he saw the vision.Bushman, 78. The three men provided a single written statement titled \\"Testimony of Three Witnesses\\", published at the end of the first edition of the Book of Mormon: Monument, by Avard Fairbanks. > Be it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, unto whom this > work shall come: That we, through the grace of God the Father, and our Lord > Jesus Christ, have seen the plates which contain this record, which is a > record of the people of Nephi, and also of the Lamanites, his brethren, and > also of the people of Jared, who came from the tower of which hath been > spoken.

And we declare with words of soberness, > that an angel of God came down from heaven, and he brought and laid before > our eyes, that we beheld and saw the plates, and the engravings thereon; and > we know that it is by the grace of God the Father, and our Lord Jesus > Christ, that we beheld and bear record that these things are true.

And the honor be to the Father, and > to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost, which is one God. Amen. The testimony was moved to the beginning of the Book of Mormon in later editions, with standardized spelling. The Three Witnesses The Three Witnesses were closely associated with Joseph Smith, Jr. at the time he founded the church. Martin Harris made a significant financial contribution to the printing of the Book of Mormon.In Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling, New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2005, p. 80, Richard Bushman notes: \\"Martin Harris mortgaged his farm for $3,000 as security in case the books did not sell.\\" In addition, it has been argued that Smith and the Witnesses had a similar magical worldview. Grant H. Palmer wrote that moderns \\"tend to read into [the Witnesses'] testimonies a rationalist perspective rather than a nineteenth- century magical mindset .... They shared a common world view, and this is what drew them together in 1829.\\"Grant H. Palmer, An Insider's View of Mormon Origins (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 2002) pp. 175‚Äì76. As a group, the Three Witnesses served only one other role in the church before they were excommunicated in 1837‚Äì38. After Smith had selected the council of the Twelve Apostles, the Three Witnesses \\"called out the twelve men and gave each one a blessing.\\"Bushman, 255. The choices were announced at a meeting on 14 February 1835. History of the Church 2:186‚Äì87.. According to Bushman the implication of the blessing was that the Twelve were to be the \\"core missionary force.\\" = Oliver Cowdery = Oliver Cowdery Oliver Cowdery was a school teacher and an early convert to Mormonism who served as scribe while Smith dictated what he said was a translation of the Book of Mormon. Like Smith, who was a distant relative, Cowdery was also a treasure hunter who had used a divining rod in his youth. Cowdery asked questions of the rod; if it moved, the answer was yes, if not, no.Palmer, 179: \\"Oliver Cowdery came from a similar background. He was a treasure hunter and 'rodsman' before he met Joseph Smith in 1829. William Cowdery, his father, was associated with a treasure-seeking group in Vermont, and it is from them, one assumes that Oliver learned the art of working with a divining rod. Joseph told Oliver that he knew the 'rod of nature' Oliver used 'has told you many things.'\\" See Vogel EMD, 1: 599-621. Cowdery also told Smith that he had seen the golden plates in a vision before the two ever met.Palmer, 179; Dean C. Jessee, ed., The Papers of Joseph Smith: Autobiographical and Historical Writings (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1989), I: 10. Before Cowdery served as one of the Three Witnesses, he had already experienced two other important visions. Cowdery said that he and Smith had received the Aaronic priesthood from John the Baptist in May 1829, after which they had baptized each other in the Susquehanna River.Messenger and Advocate (October 1834) pp. 14‚Äì16; Bushman, 74‚Äì75. Cowdery said that he and Smith had later that year gone into the forest and prayed \\"until a glorious light encircled us, and as we arose on account of the light, three persons stood before us dressed in white, their faces beaming with glory.\\" One of the three persons claimed to be the Apostle Peter and named the others James and John. The three laid their hands upon Cowdery's and Smith's heads and ordained them to the Melchizedek priesthood.Charles M. Nielsen to Heber Grant, February 10, 1898, in Dan Vogel, ed., Early Mormon Documents (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 1998) 2: 476. By 1838, Cowdery and Smith had a number of disagreements, including doctrinal differences about the role of faith and works,Cowdery and Smith publicly argued about the wording of what is now Doctrine and Covenants 20:37. The dispute arose partially in part because as Second Elder in the Church of Christ, Cowdery had received parts of the revelation and was part author of the D&C; 20\\\\. (see Articles of the Church of Christ). Cowdery's version of the revelation was worded differently than the version that was prepared for publication in 1835. Smith's version reads: \\"All those who humble themselves before God, and desire to be baptized, and come forth with broken hearts and contrite spirits, and witness before the church that they have truly repented of all their sins, and are willing to take upon them the name of Jesus Christ, having a determination to serve him to the end, and truly manifest by their works that they have received of the Spirit of Christ unto the remission of their sins, shall be received by baptism into his church.\\" Cowdery's version reads: \\"Now therefore whosoever repenteth & humbleth himself before me & desireth to be baptized in my name shall ye baptize them ... if it so be that he repenteth & is baptized in my name then shall ye receive him & shall minister unto him of my flesh & blood but if he repenteth not he shall not be numbered among my people that he may not destroy my people.\\" The discussion of how works and faith are intertwined in the repentance process proved to be a dividing factor between Smith and Cowdery during the printing of the Book of Commandments and later the Doctrine and Covenants.

Smith's growing reliance on Sidney Rigdon as his first counselorAlthough Rigdon was Smith's counselor in the First Presidency, Cowdery was still an \\"associate president\\" or \\"assistant president\\" of the church and had more authority than Rigdon. However, David Whitmer was President of the Church in Zion, and Smith led the First Presidency and was president of the church outside of Zion. It is apparent that Cowdery had a difficult time with the rising influence of Rigdon and the authority of Whitmer. Encyclopedia of Mormonism, \\"Cowdery, Oliver\\"; D. Michael Quinn, BYU Studies, 16: 193. and differences over the management of finances during the gathering of the Latter Day Saints in Jackson County and KirtlandEncyclopedia of Mormonism, \\"Cowdery, Oliver\\" as well as nine documented grievances, ultimately led to Cowdery's excommunication in April.History of the Church 3: 16: \\"Wednesday, April 11, [1838]‚ÄîElder Seymour Brunson preferred the following charges against Oliver Cowdery, to the High Council at Far West: To the Bishop and Council of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I prefer the following charges against President Oliver Cowdery. \\"First‚ÄîFor persecuting the brethren by urging on vexatious law suits against them, and thus distressing the innocent. Second‚ÄîFor seeking to destroy the character of President Joseph Smith, Jun., by falsely insinuating that he was guilty of adultery. Third‚ÄîFor treating the Church with contempt by not attending meetings. Fourth‚ÄîFor virtually denying the faith by declaring that he would not be governed by any ecclesiastical authority or revelations whatever, in his temporal affairs. Fifth‚ÄîFor selling his lands in Jackson county, contrary to the revelations. Sixth--For writing and sending an insulting letter to President Thomas B. Marsh, while the latter was on the High Council, attending to the duties of his office as President of the Council, and by insulting the High Council with the contents of said letter. Seventh‚ÄîFor leaving his calling to which God had appointed him by revelation, for the sake of filthy lucre, and turning to the practice of law. Eighth‚ÄîFor disgracing the Church by being connected in the bogus business, as common report says. Ninth‚ÄîFor dishonestly retaining notes after they had been paid; and finally, for leaving and forsaking the cause of God, and returning to the beggarly elements of the world, and neglecting his high and holy calling, according to his profession.\\" Cowdery also refused a high council decision that he not sell lands on which he hoped to make a profit.Bushman, 323, 347‚Äì48. After Cowdery's excommunication on April 12, 1838, he taught school, practiced law, and became involved in Ohio political affairs. He joined the Methodist church in Tiffin, Ohio, and, according to a lay leader of that church, publicly declared that he was \\"ashamed of his connection with Mormonism.\\"The following verse was published in Times and Seasons (1841), 2: 482: \\"Or does it prove there is no time,/Because some watches will not go?/...Or prove that Christ was not the Lord/Because that Peter cursed and swore?/Or Book of Mormon not His word/Because denied, by Oliver?\\" In 1881, both Cowdery's law partner and his adopted daughter testified that Cowdery had joined the Methodist church in Tiffin, Ohio in 1841 or 1842. In 1844, Cowdery was chosen secretary of \\"a meeting of Male Members of the Methodist Protestant Church of Tiffin, Ohio.\\" G. J. Keen, a lay leader in that church, said that when joining the Methodist Church, Cowdery \\"arose and addressed the audience present, admitted his error and implored forgiveness, and said he was sorry and ashamed of his connection with Mormonism. He continued his membership while he resided in Tiffin and became superintendent of the Sabbath-school, and led an exemplary life while he resided with us.\\" Charles Augustus Shook, The True Origin of the Book of Mormon (Cincinnati: Standard Publishing Co., 1914) pp. 54‚Äì61. Later, Cowdery reaffirmed his role in the establishment of Mormonism, though he lost editorship of a newspaper as a result. In 1848, after Smith's assassination, Cowdery reaffirmed his witness to the golden plates and asked to be readmitted to the church. He never held another high office in the church, in part because he died sixteen months after his re- baptism.Randall Cluff, \\"Cowdery, Oliver\\" American National Biography Online Feb. 2000. = Martin Harris = Martin Harris Martin Harris was a respected farmer in the Palmyra area who had changed his religion at least five times before he became a Mormon.Harris had been a Quaker, a Universalist, a Restorationist, a Baptist, a Presbyterian, and perhaps a Methodist. Ronald W. Walker, \\"Martin Harris: Mormonism's Early Convert,\\" Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought 19 (Winter 1986): 30‚Äì33). A biographer wrote that his \\"imagination was excitable and fecund.\\" One letter says that Harris thought that a candle sputtering was the work of the devilWalker, 34: \\"Once while reading scripture, he reportedly mistook a candle's sputtering as a sign that the devil desired to stop him.\\" and that he had met Jesus in the shape of a deer and walked and talked with him for two or three miles.John A. Clark letter, August 31, 1840 in EMD, 2: 271. The local Presbyterian minister called him \\"a visionary fanatic.\\"Walker, 34-35. A friend, who praised Harris as \\"universally esteemed as an honest man\\" but disagreed with his religious affiliation, declared that Harris's mind \\"was overbalanced by 'marvellousness'\\" and that his belief in earthly visitations of angels and ghosts gave him the local reputation of being crazy.Pomeroy Tucker reminiscence, 1858 in Early Mormon Documents 3: 71. Another friend said, \\"Martin was a good citizen. Martin was a man that would do just as he agreed with you. But, he was a great man for seeing spooks.\\"Lorenzo Saunders Interview, November 12, 1884, Early Mormon Documents 2: 149. During the early years, Harris \\"seems to have repeatedly admitted the internal, subjective nature of his visionary experience.\\"Vogel, EMD, 2: 255. The foreman in the Palmyra printing office that produced the first Book of Mormon said that Harris \\"used to practice a good deal of his characteristic jargon and 'seeing with the spiritual eye,' and the like.\\"Pomeroy Tucker, Origin, Rise, and Progress of Mormonism (New York: D. Appleton and Co., 1867), 71 in EMD, 3: 122. John H. Gilbert, the typesetter for most of the Book of Mormon, said that he had asked Harris, \\"Martin, did you see those plates with your naked eyes?\\" According to Gilbert, Harris \\"looked down for an instant, raised his eyes up, and said, 'No, I saw them with a spiritual eye.\\"John H. Gilbert, \\"Memorandum,\\" 8 September 1892, in EMD, 2: 548. Two other Palmyra residents said that Harris told them that he had seen the plates with \\"the eye of faith\\" or \\"spiritual eyes.\\"Martin Harris interviews with John A. Clark, 1827 & 1828 in EMD, 2: 270; Jesse Townsend to Phineas Stiles, 24 December 1833, in EMD, 3: 22. In 1838, Harris is said to have told an Ohio congregation that \\"he never saw the plates with his natural eyes, only in vision or imagination.\\"Stephen Burnett to Lyman E. Johnson, 15 April 1838 in EMD, 2: 291. A neighbor of Harris in Kirtland, Ohio, said that Harris \\"never claimed to have seen [the plates] with his natural eyes, only spiritual vision.\\"Reuben P. Harmon statement, c. 1885, in EMD, 2: 385. One account states that in March 1838, Harris publicly denied that either he or the other Witnesses to the Book of Mormon had literally seen the golden plates‚Äîalthough, of course, he had not been present when Whitmer and Cowdery first claimed to have viewed them. This account says that Harris's recantation, made during a period of crisis in early Mormonism, induced five influential members, including three apostles, to leave the church.Stephen Burnett to Luke S. Johnson, 15 April 1838, in Joseph Smith's Letterbook, Early Mormon Documents 2: 290‚Äì92. Later in life, Harris strongly denied that he ever made this statement.Letter of Martin Harris, Sr., to Hanna B. Emerson, January 1871, Smithfield, Utah Territory, in EMD, 2: 338. See also Richard Lloyd Anderson, Investigating the Book of Mormon Witnesses, (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1981) p. 118. In 1837, Harris joined dissenters, led by Warren Parrish, in an attempt to reform the church. But Parrish rejected the Book of Mormon, and Harris continued to believe in it. By 1840, Harris had returned to Smith's church. Following Smith's assassination, Harris accepted James J. Strang as a new prophet, and Strang also claimed to have been divinely led to an ancient record engraved upon metal plates. By 1847, Harris had broken with Strang and had accepted the leadership of fellow Book of Mormon witness, David Whitmer. Harris then left Whitmer for another Mormon factional leader, Gladden Bishop. In 1855, Harris joined with the last surviving brother of Joseph Smith, William Smith, and declared that William was Joseph's true successor.EMD, 2: 258. In 1856, Harris was living in Kirtland and, as caretaker of the temple, gave tours to interested visitors. Despite his earlier statements regarding the spiritual nature of his experience, in 1853, Harris told one David Dille that he had held the forty- to sixty-pound plates on his knee for \\"an hour-and-a-half\\" and handled them \\"plate after plate.\\"Martin Harris interview with David B. Dille, 15 September 1853 in EMD 2: 296‚Äì97. Even later, Harris affirmed that he had seen the plates and the angel: \\"Gentlemen,\\" holding out his hand, \\"do you see that hand? Are you sure you see it? Or are your eyes playing you a trick or something? No. Well, as sure as you see my hand so sure did I see the Angel and the plates.\\"Martin Harris interview with Robert Barter, c. 1870 in EMD, 2: 390. In 1870, at the age of 87, Harris accepted an invitation to live in Utah Territory, where he was rebaptized into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and spent his remaining years with relatives in Cache County. In his last years, Harris continued to bear fervent testimony to the authenticity of the plates, but a contemporary critic of the church has noted that Harris rejected some important Mormon doctrines and that his sympathy for the LDS Church was tenuous.In an interview with ex-Mormon Anthony Metcalf, Metcalf asked him why, if he did not believe that polygamy, baptism for the dead, or temple endowments were part of Mormonism, he had taken the endowment when he arrived in Salt Lake City. Harris replied \\"to see what was going on in there.\\" Martin Harris interview with Anthony Metcalf, c. 1873‚Äì74 in EMD, 2:348. In a letter of 1870, Harris swore, \\"no man ever heard me in any way deny the truth of the Book of Mormon, the administration of the angel that showed me the plates, nor the organization of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints under the administration of Joseph Smith, Jun., the prophet whom the Lord raised up for that purpose in these the latter days, that he may show forth his power and glory.\\"Letter of Martin Harris, Sr., to Hanna B. Emerson, January 1871, Smithfield, Utah Territory, in EMD, 2: 338. See also Richard Lloyd Anderson, Investigating the Book of Mormon Witnesses, (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1981), 118. = David Whitmer = David Whitmer David Whitmer first became involved with Joseph Smith and the golden plates through his friend Oliver Cowdery, and, because of his longevity, became the most interviewed of the Three Witnesses. Whitmer gave various versions of his experience in viewing the golden plates. Although less credulous than Harris, Whitmer had his own visions and owned a seer stone.Palmer, 180‚Äì81, 193‚Äì94, 197‚Äì99. In 1829, before testifying to the truth of the golden plates, Whitmer reported that while traveling with Smith to his father's farm in Fayette, New York, they had seen a Nephite on the road who suddenly disappeared. Upon arrival at his father's house, they were \\"impressed\\" that the same Nephite was under the shed.EMD, 5: 10-11, Whitmer interview with Edward Stevenson, December 1877, EMD 5: 30-31. Recounting the vision to Orson Pratt in 1878, Whitmer claimed to have seen not only the golden plates but the, Brass Plates, \\"... the sword of Laban, the Directors and the Interpreters.\\"David Whitmer interview with Orson Pratt, September 1878, in EMD, 5: 43. On other occasions, Whitmer's vision of the plates seemed far less corporeal. When asked in 1880 for a description of the angel who showed him the plates, Whitmer said the angel \\"had no appearance or shape.\\" Asked by the interviewer how he then could bear testimony that he had seen and heard an angel, Whitmer replied, \\"Have you never had impressions?\\" To which the interviewer responded, \\"Then you had impressions as the Quaker when the spirit moves, or as a good Methodist in giving a happy experience, a feeling?\\" \\"Just so,\\" replied Whitmer.Whitmer interview with John Murphy, June 1880, in EMD 5: 63. James Henry Moyle, a young Mormon lawyer, interviewed Whitmer in 1885 and asked if there was any possibility that Whitmer had been deceived. \\"His answer was unequivocal ... that he saw the plates and heard the angel with unmistakable clearness.\\" But Moyle went away \\"not fully satisfied .... It was more spiritual than I anticipated.\\"Moyle diary, June 28, 1885 in EMD 5: 141. In 1831, Whitmer moved with early Mormon believers to Kirtland, Ohio. In 1832, he followed the church to Jackson County, Missouri, and was named president of the church though he had criticized Smith's more recent innovations. By December 1837, a movement led by Warren Parrish plotted to overthrow Smith and replace him with Whitmer. After the collapse of the Kirtland Bank, confrontation grew between the dissenters and those loyal to Smith. Whitmer, his brother John, Oliver Cowdery, and others were harassed by the Danites, a secret group of Mormon vigilantes, and were warned to leave the county. Whitmer was formally excommunicated on April 13, 1838 and never rejoined the church.Michael J. Latzer, \\"Whitmer, David\\" American National Biography Online Feb. 2000. Whitmer moved to Richmond, Missouri, where he ran a livery stable and became a civic leader. After Smith's assassination, Whitmer, like Martin Harris, briefly followed James Strang, who had his own set of supernatural metal plates. Later, Whitmer organized his own splinter group based on his authority as one of the Three Witnesses and even later supported another group headed by his brother John. In his pamphlet, \\"An Address to All Believers in Christ\\" (1887), Whitmer reaffirmed his witness to the golden plates,\\"I wish now, standing as it were, in the very sunset of life, and in the fear of God, once for all to make this public statement: 'That I have never at any time denied that testimony or any part thereof, which has so long since been published with that Book, as one of the three witnesses. Those who know me best, will know that I have always adhered to that testimony. And that no man may be misled or doubt my present views in regard to the same, I do again affirm the truth of all of my statements, as then made and published.\\" ThreeWitness.org website . but he also criticized Smith, including the introduction of plural marriage. \\"If you believe my testimony to the Book of Mormon, if you believe that God spake to us three witnesses by his own voice,\\" wrote Whitmer, \\"then I tell you that in June, 1838, God spake to me again by his own voice from the heavens, and told me to 'separate myself from among the Latter Day Saints, for as they sought to do unto me, should it be done unto them.'\\".\\"An Address,\\" 27, in EMD, 5: 194. Nevertheless, Whitmer is regarded by Mormons as an \\"enduring witness to the genuineness of the prophet Joseph Smith and his message.\\" Notes References   1829 in Christianity 1829 in New York (state) 1830 in Christianity 1830 in New York (state) Angelic visionaries 3 witnesses Doctrine and Covenants people Fayette, New York Trios ","title":"Three Witnesses"},{"id":"1384837","text":" Wolf Eyes is an American experimental music group from Detroit, Michigan, formed in 1996 by Nate Young. Currently a duo, Wolf Eyes are a prominent act within contemporary noise music. They have collaborated with a variety of artists from different countries and art forms. History Wolf Eyes began as a solo project of Nate Young. Aaron Dilloway joined in 1998 while also playing with John Olson in Universal Indians. Olson occasionally performed with Wolf Eyes under the moniker Spykes and joined Wolf Eyes in 2000 after Universal Indians disbanded. In 2005, Dilloway left Wolf Eyes, disinterested in extensive touring. Mike Connelly (of Hair Police, Failing Lights and Clay Rendering) replaced Dilloway, first appearing on their 2006 album Human Animal. Dilloway did some production work on Human Animal. He has since performed with them on at least two occasions. It was announced in February 2013 that Connelly had left the group to concentrate on his solo work and Hair Police. He was replaced in the lineup by another Michigan musician, Jim Baljo. Both Aaron Dilloway and Mike Connelly appeared on the 2013 album No Answer: Lower Floors. Wolf Eyes is currently composed of Young and Olson; the latter described the band as a \\"morphed organism that expands and condenses as needed or not.\\" The group has released 297 recordings during their 20 years of ceaseless prolific activity. Official releases have appeared on labels including but not limited to Hanson Records, Bulb Records, American Tapes, Fusetron, De Stijl Records, Sub Pop, Third Man Records, Troubleman Unlimited, AA Records, Gods of Tundra and Freedom From. They have collaborated and performed with numerous artists including Anthony Braxton, Merzbow, Sonic Youth, Black Dice, Dominick Fernow (also known as Prurient), Double Leopards, John Wiese, Mammal, FLUCT, MV Carbon, Twig Harper, Andrew W.K., Jaimie Branch, Emil Beaulieau, Richard Pinhas, and Smegma. Since 2013, John Olson runs the Instagram account inzane_johnny, formerly wolf_eyes_psychojazz, which was initially used to promote Wolf Eyes but has now gained a large following through music related memes. Reception and influence In an article for Spin Magazine, Henry Rollins named member John Olson's noise bands in a column about his 5 favorite bands stating \\"The guy has over 1,000 releases on his label, and I have almost 700 of them. I have a great deal of time for all of these noise terrorists ‚Äî it's modern avant-meets-stoners in a basement....\\" Fred Thomas of AllMusic observed Distribution Most Wolf Eyes recordings are self-released, following the DIY tradition of bands such as Smegma. Their first major release was the studio album Dread, released on the American Tapes and Hanson Records labels but distributed through Bulb Records. Other major releases include Dead Hills on Troubleman Unlimited as well as Burned Mind and Human Animal on Sub Pop. Most Wolf Eyes recordings are released as either lathe cuts, cassettes, or CD-rs.

Originally, Miles had intended Sabbath to be a one-off character, but BBC Books editor Justin Richards asked to use the character in a continuing story arc. Sabbath was born in 1740. He was educated at Cambridge before being initiated into the Secret Service in 1762. He then defected from the service in 1780. The Doctor first encountered Sabbath in 1782. In appearance, Sabbath was a large muscular man with a shaven head. He commanded intelligent ape creatures called Babewyns which also crewed his ship, the Jonah. Visually, the Doctor Who version is said to be based on Orson Welles. Despite suggestions to the contrary, Sabbath is not based on the equally corpulent character Sunday from the novel The Man Who Was Thursday (1904) by G. K. Chesterton, though this is jokingly alluded to in the Doctor Who novel History 101 (2002). Character history Sabbath first appears as the unnamed character who brings Anji Kapoor out of a fugue state in The Slow Empire, although from her perspective she hasn't met him yet. In his first appearance, we learn that Sabbath was originally a renegade member of the British Secret Service during the late 18th century. It was explained that it is customary for agents to take Biblical names, and Sabbath's name derived itself from a Jewish Kabalistic trend in the Service during the time period of his initiation. His initiation into the Service involved him being thrown into the River Thames bound in thirteen chains and thirteen locks, covered in sackcloth. Sabbath survived by encountering Leviathan, who rescued him. When the Doctor encountered him, Sabbath was attempting to build a temporal battleship, the Jonah, in order to travel beyond the realm of human understanding, though he was callous about other people's lives in his quest. Indeed, Sabbath was not the main villain of the book, and was in fact instrumental in saving the Doctor's life. Sabbath's literal role was made clear when the Doctor spoke with a character that fans assume by the description to be the Master (though he is never mentioned explicitly). The Master claimed that Sabbath-like characters were the new masters of time, a position once held by the Doctor's people until the destruction of their home world. Sabbath was intended as a new breed of villain, time-active and less apt to pure megalomania. Sabbath believed himself to be the protector of humanity. He was first drawn to the Doctor believing him to be responsible for the arrival of the Babewyn creatures on Earth. When the Doctor fell ill, Sabbath removed the Doctor's second heart from his body which had become shrunken and blackened, apparently as a result of Gallifrey's destruction. Sabbath then implanted that heart into himself in an attempt to gain the time- travelling capability of a Time Lord. The Doctor is manipulated by Sabbath in several of his subsequent adventures, with Anachrophobia and History 101 seeing Sabbath create a situation where the Doctor will perceive a race of clock-faced creatures and an agent for a complex information-gathering system as a threat, when in reality they were only a true threat to Sabbath's associates, with the clock-faced-creatures' 'invasion' of a human colonly actually being an evacuation from their destruction by Sabbath's masters in the Time Vortex and the system only a threat as it might have recorded information Sabbath's allies would prefer kept discreet. In Trading Futures, the Doctor also encountered some of Sabbath's new agents, allegedly trying to protect the timeline while seeing the Doctor as a renegade, but they lacked Sabbath's skill and were defeated by the Doctor's semi-ally Cosgrove. When the Doctor was crushed by a 30-pound theatre sandbag in the England of 1893 (Camera Obscura by Lloyd Rose), he discovered that he could not die whilst his second heart was lodged within Sabbath. Sabbath later removed the heart, severing the biodata link between the two of them. During this time, the Doctor learned that Sabbath believed that time travellers created new timelines every time they travelled, with the universe allegedly unable to exist if too many of these timelines were created. When Sabbath tried to use an event in the Siberia of 1893 (Time Zero by Justin Richards) to collapse all of reality down to a single timeline, the Doctor's interference instead caused the creation of multiple parallel universes by breaking down the barriers between parallel universes. Sabbath set about trying to save the true reality, but his actions were hindered by his comparatively limited understanding of Time causing him to misunderstand how to limit the damage (as well as the actions of an alternate version of himself that had been manipulated by his associates' enemies (The Domino Effect)). In Timeless by Stephen Cole he was instrumental in doing so, although he and the Doctor were trying to reach similar goals at cross purposes. It was revealed that he worked for beings which claimed to be the future of humanity, and told him he was working to make humans the new Time Lords. When he learnt this was untrue, he turned against them. In Sometime Never..., also by Richards, Sabbath's former employers were revealed as the Council of Eight, eight crystalline entities (who coincidentally resembled the eight Doctors) based in the time vortex. The Council gained power from making accurate predictions, hence their interest in maintaining a stable single timeline. In order to ensure their power, their corrupt leader, Octan, had made a prediction that human history would be destroyed before it began, with the energy of such a vast prediction permanently stabilizing his peoples' existence, but he still required a sufficiently significant predicted event to power the weapon that would destroy Earth's sun in the first place. After Octan confirmed that the prediction was based on whether Sabbath would kill the Doctor or Octan at a crucial moment, the Doctor tricked Octan into confirming that he had predicted his own death, but Sabbath, rather than kill the Doctor instead, chose to essentially commit suicide, damning himself to an eternity of agony in the Time Vortex as it was the one action Octan could never have predicted he would do. Other appearances There are in fact three different characters called Sabbath, who may or may not be iterations of the same person in different timelines. The Sabbath who appears in the Doctor Who books exists in a timeline in which the Time Lords have ceased to exist and humanity has become the potential heir to their powers and knowledge. However, the Time Lords (or Great Houses) still exist in the Faction Paradox series, in which Sabbath appears as a young man (voiced by Saul Jaffe in the audio plays and also appearing in the comics) with the Service, ignorant of the wider cosmology.

George Kennan noted in 1885, \\"The mines of Kara, which are the private property of his Imperial Majesty the Tsar, and are worked for his benefit, consist of a series of open gold placers.\\" From south to north over 20 miles of the Kara River, they are Ust Kara, Lower Prison, Political Prison, Lower Diggings, Middle Kara, Upper Kara, and the Upper or Amurski Prison.

Ust- Kara prison in 1891. It existed from 1838 to 1893. During 1873-1890 it held political prisoners. It was closed down because of the Kara Tragedy of 1889. The inmates of Kara katorga were used in gold mining work. Gold was found by the Kara River in 1832. The first rich lode, suitable for exploitation was found in 1838, giving rise to the Lower Kara Field (–ù–∏–∂–Ω–µ-–∫–∞—Ä–∏–π—Å–∫–∏–π –ø—Ä–∏–∏—Å–∫). In 1839, the Upper Kara Field was discovered, and the Middle Kara Field in 1852. The Kara field turned out to be one of the richest in Transbaikalia, at their peak delivering 1 tonne of gold yearly. The majority of workers were criminal convicts, up to 2,000 in number. After national-liberation movements in Poland and Lithuania were suppressed, Polish and Lithuanian insurgents were sent to the Kara katorga. The first small group was sent there after the Polish uprising of 1830-1831. However, the majority of political convicts were Polish insurgents of 1863, about 180 persons. Later a number of Russian revolutionaries were sent there, the majority being members of the Narodnaya Volya organization. In total, 185 men and 32 women were political prisoners at Kara katorga. Kara Tragedy Former underground print shop in Taganrog.¬© TaganrogCity.Com The Kara Tragedy was the events of 6-16 Nov. 1889. Political prisoners enjoyed certain privileges in comparison to criminals. The Katorga administration decided to abolish them, that in combination of harsh treatment of the women convicts, resulted in hunger strikes in protest. Eventually, the governor-general Andrei Korf ordered corporal punishment for a female prisoner of the Ust-Kara settlement. She was Nadezhda Sigida, a 27 year old convict arrested in 1886 for being a member of Narodnaya Volya and establishing an underground printing shop in Taganrog. After being flogged she killed herself with poison. As a protest, 23 other political prisoners also took poison resulting in the death of 6 convicts in total, 4 women and 2 men. This event stirred a public outcry. As a consequence, the Kara katorga was closed, and the use of corporal punishment against imprisoned women and dvorians was abolished by the law of March 28, 1893.

Subtitled \\"A Romantic Novel in Honor of the Passing of a Great Race\\", Hemingway used the work as a spoof of the world of writers. It is Hemingway's first long work and was written as a parody of Sherwood Anderson's Dark Laughter.  Synopsis  Set in northern Michigan, The Torrents of Spring concerns two men who work at a pump factory: World War I veteran Yogi Johnson, and writer Scripps O'Neill. Both are searching for the perfect woman, though they disagree over this ideal. The story begins with O'Neill returning home from the library to find that his wife and small daughter have left him, explaining that \\"It takes a lot to mend the walls of fate.\\" O'Neill, desperate for companionship, befriends a British waitress, Diana, at the restaurant where she works and immediately asks her to marry him. Diana makes an attempt to impress her spouse by reading books from the lists of The New York Times Book Review, including many forgotten pot- boilers of the 1920s. But O'Neill soon leaves her (as she feared he would when she first met him) for another waitress, Mandy, who enthralls him with her store of literary (but possibly made up) anecdotes. Yogi Johnson has a period during which he anguishes over the fact that he doesn't seem to desire any woman at all, even though spring is approaching, \\"which turns a young man's fancy to love.\\" At last, he falls in love with an aboriginal American woman who enters a restaurant clothed only in moccasins, the wife of one of the two aboriginal Americans he befriends near the end of the story, in the penultimate chapter. Johnson is cured of his impotence when, viewing the naked squaw, he is overcome by \\"a new feeling\\" which he hastens to attribute to Mother Nature, and together they \\"light out for the territories.\\"  Publication  It was widely believed that Hemingway wrote The Torrents of Spring in an effort to get out of his contract with his publisher Boni & Liveright, though Hemingway denied this. They held the right of first refusal for his next three books, one of which was to be a novel, with the proviso that the contract would be terminated if one of the three were rejected. By rejecting Torrents, Boni & Liveright terminated the contract. In his letters, Hemingway shows a passionate affection for his novella. He corresponded with Sherwood Anderson in May‚ÄìJuly 1926, stating that his motivation for writing his first long work was more motivated by his refusal to \\"pull punches\\" and encourage sub-par work out of Anderson‚Äîas his peer‚Äîand not to simply get out of a contract with Boni & Liveright. Written in ten days, The Torrents of Spring was a satirical treatment of pretentious writers. Hemingway submitted the manuscript early in December 1925, and it was rejected by the end of the month. In January 1926, Max Perkins at Scribner's agreed to publish The Torrents of Spring in addition to Hemingway's future work. The Torrents of Spring was published by Scribner's in May of that year; the first edition had a print run of 1250 copies.  Critical reception  Mixed reaction greeted the novella, itself sharply critical of other writers. The work is generally dismissed by critics and seen as vastly less important than The Sun Also Rises, which was published in the same year. Hadley Richardson, Hemingway's wife at the time, believed his characterization of Anderson was \\"nasty\\", while John Dos Passos considered it funny but did not want to see it published. F. Scott Fitzgerald, on the other hand, considered the novella a masterpiece. Little scholarly criticism has been devoted to The Torrents of Spring, as it is considered less important than Hemingway's subsequent work.  References   Sources  Berg, A. Scott (1979).

Zemmama represented Morocco at the 2004 Summer Olympics and was first capped at full international level in 2008. Club career =Raja Casablanca= Born in Sal√©, Zemmama started his professional career when he joined Raja Casablanca in 2001. He helped the club win the CAF Confederation Cup in 2003. And the Moroccan Botola in 2004, and also 2 Morocco Throne Cups in 2002 and 2005, and Arab Champions League 2006 =Hibernian= Zemmama joined Hibernian under freedom of contract in August 2006. A diminutive playmaker, Zemmama made his debut for Hibernian on 12 August 2006 in a 0‚Äì0 draw at Inverness. He was hailed by manager Tony Mowbray as a new Russell Latapy and his early performances excited the Hibernian fans. Zemmama scored his first goal for Hibs in a 2‚Äì2 draw with Edinburgh derby rivals Hearts on 15 October 2006. Zemmama was part of the team that won the 2007 Scottish League Cup Final and featured significantly in both the 2006‚Äì07 and 2007‚Äì08 seasons. During the later stages of the 2007‚Äì08 season, Zemmama broke a bone in his foot after turning awkwardly during training. This injury kept him out of the rest of the season and the start of the following season. Transfer dispute In August 2006 it was reported that Raja Casablanca were disputing the legality of Zemmama's transfer to Hibernian. Raja stated that the player had signed a contract with them until 2009, which would have precluded him from signing a contract with Hibernian. Rod Petrie refuted the claim that Zemmama had a contract with Raja. The Royal Moroccan Football Federation announced on 30 August that they had suspended the player pending an investigation into the transfer. FIFA stated that the player could continue to be selected for Hibs during the investigation. FIFA then stated that the main allegation ‚Äì that the international transfer certificate had been forged ‚Äì was a criminal matter. FIFA closed their investigation, pending the outcome of enquiries by the Moroccan police. Al-Shaab loan During early September 2008, Zemmama was transferred to Al-Shaab on a season-long loan deal due to personal issues. His pregnant wife, Zineb, was unable to enter the UK because she was only 17 years old. Zemmama requested to Hibs that he be transferred to a club where he could live with his wife. The intention of the loan deal was that Zemmama's wife would be 18 years old by the time it expired, making her able to enter the UK. However, after Zemmama moved to the Al-Shaab, the Government increased the age at which brides could enter the UK to 21, throwing Zemmama's return to Hibernian into doubt. Zemmama returned to Edinburgh for the start of the 2009‚Äì10 season, however, in the belief that his wife and young son would be allowed to live in Edinburgh. =Return to Hibernian= After returning from the loan to Al- Shaab, Zemmama again became a \\"key influence\\" in the Hibs team. He suffered injury problems during the 2009‚Äì10 season, however, and was ruled out for the rest of the season after suffering cruciate ligament damage during a match against Falkirk on 27 March. That match had been his comeback from unrelated injuries that had prevented him from starting a game since 17 February. Manager John Hughes admitted in August that he did not expect Zemmama to return before Christmas, as he had not yet commenced jogging exercises as part of his rehabilitation. Zemmama, whose contract with Hibs was due to expire at the end of the 2010‚Äì11 season, returned to full training in December. =Middlesbrough= Zemmama signed for Middlesbrough on 31 January 2011. He agreed a contract to the end of the 2013‚Äì14 season, having been transferred for a fee reported to be around ¬£200,000. He made his debut against Swansea City. In his second appearance, against Millwall, he set up goals for Scott McDonald and Leroy Lita. Zemmama scored his first goal for the club in a 2‚Äì1 win against Derby County. Zemmama scored in Middlesbrough's League Cup defeat to Crystal Palace. In April 2012, Zemmama scored the winning goal in a match against Southampton, which kept Middlesbrough's chance of promotion alive. It was reported that Zemmama had refused to travel if he was amongst the substitutes in the final matchday against Watford; Mowbray subsequently withdrew him from his travelling squad. Zemmama scored his third Boro goal, and his first goal of the 2012‚Äì13 campaign on 25 August 2012 against Crystal Palace with a free-kick which flew past the Palace wall and then beat Julian Speroni. On 25 September 2012, Zemmama scored a 25-yard goal against Preston North End in the League Cup, in which Middlesbrough progressed to the next round with a 3‚Äì1 victory. Middlesbrough and Zemmama parted company by mutual consent on 1 July 2013. Zemmama made 48 appearances for Middlesbrough in total, scoring seven goals. =Return to Raja Casablanca= On 27 August 2013, Zemmama signed a two years free transfer contract for Raja Casablanca. Zemmama was very famous with his number 5 shirt when he was playing in Moroccan Championship, but this time he chose to get number 55 because his teammate Mouhssine Moutouali is now the one who wears his old number. International career Zemmama represented his country at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Greece, but only played in the second half of Morocco's last game, a 2‚Äì1 win against Iraq.Match Report, FIFA. The Moroccan federation banned him from international football, however, after his transfer to Hibernian was disputed.

Signs and symptoms include low back pain, pain that radiates down the leg, numbness around the anus, and loss of bowel or bladder control. Onset may be rapid or gradual. The cause is usually a disc herniation in the lower region of the back. Other causes include spinal stenosis, cancer, trauma, epidural abscess, and epidural hematoma. The diagnosis is suspected based on symptoms and confirmed by medical imaging such as MRI or CT scan. CES is generally treated surgically via laminectomy. Permanent bladder problems, sexual dysfunction or numbness may occur despite surgery. A poor outcome occurs in about 20% of people despite treatment. About 1 in 70,000 people is affected every year. It was first described in 1934. Signs and symptoms Approximate area of \\"saddle anesthesia\\" seen from behind (yellow highlight) * Severe back pain * Saddle anesthesia (see diagram), i.e., anesthesia or paraesthesia involving S3 to S5 dermatomes, including the perineum, external genitalia and anus; or more descriptively, numbness or \\"pins-and-needles\\" sensations of the groin and inner thighs which would contact a saddle when riding a horse. * Bladder and bowel dysfunction, caused by decreased tone of the urinary and anal sphincters. Detrusor weaknesses causing urinary retention and post-void residual incontinence as assessed by bladder scanning the patient after the patient has urinated. * Sciatica-type pain on one side or both sides, although pain may be wholly absent * Weakness of the muscles of the lower legs (often paraplegia) * Achilles (ankle) reflex absent on both sides. * Sexual dysfunction * Absent anal reflex and bulbocavernosus reflex *Gait disturbance Severe back pain, saddle anesthesia, incontinence and sexual dysfunction are considered \\"red flags\\", i.e. features which require urgent investigation. Causes After the conus medullaris, the canal contains a mass of nerves (the cauda equina or \\"horse-tail\\") that branches off the lower end of the spinal cord and contains the nerve roots from L1-5 and S1-5. The nerve roots from L4-S4 join in the sacral plexus which affects the sciatic nerve, which travels caudally (toward the feet). Compression, trauma or other damage to this region of the spinal canal can result in cauda equina syndrome. The symptoms may also appear as a temporary side-effect of a sacral extra-dural injection: =Trauma= Direct trauma can also cause cauda equina syndrome. Most common causes include as a complication of lumbar punctures, burst fractures resulting in posterior migration of fragments of the vertebral body, severe disc herniations, spinal anaesthesia involving trauma from catheters and high local anaesthetic concentrations around the cauda equina, penetrating trauma such as knife wounds or ballistic trauma. =Spinal stenosis= CES can be caused by lumbar spinal stenosis, which is when the diameter of the spinal canal narrows. This could be the result of a degenerative process of the spine (such as osteoarthritis) or a developmental defect which is present at birth. In the most severe cases of spondylolisthesis cauda equina syndrome can result. =Inflammatory conditions= Chronic spinal inflammatory conditions such as Paget disease, neurosarcoidosis, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid disease of the spine, and chronic tuberculosis can cause it. This is due to the spinal canal narrowing that these kinds of syndromes can produce. =Risk factors= Individuals most at risk for disc herniation are the most likely to develop CES. Race has little influence with the notable exception that African Americans appear slightly less likely to develop CES than other groups. Middle age also appears to be a notable risk factor, as those populations are more likely to develop a herniated disc; heavy lifting can also be inferred as a risk factor for CES. Other risk factors include obesity and being female. Diagnosis MRI of an abscess causing cauda equina syndrome. Examination for pain sensation, by pinprick, shows leg (lumbar nerves) analgesia with perineal (sacral nerves) escape. The maintenance of perineal sensation with absence of pain sensation over the lumbar nerve roots is typical for an extra-medullary and intra-thecal (outside the cord and within the dural sheath) process. Inability to walk, with this unusual sensory examination completes a triad of signs and usually represents spinal tuberculosis. The triad is paraplegia with lumbar loss of pain sensation and presence of perineal altered sensation. Diagnosis is usually confirmed by an MRI scan or CT scan, depending on availability. Bladder scanning and loss of catheter sensation can also be used to diagnose an onset of cauda equina syndrome and can aid diagnosis before MRI scanning. Early surgery in acute onset of severe cases has been reported to be important. Prevention Early diagnosis can allow for preventive treatment. Signs that allow early diagnosis include changes in bowel and bladder function and loss of feeling in groin. Changes in sensation can start as pins and needles leading to numbness. Changes in bladder function may be changes to stream or inability to empty bladder fully. If a person progresses to full retention intervention is less likely to be successful. Management The management of true cauda equina syndrome frequently involves surgical decompression. When cauda equina syndrome is caused by a herniated disk early surgical decompression is recommended. Cauda equina syndrome of sudden onset is regarded as a medical/surgical emergency. Surgical decompression by means of laminectomy or other approaches may be undertaken within 6, 24 or 48 hours of symptoms developing if a compressive lesion, e.g., ruptured disc, epidural abscess, tumor or hematoma is demonstrated. Early treatment may significantly improve the chance that long-term neurological damage will be avoided. Surgery may be required to remove blood, bone fragments, a tumor or tumors, a herniated disc or an abnormal bone growth. If the tumor cannot be removed surgically and it is malignant then radiotherapy may be used as an alternative to relieve pressure, with spinal neoplasms chemotherapy can also be used. If the syndrome is due to an inflammatory condition e.g., ankylosing spondylitis, anti-inflammatory, including steroids can be used as an effective treatment. If a bacterial infection is the cause then an appropriate course of antibiotics can be used to treat it. Cauda equina syndrome can occur during pregnancy due to lumbar disc herniation; age of mother increases the risk. Surgery can still be performed and the pregnancy does not adversely affect treatment. Treatment for those with cauda equina can and should be carried out at any time during pregnancy. Lifestyle issues may need to be addressed post - treatment. Issues could include the person's need for physiotherapy and occupational therapy due to lower limb dysfunction. Obesity might also need to be tackled. =Bowel and bladder control= Rehabilitation of CES depends on the severity of the injury. If permanent damage occurs, then impairment in bladder and bowel control may result. Once surgery is performed, resting is required until the bladder and bowel dysfunction can be assessed. Urinary catheterization may help with bladder control. Gravity and exercise can help control bowel movement (Hodges, 2004). Pelvic floor exercises assist in controlling bowel movements (Pelvic Floor Exercises, 2010). These exercises can be done standing, lying, or on all fours with the knees slightly separated. Full recovery of bowel and bladder control can take as long as two years. Prognosis The prognosis for complete recovery is dependent upon many factors. The most important of these is the severity and duration of compression upon the damaged nerve(s). Generally, the longer the time before intervention to remove the compression causing nerve damage, the greater the damage caused to the nerve(s). Damage can be so severe that nerve regrowth is impossible, and the nerve damage will be permanent. In cases where the nerve has been damaged but is still capable of regrowth, recovery time is widely variable. Surgical intervention with decompression of the cauda equina can assist recovery. Delayed or severe nerve damage can mean up to several years' recovery time because nerve growth is exceptionally slow. Review of the literature indicates that around 50-70% of patients have urinary retention (CES-R) on presentation with 30-50% having an incomplete syndrome (CES-I). The latter group, especially if the history is less than a few days, usually requires emergency MRI to confirm the diagnosis followed by prompt decompression. CES-I with its more favourable prognosis may become CES-R at a later stage. Epidemiology The nerve roots extending from the lumbar spine are susceptible to compression, leading to CES. Intervertebral discs can be dislocated to different degrees, contributing to such compression. Various etiologies of CES include fractures, abscesses, hematomas, and any compression of the relevant nerve roots. Injuries to the thoracolumbar spine will not necessarily result in a clinical diagnosis of CES, but in all such cases it is necessary to consider. Few epidemiological studies of CES have been done in the United States, owing to difficulties such as amassing sufficient cases as well as defining the affected population, therefore this is an area deserving of additional scrutiny. Traumatic spinal cord injuries occur in approximately 40 people per million annually in the United States, resulting from traumas due to motor vehicle accidents, sporting injuries, falls, and other factors. An estimated 10 to 25% of vertebral fractures will result in injury to the spinal cord. Thorough physical examinations are required, as 5 to 15% of trauma patients have fractures that initially go undiagnosed. The most frequent injuries of the thoracolumbar region are to the conus medullaris and the cauda equina, particularly between T12 and L2. Of these two syndromes, CES is the more common. CES mainly affects middle-aged individuals, particularly those in their forties and fifties, and presents more often in men. It is not a typical diagnosis, developing in only 4 to 7 out of every 10,000 to 100,000 patients, and is more likely to occur proximally. Disc herniation is reportedly the most common cause of CES, and it is thought that 1 to 2% of all surgical disc herniation cases result in CES. Society and culture CES affects mainly middle-aged individuals. There is a significant cost associated with hospital admissions, as CES is considered an emergent condition. CES is often concurrent with congenital or degenerative diseases and represents a high cost of care to those admitted to the hospital for surgery. Hospital stays generally last 4 to 5 days, and cost an average of $100,000 to $150,000. Delays in care for cauda equina results in the English NHS paying about ¬£23 million a year in compensation.  Other animals  Degenerative lumbosacral stenosis (DLSS), also known as cauda equina syndrome, is a pathologic degeneration in the lumbosacral disk in dogs; affecting the articulation, nerve progression, tissue and joint connections of the disk. This degeneration causes compressions in soft tissues and nerve root locations in the ultimate caudal area of the medulla, causing neuropathic pain in the lumbar vertebrae.

From left to right are: May Mossell; Alvarilla Mossell; Charles Mossell; Aaron Albert Mossell II; and Nathan Francis Mossell (1856-1946). Aaron Albert Mossell II was born in Hamilton, Ontario in 1863, the youngest of six children. His parents had moved with their first three children from Maryland to Hamilton in the 1850s to escape the racial discrimination in the United States. His father Aaron Albert Mossell I (born 1824), the grandson of slaves, became a brickmaker and in Hamilton went to school to learn to read and write. His mother Eliza Bowers was a free woman from Baltimore whose family had been deported to Trinidad when she was a child. She returned later and met Mossell. By 1870 the family had returned to the United States and lived in Lockport, New York. Aaron Mossell II graduated from Lincoln University. He earned his law degree at the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1888 as the first African American to graduate. Mossell practiced law with two African-American partners in offices in the Witherspoon Building. He was solicitor of the Frederick Douglass Memorial Hospital, where his brother Nathan was medical director. He was said to have defended some African-American men after the racial riots of 1917-1919 in Philadelphia. He died on February 1, 1951 in Cardiff, Wales. Marriage and family Mossell married Mary Louisa Tanner in Philadelphia around 1890. They had three children. Aaron Albert Tanner III (1893-1959) became a pharmacist in Philadelphia. Elizabeth Mossell Anderson (1894‚Äì1975) became Dean of Women at Virginia State College and later at Wilberforce University in Ohio. Sadie Tanner Mossell (1898‚Äì1985), also graduated from Penn and served as an editor of the Law Review., became a practicing lawyer, Assistant City Solicitor and activist on civil rights issues Mossell separated from his wife and family when Sadie was about a year old, and the couple eventually divorced. Later he moved to Cardiff, Wales, where he was living by the 1930s and remained the rest of his life.

The relevant constitutional text is: The Establishment Clause acts as a double security, for its aim is as well the prevention of religious control over government as the prevention of political control over religion. Under it the federal government of the United States as well as the governments of all U.S. states and U.S. territories are prohibited from establishing or sponsoring religion. The clause was based on a number of precedents, including the Constitutions of Clarendon, the Bill of Rights 1689, and the Pennsylvania and New Jersey colonial constitutions. An initial draft by John Dickinson was prepared in conjunction with his drafting the Articles of Confederation. In 1789, then- congressman James Madison prepared another draft which, following discussion and debate in the First Congress, would become part of the text of the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights. The second half of the Establishment Clause includes the Free Exercise Clause, which allows individual citizens freedom from governmental interference in both private and public religious affairs. The Establishment Clause is a limitation placed upon the United States Congress preventing it from passing legislation forcing an establishment of religion, broadly making it illegal for the government to promote theocracy or promote a specific religion with taxes. The second half of the Establishment Clause inherently prohibits the government from preventing the free exercise of religion. While the Establishment Clause does prohibit Congress from preferring or elevating one religion over another, it does not prohibit the government's entry into the religious domain to make accommodations for religious observances and practices in order to achieve the purposes of the Free Exercise Clause. Historical background =Constitutions of Clarendon= The Constitutions of Clarendon, a 12th-century English law, had prohibited criminal defendants' using religious laws (at that time, in medieval England, canon law of the Roman Catholic Church) to seek exemption from criminal prosecution. =1689 Bill of Rights= The 1689 English Bill of Rights secured the rights of all \\"persons\\" to be free from establishment of Roman Catholic laws in the government of England. =Colonial New Jersey and Pennsylvania Constitutions= The original Mason-Dixon line was the demarcation line between the Catholic colony of Maryland and the New Jersey and Pennsylvania colonies, which followed the 1689 Bill of Rights and their own colonial constitutions which provided similar protections against the establishment of Catholic laws in government. =Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom= A possible additional precursor of the Free Exercise Clause was the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom. The statute was drafted by Thomas Jefferson in 1777 and was introduced in the Virginia General Assembly in 1779. It did not pass the General Assembly until 1786. James Madison played an important role in its passage. The statute disestablished the Church of England in Virginia and guaranteed freedom of religion exercise to men of all religious faiths, including Catholics and Jews as well as members of all Protestant denominations. =United States Bill of Rights= The First Amendment is part of a group of 10 Amendments to the United States Constitution known as the Bill of Rights. The idea of adding a Bill of Rights to the Constitution was proposed by George Mason five days before the conclusion of the Constitutional Convention held in Philadelphia in 1787. His proposal was rejected by the other delegates. Alexander Hamilton later argued in The Federalist Papers that a Bill of Rights was unnecessary, claiming that since the Constitution granted limited powers to the federal government, it did not grant the new government the power to abuse the rights that would be secured by a Bill of Rights. Nevertheless, the supporters of the Constitution (known as Federalists) in order to secure its ratification in Massachusetts, agreed to add a group of Amendments to the Constitution after its ratification that would serve as a Bill of Rights. Later, six more states likewise recommended the addition of a Bill of Rights, and the idea also gained the support of Jefferson and Madison. When the First Federal Congress met in 1789, Madison implemented the idea by introducing 17 Amendments to the Constitution. By December 1791, ten of his Amendments were ratified by the necessary three quarters of the states, and they became part of the US Constitution, thereafter becoming known as \\"the Bill of Rights\\". =Concerns of Virginia Baptists= The Establishment Clause addressed the concerns of members of minority faiths who did not want the federal government to establish a state religion for the entire nation. The Baptists in Virginia, for example, had suffered discrimination prior to the disestablishment of the Anglican church in 1786. As Virginia prepared to hold its elections to the state ratifying convention in 1788, the Baptists were concerned that the Constitution had no safeguard against the creation of a new national church. In Orange County, Virginia, two federalist candidates, James Madison and James Gordon Jr., were running against two anti-federalists (opponents of the Constitution), Thomas Barbour and Charles Porter. Barbour requested to John Leland, an influential Baptist preacher and fervent lifelong proponent of religious liberty, that he write a letter to Barbour outlining his objections to the proposed Constitution. See p. 764, footnote 147, which presents a quote from a copy of Leland's letter (as quoted in an article by L.H. Butterfield): \\"Sir, According to your Request, I have sent you my objections to the Foederal Constitution, which are as follows. . . .\\". Leland stated in the letter that, among his other concerns, the Constitution had no Bill of Rights and no safeguards for religious liberty and freedom of the press. A number of historians have concluded on the basis of compelling circumstantial evidence that, just prior to the election in March 1788, Madison met with Leland and gained his support of ratification by addressing these concerns and providing him with the necessary reassurances. In any event, Leland cast his vote for Madison. Leland's support, according to Scarberry, was likely key to the landslide victory of Madison and Gordon. Scarberry states on pp. 775-6: \\"At the very least, it seems probable that Madison met with Leland before the election and persuaded Leland to support Madison's candidacy, which otherwise likely would have failed.\\" Incorporation Prior to the enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1868, the Supreme Court generally held that the substantive protections of the Bill of Rights did not apply to state governments. Subsequently, under the Incorporation doctrine, the Bill of Rights has been broadly applied to limit state and local government as well. The process of incorporating the two Religion Clauses in the First Amendment was twofold. The first step was the Supreme Court's conclusion in 1940 that the Free Exercise Clause was made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment.Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296 (1940) Conceptually, this raised few difficulties: the Due Process Clause protects those rights in the Bill of Rights \\"implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,\\"Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319, 326 (1937) and free exercise of religion is a quintessential individual right (and had been recognized as such at the state level from the beginning). Incorporation of the Establishment Clause in 1947Everson v. Board of Education, 330 U.S. 1 (1947) proved to be problematic in several ways and subject to critique.School District of Abington Township v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203 (1963) (Brennan, J., concurring) (\\"The absorption of the Establishment Clause has, however, come later and by a route less easily charted.\\")Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow, 542 U.S. 1 (2004) (Thomas, J., concurring) (\\"I accept that the Free Exercise Clause . . . applies against the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. But the Establishment Clause is another matter.\\") The controversy surrounding Establishment Clause incorporation primarily stems from the fact that one of the intentions of the Establishment Clause was to prevent Congress from interfering with state establishments of religion that existed at the time of the founding (at least six states had established religions at the founding) ‚Äì a fact conceded by even those members of the Court who believe the Establishment Clause was made applicable to the states through incorporation.Abington v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203 (1963) (Brennan, J., concurring) Critics have also argued that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is understood to incorporate only individual rights found in the Bill of Rights; the Establishment Clause, unlike the Free Exercise Clause (which critics readily concede protects individual rights),Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow, 542 U.S. 1 (2004) (Thomas, J., concurring). does not purport to protect individual rights. Financial assistance The Supreme Court first considered the question of financial assistance to religious organizations in Bradfield v. Roberts (1899). The federal government had funded a hospital operated by a Roman Catholic institution. In that case, the Court ruled that the funding was to a secular organizationthe hospitaland was therefore permissible. In the twentieth century, the Supreme Court more closely scrutinized government activity involving religious institutions. In Everson v. Board of Education (1947), the Supreme Court upheld a New Jersey statute funding student transportation to schools, whether parochial or not. Justice Hugo Black held, The New Jersey law was upheld, for it applied \\"to all its citizens without regard to their religious belief.\\" After Everson, lawsuits in several states sought to disentangle public monies from religious teaching, the leading case being the 1951 Dixon School Case out of New Mexico.Pfeffer, Leo (1967) Church, state, and freedom Beacon Press, Boston, Massachusetts, pages 545-549 The Jefferson quotation cited in Black's opinion is from a letter Jefferson wrote in 1802 to the Baptists of Danbury, Connecticut, that there should be \\"a wall of separation between church and state.\\" Critics of Black's reasoning (most notably, former Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist) have argued that the majority of states did have \\"official\\" churches at the time of the First Amendment's adoption and that James Madison, not Jefferson, was the principal drafter. However, Madison himself often wrote of \\"perfect separation between the ecclesiastical and civil matters\\" (1822 letter to Livingston), which means the authority of the church (that which comes from the church) is decided by church authority, and that which is decided in civil government is decided by civil authorities; neither may decree law or policy in each other's realm. Another description reads: \\"line of separation between the rights of religion and the civil authority... entire abstinence of the government\\" (1832 letter Rev. Adams), and \\"practical distinction between Religion and Civil Government as essential to the purity of both, and as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States\\" (1811 letter to Baptist Churches). In Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971), the Supreme Court ruled that government may not \\"excessively entangle\\" with religion. The case involved two Pennsylvania laws: one permitting the state to \\"purchase\\" services in secular fields from religious schools, and the other permitting the state to pay a percentage of the salaries of private school teachers, including teachers in religious institutions. The Supreme Court found that the government was \\"excessively entangled\\" with religion, and invalidated the statutes in question. The excessive entanglement test, together with the secular purpose and primary effect tests thereafter became known as the Lemon test, which judges have often used to test the constitutionality of a statute on establishment clause grounds. The Supreme Court decided Committee for Public Education & Religious Liberty v. Nyquist and Sloan v. Lemon in 1973. In both cases, states--New York and Pennsylvania-- had enacted laws whereby public tax revenues would be paid to low-income parents so as to permit them to send students to private schools. It was held that in both cases, the state unconstitutionally provided aid to religious organizations. The ruling was partially reversed in Mueller v. Allen (1983). There, the Court upheld a Minnesota statute permitting the use of tax revenues to reimburse parents of students. The Court noted that the Minnesota statute granted such aid to parents of all students, whether they attended public or private schools. While the Court has prevented states from directly funding parochial schools, it has not stopped them from aiding religious colleges and universities. In Tilton v. Richardson (1971), the Court permitted the use of public funds for the construction of facilities in religious institutions of higher learning. It was found that there was no \\"excessive entanglement\\" since the buildings were themselves not religious, unlike teachers in parochial schools, and because the aid came in the form of a one-time grant, rather than continuous assistance. One of the largest recent controversies over the amendment centered on school vouchers--government aid for students to attend private and predominantly religious schools. The Supreme Court, in Zelman v. Simmons-Harris (2002), upheld the constitutionality of private school vouchers, turning away an Establishment Clause challenge.  State-sanctioned prayer in public schools  Earl Warren was Chief Justice when Engel v. Vitale was decided. Further important decisions came in the 1960s, during the Warren Court era. One of the Court's most controversial decisions came in Engel v. Vitale in 1962. The case involved the mandatory daily recitation by public school officials of a prayer written by the New York Board of Regents, which read \\"Almighty God, we acknowledge our dependence upon Thee, and we beg Thy blessings upon us, our parents, our teachers and our Country\\". The Supreme Court deemed it unconstitutional and struck it down, with Justice Black writing \\"it is no part of the official business of government to compose official prayers for any group of American people to recite as part of a religious program carried out by the Government.\\" The reading of the Lord's Prayer or of the Bible in the classroom of a public school by the teacher was ruled unconstitutional in 1963. The ruling did not apply to parochial or private schools in general. The decision has been met with both criticism and praise. Many social conservatives are critical of the court's reasoning, including the late Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist. Conversely, the ACLU and other civil libertarian groups hailed the court's decision. In Abington Township v. Schempp (1963), the case involving the mandatory reading of the Lord's Prayer in class, the Supreme Court introduced the \\"secular purpose\\" and \\"primary effect\\" tests, which were to be used to determine compatibility with the establishment clause. Essentially, the law in question must have a valid secular purpose, and its primary effect must not be to promote or inhibit a particular religion. Since the law requiring the recital of the Lord's Prayer violated these tests, it was struck down. The \\"excessive entanglement\\" test was added in Lemon v. Kurtzman (vide supra). In Wallace v. Jaffree (1985), the Supreme Court struck down an Alabama law whereby students in public schools would observe daily a period of silence for the purpose of private prayer. The Court did not, however, find that the moment of silence was itself unconstitutional. Rather, it ruled that Alabama lawmakers had passed the statute solely to advance religion, thereby violating the secular purpose test.But see The 1990s were marked by controversies surrounding religion's role in public affairs. In Lee v. Weisman (1992), the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional the offering of prayers by religious officials before voluntarily attending ceremonies such as graduation. Thus, the Court established that the state could not conduct religious exercises at public occasions even if attendance was not strictly compulsory. In Lee the Court developed the coercion test. Under this test the government does not violate the establishment clause unless it (1) provides direct aid to religion in a way that would tend to establish a state church, or (2) coerces people to support or participate in religion against their will. In Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v. Doe (2000), the Court ruled that a vote of the student body could not authorize student-led prayer prior to school events. In 2002, controversy centered on a ruling by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow (2002), which struck down a California law providing for the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance (which includes the phrase \\"under God\\") in classrooms. Each House of Congress passed resolutions reaffirming their support for the pledge; the Senate vote was 99‚Äì0 and the House vote was 416‚Äì3. The Supreme Court heard arguments on the case, but did not rule on the merits, instead reversing the Ninth Circuit's decision on standing grounds. Religious displays The inclusion of religious symbols in public holiday displays came before the Supreme Court in Lynch v. Donnelly (1984), and again in Allegheny County v. Greater Pittsburgh ACLU (1989). In the former case, the Court upheld the public display of a cr√®che, ruling that any benefit to religion was \\"indirect, remote, and incidental.\\" In Allegheny County, however, the Court struck down a cr√®che display, which occupied a prominent position in the county courthouse and bore the words Gloria in Excelsis Deo, the words sung by the angels at the Nativity (Luke 2:14 in the Latin Vulgate translation). At the same time, the Allegheny County Court upheld the display of a nearby menorah, which appeared along with a Christmas tree and a sign saluting liberty, reasoning that \\"the combined display of the tree, the sign, and the menorah ... simply recognizes that both Christmas and Hanukkah are part of the same winter-holiday season, which has attained a secular status in our society.\\" In Lynch v. Donnelly the Supreme Court also developed with the endorsement test a further test to determine the constitutionality under the Establishment Clause of certain government actions.For the Endorsement test see Lynch v. Donnelly, . In 2001, Roy Moore, then Chief Justice of Alabama, installed a monument to the Ten Commandments in the state judicial building. In 2003, he was ordered in the case of Glassroth v. Moore by a federal judge to remove the monument, but he refused to comply, ultimately leading to his removal from office. The Supreme Court refused to hear the case, allowing the lower court's decision to stand. On March 2, 2005, the Supreme Court heard arguments for two cases involving religious displays, Van Orden v. Perry and McCreary County v. ACLU of Kentucky. These were the first cases directly dealing with display of the Ten Commandments the Court had heard since Stone v. Graham (1980). These cases were decided on June 27, 2005. In Van Orden, the Court upheld, by a 5‚Äì4 vote, the legality of a Ten Commandments display at the Texas State Capitol due to the monument's \\"secular purpose\\". In McCreary County, however, the Court ruled 5‚Äì4 that displays of the Ten Commandments in several Kentucky county courthouses were unconstitutional because they were not clearly integrated with a secular display, and thus were considered to have a religious purpose. Blue laws In the 1964 case McGowan v. Maryland, the Supreme Court held that blue laws which restricted the sale of goods on Sundays (and were originally intended to increase Church attendance) did not violate the Establishment Clause because they served a present secular purpose of providing a uniform day of rest for everyone.

The Condom Problem. Ch. 10 in Computational Recreations in Mathematica. Redwood City, CA: Addison-Wesley, pp. 203-222, 1991. .) is an optimization problem used as an example that the cheapest capital cost often leads to dramatic increase in operational time, but that the shortest operational time need not be given by the most expensive capital cost. Problem statement M doctors are each to examine each of N patients, wearing gloves to avoid contamination. Each glove can be used any number of times, but the same side of one glove cannot be exposed to more than one person. Gloves can be re-used any number of times, and more than one can be used simultaneously. Given M doctors and N patients, the minimum number of gloves G(M, N) required for all the doctors to examine all the patients is given by: * G(M, N) = M + N ‚àí 2 if both M, N ‚â• 2 * G(M, 1) = M * G(1, N) = N * G(1, 1) = 1 Details A naive approach would be to estimate the number of gloves as simply G(M, N) = MN. But this number can be significantly reduced by exploiting the fact that each glove has two sides, and it is not necessary to use both sides simultaneously. A better solution can be found by assigning each person his or her own glove, which is to be used for the entire operation. Every pairwise encounter is then protected by a double layer. Note that the outer surface of the doctor's gloves meets only the inner surface of the patient's gloves. This gives an answer of M + N gloves, which is significantly lower than MN. The makespan with this scheme is K ¬∑ max(M, N), where K is the duration of one pairwise encounter. Note that this is exactly the same makespan if MN gloves were used. Clearly in this case, increasing capital cost has not produced a shorter operation time. The number G(M, N) may be refined further by allowing asymmetry in the initial distribution of gloves. The best scheme is given by: *Doctor # 1 wears N gloves, layered one on top of another. He visits the N patients in turn, leaving the outermost glove behind with each. *Doctors # 2 to (M ‚àí 1) wear one glove each, and follow the double-layered protocol at each interaction, as described above. *Doctor # M doesn't wear one of his own, but he visits all the N patients, collecting their gloves in turn and turning it into a multilayered glove progressively. Note that in his first encounter, he uses only the untouched inside of Patient # 1's glove, so it's still safe. This scheme uses (1 ¬∑ N) + ((M ‚àí 1 ‚àí 1) ¬∑ 1) + (1 ¬∑ 0) = M + N ‚àí 2 gloves. This number cannot be reduced further. The makespan is then given by: * N serial interactions to plant the gloves. * max(M ‚àí 2, N) parallelized interactions for intermediate stage. * N serial interactions to collect the gloves. Makespan: K ¬∑ (2N + max(M ‚àí 2, N)). Clearly, the minimum G(M, N) increases the makespan significantly, sometimes by a factor of 3\\\\. Note that the benefit in the number of gloves is only 2 units. One or the other solution may be preferred depending on the relative cost of a glove judged against the longer operation time. In theory, the intermediate solution with (M + N ‚àí 1) should also occur as a candidate solution, but this requires such narrow windows on M, N and the cost parameters to be optimal that it is often ignored. Other factors The statement of the problem does not make it clear that the principle of contagion applies, i.e. if the inside of one glove has been touched by the outside of another that previously touched some person, then that inside also counts as touched by that person. Also, medical gloves are reversible; therefore a better solution exists, which uses : \\\\min\\\\left(\\\\lceil M/2\\\\rceil+N, M+\\\\lceil N/2\\\\rceil\\\\right) gloves where the less numerous group are equipped with a glove each, the more numerous in pairs. The first of each pair use a clean interface, the second reverse the glove.

The Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause together read: Free exercise is the liberty of persons to reach, hold, practice and change beliefs freely according to the dictates of conscience. The Free Exercise Clause prohibits government interference with religious belief and, within limits, religious practice. To accept any creed or the practice of any form of worship can't be compelled by laws, because, as stated by the Supreme Court in Braunfeld v. Brown, the freedom to hold religious beliefs and opinions is absolute. Federal or state legislation can't therefore make it a crime to hold any religious belief or opinion due to the Free Exercise Clause. Legislation by the United States or any constituent state of the United States which forces anyone to embrace any religious belief or to say or believe anything in conflict with his religious tenets is also barred by the Free Exercise Clause. In 1878, the Supreme Court was first called to interpret the extent of the Free Exercise Clause in Reynolds v. United States, as related to the prosecution of polygamy under federal law. The Supreme Court upheld Reynolds' conviction for bigamy, deciding that to do otherwise would provide constitutional protection for a gamut of religious beliefs, including those as extreme as human sacrifice. The Court said: \\"Congress cannot pass a law for the government of the Territory which shall prohibit the free exercise of religion. The first amendment to the Constitution expressly forbids such legislation.\\"Reynolds v. United States, Of federal territorial laws, the Court said: \\"Laws are made for the government of actions, and while they cannot interfere with mere religious beliefs and opinions, they may with practices.\\" Jehovah's Witnesses were often the target of such restriction. Several cases involving the Witnesses gave the Court the opportunity to rule on the application of the Free Exercise Clause. Subsequently, the Warren Court adopted an expansive view of the clause, the \\"compelling interest\\" doctrine (whereby a state must show a compelling interest in restricting religion-related activities), but later decisions have reduced the scope of this interpretation. Overview The history of the Supreme Court's interpretation of the Free Exercise Clause follows a broad arc, beginning with approximately 100 years of little attention, then taking on a relatively narrow view of the governmental restrictions required under the clause, growing into a much broader view in the 1960s, and later again receding. The first case to closely examine of the Free Exercise Clause was Reynolds v. United States in 1878. A case dealing with the prosecution of a polygamist under federal law, and the defendant's claim of protection under the Free Exercise Clause, the Court sustained the law and the government's prosecution. The Court read the Free Exercise Clause as protecting religious practices, but that didn't protect Reynolds' practices which were crimes. The court went on to echo Reynolds in the 1890 case Davis v. Beason: \\"However free the exercise of religion may be, it must be subordinate to the criminal laws of the country, passed with reference to actions regarded by general consent as properly the subjects of punitive legislation.\\" The Reynolds case, which also revived Thomas Jefferson's statement regarding the \\"wall of separation\\" between church and state, introduced the position that although religious exercise is generally protected under the First Amendment, this does not prevent the government from passing neutral laws that incidentally impact certain religious practices. This interpretation of the Free Exercise Clause continued into the 1960s and the ascendancy of the Warren Court under chief justice Earl Warren. Applying a new standard of \\"strict scrutiny\\" in various areas of civil rights law, the Court began to apply this standard to the First Amendment religion clauses as well, reading the Free Exercise Clause to require accommodation of religious conduct except where a state could show a compelling interest and no less burdensome means to achieve that end. One example was Sherbert v. Verner, where the Court overturned the state Employment Security Commission's decision to deny unemployment benefits to a practicing member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church who was forced out of a job after her employer adopted a 6-day work week, which would have required her to work on Saturdays against the dictates of her religion. As Justice William Brennan stated for the majority, \\"to condition the availability of benefits upon this appellant's willingness to violate a cardinal principle of her religious faith effectively penalizes the free exercise of her constitutional liberties.\\" This test was used through the years of the Burger Court, including particularly in the landmark case of Wisconsin v. Yoder (1972). This view of the Free Exercise Clause would begin to narrow again in the 1980s, culminating in the 1990 case of Employment Division v. Smith. Examining a state prohibition on the use of peyote, the Supreme Court upheld the law despite the drug's use as part of a religious ritual, and without employing the strict scrutiny test. Instead, the Court again held that a \\"neutral law of general applicability\\" generally does not implicate the Free Exercise Clause. But the Court also stated that governmental discriminiation in the field of religious belief and opinions is barred by the Free Exercise Clause, for the clause entails as core right the right to believe in and express any religious teaching in accordance with the personal desires. Any regulation by the government in the realm of religious belief and opinions is expressly forbidden by the First Amendment. Relying on its own First Amendment case law the Supreme Court concluded in Employment Division v. Smith: \\"The government may not compel affirmation of religious belief, see Torcaso v. Watkins, 367 U. S. 488 (1961), punish the expression of religious doctrines it believes to be false, United States v. Ballard, 322 U. S. 78, 322 U. S. 86-88 (1944), impose special disabilities on the basis of religious views or religious status, see McDaniel v. Paty, 435 U. S. 618 (1978); Fowler v. Rhode Island, 345 U. S. 67, 345 U. S. 69 (1953); cf. Larson v. Valente, 456 U. S. 228, 456 U. S. 245 (1982), or lend its power to one or the other side in controversies over religious authority or dogma, see Presbyterian Church v. Hull Church, 393 U. S. 440, 393 U. S. 445-452 (1969); Kedroff v. St. Nicholas Cathedral, 344 U. S. 94, 344 U. S. 95-119 (1952); Serbian Eastern Orthodox Diocese v. Milivojevich, 426 U. S. 696, 426 U. S. 708-725 (1976).\\" The Court's abandonment of the strict scrutiny test was followed by intense disapproval from Congress and the passage of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act in 1993 to attempt to restore the prior test. However, in City of Boerne v. Flores, the Supreme Court struck down the act as applied to the States, holding that it unconstitutionally attempted to usurp the Supreme Court's role in interpreting the Constitution, thus leaving the Smith test in place. Jehovah's Witnesses cases During the twentieth century, many major cases involving the Free Exercise Clause were related to Jehovah's Witnesses. Many communities directed laws against the Witnesses and their preaching work. From 1938 to 1955, the organization was involved in over forty cases before the Supreme Court, winning a majority of them. The first important victory came in 1938, when in Lovell v. City of Griffin, the Supreme Court held that cities could not require permits for the distribution of pamphlets. In 1939, the Supreme Court decided Schneider v. Town of Irvington, in which it struck down anti-littering laws that were enforced only against Jehovah's Witnesses who were handing out pamphlets. In 1940, the Court considered Cantwell v. Connecticut; the plaintiff, a Jehovah's Witness, was charged with soliciting donations without a certificate from the Public Welfare Council. The Council was to grant the certificate only if the organization requesting it was a charity or sponsored a religious cause. The Supreme Court ruled that any law granting a public body the function of determining if a cause is religious or not violates the First Amendment. In 1940, the Supreme Court decided in Minersville School District v. Gobitis that members of the Jehovah's Witnesses in a school could be required to salute the flag. The ruling in Gobitis, however, did not stand for long. In 1943, West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, the Supreme Court essentially reversed its previous opinion. Justice Frankfurter had, in the Gobitis case, suggested that the Witnesses attempt to reverse the School Board's policy by exercising their vote. In the Barnette case, however, Justice Robert H. Jackson wrote, \\"the very purpose of the Bill of Rights was to withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities ... One's right to life, liberty, and property, to free speech, a free press, freedom of worship and assembly, and other fundamental rights may not be submitted to vote.\\" The Supreme Court did not rule that the Pledge was unconstitutional; rather, they held that students may not be compelled to recite it. Compelling interest The Supreme Court under Earl Warren adopted an expansive view of the Free Exercise Clause. In, Sherbert v. Verner (1963) the Court held that states must have a \\"compelling interest\\" to refuse to accommodate religiously motivated conduct. The case involved Adele Sherbert, who was denied unemployment benefits by South Carolina because she refused to work on Saturdays, something forbidden by her Seventh-day Adventist faith. In Wisconsin v. Yoder (1972), the Court ruled that a law that \\"unduly burdens the practice of religion\\" without a compelling interest, even though it might be \\"neutral on its face,\\" would be unconstitutional. The \\"compelling interest\\" doctrine became much narrower in 1990, when the Supreme Court held in Employment Division v. Smith that, as long as a law does not target a particular religious practice, it does not violate the Free Exercise Clause. In 1993, the Supreme Court revisited the Free Exercise Clause in Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah. Hialeah had passed an ordinance banning ritual slaughter, a practice central to the Santer√≠a religion, while providing exceptions for some practices such as the kosher slaughter of Judaism. Since the ordinance was not \\"generally applicable,\\" the Court ruled that it was subject to the compelling interest test, which it failed to meet, and was therefore declared unconstitutional. In 2017, the Court applied this doctrine in Trinity Lutheran v. Comer, holding that there must be a compelling state interest for express discrimination based on religious status in government funding schemes. Also in 1993, Congress passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), which sought to restore the general applicability of the \\"compelling interest\\" standard present prior to Employment Division v. Smith. However, in City of Boerne v. Flores (1997) the Court struck down as exceeding Congress's powers those provisions of the Act that forced state and local governments to provide protections exceeding those required by the First Amendment. Thus, state and local government actions that are facially neutral toward religion are judged by the Employment Division v. Smith standard rather than RFRA. According to the court's ruling in Gonzales v. UDV (2006), RFRA remains applicable to federal statutes, which must therefore still meet the \\"compelling interest\\" standard in free exercise cases.

The Model 7600 is a progression from the original Model 760 pump-action rifle which Remington produced from 1952 to 1981. Production of the Model Six began in 1981 and was discontinued in 1987. Production of the Sportsman model 76 began in 1985 and was discontinued in 1987. Production of the model 7600 began in 1987 to present. Variants There are a number of variants of the Model 7600 which Remington has manufactured over the years. ;Model 7600 :Introduced in 1981, the standard version is fitted with a conventional wood walnut stock. ;Model 7600 Synthetic :Introduced in 1998, the synthetic model is identical to the standard 7600 except that it has a matte black synthetic stock. ;Model 7600 Carbine :Re-Introduced in 1987, the carbine version is available in .30-06 fitted with a barrel. ;Model 7600 Special Purpose :Offered from 1993 to 1994, the Special Purpose model featured a non- glare finished walnut stock, a matte black finish and sling swivels. ;Model 7600P Patrol Riflehttp://www.remingtonle.com/rifles/7600.htm  Remington Law Enforcement website :Introduced in 2002, the Model 7600P Patrol Rifle in .308 Win featuring an advanced sight system. Answering the call for a low profile, user-friendly patrol rifle, Remington now offers this durable, pump-action rifle for standard duty use. It features a black synthetic stock with sling studs and Wilson Combat ghost-ring rear sights. ;Model 7615 Police Patrol Riflehttp://www.remingtonle.com/rifles/7615.htm  Remington Law Enforcement website :The Model 7615P comes in .223 Remington caliber, uses standard M16/AR-15 style STANAG magazines and has a 16¬Ω\\" barrel. Just like the Model 7600P, the Model 7615P is designed to be a low-profile, user-friendly firearm for police officers to use alongside the Remington Model 870 shotgun.  Features  ;Buttstocks :The 7600 and 7615 models use a similar sized receiver as the 20-gauge version of the 870 shotgun, and thus share a cross compatibility of buttstocks. However, buttstocks made for the more common 12-gauge version of the Remington 870 will usually not fit. ;Barrel :The 7600 and 7615 models feature a free floated barrelModel 7600  Remington attached to the receiver using a UNF bolt screw for enhanced accuracy (contrary to the Model 760 and Model 870 which are not free floated). ;Bolt :Like many pump action rifles, the 7600 has little primary extraction. To aid extraction, the 7600 therefore has a two lug bolt design as an improvement from the multi- lugged bolt on previous models such as the 760.

He was briefly stationed at the Clinton Engineer Works uranium enrichment facility at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and then worked at the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico from August 1944 until February 1946. He provided testimony that helped convict his sister and brother-in-law Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, who were executed for their spying activity. Greenglass served nine and a half years in prison. Early life and career David and Ruth Greenglass Greenglass was born in 1922 in the Lower East Side of Manhattan in New York City. His parents, Barnet and Tessie, were Jewish immigrants from Russia and Austria, respectively. He attended Haaren High School, and graduated in 1940. He attended Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute but did not graduate. Greenglass married Ruth Printz in 1942, when she was 18 years old. The two joined the Young Communist League shortly before Greenglass entered the U.S. Army in April 1943. They had a son and a daughter. He worked as a machinist at Fort Ord, California, and then at the Mississippi Ordnance Plant in Jackson, Mississippi. In July 1944, Greenglass was assigned to the secret Manhattan Project, the wartime project to develop the first atomic weapons. He was first stationed at the Clinton Engineer Works uranium enrichment facility at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, but was there for less than two weeks. In August 1944 he was sent to the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico. In order to pass his security clearance, he disguised or omitted details of his communist associations, and had friends write glowing references. Julius Rosenberg, who had married Greenglass' sister, Ethel, in 1939, had become an agent for the Soviet Union (USSR), working under Alexander Feklisov. In September 1944, Feklisov suggested to Rosenberg that he should consider recruiting his brother-in-law, David Greenglass, and his wife. On September 21, 1944, Feklisov reported to Moscow: \\"They are young, intelligent, capable, and politically developed people, strongly believing in the cause of communism and wishing to do their best to help our country as much as possible. They are undoubtedly devoted to us.\\"Alexander Feklisov, report on David and Ruth Greenglass (September 21, 1944) David wrote to his wife, Ruth: \\"My darling, I most certainly will be glad to be part of the community project [espionage] that Julius and his friends [the Russians] have in mind.\\" After Julius Rosenberg recommended his sister-in-law Ruth Greenglass to his NKVD superiors for the use of her apartment as a safe house for photography, the NKVD realized that David was working on the Manhattan Project. He was then recruited into Soviet espionage by Ruth at Rosenberg's behest in November 1944. Greenglass began to pass nuclear secrets to the USSR via the courier Harry Gold, and more directly with a Soviet official in New York City. According to the Venona project intercepts decrypted by the National Security Agency between 1944 and some time in the 1970s, Greenglass and his wife Ruth were given code names. David was codenamed \\"KALIBR\\" (\\"calibre\\") and Ruth \\"OSA\\" (\\"wasp\\"). Greenglass turned down requests from the Los Alamos Laboratory (and Rosenberg) to work on the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll because he wanted to be with Ruth. He was honorably discharged from the Army on February 29, 1946. Greenglass returned to Manhattan, where, with his brother Bernie, and Julius Rosenberg, he ran a small machine shop known as G & R Engineering. On February 14, 1950, Ruth, who was pregnant with their second child, came too close to the gas heater in their Lower East Side apartment, and her nightgown caught on fire. Greenglass extinguished the blaze, but she suffered severe burns. She was taken to Gouverneur Hospital for skin grafts. He suffered second degree burns to his right hand. He was already aware that the UK and US intelligence agencies had discovered that a Los Alamos theoretical physicist, Klaus Fuchs, had spied for the USSR during the war. Through Fuchs' confession, they found that one of his American contacts had been a man named Harry Gold from Brooklyn, New York. Gold had passed Fuchs' information on to a Soviet agent, performing the role of courier, and Anatoli Yakovlev would then pass the information on to his controllers in the USSR. Through Gold, the FBI's trail led to Greenglass and the Rosenbergs, who had allegedly also used Gold as a courier. When Fuchs was first captured, Julius allegedly gave the Greenglasses $5,000 to finance an escape to Mexico. Instead, they went to the Catskills and used the money to seek legal advice. Trial and aftermath David Greenglass was arrested by the FBI for espionage in June 1950 and quickly implicated Julius Rosenberg. He explicitly denied his sister Ethel's involvement when he testified before a grand jury in August 1950. In February 1951, weeks before the trial, he changed his testimony to claim that Ethel had typed up his notes. He testified against his sister and her husband in court in 1951 as part of an immunity agreement. In exchange for that testimony, the government allowed Ruth to stay with their two children. She was named a co-conspirator, but was never indicted. Greenglass told the court, \\"I had a kind of hero worship there with Julius Rosenberg and I did not want my hero to fail ...\\" Greenglass's sketch of an implosion-type nuclear weapon, illustrating what he gave Ethel and Julius Rosenberg to pass on to the Soviet Union During subsequent testimony in 1951, Greenglass related in detail the secrets he passed on to the Soviet Union. He falsely attributed passing the cross-section drawing of the Atom Bomb to the Soviets to Julius and he also acknowledged passing other sketches through Gold. He described his work on the molds into which were poured the component of the explosive lenses of the Fat Man bombs used for the Trinity nuclear test and in the bombing of Nagasaki. At first this was a matter of difficulty for the prosecution, who wanted Greenglass to testify in open court about the secrets he had given‚Äîsomething which would by definition make them no longer \\"secret\\". The Atomic Energy Commission decided that the implosion concept could be declassified for the trial, and limited all discussion to the weapons used in World War II (fearing that Greenglass may have seen prototypes for future weapons while at Los Alamos). As a result of a surprise defense motion that all testimony about the alleged \\"secret of the atomic bomb\\" be impounded, Federal Judge Irving Kaufman at first made all spectators and news reporters leave the room when Greenglass began testifying about his \\"secrets\\". Ten minutes later, Judge Kaufman invited the news reporters back in, asking them to use their discretion in reporting on Greenglass's testimony. The Rosenbergs' defense attorney, Emanuel H. Bloch, attempted to convince the jury that his clients were concerned about issues of national security, but failed. Greenglass' testimony, later seen to be crude and in the words of many scientists who examined it \\"worthless\\", remained sealed until 1966. He also testified that Rosenberg had stolen and given to the Russians a proximity fuze. However, Aleksander Feklisov also claimed that Julius Rosenberg supplied him with a whole proximity fuze, which would corroborate at least this part of Greenglass' testimony. During the trial, Bloch claimed Greenglass wanted revenge for the machine shop business failure. Bloch attempted to discredit Greenglass' character and testimony. At Greenglass' sentencing hearing, his attorney O. John Rogge repeatedly told the court his client deserved \\"a pat on the back\\" for his testimony and argued that a light sentence, no more than five years, would encourage others to follow his example. Greenglass was sentenced to 15 years in prison. He was released after nine and a half years and reunited with his wife. In March 1953, three months before the Rosenbergs' executions, he wrote a letter for his attorney to deliver to President Eisenhower asking for their sentences to be commuted to prison terms so that they would have an opportunity to confess. He wrote: \\"if these two die, I shall live the rest of my life with a very dark shadow on my conscience\\". He described his own testimony as \\"an act of contrition for the wrong I had done my country, my family and myself\\" and explained how he now viewed its consequences: \\"Here I had to take the choice of hurting someone dear to me, and I took it deliberately. I could not believe that this would be the outcome. May God in His mercy change that awful sentence.\\" That same month he admitted he had stolen a few ounces of uranium-238 from a bomb laboratory at Los Alamos years before and had tossed it into the East River in 1950 after he first denied having stolen it. Later years After his release in 1960, Greenglass and his family lived in New York City under an assumed name. For some years they lived on 228th Street in Laurelton, Queens, New York. In 1996, Greenglass recanted his sworn testimony in an interview with The New York Times reporter Sam Roberts and stated he had lied under oath about the extent of his sister's involvement in the spying plot in order to protect his wife. At the trial, Greenglass had testified that Ethel Rosenberg typed his notes to give to the Russians. However, in the Roberts interview, he stated, \\"I frankly think my wife did the typing, but I don't remember ... My wife is more important to me than my sister. Or my mother or my father, okay? And she was the mother of my children.\\" When Roberts asked Greenglass if he would have done anything differently, he replied, \\"Never.\\" The role of Ethel Rosenberg in her husband's espionage ring remains a matter of dispute. In 2008, when a group of academic historians sought the release of the transcripts of the grand jury proceedings that indicted the Rosenbergs, Greenglass objected to the government's release of his testimony. U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein declined to order the release of the testimony of Greenglass and other surviving witnesses who withheld their consent or could not be located. The grand jury testimony was finally released in July 2015. Greenglass never mentioned involvement by his sister in Rosenberg's delivery of atomic secrets to the Russians. David Greenglass died on July 1, 2014. He was predeceased by his wife, Ruth, who died on April 7, 2008. His death was not publicly announced by his family and was only discovered on October 14, 2014, when The New York Times called the nursing home where he had been living under an assumed name.

Coopetition is a portmanteau of cooperation and competition. Basic principles of co-opetitive structures have been described in game theory, a scientific field that received more attention with the book Theory of Games and Economic Behavior in 1944 and the works of John Forbes Nash on non-cooperative games. Coopetition occurs both at inter-organizational or intra-organizational levels. Overview The concept and term coopetition and its variants have been re-coined several times in history. The concept appeared as early as 1913, being used to describe the relationships among proximate independent dealers of the Sealshipt Oyster System, who were instructed to cooperate for the benefit of the system while competing with each other for customers in the same city.Paul Terry Cherington, Advertising as a Business Force: A Compilation of Experience Records, Doubleday, for the Associated advertising clubs of America, 1913, p. 144. = Inter-organizational = The term and the ideas around co-opetition gained wide attention within the business community after the publication in 1996 of the book by Brandenberger and Nalebuff bearing the same title. Until today this remains the reference work for both researchers and practitioners alike. Giovanni Battista Dagnino and Giovanna Padula's conceptualized in their conference paper (2002) that, at inter- organisational level, coopetition occurs when companies interact with partial congruence of interests. They cooperate with each other to reach a higher value creation if compared to the value created without interaction and struggle to achieve competitive advantage. Often coopetition takes place when companies that are in the same market work together in the exploration of knowledge and research of new products, at the same time that they compete for market-share of their products and in the exploitation of the knowledge created. In this case, the interactions occur simultaneously and in different levels in the value chain. This is the case in the arrangement between PSA Peugeot Citro√´n and Toyota to share components for a new city car‚Äîsimultaneously sold as the Peugeot 107, the Toyota Aygo, and the Citro√´n C1, where companies save money on shared costs while remaining fiercely competitive in other areas. Several advantages can be foreseen, as cost reductions, resources complementarity and technological transfer. Some difficulties also exist, as distribution of control, equity in risk, complementary needs and trust. It is possible for more than two companies to be involved in coopetition with one another. Another possible case for coopetition is joint resource management in construction. Sadegh Asgari and his colleagues (2013) present a short-term partnering case in which construction contractors form an alliance, agreeing to put all or some of their resources in a joint pool for a fixed duration of time and to allocate the group resources using a more cost-effective plan. Marcello Mariani (2007) examined that in practice policy makers and regulators can trigger, promote, and affect coopetitive interactions among economic actors that did not intentionally plan to coopete before the external institutional stakeholders (i.e., a policy maker or regulator) created the conditions for the emergence of coopetititon. Sadegh Asgari, Abbas Afshar and Kaveh Madani (2013) suggested cooperative game theory as the basis for fair and efficient allocation of the incremental benefits of cooperation among the cooperating contractors. Their study introduced a new paradigm in construction resource planning and allocation. Contractors no longer see each other as just competitors; they look for cooperation beyond their competition in order to reduce their costs. = Intra-organizational = At the intra-organizational level, coopetition occurs between individuals or functional units within the same organization. Based on game theory and social interdependence theories, some studies investigate the presence of simultaneous cooperation and competition among functional units, the antecedents of coopetition, and its impact on knowledge sharing behaviors. For example, the concept of coopetitive knowledge sharing is developed to explain mechanisms through which coopetition influences effective knowledge sharing practices in cross-functional teams. The underlying argument is that while organizational teams need to cooperate, they are likely to experience tension caused by diverse professional philosophies and competing goals from different cross-functional representatives.

This type of partnership enables vendors with nominal overlap in their solution portfolio to quickly gain more market share together than when they are operating apart. * In 2000, FIRST Robotics had a competition game titled Co-Opertition FIRST. In 2009, FIRST cofounder Dean Kamen received a patent titled \\"Method for Creating Coopertition\\" (spelled as one word, with no hyphen), which involves giving FIRST Robotics teams some points scored by other teams, to encourage cooperation even as they compete. US FIRST now claims a trademark on the term on its Web site.\\"FIRST values\\" * In the mid-2000s, \\"coopetition\\" began to be used by Darrell Waltrip to describe the phenomenon of drivers cooperating at various phases of a race at \\"high speed\\" tracks such as Daytona and Talladaga where cooperative aerodynamic drafting is critical to a driver's ability to advance through the field. The ultimate goal for each driver, however, is to use the strategy to win. * One of the examples of coopetition in practice in high technology context is the collaborative joint venture formed by Samsung Electronics and Sony formed in 2004 for the development and manufacturing of flat-screen LCD Panels. Coopetition is becoming more critical in high technology contexts because of several challenges such as shrinking product life cycles, need for heavy investments in research and development, convergence of multiple technologies, and importance of technological standards. While it is quite challenging to engage in coopetition (or cooperate with a competitor), coopetition engagements are helpful for firms to address major technological challenges, to create benefits for partnering firms, and to advance technological innovations that benefit the firms, the industry, and consumers. * In 2009, the importance of coopetition was emphasized for Small and Medium- Sized Enterprises (SMEs). As technological battles intensify and technologies become more complex, SMEs face numerous challenges such as rising R&D; costs, high risk and uncertainty in technological development, and lack of resources to pursue large-scale innovation projects. SMEs can more effectively deal with these problems if they work together by combining their own resources and expertise and develop their collective ability so that they can compete effectively with large firms and advance technologies they may not be able to advance alone. * In 2012 and 2013, the concept of 'Coopetitive Knowledge Sharing' was inspired by inter-organization research literature toward developing a Coopetitive Model of Knowledge Sharing that explains (1) how coopetition should be conceptualized, (2) What forms coopetition (three formative constructs of outcome (goal, reward), means (task related), boundary (friendship, geographical closeness, sense of team belonging) interdependencies), and (3) How coopetition and its interrelated components interact and influence knowledge sharing behaviors in cross-functional software teams. This series of publications in the Journal of Systems and Software and Information Processing & Management conceptualize and operationalize the multi-dimensional construct of cross-functional coopetition, and present an instrument for measuring this construct. Cross- functional coopetition is conceptualized with five distinct and independent constructs, three of them are related to cross-functional cooperation (task orientation, communication, interpersonal relationships), and two are associated with cross-functional competition (tangible resources and intangible resources). * In 2013 Compassion Games International, an activity of the Charter for Compassion, used \\"coopetition\\" to describe their annual games between cities about who can commit the most acts of kindness and compassion. * In 2014 the Caring Citizens' Congress,Caring Citizens' Congress an Empathy Surplus Project, used \\"coopetition\\" to describe how to create \\"compassion primaries,\\" where candidates for party office try to find allies in the other parties to cooperate around advancing freedom, compassion and human rights as governing principles.

They released five albums: Diodes (1977), Released (1979), Action-Reaction (1980), Survivors (1982), and Time/Damage Live 1978 (2010). They were one of the first Canadian bands to embrace this style of music and helped to foster the original core Punk scene in Toronto. History The Diodes formed in October 1976 at OCAD University after a chance meeting between members. They played their first gig supporting the Talking Heads in January 1977. The band, along with their manager Ralph Alfonso, went on to open Canada's first punk nightclub, the Crash 'n Burn, in June 1977. Many of the city's founding punk bands played in this iconic venue. The first groups to play the club were The Nerves, on a bill with The Diodes. Other international bands performing at the Crash 'n Burn included The Dead Boys. The club, which was housed in The Diodes' basement rehearsal space, was closed at the end of the summer of 1977, due to complaints by the Liberal Party of Ontario (the principal tenants of the building). The Crash 'n Burn was the subject of a movie by experimental filmmaker Ross McLaren, Crash 'n' Burn. Footage of the club also exists in the CBC Television archives because it was the subject of a TV special in 1977. The band put out their first record in summer 1977, a single featuring Bruce Eves and Amerigo Maras of the Centre for Experimental Art and Communication (CEAC), an avant garde, performance art collective and gallery. Mickey Skin of the all-girl punk band The Curse spews profanities on one side, The Diodes provide musical backing with Paul Robinson counting down the spoken intervals, on the other. It was released on the Crash 'n' Burn label. One side was called \\"Raw\\", the other \\"War\\". It is considered one of the first punk records to come out of Canada. The single was actually part of an issue of the CEAC Newsletter (published by CEAC, the owners of the building that housed the Crash 'n' Burn club). The Diodes played CBGBs in New York in July 1977 supporting The Cramps as part of a Toronto punk bill featuring The Viletones, Teenage Head, The Curse, The B Girls and The Dents. They signed to Columbia Records in Canada shortly afterward in August 1977, releasing their self-titled debut album The Diodes in October 1977. The release was produced by Bob Gallo and was accompanied by a single with two tracks from the LP. The A-side of the single featured a punk-rock deconstruction of the Cyrkle's sixties hit \\"Red Rubber Ball\\". The LP also included a cover of the Max Frost & The Troopers' \\"Shape of Things to Come\\" done in a similar style, along with eight original tunes written by the band. It was domestically released in Europe and Australia, however it was overlooked in the US and UK, where it was import only. The Diodes were featured in the January 9, 1978 issue of Maclean's, on the cover and included in the article \\"The Class of '78: Introducing the New Elite\\". They were touted as the Canadians \\"we'll soon be talking about\\". Others included in this elite group included Wayne Gretzky and Conrad Black.Maclean's January 9, 1978 (p 1, p29-40) On January 20, 1978 they opened for the Ramones and Runaways at the Aragon Ballroom in Chicago to an encore. The band also toured the U.S. east coast during the blizzard of 1978; performing in New York City, Boston, Philadelphia and Baltimore. In 1979 the Diodes released their second Bob Gallo produced LP, on Epic Records in Canada, after a year of delays. Ironically titled Released, after the band's internal problems with the label, it again opened with the track \\"Red Rubber Ball\\". This was due to the song getting US airplay on the American CBS compilation album Permanent Wave. It was followed by nine original tracks, including the highly regarded single, \\"Tired of Waking Up Tired\\", which also got UK domestic release. Unlike the band's debut album, which was exported heavily to the United States by Jem and other record importers, Released was not widely distributed in US record stores and the band seemed to disappear in the minds of many of their fans outside of Canada. 1980 saw the release of the Diodes' third album, Action/Reaction on the independent label Orient Records, distributed by RCA. It was produced by Ian Gunther and Willi Morrison. The band performed concerts in Los Angeles supported by The Circle Jerks and Agent Orange. They also played in San Francisco. The year was rounded off by a cross Canada tour with U2, Ultravox, Gary Numan and Split Enz. In 1981, John Catto and Paul Robinson moved to London, England to launch a short-lived version of The Diodes with a new rhythm section consisting of bassist Steve Robinson (ex-Barracudas) and drummer Richard Citroen (ex-Loved Ones). An album of new material was recorded, but remains unreleased. This version of The Diodes toured Ontario in 1982, to promote the group's fourth album Survivors, a compilation of unreleased outtakes, demos, and live recordings (from the first two albums, live with John Hamilton on drums, plus demo recordings with Mike Lengyell on drums). Upon returning to England, the group metamorphosed into High Noon (consisting of John Catto, Paul Robinson, Steve Robinson, David Buckley (ex- Barracudas, backing vocals), and drummer Rick Zsigmond) in 1983. High Noon lasted until 1985 and were regulars playing around the London scene including headlining The Embassy club and the Marquee Club on Wardour Street. The band also recorded sessions which remain unreleased. High Noon peaked playing an anti-heroin charity gig at The Moonlight Club in West Hampstead supported by The Stone Roses, which culminated in a jam session including High Noon, The Stone Roses and Pete Townshend playing the songs \\"Substitute\\" and \\"The Kids are Alright\\". The group gradually disbanded, with each member going his own way, and singer Paul Robinson and guitarist John Catto remaining in London, England. \\"Tired of Waking Up Tired\\" was listed at No. 23 in the book The Top 100 Canadian Singles, by Bob Mersereau, published by Goose Lane Editions.The Top 100 Canadian Singles by Bob Mersereau, Hard Cover, Goose Lane Editions, Oct. 2010 (p 76-77) On July 2, 2011, The Diodes were voted \\"Best Toronto Band. Ever\\" in a contest run by the Toronto Star. Readers voted for them over the course of a month, beating out such peers as Rush, The Tragically Hip, Martha and the Muffins and others.Toronto Star, Entertainment section, July 2, 2011 (p 4) Reunions and new releases In 1998, Sony Music released Tired of Waking Up Tired: The Best of The Diodes on CD, and in 1999, the band reunited in 1999 to perform one song on The Mike Bullard Show to promote that CD. On May 24, 2007, The Diodes (Robinson, Mackay, Catto) played the Cavern Club in Liverpool as part of the International Pop Overthrow Festival. On May 25, 2007, they did an afternoon concert at Lennon's Bar in Liverpool, also as part of the festival. On June 9, 2007, the original lineup from the first album (Robinson, Mackay, Catto, Hamilton) reunited for 30th anniversary concerts for the NXNE festival. They performed a free afternoon concert at Dundas Square and a midnight show at Sneaky Dees. A live vinyl album of a 1978 concert, Time Damage was released on Rave Up Records (Italy) in February, 2010. Action- Reaction is now on iTunes on Bongo Beat Records (including bonus tracks from the Survivors album) and the physical cd released in Jan, 2012. New tour dates announced for 2015. The original 1977 line-up (Robinson, Catto, Mackay, Hamilton) re-united again in 2010 for touring and recording. They performed at The Horseshoe (Toronto), Call The Office (London), Starlight (Waterloo), This Ain't Hollywood (Hamilton), Road to Ruins Festival (Rome, Italy), Pop Corn Club (Venice, Italy), and The Sound Of Music Festival (Burlington, Canada; with The New York Dolls). The 1977 line-up toured Canada again in November, 2011, but added original 1976 drummer Bent Rasmussen (also of Johnny & The G-Rays) behind the kit while John Hamilton could finally play his album keyboard parts live. The Diodes also presented awards at the 2011 Hamilton Music Awards on Nov 19 and also Nov 20. A documentary about the band 'Circa 1977 The Diodes' directed by Aldo Erdic premiered at NXNE 2010. In 2015, the Diodes reunited once again for a five-city tour: The Phoenix (Toronto), Manantler Brewery (Bowmanville), This Ain't Hollywood (Hamilton), the Brantford Station Gallery (Brantford) and the Phi Centre (Montreal). At the exclusive show for Manantler Brewery in Bowmanville, the Diodes celebrated the creation of their own beer‚ÄîTime Damage, IPA. The tour revealed a dynamic, re- energized Diodes driven by the powerful Keith Moon-style playing of new British drummer John Andrew making his Canadian debut, and perfectly complementing lead guitarist John Catto's Townsend stylings. Original drummer John Hamilton continued in his keyboard role contributing deep-bass synth a la Nine Inch Nails and Jon Lord Hammond accents adding a Prog dimension to the Diodes' proto-Punk.

Career Lamotte has been performing for 30years as of summer 2017. She was a longtime MC and DJ of Ciel Mon Mardi at Sky, before opening her own drag cabaret, Cabaret Mado, in Montreal's Gay Village in 2002. She usually only lip-synchs the opening number, preferring to simply DJ (on certain nights) and bring her comedy talents to bear as MC though she occasionally favours her audience by singing live. Lamotte is also an author, writing a weekly column for the Ici weekly newspaper and a monthly article for the Fugues gay and lesbian newsmagazine. In 2000, she published a collection of her columns entitled Tu vois ben qu'est folle (She's obviously crazy). She has also released in 1996 a single (Le Rap A Minif√©e), had a cameo appearance in the 2003 movie Saved by the Belles, and starred in the 2007 play Saving C√©line, in which she (credited as Mado Lamotte, not Luc Provost) portrayed a drag queen obsessed by C√©line Dion who becomes embroiled in a murder plot against the singer. In 2010, Mado Lamotte released a full length album on Select. It did very well selling more than 20000 physical & digital albums. Lamotte's 'Full Mado - Le Remix Album' was produced by Montreal's producer/remixer ErekMcQueen (Aka Eric Lajoie), a longtime collaborator on many projects. The album was a 'humourous' mixture of songs from the 70's, 80's & 90's, remixed in different modern styles, with rewritten lyrics 'Lamotte-style'.

Jack and Jason Schneider, Have Not Been the Same: The Can-Rock Renaissance 1985-1995. ECW Press. . The show was once described by longtime host Brent Bambury as \\"explaining fringe culture to a comfortable mainstream audience,\\" and by his successor Patti Schmidt as \\"invented with an idea of what John Peel's show was, but without ever having heard it.\\" History The show was created after Augusta La Paix submitted a demo tape for a show on avant garde culture, featuring music by Laurie Anderson, Brian Eno, Klaus Nomi and Nina Hagen.\\"Navigating the rocky Brave New Waves\\". The Globe and Mail, May 26, 1984. In an early interview with The Globe and Mail, La Paix told the newspaper that she was only a recent convert to underground music, having previously been primarily a fan of country music. Produced throughout its run at the CBC's studios in Montreal and originally hosted by La Paix, the show aired for the first time on February 6, 1984. The first song it ever played was Simple Minds' \\"Promised You a Miracle\\". In its first year, the show was briefly the subject of a police investigation into obscenity charges, when a CBC employee who disliked the show filed an anonymous complaint about an interview with underground performance artist Karen Finley, although the investigation was dropped by the police without charges. The show's initial audience figures could not be directly measured, as the Bureau of Broadcast Measurement did not track radio ratings for the show's overnight time slot; however, indirect indications of success were available as both its lead-in and lead-out programs, A Little Night Music and Stereo Morning, posted significant and sustained audience gains after Brave New Waves debuted. In 1985, La Paix left the show to become host of CBC Stereo's Two New Hours, and was replaced by Bambury, previously a researcher for and occasional substitute host of the show. Music programming in these days, was the work of Kevin Komoda, who later went on to produce the first in studio sessions. Throughout the 1980s, Brave New Waves was an influential show, providing many Canadians without access to campus radio with their main exposure to alternative music, and was widely credited for significant increases in both record sales and concert attendance for both Canadian and international bands who were playlisted on the show. In addition, the show also increased the profile of underground and experimental writers and artists and filmmakers, including Laurie Anderson, Kathy Acker, bill bissett and Todd Solondz.Carl Wilson, \\"CBC to Indie Culture Fans: Chill Out & Love Up Big Brother\\". zoilus.com, March 8, 2005. In 1990, the program was scheduled to receive a short-term trial run on WXPN in Philadelphia, with an eye toward being picked up for U.S. syndication by National Public Radio;\\"U.S. fears CBC show too risque\\". Ottawa Citizen, August 20, 1990. however, due to the obscenity controversies that were prominent in American music at the time, NPR opted to cancel the contract because Brave New Waves did not censor songs with potentially objectionable lyrics. In the 1990s, when alternative rock became the decade's dominant commercial genre, the show kept its focus on the underground. In 1995, Bambury left the program to become cohost of CBC Television's Midday, and was replaced by Patti Schmidt, who also became the executive producer of the program. Since 1991, she had been writing and programming music for the show. Schmidt remained the program's main host for the remainder of its run; however, due to budgetary pressures at the CBC, Schmidt was forced to work with a smaller staff and budget than Bambury had enjoyed, with the result that the program became more squarely focused on playing music, with interviews reduced to one per week. The program became a reference and filter for all manner of new and contemporary music from indie rock, pop, metal and weird folk, to IDM, electronic dance music, edgy hip hop, avant garde jazz, noise, sound art, modern classical and all things uncategorizable. On May 27, 2006, the program aired an episode which was structured as a finale, with Schmidt conducting the show as a wrap party and then ending it by naming and thanking everybody who had ever worked on the show from its premiere in 1984. The final piece of music played was William Basinski's \\"Disintegration Loops\\". Although the show continued to air after that date, for the remainder of its run it was reduced to just one hour per night of new programming hosted by a rotating stable of guest hosts, with the remaining three hours filled by repeats of past BNW programs. On January 17, 2007, it was announced that Brave New Waves would be removed from the CBC Radio 2 line-up as part of a rebranding of the network.\\"CBC Radio to broaden Radio Two, add arts magazine\\".

Life and career George Lindsey was born in Fairfield, Alabama to George Ross Lindsey (a butcher) and wife, Alice Smith. He was raised by his grandparents in the small town of Jasper, where he graduated from Walker County High School in 1946. He attended Kemper Military School in Boonville, Missouri, and Florence State Teacher's College (Florence, Alabama) (now the University of North Alabama), where he majored in physical education and biology. He was a quarterback on the football team, and acted in college plays. He received a Bachelor of Science in 1952. After graduating from college he enlisted in the United States Air Force and was stationed at Ramey Air Force Base in Puerto Rico. After his discharge, he taught for a year at Hazel Green High School in Hazel Green, Alabama, while waiting to be accepted by the American Theater Wing in New York City in 1956. On March 24, 1960, he appeared on the To Tell the Truth television quiz show, posing as a Florida spear fisherman and ultimately revealing himself as a \\"nightclub comic.\\" After graduating from the Wing and performing in two Broadway plays, \\"Wonderful Town\\" and \\"All American\\", he moved to Los Angeles in 1962. He got parts in TV series of the day including Gunsmoke, The Rifleman, The Real McCoys, The Twilight Zone, Daniel Boone, Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea and three episodes of The Alfred Hitchcock Hour, before he got the role he would become famous for as \\"Goober\\" on The Andy Griffith Show. =The Andy Griffith Show, as \\"Goober Pyle\\" (1964)= In 1964, Lindsey was cast as the slow-witted but kindly \\"Goober Beasley\\" on The Andy Griffith Show. His character was later renamed \\"Goober Pyle\\" to tie him to his cousin Gomer Pyle, slow-witted country boy played by Jim Nabors, also from Alabama. Goober's antics frequently included his exaggerated \\"Goober Dance\\" and his comically bad Cary Grant impression. As Lindsey started his portrayal as Goober, he also had a minor role in the Walter Brennan series The Tycoon on ABC. Lindsey played a sailor in the 1964 film Ensign Pulver, the sequel to Mister Roberts. He also had a role in a Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea episode entitled \\"Submarine Sunk Here\\". He appeared in six episodes of the television series Gunsmoke. He played a blackmailing taxicab driver in the \\"Bed of Roses\\" episode of The Alfred Hitchcock Hour. Lindsey as Goober in The Andy Griffith Show =Star Trek, cast as \\"Spock\\"= During an interview segment of TV Land's 40th Anniversary Star Trek Marathon on November 12, 2006 Leonard Nimoy stated that Gene Roddenberry's first choice to play Spock was George Lindsey. Because of the flippant way Nimoy makes the comment it has been suggested that he was joking. The claim Lindsey was offered the role is given more credibility when Lindsey's close friend Ernest Borgnine wrote in his autobiography, \\"my hand to God ‚Äì he turned down the part of Mr. Spock on TV's Star Trek, the role that made Leonard Nimoy famous.\\" =Mayberry R.F.D., other acting work= After Griffith left his television show, CBS retooled it as Mayberry R.F.D. and Lindsey played the same character, until CBS cancelled the program in 1971. In his autobiography, Lindsey said though Mayberry R.F.D. gave his character more to do, he never felt the show's writing was up to the standards of The Andy Griffith Show. In 1972, Lindsey portrayed Charlie, one of a pair of highwaymen in the Gunsmoke episode \\"Blind Man's Bluff,\\" and an escaped convict, \\"The Dove,\\" in an episode of The Rifleman. Disney used his talents in a few projects, both as comedy support in features (Snowball Express) and voiceovers for a few of their animated characters. Three Disney animated features that presented the voice of Lindsey were The Aristocats (1970), Robin Hood (1973) and The Rescuers (1977). He appeared in the 1967 Gunsmoke episode \\"Mad Dog\\" as one of the Watson Brothers.

It‚Äôs football stadium is named after him, and his number \\"10\\" was retired by the school in January 1971. College career Dickey was recruited to Kansas State University. Following his senior season in 1970, Dickey finished tenth in the voting for the Heisman Trophy and was named MVP of the North‚ÄìSouth Shrine Game.

The work was modelled in 1906 in Paris, and erected at its present location at the Market Square in Kaartinkaupunki in 1908. Today it is recognized as one of the most important and beloved pieces of art in Helsinki. Sculpture Havis Amanda, with the Market Square and the South Harbour in the background, 2018 The Havis Amanda is one of Vallgren's Parisian Art Nouveau works. Cast in bronze, it rests on a fountain made of granite. The sculpture is of a mermaid standing on seaweed as she rises from the water, with four fish spouting water at her feet, surrounded by four sea lions. Vallgren's intention was to symbolize the rebirth of Helsinki. The height of the statue is and with the pedestal it stands tall. According to Vallgren's letters the model for the statue was a then 19-year-old Parisian woman, Marcelle Delquini. Vallgren himself simply called the work Merenneito (), but it quickly started to get additional nicknames. The Finland-Swedish newspapers dubbed it Havis Amanda and the Finnish Haaviston Manta or simply Manta. Havis Amanda is the common name used in brochures and travel guides. History It was unveiled on September 20, 1908. The work drew strong criticism at first, especially from women. Its nakedness and seductiveness were considered inappropriate. Not all groups objected to the nudity per se, but putting it on a pedestal was thought to subjugate women by sexually objectifying them and making them appear weak. Some women's rights groups criticised the look of the figure as plain or \\"a common French whore\\", lacking pristine and innocence. The sea lions, with their human tongues hanging out, were said to represent men lusting after the mademoiselle. Vallgren considered himself a worshipper of women. Many in the cultural elite of Finland considered Vallgren an outsider and had judged his work even before it was finished. A good friend of his, Albert Edelfelt, was instrumental through his influence in getting the work ordered. Every year on Vappu, Manta serves as a centrepiece for the celebrations. Students of the local universities place a student cap on the head of the statue in an elaborate ceremony. In 2002 Spencer Tunick organized a photoshoot of voluntary nude Finns, of whom almost 2000 showed up, posing around the statue as part of his Nude Adrift, Finland 3 project. In 2014 artist Tatzu Nishi constructed a temporary hotel setting around the statue called Hotel Manta where visitors could see the statue in a new, unusual setting. There are fears of the old and hollow statue possibly breaking from people climbing on it. In 2019 there were calls from officials to limit celebrations and climbing on the statue. During 2020's Vappu, out of concern for the COVID-19 pandemic, the city and the police decided to fence off the statue for the time being and directed towards a digital version of capping the statue.

It came to tragic fame when it hit a reef at the northern edge of Great Barrier Island, about 100 km out from Auckland, and sank. The death toll of around 130 people remains one of the largest such losses in the country's history.Historic SS Wairarapa Graves (from the DOC. Accessed 2008-06-04.) The ship was named for the Wairarapa region.  Wrecking  Wairarapa was built in Dumbarton, Scotland, in 1882, for the Union Steam Ship Company. Soon after launch she sailed to New Zealand, to become one of a small number of luxury steamers plying the route across the Tasman Sea to Australia. Miners Head Great Barrier Island / Aotea Site of the sinking of the SS Wairarapa Wairarapa sailed from Sydney, Australia, on Wednesday, 24 October 1894. The ship‚Äôs destination was the rapidly growing New Zealand port city of Auckland, 2,000 miles away. As Wairarapa rounded the top of the North Island of New Zealand four days later, fog and storms set in. However, Captain John S. McIntosh refused to slow the ship from 13 knots, nearly full speed despite the thick fog. Fatally, the ship went off-course, possibly due to a faulty compass bearing. At the subsequent Court of Enquiry into the incident, some even suggested the ship had been steered by dead reckoning rather than using a compass at all. Whatever the cause, the ship skirted to the west of the Poor Knights Islands, not the east. As a consequence she was much closer to the mainland than the ship‚Äôs crew believed. At around 8 minutes past midnight on Monday, 29 October 1894, the ship was wrecked on the steep cliffs near Miners Head on the northern tip of Great Barrier Island, off the coast of Auckland.\\"Eight Minutes Past Midnight\\", Steve Locker-Lampson & Ian Francis, Rowfant Books, Wellington New Zealand, 1981 The hours after the wreck saw great loss of life. Many passengers could not swim and drowned in the rough seas trying to make it to shore. One life raft was seen floating out to sea and was never sighted again. Many men, including a large portion of the crew, took to one of the lifeboats, leaving women and children behind. A number of people took refuge in the ship‚Äôs rigging. At about 3 am Captain McIntosh jumped into the sea and was presumed drowned. Several other lifeboats which had been safely launched stayed near the stricken ship and picked survivors from the sea where possible. One lifeboat eventually succeeded in reaching a local community of Ngati Wai MƒÅori based at Katherine Bay, on the western coast of the island. They were able to rescue and provide care for a number of the survivors. Seaman, fisherman and farmer Mariano Vella and his new wife belonged to the survivors of the disaster. Although Wairarapa was expected in Auckland, there was no way of knowing where she may have come to grief. As the only contact with the island at the time was via weekly trips from a steamer, it was three full days until news of the shipwreck reached Auckland. The Northern Company's steamer Argyle arrived in Port FitzRoy on Wednesday, 31 October, and took the survivors who had reached Port FitzRoy on board. The steamer then proceeded to the site of the shipwreck, and to Katherine Bay, picking up further survivors and sailing back to arrive in Auckland about 3am Thursday 1 November. A Court of Inquiry was held after Wairarapa disaster, and found Captain McIntosh's actions were the primary cause of the tragedy. Protection The wreck of Wairarapa is scheduled for preservation in the Auckland Unitary Plan and is also protected under the archaeological provisions of the Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga Act 2014.

He had previously served in several church positions under Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, as well as captain of Smith's personal bodyguard and \\"Master Builder and Workman on all God's Holy Houses.\\" Following the death of Joseph Smith in June 1844, Cutler at first followed the Twelve Apostles under Brigham Young, but later left Young's church to reorganize the Church of Jesus Christ, with himself serving as its first president. Cutler claimed that this was the sole legitimate continuation of Smith's organization, and he served as its leader until his death. Early years Lois Lathrop Cutler, wife Cutler was born in Plainfield, New Hampshire, to Knight Cutler, a veteran of the American Revolution,Fletcher, Rupert J. and Daisy Whiting, Alpheus Cutler and The Church of Jesus Christ. Church of Jesus Christ, 1974, p. 9 and Elizabeth Boyd. He married Lois Lathrop of Lebanon, New Hampshire, on November 17, 1808.Biography of Alpheus Cutler, The Joseph Smith Papers (accessed December 28, 2011) Lathrop was a descendant of Rev. John Lothropp (1584-1653), and thus a distant cousin of Latter Day Saint prophet Joseph Smith. Cutler fought as a private in the War of 1812, serving in Cpt. E.

Erroneously named as \\"Alpheus Cutler's Civil War Record;\\" Cutler served in the War of 1812, not the U.S. Civil War. Although later Latter Day Saint sources would refer to Cutler as \\"Captain Alpheus Cutler\\" and say that he had fought at the battles of Chippewa Falls and Lundy's Lane,Fletcher, Rupert J. and Daisy Whiting, Alpheus Cutler and The Church of Jesus Christ. Church of Jesus Christ, 1974, p. 10. his service record does not support either assertion.Alpheus Cutler Military Records. Cutler was a stonemason by occupation. He stood over six feet tall, and was described by one biographer as being \\"heavy set,\\" \\"powerfully built,\\" \\"critical\\" and \\"sarcastic,\\" while generally expressing himself in \\"an extremely candid, sharp and brusque manner.\\"\\"Jorgensen, Danny, Ph.D.: The Old Fox: Alpheus Cutler. Quoted in Lannius, Roger D. Differing Visions: Dissenters in Mormon History, Univ. of Illinois press, p. 159. Some of Cutler's contemporaries would later refer to him as having a \\"natural parabolical, allegorical, symbolical, mysterious, secretive way of telling things.\\"Jorgensen, Danny, Ph.D.: The Old Fox: Alpheus Cutler. Quoted in Lannius, Roger D. Differing Visions: Dissenters in Mormon History, Univ. of Illinois press, p. 166. Conversion to the Latter Day Saint movement Following the War of 1812, Cutler and his family were living in western New York, where they heard David W. Patten of the Church of Christ preach about the coming forth of the Book of Mormon and the ministry of Joseph Smith. Following what they claimed to be a miraculous cure of their daughter by Patten's prayers and laying on of hands, Cutler and his family were baptized by Patten on 20 January 1833.Fletcher, Rupert J. and Daisy Whiting, Alpheus Cutler and The Church of Jesus Christ. Church of Jesus Christ, 1974, pp. 12‚Äì13. He moved to the main Mormon settlement at Kirtland, Ohio, the following year.Alpheus Cutler . An enthusiastic convert, Cutler was invited to attend Smith's School of the Prophets in Kirtland, and assisted in the construction of the Kirtland Temple there.Fletcher, pp. 15‚Äì16. Although brought before the Kirtland High Council on 15 March 1835 on charges of arguing with fellow member Reynolds Cahoon and complaining about not being paid enough for his work on the temple, Cutler weathered the storm and remained in Smith's good graces. During the building's dedication on 27 March 1836, Cutler claimed to have seen a vision of Jesus Christ descending down a long carpet into the temple; he claimed that Christ spoke to him, but did not record what he said.Fletcher, Rupert J. and Daisy Whiting, Alpheus Cutler and The Church of Jesus Christ. Church of Jesus Christ, 1974, pp. 17‚Äì18. He also claimed in this vision to have seen a large gold chain draped across the newly completed edifice.\\"Jorgensen, Danny, Ph.D.: The Old Fox: Alpheus Cutler. Quoted in Lannius, Roger D.

When Joseph Smith moved church headquarters to Caldwell County, Missouri, in 1837, Cutler followed him there and settled in adjacent Ray County. A victim of Governor Lilburn Boggs's \\"Extermination Order,\\" Cutler was expelled from the state with the other Latter Day Saints during the winter of 1838‚Äì39. Together with members of the Quorum of Twelve Apostles and other leading Latter Day Saints, Cutler risked death and slipped back into Far West, where as the newly named \\"chief architect and master workman of all God's holy houses\\",Fletcher, pg. 25. See also Jorgensen, Danny L., Conflict in the Camps of Israel: The 1853 Cutlerite Schism , Journal of Mormon History, vol. 21, issue 1, pp. 25‚Äì64. Cutler laid the cornerstone for the (never-built) Far West Temple.Fletcher, Rupert J. and Daisy Whiting, Alpheus Cutler and The Church of Jesus Christ. Church of Jesus Christ, 1974, p. 25. Relocating with his religious brethren to Nauvoo, Illinois, Cutler was appointed one of three members of a committee to oversee construction of the Nauvoo Temple on 3 October 1840. Directed to supervise the cutting of timber for the new edifice, Cutler led a group of workmen into the Pineries along the Black River in Wisconsin, where they spent the next year cutting logs and floating them down the Mississippi River to Nauvoo. While in Nauvoo, Cutler served on the Nauvoo High Council,Doctrine and Covenants 124:132. All references are to the LDS Church edition of this work. and the Anointed Quorum; he was also named to Joseph Smith's Council of Fifty. Cutler received his endowment under Smith's hand on 12 October 1843,Saints Without Halos: Alpheus Cutler. Retrieved on 2009-08-11. and subsequently became only the sixth person to be given the rare Second Anointing on 15 November--a full week before Brigham Young received hisJoseph Smith, Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, ed. Joseph Fielding Smith (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book Company, 1977), p. 322. Quoted in Recreating Religion, ch. 3, p. 38.--which made him a \\"King and Priest\\" in Smith's still-secret Kingdom of God (see Council of Fifty). Cutler also served as captain of Smith's bodyguard.Jorgensen, Danny, Ph.D.:Building the Kingdom of God: Alpheus Cutler and the Second Mormon Mission to the Indians Prior to Smith's murder in 1844, Cutler was called by Smith to undertake a mission to the \\"Lamanites\\" (as Native Americans were often called by the Saints during this time in history). However, he had not yet departed when Smith was killed on 27 June at the jail in Carthage, Illinois.Fletcher, Rupert J. and Daisy Whiting, Alpheus Cutler and The Church of Jesus Christ. Church of Jesus Christ, 1974, p. 43. Events of 1844‚Äì51 =Cutler remains in Nauvoo= Smith's death produced a profound succession crisis in his movement, with members torn between competing claimants for Smith's prophetic mantle. These included the Quorum of the Twelve, led by Brigham Young; James Strang, a newly baptized convert from Wisconsin; and Sidney Rigdon, who had served as Joseph Smith's First Counselor in the First Presidency. At first, Cutler threw in his lot with the Twelve. He continued to work on the Nauvoo Temple,Fletcher, pp. 36-41. where he was reportedly \\"sealed\\" to Lois on 14 February 1846.Johnson, G. Vaughn, Alpheus Cutler, p. 2. Cutler's followers deny that this event ever took place. LDS Church records indicate that Cutler was married to six other women during this timeframe, but the Cutlerite church adamantly denies this or any assertion that Cutler‚Äîor Joseph Smith, for that matter‚Äîapproved of or practiced plural marriage.Fletcher, pp. 44-45, 247‚Äì58. Cutlerites tend to assert that these records were forged by individuals bent upon discrediting Cutler, after he founded his own organization. Cutlerites also deny the efficacy of eternal marriages as well, including those contracted in the Nauvoo temple. The names of Cutler's alleged wives, together with the LDS Church sources listing them, may be found at Saints Without Halos: Alpheus Cutler. Although the Nauvoo Temple would be dedicated on 1 May 1846 by apostle Orson Hyde, Cutler would later insist that it had not been finished by the \\"sufficient time\\" given in the revelation authorizing its construction;Fletcher, pp. 36-37. The revelation referred to is Doctrine and Covenants 124:31-32 (see below). Although the temple was dedicated, all sources agree that its second storey was never fully finished. See article on Nauvoo Temple. this proved pivotal for his own claims to legitimacy when he decided to commence his own church organization in 1853. At this point, however, Cutler's loyalties were clearly with Brigham Young; he participated as a member of the High Council in the excommunication trials of Rigdon and Strang, as well as Joseph Smith's own brother, William, who had publicly endorsed Strang. During a discussion over the competing succession claims in the High Council, Cutler indicated that he \\"felt bound to sustain the Twelve, and all the Quorums of the Church with its present organization, for on that his salvation depended.\\"Fred Collier, The Nauvoo High Council Minute Books, 156‚Äì57. Quoted in Recreating Religion, Ch. 3, p. 39. =Winter Quarters= Cutler's Park, founded by Alpheus Cutler, in the late 1840s. Winter Quarters, Nebraska, founded by Alpheus Cutler When Brigham Young decided to commence the Saints' trek to the Salt Lake Valley, he appointed Cutler as Captain of \\"Emigrating Company No. 3,\\" one of twenty-five such travelling units into which the Mormon pioneers were organized.Fletcher, pp. 40-41. Cutler established Cutler's Park, Nebraska, in 1846, and was appointed presiding member of the municipal High Council on 9 August of that year.Saints Without Halos. Barely a month later, he was asked to find a new location for a settlement; on 11 September he selected the site that would become Winter Quarters, Nebraska.Saints Without Halos; see also Johnson, G. Vaughn, Alpheus Cutler, p. 2. =Trouble begins= Sometime prior to 1849, Cutler made a decision to withdraw from the main church body under the Twelve, and to go his own way. In the fall of 1847, Brigham Young had sanctioned his request to conduct the mission work among the Indians to which Joseph Smith had assigned him, and Cutler had commenced his efforts with nearby tribes.Jorgensen, pg. 35. In addition to preaching, Cutler and his associates built a mill and farmed land among the Indians. Jorgensen, p. 38; Fletcher, p. 43. All seemed well at first. However, the arrival of apostle Orson Hyde at nearby Kanesville, Iowa, in early 1848 changed the situation. Cutler soon became the subject of lurid rumors concerning his Indian mission, with spurious reports indicating that he had been elected as the \\"Generalissimo\\" of a union of \\"thirty-seven nations\\". Further allegations of alleged disloyalty to the Twelve by Cutler among the \\"Lamanites\\" fueled the fire; a visit by Ezra T. Benson, George A. Smith and others to Cutler's mission only partially calmed the situation.Jorgensen, p. 38‚Äì41. Although Brigham Young wrote to Cutler, offering him aid to move west, a house in Salt Lake City and a warm welcome once he arrived,Jorgensen, p. 51. Brigham signed the letter: \\"your sincere friend and brother in time & all eternity\\". the \\"Old Fox\\" (as Cutler was affectionately called) refused to go.Cutler did author a reply in which he promised to move to Utah after completing his work among the Indians, but he never followed through on it. Jorgensen, p. 53. According to Cutler biographer Danny Jorgensen, Cutler had been appointed to a committee of the Council of Fifty specializing in \\"Lamanite\\" affairs, and he might have seen his mission as ultimately being Council of Fifty business, rather than as church business; thus, his resistance to Hyde and the others' attempts to regulate his activities among the Kansas tribes.Jorgensen, Danny, Ph.D.:Building the Kingdom of God: Alpheus Cutler and the Second Mormon Mission to the Indians, pp. 198, 201‚Äì02. However, since the role and place of the Fifty within Joseph Smith's overall scheme of things was not well known to many Latter Day Saints (due in part to its secret nature, and in part to Smith's untimely demise), many Latter Day Saints misunderstood Cutler's intentions and pronouncements on this subject, and this contributed to the eventual severing of his ties with Brigham Young's church.Jorgensen, Danny, Ph.D.:Building the Kingdom of God: Alpheus Cutler and the Second Mormon Mission to the Indians, pp. 201‚Äì02. =Excommunication= Hyde ultimately became convinced that Cutler considered himself to be a greater authority than the council over which he (Hyde) presided, and ordered his mission suspended.Jorgensen, p. 49. Brigham Young defended Cutler before the October LDS general conference, saying that Cutler was the victim of false rumors about his loyalty to the church. Jorgensen, p. 54. Insisting that Cutler had become an enemy to Young's organization, the Kanesville High Council excommunicated him on 20 April 1851.Jorgensen, p. 55. Young labored to bring Cutler back into the fold, writing of an ardent desire to see his old friend and promising him protection against any enemies he might have in the church. Even as late as 1856, long after Cutler had founded his own organization, Young indicated to LDS Church general authorities that he would forgive everything if Cutler would only come to Utah Territory.Jorgensen, pp. 55‚Äì56. Founding a new church =The \\"Cutlerite\\" reorganization= But Cutler had no intention of going to Utah. Having broken with Young's organization, he set about creating his own. Having been forced to abandon his mission in 1851 under pressure from local Indian Agents and government authorities,Joregensen, p. 56. he and his followers relocated to Manti, Iowa, in the southwestern part of that state. On September 19, 1853, Cutler organized The Church of Jesus Christ, claiming that he had seen a prophesied celestial sign (two crescent-moons with their backs together) which Joseph Smith had allegedly told him to wait for before commencing this \\"reorganization\\" of the church.Fletcher, p. 47. This should not be confused with the \\"reorganization\\" effected by the founders of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. That was a separate event entirely, not involving Cutler or his followers in any way. Cutler claimed that Smith's church had been \\"rejected\\" by God, and that only he possessed the power to reorganize it.Fletcher, pp. 47‚Äì55, 271‚Äì74. Thus, claimed Cutler, his new organization was the sole legitimate continuance of Joseph Smith's work. According to Cutler, the misdeed that brought about the rejection of Joseph Smith's church was its failure to complete the Nauvoo Temple within the \\"sufficient time\\" mentioned in Doctrine and Covenants 124:31‚Äì32; that organization had accordingly ceased to exist as a legitimate entity.Fletcher, pp. 36‚Äì37, 154‚Äì55; Jorgensen, p. 57; \\"Letter of Alpheus Cutler to Zenos H. Gurley\\", 29 January 1856; reprinted in Fletcher, pp. 264‚Äì70. This did not mean that Smith's restored priesthood had been withdrawn from the earth, said Cutler, for he viewed the church and the priesthood as two separate things.Cutler to Gurley; Fletcher, pp. 51, 267‚Äì69. While the former had been rejected, said he, the latter had not, and now remained solely with him as the seventh and final member of a furtive \\"Quorum of Seven\\" appointed by Smith to carry on his authority independently of the rejected church.Jorgensen, p. 57; Fletcher, pp. 46‚Äì55. All previous members of this quorum had died or apostatized, said Cutler;Fletcher, p. 54. hence, he and he alone possessed power to \\"reorganize\\" Smith's church. Historian D. Michael Quinn surmises that this Quorum might have been the same as the so-called \\"Committee of the Council\\" or \\"Committee of Seven\\" spoken of in documents relating to the Council of Fifty, but questions whether it was ever anything more than a political body within the Council, as opposed to a group with \\"extraordinary religious or theocratic powers.\\"Quinn, D. Michael, The Council of Fifty and Its Members, pp. 15‚Äì16. =Manti= While in Manti, the Cutlerite church attained its highest membership figure: 183 persons.Fletcher, p. 56. The church endeavored to establish a United Order, but soon gave up the attempt. Cutler became convinced that he was destined to lead a Mormon return to Independence, Missouri, and build there the great temple that the Mormons had tried (and failed, due to intense local opposition) to construct in 1832‚Äì33; in an 1861 sermon, Cutler prophesied that he would \\"be standing in Zion, if he were 80 years old.\\"Box 1, folder 3, 87‚Äì88, Cutlerite Church Records. Quoted in Recreating Religion, ch. 3, p. 48. According to Joseph Smith III, eldest son of Joseph Smith and leader of a rival faction known as the New Organization,This \\"New Organization\\" had organized in 1853, though Joseph Smith III waited until 1860 to accept leadership of it. The early Reorganization claimed a \\"rejection\\" of Joseph Smith's church‚Äîhence the name \\"Reorganized\\"‚Äîbut differed as to who had authority to reconstitute it, as well as disagreeing with several other Cutlerite beliefs. Cutler's followers were so convinced that they would be moving to Independence soon that they refused to make substantial improvements to their homes and lands, and remained in a constant state of readiness to leave at a moment's notice for \\"Zion.\\"Joseph Smith III, Memoirs of Joseph Smith III, ed. Mary Audentia Smith Anderson and Richard P. Howard (Independence, Mo.: Herald Publishing House, 1979) pp. 98‚Äì99. Quoted in Recreating Religion, ch. 3, p. 48. Manti was visited during this period by missionaries from Joseph Smith III's church, now known as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church). These visits began in 1855 with a letter from Zenos Gurley inviting Cutler to join their movement. Cutler rebuffed Gurley's overtures with a tersely-worded letter of his own, in which he openly ridiculed the RLDS Church's claims and insisted that his organization alone was possessed of the true priesthood authority.These two letters may be read in their entirety in Fletcher, pp. 264‚Äì70. Nevertheless, many Cutlerites chose to accept \\"young Joseph;\\" among them was Cutler's son (and designated successor), Thaddeus.Fletcher, p. 63. Joseph Smith III visited Cutler in person in 1863; he reported that the once- robust prophet had become partially paralyzed (due to a recent stroke) and weighed nearly 300 pounds; he struggled to speak, Joseph reported, but was no longer able to communicate effectively.Biloine Whiting Young, Obscure Believers: The Mormon Schism of Alpheus Cutler (Minneapolis: Pogo Press, 2002) p. 61. Cutlerite church headquarters in Independence, Missouri Death and aftermath Cutler died from complications of pulmonary tuberculosis on 10 June 1864, and is buried in Manti, Iowa. On 10 August 1864, those members of his church who had remained loyal to Cutler (including his wife, Lois) relocated to Clitherall, near Battle Lake, Minnesota, in response to an alleged vision. RLDS Church evangelists followed the Cutlerites to their new home and culled many more from their ranks, ultimately leaving Cutler's church with a mere three elders and a few members.Fletcher, p. 74. The remaining Cutlerites refused to give up, however, constructing a new church building in Clitherall and successfully establishing a church corporation in 1912 to effect the ideals of Joseph Smith's United Order; this corporation continues to function today. During the 1920s, church members began to fulfill Cutler's long-cherished dream when they relocated their headquarters to Independence, Missouri; there they built a meetinghouse that remains today as the only functioning Cutlerite church building. As Cutler had taught in Manti, his followers continue to perform endowments and baptisms for the dead today, virtually alone among all non‚ÄìLDS Church-derived Latter Day Saint churches.Unlike the Utah LDS Church, Cutlerites do not practice eternal marriage, believing that to be an innovation made after Joseph Smith's death. Two schisms emerged from the original Cutlerite organization: the first was started by Clyde Fletcher in 1953 and vanished with his death in 1969. The second was begun by former member Eugene Walton in 1980, after the mainline Cutlerite organization rejected his claims to be the \\"One Mighty and Strong.\\" Cutler's church continues to function today, albeit with diminutive membership numbers (12 members in 2010, all in Independence). Its current president is (as of 2013) Vernon Whiting. Wife, alleged plural wives and children Cutler's legal wife (and the only wife Cutlerites will acknowledge him having) was Lois Lathrop, who was born September 24, 1788, in Lebanon, New Hampshire, and remained married to Cutler until his death. She and Cutler had the following children: *Thaddeus (b. June 18, 1809, in Lisle, Broome Co., N.Y.) *Libeus (b. 1814 in Ontario, Broome) *Louisa Elizabeth (b. May 16, 1816, in Lisle, Broome) *Sally Mavea (b. Sept. 9, 1818 in Lisle, Broome) *William (b. Feb. 6, 1821 in Ontario, Wayne Co., N.Y.) *Benjamin Franklin (b.

(b. 1829 in New York) *Betsy A. (b. 1832 in Pomfret, Chatauqua, N.Y.) Cutler's daughter Louisa Elizabeth Cutler (1816-1854) married Tunis Rappleye (1807-1883), who led the second group of Mormon pioneers (after Brigham Young's group) into the Salt Lake Valley in 1847. Their marriage produced 10 children and hundreds of descendants. Two other daughters, Clarissa (1824) and Emily (1828), married LDS Church apostle Heber Chase Kimball (1801) as polygamous wives. Both later divorced him. In addition to his legal wife, Lois, LDS Church records indicate Cutler as having married the following women in 1846: *Luana Hart Beebe Rockwell (b. Oct. 3, 1814 in Lebanon, Madison, NY; d. Mar. 6, 1897 in West Tintic, Juab Co., UT) *Margaret Carr (b. 1771 in North Carolina); *Abigail Carr (b. 1780 in North Carolina); *Sally Cox Smith Hutchings (b. Feb. 26, 1794 in Bernard, Somerset, NJ; d. Sept. 28, 1863 in Salt Lake City); *Disey Caroline McCall (b. 1802 in North Carolina); *Henrietta Clarinda Miller (b. 1822 in New York). The contemporary Cutlerite church adamantly denies that any of these alleged marriages occurred, or that Cutler ever sanctioned or practiced plural marriage. According to non-Cutlerite biographer Danny L. Jorgensen, Cutler allegedly abandoned his plural wives (and plural marriage altogether) sometime during the 1850s after one of his disciples, F. Walter Cox, was threatened with imprisonment in Iowa. This same biographer also cites Heber C. Kimball's abandonment of Cutler's two daughters as another reason for Cutler's disaffection with polygamy.

A cavalry force commanded by Brigadier General John Coffee was able to defeat the Creek warriors. Background After the massacre at Fort Mims, General Andrew Jackson assembled an army of 2,500 Tennessee militia. Jackson began marching into Mississippi Territory to combat the Red Stick Creeks. Jackson's troops began to construct Fort Strother along the Coosa River. 15 miles (24 km) away from the fort lay the Creek village of Tallasseehatchee, where a sizeable force of Red Stick warriors were. Jackson ordered his friend and most trusted subordinate, General John Coffee, to attack the village. Battle Coffee took about 900 dragoons and arrived on November 3 at the village, where he divided his brigade into two columns that encircled the town. Two companies ventured into the center of the circle to draw out the warriors. The trap worked: The warriors attacked and were forced to retreat back into the buildings of the village. Coffee closed the circle in on the trapped warriors. Davy Crockett, serving in the Tennessee Militia, commented, \\"We shot 'em down like dogs.\\" In his memoirs he also described participating in burning down a house where 46 Creek warriors and their families had taken refuge.http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-2350 Coffee's forces killed 186 warriors, as well as many women and children, while suffering only 5 dead and 41 wounded. Writing about the event years later, Richard K. Call recalled: \\"The next morning after our march we entered the Indian village, and here I first saw the carnage of the battle field. I saw it in its worst aspect ‚Äì when the hour of danger had passed, when I could excite no feeling or passion in my breast, to control my sympathy and sorrow for human suffering. It was to me a horrible and revolting scene ‚Äì the battle had ended in the village, the warriors fighting in their board houses, which gave little protection against the rifle bullets or musket ball. They fought in the midst of their wives and children, who frequently shared their bloody fate. They fought bravely to the last, none asking or receiving quarter, nor did resistance cease until the last warrior had fallen. Humanity might well have wept over the gory scene before us. We found as many as eight or ten dead bodies in a single cabin, sometimes the dead mother clasped the dead child to her breast, and to add another appalling horror to the bloody catalogue ‚Äì some of the cabins had taken fire, and half consumed human bodies were seen amidst the smoking ruins. In other instances dogs had torn and feasted on the mangled bodies of their masters. Heartsick I turned from the revolting scene. Very different seems the picture in the cool moment of inaction than in the excitement of battle ‚Äì in the one ‚Äì passion, the desire to triumph, and vengeance make demons, in the other as the brain becomes more composed, the pulse to beat less quickly, the heart resumes its sway ‚Äì and it would be a relief to shed tears over the carnage around us ‚Äì I remember an instant of a brave young soldier, who after fighting like a tiger until the engagement was over, fainted at the sight of the blood he had helped to spill.\\"Richard Keith Call Journal, p. 19-20 (https://www.floridamemory.com/fpc/memory/collections/rkcall/rkcall_journal_transcript.pdf) This battle was the first battle in General Andrew Jackson's military campaign.

History The village of Padanaram was one of many settlements that began cropping up within the town of Old Dartmouth after its purchase from the Wampanoag by members of the Plymouth Colony in 1652. During King Philip's War the settlement was burned down and all cattle killed. The only settlers who survived were those who heard a warning and fled either to Russell's Garrison or Cooke's Garrison. Remains of the settlement can still be seen at the foot of Lucy Street. In the mid-18th century it became a shipbuilding center. In September 1778, during the American Revolution, the British attacked nearby New Bedford with a small force attacking Padanaram. The town prospered as a minor whaling port and was home to a large salt works during the 19th century. As these industries died out, \\"the village\\" (as it is referred to by locals) became mostly a residential area with several yachting businesses, galleries, eateries, and shops. Name Origin The name ‚ÄúPadanaram‚Äù came from a prominent early resident named Laban Thatcher, who identified with the Biblical figure Laban who resided in Paddan Aram in Mesopotamia.Book of Genesis 48:7 The village eventually adopted this new name, and dropped its earlier Wampanoag name, ‚ÄúPonagansett.‚Äù\\"Padanaram Village.\\" New Bedford Travel Guide.

In computing, incremental search, incremental find or real-time suggestions is a user interface interaction method to progressively search for and filter through text. As the user types text, one or more possible matches for the text are found and immediately presented to the user. This immediate feedback often allows the user to stop short of typing the entire word or phrase they were looking for. The user may also choose a closely related option from the presented list. The method of incremental search is sometimes distinguished from user interfaces that employ a modal window, such as a dialog box, to enter searches. For some applications, a separate user interface mode may be used instead of a dialog box. History The first documented use of incremental search was in EMACS on ITS in the late 1970s. This was one of the many essential Emacs features Richard Stallman included in his reimplementation, GNU Emacs. Other noteworthy programs containing this functionality in the 1980s include bash and Canon Cat. These early implementations offered single line feedback, not lists of suggestions. The first mainstream appearance may have been in the Speller for WordPerfect 5.2 for Windows, released 30 November 1992. As programmer Robert John Stevens, now CEO of WriteExpress, watched users at the WordPerfect Usability Lab in Orem, Utah use the 5.1 Speller that he and Steven M. Cannon ported to Windows, he noticed that when a word was not found in the dictionary and no alternative words were presented, users seemed lost, moved the mouse cursor around the page and even exited the Speller. Dumbstruck by the anomaly, he went home, sat on the couch and discussed his observations with his wife. Stevens coded the solution: as a user typed in the edit box, Speller would suggest words beginning with the letters entered. Stevens' Spell Check program was also used in Novell GroupWise.  Variants  This feature, or variations thereof, has also been referred to as Autocomplete, search as you type, filter/find as you type (FAYT), incremental search, typeahead search, inline search, instant search, word wheeling, and other names as well. Some common keyboard shortcuts for incremental find are Ctrl/Cmd-F (like for traditional find), the GNU-style \`/\` (also applicable to Vim ), or Emacs-style \`C-s\`. = Searches for files and media = This user interface method is also employed in varying contexts. For example, a user may encounter this feature while searching for files whose names match a string in an operating system's file explorer shell. The feature may also be used during searches for songs whose name or artist match a string in a media player. = Searches for user interface elements = Another variation is to filter through long lists of options or menu items that may appear within the user interface itself. Examples of this variation can be found in the about:config interface section of Mozilla Firefox version 2.0.0.14 and later versions; and in the bundle editor section of TextMate 1.5.7. This feature is also employed in application launchers such as Quicksilver 1.0. Typically a list of matches is generated as the search query is typed, and the list is progressively narrowed to match the filter text. = Web search = In September 2010, Google introduced Google Instant, an incremental search feature for Google Search. =Resource consumption= Incremental search on a non-local server, as in Web search, uses more network bandwidth and server processing than non-incremental search, due to the handling of XMLHttpRequests (or similar) which are typically fired from each onkeyup event. Reception Interface expert Jef Raskin has been a strong advocate of incremental search. In his 2000 book The Humane Interface, he wrote, \\"From the point of view of interface engineering, the advantages of incremental searching are so numerous and the advantages of delimited searches so few that I can see almost no occasions when a delimited search would be preferred.\\" This was followed by a footnote reading, \\"A search is either incremental or excremental.\\" Incremental search has been criticised for exhibiting low affordance, as the text fields which provide it offer no visual indication of that fact until after the user begins typing.

Daystar's original campus is close to Nairobi city centre, but there was no room to expand at that location. Therefore, in the last decade a new campus has been built at Athi River, some 40 km to the south-east of the city, on the Mombasa Road which became the main campus. This development has been largely as a result of work of the vice chancellor of Daystar, Professor S. Talitwala. History In 1967, Dr. Donald K. Smith, an American missionary, and Motsoko Pheko, an African journalist, founded Daystar Communications. Daystar sought to improve techniques used in communicating the message of Christ, to analyze the target audience of these messages, and to design more effective communication strategies for reaching such audiences. Daystar began short-term training programs in 1971 to assist church leaders in developing cross-cultural communication strategies. Dr. Smith left Daystar in 1980 and since then Daystar University has been run by African leadership. It now has an enrollment over more than 5,000 students in 32 undergraduate majors, 16 masters programs, and 2 PhD. programs. The university continues to produce graduates who are serving in various capacities in Africa. (www.Daystar.ac.ke) (www.DaystarUS.org)  Academics  It has six schools and fifteen academic departments which include School of Communication * Language and Performing Arts * Media and Film Studies * Strategic and Organizational Communication School of Arts and Humanities * Education * Theology and Biblical Studies * Peace and International Studies School of Science, Engineering and Health * Nursing * Computer Science * Pre-University School of Human and Social Sciences * Development Studies * Psychology and Counseling * Institute of Child Development School of Business and Economics * Commerce * Economics * Institute of Leadership and Professional Development School of Law * Media & Communication Law =Department of language and performing arts= The Department of Language and Performing Arts, sometimes referred to as LPA Department houses degree programs and classes in music and in the literature and languages of Swahili, French and English. It is a member department of Daystar University's School of Communication, Language and Performing Arts. Launch of the Daystar University's BAKE chapter The department was hived off the former department of Humanities in August 2010. Members of the full-time faculty are Ann Wachira, Bill Rowe, Brenda Wambua, Caroline Rugendo, Kithinji Kindiki, Larry Ndivo, Mike Kuria, Purity Kiambi, Rebecca Oladipo and Regina Gachari. Its head of department is Wandia Njoya. At its creation in 2010, the department was challenged by low student interest and misleading information about the potential of the creative arts. The challenges included attacks on the arts as irrelevant to the Kenyan context and students receiving advice not to take programs offered by the department. These attacks were in line with the larger Kenyan education philosophy that sees the purpose of school as solely to prepare people for employment. The department thus embarked on an aggressive campaign to increase its visibility in the university and to persuade students to enroll in its classes as electives, minors and majors. The department's strategy included * inviting writers, musicians, music producers and artists to speak to students about the doors opened by studying literature, language and music. The guests hosted include Kinyanjui Kombani, Dominic Khaemba, Suzanna Owiyo, Boniface Mwangi, the Smithsonian Jazz Masterworks Orchestra and Onduko Bwa'Atebe * teaching courses related to topical issues such as Hip Hop and African Political Thought and inviting members of the public to attend the classes * Inviting speakers to talk on topical issues such as elections and citizenship (Boniface Mwangi), the structure of Marginalization in Kenya (Adam Hussein), the Soul of Sex (Curtis Reed), and the Mau Mau Compensations (Muoki Mbunga) * holding a Creatives Academy workshop that connects students to writers, publishers and media personalities who share their experiences and insights on how one can make a living from writing, negotiate with publishers, and brand themselves and their work * increasing visibility and interaction through social media. The LPA department ranks as the most active Kenyan academic department on social media and the internet * inviting visiting scholars to teach in the Department, such as Jack Ballard from Malone University and Helen Walker from Messiah College * promoting online writing through the course \\"Creative non-fiction\\" taught in January 2014 by Prof. Helen Walker from Messiah College and launching the first university chapter of the Bloggers' Association of Kenya. Dr. Larry Ndivo also runs a blog called \\"Engage: Discourses on Kenyan Literature\\" which reviews recent Kenyan writings * establishing the Daystar University Book Club, moderated by Prof Mike Kuria, which discusses books and invites writers. It meets in a restaurant of the members' choice. Writers who have attended the Book Club so far include Ng'ang'a Mbugua, author and two-time winner of the Wahome Mutahi prize, Eva Kasaya, winner of the Jomo Kenyatta Foundation Prize, and Yvonne Adhiambo Owuor, winner of the Caine Prize. Achievements Daystar's LPA department is the most active Kenyan department on Twitter and Facebook, putting it a step ahead of most Kenyan universities in the integration of social media with education. It has held 38 graduations so far. Other than there being one graduation in a year, it added another graduation month which is December effective immediate in 2016.

The film follows two divorce mediators (Wilson and Vaughn) who crash weddings in an attempt to meet and seduce women. The film opened on July 15, 2005 through New Line Cinema to critical and commercial success, grossing $288.5 million worldwide on a $40 million budget, and is credited with helping to revive the popularity of adult-oriented, R-rated comedies.  Plot  John Beckwith and Jeremy Grey are Washington D.C. divorce mediators who crash weddings to meet and have sex with women. At the end of a season of successful crashes, Jeremy takes John to a wedding for the daughter of the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, William Cleary. Once inside, the pair set their sights on Cleary's other daughters, Gloria and Claire. Jeremy ends up having sex with Gloria on a nearby beach during the reception. Gloria is possessive and quickly becomes obsessed with Jeremy, and Jeremy urges John to escape the reception with him. Meanwhile, John attempts to court Claire, the maid of honor, but is interrupted by her hotheaded boyfriend, Sack Lodge, who is unfaithful and disrespectful behind her back. When Gloria invites Jeremy and John to an extended weekend party at their family compound, John overrules Jeremy to accept and get closer to Claire. John and Jeremy become acquainted with the Clearys: the Secretary's wife sexually harasses John; Gloria's brother, Todd, tries to seduce Jeremy during the night; Gloria continues to lavish unwanted sexual attention on Jeremy; and Sack repeatedly injures Jeremy during a game of touch football. At dinner, John spikes Sack's wine with eye- drops to make him sick and get more time to connect with Claire. John and Claire continue to bond the next day on a sailing trip. The suspicious Sack takes the men on a hunting trip and pranks them, resulting in Jeremy getting shot in the buttocks. While Jeremy recovers, John and Claire go on a bike ride to a secluded beach. Claire finally admits she is not sure how she feels about Sack and ends up kissing John passionately. Meanwhile, Gloria tends Jeremy's wounds and reveals to him she is not as inexperienced as she initially let on. Jeremy realizes that he himself has been played and that he may be in love with Gloria. While John is confessing his attraction to Claire, they are interrupted by Jeremy being chased out of the house. Sack has investigated (and then exposes) John and Jeremy's identities to the family. Betrayed, Claire turns on John and the Secretary tells them to leave. Over the following months, John attempts to reach Claire but she refuses to see him. He attempts to sneak into her and Sack's engagement party, but is caught and beaten by Sack. Confronting Jeremy about abandoning him, he learns that Jeremy has secretly continued his relationship with Gloria. Betrayed and brokenhearted, John spirals into depression, crashing weddings alone and becoming nihilistic. Meanwhile, as Claire and Sack plan their wedding, Claire's doubts grow. Jeremy proposes to Gloria and tries to ask John to be his best man, but John turns him away. John visits Jeremy's former wedding crashing mentor, Chazz Reinhold, who convinces John to crash a funeral with him. At the funeral, John reconsiders his belief in love and marriage after seeing the grieving widow. He rushes to Jeremy's wedding and joins the wedding mid-ceremony to Jeremy's delight. But, Claire is upset by his appearance, prompting John to express regret for his past behavior and profess his love for her in front of the congregation. Sack interrupts, but Claire finally tells him that she cannot marry him. Sack tries to attack John, but Jeremy intervenes and knocks him out, and John and Claire kiss. After the wedding, the two couples drive away from the ceremony together and discuss crashing another wedding together.  Cast  Arizona Senator and 2008 Republican presidential nominee John McCain and Democratic strategist and CNN contributor James Carville both make a brief cameo appearance, they are shown congratulating the secretary and his wife on their daughter's wedding. McCain was criticized for his appearance in the film, having previously called out Hollywood for marketing R-Rated films to teenagers.  Production  Andrew Panay, co-producer of Wedding Crashers, had the idea for the film based on his own experience as a wedding crasher in his youth. Panay then consulted the screenwriting team of Steve Faber and Bob Fisher to come up with a story based on this premise. The screenwriters had doubts it could be sustained into a feature-length film, so they decided to add female love interests born from a political family, inspired by their dream of marrying a girl from the Kennedy family when they were youngsters. It was also Panay's desire \\"to explore male friendship through this crazy idea of crashing weddings.\\" Director David Dobkin said they had discussed the possibility of releasing a version of the film that was not R-rated, but the idea was abandoned after a consultant provided a long list of the many R-Rated elements in the film, and Dobkin realized \\"The two funniest scenes in the movie would have had to go.\\" Dobkin insisted on three and a half weeks of rehearsals before filming began, based on his background working in theater. = Filming = Principal photography began on March 22, 2004, in Washington, D.C. The movie had a 52-day shooting schedule. The main Cleary wedding reception scene was filmed at the Inn at Perry Cabin in Saint Michaels, Maryland. Ellenborough Estate in Easton, MD is the setting of the Cleary family house, where most of the movie takes place.  Release  = Critical response = On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 76% based on 188 reviews, with an average rating of 6.72/10. The website's critical consensus states, \\"Wedding Crashers is both raunchy and sweet, and features top-notch comic performances from Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 64 out of 100 based on reviews from 39 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade A-. Carina Chocano of the Los Angeles Times wrote a favorable review, and in particular praised Vaughan's performance: \\"Jeremy is the soul of the movie. There's something about Vaughn ‚Äî the deadpan eyes; the sublimated, misdirected intelligence ‚Äî that recalls Bill Murray in his \\"Caddyshack\\" years.\\" Chocano was critical of Will Ferrell's \\"hyper-active bonehead routine\\" and called the interlude awful. She added that the film was \\"really just a love story about a couple of buddies who live happily ever after. And it couldn't have happened to a nicer, more charming couple\\". Manohla Dargis of the New York Times wrote, \\"It's crude, yes, but also funny; too bad these lost boys can't stay lost. Like clockwork, the film soon mutates from a guy-oriented sex comedy into a wish-fulfillment chick flick\\". Brian Lowry of Variety described the film as \\"fairly amusing, fitfully over the top and [...] occasionally a touch homophobic\\". He praised McAdams as she manages to \\"fill in narrative gaps and actually creates a real character\\", said Vaughan's dialog had most of the comedic highlights, and wrote that Walken was underused. Lowry concluded, \\"While neither a full-throated R-rated romp a la \\"There's Something About Mary\\" nor a fully realized romantic comedy, \\"Wedding Crashers\\" contains enough appealing elements of both to catch the bouquet in what's been a relatively humor-deprived summer. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film two stars out of four; although he wrote that \\"there are individual moments that are very funny\\", he added that the director, David Dobkin, \\"has too much else on his mind\\". British Movie magazine Empire awarded it three out of five stars and were complimentary to Vaughn and Wilson, saying \\"Sharing an easy chemistry and free of the usual joker/straight-guy dynamic, Wilson and Vaughn quip, riff and banter to hilarious effect. And both get their fair share of money moments, the latter‚Äôs muggings are particularly hysterical in a raunchy dinner-party sequence. The laidback stars are funny and sweet, but they‚Äôre let down by a patchy script which squanders some potentially priceless set-ups.\\" Kimberley Jones of The Austin Chronicle wrote that the film \\"will no doubt make buckets of money, but it‚Äôll do so without half the wit, compassion, or inspired madness of Mary\\". Jones complained that the plot was \\"mostly cookie-cutter stuff\\", and was offended by the portrayal of minorities, writing \\"gays and blacks are represented, respectively, by a squirrelly psychotic and a Jamaican house servant\\". Jones concluded, \\"A stiff drink or maybe some pharmaceutical assistance might have made me overlook the film's sour tone, or the unremarkableness of its direction.\\" In a 2018 review, Scott Meslow of GQ reexamined the film, writing \\"the gender and sexual dynamics that have aged rather poorly, Wedding Crashers feels awfully uneven today.\\" He noted a date-rape joke in the opening minutes, complained about the lack of developed female characters, objected to the sassy racist grandmother trope, called the predatory gay man trope \\"inexcusably unfunny\\", felt that the film trivializes rape, and called Will Ferrell's cameo lazy. Meslow conceded that \\"For all its faults, it does have an extremely strong pair of leads\\", but ultimately concluded that the film does not hold up. = Box office = The film was released in North America on July 15, 2005, and became an immediate hit, grossing $33,900,720 in its first weekend, opening at #2 in the box office, behind Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Exit polling indicated that 60% of audiences were over 25 years old, and almost evenly split between men and women. Considering its budget of $40 million and competition with heavily advertised blockbusters during the summer season, and the R-Rating limiting their potential audience, the studio did not expect the movie's level of success. New Line head of distribution, David Tuckerman said \\"We would have been happy with $25 million this weekend.\\" The film eventually grossed over $209,255,921 domestically, narrowly outgrossing Charlie. It grossed $75,920,820 in other territories, totaling $285,176,741 worldwide. = Accolades = On April 24, 2006, Wedding Crashers topped the nominations for the year's MTV Movie Awards with five including Best Movie. It won Best Movie, On-Screen Team (Vaughn and Wilson), and Breakthrough Performance (Isla Fisher). The financial success of the film has been credited along with The 40-Year-Old Virgin for reviving the popularity of adult-aimed R-rated comedies. Bradley Cooper was mentioned in the August 2006 issue of GQ as one of \\"The Top Twelve Movie Dicks\\". = Home media = The DVD was released in the United States on January 3, 2006, and a Blu-ray was released on December 30, 2008. It is available in an unrated version (\\"Uncorked Edition\\") and in an R-rated version (the Blu-ray has both versions on one disc). It features eight new minutes integrated into the film and DVD-ROM bonuses. Also included are two audio commentaries (one by the stars, one by the director), four deleted scenes, two featurettes, a \\"Rules of Wedding Crashing\\" text gallery, trailers, Budweiser Wedding Crashers commercials, a track listing for the official soundtrack on 20th Century Fox Records, a music video by The Sights, and a jump-to-a-song sample feature. The film earned an estimated $145 million from home media sales.  In other media  The music video for the 2014 Maroon 5 song \\"Sugar\\" showed the band crashing real-life weddings, inspired by Wedding Crashers; it was directed by David Dobkin.  Television version  The creators of the film made a reality TV version, called The Real Wedding Crashers and shown on NBC in April and May 2007. NBC only showed four episodes.  Discussed sequel  In a 2014 post on the website Quora, Wedding Crashers director David Dobkin said that he, Vaughn and Wilson once came up with an idea for a sequel in which John and Jeremy find themselves competing with a superior wedding crasher, played by Daniel Craig; but that this idea never went beyond the discussion phase. The 2013 film The Internship, which also starred Vaughn and Wilson, was described by critic A.A. Dowd as an unofficial sequel to Wedding Crashers. In a November 2016 interview, Fisher stated that Vaughn had told her that there were ongoing talks about a sequel.

Providing and receiving information is free. This is in contrast to signaling in which sending certain messages may be costly for the sender depending on the state of the world. One actor has information and the other has ability to act. The informed player can choose strategically what to say and what not to say. Things become interesting when the interests of the players are not aligned. The classic example is of an expert (say, an ecologist) trying to explain the state of the world to an uninformed decision maker (say, politician voting on a deforestation bill). The decision maker, after hearing the report from the expert, must then make a decision which affects the payoffs of both players. This basic setting set by Crawford and Sobel has given rise to a variety of variants. To give a formal definition, cheap talk is communication that is: # costless to transmit and receive # non-binding (i.e. does not limit strategic choices by either party) # unverifiable (i.e. cannot be verified by a third party like a court) Therefore, an agent engaging in cheap talk could lie with impunity, but may choose in equilibrium not to do so. Crawford and Sobel's original article =Setting= In the basic form of the game, there are two players communicating, one sender S and one receiver R. Type. Sender S gets knowledge of the state of the world or of his \\"type\\" t. Receiver R does not know t ; he has only ex-ante beliefs about it, and relies on a message from S to possibly improve the accuracy of his beliefs. Message. S decides to send message m. Message m may disclose full information, but it may also give limited, blurred information: it will typically say \\"The state of the world is between t1 and t2\\". It may give no information at all. The form of the message does not matter, as long as there is mutual understanding, common interpretation. It could be a general statement from a central bank's chairman, a political speech in any language, etc. Whatever the form, it is eventually taken to mean \\"The state of the world is between t1 and t2\\". Action. Receiver R receives message m. R updates his beliefs about the state of the world given new information that he might get, using Bayes's rule. R decides to take action a. This action impacts both his own utility and the sender's utility. Utility. The decision of S regarding the content of m is based on maximizing his utility, given what he expects R to do. Utility is a way to quantify satisfaction or wishes. It can be financial profits, or non- financial satisfaction‚Äîfor instance the extent to which the environment is protected. > ‚Üí Quadratic utilities: The respective utilities of S and R can be specified > by the following: U^S(a, t) = -(a-t-b)^2 U^R(a,t)=-(a-t)^2 The theory > applies to more general forms of utility, but quadratic preferences makes > exposition easier.

We look for an equilibrium where each player decides optimally, assuming that the other player also decides optimally. Players are rational, although R has only limited information. Expectations get realized, and there is no incentive to deviate from this situation. =Theorem= Figure 1: Cheap talk communication setting Crawford and Sobel characterize possible Nash equilibria. * There are typically multiple equilibria, but in a finite number. * Separating, which means full information revelation, is not a Nash equilibrium. * Babbling, which means no information transmitted, is always an equilibrium outcome. When interests are aligned, then information is fully disclosed. When conflict of interest is very large, all information is kept hidden. These are extreme cases. The model allowing for more subtle case when interests are close, but different and in these cases optimal behavior leads to some but not all information being disclosed, leading to various kinds of carefully worded sentences that we may observe. > More generally : *There exists N* > 0 such that for all N with 1 ‚â§ N ‚â§ N*, > *there exists at least an equilibrium in which the set of induced actions > has cardinality N; and moreover *there is no equilibrium that induces more > than N* actions. Messages. While messages could ex-ante assume an infinite number of possible values ¬µ(t) for the infinite number of possible states of the world t, actually they may take only a finite number of values (m1, m2, . . . , mN). Thus an equilibrium may be characterized by a partition (t0(N), t1(N). . . tN(N)) of the set of types [0, 1], where 0 = t0(N) < t1(N) < . . . < tN(N) = 1. This partition is shown on the top right segment of Figure 1. The ti(N)‚Äôs are the bounds of intervals where the messages are constant: for ti-1(N) < t < ti(N), ¬µ(t) = mi. Actions. Since actions are functions of messages, actions are also constant over these intervals: for ti-1(N) < t < ti(N), Œ±(t) = Œ±(mi) = ai. The action function is now indirectly characterized by the fact that each value ai optimizes return for the R, knowing that t is between t1 and t2. Mathematically (assuming that t is uniformly distributed over [0, 1]), a_i = \\\\bar{a}(t_{i-1}, t_i) = \\\\mathrm{arg}\\\\max_a \\\\int_{t_{i-1}}^{t_i} U^R(a, t) dt > ‚Üí Quadratic utilities: Given that R knows that t is between ti-1 and ti, and > in the special case quadratic utility where R wants action a to be as close > to t as possible, we can show that quite intuitively the optimal action is > the middle of the interval: a_i = \\\\frac{t_{i-1} + t_i}{2} Indifference condition. What happens at t = ti? The sender has to be indifferent between sending either message mi-1 or mi. U^S (a_i, t_i) = U^S (a_{i+1}, t_i) 1 ‚â§ i‚â§ N-1 This gives information about N and the ti. > ‚Üí Practically: We consider a partition of size N.

Example: We assume that b = 1/20. > Then N* = 3. We now describe all the equilibria for N=1, 2, or 3 (see Figure > 2). Figure 2: Message and utilities for conflict of interest b = 1/20, for N=1, 2, and 3 > N = 1: This is the babbling equilibrium. t0 = 0, t1 = 1; a1 = 1/2 = 0.5. > N = 2: t0 = 0, t1 = 2/5 = 0.4, t2 = 1; a1 = 1/5 = 0.2, a2 = 7/10 = 0.7. > N = N* = 3: t0 = 0, t1 = 2/15, t2 = 7/15, t3 = 1; a1 = 1/15, a2 = 3/10 = > 0.3, a3 = 11/15. > With N = 1, we get the coarsest possible message, which does not give any > information.

Applications =Game theory= Cheap talk can, in general, be added to any game and has the potential to enhance the set of possible equilibrium outcomes. For example, one can add a round of cheap talk in the beginning of the Battle of the Sexes. Each player announces whether they intend to go to the football game, or the opera. Because the Battle of the Sexes is a coordination game, this initial round of communication may enable the players to select among multiple equilibria, thereby achieving higher payoffs than in the uncoordinated case. The messages and strategies which yield this outcome are symmetric for each player. They are: 1) announce opera or football with even probability 2) if a person announces opera (or football), then upon hearing this message the other person will say opera (or football) as well (Farrell and Rabin, 1996). If they both announce different options, then no coordination is achieved. In the case of only one player messaging, this could also give that player a first-mover advantage. It is not guaranteed, however, that cheap talk will have an effect on equilibrium payoffs. Another game, the Prisoner's Dilemma, is a game whose only equilibrium is in dominant strategies. Any pre-play cheap talk will be ignored and players will play their dominant strategies (Defect, Defect) regardless of the messages sent. =Biological applications= It has been commonly argued that cheap talk will have no effect on the underlying structure of the game. In biology authors have often argued that costly signalling best explains signalling between animals (see Handicap principle, Signalling theory). This general belief has been receiving some challenges (see work by Carl Bergstrom and Brian Skyrms 2002, 2004). In particular, several models using evolutionary game theory indicate that cheap talk can have effects on the evolutionary dynamics of particular games.

He is associated with the development of population and community ecology, including studies of invasive organisms. Personal life Charles Sutherland Elton was born in Manchester, a son of the literary scholar Oliver Elton and the children's writer Letitia Maynard Elton (n√©e MacColl). He had an older brother, Geoffrey Elton,P. Crowcroft, Elton's Ecologist: A history of the Bureau of Animal Population. Chicago, Il: The University of Chicago Press, 1991. who died at 33, and to whom Charles Elton in many of his writings attributes his interest in scientific natural history. Charles Elton married the English poet Edith Joy Scovell in 1937, a first five-year marriage to Rose Montague having ended in amicable divorce.General Registry Office records 1928, 1937. Charles and Joy had two children.Article. Professional life Charles Elton was educated at Liverpool College and Oxford University, from which he graduated in zoology in 1922, with a first in his field research project and a third in the exams, and where he subsequently had his entire academic career. During his studies at Oxford he conceptualized his ideas about animal ecology, aiming was to turn natural history into the science of ecology by applying scientific methods to studying the lives of animals in their natural habitats and interactions with the environment. In 1921, while still an undergraduate, Elton assisted Julian Huxley on an expedition to Spitsbergen, where he made an ecological survey of Arctic vertebrates. This he continued on three more Arctic expeditions in 1923, 1924 and 1930. He also spent some time on fieldwork in St. Kilda, Scotland. His Arctic experience led to a consultancy with the Hudson's Bay Company in 1926‚Äì1931, to study fluctuating populations of animal species of interest to the fur trade. He later made similar studies of British mouse and vole populations. He spent many years on field research in Wytham Woods, Oxford. Elton's early career was influenced by Alexander Carr-Saunders, Victor Ernest Shelford and Gordon Hewitt. In 1922 Alexander Carr-Saunders wrote The Population Problem: A Study of Human Evolution, where he outlines how the influence of overpopulation in humans has cascading effects on plant and animal life around the world.A. M. Carr-Saunders, The Population Problem: a study in human evolution. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1922. Elton later applied these ideas of fluctuation to animals. Victor Ernest Shelford wrote Animal Communities in Temperate America in 1913, where he outlines three main principles of ecology: (1) emphasis on the importance of studying the physiology of the organism, rather than the physiology of a specific organ; (2) evaluation of the \\"phenomena of behaviour and physiology\\" in relation to the natural environments; and (3) relation of the ecology of plant life to that of animal life.V. E. Shelford, Animal Communities in Temperate America. Chicago, Il: The University of Chicago Press, 1913. In Gordon Hewitt's 1921 book The Conservation of the Wildlife of Canada, Elton noticed the Canadian lynx and snowshoe hare population cycles, and developed greater understanding of population fluctuations in Arctic vertebrates with the Hudson's Bay Company.C. S. Elton, Animal Ecology. Britain: William Clowes and Sons Ltd, 1968 reprint. In 1932, Elton established the Bureau of Animal Population at Oxford, which became a centre for collecting data on fluctuations in animal populations. In the same year, the Journal of Animal Ecology was founded, with Elton as its first editor. In 1936, he was appointed reader in animal ecology at Oxford University, and Corpus Christi College elected him a senior research fellow. During the Second World War, the Bureau of Animal Population was entrusted by the Agricultural Research Council to find efficient methods for controlling rats, mice and rabbits. After the Second World War, Elton started a 20-year survey of animals and their interrelationships on Oxford University's Wytham estate, covering those in meadows, woods and water. After his retirement, he did some studies in tropical America. Elton's great interest in nature conservation and problems in management of nature reserves led him to be instrumental in establishing the Nature Conservancy Council in 1949. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1953 and received the society's Darwin Medal in 1970.Chrono-Biographical Sketch: Charles Elton. Intellectual heritage In 1927, Elton published his classic Animal Ecology, outlining the principles behind ecological studies of animal behaviour and life history, such as food chains, size of food items, ecological niche, and the concept of a pyramid of numbers to represent the structure of an ecosystem in terms of feeding relationships. There he also introduced ideas such as the food cycle, the connection between various parts of the ecosystem, and the concept of food pyramid and trophic levels. He also discussed how ecosystems are organized and ordered, in what later became the foundation of the ecosystem concept. Elton was the first to discuss the ecological significance of population cycles. He also described how predators had an influence on prey, and so on generating cycles. In later works on the niche theory, Elton's definition ‚Äì the Eltonian niche ‚Äì in terms of functional attributes of organisms (or its position in the trophic web), has been viewed by some authors as opposed to Joseph Grinnell's earlier definition emphasising states of the environment suitable for the species. Others have argued there are more similarities than differences between the two versions of the niche concept.T. W. Schoener, \\"The Ecological Niche\\", pp. 79‚Äì113, 1989; J. M. Cherrett et al., Ecological Concepts, Oxford: Blackwell Scientific Publications, 1989. After the Second World War, Elton became much more concerned with the impact of invasive species on natural ecosystems. His 1958 book The Ecology of Invasions by Animals and Plants founded invasion ecology as a separate sub-discipline.M. A. Davis, K. Thompson and J. P. Grime, \\"Charles S. Elton and the dissociation of invasion ecology from the rest of ecology\\". Diversity & Distributions, 7:97‚Äì102, 2001 Full text. This book became the basis of the study of biological invasions. It was the first of its kind to warn about the harmful effects and damages invasive species can have on an ecosystem. The first part of the book focuses on the invader species and their mode of transport into the new environment. The second part of the book focuses on the struggle between invasive species and the indigenous, though some invaders enter habitats with no prior species filling their specific niche. The final part of The Ecology of Invasions by Animals and Plants deals with the issue of conservation and its importance to maintain species diversity.C. S.

Most critics believeCalamus: Male Homosexuality in Twentieth-Century Literature: An International anthology, David Galloway, Christian SabischWhitman's \\"Calamus\\": A Rhetorical Prehistory of the First Gay American-J. Killingsworth Walt Whitman, Prophet of Gay Liberation that these poems are Whitman's clearest expressions in print of his ideas about homosexual love. Genesis and \\"Live Oak With Moss\\" The first evidence of the poems that were to become the \\"Calamus\\" cluster is an unpublished manuscript sequence of twelve poems entitled \\"Live Oak With Moss,\\" written in or before spring 1859.Alan Helms, \\"Live Oak With Moss (1953‚Äì1954).\\" Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia. Eds. J. R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings. New York: Garland, 1998. 400‚Äì401. These poems were all incorporated in Whitman's 1860 edition of Leaves of Grass, but out of their original sequence. These poems seem to recount the story of a relationship between the speaker of the poems and a male lover. Even in Whitman's intimate writing style, these poems, read in their original sequence, seem unusually personal and candid in their disclosure of love and disappointment, and this manuscript has become central to arguments about Whitman's homoeroticism or homosexuality. This sequence was not known in its original manuscript order until a 1953 article by Fredson Bowers.Bowers, Fredson. \\"Whitman's Manuscripts for the Original 'Calamus' Poems.\\" Studies in Bibliography 6(1953): 257‚Äì265. \\"Calamus\\" sequence In the 1860 third edition of Leaves of Grass, Whitman included the twelve \\"Live Oak\\" poems along with others to form a sequence of 45 untitled numbered poems. This sequence as written celebrates many aspects of \\"comradeship\\" or \\"adhesive love,\\" Whitman's term, borrowed from phrenology to describe male same-sex attraction.Miller, James E. Jr. \\"Calamus.\\" Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia. Eds. J. R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings. New York: Garland, 1998. 95‚Äì97. This attraction is presented in its political, spiritual, metaphysical, and personal phases‚ÄîWhitman offering it as the backbone of future nations, the root of religious sentiments, the solution to the big questions of life, and as a source of personal anguish and joy. The 1860 edition contains three poems that Whitman would later edit out of the sequence, including the very personal Calamus 8, \\"Long I thought that knowledge alone would suffice me,\\" and Calamus 9, \\"Hours continuing long, sore and heavy-hearted.\\" Whitman's constant editing of his works meant that many of the other poems would change and shift throughout the editions of his life. By the 1881‚Äì82 edition, the poems had been reduced to 39. Some critics contended that Whitman's edits tended to reduce some of his most personal and specific disclosures, possibly as an attempt to make the sequence more attractive to its wider audience.Raleigh, Richard \\"[\\"Hours Continuing Long.\\"] Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia. Eds. J. R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings. New York: Garland, 1998. 282‚Äì283. Others, such as Betsy Erkkila, note that Whitman retained some equally personal poems for the 1867 edition, and see his selection as a function of Whitman building a particular national persona for himself. The meaning of Calamus as a symbol Acorus calamus This cluster of poems contains a number of images and motifs that are repeated throughout. The most important is probably the Calamus root itself. Acorus calamus or Sweet Flag is a marsh-growing plant similar to a cat-tail. Whitman continues through this one of the central images of Leaves of Grass ‚Äì Calamus is treated as a larger example of the grass that he writes of elsewhere. Some scholars have pointed out, as reasons for Whitman's choice, the phallic shape of what Whitman calls the \\"pink-tinged roots\\" of Calamus, its mythological association with failed male same-sex love and with writing (see Kalamos), and the allegedly mind-altering effects of the root.Auclair, Tracy. \\"The Language of Drug Use in Whitman's 'Calamus' Poems.\\" Papers on Language and Literature 40 (Summer 2004), 227‚Äì259.

History Miele's first products were a cream separator, butter churn, and tub washing machine, under the Meteor brand. Carl Miele supervised manufacturing personally, and Reinhard Zinkann apprenticed and handled finances and sales. In 1927, Miele started the production of vacuum cleaners. In 1929, the first electric dishwasher in Europe was produced. From 1930, motorcycles were built. In 1932, Miele was the largest centrifuge factory in Europe. During World War II, Miele produced control units for torpedoes of the German Kriegsmarine.:de:Miele The Miele trademark was used very early on and appeared on all machines, nameplates, printed materials and advertising produced by the company. From the mid-1920s, a recognition feature of the logo has been a sloping dash used as the dot on the \\"i\\". The trademark has remained unchanged apart from three minor alterations to reflect contemporary tastes. A survey by the S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, one of Germany's leading daily newspapers, found that the \\"i\\" alone was sufficient to identify the Miele brand. Miele exports products to global markets and is represented in 47 countries. Their expansion into the United States came in 1983, when they established corporate headquarters in Somerset, New Jersey.

The village consists mainly of one road of terraced housing that runs from Langley Moor in the north-east to Willington and Crook in the south-west. Directly to the north is the large village of Brandon. This was the site of a pit and also a brick works. The village has a small industrial estate, which was the scene of a relatively large fire in a nappy factory in 1991. St John the Evangelist Church, Meadowfield One of the few buildings of any note is the Anglican church of St John the Evangelist, one of the larger parish churches in County Durham. There is also a Royal British Legion Social Club, which occupies a wooden cabin which was brought over from Canada. The centre of the street houses the large structure of council offices, which once was the village Co-Op. The building has recently been demolished and the site developed as a housing project. The village also has a sports centre and adjacent playing field. The field is home to many activities, such as being training pitch to the Durham Tigers rugby league side, and is also home to an annual sporting events and steam rallies.

It is based on the novel by Lew McCreary, and directed by Hampton Fancher, who also wrote the screenplay. The film centers on a serial killer whom Fancher describes as \\"a cross between Psycho's Norman Bates, Melville's Billy Budd and Being There's Chauncey Gardner\\".New York Observer review Plot Vann Siegert (Owen Wilson) is a wandering serial killer who poisons his victims; he explains that he feels he is helping them and that they die without pain. After killing a heroin addict named Casper (Sheryl Crow) he met at a bar, he makes her death look like an overdose and moves to a new town. The next day, he arrives at the home of Doug and Jane Durwin (Brian Cox and Mercedes Ruehl) and rents out the room of their missing daughter. Doug recommends he look for work at the post office, as they are hiring seasonal help for Christmas. Doug takes Vann to a high school football game, where he meets Gene (Eric Mabius), a star athlete, and his family. A few days later, Vann offers the boy a ride and murders him, burying his body on a beach. While he is digging the grave, Vann has an imaginary conversation with two detectives, Blair and Graves (Dwight Yoakam and Dennis Haysbert), who ask taunting questions about his methods. Later, Vann helps the town search for the missing athlete and even attends his memorial service. He reveals that killing Gene broke two of his personal rules: don't kill anyone you know, and don't kill anyone from your town. Vann's ties to the community grow as he is given more responsibility at the post office. One of Vann's co-workers, Ferrin (Janeane Garofalo), sheepishly pursues him. Doug drives her to the beach, where the pair exchange an awkward hug directly over the spot where Vann buried Gene. On Christmas Day, Vann goes to a diner and chooses another victim (Meg Foster). She invites him to her home, where he sees that she is a painter. Something about her work disturbs him and he flees. Vann returns to the diner and slips poison into the water of a man (Lew McCreary) eating alone. An autopsy reveals that the death was the result of a rare poison derived from tree bark fungus found in the Pacific Northwest. The poison is then linked to Casper's death, and to Gene's when his body is found. Vann knows that the police will eventually tie the murders to him. While looking in the mirror, he pulls hairs off his jacket and puts them in an envelope on which he writes 'FERRiN'. Jane is found dead from a blow to the back of the head. The police suspect Doug, but Vann is worried that the increased scrutiny from another murder will lead the police to him. During a date with Ferrin, he tries to initiate sex by assaulting her. She is terrified, and Vann leaves. The next day, the police arrest Doug for Jane's murder. Vann packs his things. Before he leaves town, he puts his postal uniform and the envelope marked \\"FERRiN\\", containing the sample of his hair, in a mailbox. The film ends as he drives on the highway, saying that he wants to lead a more regular life once he gets to wherever he is going. He is pursued by a cop who had earlier approached him on the beach. After taking a good look with her spotlight, she smiles at him and takes the right fork in the road, while Vann takes the left.

They originally played in the city of Durham. The city of Durham is now represented in the Rugby League Conference by Durham Demons. The club has a number of age level teams playing in the North East Junior League. The club's most famous old boy Patrick Rich went on to play professionally for Keighley Cougars, Oldham R.L.F.C., London Skolars and Sheffield Eagles. History Durham Tigers date back to the early 1990s when rugby league began to be played in the North East of England. The team was formed by Steve Rich and was based at the cricket club in Langley Moor in the city of Durham. When adult rugby league moved to a summer season, the Tigers, located at a cricket ground, could not play in the summer. Without the backing of adult rugby the junior section failed to flourish. The game in the area was revived when Lisa Jaggar, Rugby League North East regional development officer, asked Gareth Barron and Phil Selby to form a senior side to go into the Rugby League Conference North East division to fill a gap created when Gateshead Panthers merged into Newcastle Knights before the 2001 season. The newly renamed Durham Phoenix struggled but were eventually rescued when players from Gateshead Storm helped out Durham. After this initial season the club returned to their former name of Durham Tigers. The club moved to Bishop Auckland RFC's West Mills ground. With an influx of players from Bishop Auckland RFC and Consett RFC as well as Yorkshire-based players the team flourished. Durham Tigers won the North East division in 2005 and went into the national play-offs only to lose to Wetherby Bulldogs. Junior development then became the issue, having become one of the top junior sides in the North East, the under-16s joined the Yorkshire Youth league. In 2007 Durham stepped up and joined the North Premier Division. Coach John Coutts joined Gateshead Storm and a couple of leading players went with him. Yorkshire-based players stopped playing for Durham when a Yorkshire Premier division was formed. Results were poor and the team folded after a big defeat by Jarrow Vikings. Following on from this the club committee decided to concentrate on junior development. Durham planned to upgrade facilities at Bishop Auckland in partnership with Bishop Auckland RFC having acquired Sports England Club Mark status. However, the club's lease was revoked and Durham Tigers initially re- located to St. John's School. However, in March 2010 the club moved into the Sunnydale Leisure Centre in Shildon with the intention of making this their long term home. In 2015 Durham Tigers is the only Community based Rugby League Club based in South Durham with their home still at Shildon. The club continues to seek new players and develop them, encouraging players to play both codes of rugby at junior level to maximise their development. In 2015 the club was accredited as an England Player development Club by the RFL and several coaches were accredited as England Player Development Coaches after completing the successful Embed the Pathway programme. The year culminated with Jake Egglestone (developed through the junior teams at Tigers) becoming a regular for the Newcastle Thunder Under 19's and Nathaniel Kitching being selected as the captain of the Newcastle Thunder Academy under 16's team. 2016 looks like it will be a great year for the Tigers, we have a rolling community engagement programme with coaches from the club and the North East RFL going to schools to provide a taste of rugby to all ages.

Its scientific name commemorates the French naturalists Jules and Edouard Verreaux. Distribution and habitat Sabal Palm Sanctuary - Texas The dove is a resident breeder from southernmost Texas in the United States through Mexico and Central America south to western Peru and central Argentina. It also breeds on the offshore islands of northern South America, including Trinidad and Tobago and the Netherlands Antilles. It inhabits scrub, woodland and forest. =Subspecies= Numerous subspecies exist; some of the more widespread are: * L. v. verreauxi ‚Äì Bonaparte, 1855: the nominate taxon, found from Nicaragua to Venezuela * L. v. angelica ‚Äì Bangs & Penard, TE, 1922: found from Texas and coastal Mexico * L. v. decolor ‚Äì Salvin, 1895: found west of the Andes from Colombia to northern Peru * L. v. brasiliensis ‚Äì (Bonaparte, 1856): found in most of the Amazon north of the Amazon River * L. v. decipiens ‚Äì (Salvadori, 1871): found in much of central South America Description The dove is about long and weighs . Adult birds of most races have a grey tinge from the crown to the nape, a pale grey or whitish forehead and a whitish throat. The eye-ring is typically red in most of its range, but blue in most of the Amazon and northern South America. The upperparts and wings are grey-brown, and the underparts are whitish shading to pinkish, dull grey or buff on the chest. The underwing coverts are rufous. The tail is broadly tipped with white, but this is best visible from below or in flight. The bill is black, the legs are red and the iris is yellow. The white-tipped dove resembles the closely related grey-fronted dove (Leptotila rufaxilla), which prefers humid forest habitats. The best distinctions are the greyer forehead and crown, which contrast less with the hindcrown than in the grey-fronted dove. In the area of overlap, the white-tipped dove usually has a blue (not red) eye-ring, but this is not reliable in some parts of Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay, where it typically is red in both species. Behaviour White-tipped dove The white-tipped dove is usually seen singly or in pairs, and is rather wary. Its flight is fast and direct, with the regular beats and clattering of the wings which are characteristic of pigeons in general. The call is a deep hollow ooo-wooooo. =Breeding= It builds a large stick nest in a tree and lays two white eggs. Incubation is about 14 days, and fledging another 15. =Feeding= The food is mainly seeds obtained by foraging on the ground, but it will also take insects, including butterflies and moths.

Leonard Digges (c.1515 ‚Äì c.1559) was a well-known English mathematician and surveyor, credited with the invention of the theodolite, and a great populariser of science through his writings in English on surveying, cartography, and military engineering. His birth date is variously suggested as c.1515. or c.1520 (but certainly by 1530). Much of his work was expanded on, annotated, and published by his son, Thomas Digges. His son followed in his footsteps and was a pivotal player in the popularisation of Copernicus's book De revolutionibus orbium coelestium. Notes written by Thomas Digges in the publication of the book Pantometria in 1570 contain descriptions of how Leonard Digges made use of a \\"proportional Glass\\" to view distant objects and people. Some, such as astronomer and historian Colin Ronan, claim this describes a reflecting or refracting telescope built between 1540 and 1559, but its vague description and claimed performance makes it dubious. Biography Leonard Digges, born about 1515, was the only son of James Digges (born c.1473), esquire, of Digges Court and Broome in Barham, Kent, by his second wife, Philippe Engham, the daughter of John Engham, esquire, of Chart, Kent. James Digges had been High Sheriff of Kent in 1510‚Äì11, and had married as his first wife Mildred Fineux, the daughter of Sir John Fineux, Chief Justice of the King's Bench, and Elizabeth Apuldrefield, by whom he had an only son, John Digges, who married Mildred Scott, the daughter of Sir John Scott (d. 7 October 1533) of Scot's Hall in Smeeth, Kent. John Digges predeceased his father, leaving two sons by his wife, Mildred Scott, William Digges and Francis Digges. James Digges made his last will on 20 February 1535/6 requesting burial in the north chancel of the church of Barham, 'where my mother and my wife do lie', and naming as executors his second wife, Philippe; John Sackville, esquire; his nephew, Robert Brent, gentleman; and his son, Leonard, with Sir William Hawte as overseer.. The will was proved on 24 November 1540, at which time his second wife, Philippe, was still living.; ; . Leonard Digges was the grandson of John Digges, esquire, of Digges Court and Broome, High Sheriff of Kent in 1495-6, and his wife Joan Clifton, the daughter and co-heiress of Sir Gervase Clifton of Clifton, Nottinghamshire, London, and Brabourne, Kent, by his first wife, Isabel Herbert, daughter of Vincent Herbert, esquire.. Leonard Digges' aunt, Isabel Digges, the daughter of John Digges and Joan Clifton, married Richard Sackville (d. 28 July 1524), esquire, and was the mother of John Sackville.. In 1542 Digges, in company with three other gentlemen, visited the castle of Gu√Ænes, 'where they impressed their host through debate and demonstration of their skills in geometry, navigation, measurement, and artillery'. In January 1554 Digges took part in an unsuccessful rebellion led by the Protestant Sir Thomas Wyatt, who opposed the projected marriage between Philip II of Spain and England's new Catholic Queen, Mary I. Digges was convicted of high treason, attainted, and condemned to death. His life was pardoned on 1 April 1554, but according to Johnston 'his lands and goods, which had been seized after his attainder, continued to be held subject to payment of recognizances to the crown'. In February 1555 Digges was fined 400 marks. After being paid off in instalments, the fine was discharged on 7 May 1558.. The date of Digges' death is unknown; he is thought to have died about 1559:Some sources, including the first edition of the Dictionary of National Biography, erroneously state that he died about 1571. > From Thomas's autobiographical comments in a legal dispute of the 1590s it > can be inferred that Leonard died about 1559, shortly after he had resumed > possession of his confiscated lands. =Marriage and issue= Digges married Bridget Wilford, the daughter of Thomas Wilford, esquire, of Hartridge in Cranbrook, Kent, by his first wife, Elizabeth Culpeper, the daughter of Walter Culpeper, esquire, by whom he had three sons and three daughters: *Thomas Digges, esquire. *James Digges. *Daniel Digges. *Mary Digges, who married a husband surnamed Barber. *Anne Digges, who married William Digges. *Sarah Digges, who married firstly a husband surnamed Martin, and secondly John Weston. Works The first publication of many by Leonard Digges was A General Prognostication published in 1553, which became a best-seller as it contained a perpetual calendar, collections of weather lore and a wealth of astronomical material, until then largely only obtainable through books published in Latin or Greek. It was revised in 1555 (the earliest surviving edition) and again in 1556 with the title A Prognostication everlasting. Subsequent editions reprint the text from 1556; editions from 1576 and later include additional material by his son. Title page of Leonard Digges's Pantometria (1591) =Telescope= There are claims Leonard Digges independently invented the reflecting telescope, and/or the refracting telescope as part of his need to see accurately over long distances during his surveying works. In the preface to the 1591 Pantometria, (a book on measurement, partially based on his father's notes and observations) Leonard's son Thomas lauded his father's accomplishments. Some of the praise of the son for the father appears to be extravagant exaggeration, while other claims appear more credible. On the fifth page of the preface, Thomas Digges provides a remarkable account of his father's accomplishments: > [H]is divine mind aided with this science of Geometrical mensurations, found > out the quantities, distances, courses, and strange intricate miraculous > motions of these resplendent heavenly Globes of Sun, Moon, Planets and > Stares fixed, leaving the rules and precepts thereof to his posterity. > Archimedes also (as some suppose) with a glass framed by revolution of a > section Parabolicall, fired the Roman navy in the sea coming to the siege of > Syracuse. But to leave these celestial causes and things done of antiquity > long ago, my father by his continual painful [painstaking] practices, > assisted with demonstrations Mathematical, was able, and sundry times hath > by proportional Glasses duly situate in convenient angles, not only > discovered things far off, read letters, numbered pieces of money with the > very coin and superscription thereof, cast by some of his friends of purpose > upon downs in open fields, but also seven miles off declared what hath been > done at that instant in private places. The writings left by Digges' colleague William Bourne contain further detail on the experiments with lenses and mirrors conducted by Leonard Digges and his son. It is these details which led some researchers, most notably Colin Ronan, to claim that Leonard Digges invented a functioning telescope sometime between 1540 and 1559. The description seemed to suggest that Digges created a rudimentary instrument incorporating lenses and a concave mirror, in a manner rather different from a modern reflecting telescope. However, the construction of lenses to the required optical precision would have been very difficult in the 16th century, and the construction of an adequate mirror would have been much harder still. It is doubtful that Digges built a successful instrument, and the optical performance required to see the details of coins lying about in fields, or private activities seven miles away was far beyond the technology of the time.

During the 1950s and 1960s, she was the muse and inspiration for many artists of the Soho subculture, including Lucian Freud, Francis Bacon, and (much later) Maggi Hambling, and also known for her three marriages and numerous love affairs. She left her first husband, Michael Law, and married actor Norman Bowler, with whom she had two children. She later married the Indian writer Dom Moraes. Early life and modelling in the 1950s The cover of Moraes' 1994 memoir, Henrietta, reproduces Lucian Freud's Girl in a Blanket, painted in Paris in 1953 (and rarely exhibited since) She was born Audrey Wendy Abbott in Simla, British India, where her father was stationed in the Indian Air Force. Her father deserted her mother when Audrey was young, and she was raised harshly by a tyrannical, abusive grandmother in England. Later she went to secretarial college. By 1950, when she was nineteen years old, Moraes was working as an artists' model in several London art schools. A denizen of the Colony Room, Soho, she became the muse to a number of important British artists in the early 1950s through the mid-1960s. Francis Bacon, who was particularly enthralled by her mercurial character, painted her at least sixteen times from photographs specifically commissioned by him from John Deakin: in May 2002, Bacon's Study for Portrait of Henrietta Moraes was sold by Ernst Beyeler for $6.7 million,The Daily Telegraph, \\"Madness in Manhattan New York sales\\" 20 May 2002. and in February 2012 Bacon's 1963 Portrait of Henrietta Moraes sold for ¬£21.3 million. Lucian Freud, with whom she had an affair, painted Moraes at least three times, including a celebrated 1953 portrait entitled Girl in a Blanket. In 1950, she met her first husband, film- maker Michael Law, who bestowed the name Henrietta on her.See Michael Law, obituary, Telegraph 2001. A film reflecting Law's typical humour is \\"Pedestrian Crossing\\" from 1948, archive.org. They set up home in an attic in Dean Street. Her second husband was bodybuilder and actor Norman Bowler. They had two children, Joshua (b. 1955) and Caroline, although Joshua was later revealed to be the biological son of Colin Tennant, 3rd Baron Glenconner. This marriage ended in 1956. Later in 1956, she met the 18-year-old Indian poet Dom Moraes. They married in 1961 but were amicably divorced by the mid-1960s. Into the hippy and drug scene in the 1960s Moraes was notoriously free- spirited and led a generally hedonistic lifestyle. In the early 1960s, Moraes began to take drugs in addition to her large intake of alcohol. After her death, Tim Hilton guessed from odd remarks that this was the result of sitting through the Eichmann trial in Jerusalem in 1961 together with her journalist husband Dom Moraes, who had been sent there by The Times of India. During the 1960s Moraes, left the art world and hit the hippy scene. She reportedly consumed every drug except heroin, and lost the Chelsea house that John Minton had left to her after his death in 1957 in the process. In the 1960s, she was also an unsuccessful cat burglar hampered by amphetamine psychosis, leading to time in Holloway Prison. As if anticipating her decline, Bacon famously painted her with a syringe a decade before she became a self-confessed \\"junkie\\". Back in London in the 1970s, and in Ireland in the 1980s In the mid-1970s, Moraes shared a mews flat in Hanover Terrace, Regent's Park, London, with singer and actress Marianne Faithfull, an episode in both their lives that forms a key chapter in Faithfull's Memories Dreams & Reflections, published in October 2007. In the late 1970s and early 1980s Moraes was caretaker of Roundwood House, near Mountrath, County Laois, Ireland, which was being restored by the Irish Georgian Society. Many friends visited, and her friend Eric Burdon recorded Darkness Darkness there. Guinness heiress Caroline Blackwood discreetly paid school fees for Moraes's two children during her most untethered years, although Henrietta was not told about it. Funerary monument, Brompton Cemetery, London The last years: a sober life and her memoirs Henrietta She spent her final years in London. She started to write about her life in the book Henrietta, published by Hamish Hamilton in 1994, and was working on a follow-up at the time of her death. This volume of short stories and memoirs was written with the encouragement of her friend, the writer Francis Wyndham. She also attended a twelve-step program to learn how to live without alcohol and drugs. She was diagnosed with diabetes soon after becoming a keen gardener in West London. In her last year of life she was in a relationship with artist Maggi Hambling, who produced a posthumous volume of charcoal portraits of her. Death Moraes died in London in 1999 at the age of 67 in her bed while on the phone to her doctor, bequeathing her long-haired dachshund dog Max to Hambling. She left only a handful of possessions and a large pile of unpaid bills. She is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London. Her coffin was hand-made by her friend Sir Mark Palmer. Other guests included Palmer's wife Catherine Tennant, the designer David Mlinaric and his wife Martha, Penny Guinness, the antiques dealer Christopher Gibbs, and her literary agent, Alexandra Pringle. She had spent time with Palmer in the early 1970s in his \\"cavalcade of horse-drawn caravans\\" as part of an aristocratic early group of New Age travellers.

She is credited with inventing the so- called trolley problem.Philippa Foot, The Problem of Abortion and the Doctrine of the Double Effect in Virtues and Vices (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1978) (originally in the Oxford Review, No. 5, 1967). She was a granddaughter of American President Grover Cleveland.Zack, N., The Handy Philosophy Answer Book (Canton, MI: Visible Ink Press, 2010), p. 354. Personal life Born as Philippa Ruth Bosanquet, Foot was the daughter of Esther Cleveland (1893‚Äì1980) and Captain William Sidney Bence Bosanquet (1893‚Äì1966) of the Coldstream Guards of the British Army. Her paternal grandfather was the barrister and judge, Sir Frederick Albert Bosanquet, Common Serjeant of London from 1900 to 1917. Her maternal grandfather was the 22nd and 24th President of the United States, Grover Cleveland. Foot was educated privately and at Somerville College, Oxford, 1939‚Äì1942, where she obtained a first-class degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE). Her association with Somerville, interrupted only by government service as an economist from 1942 to 1947, continued for the rest of her life. She was a lecturer in philosophy, 1947‚Äì1950, fellow and tutor, 1950‚Äì1969, senior research fellow, 1969‚Äì1988, and honorary fellow, 1988‚Äì2010. She spent many hours there in debate with G. E. M. Anscombe, who persuaded her that non-cognitivism was misguided. In the 1960s and 1970s Foot held a number of visiting professorships in the United States ‚Äì at Cornell, MIT, Berkeley, City University of New York. She was appointed Griffin Professor of Philosophy at the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1976 and taught there until 1991, dividing her time between the United States and England. Contrary to common belief, Foot was not a founder of Oxfam. She joined the organization about six years after its foundation. She was an atheist. She was once married to the historian M. R. D. Foot, and at one time shared a flat with the novelist Iris Murdoch. She died in 2010 on her 90th birthday. Critique of non-cognitivism Foot's work in the 1950s and 1960s sought to adapt Aristotelian ethical theory to a contemporary world view and so competed with such theories as modern deontological and utilitarian ethics. Some of her work was crucial to a re-emergence of normative ethics within analytic philosophy, notably her critique of consequentialism and non- cognitivism. Foot's approach was influenced by the later work of Wittgenstein, although she rarely dealt explicitly with materials he treated. Foot's works in her earlier career were meta-ethical in character: pertaining to the status of moral judgment and speech. The essays \\"Moral Arguments\\" and \\"Moral Beliefs\\" were crucial in overturning the rule of non-cognitivism over analytic approaches to the ethical theory of preceding decades. The non-cognitivist approach may already be found in Hume, but received its most influential analytic formulations in works of A. J. Ayer, C. L. Stevenson, and R. M. Hare, who focused on abstract or \\"thin\\" ethical concepts such as good/bad and right/wrong. These allegedly had a special practicality or link to action that could not hold a \\"matter of fact\\". The non-cognitivists so argued that corresponding expressions are not employed to affirm something true of a thing in question, but rather to express an emotion, or in Hare's case an imperative. Clearly the form of an imperative can apply to any description of action irrespective of content. So \\"morality\\" and \\"the facts\\" are quite independent of each other. This sort of analysis of abstract or \\"thin\\" ethical concepts was tied to a special partitioning account of more concrete or \\"thick\\" concepts, such as \\"cowardly\\", \\"cruel\\" or \\"gluttonous.\\" Such attributes obviously do not swing free of the facts, yet they carry the same \\"practicality\\" that \\"bad\\" or \\"wrong\\" do. They were intended to combine the particular, non-cognitive \\"evaluative\\" element championed by the theory with the obvious, \\"merely descriptive\\" element. One could detach the evaluative force by employing them in an \\"inverted commas sense\\", as one does in attempting to articulate thoughts in a system one opposes, by e. g. putting \\"unmanly\\" or \\"unladylike\\" in quotation marks. That leaves purely \\"descriptive\\" or \\"factual\\" expressions that apply to actions of men and women respectively, whereas employing such expressions without the quotation marks would super-add the non-cognitive extra of \\"and such action is bad\\". Foot's purpose was to criticize this distinction and its underlying account of thin concepts. Her particular approach to the defense of the cognitive and truth-evaluable character of moral judgment made the essays crucial in bringing the question of the rationality of morality to the fore. Practical considerations involving \\"thick\\" ethical concepts ‚Äì \\"but it would be cruel\\", \\"it would be cowardly\\", \\"it's for her to do\\", or \\"I promised her I wouldn't do it\\" ‚Äì move people to act one way rather than another, but remain as purely descriptive as any other judgment pertaining to human life. They differ from thoughts such as \\"it would be done on a Tuesday\\" or \\"it would take about three gallons of paint\\" not by admixing what she considers a non-factual, attitude-expressing, \\"moral\\" element, but simply by the fact that people have reason not to do things that are cowardly or cruel. Her lifelong devotion to the question is apparent in all periods of her work. Morality and reasons =\\"Why moral?\\" ‚Äì early work= It is on the \\"why be moral?\\" question (which for her may be said to divide into the questions \\"why be just?\\", \\"why be temperate?\\", etc.) that her doctrine underwent a surprising series of reversals. In \\"Moral Beliefs\\", she had argued that the received virtues ‚Äì courage, temperance, justice, and so on ‚Äì are typically good for their bearer. They make people stronger, so to speak, and are conditions to happiness. This holds only typically, since the courage of a soldier, for instance, might happen to be precisely his downfall, yet is in some sense essential: possession of sound arms and legs is good as well, though damaged legs may happen to exclude someone from a conscription that assigns contemporaries to their deaths. So people have reason to act in line with the canons of these virtues and avoid cowardly, gluttonous and unjust action. Parents and guardians who want the best for children will steer them accordingly. The \\"thick\\" ethical concepts that she emphasized in her defense of the cognitive character of moral judgement were precisely those associated with such \\"profitable\\" traits, i. e. virtues; this is how such descriptions differ from randomly chosen descriptions of action. The crucial point was that the difference between \\"just action\\" and \\"action performed on Tuesday\\" (for example) was not a matter of superadded \\"emotive\\" meaning, as in Ayer and Stevenson, nor a latent imperative feature, as in Hare. It is just that justice makes its bearer strong, which gives us a reason to cultivate it in ourselves and our loved ones by keeping to the corresponding actions. So Foot must face the threat posed by Nietzsche and the Platonic immoralists: perhaps the received ostensible virtues in fact warp or damage the bearer. She suggests that modern and contemporary philosophers (other than Nietzsche) fear to pose this range of questions because they are blinded by an emphasis on a \\"particular just act\\" or a particular courageous act, rather than the traits that issue from them, and it seems that an agent might come out the loser by such act. The underlying putative virtue is the object to consider. =\\"Why be moral?\\" ‚Äì middle work= Fifteen years later, in the essay \\"Morality as a System of Hypothetical Imperatives\\", she reversed this when it came to justice and benevolence, that is, the virtues that especially regard other people. Although everyone has reason to cultivate courage, temperance and prudence, whatever the person desires or values, still, the rationality of just and benevolent acts must, she thought, turn on contingent motivations. Although many found the thesis shocking, on her (then) account, it is meant to be, in a certain respect, inspiring: in a famous reinterpretation of a remark of Kant,Critique of Practical Reason, Book 1, Chapter 3, \\"[W]e pretend with fanciful pride to set ourselves above the thought of duty, like volunteers.... [B]ut yet we are subjects in it, not the sovereign,\\" she says that \\"we are not conscripts in the army of virtue, but volunteers\\";Virtues and Vices, p. 170. the fact that we have nothing to say in proof of the irrationality of at least some unjust people should not alarm us in our own defense and cultivation of justice and benevolence: \\"it did not strike the citizens of Leningrad that their devotion to the city and its people during the terrible years of the siege was contingent\\". =\\"Why moral?\\" ‚Äì later work= Foot's book Natural Goodness attempts a different line. The question what we have most reason to do ties into the idea of the good working of practical reason. This in turn is tied to the idea of the species of an animal providing a measure of good and bad in the operations of its parts and faculties. Just as one has to know what kind of animal is meant, for instance to decide whether its eyesight is good or bad, the question of whether a subject's practical reason is well developed depends on the kind of animal it is. This idea is developed in the light of a concept of animal kinds or species as implicitly containing \\"evaluative\\" content, which may be criticized on contemporary biological grounds, although it is arguable even on that basis that it is deeply entrenched in human cognition. In this case, what makes for a well-constituted practical reason depends on us being human beings marked by certain possibilities of emotion and desire, a certain anatomy, neurological organization, and so forth. Once this step is taken, it becomes possible to argue in a new way for the rationality of moral considerations. Humans begin with the conviction that justice is a genuine virtue. So a conviction that well-constituted human practical reason operates with considerations of justice means that taking account of other people in that sort of way is \\"how human beings live together.\\" (The thought that this is how they live must be understood in a sense compatible with the fact that actual individuals often do not ‚Äì just as dentists understand the thought that \\"human beings have n teeth\\" in a way that is compatible with many people having fewer). There is nothing incoherent in the thought that practical calculation that takes account of others and their good might characterize some kind of rational and social animal. Similarly, there is nothing incoherent in the idea of a form of rational life within which such considerations are alien, where they can only be imposed by damaging and disturbing the individual. There is nothing analytical about the rationality of justice and benevolence. Human conviction that justice is a virtue and considerations of justice are genuine reasons for action assumes that the kind of rational being we are, namely human beings, is of the first type. There is no reason to think such a rational animality is impossible, and so none to suspect that considerations of justice are frauds. Of course, it might be suggested that this is precisely not the case, that human beings are of the second kind, and thus that the justice and benevolence we esteem are artificial and false. Foot would hold that considerations of machismo and lady-likeness are artificial and false; they are matters of \\"mere convention,\\" which tend to put one off of the main things. That being how it is with justice, was the position of the Platonic \\"immoralists\\" Callicles and Thrasymachus, and that being how it is with benevolence, was the view of Friedrich Nietzsche. With Callicles and Nietzsche, this is apparently to be shown by claiming that justice and benevolence respectively can be inculcated only by warping the emotional apparatus of the individual. Foot's book ends by attempting to defuse the evidence Nietzsche brings against what might be called the common-sense position. She proceeds by accepting his basic premise that a way of life inculcated by damaging the individual's passions, filling one with remorse, resentment and so forth, is not true. She employs exactly the Nietzschean form of argument against some forms of femininity, for example, or exaggerated forms of etiquette acceptance. However, she claims that justice and benevolence \\"suit\\" human beings and there is no reason to accept the critique of Callicles or Nietzsche in this case. Ethics, aesthetics and political philosophy Nearly all Foot's published work relates to normative or meta-ethics. Only once did she move into aesthetics ‚Äì in her 1970 British Academy Hertz Memorial Lecture, Art and Morality, in which certain contrasts are drawn between moral and aesthetic judgements. Likewise she appears never to have taken a professional interest in political philosophy. Geoffrey Thomas of Birkbeck College, London, recalls approaching Foot in 1968, when he was a postgraduate at Trinity College, Oxford, to ask if she would read a draft paper on the relation of ethics to politics. \\"I've never found political philosophy interesting,\\" she said, adding, \\"One's bound to interest oneself in the things people around one are talking about,\\" so implying correctly political philosophy was largely out of favour with Oxford philosophers in the 1950s and 1960s. She still graciously agreed to read the paper, but Thomas never sent it .J. Hacker-Wright, Philippa Foot's Moral Thought (London: Bloomsbury Publishing, 2013), pp. 31‚Äì58.

His theoretical modeling was not immediately accepted by the astronomical community. In fact, when he submitted the results to The Astrophysical Journal, two reviewers rejected it. The editor of the Astrophysical Journal, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, overruled the reviewers and published the paper. His models were resoundingly verified by satellite observations a few years later, especially the 1962 Mariner 2 mission. His work has greatly increased understanding of the solar corona, the solar wind, the magnetic fields of both the Earth and the Sun, and their complex electromagnetic interactions. His books, especially his 1979 Cosmical Magnetic Fields, have been read by generations of investigators. His most recent book includes the effects of magnetic fields of planets, stars, and galaxies on X-ray emissions.

To the right (yellow) is the long tail; to the left (green) are the few that dominate. In this example, the cutoff is chosen so that areas of both regions are equal. In statistics and business, a long tail of some distributions of numbers is the portion of the distribution having many occurrences far from the \\"head\\" or central part of the distribution. The distribution could involve popularities, random numbers of occurrences of events with various probabilities, etc. The term is often used loosely, with no definition or arbitrary definition, but precise definitions are possible. In statistics, the term long-tailed distribution has a narrow technical meaning, and is a subtype of heavy-tailed distribution.Levine, David M.; Stephan, David; Krehbiel, Timothy C.; Berenson, Mark L. Statistics for Managers using Microsoft Excel. 3rd edition. Prentice Hall, 2002, p. 124. Intuitively, a distribution is (right) long-tailed if, for any fixed amount, when a quantity exceeds a high level, it almost certainly exceeds it by at least that amount: large quantities are probably even larger. Note that there is no sense of the \\"long tail\\" of a distribution, but only the property of a distribution being long-tailed. In business, the term long tail is applied to rank-size distributions or rank-frequency distributions (primarily of popularity), which often form power laws and are thus long- tailed distributions in the statistical sense. This is used to describe the retailing strategy of selling many unique items with relatively small quantities sold of each (the \\"long tail\\")‚Äîusually in addition to selling fewer popular items in large quantities (the \\"head\\"). Sometimes an intermediate category is also included, variously called the body, belly, torso, or middle. The specific cutoff of what part of a distribution is the \\"long tail\\" is often arbitrary, but in some cases may be specified objectively; see segmentation of rank-size distributions. The long tail concept has found some ground for application, research, and experimentation. It is a term used in online business, mass media, micro-finance (Grameen Bank, for example), user-driven innovation (Eric von Hippel), knowledge management, and social network mechanisms (e.g. crowdsourcing, crowdcasting, peer-to-peer), economic models, marketing (viral marketing), and IT Security threat hunting within a SOC (Information security operations center). History Frequency distributions with long tails have been studied by statisticians since at least 1946.A search for the phrase \\"long tail\\" in the database MathSciNet yielded 81 hits, the earliest being a 1946 paper by Brown and Tukey in the Annals of Mathematical Statistics (volume 17, pages 1‚Äì12). The term has also been used in the financeBessis, J√∂el \\"Risk Management in Banking\\". Wiley, 1995 and insurance business for many years. The work of Beno√Æt Mandelbrot in the 1950s and later has led to him being referred to as \\"the father of long tails\\".Obrist, Hans Ulrich \\"The Father of Long Tails. An interview with Beno√Æt Mandelbrot\\", Edge.org, 2008 The long tail was popularized by Chris Anderson in an October 2004 Wired magazine article, in which he mentioned Amazon.com, Apple and Yahoo! as examples of businesses applying this strategy.Anderson, Chris. \\"The Long Tail\\" Wired, October 2004. Anderson elaborated the concept in his book The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business Is Selling Less of More. Business The distribution and inventory costs of businesses successfully applying a long tail strategy allow them to realize significant profit out of selling small volumes of hard-to-find items to many customers instead of only selling large volumes of a reduced number of popular items. The total sales of this large number of \\"non-hit items\\" is called \\"the long tail\\". Given enough choice, a large population of customers, and negligible stocking and distribution costs, the selection and buying pattern of the population results in the demand across products having a power law distribution or Pareto distribution. It is important to understand why some distributions are normal vs. long tail (power) distributions. Chris Anderson argues that while quantities such as human height or IQ follow a normal distribution, in scale- free networks with preferential attachments, power law distributions are created, i.e. because some nodes are more connected than others (like Malcolm Gladwell‚Äôs ‚Äúmavens‚Äù in The Tipping Point).Carr, Nichloas \\"The shape of the tail.\\", roughtype.com, 2006 Statistical meaning The tail becomes bigger and longer in new markets (depicted in red). In other words, whereas traditional retailers have focused on the area to the left of the chart, online bookstores derive more sales from the area to the right. The long tail is the name for a long-known feature of some statistical distributions (such as Zipf, power laws, Pareto distributions and general L√©vy distributions). In \\"long-tailed\\" distributions a high-frequency or high-amplitude population is followed by a low-frequency or low-amplitude population which gradually \\"tails off\\" asymptotically. The events at the far end of the tail have a very low probability of occurrence. As a rule of thumb, for such population distributions the majority of occurrences (more than half, and where the Pareto principle applies, 80%) are accounted for by the first 20% of items in the distribution. What is unusual about a long-tailed distribution is that the most frequently occurring 20% of items represent less than 50% of occurrences; or in other words, the least frequently occurring 80% of items are more important as a proportion of the total population. Power law distributions or functions characterize an important number of behaviors from nature and human endeavor. This fact has given rise to a keen scientific and social interest in such distributions, and the relationships that create them. The observation of such a distribution often points to specific kinds of mechanisms, and can often indicate a deep connection with other, seemingly unrelated systems. Examples of behaviors that exhibit long-tailed distribution are the occurrence of certain words in a given language, the income distribution of a business or the intensity of earthquakes (see: Gutenberg‚ÄìRichter law). Chris Anderson's and Clay Shirky's articles highlight special cases in which we are able to modify the underlying relationships and evaluate the impact on the frequency of events. In those cases the infrequent, low-amplitude (or low-revenue) events ‚Äì the long tail, represented here by the portion of the curve to the right of the 20th percentile ‚Äì can become the largest area under the line. This suggests that a variation of one mechanism (internet access) or relationship (the cost of storage) can significantly shift the frequency of occurrence of certain events in the distribution. The shift has a crucial effect in probability and in the customer demographics of businesses like mass media and online sellers. However, the long tails characterizing distributions such as the Gutenberg‚ÄìRichter law or the words-occurrence Zipf's law, and those highlighted by Anderson and Shirky are of very different, if not opposite, nature: Anderson and Shirky refer to frequency-rank relations, whereas the Gutenberg‚ÄìRichter law and the Zipf's law are probability distributions. Therefore, in these latter cases \\"tails\\" correspond to large- intensity events such as large earthquakes and most popular words, who dominate the distributions. By contrast, the long tails in the frequency-rank plots highlighted by Anderson and Shirky would rather correspond to short tails in the associated probability distributions, and therefore illustrate an opposite phenomenon compared to the Gutenberg‚ÄìRichter and the Zipf's laws. Chris Anderson and Clay Shirky Use of the phrase the long tail in business as \\"the notion of looking at the tail itself as a new market\\" of consumers was first coined by Chris Anderson.See The origins of \\"The Long Tail\\" The concept drew in part from a February 2003 essay by Clay Shirky, \\"Power Laws, Weblogs and Inequality\\",\\"Power Laws, Weblogs and Inequality\\" , by Clay Shirky. February 8, 2003. which noted that a relative handful of weblogs have many links going into them but \\"the long tail\\" of millions of weblogs may have only a handful of links going into them. Anderson described the effects of the long tail on current and future business models beginning with a series of speeches in early 2004 and with the publication of a Wired magazine article in October 2004. Anderson later extended it into the book The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business is Selling Less of More (2006). Anderson argues that products in low demand or that have a low sales volume can collectively make up a market share that rivals or exceeds the relatively few current bestsellers and blockbusters, if the store or distribution channel is large enough. Anderson cites earlier research by Erik Brynjolfsson, Yu (Jeffrey) Hu, and Michael D. Smith, that showed that a significant portion of Amazon.com's sales come from obscure books that are not available in brick-and-mortar stores. The long tail is a potential market and, as the examples illustrate, the distribution and sales channel opportunities created by the Internet often enable businesses to tap that market successfully. In his Wired article Anderson opens with an anecdote about creating a niche market for books on Amazon. He writes about a book titled Touching the Void about a near-death mountain climbing accident that took place in the Peruvian Andes. Anderson states the book got good reviews, but didn't have much commercial success. However, ten years later a book titled Into Thin Air by Jon Krakauer was published and Touching the Void began to sell again. Anderson realized that this was due to Amazon's recommendations. This created a niche market for those who enjoy books about mountain climbing even though it is not considered a popular genre supporting the long tail theory. An Amazon employee described the long tail as follows: \\"We sold more books today that didn't sell at all yesterday than we sold today of all the books that did sell yesterday.\\"The Long Tail: Definitions: Final Round!, comment #3 by Josh Petersen. Anderson has explained the term as a reference to the tail of a demand curve. The term has since been rederived from an XY graph that is created when charting popularity to inventory. In the graph shown above, Amazon's book sales would be represented along the vertical axis, while the book or movie ranks are along the horizontal axis. The total volume of low popularity items exceeds the volume of high popularity items. Academic research =Effects of online access= In his Wired article, Chris Anderson cites earlier research by Erik Brynjolfsson, Yu (Jeffrey) Hu, and Michael D. Smith, who first used a log-linear curve on an XY graph to describe the relationship between Amazon.com sales and sales ranking. They found that a large proportion of Amazon.com's book sales come from obscure books that were not available in brick-and-mortar stores. They then quantified the potential value of the long tail to consumers. In an article published in 2003, these authors showed that, while most of the discussion about the value of the Internet to consumers has revolved around lower prices, consumer benefit (a.k.a. consumer surplus) from access to increased product variety in online book stores is ten times larger than their benefit from access to lower prices online. Thus, the primary value of the internet to consumers comes from releasing new sources of value by providing access to products in the long tail.Brynjolfsson, Erik; Yu (Jeffrey) Hu, and Michael D. Smith, \\"Consumer Surplus in the Digital Economy: Estimating the Value of Increased Product Variety at Online Booksellers\\", Management Science, 49 (11), November 2003. working paper version, April 2003 =The longer tail over time= A study by Erik Brynjolfsson, Yu (Jeffrey) Hu, and Michael D. SmithBynjolfsson, Erik; Yu (Jeffrey) Hu, and Michael D. Smith, 2010, \\"The Longer Tail: The Changing Shape of Amazon‚Äôs Sales Distribution Curve\\" finds that the long tail has grown longer over time, with niche books accounting for a larger share of total sales. Their analyses suggested that by 2008, niche books accounted for 36.7% of Amazon's sales while the consumer surplus generated by niche books has increased at least fivefold from 2000 to 2008. In addition, their new methodology finds that, while the widely used power laws are a good first approximation for the rank-sales relationship, the slope may not be constant for all book ranks, with the slope becoming progressively steeper for more obscure books. In support of their findings, Wenqi Zhou and Wenjing Duan not only find a longer tail but also a fatter tail by an in-depth analysis on consumer software downloading pattern in their paper \\"Online user reviews, product variety, and the long tail\\". The demand for all products decreases, but the decrease for the hits is more pronounced, indicating the demand shifting from the hits to the niches over time. In addition, they also observe a superstar effect in the presence of the long tail. A small number of very popular products still dominates the demand. =Goodbye Pareto principle, welcome the new distribution= In a 2006 working paper titled \\"Goodbye Pareto Principle, Hello Long Tail\\",Brynjolfsson, Erik; Yu (Jeffrey) Hu, and Duncan Simester, 2006, \\"Goodbye Pareto Principle, Hello Long Tail: The Effect of Search Costs on the Concentration of Product Sales\\" Erik Brynjolfsson, Yu (Jeffrey) Hu, and Duncan Simester found that, by greatly lowering search costs, information technology in general and Internet markets in particular could substantially increase the collective share of hard-to-find products, thereby creating a longer tail in the distribution of sales. They used a theoretical model to show how a reduction in search costs will affect the concentration in product sales. By analyzing data collected from a multi- channel retailing company, they showed empirical evidence that the Internet channel exhibits a significantly less concentrated sales distribution, when compared with traditional channels. An 80/20 rule fits the distribution of product sales in the catalog channel quite well, but in the Internet channel, this rule needs to be modified to a 72/28 rule in order to fit the distribution of product sales in that channel. The difference in the sales distribution is highly significant, even after controlling for consumer differences. =Demand-side and supply-side drivers= The key supply-side factor that determines whether a sales distribution has a long tail is the cost of inventory storage and distribution. Where inventory storage and distribution costs are insignificant, it becomes economically viable to sell relatively unpopular products; however, when storage and distribution costs are high, only the most popular products can be sold. For example, a traditional movie rental store has limited shelf space, which it pays for in the form of building overhead; to maximize its profits, it must stock only the most popular movies to ensure that no shelf space is wasted. Because online video rental provider (such as Amazon.com or Netflix) stocks movies in centralized warehouses, its storage costs are far lower and its distribution costs are the same for a popular or unpopular movie. It is therefore able to build a viable business stocking a far wider range of movies than a traditional movie rental store. Those economics of storage and distribution then enable the advantageous use of the long tail: for example, Netflix finds that in aggregate, \\"unpopular\\" movies are rented more than popular movies. An MIT Sloan Management Review article titled \\"From Niches to Riches: Anatomy of the Long Tail\\" examined the long tail from both the supply side and the demand side and identifies several key drivers. On the supply side, the authors point out how e-tailers' expanded, centralized warehousing allows for more offerings, thus making it possible for them to cater to more varied tastes.Anderson, Chirs. The Rise and Fall of the Hit. Wired. On the demand side, tools such as search engines, recommendation software, and sampling tools are allowing customers to find products outside their geographic area. The authors also look toward the future to discuss second-order, amplified effects of Long Tail, including the growth of markets serving smaller niches. Not all recommender systems are equal, however, when it comes to expanding the long tail. Some recommenders (i.e. certain collaborative filters) can exhibit a bias toward popular products, creating positive feedback, and actually reduce the long tail. A Wharton study details this phenomenon along with several ideas that may promote the long tail and greater diversity. A recent study conducted by Wenqi Zhou and Wenjing DuanZhou, W., and Duan, W. Online user reviews, product variety and the long tail: An empirical investigation on online software downloads. Electron. Comm. Res. Appl. (2011) available at SSRN further points out that the demand side factor (online user reviews) and the supply side factor (product variety) interplay to influence the long tail formation of user choices. Consumers' reliance on online user reviews to choose products is significantly influenced by the quantity of products available. Specifically, they find that the impacts of both positive and negative user reviews are weakened as product variety goes up. In addition, the increase in product variety reduces the impact of user reviews on popular products more than it does on niche products. =Networks, crowds, and the long tail= The \\"crowds\\" of customers, users and small companies that inhabit the long-tail distribution can perform collaborative and assignment work. Some relevant forms of these new production models are: * The peer-to-peer collaboration groups that produce open-source software or create wikis such as Wikipedia. * The crowdsourcing model, in which a company outsources work to a large group of market players using a collaborative online platform. * The model of crowdcasting, is the process of building a network of users and then delivering challenges or tasks to be solved with the purpose of gaining insights or innovative ideas. * Work performed by individuals in commons-like, non-market networks, described in the work of Yochai Benkler. The demand-side factors that lead to the long tail can be amplified by the \\"networks of products\\" which are created by hyperlinked recommendations across products. An MIS Quarterly article by Gal Oestreicher-Singer and Arun Sundararajan shows that categories of books on Amazon.com which are more central and thus influenced more by their recommendation network have significantly more pronounced long-tail distributions. Their data across 200 subject areas shows that a doubling of this influence leads to a 50% increase in revenues from the least popular one-fifth of books. =Turnover within the long tail= The long-tail distribution applies at a given point in time, but over time the relative popularity of the sales of the individual products will change. Although the distribution of sales may appear to be similar over time, the positions of the individual items within it will vary. For example, new items constantly enter most fashion markets. A recent fashion-based model of consumer choice, which is capable of generating power law distributions of sales similar to those observed in practice, takes into account turnover in the relative sales of a given set of items, as well as innovation, in the sense that entirely new items become offered for sale. There may be an optimal inventory size, given the balance between sales and the cost of keeping up with the turnover. An analysis based on this pure fashion model\\"Shelf space strategy in long tail markets\\" by R.A. Bentley, P. Ormerod and M.E. Madsen, arXive indicates that, even for digital retailers, the optimal inventory may in many cases be less than the millions of items that they can potentially offer. In other words, by proceeding further and further into the long tail, sales may become so small that the marginal cost of tracking them in rank order, even at a digital scale, might be optimised well before a million titles, and certainly before infinite titles. This model can provide further predictions into markets with long-tail distribution, such as the basis for a model for optimizing the number of each individual item ordered, given its current sales rank and the total number of different titles stocked. Business models =Competitive impact= Before a long tail works, only the most popular products are generally offered. When the cost of inventory storage and distribution fall, a wide range of products become available. This can, in turn, have the effect of reducing demand for the most popular products. For example, a small website that focuses on niches of content can be threatened by a larger website which has a variety of information (such as Yahoo) Web content. The big website covers more variety while the small website has only a few niches to choose from. The competitive threat from these niche sites is reduced by the cost of establishing and maintaining them and the effort required for readers to track multiple small web sites. These factors have been transformed by easy and cheap web site software and the spread of RSS. Similarly, mass-market distributors like Blockbuster may be threatened by distributors like LoveFilm, which supply the titles that Blockbuster doesn't offer because they are not already very popular. =Internet companies= Some of the most successful Internet businesses have used the long tail as part of their business strategy. Examples include eBay (auctions), Yahoo! and Google (web search), Amazon (retail), and iTunes Store (music and podcasts), amongst the major companies, along with smaller Internet companies like Audible (audio books) and LoveFilm (video rental). These purely digital retailers also have almost no marginal cost, which is benefiting the online services, unlike physical retailers that have fixed limits on their products. The internet can still sell physical goods, but at an unlimited selection and with reviews and recommendations.Anderson, Chris (December 13, 2004)\\"The Long Tail\\" issue 10.01. The internet has opened up larger territories to sell and provide its products without being confined to just the \\"local Markets\\" such as physical retailers like Target or even Walmart. With the digital and hybrid retailers there is no longer a perimeter on market demands.McDonald, Scott. \\"Journal of Advertising Research\\" (Sep 2008) Vol. 48 Issue 3, pp 313‚Äì319, 7 p, 2 graphs =Video and multiplayer online games= The adoption of video games and massively multiplayer online games such as Second Life as tools for education and training is starting to show a long- tailed pattern. It costs significantly less to modify a game than it has been to create unique training applications, such as those for training in business, commercial flight, and military missions. This has led some to envision a time in which game-based training devices or simulations will be available for thousands of different job descriptions. =Microfinance and microcredit= The banking business has used internet technology to reach an increasing number of customers. The most important shift in business model due to the long tail has come from the various forms of microfinance developed. As opposed to e-tailers, micro-finance is a distinctly low technology business. Its aim is to offer very small credits to lower-middle to lower class and poor people, that would otherwise be ignored by the traditional banking business. The banks that have followed this strategy of selling services to the low- frequency long tail of the sector have found out that it can be an important niche, long ignored by consumer banks. The recipients of small credits tend to be very good payers of loans, despite their non-existent credit history. They are also willing to pay higher interest rates than the standard bank or credit card customer. It also is a business model that fills an important developmental role in an economy. Grameen Bank in Bangladesh has successfully followed this business model. In Mexico the banks Compartamos and Banco Azteca also service this customer demographic, with an emphasis on consumer credit. Kiva.org is an organization that provides micro credits to people worldwide, by using intermediaries called small microfinance organizations (S.M.O.'s)to distribute crowd sourced donations made by Kiva.org lenders. =User-driven innovation= According to the user-driven innovation model, companies can rely on users of their products and services to do a significant part of the innovation work. Users want products that are customized to their needs. They are willing to tell the manufacturer what they really want and how it should work. Companies can make use of a series of tools, such as interactive and internet based technologies, to give their users a voice and to enable them to do innovation work that is useful to the company. Given the diminishing cost of communication and information sharing (by analogy to the low cost of storage and distribution, in the case of e-tailers), long-tailed user driven innovation will gain importance for businesses. In following a long-tailed innovation strategy, the company is using the model to tap into a large group of users that are in the low-intensity area of the distribution. It is their collaboration and aggregated work that results in an innovation effort. Social innovation communities formed by groups of users can perform rapidly the trial and error process of innovation, share information, test and diffuse the results. Eric von Hippel of MIT's Sloan School of Management defined the user- led innovation model in his book Democratizing Innovation. Among his conclusions is the insight that as innovation becomes more user-centered the information needs to flow freely, in a more democratic way, creating a \\"rich intellectual commons\\" and \\"attacking a major structure of the social division of labor\\". =Marketing= The drive to build a market and obtain revenue from the consumer demographic of the long tail has led businesses to implement a series of long-tail marketing techniques, most of them based on extensive use of internet technologies. Among the most representative are: * New media marketing: The building and managing of social networks and online or virtual communities to extend the reach of marketing to the low-frequency, low- intensity consumer in a cost-effective way, often through blogs, RSS feeds and podcasts. * Buzz marketing: The strategic use of word of mouth and transmission of commercial information from person to person in an online or real-world environment. * Viral marketing: The intentional spreading of marketing messages using preexisting social networks, with an emphasis on the casual, non-intentional and low cost, commonly through YouTube videos, viral emails and standalone microsites. * Pay per click and search engine optimization: The marketing of websites on search engines such as Google, Yahoo and Bing by focusing on long-tail keywords which have less competition. * Demand-side platforms/DSPs: Similar to how search engine marketing monetizes the long tail of keywords, auction-oriented buying/selling mechanisms are also viable to help monetize the long tail of ad impressions available across niche publishers in the display advertising realm. Publishers utilize these ad exchange environments, such as Right Media or AdECN, to efficiently sell display inventory that might otherwise go unsold through direct sales force operations. As a result, by January 2011 between 20‚Äì25% of all US ad spending was derived from long tail advertisers. Cultural and political impact The long tail has possible implications for culture and politics. Where the opportunity cost of inventory storage and distribution is high, only the most popular products are sold. But where the long tail works, minority tastes become available and individuals are presented with a wider array of choices. The long tail presents opportunities for various suppliers to introduce products in the niche category. These encourage the diversification of products. These niche products open opportunities for suppliers while concomitantly satisfying the demands of many individuals ‚Äì therefore lengthening the tail portion of the long tail. In situations where popularity is currently determined by the lowest common denominator, a long-tail model may lead to improvement in a society's level of culture. The opportunities that arise because of the long tail greatly affect society's cultures because suppliers have unlimited capabilities due to infinite storage and demands that were unable to be met prior to the long tail are realized. At the end of the long tail, the conventional profit-making business model ceases to exist; instead, people tend to come up with products for varied reasons like expression rather than monetary benefit. In this way, the long tail opens up a large space for authentic works of creativity. =Cultural diversity= Television is a good example of this: Chris Anderson defines long-tail TV in the context of \\"content that is not available through traditional distribution channels but could nevertheless find an audience.\\"Chris Anderson. The Long Tail TV: Conclusion. The Long Tail Blog. January 17, 2005. Thus, the advent of services such as television on demand, pay-per-view and even premium cable subscription services such as HBO and Showtime open up the opportunity for niche content to reach the right audiences, in an otherwise mass medium. These may not always attract the highest level of viewership, but their business distribution models make that of less importance. As the opportunity cost goes down, the choice of TV programs grows and greater cultural diversity rises. =Distribution of independent content= Often presented as a phenomenon of interest primarily to mass market retailers and web-based businesses, the long tail also has implications for the producers of content, especially those whose products could not ‚Äì for economic reasons ‚Äì find a place in pre-Internet information distribution channels controlled by book publishers, record companies, movie studios, and television networks. Looked at from the producers' side, the long tail has made possible a flowering of creativity across all fields of human endeavour. One example of this is YouTube, where thousands of diverse videos ‚Äì whose content, production value or lack of popularity make them inappropriate for traditional television ‚Äì are easily accessible to a wide range of viewers. =Contemporary literature= The intersection of viral marketing, online communities and new technologies that operate within the long tail of consumers and business is described in the novel by William Gibson, Pattern Recognition. =Military applications and security= In military thinking, John Robb applies the long tail to the developments in insurgency and terrorist movements, showing how technology and networking allows the long tail of disgruntled groups and criminals to take on the nation state and have a chance to win. Criticisms A 2008 study by Anita Elberse, professor of business administration at Harvard Business School, calls the long tail theory into question, citing sales data which shows that the Web magnifies the importance of blockbuster hits. On his blog, Chris Anderson responded to the study, praising Elberse and the academic rigor with which she explores the issue but drawing a distinction between their respective interpretations of where the \\"head\\" and \\"tail\\" begin. Elberse defined head and tail using percentages, while Anderson uses absolute numbers. Similar results were published by Serguei Netessine and Tom F. Tan, who suggest that head and tail should be defined by percentages rather than absolute numbers. Also in 2008, a sales analysis of an unnamed UK digital music service by economist Will Page and high-tech entrepreneur Andrew Bud found that sales exhibited a log-normal distribution rather than a power law; they reported that 80% of the music tracks available sold no copies at all over a one-year period. Anderson responded by stating that the study's findings are difficult to assess without access to its data.

BU Law was one of the first law schools in the country to admit students regardless of race or gender. It is the second-oldest law school in Massachusetts, and a charter member of the American Bar Association. More than 700 students are enrolled in the full-time J.D. degree program and about 350 in the school's five LLM degree programs. History The Boston University School of Law was founded in 1872. It was one of the first law schools to admit women and minorities, at a time when most other law schools barred them. In 1881, Lelia Robinson became the first female BU Law graduate. Then, women lawyers were less than half of one percent of the profession. Upon graduation, she successfully lobbied the Massachusetts legislature to permit the admission of women to the state bar, and in 1882, became the first woman admitted to the Massachusetts bar. Her classmate, Nathan Abbott, would later become the founding dean of Stanford Law School. Another prominent female alumna at the time, Alice Stone Blackwell, would go on to help found the League of Women Voters and edit the Woman's Journal. Takeo Kikuchi (1877), the school's first Japanese graduate, was co- founder and president of Tokyo's English Law School which grew into Chuo University. Clara Burrill Bruce (1926) was the first black woman elected editor-in-chief of a law review (the Boston University Law Review). BU Law's first homes were 36 Bromfield Street, 18‚Äì20 Beacon Street and 10 Ashburton Place. In 1895, the university's trustees acquired 11 Ashburton Place, which was refurbished and named Isaac Rich Hall in honor of the third founder of Boston University. The dedication speaker was Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. whose historic speech The Path of the Law was delivered in 1897. Former United States President William Howard Taft lectured on legal ethics from 1918 until his appointment as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in 1921. Isaac Rich Hall housed BU Law until 1964. In 1964 BU Law occupied the bottom half of the current building, 765 Commonwealth Avenue on the Charles River Campus, colloquially known as the \\"Tower.\\" BU Law shared the Tower with the School of Education for some years but now occupies the entire building. The School of Law's legal library, the Fineman & Pappas Law Libraries, occupies three floors in the Law Complex, spanning both the Law Tower and the Redstone Building. The Libraries also include two floors of closed stacks in the basement of the adjacent Mugar Memorial Library, BU's main library. In July 2016, the United States Department of Health and Human Services announced a new partnership allowing BU Law to serve as headquarters for a $350 million initiative researching and combating antibiotic-resistant diseases. Professor Kevin Outterson, a health law specialist and researcher at BU Law, serves as executive director of the initiative, which is named CARB-X. Academics BU Law Tower Boston University School of Law offers a broad selection of legal classes and seminars (approximately 200) with a student to faculty ratio of 12:1. It offers the J.D. and Master of Laws (LL.M.) degrees as well as numerous dual degrees. =Admissions= BU Law's most recent entering class comes from 39 states and the District of Columbia. These students represent 16 countries and 155 undergraduate institutions.Class Profile  School of Law Admission to Boston University School of Law is very competitive. There were 284 students who matriculated in the fall of 2018 out of a pool of 5,891 J.D. applicants. The 25th and 75th LSAT percentiles for the 2018 entering class were 160 and 167, respectively. The 25th and 75th undergraduate GPA percentiles were 3.49 and 3.84, respectively, with a median of 3.74. =Rankings= Boston University School of Law ranks 20th among American law schools in the 2021 list of best law schools compiled by U.S. News & World Report.Best Law School Rankings  Law Program Rankings  US News U.S. News also ranks the School's Health Law Program #4 and Tax Law #7. =Attorney Skills Accelerator Program= The Attorney Skills Accelerator Program (ASAP) at Boston University School of Law offers summer classes, clinics, and externships for qualified J.D. students enrolled in accredited law schools. During Summer 2017, ASAP students will be able to enroll in Contract Drafting and/or Negotiation courses. ASAP students will also have the opportunity to take part in a legal externship, or one of three clinics: * Entrepreneurship & IP Clinic * Legislative Policy & Drafting Clinic * Criminal Law: Prosecutor Clinic Law journals * Boston University Law Review * American Journal of Law & Medicine * Review of Banking & Financial Law * Boston University International Law Journal * Journal of Science & Technology Law * Public Interest Law Journal Costs The total cost of attendance (indicating the cost of tuition, fees, and living expenses) at BU Law for the 2017‚Äì18 academic year was $74,689. The Law School Transparency estimated debt-financed cost of attendance for three years is $243,230.  Employment  According to BU Law's official 2017 ABA-required disclosures, 78.8% of the Class of 2017 obtained full-time, long-term, JD-required employment ten months after graduation.

It won the 1978 Governor General's Award for English Fiction, her second win of that prize. Outside of Canada, the book was published as The Beggar Maid. Under that title, it was also nominated for the Booker Prize in 1980. The collection of short stories revolves around protagonist Rose. The collection has been labelled by some critics as a novel, as the same characters and similar themes recur throughout the book, but there is no formal cohesiveness in plot. Each story explores an idea, and is not bound by a particular time, place, setting, or narrative voice.

The short stories can be described as a bildungsroman. Rose grows up in a small town, abused by her father, and living in an impoverished home. In \\"Half a Grapefruit\\", she begins attending a school on the more affluent part of town. In class, when asked what she ate for breakfast, she lies and says \\"half a grapefruit\\" rather than revealing her mundane, considerably less glamorous meal. The lie haunts her, and she is embarrassed by her upbringing. Rose ends up winning a scholarship to attend university. On a train ride to Toronto, she is molested by a clergy man; she chooses to ignore this incident, but it has irreparable damage on her future relationships with men. At university she meets her husband who has a medieval perspective of women‚Äîhe is drawn to her because he sees her as a damsel in distress. Her marriage eventually ends, and she has to juggle being a mother, meeting other men, and her acting career. One of her significant relationships is with Simon, a charming man she meets at a friend's house. The two spend the weekend together, and she grows attached to him (she describes it as developing an understanding for Simon's many personas). He disappears unexpectedly afterwards. She later discovers that Simon has died. The final few short stories have her returning home; this gives her a chance to close the chapter of her life involving her complicated relationship with her stepmother Flo.

The bridge carries vehicle traffic of State Route 106 and State Route 156, and is owned by the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT). It is named after Benjamin Harrison V, a signer of the Declaration of Independence and a Governor of Virginia, who lived nearby at Berkeley Plantation. Originally completed in 1966, it was substantially rebuilt following a February 24, 1977 collision by a ship. Repairs took 20 months to complete. The cost of repairs and operations for an innovative passenger shuttle service contracted by the state were $9.7 million. The costs were recovered from the insurer for the shipping company following a lawsuit in U.S. District Court. Working in conjunction with the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, the Benjamin Harrison Bridge and its VDOT staff host a successful breeding program for peregrine falcons on its high towers.  History  The mile-long drawbridge replaced ferry service when it was completed in 1966 by Hardesty & Hanover L.L.P., a New York-based bridge engineering firm. It featured a vertical lift span to facilitate passage of shipping traffic on this portion of the James River, which is navigable from Hampton Roads upstream to the Port of Richmond, about west of the bridge.  Disaster in 1977  = Tanker ship crashes into bridge = On February 24, 1977, the Benjamin Harrison Memorial Bridge was the scene of a spectacular and costly accident. A small, ocean-going, WWII-surplus tanker ship, the 5,700 ton, 523-ft long , was eastbound, heading downriver from Allied Signal Corp. in Hopewell, Virginia. Once underway and only a short distance from the Benjamin Harrison Bridge, the steering gear that powers the ships rudder malfunctioned, and caused the ship to suddenly lose control and ability to maneuver. The bridge tender had placed the lift span in the \\"raised\\" position in anticipation of the ship's passage, and motorists were sitting in their vehicles behind the warning gates waiting. As the large ship veered off course to the north and blew warning blasts on its horn, the occupants of southbound vehicles waiting on the bridge saw the ship coming directly toward them, and managed to get out of their cars and run to safety before the ship rammed the bridge. As the ship departed the channel to the north, the crew blew the emergency signal of 6 blasts on the ship's horn, put the engine into reverse and dropped the starboard anchor to attempt to steer the ship back into the main channel, but it was too late to counteract the tons of momentum. The ship missed the opened, movable, portion of the bridge over the main channel, and struck part of the fixed span. One section of the concrete bridge deck adjacent the north tower and two unoccupied vehicles tumbled into the river. The vehicles included a Ford conversion van belonging to a person from the Virginia Beach area and a pickup truck belonging to a local plumbing company. The bridge structure of the north tower stopped the ship's forward movement when the lower part struck the deckhouse. The bridge tender, a state employee, was trapped in the control booth located on the raised lift span near the south end. Despite the considerable damage, there were no serious injuries or fatalities. Immediately after the collision, a tugboat, the Virginia B., raced downriver from Hopewell to the scene of the accident. A resident of the Jordan Point Yacht Haven launched a 19 foot runabout and with the help of a local rescue squad member began a search of the area for survivors. The US Coast Guard Strike Team 1 deployed Lt. Cmdr Chambers and an enlisted diver to the scene by helicopter. The diver operated off the resident's runabout for 3 days until their dive boat arrived on scene. = Post-collision actions = Representatives of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the United States Coast Guard, and Virginia Governor Mills E. Godwin Jr.'s Office of Emergency Services responded to the scene. Civil engineering contractors were summoned to assess damages and assist with planning repairs to the bridge. Local land and water transportation contractors were solicited to immediately develop proposals to provide alternate transportation for displaced motorists. According to official state records, the damage to the bridge entailed the \\"destruction of two spans north of the lift span, the north tower, the lift span, and serious damage to the south tower.\\" and \\"elimination of both highway and river traffic with immediate serious effect upon highway users and industries relying upon supplies by water\\" =Special arrangements to help displaced commuters= While river traffic was restored in relatively short order, the loss of the bridge as a highway artery caused substantial hardship to commuters and the communities on both sides of the river beginning immediately after the collision. Clearly, repairs would take quite some time before the bridge could reopen to highway traffic and would be costly. Prior to completion of the bridge in 1966, an automobile-carrying passenger ferry service had operated at this location, but the docks had rotted and silt had filled in the areas where the large ferryboats, if their service was to be restored, would need to dock. Due to a dredging restriction in place because of Kepone contamination, it was not feasible to restore the automobile- carrying ferry service, although a similar operation was still serving about downstream at the Jamestown Ferry. Alternative driving routes were unacceptably lengthy. The only fixed crossing downstream was the James River Bridge, which would require an additional drive. The nearest highway bridge upstream was located on Interstate 95 at Richmond, necessitating an additional driving distance of over . The existing Jamestown Ferry service about downstream between Scotland in Surry County and Glass House Point in James City County was already operating at capacity, with delays during peak commuting hours. Later on the day of the accident, state officials called upon local bus, taxicab, and water transportation providers, including both Greyhound Lines and Trailways, to offer potential solutions for the commuters. Virginia Governor Mills E. Godwin Jr.'s Office of Emergency Services identified an innovative solution, selecting a hybrid combination of land and water services of two local contractors to comprise a unique system for commuters. Richmond-based Virginia Overland Transportation (VOTC), which managed several of the state's older urban-suburban bus lines, was contracted to implement a shuttle bus and passenger van system on each side of the river. The land-based services were coordinated with a passenger ferry system contracted by VDOT from another company. The passenger ferry had small craft which could utilize the old ferry landings without dredging operations. Both services were to accommodate the individual schedules of commuting citizens impacted by the bridge closure. The contractors were given only 3 business days to have their emergency operations in place. The contractors met the state's deadline, and their service was in place three days later, essentially operating from dawn to dusk, with schedules adjusted to suit commuters as much as possible. Virginia Overland used two-way radio-equipped vans and school buses based on each side of the river to coordinate with the passenger ferries. Expanded parking was provided by VDOT at both docks. During this operation, commuters would drive to the ferry dock area on the side of their residence and literally \\"Park, Ride, and Ride.\\" The van and bus service on the south shore ran between the dock at Jordan's Point and various schools and places of employment, including many businesses in Prince George County, Hopewell and notably Fort Lee, a U.S. Army installation located in Prince George. In the opposite situation, some workers who lived on the south side of the river, parked and rode the ferry, and then vans or buses transported them to employment, mostly at Charles City County schools and other governmental agencies. By acting quickly, major disruptions to commuters and employers was primarily limited the initial few days. Since the state (and ultimately the ship's insurers) bore the expense of the passenger ferries and shuttle services, some commuters found budget savings in their commuting expenses as a meaningful offset to the inconvenience. Additionally, a light-duty car-float, which was essentially a barge guided by a tugboat, was later introduced which could transport a small number of automobiles and light trucks during favorable weather conditions to supplement the passenger ferry and shuttle bus/van arrangements, providing the commuters with a choice. However, the car- float, which rode quite close to the water, and resembled a raft, was considered somewhat unstable by some commuters, and the original \\"Park and Ride and Ride\\" services continued for 20 months until the bridge was reopened. =Reconstruction of the bridge= About 10 days after the initial collision, the damaged south tower which was supporting one end of the lift span (which had been askew with the north end down along with the north tower, and the south end still up) collapsed onto the ship. A total reconstruction of the lift portion of the bridge and several spans of the north approach was required. This was accomplished by McLean Contracting Company out of Baltimore Maryland, supervised by Bill Sinclair The reconstruction of the damaged bridge was to cost 9.5 million dollars and take 20 months to complete. One design change incorporated was relocation of the bridge tender's station to a fixed portion of the structure which did not go up and down with the lift span. Another major design flaw with the bridge was not fixed. Shortly before the accident Captains Ron Blaha (Blaha Towing Company) and Virginia Pilot Bobby Stone (Virginia Pilots Association) stated during an interview on local television news that because the drawbridge was located at a bend in the channel the traffic gates should be moved back away from the channel to prevent cars from falling into the river in the event that a ship was unable to make the turn and hit the fixed span. VDOT had previously been advised that the bridge was in such a position along the channel that this type of accident was possible. Following the accident, the news media picked up on the fact that Captains Stone and Blaha had previously warned that the traffic gates should be moved, however the traffic gates were never relocated by VDOT. =Fault, liability for damages= The NTSB issued a report, MAR-78-01, which was adopted on January 1, 1978. The investigation made recommendations for future prevention. The State of Virginia filed suit in U.S. District Court against the shipping company operating the Marine Floridian, which was found to be liable for the damages, a decision affirmed by the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals. The rebuilt Benjamin Harrison Memorial Bridge was reopened to traffic in the fall of 1978. The total cost of damages from the accident was $9.7 million.  Peregrine falcon program  Eastern Virginia has long been a habitat for once endangered birds, notably bald eagles and peregrine falcons. The Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) has come to learn that some of its high bridge structures closely match their preferred nesting environment on cliff faces and in high trees. In an award-winning program, nesting boxes for these rare birds were established in several bridges, including the Benjamin Harrison Memorial Bridge. Bridge pairs now represent approximately 30 percent of the Virginia peregrine falcon population. In a major victory for the endangered species, and VDOT's environmental efforts, in the spring of 2003, nearly a dozen peregrine falcon chicks were hatched. Most were taken from their nesting boxes on various VDOT bridges for banding and release. That spring, three chicks or \\"eyases\\" on the Benjamin Harrison Bridge on Route 156 over the James River were banded with a transmitter for tracking purposes, and two were released at Shenandoah National Park. Environmentalists like to leave one chick with its parents when possible, but the birds have a better chance of staying alive when released in the wild. One concern is that a falcon learning to fly may not survive a fall onto a bridge or even the water below. VDOT employees who work on the bridge can see the nesting box on top of the tower from where they work. They can see into the nest when they go up into the tower to work on the mechanisms used to open the drawbridge. The drawbridge is opened on demand sometimes three or four times a day, but some days not at all. The openings do not disturb the peregrine falcons. Bridge employees keep the Center for Conservation Biology at the College of William and Mary informed of the birds' movements. Peregrine falcons were listed as federally endangered in 1970 under the Endangered Species Conservation Act. At that time, there were virtually none in the east, and the population in the rest of the country had fallen by 80 to 90 percent. Beginning in the 1970s, a national effort was undertaken to recover breeding populations and to restore the species. Their population has significantly recovered over the past 30 years, thanks to conservation efforts such as VDOT's. Today, more than 1,500 breeding pairs have been counted in the U.S. and Canada. Along with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries and the Conservation Center, VDOT monitors the falcons on each bridge to ensure they and their habitat are doing well. VDOT has even established falcon-specific contract requirements for the Structure and Bridge Division as it continues to identify other nesting sites. Through placement of nesting boxes on 10 bridges maintained by VDOT, the endangered peregrine falcons - considered the world's fastest birds - once again fly high over Virginia's eastern seaboard. Because of the significant role it played in the recovery of the peregrine falcon in Virginia, VDOT earned the 1998 Federal Highway Administration Excellence Award in the category of Environment Protection and Enhancements.

He received a brochure from a music company advertising arrangements that would \\"give your band the sound of today.\\" He realized that the name fit perfectly and named the band the Sound of Today. What is now the Sound of Today began with 23 student musicians Sept. 21, 1932. E. Lowery Jefferson was their first director.

Burke, Joe Barry Mullins, B. Mack Hearne, Lowery Riggins, White and Steven Pederson. Mullins' and White's service as directors covers a total of more than 31 years. Dr. Derle Long was the director of the Sound of Today in the early-2000s. Jason Rhinehart became the director of athletic bands in 2007, and in 2016, Steven Pederson returned to direct the Sound of Today. In December 2012, The University of Louisiana at Monroe made their first Bowl Game appearance ever, in the Advocare Independence Bowl. The football team was supported at several events leading up to the Independence Bowl game by the Sound of Today. During the 1970s, the band grew to more than 300 members. Each year the Sound of Today produced an album of its \\"greatest hits\\", music from the half time shows of that football season. Unlike modern marching bands and corps, who develop one show and repeat it all season, the Sound of Today produced an entirely new halftime show for every home game in a season. The band was known for the quality of its music and for the precision of its drills. In the mid-1970s the band marched in 8-to-5 and used a knees-up bicycle step and mark time. With the uniform's white shoes, this produced flashy movements the crowds enjoyed. In subsequent years, the band moved to a corp-style step allowing for faster, more complex forms on the field. The excellence maintained by the program resulted in routine trips to play halftime shows for the New Orleans Saints in the Super Dome. These shows were recorded \\"live\\" on that year's album.

Music Balada's works from the early 1960s display some of the characteristics of Neoclassicism, but he was ultimately dissatisfied with this technique, and in 1966 began to move towards a more avant-garde style, producing works such as Guernica. Balada felt a need for a change again in 1975, his work from then onward being characterized by the combination of folk dance rhythms with the avant-garde techniques of the previous period. Harmonically, Balada's mature period work displays a combination of the tonality of folk music with atonality. Compositions representative of this period include Homage to Sarasate and Homage to Casals.

It is situated two and a half miles west of Durham, and a short distance to the north of Ushaw Moor. The name may be a corruption of the French term Beau Repaire ‚Äì meaning \\"beautiful retreat\\". Half a mile to the north of the present village lies the ruins of Beaurepaire Priory, built in 1258 by the Prior of Durham, Bertram de Middleton, as a retirement residence. The building was extended in the subsequent three centuries, becoming a retreat for the Durham monks in a similar way to the nearby Finchale Priory. The manor was largely destroyed by the Scots in 1640 and 1644 during the British Civil War. In 1872, Theodore Fry was involved in founding the Bearpark Coal and Coke Company, which established a coal mine in Bearpark until 1984, when the mine was closed. Bearpark Community Centre is at the hub of the local village, a red brick building originally built in 1921 as a miners' welfare hall. An old pit wheel stands in front of the building, a memorial to the village's mining history.

The church is part of the Convent of St. Mary Magdalene, a sisterhood established in 1936 by an English convert and working under the jurisdiction of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR). History =Construction= The church was built in 1886 by Tsar Alexander III and his brothers to honour their mother, Empress Maria Alexandrovna of Russia. It was constructed to David Grimm's design in the traditional tented roof style popular in 16th- and 17th-century Russia, and includes seven distinctive, gilded onion domes. =Dedication= The church is dedicated to Mary Magdalene, the companion of Jesus. According to the sixteenth chapter of the Gospel of Mark, Mary Magdalene was the first to see Christ after his resurrection (). Although equals, she is usually considered a crucial and important disciple of Jesus, and seemingly his primary female associate, along with Mary of Bethany, whom some believe to have been the same woman. =Burials= Saints Elisabeth and Varvara The relics of two martyred saints, Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna of Russia and her fellow nun Varvara Yakovleva, are displayed in the church.Portrait of a Duke, Tom Segev, Haaretz In 1982, the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia canonised the new martyrs of the communist revolution and in May the bodies of Elizabeth and Barbara (Varvara) were moved from the crypt, where only private veneration was possible, to the upper church of St. Mary Magdalene.

Sabitha's mother is dead, and her father, Ken Boudreau, lives elsewhere in poverty, frequently pleading with his father-in-law for money. Sabitha is friends with Edith, a shoe repairman's daughter who feels bored with her constricting blue-collar lifestyle. Edith devises a hoax in which she and Sabitha forge love letters from Sabitha's father to Johanna. Johanna, convinced by the letters that Ken will marry her, uses her substantial savings to travel to his remote location in rural Canada. She discovers that Ken has fallen ill, and, lovingly, she nurses him back to health. Having realized that Ken cannot control his own life, Johanna takes charge and arranges for them to start a new life. Ken, impressed by Johanna's resolve and by her savings, does not question her decisions. Several years later, Edith learns that Ken and Johanna have married and had a child.

She has received startling news, but her husband does not appear concerned. Instead, Neal flirts with Helen, the young woman whom they have hired to help around the house while Jinny undergoes chemotherapy. He insists that they pick up Helen's shoes from the home of her foster parents even though Jinny wants to return home immediately. Jinny refuses to leave the car when they arrive at the foster parents' trailer home, but Neal decides to join them for a meal. She thinks over what she learned from the doctor: her cancer, which she had assumed to be fatal, is receding. Eventually, the foster parents' teenage son Ricky approaches Jinny in the car.

Alfrida seems urbane and sophisticated to the young narrator, who views her with admiration. Once the narrator attends college, however, she distances herself from Alfrida and avoids her frequent dinner invitations. The narrator's only visit to Alfrida is marked by the narrator's condescension toward Alfrida's poverty and lack of cultivation. The dinner, however, does make one lasting impression. Alfrida recalls how her mother died of severe burns caused by an exploding lamp. She had wanted to see her mother but was denied by relatives; Alfrida responded by saying that her mother would have wanted to see her if their places were reversed. Later in life, the narrator transforms this incident into a short story that offends the elderly Alfrida.

The daughter tells the narrator that Alfrida grudgingly admired the narrator's writing, although Alfrida thought that the narrator wasn't as smart as she thought she was. This revelation causes the narrator to return to the evening of her last dinner with her father's cousin. Afterward she had gone to a coffee shop where, drinking the coffee and watching the middle-class men and women around her, the narrator had thought that this was what she truly wanted out of life. * \\"Comfort\\": Nina returns home to discover that her husband Lewis, a retired science teacher, has committed suicide.

Lewis, an aggressive atheist, had been forced to resign for refusing to teach creationism, and he did not want his enemies to think he killed himself as a result. Nina entrusts the funeral arrangements to Ed, a local undertaker whom she once kissed at a party. While embalming the body, Ed discovers a small note in Lewis's pocket that he gives to Nina. Instead of the expected farewell, it contains satirical verse that ridicules Lewis's creationist adversaries.

The white coat ceremony (WCC) is a relatively new ritual in some medical (MD, DO), physician assistant, dental, optometry, speech-language pathology, audiology, osteopathy, chiropractic, Dietitians, occupational therapy, physical therapy, podiatric, pharmacy, pathologists' assistant, nursing, naturopathic and veterinary schools that marks the student's transition from the study of preclinical to clinical health sciences. At some schools, where students begin meeting patients early in their education, the white coat ceremony is held before the first year begins. It is an example of a matriculation. WCCs typically involve a formal \\"coating\\" of students. Description Over 100 medical schools in the United States now have a WCC, and many students now consider it a rite of passage in the journey toward a healthcare career. Some schools also use this as a graduation from the entire program. For example, Moreno Valley College has a White Coat Ceremony for the Physician Assistant students at the end of their final term, where the short coats are discarded and long coats are given as a symbol of being equal clinicians to others who have earned the long coats. According to some, WCCs have taken on a quasi- religious significance, that symbolizes a \\"conversion\\" of a lay person into a member of the healthcare profession and is similar to a priest's ordination to the priesthood, although it is notable that the white coat is a recent adoption by the medical profession. However, in many medical schools around the world students begin wearing their white coats during first-year anatomy class, so there is no official white coat ceremony. In the nineteenth century respect for the certainty of science was in stark contrast to the quackery and mysticism of nineteenth-century medicine. To emphasize the transition to the more scientific approach to modern medicine, physicians sought to represent themselves as scientists and began to wear the most recognizable symbol of the scientist - the white laboratory coat.Jones VA, \\"The White Coat: Why not Follow Suit?\\" JAMA. 1999;281:478. Full Text. This led to the more recent association of the white coat with medicine since its continued adoption.Hardy, Susan and Corones, Anthony, \\"Dressed to Heal: The Changing Semiotics of Surgical Dress\\", Fashion Theory, (2015), pp.1-23. doi=10.1080/1362704X.2015.1077653 History White Coat Ceremony in Graz (Austria) 2012 RCSI Bahrain students taking a group photo following the 2013 White coat ceremony WCCs originated in University of Chicago's Pritzker School of Medicine in 1989,Warren, Peter M. \\"For New Medical Students, White Coats Are a Warmup\\" Los Angeles Times, 18 October 1999. but the first full- fledged ceremony was at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. In 1993, Dr. Arnold P. Gold, a teacher and pediatric neurologist, created the first full-fledged WCC at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. Before this ceremony, medical students typically received the Hippocratic Oath for the first time at commencement. This ceremony marks a change in tradition, introducing students to the Oath before starting their first year of study. This was intended to provide students with well-defined guidelines regarding the expectations and responsibilities appropriate for the medical profession prior to their first day of class. Since its conception at Columbia, the WCC has spread rapidly to schools of medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, osteopathic medicine, optometry, and nursing worldwide. Since starting in the US, several medical schools in countries outside of the United States (such as Iran, Israel, Canada, UK, Dominican Republic, Brazil and Poland) have also started holding WCCs. The ceremony is no longer limited to medical students; starting in 1995, US pharmacy schools started holding WCCs, with the difference that most pharmacy students receive their coats at the end of their first academic year. In 2003 a survey found that the majority of US pharmacy schools hold WCCs. An Arnold P. Gold Foundation-sponsored version of the WCC, or a similar rite of passage, is currently used by 97 percent of Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC)-accredited schools of medicine in the United States, and takes place at medical and osteopathic schools in 13 other countries. In December 2006 the first white coat ceremony was held by Fatima Jinnah Dental College (FJDC), in Karachi, Pakistan. In October 2008 the white coat ceremony was held at the VU University Medical Center Amsterdam, it was the first ceremony held in The Netherlands. In 2011 Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam also participated in holding the ceremony at their medical faculty.

The population of the parish as taken at the 2011 census was 1,275 It is close to Sedgefield. Bishop Middleham village History Bishop Middleham lies in a dry valley about 9 miles (14 km) south-east of Durham. Although much of County Durham had probably first been settled in the Mesolithic period, the first evidence for occupation in the parish dates to the Neolithic or Bronze Age. At least two simple flint tools, including an arrowhead, have been found in the area. The arrowhead was probably used by an early hunter, though by the Bronze Age farming would have been widespread. By the Iron Age we have our first evidence for burials in the parish- at least six graves were found in a small cave. A small glass bead decorated with white spiral patterns may also have come from an early or middle Iron Age grave, though it may have been lost in another way. It is clear that Bishop Middleham was on an important Roman period routeway; the road known as Cades Road runs through the centre of the parish. Despite the presence of this important communication route, no Roman buildings have been found in the parish. Nonetheless several other Roman objects have been uncovered in the area, including a small bronze statue of a Roman god. More unusually a group of four Roman pans stacked one inside each other have also been discovered. They were decorated so as to give them a silver appearance. It is possible they may have had a religious use, as such pans are often shown carved on the site of Roman altars. The discovery of these objects and the small statue may suggest that an as yet undiscovered Roman temple is still to be found. There is little hard evidence for Anglo-Saxon settlement in the parish, though as Middleham is an Old English name for 'middle settlement or farm' there was certainly some kind of occupation in the area by the 9th or 10th centuries. In 1146 Osbert, the nephew of Bishop Flambard, gave the Church of Middleham to the Prior and Convent at Durham, this is the first recorded mention of the village. In 1183 the Boldon Book, a survey of all the land owned by the Bishop of Durham, records that there were some 32 households in the village, which was surveyed along with neighbouring Cornforth. The survey was particularly detailed and names a number of individuals such as Arkil, Ralph and William the Headborough. Bishop Middleham was one of the favourite residences of the Bishops of Durham, two of whom died here. The residence of the Bishops now only survives as earthwork remains. By the late 14th century the Bishop of Durham appears to have no longer used the Castle as a residence and the buildings and land were let out at first to his bailiff. By 1509 this was a man named John Hall who enjoyed a lease of 31 years. The castle and deer park passed through a number of hands over the following centuries including the Eure family of Witton Castle, the Freville's and by the 18th century the Surtees family which included the notable historian Robert Surtees, who lived nearby at Mainsforth and wrote on the village and Castle in his History of Durham in 1823. He is buried in Bishop Middleham church. By the 19th century the village contained four public houses, a brewery, and a few tradesmen's shops. The village mainly supported itself by farming, though there was some coalmining; the remains of a wagonway have been recorded. The main railway line also ran close to the village. In 2012 a community website was launched with a view to keeping the local people up to date with news and events, St Michael's Church \\"The Church, dedicated to St. Michael, stands upon the hill south of the village, and is said to have been erected by Bishop Beck, but it is more probably the work of Bishop Poor, and of the date about 1230. It was in 1146 presented to the prior and convent of Durham by Osbert, nephew of Bishop Flambard, but it was soon afterwards annexed to the Priory of Finchale, by Bishop Robert de Insula, and so continued till the dissolution. It is a venerable structure, in the Early English style, and consists of nave, chancel, and aisles, with a western bell turret.\\" Environment The Bishop Middleham Community Wildlife Garden (0.87 hectares) has been declared a designated Local Nature Reserve by Sedgefield council.

The storm surge struck the Netherlands, north- west Belgium, England and Scotland. A combination of a high spring tide and a severe European windstorm over the North Sea caused a storm tide. The combination of wind, high tide, and low pressure caused the sea to flood land up to above mean sea level. Most sea defences facing the surge were overwhelmed, causing extensive flooding. Flooding summary In the Netherlands 20% of the land was below mean sea level (more is today, Flevoland); the next-highest 30% sits at less than above sea level. Such land thus relies heavily on sea defences and was worst affected, recording 1,836 deaths and widespread damage. Most of the casualties occurred in the southern province of Zeeland. In England, 307 people were killed in the counties of Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex. Twenty-eight people were killed in the north of West Flanders, Belgium. Nineteen were killed in eastern Scotland. At-sea fatalities A further more than 230 deaths occurred on seacraft along Northern European coasts as well as on ships in deeper waters of the North Sea. The ferry MV Princess Victoria sank in the North Channel east of Belfast with 133 fatalities, and many fishing trawlers sank. Realising that such infrequent events could reoccur, the Netherlands and the UK carried out large studies on strengthening of coastal defences. The Netherlands developed the Delta Works, an extensive system of dams and storm surge barriers. The UK constructed storm surge barriers on the Thames Estuary and on the Hull where it meets the Humber Estuary.  Netherlands  On the night of 31 January ‚Äì 1 February 1953, many dykes in the province of Zeeland, the southern parts of the province of South Holland and the northwestern parts of the province of North Brabant proved unable to resist the combination of spring tide and a northwesterly storm. On both the islands and the mainland, large areas of the country were flooded. Many people still commemorate the dead on 1 February. In Dutch history and culture this flood has been named \\"de Watersnoodramp\\". = Warnings = The Rijkswaterstaat had warned about the risk of a flood. At the time of the flood, none of the local radio stations broadcast at night, and many of the smaller weather stations operated only during the day. As a result, the warnings of the KNMI (Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute) did not penetrate the flood-threatened area in time. People were unable to prepare for the impending flood. The disaster struck on a Saturday night, and hence many government and emergency offices in the affected area were not staffed. As telephone and telegraph networks were disrupted by flood damage, amateur radio operators went into the affected areas with their equipment to form a voluntary emergency radio network. These radio amateurs provided radio communications for 10 days and nights, and were the only people able to maintain contact from affected areas with the outside world. = Resulting damage = Extent of flooding in the Netherlands The Zeeland dikes were breached in 67 locations. Large parts of South Holland, Zeeland and North Brabant were inundated. In North Holland only one polder was flooded. The most extensive flooding occurred on the islands of Schouwen-Duiveland, Tholen, Sint Philipsland, Goeree-Overflakkee, the Hoeksche Waard, Voorne-Putten and Alblasserwaard. Parts of the islands of Zuid-Beveland, Noord-Beveland, IJsselmonde, Pernis, Rozenburg, Walcheren and Land van Altena were flooded, as well as parts of the areas around Willemstad, Nieuw-Vossemeer and parts of Zeelandic Flanders. The highest death tolls were recorded on the islands of Schouwen-Duiveland and Goeree-Overflakkee. Afterward, the government formed the Delta Commission to study the causes and effects of the floods. They estimated that flooding killed 1,835 people and forced the emergency evacuation of 70,000 more. Floods covered 9% of Dutch farmland, and sea water flooded of land. An estimated 30,000 animals drowned, and 47,300 buildings were damaged, of which 10,000 had to be taken down (or were swept away). The total damage is estimated at 1 billion Dutch guilders.

A section of this dyke, known as the Groenendijk, was not reinforced with stone revetments. The water level was just below the crest and the seaward slope was weak. Volunteers worked to reinforce this stretch. However, the Groenendijk began to collapse under the pressure around 5:30 am on 1 February. Seawater flooded into the deep polder. In desperation, the mayor of Nieuwerkerk commandeered the river ship de Twee Gebroeders (The Two Brothers) and ordered the owner to plug the hole in the dyke by navigating the ship into it. Fearing that the ship might break through into the polder, Captain Arie Evegroen took a row boat with him. The mayor's plan was successful, as the ship was lodged firmly into the dyke, reinforcing it against failure and saving many lives. The Afsluitdijk across the entrance of the Zuiderzee was said to have paid for its construction cost in that one night, by preventing destructive flooding around the three great meres that used to be the Zuiderzee. = Reaction = Several neighbouring countries sent soldiers to assist in searching for bodies and rescuing people. The U.S. Army sent helicopters from Germany to rescue people from rooftops. Queen Juliana and Princess Beatrix visited the flooded area only a few days after. A large aid program, the National Relief Fund, was launched, and soldiers raised funds by selling pea-soup door to door. Internationally, 100,000 commemorative postcards, featuring an illustration by Eppo Doeve, were sold. A national donation program was started and there was a large amount of international aid. The Red Cross was overwhelmed by contributions, and diverted some of the funds to assist residents of Third World countries. It was found that the flooding could have been higher; the Rijkswaterstaat's plan concerning the protection and strengthening of the dikes was accepted. As a result, the Delta Works were authorized, an elaborate project to enable emergency closing of the mouths of most estuaries, to prevent flood surges upriver.  United Kingdom  A breach at Erith after the 1953 flood The North Sea flood of 1953 was the worst flood in England and Scotland of the 20th century. Over of coastline was damaged,1953 east coast flood - 60 years on Met Office, April 2013 (retrieved January 2019) and sea walls were breached in 1,200 places,The Flood of 1953 The Open University OpenLearn, September 2004 inundating . Flooding forced over 30,000 people from their homes, and 24,000 properties were greatly damaged. The damage is estimated as ¬£50 million at 1953 prices, approximately ¬£1.2 billion at 2013 prices. Probably the most devastating storm to affect Scotland for 500 years, the surge crossed between Orkney and Shetland. The storm generated coastal and inland hazards, including flooding, erosion, destruction of coastal defences, and widespread wind damage. Damage was throughout the country, with 19 fatalities reported. The fishing village of Crovie (then in Banffshire, now Aberdeenshire), built on a narrow strip of land along the Moray Firth coast, was abandoned by many, as large structures were swept into the sea. The surge raced down the east coast into the mid-to-southern North Sea, where it was amplified by shallower waters. Canvey Island, against the Thames Estuary in Essex was inundated, with the loss of 58 lives. Some 41 people died at Felixstowe in Suffolk when wooden prefabricated homes in the West End of the town were flooded. Another 37 died when the seafront village of Jaywick near Clacton was flooded. In Lincolnshire, flooding occurred from Mablethorpe to Skegness, reaching as far as inland. Police Officers Charles Lewis and Leonard Deptford received George Medals for their part in rescue work. Lewis leapt from a police station upper window to save an elderly couple being swept away in floodwater, carrying them to a house across the road to safety, then continuing rescue work for hours until he found a working telephone to call for help. Deptford was off-duty at his son's party when the wall of water hit. He realised the elderly were vulnerable as the Roman bank was breached and he dragged and carried many to safety. At one house he found a bedridden elderly couple with their middle-aged daughter; in the waist-high floodwater, he lashed together oil cans to make a raft, to which he tied the couple and pulled them to safety. He carried on into day, his last rescue being a dog. Reis Leming, a US airman, was awarded the medal rescuing 27 people of South Beach, Hunstanton. In the East End of London, water overspilled the Royal Docks into Silvertown, where it drained into the sewers but flooded back in Canning Town and Tidal Basin. William Hayward, a night watchman at William Ritchie & Son, died of exposure to gas from a damaged pipe - the only fatality. Almost 200 people were homeless and took refuge at Canning Town Public Hall. The village of Creekmouth on Barking Creek, the mouth of the Roding, was wholly flooded by the sea surge and later demolished. Residents were relocated elsewhere in Barking. The total death toll on land in the UK is estimated at 307. The total death toll at sea for the UK, including the , is estimated at 224.  Belgium  The coastal defence of Flanders was severely damaged. Near Ostend, Knokke and Antwerp, heavy damage was done to the sea defence with local breaches. Twenty-eight people died, including noted Belgian musician Robert Dubois.  Responses  After the 1953 flood, governments realised that similar infrequent but devastating events were possible in the future. In the Netherlands the government conceived and constructed an ambitious flood defence system beginning in the 1960s. Called the Delta Works (), it is designed to protect the estuaries of the rivers Rhine, Meuse and Scheldt. The system was completed in 1998, with completion of the storm surge barrier Maeslantkering in the Nieuwe Waterweg, near Rotterdam. In the UK, the Permanent Secretary to the Home Office, Sir Frank Newsam, coordinated the immediate efforts to defend homes, save lives and recover after the floods. After the flooding, the government made major investments in new sea defences. The Thames Barrier programme was started to secure Central London against a future storm surge; the Barrier was officially opened on 8 May 1984. A range of flood defence measures were initiated around the UK coast.  Commemoration  In 2013 a service was held at Chelmsford Cathedral to mark the 60th anniversary of the Great Flood, attended by Anne, Princess Royal. Acts of remembrance were also held in Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex.

In 1961 he discovered Landauer's principle, that in any logically irreversible operation that manipulates information, such as erasing a bit of memory, entropy increases and an associated amount of energy is dissipated as heat. This principle is relevant to reversible computing, quantum information and quantum computing. He also is responsible for the Landauer formula relating the electrical resistance of a conductor to its scattering properties. He won the Stuart Ballantine Medal of the Franklin Institute, the Oliver Buckley Prize of the American Physical Society and the IEEE Edison Medal, among many other honors. Biography Landauer was born on February 4, 1927, in Stuttgart, Germany. He emigrated to the United States in 1938 to escape Nazi persecution of Jews, graduated in 1943 from Stuyvesant High School, one of New York City's mathematics and science magnet schools, and obtained his undergraduate degree from Harvard in 1945. Following service in the US Navy as an Electrician's Mate, he earned his Ph.D. from Harvard in 1950. He first worked for two years at NASA, then known as the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, at its Glenn Research Center, then known as the Lewis Research Center, in Cleveland. At the age of 25, he began a career in semiconductors at IBM Research. As part of the two-man team responsible for managing IBM's Research Division in the mid-1960s, he was involved in a number of programs, including the company's work on semiconductor lasers. In 1969, he was appointed an IBM Fellow. Much of his research after 1969 related to the kinetics of small structures. He showed that in systems with two or more competing states of local stability, their likelihood depends on noise all along the path connecting them. In electron transport theory, he is particularly associated with the idea, taken from circuit theory, that electric flow can be considered a consequence of current sources as well as applied fields. He was also a pioneer in the area of information handling. His principles have been applied to computers and to the measurement process and are the basis for Landauer's own demonstration that communication, in principle, can be accomplished with arbitrarily little dissipation of energy.R.

During construction of the sanctuary, archaeologists uncovered artifacts dating back to the Canaanite period, as well as tombs from the Second Temple and Byzantine eras.  History  According to the 19th chapter of the Gospel of Luke, Jesus, while riding toward the city of Jerusalem, becomes overwhelmed by the beauty of the Second Temple and predicting its future destruction, and the diaspora of the Jewish people, weeps openly (an event known as Flevit super illam in Latin). () The present church of Dominus Flevit is built upon the foundations of an earlier Byzantine church, which, like most churches, faced east. It was during the Crusader era that people began commemorating the location. After the fall of Jerusalem in 1187, the church fell into ruin. In the early sixteenth century a mosque or madrasah existed at the site, presumably built by the Turks, from the remains of the earlier church, although the exact use is disputed. This place was known as el Mansouriyeh (The Triumphant) and also el Khelweh (The Hermitage). View through the window in the apse of the church The Franciscans were unable to obtain the ruins, so, in 1891 they purchased a small plot of land nearby and built a small chapel there. In 1913 a small private home was built in front of the Franciscan chapel by one Miss Mellon. This home eventually passed to the Sisters of St. Joseph, who eventually sold it to a Portuguese woman. Archaeology In 1940, the Benedictine Sisters sold part of the property to the Franciscans. The old boundary wall was moved at this time to make the division. In 1953 the Franciscans began construction of another wall. While digging the foundations, workers unearthed ancient tombs. Excavations began at the site, led by Fr. Bellarmino Bagatti, OFM. =Tombs= A Canaanite tomb from the Late Bronze Age, as well as a necropolis used from 136 BC to AD 300 were discovered. The necropolis spanned two separate periods, characterized by differing tomb styles. The earlier Second Temple era tombs were of the kokh style, while the Byzantine era section was composed of tombs with arcosolium from the 3rd and 4th centuries AD. A Byzantine monastery from the 5th century was also discovered. Mosaics from this monastery still remain at the site. =Byzantine mosaic= The Byzantine mosaic floor, dating to the beginning of the seventh century CE. The floor is surrounded by ribbons and wave motifs. The centre of the carpet is divided by squares containing round frames. The circles contain fruit, vegetables, flowers and fish. The Byzantine mosaic attest to the importance of agriculture for the people of the period. The motifs reflect the developed and progressive agriculture of Byzantine Palestine including Jerusalem. Some images also contain unique elements, as for instance luffa for the producing of bathing sponges, edible Snakes Melons, and figs tied by a blue string. Parts of the Byzantine mosaic can also be seen inside the modern church building, with a limestone slab bearing a large cross in the middle (fig. 2 in the gallery below). Architecture Located on the western slope of the Mount of Olives, the church was designed and constructed between 1953 and 1955 by the Italian architect Antonio Barluzzi and is held in trust by the Franciscan Custody of the Holy Land.

Bazalgette Tunnel Limited (BTL) is the licensed 'Infrastructure Provider' set up to finance, build, maintain and operate the Thames Tideway Tunnel. BTL is a consortium of investors that comprises Allianz, Amber Infrastructure, Dalmore Capital and DIF. From the licence award, BTL trades and is known to the public as 'Tideway'. On 3 November 2015, BTL received its operating licence from Ofwat, ensuring the start of the project. Started in 2016, construction of the Thames Tideway Tunnel aimed to take seven to eight years with all work completed by 2024, but, in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic delayed estimated completion to early 2025. Once constructed, the main tunnel will have an internal diameter of and will run from at Acton in the west of London for over under central London finally reaching at Abbey Mills in the east. It will connect 34 of the most polluting combined sewer overflows (CSOs), via transfer tunnels, and was expected to reduce the number of overflow events to a maximum of four per CSO per year at time of commissioning, although increasing gradually due to effects of climate change and population growth.\\"Thames Tunnel Needs Report\\", section 5.3.4, Thames Water, Summer 2010. The tunnel will transfer the captured sewage to the Stratford to East Ham part for onward delivery to Beckton Sewage Treatment Works for treatment. The recycled clean water will then be released into the River Thames. The estimated capital cost ‚Äì excluding unknown financing costs and ongoing operations and maintenance costs ‚Äì was ¬£3.8bn to complete, with an additional ¬£1.1bn for preparatory works. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, additional costs of ¬£233m were incurred (taking the estimated project cost to ¬£4.133bn). Background Built between 1859 and 1865, Sir Joseph Bazalgette's original London sewerage system was designed to capture both rainwater runoff and the sewage produced by four million people. As a failsafe, to prevent sewage backing up and flooding people's homes, Bazalgette's system had the ability to overflow into the Thames via 57 combined sewer overflows (CSO) along the banks of the river. By 2012, the population of Greater London had grown to an estimated eight million and Thames Water said that the current system lacked the necessary capacity. Bazalgette's original system did not serve all the population, since as London continued to grow in the 19th and 20th centuries, outer suburbs were provided with separate sewerage and rainwater infrastructure. Overflows became increasingly common and by the beginning of the 21st century occurred on average 50 times a year. An estimated total of some , or 39 million tonnes, of storm sewage entered the river in a typical year.Thames Water Needs report (Summer 2010) accessed: 16 January 2014 These discharges, a mixture of raw sewage and rainwater, needed to be reduced to comply with the EU's Waste Water Treatment Directive (UWWTD) and to improve the ecology of the river. Options assessment Instigated in 2001, the Thames Tideway Strategic Study,Thames Tideway Strategic Study ‚Äì Executive Summary (2005). Accessed 17 January 2014 conducted by a group comprising Thames Water, the Environment Agency, DEFRA and the Greater London Authority, was intended to assess the impact of the CSO discharges into the Thames and to identify objectives and propose potential solutions, while keeping costs and benefits in mind. =Outcomes= After four years, the Thames Tideway Strategic Study report was published in 2005, and outlined the following objectives: # To protect the ecology of the Tideway; # To reduce aesthetic pollution due to sewage-derived litter; and # Protect the health of recreational water users =Potential strategies= Four potential strategies were discussed: # Adoption of source control and sustainable urban drainage; # Separation of foul and surface drainage and local storage; # Screening, storage or treatment at the discharge point to river; and # In-river treatment After evaluation it was decided that only one strategy, the screening, storage or treatment at the point of discharge, would meet the objectives fully. The remainder were found to be either impractical or insufficient to provide a solution. However, a number of parties questioned the validity of this conclusion, in particular dismissal of SUDs/blue-green infrastructure as a solution. Some groups that opposed the tunnel stated that it is an unsustainable 19th-century solution to a 21st-century problem. They argued that rainwater should instead be captured or slowed down before entering the combined sewers, which would reduce pressure on capacity and take away the need for a tunnel. =Screening, storage and treatment= The three-part solution to implement screening, storage and treatment was collectively known as the London Tideway Improvements. East Ham to Stratford The first part was a deep storage and conveyance tunnel from Jenkins Lane, East Ham to Abbey Mills, Stratford. This long tunnel, running up to deep from Abbey Mills to Beckton was to capture , or 16 million tonnes, annually from the single largest polluting CSO in London. Thames Water awarded the estimated ¬£635 million construction contract to the MVB joint venture, made up of Morgan Sindall, VINCI Construction Grands Projets and Bachy Soletanche, in January 2010. The construction of the tunnel began in 2010 and on 28 January 2016 Mayor of London Boris Johnson opened the tunnel for service. Sewage treatment works modernisation The second part was the ¬£675 million project to modernise and extend London's five major sewage treatment works to treat a greater volume of sewage, significantly reducing the need for storm discharges to the river: * Mogden Sewage Treatment Works ‚Äì a ¬£140 million upgrade to extend sewage treatment capacity by 50 per cent * Crossness Sewage Treatment Works ‚Äì a ¬£220 million upgrade to extend treatment capacity by 44%; * Beckton Sewage Treatment Works ‚Äì a ¬£190 million upgrade to extend treatment capacity by 60 per cent; * Riverside Sewage Treatment Works ‚Äì an ¬£85 million upgrade to improve water quality and produce renewable energy on site; * Long Reach Sewage Treatment Works ‚Äì a ¬£40 million upgrade in Dartford; These upgrade works were intended to improve the standard to which the sewage was treated at each of the works, thus improving the river Thames water quality. Deep storage and conveyance The final part was the deep storage and conveyance Thames Tideway Tunnel, which should intercept the outflows from London's most polluting CSOs and direct them to sewage treatment works for processing before they could enter the river. Thames Tideway Tunnel planning and consultation =Initial design and phase 1 consultation= Following the Thames Tideway Strategic Study, Thames Water consulted with relevant authorities to get feedback from stakeholders who would potentially be affected by the construction of the Thames Tideway Tunnel. Thames Water sought feedback on the proposed tunnel routes and potential locations of construction sites. Three tunnel routes were considered initially: # River Thames Route ‚Äì the alignment of this route broadly followed the river from west London to Beckton STW and would cut across the Greenwich Peninsula, reducing the length of the tunnel at a location where there are no CSOs to be intercepted along the river. # Rotherhithe Route ‚Äì the alignment of this route was similar to the River Thames route, but would have cut across the Rotherhithe Peninsula as well as the Greenwich Peninsula, reducing the length of the main tunnel by approximately but requiring longer connection tunnels from some CSOs. # Abbey Mills Route ‚Äì this route was different from the River Thames and Rotherhithe routes in that it would connect the Thames Tunnel to the head of the Stratford to East Ham part at the Abbey Mills Pumping Station. This would have followed the same route as the first two options but then deviated from the river toward Abbey Mills. The main tunnel length would be approximately less than the River Thames Route and save approximately ¬£900 million. =Route and sites selection= A long list of 373 potential sites was created using a desktop survey of the land on either side of the 34 most polluting CSOs (as identified in the Thames Tideway Strategic Report). These sites were then further evaluated against more detailed planning, engineering, environmental, property and community considerations resulting in a shortlist of sites. The three tunnel routes, as well as the shortlist of sites, were then put out for consultation between September 2010 and January 2011. In total 2,389 feedback forms (both online and hard copy), 480 pieces of correspondence and five petitions were received. In response to the comments received, changes and improvements to some of the sites, including the potential use of alternative sites and alternative technical solutions, were considered. Based on this a round of interim engagement took place from March to August 2011. Residents around 11 specific sites were sent letters explaining that these sites were being considered as alternative sites, and invited to attend drop-in sessions to pose questions and gain a better understanding of the project. In total ten two-day sessions and one community liaison meeting were held. These were attended by over 800 people. In all 168 comment cards and 147 pieces of site specific correspondence were received and considered. Based on this first round of consultation and interim engagement it was recommended that, for the project to be as cost-effective as possible and cause the least disruption, while still meeting the requirements of the UWWTD, the preferred scheme for the Thames Tideway Tunnel would need to involve: * the shorter Abbey Mills route * a main tunnel long with an internal diameter of ; * direct interception of 21 CSOs; * indirect interception of a further 12, and a local solution for the remaining CSO; * selection of five out of 52 shaft sites from the final shortlist, including three where main shaft sites would be combined with CSO interception sites; and * selection of seventeen out of 71 CSO sites from the final shortlist. The new preferred route and sites were then sent out for a second round of public consultation and feedback. =Phase 2 and targeted consultation= The second phase of consultation was carried out between November 2011 and February 2012 when local authorities, land owners, local businesses and communities were consulted on: * The need for the project and whether a tunnel was the most appropriate solution * The preferred tunnel route (including the detailed alignment of the tunnel) * Preferred sites and permanent works (taking into account the feedback received from the first phase of consultation such as the move from greenfield to brownfield sites) * Detailed proposals for the preferred sites (again taking into account feedback from the phase one consultation) * The effects the project would have (as outlined in the preliminary environmental information report) A total of 1,374 feedback forms (online and hard copy), 4,636 pieces of correspondence and nine petitions were received. Following this consultation, and taking into consideration all the feedback received, the proposed route was finalised as the Abbey Mills route and the preferred construction and drive sites were identified. Several sites were also identified as needing further, targeted consultation which resulted in further refinement and improvement of designs at those sites.

It also required two types of construction sites: main tunnel sites, where the TBM was either launched or received, and CSO sites, where interception tunnels and a connection culvert were built to connect the existing sewer to the new tunnel. Construction of the shafts at the CSO sites, to transfer flows from the existing sewer to the tunnel, would vary depending on the depth, the amount of flow they need to carry and the geology. The shaft would be a concrete cylinder with an internal diameter of and deep. Ventilation structures at CSO sites to allow air in and out of the shaft were also required. Construction at these sites was expected to take between and years and once complete each site would be landscaped. At the main drive sites, four main activities took place: shaft construction (where a concrete cylinder in diameter and about deep was constructed), tunnelling preparations (preparing the site for arrival of the TBM), TBM assembly and lowering into the shaft, and then driving the TBM to excavate the main tunnel. As the TBM moved forward precast concrete segments were brought in and fixed together to create the tunnel wall. Excavated material would be transported out the tunnel via a conveyor belt and processed before being taken off site. In order to minimise disruption, Thames Water committed to use the river as much as possible to transport materials both in and out of the construction sites. At the main tunnelling sites, work was expected to occur 24 hours a day. In 2017 the public voted on a short-list of 17 to name the six TBMs. They were named after inspirational women with a connection to the area where each individual machine started its journey. One began tunnelling from Fulham in 2018 and was named after Rachel Parsons, an engineer and advocate for women's employment rights, who set up the first women-only engineering company in Fulham. The others were cryobiologist Audrey ‚ÄòUrsula‚Äô Smith and suffragist Millicent Fawcett for the Central area and suffragist Charlotte Despard for the Frogmore Connection Tunnel from Wandsworth to Fulham. The TBM that would tunnel the east section from Bermondsey was named after doctor Selina Fox who set up Bermondsey Medical Mission for Southwark's poor and disadvantaged residents. The machine for the Greenwich Connection Tunnel was named after Annie Scott Dill Russell, the first female scientist to work at the Greenwich Observatory. =Planning application= In October 2012, the deadline for the Thames Tideway Tunnels' Section 48 closed. This lasted 12 weeks and was the last opportunity for the public to have their say on the updated proposal. The Application for Development Consent ‚Äì a detailed plan for construction of the Thames Tideway Tunnel ‚Äì was delivered to the Planning Inspectorate on 28 February 2013. The Inspectorate then had 28 days to decide whether the application was valid and whether the consultation undertaken was adequate. On 27 March 2013, it was confirmed that the application was valid and that Thames Water's consultation for the project had been adequate. All the application documents were made available in their own section of the Planning Inspectorate's National Infrastructure website. Thames Water also made the documents available for scrutiny at six public locations along the tunnel's proposed route, three either side of the river. On 3 June 2013, it was announced that the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government had appointed five inspectors (Jan Bessell, Libby Gawith, Emrys Parry, Andrew Phillipson and David Prentis) as the examining authority to consider any matters arising. As part of this process, interested parties were able to make representations. A preliminary meeting, open to those who had registered an interest, began on 12 September 2013 at the Barbican Centre. Chaired by the Planning Inspectorate, this determined how the examination would be carried out, including consideration of more detailed hearings on site-specific matters, as well as project-wide issues. Once the Inspectorate concluded its examination of the application, a recommendation on whether or not to grant approval (by issuing a development consent order) would be submitted to Government ministers to make the final decision. =Planning acceptance= On 12 September 2014, the UK Government approved the plans, overriding some of the findings of the Planning Inspectorate. The decision gave rise to at least three Judicial Reviews. Funding and delivery The budget for the scheme steadily increased since it was first estimated. For example, the budget in 2004 was estimated at ¬£1.7bn, which included the East Ham to Stratford part and sewage treatment works upgrade costs. In the words of the Consumer Council for Water in 2011: > \\"The estimated cost of the project has escalated, from ¬£1.7bn in 2004 > (including Stratford to East Ham part and sewage treatment civil engineering > construction movements (STW) costs) to ¬£2.2bn in 2007 (also including Lee > Tunnel and STW costs) to ¬£3.6bn now for the shorter Thames Tunnel as far as > Abbey Mills, plus some ¬£1bn for the Lee Tunnel and upgrade of works at > Beckton. The total costs of all the Tideway schemes have therefore increased > from ¬£1.7bn six years ago to ¬£4.6bn today (all costs at relevant year > prices). There is no guarantee that the current estimate will not be subject > to further escalation.\\"\\"Thames Water's Thames Tunnel Consultation\\". Consumer > Council for Water. January 2011. Less than a year later, in November 2011, a further ¬£500 million was added to the estimate.\\"Super-sewer‚Äôs price rises ¬£500m\\". Financial Times. 3 November 2011. Retrieved 2013-07-30 Following detailed analysis it was decided that the best means to deliver the project would be through a regulated infrastructure provider (IP) as this would maximise value for money. The IP, originally to be formed through a competitive process starting in the spring of 2013, would hold its own license from the industry regulator, Ofwat, and would build, manage and maintain the tunnel. In January 2013, it was announced that procurement of the IP was to be delayed because Thames Water needed more time to define the funding model to secure financial assurances from the government. The subject of taxpayer support for the construction of a tunnel was a source of controversy, with opponents arguing that the government should not bear risks associated with the project. In a letter to the Financial Times in November 2012, Sir Ian Byatt (former Director General of Ofwat) and politician Simon Hughes MP stated: > If Thames is unwilling to make a rights issue, the owners, Macquarie, should > be expected to return funds to the utility. If they do not, Thames should go > into special administration (allowing for continued service to customers) > and another company or financier allowed to take over its activities. However, procurement for main contractors (who would eventually be contracted to the IP) for up to three packages of work valued at around ¬£500m each started in the summer of 2013. On 29 July, Thames Water announced that a contract notice for work on the tunnel had been published in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU). Following prequalification questionnaires, Thames Water invited shortlisted contractors to tender between November 2013 and April 2014. The successful contractors for the three main tunnelling contracts were announced in February 2015: *West: Joint venture of BAM Nuttall, Morgan Sindall and Balfour Beatty Group *Central: Joint venture of Ferrovial Agroman UK and Laing O'Rourke Construction *East: Joint venture of Costain, Vinci Construction Grands Projets and Bachy Soletanche In August 2015, the independent investors to finance and deliver the scheme were confirmed. Bazalgette Tunnel Limited, a new special-purpose company appointed to take the project forward, received its licence from Ofwat as a new regulated utilities business, separate from Thames Water. The special-purpose company is backed by pension funds and other long-term investors represented by Allianz, Amber Infrastructure Group, Dalmore Capital and DIF. =Planned timeline= *2014: Planning decisions and approval *2015: Main works and financing contracts awarded *2016: Primary work completed; Main works preliminary construction begins *2018: Tunnelling begins *2019: Secondary lining begins *2022: Tunnelling ends *2024: All works completed. In August 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, a project lockdown and revised working practices meant the project was delayed by nine months and had incurred additional costs of ¬£233m (taking the estimated project cost to ¬£4.133bn). Completion was targeted for the first half of 2025. Controversy Since the initial proposal, questions were raised about the scheme's cost, the location of construction sites, the project's duration, the disruption it caused, and whether a tunnel was the correct solution ‚Äì or even necessary at all ‚Äì for London and Thames Water customers. Cost The ¬£4.2bn cost of the Thames Tideway Tunnel project was to be funded entirely by Thames Water customers. This has angered some customers who believe the company has benefited from tax breaks sanctioned by industry regulator, Ofwat, when it was allowed to add debt to its balance sheet, reducing its tax payments while allowing its shareholders to receive dividends ‚Äì money some customers feel should have been spent on the Thames Tideway Tunnel. Thames Water maintained it has done nothing unusual by raising debts to reduce tax bills and that this was following conventional practice. It said the money raised was used for essential maintenance and upgrade works, although some have asked questions about how Thames Water paid so little corporation tax at the same time as distributing dividends to its shareholders. Disruption Some people who live alongside proposed sites were concerned about the noise, disruption and potential loss of public space resulting from construction. To address this Thames Water put together a Code of Construction Practice (CoCP) which outlined both site-specific and project- wide requirements and measures that it said would minimise the impacts of the construction and ensure that best practice standards and requirements were implemented across all sites and contracts. The Code also covered transport (both road and river transport), noise and vibration mitigation, air quality and water resources, land quality, waste management and resource use, ecology and conservation and historic environment. In the report that concluded its inspection of these documents, the Planning Inspectorate found that Thames Water had \\"underestimated of impacts on those that have been identified as having a significant effect and underestimated the number of receptors experiencing a significant effect\\" (12.97) and concluded \\"We do not consider that [Thames Water's] proposals meet the first aim of the NPS test to avoid significant adverse impacts on health and quality of life from noise\\" (12.357). The need for a tunnel Some people maintained that a sustainable urban drainage solution (SUDS) or green infrastructure would remove the need for the tunnel. They argue that replacing paved, impermeable surfaces in London with permeable options and implementing green roofs, swales and water butts would promote the infiltration of rain-water, preventing it from reaching the combined sewer system, thus reducing peak flows and limiting the number of CSO overflows. Opponents of the tunnel felt that these measures would provide the level of control required and be cheaper than the proposed tunnel. They also argued that green infrastructure would have further benefits for London in addition to addressing the rainwater overflow problem, such as: # Increased resilience to drought and floods, # Reduction in urban air pollution, # Climate change mitigation ‚Äì contrasted to the tunnel's significant carbon footprint,\\"The role of the civil engineer in society: engineering ethics and major projects\\". Prof Richard Ashley. 1 August 2012. section \\"Examples of ethical dilemmas\\". Also in Proceedings of the ICE ‚Äì Civil Engineering,Volume 165, Issue 3. Retrieved 2013-07-30. # Enjoyment, aesthetics and health benefits of green spaces and nature, # Reduced urban heat island effects with an associated reduction in cooling load and carbon emissions, # Improved urban biodiversity. # Earlier avoidance of EU fines for not meeting water standards than under the scheme. The earliest customers‚Äô bills would be affected was 2014‚Äì15, with charges rising gradually after that. The project was estimated to add up to ¬£70 to ¬£80 (excluding inflation) to average annual wastewater bills from around 2019. However, these figures were subsequently revised downwards. In August 2015, the impact was expected to be around ¬£20 to ¬£25 per year by the mid-2020s. Archaeological discoveries Much like the contemporaneous Crossrail and High Speed 2 projects, the development gave archaeologists the chance to uncover the hidden secrets of London's past. In late 2018, a 500-year old skeleton of a man found lying face down in the mud on the banks of the River Thames at the Chamber's Wharf site in Bermondsey was discovered. The skeleton was still wearing his knee-high leather boots, suggesting that he may have been a fisherman or mudlark who died an accidental death. A World War II bomb was also discovered by Tideway engineers in Chelsea in December 2019.

It is situated on the A1086 between Horden and Hartlepool, and just south of Blackhall Colliery which it adjoins. It is sometimes referred to by locals in the area as \\"The Rocks\\". One of the earliest mentions of Blackhall Rocks is in the mid-19th century, when the beach was photographed. This was a time when the beach was part of a minor holiday resort, due to the location of a hotel above the cliffs. It was around this time a railway station was established here, which was closed in 1960. Adjacent to the station a siding and coal depot supplied coal from Blackhall Colliery 1 mile north to the surrounding area. The hotel remained up until the late 1960s when it was demolished, at a time when it had been used as flats, as a form of temporary housing, by Easington (district) Council, since the 1940s. Despite the presence of the hotel, it was not until the 1920s and 1930s that Blackhall Rocks really developed as a community and village, something which is itself evident driving down the \\"coast road\\" (the A1086). Most of the houses along this road were built for middle class commuters, hence the proliferation of semi- detached houses and bungalows. In the late 1930s the local council built a large council estate to the west of the coast road, around the road to High Hesleden. Later on in the 1960s and 1970s a series of new council homes were built to the east, between the coast road and the railway line.

It is generally considered to be the second novel in Cather's Prairie Trilogy, following O Pioneers! (1913) and preceding My √Åntonia (1918). The book tells the story of a talented artist born in a small town in Colorado who discovers and develops her singing voice. Her story is told against the backdrop of the burgeoning American West in which she was born in a town along the rail line, of fast-growing Chicago near the turn of the twentieth century, and of the audience for singers of her skills in the US compared to Europe. Thea Kronborg grows up, learning herself, her strengths and her talent, until she reaches success. The title comes from a painting of the same name by Jules Breton in 1884 and part of the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago. Plot introduction \\"Song of the Lark\\" by Jules Breton, the painting that inspired the title of the book. Set in the 1890s in Moonstone, a fictional town in Colorado, The Song of the Lark is the self-portrait of an artist in the making. The ambitious young heroine, Thea Kronborg, leaves her hometown to go to Chicago to fulfill her dream of becoming a well-trained pianist, a better piano teacher. When her instructor hears her voice, he realizes that this is her true artistic gift. He encourages her to pursue her vocal training instead of piano saying, \\"your voice is worth all that you can put into it. I have not come to this decision rashly\\" (Part II, Chapter 7). In that pursuit she travels to Dresden, then to New York City, singing operas. Her reference for life is always her home town and the people she encountered there. The novel captures Thea's independent-mindedness, her strong work ethic, and her ascent to her highest achievement. At each step along the way, her realization of the mediocrity of her peers propels her to greater levels of accomplishment, but in the course of her ascent she must discard those relationships which no longer serve her. Plot summary =Part I: Friends of Childhood= In Moonstone, Colorado, Doctor Archie helps Mrs. Kronborg give birth to her son, Thor. The Doctor takes care of their daughter, Thea, who is sick with pneumonia. The next year Thea goes to the Kohlers for piano lessons with Wunsch and practices daily for two hours (or four hours if school is not in session). The doctor goes to Spanish Johnny who is sick. Later, Ray Kennedy goes out to the countryside with Johnny, his wife, Thea, Axel, and Gunner. Although she is only twelve and he is thirty, Ray dreams of marrying her when she is old enough. They tell stories of striking it rich in silver mines in the west. Before Christmas, Thea plays the piano at a concert, but the town paper praises her rival Lily which upsets Thea, as she wanted to sing rather than perform an instrumental piece. Tillie turns down the local drama club's notion to have Thea play a part in The Drummer Boy of Shiloh, knowing that acting is not her niece's talent. After Christmas, Wunsch tells Thea about a Spanish opera singer who could sing an alto part of Christoph Willibald Gluck. She sings for him. He says she needs to learn German for many of the good songs. Wunsch gets so drunk that he behaves badly and hurts himself. Ten days later, all of his students discontinue their lessons with him, and he leaves the town. Shortly after, Thea drops out of school and takes up his students; at fifteen she begins to work full-time. Thea and her mother enjoy a trip to Denver on Ray's freight train, riding in the caboose. They stop for lunch with the station agent at a town along the way. That fall, Mr. Kronborg insists that Thea help at the Wednesday prayer meeting by playing the organ and leading the hymns, and she does. At fifteen, religion perplexes Thea, as typhoid kills her schoolmates and a local tramp, the source of the infection, is made to leave town; she wonders if the Bible tells people to help him instead. Dr. Archie tells her that people have to look after themselves. On the way from Moonstone to Saxony, Ray's train has an accident and the next day he bids an emotional goodbye to Thea before he dies. After the funeral, Dr. Archie informs Mr. Kronborg that Ray has bequeathed six hundred dollars to Thea for her to go to Chicago and study music there. Her father agrees to let her go despite her only being seventeen. =Part II: The Song of the Lark= In Chicago, Thea settles close to the parish of a Swedish Reformed Church with two German women. She sings in the choir and in funerals for a stipend, and she takes piano lessons with Mr. Harsanyi. When Mr. Harsanyi learns Thea sings in a church choir, he asks her to sing. He is very impressed by her voice. Later, he meets with the conductor of the Chicago Orchestra and asks him who is the best voice teacher in the area; it is Madison Bowers. He then parts with Thea, explaining that her voice is her true artistic gift, not her playing. After several weeks of singing lessons, she takes a train back to Moonstone for her summer vacation. She has grown. She goes to a Mexican ball with Spanish Johnny and sings for them, feeling the pleasure of the audience for the first time. Back in her house, Anna reproaches her for singing for them and not their father's church. She returns to Chicago in the fall. =Part III: Stupid Faces= In Chicago, Thea moves from one home to another. She takes daily singing lessons, spending the afternoons as accompanist for Bowers' more accomplished students. She grows tired of them, not all people like the warm and intelligent Harsanyis. Fred Ottenburg shows up for lessons, a man who is educated, lively and closer to her age than all her male teachers. He introduces her to the Nathanmeyers, a Jewish family who loves operatic music and her style of singing. They invite her to sing at their musical evenings, helping her with proper dress. Thea catches an infection and does not fully recover; she needs a break in her familiar desert setting but will not return to her family until she has accomplished something. Fred suggests that she spend the summer on a ranch in Arizona where there are some of the cliff homes of the ancient peoples that Thea has longed to see. =Part IV: The Ancient People= Thea gets off the train at Flagstaff, Arizona, seeing the San Francisco Peaks to reach the Bitmer home. She recoups her health, with days in the canyon, resting in one of the ancient cliff dwellings, while sharing the meals of Mr. and Mrs. Bitmer. She comes to know herself better in the moments of isolation. Ottenburg joins her in July. After much direct conversation, they kiss. They take refuge from a severe storm, and then make a daring trek back to the ranch in the dark, met by Bitmer with a lantern. They talk of what is next; Thea thinks she is in love and considers marrying him. Fred suggests a visit to Mexico City, before getting her to Germany, where he feels she belongs, for her singing. Ottenburg does not tell her he married eight years earlier, though he and his wife have been estranged for most of those years, keeping up appearances. =Part V: Doctor Archie's Venture= In Denver, Dr. Archie receives a telegram from Thea summoning him to New York City and asking him to lend her money so that she can study singing in Germany. Fred told Thea about his marriage in Mexico City, and Thea accepts it, but makes it clear the limits his first marriage imposes on them. She tells Archie about this. In New York she tells Fred that she will leave and will not accept his financial help. Archie goes to dinner with Ottenburg and Thea. The next day, Fred leaves to tend his dying mother. Thea ponders the risks of her ambition, realizes she is young, just 20, and heads to Germany. =Part VI: Ten Years Later= Ten years after Thea leaves for Germany, Dr. Archie lives in Denver after his mining investments succeed and his wife has died. His life is better. He was involved in politics but is now tired of it. He wants to go to New York City, as does Fred, where Thea is performing. He has not seen her in ten years. Four years after she left for Germany, Thea's father died of disease and Mrs. Kronborg began to fail without him. Thea ached to go home to her mother, but opportunity opened in the opera company in Dresden for her before she could go home. Dr. Archie tries to keep Mrs. Kronborg's spirits up, but she dies. Thea has paid back the loan to Dr. Archie already. In New York City, Thea performs at the Metropolitan Opera House. Dr. Archie and Fred are there to attend her performance. The three are good friends. Fred is still tied to his wife, who has been in a sanitarium for the last seven years; but he pines to raise a son. Thea is asked to replace an ill singer at the last minute, and she performs very well. Thea is then announced to sing the entire role of Sieglinde, in the program. This role is well-suited to her voice. Besides Archie and Fred, two other people from her past are in the audience‚ÄîHarsanyi, her teacher from Chicago, and Spanish Johnny, the Mexican mandolin player from Moonstone, who all deeply enjoy her performance, as does the entire audience. In the epilogue, Tillie Kronborg is in Moonstone, enjoying her niece's successes in the opera. She recalls hearing the famous Kronborg when the opera travelled to Kansas City, and she is happy.

She bothers Thea, and disappoints her, for low general knowledge, as well as singing style. Mrs. Harsanyi advises Thea to forget about her, the same advice Bowers gives, so she will focus on her own voice. * Jessie Darcey: A soprano singer training under Bowers who is soon to go on tour, singing songs that Harsanyi taught to Thea in her first winter. Thea thinks Darcey is not very good in her singing, as she tells Mrs Harsanyi, who says, what does it matter how the others are doing? * Mr. Philip Frederick Ottenburg or Fred Ottenberg: Scion of a beer magnate. He went to Harvard and has a particularly engaging personality. He loves opera and likes to sing himself, but not professionally.

Soon after the marriage, she lives in Santa Barbara, unwilling to give Fred a divorce. She was originally engaged to Dick Brisbane. A bit later, she lives in an asylum, still binding Fred to her because of the laws protecting her. Her family is owner of a large Kansas City brewery. * Alphonse: the hansom driver for Ottenburg and Edith in New York City in their very brief courtship years earlier. ;Denver * Captain Harris: The friend and financier who loans Dr. Archie cash in Denver so he in turn can bring cash to Thea in New York. * Thomas Burk: Dr Archie's assistant in Denver, at San Felipe mining. * Jasper Flight: an undaunted prospector who never finds silver, but Dr. Archie will give him another stake. * Pinky Alden: the governor that Doctor Archie helped get elected. * Tai: Doctor Archie's Japanese servant in Denver. * Therese: Thea's maid. ;New York City * Mr. Oliver Landry: An accompanist and singer.

The mountainous and usually arid land in Colorado where Thea was born and places she visits with Ray are real places. In Chicago, Thea often visits the Art Institute of Chicago, which was a significant museum in the time she lived there; its first collection in 1879 was plaster casts of famous sculptures. The new building with the lions out front was built in 1893 at the time of the World's Columbian Exposition, by which time the collections of paintings had greatly expanded. The caves of the ancient peoples, the Anasazi, who predate the Pueblo tribes in northern Arizona, living in cliff- side homes in the canyons where pieces of their pots and arrowheads are found in the soil, where she stayed for a summer, are real places. The San Francisco Peaks she sees as a main landmark are sacred to the Navajo people. Thea mentions Canyon de Chelly, now Canyon de Chelly National Monument, which is located in northern Arizona. Literary significance and criticism * The novel was inspired by the story of soprano Olive Fremstad. * Christopher Nealon has argued that Thea is more boyish than girlish. In the Panther Canyon episode, he links her rapport with Fred to Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick's theory of homosociality. * This novel is one of the first of the Revolt Novels, a term coined by Carl Von Doren in his article in The Nation titled \\"Revolt from the Village\\". This is a style of writing that turns the focus away from rural life as idyllic and focuses on a more real-to-life view of the rural, one that has a conservative, hegemonic and parochial bent, uses the trope of gossip as currency, and a power structure that is more complex than what was evident in the published works of earlier small-town-idyll writers including, Edgar Lee Masters, Sherwood Anderson, and Sinclair Lewis. Revolt from the Village authors wrote from 1915 until the early 1930s and included Willa Cather, Song of the Lark (1915), Sinclair Lewis, Main Street (1920) and Mary Hunter Austin, A Woman of Genius (1921). Adaptations The novel was adapted for television as part of Season 30 of Masterpiece Theatre, airing May 11, 2001.

It is set during the early 16th century. Plot summary Jennifer Merrick is the feisty daughter of a Scottish laird. Royce Westmoreland, the \\"Black Wolf\\", is sent by the King of England to wage war against Scotland. When Royce's brother, Stefan Westmoreland, kidnaps Jennifer and her stepsister, Brenna, and brings them to Royce's camp, the lives of the two become intertwined. Royce and Jennifer must marry by order of the King of England and the King of Scotland after they consummate their keeper-prisoner relationship. Forced to accept the marriage, Jennifer's family try to make the marriage fail by intending to send her to become a nun in a convent after the wedding reception. Royce beats the family plan by kidnapping her first and takes her to his home. The King of England orders the two families to settle their score in a tournament where Jennifer must choose which family her loyalty lies with. Reception and Legacy Romantic Times gave A Kingdom of Dreams a favorable review and a five-star rating. Library Journal noted that the book is \\"filled with McNaught's trademark mix of lush romance and horrible conflict\\", and that the Westmoreland family was iconic in the genre, with significant impact on Romance fandom. NYT bestselling Romance authors Tanya Anne Crosby and Sarah MacLean are both fans of the work. Crosby credits it for inspiring her to write her first published book, Angel of Fire. When MacLean writes a new book, she rereads all of McNaught's works, ending with A Kingdom of Dreams: \\"Here‚Äôs why ‚Äì I am a sucker for the black moment.

It was nominated by the Mystery Writers of America for the Edgar Allan Poe Award for Best First Novel by an American Author. Plot summary Dr. Judd Stevens, M.D., is a caring and successful Manhattan psychoanalyst who must face a horrific prospect; someone is trying to kill him. First, John Hanson, a patient trying to overcome his homosexuality, is murdered. Not long after, Carol Roberts, Stevens' secretary, is found tortured to death. Two police officers, Andrew McGreavy and Frank Angeli, are quick to treat Stevens as the prime suspect, partly due to McGreavy's anger over Stevens' testimony in a previous case. Stevens is later run down by a car, and following his recovery, two men in dark try to kill him in his office. To prove his innocence and track down the real killer, Stevens hires a private investigator by the name of Norman Z. Moody. He also suspects some of his patients: Harrison Burke (a homicidal paranoiac), Anne Blake (a mysterious patient with whom Stevens is in love) and Teri Washburn (a sex addict and former Hollywood actress). Influenced by Angeli (the one who is somewhat friendly and helpful to him), Stevens begins to consider Moody as a suspect. However, Moody dies but not before giving a hint on the killer: Don Vinton. Another murder is attempted on Stevens, but he outsmarts the attackers. McGreavy, along with his police force tries to catch Stevens but he escapes and eventually realises that Don Vinton, in Italian, means the Big Man, a title given to the leader of a criminal syndicate: La Cosa Nostra. He contacts Angeli, who lures him to Anthony DeMarco (a capo of La Cosa Nostra and a megalomaniac), who is revealed to be Anne's husband. He tries to extract information about Anne's sessions with Stevens and forces him to convince Anne to go with her husband (DeMarco) to Europe. It is revealed that he killed Hanson (mistaking him for Stevens) and Carol (to extract information about Anne). After a struggle at a factory, Stevens manages to kill DeMarco and is rescued by McGreavy.

Tomb of Absalom (, Transl. Yad Avshalom; literally Absalom's Shrine), also called Absalom's Pillar, is an ancient monumental rock-cut tomb with a conical roof located in the Kidron Valley in Jerusalem, a few metres from the Tomb of Zechariah and the Tomb of Benei Hezir. Although traditionally ascribed to Absalom, the rebellious son of King David of Israel (circa 1000 BCE), recent scholarship has dated it to the 1st century CE. The tomb is not only a burial structure in its own right, with its upper part serving as a nefesh or funeral monument for the tomb in its lower part, but it was probably also meant as a nefesh for the adjacent burial cave system known as the Cave or Tomb of Jehoshaphat, with which it forms one entity, built at the same time and following a single plan. The freestanding monument contains a burial chamber with three burial sites. The chamber is carved out of the solid lower section of the monument, but can only be accessed from the upper section via a built entrance and a staircase. It has been compared to Petra, given the rock-cut nature of the bottom segment and the style of the finial. Description Stereo card by T.W. Ingersoll Absalom's Pillar is approximately in height. The monument proper stands on a square base and consists of two distinct parts. The lower section is a monolith, hewn out of the rocky slope of the Mount of Olives, while the upper part, rising higher than the original bedrock, is built of neatly cut ashlars. The lower half is thus a solid, almost perfectly cubical monolithic block, about square by high, surrounded on three sides by passageways which separate it from the vertically-cut rock of the Mount of Olives. It is decorated from the outside on each side by pairs of Ionic half-columns, flanked in the corners by quarter-columns and pillars (a so-called distyle in antis arrangement). The four square facades are crowned by a Doric frieze of triglyphs and metopes and an Egyptian cornice. Inside view of Absalom's Pillar, Photoshop-morphed from the following two early 20th-century photos. The upper, ashlar-built part of the monument consists of three differently- shaped segments: a square base set on top of the Egyptian cornice of the lower part, followed by a round drum crowned by a rope-shaped decoration, which sustains a conical roof with concave sides (the easily recognisable \\"hat\\"), topped by a half-closed lotus flower. The upper part of the monument corresponds to the outline of a classical tholos and is not unlike contemporary Nabatean structures from Petra. On the inside, the upper part of the monument is mostly hollow, with a small arched entrance on the south side set above the seam area (where the masonry part starts). Inside this entrance a short staircase leads down to a burial chamber carved out of the solid, lower section. The chamber is square, with arcosolium graves on two sides and a small burial niche. The tomb was found empty when first researched by archaeologists.\\"Archaeological Supplement: Absalom's Pillar\\", in Thompson Chain-Reference Bible, 1964 edition, p. 311. Retrieved on 2009-11-17. Dating An analysis of the architectural styles used indicates that the monument's construction and its first stage of use happened during the 1st century CE.Hachlili, Rachel. Jewish Funerary Customs, Practices and Rites in the Second Temple Period. Boston: Brill, Leiden, 2005. Pages 30-34. The irregular-shaped holes made into the monument are of later date, probably from the Byzantine period. Even the original entrance has been widened in such rather defacing manner.

Traditional attribution 1839 image from The Holy Land, Syria, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt, and Nubia Absalom's shrine has traditionally been identified as the monument of Absalom, rebellious son of King David, based on a verse in the Book of Samuel: A \\"monument of Absalom\\" did exist in the days of Josephus, and was referred to in his Antiquities.Antiquities of the Jews, vii. 10, ¬ß 3. Cited in Jewish Encyclopedia 1906 The 19th-century English translation by Havercamp states that the \\"monument of Absalom\\" stood at a distance of \\"two furlongs\\" from Jerusalem.Antiquities of the Jews, Book VII, chapter 10, ¬ß 3. From Complete works of Josephus, based on Syvert Havercamp's translation. Bigelow, Brown & Co., New York, before 1923, volume one, p. 516 The attribution of this particular monument to Absalom was quite persistent, although the Book of Samuel reports that Absalom's body was covered over with stones in a pit in the Wood of Ephraim (). For centuries, it was the custom among passersby‚ÄîJews, Christians and Muslims‚Äîto throw stones at the monument. Residents of Jerusalem would bring their unruly children to the site to teach them what became of a rebellious son. Modern scholarship The tomb's exterior design features a Doric frieze and Ionic columns, both being styles originating in ancient Greece and introduced into Judah during the Seleucid Empire, centuries after the death of Absalom. At the start of the 20th century, the monument was considered most likely to be that of Alexander Jannaeus, the Hasmonean king of Judea from 103 to 76 BCE.Conder, in Hastings' Dictionary of the Bible, article \\"Jerusalem,\\" p. 597). Cited in Jewish Encyclopedia 1906 However, archaeologists have now dated the tomb to the 1st century AD. In a 2013 conference, Professor Gabriel Barkay suggested that it could be the tomb of Herod Agrippa, the grandson of Herod the Great, based in part on the similarity to Herod's newly discovered tomb at Herodium. Original couple of pictures Cave of Jehoshapat =Nefesh to the Tomb of Jehoshaphat= Archeologically, the so-called \\"Tomb of Absalom\\" is not only a burial structure in its own right, with its upper part serving as a nefesh or funeral monument for the tomb in its lower part, but it was probably also meant as a nefesh for the adjacent burial cave system known as the \\"Cave\\" or \\"Tomb of Jehoshaphat\\", with which it forms one entity, built at the same time and following a single plan. During the times of the Second Temple, many wealthy citizens of Jerusalem would have monuments built adjacent to their family burial caves. These monuments were built according to the architectural fashions of the time, many times with a pyramid on top, or in this case, a cone. Jewish sages of that era opposed the building of such monuments by saying: \\"You do not make Nefashot for the righteous; their words are their commiseration.\\"Jerusalem Talmud, Shekalim, 47a Inscriptions In 2003, a 4th-century inscription on one of the walls of the monument was deciphered. It reads, This is the tomb of Zachariah, the martyr, the holy priest, the father of John. This suggests that it was the burial place of the Temple priest Zechariah, father of John the Baptist, who lived 400 or so years earlier than the inscription date. This inscription is part of a secondary usage of this monument during the Byzantine period, where Christian monks commemorated stories from the Christian Bible inside old Jewish tombs in the Kidron Valley. The Zechariah inscription has led to confusion with the nearby \\"Tomb of Zechariah\\", which commemorates a much earlier figure, the prophet Zechariah ben Jehoiada, according to local folklore; however, it is not a tomb and might also be a monument for the nearby burial cave of the priestly family of Hezir. Another inscription discovered in 2003 says the monument is the tomb of \\"Simeon who was a very just man and a very devoted old (person) and waiting for the consolation of the people\\". The passage is identical to as it appears in the Codex Sinaiticus, a 4th-century manuscript of the Bible. Legends According to a local legend, Napoleon fired a mortar at the tomb, and removed the shape of a hand that topped the conical roof.Morgenstern, A (2006) Hastening Redemption: Messianism and the Resettlement of the Land of Israel, p. 11, Oxford University Press, However, Napoleon never reached Jerusalem during his campaign in the Holy Land. Actually, the top of the monument is not at all broken, but rather is carved to resemble a lotus flower.

It is situated about to the south-east of Durham, on the A177, between Coxhoe to the south-east, and High Shincliffe to the north-west. It is part of the Cassop-cum-Quarrington parish.  History  Originally a small farming hamlet, named after the shape of the small burn that runs through it, Bowburn's history, like that of many other villages in the region, is linked closely to coal mining. Several coal mines were sunk in the area during the 19th century but extensive development did not begin until an entirely new Bowburn Colliery began to be sunk in 1906. Bowburn therefore celebrated its 100th anniversary on 23 July 2006. The first ‚ÄúBowburn Colliery‚Äù was a shaft sunk in 1840 but failed to find workable coal. The second Bowburn Colliery was sunk a few years later, south of there (near Park Hill), being one of several sunk in the Quarrington and Coxhoe areas. It was close to the terminus of the Durham Branch of the Clarence Railway. The pit was a small concern, worked first by Robson and Jackson and then the West Hetton Coal Company. It probably closed in about 1870. Bowburn Colliery Tub The third and most famous Bowburn Colliery was sunk in 1906 by Bell Bros. Ltd., using the 1840 shaft as the ventilation upcast shaft (and, later, for manriding). Its first coal was drawn in 1908. It merged with Tursdale colliery in 1931 and grew to be one of the largest in the Durham coalfield, working six seams and with over 2,500 employees in the 1950s. Meanwhile the village was growing around it. Hardly anything now remains of the colliery complex which closed in July 1967. The main colliery yard is now the site of the Bowburn South Industrial Estate. The day of the annual Durham Miners' Gala (also called \\"the Big Meeting\\") used to see large unions of men marching through the village, as Bowburn was en route to Durham for some surrounding pit villages. Local residents have, with the help of the Heritage Lottery Fund, had two of Bowburn‚Äôs original miners‚Äô banners restored and a new one produced to be paraded at the Gala. By September 2006, two of the restored banners were on display in Bowburn Community Centre, together with the new one (the \\"Centenary Banner\\"). This, with another new one designed by Bowburn Junior School pupils, was paraded for the first time at the 2006 Gala. They have paraded through the village and at the Miners‚Äô Gala every year since then. Other events also celebrated the village‚Äôs centenary year, including a party and firework display in Bowburn Park, exactly 100 years after Gertrude Bell (as daughter of the Chairman of Bell Brothers) cut the first sod on 23 July 1906 to commence the sinking of the downcast shaft.  Facilities  The Church of Christ the King, or \\"Pineapple Church\\", demolished in 2007 and rebuilt as a more simple building in 2008. The cross remained until Autumn 2009.The simple, but functional, brick 'shed' which replaced the 'Pineapple Church'. Following the closure of the colliery and latterly the Cape Minerals Works, Bowburn declined. More recently the location of the village, near Durham City and close to the A1(M) junction 61, has meant that the village has become a prime site for new commuter housing and industrial estates. Much of the housing in Bowburn is still relatively low cost in terraces or on post-war council estates. However there has been significant development of owner occupied housing along the eastern edge of the village, and on the old secondary school site. From 2004, a village regeneration project began, involving the demolition of some council housing on the northern estate and the building of a mixture of housing association and private housing. As part of the regeneration project, the park was upgraded, with new football fields, an outdoor gym and an excellent children‚Äôs play area, as well as significant improvements to such community facilities as Bowburn Community Centre and the DJ Evans Youth Club (aka Bowburn Youth Project). A local community partnership has met monthly since the start of the regeneration project, and welcomes all residents interested in contributing to the improvement of the village and surrounding area. A village newsletter, Bowburn Interchange, is produced by a local community group, Bowburn Village Celebration, and delivered by volunteers throughout the village four times a year. One of Bowburn's claims to fame was its parish church, Christ the King, built between 1963 and 1978. It had a detached spire described locally as 'The Rocket' standing alongside the main church building, which featured a spiked dome roof which led some to call it \\"The Pineapple Church\\". The church ceased to be used for public worship due to its poor condition and was demolished in June 2007, while the adjacent spire fell over due to gales on 3 October 2009. In May 2008 construction of a new church building began on the site, completed in Autumn 2008. Bowburn currently (2018) has its own Junior and Infant & Nursery schools. A new single-site Primary School is planned to be built and opened by September 2019. Secondary pupils attend a number of schools outside the village. Since the closure of the village‚Äôs own secondary school, most pupils attended Durham Johnston Comprehensive School, in Durham City. Changes to admissions rules since then, however, mean that they attend a variety of schools. The designated school for those living north of the A1(M) motorway is now Belmont Community School.

Plot summary The book is the fictional autobiography of Daisy Goodwill Flett, a seemingly ordinary woman whose life is marked by death and loss from the beginning, when her mother dies during childbirth. Through marriage and motherhood, Daisy struggles to find contentment, never truly understanding her life's true purpose. The book is divided into ten chapters detailing each epoch of Daisy's life. **Birth, 1905** Daisy Goodwill is born to Mercy Stone and Cuyler Goodwill in the summer of 1905. Mercy is an obese woman who loves to cook, eat, and keep house. Cuyler is a short, love-starved mason who worships his wife. Mercy dies of eclampsia shortly after giving birth, and Daisy is left to the care of her neighbour, Mrs. Clarentine Flett, for the first eleven years of her life. **Childhood, 1916** Daisy is raised by her neighbour \\"Aunt Clarentine\\" and her neighbour's adult son \\"Uncle Barker\\" in Winnipeg. Mrs. Flett corresponds regularly with Daisy's father. That year Mrs. Flett is struck and killed by a speeding cyclist, and Daisy eventually goes to live with her estranged father in Indiana while Barker moves to Ottawa. **Marriage, 1927** Daisy marries Harold Hoad, a university dropout and alcoholic. He arrives drunk to their wedding and only stops drinking while seasick on their journey to honeymoon in Paris. Harold indulges in increasingly reckless behaviour before he falls to his death from a second storey window. Their marriage is never consummated. **Love, 1936** Daisy has spent the last nine years living with her father and his new bride, Maria. After revealing to her friends that she feels stifled, Daisy takes the train to Ottawa, stopping to see Niagara Falls and the Dionne quintuplets along the way. Barker eagerly awaits Daisy's arrival, admitting to himself that he has been in love with her for decades. They quickly marry, much to the shock of all their acquaintances. **Motherhood, 1947** Daisy Flett is now the mother of Alice, Warren, and Joan. Barker, now sixty- five, worries what to do with his time after he retires. Brief accounts are made of the children and Daisy's home life. Barker's father moves back to his boyhood home in the Orkney Islands. **Work, 1955-1964** This chapter is composed entirely of letters from other people writing to Daisy. Barker Flett dies of a malignant brain tumor at the age of seventy two. Niece Beverley, a former WREN in World War II, comes to live in Ottawa after getting pregnant. Daisy takes over her late husband's gardening column in the local paper as \\"Mrs. Green Thumb\\" and her oldest daughter goes off to college. Cuyler Goodwill dies and his widow Maria disappears. Daisy visits her two childhood friends 'Fraidy' and 'Beans' and dates her editor Jay Dudley until he callously informs her that her gardening column has been taken over by a full-timer. **Sorrow, 1965** After her job is taken over by someone else Daisy falls into a deep depression, punctuated by fits of rage, unable to get out of bed or take care of herself, although she seems to know that this will eventually pass. Every person in Daisy's life posits their own theory of her condition. **Ease, 1977** With all of Daisy's children grown up and starting their own families Daisy moves to Sarasota, Florida to be near her childhood friends. Beverly's daughter, Victoria, has visited her great-aunt at least once a year, and proposes they visit the Orkney Islands with her college instructor. In Orkney they come across Mr. Flett, now 115 years old and barely cognizant. **Illness and Decline, 1985** In her eightieth year Daisy suffers a serious heart attack in her home, the fall shattering her kneecaps beyond repair. Her childhood friends have predeceased her. She is able to maintain a small social circle at the hospital but is eventually moved to a long-term care facility since she can no longer walk. With little to do she spends most of her time reminiscing. **Death (199-)** After multiple strokes and another heart attack Daisy passes away. The year is never revealed, so she could have lived to her nineties. This final chapter is punctuated with lists of things from Daisy's life, as well as brief conversations between her children and other relatives. The book ends with someone remarking there should have been daisies at the funeral. Background The title of the book might have been inspired by Pat Lowther's poetry collection A Stone Diary (1977). Lowther's murder in 1975 was the inspiration for Shields' earlier novel Swann: A Mystery (1987). Part of the setting for the book is the historic Vinegar Hill neighborhood of Bloomington, Indiana.Indiana Historic Sites and Structures Inventory. City of Bloomington Interim Report. Bloomington: City of Bloomington, 2004-04, 90. Critical reception Kirkus Reviews wrote: \\"Shields, who began as a miniaturist, has come full bloom with this latest exploration of domestic plenitude and paucity; she's entered a mature, luminous period, devising a style that develops an earlier whimsical fabulism into a hard-edged lyricism perfect for the ambitious bicultural exploration she undertakes here.\\" Awards and nominations The Stone Diaries, Shields' best-known novel, won the 1993 Governor General's Award for English language fiction in Canada and the 1995 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in the United States. As an American-born naturalized Canadian, Shields was eligible for both awards; it is currently the only novel ever to have won both awards. It also received the National Book Critics Circle Award and was nominated for the Man Booker Prize.

It is a structural isomer of quinoline. Isoquinoline and quinoline are benzopyridines, which are composed of a benzene ring fused to a pyridine ring. In a broader sense, the term isoquinoline is used to make reference to isoquinoline derivatives. 1-Benzylisoquinoline is the structural backbone in naturally occurring alkaloids including papaverine. The isoquinoline ring in these natural compound derives from the aromatic amino acid tyrosine.Gilchrist, T.L. (1997). Heterocyclic Chemistry (3rd ed.).

The Merck Index (13th ed.). Whitehouse Station, NJ: Merck. Properties Isoquinoline is a colorless hygroscopic liquid at temperatures above its melting point with a penetrating, unpleasant odor. Impure samples can appear brownish, as is typical for nitrogen heterocycles. It crystallizes in platelets that have a low solubility in water but dissolve well in ethanol, acetone, diethyl ether, carbon disulfide, and other common organic solvents. It is also soluble in dilute acids as the protonated derivative. Being an analog of pyridine, isoquinoline is a weak base, with a pKa of 5.14. It protonates to form salts upon treatment with strong acids, such as HCl. It forms adducts with Lewis acids, such as BF3. Production Isoquinoline was first isolated from coal tar in 1885 by Hoogewerf and van Dorp.S. Hoogewerf and W.A. van Dorp (1885) \\"Sur un isom√©re de la quinol√©ine\\" (On an isomer of quinoline), Recueil des Travaux Chemiques des Pays-Bas (Collection of Work in Chemistry in the Netherlands), vol.4, no. 4, pages 125‚Äì129. See also: S. Hoogewerf and W.A. van Dorp (1886) \\"Sur quelques d√©riv√©s de l'isoquinol√©ine\\" (On some derivatives of isoquinoline), Recueil des Travaux Chemiques des Pays-Bas, vol.5, no. 9, pages 305‚Äì312. They isolated it by fractional crystallization of the acid sulfate. Weissgerber developed a more rapid route in 1914 by selective extraction of coal tar, exploiting the fact that isoquinoline is more basic than quinoline. Isoquinoline can then be isolated from the mixture by fractional crystallization of the acid sulfate. Although isoquinoline derivatives can be synthesized by several methods, relatively few direct methods deliver the unsubstituted isoquinoline. The Pomeranz‚ÄìFritsch reaction provides an efficient method for the preparation of isoquinoline. This reaction uses a benzaldehyde and aminoacetoaldehyde diethyl acetal, which in an acid medium react to form isoquinoline. Alternatively, benzylamine and a glyoxal acetal can be used, to produce the same result using the Schlittler-M√ºller modification. 700px Several other methods are useful for the preparation of various isoquinoline derivatives. In the Bischler‚ÄìNapieralski reaction an Œ≤-phenylethylamine is acylated and cyclodehydrated by a Lewis acid, such as phosphoryl chloride or phosphorus pentoxide. The resulting 1-substituted 3,4-dihydroisoquinoline can then be dehydrogenated using palladium. The following Bischler‚ÄìNapieralski reaction produces papaverine. 800px The Pictet‚ÄìGams reaction and the Pictet‚ÄìSpengler reaction are both variations on the Bischler‚ÄìNapieralski reaction. A Pictet‚ÄìGams reaction works similarly to the Bischler‚ÄìNapieralski reaction; the only difference being that an additional hydroxy group in the reactant provides a site for dehydration under the same reaction conditions as the cyclization to give the isoquinoline rather than requiring a separate reaction to convert a dihydroisoquinoline intermediate. Pictet‚ÄìGams reaction In a Pictet‚ÄìSpengler reaction, a condensation of a Œ≤-phenylethylamine and an aldehyde forms an imine, which undergoes a cyclization to form a tetrahydroisoquinoline instead of the dihydroisoquinoline. In enzymology, the (S)-norcoclaurine synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes a biological Pictect-Spengler synthesis: substrates are 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde and 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzene-1,2-diol, whereas its two products are (S)-norcoclaurine and H2O. Intramolecular aza Wittig reactions also afford isoquinolines. Applications of derivatives Isoquinolines find many applications, including: * anesthetics; dimethisoquin is one example (shown below). *: 200x200px * antihypertension agents, such as quinapril and debrisoquine (all derived from 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline). * antiretroviral agents, such as saquinavir with an isoquinolyl functional group, (shown below). *: 200x200px * vasodilators, a well-known example, papaverine, shown below. *: Papaverine Bisbenzylisoquinolinium compounds are compounds similar in structure to tubocurarine. They have two isoquinolinium structures, linked by a carbon chain, containing two ester linkages. In the human body Parkinson's disease, a slowly progressing movement disorder, is thought to be caused by certain neurotoxins. A neurotoxin called MPTP (1[N]-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine), the precursor to MPP+, was found and linked to Parkinson's disease in the 1980s. The active neurotoxins destroy dopaminergic neurons, leading to parkinsonism and Parkinson's disease. Several tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives have been found to have the same neurochemical properties as MPTP. These derivatives may act as precursors to active neurotoxins. Other uses Isoquinolines are used in the manufacture of dyes, paints, insecticides and antifungals. It is also used as a solvent for the extraction of resins and terpenes, and as a corrosion inhibitor. See also * Naphthalene, an analog without the nitrogen atom.

The term is believed to be a borrowing from Malay tembaga, meaning \\"copper\\" or \\"brass\\", which in turn is from Prakrit. It has also been spelled tumbago in literature. Composition and properties Tumbaga is an alloy composed mostly of gold and copper. It has a significantly lower melting point than gold or copper alone. It is harder than copper, but maintains malleability after being pounded. Tumbaga can be treated with a simple acid, like citric acid, to dissolve copper off the surface. What remains is a shiny layer of nearly pure gold on top of a harder, more durable copper-gold alloy sheet. This process is referred to as depletion gilding. Use and function Tumbaga was widely used by the pre- Columbian cultures of South and Central America to make religious objects. Like most gold alloys, tumbaga was versatile and could be cast, drawn, hammered, gilded, soldered, welded, plated, hardened, annealed, polished, engraved, embossed, and inlaid. The proportion of gold to copper in artifacts varies widely; items have been found with as much as 97% gold while others instead contain 97% copper. Some tumbaga has also been found to be composed of metals besides gold and copper, up to 18% of the total mass of the tumbaga. Tumbaga objects were often made using a combination of the lost wax technique and depletion gilding. An alloy of varying proportions of copper, silver, and gold (typically in a percentage ratio of 80:15:5) was cast. After removal it was burned, turning surface copper into copper oxide, which was then mechanically removed The object was then placed in an oxidizing solution likely composed of sodium chloride (salt) and ferric sulfate. This dissolved the silver from the surface, leaving only gold. When viewed through a microscope, voids appear where the copper and silver had been. The \\"Tumbaga\\" Wreck In 1992, approximately 200 silver \\"tumbaga\\" bars were recovered in wreckage off Grand Bahama Island. They were composed mainly of silver, copper, and gold plundered by the Spaniards during the conquests of Cort√©s and hastily melted into bars of tumbaga for transport across the Atlantic. Such bars were typically melted back into their constituent metals in Spain.

The fort contains about 14 round barrows (tumuli), which form a line of burials running east‚Äìwest along the crest of the hill. The fort and the barrows appear to be Bronze Age, but excavations have found some Iron Age pottery in the barrows and the ditches. The fort is near the Fosse Way Roman road. The name of the nearby village of Stoney Stratton means on the stoney stone paved road, which implies there was also a local Roman road in the area, but there are no Roman or post-Roman remains on the site. The fort was excavated in 1904 by Mr. H. St. George Gray, the finds included flints, pottery, and burials sites with human remains. The hill fort is a Scheduled Ancient Monument, and an Open Access area under a DEFRA scheme.

He was the chairman of Toyota Motorsport GmbH (TMG, ex-Toyota Team Europe) and team principal of Toyota F1, the Formula One racing branch of Toyota, until June 2007. Born and raised in Japan, Tomita first joined Toyota in 1969 as an engine development engineer. He continually worked his way up the corporate ladder, becoming the executive in charge of all Toyota racing engines by 1987. In 1996, he became a member of the board of directors, responsible for all of Toyota's international motorsport activities. Many credit Tomita as being the driving force behind Toyota's decision to enter Formula One in 2002. He did not want Toyota to enter F1 as merely an engine supplier; instead, his vision was for the Japanese automobile giant to form its own \\"works\\" team. Toyota has now joined Ferrari and Renault as the only teams producing F1 cars completely from scratch, including the engine, chassis, brakes, suspension and electronics. During the 2003 Formula One season, Tomita relocated to the Toyota Motorsport factory in Cologne, Germany to personally oversee the team's F1 activities. In January 2004, Tomita was elevated to the role of team principal, managing every aspect of Toyota's F1 endeavors. Tomita has recently expanded Toyota's influence in Formula One, announcing that rebadged Toyota engines would be powering Jordan cars in 2005. This deal carried through to 2006, when the team was renamed Midland F1 and then Spyker F1. During the 2006 Formula One season, Tomita announced that the Toyota F1 team would supply the Williams F1 team with engines from 2007 to at least 2008. In April 2007, Tomita announced he would be leaving his post as Toyota F1 team principal to return to work for the company in Japan. Tadashi Yamashina was announced as the person taking over the role. Tomita's exit took place in June.

It eventually became part of the Seaboard Air Line Railway system, and was most recently part of CSX before being abandoned. Until April 9, 1891, the line was owned by two separate companies, the Orlando and Winter Park Railway (west of Lakemont station, incorporated November 20, 1886, colloquially known as the Dinky Line) and the Osceola and Lake Jessup Railway (incorporated January 23, 1889). In 1894, the railroad was merged into the Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad, which became part of the SAL in 1902. The part west of Winter Park was abandoned before the rest, which became part of CSX's former Aloma Branch, connected to the main line at Sanford, Florida. As of 2008, the last active vestige of this branch is currently identified by CSX as its Aloma Spur, which stretches for approximately seven miles from Sanford, skirting the southeastern fringes of that city before closely paralleling State Road 419 for roughly two miles, terminating half a mile from the SR-419/SR-434 fork in the city of Winter Springs. The remainder has all been abandoned. The northeastern portion of the Aloma Branch's former right of way has been converted for use as the Cross Seminole Trail, while the branch to the former Orlando Naval Training Center is now the Cady Way Trail. The last bit in Orlando was in use until recently as a short spur from CSX's main line, and will be used for the Dinky Line Trail.

It is situated a short distance to the southwest of Durham. Brandon was originally one of the seven townships within the ancient parish of Brancepeth. It grew from a sparsely populated agricultural area into a populous mining district after the establishment of collieries and later coke and fireclay works. Until the 19th century Brandon village, formerly known as East Brandon, was one of the larger settlements in Brancepeth Parish. History Brandon was also a manor of the medieval lordship of Brancepeth and as such was possessed by the Neville family, the Earls of Westmoreland, while Holywell, Langley, Littleburn and other such localities were the sites of large freehold gentry houses. =The Northern Rising= After the Northern Rising of 1569, Elizabeth I confiscated Brancepeth Castle and its territories. These were administered as Crown Lands until the 1620s and plundered by a series of courtiers and Royal lessees. In 1628-29 these lands were conveyed to the City of London, when Charles I was forced to redeem his debts to the city. The Brancepeth lands were broken up in a series of sales to London merchants and financiers who in turn resold to local buyers at high profits. The one exception to this fate was Brandon manor, which remained in the hands of its London buyer. A silk merchant, Edward Cropley, bought the whole estate of Brandon manor for ¬£1,700 in 1630, and his family held onto the property till 1710. It was then conveyed to the Earl of Shaftesbury and remained in his family until the 1800s. =William Russell= In 1796 William Russell, a coal owner, retired from mining the Durham Coalfield and spent part of his fortune on buying and restructuring Brancepeth Castle. He set about repurchasing as much as possible of the old lordship broken up in the sales of the 1630s. In 1806 he purchased the Brandon estate from the then Earl of Shaftesbury for ¬£105,000. Russell's granddaughter married into the Irish peerage, and the name Hamilton-Russell and title Viscount Boyne became connected with the district. Population In 1801 the Brandon and Byshottles population was 522; in 1811, 435; in 1851, 525; by 1881 it had risen to 10,850; and in 1891, it was 14,240. There had been a decline in population during the 1830s owing to the removal of workmen who had been engaged on the rebuilding and enlargement of Brancepeth Castle, with the population falling to 427. The stone for this building work had been quarried in Brandon village, and Sawmills Lane is thought to have been constructed as a more direct route for the carting of stone to Brancepeth. Industry =Agriculture= The great majority of the local workforce was engaged in agriculture, when the lessee of Brandon's coal seams was as much a farmer as he was a collier. It is recorded that John Shaw was operating a landsale pit in 1836 using a whim-gin, usually employing horses or a bull, to raise the coal to the surface. =Coal mining= The area experienced a dramatic change in the 1850s, as the growing iron and manufacturing industries required coal and coke in ever-increasing quantities and entrepreneurs moved into the area to develop coal mines. Brandon Colliery railway station in May 1965, the year after it closed. ;Brandon colliery The Newcastle firm of Straker and Love obtained the site that was to become Brandon colliery, sinking the 'A' shaft in 1856 and the 'C' pit in 1860. In 1894, 1150 men and boys were employed working the Hutton, Busty, and Brockwell seams of coal at this colliery. Brandon Pit house was sunk in 1924. Coal mining finally came to an end at Brandon on 15 March 1968. ;Browney colliery Other firms arrived to take leases. Bell Brothers of Newcastle and Middlesbrough commenced sinking at Browney colliery in 1871, with coal being drawn in 1873 from three shafts working the Brockwell, Busty, and Hutton seams. The firm was taken over by Dorman Long & Co. in 1923. In 1930, 625 were employed at the colliery. In July 1938 the pit closed due to flooding. ;Littleburn colliery In North Brancepeth the coal company secured the lease to Littleburn colliery, in 1870 sinking the engineer shaft to the Busty seam, followed by the merchant shaft to the Brockwell in 1871. In 1931 the company went into liquidation, and the pit was re-opened by Bearpark Coal and Coke Co. on a smaller scale to work the Busty seam, until flooding from the River Browney forced its closure in December 1950. Local government changes Map of Brandon and surrounding area In May 1877, under a newly confirmed provisional order, the Parish of Brandon and Byshottles was formed into a local government district governed by a local board, finally breaking away from the Parish of Brancepeth. After the Local Government Act 1894 came into force, the local board was superseded by the Brandon and Byshottles Urban District Council (UDC), which existed until 1974, when it was amalgamated with Durham City and Rural Councils to form the City of Durham District Council. This in turn was abolished as part of the 2009 structural changes to local government in England and has been replaced by a unitary Durham County Council. At the local level, the Brandon and Byshottles Parish, which is co-terminous with the pre-1974 UDC, is represented by a Parish Council, to which Brandon ward elects four members.

It was also the name of the main Irish nationalist Nationalist Party in Northern Ireland from 1921 to 1978. The Home Government Association The Home Government Association was founded in 1870 by Isaac Butt, this was superseded in November 1873 by the Home Rule League and the Home Rule Confederation its British sister organisation. Home Rule League It was founded under Isaac Butt in November 1873 as the Home Rule League. After the death of Butt the party soon divided into radicals led by Charles Stewart Parnell and Whiggish members under William Shaw. Shaw became leader for a year 1879‚Äì1880, but was defeated by Parnell the next year. The Whiggish members all lost their seats in 1885. Home Rule Party The Home Rule Party was set up by a group of English Home Rule MPs' at a meeting in Dublin on 3 March 1874 to pursue the restoration of an Irish legislature. Irish Parliamentary Party The party was reformed by Parnell as the Irish Parliamentary Party in 1882, the constituency organisation of which was the Irish National League. Both were commonly referred to as the Nationalist Party, as were the organisations which developed from the Parnellite Split, the majority anti-Parnellite Irish National Federation and the rump Parnellite Irish National League. The Nationalist Party appellation was applied to the reunited Irish Parliamentary Party in 1900. It also covered smaller breakaway factions, such as those led by Tim Healy, D. D. Sheehan and William O'Brien. Some of its members were elected to D√°il √âireann in the early years of the Irish Free State as independents or for William Redmond's National League Party which was to merge into Cumann na nGaedheal. Bridget Redmond, William's wife, was elected in Waterford for Fine Gael until 1952. Nationalist Party (Northern Ireland) After the general election of 1918, the term Nationalist Party was taken on by the remnants of old Irish Parliamentary Party under Joseph Devlin as the Nationalist Party in the new creation of Northern Ireland. It developed a reputation for being heavily disorganised and being little more than a collection of elected members with their own local machines. Many calls were made for the party to develop an overall organisation but it fell apart in the late 1960s. The party was eventually subsumed into the Irish Independence Party in October 1977. The Party in Great Britain In addition to the organisations in Ireland outlined above, the term Nationalist Party was also used to describe the party run in Liverpool during the 1920s by T.P. O'Connor, MP for the Liverpool Scotland division. After O'Connor's death in 1929, no candidate stood in the ensuing by-election to succeed him in the Irish Nationalist interest.

Infos and history of Adlershof Adlershof page on www.berlin.de Adlershof is home to the new City of Science, Technology and Media (WISTA), located on the southwestern edge of the locality. History A part of the area known today as the \\"City of Science, Technology and Media\\", was once known as the Johannisthal Air Field. Germany's first motorized aircraft took off from here at the beginning of the 20th century. Albatros, Fokker, Rumpler and Wright made Adlershof-Johannisthal famous. In 1912 the German Experimental Institute for Aviation (Deutsche Versuchsanstalt f√ºr Luftfahrt ‚Äì DVL) made Adlershof its headquarters. Laboratories, motor test beds, wind tunnels and hangars were erected in the 20s and 30s and are historical landmarks today. =World War I= Adlershof is particularly well known for a series of competitions between various aviation firms' fighter aircraft designs that were held there starting in 1918. This was the first time the pilots themselves were asked for their input into the selection process; they resoundingly asked for higher speed as opposed to maneuverability, which the Idflieg had always assumed was most important. The first of these contests, held in January 1918, led to the Fokker D.VII winning the competition and going on to become one of Germany's most successful fighter planes. A second competition in May and June led to the acceptance of several of the main contest entries, the Pfalz D.XII, Fokker E.V, Junkers D.I and Siemens-Schuckert D.IV, the later of which is considered by many to be Germany's best design of the war. All three were put into production largely in order to make up for the slow production of the Fokkers, although only the Pfalz design could be found in any number. A final war-time contest in October was too late to have any effect on the war effort. Even after the war the process continued, with a fourth competition between February and May 1919, but the signing of the Versailles Treaty ended all military aircraft work in Germany and led to the dissolution of the Luftstreitkr√§fte in May 1920. =The East German era= After World War II, the airport was closed and from then on three institutions determined Adlershof's destiny: *The Ministry of State Security (MfS) stationed its 12,000 strong Guard Regiment there. *In 1952 East Germany's National Television began broadcasting from Adlershof. *And the East German Academy of Science was established with nine scientific institutes in the fields of physics and chemistry. \\"Scientific Equipment Engineering\\" with its approx. 1,700 workers developed and produced a majority of East Germany's research equipment. A substantial portion of the research done at the Academy institutes was notable for its close connection with the industry, allowing the scientists to engage in worldwide networks. Adlershof produced many known products and inventions, such as ultra-short pulse lasers, time-resolved optical spectroscopy and space diagnosis devices. Other things like trifocals and contraceptive pills were also invented here. In 1989 over 5,600 people were working in Adlershof, more than half the R&D; capacity of the whole Science Academy. =Reunification= Aerial view of the WISTA Science and Technology Park in Adlershof After German reunification, the guard regiment was dissolved and the fate of the Academy was sealed by the German Unification Treaty: The research facilities of the Academy were subjected to an evaluation marathon by the German Council of Science and Humanities (Wissenschaftsrat), which established that there were about 1,500 Academy employees who ought to be placed in new research structures. For the rest of the former employees, it was recommended that they either find new jobs or start their own companies. So of the 250 newly founded companies, approx 100 were founded by ex-academy workers. Today almost 90 per cent of the companies co-operate with at least one partner, and 60 per cent with three or more partners at the site. Eight of the 12 research institutes now located in Adlershof and financed by Berlin and the Federal Republic of Germany are directly descended from the former GDR Academy of Sciences at the beginning of 1992 and integrated into the Federal German research landscape. They continued their activity under the responsibility of other bodies for example under the Max Planck Society, or affiliated to large research establishments like the \\"Joint Initiative of Non- University Research Institutions in Adlershof ‚Äì IGAFA\\". =Development= Map of the development area \\"Wista Berlin-Adlershof\\" In September 1991 the State of Berlin founded the \\"Adlershof Development Society\\" (EGA), from which WISTA- MANAGEMENT GMBH emerged in 1994. In 1992 the Senate of Berlin decided to establish an \\"integrated scientific and business landscape\\" on the Adlershof site and made building investments amounting to about 230 million euros. The goal was to bring together the synergies from science and industry, innovation to market. To encourage innovative businesses to settle here, modern specialised centres were established on the premises, some in reconstructed old buildings, and others in new buildings with spectacular architecture. The first was the \\"Innovation and Business Incubation Centre\\" IGZ in 1991, followed by the Centre for Photonics and Optical Technologies, the Centre for Environmental, Bio and Energy Technology, the Centre for Information and Media Technology, and the Centre for Materials and Microsystems Technology. A Service-Centre and the East-West Co-operation Centre for Middle and Eastern European entrepreneurs top off the profile. Up to the end of the year 2000 WISTA-MANAGEMENT GMBH had made investments to the amount of approximately 325 million euros. =Prospects of the Humboldt campus= The BESSY and FIRST buildings at WISTA campus At the end of 1991 the decision was made to relocate the mathematics and natural science faculties of the Humboldt University of Berlin to Adlershof. In 1998 the Department of Computer Science moved to Adlershof, followed by the Departments of Mathematics in 2000, Chemistry in 2001, and Physics, Geography and Psychology in 2003. One of the most modern libraries in Europe, the new Information and Communication Centre \\"Erwin Schr√∂dinger-Zentrum\\", is a computing centre, library and a technology transfer point which can be used jointly by both university and non-university institutions alike. Adlershof is the location of Am Studio 20D, the venue for the European League of Legends Championship Series from 2015 to the present.

According to Gy√∂rgy Marx, he was one of The Martians.A marslak√≥k legend√°ja - Gy√∂rgy Marx Life Orowan was born in the √ìbuda district of Budapest. His father, Berthold (d. 1933), was a mechanical engineer and factory manager, and his mother, Josze (Josephine) Spitzer S√°gv√°ri, was the daughter of an impoverished land owner. In 1920 he went to the University of Vienna, where he studied chemistry for one year and astronomy for another. After six months of mandatory apprenticeship done home in Hungary, he was admitted to the Technical University of Berlin, where he studied mechanical and then electrical engineering. Eventually he started his own experiments in physics, where he was adopted as a student by Professor Richard Becker in 1928. In 1932 he completed his doctorate on the fracture of mica. Soon after Hitler's rise to power in 1933, Orowan, who was of partially Jewish descent, left for Hungary, where in 1934 he wrote the famous paper on dislocations. He had been doing the experiments, while still in Berlin, which supported the theory put forward in Becker's 1925 paper. In 1934, Orowan, roughly contemporarily with G. I. Taylor and Michael Polanyi, realized that the plastic deformation of ductile materials could be explained in terms of the theory of dislocations developed by Vito Volterra in 1905. Though the discovery was neglected until after World War II, it was critical in developing the modern science of solid mechanics. In Hungary he seems to have experienced some difficulty in finding immediate employment and spent the next few years living with his mother and ruminating on his doctoral research. From 1936-1939 he worked for the Tungsram light bulbs manufacturer, where, with the help of Mih√°ly (Michael) Polanyi, he developed a new process for the extraction of krypton from the air. In 1937, aware of the imminence of war, Orowan accepted the invitation of Rudolf Peierls and moved to the University of Birmingham, UK where they worked together on the theory of fatigue. In 1939 he moved to the University of Cambridge where William Lawrence Bragg inspired his interest in x-ray diffraction. During World War II, he worked on problems of munitions production, particularly that of plastic flow during rolling. In 1944, he was central to the reappraisal of the causes of the loss of many Liberty ships during the war, identifying the critical issues of the notch sensitivity of poor quality welds and the aggravating effects of the extreme low temperatures of the North Atlantic. In 1950, he moved to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where, in addition to continuing his metallurgical work, he developed his interests in geological and glacialogical fracture. In the latter study, Orowan developed the writings of the 14th century Tunisian historian Ibn Khaldun to forecast a supposed eventual failure of market demand similar to that claimed by Karl Marx. His ideas found little acceptance among the majority of economists. Throughout his life, he patented many inventions.

The contention is that the brave soldiers (lions) were sent to their deaths by incompetent and indifferent leaders (donkeys). The phrase was the source of the title of one of the most scathing examinations of British First World War generals, The Donkeys‚Äîa study of Western Front offensives‚Äîby politician and writer of military histories Alan Clark. The book typified the mainstream First World War history of the 1960s, was vetted by Basil Liddell Hart,Ion Trewin, Alan Clark: The Biography Weidenfeld & Nicolson 2009, p 160. and helped to form a popular view of the First World War (in the English-speaking world) in the decades that followed. However, the work's viewpoint of incompetent military leaders was never accepted by some mainstream historians, and both the book and its viewpoint have been criticised.  Origin The origin of the phrase pre-dates the First World War. Plutarch attributed to Chabrias the saying that \\"an army of deer commanded by a lion is more to be feared than an army of lions commanded by a deer\\".Plutarch, Regum et imperatorum apophthegmata 47.3 An ancient Arabian proverb says \\"An army of sheep led by a lion would defeat an army of lions led by a sheep\\". During the Crimean War, a letter was reportedly sent home by a British soldier quoting a Russian officer who had said that British soldiers were \\"lions commanded by donkeys\\". This was immediately after the failure to storm the fortress of Sevastopol which, if true, would take the saying back to 1854‚Äì55. The phrase is quoted in Anna Stoddart's 1906 book The Life of Isabella Bird in the scene where Isabella, en route for America in 1854, passes a troopship taking the Scot's Greys out to Balaclava. These and other Crimean War references were included in British Channel 4 television's The Crimean War series (1997) and the accompanying book (Michael Hargreave Mawson, expert reader). Karl Marx and Frederick Engels used the phrase on 27 September 1855, in an article published in Neue Oder-Zeitung, No. 457 (1 October 1855), on the British military's strategic mistakes and failings during the fall of Sevastopol, and particularly General James Simpson's military leadership of the assault on the Great Redan. The Times reportedly recycled the phrase as \\"lions led by donkeys\\" with reference to French soldiers during the Franco-Prussian War: There were numerous examples of its use during the First World War, referring to both the British and the Germans.Rees, Nigel. Brewer's Famous Quotations. Weidenfeld & Nicolson (2006) In Rising Sun and Tumbling Bear: Russia's War with Japan (2003), Richard Connaughton attributed a later quotation to Colonel J. M. Grierson (later Sir James Grierson) in 1901, when reporting on the Russian contingent to the Boxer Rebellion, describing them as 'lions led by asses'.Connaughton 2003, p. 32  More recent usage  In the Second World War Erwin Rommel said it about the British after he captured Tobruk.The Guinness History of the British Army (1993) by John Pimlott, p. 138 In early 2019, the hashtag #LedByDonkeys was coined by a Brexit campaign group that favours continued UK membership in the European Union.  Attribution  General Erich Ludendorff Evelyn, Princess Bl√ºcher, an Englishwoman who lived in Berlin during the First World War, in her memoir published in 1921, recalled hearing German general Erich Ludendorff praise the British for their bravery and remembered hearing firsthand the following statement from the German General Headquarters (Grosses Hauptquartier): \\"The English Generals are wanting in strategy. We should have no chance if they possessed as much science as their officers and men had of courage and bravery. They are lions led by donkeys.\\" The phrase Lions Led by Donkeys was used as a title for a book published in 1927, by Captain P. A. Thompson. The subtitle of this book was \\"Showing how victory in the Great War was achieved by those who made the fewest mistakes\\", Alan Clark based the title of his book The Donkeys (1961) on the phrase. Prior to publication in a letter to Hugh Trevor Roper, he asked \\"English soldiers, lions led by donkeys etc. ‚Äì can you remember who said that?\\" Liddell Hart, although he did not dispute the veracity of the quote, had asked Clark for its origins.Ion Trewin, Alan Clark: The Biography Weidenfeld & Nicolson 2009, p. 168 Whatever Trevor Roper's reply, Clark eventually used the phrase as an epigraph to The Donkeys and attributed it to a conversation between German generals Erich Ludendorff and Max Hoffmann: The conversation was supposedly published in the memoirs of General Erich von Falkenhayn, the Chief of the German General Staff of the German Army between 1914 and 1916, but the exchange and the memoirs remain untraced. A correspondent to The Daily Telegraph, in July 1963, wrote that librarians in London and Stuttgart had not traced the quotation and a letter to Clark was unanswered.Terraine, 1980, p. 170 Clark was equivocal about the source for the dialogue for many years, although in 2007 a friend Euan Graham, recalled a conversation in the mid- sixties, when Clark on being challenged as to the provenance of the dialogue, looked sheepish and said \\"well I invented it\\". At one time Clark claimed that Liddell Hart had given him the quote (unlikely as Hart had asked him where it came from) and Clark's biographer believes he invented the Ludendorff-Hoffmann attribution.Trewin 2009, pp. 182‚Äì189 This invention has provided an opportunity for critics of The Donkeys to condemn the work. Richard Holmes, wrote of The Donkeys:  Popular culture  The musical Oh, What a Lovely War! (1963) and the comedy television series Blackadder Goes Forth (1989) are two well-known works of popular culture, depicting the war as a matter of incompetent donkeys sending noble (or sometimes ignoble, in the case of Blackadder) lions to their doom. Such works are in the literary tradition of the war poets like Wilfred Owen, Siegfried Sassoon and Erich Maria Remarque's novel (and subsequent film) All Quiet on the Western Front, which have been criticised by some historians, such as Brian Bond, for having given rise to what Bond considered the myth and conventional wisdom of the \\"necessary and successful\\" Great War as futile. Bond objected to the way that, in the 1960s, the works of Remarque and the \\"Trench Poets\\" slipped into a \\"nasty caricature\\" and perpetuated the \\"myth\\" of lions led by donkeys, while \\"the more complicated true history of the war receded ... into the background\\". Producers of television documentaries about the war have had to grapple with the \\"lions led by donkeys\\" interpretive frame since the 1960s. The 1964 seminal and award-winning BBC Television The Great War has been described as taking a moderate approach, with co-scriptwriter John Terraine fighting against what he viewed as an oversimplification, while Liddell Hart resigned as an advising historian to the series, in an open letter to The Times, in part over a dispute with Terraine, claiming that he minimised the faults of the High Command on The Somme and other concerns regarding the treatment of Third Ypres. The Great War was viewed by about a fifth of the adult population in Britain and the production of documentaries on the war has continued ever since. While recent documentaries such as Channel 4's 2003 The First World War have confronted the popular image of lions led by donkeys, by reflecting current scholarship presenting more nuanced portrayals of British leaders and more balanced appraisals of the difficulties faced by the High Commands of all the combatants, they have been viewed by far fewer members the public than either 1964's The Great War or comedies such as Blackadder. The name of British anti-Brexit political campaign group Led By Donkeys was inspired by the saying. The activists thought it described the relationship between the British people and their Brexit leaders well.  Criticism  Brian Bond, in editing a 1991 collection of essays on First World War history, expressed the collective desire of the authors to move beyond \\"popular stereotypes of The Donkeys\\", while acknowledging that serious leadership mistakes were made and that the authors would do little to rehabilitate the reputations of the senior commanders on the Somme. Hew Strachan quoted Maurice Genevoix for the proposition \\"[i]f it is neither desirable nor good that the professional historian prevail over the veteran; it is also not good that the veteran prevail over the historian\\" and then proceeded to take Liddell Hart to task for \\"suppressing the culminating battles of the war\\", thus \\"allow[ing] his portrayal of British generals to assume an easy continuum, from incompetence on the Western Front to conservatism in the 1920s....\\" While British leadership at the beginning of the war made costly mistakes, by 1915‚Äì16 the General Staff were making great efforts to lessen British casualties through better tactics (night attacks, creeping barrages and air power) and weapons technology (poison gas and later the arrival of the tank). British generals were not the only ones to make mistakes about the nature of modern conflict: the Russian armies too suffered badly during the first years of the war, most notably at the Battle of Tannenberg. To many generals who had fought colonial wars during the second half of the 19th century, where the Napoleonic concepts of discipline and pitched battles were still successful, fighting another highly industrialized power with equal and sometimes superior technology required an extreme change in thinking. Later, Strachan, in reviewing Aspects of the British experience of the First World War edited by Michael Howard, observed that \\"In the study of the First World War in particular, the divide between professionals and amateurs has never been firmly fixed\\". Strachan points out that revisionists take strong exception to the amateurs, particularly in the media, with whom they disagree, while at the same time Gary Sheffield welcomes to the revisionist cause the work of many \\"hobby\\"-ists who only later migrated to academic study.Hew Strachan Back to the trenches ‚Äì Why can't British historians be less insular about the First World War? The Sunday Times November 5, 2008 Gordon Corrigan, for example, did not even consider Clark to be a historian.Corrigan, p. 213. \\"Alan Clark was an amusing writer, a brilliant story teller and bon viveur. British political life is the poorer for his passing, but he cannot be described as a historian\\". The phrase \\"lions led by donkeys\\" has been said to have produced a false, or at least very incomplete, picture of generalship in the First World War, giving an impression of Generals as \\"ch√¢teau Generals\\", living in splendour, indifferent to the sufferings of the men under their command, only interested in cavalry charges and shooting cowards. One historian wrote that \\"the idea that they were indifferent to the sufferings of their men is constantly refuted by the facts, and only endures because some commentators wish to perpetuate the myth that these generals, representing the upper classes, did not give a damn what happened to the lower orders\\". Some current academic opinion has described this school of thought as \\"discredited\\".Simpson, Andy, Directing Operations: British Corps Command on the Western Front, p. 181.Sheffield, Gary. The Somme, pp. xiv‚Äìxv. Strachan quotes Gavin Stamp, who bemoans \\"a new generation of military historians\\", who seem as \\"callous and jingoistic\\" as Haig, while himself referring to the \\"ill-informed diatribes of Wolff and Clark\\".

Commentaries can be serious or entertaining in nature, and can add information which otherwise would not be disclosed to audience members. Types of commentary The DVD medium allows multiple audio tracks for each video program. DVD players usually allow these to be selected by the viewer from the main menu of the DVD or using the remote. These tracks will contain dialogue and sound of the movie, often with alternative tracks featuring different language dialogue, or various types of audio encoding (such as Dolby Digital, DTS or PCM). Among them may be at least one commentary track. There are several different types of commentary. The two main types simply define the length of the commentary rather than the type of content. They are: *Partial or scene-specific, which only covers selected scenes of the film. Sometimes these are recorded without the speaker viewing the film and thus the commentator may make more general comments than pointing out specific details. *Feature-length or screen-specific, which is recorded in one session: the speakers watch the movie from beginning to end and give their thoughts directly based on what is happening on-screen. Typically a commentary track will include feature-length commentary from the film's director, cast members, or occasionally writers and producers. Occasionally actors will perform commentary in-character. (In recording sessions with multiple speakers, a designated moderator may encourage the discussion flow.) Some DVDs include outsider commentary performed by film critics, historians, scholars or fans. In more elaborate productions, multiple speakers from various recording sessions may be edited together for a single audio program. Some DVDs feature commentaries with on-screen video enhancements, such as telestrator prompts, (allowing the director or commentator to \\"draw\\" on the screen, pointing out specific details), or the Ghostbusters \\"video commentary\\", where one of the subtitle tracks is used to add silhouettes of the speakers in a manner where they seem to be in a theater commenting on the movie as it was screened for them in the style of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Less common are actual video commentaries, showing the speakers as they are recording the commentary, requiring separate video tracks. History The value of audio commentaries as a marketing tool was revealed during the heyday of Laserdisc, the laser- based video format produced before the introduction of DVDs. The Criterion Collection company, for example, produced high-quality \\"deluxe\\" editions of classic films on Laserdisc, using the best available prints and re-edited versions. These were often very expensive compared to today's DVDs and included bonus material such as trailers, deleted scenes, production stills, behind-the-scenes information, and audio commentaries from the directors, producers, cast, cinematographers, editors, and production designers. They were marketed to movie professionals, fans and scholars who were seen as an elite niche of consumers who could afford to pay more for definitive, quality editions. The audio commentaries on laserdiscs were typically encoded on secondary analog tracks which had become redundant, as modern Laserdiscs had stereo audio encoded digitally alongside. This is why certain older videodisc players, which pre-date the digital audio standard, are only able to play back analog tracks with audio commentary. The first audio commentary was featured on the Criterion Collection release of the original King Kong film, on laserdisc in December 1984. It featured film historian Ronald Haver and his first words were: The idea for the commentary track arose in the film-to-tape transfer room when laserdisc producers, Peter Crown and Jennifer Scanlin of Romulus Productions, Inc., thrilled by Haver's incredible commentary, suggested to Bob Stein and Roger Smith that this material needed to be included on the disc. They played back the completed movie as Ron watched and ad libbed his comments. The decline of the Laserdisc format and the increasing popularity of DVD was highlighted in the fall of 1997, when simultaneous Laserdisc and DVD editions of the movie Contact were released. The former contained one bonus audio commentary track by director Robert Zemeckis, and producer Steve Starkey. However, the DVD contained two additional, separate audio commentaries (by Jodie Foster and the special effects producers), as well as other bonus features. Despite its history with laserdiscs, the idea of audio commentary was still such an uncommon notion that, in its January 1998 review of the Contact DVD, Entertainment Weekly scoffed, \\"Who in the universe would want to journey through more than eight hours of gassy, how-we-filmed- the-nebulae trivia included in this \\"Special Edition\\" disc? Meant to show off DVD's enormous storage capacity, it only demonstrates its capacity to accommodate mountains of filler.\\" In general, directors are open to recording commentary tracks, as many feel it can be helpful to young filmmakers, or they simply want to explain their intention in making the film. Eli Roth, for example, specifically states on the producer's commentary track for The Last Exorcism, that he and the other filmmakers will offer advice to people interested in making films, as well as film school students. He is a strong proponent of the educational use of audio commentary, having recorded five commentary tracks for his debut, Cabin Fever. He also recorded insightful commentary tracks, with Quentin Tarantino, for both Hostel films, in which the two horror movie fans share film-making anecdotes and offer advice on working in the movie business. Meanwhile, others (such as Steven Spielberg, Joe Johnston, Clint Eastwood, M. Night Shyamalan & David Lynch) feel commentary can de-mystify and cheapen a movie. Director Steven Spielberg has not recorded commentary tracks for any of his films. He feels that the experience of watching a film with anything other than his intended soundtrack detracts from what he has created. Woody Allen has a similar lack of enthusiasm for commentaries, stating, \\"I'm not interested in all that extra stuff. [...] I want my films to speak for themselves. And hopefully they do.\\"Total Film: Woody Allen interview Similarity, some of Joe Johnston's movies handled commentary by the special effects team (like Jurassic Park III and Jumanji), and by the author (October Sky). The only exception to this rule was Captain America: The First Avenger. Notable DVD audio commentaries A number of films and music videos released today feature audio commentaries. While many of them will not hold the interest of the casual viewer, specific releases stand out, mainly those with elements of historical interest or subject- specific information from expert advisors. For example, the inventor of the steadicam, featured throughout the audio commentary track for The Shining, discusses his work with the ground-breaking technology in several films leading up to that landmark production. Non-movie buffs may be interested in the anecdotes offered by advisors to the filmmakers, such as the FBI profiler commenting on The Silence of the Lambs (Criterion DVD release). Filmmakers and cast may reveal stories from behind the scenes, explain the process involved in their work, or simply offer additional laughs. = Films = * The science- fiction movie Sunshine (directed by Danny Boyle) contains an audio track with physicist Brian Cox. The author and professor, who served as an advisor on the production, discusses scientific accuracies (and inaccuracies) depicted in the movie. * The 2009 Blu-ray edition of the film Galaxy Quest includes a tongue- in-cheek trivia commentary called \\"Galactopedia\\". Written by Michael Okuda and Denise Okuda, the Galactopedia purports to be based on Galaxy Quest encyclopedias, technical manuals, and other imaginary books that presumably come from the universe in which Galaxy Quest was a real TV show. * The Halestorm Entertainment movie Sons of Provo features a commentary on the film, and then a commentary on the commentary, where they discuss what they said in the commentary. * The DVD release of Ghostbusters contains a \\"video commentary\\" track with director Ivan Reitman, writer/star Harold Ramis, and associate producer Joe Medjuck. Silhouettes of the trio were added to the picture using one of the subtitle tracks, in a manner that made it seem as if they were sitting in a theater commenting on the movie as it was screened for them. This was seen as a homage to (or imitation of) Mystery Science Theater 3000. In some scenes, arrows, lines, or circles may be drawn onto the screen to highlight things the directors are talking about. The DVD releases of Men in Black and Muppets from Space had similar features. * The DVD release of Fantasia features two separate commentaries: one by Roy E. Disney, James Levine, John Canemaker, and Scott MacQueen; and a second by Walt Disney, created using audio clips of interviews and a voice actor reading his production meeting notes, hosted by Canemaker. When its sequel, Fantasia 2000, was released on DVD, it also included two separate audio commentaries: One featuring Roy E. Disney, Levine, and Canemaker, and the other featuring commentary on each of the separate segments of the film by the directors and art directors of each segment. For the sections starring Mickey Mouse (\\"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\\") and Donald Duck (\\"Pomp and Circumstance\\"), voice actors Wayne Allwine and Tony Anselmo were used to make it seem as though Mickey and Donald were providing their own commentary on their appearances in the film. * The DVD releases for Atlantis: The Lost Empire (Special Edition), Treasure Planet and Finding Nemo contained specially-edited \\"video commentaries\\"; the feature-length audio commentaries by the directors and producers were punctuated by cues to video segments illustrating various behind-the-scenes aspects. Similarly, in several commentaries on the first season of Lost, the commentators would actually stop the episode's progress and play behind-the-scenes clips, continuing to talk over the footage. *The DVD release of the third season of How I Met Your Mother includes a commentary by Jason Segel and Chris Harris for the episode \\"The Chain of Screaming\\". Harris, a writer on the show, did not write this particular episode, but was included in the commentary at the request of Segel, who spent the majority of the commentary intoxicated and in only his boxers. Segel at one point places 12 condoms on the table between the two and spends the majority of the commentary insinuating a relationship between him and Harris, much to Harris' chagrin. * The 2000 DVD of This Is Spinal Tap features a commentary by the three members of the band, in character. They relate how they felt slighted by the film, and how the director (Marty di Bergi in the film) did a \\"hack job\\" with the documentary. The commentary is another added element to the fiction of the band. Actors Michael McKean, Christopher Guest and Harry Shearer had previously recorded a commentary for a Criterion Collection DVD which had gone out of print. Similarly, the DVD of series 1 of the BBC sitcom I'm Alan Partridge features commentary from the characters of Alan and his assistant, Lynne. Like Spinal Tap, Alan is heard to be frustrated at how the show makes him appear. * The Ultimate Matrix Collection, a box set of the entire Matrix trilogy, has two audio commentaries on each film ‚Äî one by philosophers who loved it (Dr. Cornel West and Ken Wilber), and one by critics who hated it (Todd McCarthy, John Powers and David Thomson). * The commentary on Trey Parker's Cannibal! The Musical (aka Alferd Packer: The Musical) is notable in that the commentators ‚Äî cast and crew ‚Äî start out sober at the beginning. As the movie progresses, the group drinks and gets more and more inebriated. A similar commentary, featuring many of the participants from that commentary, was recorded for Orgazmo. * The fourth, fifth and sixth season box sets of The Simpsons contain special \\"illustrated commentaries\\" on selected episodes, where two animation directors draw on screen while commenting on the episode. This is achieved by using subtitle data to produce the drawings overlaid on top of the video in sync with the audio commentary track. * The Simpsons and Futurama, both Matt Groening creations, are among the few TV series to have audio commentary tracks on every episode in their season box set DVD releases. For Futurama, the commentators point out who voiced minor characters. The actors for these characters are otherwise unlisted in the ending credits. Doctor Who, Mr. Show, Red Dwarf, volumes 4 and onwards of Family Guy, the first season sets of Twin Peaks, The Shield and Goodnight Sweetheart and all episodes and specials of The League of Gentlemen are other examples of this. * The commentary for Eurotrip has the writers and director playing a drinking game to their own film, while giving a commentary. * When the first season of Veronica Mars was rushed to DVD so first-time viewers could catch up before the second season began airing in Fall 2005, the creator, Rob Thomas, recorded an audio commentary for the pilot which was a downloadable podcast because there was not time to get it on the boxed set. * In lieu of recording a commentary himself, Michael Moore allowed his interns and secretary to record the audio commentary for his documentary Bowling for Columbine. * On the DVD release of Shaun of the Dead, one (of the four) commentary tracks is given over entirely to a recording of the actors who played zombies in the movie. The first cast audio commentary (including Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Kate Ashfield, Lucy Davis and Dylan Moran) also mocks audio commentaries as the cast admit that they almost never listen to them (with Pegg claiming he listens to them when going to sleep), as well as Moran saying that they simply involve people saying things like \\"oh, we used a steadi-cam for that one because Roger had a bad knee\\", and that no-one was interested in hearing it. * There is a fake commentary on the DVD of Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story with Rawson Marshall Thurber, Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller arguing. 40 minutes into it, all three exit and the commentary is replaced with the audio commentary from There's Something About Mary. The real audio commentary can be found as an Easter egg on the DVD. * On the audio commentaries for seasons of The Venture Bros., Jackson Publick and Doc Hammer have conversations that have little to do with the episodes being shown. * On the cast and crew commentary for Superbad, Judd Apatow orders the actors not to swear in front of his nine- year-old daughter Maude, who is also present for the recording. Actor Jonah Hill restrains himself from cursing until halfway through the movie, and he proceeds to chide Apatow for \\"Bring Your Daughter to Work Day.\\" After this argument, Apatow and his daughter leave to go attend a showing of the Broadway musical Spamalot, and the remaining cast and crew begin swearing profusely immediately after their departure. * The cast commentary of Tropic Thunder features Ben Stiller and Jack Black as themselves, while Robert Downey, Jr. is in character as Lincoln Osiris, and later Kirk Lazarus, before dropping character at the end. This is a reference to a line spoken in the film by Lazarus: \\"I don't drop character 'til I've done the DVD commentary.\\" * The unrated DVD for Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy contains a commentary track where the director Adam McKay, Will Ferrell, and David Koechner get into a fight because Koechner thinks he had too little parts in the movie, and Andy Richter and Kyle Gass get into a fight because they did not get into the movie, leading one of them to punch Ferrell in the nose. * The commentary track for Step Brothers features the director Adam McKay, Will Ferrell, and John C. Reilly doing the bulk of the commentary as a musical performance accompanied by film composer Jon Brion and Los Angeles Clippers player Baron Davis. * The audio commentary for Brother Bear was not by the filmmakers, but the actors Dave Thomas and Rick Moranis in character as the wise-cracking comical moose, Rutt & Tuke. It is also written as 'hilarious' on the DVD cover. * The 2007 DVD for The Fountain did not include a commentary track because Warner Bros. did not feel that adding one would help sales. However, director Darren Aronofsky recorded a commentary track on his own and made the track available for free download on his personal website. * In the DVD commentary for the first four series of the revived series of Doctor Who, any commentary featuring head writer Russell T Davies would begin with Davies stating \\"Hello faithful viewer\\". In the \\"Utopia\\" commentary, he humorously relayed to David Tennant that he had received a letter from a viewer asking him to stop doing this. However, Davies refused to do so and afterwards Tennant began using the phrase a lot himself. * The special edition DVD of Child's Play did not feature any contributions from the director, Tom Holland, who claims he was not asked to contribute to it. In response, the website Icons of Fright contacted Holland and asked if he would be willing to record a commentary track that would be free for download on their website. He agreed, and the track is downloadable from here. * Similarly, Icons of Fright offers two free downloadable commentaries for Fright Night, downloadable from here. * Jonah: A VeggieTales Movie has 3 commentaries - voice actors/writers/directors Phil Vischer and Mike Nawrocki, producer Ameake Owens and art director Marc Vulcano, and Vischer and Nawrocki in character as Mr. Lunt and Larry the Cucumber respectively. = Music = * The 2005 DVD of \\"Schism\\" from Tool, contains dual-commentary by David Yow. In-theater audio commentary Kevin Smith coined the idea of in-theater audio commentary, going to see a movie at the theater, and after having downloaded onto one's iPod a podcast of an audio commentary, returning to the theater a second time to watch the movie while listening to the commentary at the same time. As of right now, a few films have attempted to utilize this idea, including Smith's Clerks II, The Nines by writer/director John August, and Rian Johnson's The Brothers Bloom, Looper and Knives Out. August's blog lists \\"rules and guidelines\\" for how to use in- theater commentary. Kevin Smith first recorded a commentary track for Clerks II around May 2006 a few months before its theatrical release that was to be downloaded through iTunes and listened to in the theaters, which was meant to appeal primarily to Smith's hardcore DVD-purchasing fan base. Theater owners, however, felt that allowing people to bring outside devices would be distracting and disrupting to other audience members. The commentary track was not released for download while the movie was in theaters and was instead included on the 2-disc Clerks II DVD. The commentary track features Kevin Smith along with producer Scott Mosier and actor, Jeff Anderson. An audio commentary track for The Nines featuring John August along with actor Ryan Reynolds was posted in m4a and mp3 formats onto August's blog. This film had a considerably more limited release than Clerks II, featured in only 5 theaters in the U.S. Prolific commentators * Novelist and film historian Tim Lucas has recorded close to 100 audio commentaries since his first, for Mario Bava's Black Sunday in 1999. His varied output includes such titles as Alfred Hitchcock's Lifeboat (which won a 2018 Saturn Award for Best DVD/Blu-ray extra), the British Film Institute's set of five films by Alain Robbe-Grillet, and Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy, as well as numerous titles by Mario Bava and Jes√∫s Franco. * Hong Kong action cinema expert Bey Logan was a popular commentator for UK DVD distributors Hong Kong Legends and their sister label Premier Asia. He has recorded over sixty commentaries for Asian films, including Fist of Fury, Project A and The Young Master as well as modern hits Iron Monkey, Musa and Ong Bak. For the majority of his commentaries Logan was a solo commentator but occasionally he was joined by notable film makers and cast including Tsui Hark, Christy Chung, Donnie Yen and Maggie Q. He left Hong Kong Legends for The Weinstein Company in early 2006. * U.S. film historian Rudy Behlmer has recorded commentaries for many classics of American cinema, most notably Casablanca, Gone with the Wind, The Adventures of Robin Hood and Frankenstein. * U.S. film critic Roger Ebert has recorded DVD audio commentaries for many films, including Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Floating Weeds, Crumb, Dark City, and Beyond the Valley of the Dolls (for which Ebert also wrote the screenplay, based on a story that he co-wrote with Russ Meyer). Since losing his ability to speak due to illness, these recordings were also used to supply Ebert's collection of spoken words for his speech synthesizer since the soundtracks of his television show were too contaminated by background noise to use. * U.S. film critic Richard Schickel has recorded DVD audio commentaries for many classic films, including Double Indemnity, Whirlpool, Side Street, Strangers on a Train, On the Waterfront, East of Eden, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Ryan's Daughter, Dirty Harry, The Big Red One, Once Upon a Time in America, and Unforgiven. * U.S. writer and director Peter Bogdanovich has not only recorded commentaries for his own films (The Last Picture Show, The Cat's Meow, Paper Moon) but has also recorded commentaries for classic U.S. films, including Bringing Up Baby, Citizen Kane, The Lady from Shanghai, and Strangers on a Train. He also participated in the commentary for the pilot episode of The Sopranos. * Matt Groening, creator of The Simpsons, has recorded commentary on most episodes of the show thus far released on DVD ‚Äî , seasons one through ten ‚Äî as well as every episode of his other creation, Futurama. , this totals over 250 episode commentaries. He has also provided commentaries on other Simpsons/Futurama related products, such as the music videos on The Simpsons: Season Two DVD. David X. Cohen, Groening's co-developer and occasional writer on Futurama, also provided commentary on every episode, as well as several installments of The Simpsons. * Film directors Kevin Smith and David Fincher are notable fans of DVD audio commentary, and Fincher's \\"Platinum Series\\" release of Se7en was considered one of the most in-depth DVDs of its time, mainly due to the four audio commentary tracks, all of which feature Fincher, and cover the writing, the cast, the sound design and the cinematography. Another commentary for Se7en was included on the Criterion Collection laserdisc, which included cast member Gwyneth Paltrow, but this track has not been released on DVD. Smith's DVD for Clerks II features three audio commentaries, all featuring Smith, and he is known for bringing his stars, including Ben Affleck and Jason Lee onto his commentary tracks. Smith has recorded audio commentaries for all of his films except Zack and Miri Make a Porno, and also appeared on the Road House audio commentary after mentioning it on the 10th Anniversary DVD of Clerks. Smith has also appeared on the special edition Donnie Darko DVD, doing commentary with Richard Kelly. Fincher has recorded a track for all of his films except Alien 3, which he disowned after controversy over the production. Directors Terry Gilliam, Werner Herzog, Francis Ford Coppola, David Cronenberg, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Soderbergh are also highly respected as intelligent and informative commentators, often working with Criterion to create commentaries for their films. Soderbergh once said about DVD commentaries, \\"Would I, growing up, like to have had access to stuff on DVDs like this? Oh God, yeah! It's better than any film school, I think.\\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001752/bio * Animation historians such as Jerry Beck and Michael Barrier regularly contribute commentary to selected shorts in DVD packages of animated shorts from the Golden Age of Hollywood, including the Looney Tunes Golden Collection series and the Popeye the Sailor DVD series. * Ken Annakin's audio commentary for his 1965 classic Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines holds a record for having one of the oldest surviving directors to commentate on a film. In addition to the commentary during the film, Annakin speaks on nearly 3 hours of back up material on the old classic airplanes that many fans consider the real stars of the film. Alternate commentaries Originally inspired by a column by Roger Ebert, a small but active fan base of DVD commentary enthusiasts has sprung up since 2002 offering their own specially-recorded fan-made DVD commentaries. These tracks (usually made available in MP3 format) allow the fans to put forth their own opinions and expertise on a movie or TV series in much the same way as an on-disc commentary. These commentary tracks are played by starting a DVD player with the movie and an MP3 player with the track simultaneously. A substantial community of fan commentators exists,Cataloged extensively at Zarban's House of Commentaries . creating many hundreds of downloadable tracks available on the Web. The idea of downloadable commentary tracks has since been co-opted by TV show creators themselves, as creators of TV shows such as the 2004 Battlestar Galactica, Star Trek: Enterprise, and the Doctor Who revival have recorded downloadable commentary tracks meant to be watched along with the episodes as recorded from TV. Mystery Science Theater 3000 head writer and on-screen host Michael J. Nelson has started his own website to sell downloadable commentaries called RiffTrax. He also regularly commentates on the public domain films that colorizing company Legend Films releases on DVD, including Night of the Living Dead and Reefer Madness. Critiques and parodies of the audio commentary The Audio Commentary has been a subject of discussion among filmmakers. Many directors see them as an unnecessary bonus feature, while others record \\"fake\\" commentaries, which may contain false information or inside jokes. Other filmmakers have parodied the commentary concept, as the following examples demonstrate. * The Coen Brothers movie Blood Simple has a fake commentary written by the Coens and read by an actor posing as a film historian. This \\"historian\\", Kenneth Loring, gives information about the production that almost everyone would recognize as being totally ludicrous. He claims, for instance, that one the opening scene was shot upside down with the actors saying their lines backwards and that some roles were reserved for Rosemary Clooney and Gene Kelly. * In an episode of The Simpsons (\\"The Bart Wants What It Wants\\"), Bart is watching an Itchy & Scratchy DVD and decides to turn the commentary on. A small box appears at the corner of the screen, showing Scratchy (\\"We shot this at four in the morning, and the crew was getting a little cranky\\") and Itchy (\\"You can never get enough takes for Steven Soderbergh\\"); midway through Scratchy's next sentence, Itchy cuts off his head. * Welsh comedian Rob Brydon starred in the ITV comedy show Director's Commentary (2004) in which he played a fictional director, Peter De Lane, and parodied the often conceited and pompous nature of directors when giving DVD commentaries by articulating his thoughts over archive footage. Although the show was well received, it did not sustain viewer interest, and only one six-episode season was produced. * The book Speak, Commentary, by Jeff Alexander and Tom Bissell, collects a series of fake audio commentaries purportedly made by well-known American cultural critics and political pundits on popular science fiction and fantasy movies. The contents include Ann Coulter on Ridley Scott's Alien, as well as Noam Chomsky and Howard Zinn on Peter Jackson's films of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. * The DVD and Blu-ray for the musical web series Dr. Horrible's Sing- Along Blog contains two commentary tracks; one of which comprises an entirely second musical titled Commentary! The Musical, in which they parody the concept of both DVD commentaries and musicals in general. In addition to songs by the main cast members (often parodying their own public personas or each others), it includes numbers by unnamed extras in the film, and a song explaining how the 2007‚Äì2008 Writers Guild of America strike led to the creation of the web series. * The Adam and Joe Show parodied audio commentaries in a sketch which stated that audio commentaries often sound like \\"self indulgent wankers in a pub\\". * Webtoon Homestar Runner has featured the characters of the H*R universe doing commentaries for many of their cartoons. Most notably The King of Town DVD, In Search of the Yello Dello and the music video for They Might Be Giants' \\"Experimental Film.\\" * Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy contains audio commentary where the actors end up discussing very little of the film's content. * Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby features a commentary in which director Adam McKay fabricates nearly every piece of information about the film, such as the production's move to Brazil, the roles of Walker and Texas Ranger being played by robots, and that the original cut of the film was 9¬Ω hours long and contained a segment of a stick of butter. * Monty Python's The Meaning of Life features a fake commentary titled \\"Soundtrack for the Lonely: A Soundtrack for People Watching at Home Alone.\\" It consists of a rather disgusting man played by Michael Palin who burps, yawns, flatulates, and talks under his breath while he watches the film at his flat. Throughout the commentary, he calls his friends (played by Terry Jones and Eric Idle) by telephone. * The Hot Fuzz 3-disc collector's edition DVD includes a commentary featuring real policemen and a commentary in which director Edgar Wright and fellow filmmaker Quentin Tarantino discuss nearly 200 films and television series but barely make reference to Hot Fuzz. *In an episode of the series King of the Hill, Bobby listens to the audio commentary of a fictional film. The film's director remarks that \\"the sky wasn't sad enough\\" for the scene. *In the American Dad! episode \\"Bullocks to Stan\\", the fish character Klaus Heissler purposely begins to audibly give a commentary on the events of the episode; when Roger asks what he's doing, he says that he is acting as if the characters lives were on a DVD and he is the expert giving commentary on it. Near the end of the episode, his commentary can be heard over the events of the climactic fight between Stan and Bullock, despite the fact that Klaus is not present at this event like he is at previous events he comments on in the episode; he claims that the 'actor' playing the busboy was killed during the making of the episode, and at one point apologizes for talking over what he claims is the funniest line in the episode. ** The actual audio commentary for the episode mentions the joke that Klaus talked out was Stan saying \\"Kirk was a much better captain,\\" Bullock saying \\"What,\\" and Stan replying \\"Nothing\\". *In the film Tropic Thunder, Robert Downey, Jr. plays an actor who refuses to break character until he completes the DVD commentary, and in the DVD commentary for the film, Downey indeed remains in character. * Detective Pikachu includes a \\"Mr. Mime Audio Commentary\\", where he presents himself and shows he is going to make an audio commentary about the interrogation scene of the movie. However, it only plays the entire scene, and in the end, he expresses himself by the fact that since he cannot talk, the audio commentary plan was not the smartest idea.  Commentary re-use  Some film companies transfer the audio commentary of the laserdisc release of a film on to the DVD rather than creating a new one. For example, El Mariachi Special Edition, Total Recall Special Edition, Spaceballs and A Nightmare on Elm Street all contain the commentary from the laserdisc release. This may be for financial reasons, depending on whether the rights to the original commentary are cheaper to use than recording a new one (a company releasing a film on DVD today may not be the same company who released it on laserdisc); or it could simply be that the original commentary does its job well without the need for an update. Contrastingly, some DVDs do not have a commentary even though the laserdisc release did (for example, Taxi Driver). This may be because the parties involved have not reached a publication agreement. The audio commentaries of The Criterion Collection are often considered some of the finest and most informative commentaries ever made, and the Laserdisc releases of classic films can be highly priced because Criterion generally did not license their commentaries for use on later DVDs when the rights to films they have release revert to the studio, including the aforementioned Taxi Driver. But commentaries like that now appear on the Blu- ray versions of films. Other notables include the commentary for The Silence of the Lambs (featuring stars Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins, along with director Jonathan Demme) and Terry Gilliam's tracks for The Adventures of Baron Munchausen and The Fisher King. In addition, the fact that Criterion have been commissioning commentaries since 1984 means that commentaries exist by film makers who died before the advent of DVD, such as Michael Powell. Notes 1\\\\. Director Barry Sonnenfeld recorded audio+telestrator commentaries for Men in Black II and RV.  Commentary exclusive to LaserDisc  Some commentaries that were issued on Laserdisc have not been reissued or replaced on DVD. Sometimes this is because there was a deluxe LD edition while there has only been a bare bones release on DVD, for example The Fisher King. In the case of the first three James Bond movies, Dr. No, From Russia with Love, and Goldfinger, the commentary was once released on LaserDisc but quickly judged inappropriate, never to return (new commentary tracks are on the DVD editions). The commentaries are available to download at The 007 Dossier. Video games Some video games, such as the episodic sequels to Half-Life 2 and Tomb Raider: Anniversary, have experimented with audio commentaries. Unlike DVD commentaries, the systems used for video games do not use a predetermined continuous flow of speech, because the events of a game depend on the player's actions. Instead, in-game prompts are used to allow players to activate a relevant audio commentary for a specific area. The camera and action may also be altered to more readily showcase the developer's comments. =List of video games with audio commentary= *2000 **Star Wars Episode I: Battle for Naboo, believed to be the earliest video game with audio commentary and the only known game cartridge with audio commentary. *2001 **Star Wars Rogue Squadron II: Rogue Leader *2002 **Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus *2004 **The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay (PC version and as downloadable content for the Xbox 360 version) *2005 **Half-Life 2: Lost Coast **Stubbs the Zombie *2006 **Half-Life 2: Episode One *2007 **Half-Life 2: Episode Two **Portal **Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destruction **Team Fortress 2 **Tomb Raider: Anniversary **flOw *2008 **Left 4 Dead **Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots *2009 **Left 4 Dead 2 **Flower *2010 ** Alan Wake **Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge Special Edition (original game released in 1991) **Amnesia: The Dark Descent *2011 **Portal 2 *2012 **Journey *2013 **Deus Ex Human Revolution Director's Cut **Gone Home *2014 **The Last of Us Remastered *2015 **Grim Fandango Remastered (original game released in 1998) *2016 **Day of the Tentacle Remastered (original game released in 1993) **BioShock: The Collection **Firewatch (\\"Audio Tour\\" mode released as free downloadable content) **Duke Nukem 3D: 20th Anniversary World Tour (original game released in 1996) References External links *Rate That Commentary: Website devoted to user-submitted ratings and reviews of DVD audio commentary tracks. *Commentary Tracks of the Damned: A feature of The Onion's A.V.

It is situated north of Stanley and Annfield Plain, close to the River Derwent and is 564 feet above sea level. There are around 4,553 inhabitants in Burnopfield. It is located 10 miles from Newcastle upon Tyne and 15 miles from Durham. Etymology The name Burnopfield probably comes from the Old English meaning \\"field by the valley stream\\", although local legend says that the village got its name after an attempted Scottish invasion of England was foiled by literally burning up the fields to stop the advancing armies. In the 19th century, Burnopfield was usually referred to as the Leap, or in local dialect, as the Loup, after the area of Burnopfield named Bryan's Leap. History Gibside Hall Burnopfield was the site of a leper hospital, High Friarside Hospice, which was founded in 1312, but was demolished in approximately 1450. The remains of the original chapel can still be seen today. Other historical buildings in Burnopfield include Burnopfield Hall, which was constructed in 1720 by the Newton family, a wealthy mine-owning family, Leap Mill Farm, a classic example of an 18th- century mill with a working water wheel, and the Gibside estate, which is located between Burnopfield and Rowlands Gill. Andrew Robinson Stoney The families of Burnopfield Hall and Gibside are linked by the scandalous adventurer Andrew Robinson Stoney: in the late 1760s, Hannah Newton, daughter and heiress to the Newton family fortune, married Stoney, an Irish Lieutenant and adventurer who was stationed in Newcastle. They went to live at Colepike Hall in Lanchester, where his ill-treatment of her became a local scandal, and within a few years she died. In control of her ¬£20,000 fortune, he set off for London, where he met the widowed Countess of Strathmore, who owned the Gibside estate. Stoney eventually tricked her into marriage, and having to adopt her family name of Bowes, became the notorious Stoney Bowes. Her subsequent miserable life with him became one of the biggest scandals of the period. His story was fictionalised by William Makepeace Thackeray in The Luck of Barry Lyndon. Stanley Kubrick later adapted the novel into the 1975 film Barry Lyndon. The family at Gibside Hall eventually became the Bowes-Lyon family, one member of the family being Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. The hall itself is now owned by the National Trust. In 1815, J. M. W. Turner produced several landscapes of Gibside Hall, which are on display in the Tate Britain.http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/turner-gibside-tw0008 In 1746, John Wesley visited the village, and preached in a garden in Sheep Hill, an area within Burnopfield. He made several more visits, resulting in the formation of a Methodist Society, and in 1775 the first chapel was built, and rebuilt in 1880. By this time other two places of worship had been built: in 1870, a second Methodist chapel, and in 1873, the Anglican church of Saint James was constructed in 1873 at the Leazes end of the village. Until the church was built, Burnopfield had been a section of the Tanfield and District Anglican Parish. =Coal mining= Durham mine Coal mining in County Durham began in the 1600s, and narrow waggonways were laid from the pits and Burnopfield was found to be an ideal place for the waggonways from the Pontop and Tanfield Moor areas to pass through and then continue down the hill to cross the Derwent, and on to the River Tyne for the coal to be shipped. Although surrounded by colliery villages like Lintz, Hobson, High Friarside and Marley Hill, it never had a serious mine of its own. Gradually it became largely occupied by people who worked in the nearby mining villages. With the building of a Co-operative Society shop in 1889, it also became a shopping centre for the miners and their families from the neighbouring colliery villages. With the decline of the British mining industry, the number of miners in the village drastically decreased, and they worked in the coastal pits. Industrial estates, factories, offices and shops now provide the work for residents of Burnopfield. During the latter part of the 20th century, the village changed from its old waggonway days; new council and private estates have been built and Burnopfield has extended both to the east and the west absorbing much of the adjoining areas into its postal district. =Cricket= Cricket has long been a popular sport in the village ‚Äì it has been played at two small cricket grounds. One is to be found in Lintz, near Burnopfield, since 1905, and the other once was located in Burnopfield proper before being demolished and turned into a housing estate. Both grounds were built upon land given to the clubs by the National Coal Board. The Burnopfield Club produced two Test cricketers for England, both of whom played before Durham County Cricket Club took part in the county championship; Jim McConnon, who played for Glamorgan, and Colin Milburn, the \\"Burnopfield Basher\\", who played for Northamptonshire. When Milburn died in 1990, his funeral was the largest ever seen in Burnopfield, and was attended by many notable cricketing figures including future Durham player Ian Botham. Lintz Lintz is a small village immediately to the south-west of Burnopfield. The famous court case, Miller v. Jackson, arose from cricket played by Lintz Cricket Club in the village.

It is situated to the north of Bishop Auckland, between Willington and Spennymoor, and a short distance from the River Wear. Byers Green Hall has been the home of the Trotter family since the 15th century. Thomas Wright, (1711‚Äì1786) a famous 18th-century astronomer, architect and mathematician was born and died here. Wright was educated in King James I Grammar School in Bishop Auckland before being apprenticed to a clockmaker in the town. By 1734, after various adventures, Wright had progressed to making a huge working model of the universe (an orrery) for an aristocratic London patron. This set him on his remarkable career that included the first accurate description of the Milky Way. Professor Harold Orton, (1898‚Äì1975) a noted 20th-century linguist and English dialectologist was also born here. Harold Orton was the son of a schoolmaster at Byers Green and attended King James I Grammar School in Bishop Auckland followed by Merton College, Oxford. His 1933 book The Phonology of a South Durham Dialect, based on the dialect of the area, was re-published by Routledge in 2015.Routledge page for The Phonology of a South Durham Dialect by Harold Orton The village green Sir Percy Cradock, GCMG, (1923‚Äì2010) a senior British civil servant, was born in Byers Green. He was educated at Alderman Wraith Grammar School, Spennymoor followed by St John's College, Cambridge where he read law. Having trained as a barrister Cradock joined the Diplomatic Service and during his career held a number of senior diplomatic posts including Ambassador to China. Later in his career he was labelled by the media as the 'UK's most senior spy' because he chaired the Joint Intelligence Committee (UK) under Margaret Thatcher's government. Cradock died in London on 22 January 2010, aged 86. It is not known whether there was a village at Byers Green in the Anglo-Saxon period. The village name is quite late; it was first recorded in 1345 as Bires. It is probably the exact equivalent of the modern word 'byres'. The village name thus means '(the green by the) cowsheds'. Byers Green remained a farming area throughout the medieval period and into the 16th and 17th century. Most people would have worked on the land.

A paranoid schizophrenic, he shot and killed sportscaster and ex- National Hockey League player Brian Smith in Ottawa, Ontario on August 1, 1995. Early life Arenburg was born on December 30, 1956 in Upper Northfield, Nova ScotiaBrian Smith's killer jailed after border guard attacked to a farming family that raised cattle and sold produce. He dropped out of school in grade nine and later found employment as a scallop fisherman in Digby, Nova Scotia. He had reportedly been exhibiting symptoms of schizophrenia for some time but was not officially diagnosed until 1990.Shooter asks for transfer http://southshorenow.ca/archives/viewer.php?sctn=2001/091201/news&article;=2 At some point he began to believe that his ex-wife and her family were \\"torturing\\" him by broadcasting his thoughts on radio and television. He was hospitalized in 1990 after causing a disturbance at the Bridgewater courthouse in which he demanded an investigation, stating to authorities that his former in-laws were stealing his thoughts and selling them to Hollywood movie studios. He also came to believe that his former in-laws and the government were importing drugs into Nova Scotia and were \\"out to get him\\" due to his efforts to expose their activities. Following this disturbance, Arenburg told doctors at the South Shore Regional Hospital about the broadcasts and made threats to either burn down his in-laws' house or kill someone if the broadcasts of his thoughts were allowed to continue. He then demanded to be discharged and his request was granted, despite the threats he had made. In January 1992, he physically assaulted a radio station manager in Bridgewater, Nova Scotia, citing messages being broadcast in his head. Arenburg was found guilty of assault and fined $300 or two weeks in jail in the earlier incident, but never showed up for his trial. He had already skipped town and moved to Ottawa; the authorities in Bridgewater decided that it was not worth their while to track him down. Ottawa shooting On August 1, 1995, Arenburg went to the Ottawa television station CJOH. Witnesses said he parked his car approximately 60 metres from the front entrance of the CJOH studios, pulled a long-barreled .22-calibre rifle from his trunk and fired two shots, one hitting and killing the station's longtime sports anchor, Brian Smith.Widow shocked by unconditional release of husband's killer, CBC News, November 22, 2006 Arenburg had gone to the television studio because he believed the station was broadcasting messages in his head. Smith was the first broadcast personality that Arenburg saw and recognized coming out of the building. Following the shooting, police recovered a list of other Ottawa media personalities in Arenburg's apartment, and an official at the city's press club noted that he had previously ejected Arenburg from the club three times for loudly demanding to see various people on his list. Arenburg had also reportedly been turned away from the Parliament Buildings on several occasions. Arenburg was found not criminally responsible in Smith's death, due to his mental condition. He was remanded to the Oak Ridge Division of Mental Health Centre Penetanguishene. Smith's murder led to renewed calls in Canada for strengthening of the government's gun control legislation. In 2001, the Ontario Review Board began to grant Arenburg 72-hour release. He applied for full conditional release in 2004. The Ontario Review Board granted Arenburg an absolute discharge from the Mental Health Centre Penetanguishene in November 2006. According to CFRA, the board heard that he no longer poses a significant risk to the community and no longer suffers from the symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia.580 CFRA - News Talk RadioTheStar.com  GTA  Journalist's killer arrested again Post-release On November 29, 2007, Arenburg was arrested after punching a U.S. customs officer in the head Buffalo, New York at the Peace Bridge International Crossing. According to officials, Arenburg attempted to enter the United States on a commercial bus as a passenger and was denied entry due to past criminal convictions.Brian Smith's killer jailed after border guard attacked He was subsequently jailed for 2 years and was released on September 8, 2009.Ottawa sportscaster's killer jailed 2 years in U.S. for assaultArenburg back in Canada In a submission to the review board, a doctor said Arenburg had good insight into his illness but \\"would likely suffer from psychotic symptoms if he stops taking his medication.\\" As of early 2014, Arenburg resided in his hometown of Bridgewater, Nova Scotia. While living in Bridgewater he claimed in an interview on the CBC program The Fifth Estate that he was no longer mentally ill and admitted he did not take the medication prescribed to keep his schizophrenia under control.http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/episodes/2013-2014/the-man-who-hears-voices The Man Who Hears Voices In November 2014, Arenburg returned to Ottawa stating he had been run out of the small town after the CBC interview aired. Upon arriving in Ottawa he was staying in a shelter with $15 to his name awaiting his Canada Pension Plan Disability cheque. Death On June 26, 2017, it was reported that Arenburg had died in Ottawa on June 13 of a heart attack.

The Bulgarians obtained a decisive victory which not only secured the previous successes of Simeon I, but made him de facto ruler of the whole Balkan Peninsula, excluding the well-protected Byzantine capital Constantinople and the Peloponnese. The battle, which was one of the biggest and bloodiest battles of the European Middle Ages, was one of the worst disasters ever to befall a Byzantine army, and conversely one of the greatest military successes of Bulgaria.Haldon (2008), p. 92 Among the most significant consequences was the official recognition of the Imperial title of the Bulgarian monarchs, and the consequent affirmation of Bulgarian equality vis-√†-vis Byzantium. Background The Bulgarian troops seize Adrianople. After the Bulgarian victory in the War of 894‚Äì896, the Byzantines were forced to pay tribute to Tsar Simeon I of Bulgaria. In 912 when the Byzantine emperor Leo VI died, his brother Alexander refused to pay tribute to the Bulgarians. Simeon saw an opportunity to wage a new war and fulfill his ambitions to conquer Constantinople. Alexander died in the same year and the new government under the Patriarch Nicholas Mystikos made desperate attempts to avoid the war, promising that the infant Emperor Constantine VII would marry one of Simeon's daughters.Nicolaus Patriarcha. Epistolae, ep. 8, col. 61C-68C At some point, the patriarch and Simeon even met outside the walls of Constantinople, performing a coronation ceremony. Thereafter, Simeon began using the title \\"Tsar of the Bulgarians\\", and the Greek title basileus in his seals.Stephenson (2004), p. 22 After a plot in the Byzantine court in 914 however, the new regent Zoe, Constantine's mother, rejected the marriage. In answer the Bulgarians raided Eastern Thrace. Adrianople opened its gates to Simeon in September 914,Theophanes Continuatus. Chronographia, p. 387Leo Grammaticus.

By 917, after a series of successful campaigns, the Byzantine Empire had stabilized its eastern borders, and the generals John Bogas and Leo Phocas were able to gather additional troops from Asia MinorLeo Grammaticus. Chronographia, p. 244 to reinforce the imperial tagmata and the European thematic troops, gathering a force of some 30,000 men. This was a very large army by contemporary standards, and its goal was the elimination of the Bulgarian threat from the north. The Byzantine commanders were convinced that their strategy would be successful. Morale was raised as the soldiers vowed by the miraculous Cross to die for one another. The spirit of the army was further raised as the troops were paid in advance and a fleet commanded by Romanus Lecapenus set off to the north at the mouth of the Danube. The Byzantines had tried to pay some Pecheneg tribes to attack, but Romanus would not agree to transport them across the Danube, and instead they attacked Bulgarian territory on their own.Nicolaus Patriarcha. Epistolae, ep. 9, col. 73A =The Bulgarian army= The size of the Bulgarian army under Simeon I of Bulgaria is unknown. Although they ruined the Byzantine negotiations, the Bulgarians were still afraid that the old allies of the Byzantines, the Pechenegs and the Hungarians, would attack them from the north, so two small armies were sent to protect the northern borders of the vast Bulgarian Empire that spread from Bosnia in the west to the Dnieper River in the east. However Miracula Sancti Georgii points that the Bulgarian army in the battle of Achelous was allied with Hungarian and Pecheneg troops,Krist√≥ Gyula: Levedi t√∂rzssz√∂vets√©g√©t≈ël Szent Istv√°n √°llam√°ig; Magvet≈ë K√∂nyvkiad√≥, Budapest, 1980 p. 248 From Miracula Sancti Georgii.

In addition, Bulgarian forces under Marmais were deployed near the western borders with the Serb principalities to prevent possible unrest. The battle The oath of the Byzantine soldiers on the eve of the battle. The Byzantine army marched northwards and set its camp in the vicinity of the strong fortress of Anchialus. Leo Phocas intended to invade Moesia and meet the Pechenegs and Lecapenus's troops in Dobrudzha. Simeon swiftly concentrated his army on the heights around the fortress. On the morning of 20 August, the battle between the Bulgarians and the Byzantines began by the River Achelous near the modern village Acheloi, 8 kilometers to the north of Anchialus (modern Pomorie) on Bulgaria's Black Sea coast. The Byzantine generals planned to outflank the Bulgarian right wing in order to detach Simeon's troops from the Balkan Passes. The Bulgarian ruler concentrated his most powerful forces in the two wings and left the centre relatively weak in order to surround the enemy when the centre would yield to the Byzantine attack. Simeon himself was in charge of large cavalry reserves hidden behind the hills which were intended to strike the decisive blow. The Bulgarian victory at Anchialus. The Byzantine attack was fierce and it was not long before the Bulgarians began slowly to retreat.Theophanes Continuatus. Chronographia, pp. 388‚Äì390 The Byzantine cavalry charged the infantry in the centre killing many Bulgarians. The Bulgarian position became desperate as they could not manage to hold the heights to the south of the river and began a hasty retreat to the north. Elated, the Byzantines started a bitter chase and their battle formations soon began to break, especially as a rumour spread that the Byzantine commander, Leo Phocas, had been killed. At this point, Simeon, who had detected the disarray in the Byzantine formation, ordered his army to stand, and, at the head of his heavy cavalry corps, attacked the Byzantine left wing from behind the hills.Leo Grammaticus. Chronographia, pp. 294‚Äì296 With an irresistible onslaught the cavalry bore down at the confused enemy who immediately bent under their attack, panicked, and took to their heels.Ioannes Skylitzes. Historia, 2, pp. 284‚Äì288 Some Byzantines tried to repulse the cavalry charge but they were also attacked by the infantry. Tsar Simeon personally took part in the fight, his white horse killed at the height of the battle. The Byzantines were completely routed. Leo Phocas was saved by fleeing to Mesembria (modern Nesebar) in Bulgaria, but in the thick of the battle Constantine Lips, John Grapson, and many other commanders (archontes) were cut down along with an enormous number of soldiers and officers.Ioannes Skylitzes. Historia, 2, p. 288 By the end of the day the Bulgarians overwhelmed the defenders of Mesembria and captured the town. Leo Phocas barely escaped by boarding a ship. The Byzantine historian Leo the Deacon says that 75 years after this military catastrophe the field at Anchialus was still covered with tens of thousands of Roman skeletons. The battle was among the bloodiest of medieval history and some historians refer to it as \\"the battle of the century\\". Aftermath Progress of the Battle of Acheloos. The remainder of the Byzantine army fled all the way back to Constantinople, followed by the Bulgarians. Several days later Phokas was defeated once more at Katasyrtai where the last Byzantine troops were routed after a night fight.Theophanes Continuatus. Chronographia, p. 290 The way to Constantinople was clear.Leo Grammaticus. Chronographia, p. 296Georgius Monachus Continuatus. Chronicon, p. 808 The Byzantines proposed a new peace treaty, and Simeon entered the imperial city and was crowned for a second time as \\"Tsar\\" (the Slavonic title for Caesar i.e. Emperor) \\"of all Bulgarians and Romans\\".Nicolaus Patriarcha. Epistolae, ep. 9, col. 68A Simeon also demanded that his daughter would marry Constantine VII, the son of empress Zoe Karvounopsina, but Zoe refused and allied with Serbia and Hungary against him. However, in August 918, the general Romanus Lecapenus engineered a coup to depose Zoe and confined her to the monastery of St Euphemia-in-Petrium, allowing him to assume the purple. The alliance with the Serbs postponed the decisive assault of Constantinople. Due to his also heavy casualties, Simeon decided to secure his rear and sent an army from his remaining forces under Marmais and Theodore Sigritsa to destroy them.Obolensky, D. The Byzantine Commonwealth, London, 1971, p. 111 His generals captured the Serb prince but that gave the Byzantines precious time to recover due to his already diminished forces, making him have no sufficient forces to fight on both sides at the same time. Significance The battle of Achelos was one of the most important battles in the long Byzantine‚ÄìBulgarian Wars. It secured the concession of the Imperial title to the Bulgarian rulers, and thereby firmly established Bulgaria's role as a key player in Europe. However, the dynastic marriage that Simeon desired to establish with the Byzantine imperial family was foiled. After his death in 927 however, his successor Peter I was able to secure the hand of Maria Lecapene, the granddaughter of emperor Romanus I,Stephenson (2004), p. 24 and with it an annual tribute, the renewed recognition of his imperial title and the autocephaly of the Bulgarian church. This agreement ushered an unprecedented period of 40 years of peaceful relations between the two powers, a time of stability and prosperity for Bulgaria.Stephenson (2004), pp. 24‚Äì25 Footnotes Sources * –ê—Ç–∞–Ω–∞—Å –ü–µ–π—á–µ–≤ –∏ –∫–æ–ª–µ–∫—Ç–∏–≤, 1300 –≥–æ–¥–∏–Ω–∏ –Ω–∞ —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–∂–∞, –í–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–æ –∏–∑–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—Å—Ç–≤–æ, –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è 1984. * –í–∞—Å–∏–ª –ù. –ó–ª–∞—Ç–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏, –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –Ω–∞ –±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∞—Ç–∞ –¥—ä—Ä–∂–∞–≤–∞ –ø—Ä–µ–∑ —Å—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–∏—Ç–µ –≤–µ–∫–æ–≤–µ, –ß–∞—Å—Ç I, II –∏–∑–¥., –ù–∞—É–∫–∞ –∏ –∏–∑–∫—É—Å—Ç–≤–æ, –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è 1970.  * John Skylitzes, Synopsis Historion, translated by Paul Stephenson. * Theophanes Continuatus, ed.

She is also called Maria, Mama Maria, Maria David, Maria Fontaine, and Queen Maria. Biography Zerby was raised in evangelical Pentecostalism. Her father was a Nazarene minister, and she is credited with bringing the \\"fundamental Pentecostal principle of being 'Spirit-led'\\" into the movement she eventually came to lead. She joined the group, then called Teens for Christ, in 1969. Trained as a stenographer, she became the personal secretary to David Berg, the group's founder, and instrumental in transcribing his classes. He later separated from his first wife, Jane, and Zerby became his wife. Berg openly explained this to his followers via a missive called \\"The Old Church and the New Church\\". In 1975, while living in Tenerife, Spain, Zerby had a son, Ricky Rodriguez, who was to \\"guide them all when the End Times came\\". Rodriguez's childhood (Berg was his stepfather) was recorded in a book called The Story of Davidito, which was meant to be an example to other members on how to raise their children. The book is controversial for its alleged encouragement of child sexual abuse. According to the book, Zerby participated in the alleged sexual abuse of her son, alongside David Berg, from the time he was 18 months old, and allowed her seven-year-old daughter Christina to be raised in a similar manner. The church leadership in this period was highly secretive, living in remote locations and being barely seen by anyone; Zerby was known to the church's followers mostly from cartoons in the Berg-penned MO Letters. In January 2005, Rodriguez murdered former group member Angela Smith, a former nanny; hours later Rodriguez committed suicide. In a video recorded the night before, \\"he said he saw himself as a vigilante avenging children like him and his sisters who had been subject to rapes and beatings\\". Apparently, he had been looking for his mother and for his stepsister: \\"He wanted to see his mother prosecuted for child abuse, and to free Techi from the group\\". By the mid-1980s Zerby had become important enough to issue church edicts of her own: in 1984 she forbade sexual activity for new members until they had been in the group for six months, and in that same year began the taping of cassettes with music, which provided an additional source of income. In 1986 she forbade sexual contact between adults and minors; later it became an offense that could lead to excommunication. Throughout the 1980s she dictated and enforced elements of discipline, ending for instance a training program for children she deemed too harsh. With David Berg's health declining in the late 1980s, Zerby, having been groomed for the position, essentially took over the leadership position in 1988. After Berg's death in 1994, she married Peter Amsterdam, another church leader, and assumed the spiritual leadership of the group.

Bigorre (Gascon: Big√≤rra) is a region in southwest France, historically an independent county and later a French province, located in the upper watershed of the Adour, on the northern slopes of the Pyrenees, part of the larger region known as Gascony. Today Bigorre comprises the centre and west of the d√©partement of Hautes-Pyr√©n√©es, with two small exclaves in the neighbouring Pyr√©n√©es Atlantiques. Its inhabitants are called Bigourdans. Before the French Revolution, the province of Bigorre had a land area of 2,574 km¬≤ (994 sq. miles). Its capital was Tarbes. At the 1999 French census, there lived 177,575 inhabitants on the territory of the former province of Bigorre, which means a density of 69 inh. per km¬≤ (179 inh. per sq. mile). The largest urban areas in Bigorre are Tarbes, with 77,414 inhabitants in 1999, Lourdes, with 15,554 inhabitants in 1999, and Bagn√®res- de-Bigorre, with 11,396 inhabitants in 1999. At the time of the Roman conquest, the area of Bigorre was inhabited by the Bigorri or Bigerri, who gave their name to the region. The Bigorri were probably speakers of Aquitanian, a language possibly related to Basque. Bigorre was conquered by the Roman general Julius Caesar in 56 BC and incorporated into the province of Gallia Aquitania. In the fourth century, Aquitania was divided in three, for administration; the region that became Bigorre was part of the southernmost section, Aquitania tertia or Novempopulana. Like the rest of Aquitaine, Bigorre was subsumed within the Visigothic kingdom during the fifth century. After the Battle of Vouill√© (507), where the Franks defeated the Visigoths and forced them out of Aquitaine, Bigorre became part of the Frankish kingdom, usually held by the same king who controlled Toulouse. Under the Merovingian kings, Bigorre was a civitas (Latin Begorra), the chief settlement of which was Cieutat. It was part of the morganegyba of Galsuintha from her husband, Chilperic I. On Galsuintha's murder it passed to her sister Brunhilda as part of the arbitration imposed by Guntram of Burgundy. By the Treaty of Andelot (587) Guntram acquired possession of it and it remained with Burgundy until the reunion of various Frankish kingdoms in 613. The history of Bigorre in the seventh and eighth centuries is obscure. It was apparently part of the Basque Duchy of Gascony which was often at odds with the Frankish Duchy of Aquitaine. The County of Bigorre was formed by the Dukes of Gascony in the ninth century and inherited by scions of the ducal house in the tenth. It remained semi- independent of ducal authority throughout the next two centuries, and was briefly attached to the Viscounty of B√©arn (1080-1097). Thereafter the Counts of Bigorre, notable participants in the Reconquista, the Crusades, and the war against the Cathars, strongly asserted their independence, though on a few occasions they prudently acknowledged the suzerainty of another; as of Alfonso II of Aragon in 1187. Confiscated in 1292 by King Philip IV of France who intervened in a quarrel over the succession of Bigorre, the area was surrendered to Edward III of England by virtue of the Treaty of Br√©tigny (1360), which marked the end of the first phase of the Hundred Years' War. Recaptured by the French and their allies the counts of Foix between 1370 and 1406, Bigorre was granted by King Charles VII of France to Count Jean I of Foix in 1426. Thus, Bigorre was incorporated into the estates of the House of Foix-Grailly, which included the county of Foix, B√©arn, and N√©bouzan. Later, the estates of the House of Foix-B√©arn passed through heiresses to the House of Albret, then eventually to the House of Bourbon with Henry III of Navarre, son of Antoine de Bourbon and Jeanne d'Albret. Henry III of Navarre became King Henry IV of France in 1589. In 1607, he united to the French crown those of his personal fiefs that were under French sovereignty (i.e. County of Foix, Bigorre, Quatre-Vall√©es, and N√©bouzan, but not B√©arn and Lower Navarre, which were sovereign countries outside of the kingdom of France), and so Bigorre became part of the royal domain. Before the French Revolution, Bigorre was made part of the gouvernement (military area) of Guienne-Gascony, whereas for general matters it depended from the g√©n√©ralit√© of Auch like the rest of Gascony (although for a certain period of time it depended from the g√©n√©ralit√© of Pau, like B√©arn, N√©bouzan, County of Foix, and the Basque provinces). For judicial matters, Bigorre depended from the Parlement of Toulouse. The famous Cirque de Gavarnie, in the very south of Bigorre, with the 442 meters (1,450 ft) Gavarnie waterfall visible in the background Unlike so many other French provinces, Bigorre kept its provincial parliament, its estates, until the Revolution. The provincial estates of Bigorre decided the level of taxation in Bigorre, and how much tax money was given to the king of France. In 1789 Bigorre sent four representatives to the Estates-General in Versailles. The representatives of Bigorre lobbied quite successfully because in 1790 it was decided that Bigorre would become a French d√©partement (instead of being subordinated to the neighboring province of B√©arn, also turned into a d√©partement, as had been initially planned). However, it was felt that Bigorre was not large enough to meet the criteria of a d√©partement, so it was decided that the province of Quatre-Vall√©es and a fragment of the province of N√©bouzan, both to the east of Bigorre, as well as several areas of Gascony to the north of Bigorre, would be joined with Bigorre to create the new d√©partement of Hautes-Pyr√©n√©es. Quatre-Vall√©es and N√©bouzan protested vehemently against the decision, saying they wished to join with the province of Comminges with which they had historical and economic ties, but it was to no avail. Tarbes, the capital of Bigorre, was made the capital of the new d√©partement. Geographically, Bigorre consists of two distinct areas: the plains to the north around Tarbes rising into the foothills and the high mountain slopes to the south, rising to the Pic du Midi de Bigorre, with the mineral spa of Bagn√®res-de-Bigorre at its foot. Although Tarbes is the capital of Hautes-Pyr√©n√©es, the nearby town of Lourdes has eclipsed it in fame since the apparitions of the Blessed Virgin Mary in 1858, becoming the largest modern pilgrimage center of Western Europe: 12 million people visit the religious shrines annually.

The concept was introduced by Edward Tolman in 1948. The concept was used to explain the behavior of rats that appeared to learn the spatial layout of a maze, and subsequently the concept was applied to other animals, including humans. The term was later generalized by some researchers, especially in the field of operations research, to refer to a kind of semantic network representing an individual's personal knowledge or schemas.  Overview  Cognitive maps have been studied in various fields, such as psychology, education, archaeology, planning, geography, cartography, architecture, landscape architecture, urban planning, management and history. Because of the broad use and study of cognitive maps, it has become a colloquialism for just about any mental representation or model. As a consequence, these mental models are often referred to, variously, as cognitive maps, mental maps, scripts, schemata, and frames of reference. Cognitive maps serve the construction and accumulation of spatial knowledge, allowing the \\"mind's eye\\" to visualize images in order to reduce cognitive load, enhance recall and learning of information. This type of spatial thinking can also be used as a metaphor for non-spatial tasks, where people performing non-spatial tasks involving memory and imaging use spatial knowledge to aid in processing the task. The neural correlates of a cognitive map have been speculated to be the place cell system in the hippocampus and the recently discovered grid cells in the entorhinal cortex.  Neurological basis  Cognitive mapping is believed to largely be a function of the hippocampus. The hippocampus is connected to the rest of the brain in such a way that it is ideal for integrating both spatial and nonspatial information. Connections from the postrhinal cortex and the medial entorhinal cortex provide spatial information to the hippocampus. Connections from the perirhinal cortex and lateral entorhinal cortex provide nonspatial information. The integration of this information in the hippocampus makes the hippocampus a practical location for cognitive mapping, which necessarily involves combining information about an object's location and its other features. O'Keefe and Nadel were the first to outline a relationship between the hippocampus and cognitive mapping. Many additional studies have shown additional evidence that supports this conclusion. Specifically, pyramidal cells (place cells, boundary cells, and grid cells) have been implicated as the neuronal basis for cognitive maps within the hippocampal system. Numerous studies by O'Keefe have implicated the involvement of place cells. Individual place cells within the hippocampus correspond to separate locations in the environment with the sum of all cells contributing to a single map of an entire environment. The strength of the connections between the cells represents the distances between them in the actual environment. The same cells can be used for constructing several environments, though individual cells' relationships to each other may differ on a map by map basis. The possible involvement of place cells in cognitive mapping has been seen in a number of mammalian species, including rats and macaque monkeys. Additionally, in a study of rats by Manns and Eichenbaum, pyramidal cells from within the hippocampus were also involved in representing object location and object identity, indicating their involvement in the creation of cognitive maps. However, there has been some dispute as to whether such studies of mammalian species indicate the presence of a cognitive map and not another, simpler method of determining one's environment. While not located in the hippocampus, grid cells from within the medial entorhinal cortex have also been implicated in the process of path integration, actually playing the role of the path integrator while place cells display the output of the information gained through path integration. The results of path integration are then later used by the hippocampus to generate the cognitive map. The cognitive map likely exists on a circuit involving much more than just the hippocampus, even if it is primarily based there. Other than the medial entorhinal cortex, the presubiculum and parietal cortex have also been implicated in the generation of cognitive maps. = Parallel map theory = There has been some evidence for the idea that the cognitive map is represented in the hippocampus by two separate maps. The first is the bearing map, which represents the environment through self-movement cues and gradient cues. The use of these vector-based cues creates a rough, 2D map of the environment. The second map would be the sketch map that works off of positional cues. The second map integrates specific objects, or landmarks, and their relative locations to create a 2D map of the environment. The cognitive map is thus obtained by the integration of these two separate maps. This leads to an understanding that it is not just one map but three that help us create this mental process. It should be clear that parallel map theory is still growing. The sketch map has foundation in previous neurobiological processes and explanations while the bearing map has very little research to support its evidence. Generation The cognitive map is generated from a number of sources, both from the visual system and elsewhere. Much of the cognitive map is created through self-generated movement cues. Inputs from senses like vision, proprioception, olfaction, and hearing are all used to deduce a person's location within their environment as they move through it. This allows for path integration, the creation of a vector that represents one's position and direction within one's environment, specifically in comparison to an earlier reference point. This resulting vector can be passed along to the hippocampal place cells where it is interpreted to provide more information about the environment and one's location within the context of the cognitive map. Directional cues and positional landmarks are also used to create the cognitive map. Within directional cues, both explicit cues, like markings on a compass, as well as gradients, like shading or magnetic fields, are used as inputs to create the cognitive map. Directional cues can be used both statically, when a person does not move within his environment while interpreting it, and dynamically, when movement through a gradient is used to provide information about the nature of the surrounding environment. Positional landmarks provide information about the environment by comparing the relative position of specific objects, whereas directional cues give information about the shape of the environment itself. These landmarks are processed by the hippocampus together to provide a graph of the environment through relative locations.  History  The idea of a cognitive map was first developed by Edward C. Tolman. Tolman, one of the early cognitive psychologists, introduced this idea when doing an experiment involving rats and mazes. In Tolman's experiment, a rat was placed in a cross shaped maze and allowed to explore it. After this initial exploration, the rat was placed at one arm of the cross and food was placed at the next arm to the immediate right. The rat was conditioned to this layout and learned to turn right at the intersection in order to get to the food. When placed at different arms of the cross maze however, the rat still went in the correct direction to obtain the food because of the initial cognitive map it had created of the maze. Rather than just deciding to turn right at the intersection no matter what, the rat was able to determine the correct way to the food no matter where in the maze it was placed. Unfortunately, further research was slowed due to the behaviorist point of view prevalent in the field of psychology at the time. In later years, O'Keefe and Nadel attributed Tolman‚Äôs research to the hippocampus, stating that it was the key to the rat's mental representation of its surroundings. This observation furthered research in this area and consequently much of hippocampus activity is explained through cognitive map making. As time went on, the cognitive map was researched in other prospective fields that found it useful, therefore leading to broader and differentiating definitions and applications. A very prominent researcher, Colin Eden, has specifically mentioned his application of cognitive mapping simply as any representation of thinking models.  Criticism  In a review, Andrew T.D. Bennett argued that there is no clear evidence for cognitive maps in non-human animals (i.e. cognitive map according to Tolman's definition). This argument is based on analyses of studies where it has been found that simpler explanations can account for experimental results. Bennett highlights three simpler alternatives that cannot be ruled out in tests of cognitive maps in non-human animals \\"These alternatives are (1) that the apparently novel short-cut is not truly novel; (2) that path integration is being used; and (3) that familiar landmarks are being recognised from a new angle, followed by movement towards them.\\"  Mental Map Distinction  A cognitive map is a spatial representation of the outside world that is kept within the mind, until an actual manifestation (usually, a drawing) of this perceived knowledge is generated, a mental map. Cognitive mapping is the implicit, mental mapping the explicit part of the same process. In most cases, a cognitive map exists independently of a mental map, an article covering just cognitive maps would remain limited to theoretical considerations. Mental mapping is typically associated with landmarks, locations, and geography when demonstrated. Creating mental maps depends on the individual and their perceptions whether they are influenced by media, real-life, or other sources. Because of their factual storage mental maps can be useful when giving directions and navigating. As stated previously this distinction is hard to identify when posed with almost identical definitions, nevertheless there is a distinction. In some uses, mental map refers to a practice done by urban theorists by having city dwellers draw a map, from memory, of their city or the place they live.

The name of the street is often misspelled as Toneleiro. 1954 attack Rua Tonelero gained historical significance due to the \\"Atentado da rua Tonelero\\" (Rua Tonelero attack), which took place on 5 August 1954, at 12:30 AM, at number 180 of the street. In an attempt to assassinate publishing executive and politician Carlos Lacerda, perpetrator Alcino Jo√£o do Nascimento fatally shot his bodyguard Rubens Florentino Vaz, wounded security guard S√°lvio Romeiro, and injured Lacerda with a shot in the foot. A member of the National Democratic Union, Lacerda was one of the key political adversaries of then-President of Brazil Get√∫lio Vargas, who had previously ruled as a dictator from 1930 to 1945, and mounted a strong opposition campaign against the president through his newspaper, Tribuna da Imprensa. An investigation following the incident found that Nascimento, a professional carpenter, had been a hired gun for Clim√©rio Euribes de Almeida, who accompanied him during the crime and was only identified later. At the time Almeida was a member of Get√∫lio Vargas's official security detail, as well as a friend of Vargas's chief bodyguard Greg√≥rio Fortunato. Upon questioning, Nascimento named Vargas's son Lutero Vargas as the orchestrator of the shooting. On 8 August 1954, Fortunato confessed to his involvement in the crime. Fortunato, Nascimento and Almeida were all sentenced afterwards. The Tonelero shooting escalated the political crisis that led to calls for Vargas to resign, and which culminated in his suicide by gunshot on 24 August 1954.

Biography Papadiamantis was born in Greece, on the island of Skiathos, in the western part of the Aegean Sea. The island would figure prominently in his work. His father was a priest. He moved to Athens as a young man to complete his high school studies, and enrolled at the School of Philosophy of the University of Athens, but never completed his studies. This happened because he had economic difficulties, and had to find a job to make a living. He returned to his native island in later life, and died there. He supported himself by writing throughout his adult life, anything from journalism and short stories to several serialized novels. From a certain point onwards he had become very popular, and newspapers and magazines vied for his writings, offering him substantial fees. Papadiamantis did not care for money, and would often ask for lower fees if he thought they were unfairly high; furthermore he spent his money carelessly and took no care of his clothing and appearance. He never married, and was known to be a recluse, whose only true cares were observing and writing about the life of the poor, and chanting at church: he was referred to as \\"kosmokalogeros\\" (Œ∫ŒøœÉŒºŒøŒ∫Œ±ŒªœåŒ≥ŒµœÅŒøœÇ, \\"a monk in the world\\"). He died of pneumonia. Works Papadiamantis' longest works were the serialized novels The Gypsy Girl, The Emigrant, and The Merchants of Nations. These were adventures set around the Mediterranean, with rich plots involving captivity, war, pirates, the plague, etc. However, the author is best remembered for his scores of short stories. Written in his own version of the then official language of Greece, \\"katharevousa\\" (a \\"purist\\" written language heavily influenced by ancient Greek), Papadiamantis' stories provide lucid and lyrical portraits of country life in Skiathos, or urban life in the poorer neighborhoods of Athens, with frequent flashes of deep psychological insight. The nostalgia for a lost island childhood is palpable in most of them; the stories with an urban setting often deal with alienation. Characters are sketched with a deft hand, and they speak in the authentic \\"demotic\\" spoken language of the people; island characters lapse into dialect. Papadiamantis' deep Christian faith, complete with the mystical feeling associated with the Orthodox Christian liturgy, suffuses many stories. Most of his work is tinged with melancholy, and resonates with empathy with people's suffering, regardless of whether they are saints or sinners, innocent or conflicted. His only saint, in fact, is a poor shepherd who, having warned the islanders, is slaughtered by Saracen pirates after he refuses to abandon his flock for the safety of the fortified town. This particular story, The Poor Saint, is the closest he comes to a truly religious theme. An example of Papadiamantis' deep and even-handed feeling for humanity is his acknowledged masterpiece, the novella The Murderess. It is the story of an old woman in Skiathos, who pities families with many daughters: given their low socioeconomic status, girls could not work before marriage and they could not marry unless they provide a dowry; therefore, they were a burden and a plight to their families. After killing her own newborn granddaughter, gravelly ill with pertussis, she crosses the line from pity to what she believes is useful and appropriate action, the \\"mercy killing\\" of young girls. She kills three young girls in succession by throwing them into wells and then pretending to be trying to save them in order to justify her presence there. As coincidences keep piling up, she is confronted with a stark fact: her assumption that she was helping was monstrously wrong, and she gradually slips into mad torment. She flees arrest and tries to hide in the wilderness, but drowns in the sea while trying to escape two policemen on her trail; as Papadiamantis puts it, she meets \\"death half-way between divine and human justice\\". The character of the murderess is depicted with deep empathy and without condemnation. \\"As a child, she served her parents. Once married, she was her husband's slave... when she had children, she served them, and when they had children, she became their slave\\". Even her name tells the story of women in 19th century rural Greece: her birth name, Hadoula, \\"tenderling\\", is all but forgotten; she now is the \\"Fragkoyanno√∫\\", i.e. the widow of Yannis Fragkos, her whole existence referenced only to the name of her late, good-for-nothing husband. Monument in Skiathos His work is seminal in Modern Greek literature: he is for Greek prose what Dionysios Solomos is for poetry. As Odysseas Elytis wrote: \\"commemorate Dionysios Solomos, commemorate Alexander Papadiamantis\\". It is a body of work, however, that is virtually impossible to translate, as the magic of his language is founded on the Greek diglossia: elaborately crafted, high Katharevousa for the narrative, interspersed with authentic local dialect for the dialogue, and with all dialectical elements used in the narrative formulated in strict Katharevousa, and therefore in forms that had never actually existed.

Piggy's mother is continuously vexed by his seemingly insatiable appetite and inability to control himself. Piggy's gluttony causes problems which give his mother and the rest of his large family considerable annoyance, especially at mealtimes. After he eats his siblings' spaghetti meals at dinner, Piggy's mother scolds him and warns Piggy that he will burst someday if he continues his bad eating habits. After falling asleep following dinner, Piggy enters a dream sequence where he meets a mysterious old man who offers him a large feast, at which Piggy is delighted. The old man is revealed to be a mad scientist, who straps Piggy into a mechanical chair and plots to use Piggy as a test subject for his experiments. The intention of the experiment is revealed when the scientist unveils his \\"Feed-A-Matic\\" machine, which he plans to use to force-feed Piggy as much food as he can hold. The scientist uses the Feed-A-Matic to continuously force-feed Piggy using soup, olives, bananas, pies, sandwiches, and ice cream until Piggy is morbidly obese and bulging out of the chair. The mad scientist is amazed at this and pokes Piggy's super huge belly. Then he asks if he's had enough, to which Piggy says yes. The scientist releases him and Piggy waddles to the door, but then notices the food which the scientist used to bait him earlier and his hunger gets the better of him.

The population of the civil parish as taken at the 2011 Census was 1,502. It is situated to the south-east of Durham. History The village takes its name from the family of Kelloe or Kellaw: Richard Kellaw was Bishop of Durham in 1311. The Lordship of the Manor of Kelloe was bought by the Tempests of Broughton Hall, North Yorkshire, and bequeathed by Sir Henry Vane-Tempest to his daughter, Lady Frances Vane, who married the third Marquess of Londonderry. The current holder of the Lordship of Kelloe is Mr Barrington Edward Kerr Gilmour of Northumberland. The village expanded with the mining industry: the population increased from 663 to more than 11,000 by 1848. Nearby is East Hetton or Kelloe colliery where six men were killed by gasses from the Trimdon Grange colliery disaster in 1882.  St Helen's Church  The parish church is in Church Kelloe, a \\"considerable distance\\" from the town of Kelloe itself.Hutchingson (1794) reported in Ryder (1994) p 7. The church itself is of uncertain date. Ryder (1994) gives Saxon or Early Norman from architectural evidence. The earlier date is suggested by the herringbone and the archaic treatment of the north-west quoin indicate an early date, the herringbone work being similar to that at Seaham which is a pre-Viking Saxon building. However, if the south doorway is original, then the building is post-1100.Ryder (1994) p 9 The church remained a small (unaisled) country church for most of its existence until the development of the surrounding villages with the sinking of the collieries from 1836 onwards. Mining remained a key industry in the area until its closure in 1983.Ryder (1994) p. 1 =St Helena cross= Ryder claims the St Helena cross as \\"one of the most important items of Romanesque sculpture in the country\\".Ryder (1994) p. 5 The 12th-century cross was found broken into several pieces being used as walling stone in the south wall of the chancel. During the 1854 rebuilding it was found and reassembled. It was conserved and cleaned in the early 1990s and is currently set against the north wall of the sanctuary. The cross shows scenes from the legend of the Invention of the True Cross including saints Helena and Constantine, whence its name. The right and back are plain. Three further scenes from the legend are missing, which has led to a suggestion that it is one of a pair, possibly associated with a reliquary.Ryder (1994) p. 5 J T Lang in a personal communication to Ryder suggests that reliquary might have held a portion of the True Cross and that (in the absence of documentary evidence for it having been at Kelloe) it may have been held at Durham Cathedral.Ryder (1994) p. 5 The crosses and reliquary may have been moves to Kelloe in the 16th Century (since the church was already dedicated to St Helen) and is possible that the second cross is still somewhere within the fabric of the church.

In her one term in the Legislative Assembly, she was a strong advocate for environmental causes, both inside the ACT, such as the preservation of the Black Mountain area (which had been threatened by the Gungahlin Drive Extension), and outside, such as her attempts to save Tasmania's environmentally sensitive Tarkine wilderness area from logging and development. She also advocated for several progressive causes, such as a bid to legalise voluntary euthanasia in the ACT (which only narrowly failed). She also vocally opposed the demolition of the Royal Canberra Hospital, preferring that the buildings be reused, and later, once the demolition became inevitable, opposed the government's preferred method, implosion, on environmental grounds.
