Horace Round (John) Horace Round (1854–1928) was an historian and genealogist of the English medieval period. He translated the portion of Domesday Book (1086) covering Essex into English. As an expert in the history of the British peerage, he was appointed honorary historical adviser to the Crown. Biography=Family and early life Round was born on 22 February 1854 in Hove, Sussex. His parents were John Round (died 1887), a barrister, of West Bergholt, Essex,The Balliol College Register, second edition, 1833-1933, Oxford University Press, 1934, pg 88 and Laura, the daughter of the poet Horatio Smith (died 1864). His family history appears in Burke's Landed Gentry, a publication he regularly criticised for its inaccuracies, although there is no reason to doubt the accuracy of the entry for his family. His birthplace, 15 Brunswick Terrace, is marked with a blue plaque. Following his childhood education, he went up to Balliol College, Oxford in 1874, where he read for a degree in Modern History. In the final examinations in 1879, he obtained a bachelor of arts with first class honours; he qualified for an M.A. in 1881.The Balliol College Register, second edition, 1833-1933, Oxford University Press, 1934, pg 88 Though a native of Sussex, he had many interests in Essex, and was both deputy lieutenant and lord of the manor of Bergholt Hall, West BergholtThe Victoria History of the County of Essex: Bibliography, ed.

II, Burke's Peerage, pg 1195-1196 Work as a genealogist and writer Horace Round wearing ceremonial attire of deputy lieutenant of Essex He contributed to many publications (most notably The Complete Peerage, the Dictionary of National Biography (first edition) and the Victoria County History (VCH)) and was the author of several significant works. His translation and discussion of the Essex Domesday (VCH Essex, vol. 1) is widely regarded as a masterpiece, and is of national significance; this contrasts with his books, where he often indulged in castigating his contemporaries. He pursued disputes with other academics vigorously, and on more than one occasion, the level of acrimony was sufficiently high that the editor was forced to close correspondence on the subject. These disputes in a normally gentle academic area honed his analytic skills. He was recognised as a leading authority on medieval and later genealogy and was awarded an honorary LLD by the University of Edinburgh in February 1905. He also served as President of the Essex Archaeological Society. He advised the Court of Claims and Committee for Privileges of the House of Lords on matters concerning the coronation of King Edward VII. His book on this topic, The King's Serjeants and Officers of State, with their Coronation Services was published in 1911, the year of King George V's coronation. An expert in British peerage history and law, he was appointed Honorary Historical Adviser to the Crown in peerage cases in 1914 (a post from which he resigned in 1922). Illness and death Round contracted a chronic illness some time after coming down from Oxford, and his handwriting progressively deteriorated over the years. He died on 24 June 1928 in Hove. A memoir by his friend and colleague William Page was included in a posthumously published volume of writings, and a biography by W. Raymond Powell was published in 2001.

The picture was credited as being directed by Gregory Ratoff, though Ratoff collapsed near the end of the five-month production, and was replaced by László Benedek, who completed principal photography; the credited screenwriters were Paul Jarrico and Richard J. Collins. The film stars Robert Taylor, Susan Peters, and Robert Benchley. Plot American conductor John Meredith (Robert Taylor) and his manager, Hank Higgins (Robert Benchley), go to the Soviet Union shortly before the country is invaded by Germany. Meredith falls in love with beautiful Soviet pianist Nadya Stepanova (Susan Peters) while they travel throughout the country on a 40-city tour. Their bliss is destroyed by the German invasion. CastPerception as pro-Soviet propaganda The positive portrayal of the Soviet Union in the film is clearly linked to the wartime alliance of the Soviet Union and the U.S. After the end of the Second World War and the outbreak of the Cold War, the House Un- American Activities Committee (HUAC) cited Song of Russia as one of the three noted examples of \\"pro-Soviet propaganda films\\" made by Hollywood, the others being Warner Brothers' Mission to Moscow and RKO's The North Star. This assertion was supported by the Russian-born pro-capitalist and anti-Communist writer Ayn Rand, who was specifically asked by a HUAC investigator to see the film and provide an expert opinion on it. Ayn Rand, in her 1947 testimony before the HUAC, cited Song of Russia as an example of Communist propaganda in the Hollywood motion picture-industry, depicting an idealized Soviet Union with freedom and comfort that, in her opinion, never existed in the real Soviet Union. Robert Taylor himself protested, after the fact, that he had had to make the film under duress, as he was under contract to MGM. This is the rationale he used to explain why he was a friendly witness during the HUAC hearings in the 1950s. Russian-born director Gregory Ratoff testified that Taylor was telling the truth and that Taylor had explicitly protested about the aforementioned aspect of the film but had been told by MGM to \\"just do the picture\\" or else he would liable for breach of contract. Reception Despite the criticism it received in later years, historians claiming it is nowadays more remembered for its content rather than its quality, Song of Russia was initially received positively. The New York Times called some scenes \\"a fine bit of cinematic art\\". Furthermore, the reviewer praised the cast, writing: > \\"Taylor makes a very good impression as a young American caught in Russia by > love and war. And Susan Peters is extraordinarily winning as a mentally > solemn but emotionally bonny Russian girl. Robert Benchley throws some > straws of cryptic humor into the wind as the American's manager, and Michael > Chekhov, Vladimir Sokoloff and Michael Dalmatov are superb as genial Russian > characters.\\" Big Spring Daily Herald called Taylor and Peters \\"the most dynamic new romantic team since Clark Gable was paired with Lana Turner\\". Box office The movie was also popular, earning $1,845,000 in the US and Canada and $1,884,000 elsewhere resulting in a profit of $782,000.

History In 1955 the Philadelphia and Valley Forge Councils purchased the property jointly. Dedicated in April 1956, the camp opened in 1957 and was operated by both councils until 1965, when Valley Forge Council bought out the Philadelphia Council's interest. Originally, the reservation was to consist of six camps, each holding two hundred and fifty boys. Three camps—Camp Big Springs, Camp Great Bend and Camp Firestone—were built on the reservation. The property is now owned by the Cradle of Liberty Council. Camp Firestone and most of Camp Great Bend are currently closed because of lack of campers. In recent years, the Big Springs Camp has grown to encompass most of the old Great Bend Camp. This has led to many capital improvements throughout the reservation, most notably the addition of the Sir John Templeton Dining Hall, and the Thomas Richards Arena. The Camp Great Bend dining hall has since become a part of Big Springs as the STEM center. Geography Big Bushkill Creek runs through the camp and also runs into neighbor camps. The camp is built around, and gets its name from the 45-foot waterfall on the property. The camp is used by hunters and fishermen with the permission of the scouts. It is known among fisherman, especially fly fisherman. During the fall fishing season, the camp rents cabins to fishermen looking to fish along the Bushkill Creek. Even though there are certain restrictions, fisherman still fish along the eponymous falls.  Conservation  In February 2006, Natural Lands Trust completed a conservation easement on the reservation on behalf of Middle Smithfield Township, Monroe County. The Pennsylvania DNCR contributed $900,000 in grants to the project. The easement restricts development on the property and ensures that an additional of valuable natural open space will be permanently preserved.

Born into a Gullah family in the Low Country of South Carolina, she moved with them as a child to Philadelphia during the Great Migration. Later she lived in Paris before settling in New York City. She was active in the Black Arts Movement and performed on Broadway. Her travels informed her cooking and appreciation of food as culture. She was known for her cookbook-memoir, Vibration Cooking: or, The Travel Notes of a Geechee Girl (1970), and published numerous essays and articles. She produced two award-winning documentaries and was a commentator for years on NPR, serving as a contributor to its NOW series. Grosvenor also appeared in several films, including Daughters of the Dust (1992), about a Gullah family in 1902 during a time of transition on the Sea Islands, and Beloved (1998), based on Toni Morrison's 1987 novel of the same name. She was in a National Geographic documentary about the Gullah people. Early life and education Vertamae Smart was born in 1937 and raised in Hampton County, South Carolina, in the Low Country. She grew up speaking Gullah, as her parents' families had been in the area for centuries and were part of that ethnic group and culture. In this area, Africans were concentrated in large populations on relatively isolated Sea Island plantations and in the Low Country; they developed a unique creole culture and language with strong ties to Africa. Smart grew up on Low Country cuisine. She recounted her paternal grandmother Estella Smart's way with oysters in her first cookbook, published in 1970. Recognizing common practices between contemporary African cooking and that of Low Country African Americans, she became interested in food and cooking as expressions of culture. When she was about eight, her family moved from the Gullah Geechee Corridor in the Low Country to Philadelphia. She lived there through her teenage years and, as a latchkey kid and an only child, she \\"had lots of time to experiment with cooking.\\"Vertamae Smart-Grosvenor, Vibration Cooking. \\"I would use up all the food experimenting and she [my mother] would never fuss,\\" writes Grosvenor in Vibration Cooking. \\"I now realize how uptight it must have put her cause we were so poor and every bit of food counted.\\" Early career In 1958, at the age of 19, Smart took off for Paris, France, intending to pursue theater in the bohemian circles of Europe. She also traveled to cities in Italy and other European countries. In Paris, she recognized that a Senegalese woman selling food on the street was using techniques she knew from her family and the Low Country cuisine. She began to write about food and cooking as a way of expressing one's culture.Brief Bio: \\"Vertamae Grosvenor\\", The Writer's Almanac, American Public Media. In Paris she met Bob Grosvenor, whom she later married. After she was told by a friend that there was a store that \\"sold frozen lion's tails and elephant tails with green peas,\\" one of her hobbies in Paris was looking for \\"unusual food stores.\\" In 1968, Grosvenor returned to Paris, where she lived for a period of time with her two children, Kali and Chandra. She eventually settled in New York City, where she pursued acting, making it to Broadway, where she played Big Pearl in Mandingo. She was attracted to the Black Arts Movement and its artists, including Nikki Giovanni and Leroi Jones, both of whom she refers to in Vibration Cooking. She became personally involved in the movement. For three years, she was a chanter, dancer, costume designer, member, and often cook of Sun Ra's Solar-Myth Arkestra. Broadcasting Grosvenor was a long-time contributor to public broadcasting in the United States. She was a commentator on NPR's All Things Considered and a regular contributor to NPR's Cultural Desk. Early notable programs were her documentaries Slave Voices: Things Past Telling (1983), and Daufuskie: Never Enough Too Soon, which earned her a Robert F. Kennedy Award and an Ohio State Award.Bio: \\"Vertamae Grosvenor\\", NPR. From 1988 to 1995, she was the host of NPR's documentary series Horizons. Her work there included AIDS and Black America: Breaking the Silence on the AIDS crisis in the United States, which won two awards, a duPont-Columbia Award and an Ohio State Award, in 1990. She also produced a program on connections between indigenous people of South Africa and African Americans, South Africa and the African-American Experience. She was the host of the radio shows Seasonings, a series of holiday specials on food, cooking, and culture, which won a James Beard Award in 1996 for Best Radio Show; and The Americas' Family Kitchen, which led to a television spinoff called Vertamae Cooks. Writing Grosvenor is the author of several books on African-American cooking, but is perhaps most famous for Vibration Cooking: or, the Travel Notes of a Geechee Girl (1970), an autobiographical cookbook and memoir. Grosvenor's Thursdays and Every Other Sunday Off: A Domestic Rap (1972), about the experiences and lives of domestic workers, was published by Doubleday as a work of sociology. In addition to books, she has been a contributing editor to Élan and Essence magazines. She has published articles in the Village Voice, The New York Times, and The Washington Post. She has published under multiple names, including Vertamae Smart-Grosvenor, Verta Smart, and Vertamae Grosvenor.  Vibration Cooking: or, the Travel Notes of a Geechee Girl  Vibration Cooking: or, the Travel Notes of a Geechee Girl, published 1970 and reprinted in 1986, 1992, and 2011, is Grosvenor's first book. Through her prose and her recipes, she writes of her travels, her experiences as a black woman in America (especially New York City) and abroad, and her life as influenced and shaped by food. Grosvenor preaches food's ability to nourish, to connect people, to cross regional boundaries, to feel like home, to be a mode of self-expression, to be improvisational and adaptational, and to tell stories. The title, Vibration Cooking, comes from Grosvenor's discussion of \\"vibrations\\" in the book. When she cooks, she writes in the book's first chapter, \\"I just do it by vibration. Different strokes for different folks. Do your thing your way.\\" \\"Vibrations,\\" for Grosvenor, are not only intuition and using all of one's senses when cooking, but also the energy and attitude one brings when cooking or eating. \\"Some people got such bad vibrations that to eat with them would give you indigestion,\\" she writes. The book is written as a mix of narrative and recipes. The line between them is often fuzzy, with recipes composed conversationally and usually without exact measurements. Recipes occur as part of and contribute to the storytelling, with prose continuing after the recipe. Grosvenor encourages the reader to tap into their own sense of vibrations; to \\"make do\\"; and to note when the recipe they're cooking looks \\"right,\\" \\"done,\\" or \\"weird\\"; and to make various adjustments \\"if you want to.\\" Grosvenor's style of writing and attitude towards food influenced the writer and poet Ntozake Shange when she was writing her own cookbook, if i can cook /you know god can, for which Grosvenor wrote the introduction.Shange, Ntozake. if i can cook you know god can. The recipes are often introduced via an instance in which that particular meal was eaten, or via a person who gave Grosvenor the recipe. In addition to recipes for food, Grosvenor also includes recipes and guidance for cocktails and other drinks, herbal teas, use of spices and herbs, and poultices and home remedies. The recipes pay homage to Grosvenor's own cultural roots in Geechee (or Gullah) culture and Lowcountry cuisine. Her intention was both a creative project and to debunk and demystify perceptions of African-American food: \\"I wanted to tell stories about the gatherings, the people, the food, and the history of the food. For decades the history of African-American food was mucked up. \\"Soul food,\\" aka black folks' eats, was said to have developed out of master's leftovers ... Education is the key.\\" Grosvenor writes often of soul food in Vibration Cooking, but is careful not to limit what she means by the term; she ties it in the good vibrations with which she cooks herself. She writes: > People up here [in the North] act like it's going to a lot of trouble just > to give you a glass of water and whenever those vibrations hit me, I > remember how Aunt Carrie, with no electricity, no running water, no gas, no > refrigerator, not even an icebox got us a beautiful supper with love. I know > that northern folks are out to lunch and better go down south and get their > soul card punched\\". She is careful to note that soul food is not racial: \\"To call it 'soul food'—it's how you could put your soul in the pot... You can't just say food that's been cooked by black hands. Black hands have been cooking food for centuries.\\"Nminfocus. \\"Vertamae Smart Grosvenor\\". YouTube. She does not consider herself a soul food writer. In the introduction to the book's 1986 edition, Grosvenor writes: > My feeling was/is any Veau à la Flamande or Blinchishe's Tvorogom I prepared > was as 'soulful' as a pair of candied yams. I don't have culinary > limitations because I'm 'black.' On the other hand, I choose to write about > 'Afro-American' cookery because I'm 'black' and know the wonderful, > fascinating culinary history there is. And because the Afro-American cook > has been so underappreciated.\\"\\"Introduction to the 1986 Edition,\\" Vibration > Cooking. The book addresses gentrification of cuisine and the classification as \\"gourmet\\" of foods that have long been a part of African-American cookery, such as collards and terrapins. In the recipe for terrapins, Grosvenor writes, > Ain't nothing but swamp turtles. They used to be plentiful on the eastern > seaboard. So plentiful that plantation owners gave them to their slaves. Now > they are the rare discovery of so-called gore-mays. White folks always > discovering something…after we give it up. By the time they got to the > bugaloo, we were doing the 'tighten up.' By the time they got to pigs' feet, > black people were giving up swine. Grosvenor uses food as a way to talk about racism and cultural sensitivities. She writes about her own experiences of being discriminated against as a black woman and her frustrations with the oversimplification and pigeonholing of African-American cooking. She includes a letter she once wrote to the editors of Time in response to an essay that claimed soul food to be tasteless: \\"Your taste buds are so racist that they can't even deal with black food,\\" she wrote.

His most famous role as an actor was as producer Max Fabian in All About Eve (1950). Biography Ratoff was born in Samara, Russia to Jewish parents, Sophie (née Markison) and Benjamin Ratner. His mother claimed to have been born on September 1, 1878, but was married on June 14, 1894, when she would have been 15, to Benjamin Ratner (born 1864 – died 19??), with whom she had four children, the eldest of whom was Gregory, whose date of birth she gave as April 7, 1895 (see ) but later April 20 was cited as Gregory Ratoff's birthdate, and the year was given as 1893, 1896 and 1897, variously. Sophie Ratner later adopted her son's stage surname (Ratoff) when she herself became a naturalized United States citizen. She died on August 27, 1955, and her date of birth is given as September 13, 1877 in the \\"California, Death Index, 1940-1997\\".Sophie Ratoff death info from California, Death Index, 1940-1997, ancestry.com; accessed October 21, 2015. Ratoff was pursuing a law degree at the University of St. Petersburg until his education was interrupted by service in the Czar's army in World War I. After the war, he abandoned law to join the Moscow Art Theater, where he began to make a name for himself as an actor. An eyewitness to the chaos of the Bolshevik Revolution, Ratoff fled Russia with his parents in 1922 and settled in Paris, where he also wooed Eugenia Leontovitch (later known as actress Eugenie Leontovich), the daughter of a Czarist army officer, who, too, had escaped to Paris. They were both performing in a Paris production of the Russe Revue in 1922 when the famous New York impresario, Lee Shubert, founder of the Shubert Theaters, brought this show to Broadway, and the young couple along with it. They decided to stay in the United States, and the couple married on January 19, 1923. Leontovich gave Ratoff's year of birth as 1896 in her naturalization papers but did not include the month or day. A border crossing manifest, dated September 23, 1922, gives both her age and that of Gregory Ratner as 29, indicating 1893 as the year of birth of both (see ). Career Ratoff joined in the thriving Yiddish theater in New York City, producing, directing and acting for the Yiddish Players as he became something of an theatrical impresario, even performing in a Yiddish film. He graduated to Broadway later in the decade, appearing in Shubert productions as he learned English, though his mastery of the language always was heavily accented and this, in fact, became his stock-in-trade in his busy future career as a character actor. When the Depression hit Broadway, Ratoff headed to Hollywood, as part of the exodus of New York theater pros who were quickly snapped up by producers terrified of films with dialogue, the \\"talkies\\". He arrived in 1931 and caught a lucky break: in Gregory La Cava's Symphony of Six Million, producer David O. Selznick had insisted, very unusually for the time, that this Fannie Hurst story of a brilliant Jewish doctor escaping his tenement roots be cast with authentic Yiddish actors from the Lower East Side.Jeremy Arnold, \\"Symphony of Six Million\\" His role as the beloved immigrant father who dies on his son's operating table led to five more jobs in 1932 alone, ranging from a George Kaufman comedy to a prestigious Selznick production, George Cukor's What Price Hollywood?. With these early critical and box-office winners, Ratoff was in constant demand as a character actor throughout the 1930s, many in B-pictures but increasingly with young directors who later had important careers. Because of his large, shambling frame and uncertain command of English, he was often typecast as a villain in an American setting or an 'authentic' foreigner in the dozens of 1930s films that recreated a glamorous fictional Europe on the Hollywood backlot. In Frank Lloyd's Under Two Flags (1936), he was in the French Foreign Legion; in Howard Hawks' The Road to Glory (1936), a Russian sergeant in World War 1 France. His role as a comic showbiz caricature was also popular, especially in pre-Code backstage musicals, most famously as Mae West's lawyer in I'm No Angel (1933). It was in 1936, while he acted in six films, that Ratoff first moved behind the camera, co-directing (with Otto Brower) Sins of Man for Twentieth Century-Fox. He followed with his first screenwriting effort, Cafe Metropole (1937) and soon directed on his own with Lancer Spy (1937), starring Peter Lorre, Dolores del Río and George Sanders. Ratoff directed five A pictures by 1939 under contract for Fox, while still acting on the side. He landed his most memorable film, Intermezzo: A Love Story (1939), when a harried David Selznick borrowed the prolific Ratoff from Fox to direct his new Swedish protege Ingrid Bergman in her American debut. The original director, William Wyler, had walked out after a quarrel with Selznick, whose hands were full completing his troubled Gone with the Wind and making Rebecca, Alfred Hitchcock's first American film.Selznick by Bob Thomas, p. 186 The story was a remake of the Swedish film that had made Bergman a star, a tale of doomed love between a famous but married violin virtuoso (Leslie Howard) and his brilliant young piano accompanist (Bergman). Bergman was none too impressed with Ratoff, particularly because she was struggling with English herself and found Ratoff difficult to follow. Ratoff, however, soon saw that \\"she is sensational\\", as he told Life. Leslie Howard had been talked into the part with the promise of a co-producer credit. This was Ratoff's last Hollywood picture. Ratoff never reached such heights again, and never entered the top ranks of Hollywood directors. He dropped acting and left Fox in 1941 for a Columbia directing contract. Later years For the next decade, Ratoff directed comedies, musicals, crime dramas, war films, thrillers and swashbucklers—all solid but unspectacular fare in the wide range of genres then given to directors under contract. Song of Russia (1944), another love story between musical performers (Robert Taylor and Susan Peters) was set in Russia when the Nazi invasion begins. Ratoff had been lent out for this MGM job because the musical romance had become one of his specialties after his best-known work in Intermezzo. He actually collapsed near the end of shooting and had to be replaced by another emigre, Hungarian Laszlo Benedek. Taylor was a friendly witness for HUAC and its two writers were hauled before the committee, questioned and harassed. Ratoff's directing career in Hollywood never recovered and he returned to acting, playing his most famous role as the befuddled producer Max Fabian in All About Eve. Ratoff found his remaining opportunities outside of the U.S. The English comedy Abdulla the Great (1955), which he produced, directed and starred in as a Middle eastern potentate, proved a complete failure, but his visibly low-budget film of Jo Eisinger's play, Oscar Wilde (1960) won plaudits for Robert Morley in the title role and Sir Ralph Richardson as the barrister who destroys Wilde on the witness stand.Review: Oscar Wilde (film), nytimes.com; accessed October 21, 2015. Oscar Wilde (film), imdb.com; accessed October 21, 2015. He was one of the two producers (with Michael Garrison) to have purchased and developed the original rights to the James Bond franchise from Ian Fleming in 1955, which subsequently became the subject of a bitter legal dispute. Ratoff was given his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in February, 1960, just months before his death. One of his last roles as an actor was in the epic film Exodus (1960), for Otto Preminger, a director with whom he had first worked in the early 1930s. Death Ratoff died on December 14, 1960 in Solothurn, Switzerland of cancer. His body was returned to the United States for burial at Mount Hebron Cemetery, Flushing, New York. Divorced from Leontovich since 1949, Ratoff was buried under a gravestone marked \\"Beloved Husband\\".

It is set in a small town in Central Bulgaria during the months leading up to the April Uprising in 1876 and is the most famous piece of classic Bulgarian literature. Under the Yoke has been translated into more than 30 languages. The English translation was made in 1894 by William Morfill and published by the London publishing house William Heinemann. Plot The tranquility in a Bulgarian village under Ottoman rule is only superficial: the people are quietly preparing for an uprising. The plot follows the story of Boycho Ognyanov, who, having escaped from a prison in Diarbekir, returns to the Bulgarian town of Byala Cherkva (White Church, fictional representation of Sopot) to take part in the rebellion. There he meets old friends, enemies, and the love of his life. The plot portrays the personal drama of the characters, their emotions, motives for taking part in or standing against the rebellion, betrayal and conflict. Historically, the April Uprising of 1876 failed due to bad organization, limited resources, and betrayal. The brutal way in which the Ottomans broke down the uprising became the pretext for the Russian-Turkish war, Illustrated history of the Russo- Turkish war in 1877-1878 that brought about Bulgarian independence. The book has many autobiographical elements: Sopot is the writer's hometown, and he did take a personal part in the uprising described. Reactions Mary C. Neuburger has described the novel's coffeehouse scenes as a \\"social panorama\\" of Ganko's kafene (small Bulgarian coffeehouse) featuring a \\"parade of archetypal characters from a Balkan mountain town in Ottoman Bulgaria who drink bitter coffee, ruminate, and debate, laugh and observe, within a 'dense fog of tobacco smoke'\\". She writes that Vazov \\"skillfully paints a late Ottoman landscape\\" leading to the April Uprising of 1876.

CAAs are intended to promote self-sufficiency, and they depend heavily on volunteer work, especially from the low-income community. The Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) is the agencies' core federal funding. Agencies also operate a variety of grants that come from federal, state and local sources. These grants vary widely among agencies, although most CAAs operate Head Start programs, which focus on early child development. Other programs frequently administered by Community Action Agencies include Low-Income Home Energy Assistance (LIHEAP) utility grants and Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) funded through the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). Each CAA is governed by a board of directors consisting of at least one-third low-income community members, one-third public officials, and up to one-third private sector leaders. This board structure is defined by federal statute and is known as a tripartite board. U.S. Code Title 42 Chapter 9910 There are currently over 1,000 CAAs, engaged in a broad range of activities; typical activities include promoting citizen participation, providing utility bill assistance and home weatherization for low-income individuals, administration of Head Start pre- school programs, job training, operating food pantries, and coordinating community initiatives.Community Action Partnership website History In 1964, the U.S. poverty rate (income-based) included 19 percent of Americans. Rising political forces demanded change. Under a new White House Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), the concept of the federally-funded, local Community Action Program (CAP)—delivered by a local Community Action Agency (CAA), in a nationwide Community Action Network—would become the primary vehicle for a new, federal War on Poverty.Bell, Mike, Office Assistant, Community Action, Inc., \\"History of Community Action Agencies,\\" circa 2010 (on website of Northeast Kansas Community Action Program Inc., Hiawatha, Kansas)A Brief History of Community Action , (slideshow), circa 2013, presented by Jovita A.

In concept, a Community Action Program was defined as a program \\"...which provides services, assistance, and other activities of sufficient scope and size to give promise of progress toward elimination of poverty or a cause or causes of poverty through developing employment opportunities, improving human performance, motivation, and productivity, or bettering the conditions under which people live, learn, and work.\\"The Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, August 1964\\"Public Deliberation in an Age of Direct Citizen Participation,\\" academic essay by Nancy Roberts, professor of strategic management, Graduate School of Business and Public Policy, Naval Postgraduate School, as extracted from her article \\"Age of Direct Citizen Participation,\\" in Amer. Review of Public Admin., Vol. 34 No. 4, December 2004, pp.315-353, Sage Publications (posted on Univ. of Minn. website). A controversial feature of the Act was the requirement for \\"maximum feasible participation\\" of the people directly affected (the poor, basically) in the decision-making about how federal funds would be spent on them, in their community. This flew in the face of long- established power structures, where elected city councils, county commissions, state and federal officials ruled over everything—mostly people from the power elite and upper-class communities. The notion that the poor should have a say in their affairs created some opposition at first, but was in keeping with America's civil rights and reform movements, and War on Poverty, in the 1960s and 1970s, and generally accepted, at least at first.Examination of \\"widespead citizen participation\\" in the Model Cities Program and the demands of ethnic minorities for a greater decision making role in American cities, Model Cities 152A, by Ricardo A. Millett, 1977, published by R&E; Research Associates, San Francisco; full text (scanned) at Archive.org .) In each community, the local Community Action Program (CAP) was provided by a local non-profit Community Action Agency (CAA), overseen by a board made up—initially—of residents of the target neighborhood or population being served. This gave citizens in each region a voice in how they would be served by federal funds aimed at improving their lives. However, this caused some anger and frustration among the nation's power establishment, especially in local governments used to running their communities, and among the power elites (particularly in the business community) used to dominating their local governments.\\"Mayor Daley on the Community Action Program,\\" audio recording Dec 24, 1965: conversation excerpt (President Johnson and Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley discuss Daley's strong objection to the poor controlling community action programs serving their communities), Conversation Number: WH6512.04-9329, The Miller Center Problems, pushback, pullback, and successes Lyndon Johnson Although Johnson and other architects of the legislation expected Community Action Programs and Agencies to be an effective weapon in his War on Poverty, many of them were riddled with problems. In more extreme instances, local political regimes were threatened by the empowerment of poor political activists with funding and resources from the federal government. :One of the most dramatic episodes resulting from these clashes between CAA leaders and local governments occurred when, following cuts in funding for a summer youth CAP, black activist Charles Sizemore and thirty others barged into San Francisco Mayor John Shelley's office demanding resources and threatening that if the CAP was not funded once again, \\"this goddamn town's gonna blow.\\" By the mid/late-1960s, many political leaders—including President Johnson, U.S. Senator Richard Russell (D-GA) (leader of the anti-civil rights conservative coalition), and Chicago's powerful Mayor Richard J. Daley—publicly or privately expressed displeasure with the power-sharing that the CAA brought to poor neighborhoods.\\"LBJ and Senator Richard Russell on the Community Action Program ,\\" audio recording Jun 02, 1966: conversation excerpt (President Johnson and Georgia Sen. Richard Russell express dislike and distrust of Community Action Program), Conversation Number: WH6606.01 #10205, The Miller Center In 1967, conservative and establishment pressures brought two amendments to the Congressional funding bill for the OEO (Office of Economic Opportunity—overseer of the CAA/CAP programs): * The Green Amendment gave city governments the right to decide which entity would be the official CAA for their community. * The Quie Amendment gave two-thirds of the seats on CAA boards to elected city officials and \\"private sector representatives\\" (businesspeople), effectively outnumbering neighborhood citizens on their own CAA boards. The net result was a halt to the citizen participation reform movement and a fundamental shift of power away from the nation's poor. Nevertheless, some federal emphasis on anti-poverty programs remained, including the (modified) CAP/CAA system. By 1973, the U.S. poverty rate dropped to 11.1 percent, a 7.9 percent decrease in 10 years, and the lowest it would be between 1959 and 2004. One of the ways in which the CAAs were clearly effective in combatting poverty––and unexpectedly so––was by increasing the public's awareness of already existing welfare programs, such as Aid to Families with Dependent Children. Indeed, between 1960 and 1973, and especially in the years following the passage of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, spending on the AFDC quadrupled as the number of individuals who enrolled in the program rose sharply. Conservative backlash During the conservative-backlash era of the late 1970s, 1980s and 1990s as the federal government (under Presidents Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush) cut away programs for the poor, the CAPs and CAAs were defunded, underfunded, or warped into a strange variation of their original intent, with far less influence of the poor in how they would be served by these entities. The troubled economy of the mid-to-late 1970s, brought on by the energy crisis and the early 1980s recession was especially hard on America’s poor. Between 1973 and 1983, the national poverty rate rose from 11.1% to 15.2%. Another decade later, in 1993, the poverty rate was virtually unchanged at 15.1%, just a 0.1% decrease from 1983. Between 1993 and 2004, the U.S. poverty rate first declined (from 15.1% in 1993, to 11.3% in 2000), but then increased to 12.7% by 2004. The 2008 poverty rate was 13.2%. Today However, despite these challenges, around 1,000 CAPs (and their CAAs) still operate today, across the United States.

The Primate of the Church is the Archbishop of Central Africa. Albert Chama is the current Archbishop, being installed on 20 March 2011, succeeding Bernard Amos Malango who retired in 2007. From 1980 to 2000, Walter Khotso Makhulu, a noted Anti-Apartheid activist, was Archbishop as well as Bishop of Botswana. Archbishop Chama continues to serve as Bishop of Northern Zambia, and is the second Zambian to be Archbishop of Central Africa.Anglican Communion News Service: Zambian bishop installed as sixth Archbishop of Central Africa Province History The Cathedral Church of Saint Peter in Likoma, Malawi. In 1861, the first Anglican missionary to the area was Charles Mackenzie, who arrived with David Livingstone. In 1855, he went to Natal with Bishop Colenso. They worked among the English settlers until 1859. In 1860, Mackenzie became head of the Universities' Mission to Central Africa; and he was consecrated bishop in St George's Cathedral, Cape Town, on 1 January 1861. Following David Livingstone's request to Cambridge, Mackenzie took on the position of being the first missionary Bishop in Malawi (Nyasaland). Moving from Cape Town, he arrived at Chibisa’s village in June 1861 with the goal to establish a mission station at Magomero, near Zomba. Bishop Mackenzie worked among the people of the Manganja country until January 1862 when he went on a supplies trip together with a few members of his party. The boat they were travelling on, sank and as medical supplies were lost, Bishop Mackenzie’s malaria could not be treated. He died of Blackwater fever on 31 January 1862. There is an International school named after Mackenzie, which teaches children from 4 to 17 and is found in Lilongwe the capital of Malawi. The independent Church of the Province of Central Africa was inaugurated in 1955 and has a movable primacy. The inauguration service was on 8 May 1955; Geoffrey Fisher, Archbishop of Canterbury his jurisdiction over Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland and Geoffrey Clayton, Archbishop of Cape Town relinquished his over Mashonaland and Matabeleland. Membership Today, there are at least 600,000 Anglicans out of an estimated population of 31,780,000.  Structure  David Livingstone memorial at Victoria Falls. Livingstone requested the first missionary bishop for the Church. The polity of the Church of the Province of Central Africa is Episcopalian church governance, which is the same as other Anglican churches. The church maintains a system of geographical parishes organized into dioceses. There are 15 of these, each headed by a bishop. The Primate and Metropolitan is the Archbishop of Central Africa. * The Diocese of BotswanaThe Rt Revd Trevor Mwamba, Bishop of Botswana, is portrayed in The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency books by Alexander McCall Smith and appears as himself in the TV series. * in Zambia : ** The Diocese of Central Zambia ** The Diocese of Eastern Zambia ** The Diocese of Lusaka ** The Diocese of Luapula ** The Diocese of Northern Zambia * in Zimbabwe : ** The Diocese of Central Zimbabwehttp://www.anglicancommunion.org/structures/member- churches/member-church/diocese.aspx?church=central-africa&dio;=central- zimbabwe ** The Diocese of Harare ** The Diocese of Masvingo (Anglican) ** The Diocese of Matabeleland ** The Diocese of Manicaland * in Malawi (former Nyasaland) : ** The Diocese of Lake Malawi ** The Diocese of Northern Malawi ** The Diocese of Southern Malawi ** The Diocese of Southern Malawi-Upper Shire There are 250 congregations and about 400 priests in the Church of the Province of Central Africa. Doctrine and practice The centre of the Church of the Province of Central Africa teaching is the life and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The basic teachings of the church, or catechism, include: *Jesus Christ is fully human and fully God. He died and was resurrected from the dead. *Jesus provides the way of eternal life for those who believe. *The Old and New Testaments of the Bible were written by people \\"under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit\\". The Apocrypha are additional books that are used in Christian worship, but not for the formation of doctrine. *The two great and necessary sacraments are Holy Baptism and Holy Eucharist *Other sacramental rites are confirmation, ordination, marriage, reconciliation of a penitent, and unction. *Belief in heaven, hell, and Jesus's return in glory. The threefold sources of authority in Anglicanism are scripture, tradition, and reason (borrowing from Thomas Aquinas). These three sources uphold and critique each other in a dynamic way. This balance of scripture, tradition and reason is traced to the work of Richard Hooker, a sixteenth-century apologist. In Hooker's model, scripture is the primary means of arriving at doctrine and things stated plainly in scripture are accepted as true. Issues that are ambiguous are determined by tradition, which is checked by reason.Anglican Listening Detail on how scripture, tradition, and reason work to \\"uphold and critique each other in a dynamic way\\". Minor differences of doctrine should not damn or save the soul but are frameworks surrounding the moral and religious life of the believer. Church governance by bishops was biblical and traditional, but this was not license for absolutism. Ministry, liturgy and ecumenical relations The Church of the Province of Central Africa embraces three orders of ministry: deacon, priest, and bishop. The Church of the Province of Central Africa does not ordain women. Local variants of the Book of Common Prayer are used in worship. Like many other Anglican churches, it is also a member of the ecumenical World Council of Churches.World Council of Churches Anglican realignment The Church of the Province of Central Africa is a member of the Global South. Former Archbishop Bernard Malango was involved in the Anglican realignment, while current Archbishop Albert Chama, despite having attended the Global South Fourth Encounter held in Singapore, on 19–23 April 2010, has been a supporter of \\"reconciliation\\" between the conservative and the liberal Anglican provinces. The Dioceses of Northern Malawi and Southern Malawi-Upper Shire were listed as \\"mission partners\\" of the Anglican Mission in the Americas, but aren't anymore.

Originally part of DeSoto County, Palmdale's land was pioneered by Florida Fruit Farm Corporation, selling the land to the Palmdale Land Company, which sold the land to five-hundred settlers, creating the first community in 1911. Many farmers were \\"discouraged\\" by the lack of transportation, prompting them to move out of the area by 1917. Many of these farmers left their homes behind, along with their personal belongings and furniture. New farmers and pioneers to the area would take up residence in the abandoned homesteads. Eventually, wildfires destroyed many of the original homesteads. The earliest descriptions of Palmdale describe residents that \\"can-do, make-do, and out- do,\\" which are \\"Crackers to the core, with staunch tradition of loyalty to God, family, home and country.\\" The \\"Tin Lizzie Trail,\\" two dirt roads connected Arcadia and Lakeport. During rainy season, the longer \\"high road\\" of the trail was used while the more direct \\"low road\\" of the trail was used during the dry season. Most people moved to Palmdale to farm the land and sell livestock. Adrian M. Link grew \\"several large citrus groves\\" and was a poultry farmer. \\"Mr. Fogg\\" described Palmdale as \\"The Garden of Eden.\\" Fog covered his land with blueberries, which were completely eaten by the birds. Palmdale's original settlers were the Rean family, H.L. Delaney family, Ross family, Hart family, Snell family, Arnold family, Lanier family, Weinser family, A.Z. Hogan family, Wibb family, Streety Whidden family, Hendry family, Jones family, Cobb family, Willie Williams family, Norman Milton, Emery Nickelson, Lacy Raulerson and Joe Peeples, Sr. There was also \\"a Mr. Thompson who ran a store at the railroad camp.\\" The original teachers were Mr. Locke, Arthur HIlton, Mary Clark, Maud Allison, Alton P. Gaines, Hilda Yeomans, Edith Pervis, Edith Daughtery and Rual Haskew. There were not any churches built in Palmdale until the Baptist church, in the 1950s. Until then, church was held in people's homes. H.C. Delaney operated the first general store and post office, followed by J.W. Snell, L.E. Guess and Peck Stalls. For thirty-six years, Peck Stalls held the office of postmaster. The post office moved to its own building after Stalls sold the general store. Mrs. Willie Powers then took over as \\"postmistress.\\" At some time, Palmdale also featured a photo studio. Palmdale's economy was stimulated by a short \\"boom\\" in the early 1920s, with political rallies held at Fisheating Creek. \\"Barbecues and political speeches were attended by as many as 500-700 people.\\" A train from Moore Haven, the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, brought people who wanted to attend the rallies. Oil drilling began in 1921 by the Palmdale Land Company under the supervision of company president \\"Mr. Marcus\\" and vice-president E.F. Caldwell. Through invitation of Caldwell, the Brewton Oil Company began drilling under the guidance of Robert J. Brewton due to the fact that Caldwell was \\"positive oil would be found.\\" Gopher Gulley and Harness Pond were the first two sites drilled, Harness Pond to 2,800 feet, only to turn up dry. After failing to find oil, Brewton Oil left. Geologists Smith Brooks and Ed Barnett claimed that the Harness Pond well \\"was not deep enough\\" at 2,800 feet.

He was the vice-president of the Union générale des étudiants du Québec (UGEQ) (General Union of Quebec Students) in 1968 and 1969. During 1969 and 1970 he taught at Cégep Édouard-Montpetit and the Cégep du Vieux Montréal. Before running provincially, Charron participated in the foundation of the Mouvement Souveraineté-Association in 1967. He was also an anti-Vietnam War activist and expressed an interest in syndicalism. In 1970, Claude Charron entered provincial politics. He was elected to the National Assembly of Quebec as the Parti Québécois candidate in the riding of Saint-Jacques (now part of Sainte-Marie–Saint-Jacques) and was reelected in 1973, 1976, and 1981. At the time of his first election, Charron became the youngest MNA (Member of the National Assembly (Quebec)) in the province's history. Following the election of his party to power in 1976 he was appointed Minister responsible for High Commission on Youth, Recreation and Sports and in 1979 was named the Government House Leader and Minister responsible for Parliamentary Affairs. In February 1982 Charron resigned his cabinet position after pleading guilty to a charge of shoplifting a tweed jacket from the Eaton's Montreal department store.\\"Public figures nabbed for shoplifting,\\" Montreal GazetteAugust 23, 2015.

In November of that year he was charged with drunk driving and resigned his seat in the Quebec National Assembly. The following year Charron published his memoir in the French language under the title Désobéir. In this book he confirmed his homosexuality.

The population of the Barnwell ward of Cambridge City Council at the 2011 Census was 1,967. It lies northeast of the city, with Cambridge Airport located immediately to the east. It forms part of the ecclesiastical parish of St Andrew the Less and was the site of Barnwell Priory. Barnwell is also home to the Leper Chapel near the Newmarket Road bridge over the railway at Barnwell Junction. Built in 1125 the chapel is one of the oldest buildings in Cambridge. History The history of Barnwell effectively began with the creation of the house of Canons Regular in 1092 by Picot, Lord of Bourn and Madingley and sheriff of Cambridgeshire at the time of the Domesday Book. The house was originally near Cambridge Castle but moved to Barnwell in around 1119 and became Barnwell Priory. The former railway station of Barnwell Junction in 1963 By the 14th century the city of Cambridge was divided into seven wards, of which the smallest was Barnwell Ward, believed to cover the few houses along the Newmarket Road that fell outside the city's Barnwell Gate. In 1835 the city comprised five wards: East Barnwell, West Barnwell, Market, Trinity, and St. Andrew's, demonstrating the development in the area. Of the city's current fourteen wards, the Barnwell area is covered by the Abbey Ward, which itself takes its name from Barnwell Priory. By the mid-19th century, Barnwell was a rough area inhabited predominantly by railway workers and manual labourers such as those mining fossil beds. Ion Keith-Falconer opened a mission in a local theatre in 1875 in an attempt to reduce poverty in the area. The astronomer William Scott also worked in the slums in the 1850s as a curate. Barnwell Junction railway station opened in 1884 as the first station on the Cambridge to Mildenhall railway. It closed in 1962 Barnwell Junction Station but the station building including an old passenger car and about a hundred yards of track (disconnected) still exist and are privately owned. The name \\"Barnwell\\" is believed to derive from Bairn Well - and refers to a well where children would gather for amusements at the midsummer festival. This etymology was recorded in the 17th Century by William Dugdale in the Monasticon. An alternative etymology posits that the name derives from Beornewelle, the name Barnwell means \\"well of Beorna\\", where Beorna is a name meaning \\"warrior\\". This etymology is however largely speculative - since no references to a \\"well of beorna\\" exist in the historic record for the area. Barnwell today Barnwell has long since ceased to exist as a separate entity, having been absorbed into the city of Cambridge. Now part of Abbey Ward, there is no official geographical entity bearing the name and it no longer appears on Ordnance Survey maps of Cambridge. The name lives on as the name of streets (Barnwell Road, Barnwell Drive), geographical features (Barnwell Lake), public services (East Barnwell Health Centre, East Barnwell Community Centre, Barnwell Baptist Church) and organisations (Barnwell Business Park, Barnwell Florists). Also the former station building still bears the sign \\"Barnwell Junction\\". Notable residents *The cricketer Jack Hobbs (1882-1963) was born in Barnwell.

Early life and education After a promising academic start he was promoted rapidly and served for a time as Dean of St Peter's Diocesan College in Wexford. In 1977 he was appointed to a senior lectureship in Dogmatic Theology at St Patrick's College, Maynooth under the College President, Dr Tomás Ó Fiaich. He remained at Maynooth for the next 16 years and advanced quickly up the ladder of offices, serving a term as Dean of the Faculty of Theology, before being appointed to the Chair of Systematic theology and later a College Vice-President. In 1985 Dr Ó Fiaich, by then Cardinal Archbishop of Armagh and one of the trustees of Maynooth, approved his appointment to the post of President of Maynooth,\\"The secret scandal John Magee will take to the grave\\", Irish Independent, 27 March 2010 which office carried an ex officio Pro-Vice- Chancellorship of the National University of Ireland and membership of the Conference of the Heads of Irish Universities. President of Maynooth The Presidency of Maynooth was, in 1985 when Ledwith was appointed to the role, a senior position within the Catholic Church in Ireland. Only 44, he proved a capable administrator at Maynooth; immediately prior to his resignation he presided over the separation of the National University of Ireland, Maynooth and the Pontifical College.Paul Cullen, \\"Smyth is set to be the master of NUI Maynooth\\", Irish Times 1 June 1994 He was regarded within the church as a progressive and in 1988 he was seen as a series contender for the vacant see of Dublin following the sudden death of Archbishop Kevin McNamara. His name was submitted to Rome as one of three possible candidates.Irish Times 1 January 2003 Ledwith's name submitted for Dublin archbishop post There was considerable surprise following the appointment of a University College Dublin academic, Professor Desmond Connell.At St Peters: The Dangers of a Priestly Education by Colm Tobin Ledwith was then appointed a Domestic Prelate with the title of Monsignor, and served for 17 years under Pope John Paul II as a member of the International Theological Commission, a group of theologians of international standing charged with advising the Holy See on theological matters. He also served as Chairman of the Conference of the Heads of Irish Universities and as a member of the Governing Bureau of the Conference of European University Rectors (CRE). Resignation and Abuse Allegation In 1994 as St Patrick's College, Maynooth approached its bicentenary due to be held the following year, Mgr Ledwith resigned as President, six months before his term of office was to end. In 1995, the Irish National Broadcaster, RTÉ, initiated inquiries with the college authorities into an allegation of sexual abuse of a minor male. The senior management at St Patrick's College, Maynooth initially said that this had not occasioned Mgr Ledwith's departure, however in response to later revelations in the press Ledwith's successor, Monsignor Dermot Farrell, and the Episcopal Trustees of the College issued a joint statement in 2002 admitting that an allegation had been made.\\"Church breaks its silence on departure of seminary head\\", Irish Independent 1 June 2002 Ledwith, they noted, had denied this strenuously but the College authorities had nevertheless commenced an investigation, and his Bishop, Dr Brendan Comiskey, had at the time informed both the Gardaí and the relevant Health Board. This process of investigation had commenced in or around 1995 but Ledwith, in the interim, came to a private legal settlement with the claimant which admitted no liability and included a confidentiality clause. This, they said, frustrated the continuing inquiry. Dr Ledwith remained in situ at the College for another two years after his resignation, and continued his professorship.Ledwith made settlement in abuse claim – RTE News website 31 May 2002 Gerard McGinnity In 1997 Dr Ledwith and the College reached a mutual understanding for a parting of ways and he was awarded a pension top-up of £100,000. He also agreed to leave his rooms on the College campus at this time. In 2002 the Irish media reported that a former seminarian was suing Mgr Ledwith over \\"an alleged incident\\" in 1994, after Ledwith's resignation.\\"Monsignor Michael Ledwith is named in civil suit by ex-student\\", Gorey Guardian 16 May 2002 The 2005 Ferns Report noted that the ex-student later withdrew the allegation and dropped the lawsuit. Controversies surrounding Ledwith's appointment as President of St Patrick's College, Maynooth in 1985 were discussed in the national media in 2002. It emerged that in 1983–84 Fr Gerard McGinnity, then Senior Dean of Maynooth, complained about Ledwith to seven bishops including the Bishop of Ferns, Dr Brendan Comiskey, who was championing Ledwith's appointment, Cardinal Tomás Ó Fiaich and Bishop Cahal Daly. The 2005 Ferns Report said that the complaints related to alleged homosexual \\"orientation and propensity\\" rather than any improper conduct. The then Bishop of Galway, Dr Eamon Casey, conducted a private investigation, and as no seminarian came forward to make a complaint, the matter was dropped. In the immediate aftermath, as McGinnity's position was deemed untenable, he was required to leave the College, and Dr Ledwith's appointment was confirmed. In response to the 2002 reports, the Bishop trustees took an opportunity to re- examine the process of appointment, and retained Denis McCullough Senior Counsel to investigate whether the complaints made against Mgr Ledwith had received an adequate response. McCullough's report, published on 16 June 2005, found that, while no seminarian had complained about Ledwith's conduct to the bishops directly, McGinnity had communicated \\"concerns of apparent propensities rather than accusations of actual crime or specific offences\\" to a number of bishops. McCullough concluded that \\"to have rejected the senior dean's concerns so completely and so abruptly without any adequate investigation may have been too precipitate, although, of course, to investigate in any very full or substantial manner, a generic complaint regarding a person's apparent propensities would have been difficult\\".Inquiry into certain matters relating to Maynooth College by Denis McCullough, Senior Counsel, March 2005 The Bishop's report, whilst critical, was found wanting in key respects and the matter was eventually debated in the Irish Senate in November 2005. Senator Mary Henry said: \\"With regard to Monsignor Ledwith, I was dismayed to read the response of the bishops to whom complaints were made by six senior seminarians, as they are described in the report, as well as the senior dean of Maynooth College, Fr Gerard McGinnity. Cardinal Daly, one of the surviving bishops, indicated in his statement to the inquiry that it was entirely untrue that any seminarian had mentioned homosexuality to him in connection with Monsignor Ledwith.\\"Speech by Dr M Henry, 2005 Ferns Report In 2005 the Ferns Report by a High Court Judge, Mr Justice Murphy, into the activities of certain priests of the Diocese of Ferns included various allegations made against Mgr Ledwith. In connection with the accusation of sexual abuse against a minor the Inquiry was hampered by the confidentiality clause agreed between Ledwith and the complainant, and the Ferns Report was unable to make any specific finding. It did, however, repeat the substance of accusations and noted that the complainant had alleged that the abuse began when he was 13 years old and lasted until he was 15. The Inquiry discovered that the Diocese of Ferns had spent substantial monies providing counselling for the complainant, and noted that Fr Walter Forde, who had investigated the allegation on behalf of the Diocese, reported to Bishop Brendan Comiskey that he found the accusation as 'capable of being true'. In response, Comiskey ordered Ledwith to attend a treatment centre in the United States in 1994, but he declined and commenced proceedings against Dr Comiskey under canon law. This resulted in the diocesan investigation ceasing as the complaint was discovered to be outside the Canonical Statute of Limitations, and Bishop Comiskey declined to pursue the matter by other means at his disposal. In connection with the parallel investigation undertaken by the Maynooth authorities Mgr Ledwith was initially open to a proposal waiving the confidentiality clause agreed with the complainant in the civil application, and this was also agreed to by the complainant. However Dr Ledwith subsequently changed his mind as he was dissatisfied with the conduct of the sub-committee of Trustees appointed to investigate. After a lengthy investigation he was summoned to the Archbishop's House in Dublin for further questioning, and attended with a solicitor and two Senior Counsel. There he informed the Sub-Committee that he felt that the procedure adopted was fundamentally flawed and unfair from the perspective of civil and canon law and he submitted his resignation as President of Maynooth. The Ferns Report, while making no comment on the substance of the allegation, was highly critical of Ledwith's behaviour and stated that \\"as with many other priests accused of child abuse\\" Ledwith \\"attacked the process rather than facing any charges\\".The Ferns Report, presented by Mr Justice Murphy on behalf of the Ferns Inquiry to the Minister for Health and Children (Dublin: Government Publications, October 2005) The Committee also examined the McGinnity affair and found inconsistencies in the evidence presented to the Commission by the surviving Bishops from 1985 and the seven former seminarians. The Bishops emphatically denied that there had been any allegations known of homosexual activity, whereas the former seminarians and Fr McGinnity in evidence directly contradicted the Bishops' submission. Ledwith, in his own evidence to the Commission, confirmed that Dr Comiskey had informed him that a charge of homosexuality had been made against him. At the time he had approached Cardinal Ó Fiaich, who was McGinnity's Bishop, and they had discussed the matter. He also asserted to the Inquiry that Dr McGinnity had been dismissed from his post not because of this incident, but rather due to grave concerns about indiscipline within the College during his time as senior Dean. The Inquiry also investigated a serious allegation made by one seminarian in 1994 and concluded that in this instance the complainant had proved unreliable. It was noted that the complainant had changed his statement to police and admitted that any alleged sexual activity had been consensual. The Commission also noted that Ledwith had co-operated fully with the Inquiry and had given direct oral evidence, where he had consistently asserted his innocence of all charges, though he declined to discuss any issues subject to a confidentiality clause. While critical, the Inquiry was unable to make any specific finding against Ledwith in regard to either the allegation of child abuse or the alleged harassment of seminarians. The sudden resignation of Micheál Ledwith in 1994 caused controversy in Ireland,Sunday Independent,\\"Child sex abuse: it is time to shout stop\\", 9 June 2002 and led to considerable criticism of the way the matter was handled by the Irish Hierarchy.Sunday Independent, \\"He is in cyberspace, we are left in limbo\\", 9 June 2002 In 2010 the appointment of an Apostolic Visitation from the Holy See to the Irish Church was charged, amongst other things, with investigating all Irish seminaries, and St Patrick's College, Maynooth in particular.New probe central to Pope’s message Sunday Business Post 21 March 2010 Post-clerical interests In 2002 Patsy McGarry, Religious Affairs Correspondent of the Irish Times, reported that Ledwith was lecturing with a New Age cult in the United States,Maynooth head now with US New Age school Patsy McGarry Religious Affairs Correspondent The Irish Times 8 May 2002 and in 2005 he was laicised.

The game employs only four balls, the cue ball and three numbered balls, the 1, 3 and 5. It is played to 101 points, with points being awarded for a host of different shot types. History The parent game of cowboy pool, English billiards, is itself a hybrid of three predecessor billiards games – the winning game, the losing game and the carambole game (an early form of straight rail) – and dates to approximately 1800 in England. There are a number of pocket billiard games directly descended from English billiards, including bull dog, scratch pool, thirty-one pool and thirty-eight. Thirty-eight is the intermediary game from which cowboy is directly derived. This precursor game was first reported on in The New York Times on January 21, 1885: 'there is a new billiards game called \\"thirty-eight.\\" It appears to have met with special favor among the many devotees of pool.'New York Times Company (January 21, 1885). THE THIRTY-EIGHT GAME. Retrieved December 13, 2006. Cowboy is very similar to thirty-eight, with the major difference being that thirty- eight requires the use of two cue balls and is played to just 38 points, thus its name. It is unknown how thirty-eight transitioned to the modified ruleset mandated by cowboy pool, nor the derivation of its name. What is known is that its first mention is in a 1908 rule book, published about the same time the well-known game eight-ball (under a prior name) was first gaining popularity. Although popular enough that its rules remain listed in authoritative rule books alongside just a handful of other games, apart from a small sanctioned tournament held in 1914, cowboy pool is strictly an amateur game. Rules There are numerous local variations. Conventional cowboy pool uses only four balls, the cue ball and three numbered balls, the 1, 3, and 5. The balls have a set opening placement: The 1 ball is placed on the ; the 3 ball on the ; and the 5 ball on the . As in the game of snooker, pocketed balls are immediately respotted to their starting position. Beginning with from the – the area behind a pool table's head string – the incoming player must contact the 3 ball first. If the player fails to do so, the opponent may either force the player to repeat the , or elect to break him or herself. For the first 90 points of the 101 needed to win the game, points are scored in three ways: 1 point for the cue ball into any two object balls; 2 points for caroming into all three ; and a player scores the face value of any ball pocketed (e.g. if the 3 ball is pocketed, the player scores 3 points). Thus, the maximum score possible on any single shot is 11 points, achieved by caroming off and pocketing all three balls. The failure to score in one of the delineated manners on any shot ends the player's at the table. All in cowboy pool result in the player losing all points scored during the inning (not just those on the fouled stroke), and the opposing player comes to the table with cue ball in position except in the case of a , which results in ball-in-hand from the kitchen. The 90th point in cowboy pool must be reached exactly and the failure to do so is a foul resulting in a loss of turn. For example, this means that a player with 89 points, who then scores 2 points rather than exactly 1, has committed a foul. Once the 90 point benchmark is reached, all points up to the penultimate 100 must be made by caroms. The pocketing of balls during this phase of the game garners no points. The final point necessary to reach 101 and the win must be made by a – an intentional scratch made by caroming the cue ball off one of the three object balls.

It was directed by Lewis Milestone, written by Lillian Hellman and featured production design by William Cameron Menzies. The film starred Anne Baxter, Dana Andrews, Walter Huston, Walter Brennan and Erich von Stroheim. The music was written by Aaron Copland, the lyrics by Ira Gershwin, and the cinematography was by James Wong Howe. The film also marked the debut of Farley Granger. The film is about the resistance of Ukrainian villagers, through guerrilla tactics, against the German invaders of the Ukrainian SSR. The film was an unabashedly pro-Soviet propaganda film at the height of the war. In the 1950s it was criticized for this reason and it was re-cut to remove the idealized portrayal of Soviet collective farms at the beginning and to include references to the Hungarian Uprising of 1956. Plot Title. In June 1941 Ukrainian villagers are living in peace. As the school year ends, a group of friends decide to travel to Kiev for a holiday. To their horror, they find themselves attacked by German aircraft, part of the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union. Eventually their village itself is occupied by the Nazis. Meanwhile, men and women take to the hills to form partisan militias. The full brutality of the Nazis is revealed when the Germans send Dr. von Harden to use the village children as a source of blood for transfusions into wounded German soldiers. Some children lose so much blood that they die. When Dr. Pavel Kurin, a famous Russian doctor, discovers this and informs the partisans, they prepare to strike back. They launch a cavalry assault on the village to rescue the children. The Russian doctor accuses the German doctor of being worse than the convinced Nazis, because he has used his skills to support them. He then shoots him. The peasants join together, and one girl envisions a future in which they will \\"make a free world for all men\\".

Similar U.S. World War II movies are RKO Radio Pictures's Days of Glory on Russian resistance in the Tula Oblast and MGM's Dragon Seed on Chinese efforts against the Japanese occupation. The extent to which the film incorporated official Soviet propaganda about collective farms prompted British anti-communist writer Robert Conquest, a member of the British Foreign Office's Information Research Department (an anti-communist propaganda unit) in the 1950s, to later write \\"a travesty greater than could have been shown on Soviet screens to audiences used to lies, but experienced in [collective-farm conditions] to a degree requiring at least a minimum of restraint\\".The Harvest of Sorrow: Soviet Collectivization and the Terror Famine, Conquest, page 321, Oxford Press, 1986; see Chapter 17 for detailed information on the efforts of pro-Soviet Westerns to help the regime cover up the true conditions on the collective farms. Recut The film was rereleased in 1957 under the title Armored Attack. This edited version opens with the entry of a German column marching into a village and concludes with narration praising the Hungarian Uprising of 1956. In later years, the original version was made available on home video restoring segments removed for the 1957 re-release.

The problem is now recognized as a general one that applies to all nonexperimental studies and to experimental design as well. It is most simply described as the problem of external dependencies in making statistical estimates when the elements sampled are not statistically independent. Asking two people in the same household whether they watch TV, for example, does not give you statistically independent answers. The sample size, n, for independent observations in this case is one, not two. Once proper adjustments are made that deal with external dependencies, then the axioms of probability theory concerning statistical independence will apply. These axioms are important for deriving measures of variance, for example, or tests of statistical significance. Origin In 1888, Galton was present when Sir Edward Tylor presented a paper at the Royal Anthropological Institute. Tylor had compiled information on institutions of marriage and descent for 350 cultures and examined the correlations between these institutions and measures of societal complexity. Tylor interpreted his results as indications of a general evolutionary sequence, in which institutions change focus from the maternal line to the paternal line as societies become increasingly complex. Galton disagreed, pointing out that similarity between cultures could be due to borrowing, could be due to common descent, or could be due to evolutionary development; he maintained that without controlling for borrowing and common descent one cannot make valid inferences regarding evolutionary development. Galton's critique has become the eponymous Galton's Problem,Stocking, George W. Jr. (1968). \\"Edward Burnett Tylor.\\" International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences. David L. Sills, editor, New York, Mcmillan Company: v.16, pp. 170–177. as named by Raoul Naroll, who proposed the first statistical solutions. By the early 20th century unilineal evolutionism was abandoned and along with it the drawing of direct inferences from correlations to evolutionary sequences. Galton's criticisms proved equally valid, however, for inferring functional relations from correlations. The problem of autocorrelation remained. Solutions Statistician William S. Gosset in 1914 developed methods of eliminating spurious correlation due to how position in time or space affects similarities. Today's election polls have a similar problem: the closer the poll to the election, the less individuals make up their mind independently, and the greater the unreliability of the polling results, especially the margin of error or confidence limits. The effective n of independent cases from their sample drops as the election nears. Statistical significance falls with lower effective sample size. The problem pops up in sample surveys when sociologists want to reduce the travel time to do their interviews, and hence they divide their population into local clusters and sample the clusters randomly, then sample again within the clusters. If they interview n people in clusters of size m the effective sample size (efs) would have a lower limit of if everyone in each cluster were identical. When there are only partial similarities within clusters, the m in this formula has to be lowered accordingly. A formula of this sort is where d is the intraclass correlation for the statistic in question. In general, estimation of the appropriate efs depends on the statistic estimated, as for example, mean, chi-square, correlation, regression coefficient, and their variances. For cross-cultural studies, Murdock and White estimated the size of patches of similarities in their sample of 186 societies. The four variables they tested – language, economy, political integration, and descent – had patches of similarities that varied from size three to size ten. A very crude rule of thumb might be to divide the square root of the similarity-patch sizes into n, so that the effective sample sizes are 58 and 107 for these patches, respectively. Again, statistical significance falls with lower effective sample size. In modern analysis spatial lags have been modelled in order to estimate the degree of globalization on modern societies. abstract Spatial dependency or auto-correlation is a fundamental concept in geography. Methods developed by geographers that measure and control for spatial autocorrelationCliff, A.D., and J.K. Ord. 1973. Spatial Autocorrelation. London: Pion Press.Cliff, A.D. and J.K. Ord. 1981. Spatial Processes. London: Pion Press. do far more than reduce the effective n for tests of significance of a correlation. One example is the complicated hypothesis that \\"the presence of gambling in a society is directly proportional to the presence of a commercial money and to the presence of considerable socioeconomic differences and is inversely related to whether or not the society is a nomadic herding society.\\" Tests of this hypothesis in a sample of 60 societies failed to reject the null hypothesis. Autocorrelation analysis, however, showed a significant effect of socioeconomic differences. How prevalent is autocorrelation among the variables studied in cross-cultural research? A test by Anthon Eff on 1700 variables in the cumulative database for the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample, published in World Cultures, measured Moran's I for spatial autocorrelation (distance), linguistic autocorrelation (common descent), and autocorrelation in cultural complexity (mainline evolution). \\"The results suggest that ... it would be prudent to test for spatial and phylogenetic autoccorrelation when conducting regression analyses with the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample.\\" The use of autocorrelation tests in exploratory data analysis is illustrated, showing how all variables in a given study can be evaluated for nonindependence of cases in terms of distance, language, and cultural complexity. The methods for estimating these autocorrelation effects are then explained and illustrated for ordinary least squares regression using again the Moran I significance measure of autocorrelation. When autocorrelation is present, it can often be removed to get unbiased estimates of regression coefficients and their variances by constructing a respecified dependent variable that is \\"lagged\\" by weightings on the dependent variable on other locations, where the weights are degree of relationship. This lagged dependent variable is endogenous, and estimation requires either two-stage least squares or maximum likelihood methods.Anselin, Luc. 1988. Spatial Econometrics: Methods and Models.

Opportunities In anthropology, where Tylor's problem was first recognized by the statistician Galton in 1889, it is still not widely recognized that there are standard statistical adjustments for the problem of patches of similarity in observed cases and opportunities for new discoveries using autocorrelation methods. Some cross-cultural researchers (see, e.g., Korotayev and de Munck 2003) have begun to realize that evidence of diffusion, historical origin, and other sources of similarity among related societies or individuals should be renamed Galton's Opportunity and Galton's Asset rather than Galton's Problem. Researchers now use longitudinal, cross-cultural, and regional variation analysis routinely to analyze all the competing hypotheses: functional relationships, diffusion, common historical origin, multilineal evolution, co-adaptation with environment, and complex social interaction dynamics. Controversies Within anthropology, Galton's problem is often given as a cause to reject comparative studies altogether. Since the problem is a general one, common to the sciences and statistical inference generally, this particular criticism of cross-cultural or comparative studies – and there are many – is one that, logically speaking, amounts to a rejection of science and statistics altogether. Any data collected and analyzed by ethnographers, for example, is equally subject to Galton's problem, understood in its most general sense. A critique of the anticomparative critique is not limited to statistical comparison since it would apply as well to the analysis of text. That is, the analysis and use of text in argumentation is subject to critique as to the evidential basis of inference. Reliance purely on rhetoric is no protection against critique as to the validity of argument and its evidentiary basis. There is little doubt, however, that the community of cross-cultural researchers have been remiss in ignoring Galton's problem. Expert investigation of this question shows results that \\"strongly suggest that the extensive reporting of naïve chi-square independence tests using cross- cultural data sets over the past several decades has led to incorrect rejection of null hypotheses at levels much higher than the expected 5% rate.\\" The investigator concludes that \\"Incorrect theories that have been 'saved' by naïve chi-square tests with comparative data may yet be more rigorously tested another day.\\" Once again, the adjusted variance of a cluster sample is given as one multiplied by 1 + d (k + 1) where k is the average size of a cluster, and a more complicated correction is given for the variance of contingency table correlations with r rows and c columns. Since this critique was published in 1993, and others like it, more authors have begun to adopt corrections for Galton's problem, but the majority in the cross-cultural field have not. Consequently, a large proportion of published results that rely on naive significance tests and that adopt the P < 0.05 rather than a P < 0.005 standard are likely to be in error because they are more susceptible to type I error, which is to reject the null hypothesis when it is true. Some cross- cultural researchers reject the seriousness of Galton's problem because, they argue, estimates of correlations and means may be unbiased even if autocorrelation, weak or strong, is present. Without investigating autocorrelation, however, they may still mis-estimate statistics dealing with relationships among variables. In regression analysis, for example, examining the patterns of autocorrelated residuals may give important clues to third factors that may affect the relationships among variables but that have not been included in the regression model. Second, if there are clusters of similar and related societies in the sample, measures of variance will be underestimated, leading to spurious statistical conclusions. for example, exaggerating the statistical significance of correlations. Third, the underestimation of variance makes it difficult to test for replication of results from two different samples, as the results will more often be rejected as similar.

He began playing at age twelve, recording on several labels, including Discovery, Hep and Concord. However, he sought an engineering degree and followed that profession for nearly 30 years. In 1981 he returned to recording music. Early life Robinson was born in Kenosha, Wisconsin on January 16, 1930. Beginning on alto saxophone in his early years, Robinson soon discovered that it was hard to make a living playing the kind of music he wanted to play. Later life and career In 1948, Robinson joined the US Navy as a musician and by 1950 was based in the UK. He was soon regularly jamming at London's Club Eleven, Downbeat Club and Studio 51 with leading UK beboppers, including Tommy Pollard, Johnny Dankworth and Victor Feldman. He made a few records for Carlo Krahmer's Esquire label but eventually was transferred home and demobilized. Unhappy with the music scene in the Chicago area, he took advantage of the G.I. Bill to study electronic engineering at university. For most of the next 30 years he lived and worked in Colorado, eventually taking up music again, this time playing tenor saxophone and working nights at local clubs. A constant musical companion of these times was Dave Grusin. In 1981, Robinson recorded for the first time since his London sessions, which also featured pianist Victor Feldman and bassist Ray Brown. His album was Spike Robinson Plays Harry Warren. Encouraged to visit the UK by a British fan, in 1984 Robinson began a series of tours which were so successful that he took early retirement from his engineering job to turn to a full-time career in music, appearing with established British jazz musicians such as fellow tenor Dick Morrissey, pianist Bill Le Sage, bassist Alec Dankworth and drummer Bill Eyden, among others. Throughout the rest of the 1980s and into the early 1990s, he played at clubs and festivals throughout the UK, Europe and in various parts of the USA, making his New York debut at Christmas 1990. A succession of albums, most as leader but some with artists such as Louis Stewart, Harry Edison, Al Cohn, Roy Williams and Claude Tissendier, attracted high critical and public praise. Despite his bebop beginnings, the mature musician who emerged in the 1980s from self-imposed exile was a consummate ballad player who explored the endless archives of the Great American Songbook. His rhapsodic, breathy style is instantly identifiable and the effortless loping swing of everything he played. In the early 1990s, Robinson was touring extensively from a UK base, recording many albums and headlining at clubs and festivals in Europe and the USA. He moved to England in 1989. He died in Writtle, Essex on October 29, 2001. Playing style \\"Robinson's playing was characterised by a mellow tone, unaggressive approach and a deep affinity with the classic American song. Broadly speaking, he was one of that school of tenor saxophonists who followed in the wake of Lester Young, players such as Stan Getz and Zoot Sims, but he had developed his own highly engaging voice within that style.\\" Discography * At Chesters Volume 1 (Hep, 1984) * At Chesters Volume 2 (Hep, 1984) * The Gershwin Collection (Hep, 1987) * Live at the Bull – Tribute Vols. 1–2 (Bull's Head Music, 1987–88) * Three for the Road (Hep, 1989) * Stairway to the Stars (Hep, 1990) * Spike Robinson and George Masso Play Arlen (Hep, 1991) * Plays Harry Warren (Hep, 1981–93) * The CTS Session (Hep, 1998) * Young Lions Old Tigers (Hep, 2000) * I Wish I Knew - Live in Dublin 1979.

Davisville NCBC It was located at Quonset Point on Narragansett Bay, an area now included in the town of North Kingstown. The Navy acquired the property in 1939 and built Naval Air Station Quonset Point. In 1942, adjoining properties were developed for training Seabees, including the Naval Construction Battalion Center (NCBC) at Davisville. After World War II, the Naval Air Station remained in operation, but the NCBC was inactive until 1951, when the site was designated Headquarters, NCBC. The Naval Air Station was decommissioned in 1974. NCBC Davisville was selected for closure during the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC 1991) program and operational closure occurred on April 1, 1994. The land eventually was obtained by the State of Rhode Island. Redevelopment The State of Rhode Island has invested heavily into the transportation infrastructure of the Quonset Business Park, including rail, water/sewer, and the $170 million Rte 403 Connector, a 4-lane highway connecting the Park to Route 4. Today, the Park is the largest industrial park by employment levels in R.I. It is located on Narragansett Bay, Route 1 and Route 403. This master-planned business park had, in 2007, nearly 150 businesses with infrastructure capacity for 18,000 total employees. The largest business is General Dynamics Electric Boat. Also located in the Park is the North Atlantic Distribution, Inc (NORAD),http://www.noradinc.com/overview.php the 7th largest automobile importer in North America. In 2011, the facility imported 150,519 autos and another 41,797 autos came by rail.https://www.ri.gov/press/view/15990 There are some thousand cars at any time stored within the Park. Within the park, the Quonset State Airport, which uses the former Navy Air Station Quonset Point runway, is managed by the Rhode Island Airport Corporation, is a general aviation facility with an runway. Also located within the park are the Seabee Museum and Memorial Park, a non-profit museum developed by on by former U.S. Navy Seabees which includes the former Navy concrete chapel, seven vintage Quonset huts, and a huge Seabee statue; and the non-profit Quonset Air Museum located in buildings that were originally built for the Naval Air Station Quonset Point (NASQP). In 2007, the State of Rhode Island announced plans for a $150-million mega-yacht shipbuilding and repair yard that includes a training center on within the Park, and an $80 million mixed-use development: The Gateway Project. The over Gateway Project will include a hotel, visitor center, local grocer, drug store, coffee shop, restaurants, a bank, small shops, two anchor stores and will surround the Seabee Museum and Memorial Park.

He is traditionally associated with Pembrokeshire, where several churches are dedicated to him. Life The Church of St Brynach's ruins, Cwm-yr-Eglwys A 12th-century account of Brynach's life states that sometime in the early 6th century, Brynach travelled (from where is unstated) to Rome\\"Life of St. Brynach\\", Vitae Sanctorum Britanniae et Genealogiae, ed. A. W. Wade-Evans. Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1944 and Brittany, and then on to Milford Haven. He erected various oratories near the rivers Cleddau, Gwaun, and Caman and at the foot of Mynydd Carningli (translated as 'Mountain of the Angels'), which was his most famous foundation. This monastery founded by Brynach was at present-day Nevern (in Welsh, Nanhyfer). The land was given to him by the local lord, Clether, who retired to Cornwall. Brynach was harassed by King Maelgwn of Gwynedd for a while, until he wrought miracles and the two came to terms. Saint Brynach died on 7 April, on which day his feast is celebrated. His church, beside the River Nevern, is his lasting memorial. The \\"Life of St Brynach\\" portrays him as something of a wild fellow in his youth but very virtuous after his conversion. The descriptions of his adventures (including amorous and ghostly encounters) display a degree of humour unusual in the writers of saintly lives. Problems of identification Brynach may be a form of the Irish name, Bernach. This possibly etymology has led to speculation that Saint Brynach came from Ireland: Iolo Morganwg, followed by Baring-Gould, supposed that he is the same as the chieftain 'Fernach' who came to Wales from Ireland with the young Brychan of Brycheiniog. However, Egerton Phillimore rejects this identification A 'Brennach Wyddel o'r Gogledd' or Brennach the Irishman of the North [of Britain] appears in the Welsh Triads: Rachel Bromwich does not believe Saint Brynach is meant. Dedications Dedications of churches to Brynach in Pembrokeshire include Nevern, Dinas Cross, Llanfyrnach, Henry's Moat and Pontfaen. In Carmarthenshire there are Llanboidy and a chapel in Llanddarog, and there are scattered dedications in Glamorgan, Brecknockshire and Monmouthshire. The distribution of these is similar to that of Ogham stones in south Wales, and defines a distinct Irish-influenced province that existed in the Age of the Saints in the History of Wales.Bowen, E.

They were separated in August 2006. They were the first set of conjoined twins to be separated to share a kidney. Kendra retained their shared kidney following the separation surgery, while Maliyah Herrin underwent dialysis until she was transplanted with a kidney donated by her mother in April 2007. Prior to the separation surgery, medical ethicists in the United States and in Europe discussed whether it was ethical to separate the twins because of the additional risk to Maliyah. Their family and doctors believed separation surgery would give both girls their best chance to live a normal life. Early life The twins were born at the University of Utah Medical Center in Salt Lake City, Utah, to Erin and Jake Herrin. They began their lives as conjoined twins of a form termed Ischiopagus (Type D) / Omphalopagus (Type B) conjoined twins, meaning that they were joined at the abdomen and the pelvis; they had between them an abdomen, pelvis, liver, kidney, large intestine and two legs (each twin controlling one leg). Although separation of most conjoined twins is more likely to be successful at a much earlier age, transplantation of a kidney is not generally possible in children younger than age four. Doctors debated whether they should be separated because of the risk to Maliyah, but their parents and doctors ultimately decided to go forward with the surgery, feeling it gave them their best chance at a normal life. They have been the subject of numerous news articles and have made appearances on television talk shows, including The Oprah Winfrey Show. Separation The Herrin twins were approximately four and a half years old when they were separated in an operation that began at 7 a.m. on Monday, August 7, 2006, lasted nearly 18 hours, and involved six surgeons. Surgery on the girls then continued in two separate operations lasting up to eight more hours into the morning of August 8. The twins went home from the hospital to their family on September 17, 2006. Kidney transplant Kendra retained the single kidney which the twins had shared. Maliyah immediately began hemodialysis, which continued until April 3, 2007, when she was transplanted with a kidney donated by her 26-year-old mother, Erin. Maliyah was reported to be doing well following the transplant, as was her mother. In 2015, Maliyah's body started to reject the kidney. A few months later, despite intense treatment to slow down the process, it was definite that her kidney wouldn't be able to function for much longer. Maliyah received another kidney transplant in May 2018, which has so far been successful.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryKuPls9Gks Progress Following their separation surgery, both girls began learning to walk using crutches. Their parents have discussed having them eventually fitted with prosthetic legs. They also get around using wheelchairs or by crawling and pulling themselves up on furniture, according to the family's website. Jake and Erin Herrin's other children include fraternal twin sons and another daughter. Book The twins' mother wrote a book in 2009 titled \\"When Hearts Conjoin\\".

It has an old iron mining tradition, which can be followed back to the last centuries before Christ, the last mine was closed down in 1979.  Geography and geology  Riddarhyttan is, along with Skinnskatteberg, one of only two urban areas or localities (more than 200 inhabitants) in the Skinnskatteberg Municipality in the western part of Västmanland County, on the border to Örebro County. It is located in the north of the historical province of Västmanland. The area of the locality, as defined by Statistics Sweden, is 1.56 km2. The Swedish national road 68 is running through Riddarhyttan and the lake Lien is located next to it. It lies in the middle of the historically mining district Bergslagen. It is about 30 km to Fagersta, 35 km to Lindesberg and 70 km to Västerås. When the last ice age in Bergslagen came to an end about 9,500 years ago, Riddarhyttan was located on the border between land and sea. That resulted in kettles, glacial erratics and other specific landforms. When the ice was melting, iron was released from the bedrock into the groundwater and became exposed iron oxide (ochre). That gave rise to a red-colour soil in some parts of Riddarhyttan, especially in the area called Röda Jorden (red earth).  History  People started to extract iron from the red earth in the Riddarhyttan area sometime between 700 BC and 400 BC, which makes it the oldest area with ironworks in the Bergslagen region. Remains of several primitive blast furnaces have been found and the age have been established by carbon dating. The iron-making was carried on until about the birth of Christ. The locality Riddarhyttan dates back to the Middle Ages. Hälsingegruvan and Munkhyttan was mentioned as early as 1420. It was the State that first commenced mining in the area but private persons, or Bergsmän, were granted to use the mines later on. In 1611, Thomas Hammarsmed was granted the right to erect a forge and an iron blast- furnace.Iron and steel in Sweden, pp. 65–66 References ;Citations ;Sources *  External links  * riddarhyttan.nu * Images of Källfallet, Bäckegruvan and Bastnäs by Jakob Ehrensvärd Populated places in Västmanland County Populated places in Skinnskatteberg Municipality ","title":"Riddarhyttan"},{"id":"6298859","text":"The sherwood dogfish (Scymnodalatias sherwoodi) is a very rare sleeper shark of the family Somniosidae, found only around New Zealand.

The 126th was originally an infantry regiment, then was converted into an armoured role, and then was converted to a light cavalry reconnaissance unit, with subordinate units stationed in Cadillac, Wyoming, Dowagiac, and Manistee. It was converted back to an infantry unit in 2016.  Early history  The 126th Infantry existed for its first 144 years as an infantry unit. The 126th Infantry dates back as early as 12 July 1855 when the Grand Rapids Light Guard and Grand Rapids Artillery companies were organized. The first officers of the Grand Rapids Light Guard included Wright L. Coffinberry as captain; Frederick W. Worden, E.T. Nelson, and A.L. Gage as lieutenants; Milton S. Littlefield, Benjamin B. Church, S.S. Porter, and G.M. McCray as sergeants. Other charter members of the Light Guard included Edward A. Earle, Joseph C. Herkner, Benjamin Luce, Henry Spring, Miles Adams, E. H. Hunt, Dr. Willard Bliss, Frank Earle, Warren P. Mills, James Sargeant, J.E. Earle, John Grady, C.B. Hinsdill, Charles D. Lyon, George E. Judd, Henry Whipple, Robert M. Collins, F. Shriver, Byron R. Pierce, B. D. Ball, Edwin S. Pierce, John Seymour, Samuel Judd, Thomas Sargeant, G. W. Remington, William Livingston, Henry Ely, and Joseph Houseman. Later that year Ringgold’s Light Artillery was organized, and four years later in 1859, the Grand Rapids Rifles came into existence. These companies along with several others from Ionia formed the 51st Volunteer Uniformed Michigan Militia Regiment prior to the American Civil War.  American Civil War  The four companies formed the core of the 3rd Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment that joined the Civil War on 13 June 1861. The regimental commander at the time was Colonel Daniel McConnell. The Third Michigan fought in twelve campaigns before it was mustered out in June 1864. Besides five Grand Rapids companies, the Third included companies from Boston and Lyons in Ionia County, Lansing, Muskegon, and Georgetown. On 13 June 1861 the Third Regiment marched out of Cantonment Anderson in Grand Rapids, Michigan towards the recently constructed railroad depot near Leonard and Plainfield streets, where it boarded and departed the area for the war. While attached to Richardson’s brigade of Colonel Miles’s Division, the Third participated in its first engagement against Confederate forces just thirty-eight days after being federalized. It began as a part of a reconnaissance in force towards Blackburn’s Ford along Bull Run (the term \\"run\\" is southern for creek or small river). On 21 July, the Third marched with Richardson’s brigade back to Blackburn’s ford to keep the rebels occupied while the rest of McDowell’s army hit the Confederate’s left flank. After desultory firing at the ford, Richardson learned of the Federal rout on the right and was recalled to Centreville. What they saw was utter chaos and confusion as the Confederate forces, now reinforced, literally cut through the advancing and then retreating Union forces. Morale by the close of that first summer was presumably low in the Third Michigan. During the next few months a number of officers including Colonel McConnell resigned and returned home to Grand Rapids. Major Champlin, who had originally organized Ringgold's Light Artillery back in 1855, assumed command of the regiment on 28 October 1861, and under him, the Third went into winter quarters at Alexandria, Virginia. That next March, the Third Michigan was assigned to General Berry’s Brigade of the Third Red Diamond Division and entered the Peninsula campaign. A few months later at Fair Oaks, the regiment’s losses were severe—thirty killed, one hundred and twenty-four wounded, and fifteen missing. Included among the dead was Captain Samuel Judd, and Colonel Champlin had been severely wounded. Several months following Lee's surrender in April 1865, a great homecoming by the citizens of Grand Rapids was held for the returning heroes. On 4 July 1865, tables were set the entire length of the Pearl Street Bridge for a welcome-home celebration.  Medal of Honor recipients  Two soldiers in the Third earned the Medal of Honor. * Private Benjamin Morse, Company C, Third Michigan InfantryMedal of Honor Recipients Civil War (M-Z) * Corporal Walter Mundell, Company E, Fifth Michigan Infantry (This was an old Third Michigan company that transferred in its entirety to the Fifth at the end of the Third’s three-year enlistment period.)  After the Civil War  In the months and years that followed, veterans' groups were formed under the banner of the Grand Army of the Republic; however, the Old Third Michigan didn't organize an association until 23 February 1871. When they did, they elected Colonel Edwin S. Pierce, president; John H. Sumner, secretary; and Colonel George E. Judd, treasurer. In Grand Rapids, the earliest of the new, independent companies was the Valley City Zouaves, organized first in 1866 and reorganized on 14 March 1873. However, this company did not remain in existence for long and was never actually mustered into state service. Several years after the end of the Civil War, the Grand Rapids Guard company was organized by veterans of the Third and other regiments. The company was mustered into state service in 1872 as part of the Michigan State Troops. It was called out to aid authorities during a riot at the Muskegon County jail in 1873 and to quell a disturbance at Greenville during the Flat River labor dispute in 1874. That year the Grand Rapids Guard became Company B 2nd Infantry Regiment when the regiment was organized at Grand Rapids. Over the course of the next 24 years through various reorganizations the 2nd Infantry included companies from Coldwater, Kalamazoo, Flint, Bay City, East Saginaw, Port Huron, Marquette, Niles, Ionia, Manistee, Big Rapids, Three Rivers, and Grand Haven. The Michigan State Troops were redesignated as the Michigan National Guard on 31 December 1894, in response to a growing use of that designation across the country. It was first applied to the New York state militia in 1824 as a compliment to General Lafayette, who had been visiting the United States at that time. Lafayette had commanded the Garde Nationale in Paris around 1789.  War with Spain  In 1898, the 2nd Infantry was mobilized for the war with Spain as one of five Michigan regiments. It was redesignated the 32nd Volunteer Infantry Regiment and included twelve battalions: four from Grand Rapids, four from Detroit, and one each from Coldwater, Grand Haven, Kalamazoo and Battle Creek. The 32nd rendezvoused at Island Lake and was sent to Tampa, Florida with Colonel William T. McGurrin in command. It was just about to embark for Cuba when hostilities ceased and the 32nd returned home. Back at home, the regiment resumed its 2nd Infantry designation and moved into a new armory. This was the first time since 1855 that all four Grand Rapids companies were located in one armory. The remaining companies were located at Coldwater, Kalamazoo, Big Rapids, Lansing, Manistee, Muskegon and Battle Creek. Owing to poor showings in annual inspections, the Manistee company was dropped for Grand Haven and a new company was organized at Manistee. The Battle Creek company also was disbanded and Adrian joined the regiment. The Lansing company was eventually redesignated as artillery, and an Ionia company joined the 2nd. The Clark Building armory in Grand Rapids was thought in its day to be one of the finest armories in the state. Its furnishings and equipment had a value estimated at $11,000. The drill hall was rather large, and the armory included ample equipment rooms, assembly rooms, billiard rooms, reading rooms, officers' rooms, an indoor target range eighty feet in length, a cafe, club rooms, elegantly furnished parlors, and a library. In 1903, Congress passed the Militia Act of 1903, which had a huge impact on the Second Michigan and all other militia units in the United States. The bill and its amendments in effect served to nationalize the militia and reduce its status as a state volunteer force. Under terms of the act, the organized militia was uniformly redesignated as the National Guard and organized along army lines, with provisions for federal weapons and equipment. Twenty-four training sessions per year plus a summer encampment were now required for all units. Federal instruction and inspection were authorized and provisions made which elevated the status of Guard officers to equality with their federal counterparts. On 3 September 1912, in response to a request from officials at the state prison in Jackson, the governor directed that Companies C and M, Second Infantry from Kalamazoo, join companies of the First Infantry in aiding civil authorities in quelling the riot and protecting the institution from outside attack or interference with the discipline of the convicts. Within two hours of receiving the order, both companies were ready to leave the armory. The entire regiment saw service in the 1913 copper strike in the Upper Peninsula, serving in copper country from 24 July to the first of November. During the regiment’s stay, there was no loss of life and negligible property damage for any of citizen.  Mexican Border War  On 19 June 1916, the entire Michigan National Guard was called out for service on the Mexican border instigated by raids on American border towns by the Mexican Pancho Villa. The Thirty-second was mustered into federal service on the first of July. The organization of the 2nd included four companies from Grand Rapids, two from Kalamazoo, and one each from Coldwater, Adrian, Ionia, Grand Haven, Muskegon and Big Rapids. This war also became known as the Pancho Villa Expedition. Shortly thereafter, the regiment departed for El Paso, Texas, arriving at Camp Cotton on 12 July, located a mere three hundred yards from the Mexican border. Upon its arrival, regular army inspectors took note of the excellent condition of the regiment and the short amount of time it took to get settled into camp. The next four weeks were spent in intensive training. During this time, details were organized to guard important points in the vicinity of El Paso. On 15 August, the regiment took over the entire outpost along the Rio Grande and the boundary line in New Mexico. This consisted of a line stretching from Fort Hancock, southeast of El Paso, to Las Cruces, New Mexico, for a total of in length. While the Grand Rapids battalion was on the border, construction work on the new Michigan Street armory was completed. On Saturday, 13 January 1917, the final inspection of the regiment had been conducted. The regiment struck camp on Thursday and returned to Fort Wayne, where it was mustered out of service on 15 February. Under federal laws Congress adopted in June 1916 the regiment reverted to its National Guard status.  World War One  The 32nd returned home that spring only to find itself being activated for the World War. In September, it was ordered to Camp MacArthur, Texas, where it underwent another major reorganization to become part of the 32nd Division, which included Michigan and Wisconsin troops. Under the command of Colonel Joseph Westnedge, the 32nd became the 126th Infantry Regiment. The new regiment included the following companies: A-Coldwater, B-Adrian, C-Kalamazoo, D-Ionia, E-Ann Arbor, F-Jackson, G-Detroit, H-Detroit, I-Big Rapids/Muskegon, K-Grand Rapids, L-Grand Haven/Muskegon, and M-Grand Rapids. In addition, the regimental headquarters, machine gun company, supply company, sanitary detachment and band were all from Grand Rapids. The regiment left the United States on 19 February 1918 bound for France. When it first arrived it was used for replacements and supply duty. Soon, the regiment, along with the 32nd Division, was sent into battle. When the war was over on 11 November, the 126th had seen service in four major campaigns and earned the French Croix de Guerre. The 126th returned in May 1919 but without its dearly beloved Colonel Westnedge who had died that previous fall from the effects of mustard gas. PFC Joseph William Guyton, the first American killed on German-held territory in WWI, was posthumously awarded the French Croix de guerre. Following the war, Colonel Earl R. Stewart reorganized the 126th with units coming from many of the same towns as those of the pre-war 32nd. The only actions the unit participated in between the World Wars were the 1936 Second Army maneuvers across Allegan County and the 1937 Flint Sit-Down Strike.  World War Two  On 15 October 1940, before the United States involvement in the Second World War, the 126th headed to Louisiana along with the rest of the Red Arrow Division. The makeup of the 126th included the following units: Headquarters, Headquarters Company & Anti-Tank Platoon, Service Company, Band-Grand Rapids; 1st Battalion Headquarters Detachment-Adrian, Co A-Coldwater, Co B-Adrian, Co C-Kalamazoo, Co D-Holland; 2nd Battalion Headquarters Detachment-Muskegon, Co E-Big Rapids, Co F-Grand Haven, Co G-Muskegon, Co H-Ionia; 3rd Battalion Headquarters Detachment, Co I, Co K, Co L, Co M-all Grand Rapids. During the summer of 1941, the regiment participated in the Third and Fourth Army maneuvers—nicknamed the Louisiana Maneuvers—which provided the army high command a good look at the preparedness of the regiment. The first test, which was held in the vicinity of Camp Beauregard, was conducted from 16 June through the 27 and included the Thirty-second Division as well as the Thirty- seventh from Ohio. From 16–30 August, the maneuvers expanded to include the Thirty-fourth and Thirty-eighth divisions. During September, the largest maneuvers were held with the Seventh Corps of the Second Army, opposing the Fourth, Fifth, and Eighth corps of the Third Army. The Grand Rapids Guard was part of the Fifth Corps. It was the largest maneuver of its kind in the history of the army and included some one hundred thousand men.  Redirected to Pacific  Initially trained for the war in Europe, they were turned around in late March and told to be in San Francisco in three weeks. On 18 April 1942, the 32nd Division boarded a convoy of seven Matson Line ships, and the 126th boarded the S.S. Lurline, a luxury liner converted to transport duty, and four days later sailed for the South Pacific. The regiment crossed the equator on 30 April, and the international date line on 7 May, reaching Adelaide, Australia, seven days later. There, the 126th unloaded and moved to Camp Sandy Creek some outside the city. In August 1942, the 126th moved to Brisbane and was billeted at Camp Cable. The camp was named in honor of Corporal Gerald Cable, the first member of the 32nd Division killed by the Japanese during World War II. Cable, a member of Service Company, 126th Infantry, along with approximately twenty other men, were on board a ship transporting trucks and other equipment from Brisbane to Adelaide when a torpedo hit the ship in the stern.  Move to New Guinea  The 126th was organized into a regimental combat team composed of the entire 126th Infantry Regiment; Company A, 107th Medical Battalion; Company A, 114th Engineer Battalion; 1st Platoon, Company D, 107th Medical Detachment; Section C, 10th Evacuation Hospital; 107th Quartermaster Company; and a number of other support forces. Colonel Lawrence A. Quinn was in command of the combat team. First, Second, and Third battalions were under the command of Lt. Col. Edmund Carrier, Lt. Col. Henry Geerds, and Lt. Col. Clarence Tomlinson, respectively. The regiment was the first U.S. force to be dispatched to Port Moresby in New Guinea in September 1942. Once in Port Moresby the Regiment was put to work constructing the American base camp, once again missing out on valuable training.  Trek across Owen Stanley Range  Allied advance across Owen Stanley Range 26 September – 15 November 1942 In October 1942 the 2nd Battalion, assisted by several hundred natives carriers, was sent across the Owen Stanley Ranges via the Kapa Kapa Trail toward Jaure, where they were to flank the Japanese retreating towards the coast on the Kokoda Trail. The total distance over the mountains to the Japanese positions was over , and most of the trail was rarely used. They were completely unprepared; the Battalion suffered greatly from exposure to the elements in the mountains. The troops also suffered from malaria, dengue fever, bush typhus, trenchfoot, and tropical dysentery. The men carried only six days rations, expecting to be resupplied en route. Some of their rations included including hardtack, rice, and Australian bully beef which had become rancid. Many men got food poisoning. They had leather toilet seats but no machetes, insect repellent, waterproof containers for medicine or personal effects, and it rained heavily every day. It was \\"one of the most harrowing marches in American military history.\\" The Battalion took 42 days to cross the mountains and reach the coast. They never saw a Japanese soldier during their trek, and the battalion reached the north coast after the Australians who had fought the Japanese down the Kokoda Trail. During their march, the remainder of the Regiment was flown across the Owen Stanley Range, arriving before the 2/126th. The battalion earned the nickname \\"The Ghost Battalion\\" during the march, referring not only to the ghost-like conditions encountered when they passed -high Mount Obree, which they nicknamed Ghost Mountain, but to their condition upon arrival.  Battle of Buna-Gona  Lt. Gen. Robert Eichelberger found that when the soldiers of 2/126th arrived at the front they were not ready for combat. Nonetheless, after a week's rest, the men were ordered to the front where they were key players in the extremely difficult Battle of Buna-Gona. The unit was decimated by the battle. The 126th Infantry was the hardest-hit of the three regiments of the 32nd Infantry Division . It had 131 officers and 3,040 enlisted men when it entered combat against the Japanese in mid-November. At the conclusion of the battle on 22 January, the unit had been decimated by disease as well as battle. Only 32 officers and 579 enlisted men were left, less than a full battalion.  Other campaigns  After taking part in the Western New Guinea campaign, the unit later fought in Leyte and Luzon. The 32nd Division logged a total of 654 days of combat during World War II, more than any other United States Army division. The unit was inactivated in 1946 after occupation duty in Japan.  Recognition  Three soldiers in the 126th earned the Medal of Honor: * PFC William A. McWhorter. * SGT Leroy Johnson.Medal of Honor Recipients – World War II (G-L) * PFC Dirk J. Vlug.Medal of Honor Recipients – World War II (T-Z)  Cold War  Following the War, the 126th returned to its home stations, but over the course of the next 45 years it underwent many transformations and reorganizations. It lost its attachment to towns such as Adrian, Coldwater, Muskegon, Ionia, and Kalamazoo. For a time, Greenville, Alma and South Haven were elements of the 126th. In March 1953, Wisconsin Highway 32, as well as a portion of former U.S. Route 12 in Michigan, was named in honor of the 32nd Infantry Division, and all Highway 32 shields carry the Red Arrow insignia. A memorial plaque describing the division is located at southern end of WI-32 on Sheridan Road in Kenosha County, Wisconsin. Ceremonies were held along the route and included veterans of the Grand Rapids Guard, which had been part of the Thirty-second Division during both world wars. Although US-12 was later moved when Interstate 94 was built, portions of the Red Arrow Highway still exist between Kalamazoo and New Buffalo A devastating tornado struck the Hudsonville, Standale, Comstock Park, and northern Grand Rapids areas on 3 April 1956. More than eight hundred members of the regiment were called to state duty to protect lives and property. On 15 March 1959, the regiment reorganized into two Battle Groups, the First and Second Battle Groups 126th Infantry, with both organizations' headquarters located at Grand Rapids. This dramatic reorganization in the U.S. Army was in effect the termination of the regimental system, an old tradition in military forces worldwide. This new \\"pentomic\\" system created five such battle groups in the Forty-sixth Division. The 126th Infantry, heroic in two world wars, ceased to exist less than forty- two years after its organization. Recognizing the problems of the \\"pentomic\\" divisional alignment in a nuclear era, the U.S. Army reorganized under the new ROAD (Reorganization Objectives Army Division) concept on 15 March 1963. Both First and Second Battle Groups were carved up to reform First, Second, and Third battalions 126th Infantry along with the new Headquarters and Headquarters Company, Second Brigade, Forty-sixth Infantry Division headquartered in Grand Rapids. On Palm Sunday, 11 April 1965, a series of tornadoes struck the southern part of the Lower Peninsula. The deadly twisters first struck north of Grand Rapids in the Alpine township area. Companies A and C, Third Battalion, 126th Infantry were called into action almost immediately and joined the Kent County Civil Defense Force, as well as other state, county, and city law enforcement agencies. The two companies managed to secure the affected area, prevent looting, and assisted with other disaster response duties. The new Grand Valley Armory in Wyoming, Michigan was dedicated on 31 May 1965, providing a permanent home to the Second Brigade Headquarters, along with First and Third battalions 126th Infantry, and the Forty-sixth Infantry Division Band. On 15 November 1965, the most radical reorganization in the history of the National Guard took place on orders of Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara creating a Selected Reserve Force (SRF or \\"super-ready force\\"). The Second Brigade, Forty-sixth Infantry Division, under command of Colonel Robert T. Williams, was designated the headquarters for SRF units in Michigan, with the Third Battalion 126th Infantry designated as West Michigan’s SRF battalion. All Michigan elements of the SRF were additionally assigned to the Thirty-eighth Infantry Division of Indiana, an SRF division in the event of mobilization.  Maintaining civil order and reorganization  The Third Battalion 126th Infantry was ordered to state active duty on 31 August 1966, following four nights of racial violence at Benton Harbor, Michigan. A total force of four hundred officers and men were assembled. The force was reduced the next day to a total of 175, and training was undertaken to prepare for any deployment into the problem area. On Labor Day, the fifth of September, the battalion was stood down as the situation came under control without the use of troops. On 23 July 1967, the Grand Rapids Guard was called to active state duty once again, this time in response to rioting in the city of Detroit where arsonists and sniper fire had caused extensive damage from fires, resulting in deaths to both rioters and civilian authorities. With the loss of the 46th Infantry Division in 1968, the 126th was scaled down to a single Infantry battalion, and the 1st and 2nd battalions' colors were retired. The reorganization redesignated the Second Brigade as the Forty-sixth Brigade assigned to the Thirty-eighth Infantry \\"Cyclone\\" Division, headquartered in Indianapolis. Some elements of the First and Third battalions were reorganized as divisional support elements such as Co. D 113th Engineer Battalion, Co. D (FS) 738th Maintenance Battalion, Second Platoon Thirty- eighth MP Company, Second Truck Platoon Co. B Thirty-eighth Supply and Transportation Battalion, and Brigade Admin Section Thirty-eighth Admin Co. On 4 April 1968, Martin Luther King Jr., a leader of the Civil Rights Movement, was assassinated. The Michigan National Guard was ordered to state active duty the next day, to prevent possible outbreaks of violence similar to the previous summer (such as those in Detroit, Newark, Tampa, Buffalo, Plainfield). Headquarters Forty-sixth Brigade and Third Battalion, 126th Infantry proceeded to Detroit and established round-the-clock patrols to prevent any incidents. The brigade’s separate units remained at the Grand Valley Armory and were reinforced by units from Muskegon and Greenville in the event of outbreaks in other western state cities. These units were released two days later. The Forty-sixth Brigade and Third Battalion moved to Belle Isle for two days before being released from state duty on the tenth of April and returning to their home stations. On 13 October 1990, fifty years after being mobilized for World War II, the 126th Infantry Regiment, including veterans of many of the \\"old 126th\\" and \\"Red Arrow\\" units, paraded through the city of Grand Rapids and were honored by many state and local dignitaries. The occasion marked the anniversary of the mobilization of National Guard troops prior to World War II, and the grand old 126th Infantry’s 135th birthday. On 3 June 1991, the city of Wyoming, under Mayor Harold Voorhees, passed a resolution designating Forty-fourth Street as 126th Infantry Memorial Boulevard. Street signs that included the regimental crest were placed along the Wyoming portion of the street. On 20 August 1992, the Michigan Historical Commission placed the 126th Infantry on the State Register of Historic Sites. A marker was commissioned and dedicated in front of the Grand Valley Armory on 11 November 1992, prior to the start of the traditional Grand Rapids Veterans Day parade. The Grand Rapids Guard, Incorporated, underwrote the $2,200 expense. During the summer of 1996, The 126th Infantry was mobilized to provide security for the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. In the spring of 1991, the 126th Infantry learned it might be inactivated along with the rest of the Forty-sixth Infantry Brigade as part of a post–cold war reorganization plan by the Pentagon. A minor reorganization followed and resulted in bringing Alma back into the battalion as Company A Third Battalion 126th Infantry. Units at Grand Haven and Holland consolidated and were redesignated as Det. 1 Co. B and Company B (-). In the late 1990s, the units at Grand Haven and Holland were disbanded. In 1999, the 3rd Battalion 126th Infantry ended 144 years of Infantry tradition when it was reorganized and redesignated as the 1st Battalion, 126th Armor.  War on Terror  Following the attack on the United States on 11 September 2001, elements of the 126th Armor were mobilized stateside under Operation Noble Eagle for Airbase Security Enforcement at both TACOM and Selfridge Air National Guard Base. Later, other members were deployed to Texas and California with the mission of loading and unloading ships in support of the War On Terror. In 2004, a small contingent was sent to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom with the task of training Afghan soldiers. On 4 January 2005, a company-sized element of the battalion was mobilized at Fort Dix, New Jersey for (Security Forces) training, and then later deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. This particular unit was stationed in the Green Zone in central Baghdad with the primary mission of providing security for Iraq's top-tier one government personnel, while also having a minor role in conducting route security missions in Western Baghdad. The company returned home to Grand Rapids, Michigan on 26 February 2006. On 12 August 2005, a permanent memorial to the 126th was dedicated at Camp Grayling, Michigan. In October 2006 the 1–126 Armor transitioned to the 1–126 Cavalry, consisting of scout, infantry, and headquarters troops. In April 2007 the unit was alerted for service in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The unit was mobilized to Fort Hood, Texas in January 2008 and deployed to Kuwait and Iraq in April 2008. During their deployment they have served as a Security Force (SECFOR) unit, providing convoy security to distribution operations in Kuwait and Iraq. They returned to Michigan on 12 December 2008. In early January 2012 they deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and returned home in late 2012. On 20 May 2012, two vehicles from C-Troop 1–126 hit Improvised Explosive Devices (IED's) while conducting combat and security patrols in the Shah Wali Kot district of Afghanistan. 10 members of the unit received Purple Hearts for their injuries. The unit received the Valorous Unit Award as an attached unit to the 2nd Battalion, 17th Field Artillery Regiment via permanent order 274-04 on 2 October 2013. In March 2016, the unit began transitioning back to infantry. In January 2017, it joined the 32nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, as the Army added a third maneuver battalion to its brigade combat teams.

This 27-volume series was serialized in LaLa from 1994 to 2005. The story is based on the Japanese legend of Kaguyahime (The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter). In 2002, the series received the 47th annual Shogakukan Manga Award for shōjo. A Drama CD was released in 2003. Story Based on The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter, this manga takes place around the mysterious Kabuchi Island where children were raised in an orphanage as sacrificial victims. Some of the children manage to leave the island and think they have escaped their fates. But then they all start to die at age sixteen, in the order and at the time they were originally arranged to be sacrificed. The only way to stop the deaths is to return to the island, seek out the cause - Kaguya Hime - and destroy it. The children later realize that they are clones of famous or influential humans, a fact which further complicates their quest to figure out their mysterious past and save their futures. Terminology ;Sacrifice :A child orphan raised on Kabuchi Island for the purpose of becoming the victim of the Kaguya-hime \\"festival\\". ;Donor :A human who was cloned for the purpose of offering organs or spare parts to a VIP of financial or political power (the \\"recipient\\"). Clones can be created for insurance purposes (Akira, Midori, Sutton, Satoshi, Katsura, Kaede, Mamoru) and for crucial organ parts (Miller) in transplant surgeries. The process involves splitting the fertilized egg while still in the womb and freezing one half to be transported to the second Earth. ;Camp U.G. (Underground) :A U.S. Armed Forces military camp whose target recruits were young men. A large cash prize and citizenship under any country was promised to four participants who successfully completed the mission. This incentive was necessary because the military takes no legal responsibilities for participants, and every year there are deaths. The camp's location changes every year; in this case it was held at Kabuchi Island. ;Kabuchi Island (Kabuchijima) :An island on the Amami archipelago where Akira and the orphans grew up. Its creatures and plants seem to be endemic. The island's history and cultural practices remain shrouded in mystery. ;Moon Stone :A moon rock brought to Earth through the Apollo mission program. Its appearance differs from other moon rocks, and was believed to have been \\"created\\" over seven billion years ago. Its pieces were distributed to six different countries (Japan, China, America, Britain, Russia, and Thailand), and the existence of these stones is not known to the public. It is the \\"hagoromo\\" (Feather mantle that enables Kaguya Hime to fly and return to the moon) of the moon. ;Moon Stone Mold :Mold that is spread through contact with the moon stone. When a human is infected and not immediately quarantined the disease can become an airborne pathogen. A cure is being researched but it is currently fatal to all who catch it. The sacrifices are immune to the mold due to the environment in which they were raised and their genetic makeup. ;Li Plutocracy :The main branch of the Li clan. They possess so much wealth and influence that they are referred to as an empire. They are known for their harsh rules of succession under which the empress is bound. A female successor must live within the palace walls until they are an adult. At the age of 18 there is a ceremony in which her suitors are revealed. The characteristic style of marriage is the successor chooses one of her five suitors every night as her companion, and when a child is conceived marriage arrangements are made. ;Original Body :The VIP of financial or political power that are the \\"recipient\\" of all the donors. Characters ; :The main protagonist, Akira is a woman of androgynous beauty. She is dignified and strong-willed. While attending high school she was more popular with the girls than boys and was often mistaken for a man (for example: she won a magazine's bishōnen contest that her classmates entered her in as a joke). As time passes, she flourishes into a young lady. When she was a baby, she was found in a bamboo thicket and taken in by the Kashiwagi family, but the couple divorced when she was three and Akira was abandoned to Kabuchi Island. At the age of five she was adopted by Shoko Okada, an artist who received child support to raise her. By junior high school Akira was forced into a homosexual relationship with her stepmother. To escape the situation with her adopted family, she decides to participate in Camp U.G. She is kidnapped from the camp and forced to assume her role as the donor of a Chinese empress, . She was in love with Yui. But in the end, Yui died and she became Miller's wife and had a son with him. Years later when she was at death's door Yui came for her and took her back to the moon, meaning that she was a tennyo from the beginning. ; :Possesses superhuman abilities, such as superior eyesight and strength. He, Midori, and Akira were particularly good friends during their childhood. Since their escape from Kabuchi island he has been known to suppress his emotions and is weak in communicating with others. He is gentle but lonely, and gets anxious when separated from Midori. He returns to the island through Camp U.G. with them to break the island's curse and protect his two friends from harm. He is revealed to be the son of the legendary Kaguya-hime and a human, which makes him a tennin. In the end he died and was returned to the moon, while making a promise to Akira that he will return to take her back in the future. ; :Donor for the 9th generation foremost Prince of Thailand. The age difference between him and his \\"true body\\" is 10 years. He has a calm and kind personality and harbors strong feelings for Akira. He also deeply cares for Yui, but sees him as a romantic rival, often acting out coldly when he feels Yui is being extremely affectionate or overprotective. He is diagnosed with stomach cancer and is given the option of having an operation, but instead leaves for Camp U.G., despite his weak medical condition. After that his original body met with an incident so the original body's useful body parts were transplanted to Midori instead and Midori became the first prince of Thailand. In the end it was revealed that he is Yui's equivalent to the \\"hagoromo\\" of the moon and when Midori died Yui lost his powers as a tennin as well. Midori then became one with Yui spiritually. ; :Daughter of Shoko Okada and Akira's classmate. She is very possessive of Akira, and doesn't let anyone near her. She has a sweet appearance but will do anything to get her way (such as pretending to be sick and fainting on the spot to get attention). Romantically interested in Akira and obsessed with what she calls Akira's \\"cleanliness\\", Mayu killed her mother Shouko before going to UG Camp. Later on was separated from Akira when all of the donors were caught and killed for the transplants. After hard work and time she finally found Akira as Li Gyokurei, but realized that the Akira she knew had changed. She tried committing suicide a few times to get Akira's attention, and when it did not work she decided to commit suicide together with Akira. As Midori risked his life to save her and became brain dead, she realized her own foolishness and changed for the better. ; :Donor for NBA star player . He also wanted to become a basketball player like his \\"true body.\\" He has strong leadership skills and becomes leader of Camp U.G. during their stay (despite Kaede's rejection of the idea). After transplant his rage of being killed was so strong that his cells took over Don Bellamy's body. However in the end when the moon was separated from the Earth after the moon stone was returned to the moon, he disappeared from Don Bellamy's body and Don lost all his memories of the time when he was Sutton. ; :Donor for Julian, a blood relative of the British Royal Family. He was used for a kidney transplant at the age of 5. He is a famous Hollywood actor known for his gorgeous looks, but his personality is inconsiderate and rough. He gets upset when he is mistaken for a lady (which happens often) and a director was hospitalized after being assaulted by him in the past. Because of his failing eyesight he had to quit the acting business and cut all ties with his agents before leaving for Camp U.G. Julian, his original body, in order to repay him for the kidney transplant that allowed him to live to 20, set it up so that Miller received his eyes instead and lived as Julian. When Yui died, Miller proposed to Akira and told her that he did not mind if she still loves Yui.Later they had one child, and Akira confessed that along the way she fell in love with Miller. They lived together for many years. Then, when Akira was at death's door, Yui came and took her 'back' to the moon. It was hinted that when Akira died he became extremely sick and then died. ; :Donor of , son of a Korean Nobel Prize recipient. Younger twin of Katsura. Obstinate and childish, and seemingly aware of these personality flaws. Participated in Camp U.G. in hopes of winning the money to repay a failed business debt. When he was killed and his heart was transplanted to Kim Seok-Yong, he took over the body and left home in order to look for Katsura, and found Katsura with the help of Mamoru, though in a brain dead state. In order not to let Katsura suffer anymore, he made a painful decision and shut off Katsura's respiratory system, thus ending his misery. He hated the original body's father, but visited him when he was on death bed. Seemingly his father knew that the one who was living right now is Kaede instead of his son, he apologized and in the end Kaede forgave him. In the end he lost his memory of being Kaede when the moon left Earth. ; :Donor of , son of a Korean Nobel Prize recipient. Twin of Kaede. Steady in character and keeps Kaede out of trouble. When Kaede's heart was taken during the transplant, he tried to commit suicide and thus to prevent him from doing so his brain was taken out via operation and he was kept alive in a brain dead state. ; :Donor of , son of an American Congressman of Japanese descent. Was adopted by a loving Japanese family and did well in school, but killed a classmate just before leaving for Camp U.G. He is quick on comebacks and develops intelligent schemes to get what he wants. After transplant he lived as Hiroki, but had a son with Hiroki's lover. He coldly demanded that she abort the child and annulled their wedding to become one of Li Gyokurei's consort candidate. ; :Donor of , a high-ranking member of the Russian mafia. Mamoru is wanted by the law for cheating and stealing, and wishes to have a fresh start at life through Camp U.G. Because of his nearsightedness, he kept a distance from people and never took the time to properly take notice of them. When he was used to do a transplant, he lived on as Yuri Babanin. He was said to look very different from his donor as compared to the rest of the donors, but it was revealed that it was because he squinted his eyes due to his bad eyesight, which became a habit. But he lost his freckles as well as dyed his hair. In the end he lost his memory of being Mamoru, but seemingly he stopped being a member of the mafia as he decided that with the new Earth there was no need for one anymore.

Company history  Schreiber Foods Headquarters in downtown Green Bay, Wisconsin.Schreiber Foods was founded in 1945 when L.D. Schreiber, in partnership with Merlin G. Bush and Daniel D. Nusbaum, started the L.D. Schreiber Cheese Company with its original plant in Green Bay, Wisconsin. In 1950, Schreiber Foods opened a second cheese plant in Carthage, Missouri. Schreiber added two more plants in the 1970s in Logan, Utah, and Monett, Missouri. In 2000, Schreiber purchased the Beatrice Foods plant in Waukesha, Wisconsin. It closed that plant employing 170 in 2002. Schreiber purchased Pinnacle Cheese in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 2000. It closed the plant employing 100 in 2003. Schreiber purchased Raskas Foods in St. Louis, Missouri, in 2002. It closed the St Louis plant employing 220 in 2005, while maintaining plants in Texas and Pennsylvania. By the end of 2000, six more were added to include additional operations in Missouri, Arizona and Wisconsin. Since then, they've expanded to include domestic plants in Pennsylvania, Texas, California and Utah, in addition to international operations in Austria, Brazil, France, Germany, India, Mexico, Portugal, Spain, Bulgaria, Czech Republic and Slovakia. In 1962, Schreiber sold the cheese operation to 13 employees, including Bush and Nusbaum. As the company began to expand into products other than cheese, the L.D. Schreiber Company changed its name to Schreiber Foods Inc. in 1980.

It was demolished in the 1950s due to subsidence caused by Woolmet Colliery. Some carved stones from Woolmet were incorporated into the Castle of Mey around 1990. All that remains is an ornamental doorway of around 1700, crudely attaching the modern Miners Welfare Club. Woolmet Colliery The Colliery opened late in Scottish mining history (1898) and closed in 1966. It was operated by the Niddrie and Banhar Coal Company. It employed around 700 men and produced around 200,000 tons of coal per annum, under the control of Sir James Steel. Edmonstone House This mansion stood west of Woolmet House, north of Danderhall village. It was certainly extant in 1600 as home to the Edmonstone family. It was remodelled in the 18th century but demolished in the 1950s to avoid tax (the fate of many mansions in the 1950s). An entrance lodge and the base of the mansion still survive.

It is directed by Joe Chappelle, with as screenplay by Howard A. Rodman, John Danza, and David & Leslie Newman. The film stars Skeet Ulrich as Mitnick and Russell Wong as Shimomura, with Angela Featherstone, Donal Logue, Christopher McDonald, Master P, and Tom Berenger. Upon release, the film and its source material came under controversy due to inaccuracies and falsehoods alleged by Mitnick against Shimomura and the screenwriters. The film's producers faced a lawsuit from author Jonathan Littman, who alleged that portions of the film's screenplay were taken from his book The Fugitive Game: Online with Kevin Mitnick. As such, the film was not released in the United States until September 24, 2004, where it was released direct-to-video by Dimension Films. Summary For years Kevin Mitnick had eluded federal agents while using the latest electronic gadgetry to break into countless computers and gain access to sensitive and valuable information. But when he breaches the system of leading computer crimes expert Tsutomu Shimomura, it sets off an epic chase through cyberspace between a pair of hard-driven geniuses operating on different sides of the law.

The film depicts Mitnick hacking into Shimomura's computers and stealing/deleting his files and software. Though Mitnick admits hacking Shimomura's computers using IP spoofing, he claims he never caused any damage to anyone by deleting files or data, merely copying source code of some software, out of curiosity.

History Sometime before 1748 Euler made the first conjectures about the cubic residuacity of small integers, but they were not published until 1849, after his death.Euler, Tractatus ..., §§ 407-410 Gauss's published works mention cubic residues and reciprocity three times: there is one result pertaining to cubic residues in the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae (1801).Gauss, DA, footnote to art. 358 In the introduction to the fifth and sixth proofs of quadratic reciprocity (1818)Gauss, Theorematis fundamentalis ... he said that he was publishing these proofs because their techniques (Gauss's lemma and Gaussian sums, respectively) can be applied to cubic and biquadratic reciprocity. Finally, a footnote in the second (of two) monographs on biquadratic reciprocity (1832) states that cubic reciprocity is most easily described in the ring of Eisenstein integers.Gauss, BQ, § 30 From his diary and other unpublished sources, it appears that Gauss knew the rules for the cubic and quartic residuacity of integers by 1805, and discovered the full-blown theorems and proofs of cubic and biquadratic reciprocity around 1814.Cox, pp. 83-90Lemmermeyer, pp. 199-201, 222-224 Proofs of these were found in his posthumous papers, but it is not clear if they are his or Eisenstein's.Lemmermeyer, p. 200 Jacobi published several theorems about cubic residuacity in 1827, but no proofs.Jacobi, De residuis cubicis .... In his Königsberg lectures of 1836-37 Jacobi presented proofs. The first published proofs were by Eisenstein (1844).Eisenstein, Beweis des Reciprocitätssatzes ...Eisenstein, Nachtrag zum cubischen...Eisenstein, Application de l'algèbre... Integers A cubic residue (mod p) is any number congruent to the third power of an integer (mod p). If x3 ≡ a (mod p) does not have an integer solution, a is a cubic nonresidue (mod p).cf. Gauss, BQ § 2 As is often the case in number theory, it is easier to work modulo prime numbers, so in this section all moduli p, q, etc., are assumed to be positive, odd primes. We first note that if q ≡ 2 (mod 3) is a prime then every number is a cubic residue modulo q. Let q = 3n + 2; since 0 = 03 is obviously a cubic residue, assume x is not divisible by q. Then by Fermat's little theorem, :x^q \\\\equiv x \\\\bmod{q}, \\\\qquad x^{q - 1} \\\\equiv 1 \\\\bmod{q} Multiplying the two congruences we have : x^{2q-1} \\\\equiv x \\\\bmod{q} Now substituting 3n + 2 for q we have: : x^{2q-1} = x^{6n + 3} = \\\\left (x^{2n+1} \\\\right )^3. Therefore, the only interesting case is when the modulus p ≡ 1 (mod 3). In this case the non-zero residue classes (mod p) can be divided into three sets, each containing (p−1)/3 numbers. Let e be a cubic non-residue. The first set is the cubic residues; the second one is e times the numbers in the first set, and the third is e2 times the numbers in the first set. Another way to describe this division is to let e be a primitive root (mod p); then the first (resp. second, third) set is the numbers whose indices with respect to this root are congruent to 0 (resp. 1, 2) (mod 3). In the vocabulary of group theory, the first set is a subgroup of index 3 of the multiplicative group (\\\\Z/p\\\\Z)^{\\\\times} and the other two are its cosets. Primes ≡ 1 (mod 3) A theorem of FermatGauss, DA, Art. 182Cox, Ex. 1.4-1.5 states that every prime p ≡ 1 (mod 3) can be written as p = a2 \\\\+ 3b2 and (except for the signs of a and b) this representation is unique. Letting m = a + b and n = a − b, we see that this is equivalent to p = m2 − mn + n2 (which equals (n − m)2 − (n − m)n + n2 = m2 \\\\+ m(n − m) + (n − m)2, so m and n are not determined uniquely). Thus, :\\\\begin{align} 4p &= (2m-n)^2 + 3n^2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= (2n-m)^2 + 3m^2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= (m+n)^2 + 3(m-n)^2 \\\\end{align} and it is a straightforward exercise to show that exactly one of m, n, or m − n is a multiple of 3, so :p = \\\\frac14 (L^2+ 27M^2), and this representation is unique up to the signs of L and M.Ireland & Rosen, Props 8.3.1 & 8.3.2 For relatively prime integers m and n define the rational cubic residue symbol as :\\\\left[\\\\frac{m}{n}\\\\right]_3 = \\\\begin{cases} 1 & m \\\\text{ is a cubic residue } \\\\bmod n \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1 & m \\\\text{ is a cubic non-residue }\\\\bmod n \\\\end{cases} It is important to note that this symbol does not have the multiplicative properties of the Legendre symbol; for this, we need the true cubic character defined below. :Euler's Conjectures. Let p = a2 \\\\+ 3b2 be a prime.

Let p = 1 + 3x + 9x2 be a prime. Then any divisor of x is a cubic residue (mod p).Lemmermeyer, Ex. 7.12 Eisenstein integers=Background In his second monograph on biquadratic reciprocity, Gauss says: > The theorems on biquadratic residues gleam with the greatest simplicity and > genuine beauty only when the field of arithmetic is extended to imaginary > numbers, so that without restriction, the numbers of the form a + bi > constitute the object of study ... we call such numbers integral complex > numbers.Gauss, BQ, § 30, translation in Cox, p. 83 [bold in the original] These numbers are now called the ring of Gaussian integers, denoted by Z[i]. Note that i is a fourth root of 1. In a footnote he adds > The theory of cubic residues must be based in a similar way on a > consideration of numbers of the form a + bh where h is an imaginary root of > the equation h3 = 1 ... and similarly the theory of residues of higher > powers leads to the introduction of other imaginary quantities.Gauss, BQ, § > 30, translation in Cox, p. 84 In his first monograph on cubic reciprocityIreland & Rosen p. 14 Eisenstein developed the theory of the numbers built up from a cube root of unity; they are now called the ring of Eisenstein integers. Eisenstein said (paraphrasing) \\"to investigate the properties of this ring one need only consult Gauss's work on Z[i] and modify the proofs\\". This is not surprising since both rings are unique factorization domains. The \\"other imaginary quantities\\" needed for the \\"theory of residues of higher powers\\" are the rings of integers of the cyclotomic number fields; the Gaussian and Eisenstein integers are the simplest examples of these. Facts and terminology Let :\\\\omega = \\\\frac{-1 + i\\\\sqrt 3}{2} = e^\\\\frac{2\\\\pi i}{3}, \\\\qquad \\\\omega^3 = 1. And consider the ring of Eisenstein integers: :\\\\Z[\\\\omega] = \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ a + b \\\\omega \\\\ : \\\\ a, b \\\\in \\\\Z \\\\right \\\\\\\\}. This is a Euclidean domain with the norm function given by: :N(a + b \\\\omega) = a^2 -ab + b^2. Note that the norm is always congruent to 0 or 1 (mod 3). The group of units in \\\\Z[\\\\omega] (the elements with a multiplicative inverse or equivalently those with unit norm) is a cyclic group of the sixth roots of unity, :\\\\left \\\\\\\\{ \\\\pm 1, \\\\pm \\\\omega, \\\\pm \\\\omega^2\\\\right \\\\\\\\}. \\\\Z[\\\\omega] is a unique factorization domain. The primes fall into three classes:Ireland & Rosen Prop 9.1.4 * 3 is a special case: :: 3 = -\\\\omega^2 (1-\\\\omega)^2. :It is the only prime in \\\\Z divisible by the square of a prime in \\\\Z[\\\\omega]. The prime 3 is said to ramify in \\\\Z[\\\\omega]. * Positive primes in \\\\Z congruent to 2 (mod 3) are also primes in \\\\Z[\\\\omega]. These primes are said to remain inert in \\\\Z[\\\\omega]. Note that if q is any inert prime then: ::N(q) = q^2 \\\\equiv 1 \\\\bmod{3}. * Positive primes in \\\\Z congruent to 1 (mod 3) are the product of two conjugate primes in \\\\Z[\\\\omega]. These primes are said to split in \\\\Z[\\\\omega]. Their factorization is given by: ::p=N (\\\\pi) = N (\\\\overline{\\\\pi})= \\\\pi \\\\overline{\\\\pi}. :for example :: 7 = ( 3 + \\\\omega) ( 2 - \\\\omega). A number is primary if it is coprime to 3 and congruent to an ordinary integer modulo (1-\\\\omega)^2, which is the same as saying it is congruent to \\\\pm 2 modulo 3. If \\\\gcd(N(\\\\lambda), 3) = 1 one of \\\\lambda, \\\\omega \\\\lambda, or \\\\omega^2 \\\\lambda is primary. Moreover, the product of two primary numbers is primary and the conjugate of a primary number is also primary. The unique factorization theorem for \\\\Z[\\\\omega] is: if \\\\lambda eq 0, then :\\\\lambda = \\\\pm\\\\omega^\\\\mu(1-\\\\omega)^ u\\\\pi_1^{\\\\alpha_1}\\\\pi_2^{\\\\alpha_2}\\\\pi_3^{\\\\alpha_3} \\\\cdots, \\\\qquad \\\\mu \\\\in \\\\\\\\{0, 1, 2\\\\\\\\}, \\\\quad u, \\\\alpha_1, \\\\alpha_2, \\\\ldots \\\\geqslant 0 where each \\\\pi_i is a primary (under Eisenstein's definition) prime. And this representation is unique, up to the order of the factors. The notions of congruencecf. Gauss, BQ, §§ 38-45 and greatest common divisorcf. Gauss, BQ, §§ 46-47 are defined the same way in \\\\Z[\\\\omega] as they are for the ordinary integers \\\\Z. Because the units divide all numbers, a congruence modulo \\\\lambda is also true modulo any associate of \\\\lambda, and any associate of a GCD is also a GCD. Cubic residue characterDefinition= An analogue of Fermat's little theorem is true in \\\\Z[\\\\omega]: if \\\\alpha is not divisible by a prime \\\\pi,Ireland & Rosen. Prop. 9.3.1 :\\\\alpha^{N (\\\\pi) - 1} \\\\equiv 1 \\\\bmod{\\\\pi}. Now assume that N(\\\\pi) eq 3 so that N(\\\\pi) \\\\equiv 1 \\\\bmod{3}. Or put differently 3\\\\mid N(\\\\pi) -1. Then we can write: :\\\\alpha^{\\\\frac{N ( \\\\pi )- 1}{3}}\\\\equiv \\\\omega^k \\\\bmod\\\\pi, for a unique unit \\\\omega^k. This unit is called the cubic residue character of \\\\alpha modulo \\\\pi and is denoted byIreland & Rosen, p. 112 :\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\pi}\\\\right)_3 = \\\\omega^k \\\\equiv \\\\alpha^{\\\\frac{N(\\\\pi) - 1}{3}} \\\\bmod{\\\\pi}. =Properties= The cubic residue character has formal properties similar to those of the Legendre symbol: * If \\\\alpha \\\\equiv \\\\beta \\\\bmod{\\\\pi} then \\\\left (\\\\tfrac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\pi}\\\\right )_3=\\\\left (\\\\tfrac{\\\\beta}{\\\\pi}\\\\right )_3. * \\\\left (\\\\tfrac{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}{\\\\pi}\\\\right )_3=\\\\left (\\\\tfrac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\pi}\\\\right )_3\\\\left (\\\\tfrac{\\\\beta}{\\\\pi}\\\\right )_3. * \\\\overline{\\\\left (\\\\tfrac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\pi}\\\\right )_3}=\\\\left (\\\\tfrac{\\\\overline{\\\\alpha}}{\\\\overline{\\\\pi}}\\\\right )_3, where the bar denotes complex conjugation. * If \\\\pi and \\\\theta are associates then \\\\left (\\\\tfrac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\pi}\\\\right )_3=\\\\left (\\\\tfrac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\theta}\\\\right )_3 * The congruence x^3 \\\\equiv \\\\alpha \\\\bmod{\\\\pi} has a solution in \\\\Z[\\\\omega] if and only if \\\\left(\\\\tfrac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\pi}\\\\right)_3 = 1.Ireland & Rosen, Prop. 9.3.3 * If a, b \\\\in \\\\Z are such that \\\\gcd(a, b) = \\\\gcd(b, 3) = 1, then \\\\left(\\\\tfrac{a}{b}\\\\right)_3 = 1.Ireland & Rosen, Prop. 9.3.4Lemmermeyer, Prop 7.7 * The cubic character can be extended multiplicatively to composite numbers (coprime to 3) in the \\"denominator\\" in the same way the Legendre symbol is generalized into the Jacobi symbol. Like the Jacobi symbol, if the \\"denominator\\" of the cubic character is composite, then if the \\"numerator\\" is a cubic residue mod the \\"denominator\\" the symbol will equal 1, if the symbol does not equal 1 then the \\"numerator\\" is a cubic non-residue, but the symbol can equal 1 when the \\"numerator\\" is a non-residue: ::\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\lambda}\\\\right)_3 = \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\pi_1}\\\\right)_3^{\\\\alpha_1} \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\pi_2}\\\\right)_3^{\\\\alpha_2} \\\\cdots, :where ::\\\\lambda = \\\\pi_1^{\\\\alpha_1}\\\\pi_2^{\\\\alpha_2}\\\\pi_3^{\\\\alpha_3} \\\\cdots Statement of the theorem Let α and β be primary.

Such was the depth of change that he found it necessary to introduce a large number of neologisms, often connected to idiomatic words and phrases in the German language. Two of his most basic neologisms, present-at-hand and ready-to-hand, are used to describe various attitudes toward things in the world. For Heidegger, such \\"attitudes\\" are prior to, i.e. more basic than, the various sciences of the individual items in the world. Science itself is an attitude, one that attempts a kind of neutral investigation. Other related terms are also explained below. Heidegger's overall analysis is quite involved, taking in a lot of the history of philosophy. See Being and Time for a description of his overall project, and to give some context to these technical terms.Martin Heidegger, Being and Time, trans. John Macquarrie and Edward Robinson. New York: Harper & Row, 1962.Heidegger 1962, H.67–72  Terms =Aletheia :(Ancient Greek: ἀλήθεια) Heidegger's idea of aletheia, or disclosure (Erschlossenheit), was an attempt to make sense of how things in the world appear to human beings as part of an opening in intelligibility, as \\"unclosedness\\" or \\"unconcealedness\\". (This is Heidegger's usual reading of aletheia as Unverborgenheit, \\"unconcealment.\\")Rodney R. Coltman, The Language of Hermeneutics: Gadamer and Heidegger in Dialogue, SUNY Press, 1998, p. 38. It is closely related to the notion of world disclosure, the way in which things get their sense as part of a holistically structured, pre-interpreted background of meaning. Initially, Heidegger wanted aletheia to stand for a re- interpreted definition of truth. However, he later corrected the association of aletheia with truth.  Apophantic  :(German: apophantisch) An assertion (as opposed to a question, a doubt or a more expressive sense) is apophantic. It is a statement that covers up meaning and just gives us something as present-at-hand. For Instance, \\"The President is on vacation\\", and, \\"Salt is Sodium Chloride\\" are sentences that, because of their apophantic character, can easily be picked up and repeated in news and gossip by 'The They.' However, the real ready-to-hand meaning and context may be lost. Being-in-the-world :(German: In-der-Welt-sein) Being-in-the-world is Heidegger's replacement for terms such as subject, object, consciousness, and world. For him, the split of things into subject/object, as we find in the Western tradition and even in our language, must be overcome, as is indicated by the root structure of Husserl and Brentano's concept of intentionality, i.e., that all consciousness is consciousness of something, that there is no consciousness, as such, cut off from an object (be it the matter of a thought or of a perception). Nor are there objects without some consciousness beholding or being involved with them. At the most basic level of being-in- the-world, Heidegger notes that there is always a mood, a mood that \\"assails us\\" in our unreflecting devotion to the world. A mood comes neither from the \\"outside\\" nor from the \\"inside,\\" but arises from being-in-the-world. One may turn away from a mood but that is only to another mood; it is part of our facticity. Only with a mood are we permitted to encounter things in the world. Dasein (a co-term for being-in-the-world) has an openness to the world that is constituted by the attunement of a mood or state of mind. As such, Dasein is a \\"thrown\\" \\"projection\\" (geworfener Entwurf), projecting itself onto the possibilities that lie before it or may be hidden, and interpreting and understanding the world in terms of possibilities. Such projecting has nothing to do with comporting oneself toward a plan that has been thought out. It is not a plan, since Dasein has, as Dasein, already projected itself. Dasein always understands itself in terms of possibilities. As projecting, the understanding of Dasein is its possibilities as possibilities. One can take up the possibilities of \\"The They\\" self and merely follow along or make some more authentic understanding (see Hubert Dreyfus's book Being-in-the-World.) Being-toward-death :(German: Sein-zum-Tode) Being-toward-death is not an orientation that brings Dasein closer to its end, in terms of clinical death, but is rather a way of being.Heidegger 1962, H.247. Being-toward-death refers to a process of growing through the world where a certain foresight guides the Dasein towards gaining an authentic perspective. It is provided by dread of death. In the analysis of time, it is revealed as a threefold condition of Being. Time, the present, and the notion of the \\"eternal\\", are modes of temporality. Temporality is the way we see time. For Heidegger, it is very different from the mistaken view of time as being a linear series of past, present and future. Instead he sees it as being an ecstasy, an outside-of- itself, of futural projections (possibilities) and one's place in history as a part of one's generation. Possibilities, then, are integral to our understanding of time; our projects, or thrown projection in-the-world, are what absorb and direct us. Futurity, as a direction toward the future that always contains the past—the has-been—is a primary mode of Daseins temporality. Death is that possibility which is the absolute impossibility of Dasein. As such, it cannot be compared to any other kind of ending or \\"running out\\" of something. For example, one's death is not an empirical event. For Heidegger, death is Daseins ownmost (it is what makes Dasein individual), it is non-relational (nobody can take one's death away from one, or die in one's place, and we can not understand our own death through the death of other Dasein), and it is not to be outstripped. The \\"not-yet\\" of life is always already a part of Dasein: \\"as soon as man comes to life, he is at once old enough to die.\\" The threefold condition of death is thus simultaneously one's \\"ownmost potentiality-for-being, non-relational, and not to be out-stripped\\". Death is determinate in its inevitability, but an authentic Being-toward-death understands the indeterminate nature of one's own inevitable death — one never knows when or how it is going to come. However, this indeterminacy does not put death in some distant, futural \\"not-yet\\"; authentic Being-toward-death understands one's individual death as always already a part of one.Heidegger 1962, H.255. With average, everyday (normal) discussion of death, all this is concealed. The \\"they-self\\" talks about it in a fugitive manner, passes it off as something that occurs at some time but is not yet \\"present-at-hand\\" as an actuality, and hides its character as one's ownmost possibility, presenting it as belonging to no one in particular. It becomes devalued — redefined as a neutral and mundane aspect of existence that merits no authentic consideration. \\"One dies\\" is interpreted as a fact, and comes to mean \\"nobody dies\\".Heidegger 1962, H.253-4. On the other hand, authenticity takes Dasein out of the \\"They,\\" in part by revealing its place as a part of the They. Heidegger states that Authentic being-toward-death calls Daseins individual self out of its \\"they-self\\", and frees it to re-evaluate life from the standpoint of finitude. In so doing, Dasein opens itself up for \\"angst,\\" translated alternately as \\"dread\\" or as \\"anxiety.\\" Angst, as opposed to fear, does not have any distinct object for its dread; it is rather anxious in the face of Being-in-the-world in general — that is, it is anxious in the face of Daseins own self. Angst is a shocking individuation of Dasein, when it realizes that it is not at home in the world, or when it comes face to face with its own \\"uncanny\\" (German Unheimlich \\"not homelike\\"). In Daseins individuation, it is open to hearing the \\"call of conscience\\" (German Gewissensruf), which comes from Daseins own Self when it wants to be its Self. This Self is then open to truth, understood as unconcealment (Greek aletheia). In this moment of vision, Dasein understands what is hidden as well as hiddenness itself, indicating Heidegger's regular uniting of opposites; in this case, truth and untruth.Heidegger 1962, H.260–74. Being-with :(German: Mitsein) The term \\"Being-with\\" refers to an ontological characteristic of the human being, that it is always alreadyBy \\"always already\\" Heidegger means that every phenomenological inspection of the human being finds this characteristic. It is not founded on something else. with others of its kind. This assertion is to be understood not as a factual statement about an individual, that he or she is at the moment in spatial proximity to one or more other individuals. Rather it is a statement about the being of every human, that in the structures of its being-in-the-world one finds an implicit reference to other humans. We all live with others, and in fact we could not live without them. Humans have been called (by others, not by Heidegger) \\"ultrasocial\\"Haidt, Jonathan. The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom. New York: Basic Books, 2006, pp. 47 ff. and \\"obligatorily gregarious.\\"de Waal, Frans. Primates and Philosophers: How Morality Evolved. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2006, p. 4. Without others of our kind we could not survive. Heidegger, from his phenomenological perspective, calls this feature of human life \\"Being-with\\" (Mitsein), and says it is essential to being human.Heidegger 1962, p. 156, H.125. We are inauthentic when we fail to recognize how much and in what ways how we think of ourselves and how we habitually behave is influenced by our social surroundings. We are authentic when we pay attention to that influence and decide for ourselves whether to go along with it or not. Living entirely without such influence, however, is not an option. Care (or concern) :(German: Sorge) A fundamental basis of our being-in-the-world is, for Heidegger, not matter or spirit but care: ::Dasein's facticity is such that its Being-in-the-world has always dispersed itself or even split itself up into definite ways of Being-in. The multiplicity of these is indicated by the following examples: having to do with something, producing something, attending to something and looking after it, making use of something, giving something up and letting it go, undertaking, accomplishing, evincing, interrogating, considering, discussing, determining. . . .Heidegger 1962, H.56 All these ways of Being-in have concern (Sorge, care) as their kind of Being. Just as the scientist might investigate or search, and presume neutrality, we see that beneath this there is the mood, the concern of the scientist to discover, to reveal new ideas or theories and to attempt to level off temporal aspects. Clearing :(German: Lichtung) In German the word Lichtung means a clearing, as in, for example, a clearing in the woods. Since its root is the German word for light (Licht), it is sometimes also translated as \\"lighting,\\" and in Heidegger's work it refers to the necessity of a clearing in which anything at all can appear, the clearing in which some thing or idea can show itself, or be unconcealed.Heidegger 1962, H.133 Note the relation that this has to Aletheia (see the main article or the entry above) and disclosure. Beings (Seiendes), but not Being itself (Sein), stand out as if in a clearing, or physically, as if in a space.This notion of the clearing, or of aspects pertaining to the leeway, spacing, giving room, and dwelling are treated in: Nader El-Bizri \\"ON KAI KHORA: Situating Heidegger between the Sophist and the Timaeus,\\" Studia Phaenomenologica, Vol. IV, Issues 1-2 (2004), pp. 73–98; Nader El-Bizri, \\"Being at Home Among Things: Heidegger’s Reflections on Dwelling\\", Environment, Space, Place, Vol. 3 (2011), pp. 47–71; Nader El- Bizri, \\"On Dwelling: Heideggerian Allusions to Architectural Phenomenology\\", Studia UBB. Philosophia, Vol. 60, No. 1 (2015): 5-30. See also Khôra and Phenomenology (architecture) in addition to the 'architecture' section under the main Heidegger entry on Wikipedia. Thus, Hubert Dreyfus writes, \\"things show up in the light of our understanding of being.\\"Hubert Dreyfus, Being-in- the-World. Cambridge: MIT Press, 1995. p. 163 Thus the clearing makes possible the disclosure of beings (Seiendes), and also access to Dasein's own being. But the clearing is not, itself, an entity that can be known directly, in the sense in which know about the entities of the world. As Heidegger writes in On the Origin of the Work of Art: :\\"In the midst of being as a whole an open place occurs. There is a clearing, a lighting. Thought of in reference to what is, to beings, this clearing is in a greater degree than are beings. This open center is therefore not surrounded by what is; rather, the lighting center itself encircles all that is, like the Nothing which we scarcely know. That which is can only be, as a being, if it stands within and stands out within what is lighted in this clearing. Only this clearing grants and guarantees to us humans a passage to those beings that we ourselves are not, and access to the being that we ourselves are.\\" Heidegger, M. 2001, On the Origin of the Work of Art. In Poetry, language, thought. (A. Hofstadter, Trans.) (1st ed.). New York: Perennical Classics. (Original work published 1971) Destruktion Founded in the work of Martin Luther, here is Martin Heidegger on philosophy as the task of destroying ontological concepts, including ordinary everyday meanings of words like time, history, being, theory, death, mind, body, matter, logic etc.: :When tradition thus becomes master, it does so in such a way that what it 'transmits' is made so inaccessible, proximally and for the most part, that it rather becomes concealed. Tradition takes what has come down to us and delivers it over to self-evidence; it blocks our access to those primordial 'sources' from which the categories and concepts handed down to us have been in part quite genuinely drawn. Indeed it makes us forget that they have had such an origin, and makes us suppose that the necessity of going back to these sources is something which we need not even understand. (Being and Time, p. 43) Heidegger considers that tradition can become calcified here and there: :If the question of Being is to have its own history made transparent, then this hardened tradition must be loosened up, and the concealments which it has brought about dissolved. We understand this task as one in which by taking the question of Being as our clue we are to destroy the traditional content of ancient ontology until we arrive at those primordial experiences in which we achieved our first ways of determining the nature of Being—the ways which have guided us ever since. (Being and Time, p. 44) Heidegger then remarks on the positivity of his project of Destruktion: :it has nothing to do with a vicious relativizing of ontological standpoints. But this destruction is just as far from having the negative sense of shaking off the ontological tradition. We must, on the contrary, stake out the positive possibilities of that tradition, and this means keeping it within its limits; and these in turn are given factically in the way the question is formulated at the time, and in the way the possible field for investigation is thus bounded off. On its negative side, this destruction does not relate itself toward the past; its criticism is aimed at 'today' and at the prevalent way of treating the history of ontology. .. But to bury the past in nullity (Nichtigkeit) is not the purpose of this destruction; its aim is positive; its negative function remains unexpressed and indirect. (Being and Time, p. 44) Dasein In his effort to redefine man, Heidegger introduces a statement: ‘the ownmost of Dasein consists in its existence” (BT, 68). Let us first clarify what Heidegger means by existence. He had already said that what is unique to the being of man is that “in its very being its own being is an issue for it” (BT, 33). A cat doesn't concern itself with being a cat, a tree doesn't concern itself with being a tree, but persons do concern themselves with being certain kinds of persons (a builder, painter, woman, parent and so on). This is because, unlike cats or trees, we define our own being as we go along. We are continually faced with possibilities from among which we can choose and, at each choice, we actualize at least one of the possibilities available to us while closing off others in the process. This grasping of only some possibilities defines us as one kind of self rather than another: a dishonest choice defines us as dishonest, fixing broken windows defines us as a glazier, and so on. We have to carry out these choices daily; being brave last week for instance does not mean that you are being brave today. Therefore, living the life of a person is a matter of constantly (a) taking a stand on who we are and (b) being defined as who we are by taking that stand (no choice is 'once and for always' so we have to keep on choosing to be who we are). Added to this, the being of everything else on the planet is also an issue for us because we deal with things as what they are and persons as who they are. Only persons, for example, deal with spades as spades or cards as cards (i.e., we relate to them as meaningful and as fitting meaningfully into and with other things and/or activities). Only that being that is in the manner of existence can encounter another entity in its instrumental character as a spade or a playing card. Again, ‘to be an issue’ means to be concerned about something and to care for something. In other words, being of Dasein as existence is so constituted that in its very being it has a caring relationship to its own being. This relationship is not a theoretical or self-reflective one but rather it is a pre-theoretical one which Heidegger calls a relation or compartment of understanding. Dasein understands itself in its own being or Dasein is in the manner that its being is always disclosed to it. It is this disclosure of being that differentiates Dasein from all other beings. This manner of being of Dasein to which it relates or comports itself is called ‘existence’ (BT, 32). Further it is essential to have a clear understanding of the term ‘ownmost’. It is the English rendering of the German ‘wesen’ translated usually as ‘essence’ (the whatness). The verbal form of German term ‘wesen’ comes closer to the Indian root ‘vasati’ which means dwelling, living, growing, maturing, moving etc. Thus, this verbal dynamic character implied in the word ‘wesen’ is to be kept in mind to understand the nuance of the Heideggerian usage of ‘existence’. If traditionally ‘Wesen’ had been translated as essence in the sense of ‘whatness,’ for Heidegger such a translation is unfit to understand what is uniquely human. Heidegger takes the form of existence from the Latin word Ex-sistere (to stand out of itself) with an indication of the unique characteristic of the being of man in terms of a dynamic ‘HOW’ as against the traditional conception in terms of ‘whatness’. Hence existence for Heidegger means how Dasein in its very way of being is always outside itself in a relationship of relating, caring as opposed to a relationship of cognitive understanding to other innerworldly beings. Thereby, it is to differentiate strictly, what is ownmost to Dasein from that of other modes of beings that Heidegger uses the term ‘existence’ for the being of man. For what is ownmost to other modes of beings, he uses the term present-at- hand. The various elements of Existence are called ‘existentials’ and that of what is present-at-hand are called the ‘categories’. According to Heidegger “man alone exists, all other things are (they don’t exist)”. It is important to understand that this notion of ‘existence’ as what is ownmost to man is not a static concept to be defined once and for all in terms of a content but it has to be understood in terms of something that is to be enacted that varies from individual to individual and from time to time unlike other beings that have a fixed essence. Now that being whose ownmost is in the manner of existence is called Dasein. In German ‘da’ has a spatial connotation of either being ‘there’ or ‘here’. Dasein thus can mean simply “being there or here”. In German, it could also refer to the existence (as opposed to the essence) of something, especially that of man. But Heidegger invests this term with a new ontological meaning. The German term ‘Dasein’ consists of two components: ‘Da’ and ‘sein’. In the Heideggerian usage, the suffix ‘-sein’ stands for the being of man in the manner of existence and ‘Da-’ stands for a three-fold disclosure. According to Heidegger, the being of man is in the manner of a threefold disclosure. That is, the ontological uniqueness of man consists in the fact that its being becomes the da/sphere, where not only its own being, but the being of other non-human beings as well as the phenomenon of world is disclosed to Dasein because of which it can encounter the innerworldly beings in their worlding character. Hence, for Heidegger the term Dasein is a title for the ontological structure of the ontical human being. Disclosure :(German: Erschlossenheit) Hubert Dreyfus and Charles Spinosa write that: \\"According to Heidegger our nature is to be world disclosers. That is, by means of our equipment and coordinated practices we human beings open coherent, distinct contexts or worlds in which we perceive, feel, act, and think.\\"Hubert Dreyfus and Charles Spinosa, \\"Further Reflections on Heidegger, Technology and the Everyday,\\" in Nikolas Kompridis, ed. Philosophical Romanticism, New York: Routledge, 2006, 265. Heidegger scholar Nikolas Kompridis writes: \\"World disclosure refers, with deliberate ambiguity, to a process which actually occurs at two different levels. At one level, it refers to the disclosure of an already interpreted, symbolically structured world; the world, that is, within which we always already find ourselves. At another level, it refers as much to the disclosure of new horizons of meaning as to the disclosure of previously hidden or unthematized dimensions of meaning.\\"Nikolas Kompridis, \\"On World Disclosure: Heidegger, Habermas and Dewey,\\" Thesis Eleven 1994; 37; 29-45. Discourse :(German: Rede) The ontological-existential structure of Dasein consists of \\"thrownness\\" (Geworfenheit), \\"projection\\" (Entwurf), and \\"being-along-with\\"/\\"engagement\\" (Sein-bei). These three basic features of existence are inseparably bound to \\"discourse\\" (Rede), understood as the deepest unfolding of language.Parvis Emad, On the Way to Heidegger’s Contributions to Philosophy, University of Wisconsin Press, 2007, p. 189. Equipment :(German: das Zeug) An object in the world with which we have meaningful dealings. A nearly un-translatable term, Heidegger's equipment can be thought of as a collective noun, so that it is never appropriate to call something 'an equipment'. Instead, its use often reflects it to mean a tool, or as an \\"in-order-to\\" for Dasein. Tools, in this collective sense, and in being ready-to-hand, always exist in a network of other tools and organizations, e.g., the paper is on a desk in a room at a university. It is inappropriate usually to see such equipment on its own or as something present-at-hand. Another, less prosaic, way of thinking of 'equipment' is as 'stuff we can work with' around us, along with its context. \\"The paper we can do things with, from the desk, in the university, in the city, on the world, in the universe.\\" 'Equipment' refers to the thing, and its usefulness possibilities, and its context. Ereignis Ereignis is translated often as \\"an event,\\" but is better understood in terms of something \\"coming into view.\\" It comes from the German prefix, er-, comparable to 're-' in English, and Auge, eye.Richard F. H. Polt, The Emergency of Being: On Heidegger's Contributions to Philosophy, Richard F. H. Polt, p. 73.Giorgio Agamben, Potentialities: Collected Essays, Stanford University Press, 1999, p. 117. It is a noun coming from a reflexive verb. Note that the German prefix er- also can connote an end or a fatality. A recent translation of the word by Kenneth Maly and Parvis Emad renders the word as \\"enowning\\"; that in connection with things that arise and appear, that they are arising 'into their own'. Hubert Dreyfus defined the term as \\"things coming into themselves by belonging together.\\" Ereignis appears in Heidegger's later works and is not easily summarized. The most sustained treatment of the theme occurs in the cryptic and difficult Contributions to Philosophy. In the following quotation he associates it with the fundamental idea of concern from Being and Time, the English etymology of con-cern is similar to that of the German: :: ...we must return to what we call a concern. The word Ereignis (concern) has been lifted from organically developing language. Er-eignen (to concern) means, originally, to distinguish or discern which one's eyes see, and in seeing calling to oneself, ap-propriate. The word con-cern we shall now harness as a theme word in the service of thought.Martin Heidegger, Identity and Difference, trans. Joan Stambaugh. New York: Harper & Row, 1969. Existence :(German Existenz) See Dasein above Existentiell :(German: Existenziell) Gelassenheit Often translated as \\"releasement,\\" Heidegger's concept of Gelassenheit has been explained as \\"the spirit of disponibilité [availability] before What-Is which permits us simply to let things be in whatever may be their uncertainty and their mystery.\\" Cited in Heidegger elaborated the idea of Gelassenheit in 1959, with a homonymous volume which includes two texts: a 1955 talk entitled simply Gelassenheit, 13th Edition: Klett-Cotta (Stuttgart), 2004. ; . and a 'conversation' (Gespräch) entitled Zur Erörterung der Gelassenheit. Aus einem Feldweggespräch über das Denken (\\"Towards an Explication of Gelassenheit: From a Conversation on a Country Path about Thinking\\" or \\"Toward an Emplacing Discussion [Erörterung] of Releasement [Gelassenheit]: From a Country Path Conversation about Thinking\\"). An English translation of this text was published in 1966 as \\"Conversation on a Country Path about Thinking\\". He borrowed the term from the Christian mystical tradition, proximately from Meister Eckhart. See Carlo Angelino, Il religioso nel pensiero di Martin Heidegger, in Martin Heidegger, L'abbandono, tr. Adriano Fabris (Genova: Il Melangolo, 1986), p. 19. Geworfenheit Geworfenheit describes our individual existences as \\"being thrown\\" (geworfen) into the world. For William J. Richardson, Heidegger used this single term, \\"thrown-ness,\\" to \\"describe [the] two elements of the original situation, There-being's non-mastery of its own origin and its referential dependence on other beings\\". 4th Edition (2003). New York: Fordham University Press. ; . P. 37. Height\\") Kehre Heidegger's Kehre, or \\"the turn\\" (die Kehre) is a term rarely used by Heidegger but employed by commentators who refer to a change in his writings as early as 1930 that became clearly established by the 1940s. Recurring themes that characterize much of the Kehre include poetry and technology. Commentators (e.g. William J. Richardson 4th Edition (2003). The Bronx: Fordham University Press. ; .) describe, variously, a shift of focus, or a major change in outlook. The 1935 Introduction to Metaphysics \\"clearly shows the shift\\" to language from a previous emphasis on Dasein in Being and Time eight years earlier, according to Brian Bard's 1993 essay titled \\"Heidegger's Reading of Heraclitus.\\"Brian Bard, 1993, essay, see sections one and three https://sites.google.com/site/heideggerheraclitus/ In a 1950 lecture Heidegger formulated the famous saying \\"Language speaks\\", later published in the 1959 essays collection Unterwegs zur Sprache, and collected in the 1971 English book Poetry, Language, Thought.Lyon, James K. Paul Celan and Martin Heidegger: an unresolved conversation, 1951–1970, pp. 128–9Philipse, Herman (1998) Heidegger's philosophy of being: a critical interpretation, p. 205Heidegger (1971) Poetry, Language, Thought, translation and introduction by Albert Hofstadter, pp. xxv and 187ff This supposed shift -- applied here to cover about thirty years of Heidegger's 40-year writing career -- has been described by commentators from widely varied viewpoints; including as a shift in priority from Being and Time to Time and Being—namely, from dwelling (being) in the world to doing (time) in the world. (This aspect, in particular the 1951 essay \\"Building, Dwelling Thinking\\" influenced several notable architectural theorists, including Christian Norberg-Schulz, Dalibor Vesely, Joseph Rykwert, Daniel Libeskind and the philosopher-architect Nader El- Bizri.)Refer to a recent study on Heidegger's conception of \\"dwelling\\" as set in: Nader El-Bizri, 'On Dwelling: Heideggerian Allusions to Architectural Phenomenology', Studia UBB Philosophia 60 (2015): 5-30.

Thomas Sheehan (2001) believes this supposed change is \\"far less dramatic than usually suggested,\\" and entailed a change in focus and method. Thomas Sheehan, \\"Kehre and Ereignis, a proglenoma to Introduction to Metaphysics\\" in \\"A companion to Heidegger's Introduction to Metaphysics\\" page 15, 2001, Sheehan contends that throughout his career, Heidegger never focused on \\"being,\\" but rather tried to define \\"[that which] brings about being as a givenness of entities.\\" ibid. see also, Sheehan, \\"Making sense of Heidegger. A paradigm shift.\\" New Heidegger Research. London (England) 2015. Mark WrathallWrathall, Mark: Heidegger and Unconcealment: Truth, Language, and History, Cambridge University Press, 2011 argued (2011) that the Kehre isn't found in Heidegger's writings but is simply a misconception. As evidence for this view, Wrathall sees a consistency of purpose in Heidegger's life-long pursuit and refinement of his notion of \\"unconcealment.\\" Among the notable works dating after 1934 are \\"Building Dwelling Thinking\\", 1951), and \\"The Question Concerning Technology\\", (1954) \\"The Origin of the Work of Art\\", (1935), Contributions to Philosophy (From Enowning), composed in the years 1936–38 but not published until 1989 and \\"On the Essence of Truth\\", (1930), and What Is Called Thinking? (1954). Also during this period, Heidegger wrote extensively on Nietzsche and the poet Holderlin. Ontic :(German: ontisch) Heidegger uses the term ontic, often in contrast to the term ontological, when he gives descriptive characteristics of a particular thing and the \\"plain facts\\" of its existence. What is ontic is what makes something what it is. For an individual discussing the nature of \\"being\\", one's ontic could refer to the physical, factual elements that produce and/or underlie one's own reality - the physical brain and its substructures. Moralists raise the question of a moral ontic when discussing whether there exists an external, objective, independent source or wellspring for morality that transcends culture and time. Ontological :(German: ontologisch) As opposed to \\"ontic\\" (ontisch), ontological is used when the nature, or meaningful structure of existence is at issue. Ontology, a discipline of philosophy, focuses on the formal study of Being. Thus, something that is ontological is concerned with understanding and investigating Being, the ground of Being, or the concept of Being itself. For an individual discussing the nature of \\"being\\", the ontological could refer to one's own first-person, subjective, phenomenological experience of being. Possibility :(German: Möglichkeit) A term used only once in a particular edition of Being and Time. In the text, the term appears to denote \\"the possibility whose probability it is solely to be possible\\". At least, if it were used in context, this is the only plausible definition. Present-at- hand :(German: vorhanden; Vorhandenheit \\"presence-at-hand\\") With the present-at-hand one has (in contrast to \\"ready-to-hand\\") an attitude like that of a scientist or theorist, of merely looking at or observing something. In seeing an entity as present-at-hand, the beholder is concerned only with the bare facts of a thing or a concept, as they are present and in order to theorize about it. This way of seeing is disinterested in the concern it may hold for Dasein, its history or usefulness. This attitude is often described as existing in neutral space without any particular mood or subjectivity. However, for Heidegger, it is not completely disinterested or neutral. It has a mood, and is part of the metaphysics of presence that tends to level all things down. Through his writings, Heidegger sets out to accomplish the Destruktion (see above) of this metaphysics of presence. Present-at-hand is not the way things in the world are usually encountered, and it is only revealed as a deficient or secondary mode, e.g., when a hammer breaks it loses its usefulness and appears as merely there, present-at-hand. When a thing is revealed as present-at-hand, it stands apart from any useful set of equipment but soon loses this mode of being present-at-hand and becomes something, for example, that must be repaired or replaced. Ready-to-hand :(German griffbereit, zuhanden; Zuhandenheit \\"readiness-to-hand, handiness\\") In almost all cases we are involved in the world in an ordinary, and more involved, way. We are usually doing things with a view to achieving something. Take for example, a hammer: it is ready-to-hand; we use it without theorizing. In fact, if we were to look at it as present-at-hand, we might easily make a mistake. Only when it breaks or something goes wrong might we see the hammer as present-at-hand, just lying there. Even then however, it may be not fully present-at-hand, as it is now showing itself as something to be repaired or disposed, and therefore a part of the totality of our involvements. In this case its Being may be seen as unreadiness-to-hand. Heidegger outlines three manners of unreadiness-to-hand: Conspicuous (damaged; e.g., a lamp's wiring has broken), Obtrusive (a part is missing which is required for the entity to function; e.g., we find the bulb is missing), Obstinate (when the entity is a hindrance to us in pursuing a project; e.g., the lamp blocks my view of the computer screen). Importantly, the ready-to-hand only emerges from the prior attitude in which we care about what is going on and we see the hammer in a context or world of equipment that is handy or remote, and that is there \\"in order to\\" do something. In this sense the ready-to-hand is primordial compared to that of the present-at-hand. The term primordial here does not imply something Primitive, but rather refers to Heidegger's idea that Being can only be understood through what is everyday and \\"close\\" to us. Our everyday understanding of the world is necessarily a part of any kind of scientific or theoretical studies of entities — the present-at-hand — might be. Only by studying our \\"average-everyday\\" understanding of the world, as it is expressed in the totality of our relationships to the ready-to-hand entities of the world, can we lay appropriate bases for specific scientific investigations into specific entities within the world. For Heidegger in Being and Time this illustrates, in a very practical way, the way the present-at-hand, as a present in a \\"now\\" or a present eternally (as, for example, a scientific law or a Platonic Form), has come to dominate intellectual thought, especially since the Enlightenment. To understand the question of being one must be careful not to fall into this leveling off, or forgetfulness of being, that has come to assail Western thought since Socrates, see the metaphysics of presence. Resoluteness :(German: Entschlossenheit) Resoluteness refers to one's ability to \\"unclose\\" one's framework of intelligibility (i.e., to make sense of one's words and actions in terms of one's life as a whole), and the ability to be receptive to the \\"call of conscience.\\" The One / the They :(German: Das Man, meaning \\"they-self\\") One of the most interesting and important 'concepts' in Being and Time is that of Das Man, for which there is no exact English translation; different translations and commentators use different conventions. It is often translated as \\"the They\\" or \\"People\\" or \\"Anyone\\" but is more accurately translated as \\"One\\" (as in \\"'one' should always arrive on time\\"). Das Man derives from the impersonal singular pronoun man ('one', as distinct from 'I', or 'you', or 'he', or 'she', or 'they'). Both the German man and the English 'one' are neutral or indeterminate in respect of gender and, even, in a sense, of number, though both words suggest an unspecified, unspecifiable, indeterminate plurality. The semantic role of the word man in German is nearly identical to that of the word one in English. Heidegger refers to this concept of the One in explaining inauthentic modes of existence, in which Dasein, instead of truly choosing to do something, does it only because \\"That is what one does\\" or \\"That is what people do\\". Thus, das Man is not a proper or measurable entity, but rather an amorphous part of social reality that functions effectively in the manner that it does through this intangibility. Das Man constitutes a possibility of Dasein's Being, and so das Man cannot be said to be any particular someone. Rather, the existence of 'the They' is known to us through, for example, linguistic conventions and social norms. Heidegger states that, \\"The \\"they\\" prescribes one's state-of- mind, and determines what and how one 'sees'\\". To give examples: when one makes an appeal to what is commonly known, one says \\"one does not do such a thing\\"; When one sits in a car or bus or reads a newspaper, one is participating in the world of 'the They'. This is a feature of 'the They' as it functions in society, an authority that has no particular source. In a non- moral sense Heidegger contrasts \\"the authentic self\\" (\\"my owned self\\") with \\"the they self\\" (\\"my un-owned self\\"). A related concept to this is that of the apophantic assertion. World :(German: Welt) Heidegger gives us four ways of using the term world: ::1. \\"World\\" is used as an ontical concept, and signifies the totality of things which can be present-at-hand within the world. ::2. \\"World\\" functions as an ontological term, and signifies the Being of those things we have just mentioned. And indeed 'world' can become a term for any realm which encompasses a multiplicity of entities: for instance, when one talks of the 'world' of a mathematician, 'world' signifies the realm of possible objects of mathematics. ::3. \\"World\\" can be understood in another ontical sense—not, however, as those entities which Dasein essentially is not and which can be encountered within-the-world, but rather as the wherein a factical Dasein as such can be said to 'live'. \\"World\\" has here a pre- ontological existentiell signification. Here again there are different possibilities: \\"world\\" may stand for the 'public' we-world, or one's 'own' closest (domestic) environment. ::4. Finally, \\"world\\" designates the ontologico-existential concept of worldhood (Weltheit). Worldhood itself may have as its modes whatever structural wholes any special 'worlds' may have at the time; but it embraces in itself the a priori character of worldhood in general.Heidegger 1962, H.64 Note, it is the third definition that Heidegger normally uses.

Jennings played for Nippon Professional Baseball's Orix Blue Wave for three seasons (–). Early career (1984–1987) Jennings was drafted by the Angels in the 2nd round of the 1984 MLB Draft. He started his professional career in Salem. In 1985, he was brought up to Quad Cities. In 1986, he was brought up to Palm Springs. In 1987, he was brought up to Midland. After the season, he was selected by the Oakland Athletics in the Rule V Draft on December 7, 1987. Career with the Oakland A's (1987–1991) Doug made his Major League debut with the Oakland A's In 1988. His major league career got off to a quick start in April 1988 for Oakland. The Athletics had taken him from the Angels system the previous off-season. Now, in his first major-league start, Jennings went 4 for 4, hitting a home run and scoring four times. Career with the Chicago Cubs (1993) Doug arrived in Chicago from Des Moines around 5 pm Tuesday, June 1. Four hours later, his pinch-hit double broke a seventh-inning tie and sparked the Cubs to an 8–3 victory over the New York Mets in front of another 30,000-plus in drizzly Wrigley Field. Japan – Orix Blue Wave (1995–1997) \\"DJ\\" played in Japan for 3 years with the Orix Blue Wave, teammates with Ichiro all three seasons, Doug batted in the lineup in either the 3 or 4 hole and helped lead Orix to consecutive NPB series, losing in 1995 and winning in 1996. In game 4 of the 1995 series DJ hit an extra-inning HR which proved to be the game winner, for the only game they won in the series which they lost 4 games to 1. One of the highlights of his time in Japan was tying a Japanese HR record by hitting home runs in four consecutive at-bats.

The system was constructed at a cost of S$14 million by Von Roll of Switzerland, who also built the Singapore Cable Car. Commencing operations on 23 February 1982, the line had initially only five stations. In 1987, the Ferry Terminal Monorail Station began operations when the Sentosa Ferry Terminal opened that year. In 1991, the Underwater World Monorail Station commenced operations when Underwater World opened that year. It operated several 16-car, non-air conditioned trains in a unidirectional counter-clockwise single loop through seven stations located around the western half of the island. The monorail rides were initially charged at S$3 for adults and S$1.50 for children. The trip was later made free for passengers, who could ride the system as often as they wished throughout their stay on the island. Four of the stations have two platforms; for such stations, the Spanish solution was implemented, where passengers alight at one platform and board at the opposite platform. History=Background Plans for the monorail were first announced in 1979, and it was planned to serve as a mode of transportation around Sentosa as well as to make the island more attractive to visitors. At that point in time, transport around the island was provided by a fleet of double-decker buses. Construction and opening Site surveys commenced in March 1980, and construction began six months later. Initially expected to be completed in April 1982, it was completed two months before schedule at a cost of S$16 million, and opened on 23 February 1982. Four intermediate stations along the line at several locations around the island were opened on 1 December the same year. This resulted in the bus service to these locations being terminated, and the monorail thus became the main mode of transport around the island. As a result of the monorail's opening, as well as the opening of several other attractions, the number of visitors to Sentosa also shot up, increasing to 1,067,192 visitors from 567,567 visitors over the same period in the previous year. Closure Due to the rapid modernisation of the island, maintenance problems, increasing costs, and declining popularity as visitors started complaining that the ride was slow and uncomfortable, the Sentosa Monorail ceased operations on 16 March 2005 to make way for the new four-station Sentosa Express monorail. Much of the track and all of the rolling stock were sold as scrap for S$350,000. A subsequent assessment showed that some of the butt welds did not match the specification of British Standards.Yue Choong Kog: Appraisal of a Demolished Monorail System. Journal of Performance of Constructed Facilities, Band 30, Nr. 6.

It was written in four days by James Griffith, who played the preacher in the film. Lorna marks the end of Meyer's \\"nudies\\" and his first foray into serious film making. It was his first film in the sexploitation style with a dramatic storyline. It was one of Meyer's early, rural gothic films. It is perhaps his most romantic film, despite the tragic ending. Meyer describes the movie as \\"a brutal examination of the important realities of power, prophecy, freedom and justice in our society against a background of violence and lust, where simplicity is only a facade.\\" Reviews described Maitland as \\"a wanton of unparalleled emotion [...] unrestrained earthiness [...] destined to set a new standard of voluptuous beauty.\\" Lorna was called \\"the female Tom Jones\\". Lorna was the first of three films Meyer filmed featuring Lorna Maitland. Though still a low-budget, it was the most expensive film he had made to date, and was Meyer's first film in 35 mm.  Plot  The publicity to Lorna exclaimed: \\"Without artistic surrender, without compromise, without question or apology, an important motion picture was produced: LORNA—a woman too much for one man.\\" Lorna (Lorna Maitland) is a sexually unsatisfied young wife married to Jim (James Rucker), who works at a salt mine and spends his evenings studying to become a CPA. When Lorna goes for a nude swim in the river, she is raped by an escaped convict (Mark Bradley), but her frustrated sexuality is awakened. She invites the stranger to their home while Jim is at work. Meanwhile, Jim's co-workers tease him about his wife's beauty and infidelity. Jim returns home early and discovers Lorna's unfaithfulness. The events take place on Jim and Lorna's anniversary, which Jim has forgotten. Cast *Lorna Maitland as Lorna *James Rucker as Jim Production \\"That was breaking into what I call the quasi-foreign film,\\" said Meyer later. \\"I wanted to make a Bitter Rice in America. A morality play! Good vs evil! The incredibly stacked Lorna Maitland, the innocent husband, the devil's advocate! She paid for her sins in the end by having an ice tong struck through that heaving chest.\\"King of the Nudies on Biggest Film Caper Yet Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times November 30, 1969: s18. Meyer had originally offered the lead role to Maria Andre, an actress who had been in his earlier Heavenly Bodies! (1963). However Meyer was unhappy with her breast size and continued to look for alternatives. Meyer's wife and business partner Eve discovered Barbara Pope. She was cast and Meyer paid off Andre. Meyer renamed Pope \\"Lorna Maitland\\". She was pregnant during the shoot. (She would later give the baby up for adoption.) The film was shot in black and white over 10 days in September 1963, mainly on the small main street that runs through the town of Walnut Grove, California. In 1973 Meyer said at the time he made Lorna, \\"if I did a rape scene it struck me that it was terribly erotic and exciting. Today it would not strike me the same way. I would probably treat it in a much more ludicrous fashion, more outrageous. But then again, even then I was doing that, because I always had a woman raped in the most difficult circumstances, in a swamp, or in six feet of water, or out in a sand dune. I guess my jibes at sex have been just exactly that. I've looked upon sex in a kind of a humorous, outrageous way.\\"SEX, VIOLENCE AND DRUGS ALL IN GOOD FUN! Berkowitz, Stan. Film Comment; New York Vol. 9, Iss. 1, (Jan/Feb 1973): 47–51.

Los Angeles Times September 18, 1964: C10. The film was prosecuted for obscenity in Maryland, Pennsylvania and Florida, but became a major success at drive-in, downtown theaters, and even made appearances at art-house cinemas. According to Roger Ebert, the film grossed almost a million dollars.

Gameplay Set in some unspecified time in the future, vehicles are retrofitted with futuristic engine and turbo technology, in addition to jets mounted to allow the car to perform midair stunts. These stunts, including flips, barrel rolls, etc., allow the player to accumulate cash rewards during races on levitating tracks. Money accumulated is used to purchase new cars, as well as upgraded parts for cars. Modes *Contest Mode - One player selects one of four characters, each with their own unique cars. From there, players compete in races against a full tournament consisting of dozens of AI- controlled opponents. Although the character biographies hint that the computer characters have distinct racing personalities, there is no direct interaction with them and they serve no purpose whatsoever in gameplay. For each heat, a certain number of points is awarded for each place. The player must place high enough overall in each round to advance. Placing first in a race allows the player to keep all money earned, second place allows half of the money earned to be kept, and no money is kept for places 3–6. There are five leagues to race through, each bringing an increasing level of difficulty, more opponents with better vehicles, more rounds, and more tracks. When a first-place overall finish is attained, the player races one-on-one against the league owner, with the prize of the league owner's car. The leagues are, in order of increasing difficulty: **Kid Cola's League **Bunny's League **Hill Bully's League **Big John's League **Dr. Death's League (Note: The player has to play the game on the Hard difficulty in order to access Dr. Death's league.) Replay is available to view after every race in contest mode. *Quick Race - One to four players can compete in an arcade-style race where the cash prizes do not accumulate above $1,000 (When a player reaches $1,000+, each $1,000 is automatically traded for a Turbo that they can use to at any time to go faster.) The cars available (and their upgrade status) depends upon the game save last loaded in Contest Mode. The two main modes of the Quick Race are Single Race (with optional computer opponents) and Practice (with no computer opponents). The two stunt tracks, Half Pipe, and Stunt Bowl, are open only in Quick Race. Replay is not available to view after every race in quick race mode, with the exception of Stunt Bowl and Half Pipe. A race on the Soda Mountain track. Cars When a career is first started in Contest Mode, the player selects one of four starter characters, each with their own car: Warbird Light, Z-Bucket, Stottlemeyer, and Del Raye. Cash prizes can later be used to purchase the rest of these starter cars if desired, along with other cars that are available by purchase only. Among these aforementioned cars, once they reach full upgrade, a fancier version of the car comes up for sale. These \\"upgraded\\" cars cannot have their parts upgraded. Neither can the cars earned from league owners. Music The game features a soundtrack composed by Devin Hurd. The game's soundtrack is unique in that each song in the game uses three different types of instrument sets depending on the level selected; a 50's/Jazz instrument set, a modern rock/country set, and an analog/synthesizer set. Rarity Stunt Racer 64 was released exclusively through Blockbuster Video rental stores in North America both for rent and for purchase. Depending on the location, a Blockbuster patron renting this game was either rented the complete game (box, manual, and cartridge) or just the cartridge and manual. Oftentimes the outer box was used as the store display box which explains the lack of a price on many of the price stickers that are found on a majority of surviving boxes. Due to the nature of game rentals, the cartridges were sometimes cracked or damaged physically over their rental lifespan, while the manuals often went home with the first person to rent the game and were returned damaged, destroyed, or not returned at all. Also, some Blockbuster store employees would discard the boxes and manuals when the games were put out for rental per the store manager or other policy. As with many other Nintendo 64 Blockbuster rental exclusive games, these conditions resulted in a very rare game to find in mint, complete condition. These rarity ratings place a complete copy of Stunt Racer 64, including cartridge, box, and manual, near the top of the list of Rarest Nintendo 64 games.

Competitors attempt to break cryptograms published on the competition website. In the 2007/08 challenge, 1301 teams participated. Participants must be in full-time education and aged 18 or under on 31 August of the year that the challenge finishes. Format The competition is organised into eight to ten challenges, which are further subdivided into parts A and B. The part A challenge consists of a comparatively simpler cryptogram, and usually provides some useful information to assist in the solving of part B. Part B is usually more complex. In later challenges the cryptograms become harder to break. In the past, part A cryptograms have been encrypted with the Caesar cipher, the Affine cipher, the Keyword cipher, the Transposition cipher, the Vigenère cipher and the 2x2 Hill cipher. The part B challenges are intended to be harder. These begin with relatively simple substitution ciphers, including the Bacon cipher and Polybius square, before moving on to transposition ciphers, Playfair ciphers and polyalphabetic ciphers such as the Vigenère cipher, the Autokey cipher and the Alberti cipher. In the later stages of the competition, the ADFGVX cipher, the Solitaire cipher, the Double Playfair cipher, the Hill cipher, the Book cipher and versions of the Enigma and Fialka cipher machines have all been used. The 2009 challenge ended with a Jefferson Disk cipher, the 2012 challenge ended with the ADFGVX Cipher, the 2014 with the Playfair Cipher, and the most recent challenge ended with a sectioned Cadenus transposition. Prizes £25 cash prizes are awarded to eight random entrants who submit a correct solution for each part A of the challenge. Leaderboards for the part B challenges are also compiled, based on how accurate solutions are and how quickly the entrant broke the cipher. Prizes are awarded to the top three entrants at the end of the challenge. In the 2009/10 challenge, the sponsors provided several prizes: IBM provided iPod Touches to each member of the team winning the Team Prize, Trinity College provided a cash prize of £700, and GCHQ provided a cash prize of £1000. In previous years prizes such as an IBM Thinkpad laptop have been awarded. After the challenge the winners of the top prizes and other randomly selected entrants are invited to a day held at Bletchley Park consisting of lectures (with subjects such as the Semantic Web, World War II cryptography and computer programming) and the prize-giving ceremony.

Groups of \\"drug pushers, homeless people and young people known as squatters and punks,\\" had largely taken over the park. The East Village and Alphabet City communities were divided about what, if anything, should be done about it.Koch Suspends Park Curfew Following bloody clash in Tompkins Square, Manuel Perez-Rivas, Newsday, August 8, 1988, NEWS; Pg. 5. The local governing body, Manhattan Community Board 3, recommended, and the New York City Parks Department adopted, a 1 a.m. curfew for the previously 24-hour park, in an attempt to bring it under control. On July 31, a protest rally against the curfew saw several clashes between protesters and police. Another rally was held on August 6. Here, the police charged a crowd of protesters, and a riot ensued. Bystanders, activists, police officers, neighborhood residents and journalists were caught up in the violence. Despite a brief lull in the fighting, the melee continued until 6 a.m. the next day. Mayor Ed Koch temporarily rescinded the curfew. The neighborhood, previously divided over how to deal with the park, was unanimous in its condemnation of the heavy-handed actions of the police. Over 100 complaints of police brutality were lodged following the riot. Much blame was laid on poor police handling and the commander of the precinct in charge was deprived of office for a year. In an editorial entitled \\"Yes, a Police Riot\\", The New York Times commended Commissioner Benjamin Ward and the New York City Police Department for their candor in a report that confirmed what ubiquitous media images made clear: the NYPD were responsible for inciting a riot.\\"Yes, a Police Riot\\", editorial of The New York Times, August 26, 1988, Section A; Page 30, Column 1; Editorial Desk Background St. Brigid's Church on Avenue B overlooks Tompkins Square Park. It served as a place for protesters to organize and receive medical attention during the riot. After the Tompkins Square Riot of 1874, the park held a symbolic place in the New York labor movement. In the years leading up to 1988, the East Village -- and Tompkins Square Park in particular -- had become a gathering place and home for the wayward and contingents of the homeless and rowdy youth, growing into a large tent city. Neighborhood residents, voicing their preferences through at least four community organizations, had differing perspectives on the evolving nature of the park, and what actions should or should not be taken. The Avenue A Block Association (made up of local businesses) insisted a curfew be introduced. Other groups such as Friends of Tompkins Square Park and political organizers on the poorer east side of the park preferred that no curfew be imposed, and Manhattan Community Board 3 took the middle ground. On June 28, 1988 the Community Board 3 approved a report that included a proposal for a 1 a.m. curfew. While there was some controversy about how well-informed the voting board members were, board manager Martha Danziger affirmed the validity of the decision. The New York City Parks Department later adopted the curfew. Park workers painted a warning on the ground days after the Association made its decision. On July 11 the police, under the direction of Captain Gerald McNamara of the 9th Precinct, confined homeless people to the park's southeast quadrant, and evicted all others. They closed the park down periodically over the next two weeks. Riot Christodora House, for many the first sign of East Village gentrification, and scene of the riot First signs of trouble Though the park was a de facto homeless shelter, some residents considered the police department's actions an attempt to take the park away from the public. Protests were organized and a rally called for July 31. That night, police entered the park in response to alleged noise complaints, and by the end of the call several civilians and six officers were treated for injuries, and four men were arrested on charges of reckless endangerment and inciting to riot.\\"Residents Clash With the Police In Village Park\\" by Sarah Lyall, The New York Times, August 1, 1988, Section B; Page 3, Column 6; Metropolitan Desk Sarah Lewison, an eyewitness, said the protest was over rumors of a midnight curfew at the park and another witness, John McDermott, said the police provoked the melee. Angry organizers planned another rally for August 6. A rematch: August 6 Flyer for the August 6, 1988 Tompkins Square Park rally. The police were there to meet the protesters. \\"It's time to bring a little law and order back to the park and restore it to the legitimate members of the community,\\" said Captain McNamara. \\"We don't want to get into a situation where we under-police something like this and it turns into a fiasco.\\" The city was on edge and in the midst of this, the park was turned into what Times reporter McFadden described as a bloody \\"war zone.\\"\\"Park Curfew Protest Erupts Into a Battle And 38 Are Injured\\" by Robert McFadden, The New York Times, August 7, 1988, Section B; Page 3, Column 6; Metropolitan Desk Around 11:30 p.m., 150 or 200 (police estimates were 700) protesters came through the St. Mark's Place entrance to the park, holding banners proclaiming \\"Gentrification is Class War\\". By the time dawn broke, 38 people, including reporters and police officers, suffered injuries. In total, nine people were arrested on riot, assault and other charges, and six complaints of police brutality were logged with the Civilian Complaint Review Board. Police actions Allen Ginsberg was an eyewitness to the riots Although bottles reportedly flew, it was the police who charged the crowd. Despite NYPD protestations that their actions were measured, \\"The police panicked and were beating up bystanders who had done nothing wrong and were just observing,\\" said poet Allen Ginsberg, a local resident and witness. Captain McNamara countered, \\"We did everything in our power not to provoke an incident. They didn't charge the crowd until the bricks and bottles started flying.\\" New York Times photographer Angel Franco saw the police beat a couple who emerged from a grocery store; when he tried to take photographs, an officer clubbed him. A New York Daily News reporter, Natalie Byfield, was also clubbed on the head. Both were wearing cards identifying them as the press. Jeff Dean Kuipers, a reporter for Downtown Magazine, was clubbed after an officer told his African- American companion, Tisha Pryor, to \\"move along, you black nigger bitch.\\" Pryor is in tears, with blood running down her neck, in a videotape made by artist Clayton Patterson. Another video made by freelance cameraman Paul Garrin shows officers swinging clubs at him and slamming him against a wall. Photographer John McBride, taking still photos of the riot that were to be published in The Village Voice, was also struck by a policeman's nightstick in the same attack taped by Garrin.The Village Voice, \\"Night Clubbing\\" by C. Carr, August 16, 1988 pg.10 Mr. Fish, a travel promoter out for an evening on the town, attempted to hail a taxi on Avenue A near Sixth Street when he was suddenly struck on the head. \\"I was just standing there watching,\\" he said. \\"The next thing that I remember is seeing the stick, and then a young woman who was helping me.\\" Patterson's videotape showed that no officers helped Fish until an ambulance arrived. A police helicopter hovered over the scene, contributing to a sense of chaos. During a lull in the riot, a young officer on Patterson's video appealed for understanding from the protesters. He tried to calmly tell them how unhappy the police were with the assignment and its aftermath. \\"We've got cops back there in ambulances who've been hit.\\" But the lull ended. Thirty to seventy protesters re-entered the park. A witness said the mob rammed a police barricade through the glass door of the Christodora House, a high-rise luxury building on Avenue B. They overturned planters and tore a lamp out of the wall, threatened residents and staff with bodily harm, and screamed and chanted \\"Die Yuppie Scum\\". At 6 a.m., the last protesters dispersed, vowing to demonstrate again. When questioned about the brutality, Captain McNamara said, \\"It was a hot night. There was a lot of debris being thrown through the air. Obviously tempers flared. But all these allegations will be investigated.\\" Mayor Ed Koch was forced to temporarily revoke the curfew.New York Drops Curfew, The Washington Post, August 9, 1988, First Section, P. A6 Aftermath Eventually the brutality complaints ballooned to over 100.\\"Findings on Tompkins Sq. Prompt 2 Police Supervisors to Lose Posts\\" by Todd S. Purdum, The New York Times, August 25, 1988, Section A; Page 1, Column 2; Metropolitan Desk Video and images of \\"police officers striking demonstrators with nightsticks and kicking other apparently defenseless people while they were lying on the ground\\" were flashed continuously across the media. New York Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward issued a scathing report laying the blame for the riot squarely on the precinct. The police actions were \\"not well planned, staffed, supervised or executed... which culminated in a riot.\\" Ward announced the retirement of Deputy Chief Thomas J. Darcy, who was absent from the scene and derelict in his duties. Deputy Inspector Joseph Wodarski, the senior officer at the scene in Darcy's absence, was not demoted but transferred from his prestigious post as commander of the Midtown South precinct to a \\"less sensitive\\" command. Captain McNamara, the lowest-ranking commander at the scene, was temporarily relieved of his post, but was allowed to resume command of the precinct the next year. Ward said that McNamara's actions were \\"not well planned, staffed, supervised or executed, [but he] acted in good faith and made judgments that were within the level of his experience,\\" after Darcy and Wodarski failed to act. A city review of the riot turned up numerous problems with the police department's actions that night, including a failure to contact either Commissioner Ward or Mayor Koch.\\"NYPD riot action a far cry from glory days\\", John Goldman, Los Angeles Times August 12, 1988 In the middle of the riot the commander left the scene to go to the bathroom at the station house, several blocks away from the fighting. The police helicopter used to illuminate the area only attracted bigger crowds. Several nearby rooftops were not secured by police and were used to throw bottles and debris at people on the street. Ward said the mounted police were brought to the scene too soon and acted too rashly to confront protesters. A temporary headquarters was set up right in the middle of the park, causing officers unfamiliar with the East Village—who rushed to the scene from throughout the city—to push their way through demonstrators to reach it. Once at the headquarters, they found no high-ranking officer on duty. The city's reaction Mayor Ed KochMayor Koch called the park a \\"cesspool\\" where \\"sandboxes are soiled with feces and urine.\\"\\"A Playground 'Derelicts' Can't Enter\\", by Todd Purdum, The New York Times, August 20, 1988, Section 1; Page 31, Column 2; Metropolitan Desk Koch admitted he had not seen the feces and urine himself. \\"There are people, hundreds of them, I'm told, who park there all 24 hours a day, and obviously there are bodily needs.\\" Hundreds of officers were called out on a steamy Saturday for the worst violence the city had seen in years, yet Koch did not know about it until the next day and said he did not speak to Ward about it until Monday.\\"Koch's Verdict: Ward Not Guilty\\" by Richard Levine, The New York Times, August 13, 1988, Section 1; Page 30, Column 1; Metropolitan Desk Ward himself had been the subject of controversy in the past, and the riot became a cause to reflect on the negative aspects of his record as Commissioner. After 10 people were shot in Brooklyn in 1984, nobody could find him for days. He appeared drunk at a Patrolmen's Benevolent Association convention in 1984; under his watch in 1985, officers in Queens used stun guns on suspects and in 1986 officers in Brooklyn stole and sold drugs. He was lambasted in 1987 for telling African American journalists that most crime in New York City was committed by young black men and later told black ministers in reference to that remark, \\"our little secret is out.\\" He told a woman who was scared about a series of rapes that she was the type of woman a rapist would go after. It was noted that Mayor Koch held steadfast in his support of Ward. Although Koch said he was \\"shocked\\" by the videotape of the police response, as he had done in the past he refused to utter a negative word about Ward. \\"The day I think that a commissioner, including a police commissioner, isn't as good as he should be to run whatever he's running, that's the day I will ask him to submit his resignation,\\" said Koch. \\"I think Ben Ward will go down as one of the greatest police commissioners this city has ever had. Bob McGuire is the other, and I appointed both of them.\\" However, Koch's support eroded as evidence mounted that municipal disorganization and a lack of police leadership that night likely sparked the riots. \\"The film that I saw causes me to believe that there may have been an overreaction. I was not happy with what I saw on film. Those films were disturbing to me, and I think they disturbed Ben Ward as well.\\"\\"Koch Changes Tune on Melee\\", Richard Esposito and Clara Hemphill, Newsday, August 10, 1988, NEWS; Pg. 7 Two officers were charged with use of excessive force. Officer Karen Connelly was accused of using her nightstick \\"wrongfully and without just cause\\" to strike a civilian, and Philip O'Reilly, who was accused of interfering with Times photographer Franco, and of using his nightstick to injure Franco's hand.\\"More Officers May Be Facing Charges\\", by Sarah Lyall, The New York Times, August 25, 1988, Section B; Page 6, Column 1; Metropolitan Desk The Civilian Complaint Review Board recommended the officers be charged, and Commissioner Ward endorsed the recommendations. The officers were tried before the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings (OATH); in Police Department v. ÓReilly, OATH recommended that the charges against Philip ÓReilly be dismissed, while in Police Department v. Connelly OATH recommended that Karen Connelly's employment be terminated.Police Department v. O'Reilly, OATH Index No.453/88 (December 20, 1988); Police Department v. Connelly, OATH Index No.454/88 (January 26, 1989). Neighborhood reactions A neighborhood divided over their feelings about police were united against their aggression. \\"The streets were full of people who I see coming out of their houses every morning with briefcases...I mean people who work on Wall Street, and they're standing in the street screaming 'Kill the pigs!'\\" said Phil Van Aver, a member of Manhattan Community Board 3. Board 3 and the nonprofit social service organizations supported the goal of clearing Tompkins Square Park of the drug dealers, drunks, addicts and anti- social elements that considered it home.\\"The Talk of the East Village; A Neighborhood of Vigorous Opinions,\\" by Kirk Johnson, The New York Times, August 13, 1988, Section 1; Page 29, Column 2; Metropolitan Desk Instead, the police riot ripped open old wounds about brutality and the neighborhood's housing problem many longtime residents faced. \\"The police, by acting in the brutal fashion that they did, managed to link a small group of crazies to the legitimate sentiments of opposition to gentrification,\\" said Valerio Orselli, director of the Cooper Square Committee, a nonprofit housing group. \\"Now the issue has become police brutality, not housing. It's set everyone back.\\" Many people relished the neighborhood as a home for society's outcasts. Getrude Briggs, owner of East 7th Street store Books 'n' Things, and a resident of forty-one years: \\"Of course [the East Village] still attracts a lot of freaks, because it's still a place you can be free. For a lot of kids, coming here is a way to get away from the choking atmosphere of suburbia.\\" Thirty-year resident Barbara Shawm protested the East Village's dangerous reputation: \\"A 90-pound woman can easily fend off a down-and-outer or an addict. They're not dangerous. It's more dangerous uptown -- what people do to each other in elevators.\\" Music and the riots Graffiti on a traffic signal box in the East Village advertising riot reunion concerts in 2012According to Times reporter Todd Purdum, the clash had its roots in music. News articles about the riots described some of the music groups who were involved in the melée . The New York Times quoted a handbill for The Backyards, a band looking for a drummer: \\"Must be dedicated, hard-hitting, in it for life. Willing to die naked in an alley for your anti-art. Outcasts and social rejects preferred but not essential.\\" The industrial anarchist Missing Foundation were active in the riots and their logo—an overturned martini glass and \\"1988 - 1933\\"—was found everywhere on the walls of the East Village. The band's singer, Peter Missing, sang through a bullhorn and claimed industrial society was on the verge of collapse and that a police state was imminent. The overturned glass signified the band's slogan \\"the party's over,\\" and the dates an allusion to the year the Nazis took over the Weimar Republic. The riots were commemorated in the song \\"Hold On\\" by Lou Reed. The song appeared on his 1989 CD New York. The song documents the civil and racial unrest going on in many areas of New York City at the time. The chorus of the song ends with the line \\"I'll meet you in Tompkins Square\\" for the first two refrains. The line changes to \\"there's a riot in Tompkins Square\\" on the third refrain. The Bongwater song \\"Folk Song,\\" released on the band's 1991 album The Power of Pussy involves Ann Magnuson trying to persuade an anarchist at the demonstration out of calling for the death of rich men, yuppies, bourgeois Blacks, landlord Jews, bankers, et cetera. The Blues Traveler song \\"Closing Down the Park,\\" released on the band's 1996 Live from the Fall live album, also addresses the riots. It has never been included on any studio album. The Undead (Fronted By Ex-Misfits guitarist Bobby Steele) released the song \\"There's a Riot In Tompkins Square\\" in 1993. The song details Steele's experience during the riots and his opinion on them as well. The song was later re-recorded and released on their album Til Death. The Tompkins Square riots also parallel the riot scene in the Broadway play, Rent, by Jonathan Larson. The main character, Mark Cohen, films the riots which ...[made] the nightly news. Paul Garrin is the real-life person who witnessed the riots, videotaped them as he was being beaten by the police.http://www.thevillager.com/villager_170/freeingthenetthrough.html Rent also takes place in an abandoned lot, located In Alphabet City, where the homeless people have set up a tent city. Riot anniversary concerts On November 7, 2004, about 1,000 people gathered in Tompkins Square Park to attend a concert by the punk band Leftöver Crack. The concert has become a yearly ritual to mark the 1988 riots. According to the NYPD, when officers attempted an arrest for an open container of alcohol, concertgoers \\"surrounded and assaulted\\" the officers. Six arrests were made on charges including assault inciting to riot. \\"It was a confrontation obviously. I don’t know if 'riot' is the right word\\", said Detective Gifford, a Police Department spokesperson. Reportedly, some of the punks spit upon and jumped on officers. Beer bottles were thrown, causing some in the crowd to pour beer over fellow concertgoers.The Villager, Punks clash with police, November 10–16, 2004. On August 6, 2006, a fight broke out in a mosh pit when Leftöver Crack again played the riot anniversary concert.The Villager, Leftöver Crack fires up punks, August 9 August 15, 2006.

During development, the show was initially known as Zoe Bean and was later retitled Zoe... during its second season. The series aired a total of 26 episodes over its two seasons. Characters The series centered on four eccentric high school friends in New York City. The foursome attended (fictional) Fielding-Mellish Prep, which gets its name from Woody Allen's character in the movie Bananas. *Zoe Bean (Selma Blair): A coy, boy-crazy daydreamer. *Duncan Milch (David Moscow): An anxious oddball. A Woody Allen type. *Jack Cooper (Michael Rosenbaum): Handsome, but egotistical and selfish. *Jane Cooper (Azura Skye): Jack's twin sister. Sarcastic and cynical. (Although playing twins, Skye was nine years younger than Rosenbaum in real life.) The show also starred Mary Page Keller as Zoe's single mother Iris during the first season. Scott Foley, fresh from Dawson's Creek, appeared in the pilot with the intention of having him star in the series as Zoe's love interest. But once the pilot finally got picked up, Foley had already moved on to Felicity. Episodes=Series overviewSeason 1 (1999) During the first season, the show centered on the four teenagers as high school students. Jeremy Renner played Jack in the original pilot episode. The first season included guest stars such as Scott Foley as a college boy Zoe had a crush on, Sara Rue as a wheelchair-using bully, Will Friedle as a charming stoner who dated Zoe, and Jacinda Barrett as a girl who liked both Duncan and Jack. The first season theme song was \\"Charmed\\" by My Friend Steve. Season 2 (2000) When the show returned for a second season, it had been heavily retooled. The friendship between the four friends remained intact, but now they were adult college students. Gone was Keller as Zoe's mom, while Omar Gooding joined the cast as the foursome's friend Doug Anderson. The title had also been shortened to simply Zoe... (pronounced on-air as Zoe Dot Dot Dot) out of fear that the former title was turning off potential viewers. After the series was cancelled, Michael Rosenbaum expressed disappointment with the fact that the network had cut his character's name out of the title for the second season.

Life and career Tracy was born Honor Lilbush Wingfield Tracy in 1913 in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, one of four children of a surgeon, Humphrey Wingfield Tracy, and an artist, Chrystabel Miner. After an education at the Grove School, London, and overseas in Dresden and Paris, she worked first as an assistant in a London publishing house and then for Metro- Goldwyn-Meyer's London office. On the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, Tracy joined the Women's Auxiliary Air Force, and worked in its intelligence department until 1941. She was then attached to the Ministry of Information as a specialist on Japan for the remainder of the war. She worked for The Observer newspaper as a columnist and as a long-time foreign correspondent. She wrote also for the Sunday Times and for the British Broadcasting Corporation. After the war, Tracy spent two years in Ireland working for the Irish Digest and for The Bell magazine, alongside her lover Seán Ó Faoláin. In 1947, she went to France and then roamed East Europe for the Observer. In 1948 she went to Japan for eight months and on her return to Ireland wrote Kakemono, an account of her travels there. She was described as \\"a brilliant linguist (she speaks French, German, Russian, Italian and some Japanese)\\", which assisted her greatly in her travel writing. Tracy then became a newspaper correspondent in Dublin. During this period, she was the subject of a lawsuit by Maurice O'Connell, parish priest of Doneraile, Cork, who claimed he had been libelled by a pointed article Tracy had written in the Sunday Times about the new parochial house which he was building. Tracy successfully counter-sued and was awarded £3000 in damages. Tracy is best known as a travel writer. Her novels satirise British-Irish relations and Ireland itself with wit and occasionally bitterness. Her best-known novels are The Straight and Narrow Path (1956), The Quiet End of Evening (1972), and The Ballad of Castle Reef (1979). Her best-known travel book is Winter in Castille (1973). Harold Watts stated that \\"her novels are designed to be read with a glass of sherry in the hand, preferably in the company of persons as basically sensible as the ideal reader of Miss Tracy's work.\\" A convert to Catholicism, she lived for many years in Achill Island, Co. Mayo, Ireland but died in 1989 in a nursing home in Oxford, England. She had been married briefly and divorced and had no children. Betjeman hoax A. N. Wilson's biography of Sir John Betjeman, published in August 2006, included a letter to Tracy which purported to be by Betjeman detailing a previously unknown love affair. They had worked together at the Admiralty during the war. The letter turned out to be a hoax on Wilson, containing an acrostic spelling out an insulting message to him.

It was serialized in Japan by the publishing company Shueisha in the Margaret from 2002 to 2006 and collected in 12 Tankōbon volumes. Story Hiyo Osora failed the entrance exam to the high school she chose, but somehow she receives a strange acceptance letter to SM Academy (Saint Monster Academy) -- which she hadn't even applied to. Thinking that her father, an alumnus of the school, must have sent in a reference letter for her, she decides to go to the school. When she first arrives there, while being distracted by the flowers and green nature around her, two hooded people (Yuki and Jiro) snatch her and bring her to the school president, Kurou Tenma. Fortunately, all that was simply a type of hazing for all new members of the school. She is surprised to find the school crawling with people who are actually monsters in disguise! The next big shock is being told by Kurou himself that she is his fiancée! She is so shocked she faints. She then wakes up and finds out that Kurou has gone as far as having her room connected to his. The only way she can get out is in his arms with his wings or as we discover later on, a trap door down an enormous amount of stairs (since his room is located in a tower). Characters=Main Characters ;Hiyoko Osora :Hiyo Osora is 15 years old and attends SM Academy (Saint Monster Academy). Her genre/type of monster is crow, specifically, a white crow which was considered to be a legend. Despite being a white crow monster, she is actually quite useless, often needing someone else to save her in times of trouble. She is actually only half monster from her father, Shou Hiyo, and half human from her mother, Kyoko Hiyo. Her parents are divorced because of her father's doll face high school appearance, which he can't help, since he's a monster. Hiyo's life is in constant danger because there are dangerous people that are out to get her white feathers. It is said that whoever gets a white crow feather will be granted any wish they desire. The person that usually ends up saving her is Kurou. She secretly harbors feelings for him, but will repeatedly deny that she is his fiancé. Kurou asked Hiyo if he could just call her Hiyo, and she said yes. Later on in the story Hiyo no longer denies her feelings. She adores food, video games, and everything cute. Ironically, she has a fear of heights; she developed the fear because she didn't know she had wings until she went to SM Academy. When Hiyo was still young, a powerful witch erased all her childhood memories, and that is why she doesn't know how to fly until she attends SM Academy. Hiyo also forgot that she was the one who proposed to Kurou although she doesn't remember it due to the witch erasing her memory. Hiyo has many people who adore her and love her, but the only person she truly loves is Kurou. ;Kurou Tenma :Kurou Tenma is 15 years old and attends SM Academy. His genre type is crow, though unlike Hiyo, his wings are a normal black colour. Kurou actually owns a crow named Eigatsu who has been with him since he was little and is friends with Hiyo as well. He is a confident, strong, and at times cocky person. He is regarded as one of the strongest student presidents of all time (the strongest was Hiyo's father). He loves Hiyo very much, and vows to protect her. He is distant with his whole family except his grandfather because when he was young, he failed to grow wings and was abandoned by everyone. When Kurou was 3, he met Hiyo. Due to the fact he couldn't grow wings and the fact his family abandoned him, he had lost all will to live. Hiyo really wanted to befriend Kurou at first, but Kurou was stubborn and rejected the offer, but was later convinced to be her friend when she \\"proposed to him\\" saying she's going be his bride. Later they climbed up a mountain, and when they reached the summit, Hiyo fell off, and Kurou jumped after her to save her and received his wings. After meeting Hiyo and receiving his wings, he regained his will to live, hence Kurou believes that Hiyo saved him. Kurou is the demon king because of his unbelievable strength and power when Kurou gets mad. He can destroy anything he wants and may lose contact with reality. To Kurou, Hiyo is the most important person to him and he would do anything to save her, even risking his own life. Kurou is over protective of Hiyo and can get very jealous. In recent chapters, he wants to become stronger so that he can protect Hiyo. He wanted to protect Hiyo so much that he was willing to destroy mankind so no one would be able to hurt her. But in the end he gave up the idea so he could be with Hiyo and with his family and friends. In the last chapter they finally make love. Also in the first chapter he said Hiyo was his fiancee but she denied, telling her that Hiyo's father agreed to let Kurou marry her, showed her a video and page, but really Hiyo was the one that proposed all along. Kurou also has a sister named Chiya who would like to marry him because she sees the way he treats Hiyo, and the Mrs. Tenmo agrees (and yes, crow siblings can marry each other). That is sorted out but also Maki Tamaki loves Kurou and impersonates Hiyo. The Student Union ;Yamata Ken :Student Union VP. His true form is a snake. Sadly, no matter how hard he tries, he always turns out second-best, losing either to Kurou or the Queen. Yamata constantly begs Kurou to focus on administrative problems, sometimes using it as an excuse to be with Hiyo. Yamata is very handsome if he doesn't wear glasses and if he messes up his hair. He is also in love with Hiyo. Hiyo thinks he's interesting and likes to hang out with him. They love to play video games and watch movies together. ;Issori Usukuchi :Student Union General Secretary, junior high 3rd year. He is an Ittan-momen. ;Makio Kawamura :Student Union accountant, senior high 2nd year. He is a Kappa and thus hates incredibly dry conditions. He is the smartest student in the second year. Fellow Students ;Jiro Gin :Jiro Gin is Kurou's best friend. Kurou first thought that Jiro was a dog at first due to his ears. They were six at the time. Jiro's true form is a wolf. They usually call him Jin. Just like Kurou, Jin's also loves to bully people, especially the smaller ones. However he's also kind hearted and always cheers people up. Jin is simple minded and has known Kurou very well ever since childhood. Jin's also a first year student at SM. Also, whenever he is provoked, or at sometimes lustful, his ears will appear, especially if he's thinking about Hiyo, whom he has a crush on. In an omake, Jin had first met Yuki at his first year at SM. He thought that Yuki was a girl at first and called him his first love. The illusion did not last as Yuki took off his shirt. Jin's father was the vice president of SM's Student Union when Hiyo's dad (rumored to be the strongest president of SM) was studying. He is friends along with Yuki's mother and Hiyo's father. While summer vacation, he admits that Komugi (Hiyo's human friend) is cute and Kurou asks him if he's ever thought of dating her. Then, Gin rescues Komugi from a crumbling building and the two sneak off to the beach together. It is also shown that his mother is Yuki's aunt so she is a fox not a wolf. ;Yuki Snow-White :Yuki is also Kouro's best friend. He is a Northern European Snowman type monster. He's very popular among girls and has been expelled for trying to seduce a teacher. He's calm and just like Jin and Kurou, he's also very powerful. Yuki is often around the main characters and loves to fool around with people. Yuki's mother was the queen of the girl's dorms when she attended SM and is the most beautiful queen in the history of SM. Yuki knows K. Bradford from the main SM campus. Yuki seems to be able to freeze people into ice. K. Bradford hates Yuki because he's been able to impress more girls than K. ;Maki Tamaki :Maki is a cat-girl and at first has a strong liking for Kurou. She is very jealous of Hiyo and extremely stuck up. She can transform into other people. Later she reveals to Hiyoko that she doesn't harbor actual feelings for Kurou. She just likes anyone who is a crow. When she and the other people in the academy find out that Hiyo is the white crow, she declares herself as Hiyoko's best friend. She also asks Hiyo to set her up with Hiyo's father. ;Haitani Tadao :He is Tamaki's slave and she calls him Aichu. He's a mouse and people make fun of him because of that. He seems to have a crush on her. ;Hitomi :She is the Guardian of the girls' dormitory. She was admitted to SM Academy 100 years ago, but never attended school. She refused to leave the female dormitory because the guest room was too comfortable to live in. Only the current and future queen can see her. She likes Hiyo and wants her to play with her forever. She makes a deal with Kurou that if Hiyo says she likes him, she'll let her go, if not, Hiyo will keep her accompanied forever. Hiyo couldn't decide and dashed out of Hitomi's Invincible Guarding Barrier leaving everyone dumbstruck because even the queen couldn't break it yet she did it easily. After that she started to attend school to be close to Hiyo. She seems to be nice only to Hiyo and wants everyone else to respect her, due to her age. She is childish in looks and behavior, such as her collection of stuffed animals or her tea parties. Hitomi, Miyako, and Semu have a connection due to their common interest in each other's stuffed animals. ;Yatsude Keiko :The queen of the female dormitory. She seems to be like an older sister to Hitomi. Other students call her \\"Spider\\" due to her ability to shoot out webs. When we first meet Keiko, she is actually someone else pretending to be her while she was absent. She is very beautiful and captivates many male students of SM Academy. She is also very smart, being one of Yazaki's academic opponents. ;Koma Inukami :Mako's twin. She has light hair and wears her pigtail on the left side. She and her sister tries to get Hiyo's feathers to allow Konta to become an adult. She is a dog kami. ;Mako Inukami :Koma's twin. She has dark hair and wears her pigtail on the right side. She is also a dog spirit and has the same goal as her sister. ;Konta Inari :Koma's and Mako's \\"good friend\\"(slave). He's a fox, but he has self-esteem issues. He was born with a pure fox bloodline, but inherited half of its power. But once he's able to transform he's very strong. When he helps Hiyo escape from the Inukami twins he transforms into his monster form. The Inukami twins are disappointed because his true form is a handsome adult. When Kurou arrives with Yuki and Jin, he kidnaps Hiyo because he loves her and doesn't want to hand her over. He escapes into the mirror, which leads into a dimension where only foxes can enter. He takes Hiyo as his bride because it is tradition that when a fox grows up, he must take his bride to his home. But he transforms back into his child-like form because his soul isn't mature. He becomes a supporting character from then on. He was the one who opened the hole to the mortal world when Hiyo disappeared and allowed Gin to accidentally kidnap Komugi. Tenma Family ;Hayate Tenma :Hayate is Kurou's older brother who wants to get everything that belongs to Kurou because he believes that Kurou must die. Hayate will do anything to get his mother's attention, but because his other brothers outdo him easily he's out of luck. He has a liking for professor Kamako, but he doesn't realize that professor Kamako is a transvestite and no one seems to tell him. ;Chiya Tenma :Chiya Tenma is a stubborn and strong willed crow with black wings. She is a pop idol in the monster world, along with her friend Totoko. It is later revealed that she is Kurou's younger sister whom he was separated from after birth. She goes to school at Hyakki Academy. She and Totoko are friends with Haine. She falls in love with Kurou at first sight and arranges the marriage between her and Kurou with their parents. They broke up eventually because she thinks Kurou is weird for choosing Hiyo over her. She seems jealous of Hiyo's relationship with Kurou at the beginning but after a while she gives up. Chiya has the power to erase memories. Chiya actually likes Haine but Haine thinks she's just his friend. ;Crow King :The grandfather who raised Kurou. He actually raised Hiyo's father as well. When he was young he stood up against Kurou's father and enjoyed raising children. At first he doesn't seem like a great crow, but he is actually very strong. He was the one who trained Kurou and accepted him even when he did not have wings. ;Miyako Tenma :Miyako is known as the Night Priestess, the strongest deity in the East, with the power to see the past and the future of everyone, with the exception of herself, Shou, and Hiyo. She is the wife of Yasha Tenma and the mother of Hayate, Kurou, and Chiya. Because she is worshiped like a god, Miyako is quite often insulting to everyone she doesn't like, including Shou's ex-wife and daughter. She is small in stature, even smaller than Hiyo, and acts very childish in most situations. She is revealed to be the Goddess who created this world. Miyako shows a deep affection for Hiyo's father, Shou, but Shou insists that Miyako sincerely loves Yasha. Her affection for Shou comes from the fact that she can't see his future, indicating that he is stronger than her. She says she has no feelings not even for her husband or children but it is proven wrong for she wanted to kill Hiyo instead of Kurou to save him; she also sent Yasha away to protect him from what would happen. Since the first time she met Yasha she knew she would kill him and tried to distance herself from him but he is the first person that she has met that was not afraid of her. When she tries to kill Kurou after he turned into the Demon King, Yasha stops her and dies. After the new world was created, Miyako and Yasha are reunited. ;Yasha Tenma :Father of Kurou, Hayate and Chiya. Yasha is the elder brother of Shou Osora, but not by blood. He was very close friends with his adoptive brother up until the meeting of the Dark Priestess, Miyako. Yasha fell in love at first sight. Unfortunately, Yasha was rejected by Miyako, because of her feelings towards Shou. However, Shou turned down Miyako because she was childish, but in fact he was also aware of Yasha's strong feelings for her. It seemed that Shou was betraying Yasha more and more. He disapproves of Kurou and Hiyo's \\"engagement\\" and has a deep hatred towards humans, since they killed his mother. Yasha loves Miyako unconditionally, and leaves her when she told him she was tired of him. He was the one who saved Kurou when Miyako was about to kill him, simply because he is his and Miyako's son. He dies at the hand of Miyako like she had foreseen, but is reunited with her in the new world. Other ;Shou Osora :Shou is Hiyo's father and former student body president of SM Academy. Like Kurou, he is a black crow. He is very cheerful and humble, and believes that Hiyo and Kurou should be together, when many believe that they should not. It is revealed by Kurou that Shou was the strongest student body president (stronger than Kurou's father) in his high school years (many claim that he is one of the strongest monsters). In fact, he was so fearful that during his time in the treasure hunt that took place between SM and Hyakki Academy, Hyakki immediately gave up without a fight (he was very polite in asking for the treasure). His high school appearance led to his and Kyoko's divorce, yet he is still in love with her. Kyoko was the reason he did not turn into the Demon King and destroy the world like he had wanted when he was young. He is quite close to Hiyo and is in good terms with Kurou. In the last chapter, he is shown to be 10,000 years old and also has one black and one white wing, something that not even the Miyako could explain, leaving them to believe he is a god. In the new world that Hiyo and Kurou created, he and Kyoko are married and did not divorce. ;Semu :He is the school doctor. He has a bunch of toys who act like servants to him. Although he looks like a cute little boy, every time he sees a girl who he likes, he transforms into an adult. Whenever anyone looks into his eyes when he's in his adult form, they turn into stone. (This can be solved by pouring boiling water on the statue). He is actually the descendant of the legendary Medusa. Semu, Hitomi, and Kurou's mother Miyako all have extensive collections of stuffed toys. ;L Bradford :L is a vampire that transferred in the SM University with his cousins, J and K Bradford. They are looking for the white crow who is actually Hiyoko. In chapter 51, Hiyoko and he fell in a cave then he accidentally sucked her blood, he sucked a lot so Kurou and his friends thought that Hiyoko will be a vampire, Kurou became mad and tore his wings, but Hiyoko still, became a white crow. He falls in love with Hiyoko. Like Haine, L is despised by Kurou and will do anything to keep L away from Hiyoko, which proves to be difficult as Hiyoko offered to let L drink her blood. In recent chapter, he is to succeed the vampire clan, but his grandfather, who is the current leader, did something to him, and in the end of chapter 73, he is shown to have drunk the blood of many girl vampires, and is saying that they will not satisfy him. He says that only his \\"white\\" bride will be able to satisfy him. He is recently shown to be a lot taller and more evil than his other self. It is recently implied that he is the true demon king rather than Kurou. It is seen that A, L's,K's and J's Uncle, absorbed his soul and took L's body [which was A's in the first place, considering L was a clone of A.] He later was able to return to his true self thanks to Hiyoko. ;K Bradford :K is L's cousin, he envies Yuki because all the girls like Yuki better than they do him. He planned to take Hiyo too, but later on, he leaves with J. He has a crush on Kinuko the \\"queen\\" in the girls dorm. In recent chapter, he burst through the window in a conversation between the director of the school and Kurou and Hiyoko. He is injured and begins telling them that something went wrong with L, and that Hiyoko must save L. His mother was a human who got pregnant by a vampire. He worships L because l didn't mind he was from a human mother. ;J Bradford :J is a cousin of L too. He planned to take Hiyoko too, but ends up leaving with K. J became afraid of Kurou after he attempted to fight Kurou, in order to kidnap Hiyoko, and was defeated instantly, with little effort from Kurou. He has a crush on Hitomi, due to her adorable appearance, but is slightly bothered by her age. His mother was a human who got pregnant by a vampire. ;Komugi Taneda :Hiyoko's friend since junior-high. Komugi has had a strong sixth sense since she and Hiyoko were younger (a trait probably inherited from her mother), and when Hiyoko returns to the human world for a while she instantly notices that Haine is not human. After being mistaken for Hiyoko, Gin pulls her through Konta's dimensional rift where she finds out that Hiyoko is half monster and that all monsters aren't evil. When Hiyo and her friends comes for a vacation in the human world, Komugi and Hiyo are trapped inside a barrier Shou has made, and Gin comes to her rescue. She confesses to Gin and says she doesn't care if he is a monster. ;Maboroshidou Haine :Haine is the Student body president of Hyakki Academy. He is a crow with grey wings, this is believed to have happened because he is half-human. He captured Hiyoko in chapter 28 because of the contest (during the annual treasure hunt). He eventually finds out that Hiyoko is really the legendary white crow. Haine at first appears to be lecherous, but he helps Hiyoko and her mother escape from a weird monster. He falls in love with Hiyoko and arranges their marriage, with her mother's approval. However, Hiyoko's father claims that since Kurou's engagement with Hiyoko is still standing it means that Haine's engagement is not legitimate. Haine is also able to cook really well. His personality is rough at first, but, as he begins to fall in-love with Hiyoko, his personality becomes more pleasant which adds humor to many chapters. Though Chiya and Totoko left him to go to SM Academy for a while, they are reunited later. He is seen as a great cook, such as when he cooked for Hiyo and her family during her disappearance from SM Academy. ;Marilyn :Marilyn is as powerful as Miyako, she has the ability to eat a spirit or a soul. She is the equivalent of a Night Priestess in the West. She is the one who turned Kurou into the Demon King. She thought she would be able to control him and create a new world but she was also erased in the end. When Hiyo and Kurou created a new world, she is alive again. Marilyn posed as a maid in the Bradford Vampire Clan but seems to always be in that attire. She is also small in stature such as many other powerful figures in the series. Marilyn has a somehow powerful nature because she helped Kurou turn into the demon king.

DIC works on the principle of interferometry to gain information about the optical path length of the sample, to see otherwise invisible features. A relatively complex optical system produces an image with the object appearing black to white on a grey background. This image is similar to that obtained by phase contrast microscopy but without the bright diffraction halo. The technique was developed by Polish physicist Georges Nomarski in 1952. DIC works by separating a polarized light source into two orthogonally polarized mutually coherent parts which are spatially displaced (sheared) at the sample plane, and recombined before observation. The interference of the two parts at recombination is sensitive to their optical path difference (i.e. the product of refractive index and geometric path length). Adding an adjustable offset phase determining the interference at zero optical path difference in the sample, the contrast is proportional to the path length gradient along the shear direction, giving the appearance of a three-dimensional physical relief corresponding to the variation of optical density of the sample, emphasising lines and edges though not providing a topographically accurate image. The light path 1\\\\. Unpolarised light enters the microscope and is polarised at 45°. :Polarised light is required for the technique to work. 2\\\\. The polarised light enters the first Nomarski-modified Wollaston prism and is separated into two rays polarised at 90° to each other, the sampling and reference rays. :Wollaston prisms are a type of prism made of two layers of a crystalline substance, such as quartz, which, due to the variation of refractive index depending on the polarisation of the light, splits the light according to its polarisation. The Nomarski prism causes the two rays to come to a focal point outside the body of the prism, and so allows greater flexibility when setting up the microscope, as the prism can be actively focused. 3\\\\. The two rays are focused by the condenser for passage through the sample. These two rays are focused so they will pass through two adjacent points in the sample, around 0.2 μm apart. : The sample is effectively illuminated by two coherent light sources, one with 0° polarisation and the other with 90° polarisation. These two illuminations are, however, not quite aligned, with one lying slightly offset with respect to the other. The route of light through a DIC microscope. The two light beams should be parallel between condenser and objective 4\\\\. The rays travel through adjacent areas of the sample, separated by the shear. The separation is normally similar to the resolution of the microscope. They will experience different optical path lengths where the areas differ in refractive index or thickness. This causes a change in phase of one ray relative to the other due to the delay experienced by the wave in the more optically dense material. :The passage of many pairs of rays through pairs of adjacent points in the sample (and their absorbance, refraction and scattering by the sample) means an image of the sample will now be carried by both the 0° and 90° polarised light. These, if looked at individually, would be bright field images of the sample, slightly offset from each other. The light also carries information about the image invisible to the human eye, the phase of the light. This is vital later. The different polarisations prevent interference between these two images at this point. 5\\\\. The rays travel through the objective lens and are focused for the second Nomarski-modified Wollaston prism. 6\\\\. The second prism recombines the two rays into one polarised at 135°. The combination of the rays leads to interference, brightening or darkening the image at that point according to the optical path difference. : This prism overlays the two bright field images and aligns their polarisations so they can interfere. However, the images do not quite line up because of the offset in illumination – this means that instead of interference occurring between 2 rays of light that passed through the same point in the specimen, interference occurs between rays of light that went through adjacent points which therefore have a slightly different phase. Because the difference in phase is due to the difference in optical path length, this recombination of light causes \\"optical differentiation\\" of the optical path length, generating the image seen. Image The process of image production in a DIC microscope The image has the appearance of a three-dimensional object under very oblique illumination, causing strong light and dark shadows on the corresponding faces. The direction of apparent illumination is defined by the orientation of the Wollaston prisms. As explained above, the image is generated from two identical bright field images being overlaid slightly offset from each other (typically around 0.2 μm), and the subsequent interference due to phase difference converting changes in phase (and so optical path length) to a visible change in darkness. This interference may be either constructive or destructive, giving rise to the characteristic appearance of three dimensions. The typical phase difference giving rise to the interference is very small, very rarely being larger than 90° (a quarter of the wavelength). This is due to the similarity of refractive index of most samples and the media they are in: for example, a cell in water only has a refractive index difference of around 0.05. This small phase difference is important for the correct function of DIC, since if the phase difference at the joint between two substances is too large then the phase difference could reach 180° (half a wavelength), resulting in complete destructive interference and an anomalous dark region; if the phase difference reached 360° (a full wavelength), it would produce complete constructive interference, creating an anomalous bright region. The image can be approximated (neglecting refraction and absorption due to the sample and the resolution limit of beam separation) as the differential of optical path length with respect to position across the sample along the shear, and so the differential of the refractive index (optical density) of the sample. DIC images with different offset phases φ0 The contrast can be adjusted using the offset phase, either by translating the objective Nomarski prism, or by a lambda/4 waveplate between polarizer and the condenser Normarski prism (De-Senarmont Compensation). The resulting contrast is going from dark-field for zero phase offset (intensity proportional to the square of the shear differential), to the typical relief seen for phase of ~5–90 degrees, to optical staining at 360 degrees, where the extinguished wavelength shifts with the phase differential.  Applications  Orientation-specific imaging of a transparent cuboid in DIC Partially developed photoresist in Nomarski DIC DIC is used for imaging live and unstained biological samples, such as a smear from a tissue culture or individual water borne single-celled organisms. Its resolution and clarity in conditions such as this are unrivaled among standard optical microscopy techniques. Aluminum–silicon alloying pit made visible by Nomarski DIC Partially etched silicon dioxide in Nomarski DIC One non-biological area where DIC is used is in the analysis of planar silicon semiconductor processing. The thin (typically 100–1000 nm) films in silicon processing are often mostly transparent to visible light (e.g., silicon dioxide, silicon nitride and polycrystalline silicon), and defects in them or contamination lying on top of them become more visible. This also enables the determination of whether a feature is a pit in the substrate material or a blob of foreign material on top. Etched crystalline features gain a particularly striking appearance under DIC. Image quality, when used under suitable conditions, is outstanding in resolution and almost entirely free of artifacts unlike phase contrast. However analysis of DIC images must always take into account the orientation of the Wollaston prisms and the apparent lighting direction, as features parallel to this will not be visible. This is, however, easily overcome by simply rotating the sample and observing changes in the image.

A keen art collector, Graves donated nearly £60,000 towards the development of art galleries in Sheffield, including Sheffield Central Library, the Graves Art Gallery and the Mappin Art Gallery. He also contributed hundreds of pictures from his private collection. Between 1902 and his death in 1945, Graves lived at Riverdale House in the Ranmoor area of Sheffield. Graves donated over £1 million to Sheffield, including the establishment of Sheffield University's Student Union. Part of the Union building is known as the \\"Graves Building\\". He also made gifts of land to the city, including Ecclesall Woods, Tinsley playing fields, Concord Park, Blacka Moor and one of the largest plots of land he donated was named after him, Graves Park.

There are two types of esophageal spasm: *Diffuse or distal esophageal spasm (DES), where there is uncoordinated esophageal contractions *Nutcracker esophagus (NE) also known as hypertensive peristalsis, where the contractions are coordinated but with an excessive amplitude. Both conditions are linked to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). DES and nutcracker esophagus present similarly and can may require esophageal manometry for differentiation. When the coordinated muscle contraction are irregular or uncoordinated, this condition may be called diffuse esophageal spasm. These spasms can prevent food from reaching the stomach where food gets stuck in the esophagus. At other times the coordinated muscle contraction is very powerful, which is called nutcracker esophagus. These contractions move food through the esophagus but can cause severe pain. Signs and symptoms The symptoms may include trouble swallowing, regurgitation, chest pain, heartburn, globus pharyngis (which is a feeling that something is stuck in the throat) or a dry cough. Causes It is not clear what causes esophageal spasms. Sometimes esophageal spasms start when someone eats hot or cold foods or drinks. However, they can also occur without eating or drinking. The increased release of acetylcholine may also be a factor, but the triggering event is not known. Spasms may also be the result of a food intolerance. Diagnosis The diagnosis is generally confirmed by esophageal manometry. DES is present when more than a fifth of swallows results in distal esophageal contractions. NE is present if the average strength of the contractions of the distal esophagus is greater than 180 mmHg but the contraction of the esophagus is otherwise normal. Differential diagnosis Often, symptoms that may suggest esophageal spasm are the result of another condition such as food intolerance, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or achalasia. The symptoms can commonly be mistaken as heart palpitations. Treatment Since esophageal spasms are often associated with other disorders, management in these cases involve attempts to correct the underlying problem. Medications may include use of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and nitrates. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) and sildenafil can be used as alternative treatment options. If caused by food allergy, an elimination diet may be necessary. Procedures If medical therapy fails either botulinum toxin injection or surgical myotomy may be tried in distal esophageal spasms. Epidemiology Distal esophageal spasms are rare.

Using rockets fired on several Israeli towns as a diversion, Hezbollah militants crossed from Lebanon into Israel and ambushed two Israeli Army vehicles, killing three soldiers and capturing two other soldiers. Another five soldiers were killed inside Lebanese territory in a failed rescue attempt. Hezbollah demanded the release of Lebanese prisoners held by Israel in exchange for the release of the captured soldiers. Israel refused and launched a large-scale ground and air campaign across Lebanon in response to the Hezbollah raid. This marked the start of the 2006 Lebanon War. Two years later, on 16 July 2008, the bodies of the two captured soldiers were returned to Israel by Hezbollah in exchange for Samir Kuntar and four Hezbollah prisoners. Hezbollah originally named the cross-border operation \\"Freedom for Samir Al-Quntar and his brothers\\", but eventually shortened it to \\"Operation Truthful Promise\\" (). Background In 2000 Israel suddenly reversed its policy towards Lebanon and after 18 years of occupation it withdrew from the southern part of the country. Hezbollah considered this a great victory. Between 2000–2006 Hezbollah built up an extensive network of advanced and sophisticated underground bunkers and tunnels in Southern Lebanon. It also acquired more advanced guided rockets and missiles during that time from Iran and Syria. According to Hezbollah Israel still occupied Lebanese territory. It did not recognize the \\"blue line\\" drawn by the United Nations. Most importantly it claimed the area of the so-called Shebaa farms which was occupied by Israel in 1967 in the war against Syria but according to Lebanon the area had been Lebanese. Later studies conducted by the United Nations has confirmed that the area in fact was Lebanese. In a landmark prisoner exchange via German mediation in January 2004, 450 Lebanese prisoners held in Israeli jails were exchanged for the bodies of three IDF soldiers in a 2000 raid and a captured IDF colonel. The long-time Lebanese prisoner Samir al-Quntar was excluded from the deal. The government of Israel, however, had agreed to a \\"further arrangement\\", whereby Israel would release Samir al- Quntar if it was supplied with \\"tangible information on the fate of captive navigator Ron Arad\\". According to Harel and Issacharoff the second phase of the prisoner exchange deal was only a \\"legal gimmick\\". Israel was not at all satisfied with the information provided by Hezbollah and refused to release Samir al-Quntar. \\"Cynics may well ask whether it was worth getting entangled in the Second Lebanon War just to keep Kuntar (…) in prison for an extra few years.\\" The intelligence war between Hezbollah and Israel was heating up. Top Hezbollah official Ghaleb Awali was assassinated in a car bomb attack in the Dahiya in Beirut in July 2004. Israel was the main suspect. As Zvi Bar'el commented; \\"Awali's killing sends a new message: Israel can get to Hezbollah anywhere in Lebanon\\". Hezbollah retaliated by letting a sniper in Ayta ash- Sha'b shoot two Israeli soldiers at the Nurit post just across the border. In January 2005 Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah confirmed that \\"all options are open\\" concerning the means to get al-Quntar and the remaining prisoners back. The Lebanese government also demanded that Israel return all Lebanese prisoners and bodies to Lebanon.Makdisi, pp. 18–19 A third issue was Israel's systematic violations of Lebanese territory since its withdrawal in 2000. According to the speaker of the Lebanese parliament, Nabih Berri the Lebanese had violated the Blue Line less than 100 times between 2000 and 2006, while \\"the number of Israeli violations was 11,782 times, by air, sea and land\\" during the same time. On 21 November 2005, in a failed raid, Hezbollah sent in a team of its \\"Special Force\\" fighters using motorcycles and ATVs to either take kill IDF soldiers or capture them alive. The fighters attacked a military outpost in the border village of Ghajar in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, manned by Israeli soldiers. The unit's marksman, 20-year-old Corporal David Markovitch, shot a rocket-propelled grenade being carried by the Hezbollah fighters, killing three, then shot and killed two more. Israel launched airstrikes on Southern Lebanon. During the brief clash, Hezbollah also fired katushya rockets at towns in northern Israel.http://www.newsday.com/news/nationworld/world/ny- woleba224523762nov22,0,2969932.story?coll=ny-worldnews-headlines On 28 May 2006, less than two months before the Lebanon War began, Hezbollah fired rockets into northern Israel in response to the killing in Lebanon of Mahmoud al-Majzoub, a top Palestinian Islamic Jihad leader. Israel retaliated by launching air strikes on Hezbollah bases in Lebanon and firing artillery across the border. The fighting was described as the most intense since the Israeli withdrawal in 2000, though it was over quickly due to a UN-sponsored cease fire. The IDF wanted to an avoid all out war with Hezbollah but was frustrated by the lack of action on the political and diplomatic level. It knew that Hezbollah was not interested in hitting Israeli civilian targets. It adopted a policy of \\"zero targets\\" implying that IDF presence was reduced to a minimum whenever the risk of Hezbollah kidnapping attempts was deemed to be high. Ironically, during alerts, the \\"red zones\\" along the border became off- limit to military personnel but were open to civilian traffic.Harel and Issacharoff, 34 Days p. 14 A few days before the abduction (8 July), Udi Adam, the head of Northern Command, out of uniform even took his wife for a drive in a civilian car in one of the red zones.Harel and Issacharoff, p. 264 (note 8) The head of Northern Command Maj. Gen. Adam warned, only a day before the abduction, in a meeting with Prime Minister Olmert, Defence Minister Peretz Chief-of-Staff Halutz and some generals: \\"We’re on the verge of another crisis on the Lebanese border…It’s a stagnant swamp down there. If we don’t progress on the Shaba’a Farms issue and the Lebanese prisoners, this story will blow up and turn into a catastrophe. \\"Harel and Issacharoff, 34 Days p. 72 In the months leading up to 12 July attack, Brigadier General Ishai Efroni reported seeing increased movement across the border fence, including more armed Hezbollah patrols. He had repeatedly seen burden-laden donkeys, which he had believed were being led by innocent farmers, but after the incident suspected were laden with arms and equipment. After the 28 May rocket attack, the general, who at 41 had spent much of his career along the northern border, \\"got the feeling something had changed big time.\\" Hezbollah had created a deep underground bunker amongst the underbrush, just above the IDF armoured patrol track. The \\"camp was stocked with food, water, radios, ak-47 rifles, antitank missiles and diagrams detailing the insignia and size of Israeli military units.\\" Israeli military intelligence was certain that Hezbollah was planning an attack, and correctly suspected that it would take place at a portion of the border known as Milepost 105, where the road that ran along the border dipped into a wadi, where IDF troops and humvees would be out of sight of nearby IDF observation posts and dug-in tanks, creating a \\"dead zone\\". On 27 June 2006, the IDF issued a high alert at Milepost 105, and stationed a team from the Egoz Reconnaissance Unit in ambush positions to intercept any Hezbollah raid. By 2 July, after no attack had come, the Egoz team withdrew.We Were Caught Unprepared: The 2006 Hezbollah-Israeli War, Matt M Matthews, pg. 33 On the night of 11 July, IDF soldiers noted several reports of contact along the electric fence near Milepost 105, and an Israeli patrol spotted 20 Hezbollah fighters near the location, but this information never filtered down to IDF reserve units due to patrol the area on 12 July.We Were Caught Unprepared: The 2006 Hezbollah-Israeli War, Matt M Matthews, pg. 34 The attack The site of the cross-border raid At around 9:00 a.m. local time (06:00 UTC), on 12 July 2006, Hezbollah initiated diversionary Katyusha rocket and mortar attacks on Israeli military positions and border villages, including Zar'it and Shlomi. Five civilians were wounded Hezbollah Captures Two Israeli SoldiersClashes spread to Lebanon as Hezbollah raids Israel – International Herald Tribuneחדשות nrg – חיזבאללה: חטפנו שני חיילים, שחררו אסירים A ground contingent of Hezbollah fighters crossed the border into northern Israel, and used wire cutters and explosives to break the fence . They hid in ambush in the wadi of Milepost 105. Another squad of Hezbollah fighters positioned itself in thick undergrowth on the Lebanese side of the border. One of the Hezbollah fighters, who was hiding among weeds with an anti-tank missile, was spotted from a nearby IDF observation tower, but the tower was apparently unable to relay this information due to communication problems.Matthews, p. 34 A patrol of two Israeli armored Humvees containing IDF reservist soldiers passed by the spot. The lead Humvee contained four soldiers. The overall commander of the patrol, Ehud Goldwasser, sat in the commander's seat, next to the driver, Razak Muadi, while Eldad Regev and Tomer Weinberg sat in the back. The second Humvee had three soldiers instead of the usual four. Shani Turgeman commanded the Humvee, while Wassim Nazal drove it and combat soldier Eyal Benin sat in the back. As the Israeli Humvees passed, the Hezbollah fighters waited as the convoys drove around the bend and waited until they were completely exposed. As the trailing Humvee passed the highest point and began descending downward, the first Hezbollah squad on the Lebanese side of the border attacked the convoy by launching anti-tank missiles and heavy machine gun fire, which destroyed the second IDF Humvee. Nazal was killed when the Humvee was destroyed by anti-tank fire, while Turgeman and Benin survived the initial volley and were shot dead while attempting to escape from the burning vehicle. The Hezbollah squad on the Israeli side of the border shot two RPGs at the first Humvee from a short range. Goldwasser, Regev, and Weinberg were seriously wounded, while Muadi was slightly wounded. Muadi dragged Weinberg out and they managed to escape the vehicle and hide in nearby bushes. The second Hezbollah squad headed towards the first IDF humvee and kidnapped the critically wounded soldiers Goldwasser and Regev, and escaped back into Lebanon in a waiting car and drove off through olive orchards to the Lebanese border village of Aita al- Shaab.https://www.haaretz.com/1.5003915 Both Goldwasser and Regev died of the injuries sustained in the attack. The entire incident took no more than 10 minutes. At the same time, Hezbollah fighters fired on seven army posts, knocking out surveillance cameras and command communications with the convoy. Twenty minutes passed until First Sergeant Ehud Goldwasser, 30, and Sergeant First Class Eldad Regev, 25, were confirmed to be MIA from the first Humvee. The Hannibal Directive is an IDF order stating that abductions of Israeli soldiers must be prevented by all means, including shooting at or shelling a get-away car, thereby risking the lives of the captives. The Hannibal directive was invoked and this triggered an instant aerial surveillance and airstrikes inside Lebanon to limit Hezbollah's ability to move the soldiers it had seized. \\"If we had found them, we would have hit them, even if it meant killing the soldiers,\\" a senior Israeli official said. Lt. Col. Ishai Efroni, deputy commander of the Baram Brigade, sent a Merkava Mark II tank, an armored personnel carrier and a helicopter in pursuit. Crossing into Lebanon, they headed down a dirt track lined with Lebanese border defenses. However, they veered onto a road near a known Hezbollah outpost along the border. The tank was destroyed by an IED with an estimated 200–300 kilograms of explosives, killing the crew of four. One soldier was killed and two were lightly wounded by mortar fire as they attempted to recover the bodies. Originally Israel assumed that both captives were alive. In the end of July Vice Premier Shimon Peres assured the families of the captured that both were \\"alive and well\\". On 2 August, Israeli special forces raided the Dar al-Hikma hospital in Baalbek in the Bekaa valley, believed to be \\"the place where kidnapped soldiers... were treated after they were abducted\\". The soldiers were not found at the place. The Lebanese minister Ali Hassan Khalil refers in his memoirs to a conversation he had with Hussein al-Khalil, a senior adviser to Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in the beginning of August 2006. al-Khalil told him that the two soldiers both survived the capture but were killed weeks later by Israeli bombardment. There were however no suggestions that Israel deliberately had targeted the two prisoners. According to al-Khalil it was Hezbollah's use of heavy rockets and Israel's response by expanding the area of bombardment that led to the two Israelis' death. The IDF dismissed these claims as \\"blatant fabrications\\" and psychological warfare. An examination of the bodies of Goldwasser and Regev later determined that the two reservists were killed during the initial cross-border attack and not in captivity. Goldwasser was killed after a rocket-propelled grenade on their IDF Hummer vehicle injured him in the chest. Regev was shot in the head, possibly while he was trying to escape.http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/150040 Aftermath A monument in the Adamit Park, in memory of two of the victims in the attack – Eldad Regev and Ehud Goldwasser The IDF confirmed the capture of the two Israeli soldiers on 13 July. They were both reservists on their last day of operational duty. Hezbollah released a statement saying \\"Implementing our promise to free Arab prisoners in Israeli jails, our strugglers have captured two Israeli soldiers in southern Lebanon.\\" Later on, Hassan Nasrallah declared that \\"No military operation will return them…[t]he prisoners will not be returned except through one way: indirect negotiations and a trade of prisoners.\\" The incident prompted the start of the 2006 Lebanon War. Israel responded with airstrikes and artillery shelling of Hezbollah targets, and a naval blockade against Lebanon, followed by a ground invasion. During the war, the Hezbollah commander who organized the raid, Khalid Bazzi, was killed in an Israeli drone strike during the Battle of Bint Jbeil. After 34 days of fighting, a cease-fire came into effect. During the war, Israeli forces took four Hezbollah fighters prisoners, and captured the bodies of ten more. On 6 August the IDF announced one of the Hezbollah participants was captured in a commando operation. On 27 August 2006, Nasrallah denied in an interview with New TV that the capture of the two soldiers was the cause of the war. It only advanced a long planned war for a few months. But he added: \\"If there was even a 1 percent chance that the July 11 capturing operation would have led to a war like the one that happened, would you have done it? I would say no, absolutely not, for humanitarian, moral, social, security, military, and political reasons. […] What happened is not an issue of a reaction to a capturing operation… what happened was already planned for. The fact that it happened in July has averted a situation that would have been a lot worse, had the war been launched in October.\\"Nicholas Noe, Voice of Hezbollah, The Statements of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, Verso, 2007, pp. 394–5 On the other side, however; Israeli P.M. Ehud Olmert testified before the Winograd Commission that he had fully planned for an intensive war upon an abduction as early as March.PM: War planned months in advance – Haaretz Daily Newspaper  Israel News Nasrallah stated on 31 October 2006 that indirect talks with Israel on hostage return had begun.\\"Hezbollah confirms Israel talks\\", BBC News, 1 November 2006 Haaretz reported in March 2007 that Prime Minister Ehud Olmert testified to the Winograd Commission that several meetings regarding Hezbollah were held upon his taking office, and that in response to the likely scenario of soldiers again being abducted, he chose one of several plans of action instead of having to make a snap-judgement if and when such a scenario occurred. On 6 December 2006, a previously classified report released by Israel stated that the two soldiers were seriously wounded during the abduction. On 29 June 2008, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert declared the two captured soldiers dead. On 16 July 2008 Hezbollah swapped the bodies of Ehud and Eldad for Samir Kuntar, four Hezbollah fighters captured during the 2006 Lebanon war, and the bodies of 200 killed PLO and Hezbollah fighters, eight of whom were captured in the 2006 war.

He spent his entire 10-year MLB playing career with the Baltimore Orioles, winning the 1983 World Series. He was primarily a second baseman, but also played third base. Following his career as a player, he spent 19 seasons as an MLB coach for numerous teams, winning the World Series in as the first base coach for the Houston Astros. He was inducted into the Baltimore Orioles Hall of Fame in 2012. Early years Born in San Bernardino, California, Dauer graduated from Colton High School in 1970 and played college baseball for the Indians of San Bernardino Valley College. He transferred to the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, where he was an All-American at third base and helped the Trojans win the College World Series in 1973 and 1974, USC's fifth consecutive title and sixth in seven years. Pro playing career Selected in the first round of the 1974 MLB draft in early June, Dauer was the 24th overall pick and began his pro career in the Single-A South Atlantic League with the Asheville Tourists. He moved up to the Rochester Red Wings of the Triple-A International League late in the 1975 season. The following season with Rochester, Dauer won the league batting title with a .336 average. He was called up by the Orioles that year but struggled, getting only four hits in 39 at bats.Rosenfeld, p. 58 Dauer's struggles continued at the start of 1977, as he had just one hit in his first 41 at bats. He began the year as the Orioles' starting second baseman but soon lost the role to Billy Smith. He credited Brooks Robinson and Lee May with helping him out, saying, \\"You can't make it in the Majors by yourself.\\" By the end of the year, he had regained the second base job from Smith. He batted .243 with 74 hits, 15 doubles, five home runs, and 25 RBI in 96 games while compiling a .982 fielding percentage at second base. Dauer played in the 1979 postseason, and Orioles defeated the California Angels in four games in the best-of-five 1979 American League Championship Series to secure the pennant, Baltimore's first since 1971. In the World Series, the O's built 3-1 lead, but lost the last three games to the Pittsburgh Pirates. He also played in the World Series in 1983, also known as \\"the I-95 Series,\\" won by the Orioles over the Philadelphia Phillies in five games. Dauer holds two American League single season fielding records for a second baseman, including 86 consecutive errorless games and 425 straight errorless chances, both set in 1978. Dauer is one of the few players to have won a College World Series (twice) and an MLB World Series. In 2012, Dauer was inducted into the Baltimore Orioles Hall of Fame, becoming the 12th member of the 1983 championship team to be inducted.

Though a health advocate, Milo was addicted to cigarettes. Later in life, under doctor's orders to give up smoking, the best Milo could do was cut Chesterfield Kings into thirds. He spent even more time servicing the cigarette holder but consumed less nicotine. Milo Milton Hastings (June 28, 1884 – February 25, 1957) was an American inventor, author, and nutritionist. He invented the forced-draft chicken incubator and Weeniwinks, a health-food snack. He wrote about chickens, science fiction, and health, among other things. Some of his writing is available in book form and on Project Gutenberg. Hastings was married twice and had three children.  Writer  Born in Farmington, Atchison County, Kansas, Hastings wrote all his life. His books covered a broad range of topics: chicken husbandry (The Dollar Hen), science fiction (City of Endless Night), nutrition (Physical Culture Cook Book), health (High Blood Pressure). Hastings spent the bulk of his professional life as the food editor for Bernarr Macfadden writing hundreds of columns on food and nutrition for Physical Culture magazine. Hastings contributed several entries to The Olympian System, a four volume set of books published by Macfadden to promote his notions of “developing physical and mental efficiency.” When Macfadden started the New York Graphic newspaper Hastings wrote a series of articles on \\"Food, Health, and Happiness\\". Hastings wrote on other topics as well: commerce (The Egg Trade of the United States), philosophy (an introduction to Brann The Iconoclast), urban planning (promoting the linear city idea of Edgar Chambless), social commentary (the stage play Class of ’29), and an occasional short story (\\"The New Chivalry\\"). Hastings writing was infused with both clarity and wit. Complex ideas became simple. Historical, biblical, and cultural references were frequent. He got interested in many things over a lifetime. Where his interest led, he would learn, then write, and then move on.  Clutch of the War-God  Three of Hastings’ science fiction works are known to survive: In the Clutch of the War-God (1911), The Book of Gud (with Harold Hersey, 1919), and City of Endless Night (1920). There may be others serialized in a Bernarr Macfadden publication, as was the case with Milo’s known works. Clutch of the War-God was serialized in three parts in the July, August, and September 1911 issues of Physical Culture magazine. It was never published in book form. What is known of the origin of Clutch comes from the Sam Moskowitz article “Bernarr Macfadden and His Obsession with Science-Fiction” that appeared in Fantasy Commentator in 1986. Macfadden at the time (1910) was under a suspended jail sentence for an obscenity conviction related to a beauty contest. He commissioned Milo to write a futuristic fiction story promoting his (Macfadden’s) views on physical health and scolding the federal government, hoping to shame officials into granting him a pardon. Macfadden wrote a signed introduction to the story: One of the graphics from \\"Clutch of the War-God\\", Physical Culture magazine, September, 1911. There was a family connectionMary Minerva Wright was married to Hastings' uncle Charles Pardee Butler. to the Wright brothers that got Hastings interested in airplanes. > Foreword: In this strange story of another day, the author has \\"dipped into > the future\\" and viewed with his mind's eye the ultimate effect of America's > self-satisfied complacency, and her persistent refusal to heed the lessons > of Oriental progress. I can safely promise the reader who takes up this > unique recital of the twentieth century warfare, that his interest will be > sustained to the very end by the interesting deductions and the keen insight > into the possibilities of the present trend of international affairs > exhibited by the author. — Bennarr Macfadden. The story is subtitled “The Tale of the Orient’s Invasion of the Occident, as Chronicled in the Humaniculture Society’s ‘History of the Twentieth Century.’” Japan has a superior society and government but suffers from food shortages and excess population. They go to war with the United States successfully invading the central states with airplanes transported across the Pacific on flat-topped ships. Here is an excerpt: > But with all her material glory, there was not strength in the American > sinews, nor endurance in her lungs, nor vigor in the product of her lions. > Her people were herded together in great cities, where they slept in > gigantic apartment houses, like mud swallows in a sand bank. They over-ate > of artificial food that was made in great factories. They over-dressed with > tight-fitting unsanitary clothing made by the sweated labor of the diseased > and destitute. They over-drank of old liquors born of ancient ignorance and > of new concoctions born of prostituted science. They smoked and perfumed and > doped with chemicals and cosmetics — the supposed virtues of which were > blazoned forth on earth and sky day and night. Some predictions in Clutch are remarkably accurate. Modern aircraft carriers are anticipated as is industrial agriculture. As a polemic the story served to further antagonize the government against Macfadden. Milo continued to write for Macfadden for years to come.  The Book of Gud  In 1919, Hastings and Harold Hersey, editor of the pulp The Thrill Book, collaborated on a short science-fiction novel, The Book of Gud, with mutual friend, Billy Rose, previewing (and dismissing) the chapters as they came forth.\\"Looking Backward Into the Future,\\" Harold Hersey, Golden Atom, issue of 1954-55. It was eventually published in Hersey's magazine, Main Street, issue of July 1929, although Hastings' byline was changed to the pseudonym, Dan Spain. The story \\"... deals with a god in whom nobody believed, and of his adventures the day after eternity.\\"  City of Endless Night  The science fiction work for which Hastings is best known is City of Endless Night, a dystopian work. It first appeared as the story \\"Children of Kultur\\" serialized in True Story Magazine in seven installments from May to November, 1919. The word kultur, German for culture, had been made infamous by Allied propaganda in World War I. After Woodrow Wilson’s reelection in 1916 there was a concerted effort on the part of his administration to convince the citizenry to go to war. A Committee on Public Information was established that produced pro-war and anti-German propaganda. There were pamphlets with titles such as “The German Whisper” and “Conquest and Kultur”. There were movies with titles like The Kaiser, the Beast of Berlin and “Wolves of Kultur”.See, for example, First World War.Com. A review of City of Endless Night from the Syracuse Herald, April 17, 1921. The artwork is typical of the pulp media style of the day. \\"Children of Kultur\\" was later revised, retitled City of Endless Night and published by Dodd, Mead and Company, Inc., copyright 1919, 1920. It was reprinted in 1974 by Hyperion Press, Inc. with an introduction by Sam Moskowitz who edited a reprint series of two dozen science fiction classics for Hyperion. Here is an excerpt from his introduction putting the work in its place in the development of science fiction: > Of the pioneering anti-Utopian novels, one of the finest and least known is > City of Endless Night by Milo Hastings, first published in book form by > Dodd, Mead in 1920. This unusual work, filled with uncanny prescience about > impending events, was born out of the experience of World War I and the > impact on Americans of imperial Germany’s statist creed, which believed in > the subjugation of the individual for the sake of the nation. On all counts > of inventiveness, social significance, narrative flow and intrinsic worth, > it ranks with When the Sleeper Wakes by H. G. Wells, Messiah of the Cylinder > by Victor Rousseau and We by Eugene Zimiatin, all written and published > about the same period. City of Endless Night was written as World War I was ending and anticipates the resurgence of Germany and the rise of fascism. City of Endless Night is one of the works cited in an article on “Literary Propheteering” by Murray Teigh Bloom that appeared in the February 1, 1941 Saturday Review of Literature: > Back in 1920 there was another prophet for modern Germany. His name was Milo > M. Hastings and he put his guesses in a fast-paced novel called \\"The City of > Endless Night.\\" The city was Berlin of the year 2041.

Since 1941 the city had held out against the World State (here it is > again) which tried to bomb it into line. Hohenzollerns ruled this tight > world; ruled it with the blessings of \\"autocratic socialism,\\" \\"the perfect > government which we Germans have evolved from proletarian socialism.\\" Other > Hastings bulls'-eyes: o A rigidly controlled press.

Chicken husbandry  Hastings’ interest in chickens began as a teenager on his family’s farm. In college at Kansas State Agricultural College he began their poultry husbandry program.History of the Department of Poultry Husbandry 1900-1960, Kansas State University Press, Manhattan, Kansas, 1962, pp. 3-6, 66 He built a new kind of chicken house based on plans from the Maine Experiment Station. It was a “curtain-front” house, the idea being a big frame covered with heavy white cloth on the south side instead of glass windows. The cloth let the water vapor pass through to keep the house drier, but was as warm as glass. In 1904 while still at Kansas State he began the first official egg laying contest in America.American Poultry History 1823-1973, American Poultry Historical Society, 1974, p.693 It was during his college days he got the idea for the forced-draft chicken incubator. The goal was to incubate eggs in large numbers. Up to that time eggs were incubated by the dozens. Milo’s goal, later appearing on his stationery, was the million egg incubator. The technical problem was the control of heat and humidity. Eggs in the early stages of incubation take in heat. In the later stages they give off heat. Milo’s idea was an incubator with eggs in various stages of incubation with a fan to move the excess heat of the later stages to the earlier stages all while maintaining the proper humidity. He proposed the idea to the Department of Agriculture where he was working after he completed college in 1906. The idea was rejected as impractical. The Department did accept his 1909 patent (Serial No. 911,875) for a cold-storage evaporimeter. Hastings recognized the importance of maintaining proper humidity in the cold storage of eggs. He wrote Circular 149, \\"A Cold-Storage Evaporimeter\\", describing the device and Circular 140 on \\"The Egg Trade of the United States.\\" In 1909 while still working for the Department (he left in 1910) he wrote The Dollar Hen, which became the classic guide to free-range chicken farming. The book was published in 1911 by the National Poultry Publishing Company. It was republished in 2003 by Norton Creek Press and is also available on the Internet through Project Gutenberg. The book is full of practical advice and Hastings’ witticisms: > On the most successful New England poultry farms, warm houses for hens have > been given up. Hens fare better out of doors in Virginia than they do in New > England, but make more profit out of doors anywhere than they will shut up > in houses. If your climate will not permit your hen to live out doors get > out of the climate or get out of the hen business. > > There is, however, a vast difference in the kind of out-of-doors. The > running stream with its fringe of trees, brush and rank growing grass, forms > daylight quarters for the hen par excellence. Rank growing crops, fodder > piled against the fences, a board fence on the north side of the lot, or > little sheds made by propping a platform against a stake, will all help. A > place out of the wind for the hens to dust and sun and be sociable is what > is wanted, and what must be provided, preferably by Nature, if not by Nature > then by the poultryman. Hastings’ serialized portions of The Dollar Hen as “Home Course in Poultry Keeping”. The series was distributed by the American Press Association and appeared in several papers in 1910 and 1911. The Hastings' forced-draft egg hatchery in Muskogee OK built in 1911. It contained 30,000 eggs in 150 square feet, unprecedented for the time. Hastings made three tries at building a large commercial forced-draft chicken incubator. In 1911 he built a 6000 egg incubator in Brooklyn, New York, for a Walter B. Davis. An advertising booklet “Davis Poultry Farm” described operations on the farm. Later in 1911 Hastings went to Muskogee, Oklahoma and built a 30,000 egg incubator in a business arrangement with a Lieber, a local lawyer and business man. In the spring of 1912 Milo went to Petaluma, California, then the chicken capitol of the West, trying to generate interest in a million egg incubator. With interest lacking he then went to Port O’Conner, Texas and built a 150,000 egg incubator with financial support from a local businessman. All these business ventures were undercapitalized and none were a commercial success. While still working on the Brooklyn incubator, Milo filed for a patent, Serial No. 624,885 for “A Hatchery for the Eggs of Domestic Fowl”. (The application was witnessed by Edgar Chambless, Hastings' urban planning mentor.) Supporting documents were filed in July, 1911 and further amended by counsel on May 24, 1912. The patent was rejected, the rejection appealed, and on Dec 30, 1912 the appeal was rejected. The patent application was eventually abandoned. In 1918 a Smith got patent Serial No. 1,262,860 for basically the same invention. The Smith patent was challenged in both the United States and Canada. The matter was in the courts for years. At first the challenges were unsuccessful. Then a new strategy was tried: that the Smith patent was invalid because of Hastings’ prior art. So Hastings had a career as an expert witness. This was the only money he ever made off his incubator invention. The matter wound up in the Supreme Court and was decided in Smith v. Hall, 301 U.S. 216 (1937). The decision, confirming Milo’s prior art, was writing by Justice Harlan Stone, soon to become chief justice. The decision tracks the evolution of Milo’s incubator ideas and his whereabouts. Hastings was also interested in industrializing the raising of chickens. In a Scientific American of September 18, 1915 he detailed how to raise poultry on a manufacturing basis. Hastings’ final major poultry activity was raising chickens at his place in Tarrytown, New York. By 1928 he had 10,000 birds selling the eggs in New York City. Then in 1929 a chicken cholera epidemic wiped the flock out in a matter of weeks. Milo discusses this disease in The Dollar Hen. His discussion of its deadliness is all too prophetic.  Weeniwinks  Hastings’ interest in healthy eating and his proclivity as an inventor lead to his creation of “Weeniwinks” in the early '30s. The idea was to create a processed food as a snack for kids that would be good for them. That meant the ingredients were based on natural grains and no sugar. At the time such a product did not exist. Milo tried many mixtures of ingredients before hitting on a promising combination of wheat and corn. He used his young children and their friends as taste testers. Weeniwinks, Milo Hastings' health food snack The technical problem to be solved in the manufacture of the product was how to cook the ingredients without their sticking to the mold. Milo tried several possibilities and wound up using ordinary cast iron. The development of the product was done in his compound in Tarrytown, New York where a pilot plant was built. For bulk production a factory was built on the family farm in Effingham, Kansas. With the deepening of the Great Depression the monies to continue the venture were not forthcoming and the factory was abandoned. Later in 1938 Hastings tried to promote the idea in Russia.From Hastings' letter to Everett Taft, June 13, 1938. A test-tube filled with Weeniwinks remains in the memorabilia of one of Hastings’ sons.  Urban planning  Another long-time interest of Hastings was urban planning and the linear city of Edgar Chambless. Hastings met Chambless in 1909 and they remained lifelong friends. Hastings lived with Chambless briefly early in their acquaintance and Chambless would entertain Hastings’ children later on. A bird's-eye view of Edgar Chambless' Roadtown from The Independent, 1910, as promoted by Milo Hastings Chambless presented his ideas in his 1910 book Roadtown. Hastings wrote magazine articles based on the same ideas for The Independent (May 5, 1910) and Sunset, The Pacific Monthly (January, 1914). Hastings entered a competition for \\"The Best Solution of the Housing Problem,\\" sponsored by the American Institute of Architects and the Ladies' Home Journal. His entry, \\"A Solution of the Housing Problem in the United States\\", was awarded one of the two top prizes and printed in the Journal of the American Institute of Architects (June, 1919), the Ladies’ Home Journal (January, 1919), and The Joke About Housing.The Joke About Housing., Charles Harris Whitaker, ed. Boston, Marshall Jones Co., 1920, p. vi-vii. The Harvard Design School LibrarySee The George Collins Collection on Linear City Planning: An Inventory in the Harvard Design School Library retains an extensive collection of material about Roadtown. The goal of Roadtown was to reinvent housing according to principles of greater efficiency. The essential idea was a continuous linear house owned by the occupants with farmland on either side and the utilities beneath. Here is an excerpt from Milo’s Sunset article providing some of the details: > In giving Roadtown a hearing remember that it is not a town and not a rural > community. It is both. Compared with our present ideas of either it will > have obvious advantages and obvious shortcomings, but take it as a whole and > compare it with a modern town plus the surrounding farm territory, and then > judge of Roadtown. The Roadtown is a line of city projected through the > country. This line of a city will be in the form of a continuous house. In > the basement of the house are to be placed means of transporting passengers, > freight, parcels and all utilities which can be carried by pipe or wire. The Roadtown idea has a utopian aspect. The drawings and text almost read like science fiction. Chambless acquired rights to some of the patents needed to implement the concept. In particular, Thomas A. Edison contributed his cement pouring patents needed to construct the buildings. Chambless proselytized for his Roadtown concept for decades until the end of his life in 1936. Hastings had by then moved on to other things.  Broadway connection  Poster for the Federal Theatre Project's Los Angeles production of Class of '29 (1936) Though a prolific writer Hastings never learned to touch-type. This led to a never- ending search for typing help. That was how he came to be friends with Billy Rose. Billy Rose is remembered mainly as a Broadway impresario, writer and producer of many shows. He was born William Samuel Rosenberg in 1899. His first claim to fame was as a stenographer. He was trained in Gregg Shorthand by John Robert Gregg himself and at age 16 won a high-speed dictation contest. During World War I he was the chief stenographer for financier Bernard Baruch, head of the War Industries Board. Somewhere Billy Rose and Milo Hastings met and hit it off. On the train between New York and Washington Milo would dictate and Billy would record. In the 1920s Billy began to write songs. Milo thought the songs were good but he needed a stage name and suggested “Billy Rose”. Billy would bring his girlfriends over to Milo’s apartment in New York and ask Milo what he thought. When Billy married Fanny Brice in 1929 Milo and his wife Sybil were wedding guests.These stories of Hastings' personal life are from his son Warren. In the early 1920s Hastings penned The Who-Ams, a comedy-drama, with Leslie Burton Blades. Evidently the play was never produced. A copy exists in the archives of the New York Public Library Performing Arts Theatre. Hastings was also acquainted with Ned Wayburn the head of the Ned Wayburn Studios of Stage Dancing. Family lore holds that much of Wayburn’s 1925 book The Art of Stage Dancing was actually written by Hastings. In 1936, during the Great Depression, Hastings and Orrie Lashin (secretary to Walter Lippmann) wrote the play Class of ’29 under the auspices of the Federal Theatre Project. The play is about the spiritual unrest of college graduates unable to find work during the Depression. Heywood Broun devoted one of his \\"It Seems to Me\\" columns in a March 1936 to accusations that the play was socialist propaganda. The play enjoyed a brief run at the Manhattan Theatre on Broadway in the spring of 1936 and was presented in other US cities.  Family  Milo Hastings with his family in front of their farmhouse 1/2 mile east of Farmington KS, c1891. L-R: father Reverend Zachariah Simpson “Z. S.” Hastings (1838-1925), Otho Ono (1874-1948), Milo Milton (1884-1957), mother Rosetta (Butler) (1844-1934), Edith Elizabeth (1881-1902), Clara Charlotte (1877-1902), Harry Howell (1871-1968). Wiley Warren (1876-1877) and Paul Pardee (1872-1947) are absent. Milo Milton Hastings was the youngest of the seven children of Z. S. and Rosetta (Butler) Hastings. Each of the children had double initials. \\"This happened so with the two first, with the others it was purposed so.\\"Quoted from the Autobiography of Z. S. Hastings (privately published), p. 47. His father was a preacher and farmer in Kansas where the family was raised. Only four of the boys survived to adulthood. Brother Paul P. Hastings became the VP of traffic for the Santa Fe Railroad. Milo's mother's father was Pardee Butler, an abolitionist preacher who came to Kansas before the Civil War and is remembered in Kansas history for being set adrift on the Missouri River for his beliefs.Butler describes his life and times in pre Civil War Kansas in Personal Recollections of Pardee Butler, Rosetta Butler Hastings, Cincinnati, Standard Publishing Company, 1889 After the Civil War the family became involved with the temperance movement and anti-smoking campaigns. Milo rebelled against his family's religious beliefs, although his writing is sprinkled with biblical references. Milo married Beatrice Hill in 1906. They soon separated and were divorced in 1913 after he had his first child by Carmen Horowitz (née Frances Horowitz.) He married a second time in 1916 to Sybil Butler, a first cousin, and had two more children. There are three grandchildren and one great- grandchild. After living many places in his youth, Hastings bought an old quarry in Tarrytown, New York in 1920 and lived there until his death in 1957. The quarry was given to the town of Tarrytown and is now a park. Milo is buried with some of his family in the Pardee Cemetery in Cummings, Atchison County, Kansas.

Horbury went on to study at the Newcastle upon Tyne College of Art, graduating in 1972 with a degree in Industrial Design. Like Smith, he later attended the Royal College of Art in London graduating with a master's degree in automotive design in 1974. Career=Early career Volvo 480 ES Horbury started his career at Chrysler UK and then spent some time at Volvo in the Netherlands, working on the 480ES coupe. He has remarked in the past that the Volvo grill under the bumper of the 480ES was a last minute addition prior to release, when senior Volvo management realised that the car would not have the classic Volvo grille and slanting highlight. Immediately prior to his longer second 'remarkable'Vasilash, Gary S Autofieldguide, \\"Peter Horbury - Changing the Face of Ford\\", 2004, , accessed 1 May 2020 stint at Volvo, Horbury had worked in the United Kingdom for MGA Developments Ltd.

Volvo Cars Volvo ECC Horbury is widely known for leading the revival of the Volvo brand during his eleven years from 1991 as Design Director. Arriving after the 1992 Volvo 850 had been styled, Horbury made an impact with the 1992 Volvo ECC Concept that would influence Volvo design for years to come. He was instrumental in moving the company beyond their traditional boxy look with a new design language for the brand.Motor Trend, \\"People: Peter Horbury – Ford Design Director\\", 3 May 2005, , accessed 1 May 2020Ford Press Release, \\"Ford Names Peter Horbury to Oversee North American Brands\\", 10 Dec 2003, , accessed 1 May 2020 This new look was characterised by distinctive shoulder lines that ran the length of the car, more curved surfaces, rounded noses, and softer, less utilitarian interiors. He contributed to many designs including the Mitsubishi Carisma related 1995 S40 and V40, the sporty 1997 Volvo C70, which was engineered in collaboration with TWR, closely followed by the 1998 S80. He also contributed to the remaining line up with the 2000 V70 station wagon, the 2001 S60, the 2003 XC90 SUV, and the 2004 S40 and V50. He also oversaw the 1998 facelift of the Volvo 850 series which transformed them into the Volvo S70 and V70 series. During this stint he also worked on the 2006 C70, 2006 V70, 2006 S80, with the last Horbury Volvo of this era being the 2006 C30.Weaver, Alistair, Edmunds.com, \\"First Drive: Volvo C30\\", 12 Dec 2006, , accessed 1 May 2020 Ex- Mercedes-Benz designer Steve Mattin assumed the responsibility of Design Director of Volvo in 2005. Ford In 2002, Horbury was made head of all of Ford's Premier Automotive Group design studios which included Jaguar, Land Rover, Aston Martin, and Volvo. With talented designers in charge of each of those brands' design, Horbury had little to do and in January 2004 was promoted to Ford of America as Executive Design Director of all Ford's American brands, reporting to Ford's group vice president of Design, J Mays. Mays explained the decision: 2008 Ford Taurus :\\"We tapped Peter to lead our North American design team for two key reasons: First, he brings to this team nearly three decades of experience as a strong designer and an even better leader. Second, North America remains our most profitable market, and that’s where we need to invest our top design talent. We are more heavily investing in refining the design DNA for this market’s products. So, naturally, I want this team to have even more power to get the job done.\\" Lincoln MKR Horbury ran a staff of 800 including Patrick Schiavone and Moray Callum and was given the task of renewing the design language of all of Ford America's brands in the wake of sliding sales. He was responsible for the implementation of Ford's 'Red, White and Bold' design strategy that aimed to make American Fords more distinctively American in their aesthetic.Ravenscroft, Tom, Dezeen, \\"There is \\"no stopping\\" China's car design industry says Peter Horbury\\", 9 May 2019, , accessed 1 May 2020 This is especially the case with the forthright 'Hi I'm Dave' three bar chrome grilles as illustrated by the 2006 Ford Fusion, 2008 Ford Focus, 2008 Ford Taurus, 2008 Ford Taurus X, 2010 Ford Taurus, and 2010 Ford Fusion – all vehicles designed/facelifted under his supervision. He also oversaw the introduction of a similarly bold frontal treatment to Lincoln as previewed by the 2007 Lincoln MKR concept revealed at the 2007 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, followed by the 2009 Lincoln MKS, 2010 Lincoln MKT, facelifted 2010 Lincoln MKZ, and facelifted 2011 Lincoln MKX. The thinking was to infuse Ford's American brands with a distinctive style in an attempt to make them more appealing to American buyers who are demanding riskier designs that are recognisable from distance.

The next day, they found the boy disemboweled and crucified in a field. Dorothy would spend the rest of her life blocking the Candlemaker in the deepest part of her mind. Kupperburg Run Dorothy's first comic appearance was in Doom Patrol (vol.2) #14, when the Doom Patrol was swallowed by a Chaos Lord named Pythia. This happened near Dorothy's home and when she went to investigate the energy bursts and discovered her favourite super team fighting a monster, she was swallowed by Pythia as well. Inside, she thought she witnessed most of the Doom Patrol killed with the exception of Celsius who used her meditative learnings to keep her focussed on the chaotic illusion and Powergirl who held Arani's (Celsius) hand in the maelstrom, but it was Dorothy who pelted Pythia with rocks, which caused her pain and brought back the dead team to life and destroyed Lord of Chaos Pythia. Dorothy would turn up again in issue 18 for Celsius's funeral. Morrison run Starting with the Grant Morrison run of the Doom Patrol, Dorothy became a member. Her first prominent feature as a member was in issue #25, which dealt with Dorothy's first period and the Materioptikon, an old device used by former JLA villain Doctor Destiny. The device boosted Dorothy's powers and brought back three of her old imaginary friends, Damn All, Darling-Come-Home, and Flying Robert (nightmarish representations of her neglectful and abusive family), whom she killed with an imaginary gun. =The Ant Farm and the Telephone Avatar= During the Men from N.O.W.H.E.R.E. and Pentagon saga, Dorothy was on Danny the Street (a living genderqueer street) with Josh and Flex Mentallo (The Man of Muscle Mystery) when she's kidnapped by the government-run Men from N.O.W.H.E.R.E. and taken to the sub-sub basement of the Pentagon called the Ant Farm. The Ant Farm is a mechanical monstrosity and prison. Strung up alongside kidnapped psychic Wallace Sage, who created Flex, they were going to be used to summon the Telephone Avatar, an all-powerful being made up of telephone parts. In Dorothy's mind, the Candlemaker appeared once more, and promised that if she let him out for good, he would destroy the Men from N.O.W.H.E.R.E. and the Telephone Avatar. Dorothy lapsed, and when she woke up the Candlemaker held true to his promise. =Brief Candles= Following their departure from the Ant Farm, the Candlemaker began to haunt Dorothy's mind trying to get her to let him out. Dorothy confessed to Josh what had been bothering her and about what the Candlemaker had done in the past. She then collapsed from the strain he was putting on her mind, and when Josh tried to find Chief and head of the DP for help, he was shot by him. When Dorothy found Josh's body, the Candlemaker told her that he will bring Josh to life if she lets him out. She did so, and Josh was brought back to life, only to be killed seconds later. The Candlemaker proceeds to behead the Chief and destroy Cliff Steele's human brain to use his artificial body. But Cliff's brain was copied onto a floppy disk and inserted into a blank robot body by Willoughby Kipling, who helped the DP during the \\"Cult of the Unwritten Book\\" saga. Danny the Street takes Cliff, Dorothy, and Willoughby to a burning down and chaotic New York City. Only children, lunatics, and those sensitive to the astral plane can see what the Candlemaker is doing to the city. He is destroying the world's soul, or anima mundi, instead of the world itself. This is causing people to go insane. Kipling uses one of his occult devices, a wind-up toy, to track the Candlemaker down to a skyscraper where people are being thrown out of windows and onto the pavement. They are joined by Crazy Jane and Rebis, two other Doom Patrolers. Jane has multiple personalities, each with a different power, and Rebis is a radioactive hermaphrodite containing a Negative spirit called the Anegima Regis. Rebis has just gone through their reproductive cycle, and Jane's alternate personalities are now powerless. The Candlemaker kills Rebis and tosses Crazy Jane into a vortex to what he calls \\"Hell\\", which turns out to be our world. He follows the Doom Patrol on Danny the Street, while Cliff, enraged at the loss of Jane, continues to try to kill him. The Candlemaker rips him to pieces, right after Danny has taken them to the home of Will Magnus, creator of a superhero team of robots called the Metal Men. Will sends forth one of his new robots, Tungsten, as a diversion. Danny takes them back to the Doom Patrol headquarters and then starts traveling to different places in the world with the Candlemaker still on him as a way to disorient him, but he appears back at headquarters, now on fire and screaming. Dorothy uses a gun on the Candlemaker but to no effect, but at that moment, computer programmed nanomachines that the Chief had created to cover the world, swarm him. He still goes after Dorothy, but she screams \\"Why don't you shut up?! Everyone's sick of you!\\". Now, Kipling comes in, with the egg that Rebis had created, which hatches into Rebis's new body. It attacks the Candlemaker, who is reduced to a single flame that Dorothy puts out. Meanwhile, the nanomachines that the Chief created planned to swarm the world and create a global catastrophe if they weren't stopped. Cliff integrated his brain with Caulder's computer and proceeded to shut them down. Danny then expanded into an entire world, and Cliff, Jane, and Rebis decided to stay there. Dorothy refused though, and asked a red balloon to take her into the real world. Pollack run Dorothy was one of the characters left over from Grant Morrison's run of the series used by Rachel Pollack. =Sliding in the wreckage= After the Doom Patrol disbanded, Dorothy began living by herself in an apartment building, when she began being vexed by African spirits who continually bothered her. These spirits wanted Dorothy to come live in their world, but she refused them because she wanted to live in the real world. One day, longing for the life she had, she had a party with her imaginary friends, including imaginary versions of Cliff, the Chief, and Joshua, when she was again bothered by the spirits. After, she was visited by Will Magnus, who convinced her that she needed to return to the human race instead of locking herself away with her imaginary friends. On a trip to the mall, Dorothy was attacked again, this time being saved by Cliff. Dorothy returned to the DP HQ, where she and Will tried to help Cliff, whose fully robotic brain began to malfunction. At the same time, the Chief's head was being placed in a cryogenic state, but he was simultaneously appearing in a land of shapeshifters called the Teiresias. His arrival in that world began causing fits of craziness and strangeness in the world. This called the attention of a government organization called the Builders, similar in nature to the Men from N.O.W.H.E.R.E.. Seeing the Doom Patrol as the cause of the craziness, they attacked DP HQ. As the Dorothy, Will, and Cliff were being attacked, one of the Teiresias presented Dorothy with a blank, human brain to be given to Cliff. She then re-awakened the Chief, who could now survive as a severed head due to the Teiresias. Dorothy then rejoined the Doom Patrol with Cliff and the Chief after the Builders were taken care of. Moving out of their former headquarters, the three moved to Violet Valley's Rainbow Estates, an unfinished planned community whose construction was halted due to the recession. There, Dorothy discovered a living doll whom she named Charlie, who was made up of a teddy bear's body and a ventriloquist dummy's head. Unfortunately, she began to regress to the same mental state as the beginning of Morrison's run. Arcudi run In Doom Patrol vol. 3 (2001), Dorothy is comatose and on life support. She imagines Robotman, which takes form and leads a new version of the Doom Patrol until the real Robotman discovers him and traces him back to Dorothy. At the end of the series, he consents for Dorothy to be removed from life support.Doom Patrol Vol. 3 #22. DC Comics. DC Rebirth In \\"DC Rebirth\\", Dorothy's history remains intact. Robotman is still affected by Dorothy's death and keeps a picture of her with the Doom Patrol with him.Doom Patrol: Weight of the World #5. DC Comics. Powers and abilities Dorothy's power enables her to bring imaginary beings to life. These beings can survive as long as Dorothy is alive. In one case, a false Cliff Steele disappeared when he realized what he was, though Darling-Come- Home was perfectly aware of her imaginary status and seemed to function fine. These imaginary friends can be good or bad, and don't have to like Dorothy. This power can also bring about beings who were removed from this plane of being such as the Candlemaker. Her imaginary friends The list of her imaginary friends is as follows: * Damn All - Made of a newspaper crossword puzzle and financial reports with multiple eyes and a big smile. * Darling- Come-Home - Wears an apron and has the head of a lightbulb's picture. Damn All's wife. * Flying Robert - A ghost baby balloon thing. Damn All's son. A reference to a poem in Der Struwwelpeter by Heinrich Hoffmann * The Inky Boys - Three people made up of ink. Another reference to Der Struwwelpeter, specifically the poem 'Die Geschichte von den schwarzen Buben' * Pretty Miss Dot - Has lipstick fingers, a helmet over her head covered with lips and curlers, a sweater with a big \\"D\\" on it, and shoes that have skulls stitched into them. * Vegans - Three rhyming girls in tribal masks with deer legs who can-can. * Paddle the Sky - A dark swirling mass of hands with paddles. * Dark as the Morning - A shadowy, eyeless smoke being with a mouth filled with fangs. * Heart-of-Ice - Can make ice. * A false Robotman - Thought he was the real Robotman. * Jolly Hangar - Made up of coat hangers. * A false Joshua Clay - Complete with chest wound and rotting flesh. * A false Niles Caulder * Honey Pie - Made up of a beehive with branches for arms and legs and a honey pot for a head. * Spinner - Spinner was actually a member of the Doom Force, a one- shot special that Grant Morrison wrote which was a cross between the Doom Patrol and X-Force. She appeared in the imaginary version of the Doom Patrol Dorothy summoned to protect her. * Polly Polly Tinker Boy * Cowboy Doll Bookface * Rockabye Baby * Baby Twig Lady * All-The-Time-In-The-World * The Candlemaker - Not actually one of her imaginary friends, but actually has an external existence as an egregore/gestalt being, with a candelabra for a head; it is the world's fear of nuclear holocaust. In other media Dorothy makes a cameo appearance in the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"The Last Patrol!\\" as one of the attractions at a freak show. She is shown on a poster with the word \\"Spinner\\" written across it. Dorothy Spinner is featured in the Doom Patrol television series, where she is portrayed by Abigail Shapiro in the second season and an unknown actress in the first season. In the series, Dorothy is depicted as the daughter of the Chief and a primitive woman named Slava, with her physical appearance resulting from her heritage instead of a facial deformity. Dorothy's connection to the Chief motivates him to cause the tragedies that create the Doom Patrol, hoping to extend his life to protect her. Dorothy later repaired the brick form of Danny the Street and gave it a new form. Her \\"friend\\" the Candlemaker serves as the season's primary antagonist, telling Dorothy to let him out. She is usually able to suppress him, but when Jane's alter \\"Baby Doll\\" kills Dorothhy's imaginary friend Manny she allows the Candlemaker to kill Baby Doll and Flaming Katy (another alter) in retaliation, though she is later guilt ridden over it. The Candlemaker eventually gains access to reality and incapacitates the Doom Patrol. Slava encourages Dorothy to embrace her destiny and face the Candlemaker. The season ends with Dorothy creating a weapon of her own and summoning the Candlemaker, who then drags her away for a showdown. Dorothy's imaginary friends also appear with Darling-Come-Home portrayed by Vanessa Carter and voiced by Kat Cressida, Candlemaker voiced by Lex Lang, and the giant spider Herschel voiced by Brian T. Stevenson. Her other imaginary friend Manny doesn't speak.

The Snow Lion, sometimes also Snowlion (; ), is a celestial animal of Tibet. It is the emblem of Tibet, representing the snowy mountain ranges and glaciers of Tibet, and may also symbolize power and strength, and fearlessness and joy, east and the earth element. It is one of the Four Dignities. It ranges over the mountains, and is commonly pictured as being white with a turquoise mane. In Journey to the West published in 1592, Snow Lion is depicted as one of Yōkais . As national emblem of Tibet The Flag of Tibet, in use between 1912 and 1950. It sports two Snow Lions amongst other elements and still continues to be used by the Tibetan Government-in-Exile, but is outlawed in the People's Republic of China From 1909 until 1959, a single snow lion or a pair of them was used as the national emblem of Tibet on coins, postage stamps, banknotes and the national flag of Tibet. The version shown on right with two Snow Lions was introduced by the 13th Dalai Lama in 1912 based on old military banners, and is still used by the Government of Tibet in Exile. The flag is popular known as the Snow Lion Flag (gangs seng dar cha). In Tibetan culture Snow lion is frequently mentioned in Tibetan folk songs and proverbs. It is thought to live in the highest mountains as it is the \\"king of beasts\\" that would tower over other animals of the lower levels. Snow lions may also represent hermits and yogis who live high up in the mountains. Marpa was called to interpret the meaning when, \\"Tibet's great yogin, Milarepa, once had a prophetic dream which included a snow lion.\\" Snow Lioness milk In Tibetan lore, two Tibetan culture heroes, Gesar and Milarepa, were said to have been raised by snow lioness. The milk of the Snow Lioness (Tibetan: Gangs Sengemo) is reputed to contain special nutrients to heal the body and restore it to harmony. Some holy medicinal remedies are believed to contain the essence of Snow Lioness milk. Her milk is also used to symbolise the Dharma and its purity, as Milarepa replies to a man seeking to buy the Dharma from him with expensive gifts: > \\"I, the snow lioness who stays in snowy solitudes, Have milk which is like > the essential nectar. In the absence of golden cups, I would not pour it in > an ordinary vessel.\\" Legend has it that the lioness produces milk from its paws, and the milk may pass into hollow balls given to the lioness to play with. This ball may be represented in Tibetan art as a three-coloured \\"wheel of joy\\" (dga' 'khyil). Snow Lion Dance Tibetan Snow Lion Dance, Bodhgaya, India A form of lion dance found in the Tibetan areas is called the snow lion dance or '. The name seng ge and its related forms come from Sanskrit siṅha, and cham or garcham is a Buddhist ritual dance. The snow lion dance may be performed as a secular dance, or as a ritual dance performed by bon po monks. This dance may also be found among people in other Himalayan regions such as the Monpa people in Arunachal Pradesh, and in Sikkim where it is called Singhi Chham. In Buddhist art Chinese stone lion at guard the entrance to the Potala Palace The lion was adopted as a symbol of Shakyamuni Buddha in early Buddhism; it is also depicted as a vehicle for a number of Vajrayana deities such as Vaishravana and Manjushri, and the lion throne may be found in many nirmanakaya Buddha forms. The lion in India art is represented in Tibetan Buddhist art as the Snow Lion. The Snow Lion is the protector of Buddha and in paintings and sculpture is usually seen as holding up the Buddha's throne (one on the left and one on the right of the throne.) The throne of a Buddha may also be depicted with eight Snow Lions representing the 8 main Bodhisattvas of Buddha Shakyamuni. The body of the Snow Lion is white while its flowing hair of mane, tail and curls on legs, is either blue or green. While most Snow Lions are gender neutral in Buddhist art there are some that are represented as obviously male and some as obviously female. When represented as a symmetrical pair the male is on the left and the female on the right. Sculptural Snow Lions are often in repousse metal that has been gilt and painted. Attributes The Snow Lion is a tulku or personification of the primordial playfulness of ananda \\"joy, bliss\\" (), comparable to the western unicorn. Though paradoxical, the Snow Lion does not fly but their feet never touch the ground; their existence is a playful continuum () of leaping from mountain peak to mountain peak. The energetic potency (wisdom or shakti) of the Snow Lion is expressed in the attribute of the gankyil or \\"ananda-wheel\\" the Snow Lion keep in eternal play. The gankyil is the principal polyvalent symbol and teaching tool of all the doctrinal trinities of Dzogchen and is the energetic signature of the trikaya. The gankyil is the inner wheel of the Dharmacakra of the Ashtamangala path of Vajrayana Buddhism. Roar The roar of the Snow Lion embodies the sound of 'emptiness' (Sanskrit: Śūnyatā), courage and truth, and because of this is often a synonym for the Buddhadharma, the Buddha’s teachings, as it implies freedom from karma and the challenging call to awakening. It was considered to be so powerful that just a single roar could cause seven dragons to fall from the sky. Tibetan Lion Dog The Lhasa Apso is also called the Tibetan Lion Dog due to its resemblance to the Snow Lion. However it is unknown whether the dog was bred to resemble the Snow Lion or if the artistic design was influenced by the features of the dog.

The site is a ruined iron works, which mainly produced agricultural edge-tools that were exported all over the world, and is now, in addition to its unique and major importance in relation to industrial archaeology, used as a breeding site by horseshoe bats. The block of buildings adjacent to the entrance is listed Grade II* and most of the rest of the site is a Scheduled Ancient Monument. It is included in the Heritage at Risk Register produced by English Heritage.  Biological interest  The site is used by both Greater and Lesser Horseshoe Bats. The roofspace of one of the former works building was used, before the building burnt down in the 1980s, as a breeding roost in summer by large numbers of Greater Horseshoes and smaller numbers of Lesser Horseshoes. Disused flues and tunnels in a low cliff are used for hibernation.  History  It is likely that there was some form of foundry on or near the site since about 1500 when Mells seems to have been known as Iron Burgh. (The source for this statement is not given in Toulson's book but it may be derived from a reference to a place immediately south-east of nearby Leigh-on-Mendip named as Irenborgh in a document dated 1515) There are further documentary records which indicate that iron working had been undertaken locally since at least the early 13th century. The land on which the Lower Works were built was leased by John Horner (an alleged descendant of Little Jack Horner) to James Fussell III of Stoke Lane, on 25 December 1744, to erect \\"a good, firme and substantiall Mill or Mills for Grinding Edge Tools and forging Iron plates\\". His son, James Fussell IV further developed the business. At one time it employed 250 people on this site and continued for many years, with various members of the Fussell family operating a total of six sites in the local area: the Upper Works further up the Wadbury Valley, the Great Elm Edge-Tool Works, the Chantry Works, the Railford Works and a small site at Gurney Slade.Industrial archaeology - Fussell's iron works, British Geological Survey. Retrieved 8 February 2010. Tools produced by Fussells were exported to Europe and America, and the family expanded its activities to include coal mining and banking, with the business issuing its own banknotes at one stage. The business declined towards the end of the 19th century, due in part to a failure to convert from water to steam power until a late stage, and also to the collapse of English agriculture in the 1870s. By 1895 production had ceased, and the company folded in 1900. Many of the old photographs, diagrams, plans and tools are now exhibited at Frome Museum.

It is closely related to the Scottish game of shinty and is similar to the Irish game of hurling.

Formerly the Manx national game, but now superseded by football..\\" though it has experienced a revival in the 21st century. Equipment involves a stick (, meaning \\"little curved thing\\") and a ball (crick or crig) with anything between four and two hundred players. Sometimes whole towns and villages took part, or even played each other. The camman can be any stick with a bent end, and is similar in design to the caman in shinty, both unlike the Irish camán, having no blade. A gorse wood camman, if of suitable size and shape, was a very much treasured possession. The crick can be made from cork or wood, and varied from circular to egg-shaped, sized from approximately two inches in circumference to 'the size of a fist'. Old accounts tell that the crick was sometimes covered in cloth or leather.Mannin vol 8 pp486/488 Folk Lore Notes 1916 The Manx word Cammag, as in modern Scottish Gaelic and Irish camán, is derived from the Gaelic root word cam, meaning bent.Broderick, G.

Corris's Close (now Athol Street) was the chief playing-ground in the town of Peel. In modern times, an annual match of cammag is played in St John's. There is evidence to show that Cammag had strong links to Welsh Bundy, there are records in Wales that teams would have been games played all over the place with 20-30 men a side and played on a pitch 200 metres long. Once a year there would have been the very biggest games with hundreds of men to a team and numbers would not have been counted but more of a free for all.

The earliest written record of the game dates to 1760, when three men and a boy were brought before the church court for playing cammag on a Sunday.http://www.isleofman.com/lifestyle/health-sports/cammag/ An open Cammag match is played on Boxing Day/Hunt the Wren Day (26 December) on the Tynwald field at St John's. Matches are held between the North and the South of the island. Research by David Fisher in the archives of Manx National Heritage clarified that the Northern line historically ran from the Grand Island Hotel to Niarbyl, south of Peel. The game usually starts at 2 p.m., and is played over three 20-minute periods. Teams are informal and unregulated, often numbering more than 50 people (both males and females) on the field - historic commentary cites matches played with anywhere between four and two hundred players.Gawne, Kit Isle of Man Hockey (2010) In recent years, the match has been refereed by local radio presenter John Kaneen who revived the game in recent years. Playing equipment is supposed to consist of a bent stick, though there are many variations on the design. The game is a physically demanding contact sport, and protective equipment is advised. The game usually revolves around a central pack, where a large number of players are confined in a small space, and the ball cannot move large distances. Breakout attacks down the open wings occasionally take place, though the large number of players in the centre of the field makes it difficult to attack the staked-out goals from outside positions. The 2005 St John's match resulted in a 4-2 win for the North, despite being heavily outnumbered by a Southern side that included Peel for the second time. The North managed to control the game by holding the ball in the centre pack (where a relatively small number of players have access to the ball), and playing a solid defensive game. Scorers for the North were David Fisher(2), Ean Radcliffe and Roy Kennaugh. The 2006 St John's match resulted in a 4-4 draw, the North coming back from a 4-2 deficit at the end of the second period to draw the match level. Referee John Kaneen decided that the South should hold the cup until the 2007 match. The 2007 match resulted in a 5-1 win for the South. The 2008 match resulted in a 5-4 win for the North. The North closed a 4-1 deficit in the final third of the match to draw level at full-time, then scored in the sudden death period to win the match. Scorers for the North included Ean Radcliffe (pushover goal), Rob Teare, Paul Rogers and Jole Fisher (2 goals). The 2009 Cammag match in St John's The 2009 match resulted in a 4-3 win for the North. The South led by 2-0 at the end of the first period, but failed to hold on to their lead. At the end of the final period, the match was drawn at 3-3, and went to extra time. The North scored to win the match 4-3. The match was an intensely physical game that included many ground mauls. The 2010 match resulted in a 3-2 win for the South. The game was refereed by David Fisher, John Kaneen and Stewart Bennett. The match was dominated by a much larger southern side, including four goalkeepers at one point, but the North held on for a 2-2 draw at the end of the third half. Scorers for the North were Jole Fisher and Ean Radcliffe, whilst well known player John \\"Dog\\" Collister kept goal. The match went to sudden death, which was won by the South who massed for a pushover goal. The 2011 match resulted in a 3-0 win for the South. The southern side held the majority of possession, and the South's much larger numbers meant that the northern side was on the defensive for much of the match.Manx Independent, Newspaper, 31 December 2010 The 2012 match was a landslide 9-4 victory for the North, the largest score in recent memory. Heavy rain meant challenging conditions, but the sides were evenly matched for most of the game and until the third half, the score remained at 4-4. The North secured victory with a 5-goal streak in the last half for a convincing win. Scorers for the North included Oli Trainor and Ean Radcliffe (3). The 2013 match was once again mired in controversy as scoring was disputed, a common thing in Cammag matches - although the South put three goals over the line to the North's two, referee Paul Callister ruled that it was unclear whether an early goal for the South should have been allowed due to being too high over the keeper, and that a late goal for the South had been kicked over the line, which would be disqualified as all scoring has to be with the stick. Scorers for the North were John Faragher and Ean Radcliffe, in the face of superb goalkeeping from the South which denied the North another overwhelming victory. After the one-sided victory by the North in the 2012 match, it was decided that the South should hold the cup for the year. The 2015 match resulted in a 7-1 victory for the North. The number of players was much reduced due to heavy rain, though the sides were relatively even in numbers for the first time in many years. The skillful North led from early in the match, with the South scoring a consolation goal late in the third half. Scorers for the North included David Fisher, who was also refereeing the match. The 2017 match resulted in a 6-1 win by a dominant North, despite superb goalkeeping from Southern keeper Ryan Davies, who was awarded the \\"Man of the Match\\" award. The match was the swansong of popular North player and great Manxman Roy Kennaugh, who died on 27 December 2017.Manx Radio \\"Loss of a Great Manxman\\", Manx Radio, Isle of Man, 29 December 2017.

It was expected that a league of 7 teams would have been created, with the first game expected to have taken place on 5 July 2015. However, the expected association did not materialise, and no league was ever set up. Cammag remains without a governing body, and without a formal set of rules.

It was released only in Japan in 1998. Gameplay In- game screenshot Super Robot Spirits is a 3D fighting game that pits players in one-on-one battles against mecha from select Japanese anime series. The plot involves an ongoing war throughout the universe between humans and a fleet of robots named the \\"Aerogater\\". To stop the Aerogater from destroying Earth, robots from other dimensions are transported to Earth to destroy them once and for all. Spirits includes seven playable characters from the start: Shining Gundam from Mobile Fighter G Gundam, Daitarn from Invincible Steel Man Daitarn 3, Dunbine from Aura Battler Dunbine, Voltes V from Chōdenji Machine Voltes V, Walker Xabungle from Combat Mecha Xabungle, Dancouga from Dancouga – Super Beast Machine God, and R-1, a robot created by Banpresto specifically for this game. There are three unlockable characters as well that are playable once certain conditions are met. The game is presented from a 2.5D perspective; while the characters and environments are rendered in 3D, the gameplay takes place on a 2D plane. Each character is able to kick, punch, block incoming attacks, and use weapons such as turret guns and energy swords. In each battle, which are made to represent anime episodes, the player must defeat their opponent by depleting their health. Hitting opponents provides the player with \\"spirit skills\\", which fill up an orange gauge underneath their health bar. Spirit skills are used to unleash a powerful super attack, which can't be deflected by opponents. Super attacks differ for each character, and are stronger depending on how many spirit skills the player possesses, and are different for each character. The player can also combine their weapons with an attack to cause a different super attack to unfold, which varies depending on the character selected. Reception Super Robot Spirits received largely mediocre reviews from publications. It struggled to gain sales; according to Famitsu, it only sold around 9,000 copies total. Spirits sold significantly less than the other Super Robot game on the console, Super Robot Wars 64, which sold over 100,000 copies total. The game's graphics were met with mixed reactions. Martin Kitts of N64 Magazine was particularly critical of the backdrops, which he stated were poorly-drawn and created a bad contrast with the character models. Kitts also criticized the graphical effects for being poorly-designed, using the ghosting effects with the special moves and the feet of the player's robot disappearing underwater as examples. The staff at Gamers' Republic felt that the graphics were of decent quality, as were the character animations. Disagreeing with both publications was Tobias Partetzke of Total! Germany, who believed that the visuals were mediocre at best and the animations were stiff and awkward. Publications believed that the beginning of Super Robot Spirits had a good presentation. Kitts labeled its opening animation as \\"stylish\\", and one that was close to impressing its players upon boot-up. Ultra 64s Eric commented that the game presents itself a nice atmosphere. Most critics disliked Super Robot Spirits for its gameplay. Eric felt that it was lacking in design and omits what he considered to be basic mechanics for any fighting game, such as a large amount of movesets for each character. Tobias, whose review of the game was largely scathing, claimed the gameplay was so awful that he wouldn't have been surprised if Banpresto did it on purpose, in an ironic attempt to make the Nintendo 64's worst fighting game. On the contrary, Gamer's Republic believed that Super Robot Spirits posed the best fighting game engine on the console, finding it superior than Konami's Rakugakids. While they disliked the playing arenas for being bland and uninspired, they enjoyed the character movesets and powerful super attacks. The controls themselves were criticized for their simplicity, which Kitts claimed was a pointless decision due to how few moves the characters actually possessed. The game's story mode and multiplayer were praised and seen as the highlights of the game. Overall, critics stated that Super Robot Spirits was a poorly-designed fighting game that was clearly rushed to market in hopes to capitalize on the properties used. Kitts described it as being \\"a crushing disappointment for fans of the cartoons\\", a waste of so many beloved licenses, and an average-at-best fighter for the platform. Eric agreed with his statement and further added that it would serve as nothing but a disappointment for fans. Tobias likened the game to Hudson's Dual Heroes, another poorly-received fighter for the Nintendo 64. He believed that Spirits felt like more like an unfinished prototype than a completed product, concluding his review with: \\"Be glad that this terrible trash has not been announced for Germany!\\" NotesReferences 1998 video games Banpresto games Japan-exclusive video games Nintendo 64 games Nintendo 64-only games Super Robot Wars Versus fighting games Video games developed in Japan ","title":"Super Robot Spirits"},{"id":"6299440","title":"Roger Goodell"},{"id":"6299451","text":"Aage Bergishagen Dons (19 August 1903 – 20 October 1993) was a Danish author.

William Beardmore, 1st Baron Invernairn DL (16 October 1856 – 9 April 1936), known as Sir William Beardmore, Bt, between 1914 and 1921, was a British industrialist, founding the eponymous William Beardmore and Company. Background and education Beardmore was born in Deptford, London, where his father, also William Beardmore, was a mechanical engineer. In 1861 his family moved to Glasgow, where his father was co-founder of the Parkhead Forge, a steel mill and supplier to the thriving shipbuilding and railway industries on the Clyde in the east end of the city. He was educated at the High School of Glasgow and Ayr Academy. When he was fifteen, he began an apprenticeship at Parkhead, while taking night classes at Anderson's University. On completing his apprenticeship in 1877 he enrolled at the Royal School of Mines in South Kensington, London. Business career Beardmore's father died shortly afterwards and the retirement of the third business partner saw William's uncle Isaac become sole proprietor. William became a junior partner in 1879 and on his uncle's retirement seven years later he became the sole proprietor of the business. He rapidly expanded the business and formed it into the limited company of William Beardmore & Company, of which he became chairman and managing director, in 1902. In 1899, he bought the world-famous yard of Robert Napier and Sons at Govan, on the Clyde. In 1900 he became chairman of J. I. Thornycroft & Co, the torpedo boat builders. In 1902 he also became a shareholder and director of the armaments firm Vickers and the motor manufacturers Arrol-Johnston. Over the years he diversified his business to include the production of vehicles, armaments, including shells and tanks, aircraft, airships and motorcycles. The original forge business continued to produce a wide array of steel materials, including armour plate, castings, axles, railway equipment, boiler plate and wheels. In 1900, he purchased land on the north bank of the Clyde at Dalmuir, adjacent to the famous yard of John Brown & Company at Clydebank. This he developed into one of the largest and most modern shipyards in the world, but the post-war decline in shipbuilding saw this yard close in 1936. Amongst ships built by Beardmore were the SS Warilda, later the HMAT Warilda, for the Adelaide Steamship Company, the dreadnought HMS Conqueror, the battleship HMS Ramillies, and the first through-deck aircraft carrier . Beardmore sponsored Ernest Shackleton's 1907 Antarctic expedition, and it named the Beardmore Glacier after him. He was a member of the Royal Institution of Naval Architects, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, the Iron and Steel Institute, and the Institution of Shipbuilders and Engineers in Scotland. He was also chairman of the Industrial Welfare Society. In 1918 he was awarded the Bessemer Gold Medal of the Iron and Steel Institute for his sevices to the industry. Beardmore was created a Baronet, of Flichity in the County of Inverness, in 1914 and raised to the peerage as Baron Invernairn, of Strathnairn in the County of Inverness, in the 1921 New Year Honours. Personal life Lord Invernairn died at his home in Strathnairn, Inverness- shire of heart failure on 9 April 1936, aged 79. The baronetcy and barony died with him, but it was thought he fathered an illegitimate heir William, who has living descendants in the United Kingdom.  References  * Michael S.

Education, transport, and economy Greens Farms is the home to a private coeducational K-12 institution that bears its namesake: Greens Farms Academy. The Green's Farms Railroad Station is located on New Creek Road. Exit 18 of Interstate 95 serves the neighborhood. Sherwood Island State Park is at the western edge of Greens Farms. The Nyala Farms Corporate Center, north of Sherwood Island, is home to Terex Corporation, a Fortune 500 company, and Pequot Capital Management, a large hedge fund. Green's Farms Elementary School serves students in kindergarten through Grade 5 in a Gothic-style building with a newer wing on the back containing a library-media center, computer lab and gymnasium. Etymology The land holdings of John Green, one of the first five settlers, known collectively as the Bankside Farmers, were known as Green's Farm by 1699. In 1732 the area was officially renamed Green's Farms. Within the area of Greens Farms is Frost Point named after one of the other Bankside Farmers Daniel Frost. Greens Farms is also spelled in its original form, Green's Farms. The First Congregational Church of Green's Farms, Green's Farms Railroad Station, The New York Times and the Green's Farms Association all use the apostrophe in the neighborhood name, which is used about half of the time. The Town of Westport, Connecticut state government and local newspapers do not. History In 1648 the Town of Fairfield officially gave five farmers, collectively known as the Bankside Farmers, permission to settle the fertile land that the Pequot people were living in. The Bankside Farmers purchased the land from the Pequot who called it Machamux (\\"beautiful land\\"). The land that the Pequot sold, then within the original boundaries of the Town of Fairfield, stretched from \\"Frost Point an English mile along the seacoast toward Compaw, and six or seven miles inland.\\" The Pequot moved to an area \\"elevated back east of this strip\\".'' The first three settlers were Thomas Newton, Henry Gray and John Green. Daniel Frost and Francis Andrews later joined the Bankside Farmers making five in total. They lived at the western end of what is now Beachside Avenue. Web page titled \\"Colonial Green's Farms\\" at the Friends of Sherwood Island State Park Web site, accessed November 18, 2007 On Green's Farms Road near Morningside Drive is the site of the first West Parish Common, the first schoolhouse, and the first meeting house. A small park is now there with a monument called Machamux Boulder. Over the next 50 years, more land was bought from the Indians and the community grew. In 1711 the \\"West Parish of Fairfield\\" was established with church and civil functions. In 1732, the area was renamed \\"Green's Farms\\" in honor of John Green, one of the original five Bankside Farmers. During the American Revolution, British soldiers burned down the Meeting House in a raid that also destroyed 15 houses and 11 barns. The only church property saved was the communion service that Deacon Ebenezer Jesup rescued by hiding it in his well. For the next 10 years, members of the church met in private homes. In 1789 a new church building was erected at the church's current site at Hillandale Road. To raise money, pews were auctioned off. That building was replaced and, in April 1852, a fire forced another replacement the next year. Web page titled \\"The Congregational Church of Green's Farms / History of Green's Farms Congregational Church, accessed November 18, 2007 Burial Hill Beach was acquired by the Town of Westport in 1893. In 1950, strong winds toppled the Congregational Church steeple, sending it through the roof of the Sunday School room, now the church parlor. The repair effort was expanded to include lighting for the steeple and a new Sunday School room which would double as a church social hall and the construction of a Sunday School wing. In 1961, the present social hall was added, together with more classrooms, a church office, ministers' offices and a choir room.

He was traded by the Indians to the Blue Jays for designated hitter Rico Carty, and reacquired in the same off-season for utility infielder Héctor Torres. As a member of the Indians, he famously proclaimed himself President and General Manager of the John Lowenstein Apathy Club, since no Indians follower had ever started a John Lowenstein Fan Club during his tenure with the team. In 1980, after being hit in the back of the neck on the basepaths with a thrown ball, Lowenstein was taken off the field on a stretcher.

After an exchange of hostages, the ruling king, Nzinga a Nkuwu agreed to allow missionaries to come to his country and to learn more about Christianity. The missionaries arrived early in 1491, and baptized the provincial ruler of Soyo whose lands were located on the Atlantic coast, before moving to the royal capital in April and May. According to Portuguese accounts, Nzinga a Nkuwu was further convinced to the Christian message when he witnessed what he and the priests both regarded as a miracle: two of the king's subjects dreamed simultaneously of beautiful woman who urged the king to be baptized, and a third one reported finding a cross shaped stone near a riverbed (normally considered a particularly auspicious spot in Kongo cosmology). Nzinga a Nkuwu was baptized on 3 May 1491, taking the name João in honor of the Portuguese king (João II) as were many of his officials and nobles and, after some hesitation, the women of the royal and allied households. Further missionaries arrived at the court of Nzinga a Nkuwu, and a good number also accompanied his son Afonso Mvemba a Nzinga to his provincial post of Nsundi. Afonso, in turn became a great champion of the faith, even though, according to Afonso's subsequent account of the events, his father cooled in the faith, and many of the Kongolese who had been baptized turned away. Reign of King Afonso The capital of the Kongo Empire, São Salvador Afonso, whose letters are virtually our only source for the following events of his reign, presented himself to the world as a fervent Catholic, anxious to spread the faith, and also as having suffered persecution for it during the last years of his father's reign. When João died, probably in late 1508 or 1509, Afonso's half brother Mpanzu a Kitima, one of the lapsed Christians and a powerful rival, challenged the prince for the throne. But Afonso was able to overcome his brother in battle, thanks to having already positioned himself in the capital São Salvador and, according to Afonso's account the supernatural appearance of Saint James the Great in the sky, frightening his enemies. In subsequent correspondence with Portugal, Afonso decided to create a coat of arms in which five armed hands, each bearing a sword, was the principal element, along with a broken idol figured prominently. This coat of arms, first described in 1512, became one of Kongo's central icons, while Saint James Major's feast day became Kongo most important holiday, simultaneously honoring the saint who was popular in Iberian armies as a crusading saint, and King Afonso and his miracle. Having become king, Afonso set about establishing a church. In letters to Portugal, he described some of the steps: he declared it illegal for people to worship idols, he destroyed a \\"house of idols\\" located in the capital (against the threat of a revolt), he also provided for a tithe to support it financially. Tradition from the late 17th century onward regarded Afonso as the founder of the church, and also attributes the story that he buried his own mother alive \\"for the sake of the Savior King\\" when she refused to take off a small idol she wore around her neck. Afonso's work to establish the church won him wide praise outside of Africa, and the Portuguese historian João de Barros called him the \\"Apostle of Congo\\" in 1552. Afonso also worked to create a specifically local interpretation of Christianity, although the details are not well known. He worked with a number of Portuguese priests, most notably Rui d'Aguiar who came in 1516, and also with Kongolese who were educated in Europe, principally his son Henrique Kinu a Mvemba, who was elevated to the status of bishop in 1518, and who worked in Kongo from 1521 until his death in 1531. Religious syncretism The Church that Afonso created was not simply a copy or extension of the Portuguese church, but from the very beginning included elements of Kongo theology. For example, the Kongos probably believed that most of the denizens of the Other World were the souls of deceased ancestors, and not gods who had never lived on earth or had a material existence. Thus, the catechism described the Holy Trinity as \\"three people\\" (antu a tatu). Priests were called by the same name as the previous clergy (nganga), and the term ukisi, an abstract noun from the same root that gives the word nkisi (typically used to describe a charm, or in 16th century parlance, an \\"idol\\") was used to translate holy. In fact, key religious terms such as God, holy, and spirit were rendered in Kikongo terms taken directly from Kongo cosmology (Nzambi Mpungu for God, nkisi for holy and moyo for spirit or soul). This in turn, made conversion easier, as self-identification requires only a simple declaration of faith. In this way, the Bible was called nkanda ukisi which might also be rendered as \\"charm in the form of a book\\" and a church was called nzo a ukisi or charm in the form of a building. In this way, Catholic saints were identified with local spiritual entities, and churches built in holy spots. This theology, developed by Afonso and a team of his colleagues, working with Portuguese priests, defined the way in which Kongolese approached the new religion and in many ways naturalized it. Maturation of the Church Although Afonso is often credited with creating and establishing the church, it is probably his grandson and successor Diogo I Nkumbi a Mpudi who really placed the church on solid ground. Under Diogo, a lay organization of teachers first grew up to support and supplement the always meager number of ordained priests. Diogo also had the services of some of the earliest missionaries of the Jesuit Order, who worked in Kongo from 1548 to 1555. Diogo worked smoothly with the Jesuits when they first came, but as the Jesuits demanded more respect and worked at times against Diogo's political interests, he became disillusioned. Their mutually antagonistic correspondence with Portugal during this period has sometimes contributed to Diogo enjoying a reputation as a weak or uninterested Christian, though the events of his reign suggest that such a reputation was probably undeserved. Not only did Diogo arrange for the church to reach into the rural areas of the country, but he actively supported missionary work to the north (into the kingdom of Loango and south into Matamba, and he supported Jesuit work in Ndongo as well. At the same time, as the church grew stronger, the King of Portugal decided to take greater control of it. He formalized his attempt to exercise control over Kongo's church by having the Pope place Kongo under the control of the newly created bishop of Sao Tome in 1534. Many years elapsed between the formal subordination of Kongo to Sao Tome and the first actual attempt of the bishop to exercise real control. When he did in the 1540, Diogo refused to allow the bishop to dismiss his personal confessor, Manuel Afonso. After another failed attempt in 1596, the Portuguese decided to destroy the Kongo church. In 1624 the bishop, moved, permanently, to Luanda and stopped ordaining new Kongo clergy. Diogo and the kings that followed established a strong laity, into whose hands the job of education typically fell, while the small numbers of ordained clergy only performed the sacraments. This pattern, so visible in later Kongo history, was probably already present in the late 16th century. The lay ministers were typically designated as teachers (mestres, literally masters, in Portuguese), were drawn from the nobility of Kongo, paid salaries by the state, and engaged both in teaching literacy, religious education, and often also secretarial duties. The personal papers of one such layman, António Manuel (who later became Kongo's ambassador to Rome) reveal the workings of this position. When given charge of the church of the Trinity in Soyo, he was paid a portion of the fees that were paid for his services, including fees charged in burials. When he was made mestre of the province of Mpemba, he was paid a salary of 6 lefukus of nzimbu shells a month, and also performed duties as a secretary.Antonio Manuel's papers are found in Archivio Segeto Vaticano, Miscellania, Armadio I, vol. 91 Collettione di Scritture di Spagna II, fols. 125 et seq. We have very little information about the numbers or lives of these mestres though they were very important in the day-to-day life of the church. Their activities explain how the ordinary Kongolese managed to retain their version of Christianity even in the absence of ordained clergy. The certainly worked closely with the secular clergy of the country, and are often mentioned by the missionaries of the regular orders (primarily Jesuit and Capuchin) who visited and worked in Kongo in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Role of regular clergy The regular clergy (monks and teaching orders) had an important role to play in the development of Kongo's version of Christianity. Jesuit missionaries had a brief presence in 16th century Kongo (1548–1555), but political issues between them and King Diogo I brought the mission to an end. A Discalced Carmelite mission worked in Kongo from 1584–88 and Dominicans also had a brief mission in 1610-1612. However, it was the renewed Jesuit mission and the Capuchin mission that marked the real presence of regular orders in Kongo. The Jesuits returned to Kongo in 1619, and in 1625 opened the College of São Salvador, which was responsible for the education of most of the Kongo elite in the mid 17th century. João de Paiva, the rector of the college until 1642, was particularly instrumental in the education of Kongolese, and also wrote an extensive, though now lost, chronicle of the country. Some of de Paiva's material informed the Synopsis Annalium of António Franco (1725). Jesuits also organized lay brotherhoods which played an important role in politics. The Jesuits were followed in 1645 by the Capuchins. Capuchins came to Kongo largely because Kongo kings, beginning with Álvaro II of Kongo, were dissatisfied with the failure of the bishops to ordain sufficient clergy and the Portuguese crown's opposition to the ordination of Kongolese. Kongo demanded that its church be separated from that of Portugal and that Angolan interests from the rival and increasingly enemy colony that often controlled the episcopal office. As a compromise, the Papacy decided to send Italian Capuchins from areas that were not objectionable to Portugal to Kongo. Although officially missionaries, the Capuchins were as much like parish priests as missionaries to the unconverted. In fact, this parish priest role put them frequently at odds with the secular clergy, who Capuchins charged were lax in their duties and too tolerant of traditional Kongolese religion. The Capuchins generally had three or four missionaries in the whole of Kongo, occasionally they had as many as ten, never enough to truly take over the instruction of the people or educate more than an elite of political actors and their own staff. The Capuchins generally constructed hospices near political centers, such as São Salvador, Mbamba, and Soyo or in territory relatively far from the political centers such as the hospice at Nsuku in the north of the country. There they and their staff of freed slaves (') who carried them on their annual rounds of the countryside. While travelling they stopped at centrally located villages for a few days while people from neighboring settlements came in, and then they performed the sacraments, especially baptism, to thousands. It was not uncommon for a long serving missionary to record tens of thousands of baptisms in their reports, and many fewer marriages and communions. The Capuchins' special role in Europe, America and in Africa was to purify the religious practice of rural communities, and in Kongo they were particularly keen to destroy what they considered \\"superstitious\\" in Kongolese religion, which included the making of charms (minkisi) and healing cults like the kimpasi. As such they were embued with the spirit of the Counter Reformation and hostile to many local practices, both in Europe and in Africa. Although some regarded Kongo as a devoutly Christian nation and were more tolerant of local custom, many wrote harsh denunciations of local practice. So much so that Axelsen portrayed their relations with the Kongo as something akin to a war until the mid-eighteenth century, when dwindling numbers of foreign clergy allowed the local religious actors to reassert themselves. Because of this literature, many scholars have argued that Kongo did not really accept Christianity, or simply masked their true beliefs behind show conversion. However, the missionary reports strongly suggest a syncretic understanding of Christianity on the part of the Kongo rural poor as well as the nobles, in which some elements of the former religion and many more of its cosmology informed Christian practice. Kongo in 1711 The Capuchin missionaries left very long accounts of Kongo, some of which are the best sources available to us today. Giovanni Francesco da Roma (1648), Antonio de Teruel (1664), Girolamo da Montesarchio (1668), Girolamo Merolla da Sorrento (1688), Luca da Caltanisetta (1701), Marcellino d'Atri (1702), Antonio Zucchelli da Gradisca (1712), Bernardo da Gallo (1710), Lorenzo da Lucca (1718), Cherubino da Savona (1775) and Raimondo da Dicomano (1798) among others, all left lengthy accounts full of details of daily life, political events, and religious observations. Finally, Giovanni Antonio Cavazzi da Montecuccolo, whose long book of 1687 was often quoted, cited and translated became one of the fundamental sources for Central African history, and his illustrations, both in the unpublished Araldi manuscript (in Modena) and as engravings in his book are important sources for daily life. After the first two decades of the 18th century, fewer Capuchins came to Kongo, and Portuguese policies, which restricted the ability of Capuchins to enter Angola and Kongo, hampered the 18th century mission as well. For most of the mid-18th century there was only one missionary in the country, and by the end of the century, there were many years with no Capuchins. The Capuchins finally left Central Africa altogether in 1835, and by then they had not had a missionary in Kongo since 1814. The Antonian Movement Kongo's long civil war, occasioned by their defeat at the Battle of Mbwila (1665) and the political crisis that followed led to a crisis in society and the church. The breakdown of order as no one king was able to establish authority over the whole country in the aftermath of the death of Antonio I at the battle, and the abandonment of the capital following its sack in 1678, resulted in the unofficial partitioning of the country into hostile camps led by rival kings and entrenched in the mountains of Mbula and Kibangu or the coastal province of Luvota. Their incessant wars led to population dislocation, food shortages, and an increase in the slave trade. In addition, the attitude of the Capuchins toward the Kongo elite, and toward the long established practices of the country galled many people. In this atmosphere of crisis, a new spirit of religious fervor arose in the preaching of Beatriz Kimpa Vita, who claimed to be possessed by Saint Anthony of Padua in 1704. Beatriz preached that all the kings had to reunite at the ancient and then abandoned capital of São Salvador to restore the kingdom. She also introduced new elements to religion that she claimed she had from God himself during weekly sojourns in Heaven. Among them were that Jesus had been born in Kongo and was a Kongolese as were his mother and Saint Anthony. She taught that the sacraments of the church were unnecessary for salvation, that the intention of the believer was all that was necessary. While some thought this might have been Protestant influence, it is likely that it derived from long held local concepts of religion. Beatriz preached at the camps of several of the kings and sent her followers to the others, eventually settling in São Salvador and taking up residence in the ruined cathedral. Shortly after this she became pregnant and was arrested by forces to Pedro IV, one of the pretenders. He put her on trial for witchcraft and had her burned at the stake on 2 July 1706. While Pedro was able to restore the kingdom and reoccupy Sāo Salvador, without much effective resistance from the Antonians, some of Beatriz's ideas, including the idea that Jesus was from Kongo remained. Brass crucifixes produced in Kongo in the eighteenth and nineteenth century frequently depict Jesus as an African and wearing clothing decorated in designs popular in the country. Christian Kongo Art Crucifix (Nkangi Kiditu), from the collection of the Brooklyn Museum The cross, a primary emblem of Christian ritual, was also a fundamental motif at the core of Kongo belief systems. The Kongo cosmogram, also called the Four Moments of the Sun, is a circle around a cross. It depicts the four divisions of the day—dawn, noon, dusk, and midnight—which represents the cyclical journey of a human life from birth to the afterlife of the ancestors. Considered an emblem of spiritual authority and power, the Christian cross was integrated into Kongo ancestral cults and burial rituals, and was believed to contain magical protective properties. In Kongo culture, crosses were believed to intervene in matters ranging from illness and fertility to rainfall. Fifteenth-century Kongo Christian religious art objects are closely modeled on European prototypes. They were usually cast in an open mold using metal obtained from brass units of currency known as manillas, imported from Europe. In typical crucifixes, Christ's facial features are reduced to stylized abbreviations that are less detailed in their descriptiveness. His hands and feet are flattened and the feet are joined into a single five-toed limb, which, according to interpretations of Kongo gestures, affords heightened spiritual power. The wrap and ribs are rendered as simplified to geometric linear abstractions. Christ is depicted with large protruding oval eyes, a common motif in Kongo art representing the supernatural vision of a human who is possessed by an ancestor or deity. Below Christ and above his shoulders are often small, highly stylized praying figures. Their role and identities are unknown, but they may be mourners or ancestors.

History The Illinois Department of Transportation was created by the 77th Illinois General Assembly on January 1972. The department absorbed the functions of the former Department of Public Works and Buildings, acquired some planning and safety inspection functions of other state agencies, and received responsibility for state assistance to local mass transportation agencies such as the Chicago-area Regional Transportation Authority, which was in the process of being formed at this time. The Division of Aeronautics was added in 1973. On June 18, 2005, IDOT became the first state transportation agency to achieve ISO 9001:2000 certification for 23 key processes located in the Central Administrative Office and regional District Six. On July 6, 2006, that certification was expanded to encompass all processes involved in the planning, design, and construction of road and bridge improvements, maintenance of roads and bridges, and administrative oversight in the Central Administrative Office and District Six. An official with IDOT, John D. Baranzelli, wrote a book called Making Government Great Again on the transition to ISO9001:2008 standards in July 2009 for the American Society for Quality publication arm (ASQ Press).\\"Making Government Great Again\\". ASQ Quality Press Catalog. Spring 2011. p. 21. In the spring of 2014, it was reported that IDOT had engaged in patronage hiring of numerous staff assistants - Ann Schneider resigning following this scandal. Schneider claimed that the improper hires were \\"recommended to me or my staff by the governor’s office,\\" specifically Chief of Staff Jack Lavin.

Most of their catalog is in English, and they regularly tour the United States. History=Early years Rockfour began writing and performing in Hebrew, and in 1991 released a single, \\"Haka'as\\" (\\"The Rage\\"), which did well on the Israeli rock charts. After undergoing several lineup and stylistic changes, they settled on what would remain a fairly stable musical identity in 1995 with their second studio album, Ha'ish Shera'a Hakol (The Man Who Saw It All). The music of the album was firmly rooted in 1960's psychedelic rock and the band used vintage instruments and recording equipment. To complement the \\"sixties\\" setting, six music videos were published for song from this album, all in a consistent, distinctive style: they combined vintage footage made with amateur-class cameras with footage of the band in the same style. Though not initially popular, over time this album gained the reputation of being one of the best albums in Hebrew-language rock, especially among younger critics. After several years it was certified as a gold record for selling over 20,000 copies. After In the late 1990s, the band began to write new material in English. During this period they recorded a studio album consisting of covers of classic Israeli rock songs by Shalom Hanoch and Arik Einstein, Behazara L'shablul. Although most of the songs were written during the psychedelic era, and Rockfour's covers were produced in their usual neo-psychedelic style, the original production on albums such as Shablul was fairly straightforward. In 1999 the band bid farewell to the Hebrew language with a live album (Behofa'a), in which they performed old and new material accompanied by a string section. The last track was a new studio recording titled \\"Mesibat Siyum\\" (\\"Graduation Party\\"), which literally translates as \\"Finishing Party\\". The International Market Supermarket, released in 2000, was Rockfour's first full-length album in English. It received some attention outside of Israel (for example, from Allmusic), which encouraged the band to record another album of new material, One Fantastic Day, and begin touring internationally in 2001. Eventually they were signed to American label Rainbow Quartz. Their first release for the label was Another Beginning - a compilation of tracks from Supermarket and One Fantastic Day, which was followed by For Fans Only! - a collection of b-sides and live covers. During 2001 they produced and played on Shy Nobleman psychedelic pop debut album \\"How to Be Shy\\", which became a hit in Israel. During the recording of Nationwide in Detroit, Michigan in 2004, tensions began to develop between lead singer Eli LuLai and the rest of the band. LuLai left the band in the middle of the subsequent world tour. The remaining trio shifted around vocal duties and returned to performing the night after LuLai's departure. Without LuLai Guitarist Baruch Ben Yitzhak took the role of lead singer for the recording of Rockfour's next album, Memories of the Never Happened, which was released through the Israeli indie label Anova Music. Keyboardist and multi-instrumentalist Yaki Gani was also added to the band after participating in the recordings, making them a quartet once again. In 2006 the groundbreaking artist management/ record label Anova Productions, founded by singer -songwriter and Midem Veteran Anat Damon, picked up the band. With the help of manager Hillel Wachs and after a long production process, the album was released in Israel in May 2007, and internationally on October 9, 2007 on Cooking Vinyl USA, with an accompanying extensive tour of the United States. During the recording of Memories of the Never Happened the band recorded a cover of Pink Floyd's debut single \\"Arnold Layne\\" and submitted it to a competition created by David Gilmour in honor of composer Syd Barrett's death. Gilmour picked Rockfour's version as the best cover of the song, and the band won a day of recording at London's Abbey Road Studios. As of April 2010, these recordings have yet to be released. In June 2010, the band had released their first album in Hebrew from original materials with Anova Music. The album, Ha'olam Hamufla (The Wonderful World) gained the critics' love though the complexity of the materials that merged their psychedelic rock influences with more contemporary sounds in the style of the 2000s Flaming Lips, The Shines and Grandaddy . May 2013 saw the release of another English-language studio album, Too Many Organs. Reunion with LuLai In November 2014, the band officially announced they will be reuniting with former lead singer Eli LuLai, 10 years after parting ways. In the announcement the band indicated the reunion would not be a singular event but they plan to collaborate as a band in the future. The announcement was followed by a release of a new single with Lulai, \\"Helkikei Avak\\" (\\"Fractions of dust\\"), and a special live show in Tel Aviv in early 2015. Due to audience demand, 2 more live shows were added. In March 2015, the reunited band released another single, \\"Namer shel niyaar\\" (\\"Paper tiger\\"). In January 2016, the band held live shows in honor of the 20th anniversary of their iconic album \\"Ha'ish Shera'a Hakol\\". It was then also announced that Issar Tennenbaum had left the band and that they woult be joined by Itamar Levi. Subsequently they have also performed with Yoni Tennenbaum on drums. Style=Psychedelia From Ha'ish Shera'a Hakol on, Rockfour have kept strictly to a neo-psychedelic style, writing and recording songs using techniques of such classic psychedelic rock groups as The Beatles, The Zombies, The Who, The Byrds, and early Pink Floyd. However, because Rockfour freely recombine their influences, and adopt a playing style significantly more aggressive than that of their influences (with the exception of the record-setting loudness of The Who), the resulting sound is modern and distinct. Among their psychedelic influences, the use of extended three-part harmonies and the unique sound of the 12-string Rickenbacker guitar stand out especially. Other Genres Rockfour sometimes employ the compositional style, though not the winding melodies, of progressive rock groups such as King Crimson and Genesis, most notably on the songs \\"She's Full of Fears\\" from Supermarket and \\"Old Village House\\" from Memories of the Never Happened. The mellotron, played in a style quite close to that of Robert Fripp of King Crimson, has also appeared on many of the band's studio recordings. Starting with One Fantastic Day, they have incorporated the heavy, distorted guitar-sound of alternative rock, though it was toned down since the departure of LuLai. Live performances of older material maintain this style.

She first appeared in 2003 with her family, which included her twin sister Sophie Burton, played by Powney's real life twin Connie Powney. Storylines Mel was an attractive and sometimes aggressive 18-year-old girl with her share of insecurities. Mel came to Hollyoaks in 2003 to attend Hollyoaks Community College. She arrived as a fresher and became friends with Robbie Flynn and Joe Spencer. Mel began to fall for Darren Osborne, but when the pair had slept together Darren made it clear that it was just a one-night stand. Her family soon arrived in Hollyoaks, including her twin sister Sophie. Mel strongly resented of her sister being in Hollyoaks as she feared that she would get more attention than her, especially as she was to join HCC as well. Unlike Sophie, Mel was quiet and introverted and often felt inferior to her more outgoing sister. Mel and Sophie began dating respectively Max Cunningham and Sam \\"O.B.\\" O'Brien, who initially couldn't tell them apart. While Mel was originally partnered with Max, he soon realised he preferred Sophie and Mel became closer to O.B. Things didn't get any easier for Mel, as her mother Liz's partner Richard moved in with the Burtons with his two children and Mel found it hard to live with her mother's new partner. During Liz and Richard's wedding, Mel learned the truth about her father's death, that he had committed suicide. Mel's younger brother Justin went off the rails, while Mel also couldn't understand her father's actions and turned to drink. Her behaviour became out of control as she began having drunken one night stands before beginning a proper relationship with O.B. Despite the pair seeming compatible, Mel's drinking often got in the way, which led to Mel finishing her relationship with OB. At the SU bar summer party 2005 Mel got extremely drunk and thought that she still lived in her old house, smashing a window with a statue of a tiger. The police arrested Mel for being drunk and disorderly. The following day she woke up in a police cell and had no idea why she was in there. Mel was then released and vowed to give up drinking but once again failed. One night when she was drunk, Mel had unprotected sex with a stranger and feared that she had caught a sexually transmitted infection. Luckily, tests for STIs came back negative. Mel curbed her drinking problem to an extent after this traumatic experience, but she still hadn't overcome her alcoholism. Serial date-rapist Andy Holt targeted the Burton sisters around Christmas 2005. He spiked Mel and Sophie's drinks with the date rape drug GHB after getting an invite to their house. Although Andy raped Mel that night, Sophie escaped a similar fate because Andy's fellow rapist Sam Owen decided that he couldn't hurt Sophie because he had genuine feelings for her. After the rape, Mel and Sophie recovered from the drowsiness of the drugs enough to piece together that Andy had supposedly raped them both, although they were still unaware that Sam had been involved. Mel and Sophie went to the police to make their accusations, but Andy disappeared before he could be charged. Tests by the police proved that Sophie had not been raped, causing friction between the sisters as they wondered why only Mel had been raped. Turning once again to alcohol to block out her problems, Mel fell into a drink-induced coma on New Year's Eve 2005. While she was in hospital being treated, Mel admitted to Liz that she had been raped. Mel carried on drinking despite OB trying to help Mel get through her problems. While attending a funfair with OB, Mel spotted Andy and managed to track him down just in time after he had taken Nicole, Russ and Sam Owen hostage. Mel gave Andy a taste of his own medicine as Mel drugged Andy with Date Rape GHB and tied him up. Mel grabbed a pole and violently hit Andy around the head with it, which knocked Andy unconscious for about ten minutes. When Andy awoke Mel called him a coward and a bully. Andy managed to escape whilst Mel was untying Nicole, Russ and Sam, Mel realised he escaped and chased after him which led to Andy facing his own woeful death as he was impaled on a sharpened spike as he ran into the unlit warehouse cellar. Despite Andy finally getting what he deserved, it wasn't enough for Mel who continued to drink heavily. Eventually it was discovered that Sam Owen was Andy's date-rape partner in crime and Sophie managed to trick him into surrendering at the police station. OB offered Mel a job at the nightclub he and Max were managing at the time, The Loft. Max was reluctant for Mel to work there because of her drink problem and Mel soon developed a rivalry with Max's girlfriend Clare Devine, after Clare saw Mel drinking behind the bar instead of working. One night while babysitting Max's brother Tom with OB, Mel filled a coke can with vodka and Tom drank some, leading to him becoming ill. When Max found out what Mel had done, he fired her from The Loft. However while Max was away Mel continued to work for OB and walked in on Clare having a fling with Sean Kennedy in the nightclub office. Clare used Mel's drinking problem against her to convince Max and OB that she was lying, although OB later sided with Mel, ending his friendship with Max. After failing her degree Mel carried on drinking until Sophie took a bottle of vodka away from her that she had been hiding in her wardrobe. Consequently, the girls had a fight at the top of the stairs. As Mel tried to grab the vodka she accidentally pushed Sophie downstairs leaving her sister unconscious and fighting for her life in hospital. Sophie thankfully survived and forgave Mel who began attending a support group for her drink problem. Mel began working at the salon Evissa with Sophie and slept with Warren Fox. Mel thought they were now a couple but Warren later told her that it was just a one off leaving her heartbroken. Mel then got a job with a team called Zedex and her manager asked her to join them for a drink at the local pub. Initially Mel turned down the offer but then reluctantly agreed. Mel got very drunk and upon returning home she searched through all the cupboards for some vodka, trashing plates and throwing things around the room. The next day Mel could not remember what had happened so Sophie told her everything. When Mel went to work she got sacked for making a fool of herself and losing some private Zedex papers and being hours late. After this Mel never touched a drop of alcohol again. Mel, along with Sophie, moved in with Louise Summers after Liz moved away and sold the Burton house. She was unemployed for a short while but was given her old job back at the salon. Mel managed to catch Clare once again cheating on Max, as she saw her sleeping with Warren on CCTV footage. After successfully recording the footage, Mel turned to OB with the evidence as the pair confronted a worried Clare in the pub The Dog in The Pond on 8 September 2006. However, Sam Owen had escaped from prison and burst into the pub, setting the place on fire. Mel and Sophie died in the explosion along with Sam, student Olivia Johnson and Mel's friend Joe Spencer. Mel was last seen jumping on Sam in an attempt to stop him attacking Sophie. Mel's charred body was later seen by OB in the pub.

In 1991 the British government decided to privatise the country's railways. David Hare recounts the development through the powerful first-hand accounts of those most intimately involved. From passengers to government ministers, their voices bear witness to a story of national mismanagement. Inspired by Ian Jack's book The Crash That Stopped Britain , the play is a piece of verbatim theatre based on numerous interviews, by the actors themselves, of the people involved. Theatre director Max Stafford-Clark and transport journalist Christian Wolmar selected the interviewees. With a little linking narrative added, skilful collating and editing allowed the quotations to take the form of powerful drama: Actor Lloyd Hutchison of Out of Joint, the original acting company, describes Hare's contribution thus: \\"He puts in very, very little bridging material. The play is really one statement after another. He hasn't exactly written it; he collated it. Incidents covered in the play include the passing of the Railways Act 1993 setting out the structure of rail privatization and the survival and bereavement stories resulting from the rail crashes of Southall, Ladbroke Grove, Hatfield, and Potters Bar. One character is author Nina Bawden, who was badly injured in the Potters Bar crash in which her husband Austen Kark was also killed. The play first opened in York in November 2003, directed by Stafford-Clark. The production toured Britain in 2004, winning the \\"Best Touring Production\\" award from the Theatre Management Association. A version for radio, with the original director and cast members, was made by Catherine Bailey Productions and broadcast on BBC Radio 3 on 14 March 2004. It was runner up in the year's Sony Radio Academy Award for drama. In September 2019 a \\"site specific\\" production, directed by Alexander Lass, was mounted in the Vaults Theatre, beneath the tracks of Waterloo Station, London.

Overall these mysteries are not rated highly, but this is considered to be one of the best in the series.Review at Asimovonline It first appeared in the September 1980 issue of Gallery under the title \\"To Spot A Spy\\". Plot The central character, Griswold, explains that during World War II, he was involved in US intelligence. While questioning a suspected German spy, he performed a word association test on him. When Griswold said \\"terror of flight,\\" the suspect replied, \\"gloom of the grave.\\" This was evidence that he was a spy who had been trained up in Americanisms, since the two phrases allude to a line in the third verse of \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" and no native-born American could possibly be familiar with the third verse of the national anthem (\\"except for me, and I know everything,\\" added Griswold). Most Americans only know the first verse because it is the only one of the anthem's four verses that is normally sung. This is a tongue-in-cheek parody of stories where an enemy agent is caught by his lack of knowledge. However, Griswold does make the serious point that the third verse of the US national anthem is particularly war-mongering, and so was especially forgotten in the \\"great peace-loving years of 1941 to 1945.\\" In truth, the third verse was often omitted during those times by the few who knew it because of the alliance with Great Britain, which was the enemy in the War of 1812 and thus the object of scorn in the third verse.

Originally introduced in 1956, it was discontinued in 1958. The model, with some modifications, was reintroduced in 1991 and remained in production until 2004. With a florentine cutaway, a trapeze tailpiece, two P-100 pickups (stacked humbuckers with P-90 covers) with two tone and volume controls and a three-way switch. It had looks and tone reminiscent of the old ES-125 TDC, but was not a fully hollow thinline guitar, having a feedback-suppressing sustain block running under the pickups and bridge from the neck/body joint to the base of the body like the ES-335 instead, but here not made of maple but of balsa wood. The body itself and neck were again of similar construction to the ES-335, being built from laminated maple but with an unbound rosewood fingerboard with dot-style fret position markers. The metal fittings were chrome-plated, and the p-100s had black plastic \\"soapbar\\" style covers. The guitar, when launched, was the most basic and lowest-priced in the Gibson ES range, but had the same fittings, wiring and construction quality as more expensive models. At launch, Gibson claimed it was the first semi-solid electric guitar with a Florentine-style single cutaway in the world. The ES-135 went through several changes during its production life. The P100 pickups, intended to have the tone and output of the P-90 but without the single-coil P-90's tendency to hum, did not meet with universal approval, having a slightly less biting tone and at times an equal tendency to squeal at high volumes. The use of P-100s was therefore discontinued and conventional Gibson covered humbuckers substituted. The original trapeze tailpiece gave the guitar a distinctive tone and an aggressive \\"bark\\" when played with vigour, but again was not entirely popular. The trapeze makes re-stringing a slow operation and the very long string length needed to reach from the tailpiece to the tuners meant some brands of strings did not fit. The ES-135 Studio featured no f-holes, a stop tailpiece and Tune-O-Matic bridge, and Humbuckers. The Gibson Guitar Corporation currently sells a similar model with more up-market appointments (neck binding and inlays) and two classic humbucking pickups, the Gibson ES-137.

He debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 3 October 2005 and was created by David Hanson. Neville departed in July 2010 with his wife Suzanne Ashworth (Suzanne Hall) and their son Josh Ashworth (Sonny Flood), after they were all axed by new executive producer Paul Marquess. Character creation=Backstory Neville Ashworth is one of the main 'adult' characters in Hollyoaks and the head of the Ashworth family. As such, the character has provided the parental viewpoint in storylines that cover issues such as eating disorders, incest, drug addiction and misattributed parentage. In contrast to this role, he is also the comic relief in many scenes, with Neville characterised as old fashioned, boring and somewhat bigoted, in the tradition of former character, Gordon Cunningham. Like Gordon, Neville is also a small businessman and owns the local shop, Drive 'n' Buy. In late 2008, the character became the local publican when he purchased The Dog in the Pond. Casting Actor Jim Millea was given the role after regular auditions for Neville's character in the Ashworth family, he was created by David Hanson. In early 2010, it was announced that Allan had stepped down from the position of executive producer and that Paul Marquess had taken over the role. It was soon revealed that Marquess planned to give Hollyoaks a \\"shake up\\", changing the productions team In February 2010, it was announced that new series producer Paul Marquess had decided not to renew Millea's contract, along with Suzanne Hall and Sonny Flood's contracts. Hall and Flood portray Neville's on-screen wife and son respectively. A Channel 4 spokesperson stated: \\"It was only time before some were given the boot. Everyone knows that the new captain's reputation precedes him as far as putting a stamp on a show is concerned.\\" The continued: \\"He's getting rid of the dead wood — nobody is safe. This is just the beginning. Over the next few months expect to wave goodbye to even more faces.\\" Marquess later revealed he axed the Ashworths because he believed The Dog should have a lively family at the heart of it, that the Ashworths had become grim because of their hard hitting storylines. Storylines=2005–2010 Neville arrives with the rest of the Ashworth clan in 2005, moving into the Hunter family's old home. The local businessman, he is married to Suzanne (Suzanne Hall) and his children are Rhys (Andrew Moss), Hannah (Emma Rigby) and Josh (Sonny Flood). In 2007, Neville discovered that Suzanne had slept with his brother Noel (Craig Cheetham), 20 years ago and his eldest son, Rhys, was not actually his biological son, but his nephew. Neville claims he knew nothing about the affair. Rhys decides he wants nothing to do with him for several weeks and moves in with his father. Eventually Noel shows his true colours and leaves Hollyoaks. Rhys returns home and rebuilds his relationship with Neville. In September 2007, it is discovered that Hannah has an eating disorder. Neville has difficulty understanding this and tension begins amongst the Ashworths. Neville finds out that Noel has died. Neville quickly plans Noel's funeral and wake. Rhys does not want to go to his father's funeral; however, Josh finally convinces him to attend the wake. Rhys tells Neville that he is the man who has raised him and so he will always see Neville as his father. When Hannah returns from hospital, the family try their best to support her. Neville finds out she is in a relationship with Danny Valentine (David Judge) and is not too pleased. Whilst he says his reason is that Hannah had been advised not to enter a relationship while recovering from her eating disorder, his real objection is Danny's skin colour. Later, Neville tries to accept Danny. In April 2008, Neville and the rest of the family are shattered when they learn Rhys is having an affair with his half-sister, Beth (Sinéad Moynihan), who is engaged to family friend, Gilly Roach (Anthony Quinlan). Further trauma occurs when Beth and Rhys are in a serious accident which kills Beth. In November 2008, Neville buys The Dog in the Pond in a private auction. He also purchased a number of council flats in Hollyoaks. Neville renames The Dog \\"The Jolly Roger\\". However, he changes it back after discovering it has turned into a gay bar. In 2009, Neville, along with Suzanne, Rhys and Josh, assume Hannah has taken a relapse after finding food, planted by Ash Roy (Junade Khan), in her room. Innocent Hannah tries to explain it was Ash, but the Ashworths do not believe her. Hannah then moves out as she cannot cope with living with people who do not trust her. Hannah continues to have problems until leaving in early 2010. In spring 2010, Josh is the driver in a car crash which injures several people. None of the family knows that Rhys had spiked Josh's drink, and they all blame Josh. Neville and the family cut Josh out of their lives and as a result, on Suzanne's birthday dinner, Josh punches Neville. Acting on Josh's behaviour, Neville reports his own son to the police. Josh is sentenced to prison for his role in the car crash, and the family falls further apart. To make matters worse, Suzanne begins a sexual affair with Hannah's fiancé Darren Osborne (Ashley Taylor Dawson) at Calvin (Ricky Whittle) and Carmel Valentine's (Gemma Merna) wedding. Suzanne tries to resist, but soon Rhys catches them as they are about to have sex. When Rhys tells Neville about the affair, Neville throws Suzanne out of the family home. When Josh returns early from his prison sentence, Neville and Suzanne reconcile. Ultimately Neville decides they need a clean break, and they tell Josh that since he started their problems, he will stay behind while the rest of the family move to Spain. A guilt-ridden Rhys, unable to convince Neville to change his mind, confesses that he was the one who caused Josh's car crash. Neville is furious with Rhys, who then stays behind in Josh's place, to help sell The Dog. In spite of Neville's anger, he hugs Rhys goodbye, suggesting he will forgive Rhys. In January 2011, Suzanne unexpectedly returns to Hollyoaks. She reveals that Neville is divorcing her as she is pregnant with Darren's twins. In December 2012, Suzanne returns for Rhys' funeral and reveals that Neville could not make it as he recently had surgery on his back and couldn't fly out. It is also implied that Suzanne and Neville are still together in Spain.

The design of the ship was supposedly drawn on the ground by Enki, and the frame of the ark, which was made in five days, was 200 feet in length, width and height, with a floor-space of one acre. The ark interior had seven floors, each floor divided into 9 sections, finishing the ark fully on the seventh day. The entrance to the ship was sealed once everyone had boarded the ship. He was also tasked with bringing his wife, family, and relatives along with the craftsmen of his village, baby animals, and grains. The oncoming flood would wipe out all animals and people not on the ship, a concept later seen in the biblical story of Noah's Ark. After twelve days on the water, Utnapishtim opened the hatch of his ship to look around and saw the slopes of Mount Nisir, where he rested his ship for seven days. On the seventh day, he sent a dove out to see if the water had receded, and the dove could find nothing but water, so it returned. Then he sent out a swallow, and just as before, it returned, having found nothing. Finally, Utnapishtim sent out a raven, and the raven saw that the waters had receded, so it circled around, but did not return. Utnapishtim then set all the animals free, and made a sacrifice to the gods. The gods came, and because he had preserved the seed of man while remaining loyal and trusting of his gods, Utnapishtim and his wife were given immortality, as well as a place among the heavenly gods. Enki (Ea) also claims that he did not tell \\"Atrahasis\\" (apparently referring to Utnapishtim) about the flood, but rather that he only made a dream appear to him, a claim which contradicts the earlier narrative of the poem and reveals an alternative telling.  Role in the epic  In the epic, overcome with the death of his friend Enkidu, the hero Gilgamesh sets out on a series of journeys to search for his ancestor Utnapishtim (Xisouthros) who lives at the mouth of the rivers and has been given eternal life. Utnapishtim counsels Gilgamesh to abandon his search for immortality, but gives him a trial to defy sleep if he wishes to obtain immortality. Failing at his trial to defy sleep, Utnapishtim next tells Gilgamesh about a plant that can make him young again. Gilgamesh obtains the plant from the bottom of the sea in Dilmun (often considered to be current-day Bahrain) but a serpent steals it, and Gilgamesh returns home to the city of Uruk, having abandoned hope of either immortality or renewed youth.

Company seals were predominantly used by companies in common law jurisdictions, although in modern times, most countries have done away with the use of seals. In the UK, a company may have a company seal under the provisions of Companies Act 2006 section 45. It may have further seals for other territories and for issuing securities. These seals have the additional legend of the territory or the word SECURITIES. A company may wish still to seal documents as a means of protection against forgery. Traditionally, the seal was of some legal significance because the affixing of the seal signified that the document was the act and deed of the company, whereas when a document was merely signed by a director, then that was deemed to be an act carried out on behalf of the company by its agents, which was subject to applicable restrictions and limitations under the ordinary law of agency. Corporate seals are generally only used for two purposes by corporations today: *Documents which need to be executed as deeds (as opposed to simple contracts), may be executed under the company's common seal *Certain corporate documents, for example share certificates are often issued under the company seal (and some countries required that share certificates be issued under the common seal). For example, in India a share certificate is given under the common seal of the company and each usage of common seal is documented in the statutory registry of the company. Physically, seals were previously used to make an impression on melted wax on the relevant document, although modern seals will usually only leave an indentation or impression on the paper (although sometimes a red wafer is used to imitate old red wax seals, and to make the sealing show up better on photocopies).

Like all Ivy League bands except Cornell's, it is a scatter band. The Brown Band began performing on ice skates in 1970, and claims to be the world's best (and, actually, only) ice skating scatter band. It is the source of much of Brown's school spirit, and often appears as a public representation of Brown to the Providence community and to other universities. The Band is present at all home and away football games, various basketball and hockey games, as well as Commencement and other special events each year. It receives funding from Brown's Undergraduate Finance Board.  History and traditions  The Band was founded in 1924 by Irving Harris, a freshman who was shocked to find that the University had no band. This established a tradition of a student-run organization that currently has University practice space and a faculty advisor (currently Karen Mellor), but is primarily driven by its student leadership. The Band creates between 700 and 1000 buttons for each football game. These buttons have short messages that make fun of the opposing team, usually through wordplay and stereotyping the opposing school. Brown Band members proudly display these buttons on their uniforms, often making large patterns out of them. Buttons are handed out to every fan who goes near the Band. During the third quarter, several bandies will walk over to the opposing team's stands and hand out buttons. Other bands are typically the first recipients of buttons during this time, and many band members at other Ivy League schools wear Brown Band buttons on their uniforms.  Elrod T. Snidley  Elrod T. Snidley is the Brown Band's mascot. He is always depicted carrying a bugle and leaning on a bass drum. Elrod was created in 1968 as a self-portrait of Band President C. Douglas Ballon, '69. In those days, Ballon's cross-eyed likeness of himself was affectionately referred to as \\"Doogi\\". Renamed \\"Elrod\\" by Ballon's successors, his likeness adorns almost every object that the Brown Band wears or sells, including their uniforms, pens, and kazoos. Bandies often use a variation on the name \\"Elrod Snidley\\" for the titles of intramural sports teams its members play on. Elrod also made a nearly successful run for President of the Undergraduate Council of Students in 1988. Bandies taped up posters of Elrod with the slogan, \\"Vote for Snidley - he won't do diddley!\\" While he was not officially recognized, he received nearly half of the student votes as a write-in candidate.  Leadership  The Brown Band is a student-run organization with a faculty advisor. There is an elected board and various appointed positions of leadership. The leaders of the Band are collectively known as the Band Board, and are elected near the end of the fall football season. Band Board consists of a president, vice president, general manager (\\"mom\\"), business manager (\\"money god/goddess/deity\\"), corresponding secretary (\\"corsec\\"), and recording secretary (\\"recsec\\"). In addition to Band Board, there are several appointed positions of leadership, including a head student conductor and one to two assistant conductors, script writers, historians, librarians, webmasters, public relations and recruitment chairs, and alumni liaisons.  Repertoire  The Brown Band's repertoire is a selection of music from the Band's music library, which contains several hundred pieces of music. The repertoire itself consists of approximately fifty songs and undergoes slight changes each year. The repertoire comprises several Brown-specific songs and many more pop songs. While most Brown students know the words to Ever True to Brown (Brown's fight song), few people outside the Band know the words to other Brown songs. Many songs have alternate lyrics that the band sings to pass time on long bus trips. Brown songs are typically played, sung, and played again. Some Brown songs are played only at certain events. Ki-Yi-Yi is played when the hockey team scores a goal. On the Chapel Steps and the Commencement March are part of the repertoire only during Commencement Week. The Brown-specific Songs Are as Follows: * Ever True to Brown (#1) * Brown Cheering Song (#2) * Brown Forevermore (#3 or \\"Brown Three-evermore\\") * For Bruno and For Brown (#4 or \\"4 Bruno and 4 Brown\\") * Alma Mater (\\"Apple Mango,\\" \\"That Song,\\" etc.) * Brown Bear (A polka) * Bring the Victory * In the Fray * Brown Man Born (Brunonian Born) The band plays a wide variety of pop songs, which are often arranged by the band's own members. Some of the more frequently played songs include: * You Can Call Me Al * The Impression That I Get * Stacy's Mom * Pompeii * Time Warp * Ding Dong Song * Bad Romance * We're All in This Together * Karn Evil 9 (1st Impression, Part 2) * I Want You Back * Build Me Up, Buttercup * Doctor Worm * Rock Lobster  Events  The Brown University Band (in brown blazers) play at Cornell's Schoellkopf Field in October 2017. Cornell's band is behind them. The Band is present at every home and away Ivy football game in the fall semester. During the spring semester, the band will play at basketball or hockey games once or twice a weekend, and usually one lacrosse game per semester. Brown University administration also occasionally asks the band to be present at certain important events, such as the kickoff of the Boldly Brown campaign or the dedication of Friedman Hall. Other yearly events include the stealth show, where the band hides in bushes and buildings surrounding the main green, then surprises students who are just leaving class at the busiest time of day with a humorous and uncensored scatter band show. On the morning of the Parents' Weekend football game, the Band completes a Campus March that takes them through several dorms and outside most of the rest. While the Band stands by the claim that this is to build team spirit and to get people to come to the football game, many students are unhappy with the early wakeup.Ben Bernstein '09: All the small things - Columns However, not all parades are early in the morning. Every December, the Band parades around campus playing Christmas and Hanukkah carols, giving out hot chocolate and candy canes to anyone willing to brave the cold New England weather, and even playing inside the dining hall, library, and CIT. Once a year, the Band performs for patrons waiting in line for Ben and Jerry's Free Cone Day before getting their own free ice cream.  Ice shows  Since the 1969-70 Hockey Season, after two hockey games a year at Brown's Meehan Auditorium, the Brown University Band performs an ice show, similar to field shows during football season. The Band \\"scrambles\\" and skates into forms on the ice while a humorous script is read over the PA system. Each ice show ends in a maneuver known as the Counterskate. The Band lines up in two rows perpendicular to the red and blue lines on the ice and begins playing \\"In the Fray.\\" After eight measures (when the music begins to speed up), the lines begin skating towards the center of the ice, intersecting and crossing each other near the blue line. The lines continue and by the end of the piece, a capital letter B is formed between the two blue lines. This maneuver is likely the most ambitious and difficult stunt attempted on a regular basis by the Brown Band. This is especially so given the fact that many members have little to no skating experience, not to mention skating with an instrument.

Its mission is to provide a safe, efficient, aesthetically pleasing and environmentally sound intermodal transportation system for the user. The department is responsible for implementing policy made by the Arkansas State Highway Commission, a board of officials appointed by the Governor of Arkansas to direct transportation policy in the state. The department's director is appointed by the commission to hire staff and manage construction and maintenance on Arkansas's highways. The primary duty of ArDOT is the maintenance and management of the over Arkansas Highway System. The department also conducts planning, public transportation, the State Aid County Road Program, the Arkansas Highway Police, and Federal-Aid project administration. Its headquarters are in Little Rock. History Central control of highway transportation in Arkansas began with the creation of the State Highway Commission by Act 302 of the 39th Arkansas General Assembly in 1913. The Commission was made up of the Arkansas Commissioner of State Lands and two other governor-appointed members. The Commission was tasked with coordination roadway construction standards and route planning among the state's myriad county agencies and road improvement districts, and had little power or funding. The situation was bad enough that the federal government, who had become involved in standardizing road construction, stopped sending federal highway dollars to Arkansas in 1923. An emergency session of the 44th Arkansas General Assembly enacted the Harrelson Road Law to meet federal requirements to receive funding. The act also reformed the Highway Commission into four members appointed from the state's agricultural districts by the governor, plus the Commissioner of State Lands (elected statewide) serving as chairman. The Highway Commission had purview over any road projects in the state meeting their standards. Given the ability to control where federal highway dollars were spent, the Highway Commission became very powerful, and subject to political and provincial interests. This Commission became so powerful, the Commissioner of State Lands was unofficially referred to as the Highway Commissioner almost everywhere except official state documents. Naming The \\"Highway\\" in AHTD's name was largely required by the Arkansas Constitution which created the Arkansas Highway Commission as its governing body; the Constitution still calls it the \\"State Highway Department\\", but the legislature added \\"and Transportation\\" to its name in 1977. Many people in Arkansas continue to call it the \\"Highway Department\\" to this day. On June 8, 2017, the AHTD announced that it would change its name and logo to the Arkansas Department of Transportation (ArDOT) effective July 31, 2017. Administration For administrative purposes, ArDOT divided the state of Arkansas into 10 districts supervised by district offices along with 75 county area maintenance headquarters and 31 resident engineer offices located across the state. Most districts covered multiple counties. As a state agency, its central offices are located in Little Rock, which is covered by District 6. Divisions The ArDOT currently is divided into 23 divisions. Several of these divisions are administrative: Computer Services, Equipment and Procurement, Fiscal Services, Human Resources, Internal Audit, Legal, Maintenance, and Retirement. Others lead various aspects of highway construction design, construction, financing, planning or coordination. Divisions are further subdivided into Sections. ;Bridge The Bridge Division contains five Sections: four of bridge design engineers, and the Structural Inventory and Rating Section for existing bridges. Many of Arkansas's highway bridges are designed in-house by these sections, with more complex or specialized bridges traditionally being bid out to a consulting engineering firm for specialized design. ;Arkansas Highway Police The oldest state law enforcement agency in Arkansas, the Arkansas Highway Police, is the Law Enforcement branch of ArDOT. Today, the Arkansas Highway Police is tasked with preserving and protecting the State and Federal Highways of Arkansas. The Highway Police is the second largest statewide law enforcement agency in Arkansas, behind only the Arkansas State Police, with whom they share concurrent jurisdiction. The main focuses of the Highway Police is Size and weight regulation, Motor Carrier Enforcement, Hazardous Material enforcement, and lately, drug interdiction. The Arkansas Highway Police also regulates and permits all oversize loads coming through Arkansas. The Highway Police operates a fleet of patrol units as well as a network of Weigh Stations positioned on major highways through the state.

This includes matters relating to local governance and governance by the federal government of Canada, the inclusion of the aboriginal population in territorial affairs, and the matter of official languages for the territory. Key to the politics and governance of the Northwest Territories are the limits on the jurisdiction of the territorial government. Territories of Canada have no inherent jurisdiction and only have those powers delegated to them by the federal government. The devolution and delegation of power to the territory has always been a factor in the territory's politics. A hallmark of politics in the Northwest Territories is that it operates as under a “consensus government” system. Candidates for election to the territorial legislature do not stand as members of a political party. While some candidates may express an affiliation or membership with a party, party membership is not recognized in the legislature. As a result, the Members of the Legislative Assembly select a Premier by way of a secret ballot, rather than on the basis of party affiliation (see Responsible government). Local governance has been a long-standing issue in the territory. This includes not only the loss of local government authority from the period from 1905 to 1951, when Ottawa asserted direct control over the governance of the territory, but also related matters of aboriginal self-governance and land claims. This latter issue lead, in part, to the division of the territory into the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. Language has also been a long-standing issue in Northwest Territory politics. French became an official language, along with English, in 1877. This resulted in heated debates in the territorial assembly and the establishment of English as the only official language until pressure from the federal government in the 1980s lead to not only the inclusion of French as an official language, but also nine aboriginal languages.

The anagram map was circulated on the web in February 2006.  Controversy  The map was featured on thousands of blogs before a Transport for London lawyer requested that the map be removed. It inspired some people to create anagram versions of their hometown's metro system with similar legal repercussions. The fact that it was appreciated internationally, despite some not knowing the stations behind the anagrams, is a recognition of Harry Beck's iconic Tube map design. Origin of the anagram map The map was created by 'Barry Heck' using a photoshopped Tube map and an online anagram generator, on 7 February 2006. It was originally shown in a thread on the Thingbox chat forum and, after being submitted by one of the site owners, appeared on BoingBoing a couple of days later receiving 31,000 hits within the next six days. (The name Barry Heck is a pseudonym chosen because it is an anagram and spoonerism of Harry Beck.) The idea came from The Great Bear, a 1992 artwork by UK artist Simon Patterson on display at Tate Modern in London, but it was not until Dorian Lynskey's music genre tube map appeared in a newspaper in 2006 that Barry Heck decided to make it.

Created by Mark Campbell, it consisted of a website, a large illuminated Map, a series of animations that were shown on the large screen on Buchanan St in Glasgow) and a pop-out Anagram Map of Glasgow designed by Mark Campbell and published by the Map Group. which involved a large light box anagram map of glasgow and Pop-out Maps with anagrams of Glasgow's cultural establishments which were for sale to commemorate Scotland's Year of the Artist 2000. Transport for London claimed the image was a copyright infringement and had one of their lawyers ask for the map to be removed from the web. The site hosting it complied and it was removed on 22 February 2006 with the action being reported on BoingBoing again. Transport for London also censored other websites that hosted the image such as the www.geofftech.co.uk site. But an online backlash against TFL's lawyers meant that many other websites made mirrors of Geoff's page, thus resulting in more copies of tube map \\"mash-ups\\" on the internet. The owner of the site – Geoff Marshall, was interviewed on BBC Radio 5 Live by Chris Vallance about \\"map-mashing\\" (making parody maps) in which the London Underground anagram map was discussed. This was broadcast on 14 March 2006. Blogging BoingBoing has reported that Washington, Toronto, Amsterdam, Chicago, Oslo, Boston, New York City, Atlanta, Sydney, and Vienna had anagram maps created for their metro systems, inspired by the London map. The anagram map was featured in thousands of blogs and its progress can be tracked at Technorati.com. Because of similarities with Neverwhere it was mentioned in the letters page of author Neil Gaiman's blog, with his fanbase ensuring over 1,700 others linked to it. But nearly 21,000 other blogs linked to BoingBoing's article alone. Stations not anagrammatized Blackwall and Hornchurch stations could not be properly anagrammatized and instead were split into their component words and reversed to produce \\"Wall Black\\" and \\"Church Horn\\" respectively. Burch Chow/Chow Burch (from the gynaecological Burch procedure) was rejected as an anagram for Bow Church, because of a dislike for uncommon proper nouns, leaving it reversed as \\"Church Bow\\". Bank was anagrammatized into 'nabk', the edible berry of the Ziziphus lotus tree. Not all derivatives for other cities followed this pattern. For Toronto, the impossible stations were named after streets, so the namesake's designation as \\"Avenue\\" or \\"Street\\" was appended before anagramming (Queen became Queen Street became Queerest Ten).John Martz Illustration and Comics.

It is based on the 2001 book American Hardcore: A Tribal History also written by Blush. It was released on September 22, 2006 on a limited basis. The film features some early pioneers of the hardcore punk music scene including Bad Brains, Black Flag, D.O.A., Minor Threat, Minutemen, SSD, and others. It was released on DVD by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on February 20, 2007. Synopsis The film addresses the birth and evolution of hardcore punk rock from 1978 to 1986 (although the packaging says 1980-1986). The documentary boasts extensive underground footage shot during the height of the hardcore movement. It features exclusive interviews with early hardcore punk music artists from bands such as Black Flag, Minor Threat, Bad Brains, and many more. Production The film was shot and edited for 5 years with many clips of 80s hardcore bands being sent in by the bands themselves. Some of the footage was shot by director Paul Rachman in the 80s with the most notable piece of footage being the final show of Negative FX which spawned a riot after the power was cut mid-song. Many of the interviews were actually done in both Paul Rachman's and Steven Blush's apartments in different areas to make it seem like they were done in different locations. The film also features the photography of Edward Colver notably and principally, and his shot of Danny Spira from Wasted Youth covered in blood was used for the book cover.

According to the legend, Saint Geneviève stopped in the village of Juilly in 470, and a water source suddenly emerged where she prayed. The spot quickly became a pilgrimage place, and the College was built around it. An abbey established itself there during the 12th century, while Blanche of Castile, the mother of Saint-Louis, decided in the 13th century to establish there an orphanage which hosted the children of those knights killed during the Crusades. Joan of Arc might have sojourned there while coming back from Orleans. The monks quit the abbey in 1637 and handed it out to the Oratorians, who created an internship for the education of the French nobility. The abbey then became a Royal Academy, and retains to this day the three fleur-de-lys on its arm. The Juilly College also served many times as a war hospital.

Its capital was located on the Inkisi River, near the present-day village of Mbanza Nsundi in Democratic Republic of Congo.  History  According to traditions retold by Duarte Lopes, Kongo's ambassador to Rome, and published by Filippo Pigafetta in 1591, Nsundi was formerly an independent small kingdom. It was incorporated into Kongo's domains probably in the early to mid-fifteenth century. The province had been expanded earlier east and west along the south bank of the Congo River, and in the late fifteenth century also on the northern bank of the river. In 1491 the kings of Kongo called on Portuguese military forces to aid in putting down a rebellion from sections on both banks of the river. Later tradition suggested that Nsundi was often given to the king's chosen successor to rule. The earliest known ruler of Nsundi was Afonso Mvemba a Nzinga. A son of Nzinga a Nkuwu, who reigned in the late fifteenth century, Afonso Mvemba became king in turn in 1509. But the subsequent history of the country does not support the idea that the heir apparent always held this post, and kings of Kongo came from many different provinces. Nsundi was a royal province, meaning that the king appointed its high official on a limited term, often three years. When King Álvaro II renamed the provincial nobility along European lines in the late sixteenth century, Nsundi was declared a Duchy. One of the more powerful of its dukes, Manuel Jordão, served as something of a king-maker in the period 1624-28. He was humiliated and removed by King Ambrósio I in 1628. During the civil wars that followed the Battle of Mbwila in 1665, Nsundi gradually became more or less independent under a line of dukes from the Kimpanzu branch of the royal family.

The term is partly synonymous with ecological naïvete, which also has a wider meaning referring to the loss of defensive behaviors and adaptations needed to deal with these \\"new\\" predators. Species retain such wariness of predators that exist in their environment, for example a Hawaiian goose retains its wariness of hawks, but loses such behaviors associated with mammals or other predators not found in its historical range. The most famous example is that of the dodo, which owed its extinction in a large part to a lack of fear of humans, and many species of penguin - which, although wary of sea predators, have no real land predators and therefore are very unafraid and curious towards humans. A recent comparison of 66 species of lizards found that flight initiation distance (how close a lizard allows a human \\"predator\\" to approach before it flees) decreases as distance from the mainland increases and is shorter in island than in mainland populations.Cooper, W. E., Jr., R. A. Pyron, and T. Garland, Jr. 2014. Island tameness: living on islands reduces flight initiation distance. Proceedings of the Royal Society B Volume 281 no. 1777 20133019. doi: 10.1098/rspb.2013.3019According to the authors, Charles Darwin believed that escape behavior evolved to be lower where predators were rare or absent on remote islands because unnecessary escape responses are costly in terms of time and energy. Island tameness can be highly maladaptive in situations where humans have introduced predators, intentionally or accidentally, such as dogs, cats, pigs or rats, to islands where ecologically naïve fauna lives. It has also made many island species, such as the long-extinct dodo or the short- tailed albatross, vulnerable to human hunting. In many instances the native species are unable to learn to avoid new predators, or change their behavior to minimize their risk. This tameness is eventually lost or reduced in some species, but many island populations are too small or breed too slowly for the affected species to adapt quickly enough. When combined with other threats, such as habitat loss, this has led to the extinction of many species (such as the Laysan rail and Lyall's wren) and continues to threaten others. The only conservation techniques that can help endangered species threatened by novel introduced species are creating barriers to exclude predators or eradicating those species. New Zealand has pioneered the use of offshore islands free of introduced species to serve as wildlife refuges for ecologically naïve species. A comparable phenomenon may be present in plant species that colonize faraway islands devoid of their natural predators in the continent, then lose anti-browsing measures like spines and toxins. However, this point is in need of further study.Burns, Kevin C. (2019). Evolution in Isolation: The Search for an Island Syndrome in Plants. Cambridge University Press, 236 pages.

Estimates are made by modeling dendrites and axons as cylinders composed of segments with capacitances c_m and resistances r_m combined in parallel (see Fig. 1). The capacitance of a neuronal fiber comes about because electrostatic forces are acting through the very thin lipid bilayer (see Figure 2). The resistance in series along the fiber r_l is due to the axoplasm's significant resistance to movement of electric charge. Figure. 2: Fiber capacitance  History  Cable theory in computational neuroscience has roots leading back to the 1850s, when Professor William Thomson (later known as Lord Kelvin) began developing mathematical models of signal decay in submarine (underwater) telegraphic cables. The models resembled the partial differential equations used by Fourier to describe heat conduction in a wire. The 1870s saw the first attempts by Hermann to model neuronal electrotonic potentials also by focusing on analogies with heat conduction. However, it was Hoorweg who first discovered the analogies with Kelvin's undersea cables in 1898 and then Hermann and Cremer who independently developed the cable theory for neuronal fibers in the early 20th century. Further mathematical theories of nerve fiber conduction based on cable theory were developed by Cole and Hodgkin (1920s–1930s), Offner et al. (1940), and Rushton (1951). Experimental evidence for the importance of cable theory in modelling the behavior of axons began surfacing in the 1930s from work done by Cole, Curtis, Hodgkin, Sir Bernard Katz, Rushton, Tasaki and others. Two key papers from this era are those of Davis and Lorente de Nó (1947) and Hodgkin and Rushton (1946). The 1950s saw improvements in techniques for measuring the electric activity of individual neurons. Thus cable theory became important for analyzing data collected from intracellular microelectrode recordings and for analyzing the electrical properties of neuronal dendrites. Scientists like Coombs, Eccles, Fatt, Frank, Fuortes and others now relied heavily on cable theory to obtain functional insights of neurons and for guiding them in the design of new experiments. Later, cable theory with its mathematical derivatives allowed ever more sophisticated neuron models to be explored by workers such as Jack, Rall, Redman, Rinzel, Idan Segev, Tuckwell, Bell, and Iannella.  Deriving the cable equation  Note, various conventions of rm exist. Here rm and cm, as introduced above, are measured per membrane-length unit (per meter (m)). Thus rm is measured in ohm·meters (Ω·m) and cm in farads per meter (F/m). This is in contrast to Rm (in Ω·m²) and Cm (in F/m²), which represent the specific resistance and capacitance respectively of one unit area of membrane (in m2). Thus, if the radius, a, of the axon is known, then its circumference is 2πa, and its rm, and its cm values can be calculated as: These relationships make sense intuitively, because the greater the circumference of the axon, the greater the area for charge to escape through its membrane, and therefore the lower the membrane resistance (dividing Rm by 2πa); and the more membrane available to store charge (multiplying Cm by 2πa). The specific electrical resistance, ρl, of the axoplasm allows one to calculate the longitudinal intracellular resistance per unit length, rl, (in Ω·m−1) by the equation: The greater the cross sectional area of the axon, πa², the greater the number of paths for the charge to flow through its axoplasm, and the lower the axoplasmic resistance. Several important avenues of extending classical cable theory have recently seen the introduction of endogenous structures in order to analyze the effects of protein polarization within dendrites and different synaptic input distributions over the dendritic surface of a neuron. To better understand how the cable equation is derived, first simplify the theoretical neuron even further and pretend it has a perfectly sealed membrane (rm=∞) with no loss of current to the outside, and no capacitance (cm = 0). A current injected into the fiber at position x = 0 would move along the inside of the fiber unchanged. Moving away from the point of injection and by using Ohm's law (V = IR) we can calculate the voltage change as: where the negative is because current flows down the potential gradient. Letting Δx go towards zero and having infinitely small increments of x, one can write () as: or Bringing rm back into the picture is like making holes in a garden hose. The more holes, the faster the water will escape from the hose, and the less water will travel all the way from the beginning of the hose to the end. Similarly, in an axon, some of the current traveling longitudinally through the axoplasm will escape through the membrane. If im is the current escaping through the membrane per length unit, m, then the total current escaping along y units must be y·im. Thus, the change of current in the axoplasm, Δil, at distance, Δx, from position x=0 can be written as: or, using continuous, infinitesimally small increments: i_m can be expressed with yet another formula, by including the capacitance. The capacitance will cause a flow of charge (a current) towards the membrane on the side of the cytoplasm. This current is usually referred to as displacement current (here denoted i_c.) The flow will only take place as long as the membrane's storage capacity has not been reached. i_c can then be expressed as: where c_m is the membrane's capacitance and {\\\\partial V}/{\\\\partial t} is the change in voltage over time. The current that passes the membrane (i_r) can be expressed as: and because i_m = i_r + i_c the following equation for i_m can be derived if no additional current is added from an electrode: where {\\\\partial i_l}/{\\\\partial x} represents the change per unit length of the longitudinal current. Combining equations () and () gives a first version of a cable equation: which is a second-order partial differential equation (PDE). By a simple rearrangement of equation () (see later) it is possible to make two important terms appear, namely the length constant (sometimes referred to as the space constant) denoted \\\\lambda and the time constant denoted \\\\tau. The following sections focus on these terms.  Length constant  The length constant, \\\\lambda (lambda), is a parameter that indicates how far a stationary current will influence the voltage along the cable. The larger the value of \\\\lambda, the farther the charge will flow. The length constant can be expressed as: The larger the membrane resistance, rm, the greater the value of \\\\lambda, and the more current will remain inside the axoplasm to travel longitudinally through the axon. The higher the axoplasmic resistance, r_l, the smaller the value of \\\\lambda, the harder it will be for current to travel through the axoplasm, and the shorter the current will be able to travel. It is possible to solve equation () and arrive at the following equation (which is valid in steady-state conditions, i.e. when time approaches infinity): }} Where V_0 is the depolarization at x=0 (point of current injection), e is the exponential constant (approximate value 2.71828) and V_x is the voltage at a given distance x from x=0. When x=\\\\lambda then and which means that when we measure V at distance \\\\lambda from x=0 we get Thus V_\\\\lambda is always 36.8 percent of V_0.  Time constant  Neuroscientists are often interested in knowing how fast the membrane potential, V_m, of an axon changes in response to changes in the current injected into the axoplasm. The time constant, \\\\tau, is an index that provides information about that value. \\\\tau can be calculated as: The larger the membrane capacitance, c_m, the more current it takes to charge and discharge a patch of membrane and the longer this process will take. The larger the membrane resistance r_m , the harder it is for a current to induce a change in membrane potential. So the higher the \\\\tau the slower the nerve impulse can travel. That means, membrane potential (voltage across the membrane) lags more behind current injections. Response times vary from 1–2 milliseconds in neurons that are processing information that needs high temporal precision to 100 milliseconds or longer. A typical response time is around 20 milliseconds.  Generic form and mathematical structure  If one multiplies equation () by r_m on both sides of the equal sign we get: and recognize \\\\lambda^2 = {r_m}/{r_l} on the left side and \\\\tau = c_m r_m on the right side. The cable equation can now be written in its perhaps best known form: This is a 1D Heat equation or Diffusion Equation for which many solution methods, such as Green's functions and Fourier methods, have been developed. It is also a special degenerate case of the Telegrapher's equation, where the inductance L vanishes and the signal propagation speed 1/\\\\sqrt{LC} is infinite.

History It is sometimes used in the same sense as competency. Owing to the many charges to which a benefice is liable, it became necessary for the ecclesiastical authority to decree that first and foremost the proper sustenance of the holder of the benefice should be provided for, and that a minimum revenue should be determined, below which his income was not to fall. This was all the more necessary in cases where benefices had been incorporated with monasteries or collegiate churches. Very often the curate of such incorporated benefices received only one-sixteenth of the revenue. To remedy this abuse a number of ordinances were passed which reserved to the person having cure of souls a decent subsistence. The Council of Trent (Sess. XXI, c. iv, de Ref.) leaves the determination of the congrua to the judgment of the bishop. This sum must, of course, vary with the fluctuation of values at different times. It must not be so parsimoniously fixed as to provide for the beneficiary the mere necessaries of life. To be a proper income in accordance with the dignity of his state, it should likewise be sufficient to enable him to dispense moderate hospitality and almsgiving and supply himself with books, etc. The Council of Trent did not determine the amount of the congrua but suggested that about one-third of the revenue of the benefice should be assigned to the vicar. When the benefice can not furnish a proper sustenance, it is the duty of the bishop to see that several benefices be united or that the deficit be made up from other sources, as tithes, collections, etc. If these means fail, the benefice must be suppressed. In determining the congrua, the bishop can not take into consideration emoluments that are uncertain, such as offerings at funerals or marriages, or Mass Stipends; nor what the vicar might earn by his labour; nor what he receives from his patrimony; for these are not fruits of the benefice. When the congrua has been fixed for a certain benefice, it is always presumed to be sufficient, unless it be proved to have been lessened. Hence, if the beneficiary declare the congrua to be insufficient, especially when it has sufficed for his predecessors, the burden of proof rests on him. If the congrua had been sufficient at the time a pension was reserved to another from the fruits of the benefice and later became insufficient, the amount necessary to provide proper sustenance must be taken from the pension, for those who have cure of souls are to be preferred to pensioners. Even a curate who is removable and a temporary vicar are to have a congrua assigned to them. Although, in speaking of the congrua, authors generally limit the question to the inferior clergy, yet all rectors of churches, hence also bishops, are entitled to it. The Council of Trent (Sess. XXIV, cap. xiii) declared that a cathedral church whose revenue did not exceed one thousand scudi (about one thousand dollars circa 1900) should not be burdened with pensions or reservations. The bishop is entitled to an income that will allow him to live according to his dignity. If he have a coadjutor, the ordinary must provide a congrua for him. In many European countries, where church property has passed into the possession of the State, the civil laws have determined the congrua of the clergy more or less liberally. Such laws came in force early in Austria and Germany, and until the end of 1905 existed in France. The salary for rectors of churches in the United States, fixed by plenary or diocesan synods, has nothing in common with the canonical congrua.

The name Havoth-Jair can mean hamlets of Jair, and the bible portrays these as having been founded by a person named Jair who conquered the previous towns and villages in these locations; in the case of the villages with Machir ancestry it is a Jair named as a son of Manassah, while those with Gilead ancestry are identified as being founded by a Jair who is a Gileadite.

She served as a commissioned ship for 11 years. Libra (AK-53) was laid down as Jean Lykes by Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, Kearny, N.J., under contract for Lykes Brothers Steamship Company, Galveston, Texas; launched 12 November 1941; sponsored by Lindy Boggs, wife of Congressman Hale Boggs of Louisiana; acquired by the Navy on 30 December 1941; named Libra on 9 January 1942; and commissioned on 13 May 1942, Comdr. W. B. Fletcher in command. Libra received nine battle stars for World War II service. Operational history=World War IISolomons and Bougainville campaigns= Completing conversion at New York City on 26 May 1942, Libra loaded combat equipment at Hampton Roads and sailed on 10 June for Wellington, New Zealand, arriving 11 July. Laden with cargo for the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force, she sailed 22 July for rehearsals in the Fijis for the first Allied offensive of the Pacific War, the Solomons campaign. Libra arrived off Tulagi on 7 August, and began an unloading interrupted six times in the next three days, as enemy air attack caused her to go to general quarters and stand off to maneuver in open waters. In the early morning 9 August she heard heavy gunfire to the northwest, where Allied warships engaged the Japanese in the Battle of Savo Island, fighting to protect the transports and their vital cargo. Later the same day, empty, she sailed for Wellington, arriving 20 August. For the next three months, Libra sailed from Noumea to the Ellice Islands and Espiritu Santo, base for the Guadalcanal operation, building up supplies. She returned to Guadalcanal 11 November, and her group almost immediately came under enemy air attack. The determined enemy sent another seven planes against the transports next day; all were splashed by Libra and her sisters. She sailed for Espiritu Santo on 13 November as the Battle of Guadalcanal, just south of Savo Island, raged to a victory which gave the Allies sea control off the southern Solomons. Returning to Espiritu Santo on 15 November, Libra prepared for two additional voyages to Guadalcanal during the next month, bringing cargo essential to the epic struggles of the marines to wrest the island from the Japanese. From mid-December 1942 through March 1943, Libra, redesignated AKA-12 on 1 February, carried war equipment from New Zealand to bases in the New Hebrides. Joining the 3rd Fleet on 20 March, she returned to Guadalcanal on 3 April, and four days later joined in fighting off land-based enemy aircraft. She returned to Espiritu Santo on 10 April, and during the next 80 days made four voyages carrying cargo for the occupation of Guadalcanal. For her superlative performance of duty through the Guadalcanal campaign, Libra received the Navy Unit Commendation. She earned it in part on 30 June, when, unloading cargo at Rendova, her task group came under heavy enemy air attack. Deadly anti-aircraft fire downed 17 of the 25 attacking torpedo planes before they could launch torpedoes, but some got through to strike after passing under Libra, unladen and high in the water. Libra took the stricken transport in tow. Later the same day, the two were attacked by eight dive bombers, three of whom they splashed. Relieved of the tow later that afternoon, Libra returned to Guadalcanal. Aside from a repair period in New Zealand in August, Libra gave the next four months to building up the base on Guadalcanal with cargo from New Caledonia, then was part of the assault force for Bougainville, arriving Empress Augusta Bay on 1 November. Promptly unloading, she sailed the same day for Guadalcanal for additional cargo, with which she arrived Bougainville on 8 November, immediately to splash one of 25 dive bombers attacking her transport group. Libra carried cargo among the New Hebrides, Solomons, and Marshalls until June 1944, when she prepared for the assault on Guam. Arriving off Guam from Eniwetok on 21 July, she quickly discharged heavy equipment for the 3rd Marines on the Asan beaches, then sailed for San Francisco, arriving from Pearl Harbor on 19 August. =Leyte= Overhauled, Libra sailed from San Francisco on 20 October for Milne Bay, New Guinea, and Manus, where she readied for the Lingayen Gulf landings. She entered the Gulf on 11 January 1945, off-loaded her vital cargo, and sailed for Leyte, Ulithi, and Guam. Her final amphibious operation was the Battle of Iwo Jima, off which she arrived 19 February. For two weeks she maneuvered off the volcanic beaches, avoiding enemy shore batteries as she landed marine combat gear. For the remainder of the war, Libra carried cargo from Noumea to Leyte and intermediate ports. Post World War II In the first of her post-war cargo runs supporting the occupation of Japan, she entered Tokyo Bay on 2 September. Duty complete by 21 November, Libra steamed for Seattle, arriving 30 November. Serving with the U.S. Pacific Fleet out of San Francisco for the next two years, Libra made four voyages to the western Pacific for essential cargo operations. She departed Guam on 6 October 1947 for Hawaii, the Panama Canal, and Boston, where she arrived on 26 November. Here she decommissioned on 19 April 1948 and entered the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. Korean War With the increased demand on cargo facilities brought on by the Korean War, Libra recommissioned 28 August 1950 to join the Amphibious Force, Atlantic Fleet, supporting its training operations along the east coast and in the Caribbean. She served in the Mediterranean with the 6th Fleet from 18 January to 12 May 1954, then trained reservists, sailing often with them to the Caribbean. Decommissioned Libra was decommissioned on 6 October 1955, to join the Reserve Fleet at James River Va., where she remained until transferred to the Maritime Administration in July 1964. The ship was redesignated LKA-12 (Amphibious Transport) on 1 January 1969. She entered the National Defense Reserve Fleet, struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 January 1977, and sold for scrapping on 17 April 1985.https://pmars.marad.dot.gov/detail.asp?Ship=3018 MARAD record of ship disposal References * External links Military.com: USS Libra * 51 Years of AKAs Arcturus-class attack cargo ships Type C2-F ships of the United States Navy Ships built in Kearny, New Jersey 1941 ships World War II auxiliary ships of the United States ","title":"USS Libra (AKA-12)"},{"id":"6300020","text":"The finback catsharks are a small family, the Proscylliidae, of ground sharks. They can be found in warm seas worldwide and are often the most numerous and common shark in tropical regions. They are generally less than 1 m in length, and are slow-moving predators that feed on bony fish and small invertebrates. Although some bear live young, the majority lay eggs with almost fully developed young; these egg cases, known as \\"mermaid's purses\\", are unique in appearance to each species.  Taxonomy = Genus Proscyllium * Graceful catshark (Proscyllium habereri) was first discovered by Hildendorf in 1901. * Proscyllium venustum is found in temperate regions. It is distributed along the Northwest Pacific, primarily Japan. These sharks are oviparous; they lay eggs in pairs in which the embryos feed solely on yolk. This species is considered harmless to humans. * Magnificent catshark (Proscyllium magnificum) A newly discovered species within the family Proscyllidae, it has little supporting research. It is tan in coloration with dark spots and blotches. The body is considered slender and firm. This species grows to be at least 450 mm in length. They have been found in tropical waters throughout the eastern Indian Ocean off the coast of Myanmar.  Genus Eridacnis * Pygmy ribbontail catshark (Eridacnis radcliffei) It is known to be one of the smallest sharks within its species, with a maximum length around 257 mm. It is distributed in the waters surrounding the Philippines, along with the Indo- West Pacific Ocean. They are found located near muddy bottoms of the continental shelves. It is not a species directly targeted by the fishing industry; however, it is negatively impacted as bycatch by the shrimping industry due to shrimp being its primary food source. They are considered harmless to humans. * Cuban ribbontail catshark (Eridacnis barbouri), can be found in deep water along the upper continental shelf. They are distributed throughout the western central Atlantic. Their primary food source is small fishes, crustaceans, and cephalopods. Having two young per litter, ranging in size at birth to over 10 cm, this species is ovoviviparous. This species is viewed as harmless to humans. * African ribbontail catshark (Eridacnis sinuans), is grey-brown in color. They are distributed within the western Indian Ocean, but confined to the South Africa, Mozambique, and Tanzania. This species is primarily found along the upper continental shelf in deep water. This species feeds on small bony fishes, crustaceans, and cephalopods. Their ovoviviparous reproductive system allows them to have two young per litter between 15 and 17 cm in length when born. This species is also considered harmless to humans.  Genus Ctenacis The harlequin catshark (Ctenacis fehlmanni) has some unique characteristics that set it aside from the others. Its large mouth, small teeth and large pharynx with gill raker papillae make it unique among the family Proscyllidae. They are found in the tropical outer continental shelves of the western Indian Ocean, off the coast of Somalia. They are oviparous, laying paired eggs in which their embryos feed solely on yolk.  Distribution  Found primarily along the continental shelves, these species are scattered throughout the world. They have been documented and seen primarily in: Japan, Myanmar, the Philippines, South Africa, Mozambique, Tanzania, and Somalia.  Lifecycle = Reproduction  Within this family, species are either oviparous or ovoviparous. Oviparous refers to many benthic sharks that lay their eggs on the seafloor and attach them to a substrate. The eggs have a hard and leathery shell surrounding them to serve as protection. The eggs feed solely on the yolk present within the casing. Other species within this family are ovoviviparous. Ovoviviparous sharks give birth to live young.  Human interactions  This family of small ground sharks is not targeted by humans for any fishing or food purposes. Although not endangered or threatened, these species are negatively impacted by fisheries as a result of bycatch. The shrimping industry has affected them the most.

In 2004 it was sold for $3.5M and is currently displayed at the Pera Museum in Istanbul. In the Tortoise Trainer, Osman Hamdi Bey satirises the slow and ineffective attempts at reforming the Ottoman Empire, through the attempts of an anachronistic historical character to train tortoises. The painting depicts an elderly man in traditional Ottoman religious costume which predates the introduction of the fez and the spread of Western style dress with the Tanzimat reforms in the mid 19th century. He holds a traditional ney flute with which he is attempting to \\"train\\" the tortoises at his feet. Historic context Osman Hamdi Bey created the painting at a time of great social and political turmoil in the Ottoman Empire. The reforms introduced by Sultan Abdülhamid II had either proved ineffective, or had been blamed for the increased upheaval. The Ottoman Empire, which still encompassed parts of the Balkan peninsula, parts of North Africa (specifically Libya), all of Anatolia and the Levant, and much of the Arabian peninsula at the turn of the 20th century, was under serious threat from both the growing power of nationalist movements within its territory, and from the incursions of foreign powers which would eventually divide the Empire between them in the aftermath of the First World War. Although not widely shown or understood at the time, the painting achieved greater significance in subsequent decades as it presaged the Young Turk Revolution of 1908 which brought an end to the direct autocratic rule by the Sultan (eventually replaced by the regime of the Three Pashas after the 1913 coup d'état) and set the stage for the Empire's entry into the First World War on the side of the Central Powers and for its subsequent partitioning.

It flows north from Lake Edward to Lake Albert in the Albertine Rift west of the Rwenzori Mountains. Along its lower reaches, it forms part of the international border between the DRC and the western Ugandan district of Bundibugyo, near the Semuliki National Park. It empties into Lake Albert slightly west of the border in Orientale Province of the DRC. Increasing snowmelt from the Rwenzoris, overgrazing, and other alterations to the watershed have caused bank erosion and frequent changes to the course of the meandering lower reaches of the river. In some places, Uganda is losing up to of land per year on its side of the river to erosion and silt from the Semliki is gradually filling in the southern end of Lake Albert. In other places, it is the DRC that is losing territory as the changing river course alters the apparent location of the border. Course The Semliki begins near Ishango, DRC, at the northern end of Lake Edward and soon enters Virunga National Park, through which it flows over much of its upper course. The A-109 road between Mpondwe, Uganda, and Beni, DRC, is on the right, sometimes nearby and sometimes at a distance, as the river meanders through the park. Slightly southeast of Beni, the river passes under the A-109 road and continues north. At this point, the stream is west of Mount Baker (Kiyanja) in Rwenzori Mountains National Park in Uganda. Before leaving the park, the river passes under another road linking the DRC settlement of Oicha to settlements in the Semliki Valley west of the DRC-Uganda border and the Uganda town of Bundibugyo. Downstream of the road crossing, the river leaves the Virunga Park and runs along the west edge of Semuliki National Park, which is in Uganda. Here the river becomes the border between the DRC and Uganda, and it remains the border for most of the rest of the river's course. As the river leaves Semuliki Park, it nears Sempaya National Park and the Toro Game Reserve, both in Uganda. Over its last reach, the river flows west of the international border and enters the southern end of Lake Albert at a point southeast of Bunia, DRC. People The two main ethnic groups in the region are the Amba people (Baamba, Bwamba) and the Bakonjo (Konjo). People in the Semliki Valley include Batuku, pastoral cattle keepers whose herds graze on grasslands along the river. Small populations of Batwa (pygmies), who have traditionally been forest hunter-gatherers, also live in the valley. Flora and fauna In Semuliki National Park, the forest resembles that of the Congo River basin. Cynometra alexandri, a tropical tree species, dominates but is interspersed with other trees and swamp flora. Annual rainfall in this tropical forest averages . More than 400 bird species, including the forest ground-thrush, Sassi's olive greenbul, and nine species of hornbill frequent the park, as do over 450 species of butterflies. Among the mammals in the park are elephants, leopard, African golden cat, buffalo, hippopotami, duikers, and pygmy scaly-tailed flying squirrels. Along its course, the Semliki falls about through a series of rapids, and this isolates Lake Edward's fish species, many of them found no-where else, from those found downriver in Lake Albert (and consequently the Nile).

It is used by the operating system kernel for task management. Specifically, the following information is stored in the TSS: * Processor register state * I/O port permissions * Inner-level stack pointers * Previous TSS link All this information should be stored at specific locations within the TSS as specified in the IA-32 manuals. Location of the TSS The TSS may reside anywhere in memory. A segment register called the task register (TR) holds a segment selector that points to a valid TSS segment descriptor which resides in the GDT (a TSS descriptor may not reside in the LDT). Therefore, to use a TSS the following must be done by the operating system kernel: # Create a TSS descriptor entry in the GDT # Load the TR with the segment selector for that segment # Add information to the TSS in memory as needed For security purposes, the TSS should be placed in memory that is accessible only to the kernel. Task register The TR register is a 16-bit register which holds a segment selector for the TSS. It may be loaded through the LTR instruction. LTR is a privileged instruction and acts in a manner similar to other segment register loads. The task register has two parts: a portion visible and accessible by the programmer and an invisible one that is automatically loaded from the TSS descriptor. Register states The TSS may contain saved values of all the x86 registers. This is used for task switching. The operating system may load the TSS with the values of the registers that the new task needs and after executing a hardware task switch (such as with an IRET instruction) the x86 CPU will load the saved values from the TSS into the appropriate registers. Note that some modern operating systems such as Windows and Linux do not use these fields in the TSS as they implement software task switching. Note that during a hardware task switch, certain fields of the old TSS are updated with the CPU's current register contents before the values from the new TSS are read. Thus some TSS fields are read/write, while others are read-only: * Read/Write fields: read and written during a hardware task switch. ** All general-purpose registers (\`EAX\`, \`EBX\`, \`ECX\`, \`EDX\`, \`ESI\`, \`EDI\`, \`EBP\`, \`ESP\`); ** All segment registers (\`CS\`, \`DS\`, \`ES\`, \`FS\`, \`GS\`, \`SS\`); ** Current execution state (\`EIP\`, \`EFlags\`); ** The \`Link\` field in the new TSS, if the task switch was due to a \`CALL\` or \`INT\` rather than a \`JMP\`. * Read-only fields: read only when required, as indicated. ** Control Register 3 (\`CR3\`), also known as the Page Directory Base Register (\`PDBR\`). **: Read during a hardware task switch. ** The Local Descriptor Table register (\`LDTR\`); **: Read during a hardware task switch. ** The three privilege-level stack pairs (\`SS0:ESP0\`, \`SS1:ESP1\`, \`SS2:ESP2\`); **: Read during an inter-level \`CALL\` or \`INT\` to establish a new stack. ** The IO Port Bitmap pointer (\`IOPB\`) and the I/O Port Bitmap itself; **: Read during an \`IN\`, \`OUT\`, \`INS\` or \`OUTS\` instruction if \`CPL > IOPL\` to confirm the instruction is legal (see I/O port permissions below). The \`PDBR\` field is in fact the very first one read out of the new TSS: since a hardware task switch can also switch to a completely different page table mapping, all the other fields (especially the \`LDTR\`) are relative to the new mapping. I/O port permissions The TSS contains a 16-bit pointer to I/O port permissions bitmap for the current task. This bitmap, usually set up by the operating system when a task is started, specifies individual ports to which the program should have access. The I/O bitmap is a bit array of port access permissions; if the program has permission to access a port, a \\"0\\" is stored at the corresponding bit index, and if the program does not have permission, a \\"1\\" is stored there. If the TSS’ segment limit is less than the full bitmap, all missing bits are assumed to be \\"1\\". The feature operates as follows: when a program issues an x86 I/O port instruction such as IN or OUT (see x86 instruction listings - and note that there are byte-, word- and dword-length versions), the hardware will do an I/O privilege level (IOPL) check to see if the program has access to all I/O ports. If the Current Privilege Level (CPL) of the program is numerically greater than the I/O Privilege level (IOPL) (the program is less-privileged than what the IOPL specifies), the program does not have I/O port access to all ports. The hardware will then check the I/O permissions bitmap in the TSS to see if that program can access the specific port(s) in the IN or OUT instruction. If (all the) relevant bit(s) in the I/O port permissions bitmap is/are clear, the program is allowed access to the port(s), and the instruction is allowed to execute. If (any of) the relevant bit(s) is/are set - or if (any of) the bit(s) is/are past the TSS’ segment limit - the program does not have access and the processor generates a general protection fault. This feature allows operating systems to grant selective port access to user programs. Inner-level stack pointers The TSS contains 6 fields for specifying the new stack pointer when a privilege level change happens. The field SS0 contains the stack segment selector for CPL=0, and the field ESP0/RSP0 contains the new ESP/RSP value for CPL=0. When an interrupt happens in protected (32-bit) mode, the x86 CPU will look in the TSS for SS0 and ESP0 and load their values into SS and ESP respectively. This allows for the kernel to use a different stack than the user program, and also have this stack be unique for each user program. A new feature introduced in the AMD64 extensions is called the Interrupt Stack Table (IST), which also resides in the TSS and contains logical (segment+offset) stack pointers. If an interrupt descriptor table specifies an IST entry to use (there are 8), the processor will load the new stack from the IST instead. This allows known-good stacks to be used in case of serious errors (NMI or Double fault for example). Previously, the entry for the exception or interrupt in the IDT pointed to a task gate, causing the processor to switch to the task that is pointed by the task gate. The original register values were saved in the TSS current at the time the interrupt or exception occurred. The processor then set the registers, including SS:ESP, to a known value specified in the TSS and saved the selector to the previous TSS. The problem here is that hardware task switching is not supported on AMD64. Previous TSS link This is a 16-bit selector which allows linking this TSS with the previous one. This is only used for hardware task switching. See the IA-32 manuals for details. Use of TSS in Linux Although a TSS could be created for each task running on the computer, Linux kernel only creates one TSS for each CPU and uses them for all tasks. This approach was selected as it provides easier portability to other architectures (for example, the AMD64 architecture does not support hardware task switches), and improved performance and flexibility. Linux only uses the I/O port permission bitmap and inner stack features of the TSS; the other features are only needed for hardware task switches, which the Linux kernel does not use. Exceptions related to the TSS The x86 exception vector 10 is called the Invalid TSS exception (#TS). It is issued by the processor whenever something goes wrong with the TSS access. For example, if an interrupt happens in CPL=3 and is transferring control to CPL=0, the TSS is used to extract SS0 and ESP0/RSP0 for the stack switch. If the task register holds a bad TSS selector, a #TS fault will be generated. The Invalid TSS exception should never happen during normal operating system operation and is always related to kernel bugs or hardware failure. For more details on TSS exceptions, see Volume 3a, Chapter 6 of the IA-32 manual. TSS in x86-64 mode The x86-64 architecture does not support hardware task switches. However the TSS can still be used in a machine running in the 64 bit extended modes. In these modes the TSS is still useful as it stores: # The stack pointer addresses for each privilege level. # Pointer Addresses for the Interrupt Stack Table (The inner-level stack pointer section above, discusses the need for this). # Offset Address of the IO permission bitmap. Also, the task register is expanded in these modes to be able to hold a 64-bit base address.

(August 2, 1894 in San Francisco – May 10, 1974 in Santa Monica, California) was a famed movie cinematographer. He is known for his Oscar-winning work on the 1935 film, A Midsummer Night's Dream. He was awarded another Oscar for his work on The Phantom of the Opera in 1943, and received a nomination for The Four Poster in 1952.  Career  From a young age, Hal Mohr wanted to pursue a career in cinematography because he was curious to learn about how to make pictures move onscreen. He worked as a photo finisher in a photo lab to gain experience with the camera. When he was 19 years old, he filmed his first movie, Pam's Daughter, which, unfortunately, was never seen by the public because of problems with the motion picture distribution company. Mohr moved to Hollywood in 1915 and began working at Universal City to gain further experience in the industry. There, filmed The Jazz Singer in 1927 for Warner Brothers. In 1915, in an early example of an exploitation film peddled directly to theater owners, Mohr and Sol Lesser produced and directed a film The Last Night of the Barbary Coast. This film purported to show the last night of the depraved Barbary Coast red-light district of San Francisco before it was shut down by the police. (The area was not actually closed down until 1917.) This is now considered a lost film. Although Mohr mainly worked as a cinema portraitist on movies such as The Wedding March, A Midsummer Night's Dream, and the Technicolor The Phantom of the Opera, he was passionate about exploring the limits of the camera. Mohr shot in deep focus years before Gregg Toland – Bullets or Ballots and The Green Pastures were both shot in deep focus. He was inspired by the moving shots in the Italian movie, Cabiria, and developed a camera with special tracking abilities for his 1914 film, Pan's Mountain. Notably, Mohr is the only person to have won a competitive Academy Award without being nominated for it. In 1936, a write-in campaign won him the Best Cinematography Oscar for his work on A Midsummer Night's Dream (1935). The Academy later changed the Oscar rules, making write-in voting impossible. In 1944, Mohr became the first person to win an Oscar for both Black-and-White and Color cinematography when he won his second Academy Award, this time with W. Howard Greene for Best Cinematography in a Color Film, for their work on The Phantom of the Opera (1943). Mohr was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Cinematographer for his work on The Four Poster (1952), a film based on a play of the same name, written by Jan de Hartog. He was also nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Cinematography in a Black and White Film, for his work on the same movie. Other film cinematographer credits include Little Annie Rooney (1925), The Big Gamble (1931), Cheers for Miss Bishop (1941), Another Part of the Forest (1948) and The Wild One (1953). Mohr served as president of the American Society of Cinematographers from 1930 to 1931. Then, for two terms from 1963 to 1965 and finally from 1969 to 1970. He was one of the first members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and a senior member of the Academy's Board of Directors. He headed the Academy's Cinematography Branch for over 20 years, and was also a part of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. Before his death, he would travel the country promoting cameramen and the industry of cinematography. For his many contributions to motion pictures and the film industry, Hal Mohr received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 6433 Hollywood Blvd.  Personal life  On December 7, 1934, Mohr married actress Evelyn Venable, whom he met on the set of the Will Rogers film David Harum. Strict vegetarians, they had two daughters, Dolores and Rosalia, and the couple remained married until his death in 1974.

In particular, the lower electricity demand of such heat pumps is related to the liquid pumping only. Their applications are restricted to those cases when electricity is extremely expensive or a large amount of unutilized heat at suitable temperatures is available and when the cooling or heating output has a greater value than heat input consumed. Absorption refrigerators also work on the same principle, but are not reversible and cannot serve as a heat source.[citation needed]  Operating principles  The heat pump system is made up of some main units such as the generator, condenser, evaporator, absorber and heat exchanger, as well as the suction device, shielding pump (solution pump and refrigerant pump). In the simplest case, five heat exchangers are also required (at each component and an internal heat exchanger). Other components include solution heat exchangers, valves, as well as the suction device, shielding pump (solution pump and refrigerant pump) and other auxiliary parts. For the absorption heat pump circulation, the absorber, generator and pump can be regarded as a \\"thermal compressor\\". The absorber is equivalent to the inlet side of the compressor, and the generator is equivalent to the outlet side of the compressor. The absorbent can be regarded as a carrier liquid that transports the generated refrigerant gas from the low-pressure side of the cycle to the high-pressure side. Since the main components of devices that achieve three purposes are the same, there is a heat pump that enables it to realize all working modes: heat pump mode, cooler mode and heat transformer mode. The absorption heat pump can be used as a cooler during summer while, during winter, it can be used on heat pump or heat transformer mode according to the available heat source. The performance of the absorption heat pump is indicated by the coefficient of performance (COP). The COP is the ratio of the removed (for refrigeration) or provided (for heating) heat to the energy input. At present, the maximum temperature of its output does not exceed 150 °C. The temperature rise ΔT is generally 30-50 °C. The cooling performance coefficient is 0.8 to 1.6, the heating performance coefficient is 1.2 to 2.5, and the heat transfer performance coefficient is 0.4 to 0.5. When they are applied in industry, the absorption heat pumps should be properly placed in terms of energy and they must satisfy the limitations of special features of the surroundings.  AHP types = Type 1: conventional heat pumps  308x308px Absorption heat pump temperature (type 1); Q2-driving high temperature flow (desorber); Q0-low temperature flow (evaporator); Q1-intermediate heat flow (condenser). Classified by temperature, AHPs can be divided into two categories. In type 1 AHP, the condenser temperature is higher than evaporator temperature (also referred to as heat amplifier and refrigeration). Driven by a high-temperature heat source, the first type absorption heat pump extracts the heat of waste heat (waste heat) and outputs a medium-temperature heat medium that is 30-60 degrees Celsius higher than the waste heat. This type is more common and could be an alternative to traditional compression machines. The coefficient of performance of the first type absorption heat pump is greater than 1, generally 1.5 to 2.5. The heat pump is composed of the main components such as generators, condenser, evaporator, absorber and heat exchanger, as well as the suction device, shielding pump (solution pump and refrigerant pump), and other auxiliary parts. The air extraction device removes the non-condensable gas in the heat pump and keeps the heat pump always in a high vacuum state. Absorption heat pump process scheme (type 2)  Type 2: heat transformer heat pumps  In type 2 AHP, condenser temperature is lower than evaporator temperature (also referred to as heat transformer). The type 2 absorption heat pump uses the heat of the medium-temperature waste heat intelligently, output high-temperature heat medium (hot water steam) 25-50 degrees Celsius higher than medium temperature waste heat. The type 2 absorption heat pump could be driven by low-grade waste heat in the production process or in nature, which can achieve energy saving and emission reduction and reduce production costs, and it has practical application in petrochemical and coal chemical industries. The coefficient of performance of the second type absorption heat pump is always less than 1, generally 0.4 to 0.5. Absorption heat pump temperature (type 2); Q1-intermediate driven heat flow (evaporator); Q2-high temperature revalued flow (absorber); Q0-low temperature rejected flow (condenser).  Typical working fluids  A mixture of fluid is used as the working fluid, different concentrations of the working fluid correspond to different temperatures, the temperature and concentration of working fluid undergo a cyclic change. When the generator is supplied with heat, the temperature of the mixture rises, thereby increase the concentration of high- boiling components (absorbent) and release the refrigerant. When refrigerant is mixed with refrigerant are in the absorber, heat is released. Several types of the mixture could be used in the absorption unit but water/lithium bromide and ammonia/water are the common choices.  Water and Lithium bromide (LiBr)  259x259px Water is the refrigerant and LiBr the absorption medium. Water and LiBr systems have bigger capacities and are applied in a broad range in the industry, the sizes vary from tens of kW to several MW. The first type of lithium bromide absorption heat pump unit is a high-temperature heat source (steam, high-temperature hot water, fuel oil, gas) as the driving heat source, lithium bromide solution as the absorbent, and water as the refrigerant, and the low-temperature heat source (such as waste hot water) is recycled and used.[citation needed]  Ammonia and water  Ammonia is the refrigerant and water the absorption medium. In the absorber and generator, the absorption or effect of the ammonia aqueous solution is used to radiate heat or absorb heat. In the evaporator and condenser, the phase change of pure ammonia is used to complete the external absorption or heat release. Like a traditional heat pump, the refrigerant (ammonia) is condensed in the condenser, and heat is then released; the pressure is dropped after the expansion unit and the refrigerant is evaporated to absorb heat.[citation needed] The ammonia/water heat pumps are essentially limited to residential applications because they are only commercially limited to small sizes (a few KW). If the system absorbs heat from the residential building, it works as a refrigeration machine; if it releases heat to the interior of a residential building, it heats the house. The key component of heat pumps using ammonia and water on the market today is the generator absorber heat exchanger (GAX), which improves the thermal efficiency of the equipment by recovering the heat released when ammonia is absorbed into the water. Other innovations applied to this type of heat pump include efficient steam separation, variable ammonia flow, and variable capacity, and low-emission capacity-variable gas combustion.  Thermal energy sources = Solar thermal  Single, double, or triple iterative absorption cooling cycles are used in different solar-thermal-cooling system designs. The more cycles, the more efficient they are.[citation needed] In the late 19th century, the most common phase change refrigerant material for absorption cooling was a solution of ammonia and water. Today, the combination of lithium bromide and water is also in common use. One end of the system of expansion/condensation pipes is heated, and the other end gets cold enough to make ice. Originally, natural gas was used as a heat source in the late 19th century. Today, propane is used in recreational vehicle absorption refrigerators. Innovative hot water solar thermal energy collectors can also be used as the modern \\"free energy\\" heat source. Efficient absorption refrigerators require water of at least 88 °C (190 °F). Common, inexpensive flat-plate solar thermal collectors only produce about 70 °C (160 °F) water, but several successful commercial projects in the US, Asia and Europe have shown that flat plate solar collectors specially developed for temperatures over 93 °C (200 °F) (featuring double glazing, increased backside insulation, etc.) can be effective and cost-efficient.\\"Solar Cooling.\\" www.solid.at. Accessed on 1 July 2008 Evacuated-tube solar panels can be used as well. Concentrating solar collectors required for absorption refrigerators are less effective in hot humid, cloudy environments, especially where the overnight low temperature and relative humidity are uncomfortably high. Where water can be heated well above 88+ °C (190 °F), it can be stored and used when the sun is not shining.[citation needed] For more than 150 years, absorption refrigerators have been used to make ice. This ice can be stored and used as an \\"ice battery\\" for cooling when the sun is not shining, as it was in the 1995 Hotel New Otani Tokyo in Japan. Mathematical models are available in the public domain for ice-based thermal energy storage performance calculations.  Geothermal  The earth as a huge and stable thermal storage resource, its shallow ground temperature and groundwater also have wide application prospects in energy use, especially for building energy saving is of great significance. Using absorption heat pump (refrigeration) technology, 65-90℃ geothermal water can be used to produce 7-9℃ refrigerant water for summer air conditioning. Reasonable use of corresponding heat pump technology can achieve the efficient and comprehensive utilization of geothermal resources at different temperature levels, greatly reducing energy consumption for heating and cooling of residential and commercial buildings. The use of 65℃ and above geothermal water (or waste/waste heat) to drive the absorption heat pump for cooling, and the corresponding heat pump type (heating/heating) for heating, can achieve good energy-saving and economic benefits. For low-temperature heat sources of 15-25 °C, driven by a small amount of high-temperature heat sources (such as high-temperature steam or direct combustion), cold water at a temperature of 7-15 °C and hot water at a temperature above 47 °C can be prepared. 1.2, >1.5 when heating.  Natural gas  Natural gas is a common- used heat source, therefore, absorption heat pumps are sometimes called gas- fired heat pumps. Also, when other heat sources heat pumps (waste heat for example) are running at the heating mode, they can meet the overload heating requirements of very cold periods in an efficient manner through additional gas boilers.  Waste heat  Illustratively, the waste heat drive system may cover cooling and heating loads by operating in a cooler and heat converter mode. It is possible that only one device can provide resources to the urban area in a resource-efficient manner throughout most of the year driven by waste heat.

Harriet Arbuthnot (10 September 1793 – 2 August 1834) was an early 19th-century English diarist, social observer and political hostess on behalf of the Tory party. During the 1820s she was the closest woman friend of the hero of Waterloo and British Prime Minister, the 1st Duke of Wellington.Longford, p. 195. She maintained a long correspondence and association with the Duke, all of which she recorded in her diaries, which are consequently extensively used in all authoritative biographies of the Duke of Wellington. Born into the periphery of the British aristocracy, her parents were Henry Fane and his wife, Elizabeth, née Swymmer; she married a politician and member of the establishment, Charles Arbuthnot. Thus well connected, she was perfectly placed to meet many of the key figures of the Regency and late Napoleonic eras. Recording meetings and conversations often verbatim, she has today become the \\"Mrs. Arbuthnot\\" quoted in many biographies and histories of the era. Her observations and memories of life within the British establishment are not confined to individuals but document politics, great events and daily life with an equal attention to detail, providing historians with a clear picture of the events described. Her diaries were themselves finally published in 1950 as The Journal of Mrs Arbuthnot. Early life Hon. Henry Fane (right) MP (1739–1802), Harriet Arbuthnot's father Harriet Arbuthnot was born Harriet Fane on 10 September 1793, the daughter of the Hon. Henry Fane, second son of Thomas Fane, 8th Earl of Westmorland.Longford, ODNB. As a young man, Henry Fane had been described as \\"very idle and careless and spending much time in the country\\".Lincolnshire archives, p. 19. However, he found time to be the Member of Parliament for Lyme and in 1772 was appointed Keeper of the King's Private Roads. In 1778, he married Arbuthnot's mother, Anne Batson, an heiress, the daughter of Edward Buckley Batson. The couple had 14 children: nine sons and five daughters. The young Harriet spent much of her childhood at the family home at Fulbeck Hall in Lincolnshire, sited high on the limestone hills above Grantham. The house, which had been given to Henry Fane by his father, was a not over-large modern mansion at the time of Arbuthnot's childhood. It was rebuilt following a fire in 1733, and further extended and modernised in 1784 by Henry Fane.Fulbeck Hall. Harriet Fane's father died when she was nine years old, but the family fortunes improved considerably in 1810 when her mother inherited the Avon Tyrrell estate in Hampshire and the Upwood Estate in Dorset. This yielded the widowed Mrs Fane an income of £6,000 per annumLincolnshire archives, p. 20. (equivalent to £ per year as of ). Portrait of Harriet Arbuthnot Marriage Harriet Fane married Rt Hon Charles Arbuthnot, member of Parliament, at Fulbeck on 31 January 1814. Born in 1767, her husband was 26 years older than she was, an age difference which had initially caused her family to object to the marriage.Mullen Another of the principal obstacles to finalising the arrangements for the marriage was financial. Her widowed mother delegated the arrangements for the marriage of her 20-year-old daughter to her elder son Vere, a 46-year-old widower who was considered qualified in these matters as he worked at Child's Bank. It seems that Vere Fane and his mother were not initially prepared to settle enough money on his sister to satisfy her future husband, causing the prospective bridegroom to write to his fiancée: \\"How can you and I live upon £1000 or £1200 and Fane [her mother] finds it so impossible to live upon her £6000 that she can offer you no assistance whatsoever?\\" Lord Castlereagh, Harriet Arbuthnot's \\"dearest and best friend.\\" Charles Arbuthnot was a widower with four children; his son Charles was a mere nine years junior to his new wife. His first wife Marcia, a lady in waiting to the notorious Princess of Wales, had died in 1806. Like the other two men his second wife so admired, Viscount Castlereagh and Wellington, Charles Arbuthnot was a member of the Anglo-Irish aristocracy. He had been a member of parliament since 1795, when he became the member for East Looe. At the time of his marriage to Fane, he was the member for St Germans. He had briefly interrupted his political career to become Ambassador Extraordinary to the Ottoman Empire between 1804 and 1807.Hobhouse, note 177 Marriage to such a pillar of the establishment as Charles Arbuthnot opened all doors to his young new wife, who, as one of the 14 children of a younger son of an aristocratic family possessed of no great fortune, would otherwise have been on the periphery of the highest society. However, as the debate and wrangling over her dowry proved, money was tight. Throughout her marriage, Mrs Arbuthnot, the former Harriet Fane, formed close friendships with powerful older men. She described Castlereagh as her \\"dearest and best friend\\"Arbuthnot. until his death in 1822, when she transferred her affections to the other great 19th- century Anglo-Irish peer, the Duke of Wellington.Aspinall. All social commentators of the time, however, agree that her marriage was happy; indeed, her husband was as close a friend of Wellington's as was his wife. Married to a politician, she was fascinated by politics and enjoyed success as a political hostess while exerting her energies to promote Tory causes. However, while she was the dominant partner,Longford, p. 441. her conservative outlook ensured her continued favour among her elderly Tory admirers. During the early part of her marriage, her husband served as an Under-Secretary at the Treasury. Later, in 1823, he was given the Department of Woods and Forests, a position which gave him charge of the Royal parks and gardens. The subsequent access to the Royal family this allowed increased not only his status but also that of his wife. When remarking in her diaries on other women who shared their affections with great men of the day, Arbuthnot displayed a sharp, ironic wit. Of Wellington's one-time mistress Princess Dorothea Lieven, wife to the Imperial Russian ambassador to London from 1812 to 1834, she wrote \\"It is curious that the loves and intrigues of a femme galante should have such influence over the affairs of Europe.\\"Charmley. Her political observations are clearly written from her own Tory viewpoint. However, her detailed description of the rivalry for power between the Tories and Liberals which took place between 1822 and 1830 is one of the most authoritative accounts of this struggle. Relationship with Wellington Duke of Wellingtons \\"closest woman friend.\\" It is likely that Arbuthnot first came to the attention of Wellington during 1814 in the re-opened salons of Paris following the exile of Napoleon to Elba. Wellington had been appointed the British Ambassador to the Court of the Tuileries, and the city was crowded with English visitors anxious to travel on the continent and socialise after the Napoleonic Wars. Amongst those sampling the rounds of entertainment in this lively environment were the newly married Arbuthnots. Charles Arbuthnot was known to Wellington, as he had been a strong supporter of Wellington's younger brother Henry during his divorce,The Wellesley divorce had occurred in 1810 after Henry Wellesley had discovered his wife, Charlotte, was having an affair with Lord Paget. Wellesley chose not to turn the customary blind eye and a huge scandal resulted. Wellington and Paget were later reconciled and it was Paget who at Waterloo exclaimed to Wellington \\"By God, sir, I've lost my leg!\\"—to which Wellington replied, \\"By God, sir, so you have!\\" and it is possible Wellington had met, or at least heard of, Mrs Arbuthnot—she was a first cousin to his favourites the Burghersh family.The Burghershes were the family of John Fane, Lord Burghersh, who was married to Wellington's niece Lady Priscilla Wellesley-Pole. Burghersh later succeeded to the family earldom to become Earl of Westmorland. However, it was only after the death of Castlereagh in 1822 that the Wellington–Arbuthnot friendship blossomed. It is unlikely any close friendship developed before this time. Wellington, ensconced in the Hotel de Charost (recently vacated by Napoleon's sister Princess Pauline Borghese) and fêted by the whole of Restoration Paris,Longford, pp. 435–441. had already found himself a close female companion, Giuseppina Grassini.Longford, p. 440. This woman, known, due to her close friendship with Napoleon as \\"La Chanteuse de l'Empereur\\", scandalised Parisian society both English and French by appearing on Wellington's arm, especially after the arrival in Paris of the Duchess of Wellington. The story of a \\"ménage à trois\\" between Mrs Arbuthnot, her husband Charles, and Wellington, widely speculated upon, has been rejected by some biographers.Smith. However, it has been said that the unhappily married Duke enjoyed his relationship with Mrs Arbuthnot because he found in her company \\"the comfort and happiness his wife could not give him.\\" Arbuthnot was certainly the Duke's confidante in all matters, especially that of his marriage. He confided to her that he only married his wife because \\"they asked me to do it\\" and that he was \\"not the least in love with her.\\"Both quotes are from Longford, p. 141. In fact, Wellington had not seen his wife for ten years before their wedding day.Longford, pp. 130–140. Following the marriage, the bride and groom found they had little if anything in common. Despite producing two sons, they led mostly separate lives until the death of the Duchess of Wellington in 1831. Harriet had a rather poor opinion of the Duchess (\\"she is such a fool\\"), although she disagreed with Wellington when he said that his wife cared nothing for his comfort: in Harriet's view the Duchess longed to make her husband happy, but had no idea how to go about the task.Longford, Elizabeth Wellington- Pillar of State Weidenfeld and Nicolson 1972 p.127 As a consequence of his unsatisfactory marriage, Wellington formed relationships with other women, but it was for Arbuthnot that \\"he reserved his deepest affection.\\"Moncrieff. Her husband at this time was working at The Treasury and Arbuthnot in effect became what would today be termed Wellington's social secretary during his first term of premiership between January 1828 and November 1830. It has been suggested that the Duke of Wellington allowed her \\"almost unrestricted access to the secrets of the cabinet\\". Whatever her knowledge and access, however, it appears she was unable to influence the Duke, but even his refusal to bring her husband into the Cabinet in January 1828 failed to shake the intimacy of the trio. Wellington made no attempts to conceal his friendship with Arbuthnot. An indication that their relationship was platonic and accepted as such in the highest echelons of society can be drawn from the Duchess of Kent permitting Wellington to present Arbuthnot to her infant daughter, the future Queen Victoria, in 1828. Arbuthnot noted that the young princess was \\"the most charming child I ever saw\\" and that \\"the Duchess of Kent is a very sensible person, who educates her (Victoria) remarkably well.\\"Woodham-Smith, p 89. Arbuthnot's impressions of the Duchess were less than candid, and not shared by Wellington and other establishment figures.Woodham-Smith pp 92–114 However, had Arbuthnot's own character not been judged respectable an audience with the infant princess would not have been permitted. Many references in Arbuthnot's diary, however, are less respectful than those she accorded to the Duchess of Kent. Wellington and Arbuthnot often travelled together, and a visit to Blenheim Palace they shared in 1824 provoked a scathing entry in her journal concerning Wellington's fellow duke the 5th Duke of Marlborough, of whom she wrote: \\"The family of the great General is, however, gone sadly to decay, and are but a disgrace to the illustrious name of Churchill, which they have chosen this moment to resume. The present Duke is overloaded with debt, is very little better than a common swindler\\".Blenheim: The Grandest and Most Famous House in England When Wellington and the Tories fell from power in November 1830, Arbuthnot lost interest in her diary, writing: \\"I shall write very seldom now, I dare say, in my book, for, except the Duke, none of the public men interest me.\\" Her account of the break-up of the Tory party is a thoroughly partisan narration, accurate as to happenings outside the Tory inner circle, but on a broader scale and not so completely political as that of Henry Hobhouse. Legacy The Fane family plot, at Fulbeck, where Harriet Arbuthnot is buried. Arbuthnot died suddenly of cholera on 2 August 1834 at Woodford Lodge, her home near the Arbuthnots' seat, Woodford House, Northamptonshire. Immediately after her death an express message was sent to Apsley House. The messenger, however, had to divert to Hatfield House where Wellington was dining with the Marquess and Marchioness of Salisbury. After her death, it was revealed she had been on a civil list pension of £936 per annum (£ per year as of ) since January 1823.\\"News\\", The Times, 6 August 1834 The exact nature of Arbuthnot's relationship with Wellington has always been a subject for conjecture. Fuel was added to the speculations when Wellington was immediately pursued by female admirers following her death. One was a Miss Jenkins who, from the moment of Arbuthnot's death, pursued him \\"body and soul.\\"Longford, p 192. Another, who resurfaced from his past, was Arbuthnot's own cousin, the eccentric Lady Georgiana Fane, who constantly pestered Wellington with threats to publish intimate letters he had once sent her, and to sue him for, allegedly, reneging on a promise to marry her.It has also been claimed that Lady Georgiana in fact refused the young future Duke of Wellington's marriage proposal, on the grounds she could not marry so lowly a soldier. Another version of the same story is that Lady Georgiana's father, the 10th Earl of Westmorland, forbade the marriage of his daughter to an untitled soldier with apparently limited prospects. Both of these stories however must be apocryphal, as Lady Georgiana never knew him before he was a \\"great man.\\" She was born in 1801. It seems most likely that in addition to assisting Wellington with his social life, Harriet's presence at his side protected him from the advances of other women. The Duke certainly kept mistresses during the period he knew Arbuthnot, but it has never been proven that Harriet was one of them. The tour at Apsley House, the Duke's London residence, asserts that she merely served as his hostess at political dinners.This is asserted in the official tour of Apsley House; if true, it is unusual for the standards of etiquette of the period. After her death, Charles left Woodford House and lived with his close friend Wellington. Charles died at Apsley House in 1850, aged 83.New, pp. 384–385. During their time together the two elderly men mourned the loss of Arbuthnot and bemoaned the splits developing within the Tory party. Wellington lived on for another two years and was buried with due pomp and circumstance in St Paul's Cathedral. Harriet Arbuthnot had been buried in the Fane family plot at St Nicholas' parish church, Fulbeck.

The stone's age, purpose and origin are unknown. The stone is about long and thick, dark and egg-shaped, bearing a variety of carved symbols. Carvings on one side of the stone show an ear of corn and several other figures. The other side is more abstract, featuring inverted arrows, a moon shape, some dots and a spiral. A hole goes through the stone from top to bottom, seemingly bored from both ends with different size bits ( at the top and at the bottom). History The stone was reportedly found in 1872 in Meredith, New Hampshire, by workers digging a hole for a fence post. Seneca Ladd, a Meredith businessman who hired the workers, was given credit for the discovery. In 1892, upon Ladd's death, the stone passed to Frances Ladd Coe of Center Harbor, one of his daughters. In 1927, she donated the stone to the New Hampshire Historical Society. The stone is currently on exhibit at the Museum of New Hampshire History. Analysis and interpretation A contemporary source suggested that the stone \\"commemorates a treaty between two tribes\\".Author unknown (1872). The American Naturalist, November 1872. Another writer later suggested that it is a thunderstone. With the somewhat limited understanding of the day, the letter said that thunderstones \\"always present the appearance of having been machined or hand- worked: frequently they come from deep in the earth, embedded in lumps of clay, or even surrounded by solid rock or coral\\".Author unknown (1931). Letter to the New Hampshire Historical Society, 1931. In 1994, a borescope analysis of the stone's holes was performed. State archaeologist Richard Boisvert later suggested that the holes had the appearance of having been drilled by power tools from the 19th or 20th century: > \\"I've seen a number of holes bored in stone with technology that you would > associate with prehistoric North America. There's a certain amount of > unevenness ... and this hole was extremely regular throughout.

It is widely planted in Sardinia, in Liguria primarily under the name Pigato, to some extent in Corsica, in Piedmont under the name Favorita, and in increasing amounts in Languedoc-Roussillon. The leaves are dark green and pentagonal. The grapes are amber-yellow and hang in pyramidal bunches. The vines are often grown on slopes facing the sea where they can benefit from the additional reflected light. The Vitis International Variety Catalogue now gives Italy as its origin. The most famous wine made from Vermentino is probably the DOCG Vermentino di Gallura (and Vermentino di Gallura Superiore) which is produced in the province of Olbia-Tempio, in the north of Sardinia. The grape is said to have been cultivated in this part of Gallura, often under the name Arratelau, since the fourteenth century.www.comunas.it :: Comune di Monti Elsewhere on the island the grape is used for a variety of white wines, including sweet and sparkling variants. Origin Different hypotheses about the origin of Vermentino have been forwarded, and only recently has DNA typing confirmed Vermentino to be identical to the Pigato of Liguria and Favorita of Piedmont, superseding some earlier hypotheses. It is unclear if Vermentino is also identical to the variety Rollo found in eastern Provence, around Nice. Both that variety and Vermentino go under the synonym Rolle.

Its white wine is 100% Vermentino. *In Languedoc-Roussillon, it has recently been allowed into many AOC wines, including Côtes du Roussillon. *In Provence, close to Nice, the grape is used for the AOC white wines of Bellet. *In California, Vermentino is grown and produced in the Adelaida District AVA by Tablas Creek Vineyard, in the Santa Ynez Valley AVA by Brick Barn Wine Estate, in the Carneros AVA by Mahoney Vineyards and in the Mokelumne River/Lodi AVA by m2 Wines. *In Southern Oregon, it is being grown in the Applegate Valley AVA by Troon Vineyard.

Crane has also played internationally for England. Crane is renowned for his impressive physique and powerful runs from the base of the scrum. He consistently ranks as one of the most frequent carriers of the ball in English club rugby. He switched to playing rugby union relatively late after playing football for a number of professional clubs' junior sides. Club career Crane made his debut for his former club, Leeds Tykes, in the nine-all draw at FC Grenoble in the European Challenge Cup in October 2004 aged just 18. He went on to make 29 appearances for the Tykes in all competitions scoring five tries, including a hat trick against Valladolid RAC in the European Challenge Cup. After Leeds were relegated in the 2005–06 season, Crane left the club to sign for the Leicester Tigers. In the Heineken Cup semi-final match against Cardiff Blues on 3 May 2009, Crane scored the winning kick in the penalty shootout after the game had finished level after extra time. It was the first time a Heineken Cup tie had been decided in a shootout. Crane started in the subsequent 2009 Heineken Cup Final. Crane scored the only try in the final of the 2008–09 Guinness Premiership as Leicester defeated London Irish. He also started as Leicester won the 2010 and 2013 Premiership finals. Crane spent the whole of the 2011-12 Aviva Premiership campaign injured. After 10 years playing with Leicester, Crane announced his signing with Bristol Bears on a three-year contract from the 2016-17 season. International career Crane made his U21 debut in February 2006 scoring a try against Wales at Worcester, and he was an ever-present in their successful U21 Grand Slam campaign. This was his second successive age group Grand Slam, as he had captained England's U19 side to success the season before. Crane has also captained England at U18 level and took over the leadership role when his new teammate, Matt Cornwell, was injured during the 2006 IRB U21 World Cup in France, fulfilling the promise shown when competing for Colston's School in the final of the Daily Mail U18 Cup competition at Twickenham. Crane was selected in the England Saxons squad for the 2006–07 season, and went on to compete at the 2007 Churchill Cup.

In the film, Hercules is finally a happy family man with his wife Deianeira, two young sons Aeson and Clonus, daughter Ilea and in-living centaur Nessus. When villagers begin disappearing it is discovered that they had fallen through a crack in the earth which goes straight to Hades. Hercules once again comes to the rescue and faces one of his most difficult challenges, and must prove himself as a man as well as a god. Plot In the centre of a village, the ground begins to open up and a strange green light emanates from within. Two drunken men see the light and walk over to take a closer look. As they approach, a gaseous vapour begins pouring out of the fissure and in a flash of light the two men are charred with only their bones remaining. Then a desirable young woman is being bathed and dressed afterwards. Meanwhile in a village square, a man challenges the villagers to fight Eryx the boxer. One man agrees but he is tricked when he is introduced to the real boxer, a towering brute of a man. The challenger dies fighting Eryx, so an old man from the village tells a youth to find Hercules. After a short while, the boy returns with Hercules, who challenges Eryx. They begin to fight and it appears that Eryx is going to beat Hercules, but then Hercules finally ends the fight by killing Eryx. With the man dead, the man who first made the challenge gives Hercules a peacock feather, Hera's symbol. He goes to Hera's temple and asks if they can call a truce; Hera defies Hercules, so he destroys her temple. Zeus appears and tells Hercules that he will only make things worse between him and Hera. When Hercules arrives home, Deianeira tends to his wounds and they make love. The following day, Hercules is working in the smithy with Nessus, the centaur. He watches his children playing outside when a woman, Iole, comes looking for him and faints. She says she's from the village of Gryphon and that they need Hercules' help. Hercules agrees to help, but Deianeira tells the girl to rest first. During the night, Iole tells Deianeira that she thought she saw someone outside her window. Deianeria tells her no one is there. Deianeira gets a lantern and goes outside; she finds Nessus in the smithy and he tells her that she cannot trust Hercules with Iole as she is a virgin young woman, Hercules will not be able to resist. She defends him saying that Hercules would be faithful to her but she starts to doubt when sees the virgin maiden sleeping naked. In the morning Hercules, Iole and Nessus leave for Gryphon. Before leaving Iole gives Deianeira a necklace to thank her for looking after her the night before. Deianeira goes to the market where a woman tells her that the necklace is a sign that she has lost her husband and tells Deianeira about the necklace is given to women whose men are to be killed by Nurian maidens trained so well in the art of seduction that they can get any man in their power. Deianeira goes after Hercules to warn him and finds the three at a river bank. She tells Iole to leave, but Hercules says he already knew she was a Nurian maiden, but that he loves Deianeira, and would never be unfaithful to her. After reassuring Deianeira, Hercules and Iole continue to Gryphon with Hercules holding Iole in his arms to help her cross the river, but Nessus begins to stir doubts in Deianeira's mind, and after she tries to get away he attacks her. Nessus tries to rape her. She calls for Hercules, who shoots an arrow which strikes Nessus in the back. As he lay dying, Nessus showing Deianeira the cloak his blood drenches tells her that his blood is powerful and will prevent Hercules from being unfaithful. She gives the cape to Hercules and tells him to wear it if he gets cold. Hercules and Iole continue their journey, discussing their past and popularly exaggerated reputations. Iole demonstrates how her power can work for good, stopping an apparently raging man from causing a major fight by touching him and diagnosing he just burnt his mouth at hot soup. They come close to each other in a night and she kisses him. The other day, she swims naked in a lake while a man, who she mistakes for Hercules, watches her. She then stops Hercules from killing the young Lycastus from her village, a love interest of her who attacks anyone he considers a rival for the heart of the Iole. When they arrive at the village, the hell-mouth is stronger then ever. Lycastus and Iole passionately kiss each other as she is being prepared for Hercules. He begs her but she says that Hercules is her destiny. Hercules walks through the village seeing fire and destructions and dead bodies strewn on the floor. He approaches the fissure and looks into it and see spirits coming out from deep within the Earth. Zeus appears and tells him that it is the Underworld. Hercules asks if he is mortal or not, Zeus tells him he is mortal, but tries to prevent Hercules from going down the hole. The half-god hesitates to believe his father Zeus, who answers reluctantly he can die, yet turns Iole's desperate plea - taking off her clothes, offering herself and kissing him - down and gives her to Lycastus but when the cloak drenched in Nessus' blood nearly kills him as he puts it on setting out to return home and displays Hera's peacock-sign, he jumps into the Underworld. As Hercules travels to the Underworld, a man arrives at Hercules' house and tells Deianeira that Hercules is dead. He explains about the cape trying to kill Hercules and that he jumped into the hole. Hercules arrives in the Underworld, where he meets Charon, whom he forces to transport him across the River Styx. On the other side of the river Hercules finds Cerberus' collar, he enters a doorway and vanishes. Meanwhile, Deianeira, distraught by the thought that she caused her own husband's death, goes to a cliff top; while standing there she sees a vision of Hercules and reaches out to him; as she reaches out she falls from the cliff to the rocks below and two eyes appear in the sky. After being attacked by different monsters, Hercules meets Eryx the boxer and some other people he sent to Hades and cleverly makes them fight each-other and then sees Nessus, who taunts him by showing him, via a portal, that Deianeira is dead. Hercules ask for Nessus to show him again, when Nessus shows Deianeira again Hercules jumps through the portal into the Elysian fields. He finds Deianeira but she has no memory of him, Hades appears and tells Hercules that he erased her memory about Hercules because of the thought of killing her husband. He begs Deianeria to remember him and their children and then kisses her. With the kiss her memories return and Hercules makes a deal with Hades that if he can capture Cerberus, who got loose and causes havoc all through the Underworld, then Deianeira can go back to Earth with him. Hercules goes after Cerberus, he finds Hades' men trying and failing to capture him. The hunt is arduous, but his physical force and kindness at the right time do the job. Once Cerberus is chained the hole in the ground closes up and Deianeira appears. Back on Earth the villagers thank Hercules for helping them and he and Deianeira go home. Iole says goodbye to him with a sweet kiss as Deianeira smiles.

Timeline  * 1959. (5 October) Born at Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de- Seine). Later received his baccalaureat in literature at Versailles, and studied law at Assas. * 1982. Graduated from the École nationale de la magistrature (ENM). * 1984. Examining magistrate at Douai, and then Chartres. * 1989. Elected to the Tribunal de Grande instance at Créteil as investigating magistrate. * 1994. Start of the Paris HLM scandal. * 2002. Retired as a judge.  The Paris HLM scandal  In January 1994 Halphen began an inquiry following the discovery of a series of forged invoices between Jean-Claude Méry and companies that were providing services to HLMs (subsidised low-cost housing) in Paris. In September 1994, Jean-Claude Méry, a former member of the central committee of the RPR political party was imprisoned for his involvement. The inquiry also investigated the conduct of the HLM office in the neighbouring Hauts-de-Seine département, at the time run by Didier Schuller and Patrick Balkany, close associates of Charles Pasqua. In December 1994, Jean-Pierre Maréchal, Halphen's father-in-law, was arrested in Roissy when he was seen receiving a briefcase full of money from Didier Schuller, in what was later described as a failed attempt to bribe Halphen. Didier Schuller disappeared, only returning from hiding in 2002. In 1996 the former vice president of OPAC - the public body controlling low-cost housing - François Ciolina, exposed corruption surrounding the HLM apartment owned by the son of Jean Tiberi, the mayor of Paris. In June of that year, Halphen ordered a search of the mayor's house only to be prevented from doing so when the policemen on the scene, following orders from their superiors, refused to take part. They were later sanctioned. In 1999 Jean Tiberi was again investigated for \\"complicity in corruption\\". The mayor, acting in his role as head of Opac, denied all wrongdoing, and in November, Halphen closed the case. The following year, shortly after the death of Jean-Claude Méry, the newspaper Le Monde published the contents of a film made in December 1995 by journalist Arnaud Hamelin. In the tape, Méry spoke of how he had delivered 5 million Francs in cash to Michel Roussin, chief of staff of then prime minister Jacques Chirac. Halphen relaunched the HLM inquiry, and in March 2001 summoned president Chirac to give testimony in the case, although Chirac refused claiming that it would be incompatible with his duties as president. In September 2001 the court of appeal ruled that Halphen did not have sufficient grounds to reopen the case and overturned all its findings. He was removed from the investigations and replaced with judge Armand Riberolles. In January 2002 Halphen announced that he was quitting his position as judge and turned to writing. He was a vocal supporter of Jean-Pierre Chevènement's presidential campaign, later distancing himself after Chevènement fell in with the political right. He is a member of Roland Castro's 'Mouvement de l'Utopie Concrète'.

The municipality had 62,925 (2005 census) in a total area of 1,848 km² (713.5 sq mi). The town and its municipal seat had a population of 15,991 in 2000. Overview The name was given in honor of Santiago de Compostela in Galicia, Spain; tradition says that \\"Compostela\\" comes from Latin campus stellae, \\"field of stars\\" (another theory makes it come from composita tella or even compositella). Compostela is located on the south coast of the state and is bounded in the north by San Blas and Xalisco; in the south by Bahía de Banderas and the state of Jalisco; in the east by Santa María del Oro, San Pedro Lagunillas and the state of Jalisco; in the west by the Pacific Ocean. The largest settlements in the municipality are: Compostela (15,991 inhabitants in 2000), Las Varas (12,403), La Peñita de Jaltemba (7,062), Zacualpan (4,468), and Colonia Paraíso Escondido (2,069). The climate is tempered by elevation, with rains from July to September. The hottest months are April and May. The average annual rainfall is 968.5 mm. The average annual temperature is 22.9 °C. The economy is heavily based on agriculture. The main crops are tobacco, corn, beans, coffee, sorghum, and mangoes. There were around 50,000 head of cattle in 1995. There were several small gold and silver mines. In manufacturing the main products were cigars, mango packing, rice shelling, soap factories, cattle feed, furniture, and food and drink. This is a region that attracts a considerable number of local and foreign visitors due to the natural landscape, beaches, historical sites and the international fishing competitions. Around Las Varas in the direction of the south there are beaches in the zone called Costa Alegre, among which should be mentioned: Chacala and Chacalilla, La Peñita de Jaltemba, Rincón de Guayabitos, Los Ayala, El Monteón, Lo de Marcos and Playa Platanitos, as well as the islands in the bay of Rincón de Guayabitos, with a good infrastructure of services.

The magazine was devoted entirely to British history. As the name implied it was intended to encourage readers to get out and see historical sites, and featured articles to make visits to those places easier. Particularly important was a pull-out section entitled \\"Footsteps\\" which could be removed without destroying the rest of the magazine. This covered a number of different walks/visits across the country each month, with maps and details on a full A4 page. Following the takeover of Origin by BBC Worldwide in 2004, Living History ceased to exist as an independent magazine. It was incorporated as an integral part of the BBC's rival magazine BBC History from June 2004. Though the editor of Living History moved across to BBC History, much of the material did not. The emphasis of Living History on British history was abandoned. The BBC magazine covered international history and politics which Living History did not, so the back third of BBC History took on Living History's approach to delving deep into destinations, TV and radio, reviews and visiting sites. The UK based \\"Footsteps\\" section was reduced from whole page pull-outs to half-page articles not intended to be removable from the magazine, and were replaced with international History Holidays. Initially the innovative ideas inherent in Living History were developed further still by the whole editorial team, subsequently the magazine was completely absorbed into BBC History magazine, with the emphasis on British history and magazine name being lost.

In 2017, the National Diet changed the law to enable the Emperor to abdicate. With this change, Emperor Akihito abdicated on 30 April 2019. Passage of the Law It was passed during the Shōwa era on January 16, 1947, by the last session of the Imperial Diet. This law superseded the Imperial Household Law of 1889, which had enjoyed co-equal status with the Constitution of the Empire of Japan and could only be amended by the Emperor. The revised statute is clearly subordinate to the Constitution of Japan, which went into effect on May 3, 1947. It develops Chapter 1: Article 2 of The Constitution of Japan which states: \\"The Imperial Throne shall be dynastic and succeeded to in accordance with the Imperial House Law passed by the Diet\\". Draft and intent Drafted by the government of Shigeru Yoshida, Prime Minister during the American occupation by the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, the 1947 statute sought to bring the legislation governing the Imperial Household into compliance with the American-written Constitution. The law had the effect of dramatically restricting membership in the Imperial Family to the Emperor Hirohito's immediate family, his widowed mother, and the families of his three brothers. It abolished the collateral lines of the Imperial Family, the shinnōke and the ōke, which had traditionally been a pool of potential successors to the throne if the main imperial family failed to produce an heir. The fifty-one members of the eleven cadet branches renounced their Imperial status; and they were formally removed from the Imperial household register and became ordinary citizens on October 14, 1947.\\"Life in the Cloudy Imperial Fishbowl,\\" Japan Times. March 27, 2007. The new law retained the principle of agnatic succession enshrined in the 1889 law and Prussian-influenced constitution during the 19th century Meiji Restoration. The new law further restricted the succession to legitimate-born sons, grandsons, and male line descendants of an Emperor. Previously, an Emperor's sons and grandsons born by concubines and their male line descendants could succeed to the throne. Although Imperial chronologies include eight reigning empresses in the course of Japanese history, their successors were most often selected from amongst the males of the paternal Imperial bloodline, which is why some conservative scholars argue that the women's reigns were temporary and that male-only succession tradition must be maintained in the 21st century. Empress Genmei (661–721), who was followed on the throne by her daughter, Empress Genshō (680–748), remains the sole exception to this conventional argument. In addition, the law contained numerous mechanisms to regulate the future size of the Imperial Family, and thus the financial burden on the state. The chapters of the Imperial Household Law addresses the following: # The order of succession to the throne # The establishment of a regency should the Emperor be a minor or suffer from a serious ailment # The membership of the Imperial Family # The composition of the Imperial Household Council # The titles and styles held by the Emperor and members of the imperial family # The marriages of the Emperor, the Crown Prince, and the princes of the blood; and, # The rites for Imperial funerals, Imperial mausoleum, and the maintenance of the Imperial Family registry. Chapter 1: Article 1 of the Imperial Household Law states: \\"The Imperial Throne shall be succeeded to by a male offspring in the male line belonging to the Imperial Lineage\\".The Imperial House Law of 1947 The line of succession is detailed in Article 2 as: # The eldest son of the Emperor # The eldest son of the Emperor's eldest son # Other descendants of the eldest son of the Emperor # The second son of the Emperor and his descendants # Other descendants of the Emperor # Brothers of the Emperor and their descendants # Uncles of the Emperor and their descendants Matters relating to regency and membership of the Imperial Family are managed by the Imperial Household Council as stated under this law.

The canvas is large, lacks any other content except some discreet shadows, and Stubbs has paid precise attention to the details of the horse's appearance. It has been described in The Independent as \\"a paradigm of the flawless beauty of an Arabian thoroughbred\\".George Stubbs, Painter, by Judy Egerton, The Independent, 25 November 2007. The Fitzwilliam family, heirs of the childless Rockingham, retained the painting until 1997 when funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund allowed the National Gallery, London to acquire it for £11 million.Egerton (1998), 240 Stubbs was a specialist equine artist who in 1762 was invited by Rockingham to spend \\"some months\\" at Wentworth Woodhouse in Yorkshire, his main country house. Stubbs had painted many horse portraits, with and without human figures, but the heroic scale and lack of background of Whistlejacket are \\"unprecedented\\" in his work and equine portraits in general and \\"contemporaries were so astonished that a single horse should command a huge canvas that legends quickly developed\\" explaining why the painting was unfinished, none of which seem plausible or supported by the evidence to modern art historians.Egerton (1998), 245 In fact Stubbs's earliest canvases on his visit in 1762 included a pair of much smaller paintings of groups of standing horses, one including Whistlejacket, in a horizontal format \\"like a classical frieze\\" with a similar honey beige background broken only by small shadows at the feet.Egerton (1998), 243–244; Landry, 157–158 (illustrated in both); they are 99 x 190.5/187 cm, recorded in Rockingham's accounts on 15 August 1762, at £195.5s for five paintings (Egerton). Both remain in the family, but were exhibited in the Stubbs exhibition shown at Tate Britain and the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool in 2006-7. The Mares and Foals illustrated below is not the one with Whistlejacket in it. It would seem likely that leaving the portraits without the usual landscape background was Rockingham's idea.Egerton (1998), 243–244 Stubbs depicts Whistlejacket rising to a levade, but with his head turned towards the viewer, in a pose comparable to a number of earlier monumental equestrian portraits, including examples by Rubens and Velázquez, but in these the emphasis is on the rider.Egerton, 245. For example Rubens' Saint George and the Dragon (Rubens) in the Prado Here the horse is alone and in a natural state, producing a \\"romantic study in solitude and liberty\\".Jones Like many of Stubbs's other paintings of horses and other animals in the wild, including several versions of a horse attacked by a lion perched on its back, the painting is an early intimation of Romanticism, as well as a challenge to the lowly place animal painting occupied in the hierarchy of genres.Landry, 149–150, 153–155, 156 To a greater degree than any earlier painter, Stubbs produced genuinely individual portraits of specific horses, paying intimate attention to details of their form. Minute blemishes, veins, and the muscles flexing just below the surface of the skin are all visible and reproduced with great care and realism. Whistlejacket had already retired after a fairly successful racing career, but was painted in this unusual form to show \\"a supremely beautiful specimen of the pure-bred Arabian horse at its finest\\".Egerton (1998), 244–245 Painting history Stubbs's Molly Long-legs with her Jockey (1761–62), a more typical racehorse portrait (101 × 127 cm) Stubbs's knowledge of equine physiology was unsurpassed by any painter; he had studied anatomy at York and, from 1756, he spent 18 months in Lincolnshire where he carried out dissections and experiments on dead horses to better understand the animal's physiology. He suspended the cadavers with block and tackle to better able sketch them in different positions. The careful notes and drawings he made during his studies were published in 1766 in The Anatomy of the Horse. Even before the publication of his book, Stubbs's dedication to his subject reaped him rewards: his drawings were recognized as more accurate than the work of other equine artists and commissions from aristocratic patrons quickly followed. Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham was a Whig politician, later to be twice Prime Minister, and exceptionally rich even by the standards of that wealthy group. In 1762 he commissioned Stubbs to produce a series of portraits of his horses, one of which was Whistlejacket.Egerton (1998), 242–243 He was also a collector of art, commissioning several works in Italy on his Grand Tour in the late 1740s, but his great leisure interests were, typically for his class, horseracing and gambling. His wife wrote of her hopes that he would restrict himself to gambling \\"just upon the turf, for there is always a possibility of some sort of pleasure in that; but not the smallest in other sorts\\".Egerton (1998), 243 Wentworth House, as it was then known, had been \\"rebuilt by his father on a huge scale\\" and empty walls needed filling.Egerton (1998), 242 Horace Walpole, on the visit in 1766 mentioned below, complained of the un-landscaped park \\"This lord loves nothing but horses, and the enclosures for them take place of everything\\".Egerton (1998), 244 Mares and Foals without a background, other Rockingham horses painted by Stubbs on his visit in 1762. Whistlejacket was in the pair piece showing stallions. The Wentworth archives, \\"though unusually comprehensive, contain no clear reference to the commission to paint Whistlejacket\\", though some indication of the likely price comes from a receipt by Stubbs dated 30 December 1762 for \\"Eighty Guineas for one Picture of a Lion and another of a Horse Large as Life\\", probably a different picture for Rockingham's London house.Egerton (1998), 246 Earlier in 1762, Stubbs had painted a second portrait of Whistlejacket, with two other unnamed stallions and a groom, Joshua or Simon Cobb.Egerton (1998), 244 According to a story in the biography of Stubbs by his friend and fellow-painter Ozias Humphrey, when the portrait was nearly finished Whistlejacket was accidentally led in front of it by a stable boy and reacted violently, treating it as a rival stallion, and lifting the boy holding him fully off the ground in his attempts to attack the painting. The story probably originated with Stubbs himself, but is probably too good to be true; it clearly recalls Pliny the Elder's famous story of Zeuxis and Parrhasius.Landry, 152–153, giving Humphrey's account in full; Egerton does not mention the story When Wentworth was remodelled under a later Earl Fitzwilliam, a 40-foot square \\"Whistlejacket Room\\" was created to showcase the painting, with only single family portraits by Sir Joshua Reynolds and Sir Thomas Lawrence to keep it company.Egerton (1998), 246 Wentworth Woodhouse ceased to be occupied by the family after World War II, and the painting was loaned to Kenwood House in London from 1971–81, the Tate Gallery 1984–85, and the National Gallery from 1996 before its purchase the next year.Egerton (1998), 240 It is now displayed in the centre of room 34, and is framed by doorways at the end of a long enfilade so that it can be seen through ten intervening rooms from the Sainsbury Wing, at the other end of the gallery.\\"Whistlejacket\\", and see linked floor plan. It is consistently among the top ten most popular National Gallery paintingsLandry, 149 in various forms of reproduction. The painting is in \\"very good condition\\" and was \\"lined, cleaned and restored a few years before its acquisition.\\"Egerton (1998), 242 Legends as to the origin George Stubbs, A Lion Attacking a Horse, also painted in 1762; one of many treatments of this subject by Stubbs One story was that Rockingham had intended to commission an equestrian portrait of George III; Stubbs would paint the horse while two other notable portrait and landscape painters would fill in the king and the landscape respectively. In one account, The painting was supposedly intended to accompany a similarly-sized equestrian portrait of George II by David Morier, but Rockingham then changed his mind. According to Horace Walpole, on a visit to Wentworth where he was probably shown round by the housekeeper, the painting was intended as a gift for the King, but Rockingham supposedly had not bothered to support progress of the painting after falling out of favour, and ordered it hung at Wentworth Woodhouse uncompleted instead.Egerton (1998), 245; see also Landry, 157 Another reason popularly given for it being \\"unfinished\\" is that Rockingham was so impressed by Whistlejacket's furious reaction when confronted by Stubbs working on the painting in his stable, that he ordered it hung without further decoration. Stubbs produced other paintings of horses against blank backgrounds for Rockingham, nothing in the painting indicates that it is not complete, and the detail of the shadows cast by Whistlejacket's rear legs on the ground suggest that this is how Stubbs intended the picture to be seen. Horse history Whistlejacket was a chestnut stallion, with flaxen-coloured mane and tail, believed to be the original colouring of the wild Arabian breed. He was a Thoroughbred race horse foaled in 1749 at the stud of Sir William Middleton, 3rd Baronet at Belsay Castle in Northumberland,Egerton (1998), 244–245 and named after a contemporary cold remedy containing gin and treacle. His sire was Mogul and grandsire was the Godolphin Arabian; through his dam, he was also descended from the Byerly Turk, and various other Arabians and Turks. He raced from 1752, winning many races in the North. He lost to Jason in the King's Plate at Newmarket in 1755,A major race run between 1634 and 1765, \\"A HISTORY OF THE KING'S AND QUEEN'S PLATES IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND, FROM 1634 TO 1765\\" but won the following year, when he was also narrowly beaten by Spectator for the Jockey Club Plate at Newmarket in 1756. He was sold soon after to the Marquess of Rockingham. He famously won a four-mile race at York in August 1759 against a strong field, beating Brutus by a length, and then retired to stud, being ten years old.Egerton (1998), 244–245 He was beaten only four times in his racing career, but was notoriously temperamental and difficult to manage.Egerton (1998), 246 He was \\"averagely successful at stud\\", and must have died before Rockingham's death in 1782, as he is not listed in records of the subsequent sale of the stud; he would have been in his thirties if alive. He was not nearly as famous a horse as his sire and grand-sire, but is mentioned in Act IV of Oliver Goldsmith's classic comic play She Stoops to Conquer (1773) when an elopement is planned: \\"I have got you a pair of horses that will fly like Whistlejacket\\".Egerton (1998), 244–245 NotesReferences *Egerton (1998): Egerton, Judy, National Gallery Catalogues (new series): The British School, 1998, Landry, Donna, Noble Brutes: How Eastern Horses Transformed English Culture, 2008, JHU Press, , 9780801890284, google books * Further reading *George Stubbs, painter: catalogue raisonné, Judy Egerton, Yale University Press, 2007, 1762 paintings Collections of the National Gallery, London Paintings by George Stubbs Horses in art Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Thoroughbred family 4 ","title":"Whistlejacket"},{"id":"6300395","text":"Creedmoor Psychiatric Center is a psychiatric hospital at 79-26 Winchester Boulevard in Queens Village, Queens, New York, United States.

The hospital's census declined by the early 1960s, and unused portions were sold off and developed into the Queens County Farm Museum, a school campus, and a children's psychiatric center.  History = Site  Creedmoor station in 1891 The hospital's name derives from the Creeds, a family that previously farmed the site. The local railroad station on a line that ran from Long Island City to Bethpage took the name Creedmoor, apparently from the phrase “Creed's Moor,” describing the local geography, In the early 1870s, New York State purchased land from the Creeds for use by the National Guard and by the National Rifle Association (NRA) as a firing range. The Creedmoor Rifle Range hosted prestigious international shooting competitions, which became the forerunner of the Palma Trophy competition.Creedmoor Shooting Range History . Retrieved April 15, 2015 In 1892, as a result of declining public interest and mounting noise complaints from the growing neighborhood, the NRA deeded its land back to the state.  Hospital  In 1912, the Farm Colony of Brooklyn State Hospital was opened, with 32 patients, at Creedmoor by the Lunacy Commission of New York State, reflecting a trend towards sending the swelling population of urban psychiatric patients to the fresh air of outlying areas. By 1918, Creedmoor’s own census had swollen to 150, housed in the abandoned National Guard barracks. By 1959, the hospital housed 7,000 inpatients. Creedmoor is described as a crowded, understaffed institution in Susan Sheehan's Is There No Place On Earth For Me? (1982), a biography of a patient pseudonymously called Sylvia Frumkin. Dr. Lauretta Bender, child neuropsychiatrist, has been reported as practicing there in the 1950s and 1960s. In the late 1970s, one of its more notorious patients was former NYPD officer Robert Torsney, who was committed there in December 1977 after being found not guilty by reason of insanity in the 1976 murder of then 15-year-old Randolph Evans in Brooklyn and was kept there until July 1979 when reviewers declared him no longer a threat. The hospital's census had declined by the early 1960s as the introduction of new psychiatric medications, along with the deinstitutionalization movement for many psychiatric patients. In 1975, the land in Glen Oaks formerly used to raise food for the hospital was opened to the public as the Queens County Farm Museum. Another part of the campus in Glen Oaks was developed into the Queens Children's Psychiatric Center.Queens Children's Psychiatric Center.

The population of the municipality was 7,155 (2005) in a total area of 520 square kilometers. The population of the town and municipal seat was 3,630 (2005). The population has been declining since 1980 when it was 8,308 inhabitants. The municipality of San Pedro Lagunillas is located at the following extreme coordinates: from parallel 20° 59’ to 21° 20’ latitude north and from meridian 104° 37’ to 104° 54’ longitude west. It is located in the south of the state of Nayarit and is bounded in the north and east by the municipality of Santa María del Oro, in the south by the municipality of Ahuacatlán and the state of Jalisco, and in the west by the municipality of Compostela. The pre-Hispanic name was \\"Ximochoque\\", which means \\"Place of bitter jars\\". With the arrival of the Spanish the place was rebaptized with the name of San Pedro Lagunillas to honor the first Count of Miravalle, Pedro Alonso Dávalos Bracamonte y Uibarri, who provided the resources for the construction of the church and in reference to the lakes of clear water found in the region. Most of the municipality belongs to a volcanic zone. The main elevations are \\"Cerro Grande\\"(2,000 meters), \\"Cerro Tetillas\\" (1,760 meters), \\"Cerro La Palma\\" (1,740 meters), \\"Cerro Estiladero\\" (1,600 meters), \\"Cerro El Carretón\\" (1,580 meters), and the extinct volcano of \\"Tepetiltic\\" (1,500 meters). The economy is mainly agricultural with the main crops being corn, beans, and sugarcane. There is some cattle raising with 34,214 head counted in the 1990 census. Due to the seasonal nature of the agriculture there has been intensive emigration in the last twenty years, especially to the United States of America. The main tourist sights are the two lakes of San Pedro and Tepetiltic. There is also a small museum in the town with displays of pre-Columbian artifacts.

September 27, 2008. Retrieved on January 15, 2013. Early baseball career Cruz was selected by the Philadelphia Phillies out of Western High School in the second round (26th overall) of the MLB amateur entry draft in June 1973, immediately signing a contract later that month. He finally made his major league debut five years later, playing only three games in September 1978 with the Phillies. With Larry Bowa established as the everyday shortstop, Cruz was traded to the Royals for Doug Bird on April 3, 1979, three days before the start of a new season. The Royals, with a glut of outfielders, a need for a starting first baseman and having decided on U.L. Washington as its regular shortstop, dealt Cruz, along with Al Cowens and right-handed pitcher Craig Eaton, to the Angels for Willie Aikens and Rance Mulliniks on December 6, 1979. A midseason swap for right-handed pitcher Randy Scarbery on June 12, 1980 sent Cruz to the White Sox, where he became the starting shortstop. Unfortunately, a back injury sidelined him for the entire 1981 season.Neft, David S., Cohen, Richard M. & Neft, Michael L. The Sports Encyclopedia: Baseball. 20th edition. New York: St. Martin's Griffin, 2000. In May 1981, Cruz was arrested in Edmonton, Alberta, where he had been sent to play on a 20-day loan to the White Sox's triple-A farm team, and charged with breaking and entering an Edmonton department store and stealing $2,500 worth of watches.https://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/05/20/Chicago-White-Sox- shortstop-Todd-Cruz-charged-in-the/7012359179200/. He told the Chicago Tribune's Robert Markus that he was drunk when he made his way into the Hudson's Bay department store. \\"I guess I didn't know what I was doing or I never would have done it,\\" Cruz told Markus. \\"I didn't need anything they had in that store.\\". Cruz, who prosecutors later said had broken a plate glass window to gain entry and then used a hammer he found in the store to break into a watch display case, in July 1981 pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of attempted breaking and entering and theft and was given a conditional discharge and nine months probation. The White Sox's search for a reliable batter capable of hitting for average resulted in Cruz being shipped, along with Jim Essian and Rod Allen, to the Mariners for Tom Paciorek on December 11, 1981. The campaign was Cruz's most productive offensively as he established career highs with 57 runs batted in (RBI), 44 runs scored, 113 hits, and 16 home runs. He was supplanted as the regular shortstop by rookie Spike Owen during the following year. Success with the Orioles The Baltimore Orioles purchased his contract on June 30, 1983. In his first Orioles game on July 1, versus the Detroit Tigers, he drove in six runs with a three-run homer and a bases-loaded double, leading the Orioles to a victory in the city where he grew up. His biggest contribution was on defense. Manager Joe Altobelli explained Cruz's importance to the ballclub: Shortstop Cal Ripken, Jr. praised him even further: Cruz, along with teammates at the bottom of the batting order Rick Dempsey and Rich Dauer, were famously nicknamed \\"The Three Stooges.\\" Cruz was \\"Curly,\\" while Dempsey and Dauer were \\"Moe\\" and \\"Larry,\\" respectively.Fimrite, Ron. \\"He was Moe Than Philly Could Handle,\\" Sports Illustrated, October 24, 1983. After winning the American League Pennant three games to one over a former team of Cruz's, the White Sox, the Orioles captured the 1983 World Series Championship in five games over Cruz's original ballclub, the Phillies. His MLB career came to an end on March 29, 1985, when he was released by the Orioles in spring training. Orioles teammate Gary Roenicke said of Cruz's two seasons in Baltimore, \\"Even though he'd played for many other teams, he always thought of himself as an Oriole. He had an outgoing personality ... and he kept everybody loose.\\" Death Cruz died on September 2, 2008, at age 52, while swimming in the pool at the apartment complex where he lived in Bullhead City, Arizona.

Percy writes at what he sees as the conclusion of the modern age and attempts to create a middle ground between the two dying ideologies of that age: Judeo-Christian ethics, which give the individual freedom and responsibility; and the rationalism of science and behavioralism, which positions man as an organism in an environment and strips him of this freedom. \\"The Delta Factor\\" \\"The Delta Factor,\\" first published in January 1975 in the Southern Review, sets out the overall themes of the entire book. Percy begins by asking why modern humans are so sad despite the 20th century's technological innovations and unprecedented levels of comfort. More specifically, he is interested in why humans feel happy in bad situations and sad in good situations (a question also posed in his novel The Last Gentleman). He posits that this overarching sadness is due to contemporary society's position between two ages: the modern age, which is more or less slowly becoming out of date, and a new age, which is dawning but has not yet truly dawned. The anthropological theories of the modern age, according to Percy, \\"no longer work and the theories of the new age are not yet known\\" (7). Percy therefore sees his task as coming up with a new theory of humanity, which he chooses to center on language, the human attribute that separates us from the animals; The Message in the Bottle will attempt to explain humans' strange behavior and unexplained sadness by explaining how humans deal with language and symbols. Percy says that the current theories of humanity make us into a sort of monster, a \\"centaur organism-plus soul . . . one not different from beasts yet somehow nevertheless possessing 'freedom' and 'dignity' and 'individuality' and 'mind' and such\\" (9). Modern humanity is, then, the collision of Judeo-Christian ethics and its focus upon individual freedom and scientific behaviorism, which says that humans are no different from the animals—in other words, modern people believe themselves to be no different from animals and yet somehow above them. What's more, no existing research really deals with the question of how language really works, of how human beings use and understand the symbols of linguistics. Percy puts this question into a sort of no-man's land, what he calls a \\"terra incognita\\" (17), between linguistics and psychology, the former of which deals with the results of language and the latter of which deals with the way people respond to language. The Delta Factor, Percy's theory of language, is framed in the context of the story of Helen Keller's learning to say and sign the word water while Annie Sullivan poured water over her hands and repeatedly made the signs for the word into her hand. A behaviorist linguistic reading of this scene might suggest a causal relationship—in other words, Keller felt Sullivan's sign-language stimulus in her hand and in response made a connection in her brain between the signifier and the signified. This is too simplistic a reading, says Percy, because Keller was receiving from both the signifier (the sign for water) and the referent (the water itself). This creates a triangle between water (the word), water (the liquid), and Helen, in which all three corners lead to the other two corners and which Percy says is \\"absolutely irreducible\\" (40). This linguistic triangle is thus the building block for all of human intelligence. The moment when this Delta Δ entered the mind of a person—whether this happened via random chance or through the intervention of a deity—that person became human. Further, in Delta Δ, the corners of the triangle are removed from their behaviorist contexts. Helen Keller, in other words, becomes something other than just an organism in her environment because she is coupling two unrelated things——water the word and water the liquid——together. Likewise, water the liquid is made something more than water the liquid because Keller has coupled it with the arbitrary sound water, and water the word becomes more than just the sound of the word water (and the shape of the sign language for water). In this way, \\"the Delta phenomenon yielded a new world and maybe a new way of getting at it. It was not the world of organisms and environments but just as real and twice as human\\" (44)——humans are made whole by the Delta Δ where the popular notions of religion and science had split us in two. \\"The Loss of the Creature\\" \\"The Loss of the Creature\\" is an exploration of the way the more or less objective reality of the individual is obscured in and ultimately lost to systems of education and classification. Percy begins by discussing the Grand Canyon—he says that, whereas García López de Cárdenas, who discovered the canyon, was amazed and awed by it, the modern-day sightseer can see it only through the lens of \\"the symbolic complex which has already been formed in the sightseer's mind\\" (47). Because of this, the sightseer does not appreciate the Grand Canyon on its own merits; he appreciates it based on how well or poorly it conforms to his preexisting image of the Grand Canyon, formed by the mythology surrounding it. What is more, instead of approaching the site directly, he approaches it by taking photographs, which, Percy says, is not approaching it at all. By these two processes—judging the site on postcards and taking his own pictures of it instead of confronting it himself—the tourist subjugates the present to the past and to the future, respectively. Percy suggests several ways of getting around this situation, almost all of them involving bypassing the structure of organized approaches—one could go off the beaten path, for example, or be removed from the presence of other tourists by a national disaster. This bypassing, however, can lead to other problems: Namely, the methods used are not necessarily authentic; \\"some stratagems obviously serve other purposes than that of providing access to being\\" (51). Percy gives the example of a pair of tourists who, disgusted with the proliferation of other tourists in the popular areas of Mexico, stumble into a tiny village where a festival is taking place. The couple enjoys themselves and repeatedly tells themselves, \\"Now we are really living,\\" but Percy judges their experience inauthentic because they are constantly concerned that things may not go perfectly. When they return home, they tell an ethnologist friend of theirs about the festival and how they wish he could have been there. This, says Percy, is their real problem: \\"They wanted him, not to share their experience, but to certify their experience as genuine\\" (53). The layman in modern society, then, surrenders his ownership to the specialist, whom he believes has authority over him in his field. This creates a caste system of sorts between laymen and experts, but Percy says that the worst thing about this system is that the layman does not even realize what it is he has lost. This is most evident in education. Percy alludes to a metaphor he had used in \\"The Delta Factor,\\" that of the literature student who cannot read a Shakespearean sonnet that is easily read by a post apocalyptic survivor in Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. The literature student is blocked from the sonnet by the educational system built around it, what Percy calls its \\"package.\\" Instead of transmitting the subject of education, education often transmits only itself, and the student does not view the subject as open and delightful, nor does he view himself as sovereign. Percy offers two ways around this, both involving, as did his solution to the problem of the Grand Canyon, an indirect approach. Either the student can suffer some sort of ordeal that opens the text to him in a new way; or else he can be apprenticed to a teacher who takes a very unusual approach to the subject. He suggests that biology students be occasionally taught literature, and vice versa. The overall effect of this obscuration by structure is one of the basic conditions of modern society: The individual layman is reduced to being a consumer. The individual thing becomes lost to the systems of classification and theory created for the consumer, and the individual man loses all sense of ownership. The solution to this problem, according to Percy, is not to get rid of museums but for \\"the sightseer to be prepared to enter into a struggle to recover a sight from a museum\\" (62). \\"Metaphor as Mistake\\" Percy begins \\"Metaphor as Mistake\\" (1958) with five metaphors which were misunderstood; these misunderstood metaphors, he says, have nevertheless \\"resulted in an authentic poetic experience . . . an experience, moreover, which was notably absent before the mistake was made\\" (65). Metaphor, in Percy's view, is a way of getting at the real nature of a thing by comparing it to something that it does not resemble on the surface. It becomes a tool for ontological exploration. Existing inquiries have failed to notice this, however, because they either abstract their viewpoints from both effective and ineffective metaphors (this is the path of philosophy) or focus on the individual effects of the individual poet (this is the path of literary criticism). As he does in \\"The Delta Factor,\\" Percy wishes to seek a middle ground between these two extremes. He makes it clear, however, that the metaphor has scientific, rather than strictly poetic, value for him;he sees metaphor as a method of getting at the way things actually are. Two qualifications exist for the metaphor as mistake: It must be given by an authority figure, and it must have a certain aura of mystery around it. In this way, the metaphor becomes both right (given by authority) and wrong (not strictly true as a descriptor). Percy's example is of a boy on a hunting trip who sees a bird and asks what it is. The African-American accompanying him and his father calls the bird a blue dollar, which excites the boy until his father corrects him and tells him the bird is actually a blue darter. The term blue darter may describe what the bird does and what color it is, says Percy, but blue dollar in some mystical way gets at what the bird actually is. When the boy saw the bird, he formed a subjective impression of it—what Percy calls the bird's \\"apprehended nature\\" (72)--and in some sense the mistaken name blue dollar gets right at the heart of that apprehended nature. In this way, the metaphor becomes both science and poetry; it is a sort of subjective science, the ontology of the world as it appears to the individual. Percy says that we can only understand reality through metaphor. We never perceive the world--\\"We can only conceive being, sidle up to it by laying something else alongside\\" (72). All language, then, and perhaps all intelligence, are therefore metaphorical. When one person makes a metaphor, the people who hear it hope that it corresponds to their subjective understanding of reality—an understanding they may or may not even be consciously aware of. The poet, according to Percy, has a double-edged task: His metaphors must ring true, but they must be flexible enough to reverberate with his audience and for them to gain a new understanding of the things to which they refer. The poet must refer to things we already know, but he must do so in new ways; in this, he gives his audience access to their own private experiences. This can lead to a sort of blind groping for metaphors, however, a process which Percy sees as effective but harmful. Authority and intention are essential for metaphors to be shared between the Namer and the Hearer. \\"The Man on the Train\\"\\"Notes for a Novel About the End of the World\\" \\"A Novel About the End of the World\\" makes a striking counterpart to Percy's novel Love in the Ruins, subtitled \\"The Adventures of a Bad Catholic at a Time Near the End of the World\\" and published only four years after the essay. The apocalyptic novel is a form of prophecy, a warning about what will happen if society does not change its ways. This sort of novel is written by a particular type of novelist, one defined not by his quality but by his goals. Percy refers to this novelist as a \\"religious novelist\\" but notes that he includes atheists such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus in this category because of their \\"passionate conviction about man's nature, the world, and man's obligation in the world\\" (103). The religious novelist, says Percy, has very different concerns than the mainstream of the society in which he lives—so different, in fact, one must decide whether society is blind or whether the novelist is insane or a charlatan. The central difference between the novelist and the rest of society is that the former tends to be pessimistic and the latter tends to be optimistic. The novelist has a \\"profound disquiet\\" (106). The novelist is set off in particular against the scientist and against the \\"new theologian\\"—from the former because the novelists insists on the individual while science measures only categories, and from the latter because the novelist still believes in original sin. The Christian novelist in particular recognizes that the problem is not that Christianity is not relevant to modern society but that man's blind acceptance of \\"the magical aura of science, whose credentials he accepts for all sectors of reality\\" (113) is changing his consciousness to the point where he can no longer recognize the Gospel. The novel about the end of the world, then, is an attempt to shock the complacent reader out of his scientism and into the light of the real world. \\"The Message in the Bottle\\" In \\"The Message in the Bottle,\\" Percy attempts to separate information into two categories: knowledge and news. The essay is built on an extended metaphor of a castaway with amnesia who remembers nothing but the island he washes up on and who creates a new life with the natives of the island. The castaway frequently finds on the beach bottles that have one-sentence messages on the inside, such as \\"There is fresh water in the next cove,\\" \\"The British are coming to Concord,\\" or \\"Lead melts at 330 degrees.\\" A group of scientists lives on the island, and they separate these messages into two categories: empirical facts and analytic facts. The castaway is disturbed by this classification, however, because it does not take into account the messages' effect on the reader. Thus, he comes up with the categories of knowledge and news. Knowledge belongs to science, to psychology and to the arts; simply put, it is that \\"which can be arrived at anywhere by anyone and at any time\\" (125). News, on the other hand, bears directly and immediately on his life. The scientists, because of their commitment to objectivity above all else, cannot recognize the difference between these two categories. A piece of news is not verified the way a piece of knowledge is—whereas knowledge can be verified empirically, news can be verified empirically only after the hearer has already heeded its call. The castaway must first, however, decide when to heed the call of a piece of news and when to ignore it. Percy sets forth three criteria for the acceptance of a piece of news: (a) its relevance to the hearer's predicament; (b) the trustworthiness of the newsbearer; and (c) its likelihood or possibility. As news depends so heavily on its bearer, the messages in bottles that the castaway finds cannot be sufficient credential in and of themselves. The castaway must know something about the person who wrote them. The problem with modern society is that too many people attempt to cure their feelings of homelessness by seeking knowledge in the fields of science and art. Their real problem, says Percy, is that their feelings of homelessness come from their being stranded on the island—they should be looking for news from across the seas. Percy links this distinction between news and knowledge to how the world understands the Christian gospel. He writes that the gospel must be understood as a piece of news and not a piece of knowledge. To Percy, the gospel is news from across the seas. \\"The Mystery of Language\\"\\"Toward a Triadic Theory of Meaning\\"\\"The Symbolic Structure of Interpersonal Process\\"\\"Culture: The Antinomy of the Scientific Method\\"\\"Semiotic and a Theory of Knowledge\\"\\"Symbol, Consciousness, and Intersubjectivity\\"\\"Symbol as Hermeneutic in Existentialism\\"\\"Symbol as Need\\"\\"A Theory of Language\\"References * Percy, Walker.

They released their only two albums (The Moth Confesses and the eponymous The Neon Philharmonic) in 1969, and they scored a Top 20 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart with \\"Morning Girl\\", which featured the Nashville Symphony Orchestra, when it hit the Top 40 in May of that year and rose to number 17 on Billboard and number 15 on the Cash Box chart.Joel Whitburn, The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits, p. 330 (Billboard Books, 1992). The band hit the charts again with \\"Heighdy-Ho Princess\\" in 1970. The group was produced by Saussy, Gant, and Bob McCluskey, and engineered by Ronald Gant, Don's brother. The group disbanded in 1975 after releasing numerous non-album singles. Although the first album stated \\"Borges Forever!\\", the group's concertmaster is really named Pierre Menard, and it is not a reference to the Jorge Luis Borges story Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote,, Saussy was not conscious of the connection.Andy Zax. \\"A Conversation with Tupper Saussy.\\" Liner Notes, Brilliant Colors: The Complete Warner Bros. Recordings, p. 11 The bulk of the group's output was released by Warner Bros./Seven Arts Records. In 1972, they moved to TRX and produced another single, \\"Annie Poor\\" / \\"Love Will Find a Way\\", after which the group disbanded. The Neon Philharmonic name was sold to producer David Kastle, who put out additional singles released by MCA Records and London Records. At least one Saussy song, \\"Making Out the Best I Can\\", was recorded by this group and engineered by Ronald Gant. Along with its flipside recording, \\"So Glad You're a Woman\\", written by Ray Williams and Ron Demmans (MCA-40158 (MC 4810), 1975), the instrumentation was limited to synthesizers, guitar and drums. These later singles have no other connection to the original group. Shaun Cassidy, David's younger brother, did a cover version of \\"Morning Girl, Later\\" (simply titled \\"Morning Girl\\") in 1976, which did not chart in the US, but did well in The Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. The song was also covered by The Lettermen. The group is not to be confused with the German group The Neon Philharmonic Orchestra, which arranged many classical pieces in medleys in a similar style in the 1980s and 90s and covered Walter Murphy's \\"A Fifth of Beethoven\\".

A very-low-calorie diet (VLCD), also known as semistarvation diet and crash diet, is a type of diet with very or extremely low daily food energy consumption. Often described as a fad diet, it is defined as a diet of per day or less. Modern medically supervised VLCDs use total meal replacements, with regulated formulations in Europe and Canada which contain the recommended daily requirements for vitamins, minerals, trace elements, fatty acids, protein and electrolyte balance. Carbohydrates may be entirely absent, or substituted for a portion of the protein; this choice has important metabolic effects. Medically supervised VLCDs have specific therapeutic applications for rapid weight loss, such as in morbid obesity or before a bariatric surgery, using formulated, nutritionally complete liquid meals containing 800 kilocalories or less per day for a maximum of 12 weeks. Unmonitored VLCDs with insufficient or unbalanced nutrients can cause sudden death by cardiac arrest either by starvation or during refeeding.  Definition  Very-low-calorie diets (VLCDs) are diets of or less energy intake per day, whereas low-calorie diets are between 1000-1200 kcal per day.  Health effects  The routine use of VLCDs is not recommended due to safety concerns, but this approach can be used under medical supervision if there is a clinical rationale for rapid weight loss in obese individuals, as part of a \\"multi-component weight management strategy\\" with continuous support and for a maximum of 12 weeks, according to the NICE 2014 guidelines. The US dietary guidelines recommend that VLCDs can be used for weight loss in obese individuals only in limited circumstances and only under supervision by experienced personnel in a medical care setting where the individual can be medically monitored and high-intensity lifestyle intervention can be provided. For the general public, VLCDs are not recommended due to low evidence. As there are considerable risks of starvation with an inadequately composed or supervised VLCD, people attempting these diets must be monitored closely by a physician to prevent complications. VLCDs appear to be more effective than behavioral weight loss programs or other diets, achieving approximately more weight loss at 1 year and greater sustained weight loss after several years. When used in routine care, there is evidence that VLCDs achieve average weight loss at 1 year around or about 4% more weight loss over the short term. VLCDs can achieve higher short-term weight loss compared to other more modest or gradual calorie restricted diets, and the maintained long-term weight loss is similar or greater. VLCDs were shown to reduce lean body mass. Combining VLCD with other obesity therapies yield more effective results in weight loss. Low- calorie and very-low-calorie diets may produce faster weight loss within the first 1–2 weeks of starting compared to other diets, but this superficially faster loss is due to glycogen depletion and water loss in the lean body mass and is regained quickly afterward. VLCDs are efficient and recommended for liver fat reduction and weight loss before bariatric surgery. A 2001 review found that VLCD has no serious harmful effect when done under medical supervision, for periods of 8–16 weeks with an average weight loss of 1.5-2.5 kg/week. However, VLCD may increase the risk of developing gallstones if the fat content of VLCD is not sufficient, but data is lacking to know the precise amount of fat that is necessary to avoid gallstones formation. Indeed, dietary fat stimulates gall bladder contraction, thus, if following a fat-free VLCD, the bladder does not empty. Another potential side effect is constipation (depending on the fiber content of the diet). VLCD were not found to increase food cravings, and on the contrary, appear to reduce food cravings more than low-calorie diets. Previous formulations (medical or commercial) of carbohydrate-free very low calorie diets provided 200–800 kcal/day and maintained protein intake, but eliminated any carbohydrate intake and sometimes fat intake as well. These diets subject the body to starvation and produce an average weekly weight loss of . However, the total lack of carbohydrates avoids protein sparing and thus produce a loss of lean muscle mass, as well as other adverse side effects such as increased risks of gout, and electrolyte imbalances, and are thus disadvised. Total diet replacement programs are the modern formulations regulated in Europe and Canada to ensure the recommended daily intake of necessary nutrients, vitamins and electrolyte balance. Compared to older VLCD formulas, the total diet replacements better preserve lean body mass, reduce known side effects and improve . Unmonitored VLCDs with insufficient macronutrient and mineral intake have the potential to cause an electrolyte imbalance and sudden death via ventricular tachycardia either by starvation or upon refeeding.  History and society  The earliest data on VLCDs come from the aftermath of World War II, when several scientific experiments were undertaken to examine what conditions could lead to starvation and how to rehabilitate safely to eating, such as the Minnesota Starvation Experiment, in an effort to reduce the casualties caused by famine following the war. VLCD is used for clinical purposes since at least the 1980s. In 1978, 58 people died in the United States after following very-low- calorie liquid protein diets. Following this event, the FDA requires since 1984 that protein VLCDs providing fewer than 400 calories a day to carry a warning that they can cause serious illness and need to be followed under medical supervision. However, newer regulations require this warning only on protein products that aim to provide more than half of a person's calories and promoted for weight loss or as a food supplement. That way, protein VLCD drinks such as Slim-Fast, although each providing less than 400 calories, were able to avoid warnings by recommending that users \\"also eat one sensible meal each day\\". In 1991, the Federal Trade Commission charged three liquid VLCD companies, Optifast, Medifast and Ultrafast, with deceptive advertisement, which was settled after the companies agreed to stop using what the FTC alleged as deceptive claims, about the long-term results and the safety of these diets.

He was Belgian MP from 1965 to 1988 and senator from 1992 to 1995. He was also twice minister, from 1981 to 1985 in the first Flemish Government and between 1988 and 1991 in the Belgian federal government Martens VIII. He was further president of the Flemish political party Volksunie between 1975 and 1979. He was one of the founders of federalism in Belgium. After the dissolution of the Volksunie, he chose the new party Spirit. Career During World War II Schiltz was a member of the Nationaal-Socialistische Jeugd Vlaanderen (English: National Socialist Youth Flanders). This brought him in jail for some months after the war. He studied Law, Economic Science and Thomistic Philosophy at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, where he became a member of the In 1953 he became a lawyer and an economy teacher. In 1958, he was elected member of the Antwerp municipal council, which he would remain until 1998. After a short period with the (then belgicist) Christian People's Party, he became a member of the Volksunie in 1963. From 1975 to 1979 he was party president. During that time, he steered the party into a more left- liberal direction. He participated in drawing up the Egmont pact, that in certain Flemish circles was seen as treason. The Belgian government didn't survive the disapproval of the pact in parliament. The new, more liberal direction of the Volksunie, and the cooperation in the Egmont pact were the reason for the creation by the more radical, right wing-conservative part of the Volksunie, of two new small parties, the Vlaams Nationale Partij (Flemish National Party, VNP), presided by Karel Dillen, and the Vlaamse Volkspartij (Flemish Popular Party, VVP) with the former VU senator . Later, both parties merged into the Vlaams Blok. Together with Wilfried Martens and Jean-Luc Dehaene, Hugo Schiltz was at the basis of the reform of Belgium into a federal state. From 1994 to 1998, Schiltz was alderman for finances in Antwerp in an anti-Vlaams Blok coalition. In 1995 he received the honorary title of Minister of State from the Belgian king. After the dissolution of the Volksunie into the New Flemish Alliance and Spirit in 2001, Schiltz became a member of the latter. In that year, he resumed practising law, first with Ernst & Young and Peeters Advocaten, later he founded Laurius-Schiltz-Verschoeven ADVC. of Open Vld is a son by his second marriage.

The term plasticulture refers to the practice of using plastic materials in agricultural applications. The plastic materials themselves are often and broadly referred to as \\"ag plastics.\\" Plasticulture ag plastics include soil fumigation film, irrigation drip tape/tubing, plastic plant packaging cord, nursery pots and bales, but the term is most often used to describe all kinds of plastic plant/soil coverings. Such coverings range from plastic mulch film, row coverings, high and low tunnels (polytunnels), to plastic greenhouses. Types of plastics used Polyethylene (PE) is the plastic film used by the majority of growers because of its affordability, flexibility and easy manufacturing.Allingham Yael (1992). [Plastic Sheets for use in Agriculture]. United States Patent. It comes in a variety of thicknesses, such as a low density form (LDPE) as well as a linear low density form (LLDPE). These can be modified by addition of certain elements to the plastic that give it properties beneficial to plant growth such as reduced water loss, UV stabilization to cool soil and prevent insects, elimination of photosynthetically active radiation to prevent weed growth, IR opacity, antidrip/antifog, and fluorescence. Polypropylene (PP) is often used for agricultural plant packaging cord.PP cord used in agriculture 1 PP cord used in agriculture 2 Applications=Greenhouses and walk-in tunnel covers A greenhouse is a large structure in which it is possible to stand and work with automated ventilation. High tunnels are hoop houses, manually ventilated by rolling up the sides. Greenhouse and high tunnel films are usually within the parameters of 80-220μm thick and 20m wide, and have a life span between 6–45 months dependent on several factors. Monolayer polyethylene films are better suited for less extreme environmental conditions, while multilayer covers made of three layers, one EVA19 layer inserted between two low-density polyethylene layers has been shown to have a better performance under harsh conditions.Adam A, Kouider S.A., Hamou A, Saiter J.A. (2005). Studies of polyethylene multi layer films used as greenhouse covers under Saharan climatic conditions Polymer Testing, 24(7):e834–838. Small tunnel covers Small tunnel covers are about 1m wide and 1m high, and have a thinner polyethylene film than the large tunnel covers, usually below 80μm. Their lifetime is also shorter than that of the larger versions; they usually have a usable life span of 6–8 months. Use of small tunnels is less popular than both the more expensive but durable greenhouses/walk-in tunnels and the cheaper plastic mulch. Plastic mulch Plastic mulch in a field near Merstone, Isle of Wight, UK Mulching is when a thin plastic film is placed over the ground, poking holes at regular intervals for seeds to be planted in, or placing it directly over plants in the beginning stages of growth. The films remain in place for the duration of the cultivation (usually 2–4 months) and usually have a thickness of 12-80μm. The main functions of plastic mulch are to insulate and maintain a consistent temperature and humidity of the soil, preventing evaporation of moisture from the soil, minimization of seedtime and harvest, prevent weed growth, and to prevent erosion. Pigmented https://agriplasticscommunity.com/beyond-the- colour-of-mulch-white-black-combination/ or colourless films can be used, each with specific advantages and disadvantages over the other. Black films prevent weed growth, but do not transmit light to heat up the soil; clear films transmit light and heat the soil, but promote weed growth. Photosensitive films have been developed that are pigmented to prevent weed growth, but still transmit light to heat the soil. These photosensitive films are more costly than either the clear or black polyethylene sheeting. Black plastic mulch controls evaporation from the soil, improves soil water retention. Plastic mulching proved to reduce irrigation requirements in pepper by 14-29% because of elimination of soil evaporation.Abu-Awwad A.M. (1998). [Effect of mulch and irrigation water amounts on soil evaporation and transpiration] J. Agron. Crop Sci., 18:e55–59. Flowering time was also reduced in okra when black plastic mulch was used; the plants reached 50% flowering 3–6 days earlier than un- mulched plots. Plant height in okra was significantly increased with black plastic mulch use compared to those grown in bare soil. Evaporation from soil accounts for 25-50% of water used in irrigation, using plastic mulch prevents much of this evaporation and thus reduces the amount of water needed to grow the crop.Ramakrishna A. et al (2006). [Effect of mulch on soil temperature, moisture, weed infestation and yield of groundnut in northern Vietnam] Field Crops Res., 95:e115–125. This conservation of water makes plastic mulch favourable for farmers in dry and arid climates where water is a limited resource. As the second most used ag plastic in the world, the volume of plastic mulch used every year is estimated at 700,000t. Origins and development around the world The first use of plastic film in agriculture was to in an effort to make a cheaper version of a glasshouse. In 1948 Professor E.M. Emmert built the first plastic greenhouse, a wooden structure covered with cellulose acetate film. He later switched this to a more effective polyethylene film. After this introduction of plastic film to agriculture it began being used at a larger scale around the world by the early 1950s to replace paper for mulching vegetables.Espí E, Salmerón A, Fontecha A, García Y, and Real A.I. (2006). Plastic Films for Agricultural Applications Journal of Plastic Filming and Sheeting, 22(85):e85-102. By 1999 almost 30 million acres worldwide were covered in plastic mulch. Only a small percentage of this was in the United States (185 000 acres), the majority of this plastic growth was happening in economically poor areas of the world and previously unproductive desert regions, such as Almeria in southern Spain.Miles C, Kolker K, Reed J, Becker J. Alternatives to Plastic Mulch for Organic Vegetable Production. Washington State University, 2005. The largest concentrations of greenhouses around the world are mainly found in two areas, with 80% throughout the Far East (China, Japan, Korea), and 15% in the Mediterranean basin. The area of greenhouse cover is still increasing at a fast rate, during the last decade it is estimated that it has been growing by 20% every year. Areas such as the Middle East and Africa are growing in their use of plastic greenhouses by 15-20% per year, compared to the weak growth in more developed and economically stable areas such as Europe. China leads the world's growth at 30% per year, translating into a volume of plastic film reaching 1,000,000 t/year. In 2006 80% of the area covered by plastic mulch is found in China where it has a growth rate of 25% per year; this is the highest in the world. Since its introduction in the 1950s, plastic film has been designed and developed to increase produce yield, increase produce size and shorten growth time. Developments in plastic film include durability, optical (ultraviolet, visible, near infrared, and middle infrared) properties, and the antidrip or antifog effect. Recent developments in this area include UV- blocking, NIR-blocking, fluorescent, and ultrathermic films. Large-scale usage in southern Spain Campo de Dalías around El Ejido and Roquetas de Mar in southern Spain. The use of plasticulture in agriculture is growing rapidly, perhaps nowhere more visibly than around Almería in southern Spain. The eastern approaches to Almería, north of the airport, are densely covered, as is a large area further northeast, surrounding the towns of Campohermoso, Los Pipaces and Los Grillos (close to Níjar). The densest concentration lies about 20 km southwest of Almería, where almost the entire Campo de Dalías, a low-lying cape, is now under plastic (an estimated area of 20,000 hectares). Further west, a similar, but smaller, coastal plain around Carchuna, southeast of Motril, is similarly enveloped. The technique is not restricted to the plains; it is also applied to wide terraces on the sides of shallow valleys, as the valley north of Castell de Ferro shows. Elsewhere along the Costa Tropical and the Costa del Sol, particularly between Almería and Málaga, fruit trees growing on terraces in steeper valleys may be covered with vast tents of plastic netting. Environmental aspects As (non-biodegradable) plastics are used in agriculture, there is a risk of it ending up in the soil, thus polluting it in the process. Recycling One significant component of plasticulture is the disposal of used ag plastics. Technologies exist which allow for many ag plastics to be recycled into viable plastic resins for reuse in the plastics manufacturing industry.Plastic mulch film recycling process Agricultural plastics recycling website, accessed 07.09.08 Legislation on plastic use in agriculture In the European Union, Directive 2008/98/EC on waste management is in place, of which article 8 states \\"each member state may introduce the ERP concept into its own legal framework in addition to deciding how to encourage manufacturers to participate in the prevention, re-use, recycling and recovery of used plastic products\\"Agricultural plastics european regulation: principle In addition, in 2018, the European Commission published a communication laying out a strategy for plastics in a circular economy. It mentioned curbing plastic waste and littering, for instance by reducing single-use plastics, tackling sources of marine litter at sea, restricting the use of oxo-degradable plastics and curbing micro-plastics pollution. In 2020, the EU finally released its Circular Economy Action Plan. It included a set of measures to reduce plastic litter and address the presence of microplastics in the environment. It also expressed addressing sustainability issues by developing a policy framework on biodegradable or compostable plastics.Circular economy action plant text See also Bioplastics * Soil contamination * Cleanup options for contaminated soil * Plastic pollution ReferencesFurther reading * Hulse, Sara (2000).

In the film, Hercules has given up his days of traveling and has settled down to spend some time with his family. When a distant village is threatened by an unseen monster, Hercules is called upon to help save the village from the monster. Plot In a sun-dappled forest, two men are searching for buried treasure. They pace out the step given with the map, and discover a cave overgrown with bushes. The two men break through the plants and enter the cave. In the cave they find a huge wooden door, as they try to get through the door, a monster breaks through the door and chases after them. One man is captured and the other flees as the monster tells him to bring Hercules. Meanwhile, Hercules works on his farms, he sees his sons fighting and tells them that they should not fight. They say that Hercules fights, Hercules explains that he only fights when he has to and only to prevent other people from being harmed. He tells about the time when he had to fight Eryx the boxer to stop him from killing anymore people. He asks the boys if they understand, and they say they do. Later that evening, Hercules is working in the stable, Zeus appears and they chat. Hercules tells Zeus that there have been no monsters for a while, which is good as he has now settled down with Deianeira to raise the children. Zeus gives him a scale from a sea serpent and Hercules remembers the time when he and Deianeira were swallowed by a sea serpent while looking for the lost city of Troy. While day-dreaming he snaps back to reality at the dinner table to find the dog eating his dinner. Back in the cave, the Minotaur broods in wait for Hercules. At night the children ask their father to tell them a story, Ilea asks for Hercules to tell her about when he and Deianeira first met. Hercules begins relating how the fire had vanished from the Earth and that Deianeira's village needed fire, and how he got the fire back from Hera's temple. Halfway through the story Hercules realises the children are asleep. He and Deianeira retire to bed and she asks him if he misses his adventures and battling monsters, he says truthfully that he does miss it. The following day, Hercules is working in the stables and sees something flit past the door, he goes to look but sees nothing. As he walks back into the stable a man jumps down upon him, Hercules turns to see it is Iolaus. They begin talking about their adventures and the time when they had to fight the Lernaean Hydra that Hera had sent to kill them. The two men go inside to get a drink, Iolaus tells Hercules that he met a man who taught him some new moves that allow smaller men to overpower a bigger man. Hercules says he won't fight Iolaus, but he is eventually persuaded. The two men strip off their tops and prepare to spar. When Hercules attacks Iolaus he is overpowered by the smaller man, but after a short while Hercules gets the best of Iolaus as he sees Deianeira and Ilea standing in the doorway. Deianeira tells Iolaus that since Hercules gave up his adventures he has become depressed. A man arrives at the stable looking for Hercules, he tells him that he must help his village and that a monster has taken his brother. Hercules says he can't go and the man says he has to because he is Hercules. Later that evening Deianeria asks him why he refused to help and he tells her that he promised to stay and raise the children with her. She tells him that he shouldn't try to stop being Hercules, not for her or the children. She tells him to go and the next day her and Iolaus set off for Alturia. As they travel to Alturia a young couple are looking for somewhere quiet, they find the cave and enter. While they are making out the Minotaur comes and attacks them. When Hercules and Iolaus arrive in Alturia they ask a woman where the monster is and she tells Hercules that there isn't any monster. Underneath the village the Minotaur swears that Hercules will pay, Zeus appears and tells the Minotaur that he still has not learned his lesson, he replies that he has been feeding on hate. Minotaur taunts Zeus because he was unable to kill the Minotaur. Hercules and Iolaus are in a tavern and end up fighting some men because they don't believe that he is really Hercules. Outside the tavern three men are killed and Hercules goes to investigate, only to be found by the villagers. They think he killed the men and chase him and Iolaus. The man who had asked for Hercules's help comes and takes Hercules to the cave where his brother was captured. Zeus appears and tells Hercules what the monster is and why he wants Hercules. He asks Hercules to kill the Minotaur, and he enters the cave. In the center of the cave he finds the Minotaur, who challenges Hercules. They begin fighting and as Hercules is about to kill the Minotaur, the creature reveals that he is really Hercules' brother Gryphus and Hercules cannot kill him. The Minotaur then attacks Hercules and Hercules ends up killing him by throwing him onto a stalagmite as Zeus arrives. As Gryphus lies dying, Hercules says he is sorry Zeus had to lose a son this way. Zeus says to Hercules that Gryphus was lost the day he tried to lead the people against him and that it didn't have to be this way. When Gryphus begs for Zeus not to let him die like this, Zeus changes Gryphus back to mortal form as a mist covers over Gryphus' dead body. As Zeus declares that Gryphus is now \\"free,\\" Hercules helps Iolaus and the other people being held by the Minotaur and the two brothers are reunited. With the people of the village now safe and Iolaus freed, the two men journey back home.

Football career Born in Falmouth, Cornwall, Miller was a product of the Falmouth Town youth scheme playing mostly in midfield before being persuaded to take up goalkeeping in the Combination League team by then manager Keith Rashleigh as a 15 year old. Miller joined Newquay and enjoyed great success including breaking the South Western League goals conceded record under manager Trevor Mewton. Miller was then signed by Terry Cooper (ex Leeds and England) for Exeter City where he was a key figure in their Fourth Division Championship winning team, before following Cooper to Birmingham City, Crystal Palace, Barnsley, Bristol Rovers and Derby County (on loan), over an eighteen-year period. During this time he also spent three seasons at Watford, earning the Player of the Season award twice. His move to Premiership side Crystal Palace from Watford in June 1997 saw the most expensive fee of his career being paid: £1.5million. He had been expected to sign for Nottingham Forest but the East Midlands club failed to agree a fee. He initially retired from football in August 2005, but in February 2006 he was signed by Southampton manager George Burley, whose side was short on goalkeepers, with Bartosz Białkowski out with an injury, Miller was seen as cover for Paul Smith. Miller displaced Smith in the first team and played the final seven games of Southampton's 2005–06 season, helping the team to five wins and a draw. This form was appreciated and the club offered him a one-year extension on his contract, which he accepted. In January 2007, he signed a one-month loan deal with League Two strugglers Torquay United, making his debut on 26 January 2007 in the 4–1 win at home to Grimsby Town, United's first win in 20 league games. He returned to Southampton at the end of the loan spell and was released in May 2007. Returning to non-league football, Miller joined Bodmin Town in October 2007.

It continues today as a major brand under Goodyear. Name changes Kelly-Springfield Tire Company plant in Akron, Ohio c. 1920 1915 Kelly-Springfield tire ad, from a Kentucky newspaper. The company was sold to the McMillin group in 1899 for $1 million. Arthur Grant received $166,000 in stock and $33,000 in cash for his share of the company. The McMillin group renamed the new company Consolidated Rubber Tire Company and it continued under that name until 1914. The name Kelly-Springfield Tire Company was given to the New York City sales subsidiary in 1911. Consolidated's name was changed in 1914. \\"The\\" was added to the front of the name in 1932 and it became The Kelly-Springfield Tire Company. Manufacturing was done at a plant in Akron, Ohio, and another plant was bought in Wooster, Ohio, in 1915 and used until 1921. The growth of the company continued until the president, Van Cartwell, decided to build a new plant in Cumberland, Maryland. An agreement was signed on November 4, 1916, details of which called for the city of Cumberland to provide a free site and $750,000 toward construction of the plant. The city of Cumberland also agreed to make improvements for roads, water and sewerage lines and other essential construction. In turn, once operating, the plant began to employ over 3,000 people and had a production capacity of five times the production capacity of the company until that point. The first tire was built on April 2, 1921. The Kelly Springfield Tire Company was sold in 1935 to the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company and Edmund S. Burke became president. He served as president from 1935 until 1959. The company operated as a wholly owned subdivision. The company continued to grow until 1962 when it added a new plant in Tyler, Texas. Another plant was built in 1963 at Freeport, Illinois, and the third plant in 1969 in Fayetteville, North Carolina. After 66 years of operation, the Cumberland plant was closed in 1987. In that same year the Lee Tire and Rubber Company came under the control of Kelly-Springfield. In November 1987 the corporate offices were moved to a new facility on Willowbrook Road in Cumberland. The original plant site was returned to the city. In 1994 the Kelly-Springfield Tire Company celebrated 100 years. At that time it was the oldest tire company in the United States. In the 1990s, Kelly-Springfield was absorbed by parent company Goodyear and moved its corporate headquarters to Akron, Ohio.

The piece was written while Lilburn was a student at the Royal College of Music, and was based on something of a challenge from his professor, Ralph Vaughan Williams. Reportedly, Vaughan Williams had begun his teaching by asking Lilburn to write fugues and part- songs; one day, though, he asked, \\"Isn't it time you composed something?\\" Lilburn responded by producing the overture. Lilburn later reported that his score greatly upset Sir George Dyson, to whom he brought it for piano reduction. Dyson found it to be a mess; he did, however, give it a read- through with the College orchestra. The overture is dedicated to Robert Lilburn, the composer's father. It is meant to celebrate the family farm and estate upon which Lilburn was born. In writing it, the composer once wrote that he was \\"left with that lovely Mark Twain image of Jim and Huckleberry drifting on their barge down that great river, looking up at the stars and wondering 'whether they was made, or only just happened'\\" The Drysdale Overture has been recorded twice by the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra: first under Sir William Southgate and second under Kenneth Young.

The last scene is of a shark leaping up in the ice cave and snatching a lone penguin, followed by the words \\"The End\\" on a black screen.

The video was released on May 24, 2006, the same date as the release of An Inconvenient Truth. The Wall Street Journal journalist Antonio Regalado noticed that, despite the amateur production values, a link to the video was the first sponsored listing when he performed a Google search for Al Gore, suggesting to him that someone was paying money to advertise this 'amateur' video. Regalado examined routing information on an e-mail sent by Toutsmith to Regalado and found that the e-mail had been sent from a computer associated with the DCI Group, in Washington, D.C..Episode Two Fake Grass and the Cyber City. 23 September 2006.

If the test is set up properly, a defect inside the test object creates a measurable response. The term \\"electromagnetic testing\\" is often intended to mean simply eddy-current testing (ECT). However, with an expanding number of electromagnetic and magnetic test methods, \\"electromagnetic testing\\" is more often used to mean the whole class of electromagnetic test methods, of which eddy-current testing is just one. also useful for the testing of drill pipes. Common methods *Eddy-current testing (ECT) is used to detect near-surface cracks and corrosion in metallic objects such as tubes and aircraft fuselage and structures. ECT is more commonly applied to nonferromagnetic materials, since in ferromagnetic materials the depth of penetration is relatively small. *Remote field testing (RFT) is used for nondestructive testing (NDT) of steel tubes and pipes. *Magnetic flux leakage testing (MFL) is also used for nondestructive testing (NDT) of steel tubes and pipes. At present RFT is more commonly used in small diameter tubes and MFL in larger diameter pipes over long travel distances. *Wire rope testing is MFL applied to steel cables, to detect broken strands of wire. *Magnetic particle inspection (MT or MPI) is a form of MFL where small magnetic particles in the form of a powder or liquid are sprayed on the magnetized steel test object and gather at surface-breaking cracks. *Alternating current field measurement (ACFM) is similar to eddy current applied to steel. Its most common application is to detect and size cracks in welds. from the company that developed it. *Pulsed eddy current enables the detection of large-volume metal loss in steel objects from a considerable stand-off, allowing steel pipes to be tested without removing insulation.

There are two types of red cooking: *Hongshao (): can be done in less than 20 minutes and usually does not require much water *Lu (): usually requires prolonged cooking of up to several hours and the items must be submerged in the cooking liquid. Red cooking is popular throughout most of northern, eastern, and southeastern China. The name is derived from the dark red-brown coloration of the cooked items and its sauce. Types Red cooked ribs thumb Soy sauce (usually a mix of light and dark soy sauce), fermented bean paste, red fermented tofu or rock sugar is commonly used to both flavor and impart a reddish brown hue to the items being cooked. Food coloring is sometimes added for a more intense red coloration. Both lu and hongshao are forms of stewing or braising characterized by usage of soy sauce, Chinese rice wine (Shaoxing wine, huangjiu etc.) and rock sugar. Whole spices (star anise, black cardamom (caoguo), cassia, and/or fennel seeds) or five-spice powder are crucial elements in these dishes but are used in moderation so that their flavors do not overwhelm the main ingredients. Red- cooked stews may be heavy in meat content or contain a variety of meats, vegetables, and hard-boiled eggs.

It is traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  Overview  Foster Denki supplies audio equipment as an OEM: *speakers and headphones for Sennheiser, Sony, Yamaha, Denon, Nokia and Beats *earphones for Apple's iPod and iPhone * television speakers for the Toshiba REGZA television brand *in-vehicle speakers for Clarion, Mitsubishi Motors, Honda, GM, Ford, Mercedes-Benz and others History Foster Denki was founded in 1948 and became one of the largest OEM manufacturer of loudspeakers and transducer products worldwide. Fostex was then established in June 1973 to brand components manufactured by Foster Electric. In 1978, Fostex started to develop speakers for professional use, becoming very well known in both consumer hi-fi and professional fields. Fostex 6301B was the company's most small powered monitor speaker for broadcast and professional use.  1980s: Analog multitrack recorders  From 1981, Fostex and TASCAM pioneered affordable multitrack recording equipment producing the A-2 and the A-4 reel- to-reel recorders; the A-8 was the first eight-track recorder that used affordable ¼ inch tape, becoming a popular choice in the freelance and home recording field. Another popular product was the Fostex 250 four-track cassette multitracker: it used standard cassettes running at double speed (3¾ ips), which improved high frequency response and dynamic range. To obtain four tracks from a standard cassette, all the four tracks available were used in one direction (normally, two tracks are used in each direction). Dolby C noise reduction was used. In 1983, Fostex released the X-15, a portable, battery- powered, cassette-based four track recorder and the B-16, a very compact recorder which fitted 16 tracks onto ½ inch tape running at 15 ips speed. Dolby C was built into the machine as an option to overcome the technical limitations due to the narrow track format. The B-16 was followed by the E-16 in 1986 and the G-16S in 1990, being the first recorder implementing the Dolby S noise reduction system. The G-24S was the last analogue multitrack machine, which fitted 24 tracks onto 1 inch tape and included built-in SMPTE/MIDI synchronization and a removable front panel remote control and meter bridge.  1990s: Digital multitrack recorders  MR8 multitrack hard disk recorder (2003) As digital technology progressed in the audio field, Fostex moved from analogue tape-based recorders to digital, drive-based recorders. The Fostex DMT-8, released in 1995, was the first portable and affordable digital recorder. It provided eight tracks of 16-bit, 44.1kHz audio recorded to hard disk, non-destructive editing capabilities, a built-in metronome and MIDI clock output for synchronization with other machines. The FD-4 and FD-8 were variants which added support for Zip and SyQuest removable drives.  Present  D2424LV 24-track hard disk recorder (2001), DV824 8-track DVD recorder (2004), CR500 CD-R/RW master recorder, RM-2 stereo rack monitor Fostex's current product range includes digital multitrack recording equipment, loudspeaker drivers, studio monitors, microphones, and headphones. Some production sound mixers for motion pictures use the Fostex Field Memory Recorder (FR-series and PD-series), which records audio and stores recordings as WAV files, as their recording device for sync sound. Fostex has expanded its offering of hi-fi based products to include high-end headphones (TH- series), digital audio converters (HP series) and devices for portable listing.

Creator sets have few specialized bricks to create buildings, creatures, vehicles, and robots. Some sets featured instructions for three different possible builds from the bricks included and most sets in recent years have used the 3-in-1 label. Creator is also a parent theme to Lego Creator Expert, a Lego subtheme for adolescents and adults featuring advanced building techniques and large piece counts, mostly known for Modular Buildings and detailed vehicles. Creator also has had several other subthemes such as X-Pods and mosaics. History A Lego Creator 3-in-1 set. The original theme called Creator was launched in 2001 and had over-sized minifigures, such as mascots Tina and Max, targeting a younger demographic but was discontinued after one year. In 2002, the Creator name was used for sets composed of buckets or tubs of generic Lego bricks, which later became \\"Make and Create\\" and then \\"Bricks and More\\". In 2003, a theme called \\"Designer\\" began have subject specific sets with bricks and instructions included to build multiple models based around a concept, such as vehicles or animals. In 2006, Lego then began branding its Designer sets under the \\"Creator\\" theme. In 2004, a subtheme called X-Pods had similar smaller builds included in travel-sized containers and was also then branded under the Creator theme in 2006. The 2006 X-Pods were also the first Creator theme to use the \\"3-in-1\\" labeling on the packaging, which later became a primary feature of Creator sets. In 2007, the Creator line introduced two sets based around creating mosaics under a separate sub-theme. The theme began including Lego minifigures in sets based around buildings in 2011. X-Pods X-Pods were formerly a subtheme of Designer sets from 2004 to 2005 and transitioned to the Creator brand in 2006. X-Pods were small, portable containers that contained small sets of Lego bricks. They came with a strap to join them together for easy mobility and transportation. The X-Pod theme also had smaller polybag versions of select sets without the mobile pod itself and had the first branded Creator 3-in-1 sets in 2006. Creator Expert A Lego model depicting a real-life London Bus. A Lego Creator Expert icon used in recent years of the sub-theme.

Previously, the advanced sets had been themed under Lego Model Team until the labeling was discontinued in 1999. After Model Team, the advanced sets had no labeled theme on the packaging and were typically only sold as exclusives.

History The family history started with Count Adolf I, scion of a cadet branch of the Rhenish Berg dynasty residing at Altena Castle in Westphalia. In the early 13th century Adolf took his residence at his family's estates around Mark, a settlement in present-day Hamm-Uentrop. Adolf had inherited the Mark fortress from his father Count Frederick I of Berg-Altena (d. 1198) together with the older county around Altena and began to call himself count de La Mark. Originally liensmen of the archbishops of Cologne in the Duchy of Westphalia, the family ruled the County of Mark, an immediate state of the Holy Roman Empire, and, at the height of their powers, the four duchies of Julich, Cleves, Berg and Guelders as well as the County of Ravensberg. Members of the family became bishops in the Prince- Bishoprics of Liège, Münster and Osnabrück, and Archbishops in Cologne. Later collateral lines became dukes of Bouillon, a title which was later inherited by the House of La Tour d'Auvergne, princes of Sedan, dukes of Nevers, counts of Rethel and so forth.

It exhibits a specialized form of aplacental viviparity with oophagy: the females produce a single capsule in each uterus that contains 30–80 ova, of which one ovum develops into an embryo that consumes the rest of the ova and stores the yolk material in its external yolk sac. The growing embryo is mainly sustained by this yolk sac during gestation, though it may be additionally supplied with histotroph (\\"uterine milk\\") produced by the mother. The typical litter size is two pups, one per uterus. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the slender smooth-hound as Least Concern; it is taken as fishery bycatch but not in great numbers, and furthermore large portions of its range see minimal fishing activity. Taxonomy and phylogeny The first known specimen of the slender smooth-hound was a long adult male collected by the trawler Maimai in December 1953, at a depth of off Cape Palliser on New Zealand's North Island. It was preserved by the crew as a curiosity and given to ichthyologist Jack Garrick, who described it in a 1954 issue of the scientific journal Transactions of the Royal Society of New Zealand. Garrick named the species Triakis attenuata, in reference to its extremely slender (\\"attenuate\\") body. In 1973, Leonard Compagno proposed a separate genus for the slender smooth- hound: Gollum, after the character in J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, \\"to whom this shark bears some resemblance in form and habits.\\" He placed Gollum with the finback catsharks (Proscylliidae), but also noted its many anatomical similarities to the false catshark (Pseudotriakis microdon). At the time, Compagno chose to maintain Pseudotriakis as the sole member of the family Pseudotriakidae because of its numerous unique traits. More recently, he and other taxonomists have increasingly tended to group Gollum and Pseudotriakis together in the family Pseudotriakidae. This arrangement was corroborated by a 2006 phylogenetic study by Juan Andrés López and colleagues, which found that the two genera have a high degree of genetic similarity across four protein-coding genes and form a natural clade apart from Proscyllium. An additional species of Gollum has now been described, and there is at least one additional species yet to be described. Distribution and habitat The range of the slender smooth-hound is restricted to the upper and middle continental slope around New Zealand, including submarine features to the north such as the Three Kings Ridge, the Challenger Plateau, and the Wanganella Bank. This uncommon species is mainly found between deep, but has been recorded from deep. It prefers a temperature of around and a salinity of approximately 34.8‰. Generally swimming near the sea floor, this shark inhabits both soft and rocky-bottomed habitats in terrain ranging from plateaus to steep slopes. Description Distinctive traits of the slender smooth-hound include its thin body and long, flattened head. The slender smooth-hound has a very thin body and a broad, highly flattened head. The snout is long, with a distinctive bell-shaped outline when viewed from above. The eyes have an elongate horizontal oval shape, and are equipped with rudimentary nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids). Beneath each eye is a prominent ridge, and behind is a much smaller spiracle. The nostrils are preceded by small, almost triangular flaps of skin. The line of the mouth forms an angle; there are very short furrows at the mouth corners. The upper and lower jaws contain 96–99 and 108–114 rows respectively of small, very closely spaced teeth; each tooth has a narrow upright central cusp flanked by smaller cusplets on both sides. The five pairs of gill slits are short. The pectoral fins originate below the fourth gill slit and have gently curved margins. The pelvic fins are small and angular; the males have pointed claspers. The two dorsal fins are similar in size and shape, with narrowly rounded apexes and concave trailing margins. The first dorsal fin originates over rear of the pectoral fins, while the second dorsal fin originates between the pelvic and anal fins. A midline ridge is present between the dorsal fins. The anal fin is less than half as high as the first dorsal fin, and has a nearly straight trailing margin. The short and narrow caudal fin makes up about one-sixth of the total length; the lower caudal fin lobe is indistinct, while the upper lobe has a strong ventral notch near the tip. The skin is densely covered by small, overlapping dermal denticles. The crown of each denticle is mounted on a short stalk and bears three horizontal ridges leading to marginal blade-like teeth, with the central tooth particularly long. This species is plain brownish-gray above and lighter below. It grows up to long and in weight, with females reaching a slightly larger size than males. Biology and ecology Lanternfishes are a major food source for the slender smooth-hound. The slender smooth-hound is likely a schooling species. It preys on a variety of benthic fishes and invertebrates, and also scavenges; human garbage has been reported among its stomach contents. Small bony fishes, lanternfishes in particular, are the most important prey type, followed by decapod crustaceans. Cephalopods, gastropods, isopods, brittle stars, dogfish sharks, and cartilaginous fish egg capsules may also be consumed. On the Challenger Plateau, cephalopods are an important food source for juveniles under long. Like the false catshark, the slender smooth-hound exhibits aplacental viviparity with oophagy, in a form different from that in the mackerel sharks. Mature females have a single functional ovary, on the right side, and two functional uteruses. Only one embryo develops within each uterus at a time, resulting in litters of two (rarely one) pups. The uterus inner surface is covered by villi. Within a uterus, 30–80 ova across are packed into a single rigid, amber-colored capsule; of these, only one ovum is fertilized and develops into an embryo, while the remaining ova begin to break down. The embryo consumes these other ova and transfers the yolk material into its external yolk sac, which serves as its main source of nourishment during gestation; this oophagous process is completed by an embryonic length of . The embryo may also receive secondary nutrition in the form of histotroph (\\"uterine milk\\") produced by the mother. When the embryo is long, it emerges from the capsule, which by that time has become translucent and gelatinous. Embryos long have well-developed external gill filaments. The external yolk sac is entirely absorbed when the embryo is long and close to being born. Males and females reach sexual maturity at approximately long. Human interactions Harmless to humans and of no economic value, the slender smooth-hound is occasionally caught incidentally in bottom trawls and on bottom longlines. Much of its northern range lies in little-fished waters, and thus the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Least Concern. However, this shark's very low fecundity would render it susceptible to population depletion should fishing pressure increase in the future. In June 2018 the New Zealand Department of Conservation classified the slender smooth-hound as \\"Not Threatened\\" with the qualifier \\"Secure Overseas\\" under the New Zealand Threat Classification System.

It is situated in the heart of Norfolk 18 miles from the centre of Norwich and three miles from Dereham, at the geographical centre of Norfolk. It covers an area of and had a population of 2,415 in 783 households at the 2001 census, reducing to a population of 2,100 in 723 households at the 2011 Census. For the purposes of local government it is in the Elmham and Mattishall Division of Norfolk County Council and the Lincoln Ward of Breckland District Council. The village has a long history; it was documented in the 11th-century Domesday Book, and was home to the ancestors of Abraham Lincoln, 16th President of the United States. It has links to the armed forces through the nearby Robertson Barracks. The village has won several awards including the Calor Village of the Year award 2009/10 for the East of England. Geography Swanton Morley is located centrally between the market towns of Dereham, Swaffham and Fakenham, Dereham being the closest at three miles away. The village is adjacent to Bylaugh and Bylaugh Hall and is 18 miles (29 km) from the city and county town of Norwich. History The first part of the village's name \\"Swanton\\" is derived from the Old English for herdsman's enclosure. The second part, \\"Morley\\", refers to Robert de Morli, who held the lordship of the manor in 1346.Stacy (1829), p. 835 The village was the home of Richard Lincoln (1550–1620), a local churchwarden who built the building which is today The Angel public house. Lincoln was the wealthy grandfather of Samuel Lincoln and Richard's coat-of-arms can be seen today in the east window of All Saints Church in Swanton Morley.The spelling of the name varied in Norfolk records. It was often spelled Linkhorn. Richard Lincoln disinherited Samuel's father Edward from his will in favour of his fourth wife, thus throwing the Lincoln family into penury and forcing young Samuel to flee to Hingham, Massachusetts.Lea and Hutchinson (1909) His great-great-great-great-grandson was Abraham Lincoln, 16th President of the United States. Richard Lincoln is buried under the centre aisle of St Andrew's Church in Hingham, Norfolk, a privilege reserved for the gentry.History of Hingham, Norfolk, England and America, Interesting Presentation at Hingham, 11 August 1913, Norfolk Emigrants as Settlement Founders, Interchange of Courtesies, p. 20 Notable buildings and facilities The Angel public house, originally home of Richard Lincoln, grandfather of Samuel Lincoln, American immigrant and ancestor of Abraham Lincoln On the top of a hill to the north of the village lies All Saints Church, a large 14th-century parish church built to an ambitious design in comparison to the size of the village. In particular the aisles of the nave extend to embrace the tower, which is supported on three sides by unusually large arches. All Saints is described by architectural critic Nikolaus Pevsner as \\"big and proud, and historically outstandingly interesting\\".Pevsner and Wilson (2002), p. 686 In addition to worship, the bells are rung by the All Saints Swanton Morley Bell Ringers. Also of historical interest is the Mill Bakery, which has been in business since 1645, and is one of a small number of Norfolk's organic bakeries. The Mill bakery has changed ownership and premises, and is currently owned by Budgens in Drayton, Norfolk and still continues production under the same name. The old premises including the historic mill were subsequently demolished. The village has two public houses, The Angel and Darbys, both of which serve authentic real ale.The Angel pub The Angel pub is a timber framed building which was the ancestral home of the Lincoln family, built in the 17th century by Richard Lincoln and later refaced with brick in the 19th century.Pevsner and Wilson (2002), p. 687 The village hall, a relatively new building, is centrally located and used for community events within the village. It is regularly used by the Swanton Morley Entertainers, the Under 5's Group and the local Women's Institutes group as well as other village groups. Sports clubs include the Swanton Morley Cricket Club and the Swanton Morley Bowls Club. The village also has its own doctor's surgery, a nursing home and Swanton Morley Primary School, a voluntary controlled primary school for children aged 4 to 11. Other facilities include a butcher's, a delicatessen and a convenience store. There are several areas to walk and enjoy the peace and tranquility of the village, including two large areas of common land and several footpaths suitable for walks. There are also areas with opportunities for fishing on the nearby River Wensum. There was formerly a paper mill on the river which was burnt down in the 19th century.Norfolk Mills – Swanton Morley One of the former pubs in the village was called \\"The Papermakers\\". The village is home to Hunter's Hall, a large Victorian converted barn that hosts conferences and celebrations such as wedding receptions, along with bed and breakfast facilities on the Park Farm Estate on which the hall stands.

He played seven seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1978 to 1986 for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Chicago White Sox, and Kansas City Royals. In 1983, he stole 77 bases, setting the White Sox single-season record. Law's play helped the White Sox win their division and get to the 1983 American League Championship Series, the franchise's first postseason appearance since 1959. He was one of the few Sox position players who came through in the ALCS, going 7-for-18 at the plate (.389) and stealing two bases. The team managed to score just three runs in the entire series and lost it to the Baltimore Orioles, three games to one. Biography Law attended Ravenswood High School in East Palo Alto, California. He made his MLB debut at age 21 as a 1978 late-season call-up with the Dodgers, appearing in 11 games in September but not on their roster for the 1978 World Series. His best season for the Dodgers came in 1980, when he appeared in 128 games and stole 40 bases. But with a team bound for the 1981 World Series and a season interrupted by an MLB players' strike, the Dodgers had no available spot for Law in the outfield. He spent all of 1981 in the minors, where he hit .335. Just before the beginning of the following season, the Dodgers traded Law on March 30, 1982 to the White Sox for Cecil Espy and Burwell Geiger.Dodgers, Chisox trade Though Law had a weak throwing arm and had poor instincts in the field and while baserunning, he made up for some of those deficits with his speed. Given a chance to play in Chicago, he hit .318 during the 1982 season with 36 steals. Then came his breakout season in 1983, when as the Sox' leadoff man he had a career-high 142 hits and 77 stolen bases, the second-best total in all of baseball that year and the White Sox single-season record, breaking Luis Aparicio's record of 56. This was on a White Sox team that won the American League West title for the franchise's first postseason berth since the 1959 World Series. In 1985, the White Sox chose not to resign Greg Luzinski and shifted Law to left field to make room for center fielder Daryl Boston in the lineup. Boston was sent to the minors at the end of June, though, and Law shifted back to left field in July. After July 11, he went on the disabled list and was out until the beginning of August; he switched back and forth between center field and left field before going back to left field in September when Boston was called back up. He went four for five with two RBI, runs scored, and stolen bases in a 7-2 victory over the Minnesota Twins on September 10. \\"Rudy was outstanding,\\" manager Tony LaRussa said after the game. \\"He did just about everything you could do as a leadoff man.\\" Law was released by the Sox at the end of spring training in 1986, but he was quickly picked up by the Kansas City Royals. He was released by the Royals at the end of spring training in 1987, ending his MLB career at age 30. Law, who had moved to Inglewood, California, during his stint with the Dodgers, still lived in Inglewood after his retirement.

It is owned by the North Norfolk Historic Buildings Trust. It dates from 1581 and is associated with the Paston family. It is a Scheduled Ancient Monument and a grade II* Listed Building. It is also a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest, a National Nature Reserve and a Special Area of Conservation. It is in the Norfolk Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.  The barn  It is a long, low barn, with a thatched roof, and walls built of brick, flint and limestone. It has large doors with timber lintels. The barn was commissioned by Sir William Paston III as a grain store and threshing barn. It is approximately 70 metres long, 9 metres wide and 16 metres high. It has been granted Grade II* Listed Building status by English Heritage due to its architectural and historical importance. There are three 30-metre long Victorian wings on the eastern side of the barn, added to house cattle. Unusually for a barn it has two date stones, one over an entrance and one in a gable end. Additionally, a plaque over the south door records: \\"THE BILDING OF THIS BEARNE IS Bl SIR W PASTON KNIGHTE\\". The barn and its immediate surroundings, an area of 0.95 hectares was notified as a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest by English Nature in 1999, and from April 2005, the site has also been designated as a Special Area of Conservation. In 2002, English Nature, now Natural England, started a 50-year lease of the barn. There is currently no public access into the barn, partly in order to minimise disturbance to the bats, although some educational interpretation at the site is being considered for the future. Bats The barn is one of only six known maternity roosts in Britain for the barbastelle bat, a species which is rare at a European scale, and it is the only roost which is in a building. The colony was discovered in 1996. The Barbastelles mostly roost in large crevices in timber lintels over the barn doors. Their feeding grounds are believed to include nearby coastal cliffs. Breeding colonies of Natterer's bat (Myotis nattereri), brown long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus) and common pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) also inhabit the barn.

At international level, he was also a member of the Czechoslovakia national team, playing in two World Cups (1958 and 1962). Club career Popluhár started his football career after high school with RH Brno. However, he is best known for the 15 seasons he spent with ŠK Slovan Bratislava where he made 262 competitive appearances in defence, scoring 21 goals, and following further stints with Brno and Zbrojovka Brno finished on 306 Czechoslovak league games and a goalscoring tally of 24. After finishing his career with Slovan in 1968 he moved to French league side Olympique Lyonnais. Two seasons there were enough, but subsequently he spent five years with Austrian amateur club SK Slovan Vienna as player/coach. Many of the thousands of fans in Vienna thought that Popluhár would be shown up by players twenty years younger than he was, but this did not happen. However, at the age of 44 Popluhár realised that his playing career was over. Slovan Bratislava coach Leopold Šťastný was famous for creating nicknames for his players, and so Popluhár became known in Slovak football circles as 'Bimbo'. \\"I was called this because I always looked, and indeed was, good-natured, and I would never hurt anybody\\", recalls Popluhár. International career At the 1962 World Cup in Chile, instead of turning the situation to his team's advantage, Popluhár brought the referee's attention to the injured Pelé. In 1997, he was awarded the World Fair Play award for this sporting act. \\"I met Pelé several times, the first occasion in Chile and then in various international and club games. He was undoubtedly the best, but there were not many one-to-one situations he won and also not many Slovak players who scored in the famous Maracanã stadium. I belong to this lucky group after I scored with a free kick against Brazil in June 1966\\", he remembers. Czechoslovak football was well represented in 1963 at Wembley Stadium in a match to mark the centenary of the English Football Association. Popluhár, along with Svatopluk Pluskal and Josef Masopust, played in a world team that included Alfredo Di Stéfano, Raymond Kopa, Uwe Seeler, Denis Law, Eusébio and Ferenc Puskás against an England eleven. Further appearances in all-star teams followed. Popluhár was elected Footballer of the Year in the former Czechoslovakia for the first time in 1965, despite the great form of his Czechoslovak teammate Josef Masopust. \\"When I was at my peak, the conditions for a football player were modest here in Czechoslovakia, but the spirit and support of the spectators was incredible. I am not sure that today's players, however, would want to return to my era\\", he said. After working for a sports company that went bankrupt and suffering prolonged health problems resulting in a modest invalidity pension and an unsuitable job, he returned to his footballing roots.

Their home strip was white and black with their change strip being red. The club entered the North Caledonian Football League in the 2006–07 season and originally played their games at Ferry Brae Park in North Kessock and won their first trophy when they beat Golspie Sutherland in the Jock Mackay Memorial Cup. They also won the Football Times Cup when again they triumphed over Golspie 3–2. In Season 2007–08 they again reached the Jock Mackay Memorial Cup Final but were beaten this time on penalties by Golspie Sutherland. For Season 2008–09 Inverness City successfully applied to the Scottish Junior Football Association for membership and started life as a Junior team in the North Region Division 2. They finally moved into Inverness where their home games were played at the Northern Meeting Park. They were also eligible to play in the Scottish Junior Cup. The Meeting Park venue was the cause of some controversy due to its use by a cricket side during the summer months. In their inaugural season, Inverness City won the Scotscoup Division 2 Junior League and the Elginshire Cup where they defeated Bishopmill United 3–0 in the final to complete an historic double. For three seasons, City had qualified for promotion to the North Superleague but were denied entry, owing to the club not having access to the Northern Meeting Park for the full duration of the playing season. The club eventually managed to secure a playing facility at the Bught Park in Inverness that was compliant with 'Superleague' criteria - thus enabling the club to obtain promotion. After being relegated from the Superleague at the end of the 2017–18 season, Inverness City announced they were taking a year out of Junior football. They had hoped to move to a new ground on the outskirts of the city, but the facility was unlikely to be ready for the start of the season and the club felt that playing out of another ground outwith Inverness would not be cost- effective and that they would struggle to attract players.

A very international piece of weaponry, it was closely modeled after John Browning's 1903 Pocket Hammerless design produced by Colt, and was produced by over 50 Spanish companies, but primarily by the Spanish Gabilondo y Urresti firm (the official \\"Gabilondo Ruby\\"). It was decommissioned in 1958, more than a decade after World War II was brought to an end, and was subsequently replaced. Gabilondo and the Ruby In 1914, just before the start of the First World War, Gabilondo started manufacture of a sturdy self-loading pistol based on the Browning Model 1903 and chambered for the 7.65mm Browning/.32 ACP cartridge. Unusual for the time, the magazine capacity was nine shots instead of the usual six or seven. The pistol was intended for export to the Americas, and despite the small calibre it was designed with military and police sales in mind. Other Spanish manufacturers had copied the Browning since around 1905. The Ruby, apart from the extended magazine appears to be a direct copy of a pistol called the \\"Victoria\\" made by Esperanza and Unceta. This pistol used features patented by Pedro Careaga in 1911, and by the Esperanza and Unceta company in 1912. These patents may have covered the frame-mounted safety (instead of a grip safety), and an internal striker (instead of a hammer).Gene Gangarosa Jnr., Spanish Handguns: The History of Spanish Pistols and revolvers, Stoeger,2001 In 1915 Gabilondo sent examples of the pistols to the French government, who were hard-pressed for all sorts of small-arms, even in this early stage of the war. After testing was completed in May 1915, the French decided to accept the Ruby as the \\"Pistolet Automatique de 7 millimètre 65 genre \\"Ruby\\" and contracted Gabilondo to produce 10,000 pistols a month. By August the target had been raised to 30,000 and later still an incredible 50,000 a month. Despite its size, the company could barely cope with the initial contract and arranged for four partners to manufacture the Ruby for them: * Armeria Elgoibaressa y Cia * Echealaza y Vincinai y Cia * Hijos de Angel Echeverria y Cia * Iraola Salaverria y Cia The contract stipulated that each company would produce a minimum of 5,000 pistols per month. Gabilondo would produce 10,000 guns, carry out overall quality control and arrange delivery to the French authorities in Bayonne. As the number of pistols required increased the company agreed to purchase any pistols in excess of the agreed number at the same contracted price. As demand increased Gabilondo recruited another three partners to help manufacture the Ruby. Estimates of Gabilondo Ruby production are between 250,000 and 300,000 pistols in total. While most Gabilondo contract pistols were of good quality, others were less well made. Ruby-type pistols by other makers Pistol for sale in the USA, ad from 1923. As the French became more desperate, the procurement process spiralled out of control. Eventually Gabilondo contracted with another three companies and at least 45 other companies contracted with the French directly to produce Ruby-type pistols in a variety of calibres, barrel lengths and magazine capacities. French officials quickly became aware that few of the Spanish Ruby-types had interchangeable magazines, and insisted the manufacturers mark the base of all magazines. This was to prevent the possibly fatal consequence at the front line of either not being able to insert a new magazine, or having a loaded magazine detach from the gun in action. Many Ruby-type pistols were plagued by poor finish and incorrectly hardened steel parts which, after a short period of use, could become so badly worn that a very dangerous situation known as a \\"runaway gun\\" could result. Another danger characteristic to poorly manufactured Ruby pistols were faulty safety mechanisms - due to improper fitting or the use of inappropriate materials for critical safety components. Despite the existence of faulty and/or dangerous Ruby-type pistols produced by the more unscrupulous sub-contractors, the basic Ruby showed itself to be a well thought out design that, when properly manufactured of appropriate quality components, resulted in a pistol highly regarded for its reliability and accuracy, although some users were disconcerted by the lack of a visible hammer. About 710,000 Ruby-types were accepted by the French from all sources and by 1920, about 580,000 were still serviceable and in French army stores. Many other allied nations, and some of the new nations created after the War such as Finland and Yugoslavia also used Ruby-type pistols. Gabilondo ceased production in 1919 and switched to more advanced models, but other firms continued to produce the Ruby-type until the Great Depression wiped out many arms producers. Ruby-types continued to be used until the end of World War II, particularly by Spanish and French Maquis, as well as their Vichy opponents. Advantages and disadvantages The Ruby- type pistol is very intuitive to operate, even for novices. The slide stop doubles as a safety and field stripping is remarkably simple. The small size and large magazine capacity was an advantage, making it a popular \\"backup\\" weapon for troops involved in trench warfare, as well as the standard issue weapons for telephonists, stretcher bearers, machine-gun, machine-rifle, tank, and mortar crews, and rear-echelon personnel of all descriptions. The comparatively weak cartridges these pistols were chambered in gave little recoil, making them easier for novices to use effectively. The primary disadvantage of these pistols (apart from quality control issues) is the relatively weak cartridges they were chambered in, reducing the pistol's stopping power. The reliance on only one type of safety, and the lack of a visible hammer make these pistols very dangerous to carry \\"cocked and locked\\". Early models could come off safety when holstered in a tight-fitting holster and a large protruding stud was added to the slide in order to prevent this. In later years, Ruby-types became notorious for the lack of standardization of parts between different manufacturers, resulting in a widespread incompatibility of spare parts that made the Ruby-types difficult to maintain. Some of this is due to the persistent confusion over exactly who made which Ruby-type pistol. Influence of the Ruby The Ruby directly influenced the design of the FN Model 1910/22, which was a nine-shot version of the M1910 developed for Yugoslavia (who had previously been issued Ruby-type pistols).

It was released in Japan in 1998. It was ported from Dreamcast to Nintendo 64 and released as Densha de Go! 64 in Japan in 1999. Densha de Go! 64 supports its uniquely bundled train driving controller for Nintendo 64, which simulates actual train controls. It is one of two games that utilize Nintendo 64's Voice Recognition Unit (VRS). Like Hey You, Pikachu!, it is packaged with or without a microphone (called the Engineer's Pak), which is used to announce train stations to passengers. It is part of the Taito Densha de Go! series. Gameplay With 13 vehicles, on 16 missions, there are 7 main lines: Hokuhoku Line, Akita Shinkansen Line, Ōu Main Line, Tazawako Line, Keihin-Tōhoku Line, Yamanote Line, and the Tōkaidō Main Line. Unique to the Nintendo 64 version is a Beginner Mode which allows 999 seconds for the player to complete either the Training Course, or Practice Course. The player is given an allotted amount of time to bring their train into the next station as well as a fixed time that the train was expected to arrive. If the player goes around curves too fast, stops suddenly or incurs other such dangers of train operation a few seconds are taken way from the remaining time they have to complete their task. Densha de Go 64 controller by Taito for Nintendo 64 As with most Densha de Go! games, the Nintendo 64 version has a special controller which is plugged into controller outlet 3, while the voice mic is inserted into controller outlet 4, and a standard controller in outlet 1. It consists of a switch on the left that goes up and down, and it controls the train's speed, all five of its drive speeds, and Neutral. The handle on the right controls the breaking speeds 1–8, Emergency brake, and doors opening. Between these two levers is a slot in which that the player can place a pocket watch or stop watch (not included but designed to look more realistic) to keep the time as they drive. There are five buttons, A, B, C, Start, and Select. The select button acts as the Z button to show distance to the next stop, in some game variations. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Densha de Go! 2 Kōsoku-hen on their April 15, 1998 issue as being the third most-successful dedicated arcade game of the year. On release, Famitsu magazine scored the Densha de Go! 64 at 32 out of 40.ニンテンドウ64 – 電車でGO!64. Weekly Famitsu. No.915 Pt.2. Pg.28. June 30, 2006.

Domestic matches began in 2007 with two teams, the Helsinki Heatseekers and Salo Juggernauts. A third team, the Espoo Roos was created in 2008 but only lasted one season due to lack of numbers and the remaining players joined the Helsinki team, but there are plans to revive Espoo in the future. A third stand alone club, the Turku Dockers, was formed in late 2008 by Australian Ex-pats Craig Primmer and Grant Siermans. During the 2010 season, Helsinki players Mika Kupila and Kaj Karlsson who study in Vaasa decided to create a team in the city, the Vaasa Wombats, and they are hoping to join the league in 2011. The FAFL plays the European style Australian football which is played on soccer or American football fields and consists of 15 players on each team, with nine on the field and six on the interchange. The FAFL plays 15-minute quarters and also has a 40-metre scoring zone where all scores must be made from. The first full domestic season was played with three stand-alone teams in 2009. The Turku Dockers defeated Helsinki for the inaugural Finnish premiership.Turku Dockers take out inaugural Finnish premiership 2010 saw the Turku Dockers go back to back, but this time defeating the Salo Juggernauts. The Dockers completed the 'perfect season' by not losing a game for the entire year, with an average winning margin of 73 points. After the 2010 home and away season the first ever FAFL cup was held in Tali, Helsinki. Four teams competed on the day in a round robin style tournament that consisted of 12-minute halves. The Vaasa Wombats made their Australian Football debut against the Helsinki Heatseekers, losing by just 11 points. The Wombats scored their first win against the Salo Juggernauts in their second game of the day. The Turku Dockers won the tournament after defeating Helsinki in the final by 10 points. The Dockers were undefeated for the day, with close wins over Salo (6 points) and Helsinki (3 points) but more comfortably over Vaasa (27 points).

They have twice won the Central European AFL Championships, going back-to-back in 2006 and 2007. While the team was started by Australian expatriates, it has been captained by a Finn ever since the 2nd match. Captains have included Kimmo Heikkilä, Jani Saarinen, Fredrik Romar and Ville Koivunen. The Icebreakers are now almost exclusively Finns. The old Finnish jumper was primarily blue, with a white rectangle in the centre with the blue cross of the Finnish flag through it, and the coat of arms immediately below it. The current national jumper still has the flag as the predominant feature, but instead of the coat of arms, includes a stylized iceberg graphic. The Lions' first home game on 13 May 2006 was claimed as the northernmost international game of Australian rules ever played, being hosted in Helsinki, the northernmost capital of Europe, although this was later overtaken by the club in Falun, Sweden. 2007 Finland participated in the 2007 EU cup in Hamburg, Germany finishing six after a disappointing 2-point loss to Spain which would have seen them advance and be certain of a top four finish. Two Finnish players were voted into the All- European team, Grant Siermans who played with the Finland Icebreakers and Jari Pystynen who played with the EU Crusaders. Siermans was also the leading goal kicker for Finland booting 13 goals, which was the second most by any player during the day. In the strongest man competition, Izzy Barker won, completing the greatest number of push ups. AFL Brownlow medallist Jimmy Bartel visited Finland in October 2007, playing for the Salo Juggernauts following his AFL premiership season. In the game, he took a spectacular mark over an opposition ruckman and a difficult goal from the pocket. He was presented with the no.8 guernsey for the Finland national team.Bartel kicking goals in Finland from afl.com.au 2008 Finland made its Australian Football International Cup debut at the 2008 tournament. The Finns finished 14th out of the 16 competing nations, losing their first four matches, but then defeating fellow debutants India in their final game of the tournament. Finland then sent a team to the 2008 EU Cup in Prague, even after having just sent a national team to the AFL International Cup in Australia. The team consisted of six Australians, one New Zealander, three Irish and only five Finns due to the financial burden the IC tournament put on many national players. Even so, the Finland Icebreakers under new coaches James Meek and Simon McGregor and captain Jani Saarinen performed well throughout the day and finished a place higher than the previous year defeating France in the final game of the day to finish fifth. Once again, Grant Siermans was voted into the All-European team after finishing second in the tournament vote count, and also took out the tournaments leading goal kicker with fifteen goals for the day. Mika Kupila performed well in the fast man competition finishing second. 2009 In 2009 Finland sent a team to the EU Cup in Croatia made up entirely of players who had learned the game in Finland. The squad consisted of 13 Finns, an Irishman and a Colombian. The team was coached by Grant Siermans and captained by Fredi Romar. The Icebreakers had two wins for the day, marginally beating Andorra and having a comfortable win over the Czech Republic. Finland performed well against eventual winners England, and were leading by 9 points at half time, the only team to be leading England at half time for the entire day. However, they lost to England and then were convincingly beaten by the Irish Exiles, leaving them in 8th position. Leading goal kicker for Finland was Juuso Timosaari who kicked 4 goals for the day and also registered some sort of scoring shot in all of the four games Finland played. Mika Kupila was rewarded for his consistent performances all day by being selected into the All-European team. Janne Hokkanen performed well in the strongest man competition finishing 3rd, whilst Siermans won the longest kick.

With his country leading 1–0, he expected a cross from Amarildo and left the goal, allowing the Brazilian to score from an acute angle. Halfway through the second half, with his side already 1–2 down, the sun got into his eyes and he failed to catch a simple ball properly, which landed directly at the feet of Vava, who took the opportunity to become the first ever player to score in two different World Cup finals.

During the course of the festival, the Young Artists participate in individual rehearsal, private lessons, chamber group rehearsal, chamber music coaching, performance opportunities, masterclasses, and body mapping sessions by a licensed Andover Educator. The festival has mentored more than 350 young musicians and composers through its 20-year history. Young artist alumni have won East Coast Music Awards and Juno Awards, and have performed with the Fitzwilliam String Quartet, Sybarite5, Vancouver and Calgary symphony orchestras, the Dardanelles and Hey Rosetta.  Young Composer Program  The Young Composer Program is composed of up to three emerging composers. Unlike the Young Artist Program, this program is one week in duration. During the week, the students' compositions are work shopped, rehearsed, and performed by the Young Artists and faculty. They also participate in masterclasses and score study.  Faculty  In 2020, resident faculty includes: * Nancy Dahn, Artistic Director, Violinist * Timothy Steeves, Artistic Director, Pianist * Vernon Regehr, Faculty, Cellist * Andrew Staniland, Faculty, Composer  Guest Artists  The festival has presented over 150 guest artist performers throughout its 20-year history.

It is designed to produce a distorted sound referred to as \\"fuzz,\\" originally achieved through accident such as broken electrical components or damaged speakers. History Arbiter Electronics Ltd. first issued the Fuzz Face in 1966. Later units bear the \\"Dallas Arbiter\\", \\"Dallas Music Industries Ltd.\\", \\"CBS/Arbiter Ltd.\\" or \\"Dunlop Manufacturing Inc.\\" name. The earliest units used germanium transistors. Silicon transistors were used in later editions of the pedal. Silicon transistors provided for a more stable operation, but have a different, harsher sound. The electronics are contained in a circular-shaped metal housing. Ivor Arbiter \\"got the idea for the round shape when he one day saw a microphone stand with a cast iron base\\". \\"Fuzz Face\\" by David Morin The design was originally intended to be used as a microphone base for guitarists who sang. The pedal uses two knobs, one for volume, and one for the amount of distortion the pedal produces. The arrangement of controls and logo on the box suggests a face. The circuit is based on the shunt-series-feedback amplifier topology - a standard in engineering textbooks. Sola Sound and Vox had been using the same circuit topology for their Tone Bender pedals earlier in 1966.\\"Pedal Porn - A Little History\\" by David Main The Fuzz Face is particularly similar to the Sola Sound unit known today as the \\"Mk1.5\\" Tone Bender. The main difference is that the Fuzz Face is biased slightly colder, making it more usable in warm environments. The original instructions even described the Fuzz Face as a \\"Tone-Bending\\" unit. Dallas Music Industries made a final batch of Fuzz Face units in 1976 or 1977, shortly after moving to the United States. The company bought Crest Audio in the 1980s and although it was operating under that name when it reissued the Fuzz Face in 1986, the units still bore the Dallas-Arbiter name. They made about 2000 Fuzz Faces until 1990. 1980's Crest Audio FuzzFace reissue story Foxrox electronics scrapbook In 1993 Dunlop Manufacturing took over production, making a variety of Fuzz Face units until this day. Several germanium and silicon models are available. In 2013 smaller versions with status LEDs and AC power jacks were introduced.Music Radar - Namm 2013: Dunlop launches Fuzz Face Mini and MXR Talk Box In the late 1990s Arbiter reissued the pedal as well. Vintage Guitar: Arbiter Fuzz Face reissue Components Inside view of a Fuzz Face pedal showing its comparatively simple two-transistor circuit board, in this model a pair of germanium NKT275 The circuit uses only a small number of components, plus a battery. Its sound is mostly dependent on the selection of transistors (type, hfe and leakage in case of germanium transistors). As germanium transistors are sensitive to temperature, the amount of leakage is variable. Thus the bias voltages will shift up and down, so the sound produced by a germanium Fuzz Face may change as the equipment heats up or cools down. Also, the battery is part of the circuit. Variances in voltage and internal resistance can make an audible difference. According to Jimi Hendrix’s guitar tech:Roger Mayer, Jimi would buy half a dozen Fuzz Faces and mark the one he liked best only to find out that he didn't like it in a different environment. Premier Guitar: Roger Mayer Talks Fuzz Despite popular belief that Arbiter used randomly selected pairs of transistors, Dennis Cornell, one of the engineers who worked for Arbiter in the 1960s, Vintage Guitar: Arbiter Fuzz Face Reissue described in a 2016 Guitarist magazine article how he auditioned them for their sonic properties. Early units used NKT275 germanium transistors. Later on, BC183L, BC183KA, BC130C, BC108C, BC209C and BC239C silicon transistors were used. The American made versions used BC109C transistors.Analog Man Sun Face and Fuzz Face Page Arbiter reissues used AC128s. Hendrix also switched to the silicon transistors, but they created additional difficulties on stage, since they are much more susceptible to receiving AM radio signals, which were then audible through the guitar amplifier. Use The Fuzz Face's continuing popularity and status as a classic may be explained by its many famous users, which include Jimi Hendrix, Dunlop - Jimi Hendrix Fuzzface David Gilmour, Gilmourish - Dallas Arbiter Fuzz Face Duane Allman, Stevie Ray VaughanHopkins, Craig.

By rolling the volume knob, the guitar player can decrease the gain of the pedal and get a clean or crunch sound, while still having all the gain when the volume knob is on maximum. For the same reason, Fuzz Face pedals react differently when placed directly after the guitar than when after other pedals or after a buffer amplifier. While some claim Wah-wah pedals are known to be troublesome with Fuzz Faces, artists such as Hendrix were known to use them together to spectacular effect. His signal flow for live performance involved first plugging his guitar into a wah-wah pedal, then connecting the wah-wah pedal to a Fuzz Face, which was then linked to a Uni-Vibe, before connecting to a Marshall amplifier. p. 689.

Course  The race begins downtown, at Fourth and Adams, in front of the First National Bank Alaska, and ends a block south of where it began, at Fourth and Washington. The juniors' race starts at 9am, while the start times for the men's and women's races alternate each year. The halfway point is a stone marker on Mount Marathon, above sea level, and a mile and a half from the finish line. The total race course distance is about 3.1 miles (5 kilometers). Leading racers will typically reach the highest point from the starting line in 33-40 minutes, and reach the finish line from the turn in 10-15 minutes. Average speed uphill is 2 mph. Average speed downhill is 12 mph. It is not uncommon for the racers who finish to cross the finish line injured or bleeding and covered in mud.  Entries  In order to limit the environmental impact of the race, the entrants were limited to 350 men, 350 women, and 200 juniors until 2012, when the field was expanded to permit 400 entrants for the men's and women's races. In 2013, however, the number of entries was again lowered to 350 each for the men's and women's races. In 2017, the number of entries in the juniors race was increased to 300, with 150 slots available for boys and 150 for girls. The slots are filled in the following order: *Veteran racers who have completed the prerequisite number of races *Prior year registered runners who have not completed the prerequisite number of races but have a waiver *Current year special invitation The remaining slots are filled by a weighted lottery. Instituted after the 2013 race, this systems gives racers who have applied before additional entries in the lottery and improving their chances of being selected. In 2019, the race offered a waitlist for the first time. Previous winners of any prior year are allowed to enter until the morning of the race. Lottery application fees for the 2019 race were $20 for adults and $15 for juniors; successful applicants pay an additional registration fee of $85 for adults and $25 for juniors. History The Mount Marathon Race is one of a number of races believed to be among the oldest foot races in America. Various claims say it was first run in 1908, 1909, or 1912—but there is no evidence to support any date before the first organized run in 1915. The challenge was to run from downtown, to the top of the mountain and back, in under an hour. Legend says that it all started out as a bar bet between two \\"sourdoughs\\" (slang for gold miners), with one betting a man could race to the top of the mountain and back in less than an hour, and the other saying that wasn't possible. The winning racer finished in one hour and twenty minutes. Since Seward is a port town, every arriving ship had its challenger who wanted to beat the one hour bet. This may have been how the race evolved. For the first official race, in 1915, local merchants donated prizes and suggested the race take place on the 4th of July. There was no official route—racers were free to choose their own trails to the summit and back. The winning runner, James Walters, finished in one hour, two minutes. The event was honored in February 2011 with an official induction into the Alaska Sports Hall of Fame. During the 2012 race, an Anchorage man, Michael LeMaitre, disappeared after last being seen by race officials approaching the summit. He was officially declared dead in August 2012, and his family reached a settlement with the Seward Chamber of Commerce in 2014. It was the first presumed fatality in the history of the race, which normally produces numerous injuries. In response to LeMaitre's disappearance and unusually severe injuries suffered by two other racers in 2012, several safety improvements were made prior to the 2013 race. In 2019. the juniors race was cancelled due to air quality concerns related to the Swan Lake Fire, which started in the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge on June 5; all racers were given the option to defer entry to 2020. The 2020 edition of the race was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic, with all entries being transferred to 2021. It also was cancelled in 1917–18 & 1942–45.

Shipwreck On the evening of 27 January 1974, a severe storm caused the vessel to drag her anchor while she was waiting at the Tail of the Bank to deliver sugar to the James Watt Dock in Greenock. Her captain ordered the engines to be started with the intention of running for the more sheltered waters of the Gareloch but before she could be brought to power she drifted onto the taut anchor chains of the BP tanker British Light. The tanker suffered no damage but her anchor chains holed the sugar boat below the waterline, allowing water to pour in. Captayannis's Captain Theodorakis Ionnis, realizing that water was flowing in so fast that she was in imminent danger of sinking, opted to beach her in the shallow waters over the sandbank and steered to the desired spot where she stuck fast. The pilot boats, the tug Labrador and Clyde Marine Motoring's 20 metre passenger vessel Rover came to assist. The vessel heeled over so far that it was possible for the crew to jump onto the deck of the Rover. 25 of the crew were taken ashore aboard the Rover, but the Captain and four crewmen waited on the Labrador, standing off the stricken vessel. The ship finally succumbed the next morning, rolling onto her side. She has lain there ever since. Most, if not all of her more valuable metals and fittings have been removed by looters, leaving just her steel hull and superstructure, though some of her wooden decking remains in remarkably good condition after more than 40 years in the sea. Her hull remains sound, though her thinner deck plates are starting to rust through with holes opening up in places. Today Through time Captayannis has become 'home' to marine life and birds. She has never been removed as confusion surrounds the identity of her owners and insurers - no one accepts responsibility for her removal. She is known to many locals simply as the \\"sugar boat\\". The wreck is a familiar sight near the Tail of the Bank and can be seen on satellite images. The wreck is not to be confused with that of the French warship Maillé Brézé which sank nearby in 1940, but was later removed and cut up in Port Glasgow in 1956.

She documented the history of antisemitism and support of fascism among Quebec nationalists and intellectuals during the 1930s and '40s. The book was first published in French by L'Étincelle as Le traître et le Juif: Lionel Groulx, le Devoir et le délire du nationalisme d'extrême droite dans la province de Québec, 1929–1939. In 1993, it was published in English by Robert Davies Publishing of Montreal. Delisle is a political scientist based in Quebec. She alleged that Lionel Groulx, a leading figure of Canadian intellectuals and a father of Quebec nationalism, had published anti-Semitic articles under his pseudonyms. Her criticism of Groulx caused her book generated considerable debate. In addition to arguing with Delisle's conclusions about Groulx, some critics said that her methodology was inaccurate and that her conclusions could not be supported. Other historians supported her work as part of a revision of thought on Quebec nationalism and Canadian thought before World War II. She was quoted favourably by the author Mordecai Richler in his collection of essays, Oh Canada! Oh Quebec! (1992), which generated its own controversy. Je me souviens is a documentary based on her book made by Eric R. Scott. It was shown on Canal D in 2002 and premiered in the United States in 2003 at the New York Jewish Film Festival. Summary Delisle assessed the content of articles published in the nationalist review L'Action nationale and the Montreal newspaper Le Devoir during to evaluate the attitudes among French Canadians and to show the connection between nationalistic and fascist thought. She also linked Canadian attitudes to contemporary ones of the Roman Catholic Church in Quebec and to Catholics in Europe and the United States. Specifically, she alleged Lionel Groulx (1878–1967), a Roman Catholic priest and leading Quebec intellectual, to have been anti-Semitic and noted hundreds of anti-Semitic quotations that were by or attributed to him. She alleged that Groulx had published anti-Semitic articles under pseudonyms and had been an active fascist sympathizer, the assertion that generated great controversy, as well as her reporting of numerous anti-Semitic opinion pieces and articles that had been published in the respected intellectual Quebec newspaper Le Devoir in the 1930s. Delisle did not believe that residents of Quebec were uniformly anti-Semitic. She felt that it was more characteristic of Quebec intellectuals of the time rather than that of the common people and that it was part of their condemnation of liberalism, modernity and urbanism, not to mention movies, jazz music and other aspects of American culture, all of which they saw as dangers to their conception of the ideal Quebec society. She notes that the mass-circulation newspaper La Presse, as one example, did not publish as much anti-Semitic content as the intellectually-influential but less read Le Devoir. She argued against what she calls the myth, as recounted by historians such as Groulx, that the Québécois are a racially and ethnically homogeneous group of pure descent (pure laine in French, meaning \\"pure wool\\") from French-speaking Catholic immigrants to New France. She said that the Quebec intellectuals in the 1930s and 1940s were less isolated from and more deeply influenced by intellectual currents in Europe, particularly the nationalism of the extreme right than is described in most Quebec histories of the period. Reception Delisle's book about Groulx and other Quebec nationalists was based on her doctoral dissertation. Her conclusions had generated such strong disagreement among her thesis committee at the Université Laval that it did not approve it for two years. The average period for approval of a thesis at the university was three to six months. Delisle's analysis of Groulx and Le Devoir was covered sympathetically in a 1991 article about the young scholar in L'Actualité, the Quebec news magazine.Luc Chartrand, \\"Le chanoine au pilori\\", L'Actualité, June 15, 1991, p. 114 On March 1, 1997, L'Actualité revisited the controversy about Delisle's doctoral thesis and book in a cover story, Le mythe du Québec fasciste (\\"The Myth of a Fascist Quebec\\"). In the same issue, it featured a profile of Groulx. Both articles acknowledged Groulx's anti-Semitism and the generally-favourable attitude of the Roman Catholic Church to fascism in the 1930s. Pierre Lemieux, an economist and author, wrote: \\"The magazine's attack is much weakened by Claude Ryan, editor of Le Devoir in the 1970s, declaring that he has changed his mind and come close to Delisle's interpretation after reading her book.\\" L'Actualité claimed but did not document that Delisle's work had been subsidized by Jewish organizations. Claude Charron, a former Parti Québécois cabinet minister, repeated that assertion when he was introducing a 2002 broadcast on Canal D of Je me souviens, the Eric R. Scott documentary about Delisle's book. Scott and Delisle said that was an absolute falsehood and asked Canal D to rebroadcast the documentary, as they considered Charron's introduction to be defamatory and inaccurate. Groulx is revered by French- Quebeckers as a father of Quebec nationalism although his work is little read today. As a sign of his stature, a station on the Montreal Metro as well as schools, streets, lakes, and a chain of mountains in Quebec are all named after him. To separate his political and literary activities from his academic work, Groulx wrote journalism and novels under numerous pseudonyms. In her history, Delisle claimed that Groulx, under the pseudonym Jacques Brassier, wrote in a 1933 article published in L'Action nationale: \\"Within six months or a year, the Jewish problem could be resolved, not only in Montreal but from one end of the province of Quebec to the other. There would be no more Jews here other than those who could survive by living off one another.\\" Referring to Groulx and the Le Devoir newspaper, Francine Dubé wrote in the National Post on April 24, 2002 that \\"the evidence Delisle has unearthed seems to leave no doubt that both were anti-Semitic and racist.\\"Francine Dubé. \\"Exposing Quebec's Secret,\\" The National Post, April 27, 2002 The Montreal Gazette referred that year to \\"anti-Semitism and pro-fascist sympathies that were common among this province's (Quebec) French-speaking elite in the 1930s.\\" A variety of commentators have agreed with Delisle's conclusions: *In a 1994 issue of The Canadian Historical Review, Irving Abella wrote: > \\"Clearly Delisle's message is discomfiting to many French-Canadian > nationalists and it should be. She portrays a nationalism which was racist, > paranoid, xenophobic, and anti-Semitic.

Canadian Historical Review – Volume 75, > Number 4, December 1994. *Claude Bélanger, Department of History at Marianopolis College, said: \\"Anti-semitism was alive and well among the ultramontane nationalists of the period of 1890 to 1945\\" and \\"These anti-semitic views were propounded broadly and openly from about 1890 to 1945.\\" Bélanger noted that Pierre Anctil documented anti-Semitism in Quebec in his 1988 book Le Devoir, les Juifs et l'immigration. *Gary Evans, an historian, author, and professor at the University of Ottawa said: > \\"Academic Esther Delisle angrily attacks the Establishment for its position > of \\"Everyone knows, but no one should say\\" with regard to her own attempts > to reveal Quebec's shameful intellectual past, including a postwar policy of > welcoming Nazi collaborators from France and of trivializing the > Holocaust.\\"Holocaust Education – Bibliography, Sympatico Delisle-Richler controversy The Delisle-Richler controversy is the title of a separate Wikipedia article that explores in more detail the issues related to Esther Delisle's and Mordecai Richler's discussions about antisemitism among Quebec intellectuals of the pre-World War II years, including Groulx. Sarah Scott has noted that, after Delisle's work was quoted with approval in Mordecai Richler's book Oh Canada! Oh Quebec!, which generated its own controversy, Delisle was subject to considerable criticism. Delisle has said that the reaction among the French Canadian public to Richler's praise was as if she had been \\"embraced by the Devil.\\"Sarah Scott, \\"The Lonely Passion of Esther Delisle\\", Elm Street, April 1998, p. 98.

He is a sociologist and demographer who is a member of the governing national council of the Parti Québécois. * Delisle did not prove her assertion that articles published under the pseudonym of Lambert Closse were written by Groulx. * She ignored articles with more moderate opinions. * Many of her cited articles could not be found as referenced. * Her excerpts from selected articles often misrepresent the ideas in them. * She failed to distinguish Catholic anti- Semitism from fascist sympathies. * She did not adequately address the contradictions in Groulx's attitudes towards Jews (although he expressed anti- Semitic opinions in his private correspondence and pseudonymous journalism, opposed Jewish immigration to Canada, and urged French Canadians not to buy from Jewish-owned stores as part of the \\"achat chez nous\\" [buy from us] campaign, his opinions were more muted in his academic writings and publicly denounced anti-Semitism as un-Christian and invited French Canadians to take Jews as a model of ethnic solidarity). * She ignores the possibility of interethnic rivalry between two minority groups (French Canadians and Jews) as did for example Morton Weinfeld in The Jews of Canada. * she does not compare the texts drawn from Le Devoir or l'Action nationale to texts from French- Canadian publications that are generally considered to have been fascist, such as the newspapers edited by Adrien Arcand. * She presented an admittedly- exploratory study as a test of several linked hypotheses (for example, by drawing inferences from isolated texts, rather than by estimating the frequency of anti-Semitic themes in Le Devoir and l'Action nationale and comparing it to a control frequency, such as the frequency of anti-Semitic references in English Canadian or foreign publications of the same period).Gary Caldwell. \\"The Sins of the Abbé Groulx,\\" The Literary Review of Canada, volume 3, issue 7, July–August 1994: 17–23. In summary, Caldwell characterized Laval University as \\"disloyal\\" to the French-Canadian community for having granted Delisle a doctorate.Sarah Scott, \\"The Lonely Passion of Esther Delisle\\", Elm Street, April 1998. In response, Delisle said: *The Lambert Closse articles are not central to her thesis; they were not mentioned in her doctoral thesis on which her book is based; she acknowledges that she cannot prove that the Closse article was written by Groulx, but says that Groulx's involvement in the publication of the book in which the article appeared is of concern.); *Delisle did not believe that the bulk of the French and Jewish populations were antagonistic to each other; she considered stronger antisemitism to have been more prevalent among the French Canadian intellectual elite); *She has corrected some of the citations noted as inaccurate; *She drew parallels between Canadian thought and the connections between the Catholic Church's anti-Semiticism with fascism in Italy and Portugal, in Vichy France, and in the writings and radio broadcasts of Father Coughlin in the United States (see clerical fascism); The historian Gérard Bouchard also criticized Delisle for her methodology in his book on Groulx, Les Deux Chanoines – Contradiction et ambivalence dans la pensée de Lionel Groulx published in 2003. Bouchard wrote in his book that he chose not to use Delisle's history as a source because, according to his own process of verification, it contains too many errors in the citations of references. He said that of Delisle's 57 references to texts by Groulx published in L'Action nationale between 1933 and 1939, he was unable to find 23 and that 5 others were not accurately cited.Gérard Bouchard, Les Deux Chanoines – Contradiction et ambivalence dans la pensée de Lionel Groulx, 2003, p. 19 Esther Delisle contested his conclusions in a letter published in Le Devoir on April 11, 2003.Esther Delisle, \\"M. Bouchard échoue son exercice de validation.\\" Le Devoir, April 11, 2003. She had her lawyer submit a formal notice to have Bouchard withdraw the assertions he made on page 19 of his book. The letter from her lawyer to Bouchard provided her clarifications on the sources she used in her work and recognized 13 irregularities in her references. Bouchard wrote a letter to Le Devoir, published on May 1, 2003, relating the results of his second review of Delisle's methodology. He said the following: * Of the total of 58 references to texts by Groulx in L'Action nationale published between 1933 and 1939, only 14 were accurately cited in terms of the year, the month, and the page number, with the excerpt being; * In the 44 inexact references, \\"23 contain 31 modifications of Groulx's text\\". The modifications take the form of \\"amputations and other types of alterations\\". * He could not find 21 references (instead of 23); he found two based on information provided by Delisle.*Gérard Bouchard. \\"Réplique à Esther Delisle – À propos des deux chanoines\\", Le Devoir, 1 May 2003 Bouchard and Caldwell both acknowledge that Groulx at times expressed antisemitic opinions. They argue that such opinions do not discredit his scholarship or secular Quebec nationalism, either because the antisemitism arises from Groulx' Catholic beliefs or because it is a personal bias unrelated or peripheral to his academic work. Delisle, by contrast, argues that antisemitism is an integral component of Groulx' race- based nationalism and his enthusiasm for right-wing authoritarian governments.

He made his first screen appearance on 26 March 1996 and departed on 20 January 1999. The character's story arc began with Steve developing a romantic interest with local businesswoman Kim Tate (Claire King), up to the point where they ended up getting married in 7 May 1998 — nearly a year after Steve went into companionship with Kim's estranged husband Frank (Norman Bowler) until the latter's subsequent death. During his time on the show, Steve established a feud with Kim's stepson Chris (Peter Amory); befriended his sister Zoe (Leah Bracknell); formed a brief relationship with Chris' ex-wife Rachel Hughes (Glenda McKay); and contributed to Kim's business partnership with fellow entrepreneur Lord Alex Oakwell (Rupam Maxwell). The events of Steve's departure from the programme featured the character running over Rachel's best-friend, Kathy Bates (Malandra Burrows), whilst stealing a horse in a desperate bid to help Kim solve their financial troubles; in the end, Kim framed Steve for their crimes and he was consequently sentenced to 10 years in prison. Casting Opacic originally auditioned for the role chef Sean Rossi. An Inside Soap writer said he proved perfect for the role of \\"shady dealer\\" Steve instead. Opacic was initially signed for six episodes and his casting was announced in February 1996. The Daily Mirror's Sarah Hey said \\"He turns up as entrepreneur Steve, who's a blast from Rachel's past. The pair went to university together and it isn't long before Chris feels jealous.\\" In September 1998, Matthew Wright of the Daily Mirror reported Opacic and two other cast members had been axed by new series producer Kieran Roberts. Of his departure, Opacic said \\"I will miss being on Emmerdale, but it's time to move on and do other things. The door has been left open for me to return once Steve gets out, though. It would be great to be a recurring character.\\" Storylines Steve Marchant first arrived in Emmerdale in March 1996. It soon transpired that he was an old university friend of local resident Rachel Hughes (Glenda McKay). Their bond sparked jealously from Rachel's estranged husband, Chris Tate (Peter Amory), and they soon dated after Rachel's marriage to Chris ended. Soon afterwards, Steve formed a companionship with Chris' sister Zoe (Leah Bracknell) and later started working on a business association with their father Frank (Norman Bowler); however, his attempts to establish the Tate assets grew obstructed over Rachel and her son Joseph — up to the point where Steve ends his relationship with Rachel and briefly dates her neighbour Charlie Cairns (Sarah Graham). Frank is soon killed when his estranged former wife Kim (Claire King) reappears — after it was alleged that she has died and Frank was implicated behind her \\"death\\" — and causes him to die of a fatal heart attack without proving help for her husband. In light of Frank's funeral, Kim gains solace in Steve and they proceed to form a romantic bond within each other. The pair soon become engaged, but Steve becomes reluctance when Kim proceeds to establish a business partnership with Lord Alex Oakwell (Rupam Maxwell). On the night of Kim and Steve's engagement party, Alex Oakwell ends up causing the death Zoe's best-friend Linda Fowler (Tonicha Jeronimo). The follow-up to Linda's murder sparks a feud with her husband Biff Fowler (Stuart Wade) and father Ned Glover (Johnny Leeze), as well as Alex Oakwell's trophy-wife Tara Cockburn (Anna Brecon). Despite this, Steve continues to support Kim and later comforts his fiance when she is mysteriously blackmailed and later on her son James gets kidnapped on Christmas Day 1997; he manages to sort out her troubles by confronting her blackmailer and James is soon rescued when police arrest his kidnapper, who turns out to be Linda's grieving mother Jan (Roberta Kerr). Eventually, Steve and Kim get married in 7 May 1998. Shortly afterwards, however, the pair are shocked to learn that their respective partner is on the verge of financial bankruptcy — which consequently puts their businesses and ownership of Frank's old property, Home Farm Estates, in jeopardy. Desperate to solve their financial troubles, Steve plans to steal a horse from one of Kim's business rivals. He is initially successful until Steve ends up driving towards Rachel's best-friend, Kathy Bates (Malandra Burrows); she ends up getting run over and Steve leaves her to die rather than help her. When Kathy is later hospitalized, Steve attempts to kill her by smothering the latter with a pillow; however, Kim — after learning about what Steve did to Kathy — rushes to the hospital and stops him at the last second. Kim later urges her husband to abscond the country until the investigation into both the horse theft and its contribution to Kathy's hit and run incident blows over. Steve agrees and rushes to the airport, but ends up getting arrested just before he could enter the plane. Steve is then gets taken to the police station, where he gets charged for theft and attempted murder. When it appears that Kim will bail Steve out of the police station, she instead fabricates a story where she has ended their marriage in light of attempting to kill Kathy and later grew wary of his behaviour in reaction to their impending \\"divorce\\". Upon learning of his wife's statement, Steve realizes that Kim is planning to frame him for their conspiracy plan and vows to bring her down. While Kim is able to gain support from both Kathy and Zoe over the incident, Chris agrees to help Steve bring down Kim — albeit merely due to the fact that Chris and Kim are archenemies ever since he resented her for allegedly killing his father, and cheating on Frank with both his old friend The Rt Hon. Neil Kincaid (Brian Deacon) and then Kathy's former lover Dave (Ian Kelsey). Before the trial, Steve pleads guilty to his involvement behind the horse theft and obtaining money by deception — to which Kim pleads not guilty from both offenses — whilst also pleading not guilty for attempted murder regarding Kathy's hit and run incident. The trail starts badly for Steve after Kim manages to gain support over her theory of the story and Chris' efforts to expose her role in Frank's death are dismissed, but then Kathy gradually deduces Kim's involvement behind Steve's crime and ends up changing her statement. Following Kathy's testimony, Steve believes that Kim will be the one going to prison while he ends up getting acquitted for their illegitimate activities. On the night before the verdict, however, Kim ends up fleeing the village with James after confronting Chris for withholding the £190,000 that she buried at Frank's grave; she steals back the money after knocking Chris out with a paperweight and then escaping the village with James in a getaway helicopter. A couple of hours later, Steve learns about Kim's escape and the verdict ends up being announced without her presence. Although Kim is found guilty of theft and obtaining money by deception, Steve is found guilty of attempted murder. While he later receives 12 months to each charge of theft and obtaining money by deception, with the judge granting Steve's good judgement for his guilty plea and corporation with the police behind Kim's crimes, Steve ends up being sentenced to 10 years for attempted murder as penance for Kathy's hit and run incident. Outraged and ranting that justice isn't served because Kim got away with their crimes scot-free while he himself is going to prison for them, Steve attempts to escape — only to be tackled by police guards and dragged away from the courtroom; Steve is later sent to prison for 10 years and is released off-screen in 2011. Reception Steve was named as one of \\"The 30 greatest Emmerdale residents\\" by a writer for Inside Soap. They said \\"The Emmerdale girls thought this Mulder from The X-Files lookalike was out of this world when he arrived - well, Rachel Hughes did at least! His downfall was getting involved with Kim Tate, who left him facing jail while she jetted off with a fortune.\\" Diana Hollingsworth of Soaplife included Steve in her feature on wide boys and she said \\"City slicker Steve married wealthy superbitch Kim Tate in the knowledge that he'd lost a fortune on the stock market. Unfortunately for him, Kim also had a secret. She wasn't quite as loaded as he'd hoped...\\" ReferencesExternal links * Character profile at MTV3 Emmerdale characters Television characters introduced in 1996 Fictional businesspeople Male characters in television ","title":"Steve Marchant"},{"id":"6301125","text":"Begone, Demons ( ukhruj minhā yā malʿūn; also translated as Get Out You Damned, or Get Out of Here, Curse You!) is Saddam Hussein's fourth and last novel. It is a fictional novel, with political metaphor. It is thought to have been written in anticipation of the 2003 Iraq War in 2002 or 2003. It was not yet published before the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. It was published in Japanese in 2006. Overview Begone, Demons tells the story of a tribe living on the Euphrates River for more than 1,500 years, which is invaded by another tribe, but win the war in the end. The main part of the book focuses on three men: Isaac, Joseph, and Mahmoud, who on her grandfather Abraham grew up as children. Isaac is a villain and traitor, while the other two, honest and good are hard. Later Isaac leaves and moves to a country west of the Dead Sea. There he joins forces with a greedy Roman governor, making money together at the expense of the local population. To keep their riches, they must eventually build two towers, However, they are attacked: Arab fighters they put a day on fire and even die in the flames as a Muslim martyr. Publication The book was published in Tokyo by a Japanese publisher, Tokuma Shoten Publishing, in 2006 under the title Devil's Dance (\\"Akuma no Dance\\"). 8,000 copies were printed, at 256 pages. It was translated into Turkish by Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi. Raghad Hussein had tried to publish the novel in Jordan, and planned to print 100 thousand copies, until the government prevented the publication. In 2007 the novel was translated into Russian and published in Saint Petersburg by Amfora Publishing House. 5000 copies were printed, at 206 pages. The chief editor of the publishing house Vadim Nazarov said that the novel’s publication was “an ideological initiative” and “a response to pain”. He explained that “when Serbian houses were being bombed, we published Serbian novels. Now we publish Saddam Hussein's book. When he was the leader of Iraq, there was more discipline in this country”. It has not been translated or sold in any other languages.

The overture is one of three early works by Lilburn which center on the theme of national identity; the other two are 1944's Landfall in Unknown Seas, for narrator and orchestra, and the tone poem A Song of Islands of 1946. The title of the overture (Aotearoa) is taken from the Māori name for the islands. Lilburn wrote the overture while he was still a student at London's Royal College of Music, and it was premiered in Great Britain, at His Majesty's Theatre in London. It was not performed in New Zealand until 1959, but it has since entered the standard orchestral repertory there. Typical of Lilburn's early work, the overture features idiomatic writing for winds, especially flutes, and vigorous dynamic contrasts.

They are designed as a flotation aid, rather than a life-saving device and have several key differences to other PFD's and lifejackets. Regardless of the specification of buoyancy aids, they do not provide (nor are they intended to) the same high level of protection as lifejackets. Canoeing and kayaking buoyancy aids are designed with mobility in mind. A buoyancy aid that does not fit properly can restrict a paddler's (kayaker's) range of movement, which could cause them to tire or prevent them from paddling properly. They typically have front and back foam buoyancy, with none or very little around the sides to allow for better arm movements.  Types of Buoyancy Aid  All canoeing and kayaking buoyancy aids are made with a foam core, instead of being inflatable like some life jackets. This removes the possibility of them bursting or not being activated in the case of an incapacitated paddler. The foam used is typically closed cell PVC (polyvinyl chloride), although some manufacturers are now starting to use less toxic and more recyclable materials. Older designs used vertically aligned ribs of foam all around the body, but more modern designs typically feature front and rear slabs of foam buoyancy, with the sides left clear to allow unrestricted rotation and arm movement. Most buoyancy aids are one of three basic designs: *Over the head vest, where the one-piece vest is pulled on over the head. *Front zip jacket, where the buoyancy aid is worn like a regular jacket, zipped up at the front. This design limits the front-buoyancy as it requires two separate blocks of foam and a gap for the zip. *Side zip is a combination of the other two, with a zip on the side rather than along the front. The added gap in one side makes it easier to get the vest on, and means that the front buoyancy can be one whole piece. All buoyancy aids include some form of strap for tightening the buoyancy aid, preventing it from coming off in the water. Many white water designs feature multiple straps on the shoulders and waist to ensure the buoyancy aid can not be swept off in fast water. They may also include pockets for storing equipment and a range of safety and rescue features. Some lower quality ones only offer a belt, and these are often poor fitting and may be designed for generic water sports rather than specifically canoeing/kayaking. There is a large variety of designs to fit every figure and purpose. It is important to have a buoyancy aid that fits comfortably, allowing freedom of movement. It is also important that it is suitable for the chosen discipline and the grade of water being paddled. Each discipline has different requirements and although one buoyancy aid can be used for multiple disciplines, there are several factors to consider which type to choose.  Canoe polo and slalom  These are designed with high maneuverability as a key feature, often at the expense of buoyancy. Minimalistic designs which tend to hug the body tightly and are well cut around the arms aim to allow the wearer complete freedom of motion (something important to both Slalom and Polo paddlers as well as playboaters). These vests may not be fully suitable for other purposes, such as whitewater paddling where additional buoyancy is required due to the higher flow of water. Canoe polo rules specify that the buoyancy aids must have protective buoyancy at the sides of the garment, resulting in a garment that has more overall coverage  Sea and touring  Buoyancy aids for sea and long distance touring often feature several large pockets for storing essential equipment, and many also accommodate hydration packs. They have to be comfortable to wear whilst paddling for long distances, and so typically have very low cut sides to allow the arms free movement. More recently they are being designed more and more like whitewater vests, with low cut fronts to allow the paddler to lean forward easily.  Whitewater  Whitewater buoyancy aids are designed to provide enough buoyancy in fast whitewater rivers, should the paddler capsize and leave the kayak. They are often more bulky than Slalom/Polo vests, but are usually cut short at the front to allow the paddler to lean further forward despite the thicker foam and allow good trunk rotation for quick turns. They always have shoulder and side straps to ensure they are not swept off in fast rapids. They typically feature one or two pockets to store basic essentials such as a rescue knife, carabiner and tow-line. Many often also feature harnesses for use in rescues, however these are often used without proper training and can become more of a danger to both the rescuer and the swimmer if used incorrectly. As an example, WW harnesses require a significant load to release effectively, (usually provided by the force of the water, when a rescuer in the river is held by rope from the bank). Without this load the harness may not release. So it is not a good idea to use these for low load situations, (e.g. towing kayaks), and in an incident it is necessary to get the rescuer to release from the harness, and not allow the person on the bank to release their end as the rescuer would end up swimming down river with 30+ metres of slack rope on their back. Training therefore is vital to avoid such situations.  Specifications  Buoyancy aids come with a set of specifications detailing their sizing, weight range, and the standards they adhere to. This is often in a table printed onto the inside of the buoyancy aid, or a label on the bag/box. Most companies give the specifications for each of their models on all of their buoyancy aids, to simplify the manufacturing process, so it is important to check the model and size range of any particular buoyancy aid. Buoyancy aids should detail: * Chest size: Usually a range either in inches or centimetres. * Weight range: Either in kilograms or pounds. * Force provided: The buoyant force provided by the buoyancy aid. For a buoyancy aid to be sold in the European Union, it must be C.E. tested and approved. *In the US, a buoyancy aid may be approved by the United States Coast Guard (although this is not a requirement). Most canoeing and kayaking buoyancy aids class as \\"Type III Flotation Aids\\", which means they provide a minimum of 15.5 lbf (pounds- force) (69 N) of buoyancy.  The 50N Buoyancy aid  Buoyancy aids with providing only 50 N of force should only be used by swimmers in sheltered waters when help is close at hand. They are not guaranteed to turn a person from a face-down position in the water.  Ageing  The foam used in buoyancy aids does degrade with age. Manufacturers add additional foam to ensure that their buoyancy aids will still provide enough force even after years of use. A rough life expectancy is three years of use, although buoyancy aids exposed to polluted water may degrade faster than normally expected. In practice buoyancy aids far exceed a 3-year service life expectancy, and can be tested for buoyancy using a weight. The other issues are damage, stitching and wear. Buoyancy aid and personal flotation devices need regular and routine inspection of any belts, stitching and other parts. This wear and damage serve as valuable indicators on when to retire a personal flotation service or buoyancy aid.  Harnesses  Many white water buoyancy aids, as well as some sea kayak ones, feature a safety harness. These fit around the buoyancy aid below the arms and can be used for Live Bait Rescues (where a rescuer swims out into the river on a line to rescue a swimmer) or for anchoring a belayer onto the bank. They feature quick-release buckles to quickly remove the harness, and these are often (but not always) designed to release automatically past a certain load/pressure. Often harnesses have a metal ring at the back for attaching a rope with a screwgate carabiner. Use of a non- locking carabiner can allow the carabiner to accidentally clip onto other straps on the buoyancy aid during use, thus preventing the harness from being released, and as such are not designed to be used for attaching to a harness. Many harnesses feature a metal friction plate which stops the belt from slipping under high-load situations, however these can also prevent the harness coming off when swimming and as such present more of a hazard than an aid. It is often recommended that the belt be removed from within the friction plate and only threaded back through if the situation requires an anchored belay. Improvised harnesses (ropes around the waist, belts, or attaching ropes directly onto the buoyancy aid itself) can present a serious danger to the wearer, as they can not be released or may not be strong enough to withstand the load required.  Pet buoyancy aid  In recent years pet buoyancy aids have become quite popular. A web search or visit to a pet supply store will reveal many types and brands of pet buoyancy aids including full life jackets, vests, and flotation collars. The purpose, design, and composition of these buoyancy aids are very similar to the human version with the major difference being that pet buoyancy aids are not usually required by law, also they are generally not certified by the Coast Guard or any other government department.  History  Ancient instances of the life jacket can be traced back to simple blocks of wood or cork used by Norwegian seamen. The modern life jacket is generally credited to one Captain Ward, a Royal National Lifeboat Institution inspector in the United Kingdom, who, in 1854, created a cork vest to be worn by lifeboat crews for both weather protection and buoyancy.

It was founded in 1887, during the period of the Russian Empire. After the Sovietization of Armenia, the factory became a state-owned enterprise. In 1999, the government of independent Armenia sold the factory to the French Pernod Ricard company for distilled beverages. The variety of the company's cognac products are labeled and publicized as ArArAt. The company owns another factory in the town of Armavir, operating since 1966. History Yerevan Brandy Company The Yerevan Brandy Company was founded in 1887 within the territories of the Erivan Fortress, by the wealthy 1st guild merchant Nerses Tairyan (Nerses Tairov), with the help of his cousin Vasily Tairov. However, the winery reached its hey-day in 1899, when it was leased to the Russian businessman Nikolay Shustov, who was a well-known vodka and liqueur producer. In 1900, the factory was fully acquired by Shustov to become known as \\"Shustov and Sons\\". Shustov's company became the main supplier of the Imperial Majesty's court of Russia. During the International Exhibition in Paris in 1900, Shustov's Armenian brandy received the Grand-Prix and the legal right to be called \\"cognac\\", following a blind degustation. In 1948, in connection with the reorganization of the Yerevan Ararat Wine-Brandy Factory (known until 1940 as the Shustov Factory), the factory building was separated into 2 entities: the Yerevan Ararat Brandy Factory and the Yerevan Brandy Factory. Yerevan Brandy Company Museum As a separate entity, the Yerevan Brandy Factory was transferred to a new building in 1953 constructed specifically for the production of brandy. It was designed by architect Hovhannes Margaryan. The new building stands on a high plateau at the western end of the Victory Bridge of Yerevan, on the right bank of Hrazdan River, opposite to the Yerevan Ararat Brandy Factory. With its nine austere arches, and long flight of steps leading to it, the building is hailed as one of the best architectural examples of the Soviet architecture in Yerevan. Between 1953 and 1991, the Yerevan Brandy Factory was granted the rights to become the plant to produce Armenian cognac within the Soviet Union. Markar Sedrakian was among the notable chief technologist of the factory who served form 1948 until 1973, to achieve the title of the Hero of Socialist Labor in 1966. After the collapse of the Soviet rule, the Yerevan Brandy Factory was sold by the Government of Armenia to French distiller Pernod Ricard for $30 million during June 1998, after competitive bidding organized by Admiralty Investment Group of New Zealand and Merrill Lynch International of London. Within the factory territories, the company also runs the \\"Ararat Heritage Center Museum and Shop\\" open for public tours. In 2001, a Peace Barrel was set for aging within the heritage center of the factory, in honor of the visit of OSCE Minsk Group co-chairs. The barrel will be opened only when the Karabakh conflict is resolved.ArArAt Cognac in Armenia Armenian cognac production One of factory's oak barrel depositories The ArArAt Armenian cognac is derived from the grapes of the fertile fields of the Ararat plain, Tavush region as well as Nagorno-Karabakh. In April 1999, on the initiative of Yerevan Brandy Company, a new standard was introduced in Armenia named \\"Armenian Cognac\\", which rigidly regulates the production of this beverage. Yerevan Brandy Company remains the uncontested leader on the volume of production and the export of Armenian brandy.

Nowark (1991) describes it as distributed in Bolivia and northern Chile. A recent publication of Pacheco (1995) also locates the species in the Puno Region of Peru. This species is also thought to be present in northern Argentina. However, this location may actually only contain a population of C. vellerosus. Physical description The Andean hairy armadillo averages a tail length of three to seven inches and a body length of eight to sixteen inches. This armadillo is found to have eighteen dorsal bands, in which eight are considered movable. The Andean hairy armadillo gets its name genuinely because this armadillo has hair covering all of its ventral side and its legs as well. This species comes in a variety of colors ranging from light brown to yellow/beige. Their teeth are unique because they are continuously growing and do not contain enamel. Their average weight tends to be four and a half to five pounds. They maintain an internal temperature and use limb countercurrent exchange as well. Diet and activity Andean hairy armadillos are considered omnivores because they eat a variety of foods. Their diet can consist of grains, roots, fruits and even small vertebrates. These armadillos have even been found to eat rotting flesh and the maggots found within the corpse. These mammals find their food by digging through leaves and substrates while using their nose to detect possible meals. They prefer open high-altitude grasslands to live in. This armadillo finds shelter in tunnels and burrows that it digs itself using fore- claws. Their territories are about eight acres in size. The Andean hairy armadillo's sleep schedule depend on the season and temperature of its habitat. In the summer months they are considered nocturnality so they do not overheat. They then switch to diurnality during the winter season to stay warm. The Andean hairy armadillo communicates with other armadillos through the use of chemicals, as well as through touch.  Reproduction  Male Andean hairy armadillos only pair up with a female during mating season. They are a polygynandrous species and each adult lives a solitary life. The male armadillo is known to have the longest penises, in proportion to the body size, of any mammal. Males are called lister and females are called zed. Mating season begins in the fall and young are usually born in the summertime with a total of only two offspring. Females are pregnant for only two months though. This two months pregnancy, but births in the summer is because the family Dasypodidae is known for their ability to have delayed implantation and all the embryos produced are from a single zygote. Embryos within the mother still produce their own placenta. Armadillo's offspring are referred to as pups and are born helpless. They remain with their mother fully dependent for fifty days and are sexually mature by twelve months.  Threats and conservation aid  The Andean hairy armadillo has been given a bad reputation of that with its nine-banded cousin Dasypus novemcinctus and thought to carry leprosy. The main threat to this species is being hunted and having its shell sold for musical instrument making, body parts for medical remedies, and for food. Others, simply are killed because they are seen as a pest in that they cause agriculture destruction with their burrow making. Another threat is the fact that they are losing much of their habitat to road construction, farming, and deforestation. However, there are a few aids out there to try to help this species of armadillo survive. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild (CITES) has banned all trading of the Andean hairy armadillo and the capture of it. Yet, the demand for this armadillo's products still remain and many are killed regardless.

The council is headquartered at the Royce Reynolds Family Scout Office in Greensboro, North Carolina and operates four camps; one of which is outside the council boundaries. The ONSC represents Boy Scouting in Davie, Davidson, Randolph, Guilford, Alamance, Rockingham, Caswell, and Person counties of North Carolina. The council's name is derived from the state's official song, The Old North State. History The Old North State Council was formed from the merger of three smaller councils in the mid-1990s: General Greene Council, Uwharrie Council, and Cherokee Council. Organization The Old North State Council is divided into five districts for more locally tailored programs and local leadership. The districts are listed below along with the regions they represent: *Akela District - represents the greater High Point area (Serving High Point, Thomasville, Jamestown, Wallburg, Archdale, Trinity) *Alamance District - represents all of Alamance County (including Burlington, Haw River, Saxapahaw, Snow Camp, Mebane, Graham, Elon, and Union Ridge) *Cherokee District - represents Rockingham, Caswell, and Person Counties (Reidsville, Eden, Stoneville, Mayodan, Madison, Yanceyville, Roxboro, Timberlake, Ruffin, Pelham, Providence, Rougemont) *Guilford District - represents Monticello, Gibsonville, Julian, Pleasant Garden, Brown Summit, Colfax, Guilford College, Oak Ridge, Stokesdale, Summerfield, and all of Northwestern Greensboro and all of Eastern Guilford County *Uwharrie District - represents Randolph County, most of Davidson County, and Davie County (Asheboro, Seagrove, Ramseur, Liberty, Randleman, Franklinville, Coleridge, Level Cross, Gray's Chapel, Lexington, Mocksville, Midway, Advance, Linwood, Churchland, Southmont, Denton, and Welcome) Camps=Cherokee Scout Reservation A portrait of Allan \\"Doc\\" Lewis rests within the OA Lodge Building named in his honor. Cherokee Scout Reservation (CSR) is a Boy Scout camp in central Caswell County, North Carolina near the town of Yanceyville. It is situated on over of hardwood forest and is the headquarters for the Tsoiotsi Tsogalii Lodge. The camp was founded in the 1960s by Allan \\"Doc\\" Lewis and associates and was named after the local Cherokee tribe. It hosts the council's largest summer camp, which is usually held each week for six weeks each summer. () History of Cherokee Scout Reservation The original Camp Cherokee was located in Rockingham County, near the town of Wentworth. Established around 1940, this camp functioned for several years until growth made it obvious that a larger facility would be necessary. For one year, 1967, the camp functioned at a different facility. In 1968 Cherokee (current location) opened to campers, and has been welcoming scouts every summer since. =Eyes of Cherokee= The camp's official camp song is \\"The Eyes of Cherokee\\", which was written by Doc Lewis and is sung to the tune of \\"I've Been Working on the Railroad\\". The song's lyrics are as follows: The eyes of Cherokee are upon you, All the live- long day. The eyes of Cherokee are upon you, You cannot get away. Do not try to escape them At night or early in the morn. The eyes of Cherokee are upon you, 'Til Gabriel blows his horn. This song is sung multiple times during the year at CSR, most notably by the summer camp staff at the Thursday night campfire. The song has been sung at many world landmarks as well, including the Golden Gate Bridge, the Gateway Arch, and the Wright Brothers Memorial. Woodfield Scout Preservation Woodfield Scout Preservation (commonly known as Camp Woodfield) is an Boy Scout camp in western Randolph County, North Carolina between the municipalities of Asheboro, Trinity, and Denton (). It is situated along the banks of the Uwharrie River in the Uwharrie Mountains. Camp Woodfield is mainly used for Cub Scout events, but numerous Boy Scout and Order of the Arrow events are also held there. The camp is divided into three sections: Woodfield East (the largest with most amenities), Woodfield West (more primitive), and Primitive Camp (most primitive). The camp was donated by Elliot S. Wood and Mary Webb Wood in 1989. Hagan Sea Base Charles T. Hagan Sea Scout Base (or just Hagan Sea Base) is an Old North State Council camp on the Davidson County, North Carolina shores of High Rock Lake. It is located just south of Southmont off North Carolina State Highway 8 (). The camp was renovated and upgraded in the early 2000s from a primitive-style camp, to a functioning summer camp with restrooms and offices. Hagan specializes in water activities for Boy Scouts and Venture Scouts, including canoeing, sailing, fishing and motorboating. 50 Mile Canoe Treks are held at Hagan, as are Whitewater Merit Badge and Canoeing Merit Badge classes. Hemric Scout Reservation H. Clay Hemrick Scout Reservation is an Old North State Council operated camp outside the council boundaries on an island in Kerr Lake near Clarksville, Virginia. It is the least used of the ONSC camps and can only be accessed by watercraft. Facilities on the island include latrines, a small dining hall, a boating dock, and a lodge building. Order of the Arrow Tsoiotsi Tsogalii (Lodge #70) is a lodge in the Order of the Arrow (OA), BSA's National Honor Society. The Lodge serves and is backed by the Old North State Council. Tsoiotsi Tsogalli is part of the SR-7B Section of the Southern Region of the Order of the Arrow. The Lodge's totem is the Red- tailed Hawk. Approximately 1750 Arrowmen are currently registered as members of Tsoiotsi Tsogalii. History The Tsoiotsi Tsogalii Lodge name means \\"We Three are Friends\\" in the Cherokee language and was formed from three smaller lodges. The first, Tali Tak Taki #70 merged with Uwharrie Lodge #208 in the early 1990s to form Keyauwee Lodge #70. This short-lived lodge then merged with Tsalagi Lodge #163 in 1994 to form Tsoiotsi Tsogalli, which still exists today. In 2001, based on the Lodge's Service to Cub Scouting, Tsoiotsi Tsogalii received the National Service Award. This was followed by the Lodge's acceptance of the E. Urner Goodman Camping Award in 2003 and a National Service Grant in 2005, which helped construct a Health & Fitness shelter at Cherokee Scout Reservation. Executive Committee The Lodge's leadership consists of a Lodge Chief and five Vice Chiefs elected annually by the Lodge youth, of a few Lodge Committee Chairmen, and of five Chapter Chiefs elected by each Chapter's youth. The group meets together as the Lodge's Executive Committee (EC) with their adult Advisers at monthly meetings (no meetings usually occur in June and July). Each officer (the mentioned excluding Advisers) has one vote per decision at these meetings, as does the immediately previous Lodge Chief. The EC is governed by the Lodge Bylaws and Parliamentary Procedure. Each Lodge officer must be a registered Lodge youth to carry out his position. The Lodge Vice Chief positions in order with no succession are as follows: * Vice Chief of Program * Vice Chief of Service * Vice Chief of Communications * Vice Chief of Administration * Vice Chief of Indian Affairs A trio known as the \\"Key 3\\" are allowed to make certain decisions with approval from the EC. The group consists of the Lodge Chief, the Lodge Adviser, and the Lodge Staff Adviser. Lodge Committee Chairmen are appointed and confirmed by the EC. The number of Chairmen varies from year to year depending on scheduled activities and programs instituted by the EC. At the EC meetings, each Chairman is granted one vote on each decision until the committee that he represents is dissolved. Lodge bylaws The Lodge Bylaws act as a constitution for the Lodge, forming the basis for the organization of leadership and membership. The current Bylaws were implemented under the administration of former Lodge Chief R. Martin Stamat (2007) and are divided into four articles, each dealing with a certain aspect of the Lodge. Articles I and II focus on the establishment of the Tsoiotsi Tsogalii Lodge and the qualifications for membership in the Lodge. One of the bylaws states that a member in Lodge 70 must be a registered member of the Old North State Council. Article III briefly describes the responsibilities of all the Lodge Officers and Advisers and explains that additional temporary responsibilities may be added for Officers. The fourth Article explains the expectations of Tsoiotsi Tsogalii members at Lodge functions, and also declares that items sold by the Lodge must be either approved by Executive Committee or the leadership of the place where the items are sold. The fifth and final Article lays out the steps necessary for amending the Bylaws document. A proposed amendment must be presented to the Executive Committee, where a motion to approve the amendment must receive two-thirds approval. Then, the proposed amendment must be presented to the Lodge membership for a majority vote before it becomes active. Chapters The Tsoiotsi Tsogalii Lodge is divided into 5 separate chapters, each with an elected Chapter Chief, an elected team of Vice Chiefs, and a team of appointed Advisers. Tsoiotsi Tsogalii's Chapters are listed below along with the regions they represent: * Alamance Chapter - represents all of Alamance County. * Saura Chapter - represents all of Caswell County, Person County, and Rockingham. * Dahlonega Tawodi Chapter - represents Guilford County. * Tutelo Chapter - represents Greater High Point in Guilford County and the northeastern portion of Davidson County. * Keyauwee Chapter - represents all of Randolph County, all of Davie County and a majority of Davidson County Events Tsoiotsi Tsogalii members at the National Order of the Arrow Conference at Michigan State University in 2006. A picket sign of the Lodge's S1 flap is shown in the background. Each year, the Tsoiotsi Tsogalii Lodge hosts two fellowship weekends in the Spring and Fall, three induction weekends, one Vigil weekend, one Lodge Leadership Development Conference (LLDC) and many other smaller events. Approximately once every six years, the Lodge hosts the SR-7B Section Cardinal Conclave, a convention-style event where Arrowmen from all over the Section gather for fellowship and competition. Lodges compete against each other in events such as Indian dancing and the Quest for the Golden Arrow Games, which is similar to a decathlon. Tsoiotsi Tsogalii Lodge last hosted a SR-7B Conclave in 2012 at Cherokee Scout Reservation. Lodge events are most commonly held at either Cherokee Scout Reservation or Woodfield Scout Preservation.

It is served as a smoothie in a bowl or glass, and is commonly topped with granola and banana, and then mixed with other fruits and guaraná syrup. Although açaí na tigela is popular all over Brazil, in the 1970s it first started to commercially appear in Rio de Janeiro, after multiple martial artist began using it for training diets. Most notably it was Carlos Gracie, a Brazilian jujitsu practitioner who incorporated the açaí in his fitness \\"Gracie Diet\\", which he recommended for his fighters. He saw the benefits of açaí as having \\"low sugar, full of vitamin and antioxidant content and thought to boost energy\\" Nowadays, it is mainly in Pará, Rio de Janeiro, Florianópolis, São Paulo, Goiás and along the northeastern coast, where it is sold in kiosks lining the beach promenade and in juice bars throughout the cities. Preparation differs from region to region. Tapioca pearls are a common topping in northern Brazil. The original recipe, as eaten in the North, contains shrimp or fried fish and tapioca or farofa and is usually salty. It was also common to see açaí served with fish and cassava. The sweet variety, which contains granola, banana, blueberry, strawberry, goji berry, and other fruits, as well as sugar, is more common in southern parts of the country. Regardless of the preparation, açaí's purple berries are thought to be a strong superfood of the Amazons. It contains iron, calcium, and fiber as well as have ten times more antioxidants than red grapes.  Health Benefits  Açai na tagela is made from açai, a small purple berry that comes from palm trees in the Amazons; mainly in Brazil, Colombia, and Suriname. Although in these place the berry is often used as an antidiarrheal, amongst the scientific community it is considered a superfood for its high antioxidant content, anti-inflammatory benefits, support of the immune system, diminished risk of coronary heart disease, and hypocholesterolemic effect. Its anti-oxidant properties help reduce the risk of diabetes, cancer, vascular diseases and aging by diminishing free radicals in the body, or reactive oxygen/nitrogen species. These scientific conclusions have served to advertise açai na tigela as a fitness snack that has \\"low sugar, is full of vitamin and antioxidant content and thought to boost energy\\", as famous jujitsu practitioner Carlos Gracie claimed with the \\"Gracie Diet\\". When isolating the pulp of the açai berry, a recent pilot study was analyzing the risks of metabolic disorders in overweight subjects, and concluded that with açai pulp, their glucose and insulin levels reduced after 30 days. Another study was doing research on anthocyanins, a compound found in many berries, and found that it can diminish the risk of heart attacks in young and middle aged women by 32%.  History  Açaí na tigela (\\"açaí in the bowl\\") is a Brazilian specialty from Pará and Amazonas, where the ribeirinhos population prepare it regularly. They harvest the berries by hand and make different traditional preparations by incorporating their \\"earthy\\" and \\"creamy\\" taste into traditional dishes. In northern Brazil, tapioca pearls are now used as a topping but the original recipe wasn't sweet, it was salty and consisted of either shrimp, fried fish, or farofa. It's also popular to find variations with fish and cassava in the north while in southern Brazil, the dish is prepared sweet with granola and other fruits as well. Açai na tagela started to commercially appear in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in the 1970s by influence of Carlos Gracie. Nowadays, it is mainly in Pará, Rio de Janeiro, Florianópolis, São Paulo, Goiás and along the northeastern coast, where it is sold in kiosks lining the beach promenade and in juice bars throughout the cities. It wasn't until the 1990s that its appeal to the fitness community was grand enough to allow for external management to come into the Amazons and facilitate the extraction process. Açaí bowls first were imported to the US in the 2000s when Ryan and Jeremy Black, two brothers along with their friend, Edmund Nichols created the company Sambazon after trying the product and Brazil and deciding they wanted to bring it to America. Here, surfers in Hawaii and Southern California immediately included them more in their diets after importations were available and the product grew popularity. The biggest challenge that importing açaí to the U.S. historically and currently poses is that, to eat the berries, they must be soaked in water and then have their pulp removed. This pulp can only be consumed for up to 24 hours which is why the açaí market in America has capitalized on freezing as a method of importation. To freeze the pulp of the berries, they must be taken to a nearby factory after harvest. During this process, both the companies and the native communities profit from harvesting, with new job opportunities either harvesting in the wild or on \\"minimally managed jungle plots\\". For the future, it has been predicted in the Açaí Berry Market report that there will be significant growth between 2020-2027. One of the major reasons for this growth is that açaí berries are starting to be used by the organic cosmetic industry since they promote elasticity in the skin as well as vitamins A, C and E for regeneration. In 2016, the global market for açaí was valued at $696 million dollars but it is expected to climb to $2,285.7 billion dollars by 2026. The global consumption of açaí berries will continue to rise but its expansion won't necessarily be caused by reforming the açaí na tigela dish but by using this superfood to capitalize on its health benefits in other fields, such as cosmetics, protein drinks, and other beverages.

Malacosoma species are notable for their caterpillars which are brightly coloured and form silken tents to regulate their temperature. Malacosoma neustria caterpillars are brown with blue, orange and white stripes. The adults are a fairly uniform brown. The larvae feed mainly on trees and shrubs from within their tents. Subspecies *Malacosoma neustria neustria *Malacosoma neustria flavescens Grünberg, 1912 (Morocco, Algeria) *Malacosoma neustria formosana Matsumura, 1932 (Taiwan) Distribution and habitat The lackey moth is widely distributed across Europe, Asia and North Africa. Its habitat is the edges of woodland, bushy grassland, coppices, hedgerows and road verges. The caterpillar's food plants include apple, pear, plum, willow, hornbeam, lime and oak. Life cycle Eggs of the lackey moth are laid in ring-like bands in late summer on twigs of the host trees where they overwinter. On hatching, the larvae are gregarious and weave for themselves a silken canopy of webbing. They eat the young foliage of the tree and moult several times as they grow larger. When ready to pupate they drop to the ground and undergo metamorphosis, each forming a pupa sandwiched between leaves of plants growing beneath the tree. In both Britain and Germany the flight period is from June to August.

It is the first of a series of books featuring the character Joey Pigza. The book was a National Book Award finalist. Plot The book describes the life of a child named Joey Pigza who frequently gets into trouble at school due to his erratic behavior. He has a habit of swallowing a key attached to a piece of string in order to pull it back out again, and on one instance he forgets to attach a string to the key, preventing him from pulling it back up. At school, Joey puts his finger in a pencil sharpener, runs around with scissors, and cuts the tip of a girl's nose off. Pigza is on medication which he takes regularly, but it doesn't seem to be very effective. As a consequence of slicing off the tip of his classmate's nose, Pigza is suspended from school and sent to a special education center.

The company is owned by the Walchand Group. Walchand established Premier Ltd. with the encouragement and support of architect of modern India, Sir. M. Vishweswarayya. In October 1947 Premier Ltd. manufactured the first Indian made trucks and cars rolled out onto the streets of a free India. History Plymouth Savoy 1956 Dodge - Kingsway - 1956 - 28 hp - 6 cyl - WBE 1362 - Kolkata 2014-01-19 6408 Fiat 1100 Millecento was launched in 1954 Fiat 1100 Elegant launched in 1955 Fiat 1100 Selectin 1958 followed by Super Select The company was established in 1941 and negotiated with Chrysler Corporation for licenses to build a Plymouth car and a Dodge truck, sold under the Dodge, Plymouth, DeSoto, and Fargo names starting around 1949. In the early years, quality was considered good by both Chrysler and the Indian Department of Defense. In 1949, parts were being made in India, starting with simpler components and gradually building up to more complex pieces. Two companies made parts for these vehicles: Premier and Hindustan Motors of Calcutta. The early years of Premier and Hindustan were marked by very low sales, due to the size of the market; only about 20,000 vehicles per year were made in India, in 65 different models. To prevent foreign companies from dominating by mass-producing parts to be assembled into cars in India, the government set up steep import duties on imported parts in 1954, allowing Indian parts-makers to survive. Premier licensed and manufactured a version of the Fiat 1100 D (beginning in 1964 continuing almost unchanged into the late 1990s). The car was initially marketed as a Fiat (\\"1100 Delight\\") and subsequently as the Premier Padmini with a 1100 cc engine and manufactured at the now defunct Kurla factory in suburban Mumbai. Later models included the Premier 118NE (named after its 1171 cc Nissan A12 engine and with a transmission from the Nissan Cherry), a version of the 1960s Fiat 124 built in a then-new (but now defunct) factory at Kalyan. The 118NE was considered a mid-size luxury car in India until the influx of modern cars in the 1990s. Liberalisation With market liberalisation, Premier teamed up with Peugeot to build an outdated model of the popular Peugeot 309 in India. Production began in 1998 and initial demand was high. Labour problems and poor dealer service led to problems which were compounded when Premier also aligned themselves with Fiat to manufacture the Fiat Uno. Peugeot pulled out of the venture around 2000 after only a few thousand cars sold. Labour and service issues also plagued the Fiat venture and a strike finally caused that plant to shut around 2001. Fiat and Premier faced severe criticism in media. There were various criminal cases against its promoters and the consumer courts of India were flooded with complaints for non-refund of the car booking. The promoters of Premier Automobiles have also been confronted with criminal cases in various consumer courts of India under section 27 of the Consumer Protection Act. A customer association based at Gujarat-Rajkot called PAL Car Customer Association has made various representations against the Premier Automobiles Ltd. In November 2004, Premier restarted operations by building a small diesel powered van called the Sigma. It was based on a 1980s Mitsubishi Varica design licensed from China Motor in Taiwan, originally intended to be fitted with Peugeot's TUD5 diesel engine. The production version, as finally presented in late 2004, instead had a Hindustan-built 2-liter Isuzu diesel unit. It has and is mated to a four-speed manual gearbox, while the car offers from five to nine seats. A multitude of other versions have since been developed, and as of December 2009 the engine has been replaced by a 1.5 liter IDI diesel (with or without turbo) or by the CNG-powered 1.8-liter 4ZB1 (both still manufactured by Hindustan). The facelift also meant improved suspension. There was also a pickup version of the Sigma, called the Premier Roadstar. Today, Premier has two business segments: Engineering and Automotive. The Engineering segment has two activities - CNC Machine Division and Engineering while the Automotive segment consists of Light Utility Vehicles and Sports Utility Vehicles. Originally based in Mumbai, Premier is now located at an ISO 9001 certified plant in Chinchwad, Pune. Spread over 27 acres, this plant now serves as the centralized research, development and manufacturing for all activities. In October 2009, Premier re-entered the Indian passenger vehicle market with a compact SUV named RiO. Rio is assembled from CKD kits of Zotye Nomad I made by Zotye Auto of China, and went on sale in December 2009. This vehicle is itself a poorly built copy of Daihatsu's old Terios model again from the 1998. Im December 2018 the company filed for bankruptcy.

Ahmed Bey engaged in many pastimes, such as hunting and horse riding. From time to time he took part in expeditions to protect Ottoman troops, who were engaged against hostile Kabyle tribes such as the Beni Menad and the Beni Djenad. During his pilgrimage to Mecca, which lasted fifteen months, in Egypt he met several famous people, including Muhammad Ali Pasha, his son Ibrahim Pasha and Tusun Pasha. Bey of Constantine and French invasion Appointed Bey of Constantine in 1826, he modernized the country focusing on the army. He led the Algerian resistance against the French occupation forces in the eastern Algeria with the aid of Hussein Pasha and, after the capture of Algiers, he retired in his province to Constantine. In 1832 he entrusted his lieutenant Ben Aïssa the care for the population of Bône. He continued to organize the defence of Constantine, Algeria, and lead several battles against the French army. In January 1834, the Bey of Constantine Hadj Ahmed Bey and the chiefs of many tribes around Constantine sent a petition to the British Parliament to seek the help of Britain against French forces. He won his first success in 1836 against maréchal Clauzel. When Constantine was besieged by the French in 1837, Ahmed Bey managed to escape and to organize resistance in the Aurès Mountains. In 1842, he rallies the tribe of Ouled Nasser, hoping to provide support with the Kabyles, and approached the camp of Ain Roumel. On 25 August 1842, French General Jean-René Sillègue enters the land of the Amouchas, namely a village north of Sétif, and met a gathering of two to three thousand Kabyles who failed to stop him. On September 10, the General defeated the Cavalry of Hadj Ahmed Bey at the foot of Djbel Bou Taleb, and manages to destroy his influence on the tribes of the Tell.

She debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 28 June 1995. Chloe left in 1999, making a short return stint in 2005 when she died from the resulting injuries of a car crash. Chloe has relationships with Jack Wilson, Curtis Reed, Lachlan Fraser, James Fraser and Jesse McGregor. In 2017, Wright stated that she would love to return to the show, after her supposed on-screen death. She stated that 'it was possible’. Casting and Character development Wright was asked to join the regular cast of Home and Away as Chloe, after initially appearing as a background extra in the series. Several months into her role as Chloe, Wright began to find her fame hard to deal with at first. Of an encounter with a group of teenagers who began harassing her at a local mall, she said \\"So I just steer clear of places where young people hang out - shopping centres, McDonald's, cinema strips... Going out for dinner's fine but I haven't been shopping for a long time.\\" In one storyline Chloe discovers that she is pregnant. Wright said \\"I'm really looking forward to being heavily pregnant, I've been trying on some 'stomachs' in the wardrobe department. It's so much fun.\\" Storylines Chloe is first seen when she works on a school project with Jack Wilson (Daniel Amalm). They begin a relationship but Chloe's racist father Max (Rob Steele) takes an instant dislike to Jack, due to him being mixed race. When Max begins being physically abusive towards Chloe, she flees to Western Australia to stay with her estranged mother, Maureen (Liz Burch). After Maureen rejects her, Chloe returns to Summer Bay and is devastated when she finds out Max has left and Jack is dating his foster sister Sally Fletcher (Kate Ritchie). Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger) takes Chloe in and fosters her. Chloe leaves again, this time to search for Max. When she returns, it is apparent that she is hooked on drugs, but keeps it a secret. When the police raid Summer Bay High, Chloe implicates her dealer, school secretary Joanne Brennan (Kimberley Joseph). Chloe is then forced to repeat Year 11 and is deeply unhappy about this but she reconciles her relationship with Curtis Reed (Shane Ammann), who had battled alcoholism the previous year. Donald Fisher (Norman Coburn), Chloe's principal is impressed with the progress she is making but views Curtis as detriment to her studies. Upon learning that she could top the State HSC History results, Chloe applies for a scholarship but is rejected by the University when her drug past is revealed. Chloe and Irene blame Fisher for the revelation but he maintains he told the truth to give Chloe an honest start. At an end of term HSC party, Chloe is raped while walking along the beach. The trauma effects her greatly causing her to cut her hair shorter and have nightmares about shooting Curtis. Alex Bennett (Nick Freedman) finds Chloe's shoe on the beach and is later arrested as a suspect, However, he is later released due to lack of evidence. Colin Parker, a man matching the description of the rapist, is brought to trial but Chloe fails to recognise him in the courtroom and he is freed but shot dead by an angry Max. Chloe and Curtis split amicably after several months and Chloe begins receiving counselling from Brad Cooper (Bruce Samazan). Chloe falls for Brad and they go away for Christmas but Brad's true colours are revealed and Chloe, upon realising he is her rapist, tries to flee. Brad hotly pursues her but catches his leg in a dog trap, which he had used to stop Chloe from escaping. Chloe rolls up the window of the car and hides until morning. Constable Terri Garner (Alyson Standen) and Travis Nash (Nic Testoni) arrive on the scene and Brad is arrested and transferred to a psychiatric hospital after having his leg amputated due to severe blood loss. Chloe is finally able to put the ordeal behind her. When Chloe kisses Jesse McGregor (Ben Unwin), her foster sister, Selina Roberts' (Tempany Deckert) boyfriend, it causes tension between the girls in the house. Jesse and Chloe have a brief dalliance which does not last as Jesse still loves Selina. Chloe then has a one-night stand with doctor Lachlan Fraser (Richard Grieve) and becomes pregnant with his child. Most Summer Bay residents assume Jesse is the father but Selina figures out Lachlan is. Lachlan develops feelings for Chloe but Lachlan's mother Diana (Kerry McGuire) is horrified when she learns about Chloe's pregnancy and threatens to reveal her drug past unless she stays away from Lachlan. Irene records a conversation between Chloe and Diana and plays it to Lachlan, who orders Diana to leave their lives. Chloe and Lachlan become a couple and move into a flat together. Before the birth Chloe experiences several false alarms and goes into labour while walking on the beach. Chloe gives birth to a daughter, Olivia. Several weeks later, Lachlan is diagnosed with a brain tumour and undergoes surgery but the procedure leaves him comatose for several days. When Lachlan regains consciousness he is left unable to move or communicate properly. Chloe offers to look after him at home but finds herself at odds with Diana when she returns and they argue over Lachlan's care. In the end, Lachlan agrees to undergo treatment in America which Diana funds and leaves Chloe devastated. After deciding to surprise Lachlan in the states by taking Olivia with her to visit him for Thanksgiving, Chloe is devastated when she learns that Lachlan has moved on with a new partner. Lachlan's brother James (Michael Piccirilli) comes to support Chloe and Olivia during this difficult time, and they soon become romantically involved. They later marry but face numerous problems, particularly when Lachlan dies of a second hemorrhage. Chloe leaves the bay after realising she does not love James like she loves Lachlan. Chloe and James agree to remain friends and she later sends him a card on his birthday. Chloe and Olivia return in June 2005 to stay with Irene in order to escape her abusive boyfriend Troy Peters (Christian Willis). She reveals she is now a lawyer and tells Irene that she met Troy while living in the city and he is a colleague at the law firm. Chloe seeks comfort in Jesse but Troy eventually arrives in town and begins terrorizing her and attacks Jesse. When Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher) celebrates his 60th birthday, Chloe attends the party at Summer Bay House and enjoys herself. Jesse asks her out but she rejects him and apologizes for misleading him. Jesse, crushed, leaves the party early. Troy arrives claiming he has been released on bail and Chloe refuses to talk to him. Will Smith (Zac Drayson) and Flynn Saunders (Joel McIlroy) physically remove Troy who tells Chloe that if he can't have her no-one will. At the end of the night, Chloe drives home along with Alf, Ric Dalby (Mark Furze), Martha MacKenzie (Jodi Gordon) and Kim Hyde (Chris Hemsworth). The car is hit by an oncoming driver on the wrong side of the road. Ric and Alf battle to save Martha and Kim. Chloe is seemingly fine with only a broken arm. At the hospital, Chloe suggests someone deliberately ran them off the road and Alf agrees. She also blames herself for the accident and Martha's injuries as she was driving.

He made his first appearance on 1 April 1994. Jack was introduced as a new foster child for the characters of Michael (Dennis Coard) and Pippa Ross (Debra Lawrence). Amalm auditioned for the role in the place of his friend, who could not attend. Many actors auditioned to play Jack, but Amalm was eventually cast. Jack is characterised as a \\"bad boy\\" and a \\"wild child\\" and Amalm enjoyed playing the role of the \\"baddie\\". Jack's storylines feature racial abuse, rebellious behaviour, joy riding and various romances. In 1996, Amalm quit the series to concentrate on his music career. The actor did not like the monotony that accompanied playing the same role, but he remained open minded about a future return. He did so in 2000, when Jack returned as part of episodes centred on a fellow character's wedding. Jack has received mainly positive reviews from critics. Ian Hyland from the Sunday Mirror branded Jack a \\"rebel rouser\\", while a reporter from The Gold Coast Bulletin called him a \\"dumb but streetwise kid\\". The Sun- Herald's Scott Ellis noted that Amalm's portrayal transformed Jack into one of Australia's \\"best-loved bad boys\\". Amalm was nominated for the \\"Most Popular New Talent\\" award at the 1995 Logie Awards. Creation and casting Amalm had a Japanese exchange student living with his family, an agent spotted the student Brazilian dancing in a club and took his details. The agent attempted to call the student back, but Amalm's father took the call. The student could not make the audition, so Amalm went in place of his place. Amalm was picked to play Jack from thousands of young actors, despite not being on the list to audition. Amalm was a busker with no acting experience, but he impressed producers so much with his performance that he was given the role of Jack. The actor told Alex Cramb of Inside Soap \\"I was given six pages of script at the original interview to learn. I did my best but my name wasn't even on the list when I went to the audition, so they didn't know I was doing it. I just sort of turned up, no-one knew me.\\" Upon joining Home and Away, Amalm said that his co-star Dieter Brummer helped him to settle in properly. Lisa Anthony writing for BIG! billed Jack as a \\"guitar strumming muso\\" who arrives to be fostered by Michael (Dennis Coard) and Pippa Ross (Debra Lawrence). She reported that the industry had tipped Amalm to become \\"a huge star\\" thanks to the role. In addition the character was introduced to \\"feature in some massive storylines\\". Character development Amalm told BIG! magazine's Anthony that he was not like Jack because he has respect for Melissa George and Laura Vasquez - unlike Jack who is \\"persistently trying to crack onto\\" their characters, Angel Parrish and Sarah Thompson. Dieter Brummer who plays Shane Parrish on the serial often said that Jack behaved very much like Shane did during his early years. He had a running joke with Amalm that the Home and Away writers were recycling Shane's scripts and using them for Jack. Jack begins dating fellow \\"wild child\\" Selina Cook (Tempany Deckert). Deckert told Victoria Ross of Inside Soap that it comes as a \\"big surprise\\" for Selina when she realises that she is attracted to Jack. Selina is \\"used to chasing anything in trousers\\" but finds herself falling in love. Deckert said that the fact Jack has not got any parents makes her \\"warm\\" to him, eventually seeing him as her \\"soul mate\\". Deckert and Amalm were \\"thrown together\\" by producers and the pair adjusted to their character's passionate scenes. She added they \\"just dive straight in and get on with it\\" and maintained a professional relationship.Daniel Amalm (pictured) quit Home and Away when playing Jack became too monotonous. Jack and Curtis Reed (Shane Ammann) later befriend Eric Phillips (Daniel Goddard). Eric was introduced into the series on a six-week guest stint and is characterised as being manipulative and has muscles. Goddard told Inside Soap's Ross that his character \\"knows how to get people on side\\". When Jack and Curtis ask him to help them to get into shape, he reveals that he uses steroids. Goddard said that Eric \\"suggests that Jack try steroids to build up his muscles even more\\" and this turns the situation \\"sour\\". In one storyline Jack is racially abused by Max (Rob Steele), the father of his girlfriend, Chloe Richards' (Kristy Wright). The abuse occurs because Jack's mother Maria (Kim Antonios) is Lebanese. Amalm said that he related to Jack's storyline because his parents were from ethnic backgrounds and he was mixed race. He added that his newfound fame elevated the abuse. Jack makes friends with Rad (Rudi Baker), a fellow rebellious character who leads Jack into joy riding. While taking a car on a ride, it crashes and bursts into flames. Amalm told Inside Soap's reporter that a stunt man took his place while filming the actual crash scenes. The stunt man safely flipped the car onto the roof while he was inside. After Amalm had to be \\"squeezed into a wrecked car that was upside down\\". Rad climbs out of the car and leaves Jack trapped inside. Nelson McFarlane (Laurence Breuls) manages to save Jack from the wreckage; but the fire spreads throughout Summer Bay. Amalm said that \\"Jack has some major sucking up to do to make amends for causing the fire!\\" Jack enlists the help of Shannon Reed (Isla Fisher) to arrange a charity concert to make up for his wrongdoing. Amalm said \\"thank goodness\\" for Jack that it all works out well in the end. Amalm opined it was easy to get bored of playing the same character, but was content to be portraying the \\"baddie\\" type role that Jack fills. In 1996, Amalm left the serial to pursue other projects. Amalm told a reporter from Inside Soap that he was bored of doing monotonous work which was not \\"his thing\\". He added that it was too time consuming and wanted to concentrate more on his music. Amalm told Fiona Parker from the Daily Mirror that he was contracted for another year which he managed to get out of. In the build-up to his exit, Jack becomes \\"full circle\\" and starts acting wayward. Amalm said that Jack's final stories were his favourites because Jack returns to \\"being more of a rebel\\". The reporter added that Jack would leave \\"under the same dark cloud accompanied his arrival\\". Amalm said that he had no plans to return to the series, but would not rule out a return in the future. In 2000, Amalm returned to Home and Away; Jack featured in episodes centred on Sally Fletcher's (Kate Ritchie) wedding to Kieran Fletcher (Spencer McLaren).Mercado 2004, p.264. Storylines Jack first arrives in Summer Bay to live with Pippa and Michael as their latest foster child. Jack is rude to his foster siblings and Michael at first but eventually settles after it transpires Jack's home life is chaotic due to his abusive new stepfather. Jack antagonises Shane by making a pass at his girlfriend, Angel. To teach Jack a lesson, Shane gives him false directions to Angel's bedroom. Jack climbs in through a window and attempts to crawl into bed with Angel only to find he has broken into the bedroom of local principal Donald Fisher (Norman Coburn), who Shane and Angel live with. Jack beats a hasty retreat. Jack begins seeing Selina and begins cheating on her with Angel's sister, Frankie (Lenka Kripac) and Sonia Johnson (Eva Matiuk), who he had been seeing while she was with Tug O'Neale (Tristan Bancks). The girls realise Jack has been three-timing them and get revenge by luring him to a caravan under the pretext of a foursome, but stripping him to his boxers, leaving Jack humiliated. Jack begins dating new student Chloe but has to contend with her racist father, Max. Chloe eventually moves away. Jack decides to track her down and meets Rad, a petty criminal and they steal a car. They crash, causing the car to turn over and Rad runs off into the bush leaving Jack to his doom. Nelson hears Jack's cries for help and goes to assist. Jack is pulled free but a massive bushfire is caused, leaving Nelson with severe burns and causes a number of residents to lose their homes. Jack becomes a pariah and tries to make amends. Jack soon falls for his foster sister Sally and the two become very close, but Michael is against the relationship and imposes sanctions on it. Eventually, the couple split. During a massive rainstorm, the town becomes flooded and Jack and Michael go to look for Sam Marshall (Ryan Clark) who is late home. Sam falls into a stream and Jack acts to save him, Michael then dives and Jack tries to save Michael but he is pulled away downstream by the strong current and drowns as a result. The family is left devastated and Jack and Sam blame themselves. After a visit from a careers officer to Summer Bay High, Jack decides to enlist in the navy and promptly leaves town after saying goodbye. Pippa attends his induction parade and takes a photo which remains on the mantle for many years. Jack returns to Summer Bay on the eve of Sally's wedding to Kieran and stays at the Caravan Park with several other family members who have returned for the event. Jack reminisces about old times and the trouble he caused Michael and Pippa. He also mentions he has found religion while in the navy. After the wedding is cancelled due to Kieran’s infidelity, Jack and the family console a distraught Sally. Before Jack leaves he has a flashback to the night of Michael's death and tells Pippa he tried holding onto Michael and she consoles him with a hug. Reception For his portrayal of Jack, Amalm received a nomination for \\"Most Popular New Talent\\" at the 1995 Logie Awards. British broadcaster ITV cut scenes of Jack being locked in the boot of a car as a joke from episodes. While acceptable to air in Australia, the scenes were deemed too explicit for British audiences. Sue Williams of the Sun Herald said that Amalm was Home and Away's \\"young male heart-throb.\\" While a columnist from The Courier-Mail branded Jack as a \\"troubled teen\\". Ian Hyland from the Sunday Mirror said that Jack was the serial's \\"rebel rouser\\". Debra Lawrence told TV Week that Jack was one of her favourite characters from Home and Away. She opined that Amalm's work was \\"amazing.\\" A columnist for Inside Soap said that Jack was a \\"easily-led sulky trouble-maker about to join the navy\\". While their colleague said that Jack's life seemed to be coming together after his mother was introduced. They opined that Jack acted \\"cocky\\" about the situation. As \\"nothing has ever been simple in Jack's life\\"; it did not work out for the best. They were unsure if \\"poor Jack\\" would ever trust anyone again and said that knowing Jack, \\"he'll lash out at the people closest to him\\". A reporter from The Gold Coast Bulletin said that \\"Jack Wilson was the dumb but streetwise kid who breezed into Summer Bay in 1994 and propelled actor Daniel Amalm to pin-up status.\\" Scott Ellis of The Sun-Herald said that Amalm made Jack one of Australia's \\"best-loved bad boys\\". The episode featuring the Summer Bay bushfire caused by Jack was nominated for the Avid Technology Award for \\"Best Episode in a Television Drama Serial\\" at the 1996 Australian Film Institute Awards.

It may also be referred to as a ceremonial pet or regimental mascot. It differs from a military animal in that it is not employed for use directly in warfare as a weapon or for transport. History The custom of adopting mascots originated from troops bringing a pet to war, adopting one at the place they were stationed at or being presented a pet as a gift. Some regimental mascots, such as those of most British infantry regiments, represent their home counties' history. British Army mascots Regiments of the British Army have long been prone to adopt members of the animal world as their mascots: dogs, goats and ponies are just a few that have graced ceremonial parades. When the custom of having regimental mascots first started is not clear; the earliest record is that of a goat belonging to the Royal Welsh Fusiliers in the 1775 American War of Independence. Some mascots in the British Army are indicative of the recruiting area of a regiment, such as the Derbyshire Ram, Staffordshire Bull Terrier, Irish Wolfhounds and Welsh Goats. British Army mascots are classified as either regimental pets or regimental mascots. The former are unofficial mascots since they are not recognized by the Army, while the latter are official mascots, having been recognized by the Army. Official British Army mascots are entitled to the services of the Royal Army Veterinary Corps, as well as quartering and food at public expense. It costs the Army roughly £40,000 a year for the upkeep of official mascots. There are also mascots whose upkeep are borne by the regiment or unit itself. They are unofficial mascots which are properly referred to as regimental pets. The Army is keen in preserving the distinction between pets kept by the soldiers and official mascots of the regiments. The case for official mascot recognition is presented before the Army Honours and Distinction Committee. By getting an official status, the mascot will receive a regimental number, assume a proper rank, with prospects of promotion and get its fair share of Army rations. There are three rules set down in 1953 that need to be hurdled to get official mascot status. First, the regiment must comply with the welfare guidelines issued by the Army Veterinary Corps to ensure that the mascot is properly fed and housed. Second, the regiment's Commanding Officer must give approval before the case goes to the Army Honours and Distinctions Committee. Third, the Committee will consider whether the mascot is \\"appropriate\\", can take an active part in army life, including ceremonial occasions, and have a symbolic and historic connection with the regiment. A total of seventeen ceremonial pets are kept by eleven Army regiments, but only ten are recognized as official regimental mascots by the Army. It is a privilege jealously guarded by those who have it. So far, the animals that have made the grade of official regimental mascot are the horse, pony, wolfhound, goat, ram and antelope. 1st The Queen's Dragoon Guards 16851959 Tpr Emrys Forlan Jones, a Welsh Mountain Pony * A Welsh Mountain Pony named Emrys. On 26 February 2016, Her Majesty The Queen graciously accepted the recommendation of the Army Honours and Distinctions Committee that 1st The Queen's Dragoon Guards be allowed to keep a mascot. A Welsh Mountain Pony was selected to reflect the Regiment's Welsh heritage. The Mascot's full title is 16851959 Tpr Emrys Forlan Jones. His number embodies the years of formation for the Queen's Bays and King's Dragoon Guards and the year they were amalgamated to form the QDG in 1959. Emrys is a name steeped in Welsh history and mythology. Forlan is the name of the Stud who donated the mascot to the Regiment. Jones is a very common surname in the QDG so is always accompanied by the last three numbers of the soldiers service number. Because of this, Emrys can also be known as Tpr Jones 959. Emrys is Bay coloured as was the tradition of the QDG's antecedent Regiment, The Queen's Bays. The Mascot is accompanied by a handler, known as the 'Farrier Major'. He is identified by a unique rank insignia for the Regiment; four inverted chevrons, an inverted horseshoe and crown. Emrys and the Farrier Major live and train at Robertson Barracks in Norfolk. Royal Scots Dragoon Guards * A drum horse named Talavera The present mascot of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards is named Talavera. He is an official regimental mascot and has his own rank and ration book. His predecessor, named Ramillies, was presented to the Regiment by their Colonel-in-Chief, Her Majesty The Queen at the Royal Windsor Horse Show in 1987 and assumed his duties in 1989. Ramillies was a very large horse, standing over 18 hands high. After participating in the Edinburgh Military Tattoo in August 2002, he was sent to retirement and died in November 2002. Queen's Royal Hussars * A drum horse named Alamein Drum horses are used by British cavalry units in ceremonials as part of their regimental bands. As their name suggests, these horses carry two kettle drums, plus a rider. Because the drums are made of solid silver, a drum horse must be big and powerful to carry this great weight. The drum horse's main role is to stand still on parades. The tradition of the drum horse dates back to the mid-eighteenth century. By command of King George II, the two silver kettle drums captured at sword's point by the King's Own Regiment of Dragoons, later the 3rd The King's Own Hussars, from the French at the Battle of Dettingen in 1743 are to be carried by a drum horse ridden by a Sergeant Kettle Drummer on ceremonial occasions - a custom still observed by the Queen's Royal Hussars which have always had drum horses. They are a very special and central part of the Regiment. They play centre stage during ceremonial occasions as the Drum Horse for the cavalrymen. The present drum horse is officially named Alamein after one of the Regiment's battle honours. He was also given by soldiers of the Regiment the nickname, Dudley which is after the West Midlands town where many of their troops are recruited. Dudley was given to the Regiment in March 2008. The five-year-old Irish Grey gelding was reared at Abergavenny's Triley Fields Equestrian Centre in Monmouthshire. He is still young and wary but is already part of the soldiers' affections even before he has gotten to know everybody. Dudley is fairly massive, around 19 hands high (approximately 190 cm) and has very big hooves. He is kept at the Paderborn Equestrian Centre which is close to the regimental barracks. The predecessor drum horse, named Winston, which was presented by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother died in 2006. A drum horse remains the regimental mascot for life. An earlier Drum Horse mascot named Peninsula, a gray Clydesdale, was also presented by HM The Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother in 1988. The soldier who looks after Dudley is known as Horse's Groom. He is the one responsible for turning Dudley from being just a very large animal into a drum horse. He exercises Dudley by taking him for a couple of walks around the yard as the drum horse gets to be ridden only on parades. The Horse's Groom assists the rider with tacking up and getting the horse ready for parades. The drum horse has an unusual steering mechanism. Normally, horses' reins are steered with the hands. Drum horses' reins are steered with a rider's feet. The Parachute Regiment * Two Shetland Ponies named Pegasus and Falkland The first pony mascot within The Parachute Regiment dates back to 1950 when Lt. Ben C. Arkle presented the 1st Battalion with a Black New Forest pony called Pegasus I. The 2nd Battalion were next to have a mascot when they purchased a black gelding in 1954 which was called Bruneval I. In August 1954, the 3rd Battalion also purchased their mascot, a White Welsh pony stallion and called him Coed Coch Samswn. The three pony mascots were to parade together for the first time on 15 April 1955 during a visit by His Royal Highness The Duke of Edinburgh to Rushmoor Arena. It was only in June 1955, after a request by the Regimental Council to the War Office, that permission was granted to the regiment to have pony mascots. At the conference of Commanding Officers on 11 November 1965, it was agreed that the battalions should no longer have their own pony mascots. The main reasons were the rising costs of looking after them, finding suitable accommodation and handlers. It was also impractical for the mascots to accompany battalions overseas as they moved by air. The decision was endorsed by the Regimental Council on 12 November 1965. All battalion mascots had found new homes outside the Regiment by 1966. Pegasus I of I Para and Coed Cock Samswn of III Para were taken by the East Riding branch of the Parachute Regimental Association (PRA). Bruneval II was sold to the Juniors Leaders Regiment RCT Taunton. Pte. Ringway, a Skewbald Miniature Shetland Stallion then became the official Regimental Mascot. He was presented to the Regiment by the PRA in 1962 and was looked after by the Junior Parachute Company at Depot PARA, except when it was required with a battalion abroad. He progressed through the ranks. Following a successful performance at the Allied Forces Parade in 1975, while in Berlin with 1 PARA, he was promoted to Sergeant. The German Press and National TV were invited to the barracks to see him march into the Sergeants Mess by the Band and Drums and given his new Sergeants coat by the Commanding Officer. On being taken into the Mess, the Regimental Sgt. Major read him the Mess rules. The Mayor of Spandau sent him his congratulations and a bag of carrots, while an elderly lady sent twenty Deutschmarks to buy food. He died while still with 1 PARA in Berlin in 1975. Obituary notices were placed in the Times and Telegraph newspapers. After the death of Sgt. Ringway, records from the Airborne Assault Archive tend to show that there was some discussion whether the Regiment should continue to have a mascot. However, in February 1977, Sgt. Tex Banwell presented the regiment a Shetland pony which was named Pegasus II (or Peggy to the soldiers). He was flown out to Berlin on a Hercules to join 2 PARA. During the Queen's Birthday Parade in 1977, he collapsed from sun stroke but recovered. He was promoted to Lance Corporal in 1978 after being inspected by the Colonel-in-Chief, the Prince of Wales. In 1979, he was destroyed following a leg injury. On 5 May 1980, the next Shetland pony mascot, Pte. Pegasus III, was donated to the Regiment by Mr. Peter Heims as a replacement to Lance Corporal Pegasus II. Pte. Pegasus III came to the Regiment aged 5 years old, having been rescued from a life of neglect and mistreatment. On 13 May 1980, he was inspected on parade by the Colonel-in-Chief. Following his steadiness on parade on Airborne Forces Day in 1980 and participation in the parade of the Royal Wedding, he was promoted in July 1981 to Lance Corporal. This was followed by promotions to Corporal in March 1983 and Sergeant in January 1990. Not all public duties went according to plan. During an appearance in 1991 at the Savoy Hotel, he fell asleep while on public duty. Then on the occasion of the Queen Mother's Birthday Parade, he attended a call of nature while on parade. In July 1985, because of concerns over the health of Sgt. Pegasus III, it was decided to acquire a second pony as a stable companion, to be trained ready to take over. The new pony, a three-year-old brown Shetland pony named Dodger, was presented to the Regiment by Mrs. Mary Dipley of Stroud, Kent in July 1986. In his younger years Dodger was described as having a \\"frisky temperament\\" that frustrated the efforts of the Pony Major to train him for ceremonial duties. On the 50th Anniversary of the Parachute Regiment in July 1992, Dodger was renamed \\"Falkland\\", as tradition only allows the use of a battle honour as a name ten years after the event. Meanwhile, the health of Sgt. Pegasus III recovered and he was soon on parade for the Paras. Sgt. Pegasus also participated in the wedding ceremony of Sgt. Soane, his Pony Major, in 1990. In November 2001, the mascots were moved from Aldershot to Colchester to co-locate with the new RHQ and the Regimental Band. The present mascots are Lance Corporal Pegasus IV and Falkland I. The predecessor mascot, Sgt Pegasus III, retired in November 1998 while one of the present mascots, Falkland I is retiring soon. He is still fit and well but the Regiment has decided that it is time for him to end his military service since he will be 26 years old in January 2009. Falkland was offered a retirement home by Rosie Gibson (who was formally married to CO 1 Para Brig Paul Gibson) at Shetland Pony Club in Cobham Surrey. Still healthy in 2015 he is popular with child visitors and took part in the 30th anniversary of the Falklands War parade where he led the veterans, led by the son of former Co 1 Para Dick Trigger. Falkland was also the guest of honour at the 2014 Remembrance Calvacade in Albury Surrey to remember the War Horses lost in WW1. Falkland also attends community fetes raising money for Combat Stress. The Regiment is now looking for a black Shetland pony, preferably a gelding, and under 6 years old, as replacement for Falkland I. They are looking for the right type of pony. The new Shetland mascot needs to be placid and good at marching up and down. It also needs to be capable of standing still for prolonged periods of time. And it must be good with children and the public since they get so much attention. The pony mascots are extremely well cared for and have a home for life. The pony mascots travel round the country (United Kingdom), leading parades and marching in front of veterans and the Regiment. They also travel to local shows to greet their public and even as far as France and the Netherlands each year for the military anniversaries. In winter, it is quieter for the ponies, but they are regularly exercised and lunged. The Royal Regiment of Scotland * 2 Shetland Ponies named Cruachan and Islay There have been three Shetland pony mascots in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, all called Cruachan (IV). The pony and his mate are looked after by a \\"Pony Major\\" whose duties include their welfare and leading Cruachan during his many appearances at Highland games, fairs, military parades and annual Edinburgh Tattoo. The first, Cruachan I (1929 - 1939), formally became the Regimental Mascot in 1929 when he was presented to the 1st Battalion, The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders by Her Royal Highness Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll. The third Cruachan retired in 2012 and will be replaced by the fourth. After the Scottish regiments merged to become constituent battalions of the Royal Regiment of Scotland, Cruachan was adopted as the regimental mascot. The current mascot is Cruachan IV. In July 1928, HRH Princess Louise, Colonel-in- Chief of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, visited the 1st Battalion at Shorncliffe. Before leaving, Her Royal Highness intimated that she wants to make some presentation to the Battalion to mark her visit and asked what the Officers and Men would like. It was suggested that if she presented the Battalion with a mascot, such as a Shetland pony, they would constantly be reminded of their Colonel-in-Chief. Princess Louise was delighted with the suggestion, and a few days after her return to London, she wrote saying that she had already seen the Shetland pony which she will propose to give to the Battalion. The Shetland was the smallest pony in Lady Hunloke's herd and because of this was known as \\"Tom Thumb\\". In accepting the gift, it was suggested that the Battalion rename the pony with a more imposing name. With Lady Hunloke's approval, the Battalion named him Cruachan after Ben Cruachan, an iconic mountain in the regiment's namesake lieutenancy of Argyll and Bute. Rather appropriately it was also the battle cry of the Clan Campbell, of which the Duke of Argyll was Chief. Cruachan I was led by a drummer boy during parades, as it was some years before a Pony Major was appointed. Cruachan's spirit was well known to the soldiers of the Battalion. He was able to do a number of tricks on request, such as standing on an upturned bucket to \\"give a paw\\", if offered sugar and rearing up on his hind legs. However, his playfulness also extended to kicking unwary passers-by and escaping from his stable. Occasionally, he could be seen running around camp with a number of soldiers in pursuit. Cruachan I was regimental mascot until he retired in 1939 when the Battalion went on active service in Palestine. He was put out to grass at a farm near Oxford, where he died on 11 April 1942 at the age of 17. The next regimental mascot was Cruachan II (1952 - 1979), whose full name was Cruachan of Braes of Greenock. He was a dark-brown Shetland pony, standing 9 hands high. He was born on 14 April 1950. His sire was Bergastor of Transy (1360) and his dam was Pamina OF Transy (4667). He was bred by the wife of Lt. Colonel Roger G. Hyde, an officer in the Regiment, at the Braes of Greenock in Callander. Cruachan II was presented to the regiment by Mrs. Roger G. Hyde on 17 August 1952 at Princes Street Station in Edinburgh when the 1st Battalion returned to the United Kingdom from service in Hong Kong and Korea. His first parade was eight days later when he led the Battalion down Princes Street. Enormous crowds lined the streets to watch the parade, and although it was his first appearance, Cruachan was very well behaved. He immediately caught the imagination of the public and was always in demand for events such as the Edinburgh Military Tattoo and the Horse of the Year Show. Cruachan became infamous for his stubborn temperament and fondness for beer, particularly Guinness. He bit the glove of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II who was inspecting the Argylls on parade; the Queen who was very fond of horses went over to pat him and he bit the flowers she was holding. On more than one occasion he was \\"punished\\" for drunk behaviour while on duty by being locked up in the stables with his pony major. Cruachan II held the rank of Lance Corporal. He retired from active duty to a farm in Oxfordshire in 1979 after serving the regiment for 27 years and died at age thirty-five on 2 September 1985. The last regimental mascot of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders as an independent regiment was Cruachan III who was presented to the regiment in October 1995 when he was six years old. Cruachan was purchased by private subscription of the serving soldiers and officers of the regiment. He is a black Shetland pony stallion, standing 9.1 hands high and comes from the Regimental area, Alloa. His sire was Harviestown Phyllapine (3003), a Reserve Champion at the Highland Show, and his dam was Harviestown Sylemma (13874). On ceremonial occasions, Cruachan is dressed in a green tartan saddlecloth which is bordered with yellow and embroidered on both sides with the Royal Regiment of Scotland badge and cipher in gold and silver thread. On the saddlecloth is a stripe of a Lance Corporal and five medals: Northern Ireland, Iraq, Bosnia, The Queen's Jubilee and an Accumulative Service Medal. He wears an in-hand bridle with a red and white diced headband and a snaffle bit, and over his saddlecloth, he wears a black leather roller and crupper. His first public appearance was in a parade with the 1st Battalion on Balaklava Day at a Drumhead Service held on the Battalion Square before the Director of Infantry on 25 October 1995. On 2 July 2011, Her Majesty The Queen accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh presented the new colours of six of the seven battalions of the Royal Regiment of Scotland in Holyrood Park in Edinburgh. On this historic day during the Presentation of the Colours Parade, Cruachan III marched in front of all six battalions of the Regiment Cruachan III was promoted to Lance Corporal from Private in 2001. He was reclassified as a battalion mascot in 2006 as the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders was amalgamated with five other Scottish regiments to form the Royal Regiment of Scotland. The Argylls became the 5th Battalion of this new large regiment on 28 March 2006. Cruachan was reinstated as a regimental mascot when he was adopted as mascot of the Royal Regiment of Scotland in 2009. He used to live near Sterling, Scotland with a stable companion Shetland pony named Islay. They now live in Redford Barracks, Edinburgh, Scotland. In 2011, he celebrated his 22nd birthday. He made his final public appearance at the 2012 Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo and retired. The Royal Irish Regiment * An Irish Wolfhound named Brian Boru In 1970, an Irish Wolfhound, named Brian Boru I, was presented as mascot by a Major Hayes, an officer in the Royal Irish Rangers, on his retirement. Brian Boru became the mascot of the Royal Irish Regiment when it was formed in 1992 with the amalgamation of the Royal Irish Rangers and the Ulster Defence Regiment. The name Brian Boru was to be used for all succeeding mascots, with just the addition of a Roman numeral to denote succession. The present mascot is Brian Boru IX whose wolfhound name is Finn. He was recruited in April 2011 when he was a twelve-week-old puppy. He was born on 8 January 2011 when the Regiment was in theatre in Afghanistan. His predecessor, Brian Boru VIII also called by his wolfhound name, Merlin, died of a heart attack on 16 December 2010 at age 6. The regimental mascot is based in Tern Hill near Market Drayton. Irish Guards Mascot Irish Wolfhound * An Irish Wolfhound named Domhnall The Regimental Mascot is an Irish Wolfhound. The first mascot was presented to the Irish Guards in 1902 by the members of the Irish Wolfhound Club, who hoped the publicity would increase the breed's popularity with the public. It was named Brian Boru, after one of Ireland's legendary chieftains and given the nickname Paddy. There have been 14 more since, all named after Irish High Kings or legendary chieftains. The mascot is a firm favourite of both the Regiment and the public. It leads the battalion on all major parades. The present regimental mascot is named Conmael. He made his debut at the Trooping the Colour on 13 June 2009. The predecessor mascot, Fergal, was killed in an automobile accident while being exercised away from the barracks in 2007. On 26 July 1961, the wolfhound mascot was admitted to the select group of official Army mascots entitling him to the services of the Royal Army Veterinary Corps, as well as quartering and food at public expense. Originally, the mascot was in the care of a drummer boy, but is now looked after by one of the regiment's drummers and his family. However, new mascots spend their first six months at the home of the Regimental Adjutant so they can be gradually introduced to regimental life. The Irish Guards are the only Guards regiment permitted to have their mascot lead them on parade. During the Trooping the Colour, however, the mascot marches only from the Royal Artillery Barracks to as far as Horse Guards Parade. He then falls out and does not participate in the trooping itself. The mascot has never been dressed up on parades but there are certain occasions that the wearing of a cape is acceptable. In principle, it is intended that the red linen cape should only be worn by the mascot on State or special occasions. It is worn when tunics are worn and the Drum Major is wearing State Dress. It may also be worn on special occasions as directed by the 1st Battalion Adjutant or the Regimental Adjutant. When greatcoats are worn and the Drum Major wears State Dress, the mascot wears a blue-grey cape. However, the overriding influence is the weather because the animal is never allowed to be distressed by the heat on parade. The mascots of the Irish Guards from 1902 to present are Brian Boru (1902–1910), Leitrim Boy (1910–1917), Doran (1917–1924), Cruachan (1924–1929), Pat (1951–1953), Shaun (1960–1967), Fionn (1967–1976), Cormac (1976–1985), Connor (1985–1992), Malachy (1992–1994), Cuchulain (1995–2000) Aengus (2000–2003), Donnchadh (2003–2005), Fergal (2006–2007) Conmael, (2009–2012) and Domhnall (2013–present). The Royal Welsh The goat mascot and Goat Major of the Royal Regiment of Wales, 1999. * Three Kashmir goats * 1st Battalion (formerly The Royal Welsh Fusiliers) – goat named Billy The tradition of goat mascots in the military dates from at least 1775. During the American War of Independence in 1775 a wild goat wandered onto a battlefield in Boston, and ended up leading the Welsh regimental Colours off the battlefield at the end of the Battle of Bunker Hill. Since then a goat has served with the Battalion. In 1884, Queen Victoria presented the regiment, then called the Royal Welch Fusiliers, with a Kashmir goat from her royal herd, and a tradition was started. The British Monarchy has presented an unbroken series of Kashmir goats to the Royal Welch Fusiliers from the Crown's own royal herd. The royal goat herd was originally obtained from Mohammad Shah Qajar, Shah of Persia from 1834 to 1848, when he presented them to Queen Victoria as a gift in 1837 upon her accession to the throne. All the goats are called William (anglicised version of Gwylim) Windsor, or Billy for short. Their primary duty is to march at the head of the battalion on all ceremonial event. The present goat mascot, Fusilier William Windsor, was chosen from a herd of goats living on the Great Orme in Llandudno on 13 June 2009. After his selection, months of work followed to get him used to his fellow soldiers and to make him learn what is expected of him. As the goat progressed, he was taught to get used to sounds and noises coming from marching soldiers. The predecessor mascot, Lance Corporal William Windsor, a Kashmir goat from the royal herd at Whipsnade Zoo in Bedfordshire, was presented to the Regiment by Queen Elizabeth II in 2001. Following eight years of distinguished military service, he retired on 20 May 2009 due to his age. As he left Dale Barracks, Chester for the last time, hundreds of soldiers from the Battalion lined the route from his pen to the trailer to say farewell and thank you for his many years of good service. He was led into the trailer by the battalion's Goat Major in full ceremonial dress that included a silver headdress which was a gift from the Queen in 1955. He was taken to Whipsnade Zoo where he is spending his honourable retirement. The goat is more than a mascot; it is a full member of the battalion and in the days gone by, when it was a 1,000-strong unit, it was 999 men plus the goat. As a soldier, the goat can move up the ranks. It starts as a fusilier and if it is well behaved and does well on parades, quite often it is promoted to lance corporal, a non- commissioned officer rank. As a full member of the battalion, he is accorded the full status and privileges of the rank. There are perks to the job of regimental mascot. Billy gets a two-a-day cigarette ration (he eats them, as traditionally, the tobacco is thought to be good for the goat) and Guinness to drink when he is older \\"to keep the iron up\\". * 2nd Battalion (formerly The Royal Regiment of Wales) – Goat named Taffy The Regimental goat mascot was first mentioned in 1775. It was officially known as \\"His Majesty's Goat\\". During the Crimean War in 1855, the story goes that on one particularly cold night, a Private Gwilym Jenkins was on sentry duty. To keep himself warm, he placed a kid goat inside his greatcoat. However, Jenkins fell asleep. Fortunately, goats have very good hearing and the kid goat bleated when it heard movements of the enemy. Pte Jenkins was awakened by the agitated bleating of the kid goat and espied an advancing Russian patrol. He was able to warn the forward picket and the enemy was driven off. From then on, every time the 41st (Welsh) Regiment of Foot, a predecessor of the Royal Regiment of Wales, went into battle, a goat led the way as good luck. After the Crimean War, a review at Aldershot on 29 July 1856 by Her Majesty, Queen Victoria, of regiments that had returned from the Crimea was held. One of the regiments present was the 41st (Welsh) Regiment of Foot, which brought along their Russian goat mascot. On that occasion, the Queen learned of the goat mascot tradition of the Regiment, to which she promised that upon the death of the present mascot, she will replace it with one from the Royal Herd in Great Windsor Park. In 1862, the first official goat from the royal herd at Windsor was presented to the Regiment and a tradition was started. The goat is officially recorded on the battalion ration roll as Gwylim Jenkins, but he is called by his nickname, Taffy. He is also officially recorded as the regimental goat. The present battalion mascot is Taffy V who holds the rank of Lance Corporal. He lives in Lucknow Barracks in Tidworth, Wiltshire. Replacements for the goat mascot are traditionally selected from the royal herd kept at Whipsnade Zoo in Bedfordshire and are always named Taffy plus a Roman numeral to show succession. The soldier who looks after the goat is known as the Goat Major, who actually has the rank of a Corporal. * 3rd Battalion (formerly The Royal Welsh Regiment) – Goat named Shenkin The present battalion mascot is a Kashmir white goat, named Shenkin III, which was selected from the Queen's own herd of Royal Windsor Whites, on the Great Orme in Llandudno, North Wales on 8 September 2009. He is a direct descendant of the original mascot given to the 3rd Royal Welsh Regiment by Queen Victoria after the Crimean War. Shenkin III is residing at the Maindy Barracks in Cardiff. The predecessor goat mascot, Lance Corporal Shenkin II, died of old age at the Maindy Barracks on 14 July 2009. He has been the battalion mascot since September 1997. The Queen sent her private condolences following Shenkin's death and Buckingham Palace gave permission for the regiment to pick out a successor. Plans were also discussed for a memorial at Maindy Barracks. LCpl Shenkin II first began service at age 18 months and served for the next 12 years. During his long service, Shenkin II met the Queen, visited Prince Charles' Gloucestershire home, Highgrove, and had been to 10 Downing Street where he was tethered in the rear garden. He replaced Shenkin I, who died on the same day that Princess Diana died. The name Shenkin is the Welsh pronunciation of Jenkins. The first Shenkin was named Sospan before 1994. During the Zulu War, the first known and adopted mascot name was Gwilym Jenkins. It was named by the Royal Welsh Fusilliers for rationing purposes. Because putting a 'GOAT' down for rations would not happen, the name Gwilym was given to the goat in order to obtain his rations. Brecon war museum in South Wales records \\"Gwilyn Jenkins one Bail of Hay\\". The Mercian Regiment * A Swaledale Ram named Private Derby as celebrated in the song \\"The Derby Ram\\" Private Derby, a Swaledale ram, is the official mascot of the Mercian Regiment. He was the mascot of the Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment which inherited Private Derby from a predecessor regiment, the Sherwood Foresters and which in turn inherited him from The 95th Derbyshire Regiment. Private Derby became the mascot of the Mercian Regiment when it was formed on 1 September 2007 with the amalgamation of the Worchestershire and Sherwood Foresters with the Staffordshire and Cheshire regiments. The ram mascot is a central part of the Regiment's history and tradition and its association with the home counties of its predecessor regiments. It is a symbol of pride for the Regiment and is extremely popular with the public when it makes appearances. The first Private Derby was adopted as a mascot in 1858 by the 95th (Derbyshire) Regiment of Foot at the siege and capture of Kotah during the Indian Mutiny Campaign (1857–58). The Commanding Officer whilst on one of his forays within the town, noticed a fine fighting ram tethered in a temple yard. He directed Private Sullivan of the Number 1 Company to take the ram into his possession. The ram was named Private Derby and has marched nearly 3,000 miles with the soldiers of the Regiment through central India before it died in 1863. Since then, there has followed a succession of fine rams, each of which has inherited the official title of Private Derby followed by his succession number. The earlier replacement rams were acquired by the Regiment from whichever part of the world they were serving in at the time. However, since 1912 it has become the tradition for the Duke of Devonshire to select a Swaledale Ram from his Chatsworth Park flock and present it to the Regiment. It is a tradition the Duke is proud to hold, in recognition of the close association between the Regiment and the Dukes of Devonshire, whose ancestral seat is in the county of Derbyshire. However, there was a temporary departure from tradition in 1924 when the successor ram, Derby XIV, was presented to the Regiment instead by His Highness Sir Umeo Singh Bahador GCB GLSI GCIE The Mohorac of Kotah. The Army recognizes each Private Derby as a soldier and has his own regimental number and documentation. He has been held on the official strength of the Regiment since the first Private Derby. He is paid 3.75 pounds per day. In addition, he is also on the ration strength and draws his own rations like any other soldier. Private Derby even has a leave card and takes an annual holiday at Chatsworth during the mating season. He may even get a promotion if he behaves. The only record of a medal being presented to a Regimental Mascot was when Private Derby I of the 95th (Derbyshire) Regiment was awarded the Indian Service Medal with a clasp 'Central India' together with the rest of the Battalion on parade at Poona in 1862. He also fought 33 battles against other rams and was undefeated. When on parade, Private Derby wears a coat of scarlet with Lincoln green and gold facings, the whole emblazoned with the Regiment's main Battle Honours. Also on his coat is to be found a replica of his India Mutiny Medal. In addition, he now wears the General Service Medal 1962 with the clasp Northern Ireland as he has been stationed there several times over the years. On his forehead is to be found a silver plate suitably embossed with the Regimental Cap Badge. A pair of silver protectors are fitted on the tips of his horns to protect the clothing of persons near him such as his handlers and visitors, of which he receives a great number each time he appears in public. Private Derby has two handlers from the Drums Platoon whose duty is to look after him at all times. The senior handler is called the \\"Ram Major\\" whilst the other one is the \\"Ram Orderly\\". They escort Private Derby when he is on parade by standing, one on each side of the goat and leading or controlling him with two white ornamental ropes that are attached to a leather collar. It is the responsibility of the Ram Major to prepare Private Derby for all parades and the other appearances which he makes. The predecessor ram, Private Derby XXVIII, died on 10 September 2008 of unknown cause at age four. He died in his residence at the barracks in Chilwell, Nottingham. He started his military service as a mascot in 2005. Private Derby, one of only nine mascots recognized by the Army, represented the Regiment on ceremonial duties for the past three years. The year that he died was the 150th anniversary of the ram mascot. The present mascot, Derby XXIX, was selected by the Duke of Devonshire from his Chatsworth Park estate in Derbyshire in September 2008 and was formally handed over to the Regiment during a ceremony at Chatsworth House on 15 January 2009. The head shepherd at Chatsworth House handed over the new Pte Derby to the regimental secretary of the Mercian Regiment. He is now residing at Chetwynd Barracks, Chilwell, Nottinghamshire. He is an excellent ram, both big and strong albeit with a pleasant nature and most importantly, handles well on parade. He was promoted to Lance Corporal during a Crimean War commemoration ceremony at the Nottingham Castle in April 2011. The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers * An Indian Black Buck Antelope named Bobby The tradition of antelope mascots dates back 140 years, when the Royal Warwickshire Regiment, a predecessor regiment, adopted a live antelope as mascot when it was stationed in India in 1871. It was an Indian black buck antelope named Billy which was also the name given to its successors for many years. Subsequently, the names Charlie and Bobby have also been used. The custom stems from the Royal Warwickshire Regiment's 'ancient badge' of an Antelope, authorised to be displayed on colours and appointments in 1747, but traditionally held to date from the regiment's service in Spain during the War of the Spanish Succession. When the four fusilier regiments merged to form the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, the antelope was adopted as the mascot of the new regiment. The second Billy was presented to the 1st Battalion, The Royal Warwickshire Regiment about the time of the Delhi Durbar of 1877 by a well- known Maharajah. It came home with the battalion in 1880 and died in Ireland in 1888. There were two sources of supply of these animals, the battalion serving in India usually received them as gifts from the Maharajahs, while the home battalion was given theirs by the London Zoo. In 1963, the Royal Warwickshire Regiment was converted to a fusilier regiment. Then on 23 April 1968 the Royal Warwickshire Fusiliers was amalgamated with three other fusilier regiments to form the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, where the tradition of antelope mascot was carried on. Two men are chosen from amongst the battalion drummers to be in charge of the antelope, a Buck Leader and an Assistant Buck Leader. When on parade, these two men held white cords attached to the buck's white collar which had a large silver badge on it. On the antelope's back was a coat of royal blue on which was emblazoned the regimental badge. The horns were tipped with silver cones. Though amenable to discipline, the antelopes have been known to have a mind of their own. At a military review in Aldershot, the then mascot, Bobby II, chose to lay down as he was being led past King George V and proceeded to nibble the grass, thus halting the parade. On another occasion, the drum-major made the mistake of walking in front of the mascot at a Tattoo performance, and paid for his error with a sore behind and ripped trousers. Bobby III who was a corporal proved to be more cunning. On a church parade at Tidworth, he developed a limp. At first, he would be removed from the parade and returned to his pen where he would quickly recover. After three Sundays of limping and quick recovery, it was decided to ignore him and press on. After a quarter of a mile, the limp stopped and never re-occurred. One of the antelope mascots in the long line of successors all named Bobby was recognized at the Tower of London on 24 June 1997 with a Long Service and Good Conduct Medal for fifteen years of loyal service to the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers. This Bobby was born at the London Zoo in 1982 and joined the regiment at the age of one month. Normal life expectancy for antelopes is about nine years but Bobby has butted his way to fifteen. He was promoted corporal on his 13th birthday. He normally lives in Coventry with one of the Fusiliers' Territorial Army battalions but came to London for the presentation outside the Fusiliers' regimental headquarters in the Tower. The antelope mascot in the year 2000 also named Bobby was sent to the Tower of London, the Fusiliers' regimental headquarters when the 2nd Battalion went on a tour of Germany. His stay there was extended when foot- and-mouth disease restrictions prevented him from returning to the 2nd Battalion's barracks. He was due to return to the Battalion's barracks in April 2001 but stayed in the Tower of London for 15 months. The present mascot is named Bobby and holds the rank of Corporal. He attends all major parades held by the Regiment. He lives with the 2nd Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers in St. George Barracks, North Luffenham, Ruthland in Leicestershire. His pen is a converted tennis court with plenty of grass to graze. His regular diet is horse nuts and is partial to biscuits. He likes hour-long walks. 3rd Battalion The Mercian Regiment (Staffords) * A Staffordshire Bull Terrier named Watchman Watchman on parade in Tamworth, Staffordshire, as part of the 2015 Remembrance Day events. The mascot tradition in the regiments of Staffordshire stretches back to the 19th Century. In 1882, the South Staffordshire Regiment was ordered to march with Lord Wolseley to relieve General Gordon who was besieged in Khartoum. They entrained at Cairo with their Staffordshire Bull Terrier named Boxer. Startled by the sudden noise of the train's engine when it departed, Boxer leapt from the moving train and was seen lying, either unconscious or dead, at the side of the railroad tracks. A few days later, when the Regiment encamped at Assiut awaiting orders for the final phase of their march, a very thin and bedraggled dog staggered into their camp and collapsed. It was Boxer, who like a true soldier, walked for over 200 miles along the railway tracks in the scorching desert to rejoin his regiment. This feat marked the start of the tradition of having a Bull Terrier as a regimental mascot. In 1949, after years of being the best battalion in recruitment of new soldiers in the Territorial Army, the 6th Battalion North Staffordshire Regiment was presented with a pure white Staffordshire Bull Terrier. The Battalion adopted the bull terrier as their mascot and named it Watchman I. On 25 May 1949, the 6th North Staffords sent a Company-size group (some 120 men) along with its mascot and Corps of Drums and Fifes to the Royal Tournament, which was held that year in Olympia. Watchman I showed little interest in the occasion until the Band and Drums struck up. At which point, he raised his head and marched proudly to the thunderous applause of an appreciative audience which had immediately taken him to their heart. Over the next decade, Watchman I participated in every parade the Battalion took part. He was presented to Her Majesty The Queen on her visit to Burton-on-Trent on 28 March 1957. Watchman I died in 1959 and was laid to rest in the lawn opposite the Town Hall in King Edward Place in Burton-upon-Trent. Such was the tradition, interest and good feeling of the people of Burton towards this most popular mascot that in September 1960 Watchman II was presented to the Battalion by the town at a civic parade. Like his predecessor, he was to march at the head of the Battalion throughout the next six years of his life. He was presented to Her Majesty The Queen on the occasion of the Presentation of New Colours to the 6th North Staffords at Molineaux in the early 1960s. His last parade was the Honorary Colonels Parade held at St Martins Camp in 1966. The following year the County TA Regiments were reformed and Watchman II went into retirement until his death in 1974, at the age of fourteen. He was laid to rest alongside his predecessor Watchman I. The tradition started up again in 1988 in the 3rd (V) Battalion The Staffordshire Regiment. It was felt that the time-honoured tradition of having a mascot should continue. Consequently, a search was made to find a dog with a suitable pedigree and bearing to do justice to the Battalion and County. As an indication of the depth of feeling within the County for the mascot, the people of Burton presented the Battalion with Watchman III in 1988. He reached the rank of sergeant and served until his death in 1998. He was interred alongside his two predecessors. In 2006, special memorials were unveiled in the town for the three former mascots. The successor mascot, Watchman IV, was presented to the Staffordshire Regiment as a puppy in August 1998 by the Friends of the Regiment. He has been the mascot since 1999 and has reached the rank of Colour Sergeant, which is equal in status to his handler. Watchman IV not only paraded with the Staffordshire Regiment but also with the newly formed West Midlands Regiment. He has appeared at remembrance day parades in London and once at a remembrance service outside Westminster Abbey where he met the Queen. He again met the Queen when Stafford celebrated its 800th anniversary in 2006. He participated in the Tercentenary Celebration in 2005. Watchman attracts attention such as when his handler took him for a walk through the streets of London. A coach full of tourists pulled up and leapt off the vehicle to photograph him. Watchman IV was carried forward when the Battalion joined the Mercian Regiment on 1 September 2007 and became the mascot of the 3rd Battalion The Mercian Regiment. He retired on 4 October 2009 after 10 years of military service. He was replaced by a young Staffordshire Bull Terrier named Watchman V, in a ceremony at the battalion's museum in Whittington on 5 October 2010. The present mascot is linked to 4 Mercian (V) and the Staffordshire Regimental Association, but lives at the home of the soldier who looks after him. He was made a Lance Corporal at a ceremony at the National Brewery Museum in Burton- upon-Trent on 8 September 2011. He was promoted to Corporal at the Staffordshire Regiment Museum in 2013. He was promoted to Sergeant in 2015, forming a central part of Tamworth's St George's Day celebrations in the grounds of Tamworth Castle. Watchman is classified as a regimental pet as he is not recognised by the Army. Since he is an unofficial battalion mascot, his upkeep is paid for by the Staffordshire Regimental Association, not by the government. Following the removal of 3rd Battalion (the Stafford's) from the Mercian Regiment, Watchman now marches with the Staffordshire Regimental Association. 1st Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment (Prince of Wales's Own) * Two Ferrets named Imphal and Quebec The locals presented two ferrets to the 1st Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment when it was on duty in Northern Ireland. They were adopted as regimental pets and named after the battalion's battle honours, Imphal and Quebec. These ferrets are classified as regimental pets since they are not recognized by the Army. They are unofficial battalion mascots. USS Vandegrift FFG-48 Mascot Seaman Jenna was the canine mascot on USS Vandegrift (FFG-48) for five years while the ship was forward deployed to 7th Fleet. Acquired as a rescue dog by the ship after a home port shift in 1998, she was a morale booster for a crew far from home and families. She improved morale every day, bringing a sense of home and making her shipmates feel different than the other sailors in the Navy. She created a bond amongst the crew that still exists today.https://www.facebook.com/SeamanJenna/ United States Marine Corps Mascots PFC Chesty the XIV, the mascot of the United States Marine Corps Since 1922, the United States Marine Corps has used Bulldogs as its mascots.MCRD Museum Historical Society, \\"Bulldog Mascots in the Marine Corps\\", mcrdmuseumhistoricalsociety.org, archived 30 Mar. 2007.

An English bulldog named Legend represents Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island and LCpl. Belleau Wood represents Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego. United States Army Mascots There are several unofficial mascots in the Army, but only three official mascots. Two mules represent West Point. A Borzoi (previously called Russian Wolfhound) represents the 27th Infantry Regiment \\"Wolfhounds\\". The 27th Infantry Regiment based in Schofield Barracks, HI is represented by the Russian Wolfhound. During the Russian Civil War, the 27th Infantry served in the American Expeditionary Force sent to Siberia in 1918. This campaign has become an integral part of unit's history. The tenacious pursuit tactics of the regiment won the respect of the Bolsheviks, who gave them the name \\"Wolfhounds.\\" This emblem continues to serve as the symbol of the 27th Infantry Regiment. Their current mascot is Kolchak XVI. Canadian Army The French-Canadian Royal 22e Régiment (Van Doos), headquartered at the Citadel in Quebec City, has a goat named \\"Batise\\" as its mascot. The Royal Canadian Artillery School has a dog mascot named \\"Gunner Loki\\" at CFB Gagetown in New Brunswick. In the First World War, the Fort Garry Horse were known for having a regimental mascot black bear named Winnie. He was purchased by a soldier on the way to training and, whilst the regiment were in France fighting, lived at the London Zoo. He is known to have become the inspiration for the famous children's character, Winnie-the-Pooh.

Until the first discovery of alkalides in the 1970s, alkali metals were only known to appear in salts only as cations (positive ions) with a charge or oxidation state of +1.Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. \\"Inorganic Chemistry\\" Academic Press: San Diego, 2001. . These types of compounds are of theoretical interest due to their unusual stoichiometry and low ionization potentials. Alkalide compounds are chemically related to the electrides, salts in which trapped electrons are effectively the anions. \\"Normal\\" alkali metal compounds Alkali metals form many well-known stable salts. Sodium chloride (common table salt), Na+Cl−, illustrates the usual role of an alkali metal such as sodium. In the empirical formula for this ionic compound, the positively charged sodium ion is balanced by a negatively charged chloride ion. The traditional explanation for stable Na+ is that the loss of one electron from elemental sodium to produce a cation with charge of +1 produces a stable closed-shell electron configuration. Nomenclature and known cases There are known alkalides for some of the alkali metals: *Sodide or natride, Na− *Potasside or kalide, K− *Rubidide, Rb− *Caeside, Cs− Alkalides of the other alkali metals have not yet been discovered: *\\"Lithides\\", Li− *\\"Francides\\", Fr− Examples Normally, alkalides are thermally labile due to the high reactivity of the alkalide anion, which is theoretically able to break most covalent bonds including the C–O bonds in a typical cryptand. The introduction of a special cryptand ligand containing amines instead of ether linkages has allowed the isolation of kalides and natrides that are stable at room temperature. Several alkalides have been synthesized: *(Me3N-H)+Na−, known as \\"inverse sodium hydride\\", has been observed. *Sodium-crypt natride, [Na(cryptand[2.2.2])]+Na−, has been observed. This salt contains both Na+ and Na−. The cryptand isolates and stabilizes the Na+, preventing it from being reduced by the Na−. *Barium azacryptand-sodide, Ba2+(H5Azacryptand[2.2.2]−)Na−⋅2MeNH2, has been synthesized. *Dimers of cationic and anionic sodium have been observed.

It first contested municipal elections in the capital city of Belmopan on 1 March 2006, receiving 20 percent of votes cast but none of the seven seats. VIP operates primarily in Belmopan, but also has a presence in the Belize and Corozal Districts. Along with the People's National Party, VIP is one of two minor parties which contested both the most recent Belizean general and municipal elections. It has yet to win a seat in the Belize House or a municipal election at the city or town level. In 2015 many VIP members joined the newly-formed Belize Progressive Party, however VIP continues to function as a separate entity.\\"Party Leaders Discuss VIP's Intended Wrench\\", Tropical Vision Limited, 16 October 2015. (accessed 28 October 2015)\\"B.P.P. Will Contest 25 Seats in Upcoming General Elections\\", Great Belize Television, 16 October 2015. (accessed 28 October 2015)  Formation and nomination The VIP introduced itself to residents of Belmopan on Sunday, 4 December 2005 with a manifesto of planned projects they would implement in Belmopan if elected. The slate of candidates presented included the following: * Mayor: Paul Morgan * Councillors: Bobby Lopez, Kamil Espat, Henry Dueck, David Gonzalez, Elvira Brown and Hubert Enriquez. All seven were well known in the Belmopan area and Morgan and Enriquez had previously contested elections there (News 5). Enriquez is officially Secretary General of the Party and Morgan nominal Party Leader. The slate were nominated on 14 February 2006 by returning officer for the city Henry Marsden. In an interview with News 5's Karla Vernon, candidate Morgan said that the nation needed \\"a change\\" and said that a VIP victory in Belmopan would be the \\"seed\\" that would eventually remove \\"corruption\\" in the nation's capital.  Reaction from established parties  Neither established political party were ready to welcome their new opponents. The opposition United Democratic Party (UDP), visualizing an easy win in Belmopan and elsewhere, claimed the VIP would distract Belmopan residents and insinuated they had been supported by the ruling People's United Party (PUP). The PUP for their part felt (but did not say publicly) that the UDP had instigated the VIP to run. The VIP's greatest supporters were the Amandala newspaper and its publisher Evan X Hyde. Amandala wrote a number of editorials and articles in support of the fledgling party, arguing that the PUP and UDP had collectively hijacked local politics for themselves and that third parties needed to step in to at least offer some viable competition. At a January press conference announcing details for the elections, CEO of the Elections and Boundaries Commission Stuart Leslie announced that incumbent slates would be first on the ballot, opposing slates next and then independent candidates. Morgan objected, saying that ballots produced this way would be denying voters the right to elect the Mayor directly and proposed that Mayoral ballots be separated from that of councillors and that the latter be listed alphabetically and not by party color (Amandala). The commission did not accept Morgan's proposal.  The elections and post-election reaction  On March 1, the electorate voted and the VIP did not win any of the seven seats up for election in Belmopan; the UDP won all seven en route to a 64-3 victory. Post-election, analysts congratulated the VIP for their courage in participating and said their lack of success was mostly due to a low budget, inexperience in campaign management, image management and Belmopan voters' apathy (few PUP's came out to vote as a sign of discontent with the Musa administration).  General election preparations  VIP announced in January 2007 that they had selected several candidates for general elections in 2008. Tentative candidates include leader Paul Morgan, Bobby Lopez, Hubert Enriquez, Patrick Rogers, Mateo Polanco and Max Cho. A later addition was Erwin X (Jones) in Port Loyola. Recent activity In recent years VIP has maintained an informal alliance with the People's National Party, with which it shares similar anti-corruption stances.\\"Who Will Be PG's Mayor?\\", Tropical Vision Limited, 2 March 2015.

The highway ends at a junction with the tolled Massachusetts Turnpike in Sturbridge, Massachusetts. The entire route was formerly signed as Route 15. Route description South end of the overlap between Route 15 and US 5. US 5 is signed as an unnumbered exit indicating \\"To I-691, Route 66 Route 15 and U.S. Route 5 The Wilbur Cross Highway begins as a Y-interchange with the Berlin Turnpike in Wethersfield. South of here, Route 15 and U.S. Route 5 (US 5) continue south along the turnpike. The highway proceeds in a northeasterly direction and has an interchange with Route 99 (Old Route 9) before entering Hartford and reaching interchanges with Interstate 91 (I-91) and the Hartford–Brainard Airport access road. The highway then crosses the Connecticut River by way of the Charter Oak Bridge, curving to a more east-west direction, before merging into the median of I-84 in East Hartford. Interstate 84 US 6 is cosigned with I-84 on the Wilbur Cross Highway from exit 57 in East Hartford to exit 60 in Manchester. History The highway was built in the 1940s, before the Interstate Highway era, as a continuation of the Wilbur Cross Parkway, which itself is a continuation of the Merritt Parkway – all of which were once signed Route 15. Originally, the parkways were to span continuously from Greenwich to Union, but with the opening of Interstate 91, the planned segment between Meriden and Hartford was never built, and Route 15 was instead routed along the Berlin Turnpike. In 1958, the highway north of the Charter Oak Bridge was cosigned as I-84, as part of the interstate highway's planned route through Connecticut. In 1968, this designation was moved to a proposed highway from Hartford to Providence, and the then-cosigned portion with Route 15 was renumbered to I-86. The Route 15 designation remained cosigned with I-86 section south of the Massachusetts border until October 1, 1980, when it was truncated to its current northern terminus at exit 57 of I-84. The I-84 designation was restored in 1984 when the planned highway to Providence was cancelled. From 1948 to 1982, US 44 was signed along the highway from current exit 60 to current exit 69. Charter Oak Bridge The Charter Oak Bridge, which carries the highway across the Connecticut River, has been operational since 1942. Due to the bridge's failing condition and the clogging on the nearby Bissell and Founders Bridges in the late 1980s, the Charter Oak Bridge and approach was completely rebuilt in 1991 to its current form.

It was followed by a second rear guard action near the same location on the night of April 5, 1865 and morning of April 6, 1865 during the Union Army pursuit of the Confederate forces (Army of Northern Virginia and Richmond local defense forces) which were fleeing westward after the fall of Petersburg and Richmond, Virginia at the Third Battle of Petersburg (sometimes shown as the Breakthrough at Petersburg) on April 2, 1865. The actions took place just prior to the Battle of Sailor's Creek (sometimes shown as \\"Sayler's Creek\\") on April 6, 1865. That battle would be the last major engagement between the Union Army under the overall direction of Union General-in-Chief, Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, and General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia before that Confederate army's surrender at Appomattox Court House, Virginia on April 9, 1865. On April 5, 1865, Confederate cavalry under the command of Brig. Gen. Martin Gary, reinforced by cavalry from the divisions of Maj. Gen. Thomas L. Rosser and Colonel Thomas T. Munford, which were under the overall command of Maj. Gen. Fitzhugh Lee, counterattacked a brigade of Union cavalry led by Brig. Gen. Henry E. Davies, Jr..Davis, Burke, 1981 ed., p. 231.Longacre, 2000, p. 329. Davies's brigade was part of the division commanded by Maj. Gen. George Crook, which in turn was under the overall command of Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan. Davies's force was returning from a scout during which they burned Confederate wagons in the vicinity of Paineville, Virginia (Paineville area of Amelia County, Virginia), about north of Jetersville, Virginia. The wagons were carrying supplies and equipment for the Army of Northern Virginia. The running fight after the Paineville action started north of Amelia Springs and continued through Amelia Springs almost to Jetersville, Virginia on the South Side Railroad. Jetersville, which was southwest of Amelia Court House, Virginia where Lee's forces were concentrating, had been held by Sheridan's forces since the day before.Davis, 1981, pp. 202–203 The battle was inconclusive in that the Confederate forces had to return to Amelia Springs when Davies's troops were able to join with other Union forces as they approached Jetersville. During the night of April 5, 1865, Union Army divisions under the command of Brig. Gen. Nelson A. Miles and Maj. Gen. Gershom Mott fought a minor and inconclusive action against the Army of Northern Virginia rear guard commanded by Maj. Gen. John B. Gordon near Amelia Springs.Salmon, John S. The Official Virginia Civil War Battlefield Guide. Mechanicsburg, PA: Stackpole Books, 2001. . p. 476. Although casualties for both sides in both engagements have been stated to be light and about even at less than 250 combined, the Union commanders reported suffering 158 casualties. The Confederates presumably suffered fewer than 100.Eicher, 2001, p. 815 says Davies lost 20 men killed and 96 wounded. In addition, Davies's men took over 300 Confederate prisoners in the Paineville action immediately preceding the counterattack which precipitated the running battle through and beyond Amelia Springs almost to Jetersville.Davis, 1981, p. 232 states that Davies took about 1,000 prisoners, five cannons and several hundred thin mules while destroying 180 wagons. This accords with Davies's own brief account of the battle in Davies, 1895, pp. 239-240\\\\. Eicher, 2001, p. 815 says that Davies took 700 prisoners and destroyed 200 wagons, including many of Gen.

Confederate army flight Much of the Army of Northern Virginia as well as Confederate President Jefferson Davis and his cabinet, were able to escape from Petersburg and Richmond just in advance of the Union troops entering those cities on April 3 because Confederate rear guard forces, especially at Forts Gregg and Whitworth, Fort Mahone and Sutherland's Station, fought desperate delaying actions on April 2 to give most of the Confederates a head start on Union Army pursuers.Woodworth, 2004, p. 322.

Pursuit and skirmishes While most of Lee's army had an effective one day head start on their flight, the advance cavalry and infantry corps of the Union Army under the command of Maj. Gen.

Meanwhile, Sheridan's forces occupied Jetersville and Burkeville Junction. Battles of Amelia Springs=First Engagement Lee had hoped to find a supply train at Amelia Court House, Virginia, southwest of Richmond, but when he and his forces arrived there on April 4, 1865, he found that the train contained only ordnance, ammunition, caissons and harnesses. Lee sent out foraging parties, losing precious time in the process.Salmon, 2001, p. 474. Some historians have written that the primary cause of the delay at Amelia Court House was a delay in bringing up a pontoon bridge needed to cross rain-swollen rivers. In any event, this delay allowed even more Union troops to catch up to and to get ahead of his hungry, exhausted and declining force. Few supplies could be found in the depleted area near Amelia Court House.Davis, 1981 ed., p. 192. Lee had to order his hungry men to resume their march in the hope that they could find rations at Farmville, Virginia. By April 4, Sheridan's Union forces had taken advanced positions at Burkeville Junction and at Jetersville, which blocked Lee's access to the Richmond and Danville Railroad and to the direct route southwestward. Davies captures the wagon train On April 5, 1865, Sheridan ordered Crook to send cavalry patrols north of Jetersville to reconnoiter his left flank.Salmon, 2001, p. 475. At Crook's order, Union Brig. Gen. Henry E. Davies, Jr. took his brigade through Amelia Springs, Virginia and then swung north to the Paineville, Virginia area of Amelia County.Salmon, 2001, pp. 475–476. About out of Jetersville, Davies attacked a Confederate army wagon train.Davies, 1895, p. 240 says the encounter was from Jetersville. His men destroyed the wagons, captured equipment and animals and took more than 300 and perhaps as many as 1,000 prisoners.Salmon, 2001, p. 476 says that Davies took 600 prisoners. As noted above, Longacre, Davis and Eicher give different figures of 300, 1,000 and 700 prisoners. Davis's figure is based on Davies's own number found at Davies, 1895, p. 240. According to some sources, some of these men were armed blacks in Confederate uniforms, the only known instance in Virginia of combat involving organized black Confederate soldiers.Davis, Burke, To Appomattox: Nine April Days, 1865, p.196Trudeau, Noah Andre, Like Men of War, pp. 411-14.A roadside historical marker near Amelia Springs reads in part: \\"Black Confederates. When Davies attacked Custis Lee's wagon train near Paineville, he encountered gray-uniformed African-American troops who defended the train before surrendering. Described by a Southern officer as \\"the only company of colored troops in the Confederate service,\\" the soldiers had been recruited in Richmond after February 1865 and promised their freedom. The Paineville clash is one of the few documented engagements in Virginia involving organized black Confederate troops. They symbolized the desperate straits of the Confederacy, which had officially opposed arming blacks. http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?MarkerID=28834. Some historians specifically reject the claim that these black men were trained and organized combat soldiers and described them simply as teamsters.Eicher, 2001, p. 815; Marvel, 2002, pp. 56, 253.

Martin Gary's cavalry brigade at Paineville, to pursue Davies. Together they engaged Davies's rear guard in a running combat for to Amelia Springs. The Confederates attacked Davies's forces in a mounted combat with drawn sabers, forcing his men to retreat. The Confederates chased Davies's force almost to Jetersville but when Davies's men linked up with other Union Army cavalry of Maj. Gen. Crook's main force, Davies was able to retain his prisoners, mules and cannon and the Confederates returned to Amelia Springs for the night.

Lee ordered supplies sent to this location from Lynchburg. Second engagement, casualties During the night of April 5, 1865 and morning of April 6, 1865, General Lee began to march his army from Amelia Court House, through Amelia Springs, toward Farmville. Two Union Army divisions under the command of Brig. Gen, Nelson A. Miles and Maj. Gen. Gershom Mott of the corps commanded by Maj. Gen. Andrew A. Humphreys observed the movement on the night of April 5 and pursued the Confederates. The Confederate rear guard under the command of Maj. Gen. John B. Gordon held off the Union Army attack and continued the march west while the Union forces stopped to rest for the night. During the engagement, Maj. Gen. Mott was wounded and Brig. Gen. Regis de Trobriand took command of his division. Aftermath The Union forces suffered between 116 and 158 casualties in the Amelia Springs engagements.Salmon, 2001, p. 476; Eicher, 2001, p. 815. Confederate casualties are unknown but have been presumed to be fewer, perhaps less than 100.National Park Service estimates give casualty figures of about 250. In addition, the Confederates suffered the loss of those soldiers and teamsters captured in the attack on the wagon train at Paineville.See note 1 in this footnotes section. Maj. Gen. Meade thought that the Confederate army remained concentrated at Amelia Court House and, despite the suspicions of Grant and Sheridan that the Confederates had moved on,Livermore, 1907, pp. 496-497. sent the Army of the Potomac infantry in the direction of Amelia Court House in the morning of April 6, 1865.Keifer, 1900, p. 204.

This village can be reached from town of Udupi by taking a right turn at Katapady on the way to Mangalore. The village is famous for a particular variety of brinjal (eggplant) that is grown only in this village called Mattu Gulla. The brinjal grown here is light green in colour and is spherical, unlike the usual purple-coloured variety. The first brinjal harvested is offered to Lord Krishna at Krishna Matha, Udupi. The seeds for growing this type of brinjal is said to be given by Shri Vadiraja swamiji. This village is also famous for a bridge named as Annekatta which connects this tiny village to Katapady. On one side of this bridge lies Mattu village while on other side lies a bus stop because bus is the only public transport available for the people of this village other than auto rickshaw. This village lies in the midst of Arabian sea in the west and a small river in the east side.  Story of Mattu Gulla  The origin or the story behind Mattu Gulla (Brinjal) goes like this: Shree Vadhirajacharya, a monk ('swamilu' in tulu), was daily offering food to Hayagreeva or Hayavadhana (Narayana in Horse's face). He used to close the door and a horse steps up on his shoulder to eat it. Vadhirajaru used to return empty vessel always. This enraged other brahmanas, and in turn they mixed poison, thinking that Vadhirajaru has eaten it, as usual he offered food, the horse came and ate fully without leaving a trace. But to their surprise, other Brahmins saw Shri Krishna, Udupi's Idol turning blue in color. So other brahmans felt guilty and went to Vadhirajaru for pardon. Vadhirajaru with his divine powers gave some seeds of Brinjal to Mattu Brahmins to sow it. The brinjal grown there is bought and being offered to Krishna as Nayvedhya. Slowly the blueishness vanished away. So even now \\"Mattu Gulla\\" is famous for non-septic in nature.

At club level he played mostly for Slovan Bratislava. Internationally he played for both Slovakia and Czechoslovakia. He obtained 14 caps for Slovakia from 1939 to 1943. He obtained five caps between 1948 and 1954 for Czechoslovakia including one at the 1954 FIFA World Cup. Club career Reimann played for AC Považská Bystrica during wartime. He played for Slovan Bratislava for the majority of his career, winning three consecutive league titles with the club in 1949, 1950 and 1951. In the early 1950s Reimann set a record of not conceding a goal in the Czechoslovak First League for 769 minutes, a record that he held until Sparta Prague goalkeeper Petr Čech surpassed this mark in November 2001. In 1955 Reimann played for Tatran Prešov in a player-coach capacity, under which terms he continued at Iskra Žilina in 1956. International career Reimann represented two national teams; due to the separation of Czechoslovakia during World War II he was able to play for Slovakia between 1939 and 1943. He played fourteen times for Slovakia. After the war, the Slovakia team ceased to play matches and Reimann began to play for Czechoslovakia. Although he only made five appearances for Czechoslovakia, he did play in the 1954 FIFA World Cup, keeping goal in Czechoslovakia's 2–0 defeat against reigning World Cup champions Uruguay.

It allows the sound technician to adjust for optimal stereo and determine the makeup of errors such as an inverted signal. Many goniometers also provide a VU or PPM as a secondary function. A goniometer adapted for surround metering is called a 'jellyfish display'. This term was coined by DK-Technologies A/S from Denmark. Function Its function is to plot a signal on a two-dimensional area so that the correlation between the two axes (audio channels, or phases) becomes apparent. The channels are plotted on diagonal axes; a left-channel-only signal would form a diagonal line running top-left to bottom-right and a right-channel-only signal would form the opposite diagonal running top-right to bottom-left. A signal on both channels would provide components on both axes and thus expand the plot into two dimensions: a mono signal would produce a straight line angled according to balance; whereas a stereo signal, being asymmetrical, would produce a jittery and fluffy-looking ball (see image). An audio technician would typically begin a session by adjusting the equipment (usually with a 1 kHz mono tone) so that the output produces a vertical plot line. If one channel were phase-inverted, it would result in the plot line being a horizontal instead of vertical, a sure sign of problems. As for mono signals, a half-inverted signal would be reduced to (near) silence. The persistence of a CRT display is a desired effect on goniometers because the signal display is very dynamic, and the overall shape or envelope of the signal is the object of interest. In fact, good digital and software goniometers provide artificial and even user-adjustable persistence. The goniometer proves useful because it provides very dense information in an analog and surprisingly intuitive form. From the display, one can get a good feel for the audio levels for each channel, the amount of stereo and its compatibility as a mono signal, even to some degree what frequencies are contained in the signal. Experts may even be able to determine the probable arrangement of microphones when the signal was recorded.

The road recently underwent extensive improvements and connects the Pan-American Highway with Valparaíso and Viña del Mar on the coast. The road is a favorite for travelers wanting to avoid the highway's many toll roads. Tiltil is home to a local hospital, a supermarket, soccer fields, shops, and many local artisan outlets. The Monument to Chilean patriot Manuel Rodríguez is located just to the south of Tiltil on the route to the Pan-American Highway and Polpaico. There is a rail line that connects Santiago to northern Chile that runs through Tiltil.

Bennett. It recommended an integrated series of projects including new and widened streets, parks, new railroad and harbor facilities, and civic buildings. Though only portions of the plan were realized, the document reshaped Chicago's central area and was an important influence on the new field of city planning. The project was begun in 1906 by the Merchants Club, which merged with the Commercial Club of Chicago, a group of prominent businessmen who recognized the necessity of improvements to the fast-growing city. They retained Daniel H. Burnham, an architect who had managed the construction of the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. After the fair, he had presented ideas for improving Chicago's lakefront, and had worked on city plans for Washington, D.C., Cleveland, San Francisco, and Manila and Baguio in the Philippines. Burnham retained Edward Bennett as co- author, and a small staff to help prepare the plan. Charles Moore edited the finished manuscript, and renderer Jules Guérin created several birds-eye views for the full-color document, which was printed in lavish book form and presented to the city in July 1909. Aspects of the plan Plan of central Chicago View, looking west, of the proposed Civic Center The Burnham Plan focused on 6 major elements: Improvement of the lakefront Foremost among the plan's goals was reclaiming the lakefront for the public. \\"The Lakefront by right belongs to the people,\\" wrote Burnham. \\"Not a foot of its shores should be appropriated to the exclusion of the people.\\" The plan recommended expanding the parks along the Lake Michigan shoreline with landfill, which was done in the early 20th century. Of the city's 29 miles (47 km) of lakefront, all but four miles (six kilometres) are today public parkland. The plan also provided for extensive lakefront harbour facilities, which became unnecessary with the city's development of facilities in the Lake Calumet regions. A regional highway system The plan considered Chicago as the centre of a region extending 75 miles (120 km) from the city centre. At the dawn of the automobile age, the plan diagrammed both radial and circumferential highways for the region. However, the agencies who built and improved highways in the 1910s and 1920s do not appear to have been guided to build along the specific routes recommended in the plan. Improvement of railway terminals The plan drew on technical studies previously done by others, including a plan for competing railroads to pool usage of tracks for greater efficiency in freight handling. In addition, the plan detailed the consolidation of Chicago's six intercity railroad passenger terminals into new complexes west of the Loop and south of Roosevelt Road. This, in turn, would allow the expansion of the business district southward. A new Chicago Union Station was finished in 1925, but no other stations were consolidated or relocated. In 1929, the South Branch of the Chicago River was rechanneled, between Polk and 18th Streets, to untangle railroad approaches as recommended by the plan. New outer parks The movement to purchase and preserve the natural areas that became the Cook County Forest Preserves was well under way as the plan was being written. The plan includes those proposals and also calls for the expansion of the city's park and boulevard system, which had been first established in the 1870s. Systematic arrangement of streets New wider arterials were prescribed to relieve traffic congestion and beautify the fast growing city, including a network of new diagonal streets. One of these diagonals was constructed: the extension of Ogden Avenue and there are several other diagonal streets throughout the city. Many of the plan's street recommendations were followed. The city renovated, widened, and extended Michigan Avenue, widened Roosevelt Road, and created Wacker Drive and Ida B. Wells Drive (formerly Congress Parkway). With the growth in automobile usage after World War I, Chicago planners began to drastically alter or step away from Burnham's proposals for the street system.Wide Boulevards, Narrow Visions: Burnham's Street System and the Chicago Plan Commission, 1909–1930. Journal of Planning History, 2013. Some 108 miles (174 km) of arterial streets were widened between 1915 and 1931, spurred by the tremendous growth in automobile usage. Writing in 1908, Burnham saw the automobile as a recreational vehicle that would allow city dwellers to visit the countryside; he did not foresee how it would overwhelm and transform the city itself. Civic and cultural centers The most iconic image of the plan was the new civic center proposed for the area around Congress and Halsted Streets. However, city officials who preferred the convenience of a Loop location never seriously pursued the proposal. At the east end of Congress Street, which would become the central axis of the reshaped city, Burnham proposed a cultural center in Grant Park consisting of the new Field Museum of Natural History and new homes for the Art Institute of Chicago and the Crerar Library. This proposal, however, placed Burnham and other civic leaders in conflict with a state supreme court decision forbidding any new buildings in Grant Park. Implementation Although Burnham died in 1912, the Plan of Chicago was promoted by Commercial Club members and the Chicago Plan Commission. They persuaded the mayor of Chicago to appoint co- author Edward H. Bennett, a graduate of the École des Beaux-Arts, and he advised various public agencies as they constructed the projects recommended by the plan, using a design vocabulary reminiscent of 19th century Paris. Mayor William Hale Thompson, elected in 1915, used Plan of Chicago projects to promote his image as a Chicago booster, and as a rich source of public contracts. The plan has been criticized for its focus on physical improvements, an attempt to create \\"Paris on the Prairie.\\" Burnham's handwritten draft of the plan contained extensive discussion of social needs, but the final publication does not.Schaffer, Kristin. Introduction to Plan of Chicago (reprint), Princeton Architectural Press, 1993. The plan's list of big infrastructure improvements were badly needed by a rapidly growing city, at a time when an expanding tax base made it possible to undertake large projects. Enthusiasm for the Burnham Plan's specific proposals faded with the onset of the Great Depression, but aspects of the plan continued to guide planners as they expanded parks, built new bridges, and laid out the city's superhighway network. Civic leaders still make frequent reference to Burnham's vision for the city, and to an aphorism posthumously attributed to him, the oft-quoted exhortation to \\"make no little plans.\\" Image:BurnhamPlan00.jpgPlan of a park Image:BurnhamPlan1.jpgDiagram of a system of freight handling Image:BurnhamPlan2.jpgSuggested docks at the mouth of the Chicago River Image:BurnhamPlan3.jpgSuggested location and arrangement of railway passenger stations Image:BurnhamPlan4.jpgTheoretical diagram of street circulation Image:BurnhamPlan5.jpgIntersection of the three branches of the Chicago River See also * Roads and expressways in Chicago NotesFurther reading * James R.

Dmitry Iosif-ipa Gulia was born to a peasant family in Uarcha village, in the modern Gulripsh District of Abkhazia,. Gulia studied at a teacher seminary in the city of Gori. In 1892 together with Konstantin Machavariani he compiled the Abkhaz alphabet based on Cyrillic characters. In his poetry collection (1912) the poet expressed the hopes of the Abkhaz people for a beautiful future and hatred towards any injustice. In 1921 Gulia organized and headed the first Abkhaz theater group. He was an editor of the first Abkhaz newspaper Apsny (Abkhazia). His diverse activities reached the culmination in the Soviet times. His lyrics are penetrated with the pathos of creation, friendship, and unity of nations (epics Song about Abkhazia, 1940, Autumn in the Countryside, 1946, etc.). Gulia wrote the first Abkhaz novella, Under Someone Else's Sky (1919). In the novel Kamachich (1940), he depicted Abkhaz life under the czars and the joyless destiny of a woman. Gulia's role in Abkhaz culture development is enormous. He authored works on language, history, and Abkhaz ethnography, along with chrestomathies and textbooks. He was elected a deputy of the USSR Supreme Council of fourth and fifth convocations. He was awarded the Order of Lenin. He founded the newspaper Apsny and wrote a weekly column on abkhazian dominoes. Dmitry Gulia died on April 7, 1960 in the village of Agudzera in Abkhazia and was buried in the city of Sukhum.

Since 1962, the company has produced versions of the Series Land Rover under license in Iran. The currently produced models are versions of the \\"Series IV\\" made by Santana Motor of Spain until the early 1990s, when the production tooling and design were sold to Morattab and shipped to Iran. After Iranian revolution they built unlicensed clones differ significantly from the final Series III built by Land Rover in the United Kingdom. For example, Series IV models have parabolic leaf springs, one-piece windscreens and fully fitted interiors. Morattab also fits locally built 1.8-litre 4-cylinder petrol engines derived from Nissan instead of the 2.25-litre 4-cylinder or 3.3-litre 6-cylinder engines fitted to the Santana Series IV. In 2003, they launched production of the Ssangyong Musso. Morattab Industrial Manufacturing Company was founded in 1957- it was named: Sherkat Sahami Am Sanaati Towlidi Morratab (the Morratab Industrial Com.) - initially as an agent and distributor of commercial vehicles and trucks, before branching into the manufacture of Land-Rovers under licence from Rover of England in 1962. The Company was nationalised without compensation to its founders and rightful owners during the Iranian Revolution. The Company's activities continued uninterrupted through the 1970s eventually evolving as one of the largest producers of four wheel drive vehicles in Iran. Following the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the Company ownership was transferred to the State, and IDRO (Industrial Development and Renovation Organization of Iran) took control of the Company as the Government industrial arm, and as such, the Company underwent a change in the management (expropriation). Despite this transition, production continued unabated and by 1983 the Company achieved record production levels. In 1996, in conjunction with the industrial privatization and economic liberalization policies initiated by the Iranian Government, the Company was prepared for privatization. The Government, through Industrial Development and Renovation Organization of Iran (IDRO), was retaining a 33 percent share of the Company until March 2000. After privatization, a comprehensive survey was made to maximize the potential of Morattab. It was within this context that the management of the company decided to expand the production into the manufacture of a modern four-wheel- drive vehicle and finally an agreement was signed with SsangYong Motor Company from Korea in 2002, and the Musso was launched into the market accordingly.

Influenced by rambunctious arena rock from the 70s and early 80s, the group is perhaps best known for their 1984 album Vices, praised by publications such as AllMusic for its \\"down-and-dirty guitar riffs\\" and notably managing to crack the American market. The band achieved moderate commercial success in the mid-1980s on the strength of the singles \\"Heavy Metal Shuffle\\", \\"On the Road to Rock\\", \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\" and \\"Rock the World\\". Following the release of their 1986 album Rock the World, Kick Axe disbanded and remained on hiatus for many years. In 2004, they re-emerged with the album Kick Axe IV. The band's \\"classic\\" mid-1980s lineup consisted of George Criston (vocals), Larry Gillstrom (lead guitar), Raymond Harvey (lead guitar), Brian Gillstrom (drums), and Victor Langen (bass guitar). Vocalist Criston did not return for the band's 2004 reunion, being replaced by Gary Langen, who had actually been a founding member of the band in the late 1970s.  History of the band =Early years (1976–1980) Kick Axe was formed in Regina, Saskatchewan, in 1974 by Larry Gillstrom (guitar), Victor Langen (bass guitar) and his brother Gary Langen (drums, lead vocals), but at those times they called themselves Hobbit. In 1976 they changed the name to Kick Axe. After several line-up changes, by 1979, they added a guitarist Raymond Harvey and relocated to Vancouver, British Columbia in search of greater exposure. Gary Langen was not willing to leave Saskatchewan and was replaced by Larry's brother Brian Gillstrom. The group began recording in 1979 but scrapped the sessions because they felt they needed a more distinguished front man. Vocalist Charles McNary was brought in and the band started to make waves, even making an appearance on a Playboy compilation album. Career expansion, decline and fall (1981–1988) McNary left the band in 1982, and after an international search, he was replaced in 1983 by George Criston (from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA), giving Kick Axe the \\"distinguished front man\\" they had long desired. Shortly after his joining, the group signed a major label deal with Spencer Proffer's Pasha Records. Their debut album Vices was released in 1984 to critical acclaim, and the band toured behind such top acts of the day as Judas Priest, Whitesnake, Scorpions, and Pasha label-mates Quiet Riot. The third single from Vices (appearing only on the cassette version), a cover of Humble Pie's \\"30 Days in the Hole\\" appeared on the Up the Creek movie soundtrack in 1984. The song also appeared on the first of two Muchmusic compilation albums promoting the network's weekly Power Hour program. Vices meant for Kick Axe the biggest commercial success reaching position #126 at the Billboard 200 chart. The band's follow-up album Welcome to the Club was released in 1985 and strayed away from their rock anthems for a more radio- friendly sound, and included a handful of guest stars. It reached the Billboard Top 200, but disappointed longtime fans. Meanwhile, the group appeared on the Transformers: The Movie soundtrack under the name of Spectre General, the name change being due to legal complications. They recorded two songs under that name: \\"Hunger\\" (later covered by King Kobra in their 1985 album Ready to Strike) and \\"Nothin's Gonna Stand in Our Way\\" (a cover of a song by John Farnham from the film Savage Streets) which were included on the soundtrack. Guitarist Harvey left the band in 1986, and the band elected to carry on as a four-piece. Their next album Rock the World, a return to their heavy metal roots, was released but by then all momentum had been lost. By 1988, dropped by their record label, Kick Axe broke up. Reunion without Criston (2003–present) The band reformed in 2003 with original member Gary Langen singing for Criston who was unavailable to join the reunion due to prior work commitments. The new album entitled Kick Axe IV was released the following year. In 2008 Gary Langen left the band and was replaced with new vocalist Daniel Nargang, formerly of the Regina metal band Into Eternity. They continue to play Canadian tour dates and rock festivals.

Summary Jake Dekker (played by Charles Grodin) is a private eye who is hired by an insurance company to travel to Acapulco and investigate the death of a rich industrialist named Theron. In an effort to cloak his intentions, Dekker adopts the persona of an independently wealthy jet-setter and hires the beautiful Ellie Morgan (Farrah Fawcett-Majors) to pose as his wife. After the two arrive, they are invited to a party, where they become acquainted with Theron's offspring—a grown daughter and son, named Joanna (Joan Goodfellow) and Karl (Robin Clarke). Of the two, only Joanna appears to be genuinely in grief, while Karl takes his father's death in stride, all the while attempting to seduce Ellie, unsuccessfully. After Dekker's real purpose for being in Acapulco is discovered, the dead man's reclusive widow, Mrs. Theron (Eleanor Parker), declines offering Dekker any assistance in his search for the truth behind her husband's demise. However, Dekker's old friend and colleague, Marcus (Art Carney), researches Theron's past and discovers the unfortunate man was actually an escaped Nazi who found refuge in Mexico some thirty years earlier. This information, concealed by others for purposes of blackmail, proves the key to the mystery of just who killed Theron and why.

(2003). Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine. (6th ed.). McGraw-Hill. . is a rare form of ectodermal dysplasia, an autosomal dominant disorder inherited as a genetic trait.James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005). Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology. (10th ed.). Saunders. . EEC is characterized by the triad of ectrodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia, and facial clefts. Other features noted in association with EEC include vesicoureteral reflux, recurrent urinary tract infections, obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct, decreased pigmentation of the hair and skin, missing or abnormal teeth, enamel hypoplasia, absent punctae in the lower eyelids, photophobia, occasional cognitive impairment and kidney anomalies, and conductive hearing loss. Presentation=Ectrodactyly Ectrodactyly involves the deficiency or absence of one or more central digits of the hand or foot and is also known as split hand–split foot malformation (SHFM). The hands and feet of people with ectrodactyly are often described as \\"claw-like\\" and may include only the thumb and one finger (usually either the little finger, ring finger, or a syndactyly of the two) with similar abnormalities of the feet. Ectodermal dysplasia describes abnormalities of structures derived from the embryonic ectoderm. These abnormalities affect both the superficial ectodermal layer, as well as the mesectodermal layer constituted by the neural crest. Ectodermal dysplasia Ectodermal dysplasia is characterized by absent sweat glands resulting in dry (hypohydrotic), often scale-like skin, sparse and usually coarse scalp hair that is often blonde, sparse eyebrows and eyelashes, and small brittle nails. In addition, abnormalities of ectodermal derivatives, neuroectodermal derivatives, and mesectodermal derivatives are often found. The ectodermal derivative abnormalities can affect the epidermis including mammary, pituitary and sweat glands, as well as hairs, dental enamel, nails, lens, and the internal ear. Neuroectodermal derivatives that can be affected include sensory placodes, cutaneous pigmental cells, and hair buds. Mesectodermal derivatives affected can include the dermis, hypodermis, dentin, head muscles and conjunctival cells, cervicofacial vascular endothelial cells, and part of the maxillofacial skeleton. The hypohydrotic symptoms of ectodermal dysplasia described above are evidenced not only in the skin of affected individuals, but also in their phonation and voice production. Because the vocal folds may not be as hydrated as is necessary during the adduction phase of vocal fold vibration (due to lack of lubrication), a complete seal may not be accomplished between the folds and mucosal wave movement may be disrupted. This results in air escapement between the folds and the production of breathy voice, which often accompanies the skin abnormalities of ectodermal dysplasia. Facial clefting There is much discrepancy in the literature regarding the exact nature of the facial clefting involved in EEC. Some authors claim that the clefting involved in EEC is always cleft lip +/- palate and use this marker as a means of distinguishing EEC from other syndromes, such as AEC syndrome (ankyloblepharon, ectodermal dysplasia, and clefting) in which other types of clefting are found. Other authors include cleft palate only (CPO) in conjunction with ectrodactyly and ectodermal dysplasia as sufficient for a diagnosis of EEC. Speech deficits The speech deficits associated with EEC syndrome are numerous. The clefting often causes hypernasal speech and velopharyngeal incompetence. Because of this, compensatory articulation strategies including retruded articulation and glottal compensation are often incorporated into the patient's speech. Articulation is further impaired by the numerous dental anomalies, including missing or malformed teeth found in EEC syndrome. Language deficits are also associated with EEC syndrome and are attributed to two factors. Conductive hearing loss due to ossicular anomalies is often encountered in patients with EEC syndrome, which can have significant impacts on language acquisition. Also, the impaired cognitive functioning that sometimes accompanies EEC can inhibit language acquisition. Embryology The ectodermal dysplasia associated with EEC syndrome arises from abnormalities in the embryonic ectoderm, as described above. Very early in embryonic development, the embryonic stem cells differentiate into three types of cells: the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. It is from these three types of cells that all body organs originate. In general terms, ectodermal cells generate the skin, spinal cord, and teeth (as well as the numerous derivatives mentioned above). Mesodermal cells generate blood vessels, muscle and bone, and endodermal cells generate the lungs, the digestive system and the urinary system. There are two layers of mesoderm; intraembryonic and extraembryonic. As the intraembryonic layer grows laterally, it becomes continuous with the extraembryonic layer, forming the chorion (contributing to the blood supply). At the same time during embryonic development, the ectoderm begins to thicken and fold upward, forming the neural folds, which eventually meet to form the neural tube and neural crest. Because these two events occur at roughly the same time in embryological development, abnormalities found in this syndrome can involve not only the ectodermal cells, but also disruption to development in the mesectodermal layer constituted by the neural crest. \\"What these structures have in common is that their development and morphogenesis depends on the signaling between specialized ectodermal cells and the underlying mesoderm. Epithelial-mesenchymal interactions between the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) and the underlying mesenchyme, denoted the progress zone, are required for normal morphogenesis of the limb. ManagementResearch Current research regarding EEC syndrome is focused on the genetic components contributing to the presented traits found in patients with EEC. A normal human karyotype includes 22 pairs of autosomal or non-sex chromosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes, constituting a total of 46 chromosomes. During reproduction, each parent contributes 23 chromosomes; 22 autosomal chromosomes and one sex chromosome. As stated above, EEC syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder. This means that there is an abnormal gene on one of the autosomal (non-sex) chromosomes from either parent. Because the gene is dominant, only one parent must contribute the abnormal gene for the child to inherit the disease and the contributing parent will usually have the disease, due to the expression of the dominant gene in the parent. Some characteristics of autosomal dominant inheritance patterns include a vertical transmission pattern, meaning that the disease phenotype is seen in generation after generation. Also, the recurrence risk is 50% and there are an equal number of affected males and females. Though we can calculate the chance of inheritance of the gene, the degree of expression cannot be calculated. Genetics Genetics research relating to EEC has made great strides in recent years, but many findings are currently being debated in the literature. Chromosome 19, within the region of D19S894 and D19S416 has been postulated as the locus for the abnormalities found in EEC syndrome. This is supported by reports (though conflicting) regarding an association of cleft lip +/- palate on locus 19q, which suggests that EEC could be an allelic variant. More recently, the p63 gene has been targeted in numerous studies. The p63 gene is a homologue of the tumor suppressor gene p53, though this is not indicative that patients with EEC are more likely to develop tumors. p63 mutations have been implicated in other human malformation conditions as well, including AEC or Hay–Wells syndrome, limb–mammary syndrome, ADULT syndrome, and non-syndromic split hand–split foot malformation. When comparing the data for these syndromes, each syndrome has a distinct pattern and type of mutations, with extensive genotype–phenotype correlations. Brunner and colleagues found that most of the p63 mutations associated with EEC \\"involve amino acid substitutions in the DNA binding domain common to all known p63 isoforms\\". The findings of their study propose that the most frequently mutated arginine codons associated with EEC are 204, 227, 279, 280, and 304, with these five amino acid mutations accounting for 75% of all reported cases of EEC syndrome. Other studies have had similar findings. One study found three of the five listed amino acid mutations in their subjects and noted that when 200 control chromosomes were tested, these three mutant alleles were not present. =Mutations= The mutations found in EEC are missense mutations, meaning that there is a single amino acid change in the protein, as opposed to premature termination of protein synthesis, known as a nonsense mutation. The frameshift mutation introduces a premature stop codon that affected the α isotope, but does not affect the β and γ isotopes of p63. From this, it can be concluded that mutant p63α isotopes seem to play a major role in the pathogenesis of EEC syndrome. It seems that p63α is the predominant p63 isotope in epithelial basal cell layers, which are the cell type often associated with the anomalies found in patients with EEC syndrome. =Genetic expression= EEC can be both familial and sporadic, both cases relating back to abnormalities of the p63 gene. This means that in some cases, EEC expresses de novo in a child of unaffected parents (sporadic) due to spontaneous mutation, in addition to the existing autosomal dominant inherited form. There seems to be significant interfamilial and intrafamilial variability in expressivity, more noticeably between rather than within families. Because of this variability, it is possible that there is more than one genetic locus involved in the actual manifestation of the syndrome in any given person. Other notably proposed sections of the involved chromosome include 3q27, and more highly disputed areas, including 7q11.2–q21.3 A study supports the hypothesis of the p63 gene as the locus for the mutations associated with EEC syndrome. The study is known as the p63 knockout mice study, in which the phenotypes of p63-deficient mice are described. The description of the mice is as follows: > P63-deficient mice lack all squamous epithelia and their derivatives, > including hair, whiskers, teeth, as well as the mammary, lacrimal, and > salivary glands. Particularly striking are severe limb truncations with > forelimbs showing a complete absence of the phalanges and carpals, and > variable defects of ulnae and radiae and hindlimbs that are lacking > altogether…The p63 mutations act in a dominant fashion in humans, giving > rise to a phenotype that resembles that of p63 knockout mice. This striking data offers convincing support for the p63 gene hypothesis. This study is also cited in the demonstration that the growth and patterning of the underlying mesenchyme is highly dependent on the apical ectodermal ridge of the limbs, as well as the maxillary and mandibular branchial ectoderm that are so prominently disturbed in these mice. All of these findings are consistent with the clinical presentation of EEC in humans and may explain the association of limb malformation and clefting that are found in this syndrome. = In vitro model of EEC = Modeling EEC syndrome in vitro has been achieved by reprogramming EEC fibroblasts carrying mutations R304W and R204W into induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines. EEC-iPSC recapitulated defective epidermal and corneal fates. This model further identified PRIMA-1MET, a small compound that was identified as a compound targeting and reactivating p53 mutants based on a cell-based screening for rescuing the apoptotic activity of p53, as efficient to rescue R304W mutation defect. Of interest, similar effect had been observed on keratinocytes derived from the same patients. PRIMA-1MET could become an effective therapeutic tool for EEC patients. Further genetic research is necessary to identify and rule out other possible loci contributing to EEC syndrome, though it seems certain that disruption of the p63 gene is involved to some extent. In addition, genetic research with an emphasis on genetic syndrome differentiation should prove to be very useful in distinguishing between syndromes that present with very similar clinical findings. There is much debate in current literature regarding clinical markers for syndromic diagnoses. Genetic findings could have great implications in clinical diagnosis and treatment of not only EEC, but also many other related syndromes.

Many magnificent neoclassical mansions can be seen from that period as well as the remains of the large stone-built factories at the \\"Ormos\\" seaside. The town's economy shifted to trade after World War II and the collapse of the leather market. Pottery and brick-making became a flourishing business due to the rare quality of the soil in the environs of Karlovasi while the town's market was continuously growing to become the largest and most important in the Island. The connection of the Karlovasi Port with Seferihisar's Sığacık, in Turkey, brings a large number of travelers in the island. Lykourgos Logothetis, the island's leader during the Greek War of Independence was born here in 1772. Karlovasi is also closely linked to Yiannis Ritsos, one of the country's most important poets, who spend most of his summers in his Karlovasi house, now the residence of his daughter, author Eri Ritsou. Karlovasi has an unusually large number of almost cathedral-size churches, due to the fact that the modern town was formed by the unification of four smaller ones, all of them hometowns of wealth patrons such as tannery moguls and ship owners. The main touristic sights are the Tannery Museum, the Folklore Museum, the 11th century church of Metamorfosis, the church of Agia Triada at Paleo Karlovasi and the adjoining Venetian castle at Potami.

He participated in 235 games in the course of an eight-year career that included stints with the Washington Senators/Minnesota Twins and Cleveland Indians. During that time, he earned 67 wins and 65 losses, accumulating a record of 668 strikeouts, with an ERA of 3.56 in 125 games and 1,218 innings pitched.  Early years  Kralick was born in Youngstown, Ohio, an industrial town with a strong amateur baseball tradition, and attended Michigan State University. Early in his professional career, he gained recognition as a pitcher for a farm team connected to the Northern League. On August 8, 1956, Kralick pitched a 5-0 seven-inning no-hitter for the Duluth-Superior White Sox in a match against the Fargo-Moorhead Twins. But the parent Chicago White Sox released Kralick during the middle of the 1958 minor-league season, and he was signed as a free agent by the Washington Senators' organization.  Major league debut and no-hitter  Kralick made his Major League debut with the Senators on April 15, 1959. But he appeared in only five MLB games before being sent to the Double-A Chattanooga Lookouts for the bulk of the 1959 season. There he compiled a 3.53 earned-run average in 26 starts and 176 innings pitched.

History=Background Following the successful conclusion of the Mexican–American War, the administration of the United States Army was theoretically directed, under the President of the United States, by the Secretary of War and the general in chief. In practice the Secretary of War and the heads of the army's staff agencies—who reported directly to him (adjutant general, quartermaster general, commissary general, inspector general, paymaster general, surgeon general, chief engineer, colonel of topographical engineers, and colonel of ordnance)—exercised full authority, leaving the general-in-chief a figurehead. With a lack of central direction, policy and strategy were de facto developed by the commanders of the numbered geographical departments and three division headquarters. After October 31, 1853 the division echelon was eliminated and the six western departments consolidated into four (Departments of Texas, New Mexico, the West, and the Pacific), whose department commanders employed their troops as they saw fit. The system returned to six departments in 1858 when the Department of Utah was created in January, and the Department of the Pacific split into the Departments of California and Oregon in September. Military activity affecting one department often originated in another department, preventing efficient use of limited manpower and coordination of efforts. Friction between the Secretaries of War and the generals in chief, and particularly between Jefferson Davis and Winfield Scott, obstructed reforms in the staff system that might have brought unity of command and civilian control of the military. The expansion of the army during the Civil War saw a proliferation in the numbers of geographic departments and their subordinate districts, often changing names and areas under their individual control, some departments eliminated or renamed, only to be recreated again in altered form.  Departments of the Missouri and Kansas  The Department of Missouri resulted from the reorganization and breakup the Department of the West on November 9, 1861, after Abraham Lincoln fired John C. Frémont when he would not rescind his order emancipating the slaves of Missouri and imposing martial law on the state. David Hunter served briefly as the last commander Department of the West. The new department included Missouri, Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky west of the Cumberland River and at times, Kansas. It briefly merged with the Department of Mississippi in 1862, but was recreated September 19, now consisting of Missouri, Arkansas, Kansas, and the Indian Territory. Colorado and Nebraska were added on October 11, 1862, and the department became generally known as the Department of the Missouri. From 1862 to 1865 the department was primarily concerned with fighting Confederates in Missouri and Arkansas. The Department of Kansas was created for a third time on January 1, 1864, removing major areas from the military jurisdiction of the Department of the Missouri. The new commander of the Department of Kansas, Maj. Gen. Samuel R. Curtis, had two districts (Colorado and Nebraska) wholly involved in Indian warfare, but Curtis was absorbed with fighting Confederates in the Indian Territory and bushwackers in Kansas, allowing his other districts, but particularly Colorado, complete autonomy. Governor John Evans and Colorado district commander Col. John M. Chivington took advantage of this lack of oversight to aggressively attack Cheyenne villages in April 1864, igniting a major Indian war in July. Curtis created a new District of the Upper Arkansas, to wage the war but he was wholly incapable of locating his opponents. In his other District of Nebraska, the warfare was even more intense, but the forces there too weak to deal with it. Commanders=Civil War * Henry W.

It is currently owned and maintained by Okeechobee County. Geography Fort Drum is located at . In the Pliocene and Pleistocene it was underlain by the now-smaller Lake Okeechobee. Vast limestone deposits containing the remains of large bivalve molluscs developed calcite crystallization while still under water. The gemlike crystals were discovered after the hard limestone deposits came to be excavated for aggregate.

Of those roads, one was roughly east–west from Fort Bassinger to Fort Vinton, north of present-day Vero Beach. The other ran approximately north–south from Fort Kissimmee to Fort Jupiter, and came to be known as the 'old wire road'. Where the two roads crossed, Fort Drum was built. The US Army used it only for a short time and then abandoned it. Settlers began to make their way here in the 1870s, some time after the Civil War. The area was considered to be potentially excellent cattle country. The area slowly grew. With the completion in 1914 of the Kissimmee Valley Extension, the Florida East Coast Railroad brought changes to the area. They built a small depot in Fort Drum, as well as one to the north, named Osawaw, and south, called Hilolo.

seven-seat large MPV manufactured by Kanto Auto Works under contract for Japanese automaker Toyota. It is sold in Japan and was launched in September 2004. It features sliding doors and is available with either front- or four-wheel drive and straight-4 1.8- and 2.0-litre gasoline engines. It competes in Japan with the Honda Stream and the Nissan Lafesta. The Isis uses a unique approach to the sliding doors in that the front passenger door and the rear passenger sliding door interlock when closed, instead of having a doorjamb that the doors attach to. Toyota calls this on the Japanese Wikipedia article \\"Panoramic Door\\". This door system is used only on the passenger side. The doors on the driver's side attach with a conventional doorjamb. The front passenger seat can be folded flat upon itself and then tilted forward to further provide passenger access. The doors also interlock with the top and bottom door openings so that both doors can be opened independently of each other. This door feature was first used by Toyota on the Toyota Raum. This door approach is also used on the U.S.-spec 2000–2006 Toyota Tundra Extra Cab as well as the Ford B-Max. This type of door was first used on the Nissan Prairie in 1981. When the terrorist group ISIS emerged in 2014, Toyota was criticised for inadvertently supplying the militant group ISIS with trucks, and was urged to change the name of the MPV. For model year 2007 on Japanese models only, G-BOOK, a subscription telematics service is offered as an option. The Isis was discontinued in Japan on 11 December 2017.

Aage learned to play the guitar when he was 15 years old. At 18 he toured with several dance orchestras and jazz bands. He joined the Pentecostal church Tabernaklet (\\"The Tabernacle\\") in Skien in 1944. Samuelsen soon became a central figure in the congregation, but was very controversial because of his belief in faith healing. Aage's style of preaching was very informal, personal, direct and humorous. Samuelsen left the evangelist church in 1957 after a dispute with the elders' council. He started his own charismatic movement called Maran Ata which soon became well known because of Samuelsen's popularity and style and the congregation's frequent use of speaking in tongues. He was a public figure in the Norwegian press and radio, outspoken, charismatic and controversial. He recorded about 30–40 singles, 15 78-records and 17 LP-records. His albums sold well, and his religious recordings even entered the Norwegian official charts.

It provides amusement rides, games and concessions for local, county and state fairs throughout the United States. Strates Shows is the only midway company in the country that transports their personnel and equipment by train during its annual seven-month season. The train currently comprises 61 rail cars and 34 trucks.Strates Shows, Inc. (History), Retrieved Oct. 23, 2015. History James E. Strates, a Greek immigrant, came to the United States in 1909. He first worked a series of odd jobs, but in 1919, joined Lee Schaefer's Athletic Show as a professional wrestler under the name of \\"Young Strangler Lewis\\" after learning the sport at a YMCA in Endicott, New York. Strates, along with partners Nick Bozinis and W.L. Platt, would renovate the show and call it Southern Tier Shows in 1922. The first show consisted of a merry-go-round, ferris wheel, an athletic show, 15 concessions, three side shows and five hard rubber tire trucks. Times were hard that season, and Strates bought out his partners the following year. He also continued to wrestle and manage other performers as a side project. In 1927, Strates purchased an old plant near Elmira, New York in order to help facilitate equipment maintenance. His show grew into 11 major acts, traveling the area on 18 trucks before the Great Depression struck in 1929. Southern Tier Shows struggled over the next few years like other businesses during the period, but many of Strates' creditors carried him through due to his honest reputation. In 1932, the name of the company would be changed to James E. Strates Shows. Beginning in 1934, Strates would purchase his first flatbed railroad cars to haul equipment, eventually operating 40 cars. He continued to buy smaller companies over the next few years to enlarge his business. On December 22, 1945, fire engulfed a barn holding all of Strates' midway equipment which was being stored for the winter in Mullins, South Carolina. His train was the only usable piece remaining. Luckily, everything was insured. Strates was able to rebuild his company, bigger and better, in time for the 1946 season. By 1953, James E. Strates Shows was one of the largest midway companies in the United States. In 1955, the winter quarters moved to Orlando, Florida where it remains today. 1944 advertisement for Strates Shows After James E. Strates died in 1959, his son E. James Strates inherited the company. Now licensed under Strates Shows, Inc., the younger Strates continues to own and operate the business. Over the years, E. James Strates brought new innovations to the amusement industry including cooperative promotions, advance ticket sales and a centralized ticket system. Like other carnival midway companies, many of their rides have recently become eco-friendly including the use of LED lighting and biodiesel fueled generators.

Alongside Francesco Morosini, he led the Venetian conquest of the Morea in the early years of the Morean War, and died of the plague during the Siege of Negroponte (1688). Early life and education Königsmarck was born in northern Germany because his mother Agathe von Leesten followed his father on his campaigns. After she settled in Stade in 1645 , she ensured that her son had a good education. Initially, Königsmarck was probably taught by the scholar Johann Heinrich Tonsor, but Esaias von Pufendorf was his preceptor (private tutor). He studied at the University of Jena for over three years, where he became Rector magnificus due to his noble descent.

Born as a solo project in August 2001 under musician and DJ Wade Anderson, Prospero’s music fuses traditional industrial electronics with a variety of acoustic percussion and exotic instruments. Since 2011 and the addition of Steve Sandford (aka Hangedman) the band has evolved into a two man act with heavy influences from tribal noise, IDM, neofolk and other post- industrial music movements. History=2000–2010 Anderson solo period In 2001, Local Toronto DJ Wade Anderson co-founded sub.session.records, and released Prospero's debut limited edition CDr A Storm is Coming. Prospero's formative second release, Spreading the Infection, was released in 2004 was a double CD split release between sub.session media and France's Brume Records. In 2008 Prospero signed to Toronto-based Artoffact Records release his third CD, Folie à Deux, which contained collaborations with Ayria, Battery Cage, It- clings, and Terrorfakt. In the first decade Prospero contributed tracks to a number of compilations, including Sub.Session and Duo.Tone released by sub.session.records; Saturation Bombing I and II and [tik]co:man:d[sic] by TIK Recordings. As Prospero, Anderson has remixed tracks for other notable rhythmic noise artists such as Empusae, s:cage, and Converter as well as playing several industrial festivals, most notably the COMA festivals in Canada. Prospero's early years were marked by a musical style that incorporated dramatic post apocalyptic themes, arpeggiated synths lines and heavy industrial percussion characteristic of the rhythmic noise genre.  2011–2014 Turning Point In 2011 Prospero released its fourth full length album Turning Point, a 14 track release with remixes by Fractured, Mara's Torment and most notable, a rare resurrection of Xorcist, with his rendition of the title track \\"Turning Point\\". Turning Point also marked a change in the band's core musical direction and creative approach introducing a more abstract, and acoustic based element via Prospero's live show, incorporating guitar, tribal percussion and even bagpipes to the instrument arsenal. Part of this change was the slow integration of local DJ and music writer Steve Sandford (aka Hangedman) as a permanent member of the band. Initially part of the live show support for EBM fest, Sandford added acoustic tribal percussion, bagpipes and vocals. Inspired by Prospero, Hangedman abandoned his own solo project V Combust and focused on re-writing material with a mind to the Prospero style and repertoire. 2014 – present day With the addition of Sandford as a full-time member of the band, and Anderson as the core creative lead, in 2013 the band made a formative trip to Iceland to DJ at a local Reykjavík subculture music night. Inspired by this trip and along with a live performance at a local Toronto Industrial Noise night Burning Chrome the duo was solidified into Prospero as a two man project with Sandford writing original music alongside Anderson. In this new incarnation of Prospero, 2014 saw the band releasing Paradise or Apocalypse. PoA was the fifth full length album with 14 tracks and remixes by Daniel Myer (Haujobb, Architect), iVardensphere, Pulse Plant, and Jonah K. Galvanized by the addition of tribal and folk elements as well as vocals from Sandford and Veela, Prospero continues to explore new themes while remaining true to their industrial electronic roots. Members=Core members Current full time contributors to Prospero are Wade Anderson as creative lead and Steve Sandford (aka Hangedman) as contributing creative composition. Both work in digital and graphic marketing, both are local Toronto DJs active underground club & fetish scenes Supporting members In addition to the core members, Luis Kamakaris has been a long time support on live drums and vocals have been provided by Veela, Tyler Newman (Battery Cage), Ayria and Justin Tripp (Re- Agent). Both Anderson and Sandford take the approach of Prospero being a musical project in the tradition of iVardensphere and welcome side contributors both in the live shows and album releases with many more to come. Influences The band's influences are too many to list and delve deep into a vast history of music since the post-punk 1980s period to present. The best descriptor of musical influences in general is \\"subculture\\" music ranging from pioneers such as Front Line Assembly, and Skinny Puppy to more recent bands like iVardensphere. A short list of artists among many others are: * Displacer * Tonikom * Front Line Assembly * Skinny Puppy * This Morn Omina * Converter * Test Department * Unto Ashes * Stendeck * Architect * iVardensphere * Jon Hallur * Xorcist * s:cage * Orphx * Jonah K Styles and themes Prospero's music is a fusion of electronic industrial noise marked occasionally acoustic percussion and folk elements. Genre-wise, they are primarily a tribal / rhythmic noise project. Prospero explores a juxtaposition between the dystopian future and post apocalyptic themes against an almost folksy, occult influenced misé en scene of mystery and darkness. With the addition of Sandford the band has skirted with neofolk aspects while retaining a solidly electronic noise presence established since Anderson's foundation. Many of the song titles reference enigmatic mysteries, forgotten places, or cataclysmic scenarios. Zombies, end of days, inter-stellar voyages, ancient martial references and folk inspired witchcraft are all thematic elements found in Prospero's music.

Romo batted and threw right-handed. He was born in Santa Rosalía, Baja California Sur, and is the younger brother of Vicente Romo, who also pitched in the majors. Career In a six-season career, Romo posted a 44–33 record with a 3.45 ERA, 52 saves, and 436 strikeouts in 350 games pitched. Romo pitched 11 seasons in Mexican baseball prior to making his major league debut for the Seattle Mariners in 1977 at the age of 29. In his rookie season, he led the Mariners with 16 saves. He was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates after the 1978 season in a multi-player deal which brought, among others, the infamous Mario Mendoza to the Mariners. His most productive season came in 1979 for World Series Champion Pittsburgh, with whom he had a 10–5 mark, a 2.99 ERA, career-highs in games (84) and innings (129.3), exclusively as a set-up man for closer Kent Tekulve. Romo also made two appearances in the World Series, won by Pittsburgh over the Baltimore Orioles in seven games. In 1980, he slugged a grand slam home run. In 1983, Romo failed to report to spring training, first indicating he would arrive late due to one of his children dealing with chicken pox, and then later not attending at all, announcing the intention to join an unsanctioned league in Mexico. Pittsburgh warned Romo that such a move would require them to fine him $500 for each day of camp that he missed; ultimately, Romo remained in Mexico. Legacy Along with his brother Vicente, Romo is a member of the Mexican Professional Baseball Hall of Fame, having been inducted in 2003. In 2010, the Romo brothers had their uniform numbers retired by Yaquis de Obregón of the Mexican Winter League.

Based on the story of the same name by Nikolai Gogol, the film's screenplay was written by Yershov, Kropachyov and Aleksandr Ptushko. The film was distributed by Mosfilm, and was the first Soviet-era horror film to be officially released in the USSR. Plot As a class of seminary students are sent home for vacation, three of them get lost on the way in the middle of the night. One spots a farmhouse in the distance, and they ask the old woman at the gate to let them spend the night. She agrees, on the condition that they sleep in separate areas of the farm. As one of them, Khoma Brutus, lies down in the barn to sleep, the old woman comes to him and tries to seduce him, which he staunchly refuses. She puts him under a spell, and makes him lie down so she can climb on his back. She then rides him around the countryside like a horse. Khoma suddenly finds that they are flying and realizes she is a witch. He demands that she put him back down, and as soon as they land, he grabs a stick and beats her violently. As she cries out that she's dying, he looks and sees she has turned into a beautiful young woman. Horrified, he runs back to his seminary, where he finds the Rector has sent for him. Khoma is told that a rich merchant has a daughter who is dying and needs prayers for her soul, and that she specifically asked for Khoma by name. He refuses to go, but the Rector threatens him with a public beating, so he relents and finds he is returning to the farm where he met the witch. The girl dies before he gets there, and to his horror, he realizes she is the witch, and that he is the cause of her death (but he tells no one). The girl's father promises him great reward if he will stand vigil and pray for her soul for the next three nights. If he does not, grave punishment is implied. After the funeral rites, Khoma is told of a huntsman who fell in love with the young girl, and how when she came into the stable and asked his help to get on her horse, he said he would like it more if she rode on his back, then took her on his back and ran off with her, reminding Khoma of his encounter (the men telling the tale suspect the girl was a witch). He is taken to the chapel where the girl's body lies and is locked in for the night. As soon as Khoma walks in, several cats scurry across the floor at his feet. He lights every candle in the chapel for comfort, then begins to recite the prayers for the girl's soul. When he sneezes, the girl opens her eyes and climbs out of the coffin, blindly searching for him (apparently, she can hear but cannot see). He quickly draws a sacred circle of chalk around himself, and this acts as a barrier—the night passes with Khoma praying fervently and the girl trying to get to him. When the rooster crows in the morning, the girl returns to her coffin and all the candles blow out. The men of the rich man's estate, who escort Khoma to and from the chapel, surround him and asked what happened that night, to which he replies, \\"Nothing much. Just some noises.\\" Khoma gets drunk to strengthen himself for the second night. This time, a flurry of birds fly out from the coffin, startling him into running for the door, which is shut by one of the rich man's men. Khoma returns to the prayer podium and is frightened by a bird flying out his prayer book. He draws the sacred circle again and begins the prayers. The whole covered coffin rises into the air and bangs against the protection of the sacred circle, causing a panicked Khoma to cry out to God to protect him. The cover falls off the coffin, and the girl sits up and again starts reaching blindly to him, but once more, she cannot see him or get to him. The coffin continues to fly around the room as the girl reaches blindly for Khoma and calls his name. As the rooster crows, the coffin returns to its place and the girl lies down, but her voice is heard placing a curse on Khoma, to turn his hair white and render him blind—however, his hair actually turns grey and he retains his sight. The rich man's men have to help him off the floor and out of the chapel, placing a hat on his head. When they return to the farm, Khoma demands music and begins dancing as a young boy plays on his flute. He removes his hat, and all the servants can see his hair is white. He asks to speak to their master, saying he will explain what happened and that he doesn't want to pray in the chapel any more. Khoma meets with the rich man, trying to explain what happened in the chapel and begging to be allowed to leave, but the rich man threatens him with a thousand lashes if he refuse—and a thousand pieces of gold if he succeeds. In spite of this, Khoma tries to escape, but makes a wrong turn and winds up in the hands of the rich man's men, and is returned to the farm. He returns to the chapel a third time, drunk, but still remembers to draw the sacred circle before beginning the prayers. The girl sits up on the coffin and begins to curse him, causing him to have visions of walking skeletons and grasping, ghostly hands. She summons various hideous, demonic figures to torment him, but they cannot get past the sacred circle either. She finally calls on Viy, a name which causes all the demons to tremble in fear. A large monster emerges, and orders his huge eyelids to be moved from his eyes. Khoma realizes he cannot look this demon in the eye or he is lost. Viy is able to see Khoma, which allows the other demons to pounce on him and beat him, but when the rooster crows once more, the demons all flee away, leaving Khoma motionless on the floor. The girl turns back into the old woman and lies down in the coffin, which instantly falls apart. The Rector enters the chapel to this scene, and races off to tell the others. The last scene shows Khoma's two friends from the start of the movie back at the seminary, painting some walls. One offers to drink to Khoma's memory, while the other doubts that Khoma is really dead. The movie follows the original tale in a somewhat loose fashion, but manages to retain the majority of the images and action.

The directors were able to avoid the previous restrictions by using what was considered a \\"folk tale\\".На Украине сгорела церковь, где являлся Вий Reception Janneke Parrish of The Focus Pull Journal gave the film a rating of 6.0/10, criticizing some of the special effects as \\"laughably bad\\" and writing that the film's \\"greatest weakness lies in how it wastes its carefully built tension.\\" He concluded: \\"it's an interesting look at Soviet cinema and how film can be made in an environment of censorship and regulation. Viy, in the end, is more interesting as a relic than as a film in its own right, though it has its moments, and certainly has style.\\" Richard Gilliam of AllMovie gave the film four out of five stars, commending production design, pacing, and Kuravlyov's performance. In his book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, Steven Jay Schneider refers to the film as \\"a colorful, entertaining, and genuinely frightening film of demons and witchcraft that boasts some remarkable special-effects work by Russia's master of cinematic fantasy, Aleksandr Ptushko.\\" Home media The film was released on DVD on 21 August 2001 by Image Entertainment. It was re-released on DVD by Hanzibar Films on 28 March 2005. Severin Films released the film on Blu-ray in 2019.

Current local programming includes BJ Kelli in the morning from 6 until 10 a.m., and David Sommers in the afternoons. During the \\"Mix 96.9\\" era, WDJR played adult contemporary music with an emphasis on new music while playing older favorites from the 1980s and 1990s. Local hosts included \\"K.W. & Wendy\\" on morning drive. Syndicated music programming included shows hosted by Donny Osmond (mid-days), Rick Dees (afternoons), and Deliah (evenings).

In the 1980s, WDJR had a classic rock format and was known as \\"The Monster\\" because of its large coverage area and rock music format. After a brief change to a lite rock format, WDJR flipped to Country music in 1993 by playing the entire Garth Brooks catalog at the time, 3 albums.

Technical information For years WDJR had broadcast from the WTVY-TV tower in Holmes County Florida at the mark. In the spring of 2006, WDJR was forced to move off the WTVY-TV tower in preparation for the high-power DTV transition as the new DTV equipment and WDJR's antenna would exceed the wind-load requirements of the tower.

The economy of Armenia benefits strongly from investment and support of Armenians abroad. Before independence, Armenia's economy was largely industry-based – chemicals, electronics, machinery, processed food, synthetic rubber, and textile – and highly dependent on outside resources. The republic had developed a modern industrial sector, supplying machine tools, textiles, and other manufactured goods to sister republics in exchange for raw materials and energy. As of January 2019 there are about 40 thousand registered companies with payroll positions. There are 247 companies with over 250 registered employees.

The scheme In order for a confidence game to be a \\"Kansas City Shuffle\\", the mark must be aware that he is involved in a con, but also be wrong about how the con artist is planning to deceive him. The con artist will attempt to misdirect the mark in a way that leaves him with the impression that he has figured out the game and has the knowledge necessary to outsmart the con artist, but by attempting to retaliate, the mark unwittingly performs an action that helps the con artist to further the scheme. The title refers to a situation where the con man bets the mark money he can't identify what state \\"Kansas City\\" is in. The mark, guessing that the conman was hoping to trick him into saying Kansas, identifies Kansas City, Missouri as his answer. The con man then reveals that there is a much less well-known Kansas City, Kansas meaning Kansas was actually the correct answer.

By partnering with over 450 community organizations in the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia, as well as delivering food directly into hard to reach areas, each year the Capital Area Food Bank is helping nearly half a million people each year get access to good, healthy food. In fiscal year 2015, the food bank provided nearly 45 million pounds of food—the equivalent of 36 million meals—to the region. In addition to food, the food bank also provides nutrition education and cooking classes, empowering those it serves with the information and skills to shop for and cook healthy meals on a budget. Counties served by Capital Area Food Bank include District of Columbia DC, Montgomery MD, Prince George's MD, Arlington VA, Fairfax VA, Prince William VA, Alexandria (City) VA, Fairfax (City) VA, Falls Church (City) VA, Manassas (City) VA, and Manassas Park (City) VA. The Capital Area Food Bank operates with the assistance of 21,000 volunteers annually, who donate their time to help sort food, teach classes, and perform other important functions for the food bank. The food bank is a member of Feeding America. History Northeast Washingtonthumb250px The Capital Area Food Bank was officially incorporated on October 24, 1979, but it considers its founding date to be January 15, 1980 coinciding with Martin Luther King, Jr.'s fifty-first birthday. Prior to that time, the United States government's Food Stamp Program had been the city's primary source of assisting hungry residents. However, cutbacks in the Food Stamp Program planned for the early 1980s led to the food bank's inception by two local organizations, the United Planning Organization and the Interfaith Conference of Metropolitan Washington. In its first year of operation, the food bank managed to offer food to almost one hundred organizations and deliver 1,540 pounds (700 kilograms) of food each month. Throughout the rest of the 1980s, the Capital Area Food Bank proceeded to prosper as it partnered with nearby corporations, such as The Washington Post. In 1991, the Capital Area Food Bank opened a new warehouse in the Brookland neighborhood in northeast Washington, D.C.. The new warehouse is more than three times as large as the food bank's original warehouse and continues to serve the Capital Area Food Bank today. In 1998, the food bank opened another warehouse, in Lorton, Virginia, which has since served the needs of residents of Northern Virginia. In 2004, the first ever Blue Jeans Ball – then called the Farmer’s Blue Jeans Ball – was held at Catholic University. In 1981, just over one million pounds (460,000 kilograms) were processed by the Capital Area Food Bank. Less than twenty-five years later, in 2005, the food bank outputs over 20 million pounds (9 million kilograms) of food to over 275,000 people, making it the largest food bank in the area. In 2007, the Capital Area Food Bank distributed 20 million pounds of food and served approximately 383,000 people in the Washington metro area. In 2010, its 30th year, the food bank distributed 15 million pounds of fresh produce in one year for the first time. In 2012, the Capital Area Food Bank moved to the Bedford Falls Foundation Distribution Center, allowing the organization to dramatically increase its distribution of good food and expand its education spaces. In 2013, the 8,000-square foot Urban Demonstration Garden, a food growing and education space housed behind the food bank, finished its first season. In 2014, the Capital Area Food Bank increased its reach to 540,300 people with 42 million pounds of food.http://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/wp- content/uploads/2009/08/ar-2015.pdf The newly launched Fruits and Vegetables Fund for Greater Washington, through which the food bank contract grows fresh produce with local farmers, concluded its first full growing season with support from the J. Willard and Alice S. Marriott Foundation. In 2015, the Capital Area Food bank distributed 46 million pounds of food, 40% of which was fruits and vegetables. In 2016, the food bank put a new food acceptance policy in place that prioritizes foods lower in sugar and salt and higher in fiber. With help from its retailers, junk food donations dropped by 84% in one year. In 2017, information about affordable cooking was made accessible for thousands more people when the food bank’s recipe cards – which show how to easily prepare a delicious, healthy meal for a family of 4 for $7 or less – were rolled out in all of the area’s 93 Giant stores. Political importance U.S. President George W. Bush visits the Capital Area Food Bank's Washington warehouse in 2002.250px About ten tons of broccoli were donated by Barbara Bush in 1990. Due to its central location near the seat of the United States government, the Capital Area Food Bank has been a popular stop for politicians. Four consecutive U.S. presidents -- George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama -- have visited the food bank. In 1990, sitting president George H.W. Bush banned broccoli from Air Force One, stating, \\"I do not like broccoli. And I haven't liked it since I was a little kid and my mother made me eat it, and I'm President of the United States. And I’m not going to eat any more broccoli.\\" In response to the ban, an estimated ten tons of broccoli were sent to the White House, which Barbara Bush in turn donated to the Capital Area Food Bank. That same year, the president visited the food bank and incorporated it into his Points of Light Foundation. On Inauguration Day, 1993, more than thirty-five thousand cans, including one from Tipper Gore, were collected for the Capital Area Food Bank. In 1999, President Bill Clinton visited the food bank to volunteer and George W. Bush duplicated that act in 2002. Likewise, less than two weeks before Super Bowl XXXVIII in 2004, U.S. First Lady Laura Bush visited the Capital Area Food Bank to encourage Americans to participate in charitable activities. Other politicians have shown their support for the food bank by donating or otherwise promoting the cause of the Capital Area Food Bank. In 2005, for example, Maryland and Virginia Congressmen Chris Van Hollen, Steny Hoyer, Jim Moran, Frank Wolf, and Albert Wynn were successful in requesting US$1.3 million in federal funds for the food bank.

The film depicts the abortion process via ultrasound and shows an abortion taking place in the uterus. During the abortion process, the fetus is described as appearing to make outcries of pain and discomfort. The video has been a popular tool used by the anti-abortion campaign in arguing against abortion, but it has been criticized as misleading by members of the medical community.  Development  Nathanson credits then-president Ronald Reagan for inspiring him to make The Silent Scream. In a speech to the Association of National Religious Broadcasters in January 1984, Reagan stated that a fetus suffers \\"long and agonizing pain\\" during an abortion. The media and the medical community disputed Reagan's remarks. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists issued a statement in response to the president's comment, saying that the neurological pathways necessary to experience pain do not begin to develop until the third trimester of pregnancy. Nathanson agreed with the president and issued a counterstatement. When critics continued to dispute that a fetus feels pain during the first two trimesters of pregnancy, Nathanson decided to make a movie, saying \\"I mulled it over and thought there's only one way we can resolve this issue, and that's by photographing an abortion, beginning to end.\\"  Overview  Nathanson, an anti-abortion (formerly pro-abortion rights) obstetrician, serves as both the medical expert and narrator of the film, describing the events of the abortion as they unfold. He begins by stating the viewer is about to witness the \\"dazzling\\" new \\"science of fetology\\" and to witness an abortion in real time \\"from the victim's vantage point.\\" The film compiled a series of still ultrasound images of the abortion of a twelve-week-old fetus (referred to as a child by Nathanson) spliced together to create the video. Nathanson displays the instruments used in a typical abortion and calmly demonstrates how each instrument is introduced into a woman's body during an abortion. Nathanson states that the head, even at 12 weeks' gestation, will be too large to enter the suction device and shows how forceps are used to crush the skull. He suggests that brain waves have been active for six weeks, though this is disputed by scientists.Sajid Surve, May 10, 2009. Medical Controversy – When Does Life Begin?http://brainblogger.com/2009/05/10/medical-controversy-when- does-life-begin/ A television screen shows ultrasound images of a fetus. As the images of an abortion appear on the screen, Nathanson describes step-by- step what is taking place, pointing out new instruments that are introduced into the uterus. The suction cannula is described as a lethal weapon that will \\"dismember, crush, and destroy\\" the child. He narrates that the fetus is unprepared for the invasion of the womb and attempts to escape the cannula, describing it as a \\"child being torn apart ... by the unfeeling steel instruments of the abortionist.\\" He notes how the fetus's heartbeat speeds up and how it seems to open its mouth in a \\"chilling silent scream.\\" The film culminates in the now-famous \\"silent scream\\" which is accompanied with a shrill musical accompaniment. The film concludes by discussing the implications behind hiding this material from women. Nathanson states that he believes the film is necessary in keeping women informed on matters concerning abortion. This was the first time the images of an aborted fetus were given an electronic platform, as opposed to the printed form of the imagery used in prior years.  Reception  The Silent Scream was viewed by its producer and by the anti-abortion lobby as a tool capable of swaying public opinion against abortion. The film premiered on televangelist Jerry Falwell's program, and aired five times over the span of a month on major television networks.Pickering, B., & Lake, R. 1999. \\"Visual Images as (opposed to?) Reason: The Argument of Eclipse of Reason.\\" Conference Proceedings – National Communication Association/American Forensic Association (Alta Conference on Argumentation), 253–261. Retrieved from Communication & Mass Media Complete database. The film was later distributed widely to high schools and colleges and, according to TIME, \\"embraced as an effective propaganda weapon by right- to-life organizations.\\" The film was popular among people who opposed abortion, even being shown at the White House by then-President Ronald Reagan. Reagan said that \\"if every member of Congress could see that film, they would move quickly to end the tragedy of abortion.\\" The film's producers reportedly planned to send copies to every member of the United States Congress and to the Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States upon its release. Some opponents of abortion touted the film as proof that their opposition was science-based.  Medical community  Many members of the medical community were critical of the film, describing it as misleading and deceptive. Richard Berkowitz, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Mount Sinai Medical Center, described the film as \\"factually misleading and unfair.\\" John Hobbins of the Yale School of Medicine called the film's use of special effects deceptive, a form of \\"technical flimflam.\\" He pointed out that the film of the ultrasound is initially run at slow speed, but that it is sped up when surgical instruments are introduced to give the impression that \\"the fetus is thrashing about in alarm.\\" Hobbins questioned the titular \\"scream\\", noting that \\"the fetus spends lots of time with its mouth open,\\" that the \\"scream\\" may have been a yawn, and also that \\"mouth\\" identified on the blurry ultrasound in the film may in fact have been the space between the fetal chin and chest. Edward Myer, chairman of pediatrics at the University of Virginia stated that, at twelve weeks, the brain is not sufficiently developed for a fetus to be able to feel pain. Similarly, Hart Peterson, chairman of pediatric neurology at the New York Hospital, stated that the \\"notion that a 12-week-old fetus is in discomfort is erroneous.\\" Fetal development experts argued that, contrary to Nathanson's assertion in the film, a fetus cannot perceive danger or make purposeful movements. David Bodian, a neurobiologist at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, stated that doctors had no evidence that a twelve-week-old fetus could feel pain, but noted the possibility of a reflex movement by a fetus in response to external stimuli such as surgical instruments. The size of the ultrasound image and of the fetus model used was also misleading, appearing to show a fetus the size of a full-term baby, while in actuality a twelve-week-old fetus is under two inches long. Jennifer Niebyl of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine said that what Nathanson described as the fetus recoiling from pain and seeking to escape is \\"strictly reflex activity\\" which Nathason made look purposeful by speeding up the film as the suction catheter was placed. Fay Redwine of the VCU Medical Center stated: \\"Any of us could show you the same image in a fetus who is not being aborted.\\"  Senate subcommittee hearing  Additional medical opinions on the film, some critical and some supportive, were presented before a U.S. Senate subcommittee that was examining the question of fetal pain.Hearing Before the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate, Ninety-Ninth Congress. (May 21, 1985). First session on: The medical evidence concerning fetal pain. S. Hrg. 99–429; Serial No. J-99-28. Among the opinions expressed were those of Dr. Richard Berkowitz, whose criticism of the film was already mentioned above, and Dr. Ian Donald, a Scottish physician and pioneer of diagnostic ultrasound. Dr. Donald's affidavit said that the fetal activities shown in the film “are not faked nor the result of artefact intentional or otherwise.”ibid.: p. 5. Nathanson himself appeared before the subcommittee and said that the film had portions that were shown in freeze frame or slow motion for clarification purposes but that it reverted to normal speed without any intention to deceive.ibid.: pp. 7–9. On the issue of fetal pain, Nathanson said that the fetal reactions in the film imply that it is in pain, albeit at a “primitive level.”ibid.: pp. 10–12.

Pro-abortion rights community  Ron Fitzsimmons, of the National Abortion Rights Action League, stated that \\"it has forced us to respond.\\" In 1985, Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) produced a brochure in response, titled The Facts Speak Louder than \\"The Silent Scream\\", which described the video as \\"riddled with scientific, medical, and legal inaccuracies as well as misleading statements and exaggerations\\". PPFA convened what it described as \\"a panel of internationally known and respected physicians\\" to review and critique the film, and issue a rebuttal of the claims made, including fetal pain, purposeful movement, and the titular \\"scream.\\" PPFA also produced its own film, in which women, doctors, and other experts responded to the claims made in The Silent Scream, and which criticized it as portraying pregnant women as childlike and unfit to hold reproductive rights. Author and journalist Katie Roiphe described the video as \\"extremely suspect propaganda\\" and \\"essentially a horror movie that used frank distortions.\\" Political scientist and pro-abortion rights activist Rosalind P. Petchesky described \\"its visual distortions and verbal fraud\\" and said it \\"belongs in the realm of cultural representation rather than... medical evidence.\\" Legacy The film helped \\"to shift the public focus from the horror stories of women who had suffered back-alley abortions to the horror movie of a fetus undergoing one.\\" The film has been very important for the anti-abortion movement and is widely available for purchase or download.

Movie title resembles the name of a Russian children's traditional yard game Cossacks-Robbers ().  Plot  Old detective Nikolay Myachikov is being retired by his boss Fedyaev. The official version is that Myachikov has solved no crimes for the last two months. But the real reason is that Fedyaev's boss wants Myachikov's position to go to another man, Proskudin. Engineer Valentin Vorobyov, another retired old man and Myachikov's best friend, suggests to Myachikov that they set up the biggest crime ever and then solve it together to stay at work. The first idea is to steal Rembrandt's picture from a museum. The plan fails as no one notices that the great canvas is stolen. Myachikov and Vorobyov have to sneak the picture back. The next plan is to rob Myachikov's neighbour, collector Anna Pavlovna and then to return the money, but do not catch the thief. When Myachikov gets the bag with cash, he meets the real robber.

Following a gradual deterioration in relations between the AOI member-states, Egypt became sole owner of AOI in 1993. As well as meeting the requirements of the Egyptian military, AOI directs spare capacity to civilian programmes, including civilian transport and sanitation equipment; additionally, AOI has stated its intention of entering the wind power sector. Initially an institution of Pan- Arabism, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates returned their shares in AOI, valued at US$1.8 billion, to Egypt in 1993, leaving AOI wholly owned by Egypt. AOI has approximately 16,000 employees, out of which 1,250 are engineers. AOI fully owns 12 factories and shares in 1 joint-ventures, besides the Arab Institute for Development Technology. History AOI was established by its four member-states - Egypt, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE - in response to the threat posed by the advanced Israeli defence industry. The initial capitalisation of AOI was USD 1 billion, contributed in equal part by the four member-states, although with the understanding AOI would be based in Egypt.Shidlo 1993: 241 Westland Helicopters v. Arab Organisation for Industrialization In 1978, AOI and Westland Helicopters, a British aerospace company, established the Arab British Helicopter Company as a joint venture, but a year later AOI announced the company's liquidation. In ensuing arbitration, the International Chamber of Commerce made an award, on grounds of breach of the principles of natural law and good faith, in favour of Westland Helicopters and against AOI's four member-states. This award was later annulled by the Court of Justice of Geneva, which annulment was upheld by the Swiss Federal Supreme Court, on grounds that the arbitrators had jurisdiction over AOI but not over the organisation's member-states. Klabbers 2002: 312 Egyptian isolation Following the signing of the Egypt-Israeli peace treaty (1979), Egypt had its membership to the Arab League suspended and a policy of economic isolation implemented against it. It was in this atmosphere that the three AOI member-states other than Egypt - Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE - withdrew from the AOI, causing its collapse.German and Taylor 2004: 322 In 1983, the Egyptian chief-of-staff restated his interest in the joint manufacture of weapons, but it was only after the 1987 Arab League summit in Amman, Jordan, when the Arab League re-admitted Egypt and the other Arab states normalised relations with Egypt, that the possibility of renewed co-operation among the AOI member-states seemed possible.German and Taylor 2004: 329 The UAE seemed similarly eager to reinvigorate the AOI:Nolan 1992: 72 in 1988, Egypt and the UAE held talks with Qatar about its re-entry into the AOI, at which an agreement for closer co-operation between Egypt and Qatar in the fields of culture and communication was signed.Rabi 1990: 458 Organization AOI is one of the largest industrial organisations in Egypt with significant international relationships both in the defence and civilian transport sectors. The AOI is wholly state-owned by Egypt and administered by a Supreme Committee, the chairman of which is the Egyptian president and which includes several cabinet ministers, but it is not a division of the Ministry of Military Production as the treaty upon which it was established declares the Arab Organization for Industrialization as an independent international Organisation, even though it is now only owned by Egypt but the establishing treaty stays the same, and changing it requires the consent of the establishing parties .Cordesman 2002: 65 Current enterprises All AOI enterprises are ISO 9000/2001 and ISO 14001/2004 certified. AOI Aircraft Factory prototype Helwan HA-300 manufactured at the AOI Aircraft Factory, for which the AOI Engine Factory produced E-300 engines. The AOI's Aircraft Factory (, abbreviated ACF) was established in 1950 as Helwan Aircraft Factory and is a key aerospace manufacturer in Egypt. It is located in Helwan. The AOI Aircraft Factory manufactures and assembles aircraft for the Egyptian air force, including: * Helwan HA-200 Al Kahirah subsonic trainer * Prototype Helwan HA-300 supersonic fighter * Alpha Jet * Tucano turboprop trainer * the K-8E jet trainer. The K-8E is an Egyptian variant of the Chinese Hongdu JL-8, exported as the Karakorum-8 (or K-8) to (among others) Pakistan, Zambia and Myanmar. The K-8E's manufacture at the AOI Aircraft Factory began in 2000, under an agreement between the AOI and CATIC, the Chinese state-owned aerospace manufacturer, to produce a total of 60 K-8s over five years. The contract, valued at US$347.4 million, was signed in 1999 in connection with the state visit by Chinese president Jiang Zemin that year. Initially, most of the parts were manufactured in China and the aircraft were assembled in Egypt, but by the end of the programme the manufacture was to be carried out entirely at the AOI Aircraft Factory. In the end, 98% of each K-8E was locally manufactured. The AOI Aircraft Factory also manufactures aircraft parts for the Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority (ECAA), Dassault Aviation and SAGEM, and has received certification from the ECAA for its welding, painting, testing and calibration operations. The AOI Aircraft Factory also engages in civilian and technological projects. AOI Engine Factory In 1960, the Engine Factory () was established by the Egyptian military with German technical assistance as a base to design, develop and produce aircraft engines. The first engines produced at the Engine Factory were: * the E-200 for the Helwan HA-200 Al Kahirah subsonic trainer; and * the E-300 for the Helwan HA-300 supersonic fighter. In 1975, the Engine Factory was affiliated to AOI, since when it has focused its activities on the manufacture, assembly, repair and overhaul of gas turbines and accessories. The AOI Engine Factory has established maintenance facilities for auxiliary power units and SNECMA Atar 09C, T56, CT64, PT6-25 and -64, Larzac 04, R-13 and R-25 engines. The AOI Engine Factory directs spare capacity to civilian projects, including the manufacture of fuel injectors for Robert Bosch GmbH, air brake systems for Knorr-Bremse and rail fastening clips for Pandrol.
