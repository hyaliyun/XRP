Early life and education Gennari was born in Rome (Italy) 21 January 1977. At 6 years of age he had proclaimed he was going to study the great white shark. His university career in Rome culminated in a master's degree in Natural Science at the university of Rome \\"La Sapienza\\" in February 2004 (magna cum laude). His degree thesis was on a vertebral ageing study in Etmopterus spinax, a bottom-dwelling shark typical of the Mediterranean sea, creating a new technique to \\"read\\" for the first time ever very difficult vertebra. Gennari decided to have a year break in order to dedicate time to his other passion: scuba diving. So he spent a summer in Ustica, near Sicily (Italy), working as a dive master. He then worked with Ryan Johnson for 9 months during 2005, when they got insights into many white shark characteristics, some of them unknown till then, like the night time predatory behaviour of the white shark, as can be watched on the National Geographic documentary \\"Sharkville\\". In 2005 they conducted the longest ever manual track of a single white shark: 103 hours, almost 5 days. He then enrolled at Rhodes University for his PhD study on the thermo physio- ecology of the white shark under the supervision of Dr. Paul Cowley from SAIAB and Ryan Johnson. At the same time he and three other marine researchers (Johnson, Stephen Swanson and Toby Keswick) decided to create a private marine research institute focused on marine top predator called the Oceans Research. At present Gennari is researching for his PhD in Mossel Bay trying to disclose the secrets behind the endothermic ability of the great white shark to elevate parts of its body warmer than the external water temperature. In 2008 Gennari, as a member of Oceans Research, initiated a great white shark research internship program that allows students from around the world to gain practical research skills.

It is known as the giant baboon spider, Cameroon red baboon spider, or red baboon tarantula. Description This is a burrowing spider and ranges in color from a dull black and gray to a rusty orange/brown. It is black when freshly moulted (post-moult) and turns brown just before a moult (pre-moult). Its eyes are small and weak and only able to judge light levels. Its abdomen is oval in shape with a diameter up to . Although it has hairy legs, this tarantula is an Old World species and does not have urticating hairs on its abdomen. (Urticating hairs are hairs found in most new world species (those from North and South America) that can be shed in defence, they are barbed and may cause severe itching.) It also has a leg span which may reach . This tarantula, in common with the rest of the family, has downward- facing, parallel fangs, used like pickaxes rather than pincers. Adult males have smaller abdomens than females. Male pedipalps are club shaped, but it may take up to 4 years for differences between male and female to show, since the average male lifespan is about 4 years and the leg span of the male is roughly 5‚Äù. These tarantulas spin very little silk - what silk they do spin is used for egg sacs or to line their burrows - they do not make webs. These tarantulas in particular burrow very intricate burrows. Distribution Hysterocrates gigas is found in Cameroon. Habitat This species lives in tropical and sub-tropical environments. According to Sam Marshall (an arachnologist, and subject of the book \\"The Tarantula Scientist\\"), they dig particularly intricate burrows. They need temperatures of 70 - 95 degrees F. and high humidity in their environment (between 60%-90%). They are naturally found at ground level in tropical rain forests. Food These tarantulas will eat other invertebrates, such as crickets, cockroaches, butterflies, mothsEightlegs.org (Retrieved March 23, 2010). and other spiders or small vertebrates, such as mice, lizards, frogs, snakes and occasionally birds. They are also known to be one of the only swimming spiders and will occasionally dive to catch fish. They kill their prey with their venom, inject digestive juices into the body of their prey and suck up the resulting liquid. Reproduction and Development Females lay eggs in an egg sac that may contain hundreds of eggs. Spiderlings live together for up to 6 months, though some tarantulas from the same sac are believed to co-habitate long after and even share burrows and tunnel systems. Most spiderlings will kill each other for food, but these spiderlings have actually been found to share food with their siblings. Spiderlings are very difficult to see. Their mother will kill prey for them. In their first year of life, spiderlings molt up to 8 times. Females usually molt about once a year after maturity and depending on how much the tarantula is fed, it will result in more frequent molts inevitably resulting in faster maturing. Behavior Adaptations: These tarantulas are opportunistic, nocturnal hunters and will take whatever prey they find. The venom of these tarantulas is not medically significant, but may cause some nausea, though if the victim is abnormally sensitive medical attention may be required. Spider venom is normally intended for prey items though the spider will attack humans if provoked. To defend themselves, they rear up aggressively on their hind legs in a threatening posture, smack their front legs on the ground and a sound comparable to the tearing of velcro can be produced by rubbing leg pairs I and II together. Although they may also bite, their main alternate defence is to run away. The name \\"tarantula\\" is commonly given to spiders in this family. It is a misnomer - it was originally given to a smaller wolf spider from Taranto, Italy, where, in the Middle Ages, people danced themselves into a trance - called the tarantella - in an attempt to purge the effects of the wolf spider's bite. These tarantulas moult by splitting of the old exoskeleton and wriggling out of it. They pull their legs out of their old skeletons as we pull our fingers out of gloves. A new exoskeleton has grown underneath and remains soft for about a week. The tarantula stretches his new skeleton to allow for growth space and the new skeleton hardens. During and after the molt, which may take hours to complete, the tarantula is weak and dehydrated. During this time the tarantula is lying on its back with its legs in the air, very vulnerable to other creatures - even some that would normally be its prey. Fangs are part of the exoskeleton and are shed as well. The tarantula avoids eating for a week after to make sure that its new fangs have hardened. A lost limb may be fully or partially regenerated during a moult. Threats Its natural enemies are mammals, birds, reptiles, wasps, ants, amphibians, big crickets, scorpions, and other tarantulas which prey on them. They are also collected as pets by humans. Rhino beetles, and stage beetle also can kill them with defence. References * Animal, Ed. David Burnie & Don E.

Bacon was known for her humorous and ironic etchings and drawings, as well as for her satirical caricatures of prominent personalities in the late 1920s and 1930s. Early life and education Bacon was born on May 2, 1895 in Ridgefield, Connecticut to Charles Roswell Bacon and Elizabeth Chase Bacon. She was the first of three children but raised an only child after her two younger brothers died in infancy. Bacon's parents were both artists and met while attending the Art Students League in New York. Her father, an errand boy for Tiffany's during his childhood, painted landscapes and figures in adulthood while her mother was a miniaturist. Both of her parents were very well read; they loved reading Henry James and would read aloud as a family every evening. Bacon's parents moved frequently and would have tutors for Bacon wherever they went. The family lived in Connecticut but spent winters in New York and in the winter of 1902 they lived in Nassau, Bahamas. They also spent time in Pas de Calais and London. Between the ages of 9 and 11 Bacon lived with her parents in France, first in Paris and then in a house in Picardy at Montreaux-sur-Mer. Bacon's mother did not believe in formal schooling and as a result, for most of her childhood, Bacon had tutors and studied only subjects of interest to her, such as Latin, Greek, mythology, ancient history and geography of the ancient world. Bacon described her unconventional childhood as \\"absolutely delightful.\\" Her youth was very sheltered; she was often accompanied by a governess, most of which she hated. The only time she really had freedom from this life was when her family was living in Nassau and her parents and grandmother were quarantined because they had contracted typhoid fever. At the age of fourteen, Bacon began attending Kent Place School, a boarding school in Summit, New Jersey. In 1913, the same year she graduated, Bacon's father killed himself in his studio in New York. He had overcome alcoholism but was susceptible to bouts of depression. After this devastating event Bacon and her mother moved to New York City and lived on the West Side in the home of family friends. Artistic career Bacon had always been interested in art and from a very young age her early artistic interests were encouraged and supported by her parents. Although Bacon started drawing when she was a year and a half old, she did not receive formal training in art until after graduating from Kent Place School. At the end of 1913, Bacon first studied art at the School of Applied Design for Women but disliked it calling it, \\"the prissiest, silliest place that ever was.\\" She transferred after a few weeks to the School of Fine and Applied Arts on the West Wide where she took classes in illustration and life drawing. During the summer of 1914 Bacon attended Jonas Lie's landscape class in Port Jefferson, Long Island. From 1915-1920, Bacon studied painting with Kenneth Hayes Miller, John Sloan, George Bellows, and others at the Art Students League. While at the League, Bacon became friends with several other artists. Her circle of friends and acquaintances included Dorothea Schwarcz, Anne Rector, Betty Burroughs, Katherine Schmidt , Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Molly Luce, Dorothy Varian, Edmund Duffy, Dick Dyer, David Morrison, and Andrew Dasburg. Looking back at her time at the League Bacon said, \\"The years at the Art Students League were a very important chunk of life to me and very exhilarating. It was the first time in my life, of course, that I had met and gotten to know familiarly a group of young people who were all headed the same way with the same interests. In fact it was practically parochial.\\" In 1917, she exhibited two works in the First Annual Exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists (April 10-May 6, 1917). Around 1917 Bacon also became interested in printmaking and taught herself drypoint as there was no one teaching etching at the Art Students League at the time. Bacon's first caricature prints were featured in single-issue, satirical magazine Bad News, which was published by Bacon and her fellow art students in 1918. Drypoint was Bacon's primary medium until 1927, and pastels until 1945. Although Bacon had trained as a painter, she eventually became famous for her satirical prints and drawings. Her caricatures were first published in a single issue spoof, entitled Bad News. Her early portrait caricatures in Bad News, like her early drypoints, depended upon a hard, controlling outline, filled in with shading or an obscure pattern. The intensity of the hues, the highly selective and organized palette, and her visually satisfying compositions all contribute to the high quality and formal aspects that distinguish Bacon's pastel portraits from others. Bacon was also featured in solo shows in prominent galleries such as; Stieglitz's Intimate Gallery, the Weyhe Gallery, and the Downtown Gallery. In the summer of 1919, Bacon studied with Andrew Dasburg, in Woodstock, New York. That same summer she was engaged to American painter Alexander Brook and the two married on May 4, 1920. After marrying, Bacon and Brook moved to London for a year, where their daughter, Belinda, was born. When they returned, the family divided their time between Greenwich Village and Woodstock, New York, two vibrant artist communities. In 1922 a son, Sandy, was born in Woodstock. In 1940, Bacon and her husband divorced. Bacon was a very prolific artist. In 1919, at the age of 24, she wrote and illustrated her first book, The True Philosopher and Other Cat Tales. She went on to illustrate over 60 books, 19 of which she also wrote, including a successful mystery book, The Inward Eye, which was nominated for an Edgar Allan Poe award in 1952 for best novel. Bacon's popular drawings appeared in magazines such as The New Yorker, New Republic, Fortune, and Vanity Fair and she exhibited in galleries and museums frequently. Bacon had over thirty solo exhibitions at such venues as Montross Gallery, Alfred Stieglitz's Intimate Gallery, and the Downtown Gallery. In 1934 Bacon was awarded the Guggenheim Fellowship for creative work in the graphic arts. During her time as a fellow she completed 35 satirical portraits of art world figures for a collection called Off With Their Heads!, which was published that same year by Robert M. McBride & Company. In 1942 she was granted an award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters and in 1980 the Academy awarded her a gold medal for her lifelong contribution to illustration and graphic art. In 1947, Bacon was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full member in 1969. In December 1975, the National Collection of Fine Arts, now the National Museum of American Art, honored Bacon with a yearlong retrospective exhibition titled, \\"Peggy Bacon: Personalities and Places.\\" Bacon was also a member of the Society of American Graphic Artists and participated in many of their annual exhibitions. In addition to her artistic career, Bacon taught extensively during the 1930s and 1940s at various institutions, including the Fieldston School, the Art Students League, Hunter College, the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, D.C., and summers at the School of Music and Art in Stowe, Vermont. Later life and legacy In the 1970s Bacon's eyesight began failing and she eventually went to live in Cape Porpoise, Maine. She died in 1987 at the age of 91 in Kennebunk, Maine. From June 27, 2012, to November 4, 2012, the Lawrence A. Fleischman Gallery at the Donald W. Reynolds Center for American Art and Portraiture exhibited ‚ÄúSix Degrees of Peggy Bacon.‚Äù The exhibit traced her associations using photographs, letters, graphics, and archival documents from the Archives of American Art to illustrate Bacon‚Äôs connection to dozens of other prominent artists.

Merrie Melodies animated short directed by Friz Freleng. The short was released on May 29, 1957, and stars Tweety and Sylvester the Cat. Audio from this cartoon was sampled by Paul McCartney on the song \\"Check My Machine\\", released in 1980 as the B-side to the single \\"Waterfalls\\". Plot The cartoon, set in a city zoo, begins with a tour guide showing various animal exhibits to visitors. The final stop (at least as far as viewers can see) is the exhibit featuring the \\"one and only example\\" of the Tweety Bird species. This draws tag-along tourist Sylvester's interest and becomes separated from the group. After the requisite \\"I tawt I taw a puddy tat\\" lines, Sylvester begins his latest pursuit. The attempts, all unsuccessful, are as follows: * Tweety taking refuge in the bear pit. Sylvester uses a net to try to capture the bird, but as the shifty Tweety dodges the net, the cat hits a bear with the net. The bear grabs the net, pulls Sylvester in and expresses his displeasure. * At feeding time, Sylvester hides in the zookeeper's meat cart. Hoping to get \\"fed\\" to Tweety, he instead is thrown to a pack of Bengal tigers. * Tweety hides in a hole inside the elephant's abode. Sylvester enters in search of his prey, but the elephant immediately covers the hole to protect the bird. After unsuccessfully trying to pry the elephant's leg off the hole, Sylvester kicks the elephant in the knee, stubbing his toes in the process. Sylvester uses a wind-up mouse to frighten the elephant, but instead of simply moving away, the elephant inadvertently jumps and lands on Sylvester, flattening the puss. * Sylvester catches Tweety walking along a bridge, and chases him onto a tree branch overlooking an alligator pond. While planning how to get in the pond without injury, a lion roars, scaring Sylvester and stopping him from pacing back and forth. Sylvester smashes an oar over the lion's head in anger, using the requisite \\"Ah, shaddap!\\". * In a second attempt to navigate the alligator pond, Sylvester uses a rowboat, unaware of his passenger, the lion from earlier has entered. However, he escapes upon discovering the lion. The boat consequently sinks under the lion's weight, and the alligators snap at the lion. Once the lion regains his senses and gets out of the water, he grabs Sylvester and, after letting the gators have another go at the cat, he kicks him back into the bear's pit, where the bear mauls the puddy again. * Sylvester pole-vaults across the alligator pond to grab Tweety, who is hiding in a tree. Instead, the jump is mistimed (Tweety dropped a banana peel) and the cat ends up in the water again, though he manages to fight off the gators with his now-broken pole. In the end, a frustrated Sylvester leaves the zoo and strikes birds off his diet list. In response, a cluster of birds land on his shoulders and head as he is walking away, muttering about his awful timing for going on a diet.

It was one of the first companies to develop computer control systems for industry, primarily the paper-making industry. The development of the control systems included the development of control software, and development of scanning sensors to measure different properties of paper. The company was acquired by Honeywell in at a price tag of almost At the acquisition, Measurex had 2,250 employees in 30 countries and revenue of $254 million. History Early years Measurex was conceived in 1967 by David A. \\"Dave\\" Bossen, then a sales manager at Industrial Nucleonics, and the new company opened its doors on January 18, 1968, in Santa Clara, California. It was first a garage set-up based on paper industry experiences (circa 1966) at 330 Mathew Street, but later moved several miles southwest to Cupertino to an old cannery property. Ground was broken for the new headquarters in July 1971 and it opened the following year. Its initial public offering of 60,000 shares was completed on March 28, 1972, trading as symbol MSRX on NASDAQ. In 1973, a plant was opened in Waterford, Ireland, in June and was added to the Cupertino campus. The use of mini-computers was a part of the business plan, and Measurex initially used the Hewlett Packard 2116B mini-computer in the MX1000 (1968) and MX2000 (1974)systems. Later on, with the MX2001 systems (1977), Measurex used the 21MX mini-computer. In 1978, was added in Cupertino, the Waterford plant expanded to , and a new facility in Ireland was constructed in Cork. By the end of the year, nearly 1,000 systems had been installed in 25 countries and Measurex had more than 1,800 employees worldwide. Starting with the MX2002 systems in 1980, Measurex started to use the DEC LSI 11. Intel based system was introduced with the MX2002 Vision systems (using Intel 8086) in 1983, but still with the LSI 11 as a Scanner Support Processor (SSP). The reason for keeping the older LSI 11 in the architecture, was the computer's ability of near real-time processing of gauge data and also the LSI 11's support for hardware interrupts. Acquisition of Devron Measurex acquired the British Columbia firm Devron-Hercules Inc. in 1991. Devron was a company specializing in solutions for Cross Directional optimization of the paper sheet in paper machines.  Acquisition of Roibox  In April 1993, Measurex acquired the Finnish company Roibox Oy, for approximately $1.7 million. Honeywell- Measurex Honeywell kept the name Measurex for a number of years after the acquisition, giving the subsidiary the name Honeywell-Measurex. Development of sensors Early sensors were almost exclusively based on continuous process pulp and paper making, beginning with basis weight, moisture, caliper and whiteness. Later sensors were developed for new industries, including tire calendaring, cigarette fill, aluminum rolling mill gage thickness and others. Some of the early sensors were based on emissions from radioactive source materials it would probably be difficult for a similar firm to experiment with today. Even with the regulatory and training burden, nuclear sources continue to be the core sensor for sheet moisture and basis weight. Service Measurex had a service business that was 40% of the annual revenue. Most of the mills at the time could not support computer control system, and at the same time get an up-time of 99% or better. Measurex provided dedicated, on- site service for this, since it was a very expensive investment for a mill to train a technician. Customers of Measurex systems reported that the dedication and expertise of the service organization was a considerable factor in creating the customer confidence that resulted in sales growth, especially the repeat sales that fueled the remarkable growth during the 25 years leading up to the acquisition by Honeywell. As founder Dave Bossen often told service personnel: \\"Our results are far greater with a superior field service organization working with average systems, compared to manufacturing superior systems, but installed and maintained by an average field service organization\\". Of course, he was also quite emphatic about having manufacturing produce superior systems as well, resulting in their standing as a lead supplier of quality and control systems for the paper industry. Results guarantee One business strategy for Measurex was the Result Guarantee, which allowed the customer to return the Measurex system. This allowed customers to gain confidence in the systems. In 1975 a company wide competition was held for employees to name the new street upon which the new Measurex facilities were built. None of the employee submittals was selected and founder Dave Bossen chose \\"1 Results Way\\" to amplify the company's commitment to results. (not quite the whole story, the selection committee gave the award for the name to the employee who submitted \\"Digital Drive\\" but Dave changed it to \\"Results Way,\\" stating that digital was a technology with only temporary relevance and what if the street had been named a few years earlier as \\"Analog Ave\\"?) Corporate campus The Measurex campus in Cupertino became the \\"Results Way Corporate Center,\\" owned by Embarcadero Capital Partners In 2011, Apple Inc. leased the property and it became the company's Results Way campus. Embarcadero sold the complex to New York City- based Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management in 2013.

He subsequently entered the office of Judge Collins, in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, with whom he read law for another year. He applied for admission to the Bar but the committee refused to examine him because of racial prejudice. In April 1865, Wright was sent by the American Missionary Society to Beaufort, South Carolina, as a teacher and laborer among the freed slaves. He remained in Beaufort until the Civil Rights Act passed. Then he returned to Montrose, Pennsylvania, and demanded an examination for the Bar. The Committee found him qualified, and recommended his admission to the Bar. He was admitted August 13, 1865, and was the first African American admitted to practice law in Pennsylvania. In April 1866, Wright was appointed by General Oliver Otis Howard, head of the Freedmen's Bureau in Beaufort, to be the legal adviser for the freedmen. In July 1868 he was elected to the Constitutional Convention of South Carolina. He was the convention vice-president and helped draft the judiciary section of the State Constitution, which remains today. Wright was soon afterward elected state senator from Beaufort County. On February 1, 1870, he was elected to the South Carolina Supreme Court. He served for seven years, until the white Democrats regained control of state government in 1877.

Built in 1902, as Works No. 780, the locomotive was originally called No. 4. There was an earlier Alice which was built in 1889 (Works No. 492), later renamed King of the Scarlets. Alice Class There were 15 similar engines supplied between 1886 and 1932, the first of which was Velinheli (Works No. 409 of 1886), but for some reason, the class was named after the first Alice. Over 46 years a number of changes were made to the design, some so substantial as to warrant an unofficial sub-class known as the Port Class. Alice no. 780 Alice, in common with most of the class, did not have a dome but a steam chamber produced by the firebox outer shell being raised some six inches above the boiler barrel. It was not usual to fit cabs to these engines since they had to work under incline bridges and through tunnels in the quarries. Alice spent all of its life working on various galleries at the Dinorwic slate quarry. The locomotive was in consequence rarely photographed. By the early 1960s the locomotive was out of use and was partially dismantled to provide spares for her sister locomotives at Dinorwic. She was parked in a shed at the Australia gallery. Restoration When the quarry at Dinorwic closed in 1969, Alice‚Äôs remains were still at the Australia gallery. The wheels and underparts had been salvaged and these were sold as spares for her sister locomotive Holy War. Holy War was the last steam locomotive to work in a slate quarry, ending her working life in November 1967. The locomotive was purchased, along with the spares from Alice, by J. Marshfield Hutchings and went to Quainton Road, Buckinghamshire. In 1975 Holy War and the spares from Alice were purchased by the Rev. Alan Cliff, Vice- President of the Bala Lake Railway Society and brought to Llanuwchllyn, the headquarters of the Bala Lake Railway, and were leased to the railway. In the meantime, Alice‚Äôs frames and tank were recovered and taken to the West Lancashire Light Railway at Hesketh Bank, near Preston. In 1977 these remains were acquired jointly by Alan Cliff and George Barnes, who was then the General Manager and Chief Mechanical Engineer of the Bala Lake Railway. Their acquisition meant that what remained of Alice was together again. The Bala Lake Railway was loaned the parts of Alice and announced that it intended to rebuild the locomotive as a tender locomotive. However, many other priorities made that intention impossible, although some work was done on the frames. In 1987, Chris Scott, then a Bala Lake Railway volunteer, bought the remains from Alan Cliff. The railway company had decided that it could not pursue the restoration, although it listed Alice as in their stock from 1977. Alan Cliff, who had been taken ill at the beginning of 1987 and forced to take early retirement, was in no position to spearhead a campaign to restore Alice, so when Scott offered to purchase the locomotive and seek to restore her, Alan and the Bala Lake Railway were delighted. What remained of Alice was later moved to Scott's garage. Preservation Chris Scott was at that time a volunteer fireman on the Ffestiniog Railway, and the first outing for Alice after her long restoration was in April 1994 on that railway, initially in the yard at Boston Lodge and later along the full length of the main line up to Blaenau Ffestiniog. On 19 June 1994 Alice arrived at the Leighton Buzzard Light Railway. Mrs Alice Hyde, whose son Bill was a driver on the Bala Lake Railway, had set up a bookstall to raise money for the locomotive‚Äôs restoration, and Scott promised that when the engine ran again it should be re-dedicated to and by its namesake and benefactor. During the railway‚Äôs Steam Gala event on 10 September 1994 Mrs Hyde, who had travelled down from Bala in North Wales, re-dedicated the name of the locomotive Alice. On the following day Alice worked her first passenger train, double-headed with Barclay steam locomotive Doll. Alice was later fitted with braking equipment and operated passenger trains on its own. Alice visited the Welsh Highland Railway on 19‚Äì20 September 1998 for the first Enthusiasts' Weekend. The loco was based at Leighton Buzzard for its first ten years of operation in preservation, following which it moved to Rheilffordd Llyn Tegid Bala Lake Railway, in 2003 where it was painted black. In 2010 the locomotive was purchased by Julian Birley and restored to Dinorwic red. 0-4-0ST locomotives Individual locomotives of Great Britain Preserved narrow gauge steam locomotives of Great Britain Hunslet narrow gauge locomotives 2 ft gauge locomotives Railway locomotives introduced in 1902 ","title":"Alice (locomotive)"},{"id":"18877258","text":"Azzedine Zerdoum (born 31 December 1977 in El-Hamma-Mhenchela) is a retired Algerian runner who specializes in the cross-country running.

This annual killifish inhabits ephemeral pools in semi-arid areas with scarce and erratic precipitations and have adapted to the routine drying of their environment by evolving desiccation-resistant eggs that can remain dormant in the dry mud for one and maybe more years by entering into diapause. Due to very short duration of the rain season, the natural lifespan of these animals is limited to a few months and their captive lifespan is likewise short, making them an attractive model system for ageing and disease research. Tandem repeats comprise 21% of the species' genome, an abnormally high proportion, which has been suggested as a factor in its fast ageing. Among vertebrates, the species has the fastest known sexual maturity ‚Äì only 14 days after hatching, and shortest lifespan ‚Äì ranging 3 to 12 months depending on the environment. More specifically, they are able to live 1‚Äì5 months in the wild (with most only living up to 4 months) and 3‚Äì16 months in captivity. They are able to live longer in captivity due to their diet, which is mostly bloodworms; this is due to dietary restrictions and antioxidant resveratrol supplements.

(Subscription needed) Her painting, Morning, was bought for the public by the Daily Mail in 1927. Procter and her husband attended art schools in England and in Paris together, where they were both influenced by Impressionism and the Post-Impressionism movements. They also worked together at times, sometimes sharing commissions and other times showing their work together in exhibitions. Procter was a lifelong artist, active after the untimely death of her husband in 1935. After Ernest's death, Procter travelled to the United States, Canada, Jamaica and Africa. She died in 1972 and is buried next to her husband at St Hilary Church, Cornwall. She was a member of several artists organisations, such as the Newlyn School and became President of St Ives Society of Artists (STISA) in 1966. Her work was exhibited at the Royal Academy on many occasions. Biography Early life and education Doris \\"Dod\\" Shaw was born in Hampstead, London in 1890. Her father was a ship's doctor and her mother was a former art student who had studied at the Slade School of Fine Art. The family moved to Tavistock in Devon, but after the death of her husband, Dod's mother moved the family to Newlyn in 1907. There, at the age of 15, Dod enrolled in the School of Painting run by Elizabeth Forbes and Stanhope Forbes. The Shaws stayed with two other Forbes students, Dod's cousin Cicely Jesse and another woman artist, Tennyson Jesse, in a large townhouse known as Myrtle Cottage. At Forbes, Dod met her future husband Ernest Procter; they were considered Forbes' star pupils. In Newlyn, Dod met Laura Knight, who became a lifelong friend and a considerable influence on her career. In 1910 Dod and her mother went to Paris where Dod, alongside Ernest Procter, studied at the Atelier Colarossi. Dod and Ernest were both influenced by Impressionism and Post-impressionism and the artists that they met in France, such as Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Paul C√©zanne. The couple married in 1912 at the church in Paul in Cornwall and a year later their son Bill was born. The family established a home at North Corner in Cornwall. Also in 1913, Dod Procter first exhibited at the Royal Academy of Art. During World War I Ernest served in France working with a Friends' Ambulance Unit detachment. The regular letters between the couple show Dod to be depressed at his absence as well as bored and short of money. After the war, the couple settled in Newlyn and this was the Procters' home for most of their working lives. 1920s In 1920 Dod and Ernest Procter were commissioned to decorate the Kokine Palace in Rangoon by a Chinese millionaire, Ching Tsong. The commission took a year and required them working with Burmese, Indian and Chinese craftsmen often painting murals at considerable heights within the palace. However Ching Tsong was unimpressed with their work and refused to pay them their agreed fees or provide accommodation so the Procters painted portraits of local people and members of the British colonial administration for an income. The Procters also created designs for etched crystal. Dod Procter; Morning. Bought for the nation by the Daily Mail in 1927. When she returned to England, Dod Procter began to focus on painting portraits, usually of young women. Throughout the 1920s Dod Procter continued to paint single female figures, sometimes nude, others in softly draped clothes. From around 1922, she painted a series of simplified, monumental images of young women of her acquaintance. They were typified by the volume of the figures, brought out by her use of light and shadow. The Back Bedroom (1926) and Girl on White (1923) were powerful, carefully observed portraits of young women. The Model, a portrait of a young women deep in concentration, was regarded as one of the best paintings shown at the Royal Academy in 1925. The model for the work was a Newlyn fisherman's 16-year-old daughter, Cissie Barnes, who also modelled, every day for five weeks, for Procter's best known work, Morning. When Morning, was displayed at the 1927 Royal Academy Summer Exhibition, it was voted Picture of the Year and bought by the Daily Mail for the Tate Gallery, where it now hangs. Procter sold the work for ¬£300, but could have achieved ten times that amount.Rhoda Koenig. \\"More than a one-hit wonder\\" , The First Post, p. 2. Retrieved 8 February 2010. Prior to its permanent hanging in the Tate, Morning was shown in New York, and then on a two-year tour of Britain. A second, smaller version of the painting, known as Early Morning, is held by the Royal Pavilion in Brighton. Both public and critics responded to Morning, praising its \\"sensuous but sombre style\\" which evoked the west Cornish \\"silver light\\". Frank Rutter, art critic of The Sunday Times, said in 1927 that Morning was \\"a new vision of the human figure which amounts to the invention of a twentieth century style in portraiture\\"Averil King. Apollo, \\"An exotic awakening\\", 1 January 2006. Retrieved from findarticles.com (registration required), 8 August 2008. and \\"She has achieved apparently with consummate ease that complete presentation of twentieth century vision in terms of plastic design after which Derain and other much praised French painters have been groping for years past.\\"Elsie M. Lang, British Women in the Twentieth Century, Kessinger Publishing, 2003. Despite this, a number of the nude paintings by Procter that accompanied Morning on tour were deemed unsuitable for display by some venues. Also considered controversial was Procter's 1929 submission to the Royal Academy. Virginal showed a young female nude holding a dove and when the Academy rejected the painting the story was reported in the several national newspapers. As well as Cissie Barnes other women who modelled for Procter included the artist Midge Bruford and also Eileen Mayo, who had come to Newlyn to model for Laura Knight and became an artist in her own right. 1930s In the 1930s Dod Procters' style of painting changed completely. Works such as The Orchard (1934), Sheila Among the Ferns (1935) and Kitchen at Myrtle Cottage (1935) display the meticulous finish and lighting of her earlier work but without her previous hard lines and solidly delineated bodies of colour. Ernest Procter died unexpectedly while travelling in 1935. The couple had often staged joint exhibitions at the Leicester Galleries and Dod continued to do so after Ernest's death. In 1938, Proctor decided to move to Zennor, near her friend, the artist Alethea Garstin. The subjects of her pictures were largely portraits and flowers.Averil King (2005), Newlyn Flowers: The Floral Works of Dod Procter, RA. Philip Wilson Publishers, Garstin's influence was apparent in Procter's work in the latter part of her career. She became a full member of the Royal Academy in 1942. In 1945 she illustrated a colored frontispiece and line drawings for a story by Clare Collas, A Penny for the Guy. Procter visited Tenerife in 1938 and again, with her friend, the artist Jeanne du Maurier, in 1946. In 1948, she visited Basutoland and in 1964 went to Tanganyika. During the 1950s Procter spent some time in Jamaica, with Garstin, where she mainly painted portraits of children. During her lifetime and after her death her work fell out of favour.Alison James (2007). A Singular Vision: Dod Procter 1890-1972, Sansom & Company Ltd.

The line is operationally part of the Yosan Line, and retains it separate name due to the Japanese naming convention which requires a formal change of name, which has not occurred in this case. Services The line is served by Limited Express trains between Okayama (Shiokaze trains, one round-trip a day), Takamatsu (Ishizuchi trains, two Takamatsu-bound trains a day) or Matsuyama (Uwakai trains, 14 return trips and two Uwajima-bound trains a day) and Uwajima, and Local trains between Matsuyama or Iyoshi and Iyo-≈åzu, Yawatahama or Uwajima. Stations History The line was originally built by the as a light railway line from , near Nagahama-machi (the present Iyo-Nagahama) to Uchiko, opening on May 1, 1920.

That day, the line from Gor≈ç to Uchiko gained its own identity as the Uchiko Line. Freight operations ceased on December 1, 1971. On November 25, 1985, the line was closed and the passenger service was replaced by buses to allow heavier rails to be laid, the railbed to be strengthened, and curves to be relaxed. The next year, on March 3, the line between Uchiko and Niiya, together with new sections of the Yosan Main Line from Mukaibara and Niiya to Iyo-≈åzu, opened as a shortcut route between Matsuyama and Uwajima, with new passing facilities at Niiya, relocated stations at Uchiko and Ikazaki, and Centralised Traffic Control. The section from Niiya to Gor≈ç was closed. In 1987 JNR was regionalised and privatised, and the Uchiko Line came under the control of Shikoku Railway Company, with Japan Freight Railway Company operating services on the line.

Soil moisture sensors measure the volumetric water content in soil. Since the direct gravimetric measurement of free soil moisture requires removing, drying, and weighing of a sample, soil moisture sensors measure the volumetric water content indirectly by using some other property of the soil, such as electrical resistance, dielectric constant, or interaction with neutrons, as a proxy for the moisture content. The relation between the measured property and soil moisture must be calibrated and may vary depending on environmental factors such as soil type, temperature, or electric conductivity. Reflected microwave radiation is affected by the soil moisture and is used for remote sensing in hydrology and agriculture. Portable probe instruments can be used by farmers or gardeners. Soil moisture sensors typically refer to sensors that estimate volumetric water content. Another class of sensors measure another property of moisture in soils called water potential; these sensors are usually referred to as soil water potential sensors and include tensiometers and gypsum blocks. Technology Technologies commonly used to indirectly measure volumetric water content (soil moisture) include: * Frequency Domain Reflectometry (FDR): The dielectric constant of a certain volume element around the sensor is obtained by measuring the operating frequency of an oscillating circuit. * Time Domain Transmission (TDT) and Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR): The dielectric constant of a certain volume element around the sensor is obtained by measuring the speed of propagation along a buried transmission line; (see also: TDR moisture sensor) * Neutron moisture gauges: The moderator properties of water for neutrons are utilized to estimate soil moisture content between a source and detector probe. * Soil resistivity: Measuring how strongly the soil resists the flow of electricity between two electrodes can be used to determine the soil moisture content. *Galvanic cell: The amount of water present can be determined based on the voltage the soil produces because water acts as an electrolyte and produces electricity. The technology behind this concept is the galvanic cell. Application Agriculture Measuring soil moisture is important for agricultural applications to help farmers manage their irrigation systems more efficiently. Knowing the exact soil moisture conditions on their fields, not only are farmers able to generally use less water to grow a crop, they are also able to increase yields and the quality of the crop by improved management of soil moisture during critical plant growth stages. Landscape irrigation In urban and suburban areas, landscapes and residential lawns are using soil moisture sensors to interface with an irrigation controller. Connecting a soil moisture sensor to a simple irrigation clock will convert it into a \\"smart\\" irrigation controller that prevents irrigation cycles when the soil is already wet, e.g. following a recent rainfall event. Kevin Handreck. Good Gardens with Less Water, Csiro Publishing, 2008 pages 79-81 Golf courses are using soil moisture sensors to increase the efficiency of their irrigation systems to prevent over-watering and leaching of fertilizers and other chemicals into the ground. Research Soil moisture sensors are used in numerous research applications, e.g. in agricultural science and horticulture including irrigation planning, climate research, or environmental science including solute transport studies and as auxiliary sensors for soil respiration measurements.Decagon Devices \\"List of peer-reviewed publications using Decagon soil moisture sensors\\". Retrieved: 20 July 2015.

St. Mary's Parish was created in 1834 as Rochester's second Roman Catholic parish, after St. Patrick's Parish. Description The cornerstone of the church was blessed 18 September 1853 by Bishop of Buffalo John Timon (the Diocese of Rochester was not formed until 1868). The building was dedicated, with Timon presiding, on 24 October 1858. The architect of the church is unknown, but design influences of Richard Upjohn and other church architects are apparent. It was where celebrated actress and ballerina Giuseppina Morlacchi and cowboy scout and actor Texas Jack Omohundro were married on August 31st 1873. A brick rectory was built in 1905, replacing an earlier rectory. A spire and belfry, designed by Richard B. Arnold, were added in 1939-1940, and a 10-note Deagan tower chime was installed in time to be played for Christmas 1939. The north tower may have been intended to have a spire originally, but financial difficulties may have precluded adding it earlier. The original cross atop the spire was felled in 2017 by a windstorm, its copper cladding having long since turned green with corrosion; it was replaced with a new gilded cross in June 2018. The church and rectory were added to the National Register of Historic Places on 12 March 1992.

Three Spokane parishes, All Saints Cathedral, St. Peter's, and St. James, merged on October 20, 1929 to form the Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist. Construction began on the present cathedral four years previous in 1925 and was structurally completed in less than a generation under the supervision of founding architect Harold C. Whitehouse of the Spokane firm of Whitehouse & Price. It is located in the Rockwood neighborhood, south of downtown. Built entirely of cut stone, the carvings, and the figures in stained glass, include symbols of many faiths. Especially notable are carvings by Ole Sunde of Seattle and by Arcangelo Cascieri and Adio diBaccari of Boston, Mass. The stained glass windows, in classic Gothic style, are the work of the Charles J. Connick firm, and since its closure of the work of Willet Hauser Architectural Glass. The Cathedral Organ, with 4,039 pipes, designed, built and installed in 1957 by the Aeolian- Skinner Company (Opus 1343) to interpret the whole range of organ literature and renovated in 2000 by Marceau & Associates, is so skillfully voiced that even the smallest pipes can be heard in every corner of the building. Recitals are scheduled throughout the year. Bishop Cross Tower, named to honor the Cathedral's founder, houses a 49-bell carillon, one of only a handful in the Northwest, cast and installed by the English firm of John Taylor & Sons. Carillon concerts are played at Sunday services, at times of religious and civic festivals, and other times as announced. The carillon is best heard from outside on the Cathedral Close (nearby grounds). The first Dean of the Cathedral was Richard Coombs, who relocated to Spokane in 1956 from Saint Paul's Episcopal Church in Salinas, California. The Cathedral is open Monday through Friday, 9am-4pm. Guided tours are often available on Fridays, 11am-2pm. On Sundays, guided tours usually are available immediately after the last morning worship service. The tour usually lasts around 45 minutes.https://stjohns-cathedral.org/tours The elevation at street level is approximately above sea level.

Tire-derived fuel (TDF) is composed of shredded scrap tires. Tires may be mixed with coal or other fuels, such as wood or chemical wastes, to be burned in concrete kilns, power plants, or paper mills. An EPA test program concluded that, with the exception of zinc emissions, potential emissions from TDF are not expected to be very much different from other conventional fossil fuels, as long as combustion occurs in a well-designed, well-operated and well-maintained combustion device.http://www.epa.gov/ttncatc1/dir1/tire_eng.pdf In the United States in 2017, about 43% of scrap tires (1,736,340 tons or 106 million tires) were burnt as tire-derived fuel. Cement manufacturing was the largest user of TDF, at 46%, pulp and paper manufacturing used 29% and electric utilities used 25%. Another 25% of scrap tires were used to make ground rubber, 17% were disposed of in landfills and 16% had other uses. Theory Historically, there has not been any volume use for scrap tires other than burning that has been able to keep up with the volume of waste generated yearly. Tires produce the same energy as petroleum and approximately 25% more energy than coal. Burning tires is lower on the hierarchy of reducing waste than recycling, but it is better than placing the tire waste in a landfill or dump, where there is a possibility for uncontrolled tire fires or the harboring of disease vectors such as mosquitoes.http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/muncpl/tires/tdf.htm Tire Derived Fuel is an interim solution to the scrap tire waste problem. Advances in tire recycling technologyhttp://news.discovery.com/tech/tech-to- end-tire-burning.html might one day provide a solution other than burning by reusing tire derived material in high volume applications. Characteristics Tire derived fuel is usually consumed in the form of shredded or chipped material with most of the metal wire from the tire's steel belts removed. The analytical properties of this refined material are published in TDF Produced From Scrap Tires with 96+% Wire Removed.http://www.p2pays.org/ref/11/10504/html/usa/tdfdata.htm Tires are typically composed of about 1 to 1.5% Zinc oxide,http://www.ncagr.gov/agronomi/pdffiles/rubber.pdf which is a well known component used in the manufacture of tires and is also toxic to aquatic and plant life. The chlorine content in tires is due primarily to the chlorinated butyl rubber liner that slows the leak rate of air. The Rubber Manufacturers Association (RMA) is a very good source for compositional data and other information on tires. The use of TDF for heat production is controversial due to the possibility for toxin production. Reportedly, polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and furans are produced during the combustion process and there is supportive evidence to suggest that this is true under some incineration conditions. Other toxins such as NOx, SOx and heavy metals are also produced, though whether these levels of toxins are higher or lower than conventional coal and oil fired incinerators is not clear.http://www.energyjustice.net/tires/ Controversy While environmental controversy surrounding use of this fuel is wide and varied, the greatest supported evidence of toxicity comes from the presence of dioxins and furans in the flue gases. Zinc has also been found to dissolve into storm water, from shredded rubber, at acutely toxic levels for aquatic life and plants.Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection Field Study: www.ct.gov/dep/lib/dep/artificialturf/dep_artificial_turf_report.pdf A study of dioxin and furan contenthttp://www.energyjustice.net/tires/#16 of stack gasses at a variety of cement mills, paper mills, boilers, and power plants conducted in the 1990s shows a wide and inconsistent variation in dioxin and furan output when fueled partially by TDF as compared to the same facilities powered by only coal. Some facilities added as little as 4% TDF and experienced as much as a 4,140% increase in dioxin and furan emissions. Other facilities added as much as 30% TDF and experienced dioxin and furan emissions increases of only as much as 58%. Still other facilities used as much as 8% TDF and experienced a decrease of as much as 83% of dioxin and furan emissions. One facility conducted four tests with two tests resulting in decreased emissions and two resulting in increased emissions. Another facility also conducted four tests and had widely varying increases in emissions. A 2004 study of Tire rubber use in energy generation,http://viewer.zoho.com/docs/sa7Pp deeply studies the environmental impact on soil, water, and air from combustion of waste rubber (TDF). Alvarez research shows that huge polyaromatic emissions are generated from combustion of tire rubber, at a minimum, 2 orders of magnitude higher than coal alone. The study concludes with, \\"atmospheric contamination dramatically increases when tire rubber is used as the fuel. Other different combustion variables compared to the ones used for coal combustion should be used to avoid atmospheric contamination by toxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic pollutants, as well as hot- gas cleaning systems and COx capture systems.\\" References Fuels Chemical engineering Tires ","title":"Tire-derived fuel"},{"id":"18877743","text":"John Anscombe (4 January 1838 ‚Äì 2 March 1881) was an English first-class cricketer who played for Sussex County Cricket Club.

He was born in BacƒÉu and played youth football for Lazio, before beginning a career in Ireland in 2001. Throughout his career there, he has played for Drogheda Town, Bray Wanderers, Monaghan United, Drogheda United, Dundalk and Bray Wanderers. He has made three appearances in the UEFA Europa League throughout his career and was a member of Dundalk's squad when they became the first Irish side to reach the play-off round of the UEFA Champions League in August 2016.https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36960620 Early life Sava was born in BacƒÉu, Romania and raised in Rome, Italy. He played youth football for Lazio. In 2001, his family were invited to visit some Italian friends living in Dublin, and his brother was offered a job as a chef at their restaurant in Drogheda. Sava decided to move to Drogheda along with his brother. His first club in Ireland was Albion Rovers before signing for Drogheda United U17s under the management of Paddy Mooney. Professional career Drogheda Town After leaving the youth teams of Drogheda United, Sava began playing non-league football with Drogheda Town. He impressed many with a good performance in the 2008 FAI Cup Third Round for Drogheda Town against Bohemians which gave him a platform to launch a career in the League of Ireland. Bohemians were 3‚àí0 winners on the day, but Sava was named man of the match, and in July 2008 Bray Wanderers signed him for the remainder of the season. Bray Wanderers Sava was third-choice goalkeeper behind Alan Gough and Chris O'Connor for the 2008 season. He was restricted to just two friendly games against Millwall and Leeds United, as well as four appearances as an unused substitute. Drogheda United Sava was signed by Paul Doolin for Drogheda United before the 2009 season, however his first-team opportunities were extremely limited due to the form of Dan Connor and Mikko Vilmunen. In addition to this, Sava suffered a wrist injury that kept him out of action for eight months. Monaghan United In February 2010, Sava signed for First Division side Monaghan United. He kept seven clean sheets in his first seven games for the club, and established himself as first-choice goalkeeper under manager Mick Cooke, making 61 league appearances over the next two seasons. In 2010, Sava played in the League of Ireland Cup final, a game Monaghan lost 1‚àí0 to Sligo Rovers. In 2011, he helped the club to promotion from the First Division. Return to Drogheda United In December 2011, Sava left Monaghan to follow his ex-boss, Mick Cooke, and return to Drogheda United. He made his debut on the opening night of the 2012 season and made 29 league appearances as Drogheda finished second in the Premier Division behind Sligo Rovers. Sava also picked up a League Cup winner's medal as Drogheda overcame Shamrock Rovers in the final. His form throughout the season was rewarded when he was named RT√â Monday Night Soccer's Goalkeeper of the Year, and nominated for the Airtricity/Irish Soccer Writers Goalkeeper of the Year award. At the end of the season, Sava went on trial to BK Hacken for a time.https://www.irishmirror.ie/sport/soccer/soccer-news/swede-smell-success ---drogheda-2023723 Sava re-signed for Drogheda for the 2013 season and made a further 20 league appearances for the club. He also played in Drogheda's Setanta Cup final defeat to Shamrock Rovers and in both legs of the Europa League First Qualifying Round tie against Malmo FF of Sweden. However, he fell out of favour in the latter months of the season and was on the bench for the 2013 League Cup and FAI Cup finals. Dundalk Sava left Drogheda at the end of the 2013 season and on 7 January 2014 he was signed for County Louth rivals Dundalk by Stephen Kenny. Sava failed to make an appearance in the league throughout the 2014 season as Peter Cherrie remained first-choice at the club, however he started every game in Dundalk's League Cup campaign which ended with a 3‚àí2 victory over Shamrock Rovers in the final. He also added another medal to his collection as Dundalk won the Premier Division title on the last day of the season. Sava signed a new contract for the 2015 season and went on to make three league appearances for the club, keeping two clean sheets, as Dundalk once more won the Premier Division title. In 2016, Sava again found himself second-choice behind Gary Rogers, thus missing out on the chance to appear in their Champions League qualifiers as they reached the play-off round. After a number of high-profile errors from Rogers, most notably against Sligo Rovers in a 3‚àí0 defeat on 8 October 2016, Sava was handed a start in the crucial top-of-the-table match with Cork City and kept a clean sheet. Bray Wanderers On 16 December 2018 Sava re-signed for First Division side Bray Wanderers.https://braywanderersfc.ie/gabriel-sava-joins- wanderers/ He made his debut on 23 February in a 3-0 win over Cabinteely.http://www.extratime.ie/articles/22382/league-report-cabinteely-0 ---3-bray-wanderers/ A week later Sava saved a penalty in a match against Limerick with the score at 0-0, Bray went on to win 2-0.http://www.extratime.ie/articles/22427/league-report-bray-wanderers-2--- 0-limerick/ On 1 April Bray beat Shamrock Rovers 4-2 on penalties in the EA Sports Cup after the match ended 0-0 with Sava producing a man of the match performance including a save in the shoot out.http://www.extratime.ie/articles/22605/ea-sports-cup-report-bray- wanderers-0---0-shamrock-rovers-bray-win-4-2-on-penalties/ Sava made 24 league appearances over the course of the season, as Bray disappointingly missed out on the playoffs.https://ie.soccerway.com/players/gabriel-sava/121512/ Warrenpoint Town On the 12th February 2020 it was announced that Sava had signed for NIFL Premiership side Warrenpoint Town.https://warrenpointtownfc.co.uk/gabriel-sava-signs-for-warrenpoint-town/ Honours Club ;Drogheda United *League of Ireland Cup: 2012 ;Dundalk * League of Ireland Premier Division: 2014, 2015, 2016, 2018 * FAI Cup: 2015, 2018 * League of Ireland Cup: 2014 * President's Cup: 2015 References External links *FAI Stats Portal Profile 1986 births Living people People from BacƒÉu Romanian footballers Romanian expatriate footballers Romanian expatriate sportspeople in Ireland Expatriate association footballers in the Republic of Ireland League of Ireland players Bray Wanderers F.C. players Drogheda United F.C. players Monaghan United F.C. players Warrenpoint Town F.C. players NIFL Premiership players Dundalk F.C. players Romanian people of Italian descent Association football goalkeepers ","title":"Gabriel Sava"},{"id":"18877749","text":"Ba≈üarat (also, Basharat and Basharrat) is a village in the Qubadli Rayon of Azerbaijan.

It is on the R680 regional road. The town is 36km from Dungarvan and 8km from Waterford. Amenities Kilmeadan is also the site of St. Mary's Church, a Church of Ireland Chapel, located in the north-western part of the village, Old Kilmeaden, near the railway station, on the R680 regional road towards Carrick-On-Suir. The school serving the Kilmeadan area is found in Ballyduff, a neighbouring village, which is also home to the Catholic Church of the area, St. Nicholas' Church. Both the GAA and soccer teams of the area are also named Ballyduff Lower GAA and Ballyduff AFC respectively. Transport Kilmeadan, lying in a linear pattern along the R680 (former N25 national primary road section), was previously home to a train station on the line from Waterford City to Mallow Junction in County Cork. In 2003 a section of the line was reopened as a narrow gauge attraction, known as the Waterford and Suir Valley Railway. As part of the new Waterford City bypass, Kilmeadan is now bypassed by a dual-carriageway section of the N25. This brings relief to the previously overcrowded road through the village, now reclassified as R680. Industry Throughout much of the twentieth century, Kilmeadan was also home to a farming co-operative. The farmers of the area sold their produce (mostly butter and milk) to the co-op, and as it expanded, a general store was opened in May 1920, which is still present today as a Centra outlet. In 1964, all of the co-ops in Waterford amalgamated, and was registered as Waterford Co-op. This led to the construction of a cheese factory on a green field site opposite the general store, and Kilmeadan cheese would go on to win a gold and bronze medal in the World Cheese Awards in London in 2005. However, production of the cheese ceased at the Kilmeadan plant in 2005, and the production of Kilmeadan Cheese moved to Ballyragget, County Kilkenny. Kilmeadan is also the site of the East Waterford Water Treatment Plant. This plant is operated by Waterford County Council and provides water mainly for Waterford City and the surrounding areas. The area also has a small retail outlet in the Kilmeadan Village Centre, located directly on the R680 in the village. This building provides retails space (for shops) and residential space (rental apartments). Tourism Mount Congreve house and gardens Mount Congreve woodland garden The Mount Congreve estate lies just outside the village, on the Old Kilmeadan Road. Owned and run by the late Ambrose Congreve (1907‚Äì2011), Mount Congreve is known for its rare species of plants and plant nurseries. It consists of around seventy acres of intensively planted woodland garden and a four-acre walled garden. In addition there are an 18th-century house (the ancestral home of the Congreve family), a number of glasshouses, more than 16 miles of paths and a wholesale nursery. After Congreves' death, Mount Congreve estate was left to the Irish State. Whilst the gardens are open to the public, the house is not. Kilmeadan is home to Cullenagh Stables,http://cullenagh.blogspot.ie a livery yard and working farm located on the banks of the River Dawn. Equestrian trails follow woodland and riverside paths, flanked by sites such as the old mill and chimney at Fairbook, the Queen Ann Way - a stopping point on the former Waterford, Dungarvan and Lismore Railway Line, the spa well at Gortnaclode and the remains of the Mill Street houses. Cullenagh formed part of the St Leger (Viscount Doneraile) Estate until 1850. The mill, which first produced paper, was founded by William Phair, who called it after himself, Phair Brook, later to become 'Fairbrook'. By 1824, there were 140 men, women and children working there. It closed in 1840 as a result of a legal dispute. In 1847, Patrick Stephenson bought it and used it during the Great Famine to grind Indian corn. Later he established a woollen mill. In 1875, the mill was taken over by Patrick Stephenson's two sons. Also on the banks of the River Dawn lies 'Fairbrook House and Gardens'. Seven acres of a former woollen mill have been changed into a walled garden by the Dutch artists Wout Muller and Clary Mastenbroek. Established in 1994, it has evolved over the years and stones from former buildings have been recycled into walls, raised borders, obelisks and standing stones. From May 2003 the small gallery was extended as a museum, for contemporary figurative art.

Playing career Cottrill started playing badminton as a 10-year-old and subsequently won a string of English National junior titles, winning the boys doubles at U12, U14, U16 & U18 and the mixed doubles at U14 & U18. Neil represented England at all age groups in events around Europe as a junior, winning the boys doubles in the U16 6 nations, Dutch junior, Danish Junior and won a bronze medal in the U18 European Junior (as an U17). Unfortunately his doubles partner, John Quinn suffered a long-term knee injury during the U18 season, leaving him without a regular partner for two years. Once John recovered, the pair quickly became one of the top pairs in the United Kingdom, winning numerous county events, Friends Provident Grand Slam Series events and reaching the 1995 English National Badminton Championships men's doubles final, losing to Chris Hunt & Simon Archer. Neil & John then went on the European Badminton Union circuit, where they were 1993 Czech Open champions. They soon progressed onto the World Grand Prix circuit, competing all round the world achieving a highest IBF men's doubles ranking of #12 in 1996. In 1995 they helped England inflict a rare defeat to China. The pair were in the GB Olympic squad and set for Olympic qualification for the Atlanta Games in 1996, but Neil was hit with a virus linked to over training which left him unable to train or compete for the six months prior to the games, leaving their participation impossible. Coaching Neil retired from full-time badminton in August 1996 and became a lecturer in Sport & Exercise Science in North Wales. He also started a sports science support and coaching business in 1996 where he has worked with a number of athletes from different sports, improving their fitness and dietary practice. The Welsh Badminton Union secured Neil's services to head up their High Performance Centre in North Wales and after working for the WBU for a few years, Neil teamed up with then National coach Chris Rees in the men's doubles at the Welsh Nationals, where they won the event from 1999‚Äì2002. Neil also won the mixed doubles with Jo Muggeridge on 2 occasions. Following this return to performance badminton, Neil represented the Welsh team at World and European team competition with his last appearance being at the 2002 Commonwealth games in his home city of Manchester. Following Neil's badminton career, he moved into education and has spent the majority of his career to date as a lecturer in Sport & Exercise Science. Neil led the development of the BSc(Hons) degree in Sports Coaching & Exercise Science initially for the University of Wales, then Bangor University, for which he was the Programme Leader. During this time he completed an MSc in Exercise & Nutrition Science and specialises in Dietary Analysis and Training and Recovery. Over the last few years, Neil has taken up a role at Badminton England where he is the Head of Coaching, helping to provide coaches with the opportunity to develop their skills and experience at all levels. Neil works out of the National Badminton Centre in Milton Keynes and still works with performance badminton players in North Wales.

Etymology There are many accounts of the origin of the city, but the most likely is a version by Tamilla Khalilova. Since the 7th century, conquest of the South Caucasus by Arabs began. According to historical data the Arabs reached a territory of present Qusar Rayon. According to the historians version name of the river is originated from Arabian Al-Qausar. In translation from the Quran into English ‚ÄúAl Qausar ‚Äì in translation means a river of abundance, that is a heaven river, water of which is whiter than milk and sweeter than honey. Its fragrance is nicer than musk and birds with beautiful long necks like necks of camels fly around it.‚Äù–°–º—ã—Å–ª–æ–≤–æ–π –ø–µ—Ä–µ–≤–æ–¥ —Å–≤—è—â–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ö–æ—Ä–∞–Ω–∞ –Ω–∞ —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π —è–∑—ã–∫ –ö—É–ª–∏–µ–≤–∞ –≠–ª—å–º–∏—Ä–∞ The settlement got its name from the river ‚Äì Qusar.

History Early life Carl Williams was born in Costa Rica to a Panamanian father and Costa Rican mother. The family migrated to the United States in the late 1960s, and he grew up in the Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn.From here to infinity Karl Kani. By: Muhammad, Tariq K., Black Enterprise, 00064165, Jun96, Vol. 26, Issue 11 Early career At age 16, Williams started designing clothes after learning the essential handcraft at his father's company. He never studied tailoring or design, but he had flair for coming up with unusual concepts. He would buy material and tell a tailor exactly how he wanted his garments to look. \\"For a relatively small sum\\", as he put it, \\"I had a fresh outfit that nobody had.\\" After seeing him on the scene in local clubs, men started asking for a Carl Williams outfit of their own. Soon he was taking his first orders in his car. The death of one of his close friends inspired some deep contemplation. \\"It made me think about life differently\\", he added \\" I thought I should really do something positive.\\" In 1989 he went to Los Angeles, where he and a friend opened a clothing shop on Crenshaw Boulevard. They made no profit at this location, and after the shop was robbed, they moved to Hollywood, where he started selling catalogs for $2 that he and his partner had put together. They only made profit from the catalog sales and did not sell any clothes. He decided to take out an advertisement in Right On! Magazine, but that did not jumpstart sales. Karl Kani Infinity After watching The Today Show, Kani had the idea of paying a friend in New York to make a sign with his label's name on it and hold it up during the taping of the show. The idea worked as people started calling and orders began to come in. In addition to working with a mainstream color selection, Kani modified the baggy pants that had become the basis of street fashion. According to him, black people never liked tight-fitting jeans. They would always buy a bigger size but then the waist would be too big, so he decided to increase the pant size. In 1994, Kani used $500,000 in profits to launch his company \\"Karl Kani Infinity\\". In addition to his old partners, Kani now faced a marketing onslaught from hip-hop entrepreneur Russell Simmons's Phat Farm and a number of mainstream clothiers. He also had reason to worry that his involvement in Cross Colours might taint his operation in the minds of retailers. \\"I expected some resistance,\\" Kani said. \\"A major turning point for me was when retailers accepted us back into the market.\\" Staying ahead of fashion counterfeiters who aped his signature and sold cheaper versions of his clothes, Kani began fastening a metal-and-leather plate to his product. After some resistance from the people who made the plates, Kani decided to go ahead with it and it turned out to be his best-selling jeans ever. A sister brand, Kani Ladies, was launched in 2001. Karl Kani Big & Tall The idea for the big & tall line came to Kani after numerous conversations with National Basketball Association stars, who complained that they could not fit into much of his merchandise. Big and tall people may be just as fashion-conscious as anyone else, so Kani launched his line in mid-1995 in big & tall stores around the country. Brand name Carl Williams, the son of a Costa Rican mother and Panamanian father, comes from a modest family from Brooklyn, New York. When he was young, he dreamed of combining his passion for hip hop music and fashion. During Williams's rough start in Los Angeles, the question that had obsessed him for years, \\"Can I do it?\\", remained unanswered. He kept asking himself: \\"Can I do it? Can I build a fashion empire? Can I become the 'Ralph Lauren of the streets'?\\" He didn't have the answer for these questions, but it did provide the basis for his new name, Kani, a variation on \\"Can I?\\". Legacy He began a trend of merging hip-hop with fashion. He spotted an area in the market that had been ignored and paved the way for other hip hop fashion brands. Awards Black Enterprise magazine named Karl Kani Infinity Corporation the most successful Black owned firm worldwide in 1996. In 2002 Kani was honored with an Urban Fashion Pioneer Award for his lifetime achievements, at the Urban Fashion Awards.

Cochrane is an Olympic silver and bronze medallist as well as a triple gold medallist from the Pan Pacific Swimming Championships. He is also a four-time Commonwealth Games champion in the 400-metre and 1,500-metre having won both medals in 2010 and 2014. He holds six world championship medals from the 800-metre and 1500-metre, this also makes Cochrane Canada's all-time leading medallist for a swimmer at the World Aquatics Championships. Cochrane also won gold medals in the 400 and 1,500 m freestyle at the 2015 Pan American Games in Toronto, as well as a bronze in the 4 x 200 m freestyle at the 2015 Games. From the year 2008 - 2015, Cochrane was named the Canadian male swimmer of the year - winning the award 8 times in a row. Life and career As a sixteen-year-old Cochrane competed at the 2005 Canada Games for British Columbia. In those games he won five medals including two gold in the 800- and 1,500-metre freestyle events. He rose to prominence in the Canadian sporting and aquatic world when he competed in the 2008 Summer Olympics starting in the 400 m freestyle. There he finished ninth in the heats with a Canadian record time of 3:44.85 and failed to qualify for the final. Cochrane also competed in the 1500 m freestyle where he briefly held the Olympic record after swimming a time of 14:40.84 in the heats. This record was soon broken by previous record holder Grant Hackett, who swam a time of 14:38.92. He qualified in second position for the final, and won the bronze medal on August 17. It was the first Olympic medal for a Canadian swimmer since the 1996 Summer Olympics. It was the first medal for Canada in the 1500m freestyle in 88 years.NBC Television, Olympics Evening, 16 August 2008 Building on Olympic success Cochrane was able to back up his performance from the Olympics at the 2009 World Aquatics Championships. There he swam to a bronze in the 800-metre freestyle and a silver in his best event the 1500-metre freestyle. At the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi, India, Cochrane won Canada's first gold medal of those games in the 400-metre freestyle during the first day of competition. Cochrane also became the first Canadian man in 72 years to win gold in the 400-metre freestyle at the Commonwealth Games. He then went on to win another gold medal at those games, this time in the 1500-metre freestyle. Cochrane next competed at the 2011 World Aquatics Championships where he opened up with a fifth-place finish in the 400-metre freestyle. Next up was one of his medal hopeful events in the 800-metre freestyle where he lowered his Canadian record to 7:41.86. However this was only good enough for second, as despite staying close to the hometown favourite of Shanghai Sun Yang ultimately took the gold for China. Of the silver medal Cochrane said that \\"The goal was to win but I'm happy to progress from the last two years. It shows that I'm in it. I have a little more work to do to catch Sun Yang but I'm not out of it by any means.\\" He next competed in the 1500-metre freestyle in Shanghai where he again finished second behind Sun who swam to a world record time. Of a second finish behind Sun, Cochrane could only say that \\"He shows that he's had that much more base-work training and he can get to that world record, which is fantastic. I think it's great, especially for the distance events because everyone's been talking about this world record year after year and there's more pressure that's built up...He's showed amazing stroke and amazing ability.\\" The 2012 Summer Olympics began with Cochrane competing on the first day of competition in the 400-metre freestyle. There Cochrane won his heat and qualified in the last spot for the final. However, after Park Tae-hwan's disqualification was overturned, Cochrane was pushed out of the final and missed swimming in it by 1/100th of a second. He next entered his signature event the 1500-metre where he qualified through the heats in third place. In the final Cochrane managed to outswim Oussama Mellouli for the silver medal and achieved it in a personal best time. With his second medal at his second consecutive Olympics, according to media such as the CBC this cemented Cochrane as Canada's pillar athlete to build its swimming team around for the future as he declared that he would try and swim for Canada at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Surpassing Hayden's World's medal tally The post-London Olympics period saw Cochrane's first real test arrive at the 2013 World Aquatics Championships in Barcelona. He swam in the 400-metre and posted the second fastest time in qualifying, earning him one of the centre lane spots beside Sun. However, he finished fourth in the finals, unable to beat the American and Japanese swimmers. In the 800-metre freestyle, with Sun again far ahead, there was a four-way race for second through fifth. This time, Cochrane achieved a bronze medal (his fifth medal), tying the Canadian record held at the time by Brent Hayden. Cochrane would later break Hayden's medal record in the 1500-metre race. In this event, he avoided the three and four- way races that he had found himself in the shorter events, taking a different approach that pitted him against Sun. Cochrane and Sun repeatedly took the lead from each other, culminating in Sun pulling ahead in the final 100 metres and took the gold. Although he established a new Canadian record, Cochrane still said that hoped to progress further, saying \\"This week was filled with ups and downs. I had expectations of myself that weren't met earlier on but I was pretty proud of my races later in the week so I'm going to take that going forward. Just to get on the podium twice is fantastic but I think I have that many more dreams of being that much better next time.\\" Glasgow, Scotland, was the location for the 2014 Commonwealth Games where Cochrane looked to defend both of his titles in the 400-metre and 1500-metre events. Cochrane won the 400-metre freestyle by half a second and after tying up after 1200 metre in the 1500-metre freestyle Cochrane wound up successfully defending this title by a safe margin as well. He stated that he believed these were one of his last major competitions and knowing that he could count his big races on one hand, pushed through the pain to the repeat double. Swimming in the 400 m freestyle event at the 2015 World Aquatics Championships Cochrane surprised with a bronze medal in his shortest event, not normally his strongest event. Next in the 800 m freestyle event he surprised again, though this time negatively when he failed to qualify for the final in the event when seven swimmers went under 7:50. After he said \\"The distance events are getting faster and faster. The heats felt more like a semifinal. I thought I did enough to get into the final and I'm obviously disappointed.\\" Despite this poor result Cochrane did follow up with another bronze in his preferred 1,500 m event, the last major event till the 2016 Summer Olympics. He competed Canada's Olympic team at the 2016 Summer Olympics and was made co-captain of the team.Dimanno, Rosie. \\"Ryan Cochrane will set the tone for Canadian swimmers\\". Toronto Star, August 4, 2016, page S4. These were to be Cochrane's last Olympic Games, though they would end in disappointment when he missed the final of the 400 m and finished sixth in the 1,500 m freestyle event.

The family owned group came to national attention after running express coach services from Plymouth to London, in light of the Transport Act 1980. History Trathens StarLiner at the Western National Rally, Plymouth 28 July 2002 National Express liveried double-deck Van Hool coaches in Plymouth in 2001 Post-World War II, Dartmoor farmer Frederick Trathen and his son Eric drove their lorry, containing produce, to the market away in Plymouth. In 1946, he started carrying locals on the trip, and then due to increasing demand installed a wooden trestle bench. The service proved so popular, that Trathen's bought a second-hand 1933 Bedford WLB 20 seater for ¬£100, with which they also ran weekend trips to Torquay.Web News 48 West Country Historic Omnibus & Transport Trust By 1950 and now based in Yelverton, the company had six Bedford coaches, and had bought its first new chassis, a Bedford OB. Expanding locally in the 1950s with at least one new chassis per year, from 1960 they ran their first holiday service to the Netherlands. The business now existed in three divisions: bus and coach services; excursion; and private hire, including services for Plymouth Argyle Football Club. From the 1970s, Eric‚Äôs sons Mike and David began running the business, which was by now expanding with four new chassis per year. The business at this time was mainly expanding through its excursion services, which used continental-style coach bodies build on traditional British chassis. However, by the late 1970s the company had bought its first Neoplan chassis, which prepared it for the expansion possibilities brought about by the Transport Act 1980. With deregulation of coach services in the UK, and introduction of the new InterCity 125 service from 1976 by British Rail, Trathens began an executive high-speed express coach service from Plymouth direct to London. Running mainly up the M5 motorway to Bristol, the coaches then turned east along the M4 motorway to London via Swindon and Reading. Using mainly the new Neoplan Skyliner double decker, the service offered on-board light refreshments and newspapers, a hostess and toilets. The relatively low-priced service compared to the rival National Express, in a style more akin to the new InterCity 125 trains, brought about fast expansion for the family-owned firm. In October 1982, the company bought Roborough House on the edge of Dartmoor, which became its new headquarters and operational base. The site was developed with an airport-style coach holiday departure lounge, large car park, and workshop, with associated paint shop, offices and stores. With the fleet fast expanding, and the company adding new direct to London service access points along both the M4 and M5 - Exeter, Salisbury, Taunton, Bristol, Cardiff, Swansea and Swindon proving most popular - the company now employed a full-time sign writer. The company also opened a new London depot in Brentford, allowing both: expansion into the international tourist market, for those coming into the UK via London Heathrow and Gatwick Airports; as well as the founding of StarRiders a well known sleeper bus operator. Having beaten National Express on price and service grounds, the two companies now signed a co-operation agreement, with National Express marketing Trathens services under a joint- brand. Trathens had also greatly expanded its excursion operations, with weekly services into all of the major holiday destinations in Europe, as well as a West Country-based chain of direct-marketing travel agencies.Don't knock Tratherns, its here to stay Commercial Motor 12 March 1983 The fast contraction of the business came about after a series of high-profile accidents from the mid-1990s ownards, involving drivers who were later found to be in excess of their allocated work hours, and various fraudulent acts associated with tachograph operations at both a driver and company level. Unable to now offer competitive direct-to-London services on either a time or cost basis, and with its brand tarnished and PSA operator's licence restricted, the group began to quickly contract, and was, in 1996, sold to Scottish-based Park's Motor Group.About us Park's Motor Group Following another series of tachograph- related court cases brought by the Vehicle & Operator Services Agency, Park's dropped the Trathen's brand in 2009.Trathens coach firm's driver's offences This is Cornwall 5 May 2009 Roborough House was sold-off, and is now a specialist private neurological care unit.

Plot introduction The first point of divergence occurs during the American Civil War in May 1864, when General J. E. B. Stuart survives the wound which historically killed him at the Battle of Yellow Tavern. Then, in July, a second point of divergence occurs when Confederate President Jefferson Davis does not replace the \\"plodding\\" General Joseph E. Johnston, in command at Atlanta, with the \\"dashing\\" General John Bell Hood, as he actually did. Johnston, rather than leave the fortifications of Atlanta and get his army destroyed by William T. Sherman's Union forces, as Hood did in our time line, keeps his soldiers inside, fighting a long-drawn siege war of attrition until the Northern elections of November 1864. Abraham Lincoln loses the support of the war-weary voters and Democratic candidate and Major general George B. McClellan is elected president. McClellan orders a cease-fire, followed by a peace in which the independence of the South is recognized. Plot summary Despite the South's victory, the population is still coming to terms with the enormous costs of the war. Edward A. Pollard, the editor of the Richmond Examiner is one of them; he blames J. E. B. Stuart for having caused the Confederate defeat at the Battle of Gettysburg, which lengthened the war by one year and cost so many more lives in intervening battles. Seeking reelection in 1867 (as his 6-year-term ends on February 22, 1868), Jefferson Davis convenes a court of inquiry to provide a public airing of the accusation. Though Stuart welcomes the inquiry as an opportunity to clear his name, Davis intends to make Stuart the scapegoat for the defeat. (Note that the reelection business is a bit odd, as the Constitution of the Confederate States limited the President to a single term. It must be assumed that the Constitution had an amendment in the alternate 1865.) To represent him in the tribunal, Stuart approaches his good friend Colonel John S. Mosby. Now the head of military intelligence, Mosby accepts, juggling preparations for the inquiry with his other duties. His primary concern is \\"Abraham,\\" an organization of southern African Americans pursuing an end to slavery in the South. Enjoying a cordial relationship with the movement's leader, a local businessman and preacher named Jublio, he nonetheless recruits an informant to monitor Jublio's activities. Yet Abraham is not the Confederacy's greatest problem. A band of northern abolitionists and freedmen, bitter at the way the war ended and southern slavery continued, form a terrorist cell known as \\"Amistad\\", named for the famous slave ship. Organized by Thomas Wentworth Higginson, they plot to infiltrate the Confederate capital of Richmond and stage an incident which will rally the slaves and restart the war. Though the cell is made up of African Americans, the leader is Salmon Brown, the surviving son of John Brown, who is consumed with guilt at having backed out of his family's raid on Harpers Ferry and determined to redeem himself. Brown is unsettled, though, by the addition of an octoroon woman named Verita to the cell, while the group's plans are jeopardized by a vainglorious member code- named Crispus Attucks who writes compromising letters to the authorities in Washington taunting them about the cell's upcoming actions. Not wanting to jeopardize relations with the Confederacy, President McClellan orders General John Rawlins to investigate the letters. Former President Lincoln, still regarded as a hero by many, also sponsors Rawlins' mission. The court of inquiry attracts considerable attention from the public and the press. Many prominent women rally around the handsome Stuart, most notably Bessica Adams Southwick, a beautiful and wealthy widow. Her casual flirtation with Stuart soon develops into love, though Stuart's sense of honor restrains him from betraying his marital vows. Intrigued by the opportunity presented by the trial, Higginson arranges for Verita to travel to Richmond. Posing as a French actress, she is hosted by Southwick, who soon gives Verita access to many prominent Confederate figures, most notably Judah P. Benjamin, with whom Higginson encourages Verita to begin an affair so as to learn what the Confederate official knows about funding for underground activities. Higginson also orders the remainder of the group to Richmond in preparation for their attack. When the inquiry begins, Mosby quickly becomes aware of the hostility of the members of the court -- Braxton Bragg, George Pickett, and John Bell Hood -- towards Stuart. Nonetheless, he mounts a vigorous defense of his friend. A greater challenge for him is the growing romantic interest of Spring Blakely, the niece of Confederate States Secretary of War John C. Breckinridge and a secret abolitionist. While attracted to Blakeley, Mosby holds back, still grieving for his recently deceased wife. He also attempts to deal with the threat posed by Amistad. Alerted to the possibility of a plot by Rawlins, the two pursue their investigations in consultation with one another. As the inquiry continues, Amistad prepares to carry out their plan to attack the dignitaries assembled in the courtroom. Approaching Jublio, they attempt to utilize his Abraham branch in their plans, but he keeps a wary distance from the plotters. Brown also attempts to deal with his growing jealousy over Verita's affair with Benjamin, and when confronted by her he admits his love. Distracted, he is unaware of Crispus's growing instability, which threatens to expose the group. Nevertheless, it is Crispus who identifies Mosby's informer, a man named Israel Jones among the Abraham organization. He kills Jones, but not before Jones succeeds in sending to Mosby a garbled name \\"Saman Brown\\" which Mosby eventually figures out is that of Salmon Brown. T.W. Higginson, having been informed by Jubilo that Brown and Crispus' plans have turned to madness, tells Brown to cease and desist but is murdered by Brown. Mosby enjoys a great breakthrough in Stuart's case. After careful study of the records, he decides to shift the blame for the defeat to James Longstreet, who long sought Stuart's court-martial for his actions during the battle. With Davis's plans in ruins and the members of the court preparing to clear Stuart of all blame, the Confederate president suffers an additional blow when Robert E. Lee himself agrees to testify. Lee's appearance catalyzes the Amistad plotters. On August 14, 1866, while Lee testifies in the courthouse, the plotters dynamite the Confederate White House, the destruction of which draws away many of the guards stationed at the courthouse in anticipation of an attack on the inquiry. With the courtroom weakly defended, the Amistad plotters rush the room, and gloatingly hold the famous Confederates hostage. Finally, a firefight erupts in which most of the Amistad group die, but they succeed in killing a number of people, including Benjamin, P. G. T. Beauregard, and Stuart, who takes a bullet for Lee - and also Rawlins of the USA. A decisive factor in the battle is the sudden appearance of the armed Jubilo, who decided to turn against the Amistad group and who kills Salmon Brown (who in real life lived until 1919, when he committed suicide in Portland, Oregon). With Lee surviving, a US officer among those killed by the Amistad group, and Jubilo having turned informer, the incident fails to reignite the war between the USA and CSA which the conspirators hoped for. However, there is much rioting and bloodshed inside the Confederacy's own territory, with angry mobs attacking random Blacks and the Black activists of \\"Abraham\\" succeeding to fight back in some locations. A meeting between Mosby and Jubilo in the aftermath gives the impression that the Confederate government will have to change its attitude to the Black population - not only eventually abolish slavery but also grant civil rights to the increasingly organized and self-aware Blacks. In October, Verita - the only one of the Amistad group to survive the fighting - has been sentenced to death by a military tribunal, analogous to the case of Mary Surratt in our timeline. She haughtily rebuffs Mosby's suggestion that she ask for clemency, telling him \\"I will be alive when you are dust\\" and prepares to die as a martyr and create a heroic myth for future radicals. The novel ends as both nations are massing troops together, and it is suggested that a second war may be inevitable unless changes are made. In the final page, Mosby visits Stuart's grave and loses himself in memories of his first sight of the great Cavalier. Literary criticism and reception A review in the Virginia Quarterly Review said of the novel \\"Skimin crafts his characters and their setting with such care that one cannot help but enjoy the ruse‚Äîand marvel at the story's finale. A history lover's delicacy.\\" References in other works Authors Paul Ashdown and Edward Caudill have mentioned the novel in their two novels The Mosby Myth and The Myth of Nathan Bedford Forrest. John S. Mosby is mentioned in the novel as the chief of the military intelligence in the regular Confederate States Army, with the specific duty of monitoring Abraham.

It resulted in the end of the Kosovo War, and established new basic relations between Yugoslavia and the Kosovo Force, which would act to replace units of the Yugoslav Army, in Kosovo.  Background  The run-up to the Kumanovo Agreement involved a flurry of negotiations not just between Yugoslavia and Serbia but also NATO and Russia. Despite the initial agreement, for instance, on a withdrawal timetable for the Serbian forces in Kosovo, NATO's Operation Allied Force was still underway, pending the completion of full withdrawal of the Serbian troops. There are sources that cite the role that Russia played in the immediate resolution of the accord. There was a claim about a meeting between Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. An initial agreement between the two parties was reached, which involved a commitment on the part of NATO to cease its airstrikes and a willingness to remove a passage it wanted to include in the Kumanovo Agreement in exchange for Russian support for a forthcoming UN Resolution agreed by the Group of Eight. Without the Russian participation, the UN Security Council Resolution on Kosovo would not have been approved and the NATO airstrikes would have continued. Provisions of the agreement The key provisions of the agreement were designed to enable the following: * A cessation of hostilities between NATO's Kosovo Force (KFOR) and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia followed by an end to the bombing campaign should FRY comply effectively with the agreement. * Definition of a 25 km air safety zone and 5 km ground safety zone around Kosovo's boundaries, into FRY-administered territory where necessary, which FRY military forces could not enter without UN permission. Lightly armed police continued to operate within the zone outside of Kosovo according to the agreement. * Over 11 days from signing, the staged withdrawal from Kosovo by FRY forces, including the clearing of military assets (mines, booby traps) from communications lines, and the provision of information to NATO about remaining hazards. * The deployment of civil and security forces within Kosovo, pursuant to an at that point unapproved, but drafted United Nations Security Council Resolution. * Authorization for assistance to, and use of necessary force by NATO to create a secure environment for the international civilian presence The NATO presence was sanctioned by the United Nations Security Council on the strength of Resolution 1244 (1999), which authorized UN Member states and international organizations to maintain an international security presence via the KFOR in Kosovo until an agreement is finally concluded and its terms implemented. The KFOR was authorized to take all actions necessary to ensure compliance with the agreement. Status of agreement Legal expert Enrico Milano has argued that the Kumanovo Agreement \\"is dubious under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) and, as a consequence, so too are parts of Resolution 1244 referring, implicitly or explicitly, to paragraph 10 of Annex 2 of the same resolution.\\" One particular argument is that \\"it is doubtful whether the Kumanovo Agreement can be considered valid according to Article 52 of the VCLT, which states that \\"a treaty is void if its conclusion has been procured by the threat or use of force in violation of the principles of international law embodied in the Charter of the United Nations\\". The legal arguments continue that in fact to remedy the legal issues arising what is needed is for Status of Forces Agreement to be entered into with Belgrade.

Originally, the area was nominally under the charge of the Bishop of London, a situation that had been assumed to hold from 1660 onwards. In 1813, the then Bishop of London denied it was his responsibility, and so it turned out that clergy appointments to the Church in the Colonies were recommended by the local governor, in this case the Governor of the Leeward Islands. From 1824 until 1872 the area was administered by the Bishop of Barbados.

The event was immortalized when passenger and author Stephen Crane, who was traveling as a war correspondent for the Bacheller-Johnson syndicate, wrote the classic short story \\"The Open Boat\\" about his experience. Crane and three other men, including the ship's captain, Edward Murphy, were stranded in a dinghy for nearly thirty hours near the Mosquito Inlet Lighthouse (today's Ponce de Leon Inlet Light) before they were able to reach shore; all but one of the men survived. During 2002-2004 three seasons of archaeological investigation were begun in order to archaeologically document the exposed remains and to definitively identify the vessel. The results of this fieldwork were eventually incorporated into a Master's Thesis produced by Kimberly Eslinger Faulk, then a graduate student at East Carolina University's Maritime Studies Program. For two weeks in May 2002, Faulk, a crew of technical divers from the Cambrian Foundation, representatives of PILHA and videographer Rick Allen from Nautilus Productions completed the first archaeological survey of the wreck site. In keeping with the Light House‚Äôs mission of protecting the wreck site and better interpreting its importance to the people of Ponce Inlet and Daytona Beach, Florida project parameters were laid out for a professional archaeological survey of the site. Nautilus Productions provided video mosaic services, site documentation and recorded survey and diving activities on site. Later in 2004 scientists from the Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program (LAMP) at the St. Augustine Lighthouse & Museum offered their assistance to PILPA in their ongoing investigation of the vessel remains and visited the shipwreck site for a series of dives on April 7, 2004. The recording of the engine remains by LAMP divers resulted in measurements of a 26-inch bore and a 30-inch stroke. These dimensions are a perfect match with the schematics for the single-expansion steam engine built by the Neafie & Levy yard in Philadelphia as listed in the 1882 survey produced when Commodore was first registered. This data and the accumulated evidence finally substantiated the identification of this sunken vessel as Commodore beyond a reasonable doubt.

The June 29‚ÄìJuly 4 gathering of 53,407 veterans (~8,750 Confederate) was the largest ever Civil War veteran reunion, and \\"never before in the world's history [had] so great a number of men so advanced in years been assembled under field conditions\\" (Chief Surgeon). (p. 60) All honorably discharged veterans in the Grand Army of the Republic and the United Confederate Veterans were invited, and veterans from 46 of the 48 states attended (cf. Nevada and Wyoming). Despite official concerns \\"that there might be unpleasant differences, at least, between the blue and gray\\" (as after England's War of the Roses and the French Revolution), the peaceful reunion was repeatedly marked by events of Union‚ÄìConfederate camaraderie. President Woodrow Wilson's July 4 reunion address summarized the spirit: \\"We have found one another again as brothers and comrades in arms, enemies no longer, generous friends rather, our battles long past, the quarrel forgotten‚Äîexcept that we shall not forget the splendid valor.\\" Planning After numerous smaller Gettysburg reunions, including the 1906 Philadelphia Brigade/Pickett's Division reunion, during which Brig. Gen. Lewis Armistead's captured sword was returned to the South, in April 1908 General Henry S. Huidekoper of Philadelphia suggested a 1913 50th anniversary reunion to Pennsylvania Governor Edwin Sydney Stuart. On September 8, the Gettysburg National Park Commission met with Gettysburg borough officials about the event, Stuart conducted a sub-committee meeting on October 25, and Stuart addressed the General Assembly on the matter in January 1909. On May 13, 1909, the Pennsylvania Assembly created the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg Commission, and the commission's \\"first tentative programme\\" of October 13, 1910 included a \\"Peace Jubilee\\", with noon July 3 placement of the cornerstone for a \\"Great Peace Memorial\\". The August 26, 1912, US Congress bill appropriated $150K and directed the War Department to establish the camp. Because the memorial funding was not approved, the \\"Peace Jubilee\\" plans were removed from the schedule. The site for the camp and the for the Great Tent west of the Codori House were selected in 1912 and mapped by the Gettysburg National Park Commission. The Park Commission also completed painting of avenue fencing, gun carriages, iron tablets, pyramids, and shells from 1912 through June 30, 1913. On April 13, 1913, the Pennsylvania commission completed the Pennsylvania State Memorial and also mailed 40,000 veteran's invitations. On June 28, President Woodrow Wilson notified the Pennsylvania commission he would attend the reunion for a \\"very limited period\\". The 33 contributing states provided a total of $1,033,000 for the reunion ($450,000 from Pennsylvania). The Pennsylvania commission headquarters at Gettysburg was at 231 Baltimore Street, with the Harrisburg office of the Secretary (later nicknamed the \\"Duke of Gettysburg\\") (GDG.org Microsoft Word version, Quick View version) in Pennsylvania State Capitol Room 509. Various commemorative tokens and programs were developed for attendees, including three types of Pennsylvania badges (\\"PRESS\\", \\"GUEST\\", \\"SCOUT\\"), a commemorative medal, and a souvenir program of poems by the attending \\"Veteran Scout\\", Jack Crawford. The Pennsylvania Railroad Company added \\"a telephone line between Gettysburg and Hanover along the Western Maryland Railway, over which the Pennsy [would] operate a large number of trains during the battle anniversary\\". On the Chambersburg-Gettysburg turnpike and the Gettysburg-Petersburg turnpike, tolls ended in time for the reunion. On June 27, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court upheld the 1911 Sproul Roads Act, by which the Commonwealth acquired private toll roads and made them free for the public. By February 1, 1913, water wells were being drilled for the July encampment, (Gettysburg Times, Feb 1) and by June 26 hotels in Hanover, Chambersburg, Hagerstown, and \\"the Blue Ridge section [were] filling rapidly\\". For entertainment, a Gettysburg facility was started in 1912 to display the Boston version of the Gettysburg Cyclorama, and The Battle of Gettysburg black & white film of 1913 was first run at Walter's Theatre on June 26 (This film has since been lost). Local planning for the reunion included expanding the Gettysburg hackman's tax to apply to automobiles (upheld by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in 1914), a 50 cent maximum for taxi fares in the borough, and an obscure request from a few Missouri veterans regarding the availability near Gettysburg of \\"a few good widows or old maids ‚Ä¶ good housekeepers and not too young\\" to go west after the reunion. (The \\"kind-hearted mayor\\", J. A. Holtzworth, agreed to forward photos to the veterans in the \\"Cupid ‚Ä¶ operations\\".) Facilities Panorama of the Great Camp on the Gettysburg Battlefield. The War Department's Great Camp (Gettysburg Encampment, Anniversary Camp, Veterans Camp) provided tents and support facilities for the Civil War veterans and extended from both sides of Long Lane on the north to within 500 yards of the Bliss House. The Great Camp included the Great Tent (Big Tent, 200 x 450 ft) \\"with its thirteen thousand chairs\\"; the veterans' tents; quarters for 1,466 War Department soldiers (including camp commander Gen. Liggitt) & 2,179 mess personnel; 385 camp Boy Scouts from Washington; and other camp personnel for a total of 57,198 \\"persons quartered and subsisted in the Great Camp\\". The camp had a temporary U. S. Post Office; 90 Pennsylvania Health Department latrines throughout the camp with a seating capacity of 3,476; and near the Great Tent, an Emergency Station and 2 Comfort Houses of the health dept, which also supplied the Great Tent water fountains. The Pennsylvania commission also set up a temporary morgue in the camp. A special platform on the Round Top Branch was built for veterans to disembark from steamtrains directly into the camp (in February, trolleys of the Gettysburg Electric Railway had been prohibited from using the branch). After the state health department's Chief Engineer had estimated Gettysburg (pop. 4,500) would be inundated with 100,000 people, the borough agreed to the Commissioner of Health's request for his department to take over medical and sanitation efforts in the area from June 25-July 25. The department set up a field hospital at the Kurtz property facing Brickyard Lane on the north foot of East Cemetery Hill, as well as 6 Comfort Stations in the borough (1 at each railroad station), with a total of ~100 hoppers. The department also tested borough wells and mitigated contamination sources upstream of the Water Works supply on Marsh Creek. The American Red Cross Society, along with 72 additional Boy Scouts, operated fourteen 7 ft x 7 ft Relief Stations for first aid and rest on the battlefield park roads. The Tuberculosis Dispensary in Gettysburg was also used as a Relief Station. Attached to the Great Camp were a battery of the Third United States Field Artillery and several companies of Regular Infantry. Companies A-D (14 officers & 285 men) \\"The United States land on the battlefield is used by the Quartermaster‚Äôs Department for camp site No. 1. Part of the farm (formerly Codori) of William F.

The next meeting was held at the Union League, Philadelphia, January 23, 24, and 25, 1913. ‚Ä¶ This great project, which was inaugurated September 8, 1908, by the chairman of the Gettysburg National Park Commission\\" (after the April 1908 idea of General Henry S. Huidekoper) of the Fifteenth United States Cavalry arrived on June 26 to guard the battlefield and camped west of Seminary Ridge on the Hagerstown Rd. A \\"model Camp\\" for a Pennsylvania cavalry squadron was on the \\"College Athletic Field\\" adjoining the commission's Headquarters. A total of 527 people were quartered at both the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Gettysburg and the Pennsylvania College (renamed as \\"Gettysburg College\\" in 1921), including the Pennsylvania Gettysburg Commission, 4 troops of Pennsylvania State Police, and in tents, Governor Tener's staff. Additional nearby encampments included the leased Newspaper Row (\\"Meadeboro\\") for 155 journalists, north of the Gettysburg National Cemetery, an encampment of 30 Boy Scouts near Cashtown west of Gettysburg for traveler services on the Chambersburg-Gettysburg Pike, and Philadelphia and Baltimore Salvation Army members encamped in Stonesifer's Grove at Biglerville, Pennsylvania.

President Wilson with veterans President Wilson speaking to veterans in Great Tent Events The Commission planned a four-day series of events, with each day dedicated to a different group: Anticipating that some veterans might arrive early, especially those traveling distances, the Great Camp was opened for supper on June 29. Pennsylvania veterans who had attended the state reunion, which had adjourned on June 28, made up most of the more than 21,000 arrivals that day. Other veterans arriving early included two Confederate vets of Culp's Hill, who had arrived on June 26. Capt McCaskey of the Quartermasters Corps had estimated 6,000 men might arrive on June 29, and for a time struggled with severe shortages of food and supplies. Some veterans left without staying another night. In more pre-Camp activities, on June 30 the 1912 base of the Virginia Monument was dedicated; the remainder of the monument was completed later. ;July 1: Veterans' Day, included a speech by John Wanamaker of Philadelphia, the major department store developer and philanthropist.John Wanamaker, by William Zulker ;July 2: Military Day, included an address by a military officer recommending a stronger military (\\"we ought to build two battleships for every one laid down by Japan\\") in this period of increasing tensions in Europe, where the Great War broke out in July 1914; , a reading of the Gettysburg Address; and a review of the Virginia division at Seminary Ridge by their governor. At night, an impromptu Union raid on the Confederate side of the Great Camp resulted in joint parades and camp fires following the \\"charge\\". ;July 3: Civic/Governors' Day had 65 unit reunions, the dedication of the General William Wells statue; and a Webb/Pickett flag ceremony at the Bloody Angle on the hour of Pickett's Charge. Vice President Thomas R. Marshall and his wife, Speaker of the House Champ Clark, eight Senators, and 21 Congressmen were among officials who arrived that day for events.\\"Marshall and Clark In Town\\", Gettysburg Times, 3 July 1913; accessed 30 June 2019 In the Great Tent from 4:30-6 P.M. was the New York Veterans' Celebration, which included a speech by Colonel Andrew Cowan, in which he again proposed a Gettysburg peace memorial. The fireworks by the Pain Fireworks Display Company Gettysburg Times, June 10, 1913 at 9 p.m. included \\"gigantic set pieces covering the entire face and crest of Little Round Top\\". ;July 4: National Day, the Pennsylvania State Memorial was dedicated; eight statues had been installed in April as part of it. President Woodrow Wilson arrived at 11 a.m. in a special train car, traveled through the borough, and entered the Great Tent through two rows of Boy Scouts. Wilson addressed the audience in the Big Tent about national unity, and departed the camp after the National Anthem was played. (But Wilson is known for having segregated federal offices to appease some of his Southern cabinet members, despite protests from African-American leaders and groups.) (Attendees similarly returned to their quarters). At noon, a 5-minute tribute was held in silence for \\"Our Heroic Dead\\": people throughout the area stood at 'Attention',e.g., at the \\"College Hotel\\" and \\"Seminary Hotel\\". The Tribute began with a bugle salute blown over the camp while the Gettysburg bells in the distance tolled noon. The remaining minutes of silence were punctuated by periodic artillery firing from the distance. From 5 a.m. to 11 p.m., 7,147 automobiles (at least one from each state) used the national park roads as visitors departed. Some 12,000 veterans had already left on July 2 and about the same number on July 3. An unusual event took place on the evening of July 2 at the Hotel Gettysburg. W. B. Henry, a Southerner living in Philadelphia, erupted in violence after saying a \\"vile epithet\\" for President Lincoln and causing an argument at his table. A Union man threw his drink at Henry, who stabbed and slashed men at the table and on his way out to the street before being apprehended.\\"Eight Stabbed at Local Hotel\\", Gettysburg Times, 3 July 1913; accessed 30 June 2019 Henry claimed that his father had been a Confederate general, but this was not verified.

It was held in an actual forest, part of Rock Island State Botanical Preserve, on Preserve Lane near Cedar Rapids. It grew from a small haunted trail to a event. In 2009, all of the Frightmare Forest organization's property was packed up and moved to a warehouse at 412 7th Ave SE, in Cedar Rapids, becoming the Circle of Ash Haunted Attraction. Since then, it grew to produce multiple productions per year, including on Valentine's Day Weekend, Independence Day Weekend, and Halloween season in 2011. In 2015, the attraction went dark for a year, returning in 2016 at its current location at the Linn County Fairgrounds. As of 2017, Circle of Ash has resurrected the Frightmare Forest name, and applied it to one of their haunted attractions at the fairgrounds. The attractions include the haunted trail (Frightmare Forest), a haunted house (Circle of Ash), and a maze (Pandemonium), as well as three rides and an escape room. Attractions This attraction features multiple experiences on one site. The Circle of Ash is both the attraction's namesake and its indoor haunted house. Frightmare Forest is a haunted trail experience, created outdoors in a wooded area. Pandemonium is a maze attraction, according to the owners. In common industry usage, a \\"haunted house\\" and a \\"maze\\" are the same thing. Journey's End is a single-rider ride, in a coffin, simulating a trip to the customer's final resting place. Rigged is an elevator ride gone wrong. Shafted is the simulation of a mine accident. Finally, Halloween Homicide is a murder mystery/escape room experience, and is a premium ticket event.

Early life Terry Morris was born in Llanelli in September 1965. He attended Lakefield Infant and Primary School before moving on to Graig Comprehensive School, Llanelli. Self-confessed as 'not the best academic', Terry lost interest in school during his teens and only stayed on his final year, aged 15, to study woodwork with his favourite teacher 'Mr Evans' (Mike Evans), lovingly known as 'Killer' (due to his Size 13 plimsole!) Terry left school at 16 and joined the Parachute Regiment in which he served for one year. During the following years he worked in many different jobs, including as a labourer for his father's building firm, before settling as a welder for Llanelli-based sound and lighting firm PA Installations. Early career In his 30s Terry went back to college (Gorseinon College) to study Black and White Documentary Photography before starting on the freelance circuit working weekends for the local newspapers (Llanelli Star and Evening Post).http://www.thisissouthwales.co.uk/Focus-gallery-talent-says- snapper/story-12444753-detail/story.html Still employed by PA Installations, Terry was offered a week‚Äôs work with the Star when the staff photographer took a week's annual leave. Seeing it as his chance, Terry took a week's sick leave from his employer to cut his teeth as a 'proper' freelance photographer ‚Äì only to be caught red-handed by his boss halfway through the week and sacked on the spot! He then went on to work regularly for local and regional media titles before starting to hit the front pages of national tabloids and broadsheets. Press photography started to lose its appeal in the early 2000s when Terry's ambitions started to grow. A chance to photograph former Stereophonics drummer Stuart Cable, who was in town having his latest tattoo, led to him taking his first steps towards achieving his ambition of becoming the first portrait photographer to capture a photographic Welsh Hall of Fame ‚Äì later to become known as the Cool Cymru Collection Cool Cymru In 2006 his first published collection, entitled Cool Cymru was exhibited at the Wales Millennium Centre, becoming the first photographic collection to hang on its walls. Opened at the launch by one of the collection's featured stars, Charlotte Church, all 12 prints in the original collection were auctioned, raising over ¬£20,000 for The Noah's Ark Appeal, the fundraising arm of the Children's Hospital of Wales. It went on to tour other Welsh venues. Swansea Welcomes Cool Cymru Collection Launched alongside the photographic collection, the book Cool Cymru Collection . included his portraiture and documented his struggles to finance his dream project and make it a reality. There was also a three-part television documentaryhttp://www.locatetv.com/tv/cool-cymru/534786 filmed by Llanelli- based production company Tinopolis. Those pictured in the collection were: * Shirley Bassey * Tom Jones * Katherine Jenkins * Rhys Ifans * Charlotte Church * Gavin Henson * Kelly Jones * Joe Calzaghe * Bryn Terfel * Ioan Gruffudd * Ryan Giggs * Stuart Cable Latest additions to the collection include Welsh rugby hero Shane Williams, the world's richest living painter Andrew Vicari, Wales First Minister Rhodri Morgan and Welsh actor Matthew Rhys. Stradey Park In 2008, Morris's second photo-based book was published. Faces of Stradey Park documented the final season of a Welsh rugby ground which was home to Llanelli RFC and professional region the Llanelli Scarlets for 129 years until October 2008. Morris and writer Andy Pearson were granted access to the ground throughout the 2007‚Äì08 rugby season to gather material for the book. It featured the stadium's November 2007 funeral service for rugby player and broadcaster Ray Gravell.  Artist's Jubilee Gift to Queen  Terry Morris, Carmarthenshire‚Äôs Ambassador for the Arts, presented the Queen with a unique Diamond Jubilee tribute, his own portrait of Her Majesty. Morris had been working on the Royal portrait for a year and it forms part of a pair. Morris says: ‚ÄúAs this is a very special year, I wanted to make a special gesture. She said that she was touched, and that the painting had given her much pleasure.‚Äù He comments: ‚ÄúOver the years I have photographed and painted a great number of famous faces, but Her Majesty is in quite a different league. Her image is on coins, banknotes, stamps and in the media worldwide. It was a real challenge to try and capture her in a unique way. I have spent twelve months trying to get it right. I hope I have succeeded ‚Äì I have tried to capture both the iconic and the human sides of Her Majesty.‚Äù This is not the first time that Morris has pictured the Queen. During the Millennium celebrations in 2000 he was asked to take a photographic portrait during a Royal visit to South Wales. He recalls: ‚ÄúUnfortunately she was on a very tight schedule so I had to work very quickly. After the session I felt that I hadn‚Äôt done Her Majesty justice. That planted the seed of the idea to paint this portrait. I wanted to get it right.‚Äù In his role as Ambassador for the Arts in Carmarthenshire, Morris works with children and young people, encouraging them to think creatively and express themselves. He says: ‚ÄúI hope I can show the next generation that the arts are not only fun and rewarding, but offer a range of great opportunities for careers. The creative industries are a big part of Wales‚Äô future and we need to harness all that emerging talent we have. Perhaps when the Queen celebrates her Platinum Jubilee one of these youngsters will be presenting her with another portrait.‚Äù Publications * Cool Cymru Collection, Morris, Terry; Pearson, Andy: Graffeg 2006 * Faces of Stradey Park, Morris, Terry; Pearson, Andy: Bryngold Books 2008 References External links * Official website * Profile from BBC Wales Arts website * Cool Cymru website Living people Welsh photographers Welsh artists 1965 births Cool Cymru 20th- century British artists 21st-century British artists ","title":"Terry Morris (artist and photographer)"},{"id":"18878203","text":"The Dancer's Body, a series of three documentary programmes exploring the science and the art of dance, was first broadcast by the BBCBBC programme information in 2002.

It was presented by the former principal dancer of the Royal Ballet School in London, Deborah Bull, and won the International Dance Screen AwardInternational Dance Screen Award in the same year. Recent developments in brain science, psychology, physical medicine and nutrition, and their relevance to dance, were combined with performances, by Deborah Bull and other dancers, of works specially commissioned for the series from leading choreographers, including David Bintley and Wayne McGregor.

The 72nd operates the Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker aircraft conducting air refueling missions. Overview Douglas C-47A-90-DL, Serial 43-15663 of the 72d Troop Carrier Squadron. The 72d Air Refueling Squadron's primary mission is to provide Global Reach by force extending through air refueling operations for the United States Military and its allies. Additionally the unit is tasked with aeromedical evacuation support, airlift, and passenger transport. History Origins - World War II The 72d Air Refueling Squadron originated as the 72d Troop Carrier Squadron on 3 January 1943. The squadron was activated on 9 February 1943 at Alliance Army Air Field, Nebraska assigned to the 434th Troop Carrier Group. In September 1943 equipped with Douglas C-47 Skytrains, the unit moved to Baer Field, Indiana at which today is the Fort Wayne International Airport. Shortly thereafter the squadron deployed to the European theatre in support of the Allied Forces in World War II. During its World War II tour in the European Theater of Operations, the squadron operated out of RAF Fulbeck, England, RAF Aldermaston and finally out of Mourmelon-le-Grand Airfield, France. It participated in airborne assaults on Normandy, the Netherlands, and Germany and the relief of Bastogne. It was credited with participation in the Normandy, Northern France, Rhineland, Ardennes-Alsace, and Central Europe campaigns. It earned the Distinguished Unit Citation and French Croix de Guerre with Palm for its participation in the airborne assault on Normandy, and later earned the French Fourragere. In addition to the C-47, the squadron also flew Airspeed Horsa gliders, as well as Waco CG-4 gliders during the war. After the war the 72d returned to Baer Field, in August 1945 and then back to Alliance Army Air Field in September 1945. In October 1945 the unit moved to George Field, Illinois, and finally in February 1946 it moved to Greenville Army Air Base, South Carolina where it was inactivated on 31 July 1946. On 1 August 1947 the unit was reactivated as the 72d Troop Carrier Squadron in the reserves at Baer Field. It was assigned to the 434th Troop Carrier Group, equipped with C-47s. Korean War - 1973 In July 1949 the squadron and group moved to Atterbury Air Force Base, Indiana, which today is the Columbus Indiana Municipal Airport, where they transitioned to the Curtiss C-46 Commando. Starting in May 1951 as part of the Korean mobilization the unit served under Tactical Air Command's Eighteenth Air Force for the next 21 months where it supported Army paratroop training in Georgia. In addition the 72d participated in Exercises Southern Pine and Long Horn, as well as conducting routine airlift and troop carrier missions for Tactical Air Command. The squadron returned to Atterbury in February 1953. By 1957 Atterbury had been renamed Bakalar Air Force Base, and in the same year the 72d converted to Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcars In 1962 as a result of the Cuban Missile Crisis, the squadron served for 32 days supporting the deployment of Air Force strategic and tactical resources to the Southeast corner of the country and their redeployment there from. In July 1969, wing, group, and squadron were redesignated as tactical air support units and were reequipped with Cessna U-3As and Cessna O-2A Skymasters. On 31 December 1969, in connection with the closing of Bakalar, the 434th Wing was inactivated and the 931st Tactical Air Support Group and its squadron moved to Grissom Air Force Base, IN. First reassigned to the 403d Composite Wing on 1 June 1970 and then on 15 January 1971 to the 434th Special Operations Wing, concurrently activated and collocated with group and squadron at Grissom. On 1 March 1971, group and squadron converted to Cessna A-37 Dragonflys and were redesignated as special operations units. On 15 September 1973, the 434th Wing was redesignated as a tactical fighter wing. On 1 October 1973, the 72d Special Operations Squadron was inactivated in favor of the 46th Tactical Fighter Squadron because at the time another 72d Tactical Fighter Squadron existed. Air Force Reserve - Desert Storm On 18 May 1977 the squadron was redesignated as the 72d Air Refueling Squadron, Heavy, and was assigned to the Air Force Reserve. HQ Air Force Reserve activated the 72d Air Refueling Squadron on 1 July 1978. In July 1987 the 434th Tactical Fighter Wing was redesignated as the 434th Air Refueling Wing of which the 72d was a part. In 1990 the 72d as part of the 434th were recalled to active duty for the Gulf War and helped to form one of the largest tanker task forces ever assembled operating out of western Saudi Arabia. The 72d and its partners flew more than 7,000 refueling missions, offloading fuel to more than 25,000 coalition aircraft. In June 1992, the 434th Air Refueling Wing with its Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers and the 930th Fighter Group with its Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt IIs merged to form a composite wing to include the 72d and was designated the 434th Wing. In 1994 the A-10 squadron under the 434th inactivated and the 434th Wing reorganized as the 434th Air Refueling Wing once again. Kosovo - Present During the 1990s the 72d deployed personnel and aircraft numerous times to support \\"No Fly\\" operations in the Balkans, as well as Operations Northern and Southern Watch over Iraq. In May 1999, the 72d and the 434th were activated to provide aerial refueling support to Operation Allied Force deployed out of Rhein Mein AB in Germany as part of the war in Kosovo. In September 2001, just days after the terrorist attacks of 9/11 the 72d was activated for a year in support of the Global War on Terror. The squadron initially deployed to the Pacific theatre to help provide a western air bridge in preparation for the war in Afghanistan. Later during that year, the 72d was deployed to a classified Southwest Asian location flying air refueling missions over Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf in support of the war. The unit's activation ended in late summer of 2002, but 6 months later in Feb of 2003 the 72d was again activated for a six-month stint in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Most of the unit staged out of Moron AB, Spain, with a smaller elements staging out of RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus and Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean. Although the unit's second activation supporting the Global War on Terror ended in late 2003, the 72d continues to provide worldwide air refueling and air mobility support by flying missions for Operations Noble Eagle, Enduring Freedom, and Iraqi Freedom.

Initially tracking south-eastward, the system gradually attained gale-force winds as it neared the Cocos Islands late on 17 November. Squally conditions and heavy rain impacted the islands but no damage took place. Low wind shear allowed for further strengthening; a mid-level ridge south of the system forced Daryl to turn towards the west. Early on 19 November, the storm intensified into a severe tropical cyclone and attained winds of 130 km/h (80 mph) before crossing 90¬∞E and entering the Mauritius area of responsibility. Upon crossing this border, Daryl was assigned a second name, Agnielle, by Mauritius. Over the following days, the system further deepened, peaking in strength as a Category 3 on the Australian intensity scale with 205 km/h (125 mph) and a barometric pressure of 915 hPa (mbar; 27.02 inHg). Steady weakening took place due to markedly stronger wind shear. Cyclone Daryl-Agnielle was last noted as a weak low pressure center on 25 November over the open waters of the southern Indian Ocean. Tropical Cyclone Emma Emma stayed well off the Australian coast in the Indian Ocean. It spent most of its duration as a tropical low. Severe Tropical Cyclone Frank It formed on 6 December 1995, and was the first cyclone to form in northwest coast of Australia during the 95/96 season. Cyclone Frank brought heavy winds and rains to the Pilbara coast. Frank was one of four cyclones to strike in that area. Severe Tropical Cyclone Gertie A tropical low formed in the Timor Sea on 16 December and tracked west-southwest as it deepened slowly. The low crossed into the WA region on 17 December and was named Gertie on the afternoon of the 18th. The cyclone then moved towards the south-southwest during the 19th but slowed to be almost stationary during the late afternoon and evening of that day. Gertie then began to move south, then southeastwards, crossing the coast near Mandora Station on 20 December. Gertie then passed to the northeast of Telfer producing near gale-force winds and heavy rain before dissipating on the 21st. The storm did only minor damage. Severe Tropical Cyclone Barry Barry formed in the Gulf of Carpentaria on 4 January, reaching a maximum intensity of Category 3 (Australian scale) before crossing the coast between Karumba and Kowanyama two days later. Heavy rains caused severe flooding across the southern Cape York Peninsula, however there were no deaths reported. Severe Tropical Cyclone Hubert-Coryna Hubert stayed well off the Australian coast in the Indian Ocean from 8 to 12 January 1996. Severe Tropical Cyclone Celeste Tropical Cyclone Celeste formed on 26 January and rapidly intensified into a Category 3 (Australian scale) system. The cyclone moved away from the coast after dumping heavy rain on the Central Coast. One man drowned in floodwaters near Bowen. Tropical Cyclone Isobel Isobel only lasted from 27 January 1996 to 1 February in the Timor Sea and did not pass close to any land. Severe Tropical Cyclone Jacob TC Jacob formed on 1 February 1996 from a monsoonal low that moved across the Northern Territory and the Kimberley region of Western Australia before tracking over the Bonaparte Gulf. It closely followed the Western Australian coast and developed cyclone characteristics near Adele Island. Jacob continued to intensify and moved west-southwestwards, roughly parallel to the Pilbara coast. At peak intensity Jacob was a Category 3 storm with wind gusts near the centre estimated to be 200 kilometres per hour. The Kimberley and Pilbara coastal areas received heavy rains as the cyclone passed offshore. Only minor damage occurred and there were no deaths. Tropical Storm 12S A weak storm formed near the edge of the Bureau's area of responsibility in early February. Only the JTWC classified it as a tropical cyclone, reporting peak winds of 65 km/h (40 mph). Tropical Low A tropical low existed from 8 to 11 February. Tropical Low A tropical low existed from 14 to 17 February. Tropical Cyclone Dennis Tropical Cyclone Dennis existed from 15 to 18 February. Severe Tropical Cyclone Kirsty A strong cyclone, Kirsty crossed the coast at Pardoo Station near Port Hedland on 12 March 1996. The cyclone did considerable damage to tourist cabins and other structures. Tropical Cyclone Ethel Severe flooding triggered by Cyclone Ethel resulted in A$75 million (US$57 million). Severe Tropical Cyclone Olivia Lasting from 5 April 1996 to 12 April, Olivia reached Category 4 and destroyed 55 houses (plus 27 damaged) at the mining town of Pannawonica. Several buildings also suffered roof damage at neighbouring Mount Tom Price. There were only 10 minor injuries. A gust of 267 km/h was recorded at Varanus Island which is the equal highest recorded wind gust in Australia. More recently, a review conducted by WMO confirmed a reported gust of 408 km/h on Barrow Island on 10 April 1996, at the peak of the storm, making it the highest gust ever recorded on earth during a non-tornadic storm. Tropical Depression 27S Tropical Depression 27S existed from 12 to 19 April. Tropical Cyclone Jenna Tropical Cyclone Jenna existed from 30 April to 6 May. Tropical Low A tropical low existed in the vicinity of Brisbane from 30 April to 5 May. Storm names Tropical cyclones are assigned names by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology or Papua New Guinea. Tropical cyclones are named if they are non-frontal low pressure systems of synoptic scale developing over warm waters, or if Dvorak intensity analysis indicate the presence of gale force or stronger winds near the centre. Therefore, tropical systems with gales in one or more quadrants, but not near the centre, are not named. All names assigned in the Australian region are selected sequentially. Only the names used during this cyclone season are listed below. The complete list of names for each basin are found in the World Meteorological Organization's official lists. Each Australian Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre (Perth, Darwin, and Brisbane) maintained a list of names arranged alphabetically and alternating male and female. Tropical cyclones that develop in the South-East Indian Ocean are assigned names by the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre in Perth. This region includes the areas east of 90¬∞E, south of the Equator, and west of 125¬∞E. Tropical cyclones that develop south of the Equator between 125¬∞E and 141¬∞E are assigned names by the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre in Darwin, Northern Territory. This area includes most of the cyclones that form in the Arafura Sea and Western Gulf of Carpentaria. Tropical cyclones in the Coral Sea and Eastern Gulf of Carpentaria between 141¬∞E and 160¬∞E and south of 10¬∞S are assigned names by the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre in Brisbane, Queensland. Storms that enter the region that were named by the Mauritius meteorological service or the Fiji Meteorological Service retain their original names. However, those that move from the Australian region into the South-West Indian Ocean (west of 90¬∞E) are renamed by M√©t√©o-France. Additionally, the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea reserves the right to name cyclones that develop in the Solomon Sea and Gulf of Papua, north of 10¬∞S between 141¬∞E and 160¬∞E. Names issued by Port Moresby are retired after one use. Perth * Daryl - Emma - Frank - Gertie - Hubert - Isobel - Jacob - Kirsty Darwin * Barry - Olivia Brisbane * Celeste - Dennis - Ethel Additionally, one storm, Jenna, was named by the Mauritius Meteorological Service. Retirement At the end of the season, the Bureau of Meteorology retired seven of the thirteen names used during the season. The names were Frank, Gertie, Kirsty, Barry, Celeste, Ethel and Olivia.

Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, it is east of Ripponden, south of Sowerby Bridge and south-west of Halifax town centre. The village falls within the Ryburn ward of Calderdale. Barkisland has one school, a church, a post office and a local cricket club which play in the Huddersfield League. There are two pubs in Barkisland, the Fleece and the Griffin. History A ten- thousand-year-old axe has been discovered near Ringstone Reservoir, providing evidence of human activity in the area now known as Barkisland dating back to the Stone Age. The origin of the name is in dispute. In a book of place names printed in 1944 it was stated that Barkisland derived from it being a settlement ('land') of a chieftain called 'Barkis'. While much earlier, in 1789, the Rev. John Watson, vicar of Ripponden church between 1754 and 1769, theorised that \\"Barsey or Barkesey are Anglo-Saxon words meaning low-lying enclosures where birches grow. It also is the Anglo-Saxon for a district where there are wolves.\\" The parish of Barkisland was recorded on 1 July 1837 as part of the Halifax Registration District. It was abolished as a distinct parish on 1 April 1937 and merged with the neighbouring parish of Ripponden. Industry Bower's Mill was built in the 18th century as a water-powered fulling mill. it has also been used as a corn mill, a worsted mill and a woolen mill. Textiles manufacturer J. & S. Taylor Ltd occupied the mill from 1882 to 1991 before moving production to Sowerby Bridge. The mill has now been converted for smaller businesses. Barkisland Mills is a 6-storey building which was used for textile production in the 19th and 20th centuries. At the start of the 21st century it was converted into residential flats. There was also a Bottomley's Mill in Barkisland. Its presence as a cotton mill was recorded when a fire broke out there on 13 January 1871. Governance Barkisland is a village in the civil parish of Ripponden, which is part of the Ryburn ward of Calderdale, a metropolitan borough within the ceremonial county of West Yorkshire in England. Geography Barkisland is situated on a hilltop that gently rises from Greetland in the north-east and declines westwards to Ripponden and eastwards to Stainland. The hill continues to climb southwards towards Scammonden. Landmarks Barkisland Hall A surviving historic landmark of Barkisland are the original stocks.

It tells the story of a na√Øve and affectionate girl who has disastrous relationships with two rich and influential men. One uses her as a sex object and abandons her, while the second marries her but proves lethally unbalanced. The film was released in France on 8 August 2007 and a limited release in the United States beginning on 15 August 2008. Plot Gabrielle, a pretty but innocent young woman, lives with her mother in Lyon and works as a weather girl for the local TV station. She attracts the attention of two very different men. One is Paul, the heir to a pharmaceutical fortune, who is too arrogant and immature to interest her seriously. The other is Charles, a nationally known writer more than twice her age whose wife stays in their country house while he uses a flat in town. There he takes Gabrielle and teaches her the sexual arts, expanding them by visits to an exclusive sex club. Having enjoyed all her youthful passion, he disappears on an extended business trip. Gabrielle falls into a severe depression and her worried mother eventually lets Paul visit. He takes Gabrielle for a holiday to Lisbon, in separate rooms, and there she agrees to marry him. His widowed mother is appalled and a pre-nuptial contract excludes Gabrielle from all the family wealth. Not wanting any future misunderstanding with the insecure and volatile Paul, on their honeymoon she tells him about the relationship with Charles. Back in Lyon they attend a grand gala dinner for charity hosted by Paul's mother. The principal speaker is Charles and, in front of the town's √©lite, Paul shoots him dead. He gets a lenient sentence of seven years in an institution, from where he divorces Gabrielle, leaving her penniless. Back home with her mother and seriously depressed, her uncle comes up with a solution. He tours with a cheesy magic show and Gabrielle in a sexy outfit becomes the girl who is cut in two by a circular saw. A close-up reveals that her emotional pain is unrelieved.

He started off with St Patrick's Athletic F.C. at 17 before joining Bohemians F.C. in 1963 as an amateur. Bohemians struggled in the league, winning a handful of games, but the arrival of Se√°n Thomas as manager was soon to change things, \\"It was major news ‚Äì Sean Thomas had managed Shamrock Rovers and brought them phenomenal success.\\" There were offers to turn professional and semi-professional by the likes of Derry and Glentoran and Waterford. \\"The Derry one I was nearly going to take because it was full-time but Sean Thomas said that Shamrock Rovers was the offer to accept ‚Äì they were the club in the country ‚Äì they were in Europe every year.\\" Sean said, \\"Don't mind these other teams ‚Äì they can promise you ten pounds a week more than what Rovers are offering, but after a month they mightn't have any money.\\" In the end he went to Rovers in May 1966 for four times the amount they'd originally offered. The most memorable European tie Mick played in was against FC Bayern Munich in 1966. Rovers drew 1-1 at Dalymount Park but it was the return match played in below freezing temperature in Munich that almost caused German hearts to crash.

Eroded by the White River into the Caprock Escarpment on the east side of the Llano Estacado, the canyon runs for in a southeasterly direction, gradually widening from its beginning in southwestern Floyd County to across at its mouth in southeastern Crosby County. It also gradually deepens from at its beginning to 300 to 500 feet (91 to 150 m) at its mouth. One side canyon, 5-mile long Crawfish Canyon, was cut by Crawfish Creek as it feeds into the White River from the west. Blanco Canyon is one of several canyons that have been cut by rivers into the east face of the Llano Estacado, including Yellow House Canyon, Tule Canyon, and Palo Duro Canyon. History Texas Ranger Camp Roberts The canyon was long suspected, but only confirmed in the 1990s, of having been used as a campsite by Francisco V√°squez de Coronado and his army twice in spring of 1541 while on his El Dorado expedition. The water and timber afforded by the White River and the trees growing along its banks would have provided an ideal campsite in the 16th century. Indeed, although the river is mostly dry now due to pumping, local anecdotes maintain that fishing was possible in the river until the mid-20th century. The canyon valley still appears fertile, and cottonwood trees line the creek bed. It was on October 10, 1871, also the site of the main skirmish of Col. Ranald S. Mackenzie's initial campaign against the Plains Comanches, known as the Battle of Blanco Canyon. On this same campaign, Mackenzie established a supply camp named Anderson's Fort on a curved ridge a short distance southeast of the canyon mouth; it is now on the National Register of Historic Places. Shortly thereafter, once the Plains Indians had been forced onto reservations, the nearby site of Mount Blanco on the east rim of the canyon was established in 1877 by Henry Clay Smith and his wife, the former Elizabeth Boyle, as the first permanent white settlement on the West Texas plains, and the first post office west of Fort Griffin. Early settlers were attracted to the site for the same reason as Coronado had been - the ready supply of wood and water, which were rarities in the area. In 1948, the District Nine of the Caprock-Plains Baptist churches established the Plains Baptist Assembly in the canyon as a recreational retreat for area churches. By 1986, the site encompassed and 65 buildings. Today, it runs year-round and features facilities for camps, retreats, and conferences. Floydada's country club is also located in the canyon. Access The canyon is crossed north-to-south by U.S. Highway 62 near the canyon's beginning, and east-to-west by Farm to Market Road 193 and U.S. Highway 82, the latter being near the canyon's mouth. Where U.S. 82 crosses the White River, a roadside park with facilities and hiking trails has been built.

Board sizes vary, but they are square boards, such as 5x5 or 9x9 square grids with left and right diagonal lines running through several intersection points (or \\"points\\") of the board. One could think of the 5x5 board as a standard Alquerque board, but with additional diagonal lines, and the 9x9 board as four standard Alquerque boards combined together, but no additional diagonal lines are added. The initial setup is also similar to Alquerque, where every space on the board is filled with each player's pieces except for the middle point of the board. Furthermore, each player's pieces are also set up on their respective half of the board. The game specifically resembles draughts in that pieces must move in the forward directions until they are crowned \\"Mullah\\" (or \\"Sultan\\") which is the equivalent of the king in draughts. The Mullah can move in any direction. In North Africa, the black pieces are referred to as men, and the white pieces as women. In the Sahara, short sticks represent the men, and camel dung represent the women. The game goes by several names such as Damma, Srand, and Dhamet. In Mauritania, the game is referred to as Srand or Dhamet. It is a national game. Mauritania's version is different from the other variants in that the pieces captured are instantly removed from the board, whereas, in other variants the removal of captured pieces is deferred.  Setup  Board sizes vary. Examples are 5x5 and 9x9 square grids. Left and right diagonal lines run through several points of the square grid. The 5x5 square grid has left and right diagonal lines running through each point of the square grid (the additional points created by the intersection of the left and right diagonal lines within each square may or may not be considered a point on the board for pieces to be placed on). The 9x9 square grid is four standard Alquerque boards combined to form a larger square grid, but no additional diagonal lines are added. Each player's pieces are distinguishable from the other player, for example, one plays with black pieces and the other with white pieces. Every point of the board is occupied by a piece except for the central point. Each player's pieces are placed on their respective half of the board; on the central row, each player places their pieces to their respective right of the central point.  Rules  # Players alternate their turns. Black moves first. A piece moves forward only (straight forward or diagonally forward) one space per turn following the pattern on the board until they are crowned Mullah by reaching the last rank. Only one piece may be moved or used to capture enemy piece(s) per turn. # A (non-Mullah) piece may capture an enemy piece by the short leap as in draughts or Alquerqe. The capture can be in any direction. Multiple captures are allowed, however, the line with the most captures must be taken. Captures are compulsory for non- Mullah and Mullah pieces. # When a piece reaches the other player's rank, it is promoted to Mullah. The Mullah can move in any direction, and capture in any direction. It can also move any number of spaces as in the King in international draughts. The Mullah can also land anywhere behind the captured piece. If playing a variant where enemy pieces are not removed immediately when captured, the Mullah can not go back to any of them and leap them again. However, in a variant (e.g. Mauritania's variant) where captured pieces are removed immediately, the Mullah can leap over them again in order to leap another enemy piece(s). # If a non-Mullah piece reaches the other player's rank as an intermediate step of a capturing sequence, the piece does not get promoted to Mullah. # The player who captures all their opponent's pieces is the winner.

One of the participants in the Three Chapters Controversy, his commentary on the Book of Revelation is of interest to modern scholars for its use of the lost commentary of Ticonius on the same book of the New Testament.M.L.W. Laistner, Thought and Letters in Western Europe: A.D. 500 to 900, second edition (Ithaca: Cornell University, 1957), p. 114 According to M.L.W. Laistner, his disciples included the African theologian Junillus.Laistner, Thought and Letters, second edition, p. 115 Life Of his early life nothing seems to be known, but in 551, after he had become a bishop, he was called with other bishops to Constantinople and took part in the Three Chapters Controversy. He shared the fortunes of Pope Vigilius and helped to condemn Theodorus Ascidas, bishop of Caesarea, the chief promoter of the controversy, and fled with Vigilius to Chalcedon. He declined to attend the Fifth Ecumenical Council at Constantinople in the absence of the pope, and was the sole African to sign the papal constitutum to Emperor Justinian. Works While at Constantinople, Primasius studied the exegesis of the Greeks, and his fame is chiefly due to his commentary on Revelation. This work, divided into five books,Primasius Hadrumetinus Commentarius in Apocalypsin, ed. A.W. Adams (Corpus Christianorum Series Latina 92, Turnhout 1985). is of importance both as a witness of the pre-Cyprian Latin text of the Book of Revelation used by the North African church, and as aiding in the reconstruction of the most influential Latin commentary on Revelation, the exegetical work of the Donatist Ticonius. The text and exegesis of Revelation 20:1-21:6 are taken without attribution from Augustine of Hippo's De civitate Dei, 20.7-17. The work of the Ticonius was considered by Primasius a piece of treasure adrift and belonging of right to the Church, needing only to be revised and expurgated. Ticonius had developed the theory introduced by Victorinus, to examine the different words and imagery used in different passages to convey the same message. Primasius followed this exegetical method very closely, but differed from Ticonius on the greater message of the text. Where Ticonius believed Revelation should be read in terms of the struggle of the Donatists with false brethren and gentiles, Primasius held the conflict properly lay between the Church and the world. Of special interest is a letter of Augustine to the physician Maximus of Thenae preserved by Primasius, in which the four philosophical cardinal virtues are combined with the later three so-called theological virtues, making the number seven, in a manner nowhere else known of Augustine. The first edition of Primasius's commentary was by Eucharius Cervicornus (Cologne, 1535; reprinted, Paris, 1544), but the most complete and still the most valuable is that of Basel, 1544, which is based on a very ancient manuscript of the Benedictine Monastery of Murbach in Upper Alsace. The same monastery, according to a manuscript catalogue, possessed a work Contra haereticos, which is no longer extant, and alludes to other works, especially one on Jeroboam. The commentary on the Pauline epistles and on Hebrews ascribed to Primasius by Migne is spurious.Patrologia Latina, lxviii. 409-793.

The campaign was aimed against Islamist insurgents, who had been attacking the Egyptian security forces in the Sinai and using the area as a base from which to attack Israel since early 2011. Successive Egyptian operation against insurgents in 2012, named Operation Sinai,mainstreammedia was initially referred as the second part of Operation Eagle. It was the first in a number of campaigns to retake the Sinai from insurgents that lasts to this day. Background Historic perspective Sinai was an integral part of Egypt since the inception of the Muhammad Ali dynasty in the early 19th century. Israel briefly captured the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt in the 1967 Six-Day War. As part of the 1979 Egypt‚ÄìIsrael Peace Treaty, in 1982 Israel withdrew from the peninsula. Among the treaty's other provisions was an agreement that the peninsula would be left effectively demilitarized. A number of factors have enabled armed Islamist groups to take root and proliferate in the Sinai. Including local population alienation from the state and becoming more dependent on smuggling to Gaza. Early Islamist attacks The security situation in the Sinai began deteriorating early in 2011, as a fallout of the 2011 Egyptian revolution. Since February to August of that year, the Egypt‚ÄìIsrael pipeline in El-Arish was attacked five times by saboteurs. On 30 July, militants staged an attack on an Egyptian police station in El-Arish, killing six. On 2 August, a group claiming to be the Sinai wing of Al-Qaeda declared its intention to create an Islamic caliphate in the Sinai. Operation After working out arrangement with the Israeli government to permit more forces in the Sinai Peninsula than is allowed for by the security annex of the 1979 Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty. SCAF launched Operation Eagle on 14‚Äì15 August 2011. Egypt deployed 2,500 troops and 250 armored personnel carriers including two special forces brigades, tanks and Apache helicopters, in key locations in North Sinai, with armored personnel carriers operating around al Arish, Rafah and Shaykh Zuweid. The move marked the first time Egypt has deployed military forces on such a scale since its treaty with Israel. The objectives of the operation are to confront Islamist insurgents and criminal gangs threatening Egypt's national security and to restore law and order. On 15 August, Egyptian security forces swept through a house known to be used by five leading Islamist figures. One of the five was killed; the remaining four were taken into custody. On 16 August, a group of gunmen believed to be affiliated with jihadist movements attacked an Egyptian army checkpoint. Egypt's forces suffered no casualties in the assault. On 17 August, two Bedouins were killed in southern Sinai. Their families blamed Egyptian police for their deaths, but the police said it was not involved in the incident. On 18 August, a coordinated attack was staged upon Israeli military and civilians from Sinai, resulting in 6 Israeli civilians and two soldiers and 5 Egyptian soldiers killed, as well as 10 attackers. On 26 August, then Israeli defense minister Ehud Barak said that Israel will agree for Egypt to employ thousands of troops in the Sinai.Barak agrees to Egypt deploying troops, vehicles in Sinai Aftermath Following the 2012 Egyptian-Israeli border attack, forces from Egypt‚Äôs army and the police engaged in an operation against armed men who have been targeting security personnel in North Sinai. A number of clashes between armed men and security forces at several security checkpoints in the Sinai occurred during this time. Initially, the press related to the 2012 operation as the continuation of Operation Eagle, though later turning to an Egyptian official name Operation Sinai (2012). Egyptian security sources have said that over 2,000 Islamic militants reside in the Sinai region. The military said that the goal of the operation is to \\"restore security by pursuing and targeting armed terrorist elements in Sinai.\\" Reactions Israel The 1979 Camp David Accords, which established peace between Egypt and Israel, mandates that the Sinai must remain demilitarized. During the beginning of the operation in 2011, Israel allowed the deployment of thousands of troops in the Sinai, with helicopters and armored vehicles, but not tanks. During the beginning of August 2012, when Operation Eagle intensified, Israel approved a request from Barak to allow Egypt to deploy attack helicopters in the Sinai. However, concern began to be raised as Egypt began deploying more force and tanks without coordination from Israel. On 21 August, Israeli foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman said that it is important for Israel to make sure that the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty is upheld, and not to remain silent as Egyptian military forces enter the Sinai. Concern was raised by Israeli officials over Egyptian failure to notify Israel about the deployment of tanks in the Sinai, which violates the peace treaty. Lieberman said, \\"We must make sure that every detail is upheld, otherwise we'll find ourselves in a slippery slope as far as the peace treaty is concerned.\\" On the same day, Israeli daily Maariv reported that Israel sent a message to Egypt via the White House, protesting Egypt's ongoing increase in military presence in the Sinai without coordination from Israel, and telling Egypt that it must remove tanks from the Sinai because their presence violates the Egyptian- Israeli peace treaty of 1979, which states that Sinai Peninsula is to remain demilitarized. The Israeli daily Maariv reported was reinforced by an article in The New York Times, which stated that Israel was ‚Äútroubled‚Äù by the entry of Egyptian tanks into the northern Sinai Peninsula without coordination with Israel and had asked Egypt to withdraw them. Partly due to Egypt's military deploying tanks in the Sinai Peninsula, Israel is increasingly worried about what has long been their most critical regional relationship. The lack of coordination around their deployment is seen as potentially undermining a peace treaty that has been a cornerstone of Israel‚Äôs security for decades according to the New York Times. Israel is also concerned that Egypt may use Operation Eagle to build up its military presence in the Sinai, and leave the tanks and armored carriers in the Sinai while not doing much more than symbolic action to eliminate the terrorist threat. Israel has not issued a formal complaint, and instead prefers to resolve the issue through quiet contacts, as well as mediation from the U.S., to avoid straining its relationship with Egypt. On 24 August 2012, a senior Egyptian military source said that Egyptian Defense Minister Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak have reached an agreement on the issue of the militarization of the Sinai. Al Hayat reported that Sissi phoned Barak and said that Egypt was committed to maintaining the peace treaty with Israel. Sissi also said that the militarization was temporary, and is needed for security and to fight terrorism. However, an Israeli defense official denied that such a conversation took place. In late August 2012, then Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi said that the security operations do not threaten anyone, and \\"there should not be any kind of international or regional concerns at all from the presence of Egyptian security forces\\". Morsi added that the campaign was in \\"full respect to international treaties\\". The Egyptian-Israeli peace deal places limits on Egyptian military deployment in the Sinai. Officials in Israel were concerned about Egypt building up heavy armour in Sinai. On 8 September, an Israeli official confirmed that coordination exists between Israel and Egypt regarding Operation Eagle. Egyptian Military spokesman Ahmed Mohammed Ali had earlier announced that Egypt has been consulting with Israel regarding its security measures in the Sinai. United States According to CNN, in a move to increase security in the Sinai, help Morsi, and reassure Israel, U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta offered Egypt classified intelligence-sharing capabilities to help Egypt identify military threats in the area, which he discussed during his recent trips to Egypt and Israel. The technology has been widely used in Iraq and Afghanistan to identify vehicles at great distances. The technology may also be used by the Multinational Force and Observers in Sinai.

On 22 August, the State Department urged Egypt to be transparent over Operation Eagle and any security operations in the Sinai. The State Department said that the United States supports Operation Eagle against terrorism, but stressed that Egypt must continue coordination with Israel regarding these operations and military increases in the Sinai, according to the 1979 Camp David Accords. The State Department also called on Egypt to fulfill its obligations under the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty and deal strongly with security threats in the Sinai, while ensuring that \\"lines of communication stay open.\\" On 23 August, then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, speaking with Egyptian foreign minister Mohamed Kamel Amr, urged Amr to maintain lines of communication with Israel, and emphasized the importance of being transparent over the militarization of the Sinai.

PCC6803 is a strain of unicellular, freshwater cyanobacteria. Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 is capable of both phototrophic growth by oxygenic photosynthesis during light periods and heterotrophic growth by glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation during dark periods. Gene expression is regulated by a circadian clock and the organism can effectively anticipate transitions between the light and dark phases. Evolutionary history Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic prokaryotes that have existed on Earth for an estimated 2.7 billion years. The ability of cyanobacteria to produce oxygen initiated the transition from a planet consisting of high levels of carbon dioxide and little oxygen, to what has been called the Great Oxygenation Event where large amounts of oxygen gas were produced. Cyanobacteria have colonized a wide diversity of habitats, including fresh and salt water ecosystems, and most land environments. Phylogenetically, Synechocystis branches off later in the cyanobacterial evolutionary tree, further from the ancestral root (Gloeobacter violaceus). Synechocystis, which is non-diazotrophic, is closely related to another model organism, Cyanothece ATCC 51442, which is a diazotroph. Thus, it has been proposed that Synechocystis originally possessed the ability to fix nitrogen gas, but lost the genes required for a fully functioning nitrogen fixation (nif) gene cluster. Growth and use as a model organism Cyanobacteria are model microorganisms for the study of photosynthesis, carbon and nitrogen assimilation, evolution of plant plastids, and adaptability to environmental stresses. Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 is one of the most highly studied types of cyanobacteria as it can grow both autotrophically or heterotrophically in the absence of light. It was isolated from a freshwater lake in 1968 and grows best between 32 and 38 degrees Celsius. Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 can readily take up exogenous DNA, in addition to up taking DNA via electroporation, ultrasonic transformation and conjugation. The photosynthetic apparatus is very similar to the one found in land plants. The organism also exhibits phototactic movement. Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 can be grown on either agar plates or in liquid culture. The most widely used culture medium is a BG-11 salt solution. The ideal pH is between 7 and 8.5. A light intensity of 50 Œºmol photons m‚àí2 s‚àí1 leads to best growth. Bubbling with carbon dioxide enriched air (1‚Äì2% CO2) can increase the growth rate, but may require additional buffer to maintain pH Selection is typically performed by antibiotic resistance genes. Heidorn et al. 2011 experimentally determined in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 the ideal concentrations of kanamycin, spectinomycin, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, and gentamycin. Cultures can be kept on agar plates for approximately 2 weeks and re-streaked indefinitely. For long term storage, liquid cell cultures should be stored in a 15% glycerol solution at -80 degrees Celsius. Genome The genome of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 is contained within approximately 12 copies of a single chromosome (3.57 megabases), three small plasmids: pCC5.2 (5.2 kb) pCA2.4 (2.4 kb), and pCB2.4 (2.4 kb) and four large plasmids: pSYSM (120 kb), pSYSX (106 kb), pSYSA (103kb), and pSYSG (44 kb). Additional strains The primary strain of Synechocystis sp. is PCC6803. Further modifications of the parent PCC6803 strain have been created, such as a sub-strain lacking photosystem 1 (PSI). The other widely used sub-strain of Synechocystis sp. is a glucose tolerant strain, ATCC 27184. The parent PCC 6803 strain cannot utilize external glucose. Light-activated heterotrophy Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, sub- strain ATCC 27184 can live heterotrophically in the dark on the carbon source glucose, but for yet unknown reasons requires a minimum of 5 to 15 minutes (blue) light per day. This regulatory role of light is intact in both PSI and PSII deficient strains. Some glycolytic genes are regulated by the genesll1330 under light and glucose-supplemented conditions. One of the most important glycolytic genes is fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (fbaA). The mRNA level of fbaA is increased under light and glucose-supplemented conditions. Native CRISPR-Cas system The CRISPR-Cas (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindrome Repeats ‚Äì CRISPR associated proteins) system provides adaptive immunity in archaea and bacteria. Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 contains three different CRISPR-Cas systems: type I-D, and two versions of type III. All three CRISPR-Cas systems are localize on the pSYSA plasmid. All cyanobacteria are lacking the type II system, which has been widely adapted for genetic engineering purposes across many species. RNA polymerase and sigma factors RNA polymerase (RNAP) and sigma factors are necessary proteins for transcription of DNA into messenger RNA (mRNA). Eubacterial RNAP holoenzymes consist of a core with four major subunits Œ±2 Œ≤Œ≤'. In cyanobacteria, Œ≤' is formed from two smaller subunits (—É and Œ≤'), which corresponds to RNAPs in plant chloroplasts. The beta subunits are responsible for binding the RNAP to the DNA, preventing premature dissociation. In Escherichia coli, the beta \\"clamp\\" first binds loosely and tightens as the RNAP approaches the start codon (AUG). In cyanobacteria, the beta clamp binds tightly at initial binding. The effect of this difference is that synthetic repressible promoters do not function as expected in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. In E. coli, a repressor binds the DNA operon and dislodges RNAP due to the loosely bound beta clamp, whereas in Synechocystis, the RNAP is tightly bound leading the reverse phenomenon where the repressor is knocked off the DNA. Thus the gene is not effectively repressed. Synechocystis possesses the 70S sigma factor (œÉ70), which can be divided into three groups. Group 1 sigma factors are critical for cell viability. Group 2, similar in structure to Group 1, is not essential for cell vitality. Group 3 is structurally different and involved with survival under stress conditions. Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 lacks the œÉN factor found in other organisms, such as Escherichia coli, which is involved with transcribing genes related to nitrogen, but is nonetheless able to metabolize nitrogen. Natural genetic transformation Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 is capable of natural genetic transformation.Grigorieva G, Shestakov S. Transformation in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. 6803 FEMS Microbiology Letters 13 (1982) 367-370 Published by Elsevier Biomedical Press https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1574-6968.1982.tb08289.x For transformation to take place, the recipient bacteria must be in a competent state. A gene, comF, was shown to be involved in competence development in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. Synthetic biology/genetic engineering Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 is considered a model organism, yet there exist few synthetic parts that can be used for genetic engineering. As cyanobacteria in general have slow doubling times (4.5 to 5 h in Synechocystis sp. PCC6301 ), it is more efficient to perform as much DNA cloning as possible in a fast growing host, such as Escherichia coli. In order to create plasmids‚Äîstable, replicating circular pieces of DNA‚Äîthat will function successfully in multiple species, a broad-host-range shuttle vector (see Replicative Plasmids below) is needed. Gene promoters, which control gene expression, need to also predictably work in multiple hosts (see Promoters below). Replicative plasmids Currently there is only one broad-host-range shuttle vector, RSF1010, that successfully replicates in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. RSF1010 is a mobilization plasmid that facilitates conjugation between cells, allowing the horizontal gene transfer of DNA. Additionally, RSF1010 encodes its own replication machinery, so that it does not depend on its host to possess the necessary proteins and assorted factors. Promoters Gene promoters are responsible for recruiting RNAP and facilitating transcription of DNA. Type I promoters consists of a consensus -35 and -10 region (Pribnow box) upstream of the gene start site. Heidorn et al. 2011 compiled a list of native Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 promoters that have been used in synthetic constructs, although this leads to cross talk and non-orthogonal or non- specific gene expression. A handful of Anderson promoters (a group of constitutive promoters collected from a combinatorial library based on the consensus -35 (5'-TTGACA-3) and -10 (5‚Äô-TATAAT-3‚Äô) regions), represented best by BBa_J23101, have been demonstrated to function in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. The iGem Registry hosts these promoter sequences as part of the BioBrick initiative to create interchangeable genetic parts. For synthetic biology, it is critical to have inducible promoters, or genes that can be turned on/off on demand. Several popular inducible promoters in E. coli are the pBad, pTet, and pLac promoters, all of which repress gene expression by a repressor molecule that binds the gene operator and blocks RNAP progression. Progress in engineering Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 is currently hampered by promoter issues. As noted above in RNA Polymerase and Sigma Factors, the beta clamp proteins within the RNAP complex have a higher initial binding affinity in Synechocystis sp. versus other eubacterial models. Thus promoters that turn on/off in response to small binding molecules are less effective in Synechocystis since the RNAP can knock them off the DNA strand. Camsund, Heidorn and Lindblad 2014 attempted to enhance pLac repression in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 by engineering a promoter with multiple operons, thus facilitating DNA looping. Their attempt was too effective, as it was now too difficult to induce transcription in highly repressed variants. Huang and Lindblad 2013 created a library of modified pTet promoters with varying levels of repression and dynamic range in the glucose tolerant Synechocystis sp. ATCC 27184. Another option are promoters that are inducible by heavy metals, such as: zinc, cadmium, cobalt, arsenic, nickel and chromium. Several such promoters were evaluated in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 by Peca 2007. These promoters are not ideal, as metal ions are critical in Synechocystis‚Äô metabolic pathways and altering concentrations can lead to compounding undesired side effects. Additionally, working with these promoters produces waste contaminated with heavy metals, increasing disposal costs Ribosome binding site (RBS) The ribosome binding site (RBS) is the location where a ribosome binds a strand of mRNA and begins translation. In prokaryotes, the RBS includes a Shine-Dalgarno sequence. Little is known about the translation efficiency of RBSs in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. Heidorn et al. 2011 scanned the Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 genome and created a consensus RBS sequence (TAGTGGAGGT), which had 5 times higher output than the consensus E. coli sequence. Terminators Terminators are the DNA signal which halts transcription. No native Synechocystis terminators have been characterized. Biofuel production Cyanobacteria have been used in several ways to produce renewable biofuel. The original method was to grow cyanobacteria for the biomass, which could be converted through liquefaction into liquid fuel. Current estimates suggest that biofuel production from cyanobacteria is unfeasible, as the energy return on energy invested (EROEI) is unfavorable. The EROEI is not advantageous as numerous large, closed loop bioreactors with ideal growth conditions (sunlight, fertilizers, concentrated carbon dioxide, oxygen) need to be constructed and operated, which consumes fossil fuels. Additionally, further post processing of cyanobacterial products is necessary, which requires additional fossil fuels. Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 has been used as a model to increase cyanobacterial energy yields through genetic engineering by the following manipulations: broadening the range of photosynthetic light absorption, altering antenna size in photosystem II, increasing bicarbonate uptake, modifying the Rubisco enzyme to increase carbon fixation, and introduction of biofuel producing metabolic pathways. It is not yet clear whether cyanobacterial biofuels will be a viable future alternative to non-renewable fossil fuels.

Additionally, SynechoNET provides transmembrane topology and domain information, as well as interaction networks in graphical web interfaces. *CyanoBase: Cyanobacteria carry a complete set of genes for oxygenic photosynthesis, which is the most fundamental life process on Earth. This organism is also interesting from an evolutionary viewpoint, for it arose in a very ancient age and has survived in various environments. The algal and land plant chloroplast evolved from cyanobacterial ancestors which developed an endosymbiotic relationship with a eukaryotic host cell. CyanoBase provides an easy way of accessing the sequences and all-inclusive annotation data on the structures of the cyanobacterial genomes. This database was originally developed by Makoto Hirosawa, Takakazu Kaneko and Satoshi Tabata, and the current version of CyanoBase has been developed and maintained by Yasukazu Nakamura, Takakazu Kaneko, and Satoshi Tabata at Kazusa DNA Research Institute. *STRING: STRING is a database of known and predicted protein- protein interactions. The interactions include direct (physical) and indirect (functional) associations; they are derived from four sources: Genomic Context, High-throughput Experiments, (Conserved) Coexpression, and Previous Knowledge. The database currently contains 1,513,782 proteins in 373 species. Especially, the database provides interactions for Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. *cTFbase: cTFbase contains 1288 putative transcription factors (TFs) identified from 21 fully sequenced cyanobacterial genomes. Through its user- friendly interactive interface, users can employ various criteria to retrieve all TF sequences and their detailed annotation information, including sequence features, domain architecture and sequence similarity against the linked databases. Furthermore, cTFbase also provides phylogenetic trees of individual TF family, multiple sequence alignments of the DNA-binding domain and ortholog identification from any selected genomes.

The Treaty with Choctaws and Chickasaws was a treaty signed on July 12, 1861 between the Choctaw and Chickasaw (American Indian) and the Confederate States of America. At the beginning of the American Civil War, Albert Pike was appointed as Confederate envoy to Native Americans. In this capacity he negotiated several treaties, one of the most important being with Cherokee chief John Ross, which was concluded in 1861.Handbook of Texas Online, s.v. \\"Pike, Albert,\\" http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fpi18 (accessed March 4, 2009). The treaty was ratified and was proclaimed on December 20, 1861 by the Confederacy. The Choctaw and Chickasaw also duly ratified the treaty. Some Choctaws identified with The Confederacy and a few owned slaves. In addition, they well remembered and resented the Indian removals from thirty years earlier and poor service they received from the federal government. The main reason the Choctaw Nation agreed to sign the treaty, however, was for protection from regional tribes.  Terms  The preamble begins with, Allen Wright was one of the Commissioners for the Choctaw Nation. Wright, a scholar who compiled a Choctaw dictionary, is credited with creating the state name Red People or Oklahoma. Holmes Colbert was a commissioner for the Chickasaw Nation. Colbert developed the Chickasaw Nation's constitution in the 1850s. The treaty had 64 terms. The following abbreviated terms of the treaty were: # Perpetual peace and friendship # Protection provided by the Confederacy # Confederacy will not abandon or desert them # Boundaries defined # Boundaries defined continued # Safe passage for Choctaws through Chickasaw district # Choctaw and Chickasaw nations to give full assent to the provisions of the act of the Confederacy # Confederacy solemnly guarantees the lands held by the Choctaws and Chickasaws forever # Land never will be sold # No state or territory laws of the Confederacy will be passed for the Choctaws and Chickasaws governments # Confederacy renews leased area from the United States # Indians in the leased area shall be subject to Confederacy laws until they are capable of self-government or subjected to Choctaw and Chickasaw laws. # Confederacy waterways are free to Choctaw and Chickasaw nations. # Choctaw and Chickasaw nations have unrestricted right of self-government # Intruders in Choctaw or Chickasaw nations subjected to removal by the nations or the Confederacy # Land tracts set aside for Confederacy agencies # Confederacy forts in Choctaw and Chickasaw country # Confederacy right of way for railroads, telegraph lines # No Settlements or farms near forts, posts, or agencies # Appointments for Confederacy agent and interpreter # Protection from other domestic strife, white or Indian hostilities # Legal assistance, intrusion prevention, and removal of dangerous or improper persons # Property thief and recovery and payments for property not found # Licensed traders approved by National Council and trading taxed # United States laws removed that regulated Choctaw or Chickasaw selling # Choctaws and Chickasaws can take, hold and pass, purchase or descent lands in any of the Confederate States # Choctaws and Chickasaws are entitled to one representative in the House of Representatives of the Confederate States of America # Choctaw and Chickasaw country may be admitted as a state when they elect to do so and become citizens in the Confederate States of America # Land sales proceeds belong to members of the Choctaw and Chickasaw # If Creek, Seminole, and Cherokee desire to become part of the Confederate States of America, then their countries maybe annexed to become part of the Choctaw and Chickasaw confederate state # Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations may incorporate and determine who may be citizens of their respective nation # Confederate citizens trying to settle Choctaw and Chicaksaw Nations forfeit protection of the Confederate States and maybe uncruelly punished by said nations # Confederate citizens may not pasture stock on Choctaw or Chickasaw Nations. Confederate citizens may peaceable pass thru Choctaw or Chickasaw Nations, and the Choctaws and Chickasaws have the same privileges in the Confederate States. # Violators of laws shall be removed. # Movement and settlement rights, voting rights, and prosecution in each nations courts. # Criminal jurisdiction # Return of criminals between Choctaw/Chickasaw Nations and Confederate State of America. # Creation of a Confederate States district court called Tush-ca-hom-ma to carry out the provisions of this treaty. # Acts of Congress of the United States will be continued by the Confederate States, provide the common defense and welfare, district court shall have exclusive jurisdiction. # Tush-ca-hom-ma district shall have the same admiralty jurisdiction as other district courts of the Confederate States. # Trials for offenses in nation will be held in Confederate States district court. # Offenses committed before the signing of the treaty will not be prosecuted.

Aftermath From about 1865 to 1918, Mississippi Choctaws were largely ignored by governmental, health, and educational services and fell into obscurity. In the aftermath of the Civil War, their issues were pushed aside in the struggle between defeated Confederates, freedmen and Union sympathizers. The Confederacy's loss was also the Choctaw Nation's loss. The Choctaw Nation, in what would be Oklahoma, kept slavery until 1866. After the Civil War, they were required by treaty with the United States to free the slaves within their nation. Former slaves of the Choctaw Nation were called the Choctaw Freedmen. After considerable debate, Choctaw Freedmen were granted Choctaw Nation citizenship in 1885. In post-war treaties, the US government also acquired land in the western part of the territory and access rights for railroads to be built across Indian Territory.

Jumeau was an 1840s French firm that produced bisque dolls and china dolls. His second son Emile-Louis Jumeau, born in 1843, began assuming management of the company in the 1870s. Pierre- Fran√ßois's family owned a fabric shop in R√©malard, south-west of Paris, in 1837. On a business trip to Paris he met and eventually married in January 1841 the niece of one of the few dollmakers in France, Lucius-Junius Herissey. Jumeau gained invaluable experience by joining the Herissey business, which had good prospects due to the improved French economy and the growth of international markets. In 1841 Jumeau was in partnership with Louis-Desire Belton, but started his own business a few years later after the death of his wife in 1844. By 1848 Jumeau had become the foremost doll manufacturer, had won a bronze medal at the 1849 Paris Exposition and was invited in 1851 to take part in the Crystal Palace Exhibition in London where he won a First Place Medal, the dresses being singled out for praise. The Jumeau dolls were widely acclaimed, winning numerous awards at international exhibitions. The first dolls were papier-m√¢ch√© and were unmarked, causing present-day attribution problems, so that only a small number of Jumeau dolls made before the 1870s can be identified with certainty. In the 1850s glazed porcelain dolls had been added to the firm's inventory, but the bisque dolls were its greatest success, and the company acquired a reputation for the beauty, grace, elegance and quality of its products.Dolls in the Looking-glass In 1872, Pierre-Fran√ßois, unhappy with the dolls' heads from Germany, started a porcelain factory at Montreuil to produce his own heads and began supplying other dollmakers. From his marriage to Ad√®le Am√©lie Aumoitte, Pierre-Fran√ßois produced two children, Georges Eug√®ne (1841‚Äì1873) and Emile (born 18 April 1843). Ad√®le died on 16 May 1843 following Emile's birth. In 1854, Pierre- Fran√ßois married Ad√©la√Øde Elisa Mayo who died in 1888. Emile-Louis Jumeau Emile-Louis Jumeau 1890 Jumeau's second son Emile-Louis, born in 1843, who built the Ch√¢teau Jumeau or Villa Jumeau in Longny-au-Perche in 1866, began assuming management of the company and in 1877 he introduced the B√©b√© Incassable, with a head made by Jumeau, the face of a young girl and a fully articulated composition body. Jumeau's dolls were fashionably dressed in the styles popular at the time, and often had shapely mature figures. As with modern Barbie dolls, large ranges of clothing styles and accessories were made available. In 1878 the company was awarded a gold medal at the Paris Exhibition, an honour which was proudly advertised on all their products. Further awards followed at the International Exhibitions in Sydney in 1879 and Melbourne in 1880. In 1885, at the Antwerp Exhibition, Jumeau's dolls won the Dipl√¥me d‚ÄôHonneur, an award subsequently commemorated by being stamped on every doll made. The golden age of the company spanned the period from the late 1870s to the late 1890s when the company employed over 200 workers with an annual output of 100 000 dolls. Emile-Louis' expansion into the international market pushed sales to new heights. In 1879 the Emperor's sculptor, Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse was commissioned by Jumeau to fashion an epicene head, to be used as that of either boy or girl. Carrier-Belleuse is reputed to have used a portrait of King Henry of Navarra at age four as model and the design became known as Jumeau Triste. Emile-Louis becomes a Knight of the L√©gion d‚ÄôHonneur in 1889. Henri Lioret, a French watchmaker and pioneer in the manufacture of talking machines, helps the firm develop B√©b√© Phonographe, the talking doll in 1894. The plant at Montreuil outside Paris put together the finely featured heads with glass eyes, composition bodies (originally wood or kid-leather) with jointed limbs and articulated fingers. Here they also produced hats, gloves, shoes, muffs, stockings and underwear for the dolls. Emil-Louis' wife, Ernestine Jumeau, working from the Rue Pastourelle, decided on designs and fabrics that would complete the elaborate costumes that made the Jumeau firm's dolls a household word. French dollmakers were eventually forced to close down by cheaper German dolls appearing on the market in the 1890s. As a final attempt at economic survival, they joined forces as the Soci√©t√© Fran√ßaise de Fabrication de B√©b√©s et Jouets (SFBJ). When the Jumeau company finally wound up its business in 1899, the remaining stock was taken over by the SFBJ. This included large numbers of b√©b√©s, heads, bodies, costumes and other components, making attribution to Jumeau or SFBJ extremely difficult of dolls turned out during the transition period. Jumeau dolls are usually marked with a simple number, although the body may also be stamped. The Tete Jumeau is marked 'Depose Tete Jumeau' behind the head.Doll Collecting The Jumeau models included Deposes, E. J. B√©b√©s, Triste, Portrait B√©b√©, Poup√©e de Modes, B√©b√© Phonographe and Tete Jumeau B√©b√©s. Some of the earlier models are much sought-after and reproduction of Jumeau dolls supports a thriving industry. References Bibliography *The Jumeau Doll ‚Äì Margaret Whitton; J.

In 1751, a mass fist fight took place on a street in Saint Petersburg, which came to the attention of Empress Elizabeth of Russia. After that the Empress forbade the organization of fist fights on the territory of Moscow and Saint Petersburg. During the reign of Catherine the Great, the popularity of fist fighting was growing again, and it is said that Count Orlov was a good fist fighter himself and even invited notable fist fighters to compare powers. In 1832, Nicholas I of Russia completely forbade fist fights as \\"harmful fun\\". Legacy K.V. Gradopolov, then the most important Soviet specialist in Boxing, authored a 1941 work about using proper technique when fist-fighting. In that book, he offered a new exercise, called \\"group boxing\\", and he mentioned it was an ancient Russian sport (what he was talking about, was the \\"Stenka na Stenku\\" version). \\"1941 –≥–æ–¥—É –≤–µ–¥—É—â–∏–π —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–∏–π —Å–ø–µ—Ü–∏–∞–ª–∏—Å—Ç –ø–æ –±–æ–∫—Å—É –ö. –í. –ì—Ä–∞–¥–æ–ø–æ–ª–æ–≤ —Ä–∞—Å—Å–∫–∞–∑—ã–≤–∞–ª –≤ —Å–≤–æ–µ–π –∫–Ω–∏–≥–µ –æ –º–µ—Ç–æ–¥–∞—Ö –æ–±—É—á–µ–Ω–∏—è –≤–æ–∏–Ω–æ–≤ –∫—É–ª–∞—á–Ω–æ–º—É –ø—Ä–∏–∫–ª–∞–¥–Ω–æ–º—É –∏—Å–∫—É—Å—Å—Ç–≤—É. –ü—Ä–µ–¥–ª–∞–≥–∞–ª–æ—Å—å —Ç–∞–º —Ç–∞–∫–æ–µ –Ω–µ–æ–±—ã—á–Ω–æ–µ —É–ø—Ä–∞–∂–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ, –∫–∞–∫ ¬´–≥—Ä—É–ø–ø–æ–≤–æ–π –±–æ–∫—Å¬ª. –ê–≤—Ç–æ—Ä –ø—Ä—è–º–æ —É–∫–∞–∑—ã–≤–∞–ª, —á—Ç–æ ¬´–ø—Ä–æ–æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–æ–º –≥—Ä—É–ø–ø–æ–≤–æ–≥–æ –±–æ–∫—Å–∞ (–æ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω–∏–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∏ –æ–≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—á–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –æ–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–º–∏ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏–ª–∞–º–∏) —è–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç—Å—è —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π —Å–∞–º–æ–±—ã—Ç–Ω—ã–π –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω—ã–π —Å–ø–æ—Ä—Ç ¬´—Å—Ç–µ–Ω–∫–∞ –Ω–∞ —Å—Ç–µ–Ω–∫—É¬ª.

He said there that the prototype of the 'group boxing' was the Russian folk sport \\"Wall on Wall\\"] Rules and types Every region in Russia incorporated different rules unlike the sport of boxing. In some places they fought with bare arms, while in other they stretched the sleeves over the fists.

One version was like modern boxing, where one fighter hits the other wherever he wants or can. The other version is when the fighters take turns hitting each other. Escaping from a punch, answering it not on turn, and moving aside were not allowed; all that could be done was to use the hands to try to protect one's own body.Labzyuk, Sergei, \\"–ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è —Å–ø—Ä–∞–≤–∫–∞: –∫—É–ª–∞—á–Ω—ã–π –±–æ–π\\". \\"–¢–∞–∫–∂–µ —Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–ª –∫—É–ª–∞—á–Ω—ã–π –±–æ–π '—É–¥–∞—Ä –Ω–∞ —É–¥–∞—Ä' –∏–ª–∏ '—Ä–∞–∑ –∑–∞ —Ä–∞–∑', –∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–∏–∫–∏ –Ω–∞–Ω–æ—Å–∏–ª–∏ —É–¥–∞—Ä—ã –ø–æ –æ—á–µ—Ä–µ–¥–∏. –£–∫–ª–æ–Ω—è—Ç—å—Å—è –æ—Ç —É–¥–∞—Ä–∞, –æ—Ç–≤–µ—á–∞—Ç—å –Ω–∞ –Ω–µ–≥–æ, –ø–µ—Ä–µ—Å—Ç—É–ø–∞—Ç—å –Ω–æ–≥–∞–º–∏ –∑–∞–ø—Ä–µ—â–∞–ª–æ—Å—å, –º–æ–∂–Ω–æ –±—ã–ª–æ –ª–∏—à—å –ø—Ä–∏–∫—Ä—ã—Ç—å —Ä—É–∫–∞–º–∏ –Ω–∞–∏–±–æ–ª–µ–µ —É—è–∑–≤–∏–º—ã–µ –º–µ—Å—Ç–∞.

[There were different types of rules. 1. Till one falls. 2. Till first blood. 3.

Both \\"walls\\" had a chief fighter, who served as a tactician and a commanding officer. \\"Walls\\" themselves were tight straight formations 3-4 ranks deep. Repeated attacks were performed, aiming to push the opposing \\"wall\\" out of the game area. Basic tactics were used, such as breaching using heavy fighters (who were usually held in reserve), encircling, false retreat and others; but as a rule, tight wall formation never broke. Tactics also included battle planning. The \\"wall-on-wall\\" fights, while performed for entertainment, were in fact close to military training. For example, notable ethnographer V. Gilyarovsky recalled that during his voluntary service in an infantry regiment soldiers often staged wall-on-wall fistfights with factory workers.–ö—É–ª–∞—á–Ω—ã–π –±–æ–π –Ω–∞ –†—É—Å–∏ –°–ø–æ—Ä—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–∞—è –∂–∏–∑–Ω—å magazine, No. 7 1998 A famous phrase in Russian, \\"Do not hit a man when he's down\\", has roots in that sport. \\"–û–¥–Ω–æ –∏–∑ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏–ª –∫—É–ª–∞—á–Ω–æ–≥–æ –±–æ—è —Å—Ç–∞–ª–æ –¥–∞–∂–µ –ø–æ—Å–ª–æ–≤–∏—Ü–µ–π, —Å–∏–º–≤–æ–ª–∏–∑–∏—Ä—É—é—â–µ–π —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–µ –±–ª–∞–≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–æ –≤ –±–æ—é: ¬´–õ–µ–∂–∞—á–µ–≥–æ –Ω–µ –±—å—é—Ç¬ª.

The most famous portrayal of a Russian fistfight is in Mikhail Lermontov's poem, The Song of the Merchant Kalashnikov. There, the fistfight tales place as a form of honor duel between an oprichnik (government police agent) and a merchant. It is notable that, according to Lermontov, both characters use combat gloves ('rukavitsy' ‚Äî reinforced mittens). Though it may be an example of poetic license, the poem states that the first connected blow by Kalashnikov bent a large bronze cross hanging from his opponent's neck, and the second fractured the opponent's temple, killing him. The fight also features in the opera The Merchant Kalashnikov by Anton Rubinstein (1880). In the 19th century Sergei Aksakov watched famous fist fights in the Kaban frozen lake in Kazan, and later wrote about them in his \\"Story about student life\\". Some decades later, at the same lake, the young future opera-singer Feodor Chaliapin took part in a similar fight: \\"From one side came we, the Russians of Kazan, from the other side the Tatars. We fought hard without feeling sorry for ourselves, but never broke the historic rules of not to hit one that is already down, not to kick, and not to keep iron up one's sleeves\\". \\"–ï—â–µ –≤ 1806 –≥–æ–¥—É –°. –¢. –ê–∫—Å–∞–∫–æ–≤ –Ω–∞–±–ª—é–¥–∞–ª –∑–Ω–∞–º–µ–Ω–∏—Ç—ã–µ –∫—É–ª–∞—á–Ω—ã–µ –±–æ–∏ –≤ –ö–∞–∑–∞–Ω–∏, –Ω–∞ –ª—å–¥—É –æ–∑–µ—Ä–∞ –ö–∞–±–∞–Ω, –∏ –≤–ø–æ—Å–ª–µ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–∏–∏ –æ–ø–∏—Å–∞–ª –∏—Ö –≤ —Å–≤–æ–µ–º ¬´–†–∞—Å—Å–∫–∞–∑–µ –æ —Å—Ç—É–¥–µ–Ω—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π –∂–∏–∑–Ω–∏¬ª. –ê —á–µ—Ä–µ–∑ –≤–æ—Å–µ–º—å –¥–µ—Å—è—Ç–∏–ª–µ—Ç–∏–π –≤ —Ç–µ—Ö –∂–µ –±–æ—è—Ö –∞–∑–∞—Ä—Ç–Ω–æ –¥—Ä–∞–ª—Å—è –≤–µ–ª–∏–∫–∏–π —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π –∞—Ä—Ç–∏—Å—Ç –§. –ò. –®–∞–ª—è–ø–∏–Ω. –£–∂–µ —É–≤–µ–Ω—á–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–π –º–∏—Ä–æ–≤–æ–π —Å–ª–∞–≤–æ–π, –æ–Ω –¥–µ–ª–∏–ª—Å—è –¥–æ—Ä–æ–≥–∏–º–∏ –µ–≥–æ —Å–µ—Ä–¥—Ü—É –≤–æ—Å–ø–æ–º–∏–Ω–∞–Ω–∏—è–º–∏: ¬´–°—Ö–æ–¥–∏–ª–∏—Å—å —Å –æ–¥–Ω–æ–π —Å—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–Ω—ã –º—ã, –∫–∞–∑–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∞—è –†—É—Å—å, —Å –¥—Ä—É–≥–æ–π - –¥–æ–±—Ä–æ–¥—É—à–Ω—ã–µ —Ç–∞—Ç–∞—Ä—ã. –î—Ä–∞–ª–∏—Å—å –æ—Ç—á–∞—è–Ω–Ω–æ, –Ω–µ —â–∞–¥—è –Ω–∏ —Å–µ–±—è, –Ω–∏ –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤. –ù–æ –∏ –≤ –≥–æ—Ä—è—á–∫–µ —è—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–Ω–æ–π –±–∏—Ç–≤—ã –Ω–∏–∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ –Ω–µ –Ω–∞—Ä—É—à–∞–ª–∏ —É—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –∏—Å–∫–æ–Ω–∏ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏–ª: –ª–µ–∂–∞—á–µ–≥–æ –Ω–µ –±–∏—Ç—å, –ø—Ä–∏—Å–µ–≤—à–µ–≥–æ –Ω–∞ –∫–æ—Ä—Ç–æ—á–∫–∏ - —Ç–æ–∂–µ, –Ω–æ–≥–∞–º–∏ –Ω–µ –¥—Ä–∞—Ç—å—Å—è, —Ç—è–∂–µ—Å—Ç–∏ –≤ —Ä—É–∫–∞–≤–∏—Ü—ã –Ω–µ –ø—Ä—è—Ç–∞—Ç—å¬ª.\\" Later the young Chaliapin was attacked in a fight over a girl, but thanks to his proficiency in fist fighting, he won.

Its campus includes two buildings: the Ladd-Gilman House, a registered National Historic Landmark built in 1721 by Nathaniel Ladd, and the Folsom Tavern, built in 1775 by Colonel Samuel Folsom. The museum was opened in 1991 after a rare copy of the Declaration of Independence known as a Dunlap Broadside was found in the Ladd-Gilman house, 200 years after its arrival in Exeter. It is the centerpiece of the museum‚Äôs collection. The museum‚Äôs mission is ‚ÄúConnecting America‚Äôs Revolutionary past with the present.‚Äù History The American Independence opened in 1991, six years after a Dunlap Broadside was found in the attic floorboards of the Ladd-Gilman House. In August 1985, an electrician was wiring for a security system, when he pulled from under the attic floor old newspaper clippings and the Broadside. The electrician contacted the Society, who had the document authenticated. The Society opened the museum to educate visitors about the Declaration and the American Revolution. Since the museum‚Äôs opening, the museum has restored the Folsom Tavern, adding additional material and space to the museum. The museum now focuses on Revolutionary history and the role of Exeter and the Gilman family in the forming of the new nation. Ladd-Gilman House The Ladd-Gilman House, circa 1914 The Ladd-Gilman House was the home of an 18th-century merchant family whose members played key roles in the birth of the United States. Nicholas Gilman, Sr. served as the New Hampshire state treasurer during the American Revolution when the capital of New Hampshire moved from Portsmouth to Exeter. Eldest son John Taylor Gilman read the Declaration of Independence to the citizens of Exeter in 1776 and later became New Hampshire governor for 14 non-consecutive terms between 1794 and 1805, and then again in 1813 to 1816. Nicholas Gilman, Jr. was a member of the Continental Army and a signer of the U.S. Constitution. In the early 20th century, the Society of the Cincinnati of New Hampshire purchased the building from the Gilman family and used the building as its meeting house, before converting the building into the museum. There are 7 rooms in the house open to the public for tours, with later additions now housing museum administration and a research library. Folsom Tavern The Folsom Tavern after restoration Exeter was the capital of New Hampshire when Colonel Samuel Folsom built his tavern in 1775. During the Revolutionary War, it was the site of many passionate political debates and was a popular spot with men of the town after. It was originally located on the corner of Court and Mill streets (now Front and Water streets). The New Hampshire chapter of the Society of Cincinnati formed in the tavern in 1783. George Washington stopped at the tavern for a collation on November 4, 1789, during his tour of the states. After Col. Folsom‚Äôs death in 1790, the tavern was willed to his widow and his two daughters who continued to operate the tavern, and became known as ‚ÄúWidow Folsom‚Äôs Tavern‚Äù. It stayed in the Folsom family until 1856. The restored front of the Folsom Tavern, which faces downtown Water Street in ExeterThe tavern was bought in 1929 by the Society of the Cincinnati and moved to the Ladd-Gilman house. In 1947, Martha Foster Stearns, a preservationist and Colonial Dame, proposed to restore the tavern, in exchange for a long-term residential lease. The society agreed, and the Stearns restored and modernized much of the original tavern. The Stearns lived in the Tavern until 1956. Between 1956 and 1992, the tavern was leased out to neighboring Phillips Exeter Academy as a faculty residence. In 2004, the tavern was moved to its current location on museum grounds, at the intersection of Spring and Water Streets. Extensive restoration on the building included the installation of a new roof and clapboards. Interior restoration began in 2006, after receiving a grant from New Hampshire's Land and Community Heritage Investment Program. The tavern opened in 2007, and is now part of the museum's regular tour. It is also used as a programming location for the museum, and is often rented out by third parties. Collections The museum's collection of historical artifacts includes the Dunlap Broadside, two rare draft copies of the U.S. Constitution and a Badge of Military Merit (the original Purple Heart), awarded by General George Washington to soldiers demonstrating extraordinary bravery. Some of the museum‚Äôs other collections are period furniture, decorative arts from the 18th and 19th centuries, 18th century weaponry, military ephemera, letters, documents, and portraits of American statesmen. Dunlap Broadside In 1985, the Broadside of the Declaration of Independence was found in the upstairs floorboards when electricians were wiring a security system for the house. This particular copy was the 23rd copy found, and now one of 26 copies known to exist. These copies of the Declaration were printed by John Dunlap, the night of July 4th. Dunlap was asked to print at least 150 and no more than 200 copies of the broadside. One was to go to each of the state capitals, military encampments, and several sent to England to inform King George III. The museum's particular broadside reached Exeter on July 16, 1776, and was read by John Taylor Gilman, the eldest son of the Gilman household, to the people of Exeter. The broadside is displayed once a year on the third Saturday of July during the museum's American Independence Festival, that commemorates the arrival of the document and the reading by John Taylor Gilman. Programming The museum is open seasonally, June through October, Thursday through Saturday, from 10am to 4pm. Guided tours of the Ladd-Gilman House and Folsom Tavern are available at 10 am, noon and 2 pm; self-guided tours are available until 3 pm. The museum hosts a variety of public programs; the largest is the American Independence Festival, held annually during July. The Festival engages thousands of visitors in the nation's 18th century heritage. American Independence Festival The American Independence Festival, previously known as the Revolutionary War Festival, is an annual festival produced by the American Independence Museum. The Festival, held the 3rd Saturday in July, commemorates the original reading of the Dunlap Broadside in Exeter on July 16, 1776. The opening celebration starts with a parade of reenactors and a reading of the Declaration of Independence to festival-goers. The original Dunlap Broadside is displayed in the museum during the Festival. In addition, artisans engage visitors with traditional crafts; craft and local non-profit booths and food vendors round out the event. The event attracts thousands of visitors every year. The next American Independence Festival is July 20, 2019.

In partnership with the government, it also operates 20 schools across the country of Belize.From: About the DioceseAnglican Schools of Belize - the list History of the diocese In some sense, to understand the history of the Anglican Church in the midst of the history of Belize, one has to look back to the Indian tribes of the Moskito (or Mosquito) Shore in the mid- eighteenth century. After repeated appeals by Mr Peat, Rector of Jamestown, Jamaica, the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (SPG) sent a succession of missionaries to work among the Indians. This started sometime after 1747 with Nathan Prince. Many of these missionaries did not fare well, succumbing to the harsh conditions and dying shortly after arrival in the region. Early chaplains to the Belize Settlement The Moskito Coast Mission received Robert Shaw in 1774. However, in 1776, due to illness and inability to bear the climate there, Shaw was forced to return to England ‚Äì being replaced by William Standord. On his way from the Mosquito Coast, Shaw made a stop in the Belize settlement (the ‚ÄòBay Settlement‚Äô) which then consisted of British buccaneers living on St George's Caye, located a few miles offshore the mainland. Shaw stayed on to become the first chaplain of the Belize settlement. Shaw's chaplaincy was interrupted by a Spanish invasion in 1779 from which Shaw escaped to the Moskito Shore. The public records make no mention of a permanent chaplain between the late 1780s and 1794, perhaps because of the unsettled times resulting from the territorial dispute between Mexico and England, including the Battle of St. George's Caye in September 1789, now celebrated on 10 September, annually. Ecclesiastical functions were carried out by the magistrates during this period. In March 1794, William Stanford was appointed as chaplain. By this time the settlement had moved to the mainland, developing into what became known as Belize Town (today's Belize City). Despite early confrontations with the settlers and Superintendent, Stanford later became a Police Magistrate. This was a full-time administrative and judicial office in the local government and a most influential position. In 1803, by resolution of the magistrates, and through the efforts of Stanford, public funds were used to support the chaplaincy. Between 1776 and 1810, the two chaplains (Shaw and Stanford) were more involved in the affairs concerning the government of the settlements than to that of the Church. They were more social stabilizers than evangelists. Yet partly due to their efforts and a growing sense of permanence among the settlers, the settlement was preparing to build a church building, call a rector and establish a school by 1810. on the twentieth of July, 1812, that the foundation stone of what was to become St John's Cathedral was laid by the then-Superintendent, Lt. Colonel John Nugent Smyth. By 1817 the magistrates were petitioning for assistance for the completion of the building. in 1818 the SPG approved $200 for the project. Beginnings of the Evangelical influence Around this time John Armstrong arrived to replace Standford as the third chaplain of the settlement. His arrival was to produce remarkable changes in the relationship between the Church and the community at large. Armstrong was the product of the Wesleyan- initiated Evangelical Awakening that was taking place in England. Armstrong thus marked the start of the evangelical influence in Belize. Two years later, in 1814, when the settlement received its new Superintendent in the person of Sir George Arthur, the evangelical influence intensified. Arthur was also an Evangelical Anglican with very strong Calvinist views. He and Armstrong embarked upon a program to reform the society much to the disgust of many of the settlers. He condemned their drunkenness, immorality, cruelty to the slaves and the injustice of their courts. Armstrong and Arthur did not always agree on certain issues of government, however. Arthur's constant meddling in Armstrong's work often created tensions between them. Yet both men were driven by similar religious convictions. They did their best to advance the work of the Church in the settlement by erecting chapels and opening schools. Armstrong periodically expressed his desire to extend his ministry to the Indians near the settlement and at the Moskito Shore, but was never able to pursue this goal. During their time, on November 19, 1823, about 19,500 Garinagu Garifuna refugees arrived in Belize,Garifuna Timeline Belize a date commemorated since 1941 as Garifuna Settlement Day. By 1825 the early evangelical influence had all but come to an end following the departure of Arthur and Armstrong, and thanks to the efforts of the majority of the settlers. Arthur was replaced by General Edward Codd, and Armstrong by Matthew Newport in 1824. Newport was ‚Äòa high Churchman of the old eighteenth century type‚Äô who believed in the historic orthodoxy of the Church. His determination to return to traditional Anglicanism characterized the approach to his chaplaincy. He was to make the settlement his home for the next thirty six years. Under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Jamaica St. John's Church in 1825 On the thirteenth of April, 1826, St John's Church was consecrated by Christopher Lipscomb, Bishop of Jamaica. He had earlier, in July 1824, been consecrated and appointed to the Jamaican See with jurisdiction over the Church in the Belize settlement in accordance with the creation of the Diocese of Jamaica, with state-supplied stipends for two clergymen. His visit marked the first such visit of a bishop to the Belize settlement. About this time In 1830, Codrington CollegeCodrington College Official Web site in Barbados started to prepare candidates exclusively to become priests, and in 1833 in England, the Anglo-Catholic Oxford Movement was beginning.The History of the Diocese of Jamaica and the Cayman Islands This relationship with the Diocese of Jamaica proved beneficial for the Church in the Bay Settlement. A grant from the SPG's Negro Instruction Fund was secured for the erection of a school at Belize Town as part of the effort to provide education for the slaves who were now legally free. SPG missionaries could now also be sent from Jamaica to Belize, such as Charles Mortlock in 1844‚Äìthe first in over forty years. The expansion of Belize Town to the north in the mid-1800s necessitated the construction of a second church building. A small wooden building was erected on the north side of the town dedicated to St Mary the Virgin. It was consecrated by the evangelical Aubrey Spencer, Bishop of Jamaica, in 1852. A few years later, the Anglo-Guatemalan Treaty of 1859 was signed, a basis for Guatemala's current and disputed claims about Belizean boundaries. The Bishop of Jamaica in 1862 sought the support of the SPG in a scheme for the establishment of a mission in Northern British Honduras. By 1868 the bishop was able to send A. T. Giolme to Corozal. Disestablishment On 2 August 1872, the Anglican Church in British Honduras was disestablished following that of Jamaica in 1870. Some have suggested that by this time the prominence of the Anglican Church was already on the wane due to internal differences within the Church concerning ‚ÄòHigh‚Äô and ‚ÄòLow‚Äô church forms of worship; the growing strength of the non-conformists (primarily Methodist and Baptist); and the arrival of the Roman Catholic Church within the influx of the Yucat√°n refugees from the Caste War of Yucat√°n. These developments changed the status of the Church in the settlement which then had to become more self-supporting. The disestablishment of the churches in Jamaica and British Honduras also placed both churches under separate jurisdictions. When Reginal Courtenay, resigned as Bishop of Jamaica in 1879, his successor, William Tozer, was separately appointed as Bishop of Honduras, holding the title even after he had resigned the Jamaican See. Tozer's replacement, Enos Nuttall, had been a former Methodist missionary to Jamaica who became Bishop of Jamaica in 1880. He was requested by the Archbishop of CanterburyOfficial site of the Archbishop of Canterbury to reorganize the Church in British Honduras. Nuttall succeeded in getting the Colonial Office to make some amendments to the Disestablishment Law thereby securing the property of the Church, passed as the Church of England Act of 19 February 1883. During a visit to the colony in 1883, Nuttal was able to supervise the reorganization process. William Austin of Guyana became the first Primate of the Province of the West Indies in 1883. Nuttall later became Primate in 1893; his title of Primate was changed to Archbishop of the West Indies in 1897 Separate diocese On 10 August 1883, through instrument by Edward Benson, Archbishop of Canterbury, the Church in Belize was duly constituted into a separate bishopric and diocese. Nuttall of Jamaica continued to exercise jurisdiction over the diocese until 1891. Extended diocese Henry Holme was consecrated first bishop of British Honduras in St Michael's Cathedral, Barbados, on the first of March 1891. This was the first such consecration in the West Indies. Holme arrived in the colony on the fourth of April but died four months later in a shipwreck. He was succeeded by George Albert Ormsby whose appointment took place in 1893 with the SPG contributing to his stipend. A year later, on 10 January 1894, Ormsby's jurisdiction was extended to include Guatemala, Spanish Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica. By 1895 it was further extended to include Panama, Bolivia, Magdalena, Isthmus of Panama, and the City of Panama. Ormsby divided the colony of British Honduras itself into eight large mission districts and had eighteen clergy at work throughout his extended diocese. Grants from the SPG were a great support for these expansions. Ormsby was succeeded in 1908 by Herbert Bury. At this time the diocese was reduced by transferring the Isthmus of Panama and all areas south of it to the jurisdiction of the Protestant Episcopal Church of the USA. Bishops to follow Bury included Walter Farrar in 1912, and Edward Dunn in 1917. Dunn remained bishop until 1943, and at the same time became Archbishop of the West Indies, 1936‚Äì1943. By 1927, Dunn had ten clergy to serve six countries. Much work was maintained among the Moskito Indians who gave generously to the Church, longing to live under the rule of the British flag, as their ancestors had so done. The shortage of priests remained, however. In 1930 the Diocese of DerbyHistory of the Diocese of Derby in England sought to assist by sending priests to work in the Diocese of British Honduras. Steven L. Caiger was among the first to go. He first served in British Honduras itself and later in Guatemala. He was followed by R. A. Pratt, who later became Archdeacon of Belize. The 1931 hurricane that devastated the Colony of British Honduras caused tremendous damage to church property. The Cathedral, St Mary's Church, and their respective rectories were seriously damaged. Again the SPG came to the rescue making a grant from the Marriot Bequest. Further depression set in when the United Fruit Company began to suffer serious losses in the 1930s. James Hughes, served as bishop from 1944 to 1945, and he was succeeded by Douglas Wilson, who served as bishop from 1945 to 1950. (Wilson had been assistant bishop since 1938.) Between 1947 and 1957 the diocese was reduced by transferring Panama, El Salvador (Iglesia Episcopal Anglicana de El Salvador),The Official Diocesan Web page of the Iglesia Episcopal Anglicana de El Salvador Honduras (Di√≥cesis de Honduras), and Guatemala (Iglesia Episcopal de Guatemala) to the jurisdiction of the Episcopal Church of the USA. The diocese was now back to its original geographical area of British Honduras. During this time Gerald Brooks, began serving as bishop 1950, and he remained bishop to 1966. During Brooks' tenure, Hurricane Hattie submerged Belize City in 1961, and Belize became self- governing.The British Monarchy Official Web site Brooks was succeeded by Benjamin Vaughan, who served as bishop from 1967 to 1971, and 1970 the capital of Belize was officially moved from Belize City to Belmopan, and subsequently, St Ann's Church was constructed in Belmopan. Eldon Sylvester began serving as Bishop of British Honduras in 1972. Wider context In 1973, when the name \\"British Honduras\\" was changed to \\"Belize\\" and when Sylvester was serving as bishop, the diocese became known as the \\"Church of England in Belize\\", and Sylvester's title changed to \\"Bishop of Belize\\". With the passage of the Anglican Diocese of Belize Act in 2013, the name of the diocese became known as the \\"Anglican Church in the Diocese of Belize\\". In 1975, the Diocese of Belize established a ‚Äòcompanion relationship‚Äô Companion Relationships - Episcopal Church with the Diocese of New York of The Episcopal Church. In 1978, Sylvester ended his tenure as bishop was succeeded by K. A. McMillan, who served as bishop from 1980 to 1988 (being bishop on 21 September 1981 when Belize became an independent member of the British Commonwealth: Independence Day). McMillan was succeeded by Brother D. Smith SSF, bishop from 1989‚Äì1992, and Smith was succeeded by Sylvester Romero, bishop from 1994 to 2004.

Through its affiliation with local, regional and international women's organisations, SWAN establishes common platforms to promote the role of women from Burma in the struggle for democracy and human rights in the country. Set up on 28 March 1999 by a group of Shan women seeking to address the practical and strategic needs of Shan women, SWAN established the informal networks already in place between the various Shan women's projects, therefore strengthening and supporting them. The network is also a founding member of the Women's League of Burma (WLB), an umbrella organisation comprising twelve women's groups from Burma.  Objectives  The Network's main objectives are: * To promote women's rights and the rights of children. * To oppose exploitation of and violence against women and children. * To work together for peace and freedom. * To empower women for a better life. * To raise awareness of the importance of preserving natural resources and the environment. The Shan women's network would also be able to co- ordinate with other women's organisations from Burma, as well as GOs and NGOs working with women locally, nationally and internationally. Currently the network is engaged in several programs designed to improve the situations of many Shan women, in areas such as education, health, women's empowerment, crisis support and income generation.The Shan Women‚Äôs Action Network Recognition On 31 October 2005, SWAN activist Charm Tong visited the White House to discuss the Burmese political situation with US president George W.

The Irrawaddy wrote in December of that year that lobbyists were attributing Bush's subsequent \\"outspokenness on Burma\\" to \\"the Charm Tong Effect\\". For her work with SWAN in investigating and publicising abuses against Shan women by the Burmese military, Charm Tong received the Marie Claire Women of the World Award in 2004 and The Reebok Human Rights Award in 2005.> She also received the 2007 Student Peace Prize, which was awarded to her at the International Student Festival in Trondheim.

State Bar of California, 496 U.S. 1 (1990), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that attorneys who are required to be members of a state bar association have a First Amendment right to refrain from subsidizing the organization‚Äôs political or ideological activities..  Introduction  Attorneys licensed to practice in California are required by law to be members of, and pay dues to, the State Bar of California. In this action, 21 California attorneys sued the State Bar, objecting to the agency's use of its members' dues to fund political and ideological activities that the members did not support. The attorneys argued that such use of their compulsory dues violated their right to freedom of speech and freedom of association, or more precisely, the freedom not to associate, under the First Amendment, as applied to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment.496 U.S. at 5-6  Facts of the case  In 1982, when the complaint in this case was filed, the State Bar of California was an active voice on political issues, both within California and nationally. The State Bar lobbied on matters pending before the legislature and before other state agencies, filed briefs in politically charged cases, and convened a Conference of Delegates to adopt resolutions taking positions on highly contentious political and ideological issues.496 U.S. at 6 n.2 The objecting attorneys challenged the use of their dues for (1) lobbying on issues such as gun control, the death penalty, special education, exclusions from gift taxes, voter approval of low-rent housing projects, and immigration; (2) filing amicus curiae briefs in cases involving the constitutionality of a victim's bill of rights, the power of a workers‚Äô compensation board to discipline attorneys, a requirement that attorney-public officials disclose names of clients, and the disqualification of a law firm; and (3) the adoption of resolutions by the State Bar's Conference of Delegates endorsing a gun control initiative, disapproving the statements of a United States senatorial candidate regarding court review of a victim‚Äôs bill of rights, endorsing a nuclear weapons freeze initiative, and opposing federal legislation limiting federal-court jurisdiction over abortions, public school prayer, and busing. The plaintiffs asked for an injunction forbidding the State bar from using mandatory dues for ideological or political purposes.  Prior history  The trial court granted summary judgment to the State Bar, ruling that, as a government agency, the Bar itself had a First Amendment right to engage in political speech.496 U.S. at 6. This ruling was reversed by the California Court of Appeal, which, in a published decision, found that the State Bar's activities were similar to those of a labor union, and its authority to use mandatory dues for political or ideological purposes was similarly constrained.Keller v. State Bar of California, 226 Cal. Rptr. 448 (Cal. App. 1986) This opinion in turn was reversed by the California Supreme Court in 1989.Keller v. State Bar of California, 47 Cal. 3d 1152, 255 Cal.Rptr. 542, 767 P.2d 1020 (1989). That court found that the State Bar functioned essentially as a government agency, and scrutinizing the Bar's activities under the First Amendment would impose an \\"extraordinary burden\\" on the organization's mission.Keller, 47 Cal. 3d at 1166. The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari in 1989.. Decision of the Court In a unanimous decision by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, the Court held that attorneys may be compelled to belong to the State Bar, but that their mandatory dues could be used only to regulate the legal profession or improve the quality of legal services available to the people of the state.496 U.S. at 13-14 Reasoning that membership in the State Bar was analogous to membership in a labor union, the Court held that the Bar would have to implement the procedures established in Chicago Teachers Union v. Hudson,. that is, the objectors were entitled to an adequate explanation of the basis for the fee, a reasonably prompt opportunity to challenge the amount of the fee before an impartial decisionmaker, and an escrow for the amounts reasonably in dispute while such challenges are pending.Keller, 496 U.S. at 16, citing Hudson, 475 U.S. at 310.  Subsequent history  The State Bar was slow to comply with the Keller, decision, resulting in a follow-up lawsuit in 1991 brought by the second-named plaintiff in Keller, Raymond L. Brosterhous, and 40 other attorneys who objected to the Bar‚Äôs continued use of their dues for political and ideological activities. This litigation eventually resulted in a court order that the Bar‚Äôs Conference of Delegates, lobbying, special activities designed to promote the careers of women and minorities, and other social and political programs could not constitutionally be funded by compulsory Bar dues.The State Bar of California Test for Chargeabilty and Summary of State Bar Activities Permitted and Prohibited under Brosterhous Analysis (Distribution authorized by the Board of Governors February 5, 2000) http://www.calbar.ca.gov/portals/0/documents/bog/minutes_00-02-05_4010_chargeabilty.pdf See also *List of United States Supreme Court cases *List of United States Supreme Court cases by the Rehnquist Court *List of United States Supreme Court cases involving the First Amendment References Further reading * . * . * . * .

During its tenure, the ADD program demonstrated through 2,377 accounts, that IDAs can be delivered effectively by a wide range of community organizations and financial institutions. The ADD initiative was evaluated by eight different research methods including implementation assessment, participant case studies, cross sectional-survey, monitoring, in- depth interviews, cost analysis, experimental impact evaluation and assessment of community effects. Individual families During the six-year ADD demonstration, 2,364 low-income individuals became accountholders. It was evaluated that those with the lowest incomes in ADD‚Äôs saved more than those who earned more, with 46% were below the poverty line and 21% at less than half of the poverty line. Incomes averaged $9,843 for a single person and $16,687 for a family of three‚Äî116% of the federal poverty level. The median annual household income was $16,296. Of those 2,346 individuals who wished to withdrawal after an average of 2 years of savings in 2002, 28% of accountholders bought homes, 23% started their own business, 23% paid for post-secondary education, 18% repaired their homes, and 7% saved for retirement. Private partners ADD developed a parallel account structure which keeps matching funds in an account accessible only to the program staff for private financial institutions which eliminated fraud and misuse of funds. Over 80% of accountholders approved of the withdrawal restrictions, and grew their IDA‚Äôs five times as large in savings than they would have in any other liquid bank account and savings they had before opening their IDA. Together, accountholders saved a total of $1,248,678‚Äîan average net savings of $19.07 a month over a span of two years. Average and total gross savings were much higher‚Äî$40 per month for a total of $2,530,538. By the end of 2001, accountholders had saved an average of $528 and the matching funds brought this up to $1,543. With the matching funds, ADD generated total savings of $3,648,149. Impact of ADD ADD‚Äôs delivery of significant data propelled federal and state governments to implement additional IDA policies. As a result, more than 20,000 IDAs have opened in more than 500 community partnerships throughout the country. Currently, a federal legislation is in the works that would reach nearly hundreds of thousands and potentially millions of accountholders.

It is part of the Church of Scotland and (along with Yester Church Saltoun Parish Church) serves the parish of Yester, Bolton and Saltoun. History and features of the church The earliest church at Bolton was erected in around 1240. It was placed under the superiority of the Canons of Holyrood Abbey in Edinburgh, and remained so for the next three hundred years. By 1804 the church had fallen into disrepair and the heritors agreed that something must be done.Louden, Revd George, Bolton Parish Church, Bolton, 1979: p2 In January 1805 the heritors met and decided that a new church should be built instead of repairing the old one, and that the new church should be capable of containing 250 people. By the end of 1809 the new church was built. In 1930 the pulpit was moved to its present position at the side of the East window, the choir was removed and other changes were made. In 1957 a central aisle was introduced and this further reduced the seating. In the church porch is a Victorian \\"graveguard\\", a contrivance designed to thwart body-snatchers who sought to steal from the graveyard newly buried corpses for sale to the medical schools in Edinburgh.Louden, Revd George, 1979: p4 The graveguard and its accessories are on display in the church porch. Buried under the church's aisles are the Lords Blantyre and the Stuarts of Eaglescairnie.Martine, John, Fourteen Parishes of the County of Haddington, Edinburgh, 1890: p39 A notable possession of Bolton Church is the Bolton Hearse, a horse-drawn vehicle believed to be the earliest surviving piece of Scottish coachwork still in existence.

It was abandoned for a few decades in the 19th century, and then was taken over by the Sisters of Mercy of St. Borromeo in 1889. History The abbey was established by the Silesian Piast Duke Henry I the Bearded and his wife Saint Hedwig of Andechs (), confirmed by Pope Innocent III. The legend of its foundation relates that once Duke Henry when out hunting fell into a swamp from which he could not extricate himself. In return for the rescue from this perilous position, he vowed to build the abbey. With Hedwig's consent, her brother Ekbert of Andechs, then Bishop of Bamberg, chose the first nuns that occupied the convent. The first abbess was Petrussa from Kitzingen Abbey; she was followed by Gertrude, the daughter of Hedwig. The abbey was richly endowed with lands by Duke Henry. When Hedwig became a widow in 1238, she went to live at Trzebnica and was buried there. Up to 1515, the abbesses were first princesses of the Piast dynasty and afterwards members of the nobility. It is said that towards the end of the thirteenth century the nuns numbered 120. The abbey also became a mausoleum of many rulers of the fragmented Silesian Piasts. In 1672 there were 32 nuns and 6 lay sisters, in 1805 there were 23 nuns and 6 lay sisters. The abbey suffered from all kinds of misfortunes both in the Middle Ages and later: from famine in 1315, 1338, 1434, and 1617, from disastrous fires in 1413, 1432, 1464, 1486, 1505, 1595, and 1782. At the Protestant Reformation, most of the nuns were Poles, as were the majority until during the eighteenth century. The abbey of Trebnitz suffered so greatly during the Thirty Years War that the nuns fled across the border on the territory of the most unaffected Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, as they did again in 1663 when the Turks threatened Silesia. In 1742, in the aftermath of the First Silesian War and the Treaty of Breslau, Trebnitz found itself under the governance of Protestant Prussia and started to suffer from political discrimination. The last abbess, Dominica von Giller, died on 17 August 1810, and on 11 November 1810, the abbey was suppressed and secularized by order of King Frederick William III. The building, which was very extensive, was sold later and turned into a cloth factory. In the late 19th century, the ruined abbey was bought by Knights Hospitaller and later by the female order of Sisters of St. Charles Borromeo as a hospital conducted by the sisters. Abbey church The church, a basilica with pillars in the late Romanesque style, to which Baroque additions were made from 1741. It features several paintings with scenes from the life of St. Hedwig by Michael Willmann. After the secularisation of the abbey, it became the Trebnitz parish church. The grave of St. Hedwig is located in a chapel to the right of the high altar, donated by her grandson Archbishop Ladislaus of Salzburg in 1267. The grave of Duke Henry I, her husband, is in front of the altar.

Industrial use  Works photograph of Chaloner, as supplied with cab to Pen-y-Bryn slate quarry, Nantlle Chaloner was supplied new to the Pen-y-Bryn slate quarry, Nantlle. Unusually for a de Winton locomotive, it was supplied with an overall cab. In 1888, it was sold to the nearby Pen-yr-Orsedd Quarry. Penyrorsedd leased the Penybryn tipping tramway in 1890, so for a while Chaloner may have continued to run on its original line. where it ran until about 1950. It was then withdrawn and stored in a locomotive shed with Kerr Stuart Diana.  Preservation  In 1960, Chaloner was purchased by Alfred Fisher, who restored it to working order.  Leighton Buzzard Light Railway  Chaloner at the Leighton Buzzard \\"steam glow\\" event in 2008 The locomotive was used to haul the opening train of the 'Iron Horse Railroad' at Leighton Buzzard in 1968. The railway later became the Leighton Buzzard Light Railway. Though in poor condition it hauled trains there for several years until replaced by more powerful locomotives needed for longer trains. It was housed at the National Railway Museum in York from 1977 until 1983. Chaloner has received a new boiler fitted at Boston Lodge Works but apart from that is composed of entirely original material, making it unique among mid-Victorian locomotives. The newest part is the water tank which originated on a locomotive called 'Victoria' and dates from 1897. It has been successively improved since preservation. In 2011 it worked a train of two slate wagons and members from Caernarfon (opposite the works where it was built) to Porthmadog on the Welsh Highland Railway a distance of twenty five miles achieving speeds over well over 20 m.p.h. on the flat. A week later it worked to Blaenau Ffestiniog and back with slate wagons. Replacement of valves of the correct size and other adjustments since then have seen further improvements to performance affecting economy. During its display in the old de Winton works in Caernarfon a works photograph was discovered showing the engine as-built with its cab. A replica cab was built and fitted, but it made conditions difficult for operating and it was removed and placed in store after two years. Chaloner remains based at Leighton Buzzard.  Visiting other railways  Chaloner was a visitor to the Ffestiniog Railway for the 150th Anniversary Celebrations in 1986. It returned in October 1986 for an overhaul at Boston Lodge, including fitting of a new boiler. Another of a number of visits was the Festival of Steam Gala, May 1997.

She has also had short stints in Ring of Honor, World League Wrestling and Women's Extreme Wrestling. She is also known as Elle Cee, where she has appeared in several adult films, such as on the bangbus.com website.  Professional wrestling career   Training  Born in Atlanta, Georgia, Harding frequently moved around up until adulthood. While living in Zephyr Hills, Florida, she became interested in professional wrestling after seeing Dusty Rhodes on Championship Wrestling from Florida. However, it was after she began regularly watching wrestling with an ex-boyfriend that she began to consider a career in professional wrestling. Hardy received much of her initial training from independent wrestlers Black Knight and Robbie Chance, however she also received training from others on the independent circuit including Mike Mondo or Mikey from WWE Spirit Squad in OVW, Mana (of the Samoan Island Tribe), Navy Seal, Pat Powers, Al Hardeman, Virgil and Dory Funk, Jr., among others. Harding later attended the IWA wrestling school.  2003‚Äì2005  She moved to St Petersburg, Florida and began managing wrestlers in Southeastern promotions. Harding began to build a solid reputation as a heel manager frequently using typical outside interference such as holding a leg down or more direct attacks including using the ring ropes to choke another wrestler, kicking him while outside the ring or using an eye gouge or neckbreaker. Among those she managed included Robbie Chance and The Heartbreak Express in Full Impact Pro. She also managed The Nighthawk in Southern Championship Wrestling and the National Wrestling Alliance. Later, as a wrestler, she also faced Luna Vachon on September 25, 2003. In October, Harding appeared in IPW Hardcore where she managed Mideon in his feud with Antonio Banks, and later Danny Doring, for almost a year before leaving to continue training. The following year, Harding managed Lexie Fyfe in her feud against Malia Hosaka and appeared on several PPV events for Woman's Extreme Wrestling. She also worked for Major League Wrestling as \\"Ring Girl\\". In mid-2004, Harding took part in the first-ever professional wrestling national tour of the People's Republic of China. Organized by NWA Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling, the tour began with its inaugural show, The Brawl at the Wall, held in Beijing near the Great Wall of China. Between August 15 to September 10, The Great Brawl of China tour visited Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Shenzhen, Hong Kong and Guangzhou. Wrestlers who appeared on the 4-week tour included former NWA World Heavyweight Champion Barry Windham, Dustin Rhodes, The Barbarian, Glacier as well as NWA MACW Junior Heavyweight Champion Rikki Nelson, Chris Hamrick, Andrue Bane and Bruiser Bradley. Female wrestlers, the first to compete in China, included Malia Hosaka, Brandy Wine, Jenny Taylor and Amber Holly. Harding and SoCal Val also made their NWA MACW debuts on the tour. In September 2004, Harding was introduced as Ms. Blue (or Ms. Blu) in Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) as the newest member of manager Kenny Bolin's stable Bolin Services in September 2004. Later that year, in Georgia Championship Wrestling, she would also make a failed attempt to defeat GCW Women's International Champion Christie Ricci on November 27, 2004. On February 25, 2005, Harding made a one-time appearance for Ring of Honor in Dayton, Ohio as a valet and manager for Jimmy Rave and The Embassy. Later, she interfered in a match between Rave and A.J. Styles causing Styles to be pinned after Harding sprayed bug spray into his eyes. Feuding with Lady Victoria in the World Wrestling Alliance in late February, Harding defeated Syren by disqualification at an event for Hoosier Pro Wrestling on March 5, and in a tag team match with Fantasia, lost to Team Blondage (Krissy Vaine and Amber O'Neal) at a show for Carolina Championship Wrestling in Lenoir, North Carolina a week later. After a near 15 minute match, Fantasia was pinned by O'Neal while Vaine helped hold her down. Returning to Hoosier Pro Wrestling, she would defeat Lady Victoria in a singles match and later in a mixed tag team match teaming with Beech to defeat Lady Victoria & Robbie Chance on April 2. In one of her last appearances on OVW television on June 4, Harding fought to a no contest with Alexis Laree after Laree and Mike Mondo became involved in an altercation in which she slapped Mondo after he had kissed her. At the Independent Association of Wrestling supercard Clash at the Cove, Harding lost to Jacqueline in a three-way match with Krystal Carmichael for the IAW Championship at Coveleski Stadium in South Bend, Indiana on June 25. Harding left OVW in August planning to take a year off from competition. On September 2, Harding appeared at the 2005 Dragon*Con against Lexie Faye at the Hyatt Regency Atlanta Hotel. The following night, Harding was eliminated by Lady Victoria in a three-way dance with Lexie Fyfe.  2006‚Äì2008  In January 2006, Harding began touring Italy appearing with Nu-Wrestling Evolution losing to Nikita on January 29, 2006.

Pikachurin is a dystroglycan-interacting protein which has an essential role in the precise interactions between the photoreceptor ribbon synapse and the bipolar dendrites. The binding with dystroglycan (DG) depends on several factors (glycosylation of DG, presence of divalent cations, presence of other proteins). A non-correct binding between pikachurin and DG is associated with muscular dystrophies that often involve eye abnormalities.  Discovery and nomenclature  Pikachurin is an extracellular matrix-like retinal protein first discovered in 2008 in Japan by Shigeru Sato et al. and named after Pikachu, a species of the Pok√©mon franchise. The name of this \\"nimble\\" protein was inspired by Pikachu's \\"lightning-fast moves and shocking electric effects\\". Pikachurin was initially identified in a microarray analysis of gene expression profiles of the retinas of wild-type and Otx2 knockout mice. A RT-PCR analysis was used to confirm that Otx2 regulates the expression of pikachurin, it was known because there was an absence of expression of pikachurin in the Otx2 mice retina, so it indicates that Otx2 regulates pikachurin. The localization of pikachurin to synaptic cleft in the photoreceptor ribbon synapse was determined using fluorescent antibodies. Tissue targeting of gene disruption of pikachurin was used to determine that this protein is necessary for proper synaptic signal transmission and visual function. Œ±-dystroglycan was shown to interact with pikachurin through immunoprecipitation.  Pikachurin-dystroglycan interaction  Dystroglycan ligand with other proteins is essential. Glycosylation of dystroglycan is necessary for its ligand binding activity. Mutations in glycosyltransferase enzymes cause abnormal glycosylation of dystroglycan. This hypoglycosylation is associated with less binding with other proteins and causes some congenital muscular dystrophy. Pikachurin is the most recently identified dystroglycan ligand protein and is localized in the synaptic cleft in the photoreceptor ribbon synapse. The binding between dystroglycan and pikachurin requires divalent cations. Ca2+ produces strongest binding; Mn2+ produces only faint bindings and no binding with Mg2+ alone. Dystroglycan has different domains that allow multiple Ca2+ sites to form a stable pikachurin- dystroglycan connection. This shows that pikachurin can form oligomeric structures; and suggests the possibility of clustering effects can be important in modulating pikachurin-dystroglycan interactions. Another thing to be considered is that the presence of NaCl (0.5M) strongly inhibits interaction between DG and other ligand proteins but has a modest inhibitory effect with pikachurin-DG ligand. This shows that there are differences between the binding of pikachurin-DG binding and DG binding with other proteins. Pikachurin seems to have more domains to bind with DG than other proteins. For example, experiments in ligand competition shows that presence of pikachurin inhibits laminin-111 binding with DG, but high concentrations of laminin-111 do not inhibit pikachurin binding to DG.  Function  Comparison between the ribbon synapses in wild-type mice (left) and pikachurin-null mice (right) The protein is colocalized with both dystrophin and dystroglycan at the ribbon synapses. Pikachurin, along with laminin, perlecan, agrin, neurexin, binds to Œ±-dystroglycan in the extracellular space. As such, pikachurin, as well as the other previously-mentioned proteins, is necessary for the proper functioning of dystroglycan. Pikachurin is necessary for the apposition of presynaptic and postsynaptic termini in the ribbon synapse; deletion of pikachurin causes an abnormal electroretinogram, similarly to the deletion of nestin.  Ribbon synapse relation  Ribbon synapse showing the position of Pikachurin Synapse formation is crucial for the mammalian CNS (central nervous system) to function correctly. Retinal photoreceptors finish at the axon terminal which forms a specialized structure, the ribbon synapse, which specifically connects photoreceptor synaptic terminals with bipolar and horizontal cell terminals in the outer plexiform layer (OPL) of the retina. It is clear that Pikachurin, an extracellular matrix‚Äìlike retinal protein, is localized to the synaptic cleft in the photoreceptor ribbon synapse. It is demonstrated that with a lack of Pikachurin, there is an improper apposition of the bipolar cell dendritic tips to the photoreceptor ribbon synapses, resulting in alterations in synaptic signal transmission and visual function. The function of Pikachurin remains unknown, but it is a fact that pikachurin is critically involved in the normal photoreceptor ribbon synapse formation and also in physiological functions of visual perception.  Associated pathologies: muscular dystrophies  Congenital muscular dystrophies (CMD) such as muscle-eye-brain disease are caused by defective glycosylation of Œ±-dystroglycan (Œ±-DG) exhibit defective photoreceptor synaptic function. Pikachurin plays an essential role in CMD. Precise interactions between the photoreceptor ribbon synapse and the bipolar dendrites which are realized due to Pikachurin may advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the retinal electrophysiological abnormalities observed in muscular dystrophy patients. The muscle-eye-brain dystrophy is caused by mutations in POMGnT1 or LARGE. These two genes mediated a post-translational modification on O-mannose, which is essential for pikachurin binding to dystroglycan, so people who suffer muscle-eye-disease have an hypoglycosylation of pikachurin- Œ±-dystroglycan interactions.  Therapeutic applications  Since pikachurin seems to provide better visual acuity, Sato et al. of the Osaka Bioscience Institute believe that the protein could be used to develop a treatment for retinitis pigmentosa and other eye disorders.

It explores the consequences of war in Laos as it follows an Australian bomb disposal specialist, training locals in the skill of detonating bombs while trying to stop villagers, particularly children, from finding them and using them for scrap metal. During the Vietnam War, Laos was the target of the heaviest US bombing campaign, making Laos the most bombed country in history: from 1964 until 1973 more than two million tonnes of bombs were dropped, including 260 million cluster munitions. An estimated 30% of the bombs dropped failed to detonate as intended. Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) continues to kill and injure people, and, as a consequence of large tracts of land (with evidence of UXOs) being sealed off, the local population are prevented from using it, including for the vital purpose of growing food. Casualties and deaths are still frequently reported, particularly amongst children and adolescents who are tempted into the restricted areas for many reasons, for example: to recapture livestock, to forage or to attempt to retrieve scrap metal, which is still a lucrative business. UXO is a key causative factor in the continuing high levels of poverty and is seen as stifling the economic and agricultural development of the country. Bomb Harvest explores how three generations of people have been left to deal with the consequences of the air war, and depicts the bravery of those trying to clear up its remnants. The film crew spent two months on the ground with bomb disposal teams from the Mines Advisory Group as they dealt with live bombs, in areas of Laos which have never been filmed in before. The film premiered at the 2007 Sydney Film Festival, and won a Children's Advocacy award at the 2008 Artivist Film Festival.

Several British motorcycle firms started up with the name \\"ABC\\", including Sopwith. The All British Engine Company Ltd. of London was founded in 1912 and later changed to ABC Motors Ltd. With chief engineer Granville Bradshaw, Charteris built a range of engines throughout the First World War. From 1913 ABC produced motorcycle engines. In 1918, ABC made a motorcycle with a 400 cc flat-twin engine mounted with its cylinders across the frame, several years before BMW adapted the design. Bradshaw challenged BMW's use of his patented design in 1926. In 1919 ABC also produced the Scootamota ‚Äì an early motor scooter. The company stopped producing motorcycles after 1923 because of competition from cheaper manufacturers. Development Preference Share of the A.B.C. Motors (1920) Ltd., issued 7.

In 1919 they jointly exhibited the Sopwith 390 cc horizontally opposed twin-cylinder overhead valve (OHV) machine at the annual Motor Cycle show. It aroused a lot of interest with innovative front and rear leaf springs and \\"expanding\\" brakes, wet sump lubrication, and a four-speed gearbox. It was also one of the first motorcycles with a duplex cradle frame. One thing it did not have, however, was any form of starting mechanism; the rider had to \\"paddle\\" or bump start to get the engine going. The ABC 400 was made under licence by the Sopwith Aviation & Engineering Co in Kingston-upon-Thames and 2,200 were produced. Later models had improved valve gear, speedometers, and electric lighting. Sidecar outfits were also produced as optional extras. In 1920 a new company, ABC Motors (1920) Ltd was formed to make aircraft engines, light cars, and motorcycles, all with a flat-twin engine designed by Bradshaw.

The Skootamota handled well and was very stable despite small wheels. The single-cylinder 123 cc engine was located above the rear wheel and drove it by chain. Early Skootamotas had exhaust over intake (EOI) engines but later versions had OHV engines. The Skootamota had external contracting band brakes on both wheels.

The transcript in this case shows that the appeal was allowed by the court, undoubtedly sitting in special term. This, we think, may be done. An appeal in a proper case is a matter of right. The decree appealed from was the decree of the supreme court, and the court, while sitting in special term, was still the supreme court, and, as such, capable of allowing an appeal to this Court from one of its final decrees, though rendered at general term. As the general term had closed, it was quite proper to apply to the court sitting in special term for the allowance of the appeal. The allowance by the court while in session at special term would not do away with the necessity of a citation because the allowance would not have been made at the same term in which the decree was rendered. Yeaton v. Lenox, 7 Pet. 221; Railroad v. Blair, 100 U. S. 662. As the allowance was made by the court, it was quite regular for the chief justice to sign the citation. The transcript also shows that the bond was approved by the court. It seems to have been presented to the court on 10 July and approved the next day. What was done was, according to the transcript, \\"In the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia.\\" Even if the citation was not served in time, which we do not decide, the failure to serve will not work a dismissal of the appeal.

The city was renamed in honor of the poet Mirza Alakbar Sabir.Gateway Azerbaijan Sabirabad is the administrative center of Sabirabad District of the Republic of Azerbaijan. In 1935, the district received the status of subordinate city. Sabirabad is located on the right bank of the Kura River. In the vicinity of the city called Sugovushan, the Araz River is merged with the Kur River.  General history  According to Gulistan Peace Treaty of October 12, 1813, part of the khanates of Azerbaijan was occupied by the Russians. Mughan territory was also captured by Russia. As a result of the administrative territorial reforms carried out in Russia, a new territory - Javad Uyezd was set up in Baku in 1868. After the merger of Russia with Russia, a large group of Ukrainian peasants was transferred to Javad, and the settlement was named Petropavlovka since 1888. Petropavlovka was part of the Javad area (gaza) of the Baku province. In 1901 there were only 87 farms in that area, and in 1907 the number of Russian villages in those areas was 13. In 1913, there was a cotton- cleaning plant, two industrial enterprises-mills were put into operation. On May 1, 1920, Petropavlovsk became the local state power body of the Revolutionary Committee of the Djevatskoye Uyezd, after Azerbaijan joined Russia again. From May 1, 1921 to April 8, 1929, Sabirabad region operated as the Petropavlovsk district of Djevatskoye Uyezd . On April 8, 1929, by the decision of the VI All-Azerbaijani Soviet Congress, it was called the Petropavlovsk district of Mugan district. On August 8, 1930, according to the Central Executive Committee's decision # 476, the district system was abolished and Petropavlovsk became an independent region. Almost a year later, on October 7, 1931, by the Decree of the Central Executive Committee of Azerbaijan, Petropavlovsk was given the name of Mirza Alakbar Sabir, the great poet of Azerbaijan, the founder of the public satire in our classical literature.History of Sabirabad district  Creation of Sabirabad city   Javad city  Ancient Javad was one of the main points on the trade route between Europe and the East. A number of European and Russian travelers and diplomats traveled to Javad, including British Anthony Jenkinson (October 6, 1561), Russians Artemy Sukhanov (1551-1552) and Fyodor Kotov (August 1623), German Adam Olearius (March 31, 1637), Dutchman Jan Jansen Struys (1671-1672), Scottish John Bell, (7 December 1716), and went to Iran, crossing over a bridge over the ships bound by chains. Some of them wrote here that the town was reminiscent of the city, they have seen many brilliant artisans who produced bricks, cane houses, mud-watered houses, gardens, carpets and various silk fabrics, and even saw weavers. Anthony Jenkinson's remarks, which were in Javad in the Safavid rule, are very interesting. He writes in his October 6, 1562, that \\"The king's yard has a beautiful palace filled with all kinds of fruits.\\" On his return from Iran in 1563, in Javad on April 6, he met with Abdulla Khan Ustajli, the Shirvan governor in his palace. She also receives a certificate from a gentleman, which permits free trade. In his memoirs A.Jenkinson, reported that the mausoleum was written in his palace in Javad, and was confirmed by the seal of the 12th year of his reign and called himself the \\"king of Shirvan and Girgan\\". Javad was a large settlement in the 17th-18th centuries. Travelers Evliya √áelebi, ƒ∞.Lerx, I.Garberq, along with other Shirvan's sights, also saw Javad's \\"fabric and manufactures\\" combined with great feudal weavers who produced silk fabrics, carpets and other things, and wrote their own thoughts. Javad has been an important point in the midst of the 19th centuries, on the sea and the dry trade routes used by the Europeans. Another line of the line called Astrakhan-Rasht road was \\"Shamakhi- Javad\\" and \\"Javad-Lankaran\\". The Javad's road also became very popular among the people. Graf Valerian Zubov was camped near Javad on November 21, 1795 when he came to Azerbaijan with the tsarist forces. In this area where the two rivers met, they wanted to set up a city named Yekaterinoserd, to deploy two thousand soldiers there, to marry them with Armenian and Georgian daughters, to provide them with land and agricultural tools. The ships coming from Astrakhan had to vacate their cargo here. They wanted to use this city as a contact point in Georgia, Ganja, Baku, Salyan, Shamakhi and trade with Iran. On March 8, 1736, Nadir Shah was convened here in the place called \\"Sugovushan\\", in Galagain, with 100,000 attendees and 20,000 delegates from them. Along with the convention, the agreement, which was discussed with the Ottoman ambassador, was approved at the congress. ≈ûahin F…ôrz…ôliyev - tarix elml…ôri doktoru, professor.

It has been a crucial point for a long time on the Kura ship. From the middle of the 19th century the \\"Baku-Salyan\\" and \\"Salyan-Astara\\" postings were opened. Meanwhile, Javad began to lose its previous significance slowly. But it remained a fishing point for a long time.  Sabirabad  The history of Sabirabad city begins since 1868. There was a traditional weekly market (Thursday) in the area between the ancient Sugovushan and Galagain villages on Kur and Araz. The first two-storey building and orthodox church is built from the bricks to create a long-awaited city of Javad this year. Orthodox Church.Sabirabad (Petropavlovka) But later, the idea of rebuilding the city was abandoned. In 1887, when Ukrainian villagers were transferred to Mughan, 26 families were settled in this settlement and the village was called Petropavlovsk. There were 87 farms here in 1901. At the end of the 19th century, the village of Petropavlovka was built in the territory of the present city. In 1887, the Ukrainians began to move here. Sabirabad (Petropavlovka) .General view. Kura river from northwest. The village began to develop in the early 20th century. On August 8, 1930 Petropavlovsk became the center of the district. On October 2, 1931 Sabirabad was renamed. In 1952, the settlement took its status as a city on December 4, 1959. Sabirabad (Petropavlovka).j ƒ∞nn.The shop of \\"Singer\\" tailor company is on the top floor. The furniture store is on the left from the floor. After the second half of the XIX century, Tsar Russia sent noble two brothers, Peter and Paul to give them instructions to cultivate cotton here. They lay the basis of a shipyard and shipyard in the present-day Sabirabad city, at the intersection of the cotton plant and the current Heydar Hamidov street and Vidadi street, behind the secondary school named after S.Vurgun on near the junction of Kura Araz, near Javad, Galagain and Kurkandi villages. At that time, the river Araz was in the vicinity of the Kura River. When Pyotr and Pavel produced cotton at the factory, they were going to take the Kura river to the Caspian Sea and then to the Volga River and Russian cities through the ships. Cotton should be harvested in nearby villages. In this way, by giving cotton seeds and other means to nearby villages, they were encouraged to plant cotton and to sign a contract for the purchase of the product. Samedov Cotton plant. Many professionals and other workers from Russia are brought here with their families to work at the plant and shipyard. Homes, including hospitals, clubs, and other public buildings are also being built in the area of the plant and port for their survival. Thus, in the territory of present Sabirabad one Russian village is formed. Despite the distortion of the facts, the logic of the Russian empire's policy is so appropriate. After the Turkmenchay treaty of 1828, the Russian Empire completed its occupation policy in the South Caucasus. The southern borders of the empire were known after agreeing with the Iranian kingdom.However, because of the lack of confidence in the protection of these borders, it was entrusted to the people who were deported from Russia and Ukraine. From the Nakhchivan to Astara, Russian villages were built along the entire border. In the territory of Sabirabad, Krasnoselsk (Kara Nuru), Pokrovka (Garatapa), Novodon (Navadan), Aleksandrovka (Shahriyar), Vladimirovka (Nizamikend), Khersonovka (Nasimikend) and other villages were built. The present Sabir canal was also drawn to the Araz River in order to grow crops and meet other water requirements in these villages. Newly populated Russian villages were also located around this canal. In order to undermine the idea of the local community, it was alleged that those who were moved here were expelled from their homeland. In fact, the climate of this place was favorable for their homeland to live. In Siberia, Tyga, and other places in Russia for the exile, it is inexhaustible. It was part of the osvivatization (to own) policy. The local population began to move here from neighboring villages and districts. After the earthquake in Shamakhi in the early twentieth century, a flow of Shamakhi people began and they constructed \\"Shamakhililar\\" neighborhood, cemetery and mosque here. Sabirabad (Petropavlovka). mosque on back. After the revolutionary movements in Iran were deposited, the Iranians immigrated here and settled here in the \\"hamshary\\" neighborhood.From western Azerbaijan, those who were deported by Stalin's orders were brought here.Meskhetian Turks also sheltered here.Thus, the population of Sabirabad was formed. After the Tsar empire was replaced by the Soviet Empire, Lenin's attitude towards Azerbaijan was different from that of the previous Tsar. It is said that, after Lenin's coming to power, he did not recognize all the Tsar's treaties apart from the Turkmenchay Treaty. Even Stalin remained loyal to this treaty, and in 1945 Soviet troops were in Tehran, but did not merge Iranian Azerbaijan into the USSR. However, the purpose of the USSR was to capture the lands of neighboring countries in the name of spreading socialism worldwide. South Belarus, Western Ukraine, Bessarabia, Pribaltika were united into the USSR but Iranian Azerbaijan was not merged. There was also a need for a factory to transform the raw cotton. The Tsar government entrusts this work to the Vagen brothers. They, in turn, invite experts from Germany to build a plant and put into operation in 1906. Sabiravad (Petropavlovka). Construction of the Bogau Cotton Mill. Each year, the Kura and Araz rivers flooded the city, causing great damage to the surrounding villages. Thus, the USSR government made a decision to establish a brigade of only two units in the country. Then, as the technique increased, auto stations and tractor repair stations were also created. There were Russian neighborhoods around these offices. These neighborhoods, the surrounding area of the bus station, were called osvoenni. Navigable Stretch of the Kura River at Petropavlovka.

Biographies  Walker was a native of Jersey City, New Jersey, and graduated from Harvard University in 1898. Leon Gillette, born in Malden, Massachusetts, had attended the University of Pennsylvania and worked in several New York firms, such as Howells & Stokes and Warren & Wetmore, and had also attended the √âcole des Beaux-Arts from 1901 through 1903. The two joined forces in 1906. Walker's wife, Sybil Kane Walker, was a decorator who worked with her husband on at least one commission. Her father was Grenville Kane, banker and longtime presence in the exclusive enclave of Tuxedo Park, New York, where Walker & Gillette received important early commissions. Her sister, Edith Brevoort Kane, married the son of George Fisher Baker. On the death of Gillette in 1945, Walker continued in business as 'Walker & Poor' with Alfred Easton Poor (the son of one of their Long Island clients). Their notable commissions include the 1950 Parke-Bernet Galleries Building in New York City. After Walker's 1952 death, that firm would eventually become known as 'Swanke Hayden Connell'.  Company history  The firm was prolific and stylistically versatile. Their commissions are not clearly attributable to one partner or the other, apart from one source identifying Gillette as solely responsible for the Grasslands Hospital in East View (Valhalla), New York, several buildings in White Plains, New York, multiple buildings in the planned city of Venice, Florida, and a housing project in Lake Charles, Louisiana.Biographical Dictionary of American Architects, Deceased, Henry F. & Elsie R. Withey, 1956 Until about 1920, most of Walker & Gillette's work amounted to two kinds of society residences: New York City townhouses, and suburban mansions. The latter as of 1915 were a step below the great Gilded Age Newport mansions of 30 years prior, but still elaborate enough to sometimes require 20 or 30 rooms, multiple outbuildings, and customized features. Their clients were bank presidents, industrialists, socialites, and railroad heirs. Connected to the community of Tuxedo Park, New York through Walker's father-in-law, the firm designed numerous residences, including the 1908 Mary E. Scofield house, \\"Sho-Chiku-Bai\\", with landscape design by Takeo Shiota, as well as several additions to existing houses. Their 16 houses on Long Island were designed for clients like Irving Brokaw, Ralph Pulitzer, Charles Lane Poor, and William R. Coe. As to the townhouses in the city, the firm is credited with some fine examples and \\"the last great mansion to be built in New York\\",New York 1930: Architecture Between the Two World Wars, Robert A.M. Stern et al. the 1932 Regency-style Loew house on East 93rd. Walker & Gillette ventured into commercial architecture in 1921 with great success. Their New York Trust Company Bank at 100 Broadway, a conservative and modest skyscraper apart from its adventuresome marble color scheme inside, began a series of about a dozen neo-classical branch banks in the New York area through the late 1920s. Their 1927 National City Bank branch on Canal Street is likely the most significant. Then came a number of major skyscrapers, notably the Industrial Trust Tower in Providence, which remains the tallest building in Rhode Island, and the Fuller Building in New York, among others. One prominent civic commission was the seamless extension, to north and south, of the New-York Historical Society building on Central Park West between 76th and 77th Streets, carried out in 1938.Central Park West Historic District, (Java), National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form, New York's State and National Registers of Historic Places Document Imaging Project , New York State Historic Preservation Office.

The ' of 1918‚Äì1922 was the dispatch of Japanese military forces to the Russian Maritime Provinces as part of a larger effort by western powers and Japan to support White Russian forces against the Bolshevik Red Army during the Russian Civil War. The Japanese suffered 1,399 killed and another 1,717 deaths from disease.Spencer, Tucker. \\"World War I: A Student Encyclopedia\\". Page 969. Background On August 23, 1914, the Empire of Japan declared war on Germany, in part due to the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, and Japan became a member of the Entente powers. The Imperial Japanese Navy made a considerable contribution to the Allied war effort; however, the Imperial Japanese Army was more sympathetic to Germany, and aside from the seizure of Tsingtao, resisted attempts to become involved in combat. The overthrow of Tsar Nicholas II and the establishment of a Bolshevik government in Russia led to a separate peace with Germany and the collapse of the Eastern Front. The spread of the anti-monarchist Bolshevik revolution eastward was of great concern to the Japanese government. Vladivostok, facing the Sea of Japan was a major port, with a massive stockpile of military stores, and a large foreign merchant community. Japanese participation The Japanese were initially asked by the French in 1917 to intervene in Russia but declined. However, in February 1918, a \\"Siberia Planning Committee\\" was formed by the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff and the Army Ministry with the aim of exploring the possibility that the Tsarist collapse was an opportunity to free Japan from any future threat from Russia by detaching Siberia and forming an independent buffer state. The Army proposed attacking on two fronts, from Vladivostok to Khabarovsk along the Amur River and also via the Chinese Eastern Railway to cut off the Russian Trans-Siberian Railway at Lake Baikal. The Japanese government, then under the civilian leadership of Prime Minister Hara Takashi rejected the plan. In late 1917, the Japanese government was alarmed to find that the British government, despite the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, had approached the United States about a possible joint intervention at Vladivostok, without consulting Japan. In December 1917, the British agreed that such a force should include Japan, but before the details could be worked out, the British ordered from Hong Kong to Vladivostok. Japanese Prime Minister Terauchi Masatake was outraged and ordered the Imperial Japanese Navy to reach Vladivostok first. The task was assigned to Rear Admiral Kat≈ç Kanji with the battleships and . With crews working day-and-night over the new year holidays, Iwami was able to depart from Kure Naval District on January 9, 1918, and arrived at Vladivostok on January 12, only two days before HMS Suffolk. Asahi arrived on January 17, and became Kat≈ç's flagship. , which had been stationed at Vladivostok until December 1917, returned on March 1. Lieut.-General Mitsue Yui and General Kikuzo Otani, the leaders of the Japanese Forces in Siberia It was the original intent that this show of force by Allied warships would enhance the confidence of the local anti-Bolshevik forces and help restore public order; however, this proved to be overly optimistic. After an armed mob looted a Japanese-owned store, killing its owner, the Japanese government, without waiting for an investigation of the murder, permitted the landing of marines, who proceeded to occupy the entire city. The British also landed 100 marines to protect their consulate, but the Americans took no action. In July 1918, President Wilson asked the Japanese government to supply 7,000 troops as part of an international coalition of 25,000 troops, including an American expeditionary force, planned to support the rescue of the Czechoslovak Legion and securing of wartime supplies stockpiled at Vladivostok. After heated debate in the Diet, the administration of Prime Minister Terauchi agreed to send 12,000 troops, but under the command of Japan, rather than as part of an international coalition. Japanese soldiers in Siberia. Once the political decision had been reached, the Imperial Japanese Army took over full control under Chief of Staff Yui Mitsue and extensive planning for the expedition was conducted. The Japanese eventually deployed 70,000 troops under the command of general Kikuzo Otani ‚Äì far more than any of the other Allied powers had anticipated. Furthermore, although the Allies had envisioned operations only in the vicinity of Vladivostok, within months Japanese forces had penetrated as far west as Lake Baikal and Buryatia, and by 1920, zaibatsu such as Mitsubishi, Mitsui and others had opened offices in Vladivostok, Khabarovsk, Nikolayevsk-on-Amur and Chita, bringing with them over 50,000 civilian settlers. After the international coalition withdrew its forces, the Japanese Army stayed on. However, political opposition prevented the Army from annexing the resource-rich region. Japan continued to support White Movement leader Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak until his defeat and capture in 1920, and also supported the regime of Ataman Semenov, who they intended to take control under the planned buffer state but whose unstable government collapsed by 1922. In March and April 1922, the Japanese Army repulsed large Bolshevik offensives against Vladivostok. On June 24, 1922, Japan announced that it would unilaterally withdraw from all of Russian territory by October, with the exception of northern Sakhalin island, which had been seized in retaliation for the Nikolayevsk incident of 1920. On January 20, 1925, the Soviet‚ÄìJapanese Basic Convention was signed in Beijing. Following this convention, Japan undertook to withdraw their troops from northern Sakhalin by May 15, 1925. Effects on Japanese politics Japan's motives in the Siberian Intervention were complex and poorly articulated. Overtly, Japan (as with the United States and the other international coalition forces) was in Siberia to safeguard stockpiled military supplies and to rescue the Czechoslovak Legion. However, the Japanese government's antipathy to communism and socialism, a determination to recoup historical losses to Russia, and the perceived opportunity to settle the \\"northern problem\\" to Japan's advantage by either creating a buffer state or through outright territorial acquisition were also factors. However, patronage of various White Movement leaders left Japan in a poor diplomatic position vis-√†-vis the government of the Soviet Union, after the Red Army eventually emerged victorious from the Russian Civil War. The intervention tore Japan's wartime unity to shreds, leading to the army and government being involved in bitter controversy and renewed faction strife in the army itself. The official conduct of the Siberian Intervention was later bitterly attacked in the Japanese Diet, with the Army being accused of grossly misrepresenting the size of the forces sent, misappropriating secret funds, and supporting figures such as lieutenant general Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, rumors of whose atrocities had reached the press. Japanese casualties from the Siberian Expedition included some 5,000 dead from combat or illness, and the expenses incurred were in excess of ¬•900 million.

Aswad claimed to receive divine inspiration in the form of words, similar to Muhammad, and is recorded to have recited them to his people. History Aswad was an apostate who had declared himself as a prophet when Muhammad became ill after his final pilgrimage to Mecca. Aswad went on to invade Najran and most of Yemen. He attacked Sana'a and Shahr who was the ruler of Yemen and the son of Badhan was killed in battle against Aswad. Aswad married Shahr's widow and declared himself ruler of Yemen. After his invasion of Yemen, he changed his title from \\"Prophet of God\\" to \\"Rahman\\" \\"The Most Merciful\\". His rule of the Yemen was short-lived. Fayruz al-Daylami, a Persian Muslim, attacked Aswad with an army and killed him.

Different specificity is marked with different colours and shapes. The arrows point from N- to C-terminus. Bi-specific T-cell engagers (BiTEs) are a class of artificial bispecific monoclonal antibodies that are investigated for the use as anti-cancer drugs. They direct a host's immune system, more specifically the T cells' cytotoxic activity, against cancer cells. BiTE is a registered trademark of Micromet AG (fully owned subsidiary of Amgen Inc). BiTEs are fusion proteins consisting of two single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) of different antibodies, or amino acid sequences from four different genes, on a single peptide chain of about 55 kilodaltons. One of the scFvs binds to T cells via the CD3 receptor, and the other to a tumor cell via a tumor specific molecule. Mechanism of action A BiTE linking a T cell to a tumor cell. Like other bispecific antibodies, and unlike ordinary monoclonal antibodies, BiTEs form a link between T cells and tumor cells. This causes T cells to exert cytotoxic activity on tumor cells by producing proteins like perforin and granzymes, independently of the presence of MHC I or co-stimulatory molecules. These proteins enter tumor cells and initiate the cell's apoptosis. This action mimics physiological processes observed during T cell attacks against tumor cells. Examples  Blinatumomab  Blinatumomab links T cells with CD19 receptors found the surface of B cells. The Food and Drug Administration (US) and the European Medicines Agency approved this therapy for adults with Philadelphia chromosome-negative relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Solitomab Solitomab links T cells with the EpCAM antigen which is expressed by colon, gastric, prostate, ovarian, lung, and pancreatic cancers. Further research Utilizing the same technology, melanoma (with MCSP specific BiTEs) and acute myeloid leukemia (with CD33 specific BiTEs) can be targeted. Research in this area is currently ongoing. Another avenue for novel anti-cancer therapies is re-engineering some of the currently used conventional antibodies like trastuzumab (targeting HER2/neu), cetuximab and panitumumab (both targeting the EGF receptor), using the BiTE approach. BiTEs against CD66e and EphA2 are being developed as well.
