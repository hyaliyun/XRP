He previously played in MLB for the Philadelphia Phillies, San Diego Padres, and Toronto Blue Jays. Galvis was born in Punto Fijo, Falc√≥n, Venezuela, and played Little League Baseball including the Little League World Series there before being discovered by one of the Phillies' scouts. At age 16, he signed a contract with the Phillies despite not receiving much attention from scouts. He spent the next several years in their minor league system, including a particularly lengthy stint with the Phillies' Double-A (AA) affiliate the Reading Phillies. He made his major league debut on Opening Day of 2012 at second base, substituting for the injured Chase Utley. He became a fan favorite for his performance early in the season, especially defensively, until he sustained an injury and subsequently was suspended for 50 games after a positive test for performance-enhancing drugs. He missed the remainder of the season. Over the course of the next two seasons, he split time between the Lehigh Valley IronPigs ‚Äì the Phillies' Triple-A affiliate ‚Äì and the major league ball club, but struggled to establish himself offensively. Beginning in 2015, Galvis spent three seasons as the Phillies' starting shortstop. In 2016, 2017, and 2018, he led National League shortstops in fielding percentage, and was twice nominated for a Gold Glove Award. In December 2017 he was traded to the San Diego Padres, becoming their starting shortstop in 2018. He spent the first five months of the 2019 season with the Toronto Blue Jays before being claimed off waivers by the Cincinnati Reds in August. Early life Galvis was born November 14, 1989, in Punto Fijo, Falc√≥n, Venezuela, and at age 14, the Philadelphia Phillies began to scout him during his days playing youth baseball. He participated on Latin America's team in the Little League World Series, but due to his slight stature ( ), struggled to captivate scouts' attention. Galvis said, \\"They told me that I couldn't play (pro) baseball. But I knew I had the ability.\\" In 2006, scouts Sal Agostinelli and Jesus Mendez signed him during the amateur player signing period. Galvis, 16 years old, was not a particularly heralded prospect, but did receive some attention from scouting experts before signing with the Phillies. Professional career =Minor league career= Galvis participated in the Florida Instructional League in 2006. The next season, he officially began affiliated baseball in 2007 with the Williamsport Crosscutters at age 17, as one of just five players not born in the United States. He made an impression with Phillies' personnel due to outstanding defensive skills that drew comparisons to those of Baseball Hall of Famer Omar Vizquel, and also demonstrated solid instincts while baserunning, despite struggling to get on base. Concurrently, he hit .203 with nine stolen bases in 38 games. In 2008, with the Lakewood BlueClaws in the South Atlantic League, Galvis hit .238 with 14 stolen bases in 127 games. He had a particularly strong May, during which he hit .313 with 14 RBIs. He also earned placement on the league's postseason all-star team. He began 2009 with the Clearwater Threshers in Class A-Advanced, and was the Phillies minor league player of the week after he hit .417 from April 20 to 26. The following May, he fractured his right ring finger, and spent more than two months on the disabled list. Thereafter, he spent seven games with the GCL Phillies before finishing the season at Double-A, where he hit just .197. Galvis returned to Reading for his 2010 season after earning an invitation to the Phillies' major league spring training. He led all shortstops in the Eastern League in fielding percentage, assists, putouts, and total chances. He was named an Eastern League all-star. After the season, he played for Navegantes del Magallanes in the Venezuelan Winter League. Entering 2011, he was \\"considered major-league-ready defensively but a major liability offensively.\\" But in 2011, at age 21, Galvis had the best season of his career to date. Always known as an excellent defender, but mediocre hitter, he was finally able to improve at the plate, thanks in part to a much more rigorous off-season conditioning regimen, and also due to hitting higher in the batting order, where he was thus challenged to make greater offensive contributions by utilizing a more aggressive approach. He also improved his arm strength to the point that at least defensively, coaches and front office personnel felt he was ready to be a major league shortstop. Starting the year in Double-A (AA) with the Reading Phillies, Galvis hit .273, with 35 RBIs, in 464 plate appearances across 104 games. In August, Galvis was promoted to the Triple-A (AAA) Lehigh Valley IronPigs, with whom he hit .321 with nine multi-hit games and 13 runs scored in his first 23 games. He hit in the leadoff spot with Lehigh Valley as well. Overall with Lehigh Valley, he hit .298, with eight RBIs in 126 plate appearances during 33 games. Between AA and AAA, he combined to hit .278 with eight home runs, 43 RBIs, 78 runs, and 23 stolen bases in 137 games. His excellent numbers were enough to earn the 2011 Paul Owens Award, which is given to the best position player and pitcher, respectively, in the Philadelphia Phillies minor league system. At the end of the 2011 season, Galvis was sent to the Venezuelan Winter League, and despite a brief ganglion cyst injury, played there until December 1. =Philadelphia Phillies (2012-2017)= Freddy Galvis runs to first base and Wally Joyner waves him to go to second base in a Phillies game on September 7, 2013 Galvis was disappointed to learn that Phillies' shortstop Jimmy Rollins had re-signed with the Phillies during offseason preceding 2012, as Galvis had hoped to replace him. He said that he allowed himself to pout for two hours, and then moved on. With Rollins re-signing with the Phillies, Galvis thought he was headed back to the minor leagues. He entered spring training as the \\"one of the most intriguing story lines\\" for the Phillies, and led the team in several statistical categories, but still presumed to open the season in AAA. However, on March 19, 2012, Phillies general manager Rub√©n Amaro, Jr. announced that Chase Utley would miss the beginning of the season due to a knee injury, and Galvis would be the opening day starter there. Galvis became the first Phillies' player to make his major league debut on opening day in 42 years when he did so on April 5. In his debut, he hit into two double plays. Galvis recorded his first major league hit in his fourth career game on April 9, a two-run double off of Miami Marlins pitcher An√≠bal S√°nchez. Four days later, he hit his first major league home run off of R.A. Dickey in a game against the New York Mets. After spending two months as the Phillies' starting second baseman, Galvis injured his back on June 8; the injury was initially thought to be a lower back strain, but eventually diagnosed as a Pars fracture in his back. He was placed on the disabled list shortly thereafter. By that time, he had \\"won the hearts of fans and earned the confidence of his manager ... with dazzling defense.\\" While on the disabled list, Galvis tested positive for having a metabolite of Clostebol (a performance-enhancing a synthetic steroid) in his system, a violation of Major League Baseball's Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program.Phillies INF Freddy Galvis suspended 50 games  Fox NewsPhillies' Freddy Galvis suspended for steroid use Galvis denied any wrongdoing, commenting, \\"I cannot understand how even this tiny particle of a banned substance got into my body. I have not and never would knowingly use anything illegal to enhance my performance.\\" He was suspended 50 games by Major League Baseball for testing positive for a banned substance.Philadelphia Phillies' Freddy Galvis suspended 50 games by MLB for positive test Phillies general manager Ruben Amaro, Jr. said \\"It's disappointing. We fully support the program and the decision. At the same time, we support the player.\\" He did not play for the remainder of the Phillies' 2012 season. There was considerable debate as to whether Galvis should open the 2013 season working on his hitting in AAA, or on the bench of the major league Phillies. Manager Charlie Manuel preferred the latter, commenting that even in 300 major league at bats splitting time between second base, shortstop, and third base, Galvis could make a greater contribution than in a season in the minor leagues. Ultimately, he did make the opening day roster, but struggled through the first third of the season, and was optioned to AAA on June 27. Correspondingly, the Phillies acquired veteran infielder John McDonald. He performed better in AAA, including a 40-game streak during which he did not commit any errors, and a leadoff home run on the Fourth of July. He returned to the major league Phillies as a September callup, and on September 7, 2013, he compiled four hits including a game-winning home run against the Atlanta Braves. Overall, 19 at second base, 14 at third base, 10 in left field, and six at shortstop comprised his 49 total major league starts. At the major league level, he hit .234 with six home runs and 19 RBIs, and in AAA, he hit .245 with three home runs and 25 RBIs. Galvis opened the 2014 season with a health scare. During spring training, Galvis contracted a methicillin- resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection (more commonly known as MRSA), ostensibly from the Phillies' clubhouse at Bright House Field in Clearwater, Florida. \\"The team's most versatile and best defensive player\\", Galvis returned to the major league club on April 11. After he struggled early in the season, the Phillies optioned him to AAA on May 9 in favor of Reid Brignac. Two days later, he broke his clavicle, and spent two months on the disabled list. After a rehabilitation assignment, he performed well at AAA, and earned a call-up to the major leagues, replacing Brignac, whom the Phillies designated for assignment. Overall, Galvis posted his worst offensive season thus far; he hit .176 at the major league level with four home runs and 12 RBIs. After the season, Michael Baumann of Crashburn Alley wrote, \\"After two years of medical and developmental setbacks, Galvis is still only entering his age-25 season, so it's possible the bat develops from bad to below-average and Galvis turns into something. I wouldn‚Äôt count on it, but it's still within the realm of possibility.\\" When the Phillies traded Rollins to the Los Angeles Dodgers prior to the 2015 season, media reports speculated that Galvis and C√©sar Hern√°ndez were the presumptive nominees to start at shortstop for the upcoming season, likely seeking to bridge the gap between Rollins and J.P. Crawford, the top prospect in the Phillies' organization. Galvis indeed became the team's starting shortstop, where he would remain for the following three seasons. He finished the 2015 season with a .263 batting average in 151 total games played. Galvis had a mixed year in the 2016 season both defensively and offensively. He led all National League shortstops in fielding percentage (.987) and was nominated for a Gold Glove Award, ultimately losing to Brandon Crawford of the San Francisco Giants. Offensively, Galvis collected 20 home runs and 67 RBIs with a .241 batting average in 158 games played. On the other hand, his .274 on base percentage was the lowest of all qualified major league batters.Major League Leaderboards ¬ª 2016 ¬ª Batters ¬ª Dashboard  FanGraphs Baseball Galvis played all 162 games in the 2017 season, including 155 games started at shortstop. On Opening Day, he hit a home run in the second inning against the Cincinnati Reds, one of 12 he would hit that season. Despite playing every game with the Phillies, Galvis slowly began to lose playing time at shortstop to top Phillies prospect J.P. Crawford following Crawford's September callup. Galvis finished with a .255 batting average and .690 OPS. He also performed well defensively, again leading National League shortstops in fielding percentage and being nominated for a Gold Glove Award, and again losing to the Giants' Brandon Crawford. =San Diego Padres (2018)= On December 15, 2017, Galvis was traded to the San Diego Padres for minor league pitcher Enyel De Los Santos. He opened the 2018 season as the Padres' starting shortstop, and again played in all 162 games this season. This included 157 starts at shortshop and five starts at second base, in a season in which Galvis batted .248 with 13 home runs and a .680 OPS. He also recorded the highest shortstop fielding percentage for the third consecutive season. At the end of the season, Galvis became a free agent. =Toronto Blue Jays (2019)= On January 29, 2019, Galvis signed a one-year, $4 million contract with the Toronto Blue Jays. The contract includes a club option for the 2020 season. =Cincinnati Reds (2019-present)= On August 12, 2019, Galvis was claimed off waivers by the Cincinnati Reds. Player profile Galvis is a slap hitter who, throughout his major league career, has struggled to assert himself as a competent offensive player. Generally, he seeks to drive the ball in the center of the field, and has shortened his stroke. He has very little ability as a power hitter, but he has hit several home runs in key situations throughout his career, an anomaly that confounded Baumann, who noted that Galvis's inability \\"to force his way into the lineup by this point has probably scuttled any chance Galvis has of being the Phillies‚Äô starting shortstop of the future.\\" Despite his offensive struggles, Phillies staff and media have long recognized Galvis's strong defensive skills, noting his propensity to make acrobatic and athletic plays, as well as utilize a strong throwing arm. He aspires to emulate Omar Vizquel, his role model. Sam Donellon, a columnist for The Philadelphia Inquirer, noted that \\"there are similarities between Galvis and his idol. Both were signed at 16, both are switch-hitters, both struggled to hit pitching at any level in their early minor league seasons.\\" Cognizant that he is a smaller player, Galvis has spent significant time working to improve his physical strength and conditioning in the offseasons. Personal life Galvis struggled off the field after his injury in 2012, noting that he only emerged from the covers of his bed to answer the door for takeout food, mainly Chinese food, pizza, and cheesesteaks. Since then, he has started a daily therapeutic routine aimed at preventing future injuries, to which he is apparently susceptible after his first back injury. His hobbies include relaxing at the beach and playing basketball. Galvis married his wife, Anna, in 2013, and is the father of two girls named Anastasia and Nicole.

Combat vehicles can be wheeled or tracked.  History  =Ancient= Hittite chariot (drawing of an Egyptian relief) The chariot is a type of carriage using animals (almost always horses)There were rare exceptions to the use of horses to pull chariots, for instance the lion-pulled chariot described by Plutarch in his \\"Life of Antony\\". to provide rapid motive power. Chariots were used for war as \\"battle taxis\\" and mobile archery platforms, as well as other pursuits such as hunting or racing for sport, and as a chief vehicle of many ancient peoples, when speed of travel was desired rather than how much weight could be carried. The original chariot was a fast, light, open, two-wheeled conveyance drawn by two or more horses that were hitched side by side. The car was little more than a floor with a waist-high semicircular guard in front. The chariot, driven by a charioteer, was used for ancient warfare during the bronze and the iron ages. Armor was limited to a shield. =Modern= In modern times, combat vehicles are protected by strong armour and armed with weapons, which combines operational mobility, tactical offensive, and defensive capabilities.  Design  = Automation = The Armed Robotic Vehicle variant of the MULE The automation of human tasks endeavors to reduce the required crew size with improvements in robotics. Enhancements to automation can help achieve operational effectiveness with a smaller, more economical, combat vehicle force. The automation of combat vehicles has proved to be difficult due to the time latency between the operator controlling the vehicle and the signal being received. Unlike air forces, ground forces must navigate the terrain and plan around obstacles. The rapid tactical implications of operating a weaponized vehicle in a combat environment are great. = Countermeasures = Use of titanium armor on combat vehicles is increasing. The use of titanium can lighten the vehicle's weight. Appliqu√© armor can be quickly applied to vehicles and has been utilized on the U.S. Army's M8 Armored Gun System. ;Fire suppression Contemporary combat vehicles may incorporate a fire-suppression system to mitigate damage from fire. Systems can be employed in the engine and crew compartments and portable systems may be mounted inside and outside the vehicle as well. Automatic fire suppression systems activate instantaneously upon the detection of fire and have been shown to significantly improve crew survivability. Halon fire suppression systems quickly inundate an affected fire breach with a flood of halon to extinguish leaking fuel. Halon remains necessary for crew compartment fire suppression due to space and weight constraints, and toxicity concerns. Nitrogen systems take up about twice as much space as a comparable halon unit. Germany uses this system as a replacement for its halon system. Some systems, such as Germany's previous extinguisher, have a second shot of suppressant to mitigate re-ignition or the effects of a second hit. Though not as instantaneous, portable crew-operable extinguishers are also used inside and outside the vehicle. Typically, portable extinguishers use a CO2 agent instead of the halon agents used in the past. CO2 can become lethal to vehicle occupants if it accumulates into a deadly concentration. The U.S. Army has adopted a replacement formula consisting of 50% water, 50% potassium acetate. Alternatives such as powder formulas also exist. = Crew = Hygiene upkeep is difficult when operating a combat vehicle. = Mobility = Tracked combat vehicles are suited for heavy combat and rough terrain. Wheeled combat vehicles offer improved logistical mobility and optimized speeds on smooth terrain. Silent watch is becoming an increasingly important combat vehicle application. It is a role that requires that all mission requirements be met while keeping acoustic and infrared signature levels to a minimum. For this reason, silent watch often requires the vehicle to operate without use of the main engine and sometimes even auxiliary engines. Many modern combat vehicles often have electronic equipment that cannot be supported solely with auxiliary batteries alone. Auxiliary fuel cells are a potential solution for covert operations.http://moab.eecs.wsu.edu/~pedrow/classes/ee415/Fall_2005/Refereed%20Papers/paper2_cobalt.pdf = Networking = Force trackers are not as prevalent as in the air force but are still essential components of combat vehicles. In the mid-'90s, U.S. weapon developers envisioned a sophisticated communication network where positions of enemy and friendly forces could be relayed to command vehicles and other friendly vehicles. Friendly vehicles could transmit enemy positions to friendly combat vehicles in combat range for efficient annihilation of the enemy. Logistics support could also monitor front-line combat vehicle fuel and ammunition statuses and move in to resupply depleted vehicles. = Weaponry = Combat vehicles weapons are primarily designed for engaging other vehicles at long distances and are not optimized for destroying non-traditional targets like car bombs.

The flag has been found on various internet sites since mid-2010.. It is similar to the LGBT flag, which is used as a symbol for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and anyone else in the community. The flag is used to increase visibility and recognition for the pansexual community, and to distinguish it from bisexuality. It is also used to indicate that pansexuals have sexual attractions and relationships with people of different genders and sexualities. The theory of pansexuality aims to challenge existing prejudices, which can cause judgment, ostracism, and serious disorders within society.

The French pushed back the main Russian force, but a cavalry raid on the French supply train caused Bernadotte to call off his attacks. After driving off the cavalry, Bernadotte withdrew and the town was occupied by the army of General Levin August, Count von Bennigsen. The fighting took place in and around MorƒÖg in northern Poland, which in 1807 was the East Prussian town of Mohrungen. The action was part of the War of the Fourth Coalition in the Napoleonic Wars. After demolishing the army of the Kingdom of Prussia in a whirlwind campaign in October and November 1806, Napoleon's Grande Arm√©e seized Warsaw. After two bitterly fought actions against the Russian army, the French emperor decided to place his troops into winter quarters. However, in wintry weather, the Russian commander moved north into East Prussia and then struck west at Napoleon's left flank. As one of Bennigsen's columns advanced west it encountered forces under Bernadotte. The Russian advance was nearly at an end as Napoleon gathered strength for a powerful counterstroke. Background After the Battle of Czarnowo on 23 December 1806 and the bloody battles of Pu≈Çtusk and Go≈Çymin on 26 December, the opposing Russian and French armies went into winter quarters.Smith, Digby. The Napoleonic Wars Data Book. London: Greenhill, 1998. . pp. 235‚Äì236 Emperor Napoleon wanted time to reorganize the Grande Arm√©e's logistical arrangements after their long autumn campaign. In addition, his veteran French troops had expressed displeasure at having to fight in Poland during the harsh winter weather.Petre, F. Loraine. Napoleon's Campaign in Poland 1806‚Äì1807. London: Lionel Leventhal Ltd., 1976 (1907). p. 117 In late 1806, Field Marshal Mikhail Kamensky's Russian army in Poland constituted two major wings under Generals Bennigsen and Friedrich Wilhelm von Buxhoeveden (Buxh√∂wden). Bennigsen commanded Lieutenant General Alexander Ivanovich Ostermann-Tolstoy's 2nd Division, Lieutenant General Fabian Gottlieb von Osten-Sacken's 3rd Division, Lieutenant General Dmitry Golitsyn's 4th Division, and Lieutenant General Alexander Karlovich Sedmoratsky's 6th Division. The initial strength of Bennigsen's force, before the December battles, was 49,000 infantry, 11,000 regular cavalry, 4,000 cossacks, 2,700 artillerymen, 900 pioneers, and 276 guns. Of these, from 55,000 to 60,000 were able to take the field.Petre, pp. 38‚Äì39 Buxh√∂wden led Lieutenant General Nikolay Tuchkov's 5th Division, Lieutenant General Dmitry Dokhturov's 7th Division, Lieutenant General Peter Kirillovich Essen's 8th Division, and Lieutenant General Heinrich Reinhold von Anrep's 14th Division. Buxh√∂wden's four divisions fought at the Battle of Austerlitz on 2 December 1805 and had not made up all the losses suffered at that engagement. Consequently, his troops numbered only 29,000 infantry, 7,000 cavalry, 1,200 gunners, and 216 artillery pieces in December 1806. Not counting garrisons, the Prussians could put only 6,000 men into the field in that month. Levin August Bennigsen In 1806, the Russian field army consisted of 18 divisions. Each division included six 3-battalion infantry regiments, ten squadrons of heavy cavalry, ten squadrons of light cavalry, two heavy foot artillery batteries, three light foot artillery batteries, and one horse artillery battery. Since the foot batteries contained 14 guns apiece and the horse batteries 12 guns, each Russian division nominally controlled as many as 82 field pieces. Typically, the heavy batteries were made up of eight 12-pound cannons, four heavy howitzers, and two light howitzers. The light batteries had the same establishment except that they substituted 6- for 12-pound cannons. Horse batteries were entirely formed from 6-pound cannons.Petre, p 37 \\"Old and worn out in body and mind\\",Petre, p 77 the 75-year-old Marshal KamenskyChandler, David G. The Campaigns of Napoleon. New York: Macmillan, 1966. p 519 exhibited clear signs that he was no longer fit to command. Around the time Pu≈Çtusk was fought, Kamensky left the front. The next day, he appeared in the streets of Grodno without his shirt on and called for a surgeon. Pointing out his many wounds, he demanded that the doctor give him a written statement that he was no longer able to serve.Petre, p 89 During December, his two lieutenants, of whom Buxh√∂wden was senior, began to intrigue against one another for the army command.Petre, pp. 70‚Äì71 After Pu≈Çtusk and Go≈Çymin, the 8th and 14th Divisions remained with Bennigsen, who was not anxious to return them to their rightful wing commander. On 1 January 1807, Bennigsen's wing lay at Nowogr√≥d on the south bank of the ice-floe choked Narew River, while Buxh√∂wden's wing was to the northeast on the north bank. Around this time, Kamensky appeared at the front but his orders were ignored and he permanently withdrew from the campaign.Petre, p 116 His unstable and violent temperament eventually led to his murder at the hands of a peasant.Petre, p 46 Napoleon deployed his corps in a wide arc on the east side of the Vistula River covering Warsaw. He posted Bernadotte's I Corps on the left flank with headquarters at Osterode (Ostr√≥da).Petre, p 118 In order from left to right came Marshal Michel Ney's VI Corps at M≈Çawa, Marshal Nicolas Soult's IV Corps at Go≈Çymin, Marshal Louis-Nicolas Davout's III Corps at Pu≈Çtusk, and Marshal Jean Lannes at Serock. Marshal Pierre Augereau's VII Corps stood in a reserve position behind the arc at P≈Ço≈Ñsk. Marshal Joachim Murat's Reserve Cavalry took up winter quarters in districts to the rear except for General of Division Louis Michel Antoine Sahuc's 4th Dragoon Division, which reported to Bernadotte, and General of Division Antoine Lasalle's Light Cavalry Division which patrolled Soult's front.Petre, pp. 119‚Äì120 Russian offensive Battle of Eylau Campaign Map, Jan.-Feb. 1807 shows Bennigsen's winter offensive leading up to the Battle of Mohrungen on 25 January 1807. German names are used for towns in East Prussia. See text for Polish names. In a council of war on 2 January 1807, Buxh√∂wden and Bennigsen determined to take the offensive against the French. They intended to move north into East Prussia with seven divisions before turning west to attack Napoleon's left flank. The plan called for one division to remain northeast of Warsaw to distract the French. This division would soon be joined by two more that were due to arrive from Moldavia under the command of Lieutenant General Ivan Essen.Petre, p 129 Lieutenant Generals Dmitri Mikhailovich Volkonski (9th Division) and Petr Ivanovich Meller-Zakomelski (10th Division) led the two units.Mountford, Eylau The Russian leaders hoped to damage Napoleon's left wing and force the French army to fall back to the west bank of the Vistula. The positions gained would be used to launch a spring campaign that might drive the French back to the Oder River.Chandler Campaigns, p 529 Still jealous of his rival Buxh√∂wden, Bennigsen withdrew east to Tykocin with his six divisions rather than join his troops to the right wing of the army. He marched north for GoniƒÖdz where he found, to his delight, that Czar Alexander had appointed him army commander and recalled Buxh√∂wden. From there, he moved west to Biala Piska, arriving there on 14 January. Bennigsen left the 6th Division at GoniƒÖdz. Screened from Soult's cavalry screen by the Johannisburg Forest, Bennigsen's northward move into Masuria remained hidden from the French. The Prussian field force under General-Leutnant Anton Wilhelm von L'Estocq withdrew northward to Rastenburg (Kƒôtrzyn).Petre, p 130 Michel Ney Meanwhile, Ney, finding his sector devoid of food and forage, disobeyed Napoleon's orders and advanced far northward in the direction of K√∂nigsberg. On the 11th his advance guard repulsed a Prussian attack on Schippenbeil (Sƒôpopol). Three days later, Ney estimated that L'Estocq had 9,000 troops while General of Infantry Ernst von R√ºchel garrisoned K√∂nigsberg with another 4,000.Petre, pp. 130‚Äì131 Livid at Ney for his insubordination, Napoleon nevertheless began to take measures in case the Russians reacted to the VI Corps leader's advance. He alerted Augereau to concentrate the VII Corps in readiness to march. The emperor also ordered Marshal Fran√ßois Joseph Lefebvre and the X Corps to protect Thorn (Toru≈Ñ) and the lower Vistula.Petre, pp. 132‚Äì133 On 19 January, the Russians finally appeared out of the forests, driving Ney's troops from Schippenbeil. After detaching 3,000 men to link with the 6th Division, Bennigsen commanded about 63,000 troops, while L'Estocq had 13,000 in the area. On the 21st, Bennigsen's advance elements were in Heilsberg (Lidzbark Warmi≈Ñski) with L'Estocq on his right flank. The three Russian advance guards were led by Major Generals Markov, Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly, and Karl Gustav von Baggovut. Though his cavalry under General of Brigade Auguste Francois-Marie de Colbert-Chabanais was roughly handled, Ney managed to escape southward to Neidenburg (Nidzica).Petre, p 138 Having brushed aside Ney, the Russians bore down on Bernadotte's corps. On 24 January, Markov mauled a French unit at Liebstadt (Mi≈Çakowo), capturing 300 Frenchmen. Bernadotte quickly assembled General of Division Pierre Dupont's division and General of Brigade Jacques L√©onard Laplanche's dragoons at Preussisch Holland (Pas≈Çƒôk) on his left flank in the northwest. On his own initiative, Bernadotte's chief of staff General of Brigade Nicolas Joseph Maison alerted the I Corps center and right flank. Maison directed General of Division Olivier Rivaud to concentrate his division at Osterode on the right, while General of Division Jean-Baptiste Drouet gathered his troops at Saalfeld (Zalewo) in the center. Maison held General of Brigade Michel Marie Pacthod's 8th Light Infantry Regiment at Mohrungen, while calling Sahuc's other dragoon brigade from the right flank toward the center.Petre, pp. 139‚Äì140 Battle Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte At noon on 25 January, Markov approached Mohrungen with the right wing advance guard. From prisoners taken at Liebstadt, the Russian general knew that Bernadotte was concentrating at Mohrungen. In fact, the French marshal held the town with nine infantry battalions and 11 cavalry squadrons. This force comprised units of all three I Corps divisions, including the 8th Light Infantry of Rivaud's division plus elements of both Drouet's and Dupont's divisions. When Markov appeared, Bernadotte immediately advanced northward to engage his enemy. He ordered Dupont to march from Preussisch Holland to hit the Russian west flank with the bulk of his division.Petre, pp. 140‚Äì141 Markov's advance guard included the Ekaterinoslav Grenadier Regiment, the Pskov Musketeer Regiment, the 5th, 7th, and 25th J√§ger Regiments, six squadrons of the Elisabethgrad Hussar Regiment, four-foot artillery batteries, and one horse artillery battery. The Russian forces numbered anywhere from 9,000Smith, p 240. Smith names five regiments, or 15 battalions, while Petre's account states that 17 battalions were engaged. to 16,000 men. Until Dupont arrived, Bernadotte had about 9,000 troops available.Petre, p 143 Pierre Dupont Bernadotte deployed Dupont's 7-battalion 1st Division, which comprised the 9th Light, 32nd Line, and 96th Line Infantry Regiments. The 8th Light Infantry Regiment from Rivaud's 2nd Division was present, as was Drouet's 7-battalion 3rd Division, consisting of the 27th Light, 94th Line, and 95th Line Infantry Regiments. General of Division Jean Baptiste Ebl√© led four-foot and two horse artillery batteries, a total of 36 guns. General of Brigade Jacques Louis Fran√ßois Delaistre de Tilly led the corps cavalry, the 2nd and 4th Hussar and 5th Chasseurs √† Cheval Regiments. Sahuc's attached division included General of Brigade Pierre Margaron's 17th and 27th Dragoon Regiments and Laplanche's 18th and 19th Dragoon Regiments.Chandler, David G. Jena 1806: Napoleon Destroys Prussia. Westport, Conn.: Praeger Publishers, 2005. . p 34Smith, p 240 Markov sent one infantry regiment forward to the hamlet of Pfarrersfeldchen, with the Elisabethgrad Hussars out front. He placed his main line on some high ground south of Georgenthal (Jurki), with two infantry regiments in the front line and one regiment in a second line. Three battalions of j√§gers held Georgenthal while two more battalions guarded the west flank.Petre, p 141 Dmitry Golitsyn Bernadotte's cavalry attacked the Russian hussars about 1:00 PM. The hussars drove back their opponents and pursued them, but came upon the French artillery and were driven off. The French horsemen chased the Russians until, they were also stopped by enemy artillery fire. Posting four field pieces on a hill to provide fire support, Bernadotte sent one battalion of the 9th Light Infantry Regiment in a frontal assault on Pfarrersfeldchen, while the 1st battalion of the 27th Light Infantry Regiment attacked a forested area to the east. The 9th was repulsed, so Bernadotte threw in the 2nd battalion of the 27th and the 8th Light Infantry Regiment. The 94th Line Infantry Regiment and the dragoons waited in support. The 1st battalion of the 27th briefly lost its eagle before recapturing it. The attack succeeded in clearing the Russian regiment out of Pfarrersfeldchen. Markov was forced to deploy six battalions to cover his right flank against Dupont's threatening advance. Meanwhile, Bernadotte attacked in front as it began to get dark. Despite tough fighting, Dupont's flank attack began to make headway and Markov ordered a withdrawal. Around this time, General Anrep arrived and announced that cavalry reinforcements were coming. He was soon hit and carried off, fatally wounded. As they pulled back, the Russians resisted fiercely. Nevertheless, Dupont drove off the two regiments in his front and closed in on Georgenthal.Petre, p 142 Suddenly, Bernadotte heard firing in his rear at Mohrungen. He immediately called off the battle and retraced his steps toward the town. What had happened was that Russian cavalry reached the town from the east. Golitsyn, leading the cavalry of the left wing, reached the village of Alt Reichau (Boguchwa≈Çy), east of Mohrungen. Though he could not hear the battle because of an acoustical quirk, he wanted to scout the territory to the west. From Alt Reichau, he sent three squadrons of cavalry under Peter Dolgorukov, followed by six more squadrons under Peter Petrovich Pahlen, through the gap between Lake Narie (Narien) and Lake MarƒÖg (Mahrung). The Russian horsemen entered Mohrungen as night fell, capturing the few defenders and pillaging the baggage trains that they found in the town. Trying to exploit their success, Dolgorukov and Pahlen moved north where they bumped into Bernadotte's returning troops and quickly retreated. Except for a body of cavalry which the French surrounded and captured, the Russian raiders got away with 360 French prisoners, 200 liberated Russian and Prussian prisoners, and some of their loot. Silver plate from petty German states and 12,500 ducats extorted from the town of Elbing (ElblƒÖg) were supposedly found in Bernadotte's personal baggage.Petre, pp. 142‚Äì143 Results French 2nd Hussars, I Corps According to a historian Digby Smith, the French suffered losses of 696 killed and wounded, while 400 were made prisoner. The Russian killed and wounded numbered 1,100, with 300 more being captured. Russian General Anrep lost his life.Smith, pp. 239‚Äì241 He was replaced in command of the 14th Division by Lieutenant General Nikolay Kamensky,Petre, p 171 son of the former commander of the army.–ó–∞–ª–µ—Å—Å–∫–∏–π –ö.–ê. Francis Loraine Petre estimates losses as high as 2,000 on each side. Bernadotte reported losing 700 or 800 troops while inflicting 1,600 casualties on his enemies. The next day, Bernadotte retreated south to Liebem√ºhl (Mi≈Çom≈Çyn), leaving Mohrungen to be occupied by Bennigsen's troops. Markov followed up the French toward Liebem√ºhl, while Baggovut's left advance guard seized Allenstein (Olsztyn). At Mohrungen on the 28th, Bennigsen called a halt to operations so that his tired troops could rest. Bernadotte continued withdrawing to the south until he reached L√∂bau (Lubawa) where he joined General of Division Jean-Joseph Ange d'Hautpoul's 2nd Cuirassier Division. This gave him 17,000 infantry and over 5,000 cavalry.Petre, p 144 Pyotr Bagration The 4,500-man Prussian garrison of Graudenz (GrudziƒÖdz), under General of Infantry Wilhelm Ren√© de l'Homme de Courbi√®re, had been besieged by General of Division Marie Fran√ßois Rouyer and a force of Hessians.Smith, p 255 At L'Estocq's approach, Rouyer raised the siege, allowing the Prussians to restock the garrison's food supplies on 31 January.Petre, p 145 This timely intervention allowed the garrison to resist the enemy besiegers until the end of the war. A Russian advance guard under General Pyotr Bagration linked L'Estocq and Bennigsen's main force, which was centered on Mohrungen, facing south. Pleased with his success so far, and expecting Napoleon to retreat to the west bank of the Vistula, Bennigsen was in for a surprise. Far from retreating, the French emperor launched a dangerous counterattack on 1 February. Napoleon saw that Bennigsen had advanced so far west that there was an opportunity to hit the Russian army in the left flank and rear. He ordered Bernadotte to continue retreating to tempt Bennigsen to move westward into the trap. Lannes with the V Corps and General of Division Nicolas L√©onard Beker's dragoon division would keep an eye on Ivan Essen's detached force to the northeast of Warsaw. (These forces clashed in the Battle of Ostro≈Çƒôka on 16 February.) Napoleon ordered the corps of Davout, Soult, Augereau, Murat, and the Imperial Guard northward to Allenstein, while Ney covered the gap between the main body and Bernadotte.Chandler Campaigns, pp. 530‚Äì531 On 1 February, the Russian commander enjoyed a great stroke of good luck. The orders to Bernadotte were given to an officer fresh from the military academy. This hapless individual, ignorant of the area, rode straight into a band of cossacks and was unable to destroy his dispatch. Soon, Bagration came into possession of the important document, which he forwarded to his army commander. As soon as he received the news, Bennigsen ordered the army to rapidly retreat on Jonkowo. As it happened, seven other couriers also fell into the hands of the cossacks, so Bernadotte remained in total ignorance of the plan until 3 February and missed the Battle of Eylau, which occurred on 7 and 8 February.Chandler Campaigns, p 531 In the meantime, the advancing French and the retreating Prussians and Russians fought a series of clashes at Bergfried (Berkweda) on 3 February, at Waltersdorf (Wilczkowo) on 5 February, and at Hof (Dw√≥rzno) on 6 February.

It was headed by Robert E. Gard within the College of Agriculture, with a mission for developing theatre arts throughout the state. Gard worked with anyone that had an idea, to develop radio dramas, or stage performances. He worked with 4-H, seeking to develop children's theatre within the state, as well as encouraging and assisting faith groups to develop dramas based on their faith. In 1945, Gard founded the Wisconsin Idea Theatre Conference, which attempted to represent all theatre interests across the state.  History  The Wisconsin Idea Theatre began when Robert M. La Follette, Sr. and Charles Van Hise attended the University of Wisconsin. They were close friends, both influenced by the progressive ideals of economics professor John Bascom. La Follette went on to become governor, while Van Hise became President of the University. They had a mutual vision of a government \\"infused with the talent of trained professionals, guided by the expertise of our wisest scholars and answerable to an active and well-educated citizenry.\\" In order to realise this ideal, they turned the University towards educating not only its students, but encouraging and teaching residents across the state. Correspondence courses were offered, along with traveling faculty. The Governor held regular meetings with the professors of the University to keep in touch, and to encourage their progress. Van Hise's successor, President Glen Frank, had a passion for expanding the arts, and hired Dean Chris Christensen to head the College of Agriculture, hoping to encourage farmers, and their families to be more creative. Christensen then hired Aldo Leopold, a well-known conservationist, John Stuart Curry, an artist, and Robert E. Gard. It was Gard that founded the Wisconsin Idea Theatre.

There is a possibility that his parents may have been distantly related. His father was descended from Mithridates VI. His mother may have been a daughter of King Artavasdes II of Armenia of the Artaxiad Dynasty. The father of Artavasdes II was Tigranes the Great,Sandler, Ground warfare: an international encyclopedia, Volume 1, p.884 who married Cleopatra of Pontus, a daughter of Mithridates VI from his first wife, his sister, Laodice.Mayor, The Poison King: the life and legend of Mithradates, Rome‚Äôs deadliest enemy, p.p.114&138 Thus Artavasdes II was a maternal grandson to Mithridates VI and Laodice. Archelaus was the maternal uncle of Glaphyra's children: Tigranes, Alexander and her unnamed daughter. Life Little is known of Archelaus' life prior to becoming king. He was born and raised in Cappadocia and spent his later life at the harbour city of Elaiussa Sebaste. In 25 BC, the Roman Emperor Augustus gave his father extra territories to govern, among them Elaiussa Sebaste.Dueck, Strabo‚Äôs cultural geography: the making of a kolossourgia, p.205 After 25 BC, Archelaus and his family settled there, while his father developed the city, built a royal residence and a palace on the island in the harbour and renamed the city in honour of Augustus.Rigsby, Asylia: territorial inviolability in the Hellenistic world, p.464 When Archelaus' father died in 17 AD, Cappadocia became a Roman province and Armenia Minor was given to Artaxias III to be ruled as a Roman client state. The Romans mandated Archelaus to rule, as a client king, Cilicia Trachea, including its maritime possessions,Syme, Anatolica: studies in Strabo, p.162 Derbe, Laranda and all the surrounding regions up to Eastern Lycaonia, which all were territories of his father. Archelaus was also allowed to continue his rule over the small Cilician region of Cetis.Vogt, Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt: Geschichte und Kultur Roms im Spiegel der neueren Forschung, Volume 1, p.2093 Historic sources mention little on Archelaus' life and his reign as king. The main sources are surviving inscriptions from his dominion. In 36 AD, the Cappadocian tribe of the Cietae, who were subjects of Archelaus, rebelled against the monarch because of the compulsion to supply property returns and taxes in the Roman fashion. The tribe withdrew to the heights of the Taurus Mountains aided by the local natural environment, where they held out against Archelaus' troops. For Archelaus to end the rebellion, Imperial Governor of Syria, Lucius Vitellius the Elder, sent four thousand legionaries from the Syrian army, who were commanded by Marcus Trebellius, along with auxiliary troops.Syme, Anatolica: studies in Strabo, p.230 When the Roman legionaries arrived at the Taurus Mountains, they constructed earthworks around two hills held by the Cietae leaders, Cadra and Davara. After the Romans had started to kill some of the tribesmen who attempted to break out, Trebellius forced the rest of the tribe to surrender. Archelaus died in 38 AD, leaving no heir to his throne. Later that year, Antiochus IV of Commagene was restored by the Roman Emperor, Caligula, to his ancestral dominion as a Roman client king and given Cilicia Trachaea.Wolfgang Haase, Hildegard Temporini, Rise and decline of the Roman world, part 2, vol. 26, Walter de Gruyter, Berlin 1995, p. 1223 Caligula also gave territories belonging to Archelaus to Antiochus to be ruled as a part of his dominion. When Antiochus and his sister-wife Iotapa became Roman client monarchs over their dominions and Iotapa bore Antiochus their first child, the couple, as a posthumous honour to Archelaus and as a mark of respect to the former king and their distant relative, named their son Gaius Julius Archelaus Antiochus Epiphanes.

Lane was later alleged to have been a member of a criminal gang known as the Gang of Innocents and sentenced to death. The execution was carried out by the Montana Vigilantes, a committee which functioned during Montana's gold rush in 1863 and 1864. Early life and journey west Lane was born in Massachusetts and suffered from a congenital deformity in his foot. He was a laborer from Massachusetts who traveled to the Western United States to find work. Lane then worked several jobs in California, Idaho, and Montana but was haunted by persistent allegations that he was a horse thief. Sometime between 1848 and 1855, during the California Gold Rush, Lane moved west. This was then a common practice among adventurous men. While in California he worked at a farm in Yuba County and later as a store clerk in Calaveras County. In 1860, Lane moved to Washington Territory following the path of gold miners. Two years later he was accused of \\"running off horses\\" in Idaho and turned himself in to the commander of Fort Lapwai. Lane was sentenced to do construction work. The next year he was accused of stealing horses again, but escaped the town before he was caught. Lane then moved to Virginia City in Montana, another common destination for gold miners. Virginia City Lane came to Virginia City in the fall of 1863, the same year that the Montana Vigilantes Committee was formed. In Virginia City, Lane became a boot maker working for Dance and Stuart's Store. His employers respected him as a hard worker. In December 1863, a member of the Innocents gang, George Ives, was subjected to a vigilante trial in Nevada City, Montana. Lane rode to Bannack, Montana in order to inform Bannack sheriff Henry Plummer of the trial. Lane's aim was to convince Plummer that he should request a civilian trial for George Ives. After he learned that Plummer was absent, Lane spoke with two of Plummer's deputies. He complained to them of the common vigilantism in Virginia City. His sentiments were seen as suspicious by the deputies, who soon had Lane arrested. He was told that he was arrested because he was \\"a road agent, thief, and an accessory to numerous robberies and murders on the highway\\". He did not resist arrest, but told them that \\"If you hang me, you will hang an innocent man.\\" Though some local residents believed that Lane was innocent, the members of the Vigilantes Committee still found him guilty and sentenced him to death by hanging. Shortly before the execution, Lane appealed to his employer to confirm his innocence. Dance responded that although Lane was always honest in dealings at work, he had no knowledge of George's other activities. Dance also admitted that the evidence against Lane was rather strong. Lane asked for no more help, but he said, \\"Well, then, will you pray with me?\\" Dance agreed: \\"Willingly, George; most willingly,\\" and, according to biographer Langford, \\"suiting the action to the word, the judge dropped upon his knees, and, with George and Gallagher kneeling beside him, offered up a fervent petition in behalf of the doomed men.\\" Lane was then led out of the building to the gallows. He saw a friend of his who came to see the execution and said to him, \\"Good-bye, old fellow. I'm gone\\". Lane then took action, and witnesses reported that \\"without waiting for the box to be removed, he leaped from it, and died with hardly a struggle\\". One witness to the execution said that \\"He was perfectly cool and collected... He evidently thought no more of hanging than the ordinary man eating his breakfast.\\" Sheriff-outlaw Henry Plummer and his deputies, Buck Stinson and Ned Ray, also alleged members of the gang, were already arrested before on the morning of January 10, 1864 and summarily hanged. Burial and exhumation Lane was buried in an unmarked grave in Boot Hill cemetery along with other executed men. In 1907, some residents of Virginia City started questioning who was buried in each grave in the cemetery. A former vigilante showed questioners where exactly Lane was buried. The body was exhumed and his mummified club foot was found. For some time the club foot was kept in the courthouse, but later it was moved to the Thompson Hickman Museum in Virginia City. It has since become one of the museum's most important exhibits. The club foot was later removed from the museum by Lane's extended family. It was cremated and the ashes were spread at a ceremony on Boot Hill on June 24, 2017.

The ruins are the remains of a massive construction project begun by King Bodawpaya in 1790 which was intentionally left unfinished. The pahtodawgyi is seen as the physical manifestations of the well known eccentricities of Bodawpaya. He set up an observation post on an island off Mingun to personally supervise the construction of the temple. Incompletion Pon Daw Pagoda (·Äï·ÄØ·Ä∂·Äê·Ä±·Ä¨·Ä∫·ÄÖ·Ä±·Äê·ÄÆ) situated near Mingun Pagoda is the 15 feet completed model of Mingun Pagoda. Bodawpaya used thousands of prisoners of war from his expansionist campaigns and slaves working on the construction of the stupa. The construction was also seen as having a heavy toll over the people and the state, thus a prophecy was allegedly created, to stop the project. The approach in conveying the dissatisfaction was allegedly to utilize the King's deep superstition. The prophecy went \\"as soon as the building of the pagoda was over, the country would also be gone\\".http://myanmartravel.org/mandalay/mingun.html A variation states that king would die once the project was completed. Thus, construction was slowed to prevent the prophecy's realisation and when the king died, the project was completely halted. A model pagoda nearby (known as the Pon Daw Pagoda), typical of many large pagoda projects like the Shwedagon Pagoda and Thatbyinnyu Temple, offers a small scale of what would have been a tall temple. However, it holds the record of being the largest pile of bricks in the world. Current condition By the time the construction project was abandoned, the pagoda had attained a height of 50 metres, one third of the intended height. An earthquake on 23 March 1839 caused huge cracks to appear on the face of the remaining structure.Burma:Preservation and restoration of national monuments and artifacts at selected sites, pages 5 and 9, UNESCO, Paris, 1984. The temple serves more as an attraction than a religious site. However, a small shrine with a Buddha image still serves its purpose as a place of worship and meditation. Pondaw paya or a working model of the stupa can be seen nearby. Mingun Bell King Bodawpaya also had a gigantic bell cast to go with his huge stupa. The Mingun Bell, weighing at 90 tons, is today the second largest ringing bell in the world. The weight of the bell in Burmese measurement, is 55,555 viss or peiktha (1 viss = 1.63 kg), handed down as a mnemonic \\"Min Hpyu Hman Hman Pyaw\\", with the consonants representing the number 5 in Burmese astronomy and numerology. Accessibility Mingun can be reached by a ferry across the Irrawaddy river from Mandalay and then optionally by foot or by bullock cart from the river jetty.

The organization was formed within the framework of the UN's effort to promote Unity in diversity, and also in recognition of the UN's push for multilingualism as a means of promoting, protecting and preserving the diversity of languages and cultures globally, particularly in the paramount importance attributed to the quality of the organization's six official languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, and Spanish). The founding of Arabic Language International Council was participated in by more than 160 university rectors and presidents in a series of 41 conferences which took place in Riyadh in 14‚Äì16 April 2008. At the same time, the council is supported and encouraged by their Excellencies ministers of education in most of the Arab countries, the Secretary Generals of the Arab League, Organisation of the Islamic Conference, Muslim World League, the Arab Gulf States Cooperation Council, the Arab Maghreb Union, and the Arab Economic Unity Council. This is in addition to the support and approval of the General Directors of UNESCO, ISESCO, ALECSO, and the Arab Bureau of Education for the Gulf States. Also, strong support came from universities rectors, presidents and the secretary generals of the Arab college's associations in Arab universities including colleges and institutes of education, colleges of science, colleges of law, colleges of pharmacy, colleges of engineering, colleges of computing and information, colleges of art, colleges of medicine, colleges of dentists medicine, colleges of science and information technology, colleges of administration sciences.  Initiatives  Since its founding, the council has been very active in promoting the Arabic language. Together with UNESCO, it holds the annual International Conference for the Arabic Language, which draws experts, academics, students, policymakers, and bureaucrats. On its second year, which focused on the discussion of the survival of the Arabic language, the forum already drew thousands of participants as well as high level regional and international sponsorship. This event also serves as an opportunity to forge partnerships such as the case of a memorandum of agreement signed by the council and the ISESCO, which outlined specific measures to effectively teach the Arabic language and highlight its role in preserving the Islamic identity.

He also served as the Head of International Affairs. , Jibril was the head of one of the largest political parties in Libya, the National Forces Alliance.Chris Stephen Muslim Brotherhood fell 'below expectations' in Libyan elections The Guardian, 10 July 2012 Toward the end of the conflict, Jibril was increasingly referred to by foreign governments and in media as the interim prime minister of Libya. Jibril's government was recognized as the \\"sole legitimate representative\\" of Libya by the majority of UN states including France, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, Iran, and Qatar. Career Jibril graduated in Economics and Political Science from Cairo University in 1975, then earned a master's degree in political science in 1980 and a doctorate in political science in 1985, both from the University of Pittsburgh. Jibril led the team which drafted and formed the Unified Arab Training manual. He was also responsible for organizing and administering the first two training conferences in the Arab world in the years 1987 and 1988. He later took over the management and administration of many of the leadership training programs for senior management in Arab countries including Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, and the United Arab Emirates. From 2007 to early 2011, he served in the Gaddafi regime as head of the National Planning Council of Libya and of the National Economic Development Board of Libya (NEDB).Wikileaks ‚Äì 09TRIPOLI386, reviewed and hosted at Politiken While there, he was a prot√©g√© and close friend of Saif al- Islam Gaddafi and promoted privatization and liberalization policies.Enrico Piovesana Il possibile successore di Gheddafi, peacereporter, 24 March 2011http://46.4.48.8/cablegate/wire.php?id=09TRIPOLI386&search;=jibril%20National%20Economic%20Development%20Board =National Transitional Council= On 23 March 2011, amidst the Libyan Civil War, the National Transitional Council officially formed a transitional government and Jibril was appointed to head it. Jibril led meetings and negotiations with French President Nicolas Sarkozy, a meeting that resulted in France officially recognizing the National Transitional Council as the sole representative of the Libyan people. He also met with UK Foreign Secretary William Hague and then-U.S. Ambassador to Libya Gene Cretz, successfully persuading them to publicly back the NTC. Following his appointment as the NTC's head of government, Jibril was referred to by foreign officials as both as the interim prime minister and the chairman of the Executive Board, the title attributed to him by the NTC official website. References to Jibril as the prime minister, including by news organisations, foreign government ministries and world leaders, have increased significantly after rebels entered Tripoli in late August 2011. In his capacity as the NTC's top diplomat, Jibril was also referred to as the council's foreign minister, though this may have been a colloquial title. Qatar-based news organization Al Jazeera also called him \\"the NTC's chief of staff\\" on at least one occasion. The Executive Board was sacked en masse by decision of the NTC on 8 August over its sluggish response to the assassination of General Abdul Fatah Younis, Benghazi's top commander. Jibril was asked to form a new board subject to the council's approval. Though Jibril stayed on as the board's chairman, a spokesman for the NTC said he would be required to spend less time out of the country. On 21 August, amidst the Battle of Tripoli, Jibril gave a televised speech urging revolutionary fighters against looting, revenge killing, abusing foreign nationals, and mistreating prisoners of war. He also called for unity and asked that police and army units in Tripoli disavow Gaddafi but remain at their posts. Jibril declared, \\"Today, all Libya's people are allowed to participate in the building of the future to build institutions with the aid of a constitution that does not differentiate between a man and a woman, sects or ethnicities. Libya is for everyone and will now be for everyone. Libya has the right to create an example that will be followed in the Arab region.\\" In September, Jibril \\"proposed 36 names for a new cabinet, including friends and relatives, and retained the prime minister and foreign minister slots for himself.\\" He later retracted the proposal when NTC members objected, but an anonymous council official said it had \\"left a bitter taste\\". Resignation On 3 October 2011, Jibril announced that he would resign from government once the country had been \\"liberated\\". He later specified this meant the capture of Sirte from loyalist holdouts. On 20 October 2011, Sirte was captured and Muammar Gaddafi was killed. Keeping his promise to leave at the war's end, Jibril resigned three days later. He was succeeded by Abdurrahim El-Keib on 31 October. =In the National Forces Alliance= In 2012, Jibril became a member of the newly founded political union, the National Forces Alliance. On 14 March 2012, he was elected leader of the alliance. Jibril represented his party in the General National Congress election. In the national elections of 7 September 2012, Jibril described his party as a supporter of democracy and also as an advocate of Sharia. The NFA won the largest number of seats in these elections. At the time, Jibril ran for a second term as prime minister. Jibril won the first round of voting, with 86 votes, significantly more than the 55 votes obtained by his primary opponent, Mustafa Abushagur. However, in the second round of voting, Abushagur ultimately defeated Jibril. Death Jibril suffered from cardiac arrest and was admitted to the Ganzouri Specialized Hospital in Cairo, Egypt, on 21 March 2020. Three days later, he tested positive for COVID-19. Jibril died on 5 April 2020 at the age of 67.

The movie was originally a nine- hour mini-series entitled Hanta Yo to be aired in 1980, instead aired in 1984 as a five-hour mini-series with the new name. The mini-series has been released on DVD in Germany, but no international release as yet. Plot Set in the years 1802 to 1808, the finished film focused on a young brave named Ahbleza, the son of Olepi, chief of a fictional lakota-speaking tribe, the Mahto ('Bear'). Blessed with supernatural visionary powers by the ancient Mahto seer Wanagi, Ahbleza sets about to save his people from the devastations of the future, among them the invasion of the white man. After a lengthy, truth-seeking odyssey fraught with tragedy and sacrifice, Ahbleza assumes his rightful place as spiritual leader of his tribe.

Wolper announced plans for a ten-hour adaptation of Hanta Yo, an epic historical novel by Ruth Beebe Hill. Using as her main source a full-blooded Sioux named Chunksa Yuha, Hill fashioned what amounted to a Native American version of Roots, chronicling the history of the fictional Matho (lakota: 'Bear') tribe of the Oglala Lakota Sioux. Although Hill was briefly the darling of the literary cognoscenti, her book was ultimately attacked and discredited by a veritable army of Indian historians, teachers, and activists, who accused her of distorting and falsifying truths in order to promote her own (and Yuha's) sociopolitical agenda. Suddenly, all of the Native American support that had been promised to the miniseries version of Hanta Yo evaporated. When the project finally aired on May 20 through 21, 1984, its running time (and budget) had been cut in half, and the producer was obliged to qualify the credits by noting that the teleplay was based partially on Hill's book, but mostly on \\"other sources\\". The filming location had to be changed from New Mexico to Thousand Oaks, California, so as not to offend the Indian tribes in the former state.

History A mill is first mentioned in the 11th century Doomsday Book at Stavretone. By the end of the 14th century it had become a fulling mill to meet the burgeoning demand for woollen broadcloth, with a stone weir to control flow to the water wheels. About 1800 the old mill was bought by John Jones. He demolished the old building and erected the current mill. In July 1802 the mill, called the \\"Staverton Superfine Woollen Manufactory\\" was attacked as part of a series of disputes about pay. By 1813, Staverton mill had 40 looms. In 1897, the mill was sold to the Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Co. to facilitate expansion of their condensed milk production, after which the top two stories were removed and the building became offices, a canteen and stores. The new owners replaced the water wheel with a vortex water turbine and installed equipment including copper vacuum pans, coolers, heaters and a basic filling and packing line. The 19th-century mill chimney was replaced in 1913 when the boiler house was modernised. The new chimney was built in brick by the German firm Alphons Custodis, was 172 feet high with a 6ft 6in diameter, and cost ¬£1,056 to construct. There was a cast-iron water tank built by Dortmund around the chimney, halfway up its height. The factory's output was sent by rail from Holt Junction station, some distant by road. A large covered loading bay was built at the station in 1909, which remained in use until 1934 when the factory gained a direct connection to the railway. Anglo- Swiss Condensed Milk Co. became Nestl√© in December 1935 and by 1936 local farmers were supplying more than of milk per annum to be condensed at the mill. A new manufacturing block was constructed on the site in 1935 to improve efficiency, and the top four stories of the mill building's original six were demolished. Two years later, the workforce had increased to 255. The site is labelled \\"Staverton Condenser\\" on an Ordnance Survey map published in 1958. = Later 20th century = In 1967 a new plant known as the \\"baked bean factory\\" was built on the site for Crosse & Blackwell at a cost of ¬£750,000. The milk cannery closed in 1972 and was refitted as a yoghurt manufacturing plant, dovetailing with Nestl√©'s 1978 acquisition of the Chambourcy brand. By 1980 the factory was producing 72 million pots of yoghurt per annum. Nestl√© produced cans on the site for many years, for the milk plant and later for the bean factory, which produced cans of baked beans and pasta in sauce (sold under their own label and for supermarket own-brands). The can manufacturing unit was closed on the site in 1989, as cans could be procured from Metal Box more cheaply than they could be made, and Nestl√© as a whole moved away from over a century of can-making (except for odd sizes e.g. for catering coffee and milk powder, which continued to be made at Dalston, near Carlisle). The brick chimney was a local landmark for much of the century, but was demolished in 1989 and replaced with a much taller metal stack.  Present  The Cross & Blackwell factory closed in 1995 and the site was transferred to Cereal Partners, makers of breakfast cereals. The Nestl√© desserts factory closed in 2004. In 2011 the metal chimney was removed, as it was not required by the cereal-making plant. The site is also the location of the head office of Trapeze Group UK, a supplier of software for public transport management.

When the owners and the NFL players, represented by the National Football League Players Association, could not come to a consensus on a new collective bargaining agreement, the owners locked out the players from team facilities and shut down league operations. The major issues disputed were the salary cap, players' safety and health benefits, revenue sharing and television contracts, transparency of financial information, rookie salaries, season length, and free agency guidelines. During the 18-week, 4-day period, there was no free agency and training camp, and players were restricted from seeing team doctors, entering or working out at team facilities, or communicating with coaches. The end of the lockout coincided with the formation of a new collective bargaining agreement prior to the start of the 2011 regular season. Background In 1992, the National Football League (NFL) and the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA) came to terms on a collective bargaining agreement. This agreement was renewed four times. In May 2008, the owners decided to opt out of the 1993 arrangement and play the 2010 season without a salary cap due to the 2010 season being the last year of the CBA. That last labor agreement gave players 57 percent of the league‚Äôs $8 billion in revenue, after the owners took more than $1 billion for operating and development costs of the league. A major reason the owners opted out of the CBA early was that they wanted a larger percentage of league revenue. Part of the previous CBA involved a transfer of revenues from the higher earning teams to the lowest, even though some of the higher earners also had higher costs. The players, represented as the National Football League Players Association, were very skeptical that the owners were losing money as a result of their payments to players, and believed the labor dispute was deliberately generated by some owners in order to renegotiate their own revenue sharing agreements which are attached to the CBA. The players resisted any pay cuts across the board. The major changes the owners wanted implemented in the next agreement were to significantly reduce the players' percentage of revenue, to extend the regular season from 16 to 18 games, and establish a rookie wage scale and/or rookie salary cap that would limit first-round draft pick compensation.Wilner, Barry (2011-04-13). NFL's rookie pitch: divert 300M from 1st rounders. Associated Press. Retrieved April 13, 2011.Fendrich, Howard (2011-04-04). Goodell wants HGH tests in next NFL labor deal. Associated Press. Retrieved April 4, 2011. The players wanted guaranteed a higher percentage of league wide spending and cash spend by every team per the salary cap on players, more benefits for former players, and changes made to improve health and safety including offseason and in-season training. Anticipating an owner-imposed lockout, players on every team voted unanimously in Fall 2010 to agree to renounce collective bargaining rights if a CBA extension could not be reached prior to expiration of the current CBA. Renunciation of CBA rights would expose the owners to potential antitrust lawsuits. The players would then lose the ability to collectively bargain with the owners. The league is exempt from most facets of antitrust laws as a result of Public Law 89-800, passed in the wake of the AFL‚ÄìNFL merger in 1970, thus complicating any potential lawsuit against the league. The NFL hired firms to lobby members of the U.S. Congress on their behalf, and the NFL's political action committee, \\"Gridiron PAC,\\" made several large donations to lawmakers who oversee the league in numerous capacities, as well as several other influential lawmakers. The players union also hired firms to lobby members of the U.S. Congress on their behalf, claiming that a lockout could potentially cost each NFL city $160 million in lost business, based on a study by consulting firm Edgeworth Economics. Congressmen also indicated a willingness to intervene if necessary. The NFL had negotiated contracts with TV networks to provide over $4 billion in 2011 to the NFL even if the owners shut down the league and no games were played in 2011. On March 1, 2011, judge David S. Doty ruled that the NFL had been actively strategizing for a lockout of the players for more than two years. It was determined that the purpose of the NFL's deliberate actions were to \\"advance its own interests and harm the interests of the players.\\" Lockout =Renunciation of CBA rights= Following the end of the 2010 season, the players and owners had not resolved the labor dispute. Although the CBA was set to expire on March 3, the players and the league owners agreed to extend the negotiations by one week, changing the expiration date to March 11, 2011. After a one-week extension, negotiations failed to result in a new agreement. At midnight on March 11, the CBA expired and the owners imposed a lockout. Accordingly, the NFLPA informed the league and the clubs that the players had voted to have the NFLPA renounce its bargaining rights. After the renunciation of collective bargaining rights, quarterbacks Tom Brady, Peyton Manning, and Drew Brees joined seven other NFL players and filed an antitrust suit to enjoin the lockout. =Court rulings= On April 25, 2011, U.S. District Court judge Susan Richard Nelson invalidated the lockout and ordered the league to resume operations. The league asked Nelson to stay the order while it appeals to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals; Nelson refused. The NFLPA had advised players to arrive at their teams' stadiums for work uninvited; most teams allowed players to enter the front office but refused further access. The order to resume operations without any CBA in place left the league in \\"chaos\\" because, without a CBA, there were no rules in place regarding a salary cap or floor, free agency, and similar labor-related issues. On April 29, 2011, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals granted the league a temporary stay of Nelson's ruling; the league reinstated the lockout following Day 2 of the draft. The stay was extended through at least June 3, when a full appeal was heard;Wilson, Allen (2011-05-17). Court deals blow to players . The Buffalo News. Retrieved May 17, 2011. the Eighth Circuit vacated Nelson's ruling on July 8, affirming the legitimacy of the lockout, but also suggested that Judge Nelson could impose an injunction of the lockout as it relates to players not under contract such as free agents and rookies. =Contingency plans= A provision in the CBA ensured that the 2011 NFL Draft was allowed to take place despite the lockout. In addition, there was also some cushion in the 2011 schedule just in case the labor dispute lasted into September and the planned start of the regular season. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell stated that Super Bowl XLVI could be moved a week later if needed, so that the entire season could be played in full. In addition, every contest in Week 3 had teams that shared the same bye week later in the season, which would have allowed these games to be made up on what was originally the teams' byes. Weeks 2 and 4 were set up so that there are neither any divisional rivalry games nor teams on bye in those weeks, which would have kept the season as fair as possible if those games had to be canceled. The league could also eliminate the normal off week between the conference championship games and the Super Bowl. Up to six weeks of the season could have been lost (moving week 3 games into the bye weeks, canceling weeks 2, 4, and 17, and moving weeks 1 and 5 to the end of the season while postponing the playoffs one week) while still keeping a generally fair schedule with five division games and eight non-division games. The league also had a plan for a longer lockout, which included an abbreviated eight-game season beginning in late November.Roth, Andy (2011-06-07). Report: NFL plans for short season if necessary . WGR. Retrieved June 8, 2011. Goodell had also stated that the league did not consider using replacement players. =Other litigation= On March 28, 2011, four former NFL players, including Hall of Fame defensive end Carl Eller, sued the NFL in hopes of joining current players in their antitrust fight against the league. The 44-page complaint filed in federal court in Minneapolis sought class-action status on behalf of all former players. The retirees wanted the NFL lockout lifted to ensure their pensions and health benefits remain funded. According to the lawsuit, those benefits would end if a collective bargaining agreement was not renewed by next March 11, a year after the last one expired. On July 5, 2011, a group of retired NFL players led by Carl Eller, Franco Harris, Marcus Allen and Paul Krause filed its own class-action lawsuit against both the NFL and NFLPA, stating that the renunciation of CBA rights disqualified the NFLPA from bargaining on the former NFL players' behalf.Retired NFL players file complaint. Associated Press. Retrieved July 5, 2011. End of lockout These NFL owners announced on July 21, 2011 that they had approved a settlement of the players' antitrust litigation by a 31‚Äì0‚Äì1 margin (the Oakland Raiders abstained), but the players decided not to vote on the settlement because they did not approve all of the terms outlined in the proposal. After continued negotiations, the ten players named as plaintiffs in the Brady case approved the settlement on July 25, and the agreement became effective after ratification by a majority of the players in the NFL on August 4, 2011. Although the settlement was approved on July 25, the NFL didn't officially recognize the NFLPA‚Äôs status as the players‚Äô collective bargaining representative until July 30, 2011. When NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and NFLPA Executive Director DeMaurice Smith signed the agreement, the lockout officially ended. =New CBA= ESPN writer John Clayton notes that there were five major parts of the new CBA: free agency, salary cap, rookie compensation, minimum salaries, and franchise tags. First, free agency guidelines returned to the way they were from 1993 to 2011. This means that a player needs four years of experience to become an unrestricted free agent, and three years of experience for restricted free agency. Second, the salary cap is now $120.375 million, but unlike the previous CBA, the new one initially has no per-team salary minimum. Team salary floors would not return until the 2013 season, at which time they became 89% of the cap. For the 2011 season, teams had the ability to \\"borrow\\" $3 million in future salary cap space to use on a signed player. For the years following the 2011 season, teams have the option of \\"borrowing\\" $1.5 million each for up to three players. Third, the rookie compensation was altered. There is a limit to the amount of money given to rookies, with the maximum total in 2011 being $874 million. First round picks receive four-year deals, with a fifth year option. In the second through seventh rounds, there are slotted four-year deals. Fourth, the league minimum salary for players increased by 10‚Äì12 percent, based on tenure. Fifth, a team's ability to place a franchise or transition tag on top players to retain his rights did not change. Other major concerns included health and safety of players, as well as former player benefits and pensions. The new 10-year collective bargaining agreement runs through 2021, and has an estimated value of $12‚Äì$16 billion per year. =Players' takeaways= The players won $1 billion in additional benefits for retired players, an opportunity to stay in the players' medical plan for life, increased minimum salaries, the continuation of a 16-game regular season schedule, improvements in player safety, increased injury protection, unrestricted free agency after four years, a true salary floor, and increased roster size. Some of the major player safety improvements included five fewer weeks of organized off-season practice, limited on-field practice time, limited full-contact practices, elimination of two-a-day practices in pads, and an increase in the number of days off of work.

He is currently the head coach at the University of Cincinnati. He spent most of his career at Ohio State University, first as a player and then as an assistant coach. He was interim head coach at OSU for the entire 2011 season. Playing career Fickell started his playing career at DeSales High School, where he was a two-time first team All-Ohio defensive tackle as well as a three-time state champion in wrestling. After redshirting for the Buckeyes in 1992, Fickell was a standout defensive player, making a school- record 50 consecutive starts at the nose guard position from 1993 to 1996.http://www.ohiostatebuckeyes.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=17300&ATCLID;=1059279 In his freshman year, he lined up next to Dan Wilkinson. Despite having a torn pectoral muscle, Fickell started the 1997 Rose Bowl, making two tackles in the Buckeyes victory over Arizona State.http://www.ohiostatebuckeyes.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=87743&SPID;=10408&ATCLID;=205159453&DB;_OEM_ID=17300 After graduating from Ohio State in 1997, Fickell signed as an undrafted free agent with the New Orleans Saints of the National Football League (NFL). After tearing the ACL in his knee, he spent the remainder of the season on the injured reserve list and was later released by the team. Coaching career =Akron= After a brief stint in the NFL and at Ohio State as a graduate assistant in 1999, in 2000 Fickell was hired by the University of Akron as the defensive line coach. =Ohio State= After two seasons with the Zips, he returned to Ohio State in 2002 as the special teams coordinator under second- year head coach, Jim Tressel. In 2004, Fickell took over as the linebackers coach, adding the title co-defensive coordinator to his responsibilities in 2005. In 2010, he was named Assistant Coach of the Year by the AFCA, joining a list of Buckeyes coaches to be recognized by the association that also includes Carroll Widdoes, Woody Hayes, Earle Bruce, and Jim Tressel. In 2011, Fickell was originally named to serve as interim head coach in place of Jim Tressel, who was given a five-game suspension by the NCAA due to a recruiting scandal. However, in May of that year, Tressell resigned and Fickell was given a one-year contract to serve as interim coach, only for the 2011 season. After Ohio State posted a 6‚Äì6 regular season record, Fickell was passed up for the permanent head job, and instead Ohio State hired Urban Meyer. Fickell guided the Buckeyes one last time in the 2012 Gator Bowl against Meyer's old team, the Florida Gators. After Meyer took the helm, Fickell returned to his old job as co-defensive coordinator, a job in which he served until he was named head coach at Cincinnati. =Cincinnati= On December 10, 2016, Fickell was named as the 39th head coach of the University of Cincinnati, taking the place of the resigning Tommy Tuberville. In his first season, Fickell led the Bearcats to a 4-8 record. 2018 would be a historic turnaround of the program, finishing with an 11-2 record and a victory in the Military Bowl. Fickell was named AAC Coach of the Year for the 2018 season, which was only the third 11-win season in UC history. He led the team to another 11-win season in 2019. The Bearcats reeled off nine straight wins after falling to Ohio State in the second game of the year. The team won the east division championship in the AAC for the first time, but fell two straight weeks to Memphis, in the final regular season game and in the conference championship. For the second straight year, Cincinnati won its bowl game over an Atlantic Coast Conference team, winning the Birmingham Bowl over Boston College. Before the start of the 2020 season Fickell agreed to a contract extension which would keep him at Cincinnati through the 2026 season. Fickell had previously received head coaching interest from other schools such as Michigan State, Florida State, West Virginia, Louisville, Maryland. Fickell was one of thirteen coaches named to the watchlist for the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award before the 2020 season. Personal Fickell and his wife, Amy (Goecke), who has a physical therapy degree from Ohio State, have six children -- five sons and one daughter -- including two sets of twin boys.

After graduating as a Doctor, Farooki has turned to children's fiction featuring female BAME protagonists, with The Double Detectives Medical Mystery series at Oxford University Press. The first book, The Cure for A Crime, was published in 2020. Personal life Roopa Farooki is the daughter of the late Nasir Ahmad Farooki, a Pakistani novelist and a prominent figure in Pakistani literary circles in the 1960s. Roopa's father abandoned her when she was 13, later marrying a Chinese American. Her mother, Nillufer, later had a long term relationship with an English-Iraqi of Jewish descent. Despite being of both Pakistani and Bangladeshi descent, she speaks only English because her parents were keen on assimilating into London and spoke to her in only English. Farooki cites her father as an inspiration, and has written frankly about her relationship with her father and his influence on her work in the UK national press. She has also written about her experiences of eczema, relationship counselling, and fertility treatment. Her recent novels have featured characters with Asperger's Syndrome, and Bipolar Disorder.

Farooki has four children: twin girls and two boys. Acceptance Farooki's novels have been critically well received, and she has been compared to other British female novelists, Andrea Levy, Zadie Smith and Monica Ali. In an interview with the Metro in 2010, headlined, \\"Nationality is Not The Issue\\", she said she was flattered by the comparisons, but said that a key difference was that she had made a deliberate decision not to focus on cultural clash in her novels, and to write universal stories.

It is made by treating lecithin with hydrogen peroxide and an organic acid such as acetic or lactic acid. In the process, some of the organic acid becomes peroxy acid. The peroxy acid reacts with olefins in the fatty acid side chains creating intermediate epoxides. The epoxides react further with water, organic acid, or peroxy acid, to ultimately form vicinal diols. Because the natural fatty acid olefins have (Z)-configurations, the resulting vicinal diols have anti stereochemical configurations. Fatty acids with hydroxyl groups on their hydrophobic tails are rare in nature. Compare hydroxylated lecithin to castor oil, which has 3 hydroxylated fatty acid chains in it.

In the MRMR system the stability and support are determined with the following equations: :RMR = IRS + RQD + spacing + condition ::in which: :::RMR = Laubschers Rock Mass Rating :::IRS = Intact Rock Strength :::RQD = Rock Quality Designation :::spacing = expression for the spacing of discontinuities :::condition = condition of discontinuities (parameter also dependent on groundwater presence, pressure, or quantity of groundwater inflow in the underground excavation) :MRMR = RMR * adjustment factors ::in which: :::adjustment factors = factors to compensate for: the method of excavation, orientation of discontinuities and excavation, induced stresses, and future weathering The parameters to calculate the RMR value are similar to those used in the RMR system of Bieniawski. This may be confusing, as some of the parameters in the MRMR system are modified, such as the condition parameter that includes groundwater presence and pressure in the MRMR system whereas groundwater is a separate parameter in the RMR system of Bieniawski. The number of classes for the parameters and the detail of the description of the parameters are also more extensive than in the RMR system of Bieniawski. The adjustment factors depend on future (susceptibility to) weathering, stress environment, orientation, The combination of values of RMR and MRMR determines the so-called reinforcement potential. A rock mass with a high RMR before the adjustment factors are applied has a high reinforcement potential, and can be reinforced by, for example, rock bolts, whatever the MRMR value might be after excavation. Contrariwise, rock bolts are not a suitable reinforcement for a rock mass with a low RMR (i.e. has a low reinforcement potential). Laubscher uses a graph for the spacing parameter. The parameter is dependent on a maximum of three discontinuity sets that determine the size and the form of the rock blocks. The condition parameter is determined by the discontinuity set with the most adverse influence on the stability. The concept of adjustment factors for the rock mass before and after excavation is very attractive. This allows for compensation of local variations, which may be present at the location of the rock mass observed, but might not be present at the location of the proposed excavation or vice versa. In addition, this allows for quantification of the influence of excavation and excavation induced stresses, excavation methods, and the influence of past and future weathering of the rock mass.

He was owned by Adam Telfer, and was used as a working dog to herd sheep. His style was different from that commonly seen during his era, as he worked far more quietly than the other sheepdogs of the time. This style was adopted and used by other breeders and trainers and became the most common style among Border Collies within a few generations, with his descendants becoming successful international sheepdog champions. Life and herding career In September 1893, Old Hemp was born to Adam Telfer's two dogs in West Woodburn, Northumberland. Hemp's mother, Meg, was a reticent and very strong-eyed black sheepdog; while Hemp's father, Roy, was a loose-eyed black, white, and tan sheepdog with a good natured temperament. Unlike many modern border collies, Hemp was a tri-colored dog with only a small amount of white fur on his trim. First following sheep at the age of six weeks,Halsall (1985): p. 32 Hemp grew to have a great ability to herd. He moved sheep quietly unlike the louder sheepdogs of the era and was far more mild-mannered, although sometimes worked so intensely that he physically trembled;Halsall (1985): p. 145 within a few generations his style had been adopted by almost all Border Collies, and became known as the Border Collie style. Hemp never ceased to impress his owner Adam Telfer. Telfer once said, while talking about Hemp, \\"he flashed like a meteor across the sheepdog horizon. There never was such an outstanding personality.\\"Halsall (1985): p. 31 With that, Telfer continued Hemp's legacy within his own breeding stock. Author and commentator Eric Halsall was also impressed by his skill. Halsall once said about Hemp, \\"none who saw him ever forgot him...Almost faultless in work...he was born with such knowledge of his craft that he never required training and went to his work naturally.\\" Legacy Memorial at West Woodburn, Northumberland, in northern England. Hemp is considered the foundation sire or \\"father\\" of the Border Collie breed.Halsall (1985): p. 13 The International Sheepdog society began its stud book in 1915, with Old Hemp being the ninth entry, out of around 300,000. Old Hemp's ability to herd sheep was what attracted many dog handlers. Estimates place his offspring at more than 200, due to his stud services being widely sought after. His medium-sized stature and rough coat are commonly seen in the breed today as many of his offspring continued to keep many of his original traits. While it is not known if Hemp participated in any sheepdog trials, a dog from Telfer's own breeding stock, Sweep (a grandson of Hemp), won the International Sheep Dog Society's championship twice. Adam Telfer later bred and owned another dog named Hemp, a descendant of Old Hemp. The younger Hemp won the 1924 International Farmers Championship for sheepdogs.Halsall (1985): p. 85 This was not the only victory in that competition by Old Hemp's descendants. Each of the twenty nine collies that won the championship between 1906 and 1951 were descendants from Old Hemp.Halsall (1985): p. 86 A Facebook campaign was started in 2012 to install a memorial to Telfer and Old Hemp, in Old Hemp's birthplace of West Woodburn, Northumberland, and permission has been granted by the relevant authorities. The unveiling of the memorial took place on September 8, 2015 and was attended by a large assembly of Border Collies and their respective owners.https://www.facebook.com/RecognitionForTheBorderColliesHeritage References ;Footnotes ;Bibliography * Individual animals in the United Kingdom 1893 animal births 1901 animal deaths Individual dogs ","title":"Old Hemp"},{"id":"31161203","text":"Bockfest is an annual beer festival held in Over-the-Rhine, Cincinnati, Ohio on the first full weekend of March. It is the oldest German-style bock beer festival in the United States.http://www.bockfest.com/ It drew an estimated 20,000 attendees in 2013 and 30,000 in 2014. Bockfest originated from the 1992 special release of a beer by Hudepohl Brewing Company. Hudepohl released a bock beer under the name of the Christian Moerlein Brewing Company, the largest pre-prohibition brewery in Cincinnati. Bockfest is a celebration of bock beer, Cincinnati's brewing heritage, the Over-the-Rhine neighborhood, and the coming of Spring.  Precipitation Retaliation  During the 2008 Bockfest a huge snowstorm nearly rendered the festival closed. The parade was officially called off because of the snow emergency, but many groups decided to walk the empty, snow-covered streets anyway. With beer already purchased and arrangements made, Bockfest continued despite poor attendance. Each year since that year there has been an event called the \\"Precipitation Retaliation\\". Participants gather around and burn a snowman effigy at Milton's Prospect Hill Tavern. Organizers claim responsibility for good weather in each subsequent year.  Bockfest Parade  Bockfest officially begins each year with a parade starting at Arnold's Bar and Grill in Downtown Cincinnati. The parade moves north into Over-the-Rhine and finishes at Bockfest Hall, an event center owned by the Christian Moerlein Brewing Company. The parade is led by a goat pulling a miniature keg of the Christian Moerlein Emancipator Doppelbock which is then ceremoniously tapped once it arrives at Bockfest Hall. The parade is popular for its short length and unique floats.http://www.cincinnatiusa.com/Attractions/detail.asp?AttractionID=673  Bockfest 5K  Since 2013 there has been a race called the \\"Bockfest 5K\\" that runs through Over-the-Rhine and Downtown on the Saturday morning of Bockfest. It is a part of the Christian Moerlein Beer Series of races organized by the Flying Pig Marathon in conjunction with the Hudy 14K & 7K Brewery Run and the Little Kings Mile.  Little King's Sausage Queen Competition  In addition to the various events held at Bockfest hall during the festival, each year a \\"Sausage Queen\\" is crowned. The Sausage Queen Competition is a gender-neutral competition that is meant to raise awareness for Bockfest and provide a light- hearted competition among those outgoing enough to compete. The rules are pretty simple in that contestants must love beer and sausage. Contestants participate in preliminary rounds where one finalist is announced at each participating bar in the weeks leading up to Bockfest. Each contestant then represents his or her bar in the finals. The winner is chosen through a question-and-answer round and a talent round through a panel of judges on Saturday night of Bockfest. The Sausage Queen leads the following year's Bockfest parade.http://www.wcpo.com/entertainment/citybeat/bockfest-sausgage- queen-competition-kicks-off-at-arnolds-bar  References  Beer festivals in the United States Festivals in Cincinnati Beer in Ohio Over-the-Rhine ","title":"Bockfest"},{"id":"31161229","text":"Paul Reilly may refer to: * Paul Reilly (rugby league) (born 1976), British rugby league player * Paul C.

This was followed by a time in the production of Cavalcade at Drury Lane. Smoothey joined the army at the outbreak of World War II and entertained troops as half of a double act with Len Marten. In 1942, he became a member of the official army organization Stars in Battledress. He left the service in 1946 and returned to civilian life and Variety entertainment by appearing at The Grand, Clapham Junction. During this time he used several stage names, including Don Maxwell and Chester Ladd. He completed a long tour in the production of The Old Town Hall, which was followed by Ralph Reader's The Gangs All Here. =Variety entertainment= In 1950, Smoothey joined his brother Len Lowe as half of a new act called \\"Lowe and Ladd\\". They enjoyed success in England, as well as touring in Australia and New Zealand until 1956, when Len wished to turn his own attentions to television and the team parted. From that point Smoothey used his own name appearing as a solo comedian. When singer Dickie Valentine persuaded Smoothey that Tommy Layton wished to work with him, the team of \\"Smoothey and Layton\\" was created and performed together until 1960.

On 1 October 1988 he was promoted to brigadier general and the same day took over as Chief of Staff Section IV (Planning; NATO Forces, conception of the Federal Armed Forces, coordination of the budgetary means for the military and planning of armament) within the Armed Forces Staff of the German Ministry of Defence in Bonn. Im October 1990 he was appointed major general and a commander of the F√ºhrungsakademie der Bundeswehr in Hamburg. During this times he also used to be vice president of the Clausewitz Society and member of the scientific advisory council of the German Military History Research Office (MGFA). As commander of the command and general staff college he changed the academy to a strategic and operational think tank and opened it to officers from Eastern European countries, one reason why he was awarded an honorary doctorate of the University of Budapest. In June 1993 he was promoted to lieutenant general and appointed commander of the 3rd Army Corps in Koblenz, which he also had to disband due to military reforms. In 1994 built up the German Army Forces Command in Koblenz as commanding general and made it a key element for the German military missions abroad. He formally led the German military missions in Somalia (UNOSOM), Croatia, and Bosnia and Herzegowina (IFOR, SFOR). In April 1998 he was promoted to general and appointed Commander NATO Joint Headquarters Centre (today Allied Force Command Heidelberg). He actively participated in the NATO structure reform process. From October 1999 to April 2000 he served as commander KFOR in Pristina, Kosovo and was in charge of 50,000 soldiers from 39 nations. Klaus Reinhardt retired in March 2001. Afterwards he began to work as a freelance journalist and writer as well as a lecturer for modern history and political science. Views In 1993, as the commander of the III. Corps, Reinhardt was heavily criticised by high-ranking conservative politician Alfred Dregger for banning Bundeswehr soldiers to participate in a memorial service at a German war cemetery that also held the graves of fallen Waffen-SS soldiers on Volkstrauertag. Reinhardt argued that he meant no disrespect to the young soldiers that had died for Germany but found that the ideology of the Waffen-SS was incompatible with the values of democracy.

According to Benedict Nicolson, in clothing the figure of the widow, Wright \\"has fallen back on those well-worn neo-classic draperies which served for any distressed female\\". Nicolson finds that other details, however, are more authentic: \\"the form of her head-band, the treatment of the feathers, the quilled cords and knife-sheath, and the buffalo-robe painted on the skin side show knowledge of Indian technology from at least as far west as the upper Great Lakes: this proves that Wright used authentic props\\".Nicolson, p. 148 The concept of the Noble Savage, applied to Native Americans, was all the more popular in Britain in the 1780s when Americans of European origin could be regarded as rebels.

The first three above- threshold ionization peaks are visible in the image. In atomic, molecular, and optical physics, above-threshold ionization (ATI), is a multi-photon effect where an atom is ionized with more than the energetically required number of photons. It was first observed in 1979. * The original article on the discovery Photoelectrons In the case of ATI the photoelectron peaks should appear at : E_s = (n + s) hbar omega - W, where the integer n represents the minimal number of photons absorbed, and the integer s represents the number of additional photons absorbed. W is the ionization energy, and E_s is the electron kinetic energy of the peak corresponding to s additional photons being absorbed. Structure It typically has a strong maximum at the minimal number of photons to ionize the system, with successive peaks (known as ATI peaks) separated by the photon energy and thus corresponding to higher numbers of photons being absorbed. In the non- perturbative regime the bound states are dressed with the electric field, shifting the ionization energy. If the ponderomotive energy of the field is greater than the photon energy omega , then the first peak disappears. Features from ultrashort pulses High intensity ultrashort pulse lasers can create ATI features with 20 or more peaks.

In the first verse, Bhamaha mentioned his work as Kavyalankara. The first chapter comprises 69 verses. After the invocation of Sarva, it defines kavya and describes the qualifications of a good poet. It also narrates various genres and styles of poems, which include Vaidarbhi and Gaudi. In the beginning of the second chapter, three gunas of poems, namely prasada, madhurya and ojah are discussed. It is followed by the discussion about the alankaras (figures of speech), which continues till the end of the third chapter. The fourth chapter mentions about the eleven types of doshas (blemishes) of kavya and defines first ten of these doshas with illustrations. The fifth chapter discusses the eleventh dosha and its causes. It is based on the Nyaya-Vaisheshika epistemology.

He is from a Palestinian family who migrated to Australia in the late 1960s. He initially obtained an Ijazah (licence) with Sanad (complete chain back to Muhammad) in complete and sound memorization of the Quran at Darul Uloom Al-Husainiah in Sindh, Pakistan. Sheikh Shady Alsuleiman has been recognized as one of the 500 most influential Muslims around the world alongside prominent Muslim leaders and presidents of major Muslim countries by an independent study conducted by the Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Centre.https://www.themuslim500.com/profiles/shady- alsuleiman/ Background He has travelled to the Arab world for a six years to continue his Islamic and Arabic studies at numerous Islamic institutions with many well-recognised scholars, primarily in Damascus. In Syria, he studied various Islamic subjects and modules, from Fiqh, Usool Al-Fiqh, Hadith, Mustalah al-hadith, Quranic Science and Tafseer and Arabic studies. He generally focused on and specialised in Arabic and Comparative Fiqh (Islamic Law/Jurisprudence) and received numerous Ijaza's in that field. Alsuleiman arrived back to Sydney in early 2001, where he began to be heavily active and involved with the Muslim youth and the second Muslim generation in Australia. He is the founder of one of Australia's largest youth centres known as the UMA in Sydney, and also the founder of Sydney Islamic College that delivers Islamic studies to adults. He also held the position of the secretary of the Australian National Imams Council (ANIC) from 2006 to 2015. and re-elected as the president in 2019. He operates from various mosques in Australia, and travels to numerous interstate and overseas countries in which he delivers lectures and participates in many different Islamic conferences and events around the world. Alsuleiman has been described as \\"controversial\\" by Fairfax newspaper WAtoday. However, he has also been described as \\"moderate\\" by the Sydney Morning Herald, another Fairfax newspaper. He has been verbally attacked by British extremist Abu Haleema for some of his fatwas. Alsuleiman established the organisation, United Muslims of Australia and in 2016 was elected as the president of Australian National Imams Council (ANIC). In April 2018 Alsuleiman was banned from entering the Kingdom of Denmark to stop him from spreading his views there. He was the 14th addition to list of hate preachers which are barred from entering by the Ministry of Immigration and Integration. Views =Homosexuality= In 2013, Alsuleiman spoke of the \\"evil actions\\" of homosexuality, saying, \\"Allah will send on them diseases they have never experienced before, What's the most common diseases these days, HIV, AIDS, that's so common, and there's no cure to it... These are evil actions that bring evil outcomes to our society.\\" =Women= Alsuleiman has signed a Muslim community letter condemning ‚Äúall forms of intimidation and abuse targeting women‚Äù He has said in online videos that females will be ‚Äòhung by their breasts in hell‚Äô and that adulterers should be stoned to death and pre-marital sex should be severely punished. \\"Remember that if there is an Islamic state the punishment of zina (sex outside marriage), the punishment of those who commit zina, if they have never been married before, they will be lashed 100 lashes. If they are married while they committed zina, or previously been married and divorced, and they committed zina, then their punishment is stoning to death. Alsuleiman is referring to the punishment Saudi Arabia condemns on women who have committed adultery, which is found in their Sharia Law, supposedly coming down from their Prophet Muhammad. \\" =Marriage= Alsuleiman has said that women must obey their husbands to enter paradise, with men having the right to demand sex from their wives. Controversies In February 2009, a Fairfax journalist was ejected from the Lakemba Mosque during an event, during which, Fairfax later reported that Anwar al-Awlaki spoke via phone link. The director of the mosque told Fairfax journalists that Alsuleiman was in charge of organising evening youth events at the time of the sermon. In 2014 Alsuleiman spoke at Park View Academy, a Birmingham UK secondary school claimed to be at the centre of Operation Trojan Horse. Alsuleiman told the pupils, \\"Give victory to Muslims in Afghanistan‚Ä¶ Give victory to all the Mujahideen all over the world. Oh Allah, prepare us for the jihad\\". A subsequent Department for Education, Education Funding Agency (EFA) report said that there was a breach of standards at the school which had allowed, \\"Sheikh Shady Al-Suleiman, known to extol extremist views (e.g. stoning of adulterers), to address the students\\". A newspaper report said Asuleiman had only talked about \\"time management\\". In June 2016, Alsuleiman participated in an Iftar dinner at Kirribilli House hosted by the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister said he would not have invited Alsuleiman had he known of his position regarding homosexuals. Alsuleiman Said he did not hold radical anti-gay views. Australia's Grand Mufti, Ibrahim Abu Mohamed has repudiated Malcolm Turnbull's position on this issue, saying Islam has a, \\"longstanding\\" position on homosexuality\\" which \\"no person can ever change\\". He said that any attempt to call out its teachings could lead to radicalisation.

The descendants of two isolates, K-12 and B strain, are used routinely in molecular biology as both a tool and a model organism.  Diversity  Escherichia coli is one of the most diverse bacterial species, with several pathogenic strains with different symptoms and with only 20% of the genome common to all strains. Furthermore, from the evolutionary point of view, the members of genus Shigella (dysenteriae, flexneri, boydii, sonnei) are actually E. coli strains \\"in disguise\\" (i.e. E. coli is paraphyletic to the genus).  History  In 1885, Theodor Escherich, a German pediatrician, first discovered this species in the feces of healthy individuals and called it Bacterium coli commune because it is found in the colon and early classifications of Prokaryotes placed these in a handful of genera based on their shape and motility (at that time Ernst Haeckel's classification of Bacteria in the kingdom Monera was in place). Following a revision of Bacteria it was reclassified as Bacillus coli by Migula in 1895MIGULA (W.): Bacteriaceae (Stabchenbacterien). In: A. ENGLER and K. PRANTL (eds): Die Naturlichen Pfanzenfamilien, W. Engelmann, Leipzig, Teil I, Abteilung Ia, 1895, pp. 20‚Äì30. and later reclassified as Escherichia coli.CASTELLANI (A.) and CHALMERS (A.J.): Manual of Tropical Medicine, 3rd ed., Williams Wood and Co., New York, 1919. Due to its ease of culture and fast doubling, it was used in the early microbiology experiments; however, bacteria were considered primitive and pre-cellular and received little attention before 1944, when Avery, Macleod and McCarty demonstrated that DNA was the genetic material using Salmonella typhimurium, following which Escherichia coli was used for linkage mapping studies.Lederber, J. 2004 E. coli K-12. Microbiology today 31:116 Strains Four of the many E. coli strains (K-12, B, C, and W) are thought of as model organism strains. These are classified in Risk Group 1 in biosafety guidelines. =Escherich's isolate= The first isolate of Escherich was deposited in NCTC in 1920 by the Lister Institute in London (NCTC 86). =K-12= A strain was isolated from a stool sample of a patient convalescent from diphtheria and was labelled K-12 (not an antigen) in 1922 at Stanford University. This isolate was used in 1940s by Charles E. Clifton to study nitrogen metabolism, who deposited it in ATCC (strain ATCC 10798) and lent it to Edward Tatum for his tryptophan biosynthesis experiments, despite its idiosyncrasies due to the F+ Œª+ phenotype. In the course of the passages it lost its O antigen and in 1953 was cured first of its lambda phage (strain W1485 by UV by Joshua Lederberg and colleagues) and then in 1985 of the F plasmid by acridine orange curing. Strains derived from MG1655 include DH1, parent of DH5Œ± and in turn of DH10B (rebranded as TOP10 by InvitrogenE. coli genotypes ‚Äì OpenWetWare). An alternative lineage from W1485 is that of W2637 (which contains an inversion rrnD-rrnE), which in turn resulted in W3110. Due to the lack of specific record-keeping, the \\"pedigree\\" of strains was not available and had to be inferred by consulting lab-book and records in order to set up the E. coli Genetic Stock Centre at Yale by Barbara Bachmann. The different strains have been derived through treating E. coli K-12 with agents such as nitrogen mustard, ultra-violet radiation, X-ray etc. An extensive list of Escherichia coli K-12 strain derivatives and their individual construction, genotypes, phenotypes, plasmids and phage information can be viewed at Ecoliwiki. = B strain = A second common laboratory strain is the B strain, whose history is less straightforward and the first naming of the strain as E. coli B was by Delbr√ºck and Luria in 1942 in their study of bacteriophages T1 and T7. The original E. coli B strain, known then as Bacillus coli, originated from F√©lix d'Herelle from the Institut Pasteur in Paris around 1918 who studied bacteriophages, who claimed that it originated from Collection of the Institut Pasteur,d'Herelle, F. (1926). In Le bact√©riophage et son comportement. Monographies de l'Institut Pasteur, Masson et Cie, Libraires de l'Acad√©mie de M√©decine, 120, Boulevard Saint Germain, Paris-VIe, France. but no strains of that period exist. The strain of d'Herelle was passed to Jules Bordet, Director of the Institut Pasteur du Brabant in Bruxelles and his student Andr√© Gratia. The former passed the strain to Ann Kuttner (\\"the Bact. coli obtained from Dr. Bordet\\") and in turn to Eug√®ne Wollman (B. coli Bordet), whose son deposited it in 1963 (CIP 63.70) as \\"strain BAM\\" (B American), while Andr√© Gratia passed the strain to Martha Wollstein, a researcher at Rockefeller, who refers to the strain as \\"Brussels strain of Bacillus coli\\" in 1921, who in turn passed it to Jacques Bronfenbrenner (B. coli P.C.), who passed it to Delbr√ºck and Luria. This strain gave rise to several other strains, such as REL606 and BL21. = C strain = E. coli C is morphologically distinct from other E. coli strains; it is more spherical in shape and has a distinct distribution of its nucleoid. = W strain = The W strain was isolated from the soil near Rutgers University by Selman Waksman. Role in biotechnology Because of its long history of laboratory culture and ease of manipulation, E. coli also plays an important role in modern biological engineering and industrial microbiology. The work of Stanley Norman Cohen and Herbert Boyer in E. coli, using plasmids and restriction enzymes to create recombinant DNA, became a foundation of biotechnology. Considered a very versatile host for the production of heterologous proteins, researchers can introduce genes into the microbes using plasmids, allowing for the mass production of proteins in industrial fermentation processes. Genetic systems have also been developed which allow the production of recombinant proteins using E. coli. One of the first useful applications of recombinant DNA technology was the manipulation of E. coli to produce human insulin. Modified E. coli have been used in vaccine development, bioremediation, and production of immobilised enzymes. E. coli have been used successfully to produce proteins previously thought difficult or impossible in E. coli, such as those containing multiple disulfide bonds or those requiring post-translational modification for stability or function. The cellular environment of E. coli is normally too reducing for disulphide bonds to form, proteins with disulphide bonds therefore may be secreted to its periplasmic space, however, mutants in which the reduction of both thioredoxins and glutathione is impaired also allow disulphide bonded proteins to be produced in the cytoplasm of E. coli. It has also been used to produce proteins with various post-translational modifications, including glycoproteins by using the N-linked glycosylation system of Campylobacter jejuni engineered into E. coli. Efforts are currently under way to expand this technology to produce complex glycosylations. Studies are also being performed into programming E. coli to potentially solve complicated mathematics problems such as the Hamiltonian path problem.  Model organism  E. coli is frequently used as a model organism in microbiology studies. Cultivated strains (e.g. E. coli K-12) are well-adapted to the laboratory environment, and, unlike wild type strains, have lost their ability to thrive in the intestine. Many lab strains lose their ability to form biofilms. These features protect wild type strains from antibodies and other chemical attacks, but require a large expenditure of energy and material resources. In 1946, Joshua Lederberg and Edward Tatum first described the phenomenon known as bacterial conjugation using E. coli as a model bacterium, Source: National Library of Medicine ‚Äì The Joshua Lederberg Papers and it remains a primary model to study conjugation. E. coli was an integral part of the first experiments to understand phage genetics, and early researchers, such as Seymour Benzer, used E. coli and phage T4 to understand the topography of gene structure. Prior to Benzer's research, it was not known whether the gene was a linear structure, or if it had a branching pattern. E. coli was one of the first organisms to have its genome sequenced; the complete genome of E. coli K-12 was published by Science in 1997.  Lenski's long-term evolution experiment  The long-term evolution experiments using E. coli, begun by Richard Lenski in 1988, have allowed direct observation of major evolutionary shifts in the laboratory. In this experiment, one population of E. coli unexpectedly evolved the ability to aerobically metabolize citrate. This capacity is extremely rare in E. coli. As the inability to grow aerobically is normally used as a diagnostic criterion with which to differentiate E. coli from other, closely related bacteria such as Salmonella, this innovation may mark a speciation event observed in the lab.

This depiction can be shown through various forms of media: film, television, literature. More specifically in film, the portrayal of blacks have been imaged and captured throughout history. Origin of Term \\"Imaging Blackness\\" is a term first used by Audrey T. McCluskey in her 2007 book Imaging Blackness: Race and Racial Representation in Film Poster Art. Historical Overview From the beginning of modern cinema, images of African Americans have played a primary role in the cinematic imagination of the West. These negative images have promoted a demeaning and undignified image of African Americans as a general group. However, simultaneously film has enabled African Americans to covey their creativity and originality, despite some intentions of whites to confine black humanity or use the African American race as a scapegoat. The beginning of black presence in American film, started with the concept of \\"blackface\\". Disguised by the idea of entertainment, white actors painted their faces black and accentuated their lips by covering them with bright red lipstick. Their outer appearance reflected society's curiosity of blackness. The concept of blackness was initially used to ridicule African Americans, showing white superiority to blacks, but then society became attracted to the controversial concept. Consequently, blackface became a popular fad in American culture. Ideas have developed and changed over time, but film has always had the ability to play on society's racial visions. Poster Art In the 1890s a new form of visual representation was introduced to America and international audiences. The high literacy rate at the beginning of the twentieth century caused the creation of advertising for newly animated films. The first forms of advertising were vividly colored crates or switchboards used to promote an upcoming film. Seen as a way to preview a story with visual highlights, these advertisements enticed viewers and attracted audiences to movie theatres. This concept created the modern day movie poster. The invention of the movie poster itself is attributed to a Frenchman named Jules Ch√©ret. He applied a printing process called stone lithography for the creation of his poster. As film technology progressed, evidently there became a need for more movie posters. It became a standardized process used to promote every new movie. The General Film Company standardized the size of a film poster at 27 x 41, allowing the poster to fit inside the glass casing outside of theatres. This was called the \\"one sheet\\" poster. These posters included texts and images supplied by the movie producing company. A constant dispute amongst associates in the movie producing company was whether to showcase star actors on their movie posters. The producer's objective was to sell their product, the movie, which is done by advertising. On the other hand, the stars demanded that these posters became a reflection of them and their talents. Movie studios hired illustrators to produce posters that were artistic as well as inventive, constantly trying to find ways to appeal to the biggest audience. During the pre-television era of the 1950s, poster art became the typical way of movie advertising, consisting of the desirable image of a movie star with some text or other images explaining a part of the movie history. The portrayal of African Americans on these movie posters was very different from that of whites. American posters had a cross- cultural view of images of African Americans. American posters tended to marginalize the black presence and limit romantic images between African Americans. However, foreign posters showcased African Americans and highlighted their romantic roles. Early American films were concerned with racial imagery. Some films made for black audiences by white producers exhibited extreme racial categories. The \\"hero\\" of these films was often a white male of upper class status. For instance, a poster for the Norman Studio produced film Regeneration (1923) displayed a poster that was a preview for the movie but also reflected a societal stereotype. It showed a fair-skinned woman fearing the advanced of an intimidating dark-skinned man. This implied the threat of rape, which negatively portrayed the African American man as a scary, harmful individual. Posters like these started to create general stereotypes like, all women should fear African American men. Yet, some studios created posters to rebut the negative images of African Americans. Some showed black men as hardworking, which was atypical of Hollywood's defined image of the African American male. In later decades, poster images reflected social- issues presented by \\"message films\\". \\"These included 'passing' in Los Boundaries (1949), interracial romance in Island in the Sun (1957), and Jungle Fever (1991), and the youthful experience of racial prejudice in The Learning Tree (1969)\\".McCluskey, Audrey T., [\\"Imaging Blackness: Race and Racial Representation in Film Poster Art\\"] pg. 5 These images differed from the earlier images of the negative portrayals of African Americans. The new representation of African Americans on film posters showed social, controversial figures, which created an inquisitive, yet uncomfortable society. By the 1960s, during the Civil Rights Movement, the first African American Hollywood movie star, Sidney Poitier emerged. The inoffensive posters of his movies like, Lilies of the Field (1963), depicted him as a protector over others and harmless individual. Thereafter, society became more accepting to non-violent, optimistic images of African Americans. During Spike Lee's filmmaking career, topics such as race and sex were presented provocatively in poster art. He wanted the posters to be as racy as his films. He hired graphic artists, like Art Sims who specialized in specifically marketing black films. He created controversial posters, like the film poster of Jungle Fever, a movie about an interracial love affair. The first version of the film poster had the actresses, Wesley Snipes and Annabella Sciorra sucking each other's fingers. This image was rejected because it was seen as too sexual and was replaced by the image of the couple interlocking fingers while holding hands. Another Lee film, Bamboozled was promoted with a poster of a graphical satire. When the film released in 2000, the advertising was thought of as too offensive and was turned away by many newspapers like the New York Times. Ironically, the film itself exposes and retells the history of African American treatment and portrayal in American entertainment. \\"Film posters illustrate the artistic and thematic range of racial representation in the American film industry. They present a history that is preserved and partially documented by a clash of art and commerce. As such, these posters are imbued with a broad array of social meanings that continue to engage us\\". Action/ Crime The 1970s era began with a revolutionary representation of African Americans. Beginning with Melvin Van Peeble's film Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song (1971) where a black man fights back against racial injustice, Hollywood began showing powerful black men as heroes in action films. The Flying Ace (1926) claimed the title as the \\"greatest airline thriller ever filmed\\". It inspired many African American aviators to fly and form aviation clubs. Odds Against Tomorrow (1959) is noted as one of the last film noirs and was directed by Robert Wise. It is one of the first films to address white racism towards African Americans. Regardless, some black action films also created controversy because they were based on negative stereotypical representations of African Americans. African American actors were primarily directed by whites, therefore their character usually acted or appeared in a way in which whites viewed African Americans. Comedy Comedy has been both helpful in advancing the careers of African Americans as well as harmful by mocking their demeanor or appearance. In the American tradition of minstrelsy white men colored their faces and falsely portrayed African American culture. \\"Black people and black life was the joke\\".McCluskey, Audrey T., [\\"Imaging Blackness: Race and Racial Representation in Film Poster Art\\"] pg. 21 The white stage performers suggested their superiority over African Americans by using minstrel shows as a daily mockery to their former position in society. Even the representation of African American children as pickaninnies became the humor for white audiences. Because of the subjugation of African Americans through comic films, comedy became an extremely sensitive topic, especially for independent race films intended for black audiences. There was much confusion on how to provide a comic performance for the audience while not ridiculing the African American race. In the 1930s African American film directors produced comedy films of the same context, however. They mocked African Americans and because of this their black audiences diminished. Frustrated, race filmmakers sought to create a more complex character for African Americans and wanted to positively portray African American culture. Comedy films became the way African Americans entered into the movie industry, even though their beginning performances were degrading. Yet, some African Americans overshadowed and outperformed white actors, showing new talent on stage. The early independent black comedy films that were popular amongst African Americans told stories about black life and culture, revealing the aptitude of black comedians. In the late 1900s, black comedies thrived and became especially popular. Bill Cosby and Sidney Poitier became a comic duo in Uptown Saturday Night (1974), attracting black audiences from various areas. Richard Pryor: Live in Concert (1979) starring Richard Pryor, who became the most African American popular comedian in Hollywood, changed the industry. He set the path for other African American comedians like modern day Eddie Murphy, The Wayans Brothers, Martin Lawrence, Chris Rock, Chris Tucker, and Bernie Mac. Documentary Only recently in the late 1900s did the topic of African American life in the United States become a topic of interest to society. Documentary films gave African Americans a chance to voice their opinions about the injustices they felt. These films also showed detailed insight to African American lives that were not known to society. William Greaves became a famous filmmaker after his television documentary on the lives of African Americans in the United States, called Black Journal. His other documentaries on prominent figures like Booker T. Washington and Malcolm X show how documentaries serve as a historical source. Greaves' intention was to capture the struggles and triumphs of African Americans in a realistic technique. His view filled a void that was missing in Hollywood's representation of African Americans. He concentrated on issues specific to African American communities like gender differences, racial hierarchies, and family relationships. Documentaries were used as a powerful method to portray African Americans as complex individuals, explaining significant events in their lives. Drama The \\"separate cinema\\"The Separate Cinema Archive ‚Äî chronicles the historic journey of the Black film industry  http://www.separatecinema.com/index2.html of race films directed for black audiences used the drama genre to combat the popular, accepted view of African Americans. The Lincoln Motion Picture Company, established in 1915, was the first black film company to produce films that showed positive qualities in their illustration of African American lives.Separate Cinema ‚Äî The Vintage Years - 20 years of Race Film  http://www.separatecinema.com/exhibits_vintageyears.html African American filmmakers used dramatic works to uplift black morale, inspire African Americans and represent black life in an encouraging way. In earlier dramatic films in Hollywood, African American characters would commonly be seen as being disposable to whites. They would either have to sacrifice their lives or their families for the triumph or success of whites. The underlying message told by Hollywood was the importance and dominance of white life over the lives of African Americans. However, in the 1900s independent films like Daughters of the Dust (1991), Beloved (1998), and Bamboozled (2000) showed the history of African Americans in the United States, the challenges they faced, and the benefits they gained from overcoming racial injustice. These films exemplify how dramatic films can be used as an instrument for African Americans to envision and hope for a better and improved future. Musical \\"Several cultural critics claim that, in U.S culture, music is one of few arenas within blacks are allowed greatness. This phenomenon is clearly evident in the inception of the all-black cast musical in the Hollywood film tradition, in musicals in race films from the late 1920s and 1930s, and in contemporary culture\\".McCluskey, Audrey T., [\\"Imaging Blackness: Race and Racial Representation in Film Poster Art\\"] pg. 56 The earliest sound films, Hearts if Dixie (1929) and Hallelujah! (1929) allowed African Americans to perform and showcase their said \\"natural abilities\\" for song and dance. Rather than the earlier Hollywood musicals where whites put on a blackface, these musicals consisted of all black casts performing black roles. Hollywood studios constructed all black cast musicals designed for white audiences. Even though these films confirmed society's belief of the Negro as the bottom of the social hierarchy, musicals gave African Americans an opportunity to add to the limited role of \\"blackness\\" labeled by whites. In Hollywood musicals, African Americans were prominently used for the amusement of whites. Including all black cast musicals, Hollywood's musicals were intended for white audiences. Contrasting the \\"separate cinema\\", where race films were shown to black audiences throughout the South. These films developed a narrative that demonstrated the strengths of African American performers. These race films also provided African Americans with the opportunity to play lead roles rather than the limited Hollywood roles of servants, maids, or clowns. The existence of the musical genre in both Hollywood and race films generated a segregated society. This segregation allowed society to witness the discrepancies between both sources of entertainment, Hollywood and independent race filmmakers. Mystery/ Thriller \\"Mystery/ Thriller films allowed both black- and white- owned race film production companies the opportunity to showcase a wide range of black characters in roles such as doctors, attorneys, judges, bankers, and policemen, depictions that went against the grain of the limited roles mainstream Hollywood films afforded black characters\\".McCluskey, Audrey T., [\\"Imaging Blackness: Race and Racial Representation in Film Poster Art\\"] pg. 64 Black characters were able to transform their mediocre roles as a \\"spooked servant\\" into central elements of the film. For instance, in the 1940s Stepin Fetchit and Mantan Moreland played unforgettable roles in the Charlie Chan mysteries, and their characters even become more popular than Charlie Chan himself. Contemporary mystery/thriller films cast African American like Eddie Murphy, Morgan Freeman, and Denzel Washington in leading roles. Western During the early 1900s Western movies became the most popular genre in Hollywood. Herbert Jeffrey noticed the interest and appeal of the white singing cowboys on screen and the lack of African Americans that were cast in that role. Even though, about one third of all cowboys that settled in the West were in fact African Americans. These cowboys escaped slavery and were often offered save houses with various Indian tribes. Consequently, after Herbert Jeffrey's hard work, the first black cowboy, Jeff Kincaid, made his first appearance on film in Harlem on the Prairie (1937). Despite the segregation laws set in place, Harlem on the Prairie was nationally distributed to both black and white theatres across the country. The success of the film inspired many similar films and bettered the view of African Americans to society. For instance, following, the film The Bronze Buckaroo (1939), the first black western full-length musical, the African American cowboy acts as the lead hero, saving the damsel in distress and then slowly rides off into the sunset. Blaxploitation \\"An examination of Black action films produced both independently by African Americans and by major Hollywood studios during the Black film explosion of the 1960s and 1970s raises important questions about the African American film experience of visuality and identity formation, and the ways in which the look and the gaze of the African American are inextricably linked to a culture of oppression\\".Ongiri, Amy Abugo, \\"Spectacular Blackness: the Cultural Politics of the Black Power Movement and the Search for a Black Aesthetic\\" pg.164 Experts claimed that films could link the fantasies of youth with the visual depiction on film because the lack of nationalistic culture in society. The African American audience often had trouble separating their existence from the visual imagination shown by Hollywood's films. Adult audiences and mature adolescents from middle-class families could view films in the fictional context indented. They, coming from a comfortable home with fulfillment of their needs, regarded films as merely fiction. Contrasting poor African Americans who were susceptible to idolize Hollywood films. The low- income adolescents who did not have a comfortable lifestyle or positive role- models viewed fictional films as reality. Discussions of the Blaxploitation films include, \\"assumptions about the relation of an African American spectatorship to Hollywood in general often rely on the notion that Black spectatorship is either degraded, infantile, or polluted by the outside forces to which it is subjugated\\".Ongiri, Amy Abugo, \\"Spectacular Blackness: the Cultural Politics of the Black Power Movement and the Search for a Black Aesthetic\\" pg.165 Blaxploitation films provided a counter narrative to the idea of white supremacy and the traditional portrayals of African Americans in the Hollywood cinema. The Blaxploitation narrative of \\"ghetto despair\\" illustrated African American's response to the Black Power era. In addition, Blaxploitation films provided and developed the concept of masculinity, which was lacking in Hollywood films. Hollywood films had wide- ranging view of males from \\"the placid, asexual Sidney Poitier model to the plantation Sambo or the comical Steppin Fetchit\\".Ongiri, Amy Abugo, \\"Spectacular Blackness: the Cultural Politics of the Black Power Movement and the Search for a Black Aesthetic\\" pg.167 Blaxploitation films depiction of the destructive inner- city lives of African Americans and the hyper masculine male character both countered and enforced the growing urban African American criminality of the 1960s. The release of the movie Shaft (1971) featured an African American detective who used his Harlem street smarts to help him win a war wagged against a street mob. The director, Gordon Parks characterized an African American as the lead, authoritative role. He also employed many African Americans to help with the film, giving them positions from the screenwriter to casting them as extras in the film. The inclusion of African Americans in the film and during the filmmaking process added a more realistic urban feel. Including African American in filmmaking made a notable impact and set the precedent for future directors. The genre of Blaxploitation affected Hollywood's vision of African Americans as well as the existing political hierarchy in which they were placed in the United States. The increase in Blaxploitation films generally established and defined African Americans in the post-civil rights ear in the United States. By creating the Blaxploitation genre, new representations of Black Power could be shown to audiences. Since the majority of African American movie-viewers were adolescents, it was determined that horror and action movies sold best to these \\"ethnic\\" audiences. Between 1966 and 1975 around seventy Black action films were made either by Hollywood studios or first-time African American production companies. These actions films varied in quality. They ranged from creative narratives to low-budget films. Since during the 1960s and 1970s African Americans first came to become the focus of mainstream entertainment, the creation of the Blaxploitation era formed a visual tradition to refute the stereotypical stigma of African Americans established from history. These films also revealed the limitations and lack of opportunities African Americans were given in society during the period following segregation. However, critics like Clayton Riley from the New York Times argued that Blaxploitation films provided an overly simplistic view of African Americans, which could have had detrimental effects, potentially making African Americans more submissive to societal injustice.

Formed through the merger of the Communist League and the Bolshevik Leninist Group, it was set up in 1984. In the early years it had state units and members in ten provinces of India, and significant mass work. From the 1990s, there was a decline, partly because many of its members were unable to do serious teamwork; and partly because the dogmatic style of Magan Desai, a powerful figure in the strongest state unit, Gujarat, clashed with other members who wanted a more open and non-sectarian functioning. In addition, many ex- Stalinist and ex-Maoists were recruited, and one faction in West Bengal showed that they had simply replaced the Stalin-Mao cult by the Trotsky cult. By the end of the 1990s, the ICS was a much shrunken organisation. The final crisis came after the Gujarat carnage of 2002, when a faction around Desai attacked the most well-known anti-communal and civil rights activist members of the party as self-seeking individuals. The Conference of 2003 saw Gujarat, led by Desai, rejecting a delegate session, so it was unclear how many members were actually in ICS. The West Bengal unit, along with several Gujarat members, left. It is uncertain whether Desai had an actual majority with him, but he continued to call his rump organisation ICS. Their last public activity was a hostile intervention into the World Social Forum of Mumbai 2004. Those who had split subsequently set up an organisation, Radical Socialist. Origins In the early 1980s, there were two Trotskyist organisations affirming support to the USFI, its official section Communist League, successor to the Socialist Workers Party, and the Bolshevik-Leninist Group. The BLG was formed by former CL members, along with some Trotskyists recruited in Britain or the US who had returned to India. Participation in the Bombay textile strike drew the groups closer, and also subjected them to public scrutiny regarding why two distinct groups existed. In 1982, the CL held a Conference in Santipur, West Bengal, which saw it revive from the crisis that had been caused by the split and individual exits between 1975 and 1979. Between 1982 and 1984 there were joint activities between the CL and the BLG, which resulted in the formation of the Inquilabi Communist Sangathan at a conference in Bombay in 1984. The Early Years The united organisation decided not to have a General Secretary, and instead elected a Central Committee and a smaller Central Secretariat. Important leaders included Achin Vanaik, Magan Desai, Thakore Shah, Amar Jesani, Vibhuti Patel, Somendra Kumar, Jagabandhu Chattopadhyay and Kunal Chattopadhyay. Vanaik edited Marxist Outlook, Kumar edited the Hindi Majdoor Jang, and Kunal Chattopadhyay edited the Bangla Naya Antarjatik. Between 1985 and the beginning of the 1990s, the ICS had units in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Kerala, West Bengal, UP, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and members at large in Tamil Nadu, Jammu and Kashmir, Delhi, etc. It was involved in considerable trade union work, in political campaigns around reservations, in anti-communal activities, and in the women's movements. The crucial political documents adopted by the ICS in the early period were The Rajiv Era, an early appraisal of the changing strategy of Indian capitalism and its willingness to open up the economy, and a major attempt to analyse the necessity of affirmative action beyond Dalits. Another document was on the changing nature of communalism and communal violence, which argued that communalism was moving from the fringes to the centre of Indian politics. A major organisational document dealt with the relationship between party, responsibility of members, and of mass organisations. Crisis in the 1990s During the 1990s the ICS declined. A number of factors were involved. The ICS had talented activists, who however often could not work as a team. Secondly, two styles of work repeatedly clashed‚Äîone led by Magan Desai, for whom party work meant taking \\"basic\\" Trotskyist ideas and texts and formulae into every struggle, and others like Vanaik, Rohit Prajapati, and others, for whom mass movement participation was crucial. Third, the recruitment of a significant number of ex-Maoists in West Bengal resulted in a Mao-Stalinist political culture being imported into the organisation. By the late 1990s, Patel, Jesani, Vanaik, had all left the organisation, the ex-Maoists had split to form a formally orthodox Trotskyist group that denounced the USFI. The Gujarat Communalist Carnage, the ICS Resistance, and the Final Split In 2002, the ICS played a tremendous role in campaigns over the Gujarat communal massacres. But this in turn intensified conflicts, with one wing arguing that communalism was reducible to an economic determinist analysis, and also arguing that the other side, in campaigning for secularism, had been projecting individuals rather than the party. Thus, in 2002, the ICS brought out the first major book documenting the Gujarat violence anywhere in India (The Genocidal Pogrom in Gujarat: Anatomy of Indian Fascism), and Prajapati and Trupti Shah in Vadodara played key roles in PUCL's documentation of the violence in Gujarat. Yet by the end of 2002 Prajapati had resigned from the ICS. Another factor in this conflict was a debate over the relationship between environmental struggles and class struggle. The 2003 ICS conference in Vadodara saw the entire West Bengal delegation walking out, along with Trupti Shah. What was left of the ICS was confined to Vadodara. The last major public activity of the ICS was its opposition to the World Social Forum 2004 and support for the mainly Naxalite-backed Mumbai Resistance, for which it brought out a major leaflet. The West Bengal-based Trotskyists who had left ICS in 2003 regrouped in 2008 to form Radical Socialist. This organisation brings out a Bengali journal Radical, and has a website www.radicalsocialist.in. Its members are active in forest rights struggles, trade union struggles, women's movements, and student-youth work. Prajapati, Shah, and a few other Gujarat members are also associated with Radical Socialist.

Life Stokes became a Carmelite at Hitchin, Hertfordshire. Later at the University of Oxford, he graduated there as doctor of divinity, by 1382. During the religious troubles in that year of 1382, Stokes acted as the representative of Archbishop William Courtenay in the university. During Lent he had made an ineffectual complaint against Nicholas of Hereford; and in May he had a statement of Hereford's heresies drawn up by notaries. On 28 May the archbishop sent him a list of twenty-four heresies extracted from Wyclif's writings, and directed him to publish it in the university. Robert Rygge, the chancellor, opposed Stokes in the matter, and on 5 June, when Philip Repington preached at the Priory of St Frideswide, Stokes was prevented from publication by the implied threat of violence. On 10 June Stokes took up a position against Repington, but on the following day left Oxford at the summons of the archbishop.

The general sense of 'a Traverse'See Wiktionary is to cross, or cut across and in general mountaineering, a road or path traveled traverses the steep gradient of the face. In civil engineering, road bed cuttings (or 'traverses') dug by construction operations creating an navigable incline into a hillside traverse the slope, also cut across the gradient as does the skier, climber, or builder. Climbing In climbing, Traversing a climbing wall is a good warm-up exercise. When moving laterally, the technique of crossing through is more efficient than shuffling. In this, the limbs are crossed so that the moves are longer and more fluid. The longer extension requires coordination between the hands and the feet to avoid over- extension of the upper or lower part of the body. If two climbers are roped together for protection, the leader should secure the rope both before and after a difficult move when traversing. This enables the following climber to remove the anchorage before making the difficult move while still having good security from the anchor point which was placed after the move.

Juris pontificii de propaganda fide , vol. II, p. 342, and Vol. VII, p. 97).] (or Ya'qub Awwad, Auwad, Aouad, , born in Hasroun, Lebanon - died on 12 February 1733) was a former Eparch of the Maronite Catholic Archeparchy of Tripoli and the 59th Maronite Patriarch of Antioch from 1705 to his death in 1733. In Latin he is called Iacobus Petrus Evodius Hasruensis. Life Jacob Awad was born in Hasroun, Lebanon. He studied in Rome for thirteen years, and at his return in Lebanon he served as secretary of Patriarch Estephan El Douaihy, who consecrated him bishop of Tripoli[Nasser Gemayel (1991), Patriarche Estephan Douaihy: vie et ≈ìuvres] in 1698. Jacob Awad was elected patriarch on November 6, 1705 by the bishops met in the patriarchal residence of the Qannubin Monastery in Kadisha Valley. His election was confirmed by Pope Clement XI on February 21, 1706[Pierre Dib back as the year 1706, while Eubel 1707.] by Papal bull Romans pontificis and Clement XI with the papal brief Cum nos nuper, granted him the pallium on February 8, 1708. The election of Jacob Awad as patriarch was opposed by a number of bishops, who in the next years built a fierce opposition to him, spreading rumors about inadmissible behavior of the Patriarch in his residence of the Qannubin Monastery.[Declaration of Germanos Farhat, archbishop of Aleppo in: Pierre Dib, op. cit., col. 73.] These rumors turned into a large scandal,[Paul Rouhana, op. cit., p. 114.] and finally the bishops, advised by some Latin missionaries, in particular by the Carmelite Elias Giacinto, sent for Jacob Awad and summoned a brief trial in the church of Saint Serge and Bacchus in Rayfoun. Here, in May 1710, Jacob Awad was declared guilty and deposed. In his place the bishop of Saida, Youssef Moubarak Al Rayfouni, was elected patriarch,Youssef Moubarak Al Rayfouni was consecrated bishop in 1683 by Patriarch Douaihy. and Awad was confined in the monastery of Our Lady of Louiaze. However, to fully enforce the decisions taken, it was necessary to obtain the approval of Pope; with this aim the opponents of Awad sent Georges Benjamin bishop of Ehden to Rome.Georges Benjamin is also known as Georges 'Oubaid, consecrated bishop in 1690 by Patriarch Douaihy. On December 16, 1710 in Rome, contrary to Benjamin's hopes, the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith ruled in favor of Awad. The Holy See, surprised with the serious accusations made against the patriarch and unprecedented procedure used by the synod of the Maronite Church ordered that the Custodian of the Holy Land Fra Laurent de Saint-Laurent was sent to Rayfoun, where Youssef Moubarak lived, to restore Awad to the patriarchal see. On August 13, 1711 Jacob Awad was formally reinstated as Patriarch, but during the ceremony he presented his resignation, probably a way to conciliate the decree of Rome with his opponents' will. Youssef Moubarak was so elected Patriarch for the second time. With this maneuver, he tried to hide the forced deposition of the patriarch with a spontaneous discharge, and all with the approval of the Apostolic Delegate.[Pierre Dib, op. cit., col. 75.] However Jacob Awad had an unexpected support in the French consul in Lebanon, Poullard, that he transferred the patriarch resigned to Sidon under the protection of the French consulate; and from a young Maronite priest stationed in Rome, Giuseppe Simone Assemani. The resignation was examined in Rome by the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith on February 15, 1712, and they decided to start a trial which lasted till May 8, 1713. The final verdict was to reject Awad's resignation, to reinstall him as Patriarch and to condemn the Carmelite Elias Giacinto who was considered the origin of the false rumors. These decisions were confirmed by Pope Clement XI with papal brief Nationem vestram of 30 June 1713vol. VII, pp. 95-96. and easily implemented in Lebanon also because the work of Poullard, who had personally enthrone Awad in the patriarchal residence of Qannubin and the death, on September 8, 1713, of the anti- patriarch Youssef Moubarak; thus in January 1714, Jacob Awad returned to the patriarchal residence in the Qannubin Monastery. The submission and loyalty to the Maronite Church of Rome won him praise directed by Clement XI to entire Maronite nation on 18 August 1714.[Papal brief Cum Great minds in: https://archive.org/stream/iurispontificii04martgoog#page/n309/mode/2up, vol. II, pp. 302-303.] Jacob Awad during his patriarchate helped many Catholic Melkites during the persecutions by the Orthodox party after the schism of 1724. After a long pontificate, Yaaqoub Awwad died in the monastery of Mar Challita in Kisrawan on February 12, 1733. See also * List of Maronite Patriarchs * Maronite Church Sources * Pierre Dib, v.

Early life Odenheimer was born in Philadelphia in 1817, the son of John W. Odenheimer and Henrietta Burns Odenheimer. Odenheimer was prepared at Flushing, Long Island, at the famous Institute founded in 1828 by the Reverend William Augustus Muhlenberg (1796-1877). Scholars emanating from the Flushing Institute very often matriculated in the third year at Penn, Virginia, Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and other colleges. Odenheimer graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1835.Perry, 141 He would have left Penn just upon the arrival of another Muhlenberg \\"school son,\\" J. Lloyd Breck (1818-1876), the legendary missionary educator of Wisconsin, Minnesota, and California. Odenheimer next attended the General Theological Seminary, graduating in 1838. In 1839, he married Anne Randall Shaw. They would have eleven children but only two, Anne and Margaret, would live to adulthood.Fish, 1 Odenheimer was ordained deacon three years later, in 1838 by Bishop Henry U. Onderdonk, and was ordained priest by the same bishop in 1841.Batterson, 190 After his ordination to the priesthood, he served as rector of St. Peter's Church in Philadelphia, remaining at the parish from his ordination until his elevation to the episcopate. While there, Odenheimer received a doctorate of divinity from the University of Pennsylvania. He also published several books, including \\"The True Catholic No Romanist,\\" (1842) about the Oxford Movement, and \\"Essay on Canon Law\\" (1847). Odenheimer was a strong supporter of the Oxford Movement and changed the organization of St. Peter's to reflect that preference.Fish, 1‚Äì2 His theological beliefs were out of step with the rising anti-Catholicism of Philadelphia in the 1840s, but Odenheimer sought to steer a middle course between the extremes of Catholicism and Protestantism.Fish, 2 Bishop of New Jersey Odenheimer was consecrated the third Bishop of New Jersey in 1859. He was the 66th bishop in the Episcopal Church, and was consecrated in St. Paul's Church, Richmond, Virginia by Bishops William Meade, Samuel Allen McCoskry, and William Rollinson Whittingham, along with other co- consecrators. While bishop, Odenheimer received an additional degree, a doctor of canon law from the University of Oxford, in 1867.Batterson, 191 During the first fifteen years of his episcopate he confirmed nearly 16,000 people, and the number reached 20,000 before his death. He visited the parishes of his diocese often until 1866, when injuries from a fall broke his kneecaps and forced him to curtail his travels.Fish, 3 As his diocese grew, church authorities found it necessary to divide it into northern and southern portions in 1874, with Odenheimer continuing as bishop of the northern diocese, later renamed the Diocese of Newark. He was succeeded as diocesan bishop for New Jersey by John Scarborough. He died in 1879 in Burlington, New Jersey, and was buried at St. Mary's Episcopal Church in that town.

From late 2000 to 2003, the PQ government had amalgamated (merged) many Quebec cities with their suburbs or neighbouring municipalities. This was imposed through legislation by the Quebec government rather than by the initiative of the municipalities themselves. In Canada, municipal governments are creatures of the provincial governments. However, the amalgamation proved unpopular in some places, with residents wishing to de-merge from the newly expanded cities and reconstitute their former municipalities. The 2004 referendums were organized to provide an opportunity to vote on the matter. Signing of registers As a first step, a minimum threshold of 10% of the population of a former municipality was required to sign a register in order for a referendum to be held.

History The railway was opened by the Spoorweg-Maatschappij Almelo-Salzbergen (English: Almelo-Salzbergen railway company) on 18 October 1865, after construction had started in 1862. In Salzbergen the line connected with the Emsland Railway, which had opened in 1855. The Dutch section of the line (Almelo - Oldenzaal) was electrified in 1951 and the remainder of the line was electrified in 1976. From 2006 to 2009 the line through Almelo was the subject of a major project called Almelo Verdiept Almelo Lowered, which moved the railway line through the centre of Almelo into a lowered embankment, with sections of tunnels. Route The railway connects Almelo in a south easterly direction with Hengelo. Before Hengelo station the line from Zutphen railway station merges into the route. After the station the line to Enschede railway station branches out in a south easterly direction. From Hengelo the line heads north east towards the former border station of Oldenzaal and heads east across the border to Bad Bentheim. Here the electric current changes, which often results in a change from a Dutch to a German locomotive. At Bad Bentheim the private freight railway to Nordhorn and Coevorden branches out, heading north. The line continues through the countryside, until the line merges with the Emsland Railway from Emden before finishing at Salzbergen. =Main stations= The main stations on the Almelo‚ÄìSalzbergen railway are: * Almelo railway station * Hengelo railway station * Bad Bentheim railway station * Salzbergen railway station Train services The Almelo‚ÄìSalzbergen railway is used by the following passenger services: * International services across the whole line (Amsterdam Centraal - Berlin) * Intercity services between Almelo and Hengelo (Schiphol/The Hague/Rotterdam - Enschede) * Stoptrein services between Almelo and Hengelo (Apeldoorn/Zwolle - Enschede) and Hengelo - Bad Bentheim (Zutphen - Oldenzaal, Hengelo - Bad Bentheim) * WestfalenBahn services between Bad Bentheim and Salzbergen (Bad Bentheim - Osnabr√ºck - Bielefeld) Train types A wide variety of trains can be found regularly on the Almelo‚ÄìSalzbergen railway: * NS Class 1700 on the Schiphol - Berlin service between Almelo and Bad Bentheim * DB Class 101 or DB Class 120 on the Schiphol - Berlin service between Bad Bentheim and Berlin * NS Koploper on the Schiphol/The Hague/Rotterdam - Enschede service between Almelo and Hengelo * NS Sprinter on the Apeldoorn - Enschede service between Almelo and Hengelo * NS Buffel on the Zwolle - Enschede service between Almelo and Hengelo * Syntus Buffel on the Hengelo - Bad Bentheim service between Hengelo and Bad Bentheim * Syntus Lint41 on the Zutphen - Oldenzaal service between Hengelo and Oldenzaal * WestfalenBahn Stadler Flirt on the Bad Bentheim - Bielefeld service between Bad Bentheim and Salzbergen There are also large number of freight trains operating along the line.

Greenfield was born in London on 1 April 1799. His father, William Greenfield, a native of Haddington, attended Well Street Chapel, London, then under the ministry of Alexander Waugh. He joined a missionary voyage in the ship Duff, and was accidentally drowned when his son was two years old. In the spring of 1802 Greenfield was taken by his mother to Jedburgh. In the summer of 1810 they returned to London, and Greenfield resided for some time with his two maternal uncles, who gave him instruction. They were men of business who studied languages in order to understand learned quotations, and they taught him. In October 1812 Greenfield was apprenticed to a bookbinder named Rennie. A Jew employed in his master's house, and a reader of the law in the synagogue, taught him Hebrew gratuitously. At sixteen Greenfield began to teach in the Fitzroy Sabbath School, of which his master was a conductor. At seventeen he became a member of Well Street Chapel, and a close friend of the minister, Dr. Waugh. In 1824 he left business to devote himself to languages and biblical criticism. In 1827 he published The Comprehensive Bible ‚Ä¶ with ‚Ä¶ a general introduction ‚Ä¶ Notes, &c.; The book, though fiercely attacked as heterodox by the 'Record' and a Dr. Henderson, became very popular, especially among Unitarians. An abridgment was afterwards published as The Pillar of Divine Truth immoveably fixed on the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets. ‚Ä¶ The whole of the arguments and illustrations drawn from the pages of the Comprehensive Bible, by ‚Ä¶[W.

He had no previous knowledge of the Mahratta and other languages referred to in the pamphlet, which, it is said, was written within five weeks of his taking up the subject. He followed it up by A Defence of the Surinam Negro-English Version of the New Testament ‚Ä¶, 1830 (in reply to the Edinburgh Christian Instructor). While nineteen months in the society's service Greenfield wrote upon twelve European, five Asiatic, one African, and three American languages; and acquired considerable knowledge of Peruvian, Surinam Creole, Chippeway, and Berber. His last undertaking for the society was the revision of the Modern Greek Psalter as it went through the press. He also projected a grammar in thirty languages, but in the midst of his labours he was struck down by brain fever, dying at Islington on 5 November 1831.The Gentleman's Magazine 1831, pt. ii. p. 473 He left a widow and five children, on whose behalf a subscription was openedThe Gentleman's Magazine 1832, pt. i. pp. 89-90 His portrait by Hayter was engraved by Holl.Edward Evans, Cat. of Engraved Portraits, ii. 177 Greenfield was a member of the Royal Asiatic Society.

Accessed 2011-03-12. It is believed that the Meredith family heavily favored the style, because they were responsible for building both of those bridges. Throughout Ohio, only eight Long truss bridges are in existence today; the majority of Ohio's Long truss bridges are located in southern Ohio. Besides the importance of the Meredith family, this concentration is also likely due to the presence of one of the designer's agents in the region, who also functioned as a general contractor for bridge construction in southern Ohio. In early 1975, the Root Covered Bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying because of its importance as a well-preserved example of historic engineering methods.

Since such nomina were used by pharaohs only when their fathers were also pharaohs and since Iufni reigned in their midst, Ryholt argues that Iufni must have been part of the family including Sekhemkare Amenmhat V, Ameny Qemau, Siharnedjheritef and Amenemhat VI. Given the brevity of Iufni's reign, Ryholt proposes that he may have been a brother of Siharnedjheritef or simply a grandson of Amenemhat V.

Plot 1865. Joseph Charlegrand is a former French soldier whose best friend and comrade was murdered by an officer of the French Foreign Legion in Mexico. Looking for the murderer, Charlegrand is heading for a martial arts tournament in the United States because the murderer takes his pride in being a skilled fighter. On his way from Mexico to Texas some American rogues take him for a Yankee and ambush him. He can fight them off but loses his horse. On foot he runs out of water and eventually breaks down. Two young farmers (Ashley Laurence and Ian Ziering as Mary and Cain Parker) save his life. When the farmers go to town for purchases they are molested and eventually seriously attacked by the roustabouts of a local business man who wants their land very badly. The film's protagonist returns the farmer's favour by applying his savate. Yet it is obvious they need further support. Consequently, he stays with them and even instructs Cain how to fight, so that he might win the martial arts tournament and hereby earn the money they need to pay the new taxes. But during one night masked riders burn their barn and one of them loses a precision dice. Cain recognises this object, follows the culprit into town and confronts him. After Cain has been shot dead, all farmers are ready to sell out. The hero decides he mustn't let that happen, hence he takes the dead farmer's place in the tournament and tells the farmers to bet all their money on him. In order to prevent him from being successful, his friend's murderer, the German-speaking von Trotta (Marc Singer) is hired. But the bad guys leave nothing to chance and also take Mary Parker as hostage. Charlegrand manages to cause enough confusion to disappear between two fights, so that he can free Mary and force Colonel Jones (James Brolin) to spill the beans. The alleged new taxes turn out to be a hoax but the farmer's savings are on Charlegrand and so they still need him to win the tournament. Therefore, his final battle with von Trotta mustn't be postponed, even though Charlegrand has been shot in the course of action. Background The French Foreign Legion had been founded in 1831, one year after the Garde √âcossaise had been officially dissolved. Right from the beginning many German-speaking men joined the forces, often hiding behind false names. In 1861 Napoleon III used the Legion for the French intervention in Mexico. It lasted until 1867. At that time Charles Lecour had already created and established French boxing as a blend of savate and English boxing. Hitherto savateurs had used their hands mainly to block kicks or to fence with sticks (canne de combat) at the same time. One of Lecour's students was former army instructor Joseph Charlemont. Against this background it is imaginable a savateur like Joseph Charlegrand could have served in Mexico and that he might have met a German- speaking legionnaire during this time, though the slow speed of communications and travel in 1865 as well as the lack of cross-over in combat sports of the time make the idea of an international martial arts contest in the wilds of the American West highly unlikely.

In the 20th century, the species was introduced to the United States.Fauna europaea Habitat The hairy-footed flower bees commonly inhabit gardens, open woodland, and coastal sites.BWARS- Bees, Wasps & Ants Recording Society, 2013. Anthophora plumipes Description The adults of Anthophora plumipes grow up to long. There are numerous color forms over the species' geographic range, which have resulted in this species being described under many different names. This species shows an evident sexual dimorphism. The body is always densely hairy. Males have most often bright reddish brown or gray hair, while females are usually all black or dark brown. Furthermore, the females show reddish orange scopal hairs on the hind tibia. The middle legs of males are very elongated. Males are also distinguished from females by having long hairs on its mid tarsi and the integument of the lower face yellow or cream coloured, rather than black. The long tufts of black hairs on the tarsi (hence the Latin word plumipes) are used as a visual signal during mating. Biology Anthophora plumipes is a univoltine species. These bees can be encountered from March to June, feeding and collecting pollen and nectar on early flowering plants, mainly on (Primulaceae species (Primula veris, Primula acaulis, etc.), Boraginaceae species (Pulmonaria officinalis, Borago officinalis, etc.), Lamiaceae species (Lamium purpureum) and Fumariaceae (Corydalis spp.). These solitary bees do not build colonies. The females usually make nests in clay slopes and steep walls of mud, where they excavate cells, which they fill with pollen and nectar (as food for the larvae), laying a single egg on each pollen mass.

Early life He was born into a working class family in 1958 and in 1982 he graduated with a Degree in Philosophy with a thesis on the Hungarian philosopher √Ågnes Heller. During the University, he was part of the student movement and worked as a journalist. In 1985, he joined in the Italian Communist Party.  Mayor of Pontedera and Regional Assessor of Health  From 1985 to 1990 he was a member of the City Council of Pontedera (an industrial town with a large Piaggio-Vespa factory), serving as Vice Mayor and Councillor for Social Policy and Urban Planning. Later, he became Mayor of the same city, holding the office for nine years, from 1990 to 1999. During his second term, Rossi fought against the move of the Piaggio from Pontedera to Nusco. In 2000, Enrico Rossi was elected as a Member of the Regional Council of Tuscany, and for ten years he was Regional Assessor for Healthcare. Under his leadership, the regional public health services reached a high level of quality, with modern facilities and technologies, becoming the first in Italy, for the quality label \\"Essential Levels of Care\\" (LEA). Merit, evaluation and research were the cornerstones of his policies. President of Tuscany After being one of the founders of the Democratic Party in 2007, Enrico Rossi was elected as President of Tuscany in 2010 with a majority of about 60% of voters, leading a centre-left coalition. He ran again for the Presidency in 2015, and was then reelected. Since 2010 he is regularly among the top-3 most appreciated presidents of Italian regions, according to surveys run by Il Sole 24 Ore economic newspaper. =Giovanis√¨= In June 2011, Rossi launched Giovanis√¨. The program, cost ‚Ç¨400 million and advantaged 100,000 youngs, comprised right to education, help to vocational education, civil service, credits to specialization studies and contribution to pay the rent. From June 2011 to February 2014, there were 14,251 interships, 5,637 announcement for houses accepted, 4,000 projects to civil service, 1,500 young business financed, 80,000 benefits of scholarships. The European Commissioner L√°szl√≥ Andor acclaimed Rossi's program, based on a similar European project. =Solidary Tuscany= The program Solidary Tuscany (\\"Toscana Solidale\\") was created for a war on poverty, to support the more poor families and workers. The program includes a baby bonus of ‚Ç¨700 for infant, ‚Ç¨700 for disabled children, ‚Ç¨700 annual for numerous families, ‚Ç¨3,000 of credit for occasional workers. =Spending review= Enrico Rossi launched a cut of the public spending. Since 2011, he earnt the lowest pay between the Presidents of Region in Italy, like his assessors and the regional councillors. In May 2012, he sold off the \\"blue cars\\" (free public car of the Italian politicians) in favour of methane-powered Fiat Puntos. Regional officeholders travel in second class with trains, on budget airlines and from 2009 the spending of the Rossi Administration and staff was reduced of 60%. In 2011 the number of regional councillors decreased from 65 to 55 and the assessors from 14 to 10. From 2015, the life annuity has been abolished. =Other issues= Rossi asked the central government not to renew Trenitalia's contract, but launch a European tender. Rossi exposed the poor condition of the trains, and demanded better public funding. In 2013, Rossi created a new waste plan, with the proposal to realize 70% waste sorting by 2020, without new waste plants. In 2014, Rossi created a landscape plan that protects 365 areas from possible \\"Ecomonsters\\" (buildings that spoil the landscape).  Commitment to the European Union  In Europe, he is a socialist Member of the European Committee of the Regions (CoR) following the works of the Commission for Social Policy, Education, Employment, Research and Culture (SEDEC) and previously of the Commission for Economic Policy (ECON) and Commission for Natural Resources (NAT).

He is also Vice-President of the Conference of Peripheral Maritime Regions (CPMR) in charge of Cohesion. Since the beginning of the post-2020 negotiations, he has actively contributed to the discussion on the future of Cohesion policy presenting also an Open contribution for the post 2020, a position outlining his views on the future of the Cohesion. Firmly convinced about the importance of the #Cohesionalliance, in view of the EU elections he launched a territorial campaign ‚ÄúEurope in Tuscany‚Äù underlining the importance of ESIF funds, personally visiting 100 projects financed by ERDF, EARDF and ESF in Tuscany.

He was the Fourth Priest of Amun in Thebes. He is known from many statues and was buried in tomb TT34 of the Theban Necropolis. History Mentuemhat's father likely served as Mayor of Thebes during the reign of Shebitku. Montuemhat's father Nesptah passed on the position of Mayor of Thebes to his nephew Remmakheru and later to Mentuemhat himself. Mentuemhat served during the reigns of Taharqa and Psamtik I, which cover parts of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt and Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt. When Tantamani came to power he attempted to regain lost territories in Lower Egypt, which he attacked, seizing Memphis and killing the Assyrian vassal Necho I in the process. Subsequently, Assurbanipal attacked Egypt, defeating Tantamani near Memphis, who then fled to Thebes, but the Assyrians pursued him there. Tantamani fled further south, while the Assyrians looted Thebes. After this episode Thebes became a more or less independent entity under the rule of the Mayor Mentuemhat. Thebes would have been ruled by Mentuemhat and the God's Wife Shepenupet II. When Psamtik I came to the throne he negotiated a deal in year 9 where[Shepenupet II adopted Psamtik's daughter Nitocris I. This negotiation would have been overseen by Montuemhat. These events were commemorated in a series of reliefs in the Temple of Mut. The Adoption Stela of Nitocris lists offerings made by Mentuemhat, his son Nesptah and his wife Wadjerenes.Edna R.

It is not a celebration of Mahmud Ahmad's birth which occurred on 12 January, but rather the commemoration of the prophecy and its fulfilment in his person. Background In the 1880s, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad confronted several Hindu leaders who demanded to show them signs in favour of Islam as a living religion. In response to this, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad travelled to the town of Hoshiarpur where he spent 40 days in seclusion praying for divine signs in favour of Islam over other faiths. Subsequently, on 20 February 1886 he published a revelation which contained the prophecy concerning the birth of an illustrious son: = Fulfilment of prophecy = Mirza Ghulam Ahmad further declared on April 8, 1886 that it was disclosed to him that this son will be born within a period of nine years. However a few days after this announcement his wife, Nusrat Jehan gave birth to a daughter and his adversaries began alleging that his prophecy was proved false. Again in August 1887 a son was born to him but died in infancy, and again his critics alleged that the prophecy was falsified. Ghulam Ahmad pointed out that this son was the 'guest‚Äô that was promised, and that the prophecy concerning the promised son began from the passage He will be accompanied by grace (Fazl) which shall arrive with him. On January 12, 1889, Mirza Mahmud Ahmad was born who is believed by the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community to be the promised son and one who according to Ahmadis displayed in his person all the qualities mentioned in the prophecy. Ahmadis believe that the fulfilment of the prophecy spans the 52-year-long Caliphate of Mirza Basheer-ud-Din Mahmud Ahmad.

Mainz am Rhein, 1997  Evidence  No contemporary attestation of Sewadjkare survives to this day and this pharaoh is only known to us thanks to the Turin canon. This king list was redacted during the early Ramesside period from older documents and serves as the primary source for kings of the Second Intermediate Period. Sewadjkare's name appears on the 7th column, 13th line of the papyrus.  Reign length  The Turin canon normally gives the reign length of the kings it lists; however, the duration of Sewadjkare's reign is lost in a lacuna. Only the number of days is partially preserved and was read by Ryholt as eleven to fourteen days. The space apparently taken by the total duration of the reign as recorded on the Turin canon led Ryholt to propose a minimum reign length of half a month. Given the total absence of contemporary attestation for Sewadjkare, it seems likely that he was an ephemeral ruler. Identity Sewadjkare should not be confused with two other pharaohs bearing the same prenomen, and who reigned later in the Second Intermediate Period. Sewadjkare Hori II, also known as Hori II, reigned at the very end of the 13th Dynasty, from c. 1669 until 1664 BC. The other ruler with the same prenomen is Sewadjkare III of the 14th Dynasty, who is also known only thanks to the Turin canon. Sewadjkare III reigned for a short while, some time between c. 1699 and 1694 BC.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The church stands to the north of the junction between Trinity Street (the A131 road) and Chapel Hill. History A chapel, Holy Trinity Chapel, was built on the site in about 1413, but this had disappeared by the 18th century. The present church was built in 1843‚Äì44, and most of it was paid for by Mrs Mary Gee of Colne House, Earls Colne. A grant of ¬£500 came from funds provided by Parliament in the Church Building Act 1824. The church was designed by George Gilbert Scott. As the building of the spire was nearing completion, it collapsed, fortunately causing only minor injuries to the builders. An organ chamber was added in 1876. The church was declared redundant in April 1987. Architecture =Exterior= Holy Trinity is constructed in brick with flint facing. It has gault brick and limestone dressings. The roofs are slated with tiles on the ridges. Its plan consists of a nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles, a chancel, a northeast vestry, an organ chamber, and a southwest tower with a spire. The tower incorporates a porch. It is a Gothic Revival church in 13th-century Early English style. The tower is tall with four stages. On its south side is a doorway. The second and third stages contain single-lancet windows flanked by arcading. In the third stage is a quatrefoil opening on each side. The bell openings consist of a pair of narrow lancets, with blind arches on each side. On the tower is a broach spire with two tiers of lucarnes. In the gable at the east end of the church is a wheel window, with spokes radiating from a hub. Below this are three lancet windows of equal height. At all corners of the church are clasping buttresses. The sides of the aisles are divided into bays by buttresses, and each bay contains a lancet window. Along the clerestory is arcading with alternate blind arches and lancet windows. At the west end is a doorway, above which is a triple lancet window, with a single lancet above that. =Interior= The walls are plastered and whitewashed. Between the nave and the aisles on each side is a six-bay arcade supported by alternating circular and octagonal piers. The seating in the nave and aisles, and probably the font, with its square bowl on an octagonal base, date from the time of the building of the church. The lectern dates from 1906, and the choir stalls were added in 1913. The panelling in the chancel, and the pulpit date from the early 20th century. At the east end of the south aisle is a memorial screen added in 1922. The stained glass in the west window dates from 1851 and is by Clutterbuck, the east window of 1887 is by Burlison and Grylls, the east window in the south aisle dated 1922 is by J. C. N. Bewsey, and three windows in the south aisle of 1931‚Äì32 are by A. K. Nicholson. The three-manual organ was made in 1858. In 1878 E. W. Norman of Norwich and Diss either rebuilt it or supplied a new organ. This was subsequently restored in 1909 by Binns of Leeds, again in about 1970 by Cedric Arnold of Thaxted, and at a later date by Bishop and Son.

Early life  Ernest was born on May 27, 1903 to Pasquale Rossi and Anna Costa at 250 Mott Street. Immigration ship manifests show that his parents were recent immigrants to New York City from Naples, Italy.  Criminal career  According to police, Rossi had a long police record and was described as a \\"gangster and racketeer\\". He was a known follower of Frankie Yale and was a friend and associate of Al Capone when he lived in Brooklyn. Rossi was described by police as having a police record \\"as long as your arm\\", and by August 1929, had been arrested four times without being convicted of a crime.  Death  On April 17, 1931, Rossi was shot and killed in a Cadillac bearing the license plate \\"2-Z-2950\\" as it was stopped in front of the home of Police Captain Lewis J. Valentine at 1650 68th Street in Brooklyn. Witnesses stated three reports, at first taken as engine backfires, were heard and then two men leaped from the rear seat and ran down 68th Street. When found, he was slumped over the steering wheel with six gunshot wounds, all from the rear. The motor of the car was still running with clutch disengaged and one rear door hanging open, indicating the car had come to a stop before the shooting. There is disagreement over whether Rossi's murder was a reprisal killing for the murder of Joe Masseria, boss of what is now called the Genovese crime family, two days before. Rossi was not seen as an important enough figure to be a target, but some past associates of Frankie Yale were murdered after the Masseria murder. An alternate explanation is that the murder was the result of a personal feud with Cattilo Grimaldi of 114 12th Street. Police believe Rossi had a hand in the shooting and wounding of Cattilo a month prior to his death.

There are majorities of the Aulihan clan in Somali Ethiopia regions. The majorities migrated in response to pressure from the expanding Ethiopian empire and had taken control of the hinterland of the lower Jubba river by the 1870s. The Aulihan today hold the middle Jubba Valley areas north of Gelib. Their grazing territory extends across the border into Kenya, and they claim a large part of northeastern Garissa District. They are active in the cross-border cattle trade. In 1984 there was little rain. In search of grazing, Aulihan from Garissa District pushed into Isiolo District where they started to push the Boran people from their pasturage and to raid their herds. In December 1915, the Aulihan raided some Samburu who had taken their herds into the Lorian Swamp, stealing several thousand cattle. The British, preoccupied with military operations against the Germans in German East Africa, were slow to respond. After their post at Sarinley in Jubaland was sacked, the British withdrew from their other posts in the northeast frontier region of the East African Protectorate. The Aulihan attempted to get other clans involved in their struggle against the colonialists, but were not successful. Eventually, in September 1917 the British sent an expedition that re-occupied Serenli, and followed up with successful operations against the northern Aulihan who capitulated on 15 January 1918. Further ruthless operations against southern Aulihan were completed in March 1918. In the late 1980s the Aulihan, Mohamed Zubeyr and other Ogadeen clansmen had formed the Somali Patriotic Movement (SPM), taking control of the Lower Jubba. In the mid-1990s there was a split within the Ogadeen, with the Aulihan led by General Nur Gebiyo joining with General Hersi Morgan's Harti-based faction of the SPM.The strongest sub clan of the Ogaden By 2000, Senior Olow Subclans Aulyahan branches to nine sub clans which is divided into three categories * 1.

Created by Berlin H. Manalaysay, he first appeared in Funny Komiks in 1992. Plot =Origin= Empoy and the original Combatron Empoy, an orphaned boy, witnessed a spaceship crash while visiting his parents‚Äô graves. As he approached the crash site, the door of the spaceship opened. Inside was an injured space warrior from Omnicron, a cyborg named Combatron. He came to Earth after he and his allies were branded as outlaws. Knowing that his pursuers were coming to Earth, the dying Omnicronian gave Empoy his armor and the robot dog in his employ, named Askal (Asong Mekanikal). =Earth under attack= Suddenly, Empoy realized the reason of the spaceship's crash. It was being chased by another ship containing evil cyborg aliens wearing cybernetic armors. They continued their pursuit and found earth and its inhabitants an easy target to be conquered. Upon landing, they saw the crashed ship and found Combatron, a fight broke out and Combatron gained the upper hand. The villain returned to their base, warning Combatron that their war isn't over and earth will be conquered. After then, a series of enemies appear to try to defeat Combatron. He defeats them all, until their leader appears. Combatron was defeated by the leader Abo- dawn, and withdraws to get help. Combatron decides to head for Omicron, the homeworld of the Space Warriors. On the way, he was intercepted by Bogus, a subordinate of Abo-dawn who is a master of illusions and was trapped in a video-game resembling various popular video-games. But an all-out attack from Combatron destroys Bogus and neutralizes the illusion. A double agent under the alias of Komikus secretly aids Combatron in his struggles. Combatron acquires new powers and allies. He then challenges the leader to a rematch and defeats him. But just when it seems the battles are over a new threat appears in the name of Death Metal. =New Allies= Combatron, Axel and Metalica battling ManticronEven before the time of Death Metal's emergence, Combatron has lost his first dog sidekick, Askal, to a villain called Diaconda. He was then replaced by Dobbernaut. Two allies of similar armours also emerged. Axel, in green, and Metallica, in red/pink. =Unstoppable Death Metal= Death Metal is revealed to be the reborn Alchitran, rendered indestructible after being transformed from a comet impact. Searching for revenge against Abo-Dawn and with indirect hostilities against Combatron, Death Metal throws the galaxy into a three-way battle of supremacy. The new villain also mustered new allies, Quietus, Bracagon, and Helvetica. The sides of war was quickly reduced to two as Abo-Dawn and his forces were easily dealt with by Death Metal. Combatron and his allies, despite fighting valiantly, were also defeated by Death Metal. Combatron used the vortex he was previously sucked into during the battle with a previous enemy (Caligula) and trapped Death Metal temporarily. =Upgrades= Combatron and company took advantage of their precious time and repaired themselves. Combatron himself underwent an upgrade with hip disks and torso as the most noticeable features. Galactic Thunder and Galactic Phoenix were added powers that would prove useful further on their battles. =Round 2 and the \\"Bigger Enemy\\"= Metallica, on her way to the comet where Alchitran's original body is to be found, was captured by an even newer threat; a planet that calls himself Megadeath. Meanwhile, Combatron engaged Death Metal once again. This time around, the battle was more of a stalemate. Their fight, however, was interrupted by a strange light that transferred them directly to the planetoid being; Megadeath, who wanted the two combatants to bow to him.

Early activism M. V. Vishniak was born in Moscow in 1883, the son of a wealthy merchant. He was a childhood friend of the future Socialist- Revolutionary leaders A.R. Gots and I.I. Fondaminsky. As a law student at Moscow University he came in contact with Narodnik circles, but he did not join the Socialist-Revolutionary Party (PSR) until 1905, when he was radicalised by the Revolution of 1905. He was a delegate at the PSR Congress in 1906. Vishniak contributed to several party journals under the pseudonym 'Veniamin Marks'. Under that name he wrote The Legal Status of Jews in Russia, one of the earliest sustained discussions of the condition of Russian Jews. In 1906 he was arrested and deported to Narimski but escaped. Over the next ten years, he was repeatedly arrested, escaped several times and spent time abroad (mainly in France). Defencism and Revolution In 1914 he took a Defencist position. After the February Revolution of 1917, he was elected to the All- Russian Congress of Soviets of Peasants' Deputies and to the Executive Committee of the All-Russian Soviet of Peasants' Deputies. Vishniak belonged to the commission which drafted the proceedings for elections to the Constituent Assembly. He belonged to the Interim Council of the Republic (Pre- Parliament) and was elected to the short-lived Constituent Assembly (which the Bolsheviks suspended after one day). Vishniak was fiercely opposed to the October Revolution. He participated in anti-Bolshevik activities. In 1918 he moved to Ukraine, where he fell foul of the government of Herman Skoropadski and was arrested. After the Hetman fell, Vishniak was released. In 1919 he emigrated to Western Europe, living mainly in Paris, France, until 1940. Exile in Europe M. V. Vishniak. In France Vishniak was active among Russian exiles and in the Jewish community. He attended the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 as a delegate for the Jewish people and had become a supporter of socialist Zionism. He also belonged to the World Congress of Jewish Minorities. Within the exile community he was close to resolute anti- Bolsheviks like Fondaminsky and even co-operated with P.B. Struve and P.N. Miliukov. In the internecine factional struggles of the PSR, he stood on the right. He contributed to several √©migr√© journals, including Sovremennye zapiski (Contemporary Annals) and the Evreiskaia Tribuna (the Jewish Tribune). From 1937 on he edited Russkie Zapiskii (Russian Notes). When Hitler invaded France, Vishniak escaped to the United States, but he could not persuade his friend Fondaminsky to flee; Fondaminsky was later killed in Auschwitz. Exile in America Vishniak himself settled in New York. He became an American citizen and a respected figure in American journalism and academia: He served on the editorial board of Time Magazine and worked as its consultant on Russian affairs. He also taught Russian language and literature at Cornell University. One of his students was the historian Richard Pipes. Vishniak wrote prolifically on the history of the Russian Revolution, Bolshevism and Soviet policy, his memoirs, the Jewish community, etc. His memoirs include A Tribute to the Past (1954) and Years of Emigration, 1919-1969. He died in New York in 1977.

Early years Born in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada in 1916, W. A. Waterton was brought up in Camrose, Alberta, where his father was chief of police.Hamilton-Paterson 2018, p. 49. His family originally came from north Sydenham Township and settled in Owen Sound, Ontario. He was interested in flying from an early age.Armitage, Andrew. \\"Ace test pilot was once a British celebrity and household name.\\" Owen Sound Library, (article first appeared in the (Owen Sound) The Sun Times, 11 February 2011).

Aviation career =Second World War= Entering the Royal Military College of Canada in 1935, after two years at the school, where he was a champion middleweight boxer, Waterton had applied without success to the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) and Canadian Army in 1938.\\"Top Fifteen: Sqn Ldr William Arthur ‚ÄúBill‚Äù Waterton GM AFC*.\\" National Cold War Exhibition (RAF Museum). Retrieved 12 March 2011. Ultimately, he was accepted on a short service commission for the Royal Air Force (RAF) which was expanding rapidly in expectation of war. In Britain, he took flying lessons and joined the RAF on 10 June 1939. He was first posted to No. 242 Squadron RAF and flew Hawker Hurricanes from Biggin Hill and Manston during the Battle of France. In operations over Dunkirk on 25 May 1940, he crashed near Dover and suffered severe head injuries. When Waterton returned to flying duties, he was sent to No. 6 Operational Training Unit. His skills as an instructor were recognised and he was made a flying instructor, training hundreds of pilots for over two years in both the UK and Canada.Ralph 2005, p. 72. =Test flying= After a stint with Transatlantic Ferry Command in 1943, and initially posted to No. 124 Squadron in September 1943, he was transferred to 1409 (Meteorological) Flight. In 1944, Waterton applied to the Air Fighting Development Unit based at Wittering in Lincolnshire which assessed captured enemy aircraft by flying them in mock combat against the greatest variety of Allied aircraft. During this period, he amassed a great deal of test flying in devising tactics for Fighter Command based on the actual performance of aircraft in \\"real life\\" conditions.Corbett, Neil. \\"S/Ldr William 'Bill' A.

He achieved an average speed of 614 mph with Meteor IV EE550, only two mph less than that of the team leader E. M. Donaldson who established a new record with EE549 on 7 September 1946.\\"A tentative record.\\" Flight, 12 September 1946.

He became the company's Chief Test Pilot, primarily in charge of experimental flight testing their new designs, the Meteor family, the experimental Gloster E.1/44, and the delta- wing Gloster GA.5 which entered service as the Gloster Javelin. He also was involved in acceptance test flying on production aircraft.Rossiter 2002, pp. 61‚Äì62.

In 1950, Waterton was loaned to Avro Canada for the test flights of the Avro CF-100 Canuck because as a Canadian by birth, and as an experienced test pilot, it was considered a public relations triumph for the parent Hawker Siddeley Group.Rossiter 2002, p. 63.

The following year, Waterton published his autobiography The Quick and the Dead in which he accused the British aviation industry of being badly run, aiming for a quick profit and lagging behind the Soviet and US industry. Due to advertiser pressure, Waterton was fired by the Daily Express, and his departure was covered on their own front page: \\"We Sacked Waterton ‚Äì and Why\\".Hamilton-Paterson 2010, pp. 174‚Äì175. =Later years= Thereafter, Waterton moved back to Canada to his hometown of Owen Sound, Ontario and largely led a life out of the public eye.

According to his own account, Elliot then travelled about Europe for the next two years, and was returning to England in June 1670, when he was taken captive by Moors and sold as a slave. His description of his captivity and escape cannot be assumed true in detail. In November Elliot reached England, and worked as a private tutor for the next two years.

Mississauga is a city in the Canadian province of Ontario. It is a suburb of Toronto. The city is situated in the Regional Municipality of Peel and covers of land, fronting of shoreline on Lake Ontario. Mississauga is bounded by Oakville and Milton to the west/southwest, Brampton to the north, Toronto to the east, and Lake Ontario to the south/south-east. Halton Hills borders Mississauga's north-west corner. With the exception of the southeast border with Toronto (Etobicoke Creek), Mississauga shares a land border with all of the previous mentioned municipalities. Two major river valleys feed into the lake. The Credit River is by far the longest with the heaviest flow. It divides the western side of Mississauga from the central/eastern portions and enters the lake at the Port Credit harbour west of Hurontario Street. The indented, mostly forested valley was inhabited by First Nation peoples long before European exploration of the area. The valley is protected and maintained by the Credit Valley Conservation Authority (CVCA). Etobicoke Creek forms part of the eastern border of Mississauga with the City of Toronto as far north as Eglinton Avenue. North of there it passes through the western infield area of Toronto Pearson International Airport. There have been two aviation accidents, in 1978 and 2005, where aircraft overshot the runway and slid into the Etobicoke creek banks. In 1954, heavy flooding resulted in some homes along the riverbank being swept into the lake after heavy rains from Hurricane Hazel. Since that storm, houses are no longer constructed along this floodplain. This creek and its tributaries are administered by the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA). Most land in Mississauga drains to either of the two main river systems, with the exception of the smaller Mary Fix and Cooksville creeks which run roughly through the centre of Mississauga, entering the lake east of Hurontario St. Some small streams and reservoirs are part of the Sixteen Mile Creek system in the far northwest corner of the city, but these drain toward the lake in neighbouring Milton and Oakville. The shoreline of former Glacial Lake Iroquois roughly follows the Dundas Street alignment. It is not noticeable in most places but is very prominent in the vicinity of the Dundas Street and Mavis Road intersection, where the ancient shoreline drops below, affording a clear view of downtown Toronto and Lake Ontario on clear days from the ridge. The land in Mississauga in general slopes gradually downward from almost 190 metres (623 ft) above sea level in some northern spots to Lake Ontario (76 m/249 ft ASL), a 110-metre (361 ft) difference over an averaged 15 kilometres (9 mi) distance. Apart from the Credit River valley and Iroquois shoreline, the only noticeable hills in Mississauga are actually part of the former Britannia Landfill near Britannia Road and Terry Fox Way. Neighbourhoods As defined by the Canadian census, the following areas are neighbourhoods in Mississauga. * Applewood * Central Erin Mills * Churchill Meadows * City Centre * Clarkson-Lorne Park * Cooksville * Creditview * Dixie * East Credit * Erin Mills * Erindale * Fairview * Hurontario * Lakeview * Lisgar * Malton * Meadowvale * Meadowvale Village * Mineola * Mississauga Valleys * Port Credit * Rathwood * Sheridan * Streetsville Climate The climate of Mississauga is officially represented by Pearson International Airport but conditions can differ depending on location: fog tends to be more common along the lakeshore and in the Credit River Valley at certain times of year, particularly during the autumn. The southwestern side of the city (Clarkson) is usually significantly milder in winter and also on summer nights than northern areas which include the airport, while lakeshore areas particularly from Port Credit east through Lakeview are cooler on hot summer days and it can be noticeably cooler on sunny spring days when there is a lake breeze. During snowfalls when temperatures hover close to freezing, northern parts of the city, such as around Derry Road away from warmer Lake Ontario, tend to get more snow than the southern parts because of colder temperatures. The reverse occurs when a strong storm approaches from the south kicking up lake effect snow, bringing higher snowfall totals to south Mississauga. Summer thunderstorms are common, most are not severe but can occasionally bring violent winds.

Weston was the son of Edward Weston of Hackney. He matriculated at Corpus Christi, Cambridge in 1639, and migrated to Jesus College, Cambridge on 6 September 1641, but left without taking a degree. He was admitted to Gray's Inn on 10 August 1642, and was called to the bar in 1649. In April1660, Weston was elected Member of Parliament for Weobley in the Convention Parliament. However the election declared void on 16 July 1660 on the grounds that the Sheriff had failed to send a precept and had not given due notice of the time.History of Parliament Online - Weston, Richard By 1662, Weston's arguments in court had attracted attention and were noticed by Thomas Raymond in his Reports of Cases. Weston was made Lent reader at Gray's Inn in 1676, Serjeant-at-law on 23 Oct. 1677, and became King's Serjeant on 5 February 1678. He was knighted at the same time. He was judge in several important trials between 1678 and 1680. On 7 February 1680 he was made Puisne Baron of the Exchequer. In the midsummer assizes at Kingston in 1680 he checked George Jeffreys for browbeating the other side in their examination of witnesses, and so made an implacable enemy for himself. Also in 1680, he granted a habeas corpus to Sheridan, whom the House of Commons had committed, when some of the judges held back from so doing. In December 1680 the commons voted an impeachment against him based on some expressions he used in his charge to the jury at Kingston. In speaking of the theologians Calvin and Zwinglius he said ‚ÄòNow they were amusing us with fears, and nothing would serve them but a parliament .... for my part I know no representative of the nation but the king.‚Äô The crime with which he was charged was that his words were ‚Äòscandalous to the reformation, and tending to raise discord.‚Äô Parliament was dissolved before the impeachment was brought in and he died before the next parliament proceeded to the business. Weston died in Chancery Lane and was buried at Hackney on 26 March 1681. Weston married Frances Manwood, daughter of Sir George Marwood of Little Buskby.

The Arch springs from the Western Wall and is still visible underneath later buildings set against the Wall. The name Wilson's Arch is also used to denote the hall that it partially covers, which is currently used as a synagogue. This hall opens towards the Western Wall Plaza at the Plaza's northeast corner, so that it appears on the left of the prayer section of the Western Wall to visitors facing the Wall. The Arch once spanned , supporting a bridge that carried both a street and an aqueduct. The bridge allowed access to a gate that was level with the surface of the Temple Mount during the late Second Temple period. Name Wilson's 1865 Ordnance Survey of Jerusalem marks \\"Wilson's Arch\\" at the top of this site plan In the description of the survey he made at the site, Charles Wilson wrote about \\"[t]he arch, which Sir Henry James has called after my name. Location The Arch is located below the Street of the Chain leading to the Chain Gate of the Haram esh-Sharif. It connects to the Western Wall to the east and can be accessed by men from the Western Wall Plaza and by women from inside adjacent buildings. Purpose Wilson's Arch was built as part of a bridge described by Josephus that connected the Temple Mount to the Upper City on the Western Hill; it carried a road as well as the last section of an aqueduct bringing water from Solomon's Pools near Bethlehem to the Temple Mount. Date A distinction must be made between the remains of the first arch of the bridge, known as Wilson's Arch, and those of the rest of the bridge and possible later additions to it. =Absolute date= Excavations between 2015 and 2019 collected organic material in the mortar used during various stages of construction. Radiocarbon dating indicated that the initial bridge to the Temple Mount was completed between 20 BCE and 20 CE, and a doubling in width occurred between 30 CE and 60 CE. The 2020 study concluded that Wilson's Arch was initiated by Herod the Great, and enlarged during the Roman Procurators, such as Pontius Pilate, in a range of 70 years. =Structural correlations and relative date= Stinespring argued already in the 1960s that the Arch is still preserved in his original Herodian form, based on the way it is bonded to the retaining wall of the Temple Mount, which indicates that it is \\"a definitive part of the ancient Temple structure.\\" The fact that Roman theater-like structure which was discovered right underneath the arch was never finished, due to the outbreak of the Bar Kokhba Revolt or the death of the Emperor Hadrian in 138 CE, gives the terminus ante quem the Arch was built. The oldest of the pools beneath the arch was dated to 1305‚Äì1340 CE. =Alternative theory: Umayyad date= There are scholars who have favored dating the Arch's construction to the Umayyad period (651‚Äì750), basing their conclusions on what they see as evidence from the period of excavation after the Six-Day War, when Israel's Ministry of Religious Affairs began to excavate the area of the Western Wall still unexposed, and dig a tunnel beneath the existing structures above. During much of the time of these excavations, which went on between 1968‚Äì82 and was restarted in 1985, the Israel Antiquities Authority's (IAA) District Archeologist for Jerusalem was Dan Bahat, who became the archaeologist of the site after resigning from IAA. In his book, Jerusalem Down Under: Tunneling Along Herod's Temple Mount Wall, he writes that the evidence found was enough to convince him that despite earlier beliefs that the Arch was built during Herod's time, the later dating is correct. It is believed by those who date the current arch to the later period, that it was a replacement for an earlier arch erected during the Second Temple period, and that the Umayyads didn't just restore the retaining walls surrounding the Mount, but also rebuilt the arches of the \\"Great Bridge\\". Dimensions The Arch was measured by Wilson, who noted that its crown reaches a height of above bedrock, its span being of . Only a portion of the Arch is visible today. A square shaft cut down under the arch allows sighting of the wall's original massive foundations, \\"with fourteen courses of dressed stone below the present ground level.\\"Wilson's Arch, Madain Project, accessed 1 July 2020 The exact dimensions of the Second Temple period bridge which stood over the arch are impossible to determine. Discovery and excavation Wilson's 1871 diagram Sketch of Wilson's discovery Titus Tobler noted the structure and wrote in 1853 that \\"I regard the vaults as supporting arches for the path or bridge that leads from Suk Bab es-Sinsleh to Bab es- Sinsleh\\". The arch was scientifically documented for the first time in 1865 by explorer and surveyor Charles Wilson, for whom it was named. Wilson had joined the Ordnance Survey of Jerusalem in 1864, continuing to participate in the city surveying project that was established to improve the city's water system. Not long after Wilson, Charles Warren excavated under the arch by digging two trial shafts, one along the western pier all the way down to bedrock. He published his discoveries in 1876. In 1968, only a few months after the Six-Day War, Israel began excavations to uncover the portion of the Western Wall that was not exposed.Avrahami, Avner, \\"The Eternal Rock for NIS 18,\\" Haaretz, July 26, 2004, retrieved March 21, 2011 As the excavations continued, the opening to the arch was uncovered, and rubble began to be removed. It would take 17 years, until 1985, until the entire length of the wall would be cleared. The space under the arch was fitted out after 1967 as a synagogue, with a new floor built over the floor of a large Mamluk-Ottoman water reservoir, called by Warren 'Pool Al Burak'. The presence of the synagogue restricted further excavation under Wilson's Arch to a large degree, with limited digs being carried out in 2006 and 2011, followed by a substantial dig between 2015-18 over a 200 m¬≥ total area. This large project focused on dating the arch and, after exposing a theatre-like structure directly beneath it, the date and function of this unexpected finding. Associated structures =Herodian \\"Western Stone\\"= The Western Stone, located in the north section of the Arch, is a monolithic stone block forming part of the lower level of the Western Wall. Weighing 570 tonnes (628 tons), it is one of the largest building blocks in the world. The stone is 13.6 meters (44.6 ft) long, 4.5 meters (15 ft) wide and has an estimated height of 3.5 meters (11.5 ft). It is considered to be one of the heaviest objects ever lifted by human beings without powered machines. It is the largest building stone found in Israel and second in the world. It is only partially intact, the rest was destroyed in 70 CE during the Roman siege of Jerusalem.Bahat, Dan, Touching the stones of our heritage: the Western Wall tunnels p. 85, Western Wall Heritage Foundation, 2002 =Roman theater-like structure= A small Roman theater-like structure was discovered just underneath the Arch. The theater was never finished, this being possibly the result of the Bar Kokhba Revolt or the death of Emperor Hadrian (r. 117‚Äì138). =Mamluk-Ottoman \\"Al-Buraq\\" Pool= The modern synagogue under the arch covers the Mamluk- Ottoman cistern known in the time of Wilson and Warren as the 'Pool Al Burak'. =Makhkama building= Over the prayer hall area partially covered by the Arch is the large building known as the \\"Makhkama\\" (\\"Court House\\") or \\"Tankiziah,\\" that includes a porch looking over the Temple Mount.

Early years Born in October 27, 1935 in Iowa, Clark and his family moved to Nashville Tennessee in 1942. He was interested in music early in life, and later received a scholarship to Vanderbilt University to begin a medical career, which he abandoned due to the extreme hours required and the worsening of an unknown illness. Clark was apprenticed in aerodynamics with Avco Aviation where his father was the Vice President of Avco and his father-in-law was also a machinist. Clark had been training as an engineer for Avco before he became ill with urological issues and decided that transportation design would be a better fit for his health. Joining Sears, Clark turned to art and advertising, teaching himself using the art course offered by mail. Automobile design Spurred by a love of cars, engineering and art, Clark sent some of his drawings to Chrysler Corporation, and received a letter from them that told him to choose an auto design school, complete the course (with honors) and then come back to them. Two schools were recommended: Pratt in New York, or the Art Center School of Design in Los Angeles. Clark graduated with honors as a designer and stylist from the Art Center School of Design with a double major in Art Transportation and Design.\\"The Ford Mustang I.\\" Consumer Guide, undated (the updated version that includes Clark), p. 3.

Retrieved: December 3, 2016. After being released from GM in March 1962, Clark joined Ford in late- April 1962 to work on special projects.Leffingwell 2003, p. 15. Clark's important design role was in creating the mid-engine designs for the Mustang I concept car that later made it up to the executives and met their approval. Clark had been conceptualizing the Mustang design in varied forms for years before the final car was produced. His drawing of the Mustang Coupe, or Fastback can be seen signed by him, in the Spring 1963 MotorBook Magazine. The Mustang name was kept under wraps with the code name \\"Allegro\\" assigned to the entire project. Allegro was a musical term and Clark and all of the designers he worked with were involved with various musical instruments. This gave the young group who originally were with GM a way to speak about the Mustang project in a code that no one to this day can decipher except for the original designers.Leffingwell 2003, p. 43. After traveling from his hometown in Nashville, Tennessee to the Art School of Design in Pasadena, California where he passed the wild mustangs in Nevada and was captivated by their beauty, Clark suggested the Mustang name to Ford executives. After public relations and the legal department vetted the project name (they particularly liked the connection to the wild horse of the same name), the name continued onto the Mustang II show car and later was applied to the production version of the Ford Mustang. The final decision on the name was left up to Lee Iacocca, the vice-president and general manager of the Ford Motor Company. Leffingwell 2003, p. 64. Clark also designed the Ford Capri, a fact which until recently was unknown. =Later work= Clark's designs continued to evolve and were influential in other Fords, including the GT-40 race car and its derivatives. Other designs were incorporated in Ford Europe products including the Ford Cortina. Clark died at 32 from an ulcer, but to this day is best known for his design of the Mustang \\"running horse\\" emblem.

A crusade against Sultan Mehmed II had been planned by Pope Pius II with Skanderbeg as one of its main leaders. The battle near Ohrid occurred as a result of an Albanian incursion into Ottoman territory. The Ottomans stationed in the area were assaulted by Skanderbeg's men and 1,000 Venetian soldiers under Cimarosto. The Ottomans were lured out of their protections in Ohrid and ambushed by the Albanian cavalry. Skanderbeg won the resulting battle and his men earned 40,000 ducats after captured Ottoman officers were ransomed. Pius II died before the planned crusade began, however, forcing Skanderbeg to fight his battles virtually alone. Background Pope Pius II's crusade against the Ottoman Empire was declared in November 1463. Skanderbeg, the leader of the Albanians, was a vital ally to this effort and would have become one of its main leaders.Hodgkinson p. 190. The Venetians, who had also joined the crusade, could not persuade Lek√´ Dukagjini, Skanderbeg's lukewarm ally in northern Albania, to join until the pope intervened. Furthermore, the major European powers were reluctant to join the pope's crusade. Among those inquired were the city of Florence, Francisco Sforza of Milan, Louis XI of France, and Ferdinand I of Naples, all of whom declined for their own reasons.Hodgkinson p. 191. The Republic of Venice, however, decided to aid Skanderbeg by sending 500 cavalry and 500 infantry under the condottiero Antonio da Cosenza, also known as Cimarosto.Frash√´ri p. 418. Once the campaign season began, Mathias Corvinus of Hungary recaptured many of the Bosnian strongpoints, including Jajce, which had been taken from the Kingdom of Bosnia by the Ottomans. Mehmed II marched into Bosnia, pillaging the countryside, hoping that his enemies would surrender. The Hungarian resistance, however, was stiff.Hodgkinson p. 192. The Ottomans still managed to make headway against the Hungarians who had been trying to lift Ottoman the siege on Jajce with a ruse. The Sultan continued his siege while Mathias escaped from the fortress with a force of men, but the retreating army was harried with two-hundred soldiers being captured and sent to Constantinople for execution. Despite the setback, Jajce held out and Mehmed retreated from Bosnia.Hodgkinson p. 193. Campaign After Skanderbeg's raid into Macedonia the year before, the Sultan decided to strengthen his fortresses in the area. He then sent ≈ûeremet bey to Ohrid, a city close to Skanderbeg's domains, with 14,000 cavalry to prevent another Albanian incursion. After learning of this, Skanderbeg prepared to march against ≈ûeremet. The pasha's men, however, were stationed both inside and outside the city, making it difficult to defeat them. Before marching, Skanderbeg received news that Pius had arrived in Ancona and died upon seeing the crusader fleet. He left Cimarosto with an Italian force in Valikardh√´ (near modern-day Bulqiz√´ in eastern Albania). Skanderbeg then decided to march against ≈ûeremet anyway and set off with 12,000 cavalry three hours after dusk. After one day of marching, Skanderbeg reached Macedonia and began pillaging the land. =Battle= Once he reached Ohrid, Skanderbeg gave a speech to his men, encouraging them for the coming battle. He then assigned Pek√´ Emmanuali and Peter Engj√´lli, Pal Engj√´lli's brother, as commanders of a 500-man troop of cavalry where they were to approach the gates of Ohrid and provoke the Ottomans to attack. They were to throw smoke and dust into the air to irritate the garrison. Then they were to feign retreat where the pursuing Ottoman cavalry would be ambushed by the main Albanian force. On 14 or 15 September, everything went as planned and the trap was sprung. Skanderbeg's assault came out and killed 10,000 Ottoman men and captured twelve Ottoman units, among them ≈ûeremet's son. The Ottoman forces were pursued by the Venetian forces alongside the Albanians. The Albanian-Venetian losses were few. Aftermath According to legend, Skanderbeg celebrated the event by dining off letnica (Ohrid trout), a fish found in Lake Ohrid that was sent to the Byzantine emperors every Friday for their supper meal. The twelve captured officers were ransomed for 40,000 ducats. Skanderbeg distributed this amount through his force, with every man receiving his fair share.Francione p. 168.Franco p. 337. He then besieged Ohrid for a short time before returning to Albania; the Venetian Senate hailed the campaign as a victory despite not being able to take Ohrid.Frash√´ri p. 418. The crusade seemed to have gone well for the Christian side but, after Pius' death, the remaining cardinals lost their hope and handed the money raised for the crusade to the Venetians.Francione p.169 Mehmed saw Skanderbeg's vulnerability and sent Ballaban Badera, an Albanian janissary, to Albania where they met at Vaikal and he was defeated. Ballaban had replaced ≈ûeremet as the commander in Ohrid after the latter fell out of favor with the sultan.Frash√´ri p. 418. Ballaban would meet Skanderbeg several more times in battle before being mortally wounded in action at the second siege of Kruj√´.Frash√´ri p. 419.

Ffennell was the eldest son and second of sixteen children of Joshua William and Elizabeth Ffennell, was born 16 August 1799, at Ballybrado, three miles below Cahir on the River Suir. The family had been members of the Society of Friends almost from the time of George Fox, but Ffennell's father, a hospitable country gentleman, was excluded from the society on account of undue conformity to the world. William Joshua resented this sentence (which was afterwards reversed), and with his five brothers joined the established church. He had a desultory education, and spent much time in hunting, shooting, and fishing. He became especially expert in angling for salmon; and his attention was drawn to the decay of the fishing in the Suir and other rivers. Career In 1824 Ffennell took a lease of Carrigataha, which adjoins Ballybrado on the Suir. After carefully studying the habits of the fish and making himself acquainted with the old acts of parliament, he endeavoured to rouse public attention, with a view to legislative reform. He had difficulties with the poachers in the upper waters, and with the proprietors of the \\"stake weirs\\" in the tideway. An act passed in 1826 had forbidden the constabulary to interfere for the protection of salmon. In 1834 he was appointed to the commission of the peace, and by firmness and tact obtained the full confidence of the people in spite of his tory politics. He thus managed to improve the state of the Suir and to obtain the support of public opinion. In 1837 a petition upon the Irish fisheries was presented to parliament by the Earl of Glengall, a friend and neighbour of Ffennell, who spoke upon the subject in the House of Lords (19 June). Lord Glengall and Ffennell became chairman and secretary of the Suir Preservation Society, founded in the same year. It was due to their exertions that an act was passed in 1842, embodying many of Ffennell's proposals, but unfortunately giving privileges to the stake weirs, which long hindered the development of the fishery. In 1844 an act was passed authorising police protection for the rivers; and in 1845 another salmon act was passed, and Ffennell was appointed fishery inspector under the board of works. His office included the inspection of sea fisheries, and during the Potato Famine he visited Scotland, examined the process of fish-curing, and tried to introduce it among the starving population of the west coast of Ireland. In 1848 the act commonly called \\"Ffennell's Act\\" was passed. This is the initial act of modern salmon legislation, which provides funds and machinery for carrying the law into practice, by making the local administration of the salmon acts self-supporting. He now became a commissioner at the Office of Public Works for the superintendence of the newly formed fishery districts. In 1853 he exhibited working models of salmon passes at the Dublin exhibition of that year, which attracted general attention. His advice was frequently sought in England and Scotland; and in 1860 he was appointed one of the royal commissioners to examine the salmon fisheries of England and Wales. Their report led to an act passed in 1861, under which Ffennell was appointed inspector of salmon fisheries for England and Wales. In 1862 he was appointed commissioner of fisheries for Scotland. Salmon Act In 1863 a salmon act for Ireland was passed, which at last got rid of the stake weirs. A pamphlet written by him contributed to securing this measure. A similar act was passed for England in 1865. In 1866 he started Land and Water, in conjunction with his friend Francis T. Buckland, with a special eye to the fisheries. He died in London 12 March 1867. His chief power lay in his practical knowledge of the salmon fishery question in its minutest details, and his singularly clear and effective method of bringing forward the subject at public meetings.

Life Gortzius Geldorp was born in Leuven. The early Flemish biographer Karel van Mander reported that Geldorp first learned to paint from Frans Francken I and later from Frans Pourbus the Elder. Frans Pourbus the Elder was a prominent portrait painter in Flanders. Frans Francken I and Frans Pourbus the Elder were both pupils of Frans Floris, the leading Renaissance painter in Antwerp.Gortzius Geldorp in Karel van Mander's Schilderboeck, 1604 Geldorp became court painter to the Duke of Terra Nova, Carlo d'Aragona Tagliavia, whom he accompanied on his trips.

The railroad later expanded west to Farnham, Quebec and then St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec with running rights on Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) to Montreal, Quebec. CDAC was established in 1994 and operated as a railroad between 1995 and 2002. It was owned by transportation holding company Iron Road Railways. History Beginning in 1993, CP Rail (CP) announced its intention to abandon or sell its Canadian Atlantic Railway (CAR) subsidiary due to declining traffic levels. In early January 1995 the eastern portion of the CAR mainline from Saint John, New Brunswick to Brownville Junction, Maine was sold to industrial conglomerate J.D. Irving Limited (JDI) which created the New Brunswick Southern Railway (NBS) and Eastern Maine Railway (EMR) as subsidiaries. Owning this section gave JDI access to interchange points with CN Rail (CN) at Saint John, New Brunswick, Guilford Rail System at Mattawamkeag, Maine, and Bangor & Aroostook Railroad (BAR) at Brownville Junction, ME. Also in early January 1995, the western portion of the CAR mainline from Brownville Junction to Lennoxville, Quebec saw operation transferred to the Canadian American Railroad (CDAC) which was a joint venture of Iron Road Railways and Fieldcrest Cannon Inc. established in mid-1994. In March 1995, CDAC completed purchase of this portion of the CAR mainline from CP; at that time, Iron Road Railways bought out the interest of Fieldcrest Cannon to assume complete control. Also in March 1995, Iron Road Railways purchased the BAR, creating a T-shaped system focused on the interchange point at Brownville Junction. Iron Road Railways also entered into an agreement with J.D. Irving to market the entire line from Lennoxville to Saint John, however EMR and NBSR remained the operator for the line east of Brownville Junction. CDAC 454 leading an Iowa Northern Railway train at Cedar Rapids, Iowa For the remainder of the 1990s, CDAC was able to dramatically increase the amount of freight traffic handled from what CP had carried, largely due to aggressive marketing and customized service, particularly for the forestry industry. After several years CDAC operations extended west from Lennoxville to a junction in Farnham, Quebec after Iron Road Railways purchased a former CP route in northern Vermont. CDAC trains also handled traffic from BAR and intermodal traffic from Saint John. The growth of intermodal traffic saw CDAC receive trackage rights over CP from Farnham to Montreal where trains terminated at Cote St. Luc Yard. CDAC's physical plant suffered due to deferred maintenance, as the holding company Iron Road Railways encountered financial difficulties by the early 2000s. Plans to improve infrastructure for Brownville Junction to Farnham during 1999 never stalled: CDAC and BAR and its affiliates filed for bankruptcy in 2001. On 8 October 2002, the Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway (MMA) acquired all of the assets of Iron Road Railways' operations in Maine, Quebec, and Vermont including CDAC and BAR.

It is also home to the Cowbeech Bonfire Society, a Charitable Trust which organises a series of events each year to raise funds for local causes. These events include, among others, the village show (called Dig for Victory) and a pantomime in addition to the annual bonfire which gives the Society its name.  History  The name Cowbeech was first recorded in 1261 as Coppetebeche, referring to a ‚Äòcapped‚Äô or pollarded beech tree, also recorded as Kopped(e)beche in 1296 and 1316. This was then shortened over the years to Coppebeche (recorded in 1517 and 1534), Cobbeach (recorded in 1622) and then to Cobeech (recorded in 1724), before taking its contemporary form of Cowbeech. The village was once a site of Wealden iron production. Cowbeech Forge (otherwise known as Crawle or Cralle Forge) stood alongside Hammer Lane, close to where it intersects with the Cuckmere River and produced iron between 1559 and 1693. In 1653 the forge was casting shot for the Office of Ordnance. Before 1826, when the village pub was renamed The Merry Harriers, it was known at different times as The Old House or The Cow.

Closed in 1981 it is now a dormitory building for the London branch of the University of Notre Dame.  History  The hospital was founded by Dr John Bunnell Davis in 1816 as the Universal Dispensary for Children. In this first incarnation the hospital was located at St Andrew's Hill, in the now demolished Doctors' Commons in the City of London. The name of the hospital was changed to the Royal Universal Dispensary for Children in 1821 and, after a foundation stone was laid by the Duke of York for new premises near Waterloo Bridge in 1823, it moved into the new premises in 1824. It became the Royal Universal Infirmary for Children in 1824, the Royal Infirmary for Children in 1843 and the Royal Infirmary for Children and Women in 1852. In an 1856 review of the hospital system in London, the British Journal of Homeopathy noted the serious shortage of hospital beds for children in London: ::Again, London possesses but one hospital (Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street), where sick children are received, containing the insignificant number of 30 beds. Paris has a large hospital (Enfants Malades), containing 600 beds for sick children. The Royal Infirmary for Children, Waterloo Bridge Road, is said to be capable, with a few alterations, of containing 80 beds; but we have no reason to suppose that it does yet contain any; and as its funds are stated to be very limited, there seems small hopes of its taking in sick children for the present. The hospital underwent a further name change to the Royal Hospital for Children and Women in 1875. The new hospital was opened by Princess Louise in 1877, with one ward renamed the Louise Ward in her honour. Between 1903 and 1904 premises were built at a cost of ¬£45,000 to house an outpatients' department and inpatient accommodation of 90 beds at the corner of Waterloo Bridge Road and Stamford Street near Waterloo station. By the year of the hospital's rebuilding in 1903 the concerns over bed space remained: an article in the British Medical Journal raised the concern that the Waterloo site left little room for extension. It became the Royal Waterloo Hospital for Children and Women at that time. The hospital joined the National Health Service in 1948 as part of the nearby St Thomas' Hospital group of hospitals (now Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust). The Royal Waterloo Hospital closed on 27 July 1976. The building was awarded Grade II listed status by English Heritage in 1980. In 1981 it was sold and for the next three decades was the central London campus of Schiller International University. In 2011, Schiller International University moved out of the building and sold it to University of Notre Dame of South Bend, Indiana, USA where it was renovated and converted into dormitories.

Long divorced but still a team, they need a new project and meet playwright Stanley Krown, who has written one in which the lead roles are a mother and a 19-year-old daughter. Beatrice wants to play the daughter. She can't pass for 19 but believes she can for 29, so wants the play rewritten. She also displays a romantic interest in Stanley. A young actress first calling herself Sally Carver and then Peggy Pruitt wants an audition. Stanley has her do some typing on his rewrite, and a jealous Beatrice finds her an acting job out of town. Stanley's play previews in Washington, D.C., and flops. Sally, now calling herself Claudia Souvain, tries to persuade Stanley that the actress is too old for the role. Seeing the play in a small town with Sally in the lead, now under her real name of Clara Mootz, convinces Stanley that she is right. Beatrice finally concedes that it's time for her to act her age. She agrees to take the mother's part, and on Broadway the play is a huge success. Cast *Ginger Rogers as Beatrice Page *William Holden as Stanley Krown *Paul Douglas as E.

Its genre has been characterized as a \\"medical melodrama\\" with a film noir \\"bad girl\\". Plot Army colonel and doctor Tom Owen (Charlton Heston) returns home to Coalville, Pennsylvania, on leave. He learns from wealthy mine owner Dan Reasonover that his brother Floyd, a mine safety engineer, has been killed in an explosion. He further discovers that Floyd had betrayed Dan's trust by purchasing substandard equipment and taking kickbacks. Tom discovers that Floyd was also heavily in debt at the time. Tom wants to pay Dan back, but Dan declines his offer. Dan's daughter, the twice-divorced socialite Helen Curtis (Lizabeth Scott), meets Tom at a party and asks him for a date. She arranges for him to meet Dr. Homer Gleeson (Lester Matthews), who runs a fancy Pittsburgh clinic catering to wealthy women suffering from minor ailments (some of which are plainly imaginary). Gleeson informs Tom that his former associate has quit to open his own practice, so he offers Tom the vacancy. Knowing that Tom has vowed to pay his late brother's debts, Helen talks him into accepting. Tom appears reluctant at first but eventually turns down the security his army career offers and accepts Gleeson's job. This disappoints Tom's mother who had hoped he would return to Coalville where he could do some genuine good. Tom informs her that he's doing this for the money. As a nurse to assist him, Tom hires Joan Lasher (Dianne Foster), an attractive and idealistic young woman who plans to become a doctor herself. Meanwhile Tom and Helen begin dating. Tom proposes marriage and Helen accepts. Dan attempts to intervene and dissuade Tom from proceeding with the marriage. He warns Tom that Helen's wealth poisoned her first two marriages, but Tom remains adamant that this won't happen. Lasher becomes disappointed that Tom treats wealthy society patients for minor ailments when he could be doing more good elsewhere. Dr. Jim Crowley (Arthur Franz), a former sergeant in Tom's squad approaches Tom for help. He's trying to secure a position as a doctor. Tom half-heartedly offers to help Jim who goes to leave. On the way out he bumps into Joan who informs him that Tom is a good doctor and wouldn't have offered unless he meant to follow through. Jim explains that he only returned to the medical field after witnessing Tom in action in the war. Tom had inspired him to give medicine another chance and to treat the truly needy. Joan confronts Tom and explains Jim's inspirational story and Tom agrees to sends Jim to see Dr. Lester Scobee (Rhys Williams, who cares for the miners of Coalville and their families. Jim is hired and starts to see more and more cases of men from the mine developing lung conditions. He approaches Tom with some X-rays. Before Tom can review the X-rays, he gets a call from Helen who is with her aunt who has become ill. Tom rushes out and after examining Helen's rich and influential aunt, Mrs. Roger Nelson (Marjorie Rambeau), discovers that she is extremely ill and in dire need of emergency surgery. Mrs Nelson insists on not proceeding until she sees her personal physician Dr Gleeson. Tom explains to Gleeson that the surgery is required and Gleeson admits that he is not equipped to perform surgery and that he actually hasn't performed any surgery in over 10 years. Instead, his former partner had been the surgeon. Tom performs the surgery successfully saving Mrs Nelson and Gleeson urges Tom to allow him to take credit. Later Joan upbraids Tom for his unethical behavior and quits the surgery. Gleeson decides to charge Mrs. Nelson an exorbitant fee, which he splits with Tom. Mrs. Nelson later learns that it was Tom who performed her operation and questions his ethics. Before Tom can defend himself, he is called away to help at a mine explosion at Coalville. Tom enters the mine and joins Jim treating and rescuing miners far underground. They rescue the miners, but Jim is fatally injured. Tom tells Helen he is quitting the Pittsburgh clinic to work in Coalville. Helen tells him she cannot live there, so they reluctantly part. Tom arrives at his new office to find Joan already at work.

It mirrored the plot of the 1938 British film The Citadel closely enough for one reference work to call it \\"the poor man's version\\" of that film.Films in Review, vol. 37 (1986), 398 The film's trailer promoted it as an expos√© of \\"ghost surgeons\\" in the contemporary medical profession, the practice of a doctor misrepresenting himself to a patient and taking credit for surgery performed by someone else. The practice was a topic much discussed and condemned at the time. The American College of Surgeons condemned the practice in 1951. Reception Writing in The New York Times, Howard Thompson called the film \\"erratic\\" and recapped its plot as a \\"romanticized endorsement of the Hippocratic Oath, as opposed to cash in the bank\\". He nevertheless allowed that the film had merits: \\"the lacquered, carefully engineered proceedings have their persuasive aspects\\". He singled out \\"bits and snatches\\" of the dialogue and the acting of all but the two leads. He preferred the plot of the doctor's career choice dilemma to the romance of the title: \\"The hero's liaison with the tippling, muddle-headed Miss Scott takes up a good, pointless third of the footage.\\" TV Guide calls it a \\"real bore\\" that \\"may be dangerous to your health\\", says Heston \\"has never been stiffer or more self-righteous\\", but that \\"[s]ome excellent character actors are totally wasted in this film\\". Others have complained that the film's title misrepresents it.Halliwell's Film Guide 2008 (HarperCollins UK, 2008) Turner Classic Movies calls it \\"obscure and forgotten\\".

The club also has an amateur men's side, Jersey Reds Athletic, who play in the Zoo Shield, and Jersey Reds Women, who play in the Women's National Championship South 2 league. For the first season of leagues in England in 1987/88, Jersey were in London Three South-West (level 7), and didn't play any higher until promotion in 2005. Two professional players were signed in 2006 and gradually the club's 1st XV shifted towards full-time professionalism, which was introduced in 2013. By this time Jersey had been promoted four more times to reach, by 2012, the second level of the English pyramid, playing in the Greene King IPA Championship. During this period Jersey contested the knock-out competition for the four winners of the regional leagues at level 5 in 2009/10, defeating Taunton in the semi-final and then Ampthill in the final at Twickenham. The team was known as the Jersey Rugby Football Club until the start of the 2016‚Äì17 season, when they changed their name to the Jersey Reds. History Rugby has been played in Jersey since 1879 with breaks for war and the Nazi occupation, but the modern era started when the club acquired the land for a permanent home in Saint Peter near Jersey Airport in 1961; the original wooden clubhouse was built in 1964, its approximate location was in the middle of the Jersey Bowl carpark. From the early 1970s, when tourism in the island was at its peak, Jersey attracted many of rugby's top clubs who could combine a break from their regular fixtures with a game against the JRFC. This period culminated with a very successful Centenary year in 1979, teams with international players came over to play and help celebrate this event, including JPR Williams. This decade left the club with an unequalled collection of plaques and memorabilia, with teams coming from England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, South Africa, Australia (the beachguard connection) and the Netherlands. Jersey vs. Barking at St. Peter, 5 November 2011 The current clubhouse was opened in September 1994 and corresponded approximately with the start of the leagues; by then Jersey could not rely on random visiting sides and had to join the league in Hampshire. In the summer of 2010 the new Lord Jersey Stand was built between the 1st XV pitch and the Airport Road and the Pavilion, with kitchen and bar, to the east of the main club facilities. This was to provide amenities for the increasing number of spectators due to the further success of the 1st XV. The last few years have seen the first team work its way up the National Leagues, winning the overall National League 3 in 2010 and progressing to National League 2 South. In 2011, Jersey were promoted to National League 1 through a play-off game at home to Loughborough Students. The club's kit is red with black shorts and socks and the away shirts are blue with black shorts and socks. During their first season in National League 1 Jersey suffered a narrow defeat in their first game against Fylde and also lost their first home game in two and a half years against Ealing. They were also docked 5 points for fielding too many foreign players in their defeat to Cinderford. Despite these setbacks Jersey bounced back winning 11 games in a row and ended 2011 second in the National League 1 table, only 1 point behind Ealing.

Elliott, 616 A.2d 210 (Vt. 1992), is a decision of the Vermont Supreme Court holding that all aboriginal title in Vermont was extinguished \\"by the increasing weight of history.\\"State v. Elliott, 616 A.2d 210, 218 (Vt. 1992) (\\"The legal standard does not require that extinguishment spring full blown from a single telling event. Extinguishment may be established by the increasing weight of history.\\"). The Vermont Supreme Court has clarified that its holding in Elliott applies to the entire state.State v. Cameron, 658 A.2d 939, 940 (Vt. 1995) (\\"Our holding in that case was made as a matter of law based on historical fact. Consequently, under the doctrine of stare decisis, Elliott is precedent binding in general, not just binding on parties to the original case. . . . Elliott affects all lands within Vermont's boundaries.\\"). Background In 1987, the land claim became an issue in the Abenaki chief election between Homer St. Francis and Lester Lampman. Lampman advocated that the tribe take a more aggressive stance in pushing its claim to \\"all of Vermont as well as parts of New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Maine.\\"UPI, Indians fight for control of tribe, September 4, 1987. St. Francis won the election. On October 18, 1987, St. Francis organized a \\"fish-in\\" with 35 other tribal members on the Missisquoi River, conducted without licenses from the state. Just prior to the district court's decision, Chief St. Francis withdrew the tribe's petition for federal recognition, saying: \\"We don't need a Government we don't recognize to tell us we exist.\\" Prior history The case arose in the aftermath two Vermont District Court decisions. =State v. Saint Francis (1989)= In State v. Saint Francis, on August 14, 1989, Judge Joseph J. Wolchik of the Vermont District Court in Franklin County, in a 96-page decision,State v. Saint Francis, No. 1171-10-86Fcr (Vt. Dist. Ct. Aug. 11, 1989). held that the Abenaki were a tribe, retained aboriginal rights to hunt and fish, and therefore did not need to acquire fishing licenses from the state.New York Times, Indians in Vermont Tribe Need No Licenses to Fish, Judge Rules, August 15, 1989, at A19. Judge Wolchik held that the Abenaki's aboriginal area consisted of 500,000 acres in northwestern Vermont: Grand Isle County, most of Franklin County, and some of Chittenden and Orleans counties. Wolchik dismissed the charges against all but six of the defendants; he held that the remaining six were not tribal members. In the aftermath of the decision, Chief St. Francis vowed to file a land claim \\"as soon as possible.\\" By then, St. Francis estimated the tribe's claim area as \\"all of Vermont, all of New Hampshire, and parts of northern Massachusetts, western Maine, upstate New York and southern Quebec.\\"Boston Globe, Tribe to claim one-third of New England, August 10, 1990, at M1.Union Leader (Manchester, NH), Abenakis Say They Own NH, Vt., Plan To File Suit To Regain Land, August 11, 1990, at 1. By September 12, 1990, several title insurance companies in Vermont attempted to amend their standard policy contracts (an action that requires approval from the state banking department) to exclude a potential Abenaki claim from coverage.Union Leader (Manchester, NH), Native Claims Cloud Vt. Title Insurance, September 12, 1990. =State v. Bellevue (1990)= In State v. Bellevue, on August 13, 1990, in another fishing rights case, Judge Edward Cashman of the Vermont District Court in Franklin County held that the Abenaki were not exempt from state criminal jurisdiction.State v. Bellevue, No. 1862-11-89Fcr (Vt. Dist. Ct. Aug. 13, 1990). Judge Cashman, unlike Judge Wolchik, held neither tribal status nor aboriginal fishing rights could exist in the absence of a federal treaty. Opinion The Vermont Supreme Court reversed and remanded Judge Wolchik's decision. The opinion's main legal innovation was holding that \\"[a]n historical event, although insufficient by itself to establish an extinguishment, may contribute to a finding of extinguishment when analyzed together with other events\\" and that \\"a century- long course of conduct may demonstrate extinguishment, even though the exact date on which Indian title is extinguished is difficult to determine.\\"616 A.2d at 213-14. The court concluded that \\"a series of historical events, beginning with the Wentworth Grants of 1763, and ending with Vermont's admission to the Union in 1791, extinguished the aboriginal rights claimed here.\\"616 A.2d at 214. Reception Legal commentary on the Elliott decision has been generally negative. According to Joseph William Singer, a professor at Harvard Law School: > [I]t defies both precedent and the longstanding policy of protecting Indian > title to conclude that Congress, by the simple admission of Vermont to the > Union, casually obliterated all Abenaki title in the State of Vermont, > whether currently settled by non-Indians or inhabited by Abenakis.Singer, 28 > Ga. L. Rev. at 519. Gene Bergman wrote in the American Indian Law Review: > Elliot misinterprets Abenaki/Vermont history during the period from 1763 to > 1791. An honest account of history would not have found extinguishment under > the traditional rules. Hence, to avoid this conclusion, the Vermont Court > created a radical new test that undermines the United States Supreme Court's > rules and purposes protecting aboriginal title. . . . > Essentially, the court changed the test from an examination of > intent/purpose to a review of cumulative effects.

The functional result of Elliot is that courts will weigh > the cumulative effects of a sovereign's action over a long time‚Äîsay, 200 > years. This removes the barrier prohibiting the light imputing of > extinguishment. Elliot undermines the entire framework of aboriginal title > law.Bergman, 18 Am. Indian. L. Rev. at 458-59. According to John Lowndes: > This controversial decision marks a clear departure from the longstanding > aboriginal title doctrine expounded in the early nineteenth century by Chief > Justice John Marshall and the United States Supreme Court. The Vermont > court's decision not only breaks with the rule that a tribe must consent to > extinguishment of its aboriginal title, but also rejects the requirement > that the dominant sovereign must express its intent to extinguish title with > a \\"plain and unambiguous action.\\" The Vermont Supreme Court's holding that > the \\"increasing weight of history\\" alone can terminate Indian title disposes > of the rule of law, and replaces it with a selective reading of the > conqueror's history.Lowndes, 42 Buff. L. Rev. at 77. Aftermath =State recognition= Vermont extended state-recognition to the Abenaki in 2006.2006 Vt. Legis. Serv. 125 (West) (codified as amended at Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 1, ¬ß¬ß 851-853). The original recognition act provided: > This chapter shall not be construed to recognize, create, extend, or form > the basis of any right or claim to land or real estate in Vermont for the > Abenaki people or any Abenaki individual and shall be construed to confer > only those rights specifically described in this chapter.2006 Vt. Legis. > Serv. 125 (West) (codified at Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 1, ¬ß 853(c) (amended > 2010)).

Legis. Serv. 107 (West) (codified at Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 1, > ¬ß 853(h)). The amendment bill also added the following language: > State-recognized Native American Indian tribes and their members will > continue to be subject to all laws of the state, and recognition shall not > be construed to create any basis or authority for tribes to establish or > promote any form of prohibited gambling activity or to claim any interest in > land or real estate in Vermont.2010 Vt. Legis. Serv. 107 (West) (codified at > Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 1, ¬ß 851(8)). =Federal recognition= The St. Francis / Sokoki Band of Abenakis of Vermont were denied federal recognition on July 2, 2007.Final Determination against Federal Acknowledgment of the St. Francis / Sokoki Band of Abenakis of Vermont, 72 Fed. Reg. 36,022 (July 2, 2007); see also Proposed Finding Against Federal Acknowledgment of the St. Francis/Sokoki Band of Abenakis of Vermont, 70 Fed. Reg. 69,776 (proposed Nov. 17, 2005). The Department of Interior determined that the Abenaki failed to satisfy four of the seven criteria for federal recognition: #that external observers identify the group as an American Indian entity on a substantially continuous basis since 1900, #that a predominant portion of the group comprises a distinct community and has existed as a community from historical times until the present, #that the group has maintained political influence or authority over its members as an autonomous entity from historical times until the present, and #that the group's membership consist of individuals who descend from a historical Indian tribe or from historical Indian tribes that combined and functioned as a single autonomous political entity.

Life George Beseb'ely was born in the village of Beseb'el (from which his surname came), near Tripoli, Lebanon, in about 1595, son of Hadj Rizqallah. He was chosen as auxiliary bishop and consecrated by Patriarch John Bawab Safrawy on July 25, 1656. After the death of Patriarch John Bawab Safrawy happened on December 23, 1656, the bishops elected as patriarch the monk George Habquq, who anyway for humility refused and escaped in a cave of the Kadisha Valley to live as an hermit. So a second election was held and on January 1, 1657 the Archbishop George Beseb'ely was elected patriarch. The new patriarch sent to Rome his credentials to obtain confirmation of the pope; but, for unknown reasons, the Holy See took the deal for long, to the point that the patriarch had to renew his instances. His election was confirmed by Pope Alexander VII on May 26, 1659, and he received the pallium on August 30, 1660.Pierre Dib: According to Eubel, the pallium was granted on August 30, 1660 George Beseb'ely used, as his predecessor, to live in a monastery subject to the strict discipline of the monks. During his patriarchate he kept good relations with the Kingdom of France, which in 1662 appointed for the first time as French Consul in Beirut a Maronite noble, Abu Nawfal of the Khazen family. This act strengthened the friendship and protection of the France towards the Maronite nation. George Beseb'ely died on April 12, 1670 because of a pestilence in the monastery of Mar Challita in Keserwan District.

In 1989, he was defeated 75 to 68 by the emergence of Christian Democratic Appeal politician Wim Deetman. On 1 July 1990, less than a year later, Dolman left the House of Representatives to become a member of the Council of State.

Dolman signed his question with their fictional Tegenpartij. * There was an interview with Dolman in the first issue of Playboy in 1983.  References  Dr. D.

The members are Nato Bardeen (Vocals, Keys, Guitar, Mandolin), James Smith (Lead Guitar, Vocals), Todd Eisenkerch (Bass, Vocals), Rory Dolan (Percussion), and Gabelani Messer (Keys, Vocals).http://www.thedrowningmen.com/bio/ Band formation Based upon the songwriting of Nathan (Nato) Bardeen, the band was formed by Bardeen, as well as close friends, Rory, James, and original bass player Jason Young, in April 2005. The unnamed group played their first show in the Fall of 2005. As the band began to pick up momentum from songwriting and shows, Jay's position at the up and coming clothing company Brixton called for most of his daily attention. Shortly after, Jay left the band to focus on the clothing line. Todd Eisenkerch, a childhood friend of the members, and guitar player of another band Bardeen had played and sung in, The Plug Uglies, (who were now defunct) was positioned to play bass. Drummer Rory described the rehearsal where Todd was recruited: \\"Todd was hanging out with us when Jay left, we handed him a bass and said \\"looks like you're the new bass player\\". Todd obliged and has been a member since that day. Additional multi-instrumental Gabe Messer was added to the band after initial E.P. \\"Kill The Matador\\" was release, as well as their first full length record, \\"Beheading the Songbird\\", and as the band was continuing to work on various songs for their next record. Messer added additional talent as well as layers to the sound of previous songs and songs they continued to work on, primary adding the playing of various keys. Finding a name Having a handful of shows under their belt, and a number of songs for a set, the band still had no name. As the band discussed potential names, Nato always had one that stuck in his head, he mentioned it to the other members, and the band agreed that \\"The Drowning Men\\" seemed to fit perfectly (Nato credits Nick Cave's poetry book And the Ass Saw the Angel). Evolutions 2006 saw the band's first show as The Drowning Men. The show took place at the Kensington Club in Kensington, CA a small neighborhood in San Diego. The band continued playing local shows, occasionally venturing out beyond their immediate area. In 2007 the band recorded the KILL THE MATADOR EP. In 2008, while banking, Nato struck up a conversation with bank teller Ryan Morgan. During the conversation, Ryan told Nato he was a trained pianist/keyboard player. After a successful try out the band asked Ryan to join them. Already a working band with shows booked, the band moved forward, and the sound evolved through interludes, multiple harmonies, and a new dynamic. In 2010 Ryan, also college student, decided to finish his college career and resigned from the band. Seeking a replacement, the band thought of a local multi-instrumentalist named Gabe Messer. Gabe was a natural musician and he shared the same musical and local background as the members. Gabe had mixed the band a number of times as the house engineer for Hensley's Pub. Albums The band has released three albums: the 2007 EP Kill the Matador, the 2009 Pall Jenkins produced LP Beheading of the Song Bird, http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2010/jan/03/beheading-song-bird/ and in 2012 All Of The Unknown. Tours The Drowning Men opened the Green 17 2011 Tour for Moneybrother and Flogging Molly.http://www.bandsintown.com/TheDrowningMen/upcoming_events/ The band also supported Flogging Molly on 2 legs of US touring. The band opened Alkaline Trio's 15th Anniversary tour on the East Coast of the US in the Summer of 2011. The Fall/Winter of 2011 the band supported the Airborne Toxic Event. The band toured the west coast with Memphis, TN's Lucero in the Spring of 2012. The band began recording their sophomore full length with producer Billy Mohler in 2011. Together, the band and producer crafted the music that would later become the record All Of The Unknown, through March 2012. After a courting period with indie and major labels alike, The Drowning Men signed with LA indie label Borstal Beat Records. Borstal Beat re-released The Drowning Men's 2009 full length Beheading of the Songbird on October 25, 2011, followed by the band's next full length All Of The Unknown on July 17, 2012.

History The company was formed from the Electric Bond and Share Company, a holding company that sold securities of electric utilities. It was created by General Electric in 1905. Electric Bond and Share was restructured after the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, forming EBASCO Services, a provider of engineering consulting and construction services. Among other projects EBASCO designed nuclear power plants. By the 1980s, EBASCO had three divisions: EBASCO Engineering, which provided engineering design and A/E services, EBASCO Environmental, which provided environmental engineering and science services, and EBASCO Constructors, which provided construction and construction management. Ebasco (EBS) was included in Dow Jones Utility Average from 1938 to 1947.Robert J.

Goldstein was a supervisor employed by EBASCO, which was a major contractor for the construction of Houston Lighting and Power Company's South Texas Project (a complex of two nuclear power plants). In the summer of 1985, Goldstein identified safety problems to SAFETEAM, an internal compliance program established by EBASCO and Houston Lighting, including noncompliance with safety procedures, the failure to issue safety compliance reports, and quality control violations affecting the safety of the plant. SAFETEAM was promoted as an independent safe haven for employees to voice their safety concerns. The two companies did not inform their employees that they did not believe complaints reported to SAFETEAM had any legal protection. After he filed his report to SAFETEAM, Goldstein was fired. Subsequently, Golstein filed suit under federal nuclear whistleblower statutes. The U.S. Department of Labor ruled that his submissions to SAFETEAM were protected and his dismissal was invalid, a finding upheld by Labor Secretary Lynn Martin. The ruling was appealed and overturned by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled that private programs offered no protection to whistleblowers. After Goldstein lost his case, Congress amended the federal nuclear whistleblower law to provide protection reports made to internal systems and prevent retaliation against whistleblowers.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Philadelphia Phillies, from (‚Äì). De Fratus grew up in Oxnard, California and played baseball in high school prior to playing at Ventura College. The Philadelphia Phillies selected him in the 11th round of the 2007 Major League Baseball draft. De Fratus methodically moved his way up through the Phillies farm system, spending about one year at each level, from rookie to Class A, and then moving through two levels per season in and . In 2011, De Fratus made his MLB debut and, by , he was a regular member of the Phillies bullpen after a few years of splitting time between the big leagues and Triple-A. In , De Fratus used his slider to \\"dominate the league\\", and establish himself as a reliable reliever, capable of pitching in late-inning situations. De Fratus has a two-pitch repertoire that consists of a fastball and a slider, the latter of which is his out pitch. He embraces a propensity to work quickly on the mound, and use a lower arm slot. Off the field, De Fratus is a member of the Roman Catholic church, and uses baseball to strengthen his faith. He sees evangelism as a duty of Christians, and would like to go to seminary when he finishes his baseball career. Early life De Fratus attended Rio Mesa High School in Oxnard, California, from which he graduated in 2005; he was a fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers. His high school coach, David Soliz, asserted that he could pitch in the major leagues for a long time, saying, \\"He definitely has the stuff to pitch in the majors. Justin has the stuff, but he also has the confidence. The odds were against him being drafted in the 11th round out of Ventura College.\\" De Fratus was the first Rio Mesa player to reach the majors during Soliz's tenure. He went on to attend Ventura College where, like at Rio Mesa, he was a starting pitcher. Professional career =Philadelphia Phillies= On September 7, 2013, De Fratus peers at the catcher for a sign in a Phillies game The Phillies selected De Fratus with the 353rd overall pick in the 11th round of the 2007 Major League Baseball draft, and assigned him to the Gulf Coast League Phillies, the Phillies' rookie level minor league affiliate, with whom he went 2‚Äì3 with a 4.30 earned run average (ERA) in 10 games (eight starts). The next season, 2008, he advanced to the Williamsport Crosscutters, and went 6‚Äì5 with a 3.67 ERA in 14 starts. He led the New York‚ÄìPenn League in innings pitched, pitching at least six in almost 65% of his starts; the Phillies named him their minor league player of the week in mid-June. Before the 2009 season, at the decision of Phillies minor league pitching coordinator Gorman Heimueller and assistant general manager Chuck LaMar, De Fratus became predominantly a relief pitcher so he was \\"not sitting down four games out of the week\\" and could be a more focused pitcher. He took his first crack at relief pitching with the Lakewood BlueClaws, and ultimately began to flourish, earning Phillies minor league player of the week honors, and a spot in the South Atlantic League all-star game. On the season, he posted a 5‚Äì6 record with a 3.19 ERA in 36 games (though still with 12 starts). After the season, he participated in the Florida Instructional League. He had a successful 2010 season, splitting time between the High-A Clearwater Threshers and Double-A Reading Phillies, and posting a 1.94 ERA with 21 saves in 49 games. De Fratus began the 2011 season with Double-A Reading, and was promoted to Triple-A Lehigh Valley on June 16 after much success in Reading. He recorded seven saves with Lehigh Valley, and was named the Phillies minor league player of the week in late August, before making his MLB debut with the Philadelphia Phillies on September 18, 2011, after joining the team as a September callup. During his debut, an opposing batter fouled a ball off, and De Fratus's brother caught the ball. Ultimately, it was a scoreless debut, and he went on to pitch four more big-league games that season. At the end of the season, Baseball America rated him the seventh-best prospect in the Phillies' minor league system. Before 2012, like in 2011, he was given an opportunity to open the season in the Phillies bullpen, but ended up injuring his shoulder, and missing much of the season. He called the injury a \\"beat down\\" both physically and mentally, but he returned and pitched with the big-league club in September. At the conclusion of the season, he was mentally exhausted and used golf to help \\"divert\\" his attention from baseball, playing over 50 rounds in the offseason; he credited golf with helping him overcome the mental exhaustion he faced after the season, and entered 2013 in a relaxed frame of mind. By 2013, De Fratus was a regular member of the bullpen, pitching in 58 games with the big-league club; he performed well enough to be considered likely to open the 2014 season firmly implanted in the Phillies bullpen. He broke spring training 2014 with the major league team, but after four appearances, he was optioned back to the minor leagues to work on commanding his pitches, notwithstanding the Phillies' dearth of other right-handed relieving options. While at Lehigh Valley, he spent a significant amount of time reviewing film from his outings in 2011 and 2012, from which he learned that he had a faster pace when pitching, a more aggressive pitching style, and a lower arm slot. Just under a month later, in late May, he was recalled to the major league team, and had much success (11 consecutive scoreless appearances) as part of a Phillies' bullpen that drastically improved from the beginning of the season, and, statistically, was among the best in the major leagues in early June. De Fratus' drastically improved command helped him halve his career walk rate ‚Äì he walked just 5.5% of batters he faced in 2014, which contributed to a \\"breakout\\" season. Although he was overshadowed by the emergence of fellow relief pitcher Ken Giles, De Fratus established himself as a reliable late-innings reliever for the future. =Seattle Mariners= A free agent following the 2015 season, De Fratus signed a one-year contract with the Seattle Mariners on December 2.http://www.seattletimes.com/sports/mariners/mariners-add-bullpen-depth- reach-agreement-with-reliever-justin-de-fratus-on-a-one-year-contract/ He was released on March 16, 2016, and re-signed to a minor league contract the following day. =Texas Rangers= On June 11, 2016, De Fratus was traded to the Texas Rangers. =San Diego Padres= On February 28, 2017, De Fratus signed a minor league deal with the San Diego Padres.https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2017/02/minor-mlb- transactions-22817.html He was released a month later. =Southern Maryland Blue Crabs= On April 6, 2017, De Fratus signed with the Southern Maryland Blue Crabs of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. =Seattle Mariners (Second Stint)= On May 9, 2017, De Fratus signed a minor league deal with the Seattle Mariners. He elected free agency on November 6, 2017. =Los Angeles Dodgers= On February 17, 2018, De Fratus signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers. He was named to the mid-season Texas League All-Star Game as a member of the Tulsa Drillers. Overall he made 11 starts for Tulsa and 12 for the AAA Oklahoma City Dodgers, with a 7‚Äì9 record and 4.74 ERA. He became a free agent after the season ended and re- signed with the Dodgers on a minor-league deal on January 26, 2019. He again split the season between Tulsa and Oklahoma City, pitching in 25 games (22 starts) with a 5.60 ERA and a 9‚Äì13 record. After the 2019 season, he chose to retire from playing to become a minor league coach in the Dodgers system. Pitching style A fastball and a slider comprise De Fratus's pitching repertoire; his fastball averages about , but occasionally touches , while his slider is about slower than that. His slider was able to \\"dominate the league\\" in 2014, and although he does not total as many strikeouts as some relievers, he has established himself as a dependable piece in the Phillies' bullpen. Early in his career, De Fratus aspired to be a closer, but after realizing that an \\"all-or-nothing\\" mentality was not necessarily conducive to success, he sought to relax more and focus on being a quality setup reliever, projecting confidence on the mound. Especially in the Phillies' young bullpen, the need for reliable late-innings relievers was great, underscoring the importance of De Fratus's emergence. He is most successful when he utilizes a lower arm angle, and works quickly on the mound. Personal life De Fratus is a devout Roman Catholic who, though he was raised in a large Catholic family, struggled with his faith after an injury early in his career, but ultimately determined the injury was a gift from God to help him better understand his faith: \\"I really feel that the setback was God telling me, ‚ÄòHey you are not done. You are not done yet figuring out what you need to figure out, and I am going to give you a little more time.‚Äô There is a big reason why that injury happened and I feel that I used it as best as I could have.\\" He noted that he would like to take classes at a seminary to help proselytize to others. Early in his professional career, he struggled to find fellow Catholics, and noted that most of his teammates were either Protestants or not religious. Moreover, in many small towns that house minor league teams, there are no Catholic churches, so De Fratus found it easy to slide away from leading a Catholic lifestyle. However, upon realizing that there is more to life than material success, he discovered a need for God, and has thus developed his faith. Aside from his faith, he enjoys writing and recording music, and playing the guitar. He has two brothers, the older of whom, Steve, played in the minor leagues, and the younger of whom, Chris, caught a foul ball during De Fratus's major league debut. During the offseason preceding the 2015 season, De Fratus became involved in some controversy involving Phillies blogger Bill Baer and the Black Lives Matter campaign when he tweeted, \\"I'm sick of this black vs white and men vs women garbage that's been going on. We're just people. #AllLivesMatter,\\" to which Baer responded with a scathing column on Crashburn Alley, a blog affiliated with ESPN, in which he stated that De Fratus is \\"complicit in perpetuating a system which inflicts violence on those who didn‚Äôt have the luxury of being born white and male and straight and in an economically-stable area.\\" Subsequently, De Fratus penned a retort to Baer via Facebook, in which he commented, \\"I sincerely hope that you will take the time to talk to me personally next time before you decide to hide behind your computer screen and criticize me, my upbringing and my character based on 140 characters. I do not apologize for anything I have said. I have a platform and I WILL use it for the agenda of love.\\" References External links Living people 1987 births Sportspeople from Whittier, California Baseball players from California American Roman Catholics Major League Baseball pitchers Philadelphia Phillies players Ventura Pirates baseball players Gulf Coast Phillies players Williamsport Crosscutters players Lakewood BlueClaws players Clearwater Threshers players Reading Phillies players Mesa Solar Sox players Lehigh Valley IronPigs players Tacoma Rainiers players Sportspeople from Oxnard, California Round Rock Express players Harrisburg Senators players Syracuse Chiefs players Southern Maryland Blue Crabs players Arkansas Travelers players Sportspeople from Ventura County, California √Åguilas de Mexicali players Tulsa Drillers players Oklahoma City Dodgers players Catholics from California ","title":"Justin De Fratus"},{"id":"31164133","text":"Ryszard W≈Çadys≈Çaw Tomczyk (born in Bierzwnik, Poland, on August 17, 1959) is a Polish politician, a historian, and a member of Local government.

Design and development The Burnelli RB-1, often known as the Remington-Burnelli Airliner, was an American passenger biplane from 1920, designed by Vincent Burnelli.Taylor 1989, p.225 It incorporated Burnelli's lifting-body design. Following several more conventional designs during the WWI years, Burnelli came up with the idea of a lifting body: an airfoil-shaped fuselage that could be used to generate up to 50% of the lift, improving performance, due to reduced wing area and fuel consumption. The RB-1's body contributed about 27% of the total lifting area and was designed to support about 15% of its weight. The fuselage was built around plywood frames and was clad in corrugated duralumin. The two pilots were situated in a pair of open cockpits, each with a mechanic seated by his side. Its pair of Liberty engines were immediately in front of these cockpits, largely buried in the leading edge of the body but accessible from the cockpits. The body width of 14 ft (4.27 m) placed the engines only 10 ft 4 in (3.15 m) apart, with about 1 in (25 mm) clearance between propeller tips. The cabin housed up to 30 passengers. At the fixed \\"trailing edge\\" of the fuselage small twin fins mounted above its sides carried balanced rudders and short, mid-fuselage mounted tailplanes carried balanced elevators. It was a single bay equal span biplane, with simple parallel interplane struts and without stagger. The wings were wooden structures, fabric covered. The ailerons carried on both upper and lower wings had prominent tip balances. The RB-1 flew for the first time on 21 June 1921 from Curtiss Field, Long Island, piloted by Bert Acosta and William P. Sullivan. Its performance was considered acceptable. However, the first model produced was badly damaged while on the ground during a storm.  Burnelli RB-2  The Burnelli RB-2 was a 1920s American twin-engined biplane freighter or airliner, designed by Vincent Burnelli with a lifting body fuselage. At the time it was the world's largest commercial freighter. It was the first aircraft to carry a motor car inside its fuselage. =Design and development= The RB-2 was based on the earlier RB-1 airliner, it had improved control surfaces and was powered by two 650 hp Galloway Atlantic piston engines. It had a corrugated metal construction with a dural skin giving it an empty weight of 5 tons. The passenger cabin could be fitted with 25 seats or used for freight. In 1925 the aircraft was used by the Hudson Motor Car Company as a flying showroom for the Essex automobile.

History Part of the area was previously called Flemington, named after the hairdresser and tobacconist Jubal Fleming (c.1844‚Äì1903). Fleming had a subdivision at the corner of Breezes and Pages Roads, and the tram stop on Breezes Road was informally called Flemington. The post office was established in 1912 and it was named Aranui by George Kyngdon Burton (c.1859‚Äì1957), with that name then applied to the wider area. Mabel Howard, New Zealand's first woman cabinet minister, was once a resident in the area. Geography Aranui shops Aranui is one of the eastern suburbs. Its eastern boundary is the Avon River. Boundary roads are Pages Road in the south, Breezes Road in the west, and Wainoni Road in the north. Bexley is located to the south of Pages Road.

His first foray into the weapons design world was during his years of service in the United States Army. He designed the Ingram Model 6 in 1949 and later went on to design and manufacture the MAC-10 and MAC-11, which replaced the long outdated M3 Grease Gun and Thompson submachine gun in U.S. service, and continue to be used to this day. Ingram's role in the creation of the MAC-10 earned him the moniker \\"father of the machine pistol\\". His design accomplishments spanned over forty years and left behind several notable designs. His Ranchero and Durango series of rifles incorporated the concept of multiple-use weapons that all use not only the same pistol-caliber rounds but the associated magazines as well.

The noncustodial parent has access to the child only when supervised by another adult. Supervised visitation is used to protect children from potentially dangerous situations while allowing parental access and providing support for the parent child relationship.  Legal status  Most countries recognize a parent's right to children, called visitation, residence, or contact. Most courts, including American and European, will allow the parent who does not have primary custody (the noncustodial parent) to have specified visitation and access to the child. In America the parents must establish a parenting plan setting out specific details. If the parents are not able to agree, the court may order specific possession and access or may appoint a parenting coordinator to assist the parents. The United States recognizes that parents have a constitutional right to their children (See Troxel v. Granville). In this case the United States Supreme Court stated that \\"the interest of parents in the care, custody and control of their children--is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by this Court.\\"Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65; 120 S Ct 2054, 2060 (2000). In most of the US states there is a law required that court-ordered parenting plans must set forth the minimum amount of parenting time and type of access (i.e. supervised/unsupervised) a non-custodial parent is entitled to have. According to the state laws and court guidelines, the Custody Supervisor cannot change the court order to make major modifications to the amount of parenting time and access, only the minor changes or clarification of parenting time/access schedules or conditions including vacation, holidays, and temporary variation from the existing parenting plan are allowed.https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2856180519464028219&q;=bower+v.+bournay- bower&hl;=en&as;_sdt=40000006&as;_vis=1  Purpose  The purpose of supervised visitation is to provide a safe and neutral environment for children to have a relationship with parents, and is often used in high conflict situations. Many courts take the position that it is better to make an error that protects the child as opposed to leaving a child at risk. There are many reasons supervised visitation may be needed: * domestic violence, * sexual abuse, * drug abuse, * mental illness, * risk of international parental child abduction, * general risk of child abduction, * neglect, * adoption, * any other potentially dangerous family situations. This is true worldwide, for example, Child contact centre in England and Angel House in Texas have a similar purpose. While many countries have signed the Hague Convention which requires the return of victims of international parental child abduction, the best measure is prevention.  Types  Supervised visitation has many forms, including one-on-one supervision, group supervision, neutral or monitored exchange, telephone or video monitoring, and therapeutic supervision. . * One- on-one supervision is when a one parent and that parent's children are supervised alone, but some providers allow guest to also attend. * Group supervision may include several parent-child groups in a larger areas, supervised by one or more monitors. * Neutral or monitored exchange allows parents to pick up and drop off, or exchange the child for changes of possession, without direct contact with each other, minimizing conflict. * Telephone or video monitoring has become more popular as people move around the world more, allowing for monitoring of telephone, videoconferencing, and other virtual visitation. * Therapeutic supervision is conjoint parent-child therapy conducted by a licensed or certified mental health professional also trained to provide supervised visitation. This includes a student or intern in training for a post-graduate degree under the direct supervision of a licensed or certified mental health professional. Friends or family members may be ordered or agree to supervise, or be present during supervised visitations. Professional providers may also be used, depending on the court order.  Records  Most professional providers require intake forms or an application and maintain intake records. Privacy is of utmost concern, especially when there is a history of domestic violence. Many providers also document visits and maintain visit records. There is controversy over what, if any, records may be used in court.  Worldwide  Supervised visitation is growing worldwide to protect children from child abuse and child abduction. Supervised visitation bridges the gap between keeping the child safe and supporting the family relationship and parental rights. One constant, worldwide, is that supervised visitation has few legal guidelines as little legislation addresses it directly. However, many courts and state departments have set guidelines regarding supervised visitation.

Departing from Acla (in modern Dari√©n Province), he descended to the Chucunaque River, which Vasco N√∫√±ez de Balboa had also used in 1513 to cross the isthmus, first following the coast to the town of Careta, then receiving assistance from the Cimarrones for the crossing itself.  Voyages to the New World  = First expedition = In May 1572, John Oxenham joined Francis Drake's expedition to Central America, along with Drake's brothers John and Joseph (who both died on the voyage). They left Plymouth with a total of 73 men in the Pasha (70 tons) and Swanet (25 tons), set up an operating base in a creek in the Isthmus of Panama, and raided the Isle of Pines, Cartagena, and Nombre de Dios to divert the attention of the Spanish. With the help of the Cimarrones, they set an ambush on the route for transporting silver across Panama and captured a mule train that was passing during the night. The small guard fled, and Drake sailed back to Plymouth in August 1573 with a significant treasure.La Poesie Espagnole, par John Arthur RAY site de Archive Internet, consult√© le 11 avril 2010. = Second expedition = After participating in Drake's successful voyage, Oxenham launched his own expedition to Panama, leaving Plymouth on 9 April 1576 with an 11-gun frigate (100‚Äì140 tons, name unknown) and 57 men,James Seay Dean, Tropics Bound: Elizabeth's Seadogs on the Spanish Main, The History Press, 2010. Chapter \\"Undone by Chicken Feathers and a Lady.\\" and after taking some prizes and prisoners, hid his ship and prizes and proceeded on the Panama mainland. The Cimarrones guided Oxenham and his men across the Cordillera de San Blas to the head of the Chucunaque River, which flows into the Pacific Ocean. During the winter, Oxenham's men and their Cimarron allies felled and milled cedar trees to build a shallow-draft 45 foot, oared boat, that they then floated down the river and into the ocean, making Oxenham the first Englishman to build a vessel in the New World; he wasn't the first to sail in the Pacific as Magellan's master gunner was an Englishman. The Spanish were taken completely by surprise, not expecting an enemy vessel in Pacific waters, and Oxenham's crew was able to capture two unguarded barques with 160,000 pesetas of silver and gold along with other supplies. However, the Spanish eventually pursued Oxenham up the Tuira River, where trash discarded by Oxenham's men and floating down the river gave them away. Oxenham buried the treasure, but the Spanish eventually recovered most of it. Oxenham was wounded in the Spanish attack, but managed to escape with a few crew members and survive several months on the run, until the Spanish captured him, and 17 others, who were taken to Panama in 1578; three boys were spared and 12 others were hanged. He was executed at Lima on 30 September 1580, along with John Butler and Thomas Sherwell, while his former commander, Francis Drake, was himself in the Pacific on his famous raids in the Golden Hind.

Ben Amer was born in Marj near Benghazi and attended the Garyounis University in Benghazi. Belonging to a poor family without influence, Ben Amer rose to national prominence at a public execution staged by the Gaddafi government in 1984. The event in Benghazi's basketball stadium had been announced as the trial of one of Gaddafi's political enemies, al-Sadek Hamed Al-Shuwehdy, an engineer who had been peacefully campaigning against the colonel's rule. But instead the schoolchildren and students who had been assembled for the purpose were made to see al-Shuwehdy's execution by hanging.

That display of ruthlessness, about which she later liked to boast‚Äîshe is remembered in Benghazi by her saying \\"we don't need talking, we need hangings\\"‚Äîearned her the enduring loathing of the people of Benghazi and the nickname Huda Al- Shannaga‚Äî\\"Huda the Executioner\\".  video However, it impressed Gaddafi, who had been watching the execution on live TV.

History  The origin of the L√ºbeck shield is not certain, but thought to be derived from the Hanseatic flag, first seen on a ship's seal in 1230. This is also the oldest reference to its own national emblem of the city, with the Imperial eagle appearing a little later, first seen on early 14th-century coins. The colors of the shield are thought not to come from the County of Holstein, but from the Imperial arms. From around 1450 the two arms were found combined, the eagle bearing the Hanseatic coat of arms as breast shield. Its continued use today makes it not the oldest coat of arms of Schleswig-Holstein. The oldest coat of arms of Flensburg is older. After the inclusion of L√ºbeck into the First French Empire on 1 January 1811, the city received a new coat of arms, to emphasise the position of L√ºbeck as a community within the French state. In this emblem, designed by the Conseil du Sceau, the traditional red-and-white coat of arms sat on a pair of black eagle's wings, an approximate representation of the L√ºbeck double eagle; this combination on a white field. As L√ºbeck was one of the Bonnes villes of the Empire, a chief gules, with three golden Imperial bees, was added. This coat of arms was awarded to L√ºbeck by Napoleon Bonaparte on 13 June 1811 with a signed Wappenbrief. After liberation from French rule in 1813, and the restoration of L√ºbeck's status as an independent city-state, the traditional coat of arms was reinstated. With the abolition of L√ºbeck's independence in the Greater Hamburg Act of 1937, annexing it to the Free State of Prussia, as a part of the Province of Schleswig-Holstein, the city was permitted to keep its old coat of arms.

The scheme was launched in 1975, discontinued in 1978 by the government of Morarji Desai, and then relaunched by the Tenth Five Year Plan. Tenth five year plan also linked ICDS to Anganwadi centres established mainly in rural areas and staffed with frontline workers. In addition to fighting malnutrition and ill health, the programme is also intended to combat gender inequality by providing girls the same resources as boys. A 2005 study found that the ICDS programme was not particularly effective in reducing malnutrition, largely because of implementation problems and because the poorest states had received the least coverage and funding. During the 2018‚Äì19 fiscal year, the Indian central government allocated ‚Çπ16,335 crores to the programme. The widespread network of ICDS has an important role in combating malnutrition especially for children of weaker groups. Background Majority of children in India have underprivileged childhoods starting from birth. The infant mortality rate of Indian children is 34 and the under-five mortality rate is 39 and 25% of newborn children are underweight among other nutritional, immunization and educational deficiencies of children in India. Figures for India are substantially worse than the country average. ICDS was launched in 1975 in accordance to the National Policy for Children in India. Over the years it has grown into one of the largest integrated family and community welfare schemes in the world. Given its effectiveness over the last few decades, Government of India has committed towards ensuring universal availability of the programme. Scope of services The following services are sponsored under ICDS to help achieve its objectives: # Immunization # Supplementary nutrition # Health checkup # Referral services # Pre-school education(Non-Formal) # Nutrition and Health information Implementation For nutritional purposes ICDS provides 500 kilocalories (with 12-15 gm grams of protein) every day to every child below 6 years of age. For adolescent girls it is up to 500 kilo calories with up to 25 grams of protein everyday. The services of Immunisation, Health Check-up and Referral Services delivered through Public Health Infrastructure under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. UNICEF has provided essential supplies for the ICDS scheme since 1975. World Bank has also assisted with the financial and technical support for the programme. The cost of ICDS programme averages $10‚Äì$22 per child a year. The scheme is Centrally sponsored with the state governments contributing up to per day per child. Furthermore, in 2008, the GOI adopted the World Health Organization standards for measuring and monitoring the child growth and development, both for the ICDS and the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM). These standards were developed by WHO through an intensive study of six developing countries since 1997. They are known as New WHO Child Growth Standard and measure of physical growth, nutritional status and motor development of children from birth to 5 years age. Challenges Despite increasing funding over the past three decades, the ICDS fell short of its stated objectives and still faces a number of challenges. Also, though it has widespread coverage, operational gaps mean that service delivery is not consistent in quality and quantity across the country. Impact By end of 2010, the programme is claiming to reach 80.6 lakh expectant and lactating mothers along with 3.93 crore children (under 6 years of age). There are 6,719 operational projects with 1,241,749 operational Aanganwadi centres. Several positive benefits of the programme have been documented and reported * A study in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka demonstrated significant improvement in the mental and social development of all children irrespective of their gender. * A 1992 study of National Institute of Public Cooperation and Child Development confirmed improvements in birth-weight and infant mortality of Indian children along with improved immunization and nutrition. However, World Bank has also highlighted certain key shortcomings of the programme including inability to target the girl child improvements, participation of wealthier children more than the poorer children and lowest level of funding for the poorest and the most undernourished states of India.

The resulting design is a mid-wing glider built predominately from wood, with the wing leading edge filled with styrofoam and doped aircraft fabric used on the aft portion of the wing, the tail and the rudder. After the first two were completed the remainder were built from metal in place of wood. The design features an all-flying stabilator with an anti-servo tab, spoilers on the wing's top surface and dive brakes on the bottom. The Nelson H-59 4-cylinder engine was mounted on a retractable mast aft of the bubble canopy. The aircraft has two wheels in tandem, the front being steerable and connected to the rudder pedals. The design was not type certified, and the seven built were registered under the Experimental - Racing - Exhibition category. Nelson later sold the rights to the aircraft and the engine to Charles Rhoades of Naples, Florida. Operational history In the mid-1950s a Hummingbird was flown by Les Arnold to an unofficial US motorgliding distance record of . In March 2011 there were still five registered in the US, two of which had been transferred to the National Soaring Museum. A gliderport in Livermore, California was named \\"Hummingbird Haven\\" as several of the craft were based there.

The color of Helio has been described as part of the purple family and has been compared to the color lavender. It also falls into the category of opaque glass, but the color changes depend on the light source. The variation of purple differs between pieces, but the color is consistent within the piece itself. It is believed that Helio was only produced for a short time because it is not mentioned in trade journals after 1924. Design The majority of the pieces produced were of simple design, free of any decoration for the most part, although there are some with a gold leaf pattern or a black-dragon design. This is true for any of the opaque colors made in the 1920s. Helio Compote Heliotrope Collectors of Helio will also refer to it as Heliotrope because of the color of the glass, but that name has not been found in any printed material from Cambridge Glass. History of the colors in Cambridge Glass The colors of Cambridge Glass were a main selling point. When the first catalog came out in 1903, it was in color. The number and variety of colors is unclear. In the early 1970s it was thought that there were around 35 colors, but as of 1984 newly discovered colors brought the total to around 50. Other colors of opaque glass include Ebony, Ivory, Primrose, Azurite, Jade and Avocado. Chemists Most of the records of the colors created by the chemists at Cambridge Glass have not survived, little is known about the chemists themselves. Arnold Fielder worked at Cambridge from around 1916‚Äì17 until the mid-1920s. He is thought to have produced most of the colors during that time.

Alfred Basel (23 March 1876 ‚Äì 24 January 1920) was an Austrian painter and etcher. Born in Vienna to a factory owner, Basel studied at the Wiener Kunstgewerbeschule under Felician von Myrbach between 1892 and 1898. He was a reserve officer during the First World War, serving with the rank of Oberleutnant in the Fourth Army on the Galician front from March 1915. In the fall he fell ill and was declared unfit for military service. By November he was a war artist serving the Kriegspressequartier. In 1916 he was on the Vistula, in the Carpathians, in Albania, on the Isonzo, and in the Ukraine. It was his artistic breakthrough. In 1919, at the winter exhibition of the Wiener K√ºnstlerhaus, Basel exhibited his work outside of the Kriegspressequartier for the first time. His treatment of military events was careful and accurate, and both stylistically and biographically he has many similarities to Oskar Laske. Like him, Basel avoids sensationalising or exaggerating, and favours crowds of small figures and a simplicity approaching photographic accuracy.

It is found in shallow parts of the western Atlantic Ocean.Tree of Life Web Project Distribution The Atlantic brief squid occurs most frequently in shallow waters along the eastern seaboard of the United States as far north as Delaware. It has also been found in Argentina, Brazil, the British Virgin Islands, Colombia, Mexico, Panama, Puerto Rico, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela.Global Biodiversity Information Facility Description Lolliguncula brevis The female Atlantic brief squid is about 11 cm long and the male 9 cm. The basic colour is dark reddish-brown to yellow-brown and there are many chromatophores on the upper surface which enable the squid to change colour. The mantle is widest in the middle and tapers to a rounded point at the back. The fins are wider than they are long, rounded and about half the length of the mantle. The mantle has thick muscular walls and a large water-filled cavity and is separated from the head by a collar. The head has two large eyes, the structure of which is very similar to vertebrate eyes. There is a funnel underneath the head which is used in locomotion. There are five pairs of appendages. Numbers 1, 2, 3 and 5 are short tapering arms with two rows of suckers. The left 5th appendage of males is modified to form a hectocotylus arm which is used to transfer spermatophores into the female reproductive organ. The other pair of appendages are contractile tentacles and are much longer than the arms. These have clubs with four rows of suckers at the distal end and are used for capturing food which is then transferred to the arms. The posterior end of the female mantle is occupied by a pair of white nidamental glands which secrete the material from which the egg capsule is formed.Invertebrate Anatomy OnLine Biology This species is found in warm shallow waters, often at the mouths of rivers where it seems to tolerate low salinity levels. It eats small fish and crustaceans. In order to move, water inside the mantle cavity is expelled through the funnel by muscular contraction of the mantle walls. To catch fast moving prey, the contraction is vigorous, sending a jet of water through the funnel which is directed backwards. To escape a predator, the funnel is directed forwards and the squid shoots backwards at great speed. It can also emit a cloud of ink to distract the predator.Chesapeake Bay: Brief Squid Eggs are deposited in a gelatinous capsule attached to the sea bed.

Cast *Eddie Bracken as Ogden Spencer Trulow III *Veronica Lake as Sally Martin *Albert Dekker as Insp Callahan *Frank Fenton as Mr. Phillips *George Zucco as Dr. Paval Storasky *Donald MacBride as Mr. Kratz *Lewis Russell as Henry Carteret *Norma Varden as Mrs. Carteret *Willie Best as Willie *Jack Norton as the drunk Production The film was originally known as Good Intentions. Officially it is a remake of Paths to Paradise, a 1925 silent comedy starring Raymond Griffith, inasmuch as both are based on the same play, Heart of a Thief by Paul Armstrong. However, the storyline was almost entirely reworked, to the extent that the two films have almost nothing in common apart from a few sight gags and a party sequence in which a valuable necklace is the target of the thieves. The movie was originally offered to Bob Hope, then under contract to Paramount. He refused to do it unless he could make one film per year outside Paramount. The studio refused and Hope was put on suspension. The part was given instead to Eddie Bracken. (Hope and Paramount would eventually resolve their differences and sign a new seven-year contract.) Filming started 20 November 1944. The part was a favorite of Lake's because it represented a change of pace for her (\\"it's a comedy, rather what Carole Lombard used to do\\") and she liked working with George Marshall, calling him \\"splendid... he's lots of fun, acts out the scenes himself,\\" she said. Reception Diabolique said \\"this is the sort of movie that should have been great fun but just isn‚Äôt; Bracken flails about, Lake is dull and lacking sexiness, and together they lack the chemistry of, say, Bob Hope and Paulette Goddard.\\" References External links Review of film at New York Times 1945 films Films directed by George Marshall American films American comedy films 1945 comedy films American black-and-white films ","title":"Hold That Blonde"},{"id":"31164953","title":"List of Olympic venues in shooting"},{"id":"31164954","text":"L√µve is a village in P√µdrala Parish, Valga County, in southern Estonia.

In 2011, he played for the Clearwater Threshers, the Phillies' affiliate in Class A-Advanced, and hit .268/.306/.333, with 4 home runs and 37 runs batted in (RBIs).

On May 29, he made his debut, pinch hitting for Antonio Bastardo. Shortly after, he was optioned to the AAA Lehigh Valley IronPigs, with whom he was named to the International League mid-season and post-season All-Star teams, as he batted .309 (3rd in the league)/.375/.402, led the league in triples (9), and was 4th in the league in stolen bases (32).2013 International League Batting Leaders  Baseball-Reference.com He was the International League Batter of the Week on July 7. In July, when Ben Revere sustained an injury, he was converted to a center fielder, a conversion he made quickly and effectively, garnering a call-up to the big leagues, as he was a \\"pleasant surprise\\". His manager, Dave Brundage, commented, \\"He's done very well offensively and now they're trying to see if we can create a spot or find a spot and see if it's a fit or not.\\" MiLB.com named him a Philadelphia Organization All Star. While with the big- league club, Hern√°ndez played in 34 games, batting .289/.344/.331 to go along with 10 RBIs. After the season, Hern√°ndez traveled to his native Venezuela to play for the Venezuelan Winter League Bravos de Margarita, with whom he hit .254/.318/.347, with 2 home runs and 15 RBIs. He stopped playing prior to the end of the season to rest prior to Phillies spring training. He had played with Bravos de Margarita in the winters since the 2010 season. Entering the 2014 season, Hern√°ndez drew comparisons to fellow reserve Freddy Galvis. While Galvis could play shortstop and had experience in the corner outfield positions, Hern√°ndez could play center field and was a natural second baseman, and with Chase Utley's frequent injuries, Hern√°ndez would likely see time there. Both players were expected to see significant time with the big-league team, predominantly due to the established core ‚Äì players such as Utley, Ryan Howard, and Jimmy Rollins ‚Äì being relatively old (in 2013, the Phillies average age was 28.4, the third-oldest in the Major Leagues) and injury-prone over the preceding several seasons, leaving ample playing time for replacements such as Hern√°ndez, especially considering the fact that he would be able to continue his development in the minor leagues after MLB granted the Phillies a fourth option year, essentially meaning that they could keep him in the minor leagues during the season without him having to clear waivers. Ultimately, he began the season on the major league roster, but was sent down to Reading (AA) in April to focus on honing his defensive skills at third base and shortstop. In 2014 with the Phillies, he batted .237/.290/.281 with one home run, four RBIs, and one stolen base.Cesar Hernandez Stats  Baseball- Reference.com In 2014 between Reading and Lehigh Valley, he batted .290/.358/.394 with 3 home runs, 24 RBIs, and 8 stolen bases. 2015‚Äì17; Leader in bunts, infield hits, and triples Entering 2015, analysts doubted his future with the major league club out of spring training, as several attempts to broaden Hern√°ndez's defensive versatility had failed. After Chase Utley was injured, Hern√°ndez saw more playing time at second base and performed well enough that he was named starting second baseman even upon Utley's return, and eventually Utley was traded. Hern√°ndez ended up being a \\"highlight in an otherwise pathetic showing\\" for the Phillies, who finished with 99 losses on the season. Hern√°ndez had a 12-game hitting streak from June 26 to July 7, 2015. He batted .272/.339/.348 with one home run, 35 RBIs, and 19 stolen bases, and tied for 5th in the NL in bunt hits (7), for 6th in sacrifice hits (4), and for 9th in infield hits (22). Most anticipated Hern√°ndez would start at second base on Opening Day in 2016, not necessarily because he was exceedingly good, but because there was no one else to replace him, and on a rebuilding club, an upgrade was not a high priority. In 2016, he batted .294/.371/.393 with 6 home runs, 39 RBIs, and 17 stolen bases. Hern√°ndez led the major leagues in bunt hits, with 15 (the most by any Phillie since Larry Bowa also had 15, in 1975), and led the National League in infield hits (34) and triples (11), as he was tied for 6th in the league in sacrifice hits (6).\\"Major League Leaderboards ¬ª 2016 ¬ª Batters ¬ª Batted Ball Statistics\\"  FanGraphs Baseball On defense, he led NL second basemen in double plays turned, with 102.

It is a distinct genre from Environmental art in that it involves functional ecological systems- restoration, as well as socially engaged, activist, community-based interventions. Ecological art also addresses politics, culture, economics, ethics and aesthetics as they impact the conditions of ecosystems. Ecological art practitioners include artists, scientists, philosophers and activists who often collaborate on restoration, remediation and public awareness projects. Historical precedents Art historical precedents include environmental art, earthworks, land art, sustainable art, landscape painting, and landscape photography. While historical examples may reach back to neolithic times, according to the history published in the book, Ecovention: current art to transform ecologies, a short list of key works include Herbert Bayer's Grass Mound (1955) at the Aspen Art Institute, Aspen, CO; Joseph Beuys 1962 proposed action to clean up the Elbe River in Hamburg, German; Hans Haacke's 1965 manifesto for time-based, \\"natural\\", dynamic indeterminate art; Nicolas Uriburu's 1968 performance \\"Green Power, coloration Grand Canal - Venice\\" and Agnes Denes's 1968 performance, Haiku Poetry Burial, Rice Planting and Tree Chaining/Exercises in Eco-Logic, in Sullivan County, New York. 1969 was a watershed year for ecological art practices, including Haacke's Grass Grows in Ithaca, NY; Alan Sonfist's activities articulating the significance of native forests in urban areas and his action to monitor air quality in New York city. Betty Beaumont documented the clean-up of what was the worst U.S. ocean oil spill off the coast of Santa Barbara, California, while Mierle Laderman Ukeles wrote Manifesto for Maintenance Art (Spaid) In 1969, the John Gibson Gallery in New York city mounted the exhibition, Ecologic Art, that included the work of Will Insley, Claes Oldenburg, Christo, Peter Hutchinson, Dennis Oppenheim, Robert Morris, Robert Smithson, Carl Andre, Jan Dibbets, and Richard Long. In 1969‚Äì1970, Helen Mayer Harrison and Newton Harrison collaborated on mapping endangered species around the world. In 1971, artist Bonnie Sherk performs Public Lunch with the Animals in the Lion House of the San Francisco Zoo. From 1972 to 1979, Helen and Newton Harrison realize seven projects designed for and about lagoons in California. The 1972 essay, Art and Ecological Consciousness by Gyorgy Kepes in his book, Arts of the Environment. presents the genre as distinct from environmental art. In the 1992 exhibition and book, Fragile Ecologies: Contemporary Artists' Interpretations and Solutions, art historian, Dr. Barbara Matilsky differentiates ecological art from environmental art in that the former has ethical underpinnings. In 1993, a workshop and exhibition, specifically about ecological systems and art, was presented by Don Krug, Renee Miller and Barbara Westfall at the Society for Ecological Restoration in Irvine, California. The term ecovention, was coined in 1999 as a conjunction of the words ecology and intervention, in conjunction with an exhibition of the same name curated by Amy Lipton and Sue Spaid, representing artist's projects that use inventive strategies to physically transform a local ecology. In a 2006 UNESCO research report for the Art in Ecology think tank on arts and sustainability, \\"Mapping the Terrain of Contemporary EcoArt Practice and Collaboration,\\" the artist Beth Carruthers uses the term Ecoart. A current definition of ecological art drafted collectively by the EcoArt Network of international artists, founded in 1998, is: \\"Ecological Art is an art practice that embraces an ethic of social justice in both its content and form/materials. EcoArt is created to inspire caring and respect, stimulate dialogue, and encourage the long-term flourishing of the social and natural environments in which we live. It commonly manifests as socially engaged, activist, community-based restorative or interventionist art.\\" Theories The 2012 book, Toward Global (Environ)Mental Change - Transformative Art and Cultures of Sustainability, proposes that the global crisis of unsustainability is a disruption of the hardware of civilization, as well as a crisis of the software of the human mind. The 2004 book, Ecological aesthetics: art in environmental design: theory and practice, presents an analysis of a variety of tendencies and approaches to landscape architecture, science and theory that inform research and the transformation of the landscape for over thirty years. Green Arts Web, compiled by Carnegie Mellon University senior librarian, Mo Dawley, is a compendium of core readings on contemporary environmental art, ecological art and theory (20th century to the present) that includes, among other sub- categories, for example, deep ecology practices; ecofeminism; ecopsychology; land ethic and bioregionalism; sense of place; and systems thinking. Principles Artists considered to be working within this field subscribe to one or more of the following principles: *Focus on the web of interrelationships in our environment‚Äîon the physical, biological, cultural, political, and historical aspects of ecological systems. *Create works that employ natural materials or engage with environmental forces such as wind, water, or sunlight. *Reclaim, restore, and remediate damaged environments. *Inform the public about ecological dynamics and the environmental problems we face. *Revise ecological relationships, creatively proposing new possibilities for coexistence, sustainability, and healing. Approaches Ecological art involves numerous diverse approaches, including: *Representational artwork: reveals information and conditions through image-making and object-making with the intention of stimulating dialogue. *Remediation projects: reclaim or restore polluted and disrupted environments ‚Äì these artists often work with environmental scientists, landscape architects and urban planners. *Activist and protest art: engage, inform, energize and activate change of behaviors and/or public policy. *Social sculptures: are socially engaged, time-based artwork that involve communities in monitoring their landscapes, and take a participatory role in sustainable practices and lifestyles. *Ecopoetic art: initiate a re-envisioning of the natural world, inspiring co-existence with other species. *Direct encounter artworks: utilize natural phenomena such as water, weather, sunlight, plants, etc. *Didactic or pedagogical works: share information about environmental injustice and ecological problems such as water and soil pollution and health hazards through education. *Lived-and- relational aesthetics: involve sustainable, off-the-grid, permaculture existences. Orientations Contemporary ecological art has been articulated across interdisciplinary and scholarly groups in terms of life-centered issues, community participation, public dialogue, and ecological sustainability. In 1996, the educator and activist, Don Krug identified concepts frequently addressed by ecological artists that can be used by to interpret ecological perspectives and practices. The following four orientations were identified: Environmental Design, Ecological Design, Social Restoration, and Ecological Restoration. *Environmental design/Sustainable design ‚Äì Some artists work with nature as a resource for particular aesthetic endeavors. Artists with an orientation to environmental design are interested in achieving particular formal aesthetic effects. In the 1980s and 90s, artists, architects, designers, and civil engineers explored ways to link art, aesthetics, ecology, and culture. *Ecological design ‚Äì Artists who work in the area of ecological design create art that is contingent on direct experiences and interactions with a particular place where the art is created. An ecological view of design considers the artwork within larger contexts of how people, plants, and animals are interconnected with each other, the site, and/or the earth. *Ecological restoration ‚Äì Some artists attempt to alert viewers to environmental issues and problems through scientific exploration and educational documentation. They seek to restore fragile places and educate the public to the systemic character of bioregions through the use of communication, ritual, and performance. Some ecological artists engage people directly in activities or actions by confronting environmentally unhealthy practices with social, ethical, and moral ecological concerns. *Social restoration ‚Äì An ecological ethic where humans live in relationship to larger communities of life to catalyze socially responsible artwork. Socio-ecological artists critically examine everyday life experiences. These artists scrutinize relations of power that produce community tensions about ecological issues.

It was notable for having sections that were officially designated as clothing optional prior to 2013. The beach is named for the nearby Fire Island Lighthouse and was formerly the largest recognized clothing optional beach in New York. On 5 February 2013, the Fire Island National Seashore announced its plan to begin enforcing New York State anti-nudity laws on all Fire Island beaches, including Lighthouse Beach, ending clothing optional usage. The beach is approximately long and can be defined as the ocean facing beach between Robert Moses State Park and the community of Kismet. Technically, it is in the Town of Islip. This image taken from the top of the lighthouse facing south shows the entirety of Lighthouse Beach. The parking lot of Field 5 of Robert Moses State Park can be seen next to the beach on the far right and the community of Kismet can be just seen in the mist on the far left.  Location   History  There are some reports of nudists using the beach as far back as World War II, getting to the island by rowboat. After the Robert Moses Causeway was extended to Fire Island in 1964, word slowly spread, resulting in the clothing optional usage expanding greatly in the 1970s. Originally, the entire stretch of beach was clothing optional, however there have been some complaints from users objecting to the nudity going back to the 1980s. These complaints were largely from parents who visited the lighthouse and were surprised by the nudity on the beach. In 1994, due to negotiations between Friends of Lighthouse Beach and the National Park Service, the center section was made non-clothing optional or textile so that visitors from the lighthouse who did not want to see nudity could enjoy the beach. Since 5 February 2013, the entirety of Lighthouse Beach has no longer been clothing optional. Bathing suits are required at all times, and violators face a maximum penalty of a $5,000 fine and six months in prison. Note that in New York State, women are legally permitted to be topless and continue to do so at this beach. The beach is widely regarded as family friendly.  Access  Since there is no vehicular traffic permitted in the Seashore, visitors must come in from the Robert Moses State Park in the west or the community of Kismet in the east. There is currently no handicapped access to the beach. In the past, there were accessible ramps from the westernmost boardwalk, but these have been destroyed by winter storms and have not yet been replaced.  Services  There are very limited services at this beach. There are no lifeguards or concessions. There are no trash receptacles making it a Carry in, Carry out facility. As with the rest of the Seashore, law enforcement is provided by National Park Service Rangers with occasional visits from the Suffolk County Police. At least two volunteer organizations work to ensure users are aware of appropriate behavior.

However, troop and weapon movements by new U.S. Cavalry commanding officer Col. Steadlow have endangered the peace and angered the chiefs, in particular one called Kamiakin.

It is bigger and more protected than a hardened aircraft shelter (HAS). An underground hangar complex may include tunnels containing the normal elements of a military air base - fuel storage, weapon storage, rooms for maintaining the aircraft systems, a communications centre, briefing rooms, kitchen, dining rooms, sleeping areas and generators for electrical power. Countries that have used underground hangars include Albania, China, India, Pakistan, Italy, North Korea, Norway, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Vietnam and Yugoslavia. By country =Israel= Eight Israeli air force F-16I Sufa fighter aircraft were damaged in the winter of early 2020 by flooding when they were improperly left inside underground hangars in a Negev desert airbase during severe flooding. The Washington Post reported in 2012 based on the results FOIA requests to the US government that the US Army Corps of Engineers brought in US construction contractors to build installations in the south of Israel including underground hangars for fighter-bombers as a part of US military aid to Israel. =Sweden= Sweden In 1941 the Swedish Air Force began building its first underground hangar at G√∂ta Air Force Wing (F 9), located near Gothenburg in south-west Sweden, it was commissioned in 1943. After World War II plans were made up for building underground hangars at every air force base that had suitable rock conditions. These ambitious building plans proved to be too expensive and were reduced to hangars at certain selected air bases. A second underground hangar was built in 1947 at S√∂dert√∂rn Air Force Wing (F 18) which began operating in 1950. After that plans were finalized for building underground hangars capable of surviving close hits by tactical nuclear weapons. This required that these new hangars be much deeper, with 25 to 30 meters of rock cover, and heavy-duty blast doors in concrete. The Saab 37 Viggen aircraft was designed with a folding tail fin to fit into low hangars. The Aeroseum an aircraft museum open to the public in Gothenburg is housed in the larger cold war era Underground Hangar at S√§ve. =Switzerland= Six Flugzeugkaverne (aircraft caverns), each with space for 30 or more aircraft, were constructed for the Swiss Air Force. One at Meiringen Air Base has been expanded to operate F/A-18 Hornet aircraft. Originally, the plan for the aircraft cavern started its life as a design as a cavern-like aircraft hangar (German \\"Kavernenflugplatz\\") with the possibility launch combat aircraft from the mountain air base. High costs and technical difficulties prevented these from realisation Historic Buildings of the Swiss Air Force (German)Reduit und Schweizer Bunkerprojekte 1995 The idea of using roads as runways was later part of the design demands for the Swiss motorway network. Flugpl√§tze stehen unter Schutz bernerzeitung.ch =Taiwan= Chiashan Air Force Base, located in Hualien, has an extensive underground hangar system which can accommodate two hundred aircraft. Chihhang Air Base in Taitung County can accommodate eighty aircraft in underground hangars. =Former Yugoslavia= The \\"Objekat\\" series of military installations can be found in secluded but strategically important areas within the former Yugoslavia, and the construction of these military bases were initialized by the SFRJ's defence ministry. During the Yugoslav Wars, most of these bases were used by the Serbs in certain operations, but due to extenuating circumstances imposed by the Croat forces, they were destroyed and later rendered useless for military use. Nowadays, they are popular for urban exploration, however it is risky due to the chances of anti- personnel landmines being located in unexplored areas. However, some were spared the destruction due to other circumstances where the Serbs did not control these installations. An example of some that are still in use to this day is the D-0 Armijska Ratna Komanda nuclear bunker in Konjic, however the latter was turned into an art complex, but is still owned by the Ministry of Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The largest underground hangar complex in former Yugoslavia was at ≈Ωeljava Airport near Bihaƒá, with enough space for 80 MiG-21s. Slatina Air Base, located at Pristina International Airport, contained the second largest. =North Korea= There are at least twenty major airfields with underground hangars in North Korea, including Onchon air base, Kang Da Ri Airport and Sunchon Airport.

He currently plays for ASM Clermont Auvergne in the Top 14. He has also represented New Zealand and Samoa in sevens rugby.  Early life and education  Nanai-Williams was born in Auckland, New Zealand, to Tavaefaga Nanai and Aolele Williams. Both his parents are Samoan-born and brought their family to New Zealand in the 1980s. He was raised in a samoan household, and speaks fluent samoan. He grew up in Manurewa, a suburb in South Auckland, and has said the place was \\"pretty rough\\". He attended Manurewa High School and got involved in every sport available, but started playing in the First XV when he was 14 years old. Domestic career After school, Nanai Williams started playing for Counties Manukau and re-signed with for the 2010 season. In the same year, Nanai-Williams signed for the Chiefs and made his Super Rugby debut for the Hamilton-based franchise, against the Sharks. He stayed in the franchise until 2015, and was a key fixture in the Chiefs' Super Rugby triumphs of 2012 and 2013, proving himself an invaluable utility option as he covered wing, outside centre and full-back. After the 2015 Super Rugby season, he signed for the japanese Top League side Ricoh Black Rams. In october 2016, it was announced that he would re-sign for the Chiefs in time for the 2017 Super Rugby Season and with Counties Manukau. On his decision, he said \\"Counties is home for me, so I am rapt to be back with my family in New Zealand and playing rugby. Playing for Counties has always been special for me and that never diminishes. I am looking forward to reuniting with my Counties family and playing some good footy for our fans.\\" In December 2017, after 85 Super Rugby appearances, he signed a three-year contract with French powerhouse Clermont Auvergne, then reigning Top 14 champions, until the end of 2021.  International career  Nanai-Williams grew up dreaming of playing for the All Blacks and represented New Zealand at secondary schools and sevens level between 2008 and 2009. Given the depth and quality of players in the country, he always had the chance of representing Samoa in the back of his mind. In april 2014, he declared \\"My goal is still to make the All Blacks, and the end of year tour is definitely the target. If I don't make that, then I will probably take a closer look at playing for Samoa. I'd discuss it with my family. It just depends on the feedback and my chances of playing for New Zealand in the future\\". After being overlooked for the All Blacks for a number of years, he decided to change his international allegiance to Samoa. In doing so, he became the first player to exploit a loophole whereby playing in four tournaments on the global sevens circuit made himself eligible for the Manu Samoa fifteen-a-side team. The decision came after much encouragement from his parents: \\"They were actually the ones who were approaching me about it [making the change] the most,\\" he said. \\"They were hearing about it [the loophole] on Samoan radio. I told them I hadn't made a decision, but once I decided I told mum and dad and my close family first and mum was pretty happy.\\" Nanai- Williams admits it wasn't an easy decision, stating that \\"It took me ages, but I sat down and talked to my family and talked to my partner Allie and now I'm finally comfortable to go ahead with the decision to make the move. I'm Kiwi born, but I am also a proud Samoan. That blue jersey is the same to me as an All Blacks one to be honest.\\" On his change of heart, he declared: \\"When you are young playing in New Zealand it is always the black jersey and also the [Samoa] jersey. Both my parents are from Samoa and I speak fluent Samoan. I never thought of going overseas. There are guys who have come across to Europe as a personal thing. It is a good choice. It is a choice for their own individual. For me it is more like my loyalty to my roots. Some guys do get offers from clubs overseas and end up playing for England. I have no problem with guys going overseas to financially set themselves up and play for other countries\\". Nanai-Williams has been adamant in saying that he doesn't regret giving up on his dream to play for the All Blacks, in order to represent his family's heritage. In 2015, he declared: \\"I'm loving every minute of it. The decision, to come here and play for Samoa, I've loved every moment of it ever since I made the decision. I've said it before, that when I made the decision, it was pretty much that if my family was happy for me to go with the decision then I was happy with it. So I just followed my heart and it's quite funny being the only person doing it. I've had no guidance. I'm just enjoying every time.\\" Nanai-Williams also admitted that the chance of playing at a Rugby World Cup or at the Olympics was a big reason for his change of allegiance, and that his best shot was in a Samoan jersey: \\"(...) Realistically I had to look at the lineup for the All Blacks. There‚Äôs a lot of talent in New Zealand\\". Nanai-Williams made his test debut for Samoa in the historic game against the All Blacks in Apia, their first ever visit to play a Test match in Samoa. He represented Samoa at the 2015 Rugby World Cup held in England and at the 2019 Rugby World Cup played in Japan. As of july 2020, he has 16 international caps.  Style of play  Nanai-Williams is renowned for his complete skillset in attack, combining speed, footwork, acceleration, vision and creativity to find spaces and exploit gaps in defences. He can also cover several positions in the backline, namely, fullback, wing and centre.

Some other credits that Laguna can be seen on include playing on and singing background vocals for \\"Simon Says\\", \\"Goody Goody Gumdrops\\", \\"Indian Giver\\", and most of the 1910 Fruitgum Company's record 1 2 3 Red Light, playing on \\"Gimmee Gimmee Good Lovin\\" by the Crazy Elephant, The Lemon Pipers' \\"Green Tambourine\\", as well as \\"This Magic Moment\\" and \\"Walkin' in the Rain\\" by Jay and the Americans. One of his most successful writing credits is the tune \\"Groovin' with Mr. Bloe\\", originally a throwaway B-side for Tony Orlando's group Wind. The tune was covered in the UK by studio musicians calling themselves Mr. Bloe, and reached #2 on the UK singles chart in 1970. The original version was reissued in 1970 with \\"Are You Nuts?\\" on the B-side, and credited to Cool Heat charted in the U.S. peaking at #89 on the Billboard Hot 100. Laguna also worked on the soundtrack of the Andy Warhol film Lonesome Cowboys, and worked as a producer in Los Angeles with singers Darlene Love and Bill Medley, formerly of The Righteous Brothers. He played or sang on more than 50 Billboard Top 40 hits by 1972. In the mid 1970s, he worked for a time in Britain, and produced a series of albums with the Steve Gibbons Band, as well as their UK hit single \\"Tulane\\", a cover of a Chuck Berry song. He also worked in Los Angeles, as a writer and producer for Beserkley Records, on songs by and for Jonathan Richman, Greg Kihn, Earth Quake and others. Producer credits with Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers include \\"Buzz, Buzz, Buzz\\" , \\"Abdul and Cleopatra\\", and more.. With Earth Quake and label boss Matthew \\"King\\" Kaufman, he recorded a version of Led Zeppelin's \\"Stairway to Heaven\\", rewritten with the lyrics to the theme song of the television show Gilligan's Island. The record was issued as a single, by Little Roger and the Goosebumps, but the label was threatened with legal action by Led Zeppelin's lawyers and copies were destroyed. It was eventually reissued in 2000 on the compilation CD Laguna Tunes. Laguna met, and began working with, Joan Jett, shortly after the break-up of The Runaways in 1979. Working with Cordell and others, he won her a solo record deal and co-produced her solo albums including Bad Reputation (1980), and I Love Rock 'n' Roll (1981). He established Blackheart Records with Jett in the early 1980s. Journalist Jonathan Gross described Laguna as \\"Jett's surrogate father/brother/manager/mentor/producer/schlepper/bagman, etc.\\" In 1982 he also produced English band Bow Wow Wow's hit version of \\"I Want Candy\\". He has continued to work with Joan Jett, as performer, producer and manager, on her later albums and tours, and acted as Executive Producer on the 2010 film The Runaways, about Jett's earlier band.David J.

This property is due to its structure: the active site of this enzyme is located at the end of a narrow cavity which can only be reached by peptides. History = Background = Proteins are essential macromolecules of living organisms. They are continuously being degraded into their constituent amino acids which can be reused in the synthesis of new proteins. Every cellular protein has its own half-life time. In humans, for instance, 50% of the liver and plasma proteins are replaced in 10 days, whereas in muscles it takes 180 days. In average, every 80 days about 50% of our proteins are totally replaced. Although the regulation of protein degradation is as important as their synthesis to keep each cell protein concentration at the optimum level, research in this area remained until the end of the 1970s. Up to this time, lysosomes, discovered in the 1950s by the Belgian cytologist Christian de Duve, were thought responsible for the complete digestion of intra- and extracellular proteins by the lysosomal hydrolytic enzymes. Between the 1970s and 1980s, this view drastically changed. New experimental evidences showed that, under physiological conditions, non-lysosomal proteases were responsible for limited proteolysis of intra- and/or extracellular proteins, a concept originally conceived by Linderst·¥ìm-Lang in 1950. Endogenous or exogenous proteins are processed by non-lysosomal proteases into intermediate-sized polypeptides, which display gene and metabolic regulation, neurologic, endocrine, and immunological roles, whose dysfunction might explain a number of pathologies. Consequently, protein degradation did not represent anymore the end of the biological function of proteins, but rather the beginning of a yet unexplored side of the biology of the cells. A number of intra- or extracellular proteases release protein fragments endowed with essential biological activities. These hydrolytic processes could be carried out by proteases such as Proteasomes, Proprotein Convertases, Caspases, Rennin and Kallikreins. Among the products released by the non-lysosomal proteases are the bioactive oligopeptides such as hormones, neuropeptides and epitopes that, once released, could be modulated in their biological activities by specific peptidases, which promote the trimming, conversion and/or inactivation of the bioactive oligopeptides. = Early study = The history of oligopeptidases originates in the late 1960s, when the rabbit brain was searched for enzymes that cause inactivation of the nonapeptide bradykinin. In the early and mid 1970s two thiol-activated endopeptidases, responsible for more than 90% of bradykinin inactivation, were isolated from cytosol of rabbit brain, and characterized. They correspond to EOPA (endooligopeptidase A, EC 3.4.22.19), and Prolyl endopeptidase or Prolyl oligopeptidase (POP) (EC 3.4.21.26). Since their activities are restricted to oligopeptides (usually from 8-13 amino acid residues), and do not hydrolyze proteins or large peptides (>30 amino acid residues), they were designated oligopeptidases. In the early and mid 1980s other oligopeptidases, mostly metallopeptidases, were described in the cytosol of mammalian tissues, such as the TOP (thimet oligopeptidase, EC 3.4.24.15), and the neurolysin (EC 3.4.24.16). Earlier on, the ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme, EC 3.4.15.1), and the NEP (neprilysin, EC 3.4.24.11), had been described, at the end of the 1960s, and in 1973, respectively. Function and clinical significance Short 'oligopeptides', predominantly smaller than 30 amino acids in length, play essential roles as hormones, in the surveillance against pathogens, and in neurological activities. Therefore, these molecules constantly need to be specifically generated and inactivated, which is the role of the oligopeptidases. Oligopeptidase is a term coined in 1979 to designate a sub- group of the endopeptidases, which are not involved in the digestion nor in the processing of proteins like the pancreatic enzymes, proteasomes, cathepsins among many others. The prolyl-oligopeptidase or prolyl endopeptidase (POP) is a good example of how an oligopeptidase interacts with and metabolizes an oligopeptide. The peptide has first to penetrate into a 4 √Ö hole on the surface of the enzyme in order to reach an 8,500√Ö3 internal cavity, where the active site is located. Even though the size of the peptide is crucial for its docking, the flexibility of both enzyme and ligand seems to play an essential role in determining whether a peptide bond will be hydrolyzed or not. This contrasts with the classical specificity of proteolytic enzymes, which derives from the chemical features of the amino acid side chains around the scissile bond. A number of enzymatic studies supports this conclusion. This peculiar specificity suggests that the concept of conformational melding of the peptides used to explain the interaction between T-cell receptor and its epitopes, seems more likely to describe the enzymatic specificity of the oligopeptidases. Another important feature of the oligopeptidases is their sensitivity to the oxidation-reduction (redox) state of the environment. An \\"on-off\\" switch provides a qualitative change in peptide binding and/or degradation activity. However, the redox state only exerts strong influence on cytosolic enzymes (TOP neurolysin POP and Ndl-1 oligopeptidase, not on cytoplasmic membrane oligopeptidases (angiotensin- converting enzyme and neprilysin). Thus, the redox state of the intracellular environment very likely modulates the activity of the thiol-sensitive oligopeptidases, thereby contributing to define the fate of proteasome products, driving them to complete hydrolysis, or, alternatively, converting them into bioactive peptides, such as the MHC-Class I peptides.Kessier JH, Khan S, Seifert U et al. (2011) Antigen processing by nardilysin and thimet oligopeptidase generates cytotoxic T cell epitopes. Nature Immunology- http://www.nature.com/ni/journal/v12/n1/full/ni.1974.html Since the discovery of the neuropeptides and peptide hormones from the central nervous system (ACTH, Œ≤-MSH, endorphin, oxytocin, vasopressin, LHRH, enkephalins, substance P), and of peripheral vasoactive peptides (angiotensin, bradykinin) around the middle of last century, the number of known biologically active peptides has exponentially increased. They are signaling molecules, participating in all essential aspects of life, from physiological homeostasis (as neuropeptides, peptide hormones, vasoactive peptides), to immunological defense (as MHC class I and II, cytokinins), and as regulatory peptides displaying more than a single action. These peptides result from partial proteolysis of intracellular or extracellular protein precursors performed by several processing enzymes or protease complexes (rennin, kallikreins, calpains, prohormone convertases, proteasomes, endosomes, lysosomes), which convert proteins into peptides, including those with biological activities. The resulting protein fragments of various sizes are either readily degraded into free amino acids, or captured by oligopeptidases, whose peculiar binding and/or catalytic properties allow them to fulfill their physiological roles by trimming inactive peptide precursors leading to their active form, converting bioactive peptides into novel ones., inactivating them, thus restraining the continuous activation of specific receptors, or protecting the newly generated bioactive peptide from further degradation, suggesting a peptide chaperon-like activity. TOP, a ubiquitous cytosolic oligopeptidase, is a remarkable example of how this enzyme could play an essential role in immune defense against cancer cells. It has also been successfully used as a hook to fish novel bioactive peptides from cytosol of cells. The involvement of peptides in cell-cell interactions and in neuropsychiatric, autoimmune, and neurovegetative diseases are waiting for peptidomics and gene silencing approaches, which will expedite the formation of new concepts in an emerging era for oligopeptidases. The participation of oligopeptidases in a number of pathologies has long been reported. The ACE has benefited the most from a thorough knowledge on the enzyme structure and its mechanism of catalysis leading to the better understanding of its role in cardiovascular pathologies and therapeutics. Accordingly, for over 30 years, the treatment of human arterial hypertension has taken advantage of ACE inhibition by active site-directed inhibitors like captopril, enalapril, lisinopril, and others. For the other oligopeptidases, especially those involved in human diseases, the existing studies are promising but not yet as developed as for the ACE. Some examples are: a) the POP of nervous tissues has been suggested to be involved in neuropsychiatric disorders, like in post-traumatic stress, depression, mania, nervous bulimia, anorexia, and schizophrenia, as reviewed in. b) NEP has been involved in cancer;[Maguer-Satta V, Besan√ßon R, Bachelard-Cascale E (2011). Concise Review: Neutral Endopeptidase (NEP/CD10): a Multifaceted Environment Actor in Stem Cells, Physiological Mechanisms and Cancer. Stem Cells Jan 7; see www.StemCells.com for supporting information available online] c) the TOP has been involved in tuberculosis and in cancer; d) the EOPA or NUDEL/EOPA (NDEL1/EOPA gene product) has been involved in neuronal migration during the cortex formation in human embryo (lissencephaly) and neurite outgrowth in adults, as in schizophrenia. Coincidentally, an activity related to the development of nervous tissue has been suggested for POP, nevertheless not involving its proteolytic activity. The absence of an oligopeptidase in the intestine was also responsible for the decreased serum zinc levels observed in patients who have the disease Acrodermatitis Enteropathica.

LundyODMP.org, William D. Lundy on December 9, 1932. Initially, officials held 10 youths in custody on suspicion of killing the officer.\\"Hold ten, hunt one in slaying of policeman,\\" Chicago Tribune, December 11, 1932, p. 17. Some 11¬Ω years later in 1944, following the intervention of Chicago Times reporters John McPhaul\\"McPhaul; investigative reporting won accolades,\\" obituary in Chicago Tribune, Aug. 8, 1983, p. 12: \\"But the biggest story he worked on was the Joseph Majczek case ... In 1944 McPhaul, then at the Chicago Times, a predecessor of the Sun-Times, collaborated with reporter James McGuire after an ad was placed in the paper by Majczek's mother.\\" and James McGuire, both men were exonerated of the crime. The real killers have never been identified. The details of the case formed the basis of the 1948 film Call Northside 777 starring James Stewart, Lee J. Cobb and Richard Conte. Background On October 10, 1944, a classified advertisement appeared in the Chicago Times: \\"$5,000 REWARD FOR KILLERS OF OFFICER LUNDY ON DEC. 9, 1932. CALL GRO 1758, 12-7 P.M.\\" The ad was brought to the attention of the city editor Karin Walsh, who assigned seasoned police reporter James McGuire to dig into the story further. McGuire researched the case and learned that Officer Lundy had been murdered on December 9, 1932, and that Joseph Majczek, 24, and Theodore Marcinkiewicz, 25, were convicted in 1933 at the Cook County Superior Court. The convictions (which the Illinois Supreme Court had affirmed as People v. Majczek, 360 Ill. 261 (1935)) were based largely on the testimony of eyewitness Vera Walush. She was recorded as the proprietor of a \\"delicatessen\\" (a euphemism for a speakeasy) where the crime occurred. Though both defendants presented strong alibis based on a number of witnesses saying they were elsewhere when the crime took place, both were convicted. Upon calling the number from the ad, McGuire reached Majczek's mother, Tillie. McGuire realized there was potential for a human interest story developing when he learned that the $5,000 on offer had been earned by the mother scrubbing floors at the Commonwealth Edison Company. Criminal case McGuire first suspected there may have been a wrongful conviction when he learned that Majczek and Marcinkiewicz had not gone to the electric chair for the officer's murder but were sentenced to 99 years\\"Two Get 99 Years for Police Slaying. Jury Refuses State Demand That Pair Die,\\" Chicago Tribune, Nov. 11, 1933, p. 1. each at Joliet. This might have indicated that the trial judge had concerns about their convictions. On October 11, McGuire read notes that Majczek had written in prison. In these, Majczek stated that following his conviction, the trial judge, Charles P. Molthrop, told Majczek that he believed a miscarriage of justice had occurred and promised him a new trial. Additionally, Majczek stated that a certain James Zagata witnessed Molthrop's admission. Zagata was a witness to the murder and believed the wrong men had been convicted. McGuire was uncertain of the veracity of a judge having a private conversation with a convicted murderer--especially one convicted of killing a policeman. But no retrial had taken place, as Judge Molthrop died in 1935. McGuire went in search of Zagata and located him, still employed as a coal truckdriver and very cooperative. Zagata fully corroborated Majczek's account of the conversation in Molthrop's chambers. Zagata had been presented with a police lineup including Majczek but had been unable to positively identify Majczek. He restated this at the later trial. Subsequently, Zagata told the Times, he thought neither of the convicted men fit his recollection of the killers. He was certain that the true killers had been much taller than the short-statured Majczek. Zagata also said that Judge Molthrop had requestioned him a few days after the verdict--the judge was particularly interested in Zagata's issues with the identification. Zagata recalled the judge's saying he was going to get a retrial for the two men. Prohibition and politics In the following days, the Times disclosed that Vera Walush, whose testimony had been the sole evidence against Majczek and the principal evidence against Marcinkiewicz, had initially not recognised either man during the police lineup. The paper also reported that Walush had been running a speakeasy and that she had been threatened with arrest if she refused to testify against Majczek and Marcinkiewicz. They also reported that the reason Judge Molthrop had failed to grant the defendants new trials was that he had been warned by prosecutors that granting a new trial would end his career in politics. Cop killings often led to strong pressure for a conviction, especially with the spiraling murder rate of Prohibition-era Chicago. The same week Officer Lundy had been killed, there were five other unsolved murders in Chicago. Falsified records Further digging led McGuire to learn how Majczek and Marcinkiewicz had become suspects. Vera Walush had initially been unable to identify the killer, but after hours of interrogation she said one them could have been a man she knew only as Ted. Police believed this to be a local man, Theodore Marcinkiewicz, and he became a prime suspect but could not be located. Two weeks after the crime, a bootlegger was arrested, and in exchange for not being charged, he told police that Marcinkiewicz had been staying with the Majczek family. The police raided the Majczek home on December 22, 1932, and though Marcinkiewicz wasn't there, they took Joseph Majczek into custody. Majczek asserted that Vera Walush had not identified him in two separate lineups on December 22, but by December 23 Walush was able to positively identify him. The police then wrote a false report stating that Majczek had been arrested on December 23, the day Walush had identified him. Walush later positively identified Marcinkiewicz when he surrendered on January 23, 1933. Walker Butler McGuire located the original arrest report corroborating Majczek's contention that he had been arrested on December 22. When the State's Attorney's Office refused to reopen the case based on McGuire's new evidence, the Times hired well-known lawyer Walker Butler to seek a pardon for Majczek, ignoring the similarly situated Marcinkiewicz. In addition to claims that Majczek appeared to have been framed, Butler also developed a substantial claim that Majczek's trial attorney, W.W. O'Brien, had performed incompetently. Key witnesses of dubious credibility provided damaging testimony against Marcinkiewicz. One of these, Bessie Barron, claimed Marcinkiewicz had told her he was going to rob Walush's speakeasy. The other, Bruno Uginchus, testified that after the murder Marcinkiewicz said \\"he had a little trouble.\\" Whilst neither of these statements related to Majczek, O'Brien failed to object to their admission. O'Brien also failed to cross-examine Vera Walush on her initial inability to identify him. These issues had not been raised on appeal because O'Brien handled it as well. Exoneration On August 15, 1945, Majczek received a full pardon based on innocence from Illinois Governor Dwight H. Green.\\"Mother's love wins a pardon for convict, 37,\\" Chicago Tribune, August 16, 1945, p. 25. However, Marcinkiewicz remained locked up. He was legally exonerated through a state habeas corpus proceeding in 1950. Life Magazine photographed Majczek, Marcinkiewicz and McGuire all leaving the jail house together. Both men were later compensated by special appropriations ‚Äî $24,000 for Majczek and $35,000 for Marcinkiewicz. Majczek died in 1983 aged 73.

It is about southeast of Baker City on U.S. Route 30, slightly bypassed by Interstate 84. Pleasant Valley was a way station on the Place Toll Road in 1865, and later a freight station on the railroad in 1884. Early Oregon Trail settlers farmed in the area. Pleasant Valley post office was established in 1868 and operated for only two months. An office with the same name was established in 1890 and closed in 1962. According to the authors of Oregon Geographic Names, the community later consisted only of a motel and a Union Pacific Railroad station. By 2001, the motel had been converted into a residence. The Pleasant Valley area is the home of several stone quarries that supplied the tuff stone commonly used for building material in Baker City. At one time Pleasant Valley was a community with enough population and settled arable land surrounding it to warrant a school district. School District #12 was organized by superintendent W. F. Payton in 1874, with a two-room school house serving grades 1 through 8. The district added classes for high-school- age students for a few years before consolidating with the Baker City school district in 1949. The third and last schoolhouse was constructed of the nearby native stone and was later converted to a residence. In 1900, the community had a Christian Church congregation.

Israel alleged that he is a Hamas weapons engineer. In February 2011, he traveled to Ukraine, his wife's native country, to apply for citizenship, after coming to believe that Gaza was no longer a safe place to raise his six children. He disappeared in Poltava on February 19, and later turned up in an Israeli prison after being kidnapped by Israeli intelligence personnel.http://ukrpress.net/node/1726 On April 4, 2011 he was indicted for his aid to Hamas and was convicted on March 30, 2015 in a plea bargain. He is known by Israeli security services as the ‚Äúfather of the rockets‚Äù. Hamas career Abu Sisi was recruited into Hamas in 2002 by Sheikh Nizar Rayan. He was asked by Salah Shehade to work to develop weapons for Hamas. Working under Mohammed Deif \\"Abu Sisi was responsible for electrical engineering and dealt mostly with developing boosters and fins that stabilized and enhanced rocket propulsion. These are two factors that are key for increasing a rocket's range and subsequent penetration of a target. In 2005, Abu Sisi was asked by the committee to begin working on increasing the range of rockets that were manufactured domestically in the Gaza Strip. Due to his involvement with Hamas, he was able to increase the range of the rockets from six to nine kilometers, and subsequently to 15 kilometers. In 2007, Abu Sisi assisted Hamas in increasing range of rockets to 22 kilometers. He was then asked by Hamas to increase the range to between 37 and 45 kilometers, and participated in several experiments during which rockets were tested and fired into the Mediterranean.\\" Under a command from Mohammed Deif and Ahmed Jabari, Abu Sisi founded a military academy that taught \\"military tactics and techniques,\\" and \\"human resources management, time management, crisis management, and general administration.\\" Abduction On the evening of February 18, after formally filing the papers for citizenship, Abu Seesi was traveling by train to the Kiev airport for a reunion with his brother Yussef, who was residing in the Netherlands and whom he had not seen in 15 years. Just outside the city of Poltava, two men, who the family believes were Ukrainian security agents, entered the train and removed Dirar. After that, he disappeared. His wife Veronika, who was in Ukraine at the time as well, did not hear from him for a week. During that period of silence, she summoned the Ukrainian press and made allegations that the Mossad had kidnapped him. On February 27, the Palestinian Interior Ministry demanded that the Ukrainian Interior Ministry disclose the reasons for his disappearance. Dalia Kerstein, executive director of the Israeli human rights NGO, HaMoked, confirmed that the Gazan engineer was in an Israeli prison. Kerstein identified Abu Seesi‚Äôs Israeli attorney Michal Orkabi, who confirmed that she represented him, but she could provide no further information due to a security gag order imposed by the Petah Tikva Magistrates' Court preventing her from speaking about the case. On March 20, the gag order was partially lifted with Israel admitting it was holding Abu Seesi. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees became involved in the case when it determined that Abu Seesi was classified as a refugee. An Associated Press article revealed that the UNHCR's Ukrainian representative asked Ukraine to account for any role its own officials may have played in the disappearance. Veronika Abu Seesi claims that Israel kidnapped him because he was the ‚Äúbrain of the power system‚Äù and that he had rebuilt it himself after it was destroyed during Operation Cast Lead in 2009. The Wall Street Journal and Washington Post both reported that Abu Seesi had devised a technique, enabling the plant to rely solely on diesel fuel supplied by Egypt that could fully power the plant and enabling it to bypass Israel as its sole source of fuel to run the plant. The German weekly Der Spiegel indicated that Abu Seesi's abduction was owing to information he had in relation to missing Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who was being held by Palestinian militants in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a live interview with YouTube World View and Channel Two News, said that Abu Seesi is a Hamas man being held in Israel, and he disclosed valuable information. Israeli officials were insinuating earlier that Abu Seesi was involved in weaponry for Hamas. Trial On April 4, 2011, Abu Seesi was indicted in the Beersheba District Court, charged with \\"membership in a terrorist organization, conspiracy to commit a crime, and the production of illegal weaponry, assistance to an illegal organization and other various crimes\\". According to the indictment, Abu Seesi was the central developer of the Qassam rocket, among other rockets and anti-tank missiles, was responsible for upgrading older rockets for Hamas and served as the commander of Hamas' Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Military Academy. On March 30, 2015, Abu Seesi was convicted in the Beersheba District Court after pleading guilty as part of a bargain arrangement. As part of the deal, the prosecution asked for 21 years imprisonment. While the charges of attempted murder were dropped, other charges such as planning to commit murder, producing weapons, and activity in a terror organization, remained. In July 2015, Abu Seesi was sentenced to 21 years in prison.http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4680012,00.html See also *List of kidnappings *List of solved missing persons cases  References   External links  * Where's Dirar * Benjamin Bidder, Ulrike Putz and Holger Stark, The Long Arm of Mossad: A Palestinian Disappears in Ukraine, Der Spiegel, March 29, 2011 * Gabriel Gatehouse, Israel, Ukraine and the mysterious case of Dirar Abu Sisi, BBC News, August 24, 2011 1969 births 2000s missing person cases Formerly missing people Israel‚ÄìUkraine relations Kidnapped people Living people Missing person cases in Ukraine Palestinian engineers Palestinian people imprisoned by Israel People from the Gaza Strip People imprisoned on charges of terrorism ","title":"Dirar Abu Seesi"},{"id":"31165574","text":"Nic Jones is an album by Nic Jones, released in 1971.Notes by Dave and Toni Arthur Track listing #\\"The Lass Of London City\\" 2:08 #\\"Napoleon's Lamentation\\" 2:53 #\\"The Bonny Bunch Of Roses\\" 6:05 #\\"Edward\\" 3:29 #\\"The Outlandish Knight\\" 3:35 #\\"William And Nancy's Parting\\" 1:31 #\\"Lord Bateman\\" 4:11 #\\"Dance To Your Daddy\\" 2:17 #\\"The Two Brothers\\" 3:52 #\\"The Banks Of Green Willow\\" 2:51 References 1971 albums Nic Jones albums ","title":"Nic Jones (album)"},{"id":"31165577","text":"The Kanmailia are a Muslim community found in the state of Uttar Pradesh in India.

She was launched in 1806. In 1807 she took part in one notable single- ship action and was at the capture of Copenhagen. In 1815 she spent six months with the West Africa Squadron suppressing the slave trade during which time she captured ten slavers and freed 500-1000 slaves. She was wrecked in 1816, though with no loss of life. Canaries She was commissioned in October 1806 under her first captain, Conway Shipley. The following year her boats executed cutting-out operations in the Canaries. On 15 March 1807 her boats, under the command of Lieutenant George Edward Watts, entered \\"Puerto de Haz\\" [sic], Grand Canaria, which was defended by the crossfire of three shore batteries. The British succeeded in bringing out six Spanish brigs (one armed with five guns), three with cargoes of salt pork, salt fish, or wine and fruit, and three in ballast. The only British casualty was a lieutenant, who was wounded. That month Comus also captured two brigs, the St Philip, with salt fish, and Nostra Senora de los Remedies, with a mixed cargo of merchandise. On 8 May Comus sent her boats into the harbour of Gran Canaria, which was defended by a strong fort and two shore batteries. There they cut out a large armed felucca, which was flying His Catholic Majesty's colours. The boarding party, under the command of Lieutenant Watts, cleared her deck of her crew and the boats started to pull her out (the Spaniards had taken the precaution of removing her rudder and sails and taking them on shore), when a tug-of-war developed as men on the quay pulled on a hawser. Eventually the boarding party cut the hawser and the boats succeeded in pulling the felucca out, an operation they conducted under fire. The felucca was the packet ship San Pedro de Apostol, which had been carrying bale goods from Cadiz to Buenos Ayres. On her way, San Pedro de Apostol had captured the Lord Keith, which had been sailing from London to Mogador. The British lost one man killed and five men wounded, one of whom was Watts, who had been severely wounded. The Spanish casualties included her captain and some crew killed, and 21 men taken prisoner, of whom 19 were wounded. The Lloyd's Patriotic Fund awarded Watts a sword worth ¬£50. The prize money was substantial too. In May, Comus captured the Spanish lugger St Francisco, with her cargo of wheat and salt. The other capture was the schooner Louisa, a completely new vessel sailing in ballast. Comus vs. HDMS Fridericksv√¶rn Comus was under Captain Edward Heywood from July 1807, and in August she was with the expedition to Copenhagen. During this service she took part in a notable, illegal and ultimately one-sided single-ship action, and accumulated substantial prize money. On 12 August the 32-gun Danish frigate (Fredrickscoarn in British usage), sailed for Norway from Elsinor and Admiral Lord Gambier sent the 74-gun third rate and Comus after her, even though war had not yet been declared.James (1837), Vol. 4, pp.226-8. Comus was faster than Defence in the light winds and so outdistanced her. On 14 August 1807 Comus sighted Frederiksv√¶rn and chased her, catching up off Marstrand a little before midnight on the 15th. Heywood ordered the Frederiksv√¶rn to halt and allow herself to be detained. War not having been declared, and Frederiksv√¶rn being a naval vessel, she ignored Heywood's instructions. Heywood ordered a musket fired, to which Frederiksv√¶rn replied with a shot from her stern guns. Comus followed with a broadside. After an action of 45 minutes, Frederiksv√¶rns rigging was disabled. Comus and Frederiksv√¶rn then came together, which enabled a boarding party from Comus to climb over Frederiksv√¶rns bow and capture her. The two vessels had been relatively evenly matched in firepower. Comuss broadside weighed 204 pounds, while Frederiksv√¶rns broadside weighed 200 pounds. However, Frederiksv√¶rn had a crew of 226 men to Comuss 145 men. Still, the British had suffered only one man wounded. The Danes lost 12 men killed and 20 wounded, some mortally. The Royal Navy took her into service as . In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"Comus 15 Augt. 1807\\", to all surviving claimants from the action. Defence and Comus then sailed in search of a Danish 74-gun reported to be returning to Copenhagen, but did not find her.This was HDMS Prinds Christian Frederik, which remained at Kristiansand, in Norway. The Royal Navy would capture her in the Battle of Zealand Point. On 18 August Comus captured the Danish merchant vessel Haabet. Comus went on to participate in the capitulation of Copenhagen on 7 September and to share in the prize money for that. Comus also shared with in the recapture on the same day of the Britannia. Three days later Comus shared with and in the capture of the Danish merchant vessel Fredeus Forsward. Later that month, on 9 September, Comus and Pelican captured the Danish merchant vessel Elizabeth vonder Pahlen, but had to share with Defence, which was in sight. Three days after that, on 2 October, Comus and Pelican captured the Danish merchant vessel Anna Catherina. Subsequent service Captain Josceline Percy took command in November 1807, and sailed to Portugal later that month. There Comus participated in the occupation of Madeira by Sir Samuel Hood.Josceline Percy at Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Here her primary task was to reconnoiter the island. She returned to Hood's fleet on 23 December and the British took unopposed possession the next day.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 33, p.10. Captain Matthew Smith took command in 1808, and Comus continued off the Portuguese coast and in the Mediterranean. On 5 February she captured sundry Danish vessels at St. Ubes (Setubal, Portugal). The vessels Comus captured were the Ovenum, Martha Beata, Aufgehende Sonne, Finegheden, Johannes, Soe Blomstedt, Speculation, Haabet, Fortuna, Bragernes and Magdalena. The initial distribution of prize money amounted to ¬£12,000. Given the small size of her crew, this resulted in a notable amount even for an ordinary seaman. On 27 February 1808 she captured the American brig Fame. On 20 February 1811 Comus was part of a flotilla of English warships and Spanish transports under the command of Rear-Admiral Sir Richard Godwin Keats. The flotilla was waiting to land some British troops and 7,000 Spanish troops at Tariffa. The weather did not permit the landing so instead the British troops landed at Algeciras and marched to Tariffa, later being joined by the Spanish troops when the transports could sail.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 25, pp.338-40. On 10 May 1812, Smith, on behalf of the British government, signed a treaty of commerce with His Highness Sidi Jusef Caramanli, Bashaw, Bey, Governor and Captain General of the City and Kingdom of Tripoli in the West.Great Britain. Foreign and Commonwealth Office (1841) British and foreign state papers. Volume 1, Part 1, pp.731-3. (H. M. S. O.) On 14 May 1813 Comus captured the American brig Jane Barnes. In late March Comus was at Hellevoetsluis to transport French coins that Nathan Rothschild had collected. Rothschild had a contract to deliver ¬£600,000 to the south of France by 14 March. By the time Comus and were able to deliver to Bordeaux the ¬£450,000 that Rothschild had gathered Napoleon had abdicated. Comus was under Captain John Tailour from November 1814, during which time she served in the {West Africa Squadron. During her service with the Squadron, Comus captured eleven vessels, all of which the Vice admiralty court at Freetown condemned, though the London Commission later reversed four condemnations.Grindal (2016), Appendix A: \\"Suspected Slave Vessels Detained 1807-39 by Royal Navy Cruisers, Colonial Vessels and Letters of Marque Vessels\\". On 16 March 1815 Comus captured the Portuguese slave schooner Dos Amigos off Old Calabar River; she landed one slave. Next, on 25 March, Comus was at Duke Town where she captured the Spanish schooners Nuestra Senora del Carmen (120 slaves) and Intrepida (or Intrepide; 245 slaves), and the brig Catalina (no slaves). Among the slaves Comus did free there were 54 boys and 47 girls.Miscellaneous Paper, (1818), Vol. 17, p.305. Catalina arrived at Portsmouth, in ballast, on 20 October.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ5016. Comus also captured two Portuguese vessels, Bon Sorte (61 slaves), and the schooner Estrella (41 slaves). The London Commission reversed the condemnation of Bon Sorte. Next, Comus captured two Portuguese vessels. On 3 April she captured the brig Santa Anna (three slaves) at Old Calabar River. On 23 April Comus captured the schooner Maria Madelena (no slaves), off \\"Princes Island\\". The London Commission reversed the condemnation of Santa Anna. Comus appears to have been the first warship to have sailed up the Calabar River as far as Duke Town. By one account her boats captured seven Portuguese and Spanish slavers carrying some 550 slaves. First though, they had to overcome the slavers' determined resistance, which resulted in some bloodshed.Marshall (1835), Vol. 4, Part 2, p.129. In June Comus captured the Portuguese schooner Novo Fragantina (no slaves) at Anamabo. Then on 15 July at Cape Palmas Comus captured both the Portuguese brigantine Abismo and the Spanish schooner Palafox, neither of which was carrying slaves. The London Commission reversed the condemnation of both Portuguese vessels. Captain Thomas Tucker had succeeded Tailour by 1816, and Captain James Gordon Bremer succeeded Tucker. Fate Comus was wrecked at St Mary's Bay, off Cape Pine, Newfoundland on 24 October 1816. At around midnight she grounded and developed leaks. The crew abandoned her around 3am when she threatened to roll over on her side as the tide receded. Subsequent efforts to refloat her were unsuccessful. The wreck was abandoned on 4 November 1816. The subsequent court martial blamed the wrecking on a strong current that had driven her closer to shore than Bremer had realized. However, the court also warned Bremer and the master, Bateman Ainsworth, to be more careful in the future, finding that they had been overconfident in their navigation and had failed to take frequent depth soundings. The court added that Bremer, his officers and his crew were due the greatest praise \\"for their arduous exertions in their endeavours to save her, and also for their good and steady conduct throughout the business, both in the boats and on shore.\\"Naval Chronicle, Vol.36, p.511.

Both of these organizations focus more on research and the one research reactor located in Ghana than on nuclear power. The government of Ghana is committed to the development of nuclear power as an environmentally- friendly energy source, and as of 2020 is undertaking preparatory steps for nuclear energy generation. President John Agyekum Kufuor supported the future building of nuclear power plants, seeing it as part of a solution to the country's energy problems. He initiated a Nuclear Power Committee to study the issue. In 2011, the director of the National Nuclear Research Institute, Benjamin Nyarko, also said he believed nuclear power could prevent future energy crises. The ministry has created a section to co-ordinate activities on the nuclear power project. The Russian state-owned atomic energy corporation Rosatom signed a 'Memorandum of Understanding' with Ghana in August 2015 to develop a 1200 Megawatt reactor in Ghana- however, as the total energy production in the country at the time was only 2831MW, significant upgrades to the nation's energy grid would be necessary to accommodate it. In January 2017, the IAEA concluded an eight-day mission to Ghana to review the country's infrastructure and in preparation for selecting international vendors. A follow-up mission in October 2019 concluded that significant progress had been made, and that Ghana would soon be ready to discuss its options with international partners.

It serves southwestern Nebraska and northwestern Kansas. The newspaper is issued five days a week, Monday through Friday afternoons. As of 2011, it had a circulation of 4,564. The paper was founded in 1911 by Harry D. Strunk and Burris H. Stewart as the Red Willow Gazette. Thirteen years later, under Strunk's editorship, it became a daily and changed its name to the McCook Daily Gazette. In 1929, the newspaper became one of the first in the world to be delivered regularly by air: for several months its airplane, the Newsboy, flew a daily route, dropping bundles of newspapers to carriers in outlying towns. An image of the Newsboy still decorates the paper's nameplate. Strunk published the Gazette until his death in 1960, when he was succeeded by his son Allen Strunk. In 1986, the paper was acquired by Gozia-Driver Media, which was later re-incorporated as US Media Group. In 1997, the Gazette was sold to Rust Communications. History The paper's founder, Harry D. Strunk, was born in 1892 in Pawnee City, Nebraska. In 1906, at the age of 14, he was forced by family circumstances to quit school and go to work as a printer's devil (an apprentice) for the Pawnee City Republican. A year later, he moved to Fairbury, Nebraska, but at the age of 16, when the editor of the Republican fell ill, he returned to Pawnee City and published the newspaper for three months until the editor's recovery. Strunk continued to move from newspaper to newspaper; in 1909, at the age of 17, he was shop foreman of the Norton, Kansas Daily Telegram, overseeing ten typesetters. Later in 1909, Strunk set off for the West Coast. En route, he saw and responded to an advertisement seeking a printer for the weekly McCook Tribune. Nine months later, he and fellow Tribune employee Burris H. Stewart started their own job-printing shop, \\"with so few assets that they were forced to borrow money to buy ink\\". Six months later, in 1911, the two launched their own newspaper: the semi-weekly Red Willow Gazette, again with no assets and with heavy debts. Distressed by their financial situation, Stewart committed suicide on the day of the paper's second issue. Strunk persevered, and the paper proved successful. In 1914, it acquired a Linotype, the first between Hastings, Nebraska and Denver, Colorado; McCook became the smallest city in Nebraska to possess one. In 1924, the paper changed its name to the present McCook Daily Gazette and began daily publication; again, McCook became the smallest city in Nebraska with a daily newspaper. In 1926, the operation moved to a new building on Main Street, its facade inscribed with the paper's motto: \\"Service is the rent we pay for the space we occupy in this world.\\" The Newsboy In the 1920s, the spread of the automobile and the improvement of roads in the United States made it easier for rural residents to do their shopping in larger towns farther from their homes. This gave merchants an incentive to advertise in newspapers that reached such residents. However, delivering the papers in a timely fashion became a problem for the publishers. The U.S. Mail was expensive, since postage rates for newspapers had been raised drastically by the War Revenue Act of 1917; it also took several days for the papers to reach some customers. In more developed parts of the country, publishers delivered papers by truck to local carriers in outlying towns. However, the improvement of roads in the McCook area was slower than in more densely populated areas. By 1929, U.S. Highway 38 (now U.S. Highway 6) had not yet been fully gravelled in southwestern Nebraska, and most roads off the main highways were impassable in bad weather. The Newsboy, displayed in the Seattle Museum of Flight Strunk's solution was to go by air. In 1929, he paid $8,000 for a Curtiss Robin C1 two- seater monoplane, christened the Newsboy. On September 13, 1929, air delivery began. The Newsboy flew a nonstop three-hour route covering , passing over more than 40 communities in southwestern Nebraska and northwestern Kansas. At each town, a bundle of papers was dropped from a height of onto a prearranged field, where it was picked up by local carriers. Papers were delivered as far west as Benkelman, Nebraska, from McCook; east to Orleans, Nebraska, away; and south to Atwood, Kansas, distant. Beside delivering papers to far-flung communities, the Newsboy served to promote the Gazette. Interest in aviation was still strong after Charles Lindbergh's celebrated 1927 solo flight from New York to Paris. The newspaper offered a ride in the airplane to every two- year subscriber. It also opened a flying school: the pilot of the Newsboy would give flying lessons in the morning, then deliver the day's papers in the afternoon. To emphasize the newspaper's connection with aviation, a new nameplate was introduced, with wings behind the name and airplanes on either side. Whether or not because of the airplane, the circulation of the Gazette increased from 2800 in 1928 to 4500 in 1930. Delivery by air lasted for less than a year. In May 1930, the Newsboy was damaged by high winds while parked at the McCook airport. Strunk opted not to repair it and return it to service, citing \\"week after week of inclement weather, during which time we have found it impossible to fly our route on schedule\\". The airplane was not yet built, he wrote, that could \\"fly successfully in rain, wind, sleet, snow and fog.\\" A few major metropolitan newspapers had made short-term experiments with air delivery in 1928 and 1929. However, the months-long effort by the Gazette made it the first newspaper to conduct regular deliveries by air. After the Newsboy was taken out of service, it was sold and restored several times. In 1972, it was placed on display at the Museum of Flight in Seattle. 1930‚Äì1960 The end of the aviation experiment forced the Gazette to return to ground-based delivery. Newspapers for outlying communities were transported there on commercial buses running through McCook; local carriers picked them up at their towns' bus stops. Same-day delivery was no longer possible for subscribers in communities off the main highways; they had to settle for next- day delivery. In 1934, the Gazette absorbed the South Side Sentinel of Marion, Nebraska. In 1936, it acquired the triweekly McCook Tribune, at which Strunk had worked on his arrival in McCook. Later, in 1957, it absorbed the Red Willow County Reporter. A Newsboy in 2011 On the eve of World War II, the Gazette acquired one of the last teletypesetters manufactured. With this machine, the paper could be produced with only two printers; this allowed it to remain in production at a time when Linotype operators were in short supply because of the war. The Gazette made a second attempt at air delivery in 1950. For four years, a Cessna 120 was used to deliver papers to outlying communities. The high cost of operating the airplane, and the increasing availability of good roads for ground delivery, ended the venture. The plane was replaced by a fleet of small trucks and automobiles, all of which continued to bear the name Newsboy. After the Republican River flood of 1935, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducted a study of the river's watershed. Released in 1940, it concluded that there were no good dam sites upstream from Republican City, Nebraska, where the Harlan County Dam is now located. Since 112 deaths and the bulk of the property damage caused by the flood had occurred in the upper Republican valley, which includes McCook, the report led to dissatisfaction among residents of the area. Strunk and three others formed the Republican Valley Conservation Association, which lobbied aggressively for the development of a flood-control program for the entire basin; the Gazette provided office space to the organization. The RVCA's efforts led to the construction of a number of dams in the area: one on the Republican at Trenton, Nebraska, and several on tributaries of the river in Nebraska and Kansas. One of the latter was built on Medicine Creek in Frontier County, Nebraska; the reservoir behind it has been named Harry Strunk Lake. After 1960 Gazette building, 2011 Harry Strunk published the Gazette until his death in 1960, after which his son Allen Strunk succeeded him. Under Allen Strunk, the newspaper made the conversion from letterpress to offset printing. At the end of 1986, the Strunk family sold the newspaper to Gozia-Driver Media, which was later re-incorporated as US Media Group. Allen Strunk was succeeded as publisher by Dick Gozia and John Burgess, who occupied the position from 1987 to 1990, followed by Gene Morris, who became publisher in 1990. In 1997, the Gazette was acquired by Rust Communications. In 2002, it launched a weekly shopper, the \\"Big Nickel\\", inserted in the Friday newspaper and distributed free from racks throughout the newspaper's circulation area. Upon Gene Morris's retirement in 2007, general manager Shary Skiles was named publisher. In 2009, the newspaper ended Saturday publication, moving to a schedule of five issues a week, released on Monday through Friday afternoons. The circulation of the Gazette has declined in the 21st century. In 2001, the Nebraska Press Association listed it as 6,709. In 2005, a report by the Knight Foundation gave it as \\"approximately 5,903\\". In 2011, the Nebraska Press Association's website listed the number as 4,564.

It was imposed in 1845 to support the Colorado Party in the Uruguayan Civil War and closed Buenos Aires to naval commerce. The Anglo- French navy trespassed into Argentina‚Äôs internal waters to sell their products, as Rosas maintained a protectionist policy to improve the weak Argentine economy. Eventually both Britain and France gave in, signing treaties in 1849 (Britain) and 1850 (France) acknowledging the Argentine sovereignty over its rivers. Cady, 1929. Antecedents =Local context= Buenos Aires faced the French blockade of the R√≠o de la Plata between 1838 and 1840. The Peru‚ÄìBolivian Confederation, allied with France, declared the War of the Confederation on Argentina. Rosas resisted the blockade longer than France estimated he would do, and his strategy of generating disputes between France and England over the blockade eventually bore fruit. France lifted the blockade in 1840, exchanging mutual most favoured nation status between her and the Argentine Confederation. Unable to deploy French troops during the blockade, France promoted civil wars against Rosas to support the naval actions. For this purpose, France aided Fructuoso Rivera against the Uruguayan president Manuel Oribe, who was forced to resign. Oribe escaped to Buenos Aires, and Rosas received him as the legitimate president of Uruguay, denying such recognition to Rivera. This started the Uruguayan Civil War, where the Blancos sought to restore Oribe in power and the Colorados to keep Rivera. As Rivera was hesitant to attack Rosas as the French expected, the Argentine expatriate Juan Lavalle was convinced to do so, but his army bolstered by French troops was nevertheless weakened by desertions and hostility from the local population on their march to Buenos Aires, and French monetary support was curtailed, as France conducted negotiated peace with Rosas by that time.LA GUERRA FRANCO-ARGENTINA - (1838-1840) Lavalle's army retreated to the north in disorder, without attacking Buenos Aires as intended. Rivera's ambition was to expand the borders of Uruguay, annexing Paraguay, the Argentine Mesopotamia and the Riograndense Republic (part of Rio Grande do Sul, that had declared independence from Brazil and was fighting the Ragamuffin War), into a projected Federation of Uruguay. The Argentine Jos√© Mar√≠a Paz, allied with Rivera against Rosas, was against this project. Rivera took control of Paz's forces, but without his superior military training, he was completely defeated by Oribe at the battle of Arroyo Grande. Rivera's project never got off the ground, and he was forced to stand in Montevideo against Oribe's siege. Brazil proposed a military alliance to Rosas: Rosas would take Uruguay with Brazilian support, and Brazil would take the Riograndese Republic with Argentine support. Tom√°s Guido, Argentine representative in Brazil, supported the proposal, but Rosas rejected it. Rosas thought that such treaty would violate the Uruguayan sovereignty, and that it would be null if Oribe was not part of it. Hon√≥rio Carneiro Le√£o, representative of Brazil, did not accept Rosas's alternative proposal, and Brazil distanced from Argentina. =International context= Britain did not have great interests at stake in Buenos Aires. The purpose of the war was to foster the Entente cordiale with France, so as to make possible later joint military operations elsewhere, such as the Opium War or the protection of the independence of the Republic of Texas. The British interests in South America grew when Texas was finally annexed by the United States. Texas supplied Britain with cotton, and the British calculated that it would be easier to secure cotton sources in South America (such as Paraguay) rather than waging war with the powerful United States. Britain republished many Uruguayan libels against Rosas, such as the Blood tables, so that people supported military action against him. As there was a strong British religious tradition, Rosas was accused of replacing the crosses of churches with his portrait, persecuting religion, and killing priests; and that he may have murdered his wife Encarnaci√≥n Ezcurra and had incestuous relations with his daughter. Cady, 1929. Two influential French politicians of the time were the foreign minister Fran√ßois Guizot and the nationalist Adolphe Thiers. Thiers proposed that France should continue the hostilities against Rosas. He explained his opinion with three main reasons and an accessory one: humanity, patriotism, international law and expansion of commerce. He viewed Rosas as a ruthless dictator, to justify the humanitarian reason. Although Montevideo was not a French colony, he referred to it as such due to its high population of French Basques. He considered that Rosas would be in contravention of the 4th article of the Mackau-Arana treaty (in which the Confederation recognized the independence of Uruguay) by attempting to impose an Argentine president on it. The expansion of commerce was not mentioned as a main reason, as Rosist protectionist policy limited but did not forbid French imports. Guizot rejected these ideas. He did not consider that Rosas contravened the Mackau- Arana treaty because the Confederation was not actually at war with Uruguay, but was merely supporting one Uruguayan faction against the other. He did not think that the French economy could be further benefited by taking action in La Plata, nor that it was workable to keep a colony in the zone. In respect to humanitarian reasons, he dismissed the purported Rosist crimes because they were based on reports by the Unitarian Florencio Varela, who had no reputation as an impartial reporter. However, Guitoz ultimately agreed to the proposal, in order to foster an alliance with Britain and reduce the popular acclaim of Thiers. Brazilian viscount Miguel Calmon du Pin e Almeida met the British Lord Aberdeen, to request that Brazil join Britain and France in the action against Rosas. But Britain did not have good relations with Brazil at that time, so Aberdeen rejected the Brazilian aid. Aberdeen complained that, if Brazil thought that civilization was tied with free trade, Brazil should accept extending their free trade agreement with Britain before imposing it on Rosas, and that if Brazil was concerned with humanitarian reasons they should start by abolishing slavery in their own country. Then he met Guizot, who was not receptive either. Guizot felt forced by circumstances to join a war where he did not expect to earn anything, and was reluctant to involve French troops in it. Britain would not resort to ground troops either, as the British invasions of the R√≠o de la Plata had proved them ineffective. The viscount informed the Brazilian court of the Anglo-French resolution. The public purposes of the war were to protect the Uruguayan independence against Oribe, defend the recently proclaimed independence of Paraguay, and ended the civil wars at La Plata. He also revealed the secret purposes: To turn Montevideo into a \\"commercial factory\\", to force the free navigation of the rivers, to turn the Argentine Mesopotamia into a new country, to set the borders of Uruguay, Paraguay and the Mesopotamia (without Brazilian intervention), and to help the antirosistas to depose the governor of Buenos Aires and to establish one loyal to the European powers. For the viscount, it was an all-losing situation for Brazil: if the intervention was defeated, they would be helpless against the counter- attack of Rosas, Oribe and perhaps the Ragamuffins; and if the intervention prevailed, Brazil would have neighbors even more powerful than the Confederation. Thus, he strongly advised against joining it, and restoring good relations with Rosas if possible. William Brent, representative of the United States in Buenos Aires and supporter of the Monroe Doctrine, supported Rosas in the dispute with the European powers, and proposed to act as mediator. After the victory at the battle of India Muerta, Oribe was about to enter to Montevideo. Brent proposed that he did so giving an amnesty to the supporters of Rivera, calling to elections in the Legislature, and then the Argentine forces supporting him should leave the country at that point. Oribe accepted, but the British arrived to Montevideo and refused to allow Oribe to enter to the city. Arana, Deffaudis and Ouseley rejected Brent's mediation, and gave an ultimatum: if the army of Oribe and the Argentine navy of William Brown did not leave Uruguay in ten days, they would proceed to block Buenos Aires. Beginning of armed actions The same night the ultimatum was issued, still during the ten days period, the British ship Cadmus and the French one D'Assas anchored next to the Argentine ships San Mart√≠n and 25 de mayo. William Brown requested permission to return to Buenos Aires, which was allowed but with the condition of delivering the British and French sailors. Brown requested permission to do so in Buenos Aires, as most of his crew was Irish, but received no answer. When he finally sailed back to Buenos Aires, he was attacked. The Anglo-French forced boarded and seized the complete Argentine navy, the ships San Mart√≠n, 25 de mayo, General Echag√ºe, Maip√∫ and 9 de julio. The French raised their flag in the first two, and the British did so in the last three. The Argentine officers were returned to Buenos Aires, and William Brown and all the British sailors were forbidden to sail under the Argentine flag during the remainder of the conflict. The following day, the Anglo-French forces disembarked in Montevideo, reinforcing the defenses of the city. Since the defeat at India Muerta, the Montevidean defenders were less than 3 500. Rivera thanked these actions, saying that it secured the Uruguayan independence. Many politicians of Buenos Aires criticized them during a meeting in the Junta of Representatives in Buenos Aires. Rosas learned in 1838 that the Isla Mart√≠n Garc√≠a was difficult to defend, so he removed the forces from it. However, to prevent foreign claims of sovereignty, he left a force of twelve aged crippled soldiers, who would keep the flag of Argentina raised until the end. The only purpose of this army was to assert that the island was not left abandoned, and that the Anglo-French forces would only take it by an invasion. General Lucio Mansilla received the forces and infrastructure of Mart√≠n Garc√≠a, to select a point in the Paran√° River and fortify it. The west side of the river was preferred, to have easier communications with Buenos Aires. However, the support to the Uruguayan Oribe took priority, and no Argentine forces supporting the siege would be retired from it, not even temporarily. Mansilla prepared the defenses at Obligado, Buenos Aires, near San Pedro. =Declaration of blockade= The blockade was formally declared on September 18, 1845. They cited many reasons. They said that Rosas did not stop the war despite their good intentions, or that the capture of the Argentine navy, invasion of Mart√≠n Garc√≠a and reinforcement of Montevideo were described in violent language at Buenos Aires newspapers, which was also found at the meeting of the Junta or in the messages that called the Unitarians savages. A decree of August 27 had forbidden all Argentines to communicate with the Anglo-French navy. They also said that the foreigners in Buenos Aires were abused and drafted into the army, that Oribe made a butchery after the victory at India Muerta, and that the police was headed by the Mazorca, which would make several abuses. The tone was closer to that of a declaration of war, and may have been written by Florencio Varela. Cady, 1929. To counter those claims, Rosas arranged a meeting with diplomats from the United States, Portugal, Sardinia, Bolivia and France. The British diplomat refused to assist, but the French Mareuil did so. All of them declared unanimously that they had no complaints about the treatment to foreigners, that they had no knowledge of foreigners forced by terror into the military or to sign petitions, that they had no knowledge of abuses from the Mazorca, and that the information of alleged butcheries in India Muerta was inexact. Rosas included as well a petition signed by 15 000 British and French living in Buenos Aires, protesting against the blockade. Rosas was confident in that this formal declaration, signed by foreign diplomats, would counter the Montevidean propaganda and turn the international opinion to his side. Dur√°n de Mareuil, representative of French business in Buenos Aires, was among the signatories. He wrote a document requesting the end of the blockade, which included Rosas's demands. Those demands were the inclusion of Oribe in the negotiations, disarm of Montevideo, return of Colonia, Mart√≠n Garc√≠a and the stolen navy, departure from the internal rivers, acknowledgement of the sovereignty of Argentina and an indemnization. As expected, it was rejected in Montevideo, so Mareuil moved to Paris to give it directly to the French government. Uruguay river The Anglo-French navy navigated the internal Uruguay river by mid August, led by Lain√© and Inglefield. They announced that they would block any ports supporting Oribe, and remove the people in them with gunshots. In response, the ports were closed to any communication with the Anglo-French navy. Lain√© and Inglefield moved to Colonia del Sacramento, with Giuseppe Garibaldi and his legion of Italian volunteers. They had a total of 28 ships, whereas Jaime Montoro, colonel defending the city had only 300 soldiers and eight small cannons. The Italian legion disembarked in the city and pillaged it. Jos√© Luis Bustamante blamed Garibaldi for it, while Garibaldi would attribute it to a lack of military discipline among his Legion. He would write in his memoirs that \\"the repression of disorder was difficult, considering that Colonia had plenty of resources, and specially of spirituous liquids that increased the desires of the virtuous pillagers\\". Even the local church was sacked, and the drunk Italians spent the night in it. The navy moved then to Mart√≠n Garc√≠a, 550 French troops defeating the 125-strong army detachment under Colonel Geronimo Costa stationed there.HOMENAJE AL GENERAL GERONIMO COSTA EN LA RECOLETA The flag of Argentina was removed, and replaced with the flag of Uruguay. The Argentine soldiers were removed, and the island was left abandoned. The ship moved then into the Uruguay river. The pillage of Gualeguaych√∫ was even worse than in Colonia, to the point that Bustamante wrote to Rivera worried about Garibaldi, fearing that his actions would discredit the whole operation. Garibaldi described that \\"The city of Gualeguaych√∫ drove us to conquest by being a real emporium of wealth, capable to dress our ragged soldiers and supply us with harnesses. We acquired many and very good horses in Gualeguaych√∫, the clothes needed to dress all the people, the harnesses of cavalry and some money distributed among our poor soldiers and sailors, who suffered so much time of misery and privations\\". Garibaldi's plundering was valued in nearly 30,000 pound sterlings. Garibaldi was defeated at Paysand√∫ by colonel Antonio D√≠az, and then at Concordia, defended by Juan Antonio Lavalleja and an improvised navy. Then, he took control and pillaged Salto. By November, the Anglo-French navy had control of all the Uruguay river from Colonia to Salto. Parana river Once Montevideo had enough defenses, Ouseley and Defauis prepared a convoy to navigate the Parana river. This way they would reach Corrientes and Paraguay and, once having complete control of Uruguay and both rivers, force the Mesopotamia out of the Confederation. The convoy was composed of three steamboats, capable to navigate independently from the winds and a number of heavily armed sailboats. Those ships would protect 90 merchant vessels, of diverse nationalities. Arana notified the foreign diplomats that the ships entering the Paran√° unauthorized would be reputed as pirates, so they informed their respective ships that they would not have protection from their home countries if they got involved in the operation. However, such messages were delayed, and the 90 ships took part of the operation anyway. The Anglo-French weaponry was the most advanced of the time. They used Peysar rifled cannons, and the French brought the new Paixhans guns. The allies also bombarded the Confederation batteries with Congreve rockets. This would be the first time such weapons would be used in South America, and they expected their firepower to be devastating. The convoy stopped at the Paran√° Guaz√∫ channel to study the situation. Initially, the admirals though that they would navigate unopposed, but found that Lucio Mansilla had prepared many fortifications along the river. As a result, the merchant ships would stay behind, while the combat steams open the way. There were fortifications at Ramada, Tonelero, Acevedo, and San Lorenzo. The most important fortification was located in Obligado, near San Pedro. =Battle of Vuelta de Obligado= French and British ships breaking the chains in Obligado. In Obligado the Parana is only 700 m. wide, and the turning made sailboat navigation difficult. Mansilla placed 24 boats in succession, holding three thick chains to close the river. The west coast was the only one fortified, with four batteries. The biggest Argentine cannons were of caliber 20, whereas the average in the Anglo-French navy was of 80. The land was defended by the Regiment of Patricians, and the volunteers from the countryside were led by Facundo Quiroga (son of the famed caudillo of the same name). Many artilleries were operated by British sailors from the captured Argentine fleet, who disobeyed the orders of not fighting against their home country. A brig of six cannons was the only Argentine combat vessel. Cady, 1929. The first steam boats arrived to Obligado on November 18, stopping beyond the range of the cannons. They waited for the stolen San Mart√≠n ship, captained by Trehouart, who arrived the following day. The attack was delayed one more day, because the rain did not allow a clear sight of the fortifications. The ships advanced on November 20. Lucio Mansilla arranged the troops saying: There they are! Consider the insult they make to the sovereignty of our nation by navigating, with no more title than force, the waters of a river that flows across the territory of our country. But they won't achieve that unpunished! Let the blue and white banner wave in the Parana, and let's all of us die before seeing it come down from where it waves! The first ship to advance was the San Mart√≠n. She was about to break the chains when the wind suddenly ended and she got stuck in the place, too far from the other ships, which could not got near because of the lack of wind. The San Mart√≠n was hit more than a hundred times, two cannons were destroyed, and two officers and forty sailors died. Finally, the chain of San Mart√≠n‚Äôs anchor was broken, and she moved down the river. The Dolphin and Pandour had to retreat as well. Battle of Vuelta de Obligado When the Republicano (es) ran out of ammunition, the captain blew it to prevent it from being captured. At this point, the steamboats (unaffected by the lack of wind) proceeded to the chains. Their powerful guns outranged the Argentine cannons. The Fulton got to the chains and broke them, and the wind blew again. The ships moved, and the defenses gradually ran out of ammunition as well. By the end of the day, all batteries were destroyed, and the cannons were destroyed or taken as trophies. 250 Argentine soldiers died, and 400 were injured. The Anglo-French fleet stayed 40 days in Obligado, making repairs. =Consequences of Obligado= Word of the actions in Obligado spread around the continent. Most of the press, that so far had repeated the Montevidean libels, turned instead to support Rosas. Brazilian newspapers such as O Brado de Amazonas and O Sentinella da Monarchia referred to Rosas as a great South American hero. Francisco Antonio Pinto, former president of Chile, declared that the Chilean people was ashamed of the presence in Chile of a pair of newspapers that supported the Anglo-French cause. The president of Bolivia Jos√© Ballivi√°n, who was so far against Rosas, instructed his diplomat Manuel Rodr√≠guez to congratulate Rosas for the action of Obligado and protest with reason of the disloyal and unjust Anglo-French intervention in the R√≠o de la Plata against the rights and interests of the Americas. Jos√© de San Mart√≠n wrote a supporting letter to Rosas and, despite his old age, offered his military assistance. He also wrote a letter to the British Morning Chronicle, explaining that a military occupation of Buenos Aires by Anglo-French forces would be nearly impossible. Cady, 1929. The convoy resumed their navigation after the repairs, but with only 52 of the original 90 commercial ships, as the others returned to Montevideo. Mansilla made new attacks at the batteries in Tonelero and Acevedo, but the ships were not damaged very much. By moving to the east side of the river, they could fire against the batteries and destroy them from a safe distance. Mansilla made a more effective resistance at San Lorenzo, in the same site where Jos√© de San Mart√≠n fought the battle of San Lorenzo. The batteries here were hidden, and attacked the Anglo-French navy by surprise. Many merchant ships collided with others, and the steam ships fired for more than four hours. According to the British report, all ships received shots during the engagement. The Fulton arrived to Asunci√≥n, with the intention to recognize the independence of Paraguay, recruit them against Rosas, and sign a treaty of commerce and friendship. Carlos Antonio L√≥pez did not agree to the British terms, he expected recognition first, war later, and a treaty for the end; not all things at once. The commerce failed, as Corrientes and Paraguay were not as wealthy as the Anglo-French expected, and they returned with most of their products. The return seemed difficult, as many ships were damaged and Mansilla was rearming the north of San Lorenzo, so they requested Montevideo to send reinforcements. The Philomel advanced at full speed, not answering fire whenever possible, reaching Montevideo in few days. The British steamboats Lizard and Harpy moved to reunite with the convoy. Those ships, however, stopped at Quebracho and returned fire, and the Lizard was badly damaged as a result. Mansilla prepared a strong defense in Quebracho, against the returning convoy. He did not prepare chains to close the river this time, as the ships would be moving downstream, rather than upstream. This new attack was very successful. The Argentine cannons attacked the enemy ships at will, and the merchant ships attempted in vain to pass behind the warships. Two merchant ships were sunk, and others had to throw their cargo in the river to reduce their weight. The steam boats were the focus of the attack, the Harpy was disabled and the Gorgon suffered great damages. After three hours of fire, the ships escaped as they could, and four damaged merchant ships were set on fire to avoid Argentine capture. End of the conflict After the failure of the expedition to the Parana, Ouseley wrote to his government requesting 10,000 British soldiers, 10,000 French soldiers and an open declaration of war to conclude the conflict. In 1846 the 73rd (Perthshire) Regiment of Foot sailed from Cork, and after docking at Rio de Janeiro, arrived in Montevideo, which it defended for seven months against besieging Argentine troops.\\"In 1846 the 73rd (Perthshire) Regiment of Foot sailed from Cork, and after a brief stop at Rio de Janeiro, moved to Montevideo, which it defended for seven months against the attacking Argentinian forces.\\" The Highland Regiments: Tigers in Tartan, William Pratt Paul, p. 19, Impulse Publications Limited, 1971 However, unknown to Ouseley, Thomas Samuel Hood was already navigating to Buenos Aires with the opposite instructions from the allied countries: negotiate an end to the hostilities, at whatever price Rosas demanded. The repercussion of the battle of Vuelta de Obligado modified the international perception of the conflict in La Plata. Hood had also promoted an end to the conflicts because Rosas had suspended the payment of the Argentine foreign debt to Britain as long as Britain maintained the blockade, and a long conflict would harm the finances of the Baring Brothers bank. Besides, there was an ongoing political scandal in Britain, as The Times had published Ouseley was favoring a personal business with the blockade. Cady, 1929. Hood arranged with Rosas the conditions for peace, but Ouseley and Deffaudis refused to obey it. Deffaudis argued that he had no instructions from Paris to seek a peaceful resolution, and Ouseley that he had to work together with Deffaudis. Hood returned to Britain with the proposal negotiated with Rosas. The British administration was inclined to leave the conflict, but it was reluctant to accept the Hood bases, as they would mean a capitulation. Britain and France sent two new diplomats, John Hobart Caradoc and Alexandre Florian Joseph Colonna, who would pretend to agree with the Hood bases but surreptitiously change the terms. Rosas realized the trick, and did not accept their new proposal. They moved then to Uruguay, and negotiated an armistice with Oribe. Oribe accepted the British terms, but Rivera did not. This broke the alliance: the British diplomat was convinced that the terms were reasonable, and decided to go on with his original mission of ending the conflict. The French one declared instead that they would keep the blockade, even if it meant doing so alone. Rosas received new diplomats, Henry Southern and Lepredour, but refused to have an interview with them before being aware of their intentions. Rosas wanted them to agree to the Hood bases, and would not accept anything else. The Arana-Southern Treaty with Britain was finally signed on March 3, 1849, in strict conformity with the terms negotiated with Hood. Britain would return the stolen ships, the Mart√≠n Garc√≠a island, remove their troops from Uruguay, accept the Argentine sovereignty over its internal waters, and condition the whole treaty to the approval of Oribe. Finally, the British navy would make a 21-gun salute to the flag of Argentina.1850 Convention of Settlement. Negotiations with France took a longer time. There was a strong nationalism in France by that time, and a second defeat with Argentina would hurt the national pride. The parliament was divided in two proposals: to send Lepredour with a very powerful navy, to make a treaty favourable to the French terms by intimidating Rosas, or to openly declare war. The first proposal was accepted by 338 votes over 300. Rosas refused to negotiate unless the threatening navy was removed from Uruguay, and refused to acknowledge Lepredour as a diplomat. Lepredour made up an excuse for the navy, and negotiated for nearly five months. Rosas finally agreed on August 31, 1850, to a pair of small concessions that did not actually modify the important points of the treaty: Rosas would remove the Argentine troops from outside Montevideo at the same time that the foreign legion evacuated Montevideo,\\"The British and French returned Mart√≠n Garc√≠a and the seized warships, and disarmed and evacuated the foreign legion from Montevideo.\\" Latin America‚Äôs Wars, Robert L. Scheina, p. 1826 Potomac Books, Inc., 2003 but keeping a portion of them during the first months of Oribe's rule to prevent anarchy; and Argentina would refer to Oribe in the document as \\"President of the Republic\\" while France would do so as \\"Brigadier General\\". Before leaving the city, the French vessel transporting Lepredour would also make a 21-gun salute to the flag of Argentina. Historical perspectives Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner during the celebrations of the Day of National Sovereignty. The historical significance of the conflict is disputed between Argentine historians. Revisionist authors consider it a key event in the history of Argentina, next to the Argentine War of Independence, while traditional historians disagree. A recent example of this conflicting viewpoints took place on November 18, 2010, before the first celebration of the National Sovereignty day (in commemoration of the main battle of the conflict, the Battle of Vuelta de Obligado) as a national holiday. The newspaper La Naci√≥n interviewed revisionist historian Pacho O'Donnell, traditional historian Luis Alberto Romero and British historian David Rock. Luis Alberto Romero considers that the importance of the battle is overrated because it was a defeat: the Anglo-French navy destroyed the artilleries and proceed to the north, as they wanted to do. The end of the blockade in favourable terms to the Confederation was more the result of a change of policy by the Foreign Office after the appointment of Lord Palmerston than a success of Rosas' diplomacy.. Pacho O'Donnell considers that, even though the navy could force its way, it ultimately failed in its main purposes: they could not turn the Argentine mesopotamia into a new country, nor gain total control of the Parana River, nor establish their presence in the zone.. David Rock concurs, but considers that it is exaggerated to treat the battle as an epic. He points that the number of casualties in it may be high in the context of the military history of Argentina, but not on a global scale, as it was nowhere near the 1916 Battle of the Somme, with more than 60,000 deaths in just half an hour.. Pacho O'Donnell considers as well that traditional historiography had concealed the battle of Vuelta de Obligado. Romero considers instead that, despite not giving it the higher importance, the battle is properly referenced at all the books about the time period. According to Historicising intervention: strategy and synchronicity in British intervention 1815‚Äì50, the British government intervention was instrumental in safeguarding Uruguayan independence from Argentina, When in October 1838, the deposed president of Uruguay, General Oribe fled to Buenos Aires in the face of a revolt by his French backed predecessor, General Rivera, he formed an alliance with Rosas whilst Rivera found backing from the exiled Argentine Unitarian, General Lavalle.

(Clockwise, from top left:) Ruth Fogel (35), Udi Fogel (36), Hadas (3 months), Yoav (11), Elad (4) The Itamar attack, also called the Itamar massacre,  was an attack on a Jewish family in the Israeli settlement of Itamar in the West Bank that took place on 11 March 2011, in which five members of the same family were murdered in their beds. The victims were the father Ehud (Udi) Fogel, the mother Ruth Fogel, and three of their six children‚ÄîYoav, 11, Elad, 4, and Hadas, the youngest, a three- month-old infant. The infant was decapitated. The settlement of Itamar had been the target of several murderous attacks before these killings. Amjad Awad and Hakim Awad, two young Palestinian cousins from the village of Awarta, were arrested for the murders. On 5 June 2011 the two men were indicted on five counts of murder, stealing weapons, breaking and entering, and conspiracy to commit a crime. Both were later convicted. They initially denied any involvement in the attack but later proudly confessed to the murders, expressing no remorse and reenacting the attack before security officials. The attack was harshly condemned by the United Nations, the Quartet on the Middle East, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, and many other governments, as well as the Palestinian Authority and a number of non- governmental organizations. Xinhua, the official press agency of the People's Republic of China, stated that the attack was praised by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades stated that \\"the heroic operation is a natural response to the (Israeli) occupation crimes against our people in West Bank and Gaza Strip.\\" An opinion poll indicated that 63% of Palestinians opposed and about one-third supported the attack. One of the perpetrators of the murders was described as a \\"hero\\" and a \\"legend\\" by members of his family, during a weekly program. Background Itamar in 2007 Due to an increase in security measures by the Palestinian National Authority, operations by Palestinian militant organizations in the West Bank had been declining. Over the previous two years, Israel had removed a number of roadblocks and checkpoints, although a security fence remained in place around Itamar. The terrorist attack was the first to kill Israeli settlers since a drive-by shooting in August 2010 left four dead near Kiryat Arba Attacks on Jewish settlers in the West Bank had been defended by some Palestinian militants on previous occasions, describing them as combatants in the conflict rather than civilians. Itamar, with a population of 1,032 (2009) had seen numerous confrontations between Israelis and Palestinians. Tensions between Itamar and the nearby Palestinian village of Awarta had been rising before the attack. Palestinians had accused settlers of cutting down olive trees, burning cars and shooting at Palestinian residents. Ten Palestinians and one Israeli were injured in a confrontation in the week before the attack, when Israeli soldiers were accused of using live fire to quell the clash. Perpetrators The attack was carried out by cousins Amjad Mahmad Awad (18) and Hakim Mazen Awad (17). Hakim was a high school student whose father, Mazen, is active in the PFLP. Mazen had previously been arrested and tried by the Palestinian Authority and served a five-year prison sentence for murdering a female cousin and burning her body. His uncle Jibril was a PFLP militant who had participated in a 2002 attack against Itamar which left four civilians dead, including three children, along with the settlement's security officer, and was killed in a 2003 clash with Israeli troops. Amjad Mahmad Awad was affiliated with the PFLP. He had been employed in Israel as a laborer, and was a student at Al-Quds Open University. The families of the two suspects initially denied the two committed the massacre. Hakim's mother falsely claimed her son had been at home the night of the murders and never left the house, saying that \\"five months ago Hakim underwent a surgery in his stomach and I'm sure he was tortured and forced into confessing\\". She later, however, acknowledged his involvement.Palestinian TV airs show praising Fogel family murderer, Haaretz, 29 January 2012. Amjad's family claimed he had been in the village at the time of the Itamar murders. One relative said Hakim and Amjad did not know each other, as \\"one went to university, the other is in high school\\". He also claimed that if they had been guilty, they would have been captured within days, as \\"the whole world knows about Israel's advanced investigation abilities and its use of sophisticated means\\". Amjad and Hakim Awad had decided to carry out an attack on Itamar days before. Three days before the killings, they approached a PFLP member with a request for weapons, but were rebuffed. At midday on Friday, 11 March, they decided that they would enter Itamar later that night, and carry out an attack armed with knives. Several media sources, among them the Guardian and the Washington Post, first reported that the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, the armed wing of Fatah, the dominant political faction in the West Bank, claimed responsibility for the attack, whereas the Jerusalem Post reported, that the \\"Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades of Imad Mughniyeh\\" had claimed responsibility, a group named after a Hezbollah chief of military operations and liaison with the Iranian Revolutionary Guards who was killed by a car bomb in Damascus in 2008. According to Al Hayat, officials of \\"Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades\\" denied association with the Imad Mughniyeh-group or the attack. Amjad and Hakim Awad were already in custody when they were identified as the killers, and their names released to the public on 17 April. They offered a detailed account of the attack, as well as a reenactment. Despite the ties of both suspects to the PFLP, Shin Bet investigators did not identify the attack as being carried out under the auspices of the PFLP, but rather as an individual act. Israeli authorities said that they planned their attack well ahead of time, and showed no remorse for their actions. The attack According to Israeli investigators, Amjad and Hakim Awad had attempted to acquire weapons from a Popular Front militant in Awarta. After he refused, they decided to carry out the attack using knives. Just after 9 pm on Friday night, the two left Awarta carrying several knives, an umbrella, and wire-cutting shears. The two tried to cut through Itamar's security fence, but eventually climbed over it. An initial probe showed that the fence around Itamar had functioned properly. At about the same time that they infiltrated, an alarm sounded in the settlement's security room, indicating the exact location where they entered. But neither Itamar's civilian security team nor the civilian security officer, who went to the site of the disturbance and found nothing out of order, informed soldiers patrolling the area of the fence, concluding that an animal had set off the alarm, although procedures prescribe that the IDF is to be informed of any alarm. After breaching the fence, Amjad and Hakim walked 400 meters into the settlement. The perpetrators first broke into a house of the Chai family who were on vacation, searching all the rooms. They stole an M16 assault rifle, ammunition, a helmet, and a kevlar vest. They waited an hour and entered the Fogels' house at around 10:30 pm. According to the indictment, the two entered the children's room, told eleven-year-old Yoav, who had been awakened by their entry not to be afraid, then took him to a nearby room, slashed his throat, and stabbed him in the chest. Hakim Awad then strangled four-year-old Elad with Amjad Awad stabbing him twice in the chest. The two next entered the parents' room, and turned on the light, waking them up. The parents then struggled with the attackers. Ehud Fogel was repeatedly stabbed in the neck, and Ruth Fogel was stabbed in the neck and back and then shot when the suspects saw that she was not dead. The suspects then left the house. According to their confessions, they feared that the shots had been heard. When they went outside, they saw a patrol vehicle, but realized that they had not been discovered when it did nothing. The two then argued over whether to withdraw or carry out attacks in other homes, with Hakim insisting that they return immediately to Awarta, and Amjad arguing that they should return to the home and steal another weapon. Amjad then re-entered the Fogel home. When 3-month-old Hadas began crying, Amjad stabbed her, fearing the cries would attract attention. According to several accounts, the infant was decapitated or nearly decapitated.Fogel Family Murderers Arrested Palestinian Teens Don't Regret Murdering Children Savage Attack, nationalreview.com; accessed 24 December 2014.Massacre in Israel, jewishledger.com, March 2011; accessed 24 December 2014.\\"Fogel murderer's family praises 'hero' killer\\", thejc.com; accessed 24 December 2014.\\"The Muhammad al-Dura Hoax and Other Myths Revived\\", meforum.org; accessed 24 December 2014. The attackers did not notice two other children asleep in the house at the time. In their confessions they claimed they would not have hesitated to kill them, had they noticed them. The perpetrators also stole Ehud's M16 rifle. They left Itamar without being detected. The Awad cousins returned to Awarta on foot, and appealed to Hakim's uncle, PFLP militant Salah Awad, for assistance, and gave him a detailed description of the attack. Salah helped them conceal their stolen weapons and burn their bloodstained clothes, and later transferred the stolen weapons to Jad Avid, a contact in Ramallah, for hiding. The bodies were discovered by Tamar Fogel, the 12-year-old daughter of the family who arrived home around midnight after a youth outing. After finding that the door was locked, she asked her neighbor, Rabbi Ya'akov Cohen, for help. He noticed tracks and mud near the house, and brought a weapon with him. The two then woke the sleeping 6-year-old boy by calling through the window, and he opened the door, after which Cohen returned to his home. When the girl discovered the murders, she ran outside screaming, and the Rabbi ran back, firing several shots into the air to alert security personnel. Rabbi Cohen, who later entered the house with the girl, said that her two-year-old brother \\"was lying next to his bleeding parents, shaking them with his hands and trying to get them to wake up, while crying... The sight in the house was shocking.\\" Magen David Adom paramedics and ZAKA (Disaster Victim Identification) volunteers were called to the scene, including ZAKA regional commander Gil Bismot. Paramedics followed a trail of toys and blood to the bedroom, where they discovered the first three bodies: the mother, father and infant. In the next room they found the body of the 11-year-old sibling. Finally they reached the last bedroom, where the 4-year- old boy was severely injured and dying. The toddler died of his wounds despite the efforts of medical personnel. In accordance with Jewish law, the bodies remained in the home throughout Jewish Sabbath, watched over by ZAKA volunteers. Immediately after the end of Sabbath, another team of ZAKA volunteers arrived from Immanuel and the wider region were dispatched to Itamar. ZAKA volunteers collected all human remains and cleaned up the scene. Dr. Yehuda Hiss of the Abu Kabir Forensic Institute in Tel Aviv traveled to Itamar to carry out an examination of the bodies. The procedure was supervised by the head of the ZAKA Rabbinical Council, Rabbi Ya'akov Roget.Itamar attack details, zaka.us; accessed 24 December 2014. Victims Bodies wrapped in tallit at funeral in Givat Shaul The victims of the attack are Ehud \\"Udi\\" Fogel, age 36, the son of Gush Emunim activists from Neve Tzuf, Ruth Fogel, age 35, the daughter of a Jerusalem rabbi, and three of their six children, Yoav, age 11, Elad, age 4, and three-month-old Hadas. The Fogel family had recently settled in Itamar. They previously lived in the Gush Katif settlement of Netzarim in the Gaza Strip. After Israel evacuated its Gaza settlements in 2005, they moved to the settlement of Ariel, and in 2009 to Itamar, where Udi Fogel worked as teacher at the post-high school yeshiva. Three of the family's children, Tamar, Roi and Yishai, survived, physically unharmed. They were taken in by grandparents in the aftermath of the attack. Twelve-year-old Tamar is quoted as having promised her relatives: \\"I will be strong and succeed in overcoming this. I understand the task that stands before me, and I will be a mother to my siblings.\\" Funeral The funeral of the five victims on Sunday, 13 March at Har HaMenuchot Cemetery in Givat Shaul, Jerusalem, was attended by some 20,000 people and broadcast on Israeli television. Speakers included former Chief Rabbi Yisrael Meir Lau, quoted as saying: \\"We will not bend, we will not give up, we returned to the land of our fathers and it is our home, and the children shall return within their borders and nothing will prevent our faith in the righteousness of our path\\", Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi Yona Metzger, who, linking the murderers to Amalek, stated that \\"Itamar needs to become a major city in Israel as a response to this murder\\", and Knesset Speaker Reuven Rivlin, whose final remarks were: \\"Build more, live more, more footholds ‚Äì that is our response to the murderers so that they know ‚Äì they can't defeat us\\". Ruth Fogel's father was quoted as having said: \\"Our children are prepared to be sacrificed as an offering at the altar we have to continue to build to bring redemption. Udi and Ruthie wanted this redemption.\\" Udi Fogel's brother Motti Fogel spoke out against the use that has been made of the murder of the family: \\"All the slogans about Torah and settlement, the Land of Israel and the people of Israel are attempts to forget the simple and pain-torn fact: you are dead. You are dead, and no slogan will bring you back. You are not a symbol or a national event. Your life was a purpose in and of itself, and it should be forbidden for your terrible death to turn your life into some sort of tool.\\" Fogel family children meet With IDF Chief of Staff Following the end of the 30-day mourning period, an emotional memorial service was held in Itamar, where the cornerstone for a new kollel to be named after Udi Fogel was laid. Hundreds of people attended, including Sephardi Chief Rabbi Moshe Amar, Knesset members Tzipi Hotovely (Likud) and Uri Ariel (National Union), and Yesha Council Chairman Danny Dayan. Many participants signed a Megillah scroll, which was recited by former Military Rabbinate Chief and Yeshiva head Avichai Rontzki before being placed within the foundations of the new kollel. Manhunt and capture Following the attack, soldiers from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Israel Police arrived in Itamar and conducted a search across the village of Itamar. The Israeli Air Force used UAVs for aerial surveillance of the area. Israeli authorities declared the nearby West Bank city of Nablus a closed military zone. Israeli troops set up checkpoints on the roads leading to the city and prevented vehicles and pedestrians from leaving or entering, according to Palestinians.Israeli army closes Nablus city after deadly stabbing Xinhua 12 March 03-2011 Residential areas were placed under curfew, and Israeli troops conducted house-to-house searches. The previously- dismantled Huwwara Checkpoint was re-established. Israeli patrol in Awarta the day after the attack An initial probe suggested two perpetrators entered Itamar shortly after 9 pm, jumping over the settlement's security fence, and remained in the settlement for three hours without being noticed. Due to the characteristics of the killings, the IDF estimated that the attack was not carried out by an organized terrorist infrastructure but was the work of one or two people, presumably Palestinian. Israeli authorities initially suspected that the killings may have been in revenge for the killing of two Palestinian teenagers from Awarta, who were shot dead near Itamar in 2010. In Itamar, the Fogel family home was cordoned off by red tape and guarded by soldiers. A forensics team probed the home, collecting evidence left behind by the killers. An IDF tracker spotted indications that the perpetrators had scaled the fence, and found footprints and equipment abandoned by the killers leading out of Itamar. The tracker, accompanied by an IDF force, followed the tracks to the Palestinian village of Awarta. IDF troops entered the town of Burqa, northwest of Nablus, searching houses and questioning residents. They did not make any arrests. IDF soldiers and Israel Border Police gendarmes also entered the villages of Sanur and Zababdeh, arresting several dozen Palestinians. A gag order was imposed on the investigation. Awarta was placed under curfew and declared a closed military zone. IDF troops and Israel Border Police conducted mass arrests of residents throughout the following days. According to Palestinian sources, all men from Awarta were questioned. Residents reported constant door-to-door searches, with some homes being searched up to three times. According to witness reports, Israeli armored vehicles patrolled the village's streets, and troops were deployed on the hilltops around the village. The city of Nablus remained under closure, but four days after the murders, a food delivery was permitted into the city. On 29 March 2011, the IDF initiated a second wave of arrests in Awarta, detaining 60 Palestinians, including the Deputy Mayor of Awarta, and collecting DNA samples. About 20 were immediately released following DNA testing, and another 40 were interrogated. A week later, AFP reported that the IDF arrested more than 100 women from the village, placing them in a camp where they were fingerprinted and DNA samples were taken, before most of them were released. On 11 April, daily IDF raids continued in the village, and troops continued to maintain roadblocks at the entrance. According to allegations by Israeli leftists and Awarta residents, soldiers humiliated residents and damaged property. Palestinian officials claimed that Israel had seized land around the village to expand nearby settlements. The Palestinian Authority condemned the raids and called on the international community to pressure Israel into halting them. Shin Bet questioned numerous Awarta villagers who had been arrested, with some residents who had been arrested and released being again questioned by Shin Bet investigators. Meanwhile, the IDF also questioned residents in various parts of Awarta. The interrogations produced various leads, but slowly, the circle of potential suspects was narrowed. At this stage, the IDF's elite Duvdevan Unit and the Israel Police's special undercover unit began making secret arrests of suspects, and interrogations of the suspects produced additional intelligence information. Hakim Awad was arrested on 5 April, but only started to cooperate after more information pointed to him. Amjad Awad was arrested on 10 April. Forensic evidence gathered from the Fogel family home linked them to the killings.Manhunt for Itamar murderers, ynetnews.com; accessed 24 December 2014. The two were identified as the perpetrators, and kept in custody pending trial. On 17 April, it was officially cleared for publication that Amjad and Hakim Awad had been identified as the killers. Both suspects confessed to the killings and offered a detailed account. They expressed no remorse for their actions, and performed a reenactment of the attack before security officials.

Subsequently, Hakim's father, two uncles, and brother were arrested for hiding the murder weapons and suppressing additional evidence. Israeli security forces also arrested the PFLP militant who they had approached for weapons, and raided the Ramallah home of Yazed Hassan Mohammed Awad, Salah Awad's contact who had hidden the two stolen assault rifles following the attack. Both of the assault rifles were found in his home. In addition, Yazed Awad was found to have briefed Amjad and Hakim on Shin Bet interrogation techniques. He was arrested, and in December 2012 was convicted by a military court.Fogel family murderers/Awad family info, israelnationalnews.com; accessed 24 December 2014. Trial and conviction On 26 May 2011, the Judea and Samaria Sector Military Court extended the remand of the two cousins for eleven days. The Military Prosecution informed the court that it would file an official indictment at their next arraignment. The Military Prosecution considered requesting the death penalty, due to the extreme nature of the attack. Prosecutors ultimately did not request the death penalty. On 5 June 2011, Amjad and Hakim Awad were indicted before the Judea and Samaria Sector Military Court on five counts of murder, stealing weapons, breaking and entering, and conspiracy to commit a crime. The suspects confessed to the murder and the military prosecution in the case presented forensic evidence linking them to the scene of the crime, including DNA samples and fingerprints. According to a senior Shin Bet official involved in the investigation, despite the suspects' young age, Hakim and Amjad \\"described what they did with self-control and did not express regret over their actions at any stage of the investigation.\\" Amjad told reporters in the court \\"I don't regret what I did and I would do it again. I'm proud of what I did and I'll accept any punishment I get, even death, because I did it all for Palestine.\\" Hakim Awad was found guilty on five counts of murder in August 2011. He was also convicted for weapons-related and other security offenses. In September 2011 he was sentenced to five consecutive life sentences and another five years in prison. Prior to the sentencing Hakim Awad declared he was not sorry and claimed he carried out the attack \\"because of the occupation.\\" In October 2011, Amjad Awad pleaded guilty to five counts of murder. Before deciding whether to convict him, the judges examined the primary evidence.Judges examine evidence against Amjad Awad, ynetnews.com; accessed 24 December 2014.

The decision was taken in a late-night cabinet meeting in which both Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak took part, after several alternatives, such as starting a new settlement or widening the settlement of Itamar, were rejected. The decision was criticized by the Palestinians and the United States. A spokesperson from the U.S. State Department told the Jewish Week that the \\"United States is deeply concerned by continuing Israeli actions with respect to settlements in the West Bank\\" and that \\"[c]ontinued Israeli settlements are illegitimate and run counter to efforts to resume direct negotiations.\\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, visiting relatives of the victims, told the mourners: \\"They shoot and we build.\\" Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman voiced his opposition to imposing the death penalty on the perpetrators, saying that Israel \\"should not be guided by revenge.\\"Liberman says Israel must not be guided by revenge, ynetnews.com; accessed 24 December 2014.

According to Palestinian sources and the BBC, Israeli settlers vandalized property near Nablus, Hebron, Bethlehem and Ramallah in revenge for the Fogel murders. They also reportedly handed out threatening leaflets in Beitillu, near Ramallah, blocked a junction in Gush Etzion and threw stones at Palestinians. Several were arrested by IDF and police forces deployed on the scene. Israeli activists blocked an intersection near Psagot on Highway 60. According to the Palestinians, residents of Bat Ayin took part in a protest at which the Israeli police fired tear gas. Settlers near Nablus and Kedumim area reportedly stoned and burned Palestinian vehicles, and blocked the Jit Junction. Rabbi Yitzchak Ginsburgh, Rosh Yeshiva of the Od Yosef Chai Yeshiva in Yitzhar, is said to have called for houses in a nearby village to be demolished.

On 14 March 200 residents of Itamar marched from Itamar to Awarta. Fourteen marchers entered the village and threw stones at homes. IDF soldiers and Border Police gendarmes dispersed the rioters. Some marched up a hill near Itamar to support the construction of a new Israeli outpost there. On 17 March, two Palestinian workers employed in Shilo were attacked by masked men armed with iron rods and pepper spray, as was an Israeli security guard who attempted to protect them. An opinion poll conducted by the Harry S. Truman Research Institute for the Advancement of Peace and the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research found, according to the groups, \\"In light of the attack in Itamar, 59% among Israelis oppose and 33% support the government policy to relax the security measures in the West Bank such as the removal of road blocks.\\" The groups asked 601 adult Israelis interviewed by phone in Hebrew, Arabic, or Russian between 21 and 28 March 2011. On 16 March Haaretz reported that residents of Itamar were building a new outpost, unofficially named \\"Aryeh.\\" \\"Aryeh\\" is Hebrew for lion, as well as an approximate acronym for the names Udi, Ruth, Yoav, Elad and Hadas, the five victims of the attack. On 1 December, Aryeh was demolished by Israeli Civil Administration personnel backed by IDF troops and police officers. During the demolition operation, three permanent structures, two makeshift structures and a synagogue were razed. A control panel and the electricity system that powered a security camera purchased by the Shomron Regional Council were also destroyed, and a security official claimed that the electric system was illegal and was destroyed to protect Civil Administration personnel from being electrocuted. Settlers claimed that three Torah scrolls were confiscated.Coverage of tensions between settlers and Palestinians after Itamar murders, ynetnews.com; accessed 21 November 2014. =Palestinians= Palestinian militants threw stones at buses returning from the funeral of the victims but some Palestinian residents of Awarta, who had previously clashed with settlers from Itamar, denounced the killings. A paramedic interviewed in an Israeli newspaper stated that on the day of the attack, residents of Itamar saw fireworks and celebrations in nearby Palestinian communities. In the Gaza Strip, the killings sparked celebrations in the city of Rafah, where Palestinians handed out candy and sweets on the streets. A resident described the attack as \\"a natural response to the harm settlers inflict on the Palestinian residents in the West Bank\\".\\"Gaza celebrates; Fayyad condemns terror attack\\", ynetnews.com; accessed 21 November 2014.Palestinian man distributes sweets to celebrate Fogel murders , daylife.com; accessed 24 December 2014. MEMRI, commenting on reactions to the murders in the Palestinian media, stated that while Sawsan Al-Barghouti, a columnist for a website affiliated with Hamas, called the Itamar murders a \\"heroic act\\", in the rest of the Palestinian media the murder of children (\\"even of settlers\\") was strongly condemned as unequivocally immoral and contrary to Palestinian values, and as doing nothing to help the Palestinian cause. One editorial, for example, stated: \\"Stabbing an infant to death is a crime against humanity. Whoever did this was insane, or charged with racist assumptions. This is not nationalist; there is no connection between the murder of the infant in the settlement of Itamar and the values of our people's struggle.\\" Many questioned whether such a murderer could be Palestinian. The PLO condemned the murders and accused Israel of jumping to the conclusion that the perpetrator was Palestinian and of exploiting the tragedy for its own political gains. A report in Haaretz reported that Palestinians in newspapers and on social networking sites condemned the attack while also criticizing settlers and the Israeli government's declaration of new settlement units in retaliation.\\"Palestinians denounce Itamar murders but lay criticism on Israel\\", haaretz.com; accessed 21 November 2014.

The groups interviewed 1,270 adults face-to-face in the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza Strip from 17 to 19 March 2011. In January 2012, Palestinian Authority television aired an interview with the mother and aunt of Hakim Awad, who praised him as \\"a hero\\" and \\"a legend\\". Hakim's mother Nawef, who had previously denied her son's involvement, now proudly admitted it. The broadcast was part of a weekly show focusing on Palestinian prisoners in Israel. On 1 February 2012, the Tomb of Eleazar was found spray-painted with Arabic slogans praising the perpetrators. The vandalism was discovered by 500 Jewish worshippers and their IDF escorts during a pilgrimage to the site. Soldiers and worshippers then covered the tomb with white paint to mask the graffiti.Tomb of Eleazar vandalized, ynetnews.com; accessed 21 November 2014. =American= A memorial service for the Fogel family was held at New York's Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun a week after the attack. It was attended by 1,000 local residents, with 2,000 more viewing a live broadcast over the internet. The president of the New York Board of Rabbis, Rabbi Yaakov Kermaier, said the victims \\"were treated as criminals for settling and building beautiful lives in the heartland of our ancestral holy land.\\" Pastor of the Canaan Baptist Church in Harlem, Reverend Jacques DeGraff, told the gathered mourners, \\"I'm here today because it is not enough for the friends of Israel to issue a statement.\\" The service was jointly sponsored by the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, the Consulate General of Israel in New York, the Jewish Community Relations Council of New York, the UJA-Federation of New York, and Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun. Gary Rosenblatt, editor-in-chief of The Jewish Week, commented that reactions to the Itamar killings may have been more muted given that the victims were religious Israelis living in a small West Bank settlement. He claimed that had the victims been secular Jews living inside the Green Line \\"outrage would have been far greater\\". =Italian= A delegation of Italian Jews from Rome visited Itamar on 30 March and extended a donation of ‚Ç¨25,000 to support the three surviving children of the Fogel family. The president of the Jewish community of Rome, Riccardo Pacifici, said, \\"We come with a message of solidarity and support.\\" =Finnish= A team of Finnish performers wrote a song in memory of the Fogel family for the annual Benei Akiva Jewish Eurovision contest, held this year in Rome, Italy. The team was inspired by the fact that daughter Tamar Fogel's life was spared owing to her being out of the house at the time of the attack, attending a Benei Akiva event. Official reactions ;Involved parties : * President Shimon Peres said, \\"This is one of the ugliest and most difficult events that we have known, the murder of parents with their small children ‚Äì among them a three-year-old boy, and a five-month-old baby girl ‚Äì while they were sleeping in their beds. It shows the loss of humanity... There is no religion in the world, no faith that allows for such horrendous acts.\\"Peres condemns attack on Itamar family, Israel News 12 March 2011 * Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that he was \\"deeply shocked\\" and that he stands behind the residents of the West Bank, adding, \\"We will not allow terror to determine the settlement map.\\" He also told Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas that it was not enough to condemn the violence because it \\"is against Palestinian interests\\", but because it is morally unacceptable. \\"I expect that you stop the incitement in the schools, school books and mosques, and educate your children toward peace, as we do. The murder of children in their sleep is murder for the sake of murder.\\" He blamed the terror attack on continuing incitement against Jews in the Palestinian Authority. * Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman visited the Fogel family's home in Itamar three days after the killings and expressed his admiration for the people of Itamar, stressing that it is \\"the state's duty to guarantee the security of Israel's residents\\" and that there should be no security compromises by Israel and no retreat to the 1967 borders. Lieberman also urged the Palestinian Authority to end incitement, stating that \\"we cannot talk peace with anyone talking about bloodshed, hatred, and murder. We must draw conclusions on the political level\\". * In what Haaretz described as \\"an unprecedented decision\\", the Israeli Minister of Public Diplomacy and Diaspora Affairs Yuli Edelstein decided to release horrific photographs from the scene of the attack. The photos show the stabbed and bleeding bodies of the members of the Fogel family, with only their faces blurred, as requested by their relatives. Although the photographs were distributed to the international media, no serious news organization has published them to date. * IDF Chief of Staff, Rav Aluf Benny Gantz, visited Itamar the day after the attack and vowed, \\"We will not rest until we lay our hands on the murderers.

A struggle must be moral, conscionable, and fair. There are rules to the struggle against the occupation\\". : * Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas telephoned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to condemn the attack. In an initial statement released by his office, Abbas stressed his \\"rejection and condemnation at all violence directed against civilians, regardless of who was behind it or the reason for it,\\" adding that \\"violence produces violence and what is needed is to speed up a just and comprehensive solution to the conflict.\\" In a later interview with Israel Radio, Abbas called it a despicable, immoral, and inhuman act, saying, \\"A human being is not capable of something like that.\\" \\"Scenes like these ‚Äì the murder of infants and children and a woman slaughtered ‚Äì cause any person endowed with humanity to hurt and to cry.\\" He dismissed Prime Minister Netanyahu's claim that the Palestinian Authority was inciting violence against Israel, and called for an Israeli-Palestinian-American committee to examine Netanyahu's claim of incitement in Palestinian textbooks. Prime Minister Netanyahu praised Abbas for condemning the murders but said that he must make his condemnation in Palestinian media as well. During the opening session of the PLO Central Council, Abbas accused Israel of always rushing to blame the Palestinians, and stated that \\"the facts are still unknown, yet, Israel insists on its position before the facts are known\\". Abbas said Israeli settlers in the West Bank were responsible for crimes against the Palestinians on a daily basis, and that \\"the international community and the public in Israel should talk about these crimes, and identify them as crimes\\", adding that this does not justify the attack.Abbas talks about Itamar murders, imemc.org; accessed 24 December 2014. * Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Salam Fayyad said he \\"clearly and firmly denounces the terror attack, just as I have denounced crimes against Palestinians.\\" During a tour in Bethlehem he said, \\"We are against all types of violence ...

As a result of the Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine Bulgaria was in a grave situation having lost territory to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, Greece and Romania and the right to maintain an army of no more than 20,000 combined with heavy reparations to those countries. The treaty was an attempt to normalize relations with the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and gain its support on the Bulgarian claims to Western Thrace and Southern Dobruja but knowing the Bulgarian weakness the latter reduced the negotiations to technical issues and the Bulgarian responsibilities to fight the IMRO.  Treaty  The treaty was signed after its text was first discussed and agreed at the Conference of Ni≈° held in period 1‚Äî17 March 1923. There was a leak of information through which the IMRO was informed about the preparation of the treaty during the conference in Ni≈°. The treaty was signed by Aleksandar Stamboliyski on behalf of Kingdom of Bulgaria. By this treaty Bulgaria undertook the obligation to suppress the operations of the IMRO carried out from Bulgarian territory. The treaty become known to the public on 7 May 1923 after the ordinance of the Council of Ministers of Bulgaria.  Aftermath  Based on the informations that \\"leaked\\" during the Ni≈° Conference, the IMRO undertook immediate measures, based on a secret circular letter ‚Ññ 384, to create a second subsidiary organization in the border revolutionary districts in Macedonia. The plan of the Central Committee was to move the second subsidiary organization and members away from Bulgaria and by that to preserve the organization and members in case the Bulgarian government undertook repressive measures. Three days after the conference in Ni≈° was over, Todor Aleksandrov took new precautions and prepared constitutive documents to a new secret structure called Railway Secret Organization (RSO) as a new subsidiary organization of IMRO. The IMRO had a prominent role in assassinating Aleksandar Stamboliyski due to his signing of the Treaty of Ni≈°. The assassins also cut off his hand, representing their opposition to his signing of the Treaty of Ni≈°.

It is the third single from their second full-length album, American Tragedy, and the tenth track on that album. It is the band's ninth overall single in their discography. The track was released as a promotional single and free download on the band's official website on January 11, 2011. It was later released as a single on March 15, along with another single, \\"Been to Hell\\". A remix was featured on the band's American Tragedy Redux remix album.  Background  The track was initially sent to radio stations on February 24, 2011, as a promotional single for their second album, American Tragedy. The unofficial track was soon leaked afterwards, with rumors of Kevin Rudolf being a featured artist. It was later revealed Rudolf was a producer for the track along with Jacob Kasher and Jeff Halavacs, with Don Gilmore as executive producer. On March 15, the band released the song as the third official single following Hear Me Now, with Been to Hell also being released as a single the same day. As a video was shot for \\"Been to Hell\\", \\"Coming Back Down\\" has yet to receive a music video. Lyrically, \\"Coming Back Down\\" centers on the story of an unknown loved one who has recently died, with the narrator having difficulty trying to live without them. The chorus is sung by Danny, with the first verse being rapped by J-Dog and the second being rapped by Johnny 3 Tears. Johnny 3 Tears also sings the bridge. A remix of the song by Beatnick and K-Salaam was included on the 2011 remix album American Tragedy Redux. Reception A reviewer for SoCal Music Today praised the song and said that it \\"tugs at the heart strings as the boys take a step back from aggression to let out some raw emotion\\". A reviewer for Sputnik Music called the track one of the best moments of the album and felt that the combination of \\"Coming Back Down\\" along with \\"Bullet\\" and \\"Levitate\\" on the album created a \\"three song knockout\\". The track was praised for incorporating \\"acoustic guitars and a chorus that wouldn‚Äôt sound out of place on an All Time Low album, with a love-lorn summery atmosphere that feels warm and comfortable for the band\\". Brian Voerding noted that the song showed the band's strength in both singing and rapping while comparing the sound to Linkin Park, noting that, \\"The song bolsters the outfit as a force in rap rock with its sampled guitar riffs and swirling synths.\\" Voerding also compared the production to that of Kid Rock mixed with pop-punk bands. He concluded by praising the lyrics, saying, \\"There's a spirituality in the lyrics, swollen with defeat, but rich with yearning. It's an allowance that however dark the day, the following may lighten.\\" Some reviewers were critical, however. One review from Revolver Magazine called the ballad \\"the weaker [point] in the record\\", despite having a positive review for the American Tragedy album as a whole.

Kleetopes are named after Victor Klee.. Examples The triakis tetrahedron is the Kleetope of a tetrahedron, the triakis octahedron is the Kleetope of an octahedron, and the triakis icosahedron is the Kleetope of an icosahedron. In each of these cases the Kleetope is formed by adding a triangular pyramid to each face of the original polyhedron.

For instance, the disdyakis dodecahedron is the Kleetope of the rhombic dodecahedron, formed by replacing each rhombus face of the dodecahedron by a rhombic pyramid, and the disdyakis triacontahedron is the Kleetope of the rhombic triacontahedron. In fact, the base polyhedron of a Kleetope does not need to be Face-transitive, as can be seen from the tripentakis icosidodecahedron above. The Goldner‚ÄìHarary graph may be represented as the graph of vertices and edges of the Kleetope of the triangular bipyramid. {class=wikitable width=720 +Some nonconvex Kleetopes, based on the Kepler-Poinsot solids 180px small stellapentakis dodecahedron Kleetope of small stellated dodecahedron. 180px great stellapentakis dodecahedron Kleetope of great stellated dodecahedron. 180px great pentakis dodecahedron Kleetope of great dodecahedron. 180px great triakis icosahedron Kleetope of great icosahedron. } Definitions One method of forming the Kleetope of a polytope is to place a new vertex outside , near the centroid of each facet. If all of these new vertices are placed close enough to the corresponding centroids, then the only other vertices visible to them will be the vertices of the facets from which they are defined. In this case, the Kleetope of is the convex hull of the union of the vertices of and the set of new vertices., p. 217. Alternatively, the Kleetope may be defined by duality and its dual operation, truncation: the Kleetope of is the dual polyhedron of the truncation of the dual of . Properties and applications If has enough vertices relative to its dimension, then the Kleetope of is dimensionally unambiguous: the graph formed by its edges and vertices is not the graph of a different polyhedron or polytope with a different dimension. More specifically, if the number of vertices of a -dimensional polytope is at least , then is dimensionally unambiguous.; , p. 227. If every -dimensional face of a -dimensional polytope is a simplex, and if , then every -dimensional face of is also a simplex. In particular, the Kleetope of any three-dimensional polyhedron is a simplicial polyhedron, a polyhedron in which all facets are triangles. Kleetopes may be used to generate polyhedra that do not have any Hamiltonian cycles: any path through one of the vertices added in the Kleetope construction must go into and out of the vertex through its neighbors in the original polyhedron, and if there are more new vertices than original vertices then there are not enough neighbors to go around. In particular, the Goldner‚ÄìHarary graph, the Kleetope of the triangular bipyramid, has six vertices added in the Kleetope construction and only five in the bipyramid from which it was formed, so it is non-Hamiltonian; it is the simplest possible non-Hamiltonian simplicial polyhedron., p. 357; . If a polyhedron with vertices is formed by repeating the Kleetope construction some number of times, starting from a tetrahedron, then its longest path has length ; that is, the shortness exponent of these graphs is , approximately 0.630930. The same technique shows that in any higher dimension , there exist simplicial polytopes with shortness exponent .. Similarly, used the Kleetope construction to provide an infinite family of examples of simplicial polyhedra with an even number of vertices that have no perfect matching. Kleetopes also have some extreme properties related to their vertex degrees: if each edge in a planar graph is incident to at least seven other edges, then there must exist a vertex of degree at most five all but one of whose neighbors have degree 20 or more, and the Kleetope of the Kleetope of the icosahedron provides an example in which the high-degree vertices have degree exactly 20..

History  Caroline Smith is originally from Detroit Lakes, Minnesota, a town of about 8,600 according to the 2010 Census. She began playing music at an early age, reportedly learning guitar from her father. At 16 she started performing publicly at Zorbaz Pizza in her hometown and opened for B.B. King as well as releasing a self-titled album. Caroline has been quoted saying she prefers the guitar, more than other instruments, because of her ability to control the dynamics. She describes her voice as a \\"conglomerate\\" with countless influences ranging from Billie Holiday to Peter, Paul and Mary among others. In 2006, at 18 she moved to Minneapolis to study at the University of Minnesota. She quickly began a weekly solo gig at Minneapolis' West Bank 400 Bar, a venue famous for acts such as Elliott Smith, Conor Oberst and Mason Jennings. In 2007, the club's owner, Tom Sullivan, introduced her to drummer Arlen Peiffer who is known for his work in the band Cloud Cult. A year later, bassist Jesse Schuster joined the band. Then in March 2011, Caroline joined forces with multi-instrumentalist Alex Ramsey expanding into the Good Night Sleeps.  Career  In August 2008, the band released their debut full-length album Backyard Tent Set. The album was recorded at Devil's Workshop in Minneapolis with Chad Weis (Mason Jennings, Ben Kweller). The sound is described by Smith as \\"storybook folk with an indie twist. We think it's important that our recording sounds like our live show.\\" The band has toured twice in support of the album, playing as many dates as possible including an open mic at the Shadow Lounge in Pittsburgh. In 2010, Smith and bandmate Jesse Schuster released Live at the Cedar, recorded exclusively during a show at the Cedar Cultural Center. The album included several songs from Backyard Tentset as well as five additions. The albums were hand packaged and fitted with an envelope, string and a wax stamp and sold out within 6 months. The band has completed seven national tours, played at countless venues including Minneapolis' notable First Avenue. Smith described the experience of selling out the hometown venue: \\"When I was in high school, I used to sit in my bathroom and sing with my guitar and pretend I was on the main stage of First Avenue...I was totally transported back to that moment as soon as I started playing and I got all giddy.\\" On March 6, 2011, Minnesota Public Radio station 89.3 The Current premiered a new song from the band on The Local Show entitled \\"Tank Top.\\" Previously, Smith, along with bandmate Jesse Schuster, performed \\"She Ain't Got it,\\" \\"Lack of Height,\\" \\"Denim Boy\\" and \\"Tying My Shoes\\" in the 89.3 The Current studios which was filmed on February 2, 2010.

After he was overthrown, he resided briefly at the domain of his ally Wang Rong the military governor of Chengde Circuit (ÊàêÂæ∑, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei). He subsequently tried to seize control of the circuit from Wang, but was killed by Chengde soldiers faithful to Wang.  Background  It is not known when Li Kuangwei was born, but it is known that his family was from Lulong Circuit's capital Fanyang.Old Book of Tang, vol. 180. The first historical reference to him was in 886, when his father, the military governor (Jiedushi) Li Quanzhong, who had seized control of Lulong in 885 after overthrowing the prior military governor Li Keju, died, and Li Kuangwei thereafter claimed the title of acting military governor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 256. At some point, the imperial government confirmed him as full military governor.New Book of Tang, vol. 212.  As military governor of Lulong  It was said that Li Kuangwei was ambitious, and, because the Tang state was in disarray at the time, he strengthened his army with the intent of eventually trying to occupy more territory. In 890, another major warlord, Li Keyong the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), attacked Helian Duo the defender of Yun Prefecture (Èõ≤Â∑û, in modern Datong, Shanxi), capturing its eastern part. Helian sought aid from Li Kuangwei, and Li Kuangwei took 30,000 men to aid him. After Li Keyong's officer An Jinjun () died in battle and another officer, Shen Xin (), surrendered to Helian, Li Keyong was forced to withdraw.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 258. As a result of Li Keyong's attack on Helian, Helian and Li Kuangwei submitted petitions to Emperor Xizong's brother and successor Emperor Zhaozong, asking the emperor to declare a general campaign against Li Keyong. They were concurred in by Li Keyong's rival Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan), as well as the chancellors Zhang Jun and Kong Wei. Emperor Zhaozong thus declared a general campaign against Li Keyong, with Zhang in command. As part of the operations against Li Keyong, Li Kuangwei and Helian were to attack Li Keyong from the north. They had initial successes, as Li Kuangwei captured Wei Prefecture, and Helian, along with Tufan and Xiajiasi tribesmen, attacked Zhelu Base (ÈÅÆËôúËªç, in modern Xinzhou, Shanxi), killing its defender Liu Huzi (). However, Li Keyong then sent a major force under his adoptive sons Li Cunxin and Li Siyuan, and they defeated Li Kuangwei and Helian, capturing Li Kuangwei's son Li Renzong () and Helian's son-in-law, forcing them to withdraw. Zhang's main operations against Li Keyong subsequently collapsed under pressure from Li Keyong. Faced with defeat, Emperor Zhaozong was forced to restore all of Li Keyong's titles. In fall 891, Li Keyong attacked Wang Rong the military governor of Chengde Circuit and had initial successes. When Li Kuangwei led an army to aid Wang, Li Keyong, after pillaging Chengde territory, withdrew. In spring 892, Li Kuangwei and Wang jointly attacked the Hedong-held town of Yaoshan (Â†ØÂ±±, in modern Xingtai, Hebei), but were defeated by Li Keyong's officer Li Sixun () and thereafter withdrew. Thereafter, Li Keyong and his ally Wang Chucun the military governor of Yiwu Circuit (Áæ©Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Baoding, Hebei); they withdrew after Li Kuangwei attacked Yun and Dai (‰ª£Â∑û, in modern Xinzhou, Shanxi) Prefectures (which had fallen to Hedong control by that point, forcing Helian to flee to Lulong). Late in 892, Li Kuangwei and Helian launched another attack on Yun, hoping to recapture it for Helian, but Li Keyong defeated them and forced them to withdraw.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 259.  Overthrow and death  In 893, Li Keyong attacked Wang Rong again, and Wang could not repel his attack despite aid from Li Cunxiao, formerly an adoptive son of Li Keyong's who had turned against Li Keyong. Li Kuangwei launched his army to aid Wang, and after he defeated Li Keyong, Li Keyong withdrew. Because of this, Wang awarded Li Kuangwei's army with a large amount of money and silk. However, right as he launched his army, Li Kuangwei had sown the seeds of his defeat. His family members had held a feast to send him off, and at the feast, Li Kuangwei, who was drunk, raped the beautiful wife of his younger brother Li Kuangchou. Thereafter, while Li Kuangwei was on the way back to Lulong after aiding Wang, Li Kuangchou took over the Lulong headquarters and claimed the title of acting military governor, and subsequently issued orders to the Lulong soldiers to return to Lulong. The Lulong soldiers largely followed that order and deserted Li Kuangwei, who was left at Chengde's Shen Prefecture (Ê∑±Â∑û, in modern Hengshui, Hebei) with a small number of his close followers. Unsure what he should do next, he sent his assistant Li Baozhen () to the imperial capital Chang'an, requesting that he be allowed to report to the imperial capital. However, thereafter, as Wang was grateful to Li Kuangwei for his aid and sorry that Li Kuangwei had lost his own circuit, welcomed Li Kuangwei to Chengde's capital Zhen Prefecture (). He built a mansion for Li Kuangwei and honored Li Kuangwei like a father. Once Li Kuangwei settled in at Zhen, he assisted Wang in building the defenses of Zhen Prefecture and training Chengde soldiers. However, as Wang was young (19) at the time, and Li Kuangwei himself liked the customs of the people of Zhen, he plotted with Li Baozhen (who had returned from Chang'an by that point) to seize control of the circuit. Later in 893, on the anniversary of the death of one of Li Kuangwei's parents, when Wang was at Li Kuangwei's mansion to pay his respects, Li Kuangwei had his own soldiers try to seize Wang. Wang, reacting quickly, stated that he was willing to turn the control of the circuit to him but that they should formally do so at the circuit headquarters. Li Kuangwei agreed, and they rode horses together toward headquarters, escorted by Li Kuangwei's soldiers. On the way there, one of the Chengde soldiers, Mo Junhe (), hidden in a corner, seized Wang and took him out of Li Kuangwei's corps of soldiers. The remaining Chengde troops, once they saw that Wang was out of danger, attacked Li Kuangwei and his troops, slaughtering them and allowing Wang to retain Chengde.

She is married and has one child and lives in Seattle, Washington. A graduate of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Madhavi holds a master's degree in Computational Mechanics. Madhavi founded the telecom and IT services multinational Prithvi in 1998, and together with her brother Satish Vuppalapati, took the company public in India 7 years later.NSE:PRITHVI She is the only female CEO amongst the top 50 Indian IT and telecom services companies.  Early life and education  Born in Chirala, Andhra Pradesh, India to Ramarao Vuppalapati, an industrialist and professor of physics, and Murthy Devi, a homemaker, Madhavi is the second of 3 children. She attended St. Anthony‚Äôs High School, where she was the top student in her class. She went on to study computer science at Osmania University in Hyderabad, where she graduated in 1993 with a Bachelor of Engineering degree. Madhavi went on to attend Carnegie Mellon University, graduating in 1995 with a master's degree in Computational Mathematics.  Career  Madhavi joined Alcoa as a contract design engineer shortly after graduating, and began working on various assignments in the Pittsburgh area. After being laid off three times in three years due to project cancellations and a sketchy economy, a time she attributes to being the turning point in her career, Madhavi decided to go into business for herself. She founded Prithvi Information Solutions in 1998, and together with several friends from CMU oriented the company toward providing software R&D; and data analytics services. Initially to float the business, Prithvi engaged in consulting work which it further expanded to software and IT services provided from the Prithvi‚Äôs India facility. The company grew quickly and went public in 2005 on revenues of $60 M. In 2006 Madhavi returned to her alma mater to help Turing Award winner Dr. Raj Reddy establish the Global Innovation Center in conjunction with Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.  Entrepreneurship  As an entrepreneur herself, Madhavi supports entrepreneurship through her involvement with The Indus Entrepreneurs (TIE) and personal mentoring of five craft-based microbusinesses (see Philanthropy and Charitable Works below). She served on the Boards of TIE Pittsburgh from 2006‚Äì2008, and TIE Seattle from 2010.  Recognition  * Business Today awarded Madhavi as one of \\"The 10 rising stars to represent the epitome of today‚Äôs women, for whom nothing is impossible\\".On the Power Track: Nothing is Impossible, Business Today * Madhavi was selected by the Indian School of Business to meet with U.S. President George W. Bush as part of a young entrepreneurs summit. * In 2009, Madhavi was recognized by the Federation of Andhra Pradesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FAPCCI) by awarding her the Best Woman CEO.  Commitment to education  Chief among Madhavi‚Äôs interests is promoting education and livelihood generation (see Philanthropy and Charitable Work below) in India and Africa. In the United States, her efforts are predominantly focused on improving opportunity through education. She is an active member of the Bellevue School District, and through Prithvi invests in developing internet-based learning solutions for the schools of tomorrow. In 2010 she was elected to the Board of Pratham (Seattle), a non-profit organization focused on education in India.  Philanthropy and charity  Madhavi is deeply concerned about access to education and livelihood generation. Expanding on the concept of microfinance, livelihood generation couples business and marketing expertise with micro- financing. Through NPO Avani Giving, Madhavi provides business mentorship and financial assistance to four groups in India and one group in South Africa. Madhavi maintains strong connections with India, and spends some of her time living there and participating in charitable work. She is a patron of the Anbagam charity which pays for higher education of orphans supported by the Anbagam Orphanage near Trichy (India).  Controversy  On September 6, 2013, United States District Court Western District of Washington at Seattle entered a judgment against Prithvi Solutions Inc. ordering them to pay over $17 million to Kyko Global Inc. in a lawsuit filed by the latter. To recover the penalty, Madhavi Vuppalapati received court‚Äôs notice for sale of personal property on February 12, 2014. The court directed the Sheriff to auction and sell her 2006 Lexus RX4005D, along with her jewelry and miscellaneous household items. An arrest warrant was issued against Vuppalapati on 16th Oct 2014 by The King County Court, Washington. On September 10, 2013, Prithvi Catalytic, a subsidiary of Prithvi Solutions Inc., voluntarily filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy after missing multiple payroll deadlines for contract and internal employees, primarily due to the judgement favoring Kyko Global Inc. As a part of the bankruptcy, the Court appointed, with Kyko's consent, a chief restructuring officer to oversee PCI's operations. This officer was the controller to PCI, David Amorose, who was tasked with leading reorganization efforts to maintain existing business with key customers, even after re- branding to \\"Abilius, Inc.\\" However, the accusations of fraud against Madhavi Vuppalapati and damaged reputation of PCI among its clients resulted in significant loss of revenue. Ultimately, Kyko and debtors attempted a suit to recoup losses from clients, competitors, and former PCI executives.

The majority of the album was recorded in an abandoned pasta sauce factory in Central Falls, Rhode Island, near the band's hometown of Providence, Rhode Island. Smart Flesh is the only album to feature multi- instrumentalist Mat Davidson, who left the band during the album's promotional tour. A numbered, letterpress printed version of the album was issued upon release, containing an additional disc with three \\"passable strays that missed the cut.\\"Accompanying sticker on limited edition version. The bonus track, \\"Dreams Can Chase You Down\\", is written by former member Dan Lefkowitz. Background and recording After extensive touring in support of the band's previous album, Oh My God, Charlie Darwin, the band set up a recording studio in an abandoned pasta sauce factory, in their hometown, Providence, Rhode Island. Jeff Prystowsky states that the band \\"set out to make a record in a natural space, [...] a building that has its own kind of reverb, its own sound, a unique sound that we find beautiful.\\" The band stayed in the factory together for three months, with Prystowsky stating that \\"it wasn‚Äôt cushy at all.\\" Ben Knox Miller noted that: \\"Obviously, there were personal tensions, you know? When you do anything intensely over a long period of time... it was like 3 months we were living in that place. This little place, as a family unit, whatever you want to call it. But yeah, we didn't picture that it would be that cold.\\" The environment of the factory ultimately dictated the album's overall aesthetic, with the band using different metals, woods and artifacts as percussive instruments. Prystowsky also notes that the album's emphasis on quieter songs is as a result of the recording space: \\"It just sounded muddy when you tried to play rowdy songs. It‚Äôs not an acoustically treated room, and [if] you get a lot of drums and electric guitar, [then] everything is muddy and you can‚Äôt hear the divisions, the timbres of the instruments. It had that kind of effect with some of those kinds of songs when we tried to play them in the factory building.\\" Prior to the album's release, Miller remarked that \\"a lot of songs died in that space that would have flourished elsewhere, for musical reasons more so than lyrical reasons.\\" According to Miller and Prystowsky, the band recorded around thirty songs in the factory. The unreleased tracks are currently being considered for release under an \\"alter- ego\\" band, Snake Wagon. Following the recording sessions, the band travelled to Omaha to mix the tracks with Mike Mogis, of Bright Eyes fame. Miller described the man as \\"a genius. He‚Äôs like the man with the Midas touch.\\" The band subsequently returned to the pasta sauce factory for the album's launch gig, in March 2011.

The contributors created the fund to give grants to those wounded in service to the Crown and to set up annuities to the dependents of those killed in action. The Fund also awarded prizes to those British combatants who went beyond the call of duty. The rewards could be a sum of money, a sword or a piece of plate.Low p165 The awards were highly publicized to help raise morale during wartime.Lincoln p95 In 1807 the fund also donated ¬£61,000 to the Royal Naval Asylum, giving Lloyd's Patriotic Fund the enduring right to nominate children to the school.Gawler p55 On 24 August 1809 the Fund held a general meeting of its subscribers. The subscribers decided at that time to discontinue awards for merit. The Peninsular War was putting such demands on the Fund that it was felt that priority would have to go to support for the wounded and the dependents of those killed. Still, when the Fund awarded officers money for wounds received, some officers asked that the Fund give them an inscribed sword instead.  Swords The Fund issued 15 swords worth ¬£30 each, to midshipmen, masters' mates and Royal Marine lieutenants. Also, 91 swords worth 50 pounds each went to naval lieutenants and Royal Marine captains. It issued 35 swords worth ¬£100 each to commanders and naval captains. In addition, it issued 23 swords, worth ¬£100 each, to naval captains who fought at Trafalgar. Some 60 officers requested a piece of plate of equal value instead of a sword. Lastly, a number of officers opted for cash instead, either for themselves or to distribute to their crew. One engagement might result in multiple awards. When a cutting-out party from HMS Franchise captured in 1806, naval lieutenants John Fleming and Peter Douglas, and Lieutenant of Marines Mend, each received a sword worth ¬£50, while Midshipman Lamb received one worth ¬£30. Not all the officers who received swords or other merit awards were naval officers or Royal Marines. Some were captains of privateers or East Indiamen. The Fund awarded Mr. Thomas Musgrave, captain of the private man of war an honour-sabre worth ¬£30 for the action in which Kitty captured the Spanish ship Felicity (or Felicidad).

In Packing for Mars, Mary Roach searches for answers to questions about the gross, the bizarre, and the uncomfortable aspects of space travel. The book's 16 chapters cover the entire comedic spectrum of all things space-related, and also include some study of the scientific side of space travel.http://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/non-fiction/mary- roach/packing-for-mars/ The chapters discussing the various bodily functions of astronauts in space (going to the bathroom, having sex, vomiting) and obscure testing procedures (animals in space, lying in beds for months, parabolic zero-g) are balanced by the informative sections on topics such as the psychological effects of being in space, astronaut training, and the increasing use of human cadavers over crash test dummies in research. Mary Roach's overview Mary Roach, the author of Packing for Mars, was raised in Etna, New Hampshire and spent several years working as a freelance copy editor and investigating unpopular topics. Roach explores lots of questions such as what happens after we die, what sex is all about, and what secrets human cadavers hold. However, in Packing for Mars, she turns her mind toward space and examines the logistics of space travel. In an interview, she describes her book to be about all the surreal physical and physiological challenges of living in space as a human being. Roach explains that in addition to these problems, human beings are not in the slightest equipped or prepared to confront these challenges. Although most of her other books have one-word titles, Mary Roach claims that it was especially difficult to come up with a one-word title for this specific book.

With the targeted application of radar technology for astronomical research, he laid the basis for the development of radio astronomy . He discovered that the Sun radiates radio waves and localized for the first time an extragalactic radio source in the constellation Cygnus .  Biography  He was born in 1909 in Nelson, Lancashire, the third son of a cotton manufacturer, which was the main industry in Lancashire. Hey studied physics at the University of Manchester, graduating in 1930, and obtained his master's degree in X-ray crystallography the next year. His wife, Edna Heywood, was a fellow student there. He was then a teacher of physics in a northern grammar school for some years. In 1942 Hey joined the Army Operational Research Group (AORG) after a 6-week course at the Army Radio School. His task was to work on radar anti-jamming methods; for a year German jamming of Allied radar had been a problem and the escape of three German warships through the English Channel, aided by enemy radar jamming from the French Coast, had highlighted the problem. In February 1942 Hey had reports of severe noise jamming of anti-aircraft radars in the 4‚Äì8 m range. Realizing that the direction of maximum interference seemed to follow the Sun, he checked with the Royal Observatory and found that a very active sunspot was traversing the solar disc. He concluded that a sunspot region, which was believed to emit streams of energetic ions and electrons in magnetic fields of around 100 G (gauss), could emit metre-wave radiation. In 1942, G.C. Southworth in the USA also linked the Sun with radio noise, this time in the centimetre-wave region. Later, in 1945, Hey used radar to track the paths of V-2 rockets approaching London at about 100 miles high. A problem here arose from spasmodic transient radar echoes at heights of about 60 miles, arriving at a rate of five to 10 per hour. When the V-2 attacks ceased, the echoes did not; Hey concluded that meteor trails were responsible and that radar could be used to track meteor streams, and could of course do so by day as well as by night. Hey's results of 1942 could not be published until after the war. Hey became Head of the AORG in 1949. He then worked as a researcher at the Royal Radar Establishment at Malvern, where he also continued his radio astronomical observations. From 1966 until his retirement in 1969 he was head of the research department.

From the 1930s Dale was the Oxford Diocesan Surveyor and was most noted for designing, restoring, and furnishing Church of England parish churches. Training and career Dale was born in London, where he was educated at University College School in Hampstead.Brodie, 2001, page 492 He began his architectural training at the Architectural Association School of Architecture in 1900, was articled to Charles Ponting in Marlborough, Wiltshire 1901‚Äì04, and served as assistant to the architect Edmund Buckle 1904‚Äì06. Dale passed his architect's qualifying examination in 1906 and was admitted as an Associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects (ARIBA) in 1907. Before the First World War, Dale lived in Bedford Park in west London. By the outbreak of that war he had his own practice at 40 Great James Street, off Bedford Row, London WC1. In the war he was commissioned as an officer in an infantry battalion, but when he was placed in reserve he successfully applied to transfer to the Army Cyclist Corps to see active service. He rose to the rank of Captain and was mentioned in despatches. After the war, Dale moved to Banbury where he designed a housing estate for Banbury Rural District Council. In the 1920s Dale spent \\"a delightful year\\" working on \\"an exceedingly complicated planning problem\\" as a competitor in a worldwide architectural competition to design the new Freemasons' Grand Temple in Great Queen Street in London. Dale came second, for which he won \\"a large prize\\". Some time thereafter he moved to Oxford, where he designed the modest neo-Georgian house that was built for him and his family at 358 Woodstock Road.Sherwood & Pevsner, 1974, page 334 He later moved again to 4 Bradmore Road on the Victorian Norham Manor estate. Dale served as Oxford Diocesan Surveyor for 23 years. He designed at least four parish churches that were built in or near Oxford. He also designed restoration work or new furnishings for a number of parish churches; most of them in Oxfordshire, plus one in Warwickshire. Family St Francis of Assissi parish church, Cowley (1931) Dale's wife predeceased him. They left two sons and two daughters. By the time of Dale's death, both sons had married and one of the daughters was a Sister in a religious order. Dale's death in 1959 was reported in The Times. Harry Carpenter, Bishop of Oxford, assisted at his funeral. Lawrence Dale is buried in Wolvercote Cemetery near his home in Oxford. Dale's elder son Thomas Simon Savage Dale (known as Simon Dale) was born in 1919 and also became an architect. They practised together as Dale and Son. In 1957 Simon Dale married Susan Wilberforce, a descendant of William Wilberforce, and moved with her to Hopton Castle, Shropshire. Simon Dale later lost his sight, was divorced in 1972, and in 1987 was beaten to death at The Heath, the house that he and Susan had restored at Hopton Castle. Secular buildings Ickford Village Hall (1946) Two of Dale's earlier works are Edwardian houses in Hampstead Garden Suburb, one of which has been described as \\"an excellent house of the Lutyens school\\". Horn Park, a country house about north-west of Beaminster, Dorset, is Dale's largest and perhaps most significant house design. It is a symmetrical neo-Georgian building of five bays and two storeys, completed in 1911.Newman & Pevsner, 1972, page 88 Its central corridor is barrel vaulted and leads to a drawing room whose groin vault is reminiscent of the work of Sir John Soane (1753‚Äì1837). The house is Listed Grade II. Lawrence and Simon Dale together designed Ickford Village Hall (1946). The roof and almost all of the walls are hung with wooden shingles, possibly in response to the shortage of many types of building material after the Second World War. Parish churches Bell-gable of St Alban the Martyr parish church, Oxford (1933) Like Charles Ponting (1850‚Äì1932) to whom he had been articled, Dale's ecclesiastical architecture was strongly Anglo-Catholic. However, whereas Ponting continued to work in the Gothic Revival idiom long after it had passed out of fashion, Dale adopted Italianate architecture for his churches. Dale designed at least four parish churches for the Diocese of Oxford. The first, St. Francis of Assisi, Cowley (1930‚Äì31), was built on a site provided by Morris Motors as a temporary daughter church of St. James, Cowley.Crossley & Elrington, 1979, pages 369‚Äì412 It was made a permanent church and dedicated in 1962. St. Francis' is a simple building with only a small chancel. Dale's second church, St. Alban the Martyr, Oxford (1933), replaced a chapel of ease that had been built for St. Mary and St. John parish church in 1889. St. Alban's is a relatively low building for its length and is limited by a narrow corner site. He also designed \\"halls\\" ‚Äì possibly mission halls ‚Äì for the parishes of St. Nicholas, Marston and St. James, Cowley. Part of west front of St Michael and All Angels parish church, New Marston (1956) Dale's churches built after the Second World War were more ambitious. St. Michael and All Angels, New Marston (1954‚Äì56),Sherwood & Pevsner, 1974, pages 336‚Äì337 was built as a chapel of ease for St. Andrew's parish church, Headington. It is more substantial in scale and has a statue of St. Michael by Michael Groser and a reredos painted by Leon Underwood.Sherwood & Pevsner, 1974, page 337 St. Michael's is described as being in a \\"vaguely Italian renaissance style\\" but the building is slightly limited by its corner site. Dale's final church, St. Swithun, Kennington (1956‚Äì58),Pevsner, 1966, page 159 is in a spacious churchyard that allowed Dale the space to use a more spacious cruciform plan. Most of Dale's churches share common features: a tympanum with bas-reliefs over the main door, pantiled roofs, an Italianate pent-roofed chimney for the boiler and in some cases a baldachin over the main altar and a pantiled bell-cot on the west gable. With the exception of St. Francis of Assisi (which is stuccoed) they are built of a modern buff brick that contrasts with traditional building materials in this part of England. The tympanum at St. Alban the Martyr was carved by John Brookes, then Principal of Oxford City Technical College. St. Francis' has also a set of Stations of the Cross carved by Eric Gill.Sherwood & Pevsner, 1974, page 339 Watercolours Dale was a watercolourist \\"of more than average ability\\" who was a member of local arts clubs in Oxford. He held a number of exhibitions of his work, which was compared with that of Paul Sandby. \\"Christ Church Mall\\" Towards a Plan for Oxford City, published in 1944 Central Oxford had become acutely congested with motor traffic in the 1920s and 1930s. When Dale first moved from Banbury to Oxford he practised from an office in Carfax \\"but the traffic there was shocking\\" so he gave up his office and practised from home. In September 1941 Dale published a six-page pamphlet called Christ Church Mall: a Diversion in which he proposed a relief road skirting the south side of Christ Church Meadow along the bank of the River Thames to link Abingdon Road and Iffley Road to bypass High Street.Dale, 1944, pages 9‚Äì10 In 1944 Dale expanded on his proposals into a 60-page book, Towards a Plan for Oxford City, illustrated with some of his own watercolours. In it he reiterated his \\"Christ Church Mall\\" road proposal and proposed extensive redevelopment of St. Clement's and St. Ebbes. In 1946 the County Borough of Oxford commissioned Thomas Sharp to make proposals to relieve Oxford's traffic and re-plan parts of the city. In 1948 Sharp published his report as a book, Oxford Replanned, in which he paid tribute: > Mr. Dale has presented his case very attractively and wittily, and has done > the city a considerable service in braving the controversy which was bound > to result from any attempt to touch even the hem of the sacred Christ Church > Meadow.Sharp, 1948, page 113 However, Sharp also thought that Dale's \\"Christ Church Mall\\" would be too indirect, particularly for traffic from Headington Hill and Marston Road.Sharp, 1948, pages 113‚Äì114 Sharp instead proposed a road across the northern side of Christ Church Meadow, which he called \\"Merton Mall\\" as it would have passed very close to Merton College.Sharp, 1948, pages 114‚Äì119 The Times also commended Dale for \\"presenting his case with architectural vision, wit and eloquence\\" in Towards a Plan for Oxford City, and quoted Dale's vision that \\"a finely designed parkway\\" would be \\"A beautiful road between the Towers and the Thames severally dreaming and streaming\\". Lawrence Dale's gravestone in Wolvercote Cemetery In 1956 the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation held an enquiry at which Dale continued to make his case. Dale told the enquiry: > nobody more than he admired the beauty of Christ Church Meadow, and anyone > who wanted a road through it was a vandal. But, he said, there was a vast > difference in having a road round the Meadow, as he was suggesting. The road > could be so landscaped that it could not be seen from the river or from the > north side of the meadow. The real beauty of the meadow was Merton Fields > and the Broad Walk, and that would be destroyed by Dr. Sharp's plan. Dale cited in his support Professor Sir Albert Richardson, then president of the Royal Academy, who \\"had said, in 1944, that Christ Church Meadow would suffer no detriment if skirted by a tree-lined road\\". Sharp's proposal was the subject of more than 20 years of political and public debate and protest. Neither Sharp's nor Dale's proposed road was ever built.

It is, however, very significant from the hydrographic point of view, for important rivers of the Iberian Peninsula have their source in these mountains, which divide the Atlantic from the Mediterranean watershed. Among the Iberian rivers that originate in the Montes Universales, the most important are the Tagus on the western slopes, and the T√∫ria, Cabriel and X√∫quer on the eastern. The Montes Universales are bordered by the paleozoic massifs of Caimodorro and Loma Alta in the northeast, by the Serran√≠a de Cuenca in the southeast, and by the Sierra de Jabal√≥n and the T√∫ria Valley in the east. Flora and fauna These mountains are covered with, mostly not very dense, clumps of pine, oak and Iberian juniper forest. Radiocarbon samples from Ojos del Tremedal show that birches, now almost absent from these mountains, were very common in the Montes Universales during the ice age around 9,600 years ago.

He joined the British Army early in the First World War, and won the Military Medal during mid-1916 while serving in the ranks. He transferred into, and was commissioned in, the Royal Flying Corps in 1917.Franks (2007), p.51.

Beyond the Heroic Stereotype: Sidney Jeffryes and the Mythologising of Australian Antarctic History. Australian Humanities Review, (64), 1-23. was an early Australian wireless telegraphy operator. Trained by Australasian Wireless Co., Ltd., he was initially employed on coastal shipping and established at least one record for distance transmission. But he is best known for his service as the wireless officer at Cape Denison during the second year (February 1913 ‚àí December 1913) of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition under the command of explorer Douglas Mawson. His service ended in September 1913, two months prior to the relief of the shore party, when Jeffryes developed symptoms of paranoia and had to be relieved of his duties. Early life and family Jeffryes was born in Toowoomba, Queensland in 1884, second son of Henry Jeffryes and Helena (sometimes Ellen) Jeffryes n√©e White. His father was a postmaster and telegraphist with the Queensland Post and Telegraph and following federation with the Postmaster-General's Department. Sidney's given name is indexed as Sydney in the records of the Queensland Registrar of BMD, but this may simply be a transcription error. His father Henry was a child of Henry Jeffryes and Sarah Jeffryes n√©e Bland. After a long career with the Post Office, his father passed in 1910. His mother Helena was born in Essex in the UK and her father was William White. She died in 1932. There were at least seven children of the marriage: * Louisa Ellen. Married Thomas Maxwell Gibb in 1898. * Ivy Llalah (likely Lalla), born 1875. Married Walter Henry Donely in 1894. * Ida Dorothea Maud, born 1879. Married Robert George Denny in 1904. * Hulbert Trevannion, born 1881, died 1946. Teacher Gundiah (1910s). Married Isabel Jeffryes n√©e King (died 1946) in 1906. * Norma Fanny, born 1882. *Sidney (alt Sydney) Harry, born 1884. * Francis (\\"Frank') Edwin, born 1886. Died young in 1902 at Allora. * Constance (\\"Connie\\") Eva, born 1888. Died 1949. Achieved unwanted prominence in an inheritance dispute. The family grew up in Allora. His father Henry spent almost 20 years in the district from 1889. He was initially assistant in charge of the local post office, but in September 1899 was appointed officer in charge. The death due to pneumonia of Sidney's younger brother Frank in July 1902 was a major tragedy for the family. A marble mural tablet to Frank's life was unveiled at the Allora State School in December 1902. Sidney's father was transferred to the Emerald Post Office in April 1909, after nearly 20 years at Allora. The community held a public farewell for Henry at the Allora Town Hall and he was presented with a purse of sovereigns. By the time of the transfer to Emerald, Henry's family were mostly grown and his own health was failing. Only his wife relocated with him, and when he passed in 1910, there was little connection with Emerald and she relocated to the larger provincial centre of Toowoomba where she passed in 1932. Telegraphy was a major part of the activities of any rural post office and there can be no doubt that Sidney learned morse code and telegraphy with his father. The Postmaster-General's department discouraged any staff experiments in wireless after federation. But from 1897, news of Marconi's succession of wireless telegraphy achievements spanning greater and greater distances, filled the newspapers of the day. At this time many private experimenters were operating without licences and in a remote location such as Allora, the temptations to experiment would have been strong. Telegraphist The Commonwealth of Australia Gazette records Jeffryes as being employed on a temporary basis from 26 March 1909 as a Telegraphist at Sydney for a period of three months. This appointment was renewed again June 1909, September 1909, and finally December 1909. However, mere telegraphy did not offer the excitement or pecuniary rewards of a wireless operator of the day and his career progressed. Wireless training In the late 1800s, fitting of wireless equipment on the great steamships carrying mail between Great Britain and Australia was becoming commonplace and following Australia's belated establishment of a network of coastal stations from 1910, many of the larger coastal vessels around Australia were also fitted out. The Australasian Wireless Co., Ltd. won the contracts with the Australian Government to establish a network of coastal wireless stations around Australia using Telefunken transmitters and receivers. This gave the firm a strong marketing edge in the supply of equipment to local shipping to utilise the coastal station network. Frequently the sale package also included provision of skilled personnel to operate and maintain the equipment. While the Marconi Telefunken College of Telegraphy as a formal training facility had not yet been established, the company did undertake internal training of potential operators. Jeffryes is reported as having qualified as a wireless operator with Australasian Wireless Co., Ltd. Coastal shipping In October 1911, Jeffryes had a small taste of fame which was reported in the Sydney Sun: \\"Record by the Kyarra. Mr. S. H. Jeffryes, wireless operator on the A.U.S.N. Co.'s Kyarra, which was fitted up by the Australasian Wireless Co., Ltd., has put up a record for overland wireless messages between ships. His report says:‚Äî \\"Coming into Adelaide on the 18th Instant, distant from Adelaide 140 miles, I picked up the Cooma. This exceeds the records of that of the Cooma and Riverlna four months ago from Townsville to the Bight by a small margin of about 40 miles. The conditions were absolutely normal on the night, a fact which could hardly be said of the occasion four months ago, which was a night on which every operator got good distances, myself and the Levuka getting 2100 miles. It is claimed by the Cooma and Riverina that the distance was 2300 miles. This is not so, as direct it is not more than 1500 miles, but even this is equivalent to almost twice as much by sea. I thus claim to have established an Australasian record for transmission and reception over land, beating the previous one by 40 miles.\\" It was common in this era for ship wireless officers to move frequently between ships. At the time of Jeffryes' appointment to the AAE he was reported as having been most recently on the SS Westralia. Antarctic preparations The AAE expedition was the first Antarctic expedition in history, and the only one during the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration, to maintain radio contact with its country of origin. Only a high power facility of comparable capacity to those recently established at Sydney (VIS) and Perth (VIP) would have been capable of direct communication between Hobart and Cape Denison and this would have been prohibitively expensive and resource hungry for the expedition. It was decided to establish an intermediate station at Macquarie Island, and by halving the maximum distance for each signal to traverse, it was expected that the 2 kW Telefunken transmitters of the Australasian Wireless Co., Ltd. would enable reliable communication. Jeffryes had a keen interest in both Antarctica and wireless telegraphy and when the first call for applications to join the AAE was made, he sought an appointment as wireless operator. But at that time his length of experience as a telegraphist and wireless telegraphist was not great and he was not successful. Douglas Mawson appointed Walter Henry Hannam who was associated with the prominent patriot George Augustine Taylor and had himself been involved with the establishment of the Wireless Institute of Australia. A series of tragedies and mishaps had led to the Cape Denison shore base on Antarctica being kept open for a second winter, March‚ÄìDecember 1913. But there had been some tension between Mawson and Hannam and in January 1913, Hannam elected to return home after his year at Macquarie Island and Cape Denison. The intermediate station that he set up at Wireless Hill on Macquarie Island was fully functional and providing sterling service exchanging messages with the Hobart coastal station VIH. But there had been ongoing issues with both transmission and reception at Cape Denison, and only occasional messages were got out. This failure prevented the expedition fulfilling the terms of its contract with Australian and London Press in providing timely updates on the activities and status of the expedition. The replacement wireless officer would bring with him improved wireless telegraphy receivers (sensitivity of the crucial detectors was taking great strides at the time) which it was expected would make the Cape Denison station fully effective. An appeal was made for a wireless operator to serve during the second winter of the AAE, and now Jeffryes was given the appointment. In Antarctica Jeffryes arrived at the Cape Denison shore base in February 1913 as the base was enduring a near- nightmare situation. The expedition's leader and commander, Douglas Mawson, stumbled into the base, the sole survivor of a sled dog probe eastward along the previously unknown interior coastline of the Australian Antarctic Territory. As the new wireless operator, Jeffryes was able to start the relay of communications that would inform Australia of the expedition leader's survival. However, within days of Mawson's arrival, the Antarctic winter began. Mawson's expedition hut was located close to what was then the location of the South Magnetic Pole, and continued radio interference and static associated with polar conditions threatened the base's minimal ability to contact Macquarie Island. The expedition leader at first admired Jeffryes's assiduity with earphones and Morse-code key, but grew increasingly guarded in his praise. In Mawson's words, Jeffryes \\"applied himself to work with enthusiasm and perhaps an over-conscientious spirit.\\" Climate conditions outside the hut made winter outdoor exercise impossible, leading to cabin fever. All the expeditioners would have been familiar with tales of Antarctic winter madness and particularly the problems of the Belgian Antarctic Expedition. Conditions at Cape Denison were clearly worse than those on the Belgica due to the Katabatic wind which because of the unique geography is at its upper extreme in the vicinity. In July 1913, as Antarctica neared midwinter, wireless operator Jeffryes began to present symptoms of paranoia to his fellow shore-party winter explorers, none of whom knew how to receive or transmit messages in Morse code. Expedition leader Mawson began to encourage another expedition member, airman Frank Bickerton, to learn Morse code as quickly as possible. Jeffryes's condition waxed and waned; for some weeks his comrades believed he was recovering, but in September of the same year the radioman experienced a psychotic break and began transmitting a message, through Macquarie Island, to Australia. Declaring himself to be the only sane man on the expedition, Jeffryes accused all of his comrades of having joined a criminal conspiracy to murder him. Mawson thereupon relieved Jeffryes of his duties. Return home In December 1913, the expedition's vessel Aurora relieved the troubled Antarctic shore party. Jeffryes was excluded from the welcoming celebrations in Adelaide due to his medical status. Yet he was paid off two days after arrival at Adelaide. Mawson stated subsequently that he believed that Jeffryes had returned to full health: \\"Later on Jeffreys improved, and on the arrival of the ship he became quite normal, and in that condition he was landed at Adelaide we believing that he would never again have any further trouble of the kind. On the return voyage Dr. Maclean occupied the same cabin with him, and kept him closely under observation. Dr. Maclean reported to me that Jeffreys was quite well and no thought ever entered our mind that he would not travel straight home without risk. In fact his condition was so good that I decided not to make any mention of the matter to his people.\\" In March 1914 it was realised that Jeffryes had not returned to the family home in Toowoomba and was missing. Six days later he was found near Stawell, exhausted and starved, having lived on roots and grubs, and drinking water from stagnant pools. He was arrested, clearly in a psychotic break and presented at the Stawell Court. His poignant plea from the dock was \\"Let me go back and die, where I have hidden my trunk, in the silence of the ranges.\\" The Court committed Jeffryes to the Ararat Asylum. His mental condition was diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenia while he was confined to the Ararat Lunatic Asylum in Ararat, Victoria. Letters from the health center, written to Mawson in 1915, testify to his challenges. Little is known of his later life. He died under confinement in 1942Alone on the Ice: The Best Survival Story You've Never Heard  Nat Geo Live https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lkS5psgo6Q from a cerebral haemorrhage. Legacy and late life Jeffryes' meticulous records of wireless reception quality during the second year of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition were correlated by himself, and by other expeditioners, with other observations of variables such as magnetic readings, auroral intensity, and St Elmo's Fire. These identified, perhaps for the first time, the impacts of Antarctic conditions upon low frequency radio wave propagation. The expedition's head and designated spokesman, Douglas Mawson, had little to say in his published histories about Jeffryes' active service in Antarctica. For almost 100 years, the unfortunate wireless operator's name was suppressed from most Antarctic records. But in August 2010, the Australian Antarctic Division honored Jeffryes for his pioneering winter service by naming a previously unnamed glacier after him. The Jeffryes Glacier is located at 67¬∞4' South, 143¬∞59' East, in the Australian Antarctic Territory. It should not be confused with the Jeffries Glacier. In December 2013, the first opera to be based on Mawson's 1911‚Äì14 expedition to Antarctica, The Call of Aurora (by Tasmanian composer Joe Bugden) was performed at The Peacock Theatre in Hobart. A chamber opera, The Call of Aurora investigates the relationship between Douglas Mawson and his wireless operator, Sidney Jeffryes. References Further reading * Australian Antarctic Division.
