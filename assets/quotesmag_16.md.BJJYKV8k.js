It was released by Tico Records in 1970. The album combines modern salsa renditions of Cuban standards on side A with experimental descargas (jam sessions) on side B. Since its release, the album has been praised by critics such as John Storm Roberts for its innovative approach. Background and recording Throughout the 1960s, pianist Eddie Palmieri played an important role in the development of salsa with his conjunto La Perfecta. La Perfecta was one of the first Latin ensembles to feature multiple trombones, one of salsa's distinctive characteristics. The band's repertoire was inspired by Cuban and Puerto Rican dance-oriented styles such as guaracha, son, pachanga and bomba. In 1968, Palmieri disbanded La Perfecta in order to seek a more experimental approach incorporating funk and soul elements into his music. Palmieri and his new ensemble (still similar to La Perfecta, with Barry Rogers being replaced by Lewis Kahn) recorded a series of four albums for Tico that have been said to contain his \\"best sounding\\" work. These four albums were Champagne (1968), Justicia (1969), Superimposition (1970) and V√°monos pa'l monte (1971). Despite his experimental approach, most of his recordings remained largely based on the basic structures of son montuno, as exemplified by \\"(Se acab√≥) la malanga\\" and \\"(Dame un cachito) pa' huele\\" on Superimposition.Davies (2003) pp. 118, 120. The former was written by Rudy Calzado specifically for this album, whereas the latter is an Arsenio Rodr√≠guez composition from 1946.Davies (2003) p. 118. A rendition of Guillermo Rodr√≠guez Fiffe's \\"Bilongo\\" (a guaracha written in 1937) closes side A, and is considered together with \\"La malanga\\" as one of the \\"most representative [tracks] of the hard-core Palmieri salsa style\\".Gerard (2001) p. 110. In addition, \\"Bilongo\\" has been described as \\"one of the most important salsa-era recordings to feature the soloing of Armenteros\\".Davies (2003) p. 119. The recordings present in side B are instrumental descargas (Latin jam sessions). Particularly important is the presence of Alfredo \\"Chocolate\\" Armenteros, who had also taken part in the recording of 1950s descarga sessions with artists such as Tojo and Chico O'Farrill's All-Stars Cubano.Gerard (2001) p. 112. Unlike older descargas, Palmieri combines modal phrases and montuno patterns, and adds \\"harmonically advanced chord voicings, substitutions and alterations\\" to his guajeos. The title of the last track on the album, \\"17.1\\", corresponds to the average age of the percussion section. Fania Records (owner of the Tico Records catalogue) re-issued the album on CD in 2006. Reception John Storm Roberts wrote a laudatory review in which he praised Palmieri's improvisatory and innovative style, particularly the way in which he \\"mixes offbeat montunos with unconventional chors, expressionism, and straight jazz, in blends different from any other jazz or Latin pianist\\". AllMusic awarded the album 4.5 starts out of 5. The album's artwork by Ely Besalel has been described as a \\"layered, abstract collage work\\" and has received positive reviews.

The wife of Charles Benedict Davenport, a prominent eugenicist, she co-authored several works with her husband. Together, they were highly influential in the United States eugenics movement during the progressive era. Life Gertrude Anna Crotty was born 28 February 1866, in Asequa, Colorado (near Denver), to parents William and Millie (Armstrong) Crotty. She graduated from University of Kansas in 1889 where she stayed as an instructor for three years until she went to pursue a higher degree. She then became a graduate student at Radcliffe College (then known as the Society for Collegiate Instruction of Women). There are conflicting facts about her time at Radcliffe. According to Marilyn Bailey Ogilvie, she was there for two years but did not complete her degree. According to Nicole Hahn Rafter, she was there for five years doing graduate work in zoology and wrote her book The Primitive Streak and Notochordal Canal in Chelonia (1896). Tamsen Wolff said that she did earn her PhD in zoology. While attending Radcliffe, she met Charles Davenport, who was one of her zoology instructors. She married Charles in Burlington, Kansas on June 23, 1894 and went on to have three children. The eldest child was Millia Crotty Davenport, who was born on 30 March 1895. The middle child, Jane Joralemon Davenport, was born on 11 September 1897. The youngest, Charles Benedict Davenport Jr., was born on 8 January 1911. Gertrude died on 8 March 1946, in Upper Nyack, New York at the age of 80. Scientific Work Davenport worked alongside her husband in the field of eugenics. Together they went to Cold Spring Harbor, New York in 1893 and stayed there working in a biology lab with microscopic methods until 1903. Afterwards she took on an unpaid position to work alongside Charles and assisted him in his research. This was research on experimental evolution and she collaborated with him on the books that he published. She also co-authored with him on a number of other of his works. While in Cold Spring Harbor, they bought a house with 6 acres on the coast. This residency was used for the laboratory staff to rent out while they did research on the heredity of humans. Gertrude later added 19 acres of land and it was named after her. Gertrude and Charles did work on heredity which included studying eye, hair, and skin color of humans. She also did research on embryology using turtles, studied the differences between Sargatia (a type of sea anemone) and starfish as well the variations on other organisms. She encouraged her husband to continue working on Sir Francis Galton‚Äôs work on eugenics using Mendelian genetics. Together they worked on eugenics to breed better humans. They claimed that this type of eugenics, called negative eugenics, was a necessity. She was worried that people who were feeble-minded, would hide their heredity. Published Work Gertrude and Charles Davenport had a productive working relationship which yielded many scientific works through the years. They produced two textbooks, the first of which was written for secondary students titled Introduction to Zoology. The second textbook was titled Elements of Zoology: To Accompany the Field and Laboratory Study of Animals and was to be used as a guide for zoology studies and experimentation. Charles and Gertrude's studies on genetics included Heredity of Skin Pigmentation in Man, Heredity of Eye Color in Man, and Heredity of Hair-Form in Man. During the course of these studies and publications, the Davenports explored how human traits, specifically skin pigmentation, eye color, and hair characteristics, were passed on to the next generation with Mendelian genetics. Each study also included a \\"practical application\\" statement on how the marriage of two individuals with certain traits influences the passing of said traits. Gertrude also individually authored the monographs The Primitive Streak and Notochordal Canal in Chelonia (1896) and Variation in the Number of Stripes on the Sea-anemone, Sagartia luciae (1902). In the former study, the notochordal canal in turtle embryos was observed as the embryos developed. This study produces a series of descriptions of how the notochordal canal develops and some implications based on its development. In the latter study, samples of Sargatia were taken from Cold Spring Harbor and examined in a laboratory. Under a microscope, the sea anemones' cell division was examined in both natural conditions and artificially placed strain. During and after the division processes, the various stripe characteristics were noted and recorded from different samples.

The cars remained in use until June 2, 1995 when the reconstruction started. The MR-90 entered service late in 1995. Several have been preserved.  Design  CCF built six motor cars and twelve trailers. As designed the motor cars seated 88 while the trailers, which included restrooms, seated 84. Vestibules connected the cars. The standard formation consisted of a motor car and two trailers; the motor cars always led outbound trains from Central Station. The interiors were green pastel with maroon upholstery. Exteriors were standard Canadian National: green with orange ends; later repainted gray and black with red ends. The doors and pantographs (on motor cars only) were painted red. The cars used 2400 V DC via overhead collection.  History  CCF delivered the cars in June and they entered service on September 23, 1952. The cars were originally numbered M-1 through M-6 (motor cars) and T-1 through T-12 (trailers). The motors cars were renumbered 6730‚Äì6735 in 1969, while the trailer cars were renumbered 6739‚Äì6749.

It is one of Osnabr√ºck‚Äôs most important buildings and emblems and continues to be used as the city‚Äôs town hall today. The Treaty of Westphalia was negotiated and signed by the combatants of the Thirty Years‚Äô War at the town halls of Osnabr√ºck and M√ºnster in 1648.  History  Osnabr√ºck‚Äôs old town hall at the Markt (market place) continued to be used into the 16th century. However during the previous century, the council of the Hansestadt (Hanseatic city) of Osnabr√ºck had ordered the construction of a new town hall. Construction started in 1487; in 1505 the building was topped out. In 1512 the construction of Osnabr√ºck‚Äôs new town hall was completed. However, it was not until 1575 when the interior decoration was finally finished. The final years of the Thirty Years‚Äô War were the most significant in the building's history. From 1643 to 1648 part of the delegations sent by the combatants in the Thirty Years‚Äô War sat in Osnabr√ºck's town hall to negotiate a peace settlement. The eventual outcome was the ‚ÄúWestf√§lischer Frieden von Osnabr√ºck und M√ºnster‚Äù (Westphalian Peace Treaty of Osnabr√ºck and M√ºnster), signed in 1648. Among those who sat in the town hall of Osnabr√ºck were the envoys representing the Kingdom of Sweden along with those representing the emperor and also the imperial estates; in contrast those representing the emperor and France negotiated simultaneously at the town hall in M√ºnster. Today the negotiations are commemorated by portraits of the 42 European envoys at the Friedenskongress (peace congress), positioned around the walls of the Friedenssaal (Hall of Peace) in the town hall. In addition there are three portraits of the rulers of the main combatant nations: Christina, Queen of Sweden, Louis XIV of France, and German Emperor Ferdinand III. From 1846 to 1880 the town hall‚Äôs original Friedenssaal was converted into a so-called ‚ÄúPrunkhalle‚Äù (luxury hall). This modification was undone at the start of the 20th century, restoring the Friedenssaal to its original state. On 13 September 1944 the town hall of Osnabr√ºck was struck numerous times by Allied (especially British) bombs during air raids and severely damaged. The town hall was burned down to its foundation walls. As almost all of the historic furnishings of the town hall had been placed in storage some time earlier on account of the local population's expectation of eventual destruction, the majority of the interior decorations were saved. On 24 October 1948 ‚Äì just in time for the 300th anniversary celebrations of the Peace of Westphalia ‚Äì the restored town hall, along with its historic furnishings, was officially reopened for business.  Structural information  The town hall of Osnabr√ºck is built in the late Gothic style. The exterior design of the building makes a considerable impact on the observer. The frontal view is characterised by an 18-metre-high hipped roof, whose height is almost equal to that of the rest of the building from the foundation slab to the eaves. A total of six towers are positioned at the lower end of the roof, reminiscent of watchtowers and corner towers of a fortress. In addition there has been a large flight of steps in front of the town hall since 1846, leading to the roughly 500-year-old entrance door from two sides (previously accessed via a retractable set of wooden steps). The handle of this door is made of heavy bronze and displays the year ‚Äú1648‚Äù; it also features a dove. A statue of Charlemagne ‚Äì founder of the city and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Osnabr√ºck ‚Äì stands above the entrance. Featured alongside him on both sides are the so-called ‚ÄúKaiser- Plastiken‚Äù (emperor sculptures): depicting the German emperors Sigismund, Frederick II (House of Hohenstaufen), Rudolf of Habsburg, Wilhelm I (also King of Prussia), Frederick Barbarossa, Arnulf of Carinthia, Maximilian I and Ludwig the Bavarian. The statues were gifted to the town hall by the Prussian royal family in the 19th century, which explains the presence of the Prussian king and, later, German Emperor Wilhelm I in the row of emperors. The Friedensaal is located a few metres behind the entrance door to the left; directly opposite is the town hall treasury.

The word \\"mysticism\\" has its origin in ancient Greece where individuals called the mystae participated in mystery religions. The life of a medieval woman mystic was spent seeking unity with God in a series of stages. The mystical life of a medieval woman began with a purge of the spirit in which she released herself from earthly indulgences and attachments. In a state of contrition the medieval woman mystic faced suffering because of her past sins, and the mercy of God was revealed to her through penitence.Ross, Ellen. (1993) \\"'She Wept and Cried Right Loud for Sorrow and for Pain': Suffering, the Spiritual Journey, and Women's Experience in Late Medieval Mysticism.\\" In Maps of Flesh and Light: The Religious Experience of Medieval Women Mystics edited by Ulrike Wiethaus, 45-59.

New York: Syracuse University. p.47. During the compassion stage of suffering, the pain experienced by the medieval woman mystic \\"revealed the believer's love of Christ, fostered unity with Christ and the world, and began to draw the believer beyond the physical Jesus who suffered on the Cross to understand the immensity of the love that motivated Christ in the world to suffer on humanity's behalf\\".Ross, Ellen. (1993) \\"'She Wept and Cried Right Loud for Sorrow and for Pain': Suffering, the Spiritual Journey, and Women's Experience in Late Medieval Mysticism.\\" In Maps of Flesh and Light: The Religious Experience of Medieval Women Mystics edited by Ulrike Wiethaus, 45-59. New York: Syracuse University. p.58. Medieval women mystics experienced visions during what medieval historians refer to as the Illuminative stage of their lives that contained instructions from God and would communicate their revelations in written form. Medieval women as visionaries Visions occurred to the mystic in the form of raptures or ecstasies, out-of-body experiences during which the mystic was in a state of immobility, unresponsive to and disconnected from the outside world. The visions of most female mystics during the Middle Ages came in the form of mental images. > Medieval women mystics were considered prophets by their communities. During the Middle Ages, medieval interpretations of Biblical passages such as Corinthians 14:34 resulted in women being excluded from the Church's hierarchy and lacking the authority to impart Biblical wisdom. However, medieval women were thought to be more susceptible to experiencing a rapture based on Galen's writings on humor theory. Medieval theologians interpreted the feminine softness and coldness described by Galen as evidence that women were more impressionable to visions. Also, the Christian idea that God used humble beings as his vessels supported the ability of Medieval women to act as mystics. Authorization and legitimacy The legitimacy of the medieval woman mystic was gained through partnership with the Catholic Church and observed proof of physical suffering and deterioration. Medieval women mystics lived ascetic lives of severe fasting, abstinence, and isolation lifestyle choices that became physically debilitating and in some instances resulted in death. Medieval women mystics also used self-denigration in the published versions of their visions in order to both gain clerical approval of their revelations and showcase their status as God's humble servants. Physical proof The proof of a medieval woman's mystical ability was shown through physical suffering due to mortification of the flesh and by the wounds that symbolized the mystic's connection to Christ.Finke, Laurie A. (1993) \\"Mystical Bodies and the Dialogics of Vision.\\" In Maps of Flesh and Light: The Religious Experience of Medieval Women Mystics edited by Ulrike Wiethaus, 28-45. New York: Syracuse University. p.42. The presence of the Stigmata on a mystic's body served as divine evidence of her ability to communicate with God. Another sign of mystical ability was observed bleeding on Fridays during the hour of the Crucifixion. By the end of the Middle Ages the physical deterioration of the woman mystic's body was considered proof of her sanctity. Medieval women mystics were marked as special instances of God's grace because of their choice to suffer. Support from the Catholic Church Medieval women mystics were endorsed by the Church to reaffirm orthodox religion through their visions. The Latin church of the Middle Ages fought heresy with Scholasticism and the Inquisition and placed emphasis on the sacraments and models of exemplary religiosity. Mystics supported the Catholic Church's teaching of suffering on others' behalf in visionary journeys to Purgatory where they encountered suffering souls.McNamara, Jo Ann. (1993) \\"The Rhetoric of Orthodoxy: Clerical Authority and Female Innovation in the Struggle with Heresy\\" In Maps of Flesh and Light: The Religious Experience of Medieval Women Mystics edited by Ulrike Wiethaus, 9-27. New York: Syracuse University. p. 20. Medieval women mystics believed that their physical mortifications served as purgation for the sinful dead.McNamara, Jo Ann. (1993) \\"The Rhetoric of Orthodoxy: Clerical Authority and Female Innovation in the Struggle with Heresy\\" In Maps of Flesh and Light: The Religious Experience of Medieval Women Mystics edited by Ulrike Wiethaus, 9-27. New York: Syracuse University. p.20. Through prayer medieval women mystics released souls from Purgatory. Medieval women mystics showed particular obedience to their confessor. Confession became a key part of female piety because of the Fourth Lateran Council of 1215 which made confession a more integral part of medieval life. During confession, female mystics would discuss their revelations and establish a partnership with their confessor, who often circulated the accounts of the mystic's revelations throughout the Christian community. The authorization of the Catholic Church distinguished the heretic from the pious mystic. The mystic Marguerite Porete was burned for heresy by the inquisition in France in 1310 after her text The Mirror of Simple Souls was deemed unorthodox. Conversely, Hildegard of Bingen became an ally of Pope Eugenius III and Bernard of Clairvaux in their fight against German heresy in 1147.McNamara, Jo Ann. (1993) \\"The Rhetoric of Orthodoxy: Clerical Authority and Female Innovation in the Struggle with Heresy\\" In Maps of Flesh and Light: The Religious Experience of Medieval Women Mystics edited by Ulrike Wiethaus, 9-27. New York: Syracuse University. p.12. According to Petroff, Medieval women mystics \\"inspired Christian leaders who synthesized Christian tradition and proposed new models for the Christian community.\\" Mysticism in Beguine communities Beguine communities originated in Northern Europe during the twelfth century. Fried, Johannes (2015). The Middle Ages. Cambridge: Harvard University Press. p.267. The Beguines were groups of women who lived together, supported themselves through manual labor, provided charity to the sick and the poor, and devoted their lives to spiritual growth. The Beguines also performed acts of penitence such as self-flagellation, fasting, and vigils. The Beguine communities were supported by Pope Gregory IX during the thirteenth century and sparked a resurgence in female religiosity. Beguine mystics were seen as the brides of Christ and living saints during the Middle Ages. Growing suspicion in the later Middle Ages Toward the end of the Middle Ages, from the thirteenth century onward, women mystics faced greater scrutiny due to the growing prominence of inquisitional procedure. In Germany during the fourteenth century, the clergy began to greatly restrict the religious lives of women. The Council of Vienne, in 1311, condemned religious women who preached and lived outside a monastery without the direct supervision of a cleric, thus putting an end to the Beguine movement.McNamara, Jo Ann. (1993) \\"The Rhetoric of Orthodoxy: Clerical Authority and Female Innovation in the Struggle with Heresy\\" In Maps of Flesh and Light: The Religious Experience of Medieval Women Mystics edited by Ulrike Wiethaus, 9-27. New York: Syracuse University. p.22. Scholastics in the universities began to propose that inquisitional processes should be employed to weed out heresy among women mystics. Jean Gerson, a chancellor of the University of Paris, believed the church's corruption and laxity was the cause of widespread acceptance of female mystics.McNamara, Jo Ann. (1993) \\"The Rhetoric of Orthodoxy: Clerical Authority and Female Innovation in the Struggle with Heresy\\" In Maps of Flesh and Light: The Religious Experience of Medieval Women Mystics edited by Ulrike Wiethaus, 9-27. New York: Syracuse University. p.25. Gerson wanted to create a permanent post of the Inquisition that investigated mystics and their visions.McNamara, Jo Ann. (1993) \\"The Rhetoric of Orthodoxy: Clerical Authority and Female Innovation in the Struggle with Heresy\\" In Maps of Flesh and Light: The Religious Experience of Medieval Women Mystics edited by Ulrike Wiethaus, 9-27. New York: Syracuse University. p.24. In the Rhineland and Southern France from 1318 to 1328, Dominican inquisitors began to burn Beguines and other religious women at the stake in response to the papal bull Quum Inter NonnullosQuum inter nonnullos (English translation 1); Quum inter nonnullos(English translation 2) of John XXII which condemned poverty-based religiosity.McNamara, Jo Ann.

New York: Syracuse University. p. 22. By the end of the fifteenth century, the mystical marriage of the medieval woman mystic's marriage with Christ had come to be viewed as a copulation with devil by the Dominicans.McNamara, Jo Ann. (1993) \\"The Rhetoric of Orthodoxy: Clerical Authority and Female Innovation in the Struggle with Heresy\\" In Maps of Flesh and Light: The Religious Experience of Medieval Women Mystics edited by Ulrike Wiethaus, 9-27. New York: Syracuse University. p.26. Some notable medieval women mystics=Catherine of Siena (1347-1380) Catherine of Siena was the daughter of a lower-class wool dyer and lived through the Black Death. She vowed her virginity to God at the age of seven. At fifteen she cut her hair in protest of marriage. After she was scarred by a case of smallpox at seventeen, her parents allowed her to join a third-order Dominican group called the Mantellate due to her reduced marriage prospects. Catherine chose to remain at home and it was there, at the age of twenty, that she experienced a \\"mystical espousal\\" where she became one with Christ. Catherine was an active minister to the poor and sick and became renowned. In 1370, she had a \\"mystical death\\" during which she and Christ exchanged hearts. During the Babylonian Captivity, Catherine prophesied a three-step plan to re-establish a moral and peaceful Christendom: the return of the papacy to Italy, the establishment of peace among the warring Italian factions, and a Crusade to the Islamic world. In 1347, the mystic was brought to Florence and examined on her beliefs and activities by the General Chapter of her order. On April 1, 1375, Catherine had a vision in which she received the stigmata and prophesied the Great Schism which would occur in 1379. In 1376 she helped convince Pope Gregory XI to return to Rome. The years before her death she lived in Rome as an advisor to the pope. She died in 1380 at the age of 33. In 1378 Catherine of Siena published her visions in the Dialogue. The Dialogue tells of a conversation between Catherine and God where God explains that Christ's crucifixion created a bridge between earth and heaven. Christians can reach heaven by walking across the bridge which requires removing themselves from earthly indulgences and acquiring a love of virtue. Margery Kempe (circa 1373-after 1439) Margery Kempe was born in King's Lynn in Norfolk, England. She married John Kempe at the age of twenty and suffered a health- afflicting pregnancy with her first child. She also owned and operated her own brewery and mill until they failed and she turned to devoting herself completely to her faith. During her marriage she heard voices and believed herself to be tortured by demons. One day she had a vision of Christ sitting beside her; from that point on, Margery was rejuvenated with a great passion for her faith but did not act upon this passion until after she experienced years of temptations. Margery went on pilgrimages to the Holy Land, Assisi, Rome and Germany. In one of her visions, she saw herself as a maid and servant to Saint Anne and then the Virgin Mary whom she accompanied to Bethlehem with Saint Joseph; she was then present for the birth of Christ. In another vision, Jesus granted Margery the right to not fast on Fridays so that her husband would agree to allow her to choose a life of celibacy. When her husband had a near fatal fall down the stairs, God answered her prayers, allowing her husband to live, but required that she looked after him. Other than her visions, a large part of Kempe's mystic identity was based on her displays of ‚Äúpassionate, full- bodied, audible, and sermon- disrupting wailing‚Äù. Nearly all of what is known of Margery's life is due to the publication of her autobiography The Book of Margery Kempe. Julian of Norwich (1342-after 1416) Julian of Norwich was an anchoress at the Church of Saint Julian at Conisford, England. Little is known of her family background but she lived during the Hundred Years War and Great Schism. Julian lived in an anchorhold which was a small house isolated from the community with few rooms and a garden used for sustenance. In 1373 she experienced the \\"Showings,\\" which was a mystical experience in which numerous revelations and images were revealed to her at one time. In the \\"Showings\\" Julian witnessed the Crucifixion, had a conversation with Christ, then witnessed the Virgin Mary during the Annunciation, and saw an image of the devil. Another vision of Julian is of the Lord and a servant who in attempting to leave to do God's will stumbles and suffers in pain. According to Julian, the servant represents Adam and humankind, is unaware that the Lord continues to look upon the servant with grace and kindness despite his failings. Julian published her visions in the 1395 book Revelations of Divine Love. Hildegard of Bingen (1098-1179) The religious career of Hildegard of Bingen began at seven when she joined her aunt Jutta, a recluse. Their retreat was later turned into a convent where Hildegard became a nun at fourteen. She wrote letters, visions, prophecies, songs, and morality plays. She was known as a prophet to all her contemporaries such as Bernard of Clairvaux. Hildegard had visions since the age of five. According to her she experienced two types of spiritual visions: \\"the Living Light\\" in which she could see nothing and \\"the Shade of the Living Light\\" where there was a diffused radiance. In Scivias, published between 1151 and 1152, Hildegard recounted twenty six visions. A description of one her visions in Book 2 in Sciviasillustrates the form in which divine revelation manifested to her: \\"Then I saw a most splendid light, and in the light, the whole of which burnt in a most beautiful, shining fire, was the fire of a man of the sapphire colour, and that most splendid light poured over the whole of that shining fire, and the shining fire over all that splendid light, and that most splendid light and shining fire over the whole figure of the man, appearing one light in one virtue and power. And again I heard that living Light saying to me: This is the meaning of the mysteries of God, that it may be discerned and understood discreetly what that fulness may be, which is without beginning and to which nothing is wanting, who by the most powerful strength plated all the strong places.\\" Marguerite Porete (1250-1310) Marguerite Porete was a French Beguine from Hainault who lived during the late thirteenth and early fourteenth century. She published The Mirror of Simple Souls in the vernacular French and was arrested on charges of heresy in 1310. She refused to give testimony during her inquisition trial in Paris. The University of Paris, after surveying some passages of her book, deemed her a relapsed heretic because she had been accused instances prior to her last arrest. Porete sent her book to three scholars who approved and published the text. The Mirror of Simple Souls was widely circulated and translated into Latin, Italian, and Middle English. Unlike other female mystics, Porete publicly taught the message of her revelations. Similar to Hildegard of Bingen she dispensed with male ecclesiastic representation. However, in the case of Porete she was found guilty by the Inquisition and burned at the stake in 1310. In The Mirror of Simple Souls Porete explained the different states of the soul. She explained: \\"And therefore this Soul knows only him, and loves only him, praises only him, for there is only he. Because what is exists by his goodness, and God loves his goodness whenever he has bestowed it, and his goodness bestowed is God himself, and God cannot depart from his goodness so that it doesn't dwell in him, thus he is what goodness is and goodness is what God is. And therefore Goodness sees itself by means of his goodness through divine light in the sixth state, by which the Soul is purified.\\" Notes Mysticism Women and religion ","title":"Medieval women's mysticism"},{"id":"48500285","text":"Dominique Coene and Kristof Vliegen were the defending champions, but they did not compete in the Juniors this year.

The game is similar to the Atari arcade game Avalanche, replacing the buckets and boulders with a hen trying to catch her eggs. History Mike Potter joined Synapse in 1981 after writing the game Protector and initially distributing it through another company, Crystalware. When he questioned his royalties, they released the game back to him. He rereleased a version through Synapse with a number of bug fixes. Chicken was his first game written entirely at Synapse, and the first whose idea was given to him by Synapse's founder, Ihor Wolosenko. Wolosenko's primary inspiration was arcade games, and many of Synapse's releases from this era are adaptations of contemporary games for the Atari platform. Wolosenko had also come up with the idea for Slime and assigned it to a new programmer, but Potter had to take over development of that game as well, once development on Chicken was complete. Gameplay Scene near the opening of Chicken Chicken is conceptually a port of the 1978 arcade game Avalanche, but with a number of twists. The player is in control of a chicken that can move horizontally back and forth along the bottom of the playfield, pushing a basket. At the top, a fox drops the chicken's eggs over a series of moving blocks. The eggs fall through gaps between the blocks, which randomize their final drop point. If an egg reaches the ground, it cracks open and hatches into a chick. These form barriers to motion for the player, but the chicken can jump over them by pressing the fire button. If a player steps on a chick, a farmer appears and kicks you off the screen. The action increases in pace until it becomes extremely fast-paced. The game can be played with a joystick, but is best played with a paddle controller. Up to four players can be in a single game, but they take turns using the single controller. Reception Creative Computing called the game \\"silly, but fun\\" and noted that the players often broke out laughing. They also noted its pace, saying \\"Ever hear the term 'twitch game?' This game may be its namesake.\\" See also * Eggomania, an Atari 2600 game with similar gameplay and theme released the following year ReferencesExternal links * 1982 video games Atari 8-bit family games Atari 8-bit family-only games Synapse Software games Video game clones Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Chicken (video game)"},{"id":"48500330","text":"Bijdragen tot de Geschiedenis was a Belgian history journal, published from 1902 to 2005.

She was the first Black woman to earn a doctorate in mathematics in Cuba. Early life When Argelia Velez-Rodriguez was growing up, her father worked in the government under Cuba's leader, Fulgencio Batista. At the start of Batista's governing, he improved the Cuban educational system. Her family was Roman Catholic, so she was educated in Roman Catholic primary and secondary school. During her schooling, teachers noticed her interest in mathematics, and she won a mathematic competition at age 9. Education Velez-Rodriguez obtained her bachelor's degree at the Marianao Institute in 1955. She continued her studies at the University of Havana earning a Ph.D in 1960. Her instructors at these institutions were women with doctorates in mathematics. Only a small percentage of the Cuban population was black, so although all of her instructors were women with doctorates in mathematics, she would be the first black woman to earn a doctorate in Cuba. According to a quote from Velez-Rodriguez, she did not experience racial discrimination in Cuba. The only time she did was at places that were owned or controlled by the United States. Her doctoral studies consisted of differential equations and astronomical orbits, and her dissertation was the Determination of Orbits Using Talcott's Method where she earned her PhD in mathematics in 1960 with a dissertation on the application of differential equations to astronomy entitled \\"Determination of Orbits Using Talcott's Method\\". Career In 1962, she decided to emigrate to the United States with her son and her daughter, followed by her husband three years later. Texas College is where she held first United States teaching position in 1962, and she taught math and physics. By 1972, she was a professor at Bishop College in Texas, and she was a department chair for mathematics from 1975‚Äì1978. She left Bishop in 1979 and was hired by the National Science Foundation to work with the Minority Science Improvement Program. In 1980 she was hired by the U.S. Department of Education to direct the Minority Science Improvement Program.

He also worked on the film West Bank Brooklyn.  Early life  Ghazi Albuliwi was born in Jordan and moved to Brooklyn as an infant. His mother is from a village near Haifa, Israel. Although he believes his family fled in 1948. He spoke Arabic at home, but had a diverse set of friends, notably Latino, African-American, and Italian children. He started doing stand up comedy when he was 17.  Peace after Marriage  Ghazi Albulwi was inspired to make this film while sitting at a cafe in Jerusalem trying to make a comedy. Then when he saw a group of Israelis laughing he was inspired to make something they would laugh at and change any prior notions of someone who happens to be Arab. Ghazi has stated in an interview for the Huffington Post, \\"Call me idealistic but at the moment, sitting near these Israelis I said to myself: \\"Write a movie where they would laugh and forget you were Arab.\\" The film Peace After Marriage had its world premier at the 2013 Abu Dhabi Film Festival. The film is about a Muslim Palestinian-American man in New York who marries an Israeli Jewish woman, who is desperate for a Green Card. On November 30 it was featured in the Jerusalem Jewish Film Festival. According to The New York Times, Peace After Marriage, \\"a $1 million Turkish-French-American production that has picked up several festival awards, is something different.\\" Titled ‚ÄúOnly in New \\"York‚Äù in Europe. Peace after Marriage won the award \\"Best Script\\" in 2010 when it went through the Tribecca All Access program through the Tribecca Film Institute. Additional funding came post-production where Good Lap Production helped to complete the picture as well as the music score. Hiam Abbass played the role of Albulwi's mother in the film. Ghazi Albulwi was a finalist for the Nicholl Fellowship award given by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Ghazi Albulwi was a finalist for his role as Arafat.  General Themes  Ghazi Albulwi is known for using themes relating to non-belonging. Common uses of this are in his works that make use of cultural and ethnicity differences. Ghazi credits his work with the notion that he wants to change one opinion one culture has of someone from another culture. Ghazi Albulwi believes that laughter and subsequently humor does not have any boundary, whether it is a territory, religion, or barrier of other sorts. Ghazi Albulwi, as an Arab-American knows what it has felt like to be a part of a culture and religion where there is current conflict and wants to help change the way people feel about the religion and culture so that those who are among that culture do not need to feel \\"pain of living through it\\" When questioned about a solution for the situation where the cultures clash with one another Ghazi Albuwi stated, \\"Sexual jihad: one big orgy with the Arabs and the Jews, where we release all our hostilities, and I hope I‚Äôm right in the middle of it.‚Äù Although after this use of humor in Abu Dhabi, a journalist ended up canceling interviews. Albuwi wants to promote a place where culture and religion is not as important and people can get along without having these prior notions and potential hostilities. Albuwi wants his work to have both people of Jewish culture and Arab culture in a room together where they can just laugh. Something that is funny does not need to have politics, religion, and culture behind it. Because of this, he does not want a film where the viewer is thinking about past wars as well as the violence between the two religions. For him, art has the power to make a person question how they feel in subtle yet powerful way.

Digital Red Intercable has the backing of a strong infrastructure of knowledge that gives the cable operator advice and assistance, both technical and commercial.  History  The roots of Red Intercable are linked to the very origin of cable television in Argentina. In the 60s, small entrepreneurs in the interior, at their own risk and effort, developed networks in remote towns of the great capitals that were not in reach of the air television. In the 90s, driven by the various provincial associations, an organization of cable operators emerged. This organization grouped both of Argentina's largest operators of small systems, as Cable Television. In 1998, during one of the concentration processes that took place in Argentina, separate cable operators created Red Intercable SA.

He is a descendant of the Byzantine imperial dynasty of the Komnenoi, specifically of the branch that ruled the Empire of Trebizond, and is often regarded as the last member of the family. Origin Based on the date of his baptism (26 January 1658), John was born in mid-December 1657 at Heraclea Perinthus. The Romanian scholars Nicolae Iorga and N. Vatamanu considered John to hail from Lesbos, but it is securely attested that John was born in Heraclea; in a work whose edition he supervised, he calls himself \\"Perinthian\\" after the city's ancient name. According to a document he commissioned from the Metropolitan of Heraclea, Neophytus III, in September 1695, John was the son of Alexios Komnenos, surnamed \\"Molyvdos\\", who had been consecrated as a priest in 1656. Alexios in turn was the son of Theodore Komnenos, who died in 1637; the document traces the ancestry through four more generations to another Theodore Komnenos, who in 1480 settled with his family at Heraclea. According to the document, this Theodore was the great-grandson of the Emperor of Trebizond Basil Megas Komnenos (). Early life and career as a physician and scholar=Education After completing his elementary education in his home town, John left to attend the Patriarchal Academy in the nearby capital of the Ottoman Empire, Constantinople. He probably attended the school in 1676‚Äì80‚Äîthe exact dates are unknown‚Äîand studied theology, philosophy, grammar, and medicine. His enrollment in the school was a decisive moment in his career, as he made many acquaintances from among the circle of Ottoman Greek scholars of Constantinople, with whom he would maintain close relations in later years; among them were his teachers Sevastos Kyminitis and Antonios Spandonis, the Metropolitan of Adrianople Neophytus Filaretos, the Archbishop of Nyssa Germanus, the future Patriarch of Jerusalem Chrysanthos Notaras, and Ioannis Karyofyllis. Patriarch Dositheos II of Jerusalem Following his graduation, John was appointed a notary to the Patriarchate of Constantinople, but soon left the city for Ia»ôi, capital of Moldavia, where in October 1683 he published his first work, a collected edition of the works of Symeon of Thessalonica, together with Markos Eugenikos' treatise Exposition of the Church's Daily Prayer. It was dedicated to the Prince of Moldavia, George Ducas, who along with Patriarch Dositheos II of Jerusalem had sponsored the establishment of a Greek printing press in the CetƒÉ»õuia Monastery in the previous year. John had probably been recruited to staff the new enterprise. At the same time, he served as tutor to George Ducas' son Constantine, alongside the Phanariote scholars Azarias Kigalas and Skarlatos Spandonis. Moldavia entered a period of instability after 1683 with the fall of Ducas and a Tartar raid; the printing press seems to have suspended its operation until 1694, with the exception of a brief period in 1685 after the appointment of Constantin Cantemir to the voivodeship. John's activity during this period is unclear, but from a couple of letters to Neophytus of Adrianople it emerges that at least during the first year of Cantemir's rule he was at Ia»ôi, working as tutor to the new voivode's son Dimitrie Cantemir. Nevertheless, by the autumn of 1686 John had left Moldavia and gone to Padua, to study medicine at the University of Padua, which at the time was a popular destination for Greeks wishing to pursue higher education. Although already in 1686 Germanus of Nyssa offered him the position of court doctor in the Wallachian capital, Bucharest, in succession to the retiring Iakovos Pylarinos, John continued his studies at Padua despite his great financial difficulties, which were partly overcome with the financial support of the Karyofyllis family. During his studies at Padua he became a friend of the local English embassy official, as a result of which he participated in an official trip to England in early 1687. In December 1687 he succeeded in entering the Greek Palaiokapas college, and became a member of the Greek Community of Venice. Finally, on 23 January 1691, John received his diploma as a \\"doctor-philosopher\\" and left Italy. Service in Russia and wanderings From Italy, John moved to Russia, responding to an invitation to work at the Tsar's court, probably through the intercession of Pylarinos, who had been chief physician there in 1690, or the Greek-born Russian envoy to Venice, Ioannikios Leichoudes. From Venice John crossed the Polish Commonwealth and arrived at Kiev on 8 July 1691. His career at the Russian court is obscure, but Russian sources report that he succeeded Pylarinos as head physician when the latter left the country in 1692. During his stay in Moscow, in 1693, he translated from Latin to the vernacular Greek the medieval ecclesiastical treatise Quattor novissimom liber, and this was probably also the period when he composed four epigraphs on behalf of Tsar Peter the Great () and his brother Ivan V () for donations they made to Christian sites in the Holy Land. Despite his successful career at the Russian court, for unknown reasons John was not satisfied; a letter to Kyminitis (then headmaster of the Princely Academy of Bucharest) and his subsequent career show that he had sought the (unspecified) assistance of the Prince of Wallachia Constantin Br√¢ncoveanu (). He evidently obtained that in 1694, for in that year he was discharged from Russian service with a referral in Latin, signed by Tsar Peter himself, and by 29 September he was in Bucharest. He dedicated his next two translations into modern Greek, Diogenes La√´rtius' Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers and the Sayings of Kings and Commanders from Plutarch's Moralia, to Br√¢ncoveanu. John was evidently aiming for an appointment as court physician at Br√¢ncoveanu's court, but this did not happen. A possible explanation may lie in the falling out between Br√¢ncoveanu with John's patron, Dositheos II of Jerusalem, in the period 1692‚Äì1697. In letters of the period he inquires of his friends about the situation in Constantinople, and mentions an invitation by his former pupil, Constantine Ducas, then in his first (1693‚Äì1695) tenure as Prince of Moldavia, but John's actual whereabouts and activities until 1697 are largely unknown. If he went to Ia»ôi, he probably did not stay there long after Ducas' expulsion in December 1695 by Antioh Cantemir. During this time, he may have composed an epitaph for Theodoros Trapezountios, a professor at the Princely Academy, who died on 7 September 1695. At the same time he sought and obtained the certificate of his descent from the Komnenian emperors, and may then have gone to Constantinople, before going on pilgrimage to the Holy Land. He was again at Constantinople sometime before February 1697, when Patriarch Adrian of Moscow sent letters to Chrysanthos Notaras inquiring about John and proposing him as the successor of the Leichoudes brothers at the helm of the Slavic Greek Latin Academy in Moscow. Adrian also proposed to ask John to supervise the establishment of a Greek printing press there, a project sponsored both by Adrian and Dositheos II of Jerusalem. John was interested, but evidently troubled about the conditions prevailing in Russia, for in a letter by Dositheos to Adrian, dated 6 March 1698, Dositheos reported that John was willing to accept, but only under specific conditions: that he would be allowed to exercise his medical skills alongside his scholarly duties; that he would be provided with sufficient remuneration during his stay; and that, as soon as the main task, the establishment of the Greek press, was completed, he would be allowed to leave for the Danubian Principalities. Dositheos, who may have shared in John's reservations, recommended acceptance of his terms, with a proposed contract for five years. Nothing came of this, however, especially in the tumultuous political and religious climate in Russia following Adrian's death in 1700 and the reforms of Peter the Great. Service in Wallachia Constantin Br√¢ncoveanu, Prince of Wallachia and John's patron In the meantime, however, John had entered the far more familiar, and lucrative, service of the Wallachian court. Already in summer 1697 his name appears in the fiscal records as a court physician, alongside Pylarinos and another Greek, Pantaleon Kalliarchis. John was further assigned the duty of accompanying Wallachian troops in the field‚Äîas an Ottoman vassal, Wallachia was involved in the Great Turkish War‚Äîand equipped with a cart for carrying wounded soldiers. He remained in the Wallachian court until 1702, with an annual salary of 800 thalers initially, rising to 1,000 after autumn 1700. This period was one of the most productive in John's career: enjoying a good salary and the favour of both Br√¢ncoveanu and his influential uncle, stolnic Constantin Cantacuzino, he was able to engage in his literary and translation activity with new vigour. In 1698, John made a pilgrimage to Mount Athos, which became the source for what is perhaps his most famous work, the Pilgrim's Guidebook to the Holy Mount Athos (Œ†œÅŒøœÉŒ∫œÖŒΩŒ∑œÑŒ¨œÅŒπŒøŒΩ œÑŒø·ø¶ ·ºâŒ≥ŒØŒøœÖ ·ΩåœÅŒøœÖœÇ œÑŒø·ø¶ ·ºäŒ∏œâŒΩŒøœÇ), published at his own expense at the printing press of the Snagov monastery in 1701. He also participated in four other works published at Snagov, by providing epigraphs honouring the authors and/or Br√¢ncoveanu, who funded them: a single-volume edition, published in February 1699, of Peter Mogila's Confession of Faith and Bessarion Makris' On the Three Greatest Virtues; a Greek‚ÄìArabic edition of the Three Divine Liturgies (St. James, St. Basil, St. John Chrysostom), published in January 1701; an Almanac by Kyminitis, published in June 1701; and a Greek‚ÄìArabic Horologion, published in 1702. For the latter, John's previous epigraph from the Three Divine Liturgies was simply reprinted, and it was reprinted again for the 1703 Commentary and Liturgy on the Dedication of a Church, published at Bucharest by Anthimos the Iberite with funding by Br√¢ncoveanu. Apart from contributing epigraphs, John also wrote a number of original works, in line with the humanist and scholarly endeavours pursued at the Wallachian court under the patronage of Br√¢ncoveanu and Cantacuzino. In 1699, he wrote a biography of the Byzantine emperor John VI Kantakouzenos (), dedicated to Constantin Cantacuzino, whose family claimed descent from the emperor. The account is heavily fictionalized and idealized, meant to represent an ideal Christian, scholarly, and politically sage ruler rather than the historical figure, and flatter Cantacuzino as the ostensible heir and successor to his illustrious forebear. In December 1699, he composed the Prognostic Book on the Eclipse of the Sun that occurred in the Year 1699, September 13. This led some modern scholars to suggest that he was active in teaching mathematics and physics at the Princely Academy, but despite his evident interest in these subjects, this is nowhere corroborated. He also encouraged Cantacuzino and collaborated with him on the latter's map of Wallachia (1700), a work of remarkable accuracy on the political, historical, and economical geography of the country. In 1702, at Br√¢ncoveanu's suggestion, John translated into modern Greek Theophylact of Ohrid's commentary on the Four Gospels, but this work was never published due to the contrary advice of Patriarch Callinicus II of Constantinople, according to whom it was useless for the educated, and too complicated for the ordinary people. In 1702, John lost his erstwhile teacher and close friend, Kyminitis, who died and was buried at Bucharest on 6 September. John composed a funerary epigraph for him, which was inscribed on his tombstone. John also had a major contribution in Kyminitis' final work, Doctrinal Instruction, published posthumously in 1703, through his translations from Latin. Ecclesiastical career The Wallachian court records show that in autumn 1702, John resigned as court physician, to be replaced by the Italian Bartolomeo Ferrati. Despite his successful scholarly career, and for reasons that are unknown, John decided to enter the clergy. The details or time of his tonsure are unknown, but in September 1703 he is already recorded as a monk, in which capacity he participated in the boyar assembly convened at Arnavutk√∂y to elect the successor of Constantine Ducas. In the assembly, he staunchly supported Br√¢ncoveanu's candidate, Mihai Racovi»õƒÉ; Br√¢ncoveanu's rival, Dimitrie Cantemir, credits John's speech with influencing many of the boyars towards Racovi»õƒÉ, who was finally elected as ruler of Moldavia. Titular bishop of Side and abbot of the Kamariotissa monastery Following his departure from the Wallachian court, John probably headed for Constantinople, where he was tonsured as a monk, assuming the monastic name \\"Hierotheos\\" (·ºπŒµœÅœåŒ∏ŒµŒøœÇ). He enjoyed a rapid ascent, being promoted to presbyter and then titular bishop of Side by 1704. From this it appears that John, as an eminent scholar and someone interested in theological matters, had maintained contacts with patriarchal circles, and had perhaps received some offer from the Patriarchate that induced him to abandon his career at the Wallachian court. John was probably tonsured at the monastery of Theotokos Kamariotissa on the island of Chalke (modern Heybeliada), whose abbot he became following the death of the previous incumbent, Athanasios Malatestas, in January 1704. His residence at the monastery was at least in part for reasons of survival: as a titular bishop, he had no real source of income. He remained abbot at Kamariotissa until 1706, and was engaged in the renovation of the monastery and particularly the enrichment of its library. This period of his life is poorly documented; certainly his new duties at the monastery, but also at the patriarchal administration, forced him to suspend his literary and translation activity. In July 1705, at John's instigation, Br√¢ncoveanu funded the construction of a well in Constantinople. In March 1706, he participated at a synod in the Patriarchate that confirmed the election of a new metropolitan bishop for Trebizond, but he was already preparing his resignation as abbot of Kamariotissa: on 13 September of the same year, he ordered a formal inventory of all items in the monastery's sacristy, and delivered it to his eventual successor, the sacristan Neophytos. It is known that he left again for Wallachia, but the reason, or the duration of his stay there, are unknown; indeed he is next mentioned only in a synod at the Patriarchate in December 1709. Metropolitan of Dristra After December 1709, the sources are silent on John's activities until a letter sent to him by Nicholas Mavrocordatos on 27 October 1711. In this letter, he is mentioned in a new position, as metropolitan bishop of Dristra. The last reference to his predecessor Athanasios is from August 1710, meaning that John was promoted to the see of Dristra sometime after that. The vicinity of Dristra to Wallachia, and John's own relations with Wallachia, was certainly a factor in his appointment there. His career as Metropolitan of Dristra is well documented, both from Church documents as well as due to the survival of a large part of John's correspondence. The main challenge he faced during his tenure was financial: due to the poverty of the local Christian population, his own reluctance to enforce payment, and the need to cover the extortionate bribes of various Ottoman officials, John often not only found himself unable to pay the required sums to the Patriarchate and the Porte, but often he lacked money even for his private necessities. His correspondence during these years largely concerns pleas for assistance or intercession by his numerous acquaintances and patrons in high office. John was also an active participant in the patriarchal synod in Constantinople. He played a particularly important role in the Orthodox dialogue with the English non-jurors. On the other hand, his editorial activity declined, mostly due to the political turmoil engulfing the Danubian Principalities at the time. Only during the tenures of his friend Nicholas Mavrocordatos, who provided him with financial assistance, was he able to resume some of his previous publishing activity. In 1719, following the restoration of Mavrocordatos to the throne of Wallachia, John returned to Bucharest, where he translated the 15th-century treatise The Imitation of Christ into Greek. An encomiastic introduction to Mavrocordatos' Liber de Officiis, which was published in December 1719, is the last known work by John, who died sometime during that year. He was probably buried in Bucharest, but the exact site remains a mystery.

In Winter 2019, she was writer-in-residence (visiting scholar) at the Schusterman Center for Israel Studies at Brandeis University. She is the first writer to stay in the Gr√∂ndalshause Literature City Residence in Reykjavik UNESCO City of Literature (October 2019). Her research and creative writing stands at the intersection of literature and visual arts, Jewish studies and Women's Studies. Focusing on the preservation and transmission of the collective memory and the Jewish heritage worldwide, Ringuet acts as a \\"cultural translator\\" of the diverse forms of Jewish civilization and identity. She has contributed to many art exhibition catalogues and translated literary works focusing on the cultural hybridity pervading contemporary artistic practices, and on the intergenerational transmission of trauma in the aftermath of the Second World War and the Holocaust. Her work is deeply inspired by psychoanalysis and the freudian heritage of Mitteleuropa. She translates from Yiddish and English to French. Her first poetry book, Le sang des ruines (√âcrits des Hautes-terres, Gatineau, 2010), which focuses on two narrative voices of Holocaust survivors, was awarded the prix litt√©raire Jacques-Poirier in 2009. Her second collection of poetry, Under the Skin of War (BuschekBooks, Ottawa, 2014), which is written both in French and English, was inspired by the British photojournalist Don McCullin. Ringuet is also the author of √Ä la d√©couverte du Montr√©al yiddish (√âditions Fides, 2011) and she edited the first anthology of Canadian Yiddish literature in French translation, Voix yiddish de Montr√©al (Moebius, no 139, Montreal, 2013). With G√©rard Rabinovitch, she has published Les r√©volutions de Leonard Cohen (PUQ, 2016), which received a 2017 Canadian Jewish Literary Award. With Pierre Anctil, she has published a translation of the early biography of Marc Chagall (Mon univers. Autobiographie, Fides, 2017), launched for the opening of the international exhibition Chagall : Colour and Music at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, the biggest Canadian exhibition ever devoted to Marc Chagall. According to Simone Grossman, professor at the Department of French language and culture at Bar-Ilan University, her poetry illustrates the power of \\"affiliative postmemory\\" (Marianne Hirsch) through the relation between image and text. She has participated in many cultural and academic events, including at Harvard University, Yale University, the √âcole des hautes √©tudes en sciences sociales (EHESS) and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem; and was guest lecturer at the University of London, the Universit√© Sorbonne Nouvelle- Paris 3, the Toronto Jewish Literary Festival, KlezKanada, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, the Blue Metropolis and the Massachusetts Poetry Festival.

They are particularly useful in the study of inverse problems on function spaces for which a Gaussian Bayesian prior is an inappropriate model. The construction of a Besov measure is similar to the construction of a Besov space, hence the nomenclature.  Definitions  Let H be a separable Hilbert space of functions defined on a domain D \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{R}^{d}, and let \\\\\\\\{ e_{n} \\\\mid n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N} \\\\\\\\} be a complete orthonormal basis for H. Let s \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} and 1 \\\\leq p < \\\\infty. For u = \\\\sum_{n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}} u_{n} e_{n} \\\\in H, define :\\\\ u \\\\_{X^{s, p}} = \\\\left\\\\ \\\\sum_{n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}} u_{n} e_{n} \\\\right\\\\_{X^{s,p}} := \\\\left( \\\\sum_{n = 1}^{\\\\infty} n^{( \\\\frac{p s}{d} + \\\\frac{p}{2} - 1)}  u_{n} ^{p} \\\\right)^{1/p}. This defines a norm on the subspace of H for which it is finite, and we let X^{s, p} denote the completion of this subspace with respect to this new norm. The motivation for these definitions arises from the fact that \\\\ u \\\\_{X^{s, p}} is equivalent to the norm of u in the Besov space B_{p p}^{s}(D). Let \\\\kappa > 0 be a scale parameter, similar to the precision (the reciprocal of the variance) of a Gaussian measure. We now define a X^{s, p}-valued random variable u by :u := \\\\sum_{n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}} n^{-(\\\\frac{s}{d} + \\\\frac{1}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{p})} \\\\kappa^{- \\\\frac{1}{p}} \\\\xi_{n} e_{n}, where \\\\xi_{1}, \\\\xi_{2}, \\\\dots are sampled independently and identically from the generalized Gaussian measure on \\\\mathbb{R} with Lebesgue probability density function proportional to \\\\exp ( - \\\\tfrac{1}{2}  \\\\xi_{n} ^{p} ). Informally, u can be said to have a probability density function proportional to \\\\exp (- \\\\tfrac{\\\\kappa}{2} \\\\ u \\\\_{X^{s, p}}^{p} ) with respect to infinite-dimensional Lebesgue measure (which does not make rigorous sense), and is therefore a natural candidate for a \\"typical\\" element of X^{s, p} (although this Is not quite true -- see below). Properties It is easy to show that, when t ‚â§ s, the Xt,p norm is finite whenever the Xs,p norm is. Therefore, the spaces Xs,p and Xt,p are nested: :X^{s, p} \\\\subseteq X^{t, p} \\\\mbox{ when } t \\\\leq s. This is consistent with the usual nesting of smoothness classes of functions f: D -> R: for example, the Sobolev space H2(D) is a subspace of H1(D) and in turn of the Lebesgue space L2(D) = H0(D); the H√∂lder space C1(D) of continuously differentiable functions is a subspace of the space C0(D) of continuous functions. It can be shown that the series defining u converges in Xt,p almost surely for any t < s ‚àí d / p, and therefore gives a well-defined Xt,p-valued random variable. Note that Xt,p is a larger space than Xs,p, and in fact thee random variable u is almost surely not in the smaller space Xs,p. The space Xs,p is rather the Cameron-Martin space of this probability measure in the Gaussian case p = 2\\\\. The random variable u is said to be Besov distributed with parameters (Œ∫, s, p), and the induced probability measure is called a Besov measure.

William Harwood (March 14, 1948, Richmond, Virginia - April 26, 1984, Little Rock, Arkansas) was an American conductor. Chiefly remembered for his work as an opera conductor, he notably conducted the Houston Grand Opera's groundbreaking 1977 national tour of George Gershwin's Porgy and Bess. He also conducted the world premieres of operas by Claude Debussy, Frederick Delius, Stephen Paulus, and George Rochberg. Life and career A graduate of Yale University and the Berlin University of the Arts, Harwood began his career as the music director of the Yale Symphony Orchestra at the Yale School of Music from 1974‚Äì1977. There he also led performances of Mozart's Idomeneo, Piccinni's La buona figliuola, and the world premiere of Debussy's opera La Chute de la Maison Usher (based on Poe's The Fall of the House of Usher). He then served as director of the Houston Grand Opera's touring arm, the Texas Opera Theater, for two years; while simultaneously working as the associate conductor of the Houston Symphony. He notably led the HGO's groundbreaking 1977 production of Gershwin's Porgy and Bess. He later conducted performances of that opera at Radio City Music Hall in 1982. In 1979 Harwood conducted the world premiere of Stephen Paulus' A Village Singer at the Opera Theatre of Saint Louis (OTSL). In 1981 he made his New York City conducting debut leading a concert by the American Symphony Orchestra, and that same year won the Leopold Stokowski Memorial Conducting Award. In June 1982 he led the world premiere of another opera by Paulus at the OTSL, The Postman Always Rings Twice; a work which he also conducted at the 1983 Edinburgh Festival. In August 1982 he conducted the world premiere of George Rochberg's Confidence Man at the Santa Fe Opera. In June 1983 he conducted the world premiere of Frederick Delius's Margot la Rouge at the OTSL. Harwood died of viral pneumonia at the age of 36 in Little Rock, Arkansas.

He was nominated for the Medal of Honor for committing acts of conspicuous gallantry at the Battle of Missionary Ridge. Antebellum years King was born in Fabius Township, Michigan. He was the sixth of eight children of Benjamin Montaigne and Martha (Wetherbee) King. Martha King died in 1846, and Benjamin remarried to Eliza Van Buren, a cousin of U.S. president Martin Van Buren and descendant of John Jay.Three of James King's siblings did not survive infancy. Faust, Conspicuous Gallantry, 8-9; Portrait and Biographical Album, 266; Silliman, St. Joseph in Homespun, 129-30. King grew up working on his father's farm. In late 1860, he fell in love with Sarah Jane Babcock, a fellow student at the local district school. She was a daughter of Darius Ambrose and Ruth (Butler) Babcock, both of whom had ancestors in the Connecticut House of Representatives during the Revolution. King and Babcock‚Äôs young romance was interrupted when the Civil War broke out and King enlisted in the 11th Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment, mustering in on August 24, 1861.Faust, Conspicuous Gallantry, 9. Civil War service King was frequently detailed to clerk and quartermaster duties, culminating in his March 1863 promotion to quartermaster sergeant, a rank that nominally precluded involvement in combat. King, however, requested and was granted permission by his brigade commander to join in battle outside his line of duty at Missionary Ridge on November 25, 1863. There, King twice charged ahead of his unit against fortified Confederate positions, entering hand-to-hand combat on the first occasion, and penetrating a gap in Alexander P. Stewart's division on the ridge summit in the second case. King was among the first to crest the ridge, and the piercing of the Confederate battle line triggered Stewart‚Äôs retreat from the heights. King was wounded in the process, suffering a gunshot wound to his right arm that inflicted a lifelong disability and nearly necessitated amputation.Faust, Conspicuous Gallantry, 83, 116-20, 207-12; Belknap, Michigan Organizations, 120-22; Robertson, Michigan in the War, 319; Portrait and Biographical Album, 267; Durant, History of Ingham, 160; Three Rivers, 27. After voyaging to Michigan on medical furlough, King returned to his unit despite efforts to have him transferred to the Veteran Reserve Corps due to disability. When the regiment's colonel, William L. Stoughton, suffered amputation at the Battle of Ruff's Station on July 4, 1864, he asked for King to care for him during his recovery. King later returned to the fighting near Atlanta and was wounded again on July 30, 1864, when a chance shot from a distant Confederate cannon exploded over his head and severely injured his left shoulder. That wound, which would be blamed for his death decades later, effectively spelled the end of his military career.Faust, Conspicuous Gallantry, 120-21, 126-27, 140, 145-46, 193, 203; Portrait and Biographical Album, 267. Reconstruction Era Physically unable to resume farming, King departed for Tennessee to work as a clerk in the Chattanooga quartermaster office of Ezra Benham Kirk in 1865, travelling back to Michigan briefly in October to marry Sarah Jane Babcock. In the following year, King partnered with the 11th Michigan‚Äôs former adjutant, Linus Truman Squire, to lease and run the cotton plantation of Jacob Critz Jr. in Thompson's Station, Tennessee. Crop failure brought financial disappointment, and led King to try his luck again at a plantation just south of Decatur, Alabama, in 1867. There, King ran afoul of the Ku Klux Klan and retreated back to Michigan at the end of the year to ensure the safety of his wife and toddler daughter Jennie May King.Portrait and Biographical Album, 267; Faust, Conspicuous Gallantry, 148, 150-53, 180-83. Career After returning north, King worked as a clerk in the office of Michigan‚Äôs auditor general, William Humphrey, before leveraging his growing talent in phonography (a form of shorthand), to land a position as city editor of the Lansing Republican newspaper in 1871. King rose to the post of chief editor in 1881 and in the process became deeply involved in both state and federal politics. His stances on political issues were firmly, and at times radically, Republican, most notably in his championing of full racial equality. He retired from journalism in 1886 upon a change in the Republican‚Äôs ownership and returned to Fabius to care for his ageing parents. Reoccupying his childhood home, he secured employment as stenographer of the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit. King was elected president of the Law Stenographer‚Äôs Association of Michigan in 1898, and won reelection each year until his death.Portrait and Biographical Album, 267; Lansing and Its Yesterdays, 32; Faust, Conspicuous Gallantry, 184-95. Medal of Honor nomination In 1901 King was nominated by Senator Julius C. Burrows for the Medal of Honor for his actions at the Battle of Missionary Ridge. After significant delays in processing, this nomination was retroactively invalidated by a War Department circular of April 1903 that required nominees to be in current, active military service. This circular was overridden by an act of Congress the following year, but King did not live long enough to resume his efforts to obtain the medal.Faust, Conspicuous Gallantry, 197-203. Family The Kings had five children who survived to adulthood: Jennie May King (1867-1914), Herbert Holbrook King (1869-1950), James Guy King (1870-1919), John Willard King (1872-1931), and Henry Burr King (1876-after 1950). A sixth child, Eva Fay (1891-1894), died of Scarlet fever.Faust, Conspicuous Gallantry, 192, 214. Death King died on October 9, 1903, four days before the War Department mailed out a letter announcing the rejection of his medal nomination. Testimony submitted for his wife's widow‚Äôs pension blamed his death on heart troubles that originated with his wounding at Atlanta almost forty years prior. King is buried in Riverside Cemetery in Three Rivers, Michigan.Faust, Conspicuous Gallantry, 193, 203.

The cemetery and its heritage-listed Mortuary Chapel have importance to the local community as the principal place of public burial in Maryborough for over 120 years.  Description  The cemetery is laid out on a simple grid plan with a series of intersecting lanes and walkways separating the denominational sections. The lanes are lined with established trees and other trees and plantings are found within the burial sections. The cemetery contains representational examples of memorials from the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The mortuary chapel is a timber building comprises two intersecting barrel vaults, producing four identical round arched entrances at the ends of the vaults. Surmounting the point of intersection of the vaults is a tall fleche, in the form of a tower and dome, which doubles the full height of the building. Mortuary Chapel The Mortuary Chapel is a heritage-listed chapel at the cemetery. It was designed by Willoughby Powell and built from 1883 to 1884 by Clement and Sons. It is also known as Cemetery Kiosk and Cemetery Shelter. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992. The Mortuary Chapel is prominently sited within the Maryborough Cemetery at the intersection of two principle axes. The Cemetery is laid out on a simple grid plan with a series of intersecting lanes and walkways separating the denominational sections. The lanes are lined with established trees and other trees and plantings are found within the burial sections. The cemetery contains representational examples of memorials from the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The timber building comprises two intersecting barrel vaults, producing four identical round arched entrances at the ends of the vaults. Surmounting the point of intersection of the vaults is a tall fleche, in the form of a tower and dome, which doubles the full height of the building. The vaulted sections of the building are constructed with timber framed walls clad externally with horizontal chamfered timber boards and internally with diagonally laid tongue- and-groove boarding. The curved roofs of the vaults are formed with corrugated iron. The entrances, through the vaulted ends of these sections, have a wide carved timber fascia boards which rest visually on timber piers flanking the entrances. Internally the ceiling space is lined with regularly spaced timber trusses in the vaulted sections, and lined with timber boarding over the intersection. The timber fleche is supported on heavy timber beams with brackets, found inside the chapel at the four corners of the central internal space under the fleche. The fleche has a rocket like quality, as it tapers from an octagonal base to a more narrow octagonal drum surmounted by an octagonal domed roof, clad with painted sheet metal, possibly zinc. On each face of the octagonal base and drum are round arched openings infilled with small fixed timber louvres. Other narrow round arched openings, like lancets, on the face of the buildings are also infilled with similar louvres.  History  The original township of Maryborough was situated, not in its current place, but on the north of the Mary River, after wharves were established in 1847-8 providing transport for wool from sheep stations on the Burnett River. In 1850 Surveyor, Hugh Roland Labatt, arrived in Maryborough with instructions to \\"examine the River Mary...to suggest ...the best site or sites for the laying out of the town, having regard to the convenience of shipping on one hand and internal communication on the other...also...point out the spots desirable as reserves for public building, church, quay and for places for public recreation.\\" The site recommended by Labatt was not where settlement was established but further east and from the early 1850s this is where the growing town developed. The Maryborough Cemetery was established in the mid 1870s, and was the third cemetery site in the town. As Maryborough grew previous cemetery sites became inappropriately close to the centre of town. The site of the first cemetery is unknown and the second site was in Kent Street and was registered in October 1871. Development surrounded this second site and by 1873 it was closed and the third cemetery site was established. In the early twentieth century families were given the option of having headstones removed from the second cemetery site to this third site. Like most nineteenth century cemeteries, the Maryborough Cemetery was designed on a grid plan with burial areas used by various religious denominations separated by lanes and walkways. At the intersection of two principal tree- lined lanes, a mortuary chapel was placed to provide shelter for family and friends of the deceased attending grave side services. This unusual building was designed by Queensland architect Willoughby Powell and constructed by Bundaberg firm Clement and Sons at a cost of in 1883-4. Occasionally mortuary chapels were constructed for one denomination and placed in their section of the cemetery, but this centrally placed chapel served all denominations, the four entrances ensuring that each of the surrounding religious sections had equal access and ownership of the small chapel. The entrances are large to permit entry of a horse-drawn hearse. Its position at the intersection of the cemetery lanes and its height make it a landmark and its tower form has caused it to be locally known as \\"the rocket\\". Chapel The Mortuary Chapel at the Maryborough Cemetery was constructed in 1883-4, several years after the establishment of the cemetery, to shelter mourners attending graveside services. This unusual building was designed by Queensland architect Willoughby Powell. The architect, Willoughby Powell, was born in Cheltenham, England in about 1848 and was articled to the Cheltenham City Architect before emigrating to Queensland where he worked for Richard Gailey. He joined the Public Works Department as a draftsman in June 1874 but won a competition for the Toowoomba Grammar School and left his government position to supervise the construction works in 1875. He maintained a practice in Toowoomba until 1878 before returning to practice in Brisbane in 1879 and then to Maryborough in about 1882. During his time in Maryborough he designed many important buildings including Baddow House, the Royal Exchange Hotel, shops, the grandstand and stables at the Maryborough Turf Club, Tattersall's Hotel, Cafe Royal Hotel and a parsonage in Lennox Street. Powell again returned to practice in Brisbane and designed the Warwick Town Hall and the third Toowoomba Town Hall and was again appointed to the Works Department where he remained until 1902. Powell designed many fine buildings throughout Queensland and the Mortuary Chapel was one of the most unusual.  Heritage listing  Mortuary Chapel was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Mortuary Chapel at the Maryborough Cemetery by its size and quality demonstrates the growth of Maryborough in the late nineteenth century. The building provides evidence of nineteenth century burial practice, with mourners using burial sections segregated according to religious denomination able to access the building from each of its four sides. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The building is a rare example of a mortuary chapel with four entrances, in an unusual building form. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The mortuary chapel forms a strong focal point within the Maryborough Cemetery, combining this landmark quality with considerable visual appeal in the cemetery landscape The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The cemetery and chapel have importance to the local community as the principal place of public burial in Maryborough for over 120 years. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. It also has a strong association with the life and work of Queensland architect, Willoughby Powell.

History  Global Forest Watch originally began in 1997 as an initiative to establish a global forest monitoring network, convened by the World Resources Institute and partners. The initiative was rebooted in 2013 with data from the Center for Global Development derived from NASA's MODIS sensor, with additional layers subsequently added from Google/UMD, Imazon, Terra-i, and NASA. The second iteration of GFW was released in February 2014, and continues to add information at multiple time scales and spatial resolutions to track deforestation. The GFW Commodities and GFW Fires sub-pages were subsequently released.  Use cases  The GFW platform has been used in a number of notable applications. The forest change data have been used to measure global deforestation rates and to detect and monitor illegal clearing activity, primarily in Indonesia. The NASA Active Fires data, displayed within GFW Fires, have been used to identify illegal burning that has caused the 2015 Southeast Asian haze crisis (see Haze crisis).

Introduced in 1966 it was one of the first potato varieties bred to be resistant to a form of potato cyst nematode, a major pest of potato production in the UK. It has been the most widely grown variety in the UK since 1980 and is suitable for a range of uses including chips, roast potatoes and mashed potatoes. Breeding The Maris Building in Trumpington where Maris Piper was developed The leaves of Maris Piper A side view of a crop of Maris Piper in flower Attempts to find resistance to the potato cyst nematode Globodera rostochiensis in wild potatoes began in 1941 when Conrad Ellenby started testing over 60 species held in the Commonwealth Potato Collection, finding that few were resistant or suitable to breed with cultivated potatoes. In a letter to Nature in 1952 Ellenby reported that by 1948 he had found four types that were resistant and could be crossed with contemporary varieties. All four were the species Solanum tuberosum andigena and one of these, CPC 1673 was the source of nematode resistance in Maris Piper. Although resistant to PCN, the wild potato produced very small tubers in the UK climate. Led by H. W. Howard., workers at the Plant Breeding Institute in Cambridge crossed the wild potato with contemporary varieties to produce a high-yielding, resistant variety. CPC 1673 was backcrossed, crossed with Ulster Knight and then crossed with a cross of Arran Cairn and Herald. Arran Cairn was bred by Donald Mackelvie, the leading Scottish potato breeder in the early 20th century and Ulster Knight was bred by John Clarke, an eminent potato breeder from Antrim. The final cross was made in 1956, but it took another ten years for the variety to be tested and multiplied before it was recommended by the National Institute of Agricultural Botany in 1966. The PBI and Howard were awarded the Queen's Award for Technology in 1982 for breeding Maris Piper. The first part of the variety's name came from Maris Lane in Trumpington where the Plant Breeding Institute was located. By convention, the breeder got to choose the second name, with Piper chosen arbitrarily by Howard's son, although earlier had proposed calling it Maris Pard. Usage The variety was the most popular in the UK by 1980, accounting for 24 % of the British potato crop in 1982, 20 % in 2005 and 16 % in 2014. It became popular both due being resistant to nematodes and its taste being popular with consumers. Maris Piper has a fluffy texture and is considered an \\"all-rounder\\" potato. It is widely used to make chips (French fries) due to it having high dry matter and low reducing sugars. As well as being sold fresh, the variety is also suitable for processing into frozen or dehydrated products. It has been recommended by chefs Heston Blumenthal and Tom Kerridge for making triple cooked chips. In his book Perfection Blumenthal stated they were \\"in a league of their own\\" for making roast potatoes and he also considers them the best variety for mashed potatoes. Traits Maris Piper is one of the most susceptible potato varieties to being eaten by slugs and also the bacterial disease common scab, that causes corky lesions to form on the skin. Common scab is controlled by irrigating crops just as the potatoes begin to form requiring \\"perfect timing and perfect irrigation\\". Maris Piper was one of the first varieties with resistance to G. rostochiensis with the H1 gene giving complete resistance to UK strains. The widespread growth of Maris Piper led to the closely related G. pallida (to which Maris Piper has no resistance) becoming the main potato cyst nematode in the UK. When nematodes feed on the roots, the H1 gene results in the potato roots dying, preventing the nematodes from feeding and making it likely they die or turn into males. H1 is thought to encode a protein that specifically detects the product of one nematode gene during feeding, a so-called gene-for-gene relationship.

The efficiency of an Algorithm can be evaluated by the amount of computational resources it takes to compute output or the quantity of interest. In this page, two of the very efficient algorithms for multidimensional signals are explained. For the sake of simplicity and description it is explained for 2-D Signals. However, same theory holds good for M-D signals. The exact computational savings for each algorithm is also mentioned. Motivation and applications In the case of digital systems, a mathematical expressions can be used to describe the input- output relationship and an algorithm can be used to implement this relationship. Similarly, algorithms can be developed to implement different transforms such as Digital filter, Fourier transform, Histogram, Image Enhancements, etc. Direct implementation Fast Algorithms for Signal Processing by Richard E. Blahut, Cambridge University Press 2010 of these input-output relationships and transforms is not necessarily the most efficient way to implement those. When people began to compute such outputs from input through direct implementation, they began to look for more efficient ways. This wiki page aims at showcasing such efficient and fast algorithms for multidimensional signals and systems. A multidimensional (M-D) signal can be modeled as a function of M independent variables, where M is greater than or equal to 2. These signals may be categorized as continuous, discrete, or mixed. A continuous signal can be modeled as a function of independent variables which range over a continuum of values, example ‚Äì an audio wave travelling in space, 3-D space waves measured at different times. A discrete signal, on the other hand, can be modeled as a function defined only on a set of points, such as the set of integers. An image is the simplest example of a 2-D discrete domain signal that is spatial in nature. In the context of Fast Algorithms, consider the example below: We need to compute A which is given by A = Œ±Œ≥ + Œ±Œ¥ + Œ≤Œ≥ + Œ≤Œ¥ where Œ±,Œ≤,Œ≥ and Œ¥ are complex variables. To compute A, we need 4 complex multiplications and 3 complex additions. The above equation can be written in its simplified form as A = (Œ± + Œ≤)(Œ≥ + Œ¥) This form requires only 1 complex multiplication and 2 complex additions. Thus the second way of computing A is much more efficient and fast compared to the first method of computing A. This is the motivation for the evolution of the fast algorithms in the digital signal processing Field. Consequently, many of the real-world applications make use of these efficient Algorithms for fast computations. Problem Statement and Basics The simplest form of representing a Linear Shift Invariant system(LSI) is through its Impulse response. The output of such LSI discrete domain system is given by the convolution of its input signal and system‚Äôs impulse response. This is mathematically represented as follows: y\\\\left(n_1,n_2\\\\right)=\\\\sum_{l_1=-\\\\infty}^{+\\\\infty}\\\\sum_{l_2=\\\\infty}^{+\\\\infty} x(l_1,l_2) h(n_1-l_1,n_2-l_2) where h(n_1,n_2) is the impulse response of the system. Figure 1: Block Diagram representation of 2-D System with impulse response h(n1,n2) According to the equation above to obtain the Output value at a particular point ( say y(0,0)) we need to multiply several values of the input x(l_1,l_2) and Impulse Response h(-l_1,-l_2). Of course this is dependent on the Region of Support of the input as well as the impulse response. The key point here to be noted is that we need to perform so many complex multiplications and additions to obtain 1 output value. Assuming a 2-D input signal is of length M \\\\times M and the system's impulse response is of length N \\\\times N we need to perform M^2N^2 number of multiplications to obtain all output values. The output can be computed efficiently if one can exploit some characteristics of the system. We encounter a similar scenario when we have to compute the discrete Fourier Transforms of a signal of interest. The Direct Calculation of the 2-D DFT is simply the evaluation of the double Sum Dan E. Dudgeon, Russell M. Mersereau, ‚ÄúMultidimensional Digital Signal Processing‚Äù, Prentice-Hall Signal Processing Series, , 1983. X\\\\left(k_1,k_2\\\\right)=\\\\sum_{n_1=0}^{N_1-1}\\\\sum_{n_2=0}^{N_2-1} x(n_1,n_2) W_{N_1}^{n_1k_1}W_{N_2}^{n_2k_2} \\\\text{ for } 0\\\\leq k_1\\\\leq N_1-1 \\\\text{ and } 0\\\\leq k_2\\\\leq N_2-1 \\\\text{ where } W_N \\\\equiv \\\\text{exp}\\\\left(-j\\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{N}\\\\right) The total number of complex multiplications and complex additions needed to evaluate this 2-D DFT by direct calculation is N_1^2N_2^2. This is a naive approach, however, we already know that an N-point 1-D DFT can be computed with far fewer than N^2 multiplications by using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. As described in the next section we can develop Fast Fourier transforms for calculating 2-D or higher dimensional DFTs as well  Fast Algorithms for Multidimensional signals = Row Column Decomposition approach for the evaluation of DFT  The DFT sum X\\\\left(k_1,k_2\\\\right) in the previous equation can also be written in the following form X\\\\left(k_1,k_2\\\\right)=\\\\sum_{n_1=0}^{N_1-1}\\\\left[\\\\sum_{n_2=0}^{N_2-1} x(n_1,n_2) W_{N_2}^{n_2k_2}\\\\right]W_{N_1}^{n_1k_1} Let G\\\\left(n_1,k_2\\\\right) denote the quantity inside the brackets and is given by: G\\\\left(n_1,k_2\\\\right)=\\\\sum_{n_2=0}^{N_2-1} x(n_1,n_2) W_{N_2}^{n_2k_2} X\\\\left(k_1,k_2\\\\right)=\\\\sum_{n_1=0}^{N_1-1}G\\\\left(n_1,k_2\\\\right) W_{N_1}^{n_1k_2} Employing this method the DFT X can be computed as multiple 1-D DFTs. That is, each column of G can be considered as a 1-D DFT of the corresponding column of x (n_1 = constant). And each row of X is the 1-DFT of the corresponding row of the G (n_2 = constant). Hence we are computing the 2-D DFT by decomposing it into Row and Column DFTs. The same principle is employed for evaluating the M-D DFT of a M - dimensional signal. Now let's talk about the computational savings we get using this approach. It is observed that we require N_1N_2 (N_1 + N_2) complex additions and multiplications. Further, if each of these 1-D DFT is computed using a 1-D FFT, the number of complex multiplications can be further reduced to N_1N_2\\\\frac{\\\\log_2 N_1N_2}{2}  Vector Radix Fast Fourier Transform  Just like the 1-D FFT, decimation in time can be achieved in the case of 2-D Signals. The 1-D DFT of a signal whose length is a power of 2, can be expressed in terms of two half-length DFTs, each of these can again be expressed as a combination of quarter length DFTs and so on. In the case of 2-D signals we can express the (N_1 \\\\text{ x } N_2) DFT in terms of four \\\\frac{N_1}{2} \\\\text{ x }\\\\frac{N_2}{2} DFTs (assuming N_1 and N_2 are powers of 2). For the sake of simplicity let us assume that N_1 = N_2 = N. The DFT double sum can be decomposed into four separate summations, one over those samples of x for which both n_1 and n_2 are even, one for which n_1 is even and n_2 is odd, one for which n_1 is odd and n_2 is even and the last one for which n_1 and n_2 are odd. This is written as : X\\\\left(k_1,k_2\\\\right)=S_{00}(k_1,k_2)+S_{01}(k_1,k_2)W_{N}^{k_2}+S_{10}(k_1,k_2)W_{N}^{k_1}+S_{11}(k_1,k_2)W_{N}^{k_1+k_2} where S_{00}(k_1,k_2) \\\\equiv \\\\sum_{m_1=0}^{N/2-1}\\\\sum_{m_2=0}^{N/2-1} x(2m_1,2m_2) W_{N}^{2m_1k_1+2m_2k_2} S_{01}(k_1,k_2) \\\\equiv \\\\sum_{m_1=0}^{N/2-1}\\\\sum_{m_2=0}^{N/2-1} x(2m_1,2m_2+1) W_{N}^{2m_1k_1+2m_2k_2} S_{10}(k_1,k_2) \\\\equiv \\\\sum_{m_1=0}^{N/2-1}\\\\sum_{m_2=0}^{N/2-1} x(2m_1+1,2m_2) W_{N}^{2m_1k_1+2m_2k_2} S_{11}(k_1,k_2) \\\\equiv \\\\sum_{m_1=0}^{N/2-1}\\\\sum_{m_2=0}^{N/2-1} x(2m_1+1,2m_2+1) W_{N}^{2m_1k_1+2m_2k_2} All the arrays S_{00} S_{01} S_{10} and S_{11} are each periodic in (k_1,k_2) with horizontal and vertical periods \\\\frac{N}{2}.

S_{00}(k_1,k_2) can be obtained by evaluating a \\\\left(\\\\frac{N}{2} \\\\times \\\\frac{N}{2} \\\\right) -point DFT (similarly other S_{ij} can be obtained). Thus we see that the N \\\\times N DFT can be expressed in terms of four \\\\frac{N}{2} \\\\times \\\\frac{N}{2} DFTs. By analogy from the 1-D case, the computation depicted in the below figure is called a \\\\text{butterfly} or more precisely radix - (2 \\\\times 2)\\\\text{ butterfly} . File:Modified Updated Butterfly Image.png Each butterfly requires three complex multiplications and eight complex additions for the calculation of outputs from the inputs.

In 2015, Nakhova became the first female artist to represent Russia in its pavilion at the Venice Biennial. She is represented by Nailya Alexander Gallery in New York City. Nakhova currently lives and works in Moscow and New Jersey. She works with different mediums like fine art, photography, sounds, sensors and inflatable materials. She is a Laureate of the Kandinsky 2013 Award. Career Nakhova graduated from the Graphic Design Department of the Moscow Polygraphic Institute in 1978. She was a member of the Union of Artists of the USSR from 1986 to 1989 and, alongside her friends and colleagues Ilya Kabakov, George Kisevalter, Vladimir Sorokin, Dmitrii Prigov, and Andrei Monastyrsky, is considered one of the founding members of Moscow Conceptualism. Nakhova received international recognition as a young artist for Rooms (1983‚Äì1987), the first \\"total installation\\" in Russian art, located in the Moscow apartment where she still lives today. In 1988, Nakhova was one of the youngest artists included in Sotheby's first auction in Moscow. The \\"groundbreaking\\" auction, titled \\"Avant-Garde and Soviet Art\\", realized more than $3,000,000 USD and marked a major step forward in the opening of Russian art to Western European and American markets. Nakhova's work caught the attention of American gallerist Phyllis Kind, who gave the artist three solo shows in New York in the early 1990s, Nakhova's first exhibitions in the United States. From 1994 to 1997 she was a professor in a university in Detroit in the US. In 2011, Nakhova was featured as a special guest of the Fourth Moscow Biennale of Contemporary Art at the Moscow Museum of Modern Art. As part of a large-scale retrospective of Nakhova's work, her seminal installation Room No. 2 (1983‚Äì1987) was a result of her frustration from the oppressive Soviet regime, located in her Moscow apartment where she lives today.

The result: the Russian Pavilion takes on the appearance of a romantic gazebo, while concealing within itself the spatial metaphor of Kazimir Malevich's 'Black Square' (1915). Another installation presented in this pavilion was her project ‚Äûrooms‚Äú which were a complex of five different spaces between art, architecture and the viewers point of view. \\" Selected exhibitions Nakhova‚Äôs work has been shown in over thirty solo exhibitions and numerous major group exhibitions worldwide. Major exhibitions include Post Pop: East Meets West (Saatchi Gallery, London, 2014); Irina Nakhova and Pavel Pepperstein: Moscow Partisan Conceptualism (Orel Art UK, London, 2010); Moscow Installation (K√ºnstlerhaus, Kalrsruhe, Germany, 2006); Berlin‚ÄìMoscow / Moscow‚ÄìBerlin, 1950‚Äì2000 (Martin-Gropius-Bau, Berlin, and State Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow, 2003‚Äì04); Global Conceptualism: Points of Origin, 1950s‚Äì1980s (Queens Museum, New York, 1999); Laughter Ten Years After (which travelled to six museums and galleries in the United States and Canada, 1995); After Perestroika: Kitchenmaids or Stateswomen (Centre international d‚Äôart contemporain de Montr√©al, 1993); The Work of Art in the Age of Perestroika (Phyllis Kind Gallery, New York, 1990); and Iskunstvo: Moscow‚Äì Berlin (Bahnhof Westend, West Berlin, 1988).

Collections Nakhova's work is in public and private collections throughout France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States. In Russia, her work can be found at the Moscow Museum of Modern Art, the National Centre for Contemporary Arts, and The State Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow. Nakhova's work is part of the Norton and Nancy Dodge Collection of Soviet Nonconformist Art, one of the largest collections of Soviet-era art outside Russia, amassed by American economist Norton Dodge from the late 1950s until the advent of Perestroika in the 1980s. Dodge smuggled nearly 10,000 works of art from the USSR to the United States during the height of the Cold War, often at great personal risk, a story detailed at length in John McPhee's The Ransom of Russian Art (1994). The collection was donated to Rutgers University in the mid-1990s, where it is on permanent display at the University's Jane Voorhees Zimmerli Art Museum.

Peignot et Fils foundry (Fonderie G. Peignot et Fils) was a French typographic foundry, established in 1898 and closed down between 1919 and 1923 after a merger to become Deberny & Peignot foundry. Led by Georges Peignot (1872-1915), G. Peignot & Fils was a prestigious French typographic foundry, an \\"elite house\\", according to Louis Barthou, former French Prime Minister.  History  G. Peignot et Fils is founded in 1898 in Paris, after absorption of the Veuve Routier et Peignot foundry (established in 1867), itself heir of the foundry \\"Veuve Routier\\" (established in 1865) and foundry of Pierre Leclerc (established in 1842).  Foundry of Pierre Leclerc (1842)  In 1842, Pierre Leclerc, a craftsman, creates a fixed spaces foundry (hand-set metal type to achieve letter-spacing) in Paris. \\"He can be considered as the genuine creator of the fixed spaces industry\\", says the magazine La fonderie typographique in 1899. These fixed spaces between words and lines, margins, etc., require great precision. He invents a new process, instead of cutting fixed spaces, pouring them into molds, which increases accuracy. In 1856, after his death, the company management is entrusted to a friend of his widow, Cl√©mentine Dupont de Vieux Pont (wife Peignot, 1815-1897). She then settles beside her his son, Gustave Peignot (1839-1899), engineer of Arts et M√©tiers school.  Veuve Routier (1865) and Veuve Routier et G. Peignot (1867) foundries In 1865, the foundry of Pierre Leclerc is sold by auction to Peignot. The new company is called \\"Veuve Routier\\" (Widow Routier), which is the name of the lessor having made possible the purchase by Gustave Peignot. In 1867, Gustave Peignot and the lessor merge in a company which takes the name of \\"Veuve Routier et Peignot.\\" In 1869 the company moved to Boulevard de Montrouge (now boulevard Edgar-Quinet), at no. 66-68, where a building is constructed (upstairs for the family, ground for the plant). In 1875, the debt to the Veuve Routier is cleared, and Gustave Peignot becomes sole owner of the company and the building. Advertisement for G. Peignot foundry published in L'imprimerie magazine, in 1883 From 1875 to 1898, Gustave Peignot continues to make great profits with fixed spaces production, not amputated this time by refunds to the Veuve Routier. \\"In this lead will Thou find gold\\", used to say his mother. At this time, Gustave Peignot becomes first President of the Chambre syndicale des ma√Ætres fondeurs typographes (trade association of type foundry masters). He marries Marie Laporte, and is a father of 8 children.  G. Peignot et Fils Foundry (1898) In 1898, Gustave Peignot distributes to his children an equal parts of stocks and appoints Georges Peignot, his second son, as co-manager. The company's name changes for \\"G. Peignot & Fils\\" (G. Peignot & Sons). He dies in 1899. Georges Peignot continues the production of fixed spaces, causing significant growth in sales, and launches studies for new typefaces. The quality of fonts puts foundry G. Peignot et Fils at the forefront. In 12 years, Georges Peignot creates many typefaces: Grasset, Auriol, Cochin, Garamond-Peignot, Bellery-Desfontaines, Naudin, Guy-Arnoux. He also publishes a Specimen, great typefaces catalog (still highly sought, 600 pages, 2 volumes). In 1904, to address growth of sales, G. Peignot et Fils built a new plant at the corner of Cabanis and Ferrus streets. In 1911-1912, Georges Peignot sends in South America his two young brothers, Lucien and R√©my, looking for distributors. The company is at its peak. But war brakes out in 1914. Volunteer for the front, Adjudant Georges Peignot is killed by a bullet to the forehead at the head of his section, Sept. 28, 1915, near Givenchy. His four brothers also die. The legacy of Georges Peignot is taken hostage by infighting: in 1919, his own mother, Marie Laporte-Peignot, requires its children or their widows the payment of a substantial sum (1 million of French francs, equivalent of USD [2015] 1,4 million) in the form of a capital increase to its competitor Deberny (founded by Balzac in 1826), owned by Charles Tuleu (heir of Alexandre de Berny and husband of Jane Peignot-Tuleu). In 1923, G. Peignot et Fils foundry disappears, victim of the merger between Deberny foundry (2.6 million, including the 1 million Peignot subsidy) and G. Peignot & Fils foundry (4.1 million). The new company's name relegates Peignot's name in background: the new entity is indeed called \\"Deberny et Peignot\\" and commonly called \\"Deberny\\". Against all logic (the manager is usually chosen by the majority shareholder), the manager of the small Deberny foundry, Robert Girard, under whom the old foundry Deberny had collapsed, takes the reins of the new entity. In 1922, the Commission de l‚Äôenseignement et des beaux-arts (governmental Commission for education and fine arts) suggests honoring the story of Peignot: it transports the awls of the foundry in the building of the Imprimerie nationale (Government printing office), near Gutenberg street in Paris. And it proposes that the continuation of this street would be baptized \\"rue des Quatre-Fr√®res-Peignot\\" (Four- brothers-Peignot street) in memory of Georges, Andr√©, Lucien and R√©my who died between September, 1914 and June, 1916, snatched by the World War I.

Peignot & Fils foundry is the heart of important typographic creations, including: * the Grasset (drawing with reed pen : Eug√®ne Grasset, 1898-1901) ; * the Fran√ßaise-l√©g√®re, the Fran√ßaise-allong√©e, the Auriol-labeur, the Auriol-champlev√©, and the Robur (drawing with brush : George Auriol, 1902-1907) ; * the Bellery-Desfontaines-large et le Bellery- Desfontaines-√©troit (drawing : Henri Bellery-Desfontaines, 1910-1912) ; * the Polyph√®me (bold) et le Cyclop√©en (light) (anonymous creation, 1910) ; * the Cochin book and italic, the Nicolas-Cochin book and italic, engraved by Charles Malin, the Moreau-le-Jeune, the Fournier-le-Jeune, the vignettes et ornaments Fournier (drawing : P.

The necessity for a such magazine came due to difficulties that the linguistic situation in Kosovo, North Macedonia, and other Albanian inhabited areas inside Yugoslavia. The Albanological Institute in Prishtina called a symposium to deal with the Albanian language issues raised so far, in December 1980. One of the outcomes of the symposium was the decision to create a magazine which would constantly visit the topics discussed. The magazine was named Gjuha Shqipe (The Albanian Language), similarly to the one which was recently coming out in Tirana, named Gjuha Jon√´ (Our Language), published back than by the Institute of Linguistics ad Literature (). Since then, it has given a major contribute in the enhancement of the Albanian language. The editorial staff has always solicited collaborators outside of former Yugoslavian republics, in Albania, in Arbereshe communities, and elsewhere, being a major characteristic of the magazine. Out of 278 contributors names, 108 are from Albania.

They are present in insects, mollusks, echinoderms and chordates. The mechanism of action of PGRPs varies between taxa. In insects, PGRPs kill bacteria indirectly by activating one of four unique effector pathways: prophenoloxidase cascade, activation of Toll pathway, activation of IMD pathway, and induction of phagocytosis. In mammals, PGRPs kill bacteria directly by interacting with their peptidoglycan cell wall. Structure PGRPs contain at least one C-terminal peptidoglycan recognition domain, which is about 165 amino acids long. This peptidoglycan-binding type 2 amidase domain is homologous to bacteriophage and bacterial type 2 amidases. Types Insects generate up to 19 alternatively spliced PGRPs, classified into long (L) and short (S) forms. For instance, the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) expresses 13 PGRPs which are alternatively spliced into 19 proteins, while the mosquito (Anopheles gambiae) expresses 7 PGRPs, with 9 splice variants. Mammals have up to four PGRPs, all of which are secreted. These are peptidoglycan recognition protein 1 (PGLYRP1), peptidoglycan recognition protein 2 (PGLYRP2), peptidoglycan recognition protein 3 (PGLYRP3) and peptidoglycan recognition protein 4 (PGLYRP4).

His work has been published in eight different languages. He was, in the second half of the 20th century, one of the key representatives in the field of comparative law. Biography Between 1929 and 1939 David was a professor at the University of Grenoble. During World War II he served in the French army. After the war, from 1945 to 1968, he was the chair of comparative law at the University of Paris. Subsequently, from 1968 to 1976 he was a professor at the University of Aix-en-Provence. He worked on several legal projects and assignments, as in 1930 for UNIDROIT (International Institute for the Unification of Private Law) in Rome. He lectured in various places in the world, including the University of Cambridge (1933‚Äì35), Columbia University, the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and the University of Tehran. In the sixties, he led the French delegation at the UNCITRAL (United Nations Commission on International Trade Law) and from 1962 to 1978 he was a board member of UNIDROIT. David was one of the writers of the Civil Code of Ethiopia in 1960 and a member of the team that wrote the civil law for Rwanda. He was also, in 1973, the head of the publication of the International Encyclopaedia of Comparative Law. Legal theory David, in Trait√© √©l√©mentaire de droit civile compar√©,Trait√© √©l√©mentaire de droit civile compar√©: Introduction √† l'√©tude des droits √©trangers et √† la m√©thode comparative - in French; Paris, 1950 proposed the classification of legal systems, according to the different ideology inspiring each one, into five groups or families: * Western Laws, a group subdivided into the: ** Romano-Germanic subgroup (comprising those legal systems where legal science was formulated according to Roman Law ‚Äì see also Civil law (legal system)) ** Anglo-Saxon subgroup (common law) * Soviet Law * Muslim Law (sharia) * Hindu Law * Chinese Law * Jewish Law (halakha) Especially with respect to the aggregating by David of the Romano-Germanic and Anglo-Saxon Laws into a single family, David argued that the antithesis between the Anglo- Saxon Laws and Romano-German Laws, is of a technical rather than of an ideological nature. Of a different kind is, for instance, the antithesis between (say) the Italian and the American Law, and of a different kind that between the Soviet, Muslim, Hindu, or Chinese Law. According to David, the Romano-Germanic legal systems included those countries where legal science was formulated according to Roman Law, whereas common law countries are those where law was created from the judges. The characteristics that he believed uniquely differentiate the Western legal family from the other four are: * liberal democracy * capitalist economy * Christian religion Awards David was awarded honorary degrees from the University of Edinburgh, Brussels, Ottawa, Basel, Leicester and Helsinki. On September 17, 1976, he was honored with Amnesty International, with the Erasmus Prize in the Pieterskerk in Leiden.

The game was released into Steam Early Access in January 2016 after being previewed as a WebGL game at PAX Australia 2015. Background Creator of Rivalry, Kew McParlane, in November 2015 at PAX Australia Rivalry was created by Kew McParlane and launched on 1 November 2015 at PAX Australia. Rivalry was a surprise hit of the show. Kew came up with the idea of the game when he was a 12 year old, leading him to build a prototype using Little Big Planet. He took the idea to his father, who encouraged Kew by teaching him how to program. He then ran a successful Kickstarter to raise $2000 to get himself an Indie Developer stand at PAX 2015 in Melbourne, Australia. Gameplay and reception In Rivalry, two players take turns at moving their ragdoll character‚Äôs limbs and weapons until one is victorious. While the beginning stages of each game captures the strategic essence of swordplay, as damage and limbs are taken, the endgame turns rather Pythonesque. Rivalry's Steam Greenlight campaign launched a few days before PAX Australia 2015, and received mostly negative comments due to the primitive graphics of the game. During and after PAX, Rivalry began to receive almost exclusively positive comments from people who had attended PAX and experienced the game first-hand. The game was green-lit by Steam on 16 December 2015. Rivalry was released under Steam Early Access on 22 January 2016. It gained some popularity amongst gamers when Kim Richards from The Yogscast published two playthrough videos on the 16th and 19th of March 2016. On 14 June 2016, Kew was interviewed by ABC TV's Good Game about Rivalry and his development experience.  Development  The game is currently in alpha development and many more features, including online multiplayer, are planned before the game's full release.

The daughter of Rush B. Lincoln, a major general in the US Army Air Forces, and Jeannette Bartholomew Lincoln, a chemistry professor, she was born in Ames, Iowa. She studied at Dana Hall in Wellesley, Massachusetts and went on to earn a bachelor's degree in physics from Wellesley College. She received a master's degree from Iowa State University in 1938. From 1935 to 1942, she was an instructor in household equipment at Iowa State. In 1942, she began work in the Interservice Radio Propagation Laboratory (later renamed the Central Radio Propagation Laboratory or CRPL) at the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) in Washington, D.C.; she transferred to the NBS in Boulder, Colorado when the CRPL was moved there in 1954. In 1959, she became Chief of Radio Warning Services. In the same year, she was the only woman in the US delegation to the International Geophysical Year meeting in Moscow. In 1966, she became director for the World Data Center for Solar-Terrestrial Physics. She later became the Solar-Terrestrial Physics division chief for NOAA's National Geophysical and Solar-Terrestrial Data Center. She retired from federal service in 1980. Lincoln developed a statistical method for predicting sunspots which is still in use today. In 1973, she received the Department of Commerce Gold Medal for Distinguished Service. She was also inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 2000. Lincoln died in Boulder at the age of 87, August 1, 2003.  Early life  J. Virginia Lincoln was born on September 7, 1915, in Ames, Iowa. Her brother, Rush B. Lincoln Jr. became a Major General in the US Army. Their parents were Rush B. Lincoln and Jeannette Bartholomew Lincoln. Her father was a Major General in the US Army Air Forces. Lincoln's mother taught Chemistry at Iowa State University. Their grandfather Lincoln fought in the Civil War as a Confederate Captain. Lincoln was unsurprisingly deep into her family's military life and continued with this throughout her life. In 1936 she received a bachelor's degree in physics from Wellesley College and a master's degree from Iowa State University in 1938. Simultaneously, she was an instructor in household equipment at Iowa State from 1936 to 1942. She was teaching people how to use all the new electronics and devices that came into their lives.  Career  In 1942, Lincoln joined the U.S. National Bureau of Standards in Washington, DC, working as a physicist in the Interservice Radio Propagation Laboratory (IRPL). There she did ionospheric research. In 1946 the CRPL (Central Radio Propagation Laboratory) was created in order to keep information and research in a one place and to provide radio propagation predictions. These predictions included the investigation of solar and geophysical effects as well as ionospheric data. In 1954 CRPL moved to Boulder, Colorado and Lincoln's first job was a radio weather forecaster. She prepared monthly ionospheric prediction contour maps. These predictions were used in selecting frequencies for long distance radio communications. In 1949, Lincoln helped create a statistical method for predicting sunspot activity that is still used today. Lincoln was the only woman in the official United States delegation of fifty scientists to attend the 1958 meeting of the International Geophysical Year in Moscow. There were several women in the Russian delegation and Lincoln took note of this difference between her country and Russia. In 1959, she became the Deputy Chief of the Radio Warning Services of the Central Radio Propagation Laboratory. There the research and engineering that enables the U.S. Government, national and international standards organizations, and many aspects of the private industry to manage the radio spectrum and ensure that innovative, new technologies are recognized and put to use. Lincoln was the first woman to head a section in a federal bureau. Her area of expertise was in forecasting solar phenomena that affected the technology of radio communications. While working as the director of the World Data Center for Solar-Terrestrial Physics and the Solar-Terrestrial Physics Division Chief for NOAA's National Geophysical and Solar-Terrestrial Data Center, Lincoln created a statistical method for predicting sunspots that is still used to forecast solar storms. From there she worked at the Data Center from 1966 until 1980, the year of her retirement. After Lincoln retired, she became involved with the Boulder Historical Museum, traveled extensively, and played golf.

Development The play was developed by The Anna Collective which at various points contained Suzanne Odette Khuri, Ann-Marie MacDonald, Patricia Nichols, Banuta Rubess, Tori Smith, Barb Taylor, and Maureen White. Officially, the play is generally credited to have been written by Khuri, Macdonald, Rubess, and White. The Anna Collective first presented a twenty-minute version of the play in 1983 at the Women's Perspective Festival. The full-length play premiered in 1984. The development of This is For You, Anna was largely funded by Nightwood Theatre.  Collective creation  This is For You, Anna was developed through the process of collective creation. This medium operates from a foundation of performers' own ideas and experiences, and the final production is largely devised within the rehearsal process itself. This differs from more traditional means of theatre creation in which the script is written independently of the rehearsal process, the cast are aware of their roles before the process begins, and the actors have less of a say in the content of the piece. Additionally, many collective creation plays are characterized by an episodic, nonlinear narrative, actors playing multiple characters within the narrative, and a collaborative creative process which often explores the creators' own interests.http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/collective- creation/, 'Collective Creation', The Canadian Encyclopedia, Alan Filewod, Published 02/07/06, Last Edited 03/04/15 The qualities of collective creation are evident in This is For You, Anna, as it rejects a linear chronology, each actor plays a number of roles (including each of the four actors portraying a different incarnation of Marianne Bachmeier herself), and the original cast of actors were also intimately involved in the creation of the text. The script This is For You, Anna is a one-act play composed of eight scenes which flow together thematically, though are not necessarily connected chronologically. The play makes use of a lyrical poetic style, and live accordion music is used to accompany frequent musical numbers which help to tell the story. This music does not work to create a traditionally polished musical theatre aesthetic. Rather, the music and storytelling create an ethereal, experimental 'folk' atmosphere characteristic of the early days of Nightwood Theatre.'Nightwood Theatre: A Woman's Work is Always Done', Shelley Scott, Canadian Theatre Review, Issue 132, 2007 The most frequently recurring character in the play is Marianne Bachmeier who is played by each of the four actors throughout the play. This is indicated in the script as characters named Marianne 1, 2, 3, and 4. Plot summary The play opens on all four actors as different embodiments of Marianne, each in their own worlds. They reflect on the act of walking into the courtroom before the shooting. The scene transitions into that of a mother telling her daughter a bedtime story in which a woman is tortured by a wealthy baron she loves. The daughter reimagines the ending of the story to include the woman getting revenge on the man who tortured her, and the accordionist turns this new ending into a song. Scene three begins with a narrator providing backstory on Marianne's life, and a brief overview of the event which inspired the play. All four actors then embody Marianne at different points of her life, having conversations with various other absent characters such as Anna (her daughter who was killed), her ex-partner, and an interviewer visiting her in prison. In scene four, the actors tell a paraphrased version of the Roman legend of Lucretia, which is reinterpreted to focus on the parallels between Marianne's own story and the legend itself: namely victim blaming and a desire for revenge. In scene five, the four actors take on characters which speak to their own experiences with abuse and violence. They perform regimented choreography and talk amongst themselves; engaging in dialogue which communicates nuanced perspectives on the complications of living with and leaving abusive partners. Scene six deals with media portrayals of 'victims' and positions these as potentially problematic. In this scene, one actor takes on an 'interviewer' role, grills the other three with personal questions, and demands them to perform certain acts on command. In scene seven, all actors take on the role of Marianne once more, and delve into her intimate thoughts and feelings surrounding the courtroom shooting. The play concludes with 'The Jury Scene' in which the actors take on the role of the jury which found Marianne guilty of murdering the man who murdered her daughter. The characters in this scene condemn Marianne for her actions and defend the man's point of view (who argued in court that Marianne's seven-year-old daughter had flirted with him which led him to commit the murder). These perspectives are written in small snippets, to be spoken rapidly by the cast in order to create an overwhelming crescendo for the audience. This shifts abruptly when the actors all resume their roles as Mariannes 1 through 4, and quietly support and affirm their actions to each other. The play ends.This is For You, Anna The Canadian Theatre Review Anthology, ed.

It was formed by cotton farmers along the Big Black River in 1857. The church was requisitioned as a hospital by Union forces during the American Civil War in May 1863. It was left in ruin by the Union forces, but eventually rebuilt with assistance from St. Alban's Episcopal Church in New York. St. Alban‚Äôs continues to hold services as an active parish, located in the country on Warriors Trail between Vicksburg and Jackson. History=Formation St. Alban's was first organized as a parish in 1857 by a group of cotton farmers along the Big Black River. The first service was held in the Baptist church at Mt. Alban, just west of Bovina in the fall of 1857. Articles of Association were adopted by seventeen men and women of the area to form St. Alban's. A vestry was elected, and Henry Sanson, D.D., was asked to serve as rector. On June 18, 1858, the vestry and congregation voted to erect a church southwest of the train depot in Bovina. Land near the tracks were deeded to the church by Mr. and Mrs. Peterson Bass September 23, 1858. The Rt. Rev. William M. Green, Bishop of Mississippi, consecrated the church now known as St. Alban's on May 5, 1859. American Civil War The early years of the American Civil War were felt by St. Albans church as it lost members of its congregation to the military. Thomas V. Nolan formed the Warren Volunteers June 1, 1861. Thirteen of the eighty-two soldiers had ties to St. Albans Church. The company initially deployed to Corinth, then Virginia. The Warren Volunteers served in the Battle of Malvern Hill and the Battle of Sharpsburg. Just prior to the Siege of Vicksburg, Bovina was filled with soldiers and refugees retreating to Vicksburg after the Battle of Jackson. On May 17, 1863, Union forces broke the defenses of the Confederates at the Battle of Big Black River Bridge and reached Bovina. General Grant left soldiers to guard the Big Black crossing. St. Albans church was then occupied by the 49th Illinois Infantry Regiment. Union Captain John A. Ritter set up a hospital at the church. By the fall of 1863, St. Albans church had been completely demolished, except for some glass from the windows and the corner stone. Post war years After the American Civil War, efforts were started to rebuild the church with the assistance of St. Alban's Church in New York. A new church building built of plain plank, was constructed on the grounds of the original church. The new building was consecrated on February 27, 1880. 20th century Regular worship services were held in the frame building until 1928. In 1928, a new Gothic style church was built retaining the 1870 church as the parish hall. The money for the new church was bequeathed by Matilda Townsend Palmer in 1927. The new church was consecrated on October 20, 1929 with Bishop Theodore Bratton officiating. In 1976, a rectory was built just east of the church.

The American Association of Museums granted the Art Center accreditation in 1973.

The Council of 100 and the Distinguished Woman Artist Award  The Council of 100 presents the Distinguished Woman Artist Award annually to a woman artist who has spent thirty or more years in the studio and has created a unique and prestigious body of work. The Fresno Art Museum was the first museum in the United States to devote a full year of their exhibition schedule 1986/87, exclusively for women artists. In order to finance the cost of this year of exhibitions, it was necessary to match a grant for $25,000. Robert Barrett, the executive director of the museum, suggested the means to raise the funds; to enlist 100 women from the community, each of whom would donate $250 to the museum for this project. Weekly meetings were scheduled to inform the invited women about the project and their involvement with it. The group would be called the Council of 100. Over one hundred women participated and many of those women continue to support this program today.https://www.fresnoartmuseum.org/exhibitions/distinguished-women-artists/ For 29 years, the Fresno Art Museum's Council of 100, remains a unique organization devoted to recognizing outstanding women in the arts.

During it activists mostly were distributing leaflets near higher educational institutions, in which were described consequences EIE from adoption of draft law \\"On higher education\\" #2060–∞ and #1187. There were not a lot incidents. In Vinnytsia near Vinnytsia National Agrarian University activists and journalist were constantly attacked by \\"Voluntary people's squad\\". Grigoriy Kalietnik, a coauthor of the draft law \\"On higher education\\" #1187, was a rector in that time. Results All attempts to adopt draft laws, against which students protested, failed. On April 8, 2014 Verkhovna Rada voted in first reading for draft law \\"On higher education\\" #1187-2 developed by working group of Zgurovsky.New Law \\"On Higher Education\\" Adopted! - NTUU \\"KPI\\" After that voting for a draft law in second reading was groundlessly delayed. Students held several actions demanding that draft law was adopted sooner. On July 1 the draft law was adopted in the second reading and on August 1 was signed by the President. And finally it came into force September 6, 2014.

Hoffer (December 12, 1929 ‚Äì May 3, 2017) was an American music educator.  Life and teaching career  Hoffer was born in East Lansing, Michigan in 1929. His father was a sociology professor at Michigan State University and his mother became a stay-at-home mother after a year of nursing. He grew up playing the piano then switched to clarinet, which he continued to play in both high school and college. He completed his bachelor's degree in Music Education at Michigan State University. Dr. Hoffer completed his master's degree in Clarinet Performance at the Eastman School of Music, then his PhD from Michigan State University. After completing his degree, Dr. Hoffer taught public school in Michigan, New York, and Missouri. After 14 years of teaching, he accepted a position on the faculty at Indiana University at Bloomington (1966). In 1984 he joined the University of Florida, where he became head of the music education area. Dr. Hoffer was often hired to teach summer sessions at institutions such as the Peabody Conservatory and University of Michigan.  Philosophy  Hoffer admitted to first focusing on ratings at competitions, but after the tragic loss of a student, he began to question what his students were gaining in the long-term from his teaching. This inspired him to show videos, play examples, and do whatever would be beneficial for his students. When he was asked to serve on the committee to create state and national standards, Dr. Hoffer firmly supported the inclusion of practical standards that would make a difference in teachers‚Äô lives. To advocate for music education, Dr. Hoffer utilized a set of questions he considered basic necessities, such as \\"Can students recognize when the theme comes back? Do they know what a fugue is?\\". He believed that all children deserve the right to an education in music so that they can recognize the basics of music throughout the rest of their lives. (C. Hoffer, personal communication, October 23, 2015)  Contributions to music education  Hoffer has been president of the Indiana Music Educators Association, president of the North Central Division of MENC, and national president of the MENC: The National Association for Music Education (now NAfME). Not only did he help write Florida‚Äôs Sunshine State Standards, but also served on the committee that wrote the National Standards in Music.  Awards  Hoffer was elected into the National Association for Music Education Hall of Fame in 2005. He was recognized at the 60th MENC National Biennial In-Service Conference in April 2006 held in Salt Lake City, Utah.  List of publications  * Hoffer, C. R. (1954). Research and the music teacher.

Faddeeva published some of the earliest work in the field of numerical linear algebra. Her 1950 work, Computational methods of linear algebra was widely acclaimed and she won a USSR State Prize for it. Between 1962 and 1975, she wrote many research papers with her husband, Dmitry Konstantinovich Faddeev. Biography Vera Nikolaevna Zamyatina () was born 20 September 1906 in Tambov, Russia, to Nikolai Zamyatin. She began her higher education in 1927 at the Leningrad State Pedagogical Institute and then transferred in 1928 to Leningrad State University. She graduated in 1930, married Dmitrii Konstantinovich Faddeev, a fellow mathematician, and began work at the Leningrad Board of Weights and Measures, all in the same year. Between 1930 and 1934, she worked at the Leningrad Hydraulic Engineering Institute and simultaneously between 1933 and 1934 served as a junior researcher at the Seismology Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences. Beginning in 1935, she conducted research under Boris Grigorievich Galerkin at the Leningrad Institute of Constructions for three years. She returned to the Pedagogical Institute to complete her graduate work in 1938, studying for the next three years. In 1942 Faddeeva was appointed as a junior researcher at the Steklov Institute of Mathematics in Leningrad, but had to flee the city during the German invasion. She lived in Kazan with her family until the siege was over in 1944 and they were able to secure permits as academics to return. By 1946, she had completed her thesis entitled On One Problem and submitted it to the Department of Mathematical Physics of Leningrad State University. The thesis was accepted and she received the equivalent of a PhD in 1946. In 1949 she published two papers: The method of lines applied to some boundary problems and On fundamental functions of the operator X{IV}. The following year, she published a book with a colleague, Mark Konstantinovich Gavurin, which was a series of Bessel function tables and her most famous work, Computational methods of linear algebra, which was one of the first of its kind in the field. The book described linear algebra, gave methods for solving linear equations and the inversion of matrices, and explained computing square roots and eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix. Faddeeva had continued working at the Steklov Institute, she would work there until her retirement, and in 1951, became head of the Laboratory of Numerical Computations. This unit was based on a model unit set up at Leningrad State University by Gavurin with Leonid Vitalyevich Kantorovich in 1948. Computational methods was translated into English in 1959 and was widely influential. In 1960, the book was expanded and reprinted in Russian, she was awarded a USSR State Prize, and it also was translated into English, being published in 1963. Between 1962 and 1974, she worked with her husband compiling a summary of developments being made in linear algebra, which were published in 1975. Faddeeva's last paper, prepared in 1980 for a conference in Warsaw was entitled Numerical methods of linear algebra in computer formulation and was published posthumously in 1984. Death and legacy Faddeeva died 15 April 1983 in Leningrad, Russia. She is remembered as an important Russian mathematician, specializing in linear algebra, who worked in the 20th century. Personal Vera Nikolaevna Zamyatina married Dmitry Konstantinovich Faddeev in 1930. Children: Maria (b. 6 October 1931), a chemist; Ludvig (10 March 1934-26 February 2017), a mathematician and theoretical physicist; and Michael (28 June 1937‚Äì30 September 1992), a mathematician.

The film offered support to the Nazi Party's anti-Semitic stance by a negative portrayal of the two Jewish film producers. It received strong official backing, and a gala premiere was arranged for its release by Joseph Goebbels. To Goebbels' surprise and disgust, the first night audience booed, once the screening was over. The incident was largely hushed-up, and the film's director Arz√©n von Cser√©py went back to his native Hungary in disgrace and never made another German film.Hull, p. 69 The film was a success, however, for the young actress Hilde Kr√ºger.

The battalion has been assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division, 11th Airborne Division and 101st Airborne Division. The battalion has participated in World War I, World War II, Vietnam, Operation Desert Storm, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation Enduring Freedom. The battalion inactivated in July 2015 as part of ongoing force reductions, and it personnel and equipment reflagged as the 2nd Battalion, 32nd Field Artillery Regiment History=World War I The 2-320th FAR's beginnings can be traced back to America's entry into the First World War. As part of the nation's mobilization, 2-320th was constituted, organized and activated in August 1917 as Battery B, 320th Field Artillery (B/320th FA). As part of the original 82nd Division, B/320th FA played a key role at Lorraine, St. Mihiel, and the Meuse Argonne region in France. Following the Armistice, the 320th FA demobilized, only to be reconstituted in June 1921 as part of the United States Organized Reserves. World War II In August 1942, when the 82nd Infantry Division was converted to an airborne division, the 320th FA (including B/320th) was reorganized and redesignated as the 320th Glider Field Artillery Battalion (GFAB). As part of the 82nd Airborne Division, the 320th GFAB fought in a number of hot spots. First, the 320th GFAB was part of the campaign in Sicily, acting in reserve. The unit first saw action at the Volturno River on the Italian mainland. The crucial Normandy invasion was the next stop for the 320th GFAB. Under difficult conditions, the unit helped make the invasion a success. As a result of the 320th's actions during Operation Overlord, the unit was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation. The 320th GFAB next fought in Operation Market Garden and then the Battle of the Bulge when the Germans attempted their last- ditch offensive. The 320th GFAB then fought and played a role in the final push through the Rhineland to defeat Germany. Upon the war's end the unit completed its duties in Europe as part of the post-war occupation in Berlin. Post-World War II After the war, the 320th GFAB went through a number of transitions. It was inactivated on 15 December 1948 and relieved from assignment to the 82nd Airborne Division on 14 December 1950. On 1 August 1951 it was reorganized and redesignated as the 320th Airborne Field Artillery Battalion (AFAB), and activated at Fort Benning, Georgia. Post-Korean War During the 1950s, the 320th FA served as the field artillery battalion of the separate 508th Airborne Regimental Combat Team. When the Army eliminated infantry regiments and battalions from division and organized under the Pentomic structure, the 320th Field Artillery was reorganized as a parent regiment under the Combat Arms Regimental System. B/320th FA was assigned to the 11th Airborne Division in Germany. B/320th FA was inactivated on 1 July 1958 in Germany when the 11th Airborne was inactivated and replaced by the 24th Infantry Division. B/320th FA were redesignated on 15 November 1962 as Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 2nd Battalion, 320th Artillery, and assigned to the 101st Airborne Division (organic elements concurrently constituted). Post-VietnamGulf War 2-320 FAR next saw action in the Middle East from 1990 until 1991. As a part of the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), the battalion was part of the massive US force that drove the Iraqi Army from Kuwait. Operation Iraqi Freedom I The battalion served honorably in Operation Iraqi Freedom. As a member of the famed 101st Airborne Division, the battalion deployed 3 times to Iraq in support of the operation, to include the initial push into the country 24 March 2003.

In Cooper v. Aaron (1958), the Supreme Court of the United States held that federal law prevails over state law due to the operation of the Supremacy Clause, and that federal law \\"can neither be nullified openly and directly by state legislators or state executive or judicial officers nor nullified indirectly by them through evasive schemes ...\\" Thus, state laws purporting to nullify federal statutes or to exempt states and their citizens from federal statutes have only symbolic impact. State sovereignty resolutions (10th Amendment resolutions) These resolutions attempt to reassert state sovereignty over any area not listed among the \\"enumerated powers\\" (i.e., any law based on an \\"expansive reading\\" of the Commerce Clause, the Necessary and Proper Clause, or the Supremacy Clause would, according to this resolution, be invalid). *During 2009, \\"state sovereignty resolutions\\" or \\"10th Amendment Resolutions\\" were introduced in the legislatures of 37 states; in seven states the resolutions passed (Alaska, Idaho, North Dakota, South Dakota, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Tennessee). *During 2010, resolutions were introduced or reintroduced into the legislatures of 21 states; the resolution passed in seven states (Alabama, Arizona, Kansas, Nebraska, South Carolina, Utah, and Wyoming).Not all states require gubernatorial assent of resolutions; in some states a resolution is deemed passed if both houses concur as to the language. *A state sovereignty resolution was prefiled for the 2011 session of the Texas Legislature (a prior 2009 resolution did not pass). State sovereignty bills (10th Amendment Bills) A \\"State Sovereignty Bill\\" is one step beyond a State Sovereignty Resolution. The bill would mandate action against what the state legislature perceives as unconstitutional federal legislation. *During 2010, such legislation was introduced in six states (Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire, and Oklahoma); however, none made it past the introductory stage. Firearms freedom legislation and federal gun laws nullification Starting in 2012, in response to a threat of law made through executive orders by President Obama, more than a dozen states around the US began proposing legislation that would \\"...declare that any firearms made and retained in-state are beyond the authority of Congress under its constitutional power to regulate commerce among the states\\". The legislation would require that the firearm be prominently marked as being \\"Made in {name of state}\\" and further prohibit federal regulation solely on the basis that \\"basic materials\\" and \\"generic and insignificant parts\\" of the firearm may have their origins from outside the state. *Through 2010, resolutions have been introduced in the legislatures of 27 states that would nullify federal authority over such local firearms. The legislation passed in Montana and Tennessee in 2009 and in Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming the following year. South Carolina has taken the issue one step further: in 2010 a bill was introduced which would effectively nullify all gun registration laws within the state. *Texas has prefiled and West Virginia has filed similar legislation for the current 2011 legislative session. *In 2013, one of the most strongly worded Second Amendment protection acts in the nation was signed into law in Kansas.Kansas Governor Signs Second Amendment Protection Act.

Cannabis laws , 24 states (Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington) and the District of Columbia have passed legislation which permit the use of medical cannabis. In 2012, both Washington and Colorado had legalized the recreational use of cannabis. Both states previously legalized the use of medical cannabis. The ballot measure allows for anyone over 21 to possess up to an ounce from licensed vendors.Voorhees, Josh.

The Obama administration announced in October 2009 that it advised federal prosecutors not to target legally-operating medicinal cannabis users, or their suppliers, in states that have passed such laws. However, in the same year, the DEA conducted a record number of medical cannabis raids. The DEA has continued to raid federally prohibited medical facilities in several states. The IRS has also attempted to prevent the sale of medical cannabis in California by refusing to treat normally-deductible business expenses as such for dispensaries, notably for the Harborside Health Center in Oakland. REAL ID Act , 25 states (beginning with Maine in 2007) have passed legislation and/or resolutions which opposed the REAL ID Act. Though the legislation is still on the books, its implementation has been delayed on several occasions and is currently not being enforced. National health care nullification , legislators in 30 states had introduced legislation which would declare certain provisions of any proposed national health care bill to be null and void within the state; the legislation passed in Arizona, Idaho, Utah, and Virginia. Such provisions include mandatory participation in such a system as well as preserving the right of a patient to pay a health care professional for treatment (and for the professional to accept it) outside of a single- payer system. Arizona's legislation passed as a proposed constitutional amendment, approved by voters in 2010. On February 1, 2010, the Virginia Senate took a stand against a key provision of a proposed federal health care overhaul, passing legislation declaring that Virginia residents cannot be forced to buy health insurance. On March 17, 2010, Idaho Governor C.L. \\"Butch\\" Otter signed a bill requiring the Attorney General to sue the federal government if Idaho residents are required to buy health insurance.Miller, John, AP (March 18, 2010). Idaho First to Sign Law against Health Care Reform. ABC News. Bring the Guard home , legislators in seven states had introduced legislation which would permit the governor of the state to recall any National Guard troops from overseas deployments (such as in Iraq and Afghanistan); the bills failed in Maryland and New Mexico. Legal tender , legislators in seven states have introduced legislation which would seek to nullify federal legal tender laws in the state by authorizing payment in gold and silver or a paper note backed 100% by gold or silver; the legislation failed in Colorado and Montana. Cap-and-trade nullification , legislators in four states have introduced legislation which would nullify any proposed federal emissions regulation under the \\"cap-and-trade\\" model; none have advanced beyond the introductory stage. State sovereignty and federal tax funds acts , legislators in three states have introduced legislation which would require businesses (and in some cases, individuals) to remit their federal tax payments to the state treasurer (or equivalent body) for deposit into an escrow fund. If the state legislature determined that a portion of the federal budget was not constitutional, or if the federal government imposed penalties or sanctions upon the state for creating the fund, then the money would be withheld. None have advanced beyond the introductory stage. Sheriffs first legislation , legislators in three states had introduced legislation which would make it a crime for any federal agent to make an arrest, search or seizure within the state without getting the advance, written permission of the sheriff of the county in which the event would take place. The bills would provide for the following exceptions: * Actions on federal property * A federal employee witnesses a crime requiring an immediate arrest * Actions under either hot pursuit or involving immigration * The person to be apprehended is either an elected county or state officer, an employee of the sheriff's office, or has such close connection with the sheriff that the person is likely to be notified by the sheriff of any impending action. None have advanced beyond the introductory stage. Federal land legislation , legislators in Utah have introduced legislation to allow the use of eminent domain on federal land. Rep. Christopher Herrod has introduced the bill in a state where the federal government controls over 60% of the land. The effort has the full support of Republican Attorney General Mark Shurtleff, who would have to defend the law. The proposal includes setting aside $3 million for legal defense.Vergaris, Brock, AP (February 11, 2010). Utah Lawmakers Want Federal Land Returned to State. ABC News.Carltom, Jim (March 30, 2010). Federal Land Seizures Urged by Utah Governor. Wall Street Journal. Nullification of federal intrastate commerce regulation , legislators in four states had introduced legislation which would nullify federal regulation of trade and activities which are solely within the boundaries of a state and which do not cross state lines; that is activities that are by its definition not commerce, under the Constitution. The Virginia legislation has passed one house. Sanctuary city Another form of protest against enforcement of immigration laws, several United States cities have declared themselves sanctuary cities, whereby they have ordered the local police department to specifically not work with United States Customs and Border Protection officials to arrest persons illegally residing within the boundaries of the city, and not to inquire as to a person's immigration status, even if the person was arrested. Intrastate Coal and Use Act In protest of the Environmental Protection Agency allegedly overstepping its authority by interfering with intrastate commerce, the West Virginia Intrastate Coal and Use Act (H.B. 2554) was being introduced into the West Virginia House of Delegates by Delegate Gary Howell. The bill states that coal sold and used within the borders of West Virginia is not subject to EPA authority because no interstate commerce exists and the state retains the rights to control its own intrastate commerce under the 10th Amendment. The American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) recommends the Intrastate Coal and Use Act for model legislation in other states.

The condition is likely triggered by changes in the anulus fibrosus, the tough outer ring of the intervertebral disc. This disc degeneration causes osteophytes to grow in the area. The osteophytes develop bridges of connective tissue which become ossified, forming bone spurs. The pattern of osteophyte formation varies. The exact pathophysiology of the process is unclear.

History  Prior to 2012, multiple state agencies and offices had provided statutory regulation and authorization of colleges and universities in Oregon, including the Superintendent of Public Instruction, the Oregon University System, the State Board of Higher Education, the Department of Community Colleges and Workforce Development, the Oregon Student Assistance Commission, and the Oregon legislature. With the passage of SB 242 in 2011, the legislature created the Higher Education Coordinating Commission (HECC) to coordinate between community colleges and state universities, but its role, funding, and staffing remained unclear until the 2013 legislative session. Two pieces of legislation in 2013, SB 270 and HB 3120, provided an extensive overhaul and reconfiguration of educational committees, commissions, boards, and agencies in Oregon. SB 270 provided for independent boards for universities that had previously been governed by the State Board of Education, and HB 3120 reconfigured the HECC, vesting it with additional state policy and budgetary authority for higher education in Oregon. One observer noted that Oregon postsecondary education had seen \\"more policy changes in the last few years than it has in the past 50\\".  Agency structure  The Higher Education Coordinating Commission is overseen by the Chief Education Office, which has policy authority for preschool through higher education in Oregon. The commission's Office of the Executive Director, Policy, and Communications is in charge of \\"the central executive role of the agency, as well as communications, legislative affairs, human resources, policy initiatives, and other roles for the integrated agency\\".

Wanting to do missionary work, he joined the La Soci√©t√© des Missions Etrang√®res (MEP) with the intention of going to Vietnam. In 1827, after arriving in Asia, he was instead assigned to Bangkok where the existing bishop, Esprit-Marie-Joseph Florens had only one missionary priest. He learned the Thai language but soon found out the majority of Christians were typically not of Thai ancestry but rather Khmer, Chinese, Vietnamese, and those of mixed Portuguese-Asian background; as the Thai Buddhists were not as amenable to conversion, he focused his efforts on the minority groups. Brugui√®re taught at the school at the Church of the Assumption for several years and then after repeated requests by Florens for a replacement, he was appointed by Pope Leo XII on February 5, 1828, the Coadjutor Vicar Apostolic of Siam and Titular Bishop of Capsus. He was consecrated bishop on June 29, 1829 by Bishop Esprit- Marie-Joseph Florens, Vicar Apostolic of Siam. In 1830, after two new missionary priests arrived in Bangkok, Claude-Antoine Deschavannes and Jean- Baptiste Pallegoix), Brugui√®re moved to Penang in 1831 where he taught at the MEP-run General College along with Jacques-Honor√© Chastan, Jean-Baptiste Boucho, Jean Pierre Barbe, and Laurent-Joseph-Marius Imbert. An influx of funding and MEP missionaries into the region lessened the need for him to remain in Siam and it was proposed that he go to Korea and establish a new mission. Bishop Florens supported the mission despite the fact that it would leave him without a coadjutor when he died. On September 9, 1831, Brugui√®re was appointed the first Apostolic Vicar of Korea by Pope Gregory XVI. In 1935, he sailed from Singapore to Manila and then to China first to Macau then to Fujian Province and finally to Shanxi Province. Due to persecutions against Christians in China and political changes in Korea, he first took shelter amongst the Christian population in Xiwanzi where he met MEP missionary Pierre-Philibert Maubant who volunteered for the Korea mission. On October 7, 1835, they set out but before he could reach Korea, Brugui√®re became sick and died on October 20, 1835. Maubant would later be joined by Jacques-Honor√© Chastan and Laurent Joseph Marius Imbert where they would eventually be arrested and martyred.

It was a form of Public humiliation in which the condemned was made to confess and repent their crime before being rehabilitated and spared further punishments. It could be sentenced by the church or by a secular court, and performed by the church. History The Kyrkoplikt originated from the Confession and repentance within the Catholic church during the middle ages: after having committed a graver crime, the criminal was cast out of their parish congregation, and was only rehabilitated after having repented their sin. In the Swedish Church Ordinance 1571, the Kyrkoplikt consisted of the corporal punishments meted out within the sphere of Public humiliation, such as pillorying, the Stocks, Corporal Punishment and similar punishments, or fines. Finally, the condemned were made to stand upon the Pliktpallen (Duty Stool) also called Skampallen (Shame Stool) during church sermon, when their crime were described, after which they repented and were rehabilitated. The punishment could be meted out by both the church as well as by a secular court, who both had the right to handle criminals. By the Swedish Church Law 1686, the church was no longer allowed to handle court cases and judge criminals and the right to sentence criminals to Kyrkoplikt was reserved for the legal courts of the state. In 1741, a legal reform created two forms of Kyrkoplikt: Uppenbar kyrkoplikt and Enskild kyrkoplikt. On 4 May 1855, Kyrkoplikt and all forms of Public humiliation was abolished in Sweden. In Finland, the same reform was introduced in 1864. Uppenbar kyrkoplikt The Uppenbar kyrkoplikt (literary: 'Obvious Church Duty') was the original form of kyrkoplikt. As stated above, it consisted of the condemned being exposed on the Pliktpallen (Duty Stool) also called Skampallen (Shame Stool) during church sermon, when their crime were described, after which they repented and were rehabilitated, in many cases after having been subjected to other form of punishments before. Uppenbar kyrkoplikt was meted out for all forms of criminalized acts: theft, adultery, abuse, witchcraft and those pardoned from the death sentence. By the reform of 1741, Uppenbar kyrkoplikt was abolished for sex outside of marriage. All sexual acts outside of marriage were formally illegal, but as an illegal sexual act was normally only exposed when it resulted in pregnancy, and the male party could deny having engaged in the act while the participation of the pregnant female in the act was undeniable, the Uppenbar kyrkoplikt was in practice mostly used upon unmarried mothers.Ohlander, Ann-Sofie, K√§rlek, d√∂d och frihet: historiska uppsatser om m√§nniskov√§rde och livsvillkor i Sverige, Norstedt, Stockholm, 1985 This was viewed as a problem in the Riksdag of the Estates, because the social stigma caused by the Uppenbar kyrkoplikt way of exposing the women, who felt themselves socially branded, was found to be a significant cause of infanticide performed by unmarried women desperate to do anything to avoid having their reputation ruined by the shame, and despite opposition from the clergy, Uppenbar kyrkoplikt was abolished for sexual crimes in an attempt to prevent infanticide.Ohlander, Ann-Sofie, K√§rlek, d√∂d och frihet: historiska uppsatser om m√§nniskov√§rde och livsvillkor i Sverige, Norstedt, Stockholm, 1985 This reform was followed by the Barnamordsplakatet in 1778. Enskild kyrkoplikt The Enskild kyrkoplikt (literary: 'Private Church Duty') meant that the criminal was made to confess and repent in the Sacristy, before or after service, in private before the priest and only a handful of witnesses selected by the priest. This was used for the crime of sex outside of marriage, as well as smaller crimes such as insignificant forms of theft. References * Nordisk familjebok / 1800-talsutg√•van. 9.

Vanderbilt Commodores athletics, 2009-12-16.Celebrating Change at Vanderbilt University Phillips started at center in her sophomore and junior years, but lost her starting spot when the Commodores started adding more scholarship players. Nonetheless, she was named Lady Commodore Athlete of the Year in 1980, and also won the Nashville Civitans' Sportsmanship Award in 1979 and 1980. Phillips graduated in 1980. She was working as an insurance broker in Atlanta when Vanderbilt's first full-time women's coach, Phil Lee, asked her to come back to Nashville as a part-time assistant. She stayed at Vanderbilt from 1981 to 1984, winning the National Women's Invitational Tournament in 1984. She was hired as head coach at Division III Fisk, also in Nashville, in 1984, and tallied a record of 62‚Äì38 in five years, winning two Women's Intercollegiate Athletic Conference titles. She moved to nearby TSU in 1989, taking over a team that had won a total of eight games in three years. She went 150‚Äì151 in 11 years, winning consecutive Ohio Valley Conference regular season tournament titles in 1994 and 1995. She also served as interim athletic director on two occasions while still serving as coach.

Phillips suspended Richardson and named Lewis interim coach. Richardson resigned a few weeks later, and Phillips named Lewis interim coach for the rest of the season. In February 2003, TSU and Eastern Kentucky got into a fight-marred game that saw 19 players ejected. Conference rules required Lewis to sit out one game. Rather than force 26-year-old assistant Chris Graves, who only two years' coaching experience, to lead the team, Phillips named herself interim coach for the Tigers' game against Austin Peay.Longman, Jere.

Aggie can be seen representing the North Carolina A&T; athletic teams on the sideline of football games at Aggie Stadium and at Corbett Sports Center during basketball games. Although the physical representation of the athletic teams is a bulldog, the term \\"Aggie\\" has a historical connection to the university's agricultural roots as a land grant university.  History  The earliest known mascot at A&T; dates back to the late 1970s. While live bulldog mascots were used on and off for the next several years, it was decided that an anthropomorphized version, as the one on the university logos at the time, would be a better fit. Over the years the face of Aggie has changed, but the basic concept of a clothed two-legged bulldog remained the same. There have been 12 official Aggie dogs in the school's history, with the first making his appearance in the fall of 1984.  The legend of the Aggie Bulldog  The term Aggie is a diminutive form of agricultural, which has long been used to refer to students who attend agricultural schools. Upon its founding as a land grant university in 1891, the school, then the Agricultural and Mechanical School for the Colored Race, adopted the nickname. According to oral history, the origin of the Aggie Bulldog mascot stems from a tale of a shepherd dog, a bulldog, that was kept on the college's farm to assist in herding the cattle and other animals into shelter. During a football game the Aggies had become despondent. In the last few minutes of the game, an Aggie fullback broke through the opposition's defense and scored a touchdown, but was deemed no good by a referee. It is said that at that moment, an unidentified person untied the bulldog which then attacked the referee. The incident was said to almost cost the school its membership in the CIAA, but it vindicated the Aggies. It is said that from that day on, the mascot for the football team has been a bulldog.  Function of Aggie  Aggie makes appearances at all, A&T; football and home men's basketball games. In addition, He appears at select home women's basketball, baseball games and home bowling meets. Aggie can be seen as well at tournaments such as the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference basketball tourney and the NCAA. At athletic events, Aggie interacts with the fans to build excitement and help cheer A&T; teams to victory. Besides athletic events, Aggie also appears at social events for both the university and Greater Greensboro community. Aggie is a prominent figure during Homecoming Week as he can be seen at pep rallies, participating in the homecoming parade and even appearing on television to boost community awareness of the festivities. Aggie also makes public appearances in the annual Greensboro Holiday parade and grand opening events for companies in the Greensboro area by request.

Robertson was best known for his treatment of civilians and rebel soldiers in the Chinese Revolution of 1911, as well as his aid in the establishment of a Red Cross League and a Hospital for Disabled Soldiers in Shaanxi.

Missionary work Sianfu Hospital, later renamed the Jenkins- Robertson Memorial Hospital In addition to studying theology and medicine, Robertson prepared for his missionary career by studying Chinese at King's College London.Meyer, Page 25. He was adopted by the Baptist Churches of East London, who would support his missionary work. On 12 October 1909 he set sail aboard the Prince Ludwig, beginning his journey to Xi'an, China.Meyer, Pages 26‚Äì27. Early work at Sianfu hospital Robertson arrived in Xi'an in December 1909 and began working with Dr. Herbert Stanley Jenkins, Dr. Andrew and Dr. Charlotte Young,Glover, Richard.

Watson, and Reverend A.G. and Maud Shorrock.Glover, Page 45.Meyer, Page 31. During his first year in China, Robertson primarily studied Chinese and looked after the local boys' school. He saw outpatients at the Sianfu Hospital once a week and looked after recovering opium patients.Meyer, Page 38. Experience at Yan'an Cecil Frederick Robertson (right) travelling to Yan'an, China from Xi'an Robertson left Xi'an for Yan'an in Northern Shaanxi on February 1911. At Yan'an he underwent six weeks of medical training that prepared him for the remainder of his career as a medical missionary.Meyer, Page 41. A Baptist Missionary Society station had been founded there the previous year by Rev. and Mrs. Watson, but it had no doctor. Opium addiction was particularly prevalent in Northern Shaanxi and thus became a priority for treatment. Upon his arrival, Robertson arranged for an opium refuge to be set up in the back of a church for those seeking recovery from addiction. He additionally took over the small dispensary at Yan'an and visited patients in their homes.Meyer, Pages 42‚Äì45. While at Yan'an Robertson earned the praise and recognition of local government officials, including the Head Mandarin of the prefecture, the Prefect, the County Magistrate, and the head military Mandarin.Meyer, Pages 46‚Äì47. His relationships with local officials in Yan'an prepared him for future interactions with other officials during his missionary career. 1911 revolution In May 1911 Dr. Jenkins went home on furlough, leaving Robertson to take charge of the Sianfu Hospital.Meyer, Page 54. In September that year, the missionary received reports of the 1911 Chinese Revolution beginning.Meyer, Page 57. The revolution reached Shaanxi on 22 October, leaving approximately 15,000 Manchus dead in Xi'an. While several missionaries left Shaanxi during this period, Robertson insisted on staying and helping the wounded. He organised ambulances and treated wounded soldiers both on the battlefield and in the hospital. During the months of the revolution an estimated 2,000‚Äì3,000 patients passed through the Sianfu Hospital, which was run by only two doctors with the aid of the local Chinese Red Cross Society.Meyer, Page 75. The Qing emperor Puyi abdicated the throne in February 1912, and the fighting in Xi'an ended soon after.Meyer, Page 74. Work following the revolution In April 1912, the other doctor at the Sianfu Hospital, Dr. Young, fell ill with appendicitis. Robertson operated on Young and saw to his recovery while running the hospital himself.Glover, Page 102. In June Robertson began working with the Governor of the Province to set up an institute for disabled soldiers, which was later established as the \\"Pity The Wounded Hospital\\".Meyer, Page 130. Death On 11 February 1913 Robertson received a message from a missionary in the province of Gansu requesting travel aid to bring his two-year-old son to Robertson for smallpox treatment.Meyer, Page 146.Glover, Page 111. Robertson made the four days' to Gansu journey himself immediately and arrived in two days. He treated the child, who did not have smallpox, and returned in three days' time.Glover, Page 112. Upon his return he wrote to his mother that the journey had \\"shown me that I am far fitter than I thought I was.\\"Meyer, Pages 146‚Äì147. However, somewhere along that journey Robertson contracted typhus. On 5 March he was confined to bed rest with a fever of 104 degrees. On the morning of 6 March he entered a coma; Robertson died later that day.Meyers, Page 150. Legacy Beyond his work at the Sianfu Hospital Robertson made significant contributions to Xi'an during his service, including the establishment of an institute for disabled soldiers, the Pity The Wounded Hospital. He also credited with the success and training of the newly founded Red Cross League in Shaanxi during and after the 1911 Revolution. Robertson was well-respected by local authorities of both the imperial and Republic governments. Upon his death he was given the distinction of a full military funeral by the Military Governor. After he and Dr. Jenkins had died, the Sianfu Hospital was renamed the Jenkins-Robertson Memorial Hospital in their honour.\\"Jenkins-Robertson Memorial Hospital.\\" The History of Western Medicine in China.

Plot Husband-and-wife acting team Curtis and Eve Farnsworth have a daughter, Janie, who attends a very exclusive boarding school. Janie is frustrated because her parents pay more attention to acting than to her and because Chuck Grant, in charge of the school's upcoming musical production, tells Janie she can't act, can't dance and isn't glamorous enough to be in the show. Janie eventually becomes aware that her father's career is flourishing but her mother's is not. Rather than accept roles opposite a younger co-star, Curtis decides to retire without telling his wife why. Janie, meanwhile, ignored by her parents but encouraged by principal Miss Pennington, turns out to be a very good singer, so now Chuck does want her to perform. Confusion reigns when word is falsely spread that Janie and Chuck are also romantically involved. Their angry parents come to the school to withdraw them. Pennington persuades them to wait until the show, and when they finally see how talented Janie is, everybody ends up happy.

Smith (1894-1969), was an American regional artist, often associated with Cape Cod. He was a WPA administrator and as an artist he was best known for his bas-relief woodcarvings. His works also include oil paintings, watercolors, batik designs, and constructions in aluminum.  Biography = Early years  Born August 8, 1894 in Cortland, New York, Vernon Smith spent his early years in and around the Finger Lakes region. In 1913, Smith began attending the School of Fine and Applied Arts in New York City. His painting instructors included Jonas Lie, Howard Giles and Sloan Bredin. He learned metalwork, textile design, and interior decoration under the school's founder Frank Parsons. Smith taught for a year at the Manhattan School of Art.  World War I  In April, 1918, Vernon Smith was conscripted into the Army and arrived at the front in July, As a private, Smith's duties included camouflaging artillery and attending to mules. He often accompanied Sgt. Harry K. Fisk, a New York illustrator, to sketch advanced locations. After the war, Smith elected to stay in France where he spent time in Paris and then Poitiers, where he enrolled at the Sorbonne Institute of Art. In January 1920, Smith returned to New York City, where he met Doris Withycomb, who he later married. After spending the summer running a tea shop in Provincetown, Massachusetts, Smith moved to Beacon Street in Boston, where he designed stage sets for the Peabody Playhouse.  Cape Cod  In January 1922, at the invitation of Sally White Johnstone and Prescott Townsend, Smith and Withycomb moved to Orleans on Cape Cod where they married and purchased a home. During his first decade on Cape Cod, Smith made his living designing batik fabrics and a product line of aluminum buckles and buttons. He also opened a small antiques shop. By 1927, the Smiths had three children: Joy, Sara, and Peter. In 1933, a group of Smith's neighbors on Monument Road organized an Episcopal congregation: The Church of the Holy Spirit. Smith designed the small church and outfitted it with engraved sconces, carved pews, and a crucifix. A small cultural movement formed on Monument Road which in addition to the church, included summer camps, an outdoor theater, and \\"The Galley West,\\" which sold local crafts including Smith's metal work.  Federal Arts Project  In 1936, Smith was appointed supervisor of the Cape Cod artists on relief under the Federal Art Project. His charges ranged from ‚ÄúModernists‚Äù to \\"Regionalists,\\" which included among others: Karl Knaths, Blanche Lazzell, Phillip Malicoat, Vernon Herbert Coleman, George Yater, Eliot Orr, and Howard Gibbs. He also associated with Ross Moffett, Edwin Dickinson, and Edward Hopper who he joined in group exhibitions and social activities. Whitney E. Smith noted in his doctoral dissertation that \\"The most important man for the Provincetown artists in [the FAP bureaucracy] was fellow-artist Vernon Smith.\\" In the summer of 1937, Smith was selected as one of twelve FAP artists to tour the territory of Alaska and record their impressions. With fellow artists Prescott Jones and Edwin Johnson, Smith traveled to Valdez, Fairbanks, and McKinley Park. Artwork from the tour was distributed to federal facilities, with much of it remaining in Alaska.  World War II  During the early years of WWII, Smith worked in a ball bearing factory in Connecticut. While in Orleans, he volunteered for shore patrol. Later, Smith performed civilian service at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, charting ocean currents and lettering maps.  Postwar  After the war, Smith was represented by the Kraushaar Galleries in New York City. He had a one-man show there in 1946 and participated in other gallery shows throughout the 1950s. In 1948, Smith's wife became debilitated with multiple sclerosis and died. That same year, Smith helped found the Cape Cod Art Association in Barnstable, Massachusetts and served as its president in 1951. Smith continued throughout the 1950s to teach art classes at his private studio and in public schools. He continued his artwork and exhibited widely. In 1949 he married for a second time to Gwen Barry from New York. This second marriage ended in 1961, after which Smith began to divide his time between summers on Cape Cod and travels around the country the rest of the year. He set up a studio in Corrales, New Mexico where his son Peter Smith lived. In 1963, Smith acquired a new dealer for his art in Lester K. Henderson from Carmel, California. Several times Smith stayed in Carmel where he showed his work and took on commissions. In 1965, Smith suffered a stroke while in New Mexico. Partially paralyzed as a result, this ended his artistic output. He returned to Cape Cod and lived under the care of his daughter, Sara Smith Joy. He died in September 1969. His ashes were interred under one of his soapstone carvings at the Church of the Holy Spirit, Orleans, Massachusetts.  Art work = Early works  From Smith's time in France, the few surviving canvases display influence of the Barbizon school of landscape. Other canvases, from his time at the Sorbonne Institute of Art, show the colorful, confident brushwork of a post-impressionist. His subjects were farms, peasants and flowering trees. From the 1920s, Smith's Batiks displayed themes from the ages of sailing ships and medieval fairy tale towns. Crafts from this time consisted of hammered aluminum items such as buttons, buckles, serving trays, candle sconces, while from wood, Smith carved detailed display samples of classic cottage antiques.  1930s  In the early 1930s, Smith developed an ‚Äúantique\\" style of painting. Utilizing oil glaze over gessoed hard board, he scratched and scraped the surface of wet paint to create highlights. Still lifes featured antique props set up in his studio. Landscapes depicted simple farmhouses and cottages in rural Cape Cod. Smith limited his palette to basic earth tones, avoiding overuse of white, with dashes of red or viridian applied sparingly. Smith completed the antique feel of his paintings by setting them in distressed frames. Smith continued to refine his \\"antique\\" style and apply it to the Social Realism movement in the later 1930s. Cultural artifacts of the era populate his paintings: telephone poles, storefronts, jalopies, fishing draggers, and catboats describe scores of paintings that he produced while employed by the FAP. From his FAP tour of Alaska, Smith's work features the re-occurring motif of modern man's herculean, but puny efforts to tame the vast Alaskan wilderness. His paintings and drawings are replete with boats, wharfs, automobiles, seaplanes, and dredges placed against backgrounds of towering mountains and wild rivers.  Postwar  Released from the troubles of the war, Smith was reinvigorated with artistic activity. Beginning with ‚ÄúV-J Day‚Äù and through a succession of oil paintings, Smith's works became populated with the citizenry of Orleans. Scenes of square dancing, mending nets, trick-or-treating, raising roof-beams, deer hunting, sunbathing, and picnics celebrated the vibrant character of small town America. His palette broadened, while his compositions became more playful with ever-increasing abstraction and differing perspectives. Boats, fish nets, beach umbrellas, and musical instruments took on cubist arrangements. As noted by artist and Professor of Art History Tony Ververs, \\"Smith used a personal adaption of a cubist idiom, much as did Lassell or Knaths... a common practice among early abstractionists.\\" By the early 1950s, Smith began to carve stylized birds and whales. This led to a major new direction for Smith. Abstract motifs from his paintings appeared on flat wood panels, carved in bas-relief. \\"The Sea,‚Äù a depiction of a half-veiled female figure floating in a liquid cosmos, is an early example of his new technique. Other panels combine ubiquitous spirals with clusters of shorebirds, or diving whales. Smith carved in deep-silhouette and accented the depth with a tight color palette. Human mythologies appeared as well; as in ‚ÄúLeda,‚Äù where the graceful arc of a swan's neck arrives at a woman's nipple. Again, Tony Vevers: \\"the adoption of a new technique and medium gave Smith a sense of freedom; the rather hesitant abstraction of his earlier paintings become a major theme in his new work.\\" Wood carved panels became Smith's principal form of expression until the end of his career. Smith executed a number of church commissions. He carved crucifixes of simple piety, and created panels based on the meditations of St. Augustine. He interpreted the Stations of the Cross for a Jesuit College and revisited the Church of the Holy Spirit, carving a set of doors depicting the Holy Spirit as a dove. In the late 1950s, Smith produced a series of carvings of ancient alphabets and alchemy symbols. Influenced by his friendships with John Hay, Clare Leighton, Harry Holl, and Betty Lane, Smith's work shifted toward conservation and naturalist education in the early 1960s. Cell forms, starbursts, and extraterrestrial craters appeared in his carvings. ‚ÄúGrasshopper,‚Äù with a micro view from the grasses, was created the same year as ‚ÄúCosmos,‚Äù a macro view through a telescope.  New Mexico and Carmel  From his travels in the 1960s, Smith expanded on his motifs.

This inscription mentions the rule of Svamisa Mahak·π£atrapasya ≈öodasasa (from the beginning of the second line): \\"Of the Lord and Great Satrap ≈öodƒÅsa\\". Kankali Tila (also Kankali mound or Jaini mound) is a mound located at Mathura in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. The name of the mound is derived from a modern temple of Hindu goddess Kankali. The famous Jain stupa was excavated here in 1890-91 by Alois Anton F√ºhrer (Dr. F√ºhrer). The mound almost rectangular in shape is 500 feet long by 350 feet broad. Kankali Tila brought forth many treasures of Jain art. The archaeological findings testifies the existence of two Jain temples and stupas. Numerous Jain sculptures, Ayagapattas (tablet of homage), pillars, crossbeams and lintels were found during archaeological excavations. Some of the sculptures are provided with inscriptions that report on the contemporary society and organization of the Jain community. Most sculptures could be dated from the 2nd century BC to the 12th century CE, thus representing a continuous period of about 14 centuries during which Jainism flourished at Mathura. These sculptures are now housed in the Lucknow State Museum and in the Mathura Museum.  Excavation  General view of the excavations in January 1889 at Kankali Tila, Mathura Alexander Cunningham worked at the western end in March and November 1871. The objects found by Mr. Cunningham were all Jain, with the exception of one ten-armed Brahmanical figure. Mr. Growse operated on the northern portion in 1875. In Volume XVII of the \\"Reports\\" (page 111), Mr. Cunningham noted that in the season of 1881-82 he dug up many Jain figures, including one inscribed with the name of Vardhamana, the last of the 24 Jain Tirthankara. Dr. Burgess and Dr. Fuhrer extended the excavations to the eastern end at different times from 1887 to 1896. Mr. Harding, a predecessor of Mr. Growse as Magistrate of Mathura, also made some excavations. The excavations at Kankali Tila acted as a testimony to the claims made by Jains regarding the great antiquity of their religion.  Significance  The sculptures and the inscriptions found at Kankali Tila suggest that in that period a clear Digambar-Shwetabar division had not risen. The Tirthankar images are all unclothed and monks are represented as not wearing a loincloth, but with cloth on one forearm. The names of divisions of the monastic orders match exactly with those given in the Shwetambar Kalpasutra.The Jaina Stupa at Mathura: Art and Icons, Renuka Porwal, Prachya Vidyapeeth, Shajapur, 2016  Gallery  1st Jain Tirthankara Rishabhanatha - Circa 8th Century CE - Barsana - ACCN 18-1504 - Government Museum - Mathura 2013-02-23 5082.JPG1st Jain Tirthankara Rishabhanathaswami (Circa 8th Century CE) Barsana Government Museum Mathura Mahaveer.jpgA quadruple Jain Image Four Fold Jain Image with Suparshvanath and Three Other Tirthankaras - Circa 1st Century CE - ACCN 00-B-67 - Government Museum - Mathura 2013-02-24 6023.JPGQuadruple Jain Image, excavated from Kankali Tila, c. 1st century CE Jain Tablet Homage Set- up by Vasu the Daughter of Courtesan Lavana Sobhika - Circa 1st Century CE - Kankali Mound - ACCN 00-Q-7 - Government Museum - Mathura 2013-02-24 5988.JPGJain Tablet Homage Set-up by Vasu the daughter of Courtesan Lavana Sobhika - Circa 1st Century CE - Kankali Mound (ACCN 00-Q-7 - Government Museum, Mathura) Jain Tablet Homage Set-up by Vasu the Daughter of Courtesan Lavana Sobhika - Circa 1st Century CE - Kankali Mound - ACCN 00-Q-7 - Government Museum - Mathura 2013-02-24 5989.JPGDescription of the tablet Zina in Meditation - Kushan Period - ACCN 00-863 - Government Museum - Mathura 2013-02-24 5978.JPGJina in meditation Rishabhanatha - First Jain Tirthankara - Circa 5th Century CE - Kankali Mound - ACCN 00-B-6 - Government Museum - Mathura 2013-02-23 5402.JPGIdol of Rishabhanatha, first Jain Tirthankara, excavated from Kankali Mound (Government Museum - Mathura) File:Quadruple Jain Images.jpgThree Quadruple images of Tirthankar excavated from Kankali Tila, c. 42 BCE(V.S. 15) File:Jain images (Kankali Tila).jpgImages of Tirthankar Mahavira excavated from Kankali Tila File:Colossal Head of Jina - Gupta Period - Kankali Mound - ACCN 00-B-61 - Government Museum - Mathura 2013-02-23 5454.JPGColossal Head of Jineshvara (Gupta Period) Jain Images and Stupa - Bronze - Modern Period - Government Museum - Mathura 2013-02-24 6582.JPGJain Images and Stupa - Bronze - Modern Period.

It was formed in mid-August, 1941 and deployed on the southwest approaches to Moscow. Partly encircled and destroyed by German Second Panzer Army in the opening stages of Operation Typhoon, enough of the army escaped that it could be reinforced to successfully defend the city of Tula in November. It was at this time that the 50th came under the command of Lt. Gen. Ivan Boldin, who continued in command until February, 1945. During most of its career the army was relatively small and accordingly served in secondary roles. It finished the war in East Prussia, under the command of Lt. Gen. Fyodor Ozerov, as part of 3rd Belorussian Front. Formation The Army became active on August 16, 1941, along the Desna River as part of the newly-forming Bryansk Front. The Army's first commander, Major General Mikhail Petrov, issued his Combat Order No. 1 on that date. In it, he recorded the composition of the 50th Army as follows: * 217th Rifle Division * 258th Rifle Division * 260th Rifle Division * 269th Rifle Division * 279th Rifle Division * 280th Rifle Division * 55th Cavalry Division * Artillery regiments of 2nd and 20th Rifle Corps * 753rd and 761st Antitank Regiments * 86th Separate Antiaircraft Battalion * 10th Separate Armored Car Battalion * 5th Separate Sapper BattalionDavid M. Glantz, Barbarossa Derailed, Vol. 2, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2012, p 71 Except for the 217th which formed in late June, all of these rifle divisions had formed in July, as few as four weeks earlier.Walter S. Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys to Victory, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2007, pp 71, 75‚Äì6 Bryansk Front was under the command of Gen. Andrey Yeryomenko. During the balance of August and most of September he ordered his forces, including the relatively fresh 50th Army, into repeated clashes with the German XLVII Motorized Corps over its possession of a bridgehead over the Desna anchored on the towns of Pochep and Pogar. This was also an attempt to disrupt 2nd Panzer Army as it prepared to strike southwards towards Kiev.Glantz, Barbarossa Derailed, Vol. 2, ch. 3 and 4 These operations had little effect on the German forces and also severely weakened the Front just as it was to face its greatest test. As of September 30, strength returns for 50th Army showed 61,503 personnel, 780 guns and mortars (of which 149 were antitank guns), but only 7 tanks.Glantz, Barbarossa Derailed, Vol. 2, p 573 It was still one of the stronger armies before Moscow, but not so strong as it had been when formed.Glantz & Jonathan House, When Titans Clashed, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 1995, p 89 Operation Typhoon On September 30, 1941, the 2nd Panzer Army launched Operation Typhoon in the 50th Army's sector. On the third day it had penetrated the weak 13th Army and a day later reached Oryol. The 50th Army was bypassed, as was Yeryomenko's headquarters.Glantz & House, p 80 On October 2, Major I. Shabalin, the head of the army's political section, wrote: On October 7, Major General Petrov was given temporary command of Bryansk Front after Yeryomenko was wounded.Michael Jones, The Retreat, John Murray (Publishers), London, 2009, pp 38, 46 Major General Arkady Yermakov, who had been leading an operational group within the Front, took up command of 50th Army until late November.Glantz & House, p 337n16 The pocketed forces were split in two when 17th Panzer Division and 167th Infantry Division linked up on October 10, with 50th Army in the northern pocket, but the eastern perimeter was only very lightly held so the army was never completely cut off from the main front. On that date, General Weichs, commander of German 2nd Army, reported that \\"a strong part of the Red Fiftieth Army... could not be prevented from escaping.\\" General Guderian of the 2nd Panzer Army further reported that his forces were committed to containing breakouts from the southern pocket and had nothing available to help with the northern one. The 50th was able to fall back beyond Bryansk without catastrophic losses.David Stahel, Operation Typhoon, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 2013, pp 118‚Äì19, 158‚Äì59 Defense of Tula By late October 50th Army had fallen back towards the city of Tula and partly repaired its strength. Three extremely depleted divisions, the 293rd, 413th and 239th, arrived from the front, each with between 500 and 1,000 men, who were exhausted and with little equipment. Within two months these divisions had been refitted and reinforced to authorized strength.Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys to Victory, p 90 With the disruption of Bryansk Front, 50th Army was reassigned to Western Front. Army Group Center's supplies had been barely adequate for the encirclement phases of Typhoon, and as the autumn rains turned the roads to mud, Guderian was forced to postpone his drive on Tula until October 23. The town of Chern fell on the 25th, leaving another 95 km to Tula. A battlegroup, forcing its way up the one available highway, got within 5 km of the city on October 29 and tried to take it off the march, but the defenders were prepared and drove the panzers off with strong antitank and antiaircraft fire. 50th Army was in a much better position for supplies, with munitions coming directly from Tula's factories.Stahel, pp 257‚Äì58 In mid- November General Yermakov came under investigation by the Special Department of the NKVD led by Viktor Abakumov, and was accused of dereliction of duty during the Bryansk encirclement. He was tried in secret and executed.Glantz, Colossus Reborn, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2005, pp 681-82n82 In late November Lieutenant General Ivan Boldin was summoned to Moscow and offered command of the army to direct the continued defense of this crucial city. Boldin was a popular hero for having led a group of 1,650 men back from the frontier to Soviet lines near Smolensk during July and early August. He had been acting as deputy commander of Western Front until being wounded in another breakout in October. Boldin later admitted that defending the city against Guderian was a challenging task to undertake. But although Tula was deeply outflanked by the beginning of December, it never fell. In conjunction with 10th Army, the 50th Army went on the offensive and drove Guderian's forces back from the southern approaches to Moscow.Glantz, \\"Ivan Vasilievich Boldin\\", in Stalin's Generals, ed. Harold Shukman, Orion Books, Ltd., London, 1993, pp 49‚Äì50 In the initial phase, elements of the 50th overran one battalion of the elite Grossdeutschland Regiment.Glantz & House, p 89 Winter Offensive and 1942 In December, more divisions were added to the army: four rifle divisions, three cavalry divisions, a depleted tank division, and independent tank regiments. The rapid reconstruction of this army was probably typical of many others in this period. On January 8, 1942 50th Army launched the second phase of the Moscow counteroffensive with a surprise attack on German positions southeast of Tula. On the 18th, Boldin introduced an army mobile group to the battle, which tore through the sagging German defenses and liberated the city of Kaluga. Boldin received much credit for this, which he shared with other commanders and the 1st Guards Cavalry Corps which led the group. Following this, the 50th pressed westward as part of the Rzhev-Vyasma Offensive, making repeated and increasingly futile efforts to cut the Smolensk ‚Äì Moscow highway and encircle Army Group Center. On April 14 the Army attacked to try to join up with the encircled Group Belov, and at one point only 2 km remained between the two forces, but the next day German counterattacks forced it to fall back.Svetlana Gerasimova, The Rzhev Slaughterhouse, ed. & trans. S. Britton, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2013, pp. 47-48 As the Army weakened through attrition and the German forces regained their balance, Boldin showed his frustration in numerous after-action reports. On April 22 he reported angrily to his superiors that he was being slowed down by lack of ammunition, due to poor road conditions for wheeled transport: \\"As an extreme measure, in some units the troops are carrying supplies by hand.\\" He was also driven to distraction by the total lack of air support. In these conditions the offensive ground to a halt.Glantz, in Stalin's Generals, pp 50‚Äì51 During the balance of 1942 and into early 1943 the 50th, reduced to just four rifle divisions and a few supporting units, manned the defenses southwest of Moscow. It played a very limited role in the Third Rzhev‚ÄìSychevka Offensive Operation, liberating a small sector at the base of the Rzhev Salient as the Germans withdrew. Attacking on the left wing of the Front's shock force, it pivoted towards Miliatino and confronted the German 4th Army's XII Corps, which held strong defenses north of Spas-Demensk: In reality, directives from STAVKA on March 18 ordered Western Front to make a concerted effort to smash the new German line, in spite of its obvious strength. The effort failed at the cost of heavy Soviet casualties.Glantz, After Stalingrad, p 333 Operation Kutuzov On July 1, 1943, the 50th Army was still in Western Front, at the northern base of the Oryol Salient. Its order of battle was as follows. In 38th Rifle Corps: * 17th Rifle Division * 326th Rifle Division * 413th Rifle Division Independent divisions: * 49th Rifle Division * 64th Rifle Division * 212th Rifle Division * 324th Rifle Division Other units: * 196th Tank Brigade * 1536th Heavy SU Regiment * 21st and 43rd Armored Train Battalions * 447th, 523rd, 1091st Cannon Regiments * 600th Antitank Regiment * 541st, 542nd Mortar Regiments * 54th Guards Mortar Regiment * 1275th, 1482nd, 1483rd Antiaircraft Regiments * 307th, 309th Separate Sapper Battalionshttp://www.cgsc.edu/CARL/nafziger/943RGCC.PDF , pp 29‚Äì30 Following the Soviet victory at the Battle of Kursk, STAVKA began developing its first summer offensive, beginning with Operation Kutuzov against the vulnerable salient centered at Oryol. 50th Army was given a supporting role, both due to its relatively small size and STAVKA's limited faith in Boldin's military capabilities. In this operation the army formed a right flank guard for 11th Guards Army as it attacked to cut off the salient. German 9th Army escaped encirclement, but Boldin's army managed a 50 km advance before the advance stalled.Glantz, in Stalin's Generals, p 51 Following this, the army was reassigned back to Bryansk Front. Renewing the offensive, Boldin's forces made two secret re-groupings before striking the weak left flank of the German position south of Kirov on September 8, unhinging their line and forcing them to abandon Bryansk on the 17th. In Soviet accounts it is Gen. M.M. Popov, the Front commander, who gets most of the credit for this success. By September 27, 50th Army had seized a bridgehead across the Sozh River, and it was on this date that Popov met at the Kremlin with Stalin, Deputy Chief of the General Staff A.I. Antonov, and Gen. K.K. Rokossovsky, commander of Belorussian Front (later renamed 1st Belorussian Front). As a result of this meeting 50th Army was handed over to the latter Front in the first week of October.Dr. Boris Sokolov, Marshal K.K. Rokossovsky, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2015, p 273 In keeping with its secondary role, during the balance of October and November, during the Gomel-Rechitsa Offensive Operation, the army was twice ordered to make diversionary attacks. Rokossovsky wrote in his memoirs: During the spring of 1944, 50th Army was reinforced with the 8th SU Brigade of SU-76 self-propelled guns, backing up the rifle divisions in their limited assaults until being withdrawn into front reserves prior to the summer offensive. Also during the spring the army had the occasional support of the similarly-armed 1444th SU Regiment; in July this regiment would join the army for the duration.Charles C. Sharp, \\"Red Hammers\\", Soviet Self-Propelled Artillery and Lend Lease Armor 1941 - 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, vol. XII, Nafziger, 1998, pp 18, 67 By April the army had been reassigned once again, to 2nd Belorussian Front. Operation Bagration When the Soviet summer offensive began on June 22, 1944, the composition of 50th Army was as follows. 19th Rifle Corps, with: * 324th Rifle Division * 362nd Rifle Division 38th Rifle Corps, with: * 110th Rifle Division * 139th Rifle Division * 385th Rifle Division 121st Rifle Corps, with: * 238th Rifle Division * 380th Rifle Division Independent division: * 307th Rifle Division Other units: * 4th Antitank Brigade and 1321st Antitank Regiment * 1819th and 1830th SU Regiments * 1484 Antiaircraft Regiment * 1099 Corps Artillery Regiment * 481 Heavy Mortar RegimentDunn, Jr., Soviet Blitzkrieg, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2008, p 164 2nd Belorussian Front played a secondary role in Bagration, mainly holding German 4th Army in place on both sides of the River Dnieper. 50th Army was spread over a 75 km sector. On the first day a company-sized attack on the German 31st Infantry Division was made at Golovenchitsky, but this had little impact. On the third morning, the 121st Rifle Corps joined 49th Army in a massive attack on 337th Infantry and Feldherrnhalle Panzergrenadier Divisions which opened a gap in the XXXIX Panzer Corps line by noon as the 337th disintegrated. On the same day, 19th Rifle Corps made a partial penetration at Ludchitsa, while a 10 km advance was made at Podsely. On June 25 the army hit the north flank of 31st Infantry and took Chausy. By evening the Germans were ordered to retreat to the Resta River.Dunn, Jr., Soviet Blitzkrieg, pp 165‚Äì68 On the following day the objective was to reach the Dniepr north of Mogilev, but 50th Army stalled at Chausy. South of the city, 121st and 38th Corps threw the 12th and 31st Infantry Divisions out of prepared positions and reached the east bank of the river by 2200 hours. On the 27th, as the river was being crossed both north and south of Mogilev, 121st Corps, plus two divisions of 49th Army with armored support, struck the northwest suburbs, street fighting with 12th Infantry during the night. The German stronghold fell the next day, but at considerable cost to both armies, which Boldin would be criticized for. Other elements of these armies broke through the west bank defenses, advancing rapidly to the Drut River.Dunn, Jr., Soviet Blitzkrieg, pp 170‚Äì72 With 4th Army effectively smashed, 50th Army was left to take part in the destruction of its remnants east of Minsk. On July 8 the army's forward (mobile) detachment, which included the 1434th SU Regiment (SU-85s), liberated the Belorussian town of Novogrudok.Sharp, p 64 In the following days and weeks the advance became slower and more grueling, across the Neman River through Grodno, to the approaches to East Prussia, arriving there in late August.Glantz, in Stalin's Generals, p 52 On July 15, Boldin was promoted to the rank of Colonel General. In November, Rokossovsky was moved to the command of 2nd Belorussian Front, and Boldin once again came under his orders. East Prussian Offensive At the beginning of 1945, just prior to the start of the winter offensive, the order of battle of 50th Army was as follows. 69th Rifle Corps, with: * 110th Rifle Division * 324th Rifle Division * 191st Rifle Division * 153rd Rifle Division 81st Rifle Corps, with: * 343rd Rifle Division Independent divisions: * 2nd Rifle Division * 307th Rifle Division * 330th Rifle Division * 369th Rifle Division Other units: * 91st Fortified Region * 153rd Fortified Region * 161st Fortified RegionCombat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1945, p 13 The East Prussian operation began on January 14, 1945. 2nd Belorussian Front made relatively slow progress at first, but gained speed with the introduction of tank forces and improving weather. 50th Army was set to keep an eye on the German forces defending along the August√≥w Canal. All but a small rearguard of those slipped away to battle the Front's main forces and it was 48 hours before Boldin noticed, all the while reporting that the full force was still in place. Rokossovsky had seen enough, and in February, just as the army was being transferred to 3rd Belorussian Front, Boldin was given a kick upstairs, and his chief of staff, Lieutenant General Fyodor Ozerov, took command for the duration.Sokolov, pp 376, 380 Beginning on April 6, the army formed the right flank of the Soviet forces in the assault on K√∂nigsberg. One corps was to hold the line while two corps with a total of six rifle divisions took part in the attack. 50th Army was reinforced with artillery, 65 tanks and 42 heavy self-propelled guns (ISU-122 and ISU-152), and one assault engineer-sapper brigade. On the first day the army's units had advanced up to two kilometres, capturing a fort west of Baydritten and clearing 39 city blocks. On the 7th an additional 1.5 ‚Äì 2 km penetration was made, helping to force the German garrison back to their second position. On the 8th the army, closely cooperating along its right flank with the 43rd Army, captured the Palfe area. The German forces capitulated late in the day on the 9th, and on the 10th the remaining pockets of resistance were eliminated.Soviet General Staff, Prelude to Berlin, ed. and trans. Richard W.

Early life and education Allan was born Catherine Mabel Joyce Allan on 8 April 1896 in Balmain, Sydney. She was the eighth child of Florence Fountain Allan n√©e Hesketh and Joseph Stuart Allan. Allan's education was initially private but she went on to attend Fort Street Girls' High School. During her time at secondary school she often visited the Australian Museum and would sort shells for Charles Hedley. Career Allan examining specimens at the Australian Museum Allan was appointed as a temporary employee at the Australia Museum in February 1917 and worked as an assistant to Charles Hedley. She was initially responsible for assisting with the curation of the conchology collection as well as providing illustrations for scientific papers written by other museum staff. Allan was a talented artist and exhibited artwork with the Royal Art Society of New South Wales. As time progressed she gained more expertise in molluscs and began writing scientific articles. She signed both her artwork and her scientific papers \\"Joyce K. Allan\\". Most of her published papers were related to the subclass Opisthobranchia. New Zealand Mollusca by Joyce K. Allan In 1920 Allan obtained a permanent position at the museum, and upon the resignation of Hedley in 1924, was responsible for the Australia Museums's conchology section with Tom Iredale as her assistant. In 1925 Allan and Iredale's positions were reversed. In addition to writing scientific papers on molluscs, Allan wrote articles in the Australian Museum Magazine and contributed to the Australian Encyclopaedia. She also undertook speaking engagements. Allan frequently appeared as the subject of articles in newspaper and magazines, not only as a result of being a woman scientist, but also because of her talent at science communication. In 1931 Allan was appointed to the position of scientific assistant. During the Second World War she worked in the National Emergency Services and was appointed assistant to the superintendent of air-raid precautions. In 1943 Allan was elected a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society of New South Wales, and in doing so became the first woman to achieve this honour. In 1944 she returned to the Australia Museum and, upon the retirement of Iredale, was chosen to succeed him. In early 1949 Allan was appointed curator of shells for the Museum and while holding that position attended gatherings of the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science. In 1949 she also attended the Pacific Science Congress in New Zealand and in 1953 travelled to Copenhagen to attend the International Congress of Zoology. In 1950 Allan authored Australian Shells, the first book to attempt to describe the majority of Australian molluscs. It was well regarded by both the scientific community and mollusc collectors. Allan retired from her position at the Museum of Australia in June 1956 as a result of suffering from ill health. However she was appointed an honorary zoologist and as such continued to work on a voluntary basis at the museum. She also authored further scientific texts. It was not until 1962 that she ceased working in any capacity at the museum. Personal life On 18 May 1949 Allan married Hector Walker Kirkpatrick in St Clement's Anglican Church, Mosman. Death Allan died on 31 August 1966 aged 70 at Mosman, of cerebrovascular disease. She was survived by her husband and was cremated. Selected publications * 1936.

It is an arts focus school in the Portland Public School District. The building was originally used as a high school, Girls Polytechnic High School, which was renamed James Monroe High School in 1967 and closed in fall 1978, when its student body was merged with, and moved to, Washington High School.  History  The building that now houses da Vinci Arts Middle School was designed in the classical revival style of architecture by the architect George Howell Jones, who designed almost all of the schools in the Portland public school district between 1908 and 1932, along with Floyd Naramore. This school opened in 1928 as Girls Polytechnic High School. Before the construction of this building, the Girls Polytechnic program had been held at the Portland High School, which was deemed unfit in 1928. It remained the Girls Polytechnic until 1967, when it was renamed James Monroe High School, for president James Monroe, and was opened to boys. In 1993, parents of students at Buckman Arts Magnet Elementary School formed a proposal for an arts focused middle school. The district finally accepted the proposal, and the school opened in 1996 with 140 students and a very small staff. It was not until 1998 that the school had a full-time principal, and there was no counselor until 2000. So far, da Vinci had been a program and had shared the building with other programs, but in July 2003 the school board changed da Vinci's status into a school, and it has remained a school since then. Due to concerns about mathematics and science test scores being too low, da Vinci's schedule was changed in fall 2016 to allow for increased class time in the those classes. Students protested against these changes, because it would mean students would no longer have the same teacher for language arts and social studies for all three years at middle school. Also, sixth graders would be in separate classes from the rest of the school in all subjects except art. By doing that, the new schedule might disrupt the sense of community that the core classes had. The schedule change went into effect in September 2015.  Curriculum  The art gallery at da Vinci Arts Middle School, displaying student artwork Da Vinci Arts Middle School is an arts magnet school. Its mission statement states that it \\"will seek innovative ways to integrate the arts throughout the curriculum, provide focused arts instruction, and create a rich, inquiry-based learning environment with high standards of academic excellence\\". To fulfill its mission, it offers students two electives of 2D art, 3D art, creative writing, dance, music or drama.  Extracurricular activities  The school has many after school programs, such the Destino dance team, a rock band known as Trogdor, a Black Student Union, a Queer-Straight Alliance, a ukulele choir, a jazz ensemble and a chess club. The school has put on numerous plays, as well as three student-written rock operas. There is also a coding club.

It is a wrap with hard sugar (candy and coconut) inside white wafer slice.Wenweipo (2010, October 9) È¶ôÊ∏ØÂú∞ÈÅìÊú¨ÂúüÂ∞è It was especially famous in Hong Kong during the 1940s and 50s. The most popular fillings included shredded coconut, maltose and sesame. History There are several folktales about how traditional candy and coconut wrap first appeared in China.  Monarchy period In the monarchy period, elder members of a family would offer pancakes flavored with sugar as sacrifices to Confucius when their children reached school age. Those pancakes were flavored with syrups shaped like scallion, thus they were named as candy and coconut wrap (Tang Cong Bing). The elder generation gave those pancakes to their children to eat after offering them to Confucius for blessings. As the Chinese pronunciation of ‚Äúscallion‚Äù is the same as ‚Äúclever‚Äù (‚Äòcong‚Äô), it symbolizes that their children would become cleverer after eating those pancakes. The candy and coconut wrap is still famous in China as an inexpensive snack.  Cold Food Festival  At some point between the Spring and Autumn Period and the early Han, veneration of the 7th-century- Jin noble Jie Zhitui as an immortal developed into the Cold Food Festival, when fire was avoided for up to a month around midwinter. This later moved to the Qingming solar term and became modern China's Tomb Sweeping Festival. Thin wraps around molded syrups shaped like scallions became popular in Chaoshan and developed into the candy and coconut wrap..  Qing Dynasty  Some said the coconut candy has emerged since Qing dynasty.Mani, L. (2012, March 8). Foodies' NotesÔºöË≤∑Â∞ëË¶ãÂ∞ëÁ≥ñËë±È§Ö It is believed that the traditional coconut candy came from the period of Japanese occupation of Taiwan. At that time, the Japanese government required the all Taiwanese to ship the Taiwan sucrose to Japan. The local sucrose factory staff did not want to do so. Therefore, they turned all the sucrose into coconut candy to mislead the Japanese army. After that, the coconut candy was widely spread all around the world and some people wrapped it with wafer slide as a snack, which became the traditional candy and coconut wrap. Preparation To produce the traditional candy and coconut wraps, wafer slices, coconut flakes, sugar, water, cake flour are needed.Tweety, T. (2008, April 7). Á≥ñËî•Ë£Ω‰Ωú First is to make the candy and coconut. Add white sugar to water, stir it and boil it until 120 degrees to make a syrup. Then pour the syrup into a bowl of cold water and cool it for a while. Use a round stick to drag the cooled syrup up and down for 10 minutes. Fill it with air to form the small tubes, then cool it again. Cut the cooled syrup into strips of 3 inches long, and add peanut powder; the candy and coconut is done.ÂçóÊñπÁΩëÊóÖÊ∏∏. Â∞ÜÂ§±‰º†ÁöÑÊΩÆÊ±ïÁæéÈ£üÔºöÁ≥ñËë±ËñÑÈ•ºÔºå‰Ω†ÂêÉËøáÂêó Next, is the wraps. Add water to cake flour, stir it and pour it onto a hot pan, take it up in 10 seconds. Pour black sesame powder and put the coconut candy on the pancake. Wrap it into a roll, then the coconut candy wrap is done. Present situation Compared to the past, there is no significant change on the package of the wraps, the wraps are still kept in the transparent plastic box for sale.Linh N.(2013). Hong Kong: Traditional Candy and Coconut Wrap In the recent decade, the traditional candy and coconut wraps are seldom found on the streets, few elderly hawkers holding the metal box with wraps can be seen. Also, The Hawker Control Team of the Food and Environmental Department enforces the law strictly against unlicensed hawking activities.Florence, Y. (2006, January 12). Street Eats. Yet, the price of the wraps is usually below HKD$10. The complex craftsmanship of making the wrap and low profit make it hard for the peddlers to sustain the business. Therefore, only few who can master the craft remains. The traditional candy and coconut wrap can still be found in some places like Sheung Shui Railway Station from time to time. It also appears at the flower market during the Lunar New Year as a kind of Hong Kong nostalgic snacks. People today not only treat the wrap as a kind of snacks, but also a yearning for the old days.

First tested in late 2010 and officially launched in early 2011, MTA Bus Time was installed in all MTA bus routes in New York City by 2014. The software uses Global Positioning System (GPS) technology equipped in buses to relay real-time location information to passengers via internet-enabled devices (particularly smartphones), SMS messages, or countdown clocks installed at bus stops. Since 1996, the MTA had tried to install positioning technology for buses through numerous pilot programs, which were implemented in various stages. Usage and software MTA Bus Time allows riders to track the location of buses along a route. On computer browsers, the service uses Google Maps to display bus routes and the position of buses along routes, by typing in a route (e.g. ) or intersection into the search box. It will also give the distance (in number of stops or miles) and approximate time away from the next stop for each bus. For web-enabled mobile devices, typing in a route will display the list of stops along the route and the position of buses along it. Typing in an intersection will give a list of buses operating to that stop and the approximate time for the next bus to reach the stop. Intersection information can also be found by scanning the QR code for a stop, or texting the stop's numerical code to receive information via SMS; both codes are found on the Guide-A-Ride box affixed to bus stop signage.See: Bus Time is also integrated into countdown clocks installed at several bus stops throughout the city, displaying how many stops away the next bus is, to serve riders without internet devices or mobile phones. The current Bus Time system uses on-board GPS and wireless communication units, at the cost of about $20,000 per vehicle. For most buses, the console is equipped behind the driver's seat.See: The hardware is provided by two companies, Verifone and Cubic Transportation Systems, with GPS devices supplied by Trimble Navigation, and open source software called OneBusAway. The Verifone system is the successor to a pilot \\"Smart Card\\" payment system developed along with MasterCard. Cambridge Systematics was also involved in the development. The MTA uses the same servers as Amazon.com. The technology is similar to the technology used for countdown clocks found in the New York City Subway system (called Subway Time). Bus Time is also used by the MTA to create performance reports for bus routes, and by bus dispatchers and managers to monitor and improve service. This technology is called Bus Trek. History A Select Bus Service wayfinding countdown clock, part of WalkNYC, during the debut of the in 2015 The mass transit system of New York City did not have any sort of arrival-time information system prior to the installation of the first subway and bus countdown clocks in the 2000s. Many other major cities (such as London, Paris, and Washington, D.C.) had used the technology for many years; several American cities such as Chicago, San Francisco, and Portland, Oregon, have also had bus-tracking systems prior to MTA implementation. In 1979, the MTA tested a radio-based monitoring system on the buses from the Queens Village Depot, called the \\"Radio-Data-Locator System\\" and designed by Motorola. The buses automatically communicated their location to the East New York Bus Command Center in East New York, Brooklyn, every 90 seconds. The system was used to improve bus performance and prevent bus bunching, but was not accessible to the public.See:  In 1996, the MTA's New York City Transit Authority (NYCT) contracted Orbital Sciences Corporation to design a bus-arrival monitoring system, planned to be installed on 170 city buses by 1998. The routes on which it would be implemented were the and , which operated out of the 126th Street Depot in Manhattan. In 1997, the MTA awarded a second contract to Orbital to install a tracking system on the Long Island Bus system (now the independent Nassau Inter-County Express). An additional contract was awarded in 1999 for the MTA's Access-A-Ride paratransit service. The system would have included countdown clocks and interactive kiosks at stops, and recorded \\"next stop\\" announcements on buses (similar to that of modern subway cars and the still-used Clever Devices system used on the ex-MTA Long Island Bus/NICE Bus units). NYCT Buses would be monitored at the East New York Depot control center, and Long Island buses at a command center in Garden City. After four years, the company had missed most of its deadlines. The technology, meanwhile, was faulty because the skyscrapers in Manhattan blocked signals and the dead reckoning system had failed. The NYCT contract was terminated by the MTA in 2000. In 1999, the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) planned to launch a tracking and countdown clock program on the route (then privately operated under a DOT subsidy by Green Bus Lines) along Queens Boulevard. The DOT planned to put it in operation by 2002. In summer 2005, a $13 million contract was awarded by the MTA to Siemens for a pilot countdown clock program at fifteen stops along the same six bus routes in Manhattan of the previous NYCT program. This project also experienced delays, with the first countdown clocks operational by October 2007. After issues with arrival time accuracy, the clocks were shut down in February 2008, and MTA pulled out of the program in early 2009. In August 2009, countdown clocks were installed at eight stops for the and crosstown buses along 34th Street in Midtown Manhattan. These clocks were installed at the top of the Cemusa bus shelters at the stops by Long Island-based Clever Devices, which provided the GPS equipment free of charge. The clocks were praised by The New York Times as a \\"Miracle on 34th Street,\\" a play on the famous film of the same name.See: Around this time, many new Orion VII NG buses delivered to the MTA were equipped with AVL consoles built by Clever Devices. On October 14, 2010, the first version of the Bus Time web service, also developed by Clever Devices, was launched along the route using the same GPS system. Following the transition of the two routes into the M34 and M34A Select Bus Service in late 2011, the countdown clocks were removed by the contractor in April 2012, and were replaced with the current Bus Time system. The pilot route for the most recent iteration of MTA Bus Time was the in Brooklyn, where thirty buses were equipped with the technology in February 2011. By January 2012, every local and express bus in Staten Island was equipped with the system. The M34/M34A SBS began using the system on April 6, 2012, with nearly every Bronx bus route using the system by the end of 2012. All five boroughs of the city used the system by March 2014, and a mobile app was released in 2015.

They are best known for the song \\"Night of the Sadist\\", which has been revived on several compilation albums. History In October 1962, Rocky Shores (drums) recruited Larry Roquemore (saxophone, vocals) and Larry Slater (lead guitar) to perform at a Halloween party, with Slater bringing along rhythm guitarist Tommy Skaggs. Originally, the group's set list included mostly surf music instrumentals inspired by Freddie King, whom the band held a strong admiration for. Following their first gig, Slater and Roquemore began rehearsals in new drummer Mike Griffins' garage, also accompanied by Dan Fletcher (bass guitar) and rhythm guitarist Buddy Bates. In 1964, after establishing themselves as top-tier competitors in battle of the bands tourneys in Fort Worth, Larry and the Blue Notes replaced Fletcher with Randy Cates and recruited Jack Hammonds (organ, vocals). The new members had some prior experience as vocalists, providing the group with enough expertise to replicate the lush vocal harmonies of the Beatles. Larry and the Blue Notes became fixtures at Fort Worth's most popular venue, the Teen A-Go-Go. In 1965, the band attracted the attention of record producer Major Bill Smith, who is best known for his hand in recording national hits such as \\"Hey Paula\\" by Paul and Paula. The group entered the studio to cut the Roquemore and Slater-penned \\"Night of the Sadist\\", recording two versions: one with a saxophone instrumental and another which featured a guitar solo. However, neither version was released because Smith, concerned with the word \\"sadist\\" potentially barring airplay, had Larry and the Blue Notes dub \\"phantom\\" in place wherever the term occurred. Roquemore explains that several urban legends inspired the tune, including \\"the escaped mental patient with a hook on his right hand who used to terrorize parkers in Lover's Lane; a guy dressed in a gorilla suit who used to tap on car windows of couples parking late at night at my old school, Northside High; and tales of a Goat Man who was scaring the crap out of parkers at Lake Worth\\". \\"Night of the Phantom\\" was released on Larry and the Blue Notes' debut single in early 1965 on Tiris Records. The resulting regional hit prompted 20th Century Records to negotiate for publishing rights, making \\"Night of the Phantom\\" one of the few releases from the Fort Worth teen scene to reach a national audience. A follow up, \\"Talk About Love,\\" appeared in late-1965 on the Charay label, but did not fare as well on the regional charts until a punkish version was released in its place. Afterwards, Larry and the Blue Notes would release some of their records under different band names such as with the single \\"The Phantom,\\" but under the pseudonym, the Mark V, of a song conceived by local deejay Mark Stevens as an identifier for the \\"Phantom.\\" Other singles by the group were released as the Bad and later as Soul Purpose when soul music became popular. In 1966 the band released a single, once again as Larry and the Blue Notes, the pounding \\"In and Out\\" b/w \\"There's No Other Like My Baby\\" on Charay. The label would re-release the song again as a single several times over the next year with alternating flipsides. The band would break up in 1968. In the intervening years since Larry and the Blue Notes' disbandment, their song \\"Night of the Sadist\\" (or \\"Night of the Phantom\\") has appeared on several compilation albums. The \\"Night of the Sadist\\" version appears on Back from the Grave, Volume 4, Acid Dreams - Epitaph, Fort Worth Teen Scene, Volume 1, and Acid Dreams (2014 version). As for \\"Night of the Phantom\\", the song is compiled on Back from the Grave, Volume 1, Fort Worth Teen Scene - Major Bill Tapes, Volume 2, and Fort Worth Teen Scene, Volume 2. Their protopunk anthem \\"In and Out\\" has become one of their most highly regarded songs over the years and has appeared on Teenage Shutdown! The World Ain't Round, It's Square!, Fort Worth Teen Scene, Volume 1, and Fort Worth Teen Scene, Volume 3.

Their approach was highly influenced by the British Invasion popularized by bands such as the Beatles and the Rolling Stones but was also informed by the folk rock and soul sounds coming out of America during the period. Drummer Frank Bua would later go on, years later, to play with the popular roots rock and funk group, the Radiators. History The Palace Guards were formed in Metairie, Louisiana, a suburb of New Orleans, in 1966. Their original lineup consisted of Les Gray on vocals, Glenn Acomb and Jeff Miller on guitars, Richie Faber on bass, and Frank Bua on drums. They became one of the better- known of dozens of local garage bands along with the Gaunga Dyns, Dr. Spec's Optical Illusion, the Better Half-Dozen, the Glory Rhodes and others. They were regular fixtures at clubs such as the Beaconette, which would hold frequent battles of the bands. Guitarist Camile Baudoin played with the Souls of the Slain who were also regulars there, and he and drummer Frank Bua years later would go on to play in the Radiators. Their first single, \\"Better Things to Do\\" b/w \\"Sorry,\\" was released in 1966 on Frank Udoe's local U-DOE Records label and both sides received airplay on local radio stations. The band would record four more singles with the label. In 1967 the band decided to bring in Ray Morant on piano and organ and Doug Davis on 12-string guitar, augmenting their sound with soul-influenced approach, yet retaining a Byrds-influenced folk rock sound. That year they released \\"No Comin' Back\\" b/w \\"Barbara\\" on the White Cliffs label (also owned by Udoe) followed by \\"Gas Station Boogaloo Downtown\\" b/w \\"Looking Everywhere\\" in 1968. Faber and Acomb departed in 1968. The group's final roster would retain Bua, Morant, and Miller, but add new bassist Bobby Fonseca. The band continued performing for more than another year, releasing one more single \\"Gas Station Boogaloo Downtown\\" b/w \\"Looking Everywhere\\" on Udoe's Rae label, but finally broke up in 1970. In the late 1970s drummer Frank Bua and guitarist Camile Baudoin (previously of the Souls of the Slain) joined the Radiators, and would enjoy many years of success with the popular roots rock and funk act. Gear Fab Records released the group's entire recorded output, including both sides of all five singles and additional unreleased and alternate tracks, as the single disc The Palace Guards in 2007.

She has served as director of the Yukon Geological Survey (since January 2008), project geologist with the Government of the Northwest Territories, chief geologist with Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada, federal co-manager of the Northwest Territories' Geoscience Office, director of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources for Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, as well as adjunct professor at the University of Alberta.  Career  Relf's early career life began in Yellowknife, North West Territories, in 1981. She initially started out in working as a surveying geologist. There were other women in the field, however she was the only female on her specific crew. Through networking, Relf eventually landed a role as the Director of Yukon Geological Surveying. She is currently still in this role, and supports a number of other surveyors within her department. Throughout her time in Yellowknife, Relf attended a conference with several of her University of Queens peers within the surveying industry, in which offered training and preparation for future careers in geology. For Relf, this type of hands on experience was invaluable, and one of the most effective ways to gain knowledge of geology, based on her own personal experiences. Through their many successful field expeditions, Relf's team acquired recognition from the federal government of Canada, and received grant funding for developing university curriculum in the field of geological science. This brought Relf to Edmonton, as the University of Alberta was often a jumping off point for geological workings in the Yukon, being that it is the closest metropolis city to Yellowknife. The University of Alberta had a large stake in the geological projects occurring in Yellowknife and much of its research on campus was based on the field of the North West Territory. The U of A was looking to broaden its scope on research and geological analysis, so they reached out to Relf's team to bring their field work within the NWT to the University for the purpose of better educating students on geological survey methods. Every fall, Relf's team would bring 4-6 chosen students to join them in their field surveys, to produce geological maps of areas within the NWT. Teaching became a passion of Relf's, and her fieldwork with university students became her legacy. She did her last year of field training in 2007, after 7 years of teaching at the U of A. Although Relf was often in a minority role, as a female within the field of geology, she affirms that over the course of the 7 graduating classes that she taught throughout her time at the University of Alberta, all of which were an even distribution of men and women. Relf does not believe the field of geology to be male dominated, from her own personal experience, however international fields do tend to have more male dominance in leads of international expeditions. Considering the strenuous 3‚Äì4 months field expeditions, it's a wonder there are as many women in the field as there are. At the height of her career, Relf currently has an even mapping crew of 3-3 male to female geologists. Her survey crew is actually 3-1 female dominated, and her mineral crew is 4-1 male dominated, a fairly even distribution overall.  Education  Relf's high school teacher John Reid, a working geologist, was her first memory of exposure to the field of geology. Reid took Relf's entire high school class on a 5-day geological field trip, which inspired her to pursue further education in the field of Geology. When Relf graduated high school, she moved from Mississauga, Ontario to Kingston, Ontario to attend (Queen's University, 1984). She did her undergrad degree in Geology and would later do her masters in Newfoundland, a master's degree in geochemistry and mineral chemistry (Memorial University of Newfoundland, 1988), and a Ph.D. in structural geology, metamorphic petrology, and Archean tectonics (Queen's University, 1992). also in the field of geology. Upon graduation, Relf returned to Kingston to embark on a new career with the NATMAP organization (a national mapping organization). Within this organization, she was offered the opportunity to further her education, and began pursuing a PhD at the Queens University.  Personal life  Dr. Caroyln Relf grew up in the suburbs of Mississauga, Ontario with 3 other siblings (David, Heather and Robert). Her father was a high school science teacher, having obtained his degree in chemistry. Relf is married to a geologist; they have a daughter.

It is a dimensionless quantity that is invariant under similarity transformations of the curve, and that can be used to measure how far the curve is from being a convex curve.. If the curve is parameterized by its arc length, the total absolute curvature can be expressed by the formula :\\\\int \\\\kappa(s) ds, where is the arc length parameter and is the curvature. This is almost the same as the formula for the total curvature, but differs in using the absolute value instead of the signed curvature.. See in particular section 21.1, \\"Rotation index and total curvature of a curve\\", pp. 359‚Äì360. Because the total curvature of a simple closed curve in the Euclidean plane is always exactly 2, the total absolute curvature is also always at least 2. It is exactly 2 for a convex curve, and greater than 2 whenever the curve has any non-convexities. When a smooth simple closed curve undergoes the curve- shortening flow, its total absolute curvature decreases monotonically until the curve becomes convex, after which its total absolute curvature remains fixed at 2 until the curve collapses to a point... The total absolute curvature may also be defined for curves in three-dimensional Euclidean space. Again, it is at least 2, but may be larger. If a space curve is surrounded by a sphere, the total absolute curvature of the sphere equals the expected value of the central projection of the curve onto a plane tangent to a random point of the sphere.. According to the Fary‚ÄìMilnor theorem, every nontrivial smooth knot must have total absolute curvature greater than 4.

It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 2001. History The chapel was a given to the city of Muscatine by a local businessman and philanthropist, Peter Musser, as a gift in memory of his wife Tamson. It was designed by Muscatine architect Henry W. Zeidler, who also designed Hotel Tipton in Tipton, Iowa,NRHP and built by J.E. Howe who was also from Muscatine. The chapel was dedicated on May 12, 1901. Musser also donated the statue of Hope that was placed near the entrance of the chapel. He commissioned Becke and Wilson, a Muscatine marble works company, to create the statue in 1902. A second tower was added to the structure in 1912. Architecture The Richardsonian Romanesque chapel is composed of two wings that are connected by a porte-cochere. It features a rough-faced asymmetrical facade, recessed windows, alternating bands of brick and stone, high gabled roofs, and wide arches located over the windows and doors.

It replaced the Gewehr 98 rifles purchased from Germany after the Treaty of Versailles. The rifles were quickly replaced by the shorter Vz. 24, and were sold to various other nations, most notably Iran and Turkey, where they remained in service to World War II era and beyond. Inception When Czechoslovakia was founded in 1918, they immediately began planning to establish and arm their own military. In 1922, it was chosen to build a derivative of the Mexican Mauser 1912. It was known as the Vz. 98/22. The Czechoslovak military was particularly picky about the quality of their new service rifles, and only adopted a small number of them into their own military service. Such Czech service rifles were stamped with a E-22, or E-23 stamp. (The - being a stand in for the Czechoslovak lion typical of Czech military proof markings) The rifles that were not adopted were sold in commission to either Iran, Turkey, or on the public market. Decommission The Vz. 98/22 was quickly replaced by the lighter, and easier to handle Vz. 24, and the remaining vz. 98/22 rifles were either sold to Iran, Turkey, or on the public market. Most of the public sales were still to Iran or Turkey, but some were sold to the Republic of China to supplement other Mauser type rifles. In China, these rifles were used during the Warlord Era, the Chinese Civil War and the Korean War. World War II Most of these rifles did not see official service in World War II. However, they remained in service in China into the 1950s and Kurdistan rebels still used it in the 2010s. Markings Top of the receiver, showing the curved BRNO stamp Many 98/22 rifles displayed a slight curved stamp on the receiver, displaying the words \\"ƒåS.ST/ZBROJOVKA/BRNO\\", translating roughly into \\"Czechoslovak Armory of Brno.\\" The later models of this rifle has the same text displayed without the curve to the text. If the rifle was adopted into Czechoslovak service, it will have a E-22 or E-23 mark, usually on the side of the receiver, just above the serial number. These rifles, as with any Czechoslovak rifle, will have a (Z) stamp on most metal pieces of the rifle. Some Turkish models have Turkish markings in addition to Czech markings but other only have Czech markings. Turkish models will also often have sights in Ottoman Turkish numerals or Arabic numerals. Chinese models often have ideograms on the stock. Iranian models will always retain the Persian numerals on the sights.

It is mostly in use for soft tissue medical imaging, especially breast imaging.  Description  Measurement procedure of a 3D USCT: semi-spherical water filled measurement container lined with ultrasound transducer arrays in cylindrical housings (transducer elements as green dots). Centrally placed a simple object (red). Spherical wave emitted (semi-transparent blue), all other transducers gather data. Wave-front interacts with object and re-emits a secondary wave (semi-transparent purple). Repeated iteratively for all transducers. Ultrasound computer tomographs use ultrasound waves for creating images. In the first measurement step a defined ultrasound wave is generated with typically Piezoelectric ultrasound transducers, transmitted in direction of the measurement object and received with other or the same ultrasound transducers. While traversing and interacting with the object the ultrasound wave is changed by the object and carries now information about the object. After being recorded the information from the modulated waves can be extracted and used to create an image of the object in a second step. Unlike X-ray or other physical properties which provide typically only one information, ultrasound provides multiple information of the object for imaging: the attenuation the wave's sound pressure experiences indicate on the object's attenuation coefficient, the time-of-flight of the wave gives speed of sound information, and the scattered wave indicates on the echogenicity of the object (e.g. refraction index, surface morphology, etc.). Unlike conventional ultrasound sonography, which uses phased array technology for beamforming, most USCT systems utilize unfocused spherical waves for imaging. Most USCT systems aiming for 3D-imaging, either by synthesizing (\\"stacking\\") 2D images or by full 3D aperture setups. Another aim is quantitative imaging instead of only qualitative imaging. The idea of Ultrasound computer tomography goes back to the 1950s with analogue compounding setups,Acta Neurochirurgica, Springer Verlag Wien, Volume 2, Numbers 3-4, September 1952, 379 - 401.Ultrasound Mosaicing and Motion Modeling - Applications in Medical Image Registration Christian Wachinger, PhD Thesis, TU M√ºnchen (2011) in the mid 1970s the first \\"computed\\" USCT systems were built up, utilizing digital technology. The \\"computer\\" in the USCT concept indicates the heavy reliance on computational intensive advanced digital signal processing, image reconstruction and image processing algorithms for imaging. Successfully realization of USCT systems in the last decades was possible through the continuously growing availability of computing power and data bandwidth provided by the digital revolution.  Setup  USCT systems designed for medical imaging of soft tissue typically aim for resolution in order of centimeters to millimeters and require therefore ultrasound waves in the order of mega-hertz frequency. This requires typically water as low-attenuating transmission medium between ultrasound transducers and object to retain suitable sound pressures. USCT systems share with the common tomography the fundamental architectural similarity that the aperture, the active imaging elements, surround the object. For the distribution of ultrasound transducers around the measurement object, forming the aperture, multiple design approaches exist. There exist mono-, bi- and multistatic setups of transducer configurations. Common are 1D- or 2D- linear arrays of ultrasound transducers acting as emitters on one side of the object, on the opposing side of the object a similar array acting as receiver is placed, forming a parallel setup. Sometimes accompanied with the additional ability to be moved to gather more information from additional angles. While cost efficient to build the main disadvantage of such an setup is the limited ability (or inability) of gathering reflectivity information, as such an aperture is limited to only transmission information. Another aperture approach is a ring of transducers,Transducer elements position calibration in a ring array USCT system Satoshi Tamano ; Takashi Azuma ; Haruka Imoto ; Shu Takagi ; Shin-ichiro Umemura ; Yoichiro Matsumoto, Proc. SPIE 9419, Medical Imaging 2015: Ultrasonic Imaging and Tomography, 94190P (March 17, 2015); doi:10.1117/12.2082323 sometimes with the degree of freedom of motorized lifting for gathering additional information over the height for 3D imaging (\\"stacking\\"). Full 3D setups, with no inherent need for aperture movements, exist in form of apertures formed by semi-spherical distributed transducers. While the most expensive setup they offer the advantage of nearly-uniform data, gathered from many directions. Also, they are fast in data taking as they don't require time-costly mechanical movements.  Imaging methods and algorithms  Tomographic reconstruction methods used in USCT systems for transmission information based imaging are classical inverse radon transform and fourier slice theorem and derived algorithms (cone beam etc.). As advanced alternative also ART-based approaches are utilized. For high resolution and speckle noise reduced reflectivity imaging Synthetic Aperture Focusing Techniques (SAFT), similar to radar's SAR and sonar's SAS, are widely used. Iterative wave equation inversion approaches as imaging method coming from the seismology are under academic research, but usage for real world applications is due to the enormous computational and memory burden still a challenge.Ultrasound Imaging Methods for Breast Cancer Detection Technische Universiteit Delft, 13 November 2014, Neslihan Ozmen  Application and usage  Many USCT systems are designed for soft tissue imaging and for breast cancer diagnosis specifically. As ultrasound based method with low sound pressures, USCT is a harmless and risk-free imaging method, suitable for periodical screening. As USCT setups are fixed or motor moved without direct contact with the breast the reproduction of images is easier as with common, manually guided methods (e.g. Breast ultrasound) which rely on the individual examiners performance and experience. In comparison with conventional screening methods like mammography, USCT systems offer potentially an increased specificity for breast cancer detection, as multiple breast cancer characteristic properties are imaged at the same time: speed-of-sound, attenuation and morphology.

This section discusses how Hispanic activists of the day sought to have Hispanics classified as White Americans.Shircliffe, p. 605-606. Specifically chapter 1 discusses the Hispanic community prior to World War II, and chapter 2 discusses Mexican children in the schools and how they were affected by educational policies. Chapter 3 discusses efforts from Hispanic individuals to reform the school system.Rosales, p. 87. Chapter 4 documents debates on how to reform the education system that took place within the Hispanic community.Rosales, p. 88. Part two describes the campaign for the Hispanic community to be recognized as a non-white minority, rather than white, in regards to a Houston Independent School District (HISD) desegregation plan.Shircliffe, p. 606. In its initial 1970 desegregation plan,Quiroz, p. 228. HISD was trying to \\"desegregate\\" by mixing black and Mexican students together while not including Anglo Whites in the desegregation plan, and using the Mexican students' designation as \\"white\\" as a workaround.Alamillo, p. 220. Mexicans responded by launching a strike, or huelga, against HISD. Part three goes into detail regarding movements to classify Mexican-Americans as being a part of the racial minority groups. The book discusses the efforts of the Mexican American Educational Council (MAEC), an organization fighting HISD's original desegregation program, to be recognized by HISD and the court system.Alamillo, p. 221. Jos√© M. Alamillo of Washington State University wrote that \\"[o]ne of the most important contributions\\" of this book was saying that men and women of varying social classes and ages were central to the Chicano movement, rather than Carlos Mu√±oz's statements saying that students were central to the movement. Rodolfo Rosales of the University of Texas at San Antonio described chapters 5-7, which discuss the Mexican community's implementation of the school reform movement, as the \\"heart of the narrative\\". Background San Miguel previously wrote Let All of Them Take Heed\\": Mexican Americans and the Campaign for Educational Equality in Texas, 1910-1981, described by Thomas H. Kreneck of Texas A&M; University-Corpus Christi as \\"an important history of Mexican American educational reform in the Lone Star State\\".Kreneck, p. 704. San Miguel encountered information on the huelgas while researching the history of Houston's education system and decided to write a book about the subject. San Miguel used information from the Houston Metropolitan Research Center for this book. Reception Alamillo wrote that the book \\"contributes significantly to the history of Chicano movement and school desegregation in the American West\\" and he recommended that teachers, community activists, and officials in school systems read the book. He argued that the author should have more fully explored racial conflicts between blacks and Hispanics. Barbara J. Shircliffe of the University of South Florida wrote that the author \\"greatly contributes to our understanding of the influence of the Chicano movement on local school activism among a broad group of Mexican Americans during the period.\\"Shircliffe, p. 608. She suggested that the author could have added more information regarding Mexican-Black relations, especially regarding local politics and educational politics.Shircliffe, p. 607. Gilbert G.

Two Marksville law enforcement officers, Derrick Stafford and Norris Greenhouse Jr., were arrested on charges of second-degree murder and attempted second-degree murder as a result of the incident. The evidence from a police body-worn video camera was cited as being contributory to the speed of the arrests.  Background  Marksville is a small city with a population of 5,702 at the 2010 census, characterized by familiar relationships and interactions between locals. The city had a series of running conflicts between Mayor John Lemoine and several city officials over budgets. The conflicts reportedly started soon after Lemoine took office in 2009, when he called for several audits of the city court and recommended that the city council lower the budget, including the salary of Marksville Marshal (equivalent to a police chief in other jurisdictions) Floyd Voinche. Citizens have described the politics as \\"particularly intense and personal\\". Lemoine was also reportedly in conflict with the Marksville Police Department, which had three different chiefs during Lemoine's five years in office. About three months prior to the shooting incident, Voinche's office hired several local police officers to work part-time in street patrols and purchased two used Ford Crown Victoria police vehicles for their use. The street patrols involved mostly making traffic stops and issuing citations. Before that, the local marshal office's jurisdiction had been limited to serving court papers. According to Lemoine, speaking after the shooting occurred, Voinche did not consult with the city about this expansion of his operations, including the hiring of full-time police officers. Lemoine had written at least one letter to the office of Louisiana Attorney General Buddy Caldwell, questioning the legal authority of Voinche's actions. Because state statute gives marshals the authority to enforce the law within their respective jurisdictions, street patrols and issuing tickets were considered to be encompassed in this authority.  Shooting incident  On the night of November 3, 2015, officers Derrick Stafford and Norris Greenhouse of the Marksville Marshal's Office attempted to stop a vehicle driven by Christopher Few. He had his son Jeremy Mardis with him in the front seat. After he and his fianc√©e Megan Dixon had an argument at a bar that evening, they had driven away in separate vehicles. She said that she saw him pass her, followed by a marked police car with two officers. After Greenhouse and Stafford activated the patrol car lights Few failed to pull over, resulting in a two-mile car chase. At some point Greenhouse and Stafford called for backup, and two other officers responded. They ended the chase on a dead-end street by the entrance to the Marksville State Historic Site at the corner of Martin Luther King Drive and Taensas Street. One of the responding officers used his body camera to record the confrontation. Greenhouse and Stafford allegedly fired eighteen rounds of ammunition into Few's vehicle at approximately 9:30 p.m. Few was struck twice, in the head and chest, despite having his hands in the air, according to police body-camera footage. Mardis was hit by five bullets, also struck in the head and chest. He was initially thought to have died instantly, according to the coroner for Avoyelles Parish. However, it is now known that six-year-old Mardis was alive for an additional seven minutes while lying in his father's truck.  Police officers involved  Three of the four involved officers worked both as police officers and as marshals. While in most of Louisiana marshals are authorized only to serve legal documents such as arrest warrants, in Marksville, deputy marshals were empowered earlier in 2015 to make discretionary arrests, \\"preserve the peace\\", and issue traffic tickets.  Officers who fired the shots  Norris Greenhouse Jr., 23, and Derrick Stafford, 32, were officers with the Marksville Police Department. Greenhouse was a reserve officer with Marksville and served as a deputy marshal for the nearby Alexandria City Marshal's Office; he had been on the force for one year. Stafford was a lieutenant and shift supervisor for the Marksville Police Department, and an eight-year veteran of that Department. He was \\"moonlighting\\" as a deputy marshal at the time of the shooting. That night, Greenhouse and Stafford were working side jobs for the city marshal's office. They were two of several officers hired by the Marksville Marshal's Office about three months prior to the shooting. At the time of the shooting, Greenhouse, Stafford and Marksville Police Chief Elster Smith, Jr., were the subjects of a federal civil suit for use of force. Stafford was the subject of five civil suits in Avoyelles Parish; Greenhouse was named in one of these. In addition, Stafford had been indicted in 2011 by Rapides Parish on two counts of aggravated rape but the charges were dropped in 2012.  Responding officers  Lieutenant Jason Brouillette, a 13-year veteran of the Marksville Police Department, and Sergeant Kenneth Parnell, a five-year veteran, responded to the backup call made by Greenhouse and Stafford. Parnell was wearing a body camera, which recorded at least part of the incident. Brouillette and Parnell were placed on administrative leave following the incident. Investigators do not believe either of them fired their weapons.  Victims = Christopher Few  Christopher Few moved from Mississippi to the Marksville area in April 2014 to work as an apprentice riverboat captain and to be closer to his relatives. He was listed in critical condition on November 3. A family spokesperson said that bullet fragments remained in Few's brain and lung. His condition improved to serious by the following morning. As of November 9, Few was hospitalized in Alexandria, Louisiana, where his condition had been upgraded to fair. He was released from the hospital on November 13. Few and Mardis shared a home with Few's mother prior to the shooting. Body-cam footage reportedly shows Few had his hands up when he was shot.  Jeremy Mardis  Jeremy David Mardis ( 2009 ‚Äì November 3, 2015) was diagnosed with autism at the age of two. At the time of the shooting, he was in the first grade and attended Lafargue Elementary School in Effie, Louisiana. He had moved with his father to Louisiana from Mississippi the year before. Mardis' mother Katie Mardis, and his sister, still live in Mississippi. Christopher Few's fianc√©e Dixon described Mardis as an affectionate and intelligent child, and said that Mardis did speak. Mardis and Few shared a home with Few's mother prior to the shooting. Mardis was in the front seat of Few's vehicle and wearing a seatbelt when they were shot. He was pronounced dead at the scene. A funeral for Mardis was held on November 9 at Moore Funeral Services in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, where his mother and sister live. He was buried in Beaumont Cemetery. His father was still hospitalized and unable to attend. Investigation and prosecution Charles Riddle, the district attorney for Avoyelles Parish, recused himself from the case because Officer Greenhouse's father is an assistant district attorney in his office. The office of the attorney general of Louisiana prosecuted the cases of Greenhouse and Stafford. Greenhouse and Stafford surrendered to police on the evening of November 6, and they were charged with second-degree murder and second-degree attempted murder. They were transferred on November 9 from a jail in Avoyelles Parish to Rapides Parish Detention Center #3 because, as the police said, the latter facility is \\"better equipped to isolate [Greenhouse and Stafford] from the general population\\". It is standard procedure to separate ex-law-enforcement inmates from non-law-enforcement inmates when they are incarcerated.  Investigation  Colonel Mike Edmonson of the Louisiana State Police began an investigation into the shooting. He said that the body-camera video recorded by one of the responding officers was essential to the officers being arrested. Other contributory evidence included interviews with the cooperating officers, 9-1-1 recordings, and unspecified forensic evidence. Legal analysts cited by The Advocate newspaper of Baton Rouge, Louisiana also attributed the arrests to the body- camera footage. Ballistics tests showed that of the four responding officers, only Greenhouse and Stafford fired their weapons. Although initial news reports said there was a warrant for Few's arrest prior to or after the shooting, the state police have said this was not true. In addition, Edmonson said that there was no evidence of a firearm inside Few's vehicle. The Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, as well as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Office of the United States Attorney, are participating in the investigation. Few's fianc√©e Megan Dixon said that the police pursuit of Few may have been prompted by his running a red light or by the officers seeing an altercation she had with Few at a traffic light, when he approached her car and they had words. One police vehicle reportedly received damage caused by Few reversing into it. Dixon also said that Few had encountered Greenhouse a month before the shooting. He threatened to hurt Greenhouse after the officer contacted Dixon, a former high school classmate, and went to the home she shared with Few. She said Few told Greenhouse, \\"Don't come to my home again, or I'll hurt you\\".  Gag order  Judge William Bennett of the Louisiana 12th Judicial District Court was assigned to the case and presided over the bail hearing on November 9. He issued a gag order that day, forbidding all parties, including police, victims, and witnesses, from discussing the case with the press. Media outlets had requested the Louisiana State Police to release public records with information about the case, but these requests were denied as a result of the judge's order.  Bail hearing and bond posting  A description of the body-cam video's contents was presented as evidence during the bail hearings, but the video was not shown. Bail was set at for each officer. On November 24, Greenhouse's family posted bond and he was released. Stafford posted bail and was released in March; both men were under house arrest.  Trial dates  Stafford's trial began on March 13, 2017; Greenhouse's trial date was set for June 12, 2017. The judge had postponed these dates in order to allow the defense time to prepare, including for their use of expert witnesses.  Outcome  The juryMax Lindsey, \\"Jury selection begins for Derrick Stafford murder trial\\", KALB, 13 March 2017; accessed 13 March 2017 found Stafford guilty of manslaughter and attempted manslaughter. Stafford was sentenced to forty years in prison, half of which would be served \\"without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence.\\" On September 29, 2017, Greenhouse pleaded guilty to negligent homicide and malfeasance in office. He was sentenced to five years for the negligent homicide charge and two years for the malfeasance in office. Sources stated that Few's family agreed to the terms of the plea deal. The attorney general's prosecutor cited differences in the actions of the two officers as the reason for the extreme differences in their sentences. Norris Greenhouse Jr was released from prison as of July 3, 2019, after serving only 21 months (25%) of a seven-year sentence. Greenhouse is the son of longtime Avoyelles Parish assistant district attorney Norris Greenhouse Sr., who passed away July 1, 2019.https://newsmaven.io/pinacnews/cops-in-cuffs/cop-who-killed-6-year- old-boy-released-from-prison-after-serving- only-21-months-L9-dpSEHvEabWrMucWCnlQ  References  2015 deaths 2015 in Louisiana 2015 controversies in the United States Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana Child deaths Deaths by firearm in Louisiana Filmed killings by law enforcement Law enforcement controversies in the United States Law enforcement in Louisiana Incidents of violence against boys Murder in Louisiana People shot dead by law enforcement officers in the United States Police brutality in the United States November 2015 events in the United States Violence against children People murdered by law enforcement officers in the United States Murdered American children Marksville, Louisiana ","title":"Shooting of Jeremy Mardis"},{"id":"48503347","text":"Water betony may refer to: *Scrophularia umbrosa, a species of plant *Shargacucullia scrophulariae, a species of moth ","title":"Water betony"},{"id":"48503369","text":"Get Mean, also known as Beat a Dead Horse, Vengeance of the Barbarians and The Stranger Gets Mean, is a 1975 Italian-American Spaghetti Western fantasy comedy film directed by Ferdinando Baldi and starring Tony Anthony, Lloyd Battista, Raf Baldassarre, Diana Lorys and Mirta Miller.

The group was founded by Masa Fukuda in 2001 after he composed the song \\"It Just Takes Love\\" for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah. He asked students to help make a commemorative CD for the Olympics. Some of the students also were \\"children of light\\" performers for the Olympics, whom he volunteered to help train. After the Olympics, 25 students wanted to continue singing together, and Fukuda formed the choir as a nonprofit organization to continue working with them. One Voice is led by director Fukuda and has 140 members ages 4‚Äì17. Every year, the choir performs around 50 to 70 times. The group meets year-round for once-a-week practices. They perform a vast selection of music such as pop music, gospel music, classical music, Broadway musical, and patriotic songs. In 2003, the choir sang the Christmas song \\"Innocence of Youth\\" and won the John Lennon International Music Award after singing in a competition for Yoko Ono. In 2014, One Voice received national attention for their rendition of the Disney song \\"Let It Go\\", starring Lexi Walker and Alex Boy√©. Their video received 1 million views in one day, 18 million in 10 days, and over 60 million by July 2015. They were invited to compete in the ninth season of America's Got Talent (AGT) in 2014 and reached the quarterfinals. History=Early history: 2002 Winter Olympics Brigham Young University student. Masa Fukuda. heard about a contest for nearby composers to write music for sale as soundtracks during the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah. He and Jeannine Lasky wrote the song \\"It Just Takes Love\\" on an impulse, not expecting to win because he felt that others like Kurt Bestor and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir were far better than he. In 2001, Fukuda and Gael Shults enlisted the aid of 1,621 students from 69 elementary schools in the Alpine, Nebo, and Provo school districts, to make a commemorative CD, \\"Light Up the Land. He sent the song to the organizers, and his song was selected among other songs for the Olympic CD and received two Pearl Awards. Some of the students who volunteered to sing for the CD were \\"children of light\\" for the Olympics' Open Ceremony and Closing Ceremony. Fukuda offered to train and supervise the students during Olympic events. Their group was the 2002 Winter Olympic Children's Choir. After the Olympics were over, the student performers had formed strong friendships, and about 25 of them told Fukuda they hoped to keep performing with each other. By September 2003, the group grew to 130 members. In a 2015 interview with the Deseret News, Fukuda said, \\"We had performed a lot together, so we decided to do it.\\" Fukuda and Shults served as the choir's co-directors. Originally called the 2002 Winter Olympic Children's Choir, by 2003, the group was called Studio A Children's Choir. In 2005, the choir was renamed One Voice Children's Choir. It became a nonprofit organization and has an advisory board. According to The Salt Lake Tribunes David Burger, Fukuda's aim is \\"to create a nurturing, tolerant environment with high standards and a commitment to singing uplifting songs\\". John Lennon International Music Award Around 2003, Fukuda's nonagenarian grandmother visited an Osaka, Japan, store and noticed a poster that had John Lennon's photo. His grandmother brought it to her son, wondering whether Fukuda would want to participate in the music contest. Fukuda created a CD with several songs and sent it to the contest organizers who chose his Christmas song, \\"Innocence of Youth\\", as a finalist. They invited Fukuda, singer Jay Williams, and 12 members of the Studio A Children's Choir (a precursor to One Voice) to sing the song in Japan. Given a nine-day notice, they hurriedly raised money and obtained passports for the trip. The group won the grand prize, the John Lennon International Music Award, which was presented by Lennon's wife, Yoko Ono. In 2005, One Voice performed at a Christmas concert hosted by Lex de Azevedo. The same year, members flew to Japan to perform at the Hiroshima Flower Festival, where they performed songs in five languages: English, Japanese, Tongan, and Spanish. \\"Let It Go\\" and America's Got Talent In 2014, the choir received national attention after releasing their performance of the Disney song \\"Let It Go\\". Their cover starred Lexi Walker, who at the time was 11 years old, and Alex Boy√©. Filmed at Ice Castles in Midway, Utah, the video received 1 million views in one day and 18 million in 10 days. The video was played on YouTube over 60 million times by July 2015 and received YouTube Spotlight's \\"Best Pop Cover\\" in 2014 award. Times Joseph C. Lin called One Voice's rendition the best cover of Let It Go. One Voice was asked to audition for the ninth season of AGT in 2014. 100 members of the choir, including Walker, auditioned on June 22, 2014, singing Ellie Goulding's \\"Burn\\". Judges Howard Stern and Heidi Klum praised their performance, voting yes, while judges Mel B and Howie Mandel were less impressed. Mandel voted no, and Stern convinced Mel B to vote yes. They performed on live television for the show's quarterfinals on August 19, 2014, at Radio City Music Hall in New York City and were eliminated. In a 2017 interview with The Salt Lake Tribune, Fukuda said, \\"You don't see us in competitions ‚Ä¶ usually\\". The choir was convinced to perform on AGT because the show paid for their traveling expenses and gave each child a per diem to cover the cost of watching a Broadway show. Members and performances Composed of children ages 4‚Äì18, One Voice at the beginning had practices in Fukuda's apartment where he would set up 45 folding chairs in his living room. In the past, the group had practices once a week throughout the year. Because of the choir's size and the geographical distribution of its members, some of whom commuted from Wyoming and Idaho, it changed to having two practices a week. The two practices are held in both Utah and Salt Lake counties. Members can attend the more accessible practice. One Voice has roughly 55 to 70 performances yearly. The choir has made several Christmas and Easter CDs and is posting more of its recordings to YouTube. According to a 2015 article in the Deseret News, the 140-member One Voice has biannual auditions, in January and August, while according to a 2017 Broadway World article, the choir has auditions each May. The group does not split singers into different age groups. When boys undergo voice changes, they become tenors. In January 2015, they had a waiting list of 250 children. Sometimes, there are merely six to 10 open spots in a year. After a child has been accepted into the choir, he or she pays a $30 monthly fee and is permitted to stay in the choir until turning 18. In 2008, it was the host choir for In Harmony, an annual international children's music festival. One Voice has performed at Abravanel Hall during Bestor's annual show \\"A Kurt Bestor Christmas\\". They have performed at the Salt Palace during RootsTech. They have collaborated with David Archuleta, Jenny Oaks Baker, Sam Cardon, Peter Breinholt, Barry Manilow, Janice Kapp Perry, The Piano Guys, Jon Schmidt, Garth Smith,Garth Smith Music Preview featuring One Voice Children's Choir - Christmas 2017 Ryan Shupe, and Vocal Point. In February 2012, the first members of the choir who had participated in the Olympics performed at the 2002 Winter Games Tenth Anniversary Legacy Event. The group performs at charitable events including those hosted by Operation Smile and the Ouelessebougou Alliance. Music style and genres Fukuda directs the choir and does all the musical arrangements, writing for every song roughly six to nine segments. Fukuda told the Deseret News in 2015 that he was raised in Japan where choirs were primarily about \\"technique and preciseness\\". Noting that although \\"those are really important things\\", he wants the children to find choir enjoyable. They typically have three different parts. Once in a while, they have seven or eight, including four sopranos, two altos, a tenor, and less frequently a high soprano. The choir performs an eclectic selection of genres including pop music, gospel music, classical music, Broadway musical, and patriotic songs. They have performed songs from Rihanna, Disney, and Ellie Goulding. In a 2003 interview with The Salt Lake Tribune, Fukuda said, \\"We go anywhere from baroque and classical to R&B; and hip-hop. We're media-oriented.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Official website * America's Got Talent contestants Choirs of children Musical groups established in 2005 Musical groups from Salt Lake City 2001 establishments in Utah ","title":"One Voice Children's Choir"},{"id":"48503782","text":"Brett Godfrey (born 8 August 1963) is an Australian businessman and co-founder of Virgin Australia.

The main characters, Tom and Betsy Rath, are a young middle-class couple that share a struggle to find contentment in their hectic and material culture, while several other characters fight essentially the same battle, but for different reasons. In the end, it is a story about taking responsibility for one's own life. The novel was the basis for the popular 1956 film of the same name starring Gregory Peck and Jennifer Jones as Tom and Betsy Rath. Plot Tom and Betsy Rath live in a rundown house in Westport, Connecticut in 1953. They have three children (two girls and a boy) and money problems. Tom is 33 years old, a Harvard graduate, and works at a Manhattan charitable organization. Tom barely survived as an Army paratroop officer during World War II, having fought in both the European and Pacific combat theaters; he had an extramarital affair in Italy during the former. He has haunting flashbacks of the affair, as well as his combat experiences; he killed 17 men in combat, including an accidental killing of his friend with a hand grenade in the heat of battle. His stay-at-home wife knows only that Tom has somehow \\"changed\\" since the war. One day while reflecting on the inadequacy of his house, Tom runs into a friend who works at the United Broadcasting Corporation, a New York-based television network. This friend encourages Tom to apply for a new opening in public relations. Tom gets the job working for Ralph Hopkins, the top man at the network, an empire-builder surrounded by politicking yes-men. Hopkins is set to propose the establishment of national mental health services to a group of physicians and offer his own prestige and network toward that end. Tom must figure out how his boss can best present the proposal so that the learned doctors will rise in unison and appoint Hopkins to spearhead the campaign. Hired on a six-month probationary basis, Tom reports to a humorless game-player who rejects five different drafts of the speech and ends up substituting one of his own. Hopkins is satisfied, but Tom persuades him that the approach is all wrong, that it misrepresents Hopkins' qualifications to head the campaign. Tom's approach is more sensible and Hopkins is impressed. Additionally, Tom reminds Hopkins of his own son, who was killed in combat. In the end, Tom sees how his boss's marriage and family life have been ruined by overwork, so he turns down a high-pressure position involving travel in order to work normal hours and spend more time at home. Subplots * The fraudulent scheme of the caretaker of Tom's late grandmother, who forged a will in an attempt to inherit the deceased woman's home * Hopkins' estrangement from his daughter, who quits school to elope with an undesirable man Tom's adulterous behavior during the war resulted in a son conceived in Italy, whose mother suddenly contacts him to seek monetary support at a most inconvenient time. With no understanding of the horrors of war, Betsy becomes furious upon learning of this secret and becomes estranged from Tom. However, she comes to understand that mutual emotional support, not just mutual ambition, bind wife and husband. Themes The book deals with the ethos of the American Dream that was strong during the post-War '50s. The business suit is a symbol of that culture. The American aesthetic was that the gray flannel business suit came to represent middle-class success. A man wearing such a suit belonged to that ideal and the image of that culture. Development The book was largely autobiographical. It drew on Wilson's experiences as assistant director of the U.S. National Citizen Commission for Public Schools. The character of Ralph Hopkins, the high-ranking network executive, was based on Roy Larsen, Wilson's real-life boss at Time Inc. (which became Time Warner). Reception The novel became a bestseller. \\"Man in the gray flannel suit\\" entered the popular vernacular and the symbol has continued to appear for decades in references of sociologists to America's \\"discontented businessman\\". Columnist Bob Greene wrote much later, in 1992, that \\"[t]he title of Sloan Wilson's best-selling novel became part of the American vernacular‚Äîthe book was a ground-breaking fictional look at conformity in the executive suite, and it was a piece of writing that helped the nation's business community start to examine the effects of its perceived stodginess and sameness.\\" The book was re-issued in 2002 with a foreword by a contemporary author, Jonathan Franzen. Film The film that came out in April of the next year followed the success of the novel. Although the film became popular, critics gave it mixed reviews. Its length was sometimes brought into question but it was seen as a \\"tender and touching film\\" by The New York Times. Gregory Peck and Jennifer Jones star. The film was directed by Nunnally Johnson. The film focuses on a man coping with domestic reality after the Second World War. Variety magazine held the director responsible for \\"miss[ing] the point of the book which made the flannel suit a symbol rather than just a garment.\\" Sequel Nearly thirty years later, in 1984, Wilson released a sequel, The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit II, picking up the story just eight years after the original novel with Tom Rath's story in 1963. The plot of the sequel concerns Tom's extramarital affair with a younger woman, which leads to his subsequent divorce and remarriage, as well as the death of his son in the Vietnam War. Unlike the original novel, the sequel was neither a critical nor a commercial success.

Career Older's debut novel Half-Resurrection Blues was published by Penguin Books in the first week of 2015. By the end of January, the production company of Anika Noni Rose had optioned the television and film rights to the novels, in addition to the rights of the following two novels in the series. Also in 2015 Older published his second book, a young adult novel entitled Shadowshaper about a young Afro-Latina girl named Sierra who discovers her family's history of supernatural powers and her ability to interact with the spirit world. Older, bottom left, with other fantasy authors at a panel discussion at the 2017 New York Comic Con Until 2014, Older worked as an emergency medical technician in New York City, writing mostly at night. Older has said that he sees himself as an outsider to the publishing and literary scene, saying \\"I entered the writing work clearly and strategically to do this thing, to write these books, to get them into the world and fuck with people, and to generally fuck shit up.\\" Older has been critical of works that fail to include racial diversity. While he admires The Hunger Games series of novels, he was disappointed in the casting of the film series based on them, writing that the \\"whitewashing of Katniss was a tremendously unimaginative and useless act.\\" Older has also been critical of \\"the popular surge of YA dystopias that followed in the wake of the Hunger Games trilogy,\\" calling it \\"wildly undiverse.\\" He attributes this lack of diversity to a \\"phenomenal lack of imagination\\" on the part of the authors, and a laziness, he feels, designed to keep some people out of the picture, saying: \\"To be able to figure out all these quirky things about what you imagine the future will be like, and not somehow have any folks of color doing anything heroic or worthwhile in it, what happened?\\" In 2018 Older released his first Star Wars novel Last Shot, which serves as a tie-in to Solo: A Star Wars Story. It stars Han Solo and Lando Calrissian and takes place between Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens with flashback settings before and after Solo. World Fantasy Award Petition In August 2014, Older started a petition to change the World Fantasy Award statuette from a bust of H. P. Lovecraft to one of African- American author Octavia Butler, on account of Lovecraft's racism, and concerns that it would be disrespectful to recipients, in particular those belonging to non-white ethnicities that Lovecraft held in particular contempt. Kevin J. Maroney, editor of The New York Review of Science Fiction, also supported the call for the WFA to be changed from Lovecraft's face, suggesting it be replaced with a symbol representing the fantasy genre. Maroney argued this should be done \\"not out of disrespect for Lovecraft as a writer or as a central figure in fantasy, but as a courtesy to generations of writers whom the WFA hopes to honor.\\" In November 2015 it was announced that the World Fantasy Award trophy would no longer be modelled on H. P. Lovecraft, following the 2014 campaign that called the author out as an \\"avowed racist\\" with \\"hideous opinions\\". Older expressed delight at the news and posted on his Twitter account, \\"They just announced the World Fantasy Award will no longer be HP Lovecraft. We did it. You did it. It's done. Yessssssss,\\" Older tweeted. Older later told The Guardian newspaper by email, \\"If fantasy as a genre truly wants to embrace all of its fans, and I believe it does, we can't keep lionising a man who used literature as a weapon against entire races. Writers of color have always had to struggle with the question of how to love a genre that seems so intent on proving it doesn't love us back. We raised our voices collectively, en masse, and the World Fantasy folks heard us. Today, fantasy is a better, more inclusive, and stronger genre because of it.\\"  Bibliography = Novels  Shadowshaper Cypher series (Young Adult) = * Shadowshaper (2015) * Ghost Girl in the Corner (2016) * Dead Light March (2017) * Shadowhouse Fall (2017) * Shadowshaper Legacy (2020) https://www.fantasticfiction.com/o/daniel-jose-older/shadowshaper-legacy.htm = Bone Street Rumba series (Adult) = * Half-Resurrection Blues (2015) * Midnight Taxi Tango (2016) * Battle Hill Bolero (2017) = Dactyl Hill Squad series (Middle Grade) = * Dactyl Hill Squad (2018) * Freedom Fire (2019) = Star Wars = * Last Shot (2018) = Standalone = The Book of Lost Saints (2019)  Short fiction  Novellas = * Anyway: Angie (2014) a Bone Street Rumba novella * Kia and Gio (2015) a Bone Street Rumba novella * Ginga (2015) a Bone Street Rumba novella * Ghost Girl in the Corner (2016) a Shadowshaper novella * Dead Light March (2017) a Shadowshaper novella = Collections = * Salsa Nocturna (2012) = As editor = * Long Hidden: Speculative Fiction from the Margins of History (with Rose Fox, 2014) ReferencesExternal links 21st-century American novelists American fantasy writers American male novelists American writers of young adult literature American male short story writers Hispanic and Latino American writers Hispanic and Latino American novelists Hispanic and Latino American short story writers Living people Social justice 21st-century American short story writers 21st-century American male writers Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Daniel Jos√© Older"},{"id":"48503845","text":"Dibru College was established in 1963 situated at Boiragimoth, the heart of Dibrugarh town.

It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 4 September 2007.  History  Plaque, Original Maryborough Town Site, 2008 The Original Maryborough Town Site was occupied between 1848 and 1855, and is located about four kilometres northwest of the current city centre, on the southbank of the Mary River. It provides evidence of the early settlement of the Wide Bay district, and is unique amongst the pre-1859 towns of Queensland in that it retains most of its originally occupied town site in an open, relatively undeveloped state. The evocative, peaceful site has the archaeological potential to shed light on life in an early Queensland settlement. The free settlement of what later became the colony of Queensland commenced on the Darling Downs in 1840. In 1842, the same year that Moreton Bay was opened to free settlement, Andrew Petrie was commissioned to explore the Wide Bay district. With a group of men that included Henry Stuart Russell, the explorer, pastoralist and historian, Petrie travelled by boat to explore the Mary River (then unnamed) as a possible source of Bunya trees. The explorers travelled about upstream, and it was concluded that the area would prove suitable for sheep rearing as the river would allow wool to be transported by boat. One of the men, Captain Joliffe, was an employee of the pastoralist and businessman John Eales, who later took up a large run at Tiaro and sent Joliffe there with 16,000 sheep. Although this venture failed, due to a combination of disease, attacks by the traditional owners, and financial problems, other pastoralists soon took up runs in the area. By 1847 more than 20 license applications for runs had been lodged in the region. In July 1847 the government surveyor James Charles Burnett gave encouraging reports of the suitability of what was then known as the Wide Bay River as a location for a port to service the area. The river was then named Mary after Lady Mary Lennox, the wife of Governor Fitzroy. Ipswich publican George Furber arrived in the Wide Bay district in September 1847 to set up a wool store, shanty and wharf on the site of an abandoned outstation of Tiaro, named Girkum, in the midst of open forest on the southern bank of the Mary River. The first shipment of wool was dispatched in December 1847. However, the site was on the wrong side of the river for the sheep runs to the west, and in June 1848 Edgar Thomas Aldridge and the Palmer brothers, Richard and Henry, selected a new site on the north bank of the river, just opposite Furber's business. This site was not the best for ship access, but its closeness to Furber's site, and the fact that it was also open forest, offered some security against potential raids by the local Aboriginal people. The spread of the pastoral frontier and its associated violent disruption of traditional Aboriginal lifestyles and land use inevitably caused conflict between traditional owners and settlers. The site of Maryborough was the traditional country of the Badtjala/Butchulla people, while much the Mary River district further upstream was that of the Gubbi Gubbi/Kabi Kabi. The Palmers and Aldridge both established inns, along with wool stores and a wharf, and this settlement was known as Wide Bay. The Commissioner for Crown Lands, John Carne Bidwill, arrived in December 1848, and established a camp on a new site nearby on the southern side of the river on the banks of Tinana Creek (now the suburb of Tinana). One of Bidwill's tasks was to find a coastal overland route from Maryborough to Brisbane as an alternative to the then route through Gayndah; however, he died in 1853 without accomplishing this task. A post office was established on 23 January 1849, and the settlement then became known as Maryborough. That same year J.C Ricketts built an inn in Maryborough. Furber had also opened a liquor establishment on the north bank of the river by 1850, near the mouth of Muddy Creek, but Aldridge's \\"Bush Inn\\" did the best business of the four establishments, and he regularly supplied goods and services to the troopers of the Native Police. The presence of so much alcohol soon led to the establishment of a Court of Petty Sessions, in January 1850, with William McAdam being appointed Chief Constable. By 1850 Maryborough was well established as a commercial centre and as a port for shipping wool, hides, timber, and tallow. Boiling down unwanted sheep produced tallow, used to manufacture soap in Britain, and James D. Walker and Edmund Blucher Uhr had established boiling down plants downstream from the settlement. There were also sawpits between the inns and the river, which were used to square-off timber, including Hoop Pine (Araucaria cunninghamii) and South Queensland Kauri (Agathis robusta), for ship transport. The Maryborough to Gayndah road snaked northwards through the western side of the settlement, near the Palmer's inn. Chinese vegetable gardens were in place along the banks of Muddy Creek, just east of the settlement, and grew potatoes, turnips, leeks and cabbages. Although most settlers at Maryborough erected their buildings wherever seemed the most suitable, applications to purchase land were made to the government and, as the amount of wool being shipped from the settlement was increasing dramatically, in 1850 the government appointed a surveyor. Hugh Roland Labatt arrived in July 1850, with instructions to select a suitable site for a township, with regard to providing good conditions for a port. He came to the conclusion that the existing settlement was not the best location, and he preferred the site of Uhr's boiling down plant (now Queen's Park), where the river was deeper and would accommodate larger vessels. As the settlers contested this decision, both sites were surveyed. Maryborough was declared a township in 1851, and had a population of 299, with 142 of these being single adult males, and 24% of the total being Chinese. There were 45 timber and shingle buildings in the area, including a courthouse, church, stores, houses and various inns. The largest occupation group was that of shepherds, stockmen and labourers, followed by the occupation group of commerce, trade and manufacturing. The first blocks of the new site (near the current Queen's Park) were sold on 14 January 1852. Although many were purchased, and the buyers included Henry Palmer, Aldridge, McAdam, Uhr, and Labatt, relocation did not take place immediately, as many people were naturally reluctant to move when they had established homes and businesses at the old site. In 1855 John G. Walker launched the 75-ton schooner Blue Jacket near the mouth of Muddy (or Baddow) Creek, it being the first boat built on the Mary River. However, as trade at the port of Maryborough grew and more and larger ships called at the wharves at the new site (or East Maryborough), it became apparent that the town at West Maryborough would have to be moved. Another impetus for the last settlers to abandon the West Maryborough town site may have been the increased raids by Aboriginal people on Maryborough between 1852 and 1855. An axe thrown at him by an Aborigine during a dispute in 1847 over flour rations had wounded George Furber, and he was later accused of killing at least three Aboriginal people in the period after this event. Furber and his son- in-law Joseph Wilmshurst were in turn killed in 1855, while sawing timber next to Tinana Creek. Aldridge, once a stout defender of the old site, moved his business operations to East Maryborough in 1855. By 1856 West Maryborough was virtually abandoned. The site reverted to farming, although Aldridge and McAdam continued to live nearby. In 1883 Aldridge built Baddow House, which still stands just to the southeast of the old town site. He also cultivated extensive gardens around Baddow House and the area they once occupied extends toward the bank of Muddy Creek. Remnants of the gardens also account for some of the exotic vegetation within the regrowth in this area. The wool trade continued to prosper, and shipping increased immensely after Maryborough was proclaimed a port of entry (the Port of Maryborough) in 1859, and a municipality (the Borough of Maryborough) in 1861. In April 1861 land for agricultural purposes on the Mary River was sold, which accelerated the closer settlement process, and by the end of the 1860s thousands of free immigrants had entered Queensland through the Port of Maryborough. The trade of supplying the goldfields discovered at Gympie in 1867 also went through Maryborough. Of the early Queensland towns that existed by the time of Separation from New South Wales in 1859, only Maryborough retains most of its originally occupied town site in an open, undeveloped state. The original settlement areas of Brisbane (including at Redcliffe), Dalby, Drayton, Gayndah, Gladstone, Ipswich, Rockhampton, Toowoomba and Warwick have all been developed and are currently occupied. The site of West Maryborough is largely still undeveloped. Signs were erected in a 1988 Bicentennial project to indicate the sites of various historical structures. Although the site of McAdam's house, southeast of the intersection of George and Aldridge Streets, is now freehold land outside the heritage boundary, the locations of all the remaining buildings of the settlement, as mapped by Labatt in 1850, remain undeveloped in 2014. As indicated in a 1987 archaeological study, the river receded from its 1850s waterline, and waterholes and streams in the area silted over. The vast majority of the surface evidence of the settlement was removed or obscured by the combined effects of flooding or human intervention. The site was periodically flooded and over a metre of silt was deposited on the river terrace where Furber Street is located. Sugar cane was grown over part of the site in the early twentieth century and fossickers have also combed the area for souvenirs. In 1919 a farmhouse was moved onto the northwest end of the site (outside the Queensland heritage register boundary), near where Palmer's inn stood, but it has been since removed, along with its outbuildings. Cane farming on the pasture that lies to the northwest of the current parkland has resulted in a long mound running parallel to, and to the east of, Queen Street. A Maryborough City Council sewerage treatment plant was built near the location of Aldridge's inn, but was removed by 1987. A long thin mound running through the pasture parallel to, and to the west of, Queen Street may be related to this. The site of the plant's tank was the circular hollow between the sites of the first and second of Aldridge's inns. The stone and concrete jetty near the mouth of Muddy Creek is close to the alignment of Furber's wharf, but was built for the STP outfall pipe. The known extent of the built township extends outside the heritage register boundary. This area encompasses one-third of the buildings of the settlement, and accommodated a variety of activities - residential, commercial, administrative and pastoral. Structures within this area included Palmer's Inn, Palmer's Store, Blackman's hut, store and enclosed yard, the gaol, Emanuel Thorpe's hut and enclosed yard, and several huts. In 2007 an archaeological investigation conducted within this area revealed artefacts and features dating to the historical occupation period, including deposits of bottle glass, moulded tobacco pipes, porcelain and stoneware fragments, as well as personal items such as a brass button and a copper half penny. The lack of previous access to the historical occupation layers (due to the location of later structures, now removed) and improved mapping technology (suggesting possible alternative locations for historic structures), indicate the areas of known occupation outside the heritage register boundary may still have archaeological potential. In 2014 the Fraser Coast Regional Council maintains and provides interpretation of the town site.  Description  The original Maryborough town site is aligned northwest/southeast along the northern bank of the Mary River, on the northwest outskirts of Maryborough. Indications of the early site include: gravesites; sawpits; stone building foundations; bridge remnants; and archaeological material. The site stretches over a series of creek-lined gullies and is currently occupied by a mixture of open parkland, pasture and heavy vegetation. The main entry to the site is along Aldridge Street, the only surveyed road within the town site that is sealed and open to public vehicles. This road did not exist when the town was settled and the park area near the intersection of Alice and Aldridge Streets was originally the cemetery. Graves of the Furber family at Original Maryborough Town Site, 2008 Modern plaque on Furber family grave, Maryborough Pioneer Cemetery, 2008 The extent of the cemetery is not known but the grass-covered park on the northwest side of Aldridge Street contains the marked graves of George Furber and Joseph Wilmshurst. The park contains at least one other identified grave, now marked only by a headstone plinth. Numerous other depressions in the ground are suggestive of several unmarked graves. Two more marked graves are located on the opposite side of Aldridge Street. The site extends southwest down both sides of Aldridge Street. Just past the (unformed) intersection with George Street the road crosses a creek at the bottom of a gully. In the creek bed on the southeast side of the road are the remains of the original creek crossing. These consist largely of remnants of structural timbers. The large park area on this side of Aldridge Street was originally the site of Chinese gardens. There is a carpark at the southwest end of Aldridge Street, which currently stops short of Queen Street. From the carpark, the site of Aldridge's first inn lies to the west. Muddy Creek runs through the southeast side of the site, and joins the Mary River southwest of the end of Aldridge Street. The land to the southeast of Aldridge Street and the site of Aldridge's inns drops down towards the creek. East of the creek's mouth is a concentration of bamboo, mature native trees and other exotic species, and a small stone and concrete jetty stands just upriver from the mouth of Muddy Creek, near the site of Furber's inn. Northwest of the mouth of Muddy Creek, the terrain rises from the river to a river terrace, where Furber Street is located. The river terrace is quite flat and is framed by Muddy Creek to the southeast, a ridge to the northwest near the junction of Furber Street and Palmer Street, and another ridge to the northeast the parallels to the Mary River. Much of the original township spread along the top of the northeastern ridge, with most buildings located on the southwest side of Queen Street. The lower river terrace is covered with over a metre of flood-deposited sediment that has help protect archaeological material; council workers have encountered archaeological deposits during on-site works. The topsoil on the main ridge along Queen Street has been scoured in some areas, reducing its archaeological potential. Shale and course stone is evident where the ground is bare along the ridge. Some stone foundation work remains on the site of Aldridge's first inn. Behind the Queen Street ridge the land dips, before rising towards a second ridge. The river terrace, the site of Aldridge's two inns, the land by Muddy Creek, and the site of the pioneer graveyard, is largely open grassed parkland dotted with trees. Much of the old township is located in an adjacent paddock to the northwest. The paddock is largely clear of trees. There is patchy grass cover, with some areas of bare earth. The line of the old Gayndah road can still be seen, descending to the river terrace from near the site of Palmer's inn. There is little above-surface evidence of the town, but the placement of the structure markers enable the town's layout to be understood. Some features such as the marked graves and sawpits are clearly evident. Modern built features within the heritage boundary are not of cultural heritage significance.  Heritage listing  Original Maryborough Town Site was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 4 September 2007 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Original Maryborough Town Site demonstrates the evolution of early settlements in Queensland's history, in particular the movement of pastoralists and timber- getters into the Wide Bay district in the 1840s, and their need for a safe port to ship their products and to bring in supplies. Established in 1848 and largely abandoned by 1856, the town site provides relatively undisturbed evidence of early European occupation in the Wide Bay Region. Its abandonment reflects the need to establish a viable settlement with better river access. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The Original Maryborough Town Site is unique among the early town sites of Queensland. Of those towns in existence by the time of Separation from New South Wales in 1859, Maryborough is the only one that retains most of its originally occupied town site in an open, relatively undeveloped condition. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. As a rare example of an early and substantial Queensland town site that has remained in a relatively undeveloped state since its abandonment, the Original Maryborough Town Site has the potential to yield information that will contribute to our understanding of Queensland's history. The abandonment of the town site, the subsequent lack of development, and regular flooding that has deposited a protective layer of alluvium over the lower areas of the site, means the site has the potential to reveal, through archaeological investigation, important and new information about everyday life and work in an early Queensland settlement. Archaeological investigation may provide evidence of the town's occupants, the buildings of the settlement, burials, early streets and industrial sites such as sawpits, yards and jetties that together may provide a more complete and accurate understanding of this important and early Queensland settlement.

Sperm accumulation at the warmer end of the separation tube was much higher than the accumulation at the same temperature but in the absence of a temperature gradient. This gradient-dependent sperm accumulation was observed over a wide temperature range (29-41 ¬∞C). Since temperature affects almost every process, much attention has been devoted to the question of whether the measurements, mentioned just above, truly demonstrate thermotaxis or whether they reflect another temperature-dependent process. The most pronounced effect of temperature in liquid is convection, which raised the concern that the apparent thermotactic response could have been a reflection of a passive drift in the liquid current or a rheotactic responseMiki K. and Clapham, D. E. (2013) Rheotaxis guides mammalian sperm. Curr. Biol. 23, 443-452. to the current (rather than to the temperature gradient per se). Another concern was that the temperature could have changed the local pH of the buffer solution in which the spermatozoa are suspended. This could generate a pH gradient along the temperature gradient, and the spermatozoa might have responded to the formed pH gradient by chemotaxis. However, careful experimental examinations of all these possibilities with proper controls demonstrated that the measured responses to temperature are true thermotactic responses and that they are not a reflection of any other temperature-sensitive process, including rheotaxis and chemotaxis.  Behavioral mechanism of mammalian sperm thermotaxis  The behavioral mechanism of sperm thermotaxis has been so far only investigated in human spermatozoa.Boryshpolets, S., P√©rez-Cerezales, S. and Eisenbach, M. (2015) Behavioral mechanism of human sperm in thermotaxis ‚Äî a role for hyperactivation. Hum. Reprod. 30, 884-892. Like the behavioral mechanisms of bacterial chemotaxisMacnab, R.M. and Koshland, D.E. (1972) The gradient- sensing mechanism in bacterial chemotaxis. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 69, 2509-2512. and human sperm chemotaxis,Armon, L. and Eisenbach, M. (2011) Behavioral mechanism during human sperm chemotaxis: Involvement of hyperactivation. PLoS ONE 6, e28359. the behavioral mechanism of human sperm thermotaxis appears to be stochastic rather than deterministic. Capacitated human spermatozoa swim in rather straight lines interrupted by turns and brief episodes of hyperactivation. Each such episode results in swimming in a new direction. When the spermatozoa sense a decrease in temperature, the frequency of turns and hyperactivation events increases due to increased flagellar-wave amplitude that results in enhanced side-to-side head displacement. With time, this response undergoes partial adaptation. The opposite happens in response to an increase in temperature. This suggests that when capacitated spermatozoa swim up a temperature gradient, turns are repressed and the spermatozoa continue swimming in the gradient direction. When they happen to swim down the gradient, they turn again and again until their swimming direction is again up the gradient.  Temperature sensing  The response of spermatozoa to temporal temperature changes even when the temperature is kept constant spatially suggests that, as in the case of human sperm chemotaxis,Gakamsky, A., Armon, L. and Eisenbach, M. (2009) Behavioral response of human spermatozoa to a concentration jump of chemoattractants or intracellular cyclic nucleotides. Hum. Reprod. 24, 1152-1163. sperm thermotaxis involves temporal gradient sensing. In other words, spermatozoa apparently compare the temperature (or a temperature-dependent function) between consecutive time points. This, however, does not exclude the occurrence of spatial temperature sensing in addition to temporal sensing. Human spermatozoa can respond thermotactically within a wide temperature range (at least 29‚Äì41 ¬∞C). Within this range they preferentially accumulate in warmer temperatures rather than at a single specific, preferred temperature. Amazingly, they can sense and thermotactically respond to temperature gradients as low as <0.014 ¬∞C/mm. This means that when human spermatozoa swim a distance that equals their body length (~46 ¬µm) they respond to a temperature difference of <0.0006 ¬∞C!  Molecular mechanism  The molecular mechanism underlying thermotaxis, in general, and thermosensing with such extreme sensitivity, in particular, is obscure. It is known that, unlike other recognized thermosensors in mammals, the thermosensors for sperm thermotaxis do not seem to be temperature- sensitive ion channels. They are rather opsins, known to be G-protein-coupled receptors that act as photosensors in vision. The opsins are present in spermatozoa at specific sites, which depend on the species and the opsin type. They are involved in sperm thermotaxis via two signaling pathways‚Äîa phospholipase C signaling pathway and a cyclic-nucleotide pathway. The former was shown by pharmacological means in human spermatozoa to involve the enzyme phospholipase C, an inositol trisphosphate receptor calcium channel located on internal calcium stores, the calcium channel TRPC3, and intracellular calcium. The latter was hitherto shown to involve phosphodiesterase. Blocking both pathways fully inhibits sperm thermotaxis.

Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshipped as AdiKesava and his consort Lakshmi as ethiraja nadhavalli. The temple is believed to be the birthplace of Ramanuja, the exponent of Vishishtadvaita philosophy. The gold plated shrine in front of the hall of Ramanuja was built by the Maharaja of Mysore. The temple is open from 6:30 a.m. to 12 p.m. and 4 p.m. to 8 p.m and has six daily rituals at various times of the day. Various festivals are celebrated in the temple, with the Chitirai Brahmotsavam, Masi Pooram festival during February - March and Panguni Uthiram festival during March - April being the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Legend selvapillai on ramanuja's lap Ramanuja (1017‚Äì1137 CE) was a Hindu theologian, philosopher, and scriptural exegete, born in a Tamil family at Sriperumbudur. Vaishnavites see him as one of the most important acharyas (teacher) of their tradition and as the leading expounder of Vishishtadvaita, one of the classical interpretations of the Vedic philosophy. Ramanuja grew up under the tutelage of Tirumalai Nambi, who was working in Tirumala Venkateswara Temple. Once a king wanted to punish Ramanuja. Ramanuja's disciple, Koorathazhwan, helped Ramanuja escape and gave him a white cloth to wear. Ramanuja escaped, but the king punished Koorathazhwan by blinding his eyes. Following the event, a festival is celebrated in the temple where Ramanuja appears in a white cloth for Koorathazhwan. Once a king took the idol of Narayanapuram to please his daughter. Ramanuja went to Delhi to recover the idol and the idol is believed to have fallen on his lap as a child by divine powers as a child. The Chella Pillai Utsavam is held every year commemorating the event. As per another legend, a king tried to kill a tiger that was trying to attack a cow. In spite of his efforts, the cow was killed by the tiger and the king incurred the curse of the cow. To expiate himself from the sin, he did penance at his place. Adi Kesava is believed to have appeared for the king and relieved his curse. Architecture temple tank The temple is built in Dravidian architecture occupies around and has two precincts. It is located in Sriperumbudur, a suburb in Chennai, the capital of the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It has features from Chola and Vijayanagara architecture. There are inscriptions from the Vijayanagara Empire dating back to 1572 from the rule of Sriranga I (1572‚Äì1586 CE). There is another inscription from the period of Aliya Rama Raya (1542‚Äì1565) during 1556 indicating gifts of 36 villages to the temple. The vimana (roof of the sanctum) was gold plated in 1912 and is earliest South Indian temple to have the feature. The plate has the image of Sriramanuja inscribed on it. There is a copper plate recording the history of the gold plate in the temple. The temple has a rectangular plan surrounded by high walls, pierced by a seven-tier gopuram, the gateway tower. The presiding deity is housed in the sanctum and is an image made of granite seen in standing posture. The shrine of Garuda facing Adi Kesava, the vahana of Vishnu, is located axial to the central shrine. The central shrine is approached through a worship hall and a narrow Ardha mandapam. The flagpost is located behind the shrine of Garuda, axial to the central shrine and the gateway tower. There are images of Azhwars in the worship hall on both sides and the shrine of Yathirajavalli is located on in the second precinct. This is one of the temples where Lakshmi takes the name of a devotee. The gold plated hall in front of the shrine of Ramanuja was endowed by the Maharaja of Mysore. There are no separate Sorgavasal, the sacred entrance way opened during the Vaikunta Ekadasi festival. There is a Bhoodakal hall where the festive images of the presiding deity and is consort are housed during the festival. Worship practices and festivals The temple is open from 6:30 a.m. to 12 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. As at other Vishnu temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Vaishnavaite community, a Brahmin sub-caste. The temple rituals are performed four times a day: Ushathkalam at 8 a.m., Kalasanthi at 10:00 a.m., Sayarakshai at 5:00 p.m. and Ardha Jamam at 7:00 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both adi kesavan and his consort yathiraja natha valli. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. Various festivals are celebrated in the temple, with the Chitirai Brahmotsavam, Masi Pooram festival during February - March and Panguni Uthiram festival during March - April being the most prominent. During Chittirai Brahmotsavam, the temple car housing the festival deities of Adikesava and Yathiraja natha valli is drawn around the steerts of Sriperumbudur. The festival car was not operational for the 25 years preceding 2003 and was resumed from 2003. The festival is followed by Thiruavadara Utsavam of Ramanuja, the birthday festival of the saint.

Stephen Sacklarian (1899‚Äì1983) was an Armenian American painter and sculptor of Bulgarian Armenian descent. Although Sacklarian never formally subscribed to any official art movement, critics consider his paintings to be a blend of Modern and Abstract Expressionist, with elements of Cubism.  Early life  Stephen Sacklarian was born in 1899 in Varna, Bulgaria and emigrated to the United States in 1911. His parents were Turkish Armenians who escaped persecution in Turkey from the Armenian Holocaust. Not much is known about Sacklarian‚Äôs early youth, other than he grew up in poverty in Philadelphia. He was a Golden Gloves boxer during a brief period in his late youth. Sacklarian was also missing a small part of his dominant (right) painting hand ring finger from a childhood accident, though he never claimed it a hindrance on his artistic career.  Pre-art career and education He eventually was accepted to the Wharton School of Business, where he graduated with honors. Prior to full commitment to art, Sacklarian had a varied and financially successful career in industry and business as a sales engineer; and worked for General Electric amongst other companies. However, he later decided to formally and professionally pursue art, studying at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Art, the University of the Arts, the T Square Club-School for Architects, the Fleisher Memorial Art School, and ultimately in private study under sculptor Paul Manship.  Professional career = 1930s‚Äì1950s  During his early career from the 1930s until the late 1950s, Sacklarian painted Realistically. Nude portraits, indoor stills and nature were predominant. Few of these early-period paintings are still around; he destroyed most of them. Sacklarian was relatively unknown in the art world during this time, not having yet found his unique painting style which for which he is associated.  Transition into Abstractionism (1960s)  Contemporary abstract painting by artist Stephen SacklarianIn 1966, Sacklarian began painting with acrylics, which opened up new possibilities, enabling different uses of color and form which culminated in the distinct Abstractionist style for which he is known. During the late 1950s and early 1960s Sacklarian produced numerous pieces of wood sculpture, ranging from 12 inches to over 8 feet tall. His sculptures are described as \\"sensuous and dramatic,\\" and with noticeable influences from African Art. Today, very few of his sculptures still exist, as he destroyed all of the known sculptures in his studio following Ayne's death.  Wife Ayne's death and period of destruction  Sacklarian was deeply affectionate toward his wife, Ayne Sacklarian (also an artist), and cited her as inspiration for the expressive joy behind his many works. However, Ayne died tragically and prematurely due to an anesthesiology error during minor surgery. Sacklarian immediately fell into a deep depression, and during this time he destroyed his studio and with it a vast majority of his works. He went through a dark period of art, then temporarily ceased painting, until resuming years later near the end of his life.  Late 1960s‚Äìdeath  His later works in the late 1960s and 1970s are considered to be vibrant and upbeat, more similar his earlier abstract works. Nygaard Otsby, contemporary art critic, states \\"Rather releasing his inner sorrows onto the canvas like other artists, Sacklarian grasps even further to channel the ecstasy that [Ayne] once gave him, finding with it a virtually unparalleled creativity in his later years.\\" Sacklarian visited with and was inspired by Pablo Picasso, Henry Moore, Arshile Gorky, Henri Matisse and other prominent artists of the 20th century. While he painted consistently throughout his career he and his estate hoarded most of his paintings. Sacklarian was an artist-in-residence at Notre Dame University in the 1970s. Sacklarian cites his inspiration as a difficult life and conscious choice for happiness: foremost \\"[His wife], both in life and death\\" and \\"centuries of Armenian oppression and wanderings\\" as well as his rough upbringing and brief years as a boxer, and lastly the concepts of Genesis and the 'Reality of Unreality.'  Style  Sacklarian paintings are typically filled with biomorphic forms in the foreground in front of angular \\"room-like\\" backgrounds or dark color fields. Sacklarian uses perspective and composition, juxtaposing his vivid biomorphic forms in the foreground and the unidentifiable geometric rooms in which they reside. Human and animal forms, limbs, faces, and abstract sexual organs also hover in the foreground. The subconscious mind is a dominant thread in Sacklarian‚Äôs work, and his paintings are notedly dreamlike. \\"Some are brooding, yet most are light and full of mischievous humor. Many have sly sexual references.\\" Sacklarian's palette varied, yet favored bright rich colors. Sacklarian claims to have at all times possessed the exact mental image of his finished works prior to initial creation.  Reception  Some critics view Sacklarian's work as an answer to the stark minimalism of Postmodern Art (see: Minimalism + Postmodern art). Art historian David W. Scott, described Sacklarian's painting forms as \\"emotion-charged puppets enacting dramatizations of human plights, frustrations and fears, whilst [Sacklarian] always remaining the puppeteer.\\" Art appraiser and critic Katherine Faith Prior described Sacklarian‚Äôs work as ‚ÄúGorky-esque; deeply Freudian and shamelessly Laissez-aller.‚Äù  Death and legacy  Stephen Sacklarian died in 1983. He and Ayne never had children. Sacklarian's works are in the permanent collection of over 60 museums worldwide. His estate is currently managed by Zachary Leo Braudy.

It was designed by Victor Emmanuel Carandini and built from 1888 to 1889. It is also known as Queensland International Heritage College and Windsor House. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Maryborough branch of the Royal Bank of Queensland, 1889 The former Royal Bank of Queensland was constructed in 1888‚Äì1889 to the design of Brisbane architect, Victor Carandini. The building was the first branch of the Royal Bank of Queensland opened in Maryborough. The original township of Maryborough was situated, not in its current place, but on the north of the Mary River, after wharves were established in 1847‚Äì1848 providing transport for wool from sheep stations on the Burnett River. In 1850 Surveyor, Hugh Roland Labatt arrived in Maryborough with instructions to suggest the best sites for the towns and wharves. The site recommended by Labatt was not where settlement was established but further east to allow for the development of deeper wharves and from the early 1850s this is where the town developed. During the 1860s and 1870s Maryborough flourished as the principal port of the nearby Gympie goldfield and as an outlet for timber and sugar. The establishment of manufacturing plants and primary industries sustained its growth as a major regional centre. Many banks opened branches in Maryborough during the nineteenth century, and the Royal Bank of Queensland opened a branch in 1888 after many of the other banks were established. The Royal Bank was established in about 1886, and their head office was opened in February 1886, with shareholders concentrating on business, mining and agricultural interests near the eastern coast. The architect chosen to design the Royal Bank was Brisbane architect, Victor Carandini who practised from 1885 in partnership with Alfred Banks and from mid-1887 in private practice. He won several competitions and designed a number of fine buildings throughout Queensland, including a fire station in Townsville; St Thomas' Church of England, Beaudesert; a School of Arts in Redland Bay and the Post Office Hotel in Maryborough. The new bank building was designed to incorporate the banking chamber and offices on the ground floor and a residence for the manager on the upper floor, a common practice in regional banks at the time. The Royal Bank merged with the Bank of North Queensland in about 1917 to form the Bank of Queensland. In 1921 this in turn merged with the Queensland National Bank and became part of the National Bank of Australasia Limited in the late 1940s. This merging meant that many banks in Maryborough were surplus to requirements and the former Royal Bank was one of these, being sold in 1973. It became known as Windsor House and was leased as private tenancies, including some residential use and as a restaurant. In 1983 it was purchased as a group medical practice and also contained pathology laboratories until 1995, when it changed hands again. It was then opened as the Queensland International Heritage College. At this time some of the internal partitions erected for previous tenants were removed and the building was painted.  Description  The former Royal Bank is a substantial two storeyed rendered brick building prominently located on Kent Street, Maryborough. The symmetrically composed principal facade of the building is divided into three bays by round pilasters on square planned plinths. The capitals of the pilasters are of the Corinthian order and from the base to about one third of the overall height, the pilasters are reeded. The central bay is flanked by single pilasters and the pilasters at the corner of the building are paired. Surmounting the pilasters are panels which project from the face of an entablature but have similar mouldings. Above this is a large broken triangular pediment which acts as a parapet, and runs the entire width of the building but comprises a central signage panel, broken arched pediment at the apex, mouldings and urns. Between the pilasters on the face of the building are a number of round arched window openings. The openings on the upper storey, glazed with timber framed sashes, are above blind Italianate balustrades. The central ground floor entrance, is through a round arched opening which is flanked by rusticated pillars supporting an entablature and a scrolled curved pediment. Flanking the central entrance, in the recesses of the side bays are round arched openings. The three elevations of the building which do not address Kent Street are of rendered brick and are less richly decorated, featuring segmental arched openings, a double storeyed verandah and a moulded parapet.  Heritage listing  The former Royal Bank was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former Royal Bank is of historical importance for demonstrating the growth of Maryborough in the 1880s when many financial institutes established branches. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The building is a good example of a late nineteenth-century bank influenced by classical architecture, reinforcing the banking values of tradition and strength. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The former bank is a well composed building of architectural value and a prominent element of the streetscape.

It was designed by Frederic Herbert Faircloth and built from 1914 to 1915 by James Treevan and N C Steffensen. It is also known as Burrum Shire Council Chambers and Woodstock House. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The former Queensland National Bank building is a substantial two-storey masonry building designed in a classical revival style. Originally constructed for William Southerden in c.1863 to a design by Brisbane builder, James Treevan, the building was substantially reconstructed for the Queensland National Bank (QNB) in 1914-15 to the design of architect, Frederic Herbert Faircloth. Settlement at Maryborough commenced in September 1847 when George Furber established a woolstore on the south bank of the Mary River at the head of navigation. He was followed in June 1848 by ET Aldridge and Henry and RE Palmer, who established their own wharves on the opposite riverbank, at a location now known as the original Maryborough town site at Baddow.The original building circa 1910 prior to 1914 reconstruction In 1850 a new town site was surveyed to the east, at a downstream position which provided better access for shipping. The first sale of land at this new site occurred in 1852, but most residents did not shift to the current centre of Maryborough until 1855 and 1856. Maryborough was gazetted a Port of Entry (the Port of Maryborough) in 1859 and was proclaimed a municipality (the Borough of Maryborough) in 1861. During the 1860s and 1870s it flourished as the principal port for the nearby Gympie goldfield and as an outlet for timber and sugar. The establishment of manufacturing plants and primary industries sustained growth in the town into the twentieth century when the QNB building was constructed. The QNB was the first and most successful of Queensland's three indigenous nineteenth century banks. Established in March 1872 by a prominent and influential group of Queensland squatters, politicians, lawyers, and businessmen anxious to secure development capital free from overseas or intercolonial control, the bank attracted widespread Queensland patronage including in 1879 when it secured all of the Queensland Government's banking business. The bank's first offices were opened in Queen Street, Brisbane in 1872. By the 1880s QNB dominated the colony's economy. The land on which this former bank stands was originally granted to Edmund Blucher Uhr in 1852. By 1863, the land was in the possession of Maryborough businessman William Southerden. That year, he accepted a tender for to erect a two-storey brick store covering an area of . The Maryborough Chronicle (9 June 1864) described the building as follows: > \\"On the ground floor is first, on entering, a large store forty-two by > thirty feet (13 m by 9 m); at the back of this a capacious office and > private room; on the upper storey, which is reached by an easy flight of > stairs, is one large room intended for reserve stock. The appearance of the > building from Kent Street is very chaste, and from its loftiness very > imposing. The lower part is furnished with two large plate-glass windows, > surmounted by a handsome cornice, and above this are three sash windows, > each having a single sheet of glass, and on the Richmond Street side five > similar windows. The front towards Kent Street is stuccoed.\\" In 1872, the recently formed QNB acquired the land. However, the bank did not operate from Southerden's former store but initially occupied a small timber building to the rear and then a purpose-built bank (no longer extant) facing Richmond Street. The bank leased the former store on the corner of Richmond and Lennox Streets to Stoward, Bryant and Co. and subsequently a number of other commercial operations before finally moving into the building in 1903. In 1914, the bank embarked on a substantial reconstruction of the building to the design of FH Faircloth. The Maryborough Chronicle (16 May 1914) reported that the original building would \\"form the base or skeleton of improvements and alterations that will completely transform the appearance of the old structure ...\\" A later article (15 June 1915) described the work as \\"dismantling and re-erection\\". The reconstructed building occupied the same area as the previous building and the upper level window openings were located in the same positions. Bank, circa 1916 The Chronicle described the completed building as follows: > \\"The main building has a frontage of 33 feet (10 m) to the main street, with > a depth of 60 feet (9 m) to Richmond Street, all of the work being done in > cement on concrete foundations. The bricks used for the street frontages are > of a reddish colour with white \\"tuck\\" points, while the sandstone coloured > entablature, mouldings and embellishments form a fine set off to the > effective looking Corinthian columns set on solid pedestals and extending to > the full height of the two storeys, the extremities of the columns > themselves being surmounted with beautiful entablatures and enriched > cornice, further relieved with medallions and mouldings.

The bank moved into the new premises on 14 June 1915. Frederic Herbert (Herb) Faircloth was born in Maryborough in 1870 and was a pupil of German-trained Bundaberg architect Anton Hettrich. Faircloth set up his own practice in Bundaberg in 1893 and was very successful, eventually being responsible for the design of almost every major building there. He was also to have a major effect on the appearance and character of Childers where he was engaged to design replacement buildings after much of the main street was destroyed by fire in 1902. In 1919 the block was subdivided and in 1922 the Bank of Queensland, formed in 1917 by an amalgamation of the Bank of North Queensland and the Royal Bank of Queensland, merged with the Queensland National Bank. In 1949 a new title for this property was issued to the National Bank of Australasia following a merger with the Queensland National Bank. These mergers meant that many bank buildings became surplus to requirements and in 1966 this one was sold to the Burrum Shire Council for use as their council chambers. The Burrum Shire was formed in 1917 by the amalgamation of the Shire of Pialba, part of the City of Maryborough and parts of the Shires of Antigua and Howard. The Burrum Council met at first in the Maryborough Town Hall and then in a number of other Maryborough town venues. A building purpose-built for the council in 1938 was rapidly deteriorating by the early 1960s and alternative accommodation was needed, which prompted their move to the former bank building, which was prestigious in appearance and centrally situated. The Burrum Shire Council was formally decommissioned in 1976 when the building was sold into private ownership and used for office tenancies. The name Woodstock House, which currently appears on the building's parapet, was given to it in the 1970s when it was purchased by doctors E Dunn and K Pearson for use as a surgery; Woodstock being the name of Dr Dunn's home in Lennox Street at the time. Major restoration work was carried out on the building after 1999 when the bricks were stripped and the columns were painted.  Description  Bank, 1997 Woodstock House is a substantial two storeyed rendered brick building prominently located in the Maryborough town centre at the corner of Kent and Richmond Streets. Principal facades of the building address both streets. The principal facades of the rectangular planned building are elaborate essays in classical architecture, comprising five bays on the long side, addressing Richmond Street, and three bays to the shorter Kent Street elevation. The bays of the building are defined by double storeyed height pilasters with Corinthian order capitals which are square planned, except those flanking the Kent Street entrance that are round planned. The square planned columns are paired flanking the central Richmond Street bay. The pilasters support a detailed entablature with a projecting cornice with stylised Corinthian order detailing, including dentil mouldings and modillions (or small scrolled bracket giving the impression of supporting another projecting moulded band of the cornice). Surmounting the cornice of the building is an Italianate parapet, formed by a balustrade of elongated urns separated with panels aligned with the pilasters on the face of the building. On the parapet over the two central bays are flat rendered brick panels. The principal entrance to the building, from Kent Street, is through an aedicule or framed opening comprising two columns supporting a round headed pediment. More simple versions of these openings line ground floor in each of the other bays, although the smaller versions do not support a pediment, only an entablature. Above these openings are first floor window openings which are surrounded by architraves. At the corners of the buildings these openings have a blank Italianate balustrade at base level and are surmounted by triangular pediments. The openings in the central bays of each elevation are surmounted by round arched pediments, similar to those in the central bays of the ground floor. The faces of the building which do not have street frontage are smooth faced and are lined with double storeyed timber framed verandahs which are infilled on the upper floor.  Heritage listing  The former Queensland National Bank building was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The building (1914‚Äì15) is significant for demonstrating the growth of Maryborough during the early twentieth century as the centre of a large primary industry and manufacturing region. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The building is a good and characteristic example of an early twentieth century bank, employing features of classical architecture. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The building is prominently sited and well composed, making a major visual contribution to the streetscape and to the character of the city centre. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The building is a major work of the important regional architect, Frederic Herbert Faircloth.

The temple is believed to be the birthplace of Thirumalisai Alvar, one of the twelve Azhwars whose work is compiled as Divya Prabandha, the early medieval Tamil canon of the Azhwar saints from the 6th‚Äì9th centuries AD. The temple is open from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. to 8 p.m and has six daily rituals at various times of the day.

The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Legend Entrance of the temple According to the Hindu legend, the Saptarishis, the seven sages, wanted to have a view of Madhya Jagannatha (literally meaning Jagannatha located in the middle). As per Hindu legend, the Jaganatha at Puri Jagannatha Temple is called Vada Jagannatha (located in the North) and the one located in Adi Jagannatha Perumal Temple at Thirupullani is called Keezha Jagannatha. Acceding to the request of the sages, Vishnu is believed to have appeared as Madhya Jagannatha at this place. The place is also believed to be the birthplace of Thirumalisai Alvar, one of the twelve Azhwars whose work is compiled as Divya Prabandha, the early medieval Tamil canon of the Azhwar saints from the 6th‚Äì9th centuries AD. His works include Tiruvanthai and Tiruchanda Viruttam, which are included in the canon. History Thirumazhisai was originally called by various names like Chrukuravalli- Chaturvedimanagalam, Pakkaturaivalla-Chaturvedimangalam, Mahisaram and Mahaksehtram on account of the number of Vedic people settled here during the Chola and Vijayanagara period. The inscriptions on the walls of the temple are from the chola regime during the 11-12th centuries and Vijayanagara period during the 14-15th centuries. The inscriptions are made in Tamil or in ancient Tamil scripts indicating gift of land, lamps and houses to the temple. The oldest inscription is found from the period of Kulothunga Chola III (1179-1216 CE) indicating gift of land to the temple. Vijaya Gandagopala, a chieftain during the 12th century has endowed gifts to the temple. There are also inscriptions from the period of Kopperunjinga during the 13th century. Harihara Raya II (1377-1404 CE) and Virupaksha Raya II (1465-85 CE), the rulers of the Vijayanagara Empire have donated gifts to the temple as indicated in the inscriptions.

The Salvation Army Conference Centre & Camp is located near the summer resort harbour at Lake Simcoe in Jackson's Point, Ontario. The campgrounds were first purchased by The Salvation Army in 1917, but the Army ran summer camps on the grounds for nearly a decade before. Hugh Garner, a Canadian novelist, recalled having responded to a call to the mercy seat when attending a summer camp at Jackson's Point as a child, even though he became openly anti-Christian and strongly opposed to the idea of a personal god later in life. In recent years, The Salvation Army has split the summer camps by age group, placing the 7 to 10-year-olds in summer camps at Jackson's Point and placing the older children at Camp Newport. Pine Lake Camp (PLC) is in Pine Lake, Alberta. The Salvation Army commenced its camping ministry at Pine Lake in 1958. PLC shares the shoreline of Pine Lake with a number of other camps and campgrounds; including Pine Lake Christian Camp, Camp BB - Riback and Green Acres Campground. The Pine Lake tornado of 2000 did not damage PLC or BB, but did significant damage at Green Acres. Pine Lake Camp has a trailer park that can service 16 trailers at once. Its largest building is Evergreen Lodge, which contains 16 bedrooms and a common room. From September to June, the camp is rented out for school groups, business and government retreats, and family and church retreats. During July and August, there is a full-time camp staff that organizes seven- week-long camps for children and teenagers. Registration for the camps is subsidized by The Salvation Army.

Camp Madawaska is a former Salvation Army camp in Nipissing District Ontario, Canada, near the entrance to Algonquin Provincial Park. It was named after the Madawaska River as the Opeongo River, one of its tributaries, flows through the camp. The main lake on the property was Victoria. Two islands are in the lake, known by the former caretake of the property as The Big Island (Weston Island) and The Small Island (Brownsea Island). Camp Madawaska was owned by Edward Curtis Smith's family. Edward kept a 4-inch Clark portable telescope at the camp. Soon after World War II, the Smiths sold the camp, along with the telescope, to Garfield Weston, owner of the Canadian company, George Weston Limited. When Weston died, he bequeathed the camp to the Salvation Army. For the following years, it was used as a camp for inner-city kids for most of the summer and was also rented for various retreats. Salvation Army Scout and Guide groups made frequent use of the camp. Week-long camps were held each summer and weekend camps occurred in spring, summer, and fall. A 12-day Scout camp was held (1986?) that was attended by Scouts from the U.S., England, and from Canada. Camps were usually held at Camp Madawaska from May until October and sites around Lake Victoria could be rented at any time during those months. The camp was returned to Weston ownership in 2005.

Hu and Baxter owned and ran GlassLands from 2006-2012. In 2012 they made a turn key sale to Rami Haykal and Jake Rosenthal. Rosenthal and Haykal ran the space for two years until the venue was converted into Vice Media's office headquarters. As a concert venue, it was one of the longest-running of several experimental and DIY spaces in the vicinity of the Williamsburg waterfront, which included Death By Audio, Secret Project Robot, Monster Island and 285 Kent.  Glass House Gallery and the beginning of Glasslands (2004-2006)  In 2004, multi-media artists Leviticus and Brooke Baxter, associated with the Freestyle Family, founded Glass House Gallery at 38 South 1st St as an ‚Äúexperimental venue‚Äù for visual art, performance and music geared towards their friends in Williamsburg creative community. Naturally, Glass House attracted musical acts from within Williamsburg's scene and sometimes beyond, including Grizzly Bear, Kyp Malone of TV On The Radio, Matt and Kim, Deerhunter, Adam Green, Kimya Dawson, and Julianna Barwick. Chairlift's Caroline Polachek recalls, ‚ÄúIt was a graffiti-covered warehouse space without a stage, and people watched from a rickety loft balcony that I was sure was going to collapse while Japanther was playing.‚Äù Visual artists that exhibited at Glass House Gallery included Erica Magrey, Brooke Borg and DNA (Aaron Almendral and Mariano Delgado). On Friday nights, the gallery held free ‚Äúart jam hangouts‚Äù where all who attended were encouraged to collaborate. In May 2006, Baxter partnered with musician and artist Rolyn Hu to open The Glasslands Gallery at 289 Kent Ave, a larger partition of the same warehouse complex where Glass House was located. A monthly lecture series, concerts, rotating art installations, community fund-raising events, workshops and a free after-school program were all part of space's stated mission. The layout at the time included a ‚Äútypewriter room‚Äù, a ‚Äúpainting room‚Äù and the ‚Äúlounge/conversation room.‚Äù Practice rooms for bands were also incorporated.  Brooke Baxter and Rolyn Hu open The Glasslands Gallery (2006-2012)  Glasslands was double in size to Glass House and more hospitable for performances, with better sound and seating. Some of the earliest performances included Vampire Weekend, a secret show by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, as well as emerging acts like Pterodactyl, Bon Iver, MGMT and Dirty Projectors. DJ Jonathan Toubin would hold his New York Night Train parties and Soul Clap Dance-Offs at the venue. The Village Voice dubbed Glasslands the ‚ÄúBest Arts Venue Conjuring Avenue A in The 80s‚Äù. In late 2009 Baxter and Hu opened a piano bar and restaurant called The Manhattan Inn in Greenpoint. At this time, Rami Haykal and Jake Rosenthal of PopGun Presents were made the in-house talent buying team at Glasslands. 2011 saw major renovations, including the movement of the stage to the far back corner, along with the removal of rehearsal spaces to allow for a greater audience capacity. During these early years at Glasslands, the venue had a penchant for booking artists that promulgated an often noisy or psychedelic brand of alternative pop, a sound that would become one of Williamsburg's major cultural exports. These acts included Yeasayer, Toro Y Moi, Blood Orange, Chairlift, Tanlines, Twin Shadow, Das Racist, Bear In Heaven, Titus Andronicus, Phantogram, Caribou, Jay Reatard, Wild Nothing, Lemonade, Suckers, Keepaway, Phosphorescent, Passion Pit and Gang Gang Dance.A history of Glasslands shows can be viewed at In 2011, Lana Del Rey played a secret practice gig under the moniker Queen Of Coney Island.  Fully functioning venue and club (2012-2014)  Glasslands exterior. Photo by Ryan Muir In 2012, ownership of Glasslands was transferred to PopGun's Rosenthal and Haykal. In the years prior to the transfer, PopGun had increased the frequency of shows, eventually reaching a point where Glasslands was booked with events virtually every single night save holidays. A green room for artists and coat check were installed as well. Glasslands' continual improvements and augmentations allowed for it to book some national touring acts looking for an intimate space with some underground credibility. FKA Twigs, Disclosure, Wu Lyf, Angel Olsen, Charli XCX, Darkside, Grimes, Alt-J, Franz Ferdinand and Nils Frahm were some of these acts. Vashti Windish's paper clouds installation, which had hung above the stage since 2008, was declared by the New York Fire Department to be a fire hazard. It was replaced with a large array of controllable LED tube clusters, designed by Noah Norman of Ancillary Magnet and built by the Glasslands management and their friends. The clouds were memorialized in the design for Glasslands' first T-shirts, made available at the venue and online shortly after the installation's removal. In July 2013, Glasslands announced that they had upgraded to a Danley Labs Inc. sound system. Under PopGun's leadership, the venue took on more late-night parties with a DJ focus. These included select dates with DJ Jonathan Toubin as well as a monthly residency with the neo- disco and house collective Discovery. The themed Cat Face and Rebel Bingo nights found a home at Glasslands, as did the Brooklyn Electronic Music Festival. The Adventure[s] team also put on a number of notable parties including the season Robyn-themed party, an emo Valentine's dance and a Twin Peaks-themed Halloween party. Major electronic acts and DJs including Jon Hopkins, Baauer, Mister Saturday Night, Omar S., and Sophie (PC Music) all made memorable stops. Bands that made repeated stops during this period include Unknown Mortal Orchestra, How To Dress Well, Crocodiles, Lower Dens, Dum Dum Girls, Le1f, The Range, DIIV, Trust, Shigeto, M√ò, Hooray For Earth, Zambri, The Yellow Dogs, King Krule, Light Asylum, THEEsatisfaction, Cloud Nothings, Anamanaguchi, Kelela, Mon Khmer, Air Waves, Majical Cloudz, Peelander-Z, Slow Magic, Mykki Blanco and Chrome Sparks.  Closure  In the summer of 2014, rumors started circulating the press that Vice Media had its eye on Glasslands' warehouse complex for its new headquarters. Reportedly, the pulp mag-turned-conglomerate was receiving a large tax incentive from the State of New York to remain in New York City. As foretold by the shuttering of both Death By Audio and next-door neighbor 285 Kent, Glasslands announced on October 21 that New Year's Eve 2014 would be its last night of operation. While neither Glasslands nor Vice publicly stated the exact reason for the venue's closure, the announcement resulted in an outcry against the media company, with many alleging that it was cannibalizing the alternative culture that allowed it to flourish. Others chalked it up to the inevitable onset of gentrification, pointing out that the landmark Domino Sugar Refinery across the street from Glasslands was being demolished to make way for luxury condo high-rises. Columns and features on the closing were published in The New York Times, Billboard, Paper Magazine, Gawker, Gothamist, The Fader and other outlets. In its final weeks of operation, Glasslands harkened back to its art gallery roots, bringing in Collective Craft NYC to install works by visual artists Jillian Siegel, Courtney McKenna, Grant Guilliams, Ashley Blanton and more. Annalise Yuri Murphy, a projection artist, created a mapped visual installation projecting all the Glasslands Posters from opening to close. Glasslands bartenders Luiza Kurzyna and Zachary Clausen also contributed new pieces, as did James Devito of Anamanaguchi and Kengo ‚ÄúPeelander Yellow‚Äù Hioki of Peelander-Z.

Biography Caroline McNairn was born in Selkirk in 1955. Her father (John McNairn) and grandfather (also John McNairn) were also painters. Her father died in 2009 aged 98 and he, too, had studied at Edinburgh College of Art in the 1920s, and then in the early 1930s in Paris under Othon Friesz, a friend and pupil of Cezanne. Caroline was therefore only 2 steps away from the father of modern art and his work had a marked influence on her. She studied art at the University of Edinburgh and then Edinburgh College of Art. In the early 1980s, McNairn was one of the first of a new generation of Scottish expressionist artists to exhibit in New York and Chicago, promoted by the 369 Gallery in Edinburgh, with which she had been closely associated from its foundation in 1978, not only as a regular exhibitor but also as an inspiring teacher and artistic adviser. She had a critically acclaimed and ground-breaking show in 1986 at the cutting edge Avenue B Gallery in Manhattan, where her work was admired by Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat. In the same year, she also had shows in Hong Kong, Los Angeles and Santa Fe, and in 1990 spent a year working in the Soviet Union exhibiting with the notorious Kievsky Station Group in Moscow and Odessa.

When Yugoslavia began to break up, she supported Montenegro remaining in Yugoslavia in 1992. Split in the Democratic Party of Socialists In 1997, when the Democratic Party of Socialists began to split between ƒêukanoviƒá and Bulatoviƒá, she initially was closer to Bulatoviƒá. However, she abruptly cut herself off from Bulatoviƒá after one of the DPS committee meetings, after which she was chosen to be the new president by the DPS.

The core interest of CAS is ethical reflection on relations between people and other animals, firmly grounded in intersectionality and anarchism. Its aim is to integrate academic research with political engagement and activism.  History  CAS traces its history back to critical social movements of the 1960s and 1970s, which is when ecological and animal questions entered the academic debate. It was also the time when the first animal liberation movements, Band of Mercy and Animal Liberation Front, emerged. The institutional history began in 2001 when the Centre for Animal Liberation Affairs (CALA) was established by Steve Best and Anthony Nocella. Over the following years CALA conducted research on issues related to animal exploitation, provided education, analysis and advised on policy. Two major initiatives of this institution were the annual Animal Liberation Philosophy and Policy Conference and the founding of the Animal Liberation Philosophy and Policy Journal which was later renamed as the Journal for Critical Animal Studies. The name of the movement (CAS) emerged in 2006, as a consequence of long-term discussions among activists and scholars who collaborated with CALA. At the end of 2006, CALA changed its name to the Institute for Critical Animal Studies (ICAS). Currently, ICAS is a private organization run by a Board of Executive Directors, who are responsible for making major decisions concerning its mission, strategic plans and principles. Since 2011 the institution has been an international network, with branches in Europe, Asia, Africa, South America and Oceania. It has since established a series of initiatives, such as the Students for Critical Animal Studies, the Intersectional Research Collective, the Annual Tilikum Awards and the Revista Latinoamericana de Estudios Cr√≠ticos Animales (Spanish Journal for Critical Animal Studies). In 2014, ICAS published and edited volume entitled \\"Defining Critical Animal Studies: An Intersectional Social Justice Approach for Liberation\\" (co-edited by Anthony J. Nocella II, John Sorenson, Kim Socha, and Atsuko Matsuoka). The publication defines the basic aims and principles of the movement. ICAS also issues three journals‚ÄîJournal for Critical Animal Studies, Peace Studies Journal, and Green Theory and Praxis.  Ten principles  The principles guiding CAS's work were included in the article \\"Introducing Critical Animal Studies\\" which was published in the Journal of the Critical Animal Studies in 2007. # Interdisciplinarity: It supports collaborative work of scholars from different fields to provide a deeper, comprehensive insight into human‚Äìanimal relations. # Subjectivity: It questions the notion that academic analysis can be entirely objective, devoid of normative values and political commitments. # Theory-to-practice approach: It perceives theory as a starting point for political action and social commitment. # Intersectionality: It draws attention to common roots of many forms of oppression, such as speciesism, sexism, racism and other violence-based ideologies, considered as components of global systems of domination. # Antihierarchical approach: It provides anti-capitalist stance, aimed at democratization and decentralization of the society. # Solidarity: It does not concentrate solely on animal issues. Instead, it aims at making alliances with other social movements devoted to struggle against oppression. # Total liberation: It emphasizes the need for human, non-human and Earth liberation and perceives them as a common struggle. # Deconstructing binaries: It undermines socially constructed oppositions, such as human‚Äìanimal and nature‚Äìculture. # Radical politics: It supports all tactics promoting change used in social justice movements, such as economic sabotage and direct action. # Critical dialogue: It promotes constructive dialogue between diverse academic groups, activists and individuals, public and non-profit sectors.  Animal studies  There are significant differences between critical animal studies and animal studies. CAS can be seen as a more radical option, overtly underlining the necessity of political engagement and advocating direct action, which may be considered controversial in traditional academic circles. Supporters of CAS often emphasize that although animal studies has made a large contribution to growing awareness about the complexities of human‚Äìanimal relations, it lacks a deep moral engagement and remains detached from the most significant problems. It is worth considering, however, that the term \\"animal studies\\" refers to diverse scholars and methodologies, some of which clearly state the necessity of ethical commitment.

Heller‚Äòs reputation as an artist is based primarily on his portraits, water colours and posters. Life Bert Heller was born in Aachen, where in 1927 he enrolled for three years as a student at the Fine Arts Academy (as the institution was known at the time). One of his teachers was . On completing his three years at the academy he undertook a study tour that took in the Netherlands, Belgium and Austria, before embarking on a career as a freelance artist based in Laurensberg (Aachen), very close to Germany's Dutch frontier. He also produced some high-profile murals. January 1933 brought r√©gime change and the Hitler government lost little time in imposing one-party government in Germany. Bert Heller joined the ruling Nazi Party in 1940.Ernst Klee: Das Kulturlexikon zum Dritten Reich. Wer war was vor und nach 1945. S. Fischer, Frankfurt am Main 2007, p. 232. Between 1940 and 1942 he studied under at the Munich Fine Arts Academy. During the closing years of the war he undertook artwork commissions in connection with some of the architectural projects that were a feature of the time and place. In 1946 Heller took a teaching post at the Arts Academy in Wernigerode, which in 1945 had ended up in the Soviet occupation zone within what remained of Germany. He remained at Wernigerode till 1950. During this period he was also producing wall and table images and designs. He then became a scholar student (Meistersch√ºler) for painting, studying under at the (East German) Academy of Arts in Berlin. In the meantime the occupation zone had been relaunched, in October 1949, as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany) and Heller joined the Socialist Unity Party (SED / Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands), the ruling political party in what had by now become his country's second one-party dictatorship. The period of study at the Academy of Arts was followed by a professorship of painting at the Academy for Visual and Applied Arts at Weissensee (Berlin), where between 1956 and 1958 he served as Rector in succession to Werner Laux. Heller's period as Rector ended suddenly, with his dismissal: it was later suggested that he had fallen foul of the authorities by siding with students' criticisms of \\"simple curriculum stuffing, that left no space for independent research choices and insights\\",‚Äû...reine Stoffvermittlung, die keinen Raum lasse zum selbstst√§ndigen Suchen, W√§hlen und Sichentscheiden...‚Äú according to the historian Hiltrud Ebert. \\"He struggled against the mental narrowness at the academy, and rebelled in the face of uniformity\\".Er k√§mpfte gegen die geistige Enge an der Hochschule, es war ein Aufbruch gegen die Erstarrung. Heller's appointment to the academy's top job had come in the wake of the \\"political thaw\\" announced in 1955, but his dismissal two years later was an indication that the thaw was powerfully circumscribed by the enduring requirements of The Party. Between 1958 and his death in 1970 Bert Heller worked as a freelance artist in Berlin. He had never officially been disgraced and appears to have been at least partially rehabilitated following his removal from the academic establishment, and was permitted to visit China for a study tour in 1963.

Such a precontract would legally nullify any later marriages into which either party entered. The practice was common in the Middle Ages, and the allegation of a precontract was the most common means of dissolving a marriage by the medieval ecclesiastical courts. Richard III of England claimed his brother Edward IV had entered into a marriage precontract with Lady Eleanor Talbot prior to Edward's later marriage to Elizabeth Woodville. The claim is now largely, though not universally, regarded to be false; if true, it would have meant that Edward's sons by Elizabeth, the 'Princes in the Tower', would have been illegitimate and Richard, rather than they, would have inherited the throne upon Edward IV's death.

The Shoalhaven Coast wine region is located in the state of New South Wales. It is close to the cities of Sydney, Wollongong and Canberra. The region has 16 cellar doors that have produced 500 tonnes or 400,000 bottles of wine. The region is popularly known for Chambourcin, a French red wine. It is produced by crossbreeding and it has a bright and striking colour and an aroma of plummy fruit. The superb coastal beaches brings in enormous tourism, which boosts the wine market. Because of that, the cellar doors in the area are bustling with activities. The region also boasts of the Coolangatta Estate, which is a major tourist attraction in the region. The Shoalhaven coast has been a great success over the years with the establishment of new wineries and increased number of visitors to the area. This has positioned the region in the forefront of North South Wales wine industry. Shoalhaven Coast holds a Winter wine festival every year in June. The festival is supported by wine tours from Sydney and Wollongong. It offers winery tours, outdoor entertainment and regional food tastings. History Shoalhaven is a city located in the South-eastern coastal region of New South Wales, Australia. It is about 200 kilometres south of Sydney. It is adjacent to the Tasman Sea. The South coast railway line cuts through the northern part of the city and stops at Bomaderry. As at 2013, the city has a population of 97,694. The city was named \\"Shoalhaven\\" by George Bass in 1797, when he explored the area and crossed the entryway to the river. He called it \\"Shoal Haven\\" because of the low depth of the river mouth. Vineyards and wineries in the Shoalhaven Coast region were established in the 1980s. Therefore, most of them are small, but a lot of people are investing massively over the last decade. Coolangatta Estate The first vineyard in the region was planted by Alexander Berry at Coolangatta Estate on the slopes of Mt. Coolangatta. It is situated on the northern bank of the Shoalhaven River. The word \\"Coolangatta\\" means \\"good lookout\\". The estate is surrounded by vineyards. Climate Shoalhaven region has warm temperatures during the growing season. Vineyards on the north directly facing the slopes are open, well-drained and exposed to air. The only problem with the region is the unpredictable summer rainfall. The climate of the region is highly influenced by the Pacific Ocean. Wine varieties in the Shoalhaven coast region The two major varieties of wine in Shoalhaven coast are the Chambourcin and Verdelho. Chambourcin is a French hybrid grape variety for making wine. It has a great resistance to fungal diseases. It is good for the humid summer climate experienced in the region. The wine produced from this variety is deep-coloured with an aroma of plummy fruit. Verdelho originates from Portugal and the Island of Madeira. In Australia, it is used to produce white table wines. It is an alternative to Chardonnay wine. They are common because they smell and taste like they produced from grapes. Other types of wine produced in the region are Sauvignon blanc, Semillon, Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz. New varieties of wine are also springing up, such as, Arneis, Viognier, Tempranillo, Sangiovese and Tannat. Shoalhaven coast wine winter festival The Shoalhaven coast wine festival takes place on every June long weekend. It is a festival established to celebrate everything wine. Thousands of visitors come to the region to stay for three days for exciting live music, fine food, winemaker's dinners, wine education talks, vineyard tours, market stalls etc. The weekend is filled with interesting activities for everyone. It has become a major event on wine and food lover's calendar. Festival lovers can buy a commemorative wine glass at the first winery they get to. This will enable them to taste wine and cheese at each of the participating wineries throughout the festival period. Award winning wines The region is known for producing quality and premium wine. This feat was recognized with more than 1,000 Australian and International wine awards.

The episode premiered on Comedy Central on November 11, 2015. Continuing the season's theme of political correctness, the plot primarily lampoons police brutality. Plot A large number of police are called to South Park Elementary in full riot gear believing that there is a danger there, when actually PC Principal has called them in to silence one child (Leslie) who has allegedly been speaking during school assemblies. Officer Barbrady comes in the back door with his gun drawn and accidentally shoots another student in the arm, resulting in him being fired by Mayor McDaniels. When Stuart McCormick calls the police because of the violent homeless people in the now-abandoned SodoSopa district, the police refuse to come, as they do not want to be fired as well. Later, Kenny and Token use one of the buildings near Kenny's home to play as ninjas and reveal that they can legitimately scare people away. More kids join this new ninja group and scare away the vagrants from the area, forcing them to relocate from SodoSopa to Shi Tpa Town and the Whole Foods Market, including Barbrady, who has been evicted from his home. Over time, the residents of South Park become increasingly intolerant of the police, including vandalizing their vehicles and refusing service to them. The news reports that the kids playing as ninjas are actually joining ISIS due to the similarity of their clothing, and they are blamed for the increased homeless problem in South Park. Randy, Gerald and Sheila Broflovski, McDaniels and others go to the police to beg for their help but are refused assistance. The kids receive a video message from ISIS, believing that the message is from a group of real ninjas, and ISIS sends them some money. Meanwhile, McDaniels, Randy and others find Barbrady in the streets and beg him to come back to the police force and shoot the kids that have turned to ISIS. As Barbrady is about to invade the ninja building, Randy realizes that the kids are playing as ninjas and not ISIS members and rushes to stop him. Barbrady decides to talk the children down, genuinely afraid of shooting them. When it seems like the situation will end peacefully, Randy finds and tackles Barbrady, causing Barbrady to shoot another child in the arm, which results in him being fired again. South Park residents agree to turn their backs as the police use their brutality to force the homeless back into SodoSopa. Meanwhile, Barbrady talks with an unknown man who warns him about the changes in South Park, which are apparently part of a plan that involves Leslie, and asks for his help. Critical reception IGN's Max Nicholson gave the episode an 8.0 out of 10, noting: \\"This week's South Park was out for blood on its former self, as the townspeople shunned Officer Barbrady... the only thing that didn't land was the police brutality subplot\\". Chris Longo from Den of Geek gave the episode 3.5 out of 5 stars and summarized in his review: \\"it's shaping up to be one of the best seasons in a decade if it can stick the landing\\". Writing for The A.V. Club, Dan Caffrey rated the episode an A‚àí and noted that \\"As it turns out, 'Naughty Ninjas' has less to do with institutionalized racism (not in a direct sense anyway) and more to do with people only being compassionate when it suits them.

Dutch Minister Joop Wijn credited with introducing the Dutch Sandwich IP- based BEPS tool (which is often used with the Double Irish BEPS tool), and the \\"Dutch Double Dip\\" Debt-based BEPS tool Dutch Sandwich is a base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) corporate tax tool, used mostly by U.S. multinationals to avoid incurring EU withholding taxes on untaxed profits as they were being moved to non-EU tax havens (such as the Bermuda black hole). These untaxed profits could have originated from within the EU, or from outside the EU, but in most cases were routed to major EU corporate-focused tax havens, such as Ireland and Luxembourg, by the use of other BEPS tools. The Dutch Sandwich was often used with Irish BEPS tools such as the Double Irish, the Single Malt and the Capital Allowances for Intangible Assets (\\"CAIA\\") tools. In 2010, Ireland changed its tax-code to enable Irish BEPS tools to avoid such withholding taxes without needing a Dutch Sandwich. Explanation The structure relies on the tax loophole that most EU countries will allow royalty payments be made to other EU countries without incurring withholding taxes. However, the Dutch tax code allows royalty payments to be made to several offshore tax havens (like Bermuda), without incurring Dutch withholding tax. The Dutch Sandwich therefore behaves like a \\"backdoor\\" out of the EU corporate tax system and into un-taxed non-EU offshore locations. These royalty payments require the creation of intellectual property (\\"IP\\") licensing schemes, and therefore the Dutch sandwich is limited to specific sectors that are capable of generating substantial IP. This is most common in the technology, pharmaceutical, medical devices and specific industrial (who have patents) sectors. Its creation is generally attributed to Joop Wijn (State Secretary of Economic Affairs in May 2003) after lobbying from U.S. tax lawyers from 2003‚Äì2006.  Impact  As of 2020, \\"The Netherlands is an extremely attractive jurisdiction in which to locate a royalty conduit companies\\", although a withholding tax on royalties was announced for 2021 \\"for cases where abuse is involved\\" after international pressure. As of 2016, \\"Multinationals moved some ‚Ç¨22bn in royalties and interest through the Netherlands in 2016 in order to avoid tax, according to a new report for the finance ministry\\". Usage of this tax avoidance structure, alone, produced 10 % of the income reported by shell companies in the Netherlands. Double Irish Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny and PwC (Ireland) Managing Partner Feargal O'Rourke, the \\"architect\\" of the double Irish, who lobbied successfully in 2010 for changes to the Irish withholding tax rules, thus removing the need for a Dutch sandwich. The Dutch Sandwich is most commonly associated with the double Irish BEPS tax structure, and Irish-based US technology multinationals such as Google. The Double Irish is the largest BEPS tool in history, helping mostly US technology and life sciences multinationals shield up to US$100 billion per annum from taxation. The Double Irish uses an Irish company (IRL2) that is legally incorporated in Ireland, and thus the US-tax code regards it as foreign, but is \\"managed and controlled\\" from, say, Bermuda (and thus the Irish tax code also regards it as foreign). The Dutch Sandwich, with the Dutch company as the \\"dutch slice\\" in the \\"sandwich\\", is used to move money to this Irish company (IRL2), without incurring Irish withholding tax.‚ÄòDouble Irish With a Dutch Sandwich‚Äô In 2013, Bloomberg reported that lobbying by PricewaterhouseCoopers Irish Managing Partner Feargal O'Rourke, who Bloomberg labelled \\"grand architect\\" of the Double Irish, led to the Irish Government to relax the rules for making Irish royalty payments to non-EU companies (i.e. IRL2), without incurring Irish withholding tax. This removed the explicit need for the Dutch Sandwich, but there are still several conditions that will not suit all types of Double Irish structures, and thus several US multinationals in Ireland continued with the classic \\"Double Irish with a Dutch Sandwich\\" combination. After pressure from the EU, the Double Irish BEPS tool was closed to new users in 2015, however, new Irish BEPS tools were created to replace it: * Microsoft's and Allergan's Single Malt Irish BEPS tool; * Apple's and Accenture's Capital Allowances for Intangible Assets (CAIA) Irish BEPS tool (made famous by leprechaun economics). Conduit OFC conduit OFC in the world, as it facilitates the movement of EU-sourced profits to non-EU tax-havens The Dutch Sandwich has made Netherlands the largest of the top five global Conduit OFCs identified in a 2017 analysis published by Nature Research of offshore financial centres titled: \\"Uncovering Offshore Financial Centers: Conduits and Sinks in the Global Corporate Ownership Network\\". The five global Conduit OFCs (Netherlands, United Kingdom, Ireland, Singapore, and Switzerland) are countries not formally labeled \\"tax havens\\" by the EU/OCED, however, they are responsible for routing almost half the flows global corporate tax avoidance to the twenty-four Sink OFCs, without incurring tax in the Conduit OFC. Conduit OFCs rely on major offices of large law and accounting firms to create legal vehicles, where as Sink OFCs have smaller operations (e.g. branches of these larger firms). For example, Ireland has the BEPS tools to enable US IP- heavy multinationals to reroute global profits into Ireland, tax-free. The Netherlands then enables these Irish profits to get to a classical tax haven (e.g. the Cayman Islands or Jersey) without incurring EU withholding tax.

Instead, the untaxed profits were \\"lent out\\" to the corporate parent, or its subsidiaries, thus avoiding the risk of incurring US taxation. The Bermuda black hole led to US corporations amassing over US$1 trillion in offshore locations from 2004 to 2017 (before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017). A \\"Bermuda black hole\\" became the most favoured common final destination for the Double Irish with a Dutch Sandwich base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) corporate tax avoidance strategy as used by US multinational technology firms in Ireland; and particularly Apple and Google.Drucker J. (2010). The Tax Haven That's Saving Google Billions. Business Week. Apple's \\"Bermuda black hole\\", called Apple Operations Ireland (\\"AOI\\"), became part of a 2013 US Senate inquiry by Carl Levin and John McCain, which led to the 2014‚Äì2016 EU Commission inquiry and a US$13 billion fine, the largest corporate tax avoidance fine in history. The term \\"black hole\\" is not unique to Bermuda and has been used to describe other uses of offshore tax havens, such as the \\"Cayman black hole\\". Replacement Sink OFCs ordered by value (highlighting U.K. dependencies) A seminal 2017 academic study published in Nature magazine on the classification of tax havens and offshore financial centres used the related term of \\"Sink offshore financial centre\\", instead of \\"black hole\\", to describe locations like Bermuda as: \\"jurisdictions in which a disproportional amount of value disappears from the economic system\\". In the study Bermuda was ranked as the 5th largest of 24 Sink OFCs identified and classified in the study (see graphic). The 2017 study, which was titled Uncovering Offshore Financial Centers: Conduits and Sinks in the Global Corporate Ownership Network, used quantitative analysis techniques to prove that some global jurisdictions act like corporate taxation \\"black holes\\" (e.g. the Sink OFCs), where funds are sent as their legal \\"terminus\\". However, the study showed how the Sink OFCs rely heavily on jurisdictions that act as Conduit OFCs in routing untaxed global profits to the \\"black holes\\". 2017 TCJA Tax academics believe that the change in the US corporate tax code from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) should diminish the ability of US corporations to use offshore structures that shield untaxed profits from US taxation, such as \\"Bermuda black hole\\" (or Bermuda Sinks), as global US corporate income is now deemed automatically repatriated to the US under the TCJA. It is therefore likely that the term \\"Bermuda black hole\\" will not remain in common use.

The Tigers played their home games at Jordan‚ÄìHare Stadium in Auburn, Alabama and competed in the Western Division of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). They were led by fourth-year head coach Gus Malzahn. They finished the season 8‚Äì5, 5‚Äì3 in SEC play to finish in a tie for second place in the Western Division. They were invited to the Sugar Bowl where they lost to Oklahoma. Before the season=Previous season The 2015 Auburn Tigers began the season as the preseason pick to win the SEC Championship and a berth in the College Football Playoff. There was also hype about junior QB Jeremy Johnson who sat behind Nick Marshall in 2013 and 2014, being a Heisman Trophy candidate. The hiring of Will Muschamp as defensive coordinator was a major success for the Tigers after Ellis Johnson was let go after a 55-44 defeat in the 2014 Iron Bowl. The Tigers' season began with some shocking surprises. In a week one showdown against Louisville in the Chick- fil-A Kickoff Game, Auburn built a 24-0 lead, but Jeremy Johnson threw three interceptions and the Cardinals came back from 24-0 before finally falling to Auburn 31-24. Auburn suffered key injuries to Carl Lawson, Tray Matthews, Roc Thomas and Jovon Robinson. This with starting corner TJ Davis out with acl and Joshua Holsey sitting out. A week later, Auburn played against FCS foe Jacksonville State, Auburn again had a rough outing from both Jeremy Johnson and the Tigers' defense. The Tigers would fall to 2-2 and 0-2 in SEC play after being defeated by LSU and Mississippi State. The Tigers defeated San Jose State and then got their first SEC win of the season at Kentucky. After beating the Wildcats, Auburn would go on to lose four out of their remaining six regular season games. Those consisted of home losses to Georgia 20-13, Alabama 29-13, Ole Miss 27-19, and a 4 four overtime loss on the road at Arkansas 54-46. Auburn's two only wins in that time were against Idaho and Texas A&M.; Auburn finished the season with a 6-6 season and earned a trip to the 2015 Birmingham Bowl against Memphis. The Tigers beat Memphis 31-10 in Birmingham, giving coach Gus Malzahn his first bowl win and the team's first bowl win since 2011. Following the season, defensive coordinator Will Muschamp left the program to become the head coach at South Carolina, joining him were Travaris Robinson, Lance Thompson, JB Grimes moved on as well to join Cincinnati's coaching staff. Kevin Steele was hired to be Auburn's new defensive coordinator, and assistants Wesley McGriff, Travis Williams, and Herb Hand were added to the staff. The offseason saw numerous transfers including: RB Roc Thomas, TE Chris Laye, OL Jordan Diamond, OL Will Adams, DE Gimel President, LB Javiere Mitchell and S Tim Irvin. Following the season OL Avery Young and OL Shon Coleman chose to forgo their remaining eligibility by entering the 2016 NFL Draft. Auburn picked up transfers in Baylor RB Kameron Martin, Illinois LB TJ Neal and Miami, OH CB Marshall Taylor. Texas RT Darius James and Ohio St CB Jamal Dean now available after sitting out 2015.

The Blue team defeated the White team by the score of 19‚àí10. Schedule Auburn announced its 2016 football schedule on October 29, 2015. The 2016 schedule consists of 8 home and 4 away games in the regular season. The Tigers will host SEC foes Arkansas, LSU, Texas A&M;, and Vanderbilt, and will travel to Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi State, and Ole Miss. The Tigers will host all four non‚Äìconference games. Auburn will host Alabama A&M; from the Southwestern Athletic Conference, Arkansas State and Louisiana‚ÄìMonroe both from the Sun Belt Conference and national title runner up Clemson from the Atlantic Coast Conference. The 2016 season is the first season the Tigers will play eight home games since the 2013 season, when Auburn went 12‚àí2 and appeared in the 2014 BCS National Championship Game. :Schedule Source: Game summaries=Clemson The Tigers opened the season with a home contest against the 2015 national runner-up Clemson. This is considered a rivalry game for both schools. Clemson came into the game ranked number 2 in the country while Auburn was unranked. Auburn took an early lead on a long field goal by Daniel Carlson. Clemson, however, responded with a drive of its own, which resulted in a touchdown on 4th down and goal from the 1-yard line. Clemson would lead 10-3 going into halftime and add another field goal in the 3rd quarter to make the score 13-3 going into the 4th quarter. Auburn cut the lead on another field goal by Daniel Carlson, but once again Clemson responded with another touchdown. Auburn would score a touchdown with just over 3 minutes to play in the ballgame. Auburn would then stop Clemson on the ensuing possession, but 2 hail mary attempts by Auburn were broken up in the end zone in the last 10 seconds of the ballgame and Clemson held on for the 19-13 victory. Auburn would fall to 0-1, making this the first opening game loss for Auburn with Gus Malzahn as coach. Arkansas State The second game of the season was also the second non-conference opponent for the Tigers. They played Arkansas State out of the Sun Belt Conference. Auburn scored first but Arkansas State quickly answered with a long pass play that set up a touchdown to tie the game at 7. Auburn scored next and never looked back scoring 31 unanswered points. At halftime, the Tigers lead 38-7. The final score was 51-14. Sean White had 3 touchdowns, more than he had in all his past Auburn games combined. The game was Auburn's best offensive performance, according to many writers, since the 2014 season. Overall, this was a very impressive victory for Auburn, and for Gus Malzahn, who used to coach at Arkansas State in 2012. Auburn also remains unbeaten against the Sun Belt Conference after this win. Texas A&M; The third game of the season is the first conference game for Auburn. SEC Western Division opponent Texas A&M; comes to Auburn to play that game. Auburn beat the 25th ranked A&M; last year 26-10. Auburn has yet to beat the Aggies at Auburn. Auburn has been out scored 104 to 59 at home by A&M.; LSU The fourth game of the season was a rivalry game against the LSU Tigers. The game would end with a controversial win. After an illegal shift was called against LSU with one second to go, LSU would go on to score what was initially called a touchdown as time expired before being reviewed and determined that time expired prior to the snap, negating the touchdown and giving Auburn the 18-13 win. This was Auburn's first SEC victory without scoring a touchdown since 2008, when they won 3-2 against Mississippi State. Daniel Carlson was 6-6 on field goals in the game, including a 51-yard field goal. Auburn held LSU star running back Leonard Fournette to less than half the yards they allowed him in 2015. It was Auburn's first home conference win since October 25, 2014 against South Carolina. Louisiana‚ÄìMonroe The fifth game of the season was the annual homecoming game. The Louisiana‚ÄìMonroe Warhawks came to Auburn for their tenth game ever against the Tigers. The last time the Warhawks and the Tigers clashed, the result was a 31‚àí28 Auburn victory in overtime back in the 2012 season. However, this one went very differently. Auburn dominated from the start. The Tigers had their highest point total since 59 versus San Jose State in 2014. The defense also allowed the fewest points since 3 against Western Carolina in 2013. Auburn improved to 3-2 to go over .500 for the first time in the season. Mississippi State The sixth game of the season was the first road game for the Tigers. They played at Mississippi State where they had not won since 2010. However, Auburn easily won the game. After an early interception put the Bulldogs in good field position, the Tigers defense responded, holding Mississippi State to a field goal attempt that was no good. Auburn seized the momentum after that. Starting running back Kerryon Johnson got hurt early in the game, but Kamryn Pettway took over the game with a 169-yard performance including 3 touchdowns. Also, the Auburn defense scored a touchdown when Carl Lawson forced a fumble which was picked up by Montravius Adams and returned 13 yards for a touchdown. Auburn led 35-0 at halftime. The Tigers slowed down in the second half, only attempting one pass on offense. The final score was 38-14. It broke a two-game losing streak to the Bulldogs and improved Auburn's record to 4-2 and 2-1 in the SEC. The win also propelled Auburn into the AP Poll the next week, as the Tigers were ranked #23. Arkansas After their only bye week of the season, Auburn played Arkansas in the seventh game of the year. In the 2015 season, the Tigers lost a heartbreaker in Fayetteville, falling 54‚àí46 in four overtimes. The Tigers avenged that loss in a very big way, dominating the Razorbacks from the start. The Tigers had over 500 yards of rushing, the Razorbacks only had 25. It was Auburn's biggest margin of victory over an SEC opponent since 1970. The Tigers also built their lead in the overall series, now leading it 14‚àí11‚àí1. Ole Miss The eighth game of the season was a trip to Oxford, Mississippi to face Ole Miss. In an offensive shootout, Ole Miss quarterback Chad Kelly set the Ole Miss school record for most passing attempt and most passing yards in a single game. However, Auburn had just as much success rushing as Ole Miss had passing. Kamryn Pettway had a career-high 236 yards. The key play came late in the game with Auburn leading 33‚Äì29 and Ole Miss driving down the field for the go-ahead touchdown. Ole Miss tight end Evan Engram dropped a pass which would have likely resulted in a touchdown. On the next play, Auburn defender Josh Holsey intercepted quarterback Chad Kelly's pass and returned it the Ole Miss 30 yard line. That set up a Kerryon Johnson touchdown that made it a two possession game, ultimately sealing the win for Auburn. Auburn became bowl eligible with their 6th win of the year. Auburn now leads the overall series 30‚àí11‚àí0. Vanderbilt The ninth game of the season is against SEC Eastern Division opponent Vanderbilt. The last game, which was in the 2012 season, was a 17‚àí13 Vanderbilt victory. Vanderbilt leads the all-time series 21‚àí20‚àí1. Georgia The tenth game of the year is the annual Deep South's Oldest Rivalry game against Georgia. In the last meeting, Georgia won by the score of 20‚àí13 in the 2015 season. Georgia has a slim lead in the series, which has been played since 1892, 56‚àí55‚àí8. Alabama A&M; The eleventh game will be the final home game for Auburn making it Senior Night. Alabama A&M; and Auburn have only played once before with the Tigers winning that game 51‚àí7 in the 2012 season. That win gave the Tigers the overall series lead of 1‚àí0‚àí0. Alabama The final game of the regular season is the annual Iron Bowl clash with Alabama. In the last meeting, which was in the 2015 season, Alabama won 29‚àí13 on their way to a national championship. Alabama leads the all-time series 44‚àí35‚àí1. Auburn has not beat Alabama in Tuscaloosa since 2010. Oklahoma The Tigers were selected for the Sugar Bowl to play Oklahoma. The Sugar Bowl usually takes the highest-ranked SEC team, but because the SEC champion, Alabama, was in the playoff, the Sugar Bowl chose Auburn. It will be the first time Auburn and Oklahoma have played since the 1972 Sugar Bowl, for the 1971 season. The Sooners won that game 40‚Äì22 and thus have a 1‚Äì0‚Äì0 series lead.

The film stars Ranveer Singh, Deepika Padukone and Priyanka Chopra in lead roles. The album, originally recorded in Hindi features nine songs, and was released on 31 October 2015 by Eros Music. The original score of the film is composed by Sanchit Balhara. The music in the film is situational and narrative in nature. The songs were conceived progressively with the development of film script that was completed in twelve years. Bhansali was inspired by the music of Mughal-e-Azam to compose the film soundtrack. The songs cover genres of Marathi folk, Sufi, lavani, qawwali and Indian classical apart from fusion of different ragas in single tracks. Upon release, music critics anticipated in positive that the tunes will match visuals, justifying lyrical interpretations. Critics noted the album as semi-classical, emphasizing more on harmonies, melodies and rhythms. Although the background score was called thunderous and elaborate, well into the film's soundscape, it was criticised for overuse and strength. Sanjay Leela Bhansali was nominated under Filmfare Award for Best Music Director for his music direction. However, Shreya Ghoshal won the Filmfare Award for Best Female Playback Singer for the song \\"Deewani Mastani\\". Artistes Justin Jose and Biswadeep Chatterjee won the National Film Awards for Best Audiography, the former awarded for final re- recording whereas the latter for sound design. The film score was nominated under Best Original Music category at the Asian Film Awards 2016.  Development  Sanjay Leela Bhansali took inspiration for the songs from the film Mughal-E-Azam (1960). For the track \\"Albela Sajan\\", Bhansali has tuned Kishori Amonkar, who has sung the original track in the raag Bhoopali. The composition was blended with another raag titled Ahir Bhairav. Bhansali added that Shiv Kalyan Raja, a Marathi album by Hridaynath Mangeshkar, apart from Marathi folk and classical music were inspirations for the soundtrack of Bajirao Mastani. The track \\"Mohe Rang Do Laal\\" was composed when Bhansali was waiting at the airport after his flight got cancelled. The initial composition of \\"Deewani Mastani\\" dates to twelve years back where Bhansali conceived the track while having a shower. He adds: \\"That was the first time I had thought of making Bajirao Mastani as a film.\\" The song opens with Marathi lyrics \\"Nabhatoon aali apsara, ashi sundara, saaz sazvuna\\" which translates to \\"A fairy has stepped down from the skies, so beautiful and all dressed up.\\" Lyricist Prashant Ingole, on writing for the song \\"Gajanana\\" stated: \\"I was asked to write an aarti for Ganpati and I wanted to do something that was never done before. So I went back home and asked my mother the different names of Ganeshji, and jotted them down.\\" The song \\"Gajanana\\" was composed by Shreyas Puranik. Justin Jose K. was involved the key sound mixing of the soundtrack and original score. According to him, some scenes required a lot of probe into the characters and the mood. His team involved for sound mix worked for nearly 600 hours for a month and a half. They had to study the characters, the period of the film and the requirement as directed by Bhansali to set the sounds right on Dolby Atmos.  Critical response = Songs  Music critic Joginder Tuteja from Bollywood Hungama gave the album 3.5 stars (out of 5) saying: \\"Bajirao Mastani soundtrack is on the expected lines. A heavy album with as many as 10 tracks, it is high on classical base with a few potentially popular songs in there as well. Though at least half the songs in there are primarily situational, given Sanjay Leela Bhansali's expertise when it comes to spinning around wonderful visuals, they can be expected to make a good impression on screen.\\" Critic R. M. Vijayakar in his review for India-West gave the soundtrack a rating of 4.5 out of 5 and described the album to be a \\"fragrant rose\\". He stated: \\"The Maharashtrian ambiance, complete with riffs, choruses and traditional Marathi verse and excerpts, dominates \\"Bajirao Mastani\\"'s fascinating score, easily Sanjay Leela Bhansali's finest musical outing since \\"Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam (1999).\\" Aelina Kapoor from Rediff.com gave the album a score of 3 out of 5, termed the album a \\"roller coaster ride\\" saying that, \\"The music of Bajirao Mastani is a roller coaster ride. Though there isn't anything wrong about Bhansali's tunes here, there are quite a few ups and downs in the 10 songs in the soundtrack. A lot of qawalli and romance in Bajirao Mastani's soundtrack.\\" Suanshu Khurana from The Indian Express gave the album 3.5 stars out of 5 and stated, \\"In many parts, Baajirao Mastani sounds fresh, like carefully restored music from Bajirao's times. Some tracks work better than the others. Buy it for Bhansali's distinct sound and a balance between restraint and exuberance.\\" Kasmin Fernandes of The Times of India gave the album 3.5 stars out of 5 and complimented the lyrics by Siddharth-Garima, singing by Arijit Singh, Vishal Dadlani and Shreya Ghoshal. Devesh Sharma in his critical review for Filmfare, gave the album 3 stars out of 5, stating that, \\"Bajirao Mastani's soundtrack isn‚Äôt for the average listener used to hook-filled masala numbers. It's an acquired taste but will definitely offer up its riches if you lower your inhibitions. Clean, harmonic music leaning towards melody and rhythm.\\" Surabhi Redkar from Koimoi assigned the album a score of 3 out of 5. He summarised that, \\"The Bajirao Mastani soundtrack is a mixed bag. The classical numbers outshine the others. The album is expected to be a treat visually too.\\"  Original score  In his review for Bollywood Hungama, Taran Adarsh wrote: \\"Bhansali seamlessly weaves music in the historical. Filmed with care, the songs (also composed by Bhansali) are mesmeric and have been choreographed with precision. The ones that stand out are Deewani Mastani, Albela Sajan and Pinga. The background score by Sanchit Balhara is wonderful.\\" Subhash K. Jha stated, \\"The songs composed by Bhansali come on very frequently never intruding on the theme of love and war but rather enhancing the theme with sumptuous supreme supplementation.\\" Srijana Mitra Das in her review for The Times of India gave the music 3.5 out of 5. Dhriti Sharma of Zee News exclaimed: \\"Music is like a breath of fresh air and the songs have been shot well. Giving a plus to the thunderous background scoring that amplified each frame.\\" On the same lines, critic Raja Sen of Rediff called the score thunderous. Namrata Joshi of The Hindu stated: \\"There is not a moment of silence. Even when there is, the pounding background music takes over.\\" Ananya Bhattacharya of India Today said: \\"The music of the film is haunting. The background score, \\"Deewani Mastani\\" and \\"Aayat\\" are among the songs that stay with one long after the film ends.\\" Surabhi Redkar in her review for Koimoi said, \\"The soulful music too compliments well except Pinga which is not a delight to watch.\\" Critic Rajeev Masand opined that the narrative is hobbled due to too many songs. In his review for NDTV, Saibal Chaterjee said: \\"Every emotion in the film ‚Äì be it love, longing or valour on the battlefield ‚Äì is translated into a grand and elaborate song-and-dance routine. A couple of the musical set pieces do not ring true in a historical epic about a man whose place in history is primarily as an unvanquished general.\\" Suprateek Chatterjee of Huffington Post India noted: \\"Sanchit Balhara's background score is nicely orchestrated, but dominates the film's soundscape along with badly mixed-in battle sound FX a little too strongly.\\"  Marketing  The first single from the soundtrack album \\"Gajanana\\" was launched on 23 September 2015, at Shree Shiv Chhatrapati Sports Complex, Balewadi Stadium in Pune in the presence of film's director Sanjay Leela Bhansali, Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone. The second single from the film, titled \\"Deewani Mastani\\" was launched on 21 October 2015 at an event in Delhi. After the release of soundtrack album on 31 October 2015, the third single, titled \\"Pinga\\" was scheduled to be released in a launch event on 14 November 2015, but it was cancelled due to the November 2015 Paris attacks. It was then officially released online on 15 November 2015. The song titled \\"Malhari\\" was launched at an event in Bhopal on 29 November 2015. The song \\"Albela Sajan\\" and \\"Aayat\\" along with \\"Malhari\\" were released in that order, forming promotional singles after the soundtrack album release.  Track listing = Hindi  Tamil  Telugu = Music charts  At the end of 2015, the music from the soundtrack garnered views from critics. Sankhayan Ghosh of The Hindu wrote: \\"There are few filmmakers as musical as Sanjay Leela Bhansali, who took one step forward in taking full control over his ambitious audiovisual canvas in Bajirao Mastani. While the powerful 'Gajanana' amplified a crucial sequence to a great extent, it was the left- out-from-album Bajirao theme, the war cry-like chant 'Ji Ji Re Baji Ji Ji', that gives the film an electrifying energy. The album favourites included ‚ÄòDeewani Mastani‚Äô, 'Ab Toh Jaane Na Doongi', ‚ÄòMohe Rang Do Laal‚Äô and 'Aaj Ibadat'.

The war cry \\"Malhari\\" and the devotional \\"Gajanana\\" are weapons in Bajirao's armour. The album also meshes semi-classical with qawwali in \\"Aayat\\" while \\"Mohe Rang Do Laal\\" has Pandit Birju Maharaj interspersing Shreya Ghoshal's vocals with Kathak bols (mnemonic syllables) \\"Albela Sajan\\" from Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam (1999), gets a makeover with a sitar and chorus interlude. \\"Pinga\\" and \\"Fitoori\\" incorporate a lavani tempo with Bollywood trimmings to produce a fantastic melange.\\" In her compilation for Hindustan Times, Juhi Chakraborty mentions: \\"Classical number \\"Albela Sajan\\" has been revisited many times over the years and Bhansali, who used the track in his superhit Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam, brought out another version of the song- this time for his period love saga Bajirao Mastani.

While most First Nations in the Territory are a part of the wider Dene Nation, there are Tlingit, Inuit and M√©tis nations that blend into the wider spectrum of Indigeneity across Canada. Traditionally gatherers and hunters, Indigenous peoples and their associated nations retain close connections to the land, the rivers and the seasons of their respective countries or homelands. Their histories are recorded and passed down the generations through oral traditions. European contact and invasion brought many changes to the native cultures of Yukon including land loss and non- traditional governance and education. However, Indigenous folks in Yukon continue to foster their connections with the land in seasonal wage labour such as fishing and trapping. Today, Indigenous Nations aim to maintain and develop Indigenous languages, traditional or culturally-appropriate forms of education, cultures, spiritualities and Aboriginal rights.

He was also involved with Sunderland Trades Council, of which he was secretary from 1888, and was a founder of the Tyneside and District Labourers Union. Initially a supporter of the Liberal Party, he was elected to Sunderland Borough Council in 1892, remaining a member until his death. In this role, his major achievement was arranging the municipalisation of the tramways and subsequently electrifying the system. Around the mid-1890s, he became a socialist and joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP). He was also the secretary of the National League of the Blind and was active in the Foresters' Friendly Society. At the 1906 general election, Summerbell was elected for the Labour Representation Committee in Sunderland, with the support of the ILP. Although there were two MPs for the town, he took up the entirety of local issues, and also became known for his interest in reforms to the indentured labour system in the West Indies. Work in Trinidad contributed to his campaign for the renamed Labour Party at the January 1910 general election, but he lost his seat. He died suddenly the following month during a council meeting.

Morawiecki is of distant German descent. The Times of Israel also reported in 2017 that Morawiecki has \\"Jewish roots\\", however this claim has not been confirmed. Morawiecki was active in the Polish anti-communist movement since age 12 when he helped in copying underground political literature. In August 1980 he plastered the streets of Wroc≈Çaw with posters calling for a general strike. After martial law was declared in 1981, he printed and distributed underground Solidarity magazines. In an interview, he said he threw Molotov cocktails at police cars and was on many occasions stopped and beat by Poland's secret police (S≈Çu≈ºba Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa, SB). In the 1980s, he edited an illegal political newspaper Lower Silesia Bulletin and was active in the Independent Students' Association. He continued taking part in political demonstrations until the late 1980s and participated in occupation strikes at the University of Wroclaw in 1988 and 1989.

While at the Wroc≈Çaw University of Technology, he studied abroad at Central Connecticut State University and completed an advanced executive program at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management. Business career In 1991 Morawiecki began work at Cogito Company and co-created two publishing firms, Reverentia and Enter Marketing-Publishing. That same year he co-founded the magazine Dwa Dni (Two Days), later becoming editor-in-chief. In 1995 he completed an internship at Deutsche Bundesbank in credit analysis, financial restructuring, banking supervision, and financial market supervision. In 1996‚Äì97 he conducted banking and macroeconomic research at the University of Frankfurt. In 1998, as deputy director of the Accession Negotiations Department in the Committee for European Integration, he oversaw and participated in numerous areas, including finance, of the negotiations for Polish accession to the European Union. With Frank Emmert, he co-authored the first textbook on The Law of the European Union published in Poland. From 1996 to 2004 Morawiecki lectured at the Wroc≈Çaw University of Economics, and from 1996 to 1998 also at the Wroc≈Çaw University of Technology.

Political career Morawiecki at opening of Campus Warsaw On 16 November 2015, President Andrzej Duda appointed Mateusz Morawiecki as both Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Development in the Cabinet led by Prime Minister Beata Szyd≈Ço. (This took place soon after Mateusz Morawiecki's father, Kornel Morawiecki, was elected to Poland's lower chamber of the parliament and the Law and Justice party won the 2015 parliamentary elections.) In March 2016, Mateusz Morawiecki announced that he had joined the Law and Justice party. On 28 September 2016, in addition to his other positions, Morawiecki was appointed Minister of Finance, becoming the second most powerful member of the Government, overseeing the budget, government finances, European Union funds, and overall economic policy. As Finance Minister, Morawiecki outlined an ambitious \\"Plan for Responsible Development\\", known colloquially as the \\"Morawiecki Plan\\", aimed at stimulating economic growth and raising revenues for generous government plans, including ‚ÄúFamily 500+‚Äù child benefits for all families with two or more children. In March 2017, he took part in a meeting of G20 finance ministers in Baden-Baden, becoming Poland's first-ever representative at that summit.

With her position untenable, Szyd≈Ço resigned, and Morawiecki quickly won internal party approval to be nominated as her successor. He was sworn in as Prime Minister of Poland on 11 December, immediately appointing Szyd≈Ço as his deputy. In his first major address to Sejm, he pledged ‚Äúcontinuity‚Äù rather than radical change.Micha≈Ç Broniatowski (December 12, 2017), Poland‚Äôs new PM won‚Äôt change anything after leadership swap Politico Europe. In January 2018, following a highly public racist incident in Warsaw, Morawiecki declared: \\"There is no place in Poland for racism. The attack on a girl because of her skin color deserves the strongest condemnation. We shall do everything to make Poland safe for everyone.\\" In early 2018, both chambers of the Polish parliament (the Sejm and Senate) adopted an Amendment to the Act on the Institute of National Remembrance criminalising the ascription to Poles collectively of complicity in World War II Jewish-genocide-related or other war crimes or crimes against humanity that had been committed by the Axis powers, and condemning use of the expression, \\"Polish death camp\\".

The crisis was resolved in late June that year when the Polish and Israeli prime ministers issued a joint communiqu√© endorsing research into the Jewish Holocaust and condemning the expression, \\"Polish concentration camps\\". In March 2018 a new Polish law took effect, banning nearly all commerce on Sundays, with supermarkets and most other retailers closed Sundays for the first time since liberal shopping laws were introduced in the 1990s. The law had been passed by the Law and Justice party with Morawiecki's support.https://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2018-03-11/most-stores- shut-in-poland-as-sunday-trade-ban-takes-effect Morawiecki with Pope Francis, Vatican City, June 2018 As other Visegr√°d Group leaders, Morawiecki opposes any compulsory EU long-term quota on redistribution of migrants. In May 2018, Morawiecki said: \\"Proposals by the European Union that impose quotas on us hit the very foundations of national sovereignty.\\" In July 2018 Morawiecki said he \\"will not rest\\" until \\"the whole truth\\" of the World War II-era massacres in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia have been explained. Between 1942 and 1945, members of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) killed up to 100,000 civilians in nowadays Western Ukraine. On the issue of Brexit, Morawiecki told the BBC in January 2019 that more and more Polish people are returning to Poland from the UK and he hoped the trend would continue to help boost the Polish economy. In January 2019 Morawiecki said that \\"Hitler's Germany fed on fascist ideology... But all the evil came from this (German) state and we cannot forget that, because otherwise we relativise evil.\\" Od 15 September 2020, Wojew√≥dzki sƒÖd administracyjny (administrative court) (:pl:Wojew√≥dzki sƒÖd administracyjny) in Warsaw ruled that the decision of Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki to hold the elections only by postal vote on 10 May 2020 was a \\"gross violation of the law and was issued without [legal] grounds\\" and violated article 7 of the Polish Constitution, article 157, paragraph 1 and article 187, paragraph 1 and 2 of the Electoral Code.

Her research has focused on how the innate immune system is able to recognise virus-infected cells and pathogens. Early life and education Ablasser was born in 1983 to a physician father and mathematician mother. She was born in Bad Friedrichshall and moved to Buchloe at the age of three, where her father was the chief physician at the Buchloer Hospital. She attended Gymnasiums in T√ºrkheim and Hohenschwangau, and was inspired by her father to study medicine at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU). She completed part of her studies at the University of Massachusetts and did part of her practical training at Harvard Medical School. When she finished her medical degree in 2008, she was ranked as one of the top ten students in Germany. Although she initially wanted to pursue oncology, she chose to write a doctoral thesis in the field of immunology, and received her doctorate from LMU in 2010. Career After completing her doctorate, Ablasser followed her thesis supervisor from LMU to the University of Bonn. She worked at the Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Pharmacology as the head of a junior research group. Her research focused on DNA sensors that allow the innate immune system to detect whether a cell is infected. She discovered a novel second messenger molecule that is produced by a particular DNA sensor and \\"alerts\\" nearby cells when it encounters a pathogen. In 2013, she was awarded the J√ºrgen Wehland Prize by the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research for her research on the mechanisms by which the innate immune system recognises pathogens, and specifically her identification of receptors and regulatory molecules that are activated in virally infected cells. In 2014, she won the Paul Ehrlich and Ludwig Darmstaedter Prize for Young Researchers and the German GlaxoSmithKline Foundation's \\"Medical Research\\" Science Award. In 2018 she was awarded the Eppendorf Award for Young European Investigators for her findings in innate immunity.

In 1912, he was elected as Junior General Secretary of the YMA, moving to Barnsley to work full-time in the post. John Wadsworth, the general secretary, became ill, and Roebuck effectively filled the post, and was unanimously elected to it in 1923, following Wadsworth's death. Roebuck also represented the YMA on the Miners' Federation of Great Britain, and unsuccessfully stood to become its general secretary in 1919. He also served on Wombwell Urban District Council from 1904 to 1907. He was selected as the Labour Party candidate for Doncaster at the general election expected in 1914, but after the outbreak of World War I, he stood down. He increasingly suffered poor health, and died in 1924.

The settlement was probably founded in the late 2nd or in the early 3rd century AD, and continued to be populated until the 4th century AD. Its well preserved ruins can be seen near the present-day village Bradashesh, right next to the SH7 road. The site was extensively excavated around 1968 which uncovered a fine Roman villa and a remarkably well-preserved thermae (bathhouse) taking advantage of the abundant springs nearby. The bathhouse consists of five main rooms. At the eastern end there is an apsed exedra that was used as a dining room. This connects to the small rectangular cold plunge-bath. The apodyterium (undressing room) also survived with fine paintings and frescoes on its walls. Further to the western end of the building the ruins of the laconicum (heated sweating room) can be seen with the traces of the hypocaust (underfloor heating), along with the adjacent praefernium (furnace).

For example, the word 'penguin' is typically learned at a younger age than the word 'albatros'. Studies in psycholinguistics suggest that age of acquisition has an effect on the speed of reading words. It is a particularly strong variable in predicting the speed of picture naming. It has been generally found that words that are more frequent, shorter, more familiar and refer to concrete concepts are learned earlier than more complex words. Norms Sets of normative values for age of acquisition for large sets of words have been developed. * Kuperman, Stadthagen-Gonzalez, and Brysbaert * Gilhooly and Logie. * Morrison et al. Relation to other variables It has been disputed whether age of acquisition has an effect on word tasks on its own or by virtue of its covariance with other variables such as word frequency. Alternatively, it has been suggested that the age of acquisition is related to the fact that an earlier learned word has been encountered more often. These issues were partially resolved in an article by Ghyselinck, Lewis and Brysbaert. Alternatively there have been discussions of the effect that the age of acquisition has on learning a second language.

The shop was founded in 1909, and was a father and son operation run by Francis Riddell Henderson, formerly the London representative of Walter Scott Publishing. The shop was bought by Eva Collet Reckitt, and became the first of the Collet's chain of left-wing bookshops. Shop Few records exist of Francis Henderson's early life, but he had connections with Russian √©migr√©s and developed a passion for Russian literature, especially the works of Tolstoy. This drew him into the circle of Vladimir Chertkov, a prominent Tolstoyan and a pacifist anarchist, and from there into London's radical scene. Henderson demanded that Walter Scott publish Louise Maude's translation of the Tolstoy novel Resurrection in the public domain with the legend \\"no rights reserved\\" ‚Äì when Walter Scott refused, Henderson left to start his own printing press which developed into a bookshop for radical writing. The advertising potential of the shop's nickname was quickly recognised, and both adverts and imprints proudly bear the text 'The Bomb Shop'. This boldness extended to the shop itself, which was painted in a red and gold Arts and Crafts style by Walter Crane and prominently featured the names of past rebels ‚Äì a target for vandals politically opposed to the Bomb Shop, who would repaint it in blue and white and sometimes break in and destroy the interior. There were many rooms above Henderson's, and these proved to be excellent hiding places for fugitives. The suffragist Hugh Franklin hid out at Henderson's for two months after setting fire to a railway carriage in protest for women's suffrage. The shop also proved to be radical in its acceptance of technology. The first Penguincubator, an early book vending machine developed by Allen Lane of Penguin Books, was installed at the shop. Publications Russian Ballet by David Bomberg was published by Henderson's. Henderson's publishing press began when Francis Henderson took over the Brotherhood Publishing Company (an organisation run by the Brotherhood Church). In Henderson's hands, the Brotherhood's profits and donations became a source of income to fund his own imprints. Henderson claimed his press ran at significant losses due to his copyright-waiver, but his refusal to pay authors their royalties or to repay the Maudes' loans to the press caused significant trouble in the Tolstoyan community and fed the growing schism surrounding Chertkov.Carol L. Peaker (2007), Ibid., page 191‚Äì193 Henderson eventually lost the rights to Maude's translation of Resurrection, and Chertkov took greater control over Tolstoyan publishing. Self-publishing through Henderson's provided an outlet for suppressed voices and for many respected writers who were unable to publish their more radical writing through their usual channels. Authors published by Henderson's include Miles Malleson, who wrote Cranks and Commonsense in defence of conscientious objection as well as Two Short Plays: Patriotic and Unpatriotic, which was later confiscated by the police in a raid in 1916; Osbert Sitwell, whose first poetry collection The Winstonburg Line was submitted to Henderson's by Siegfried Sassoon; Louis Golding and Louis Esson. Outside the world of politics, Henderson's also contributed to the then-burgeoning modernist movement through publishing the periodical Coterie, a quarterly journal of poetry, prose, literary criticism and art from authors and artists including T. S. Eliot, Aldous Huxley, Amy Lowell, Richard Aldington, Douglas Goldring, Edward Wadsworth, William Roberts, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, Andr√© Derain, Amedeo Modigliani, Nina Hamnett, and Mo√Øse Kisling, as well as publishing Thomas Moult's Voices anthologies. Russian Ballet by David Bomberg, the only surviving Vorticist book, was published by Henderson's after Bomberg and his wife were expelled from a performance of Ballets Russes for attempting to sell a self-published edition. Henderson's had close ties to the publisher Victor Gollancz, under whom the Repton school newspaper A Public School Looks at the World (generally known as Pubbers) was co-published by and sold at Henderson's ‚Äì an act that cost Gollancz his job. Gollancz went on to be founder of the left-leaning publishing house Victor Gollancz Ltd, and later described Henderson's book selection thus: References Bookshops in London Independent bookshops of the United Kingdom Anarchism in the United Kingdom Literary modernism Defunct book publishing companies Publishing companies of the United Kingdom Small press publishing companies Bookstores established in the 20th century 1909 establishments in England 1934 disestablishments in England Retail companies established in 1909 British companies established in 1909 British companies disestablished in 1934 Publishing companies established in 1909 ","title":"Henderson's"},{"id":"48505587","text":"E.

He was appointed an OBE in 1964 and the Esher Award in 1974 for his contribution to the repair of historic buildings. Early life and education Macgregor was born in Chiswick, London. He was the son of Archibald Macgregor, an artist in the pre-Raphaelite tradition. His mother Ellen Macgregor (n√©e Miers), was an active suffragist and political candidate for Bedford Park, London establishing one of the first infant welfare centres at Ravenscourt House in Hammersmith, London. The family lived at Stamford Brook House, London with Macgregor‚Äôs two brothers, Alex and Norman. Macgregor attended Westminster School from age 14 to 17 years. He suffered from undiagnosed dyslexia, which held him back academically with the result that he had to repeat a year. School worship at Westminster Abbey inspired Macgregor to train as an architect. His difficulty with conventional learning had hidden benefits and he became a master of lateral thinking, often coming up with unconventional and innovative ways to solve architectural problems.  Career  Macgregor trained with Fred Rowntree & Sons in Hammersmith Terrace, where he developed an interest in modern functional architecture, before studying for two years with the Architectural Association. Macgregor‚Äôs talent was spotted early on and at the age of 22 he was employed by William Weir, with whom he shared lodgings, to help rebuild and repair Tattershall Castle. The experience laid the foundations for Macgregor‚Äôs conservation career. The Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings regularly employed him to survey properties and oversee their repair and it was through them that he was recommended to the National Trust. In 1931 he surveyed Shalford Mill in Surrey for the eccentric group of women philanthropists, Ferguson‚Äôs Gang who endowed the watermill to the National Trust in 1932. He supervised the repair of the building and after converting half of the watermill into residential quarters the Macgregor‚Äôs leased it as their weekend home. Ferguson‚Äôs Gang had their headquarters in one room of the mill. They employed Macgregor for two further conservation projects, Newtown Old Town Hall on the Isle of Wight and Priory Cottages in Oxfordshire. A celebrated member of their Gang, he was more to them than simply an architect and given the name of the ‚ÄòArtichoke‚Äô. One moonlit night in 1935, Macgregor and his friend the independent reformist MP, A. P. Herbert took members of the Gang on Herbert‚Äôs barge The Water Gypsy down the River Thames to collect water samples from the underground tributaries of the Thames. The samples collected in five cut-glass water bottles are kept at Shalford Mill today. Macgregror mentored architects and surveyors in conservation through the SPAB‚Äôs Scholarship Scheme, and became chairman of its technical panel. He illustrated Repair of Ancient Buildings, written by his business partner A. R. Powys (Secretary of the SPAB). Macgregor‚Äôs contribution to the repair of historic buildings includes well known buildings such as Tattershall Castle in Lincolnshire, Montacute House in Somerset, William Hogarth‚Äôs house in Chiswick as well as many lesser known buildings such as St Paul‚Äôs Saxon church in Elsted, Sussex. He designed modern buildings to sit comfortably alongside historic houses such as the Squash Court at Rivercourt House, Upper Mall, Hammersmith and designed a radical ziggurat style social housing block, Lennox House in Bethnal Green, London, in 1934, both of which are now Grade II listed.  First World War Service and Family Life  Macgregor joined the Artists' Rifles and fought in northern France until 1917 when he was demobbed after being gassed. The following year, Macgregor married Janet Udale in 1918. They set up home in a derelict Georgian house at 7 St Peter‚Äôs Square in Chiswick, West London which he repaired. They had four daughters: Janet Ellen in 1919, Penelope in 1921, and twins Joanna and Sally in 1926. The Macgregors were part of a flourishing artistic and socially minded community. Janet Macgregor worked with her mother-in-law Ellen Macgregor in child and family welfare and produced plays with the writer Naomi Mitchison at the Mercury Theatre, Notting Hill to raise funds for family planning. They put on plays by the wit and writer G. K. Chesterton in the garden of Stamford Brook House and co-hosted debates with the artists Lucien Pissarro and Esther Pissarro who lived next door.  Second World War  In 1942 Macgregor wrote several articles for the Builder magazine (now called Building), illustrating his ideas for an innovative post-war transport infrastructure across London. Macgregor drafted plans for the post-war reconstruction of major cities and advised the War Damage Commission. He identified the need to record and list damaged historic buildings instigating an ad hoc committee with William Ansell, then President of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), art historian, Sir Kenneth Mckenzie Clark and architect Walter Godfrey, who became first director of the National Buildings Record, now the English Heritage Archive. Macgregor was made a Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects (FRIBA). His daughter Penelope Adamson practiced alongside her father and both received the Esher Award for advancing the cause of building conservation.

Because of its location, the area has, for centuries, been a buffer zone between the great powers of Europe. In 1994, as the first national park in Austria, it received a category II label from the IUCN.  Description  The area of the national park is a meeting point for different plant and animal species. These include alpine, pannonian, asian, mediterranean and northern European species. This results in a mosaic of environments, including wetlands, herding meadows, meadows, sand steppes and salt areas. In the west the area is bordered by the Leitha Mountains, the Parndorf Plain in the north and the Hans√°g in the east. The mire of Hans√°g was for centuries a part of Lake Neusiedl.

He married Bettie South (Phyllis Hall) in December 1941 when he was 28, shortly after he was posted to the Far East during the Second World War and did then not see Bettie for over four years until the war ended in 1945. Service Winter joined the Army in 1936, first serving in Malta. During the Second World War Winter experienced his first action in Norway in 1940.

It follows the rise and fall of journalist Camille Desmoulins, who launches the Revolution and is eventually sent to the guillotine. Synopsis During a night out at the bar, struggling writer Camille Desmoulins hears that the popular finance minister Jacques Necker has been dismissed from office. At Georges Danton's behest, Camille stands on a table and tells the people of the Third Estate to rise against the monarch of France, King Louis XVI. The people of the Third Estate storm the Bastille and the French Revolution begins. Camille is in love with a noble 19-year-old girl, Lucile Duplessis, whose father will not allow them to be together. Camille writes pro-revolutionary newspapers and pamphlets with Comte de Mirabeau as his benefactor, but soon begins writing pamphlets criticizing Mirabeau. Drunk on wine, Camille tries to convince Lucile's father to let them wed, and after Camille is put on trial for his writings and saved by Maximilien Robespierre, Lucile's father agrees to the marriage. Mirabeau gets sick and dies. Camille writes an article questioning Mirabeau's death and his methods. He and Danton lead the people to Champ de Mars, fighting with the National Guard. Camille learns that Lucile is pregnant and Camille runs off to live in the country. Danton sends him a letter, asking him to return and help rebuild Paris. Anarchy breaks out over a bread shortage; the people blame the King. The people break into the King's palace and capture him; learning of Louis' capture, Prussia send troops into France. Hotel de Ville becomes a battleground and the people drive the Prussians out of the country. Riots erupt as the people purge traitors and anti-revolutionists. Danton creates The Committee of General Defense to arrest and try anti-revolutionist, who are beheaded by the guillotine, a symbol for the Reign of Terror. Robespierre denounces the acts of the revolution. He has the heads of the committee of general defense step down and becomes the head of the renamed Committee of Public Safety. Camille begins to distrusts Robespierre; his feeling is confirmed when Robespierre takes down those whom he deems a threat. Camille wants an end to the revolution. Robespierre tells Camille of his plans to become France's new king, which Camille protests. Camille writes an article asking for moderation and an end to beheadings; he is promptly arrested along with Danton and other Dantonists. All are tried by the Revolutionary Tribunal, found guilty, and sent to the guillotine; Lucile is guillotined. In the months following, Robespierre and his friends are also guillotined. Background and writing process Tanith Lee began writing The Gods Are Thirsty in 1982, and finished her first draft in the beginning of 1985. This was her only book that she wrote multiple drafts on. She got inspired to write this book because Lee watched a play on the television called Danton's Death, which covered Georges Jacques Danton's trial and death. She also read about a newspaperman who was intimately associated with both Danton and Maximilien Robespierre. However, people said it would be a poor decision because it was too horrible so she held off on writing it for a while. When she actually got around to writing the novel in a diary style, she put much effort into researching the French Revolution. Tanith wanted to make the characters seem like actors. She focused more on Camille Desmoulins because he was the link between the two main figures of the French Revolution, Robespierre and Danton. Desmoulins had a love story to tie into it as well with Lucile Duplessis. Finally, Desmoulins is one of the unknown characters in the Revolution, so Tanith Lee wanted to bring awareness to the importance of his actions. One of Lee's difficulties was that the characters were not fictional and the ending of her book had already been written by history, contrary to her usual strategy of knowing characters first and letting plots proceed from their interactions. Critical reception Critics agreed that the Gods Are Thirsty was beautifully written despite Tanith Lee's inexperience with historical fiction.Michele Lieber.

He was Minister of PTT and then Minister of Health in 1938, and Minister of Commerce from 1938 to 1940. In the period before World War II (1939‚Äì45) began he first opposed and then supported letting refugees from Nazi Germany work freely in France. In the early part of the war he promoted continued production of luxury goods to earn money for import of armaments. After the defeat of France, he collaborated with the German occupiers as administrator and political director of a newspaper. He was banned from public office after the Liberation of France. Early years (1876‚Äì1932) Fernand Gentin was born on 27 September 1876 in Reims, Marne, son of a printer. Gentin completed his education at the age of 20. He worked at the printing shop for a period, then spent ten years working among peasants before succeeding his father in the family business. He was president and chairman of the Grande Imprimerie de Troyes. Gentin became vice chairman of the General Council of the Aube. National politics (1932‚Äì40) In May 1932 Gentin ran for election in the 3rd district of Troyes, and was elected in the second round. He was elected on 8 May 1932 as deputy for Aube on the Radical Republican and Radical Socialist list. He became mayor of Isle-Aumont and Chairman of the General Council of the Aube. In April 1936 ran again and was reelected in the second round for the same constituency. He was reelected on 3 May 1936 as deputy for Aube on the Radical Republican and Radical Socialist list. He defeated the conservative Fernand Monsacr√© and the socialist Pierre Brossolette. The Radicals had agreed not to oppose Ren√© Plard in the 1st district of Troyes, and in return Gentin was supported by the Amis du Rappel. Gentin was Minister of Posts, Telegraphs, and Telephones from 18 January 1938 to 13 March 1938 in the 4th cabinet of Camille Chautemps. He was Minister of Health from 13 March 1938 to 10 April 1938 in the 2nd cabinet of L√©on Blum. He was Minister of Commerce from 10 April 1938 to 20 March 1940 in the cabinet of √âdouard Daladier. At the annual Radical Party congress in Marseille at the end of October 1938 Gentin proposed a modern economic plan with partial funding from the state. The plan was approved by the delegates, but two days later Paul Reynaud took office as Minister of Finance and rejected the plan. With the economy still depressed, in the late 1930s there were popular demands for measures to prevent Jewish and other refugees from Nazi Germany from competing with native French people. On 17 June 1938 Gentin announced a decree that limited the right of foreigners to engage in commerce. The local chambers of commerce had to agree that a foreign-owned enterprise was \\"desirable\\", and could limit the number of foreigners who could work in some commercial occupations. With the growing threat of war in 1939, Gentin changed his position on refugees. He sponsored the 21 April 1939 \\"Decree to Favor the Establishment in France of Industries of National Interest\\", which had resulted from lobbying by Louise Weiss and the Bonnet Committee. This would remove constraints on foreign entrepreneurs and skilled technicians, particularly those who could assist in the war industry. He wrote, \\"we first of all want to make known the desire of France to facilitate the establishment on its soil of industries likely to increase in times of peace its power for expansion, and in times of war its capacity for resistance. During World War II (1939‚Äì45), in October 1939 Gentin said that manufacturing for the military should not be allowed to affect production of luxury goods, since the profits from exports would offset the cost of war material imports. He said, \\"It is essential that we continue manufacturing export goods so that we hang on to our customers ... for when the war is over.\\" This reflected a belief that France had strong defenses but a weak economy, the opposite of the view of the military leaders. Gentin visited London at the end of January 1940 and surprised his hosts by asking for removal of all obstacles to trade between Britain and France. This resulted in a broad agreement signed on 16 February 1940. Gentin repeated to a parliamentary committee in February 1940 that France should not give up manufacture of civilian products for export in response to an exaggerated demand for the manufacture of armaments. Vichy France and aftermath (1940‚Äì46) After the defeat of France, on 10 July 1940 Gentin voted in favor of granting the constitutional powers requested by Marshal Philippe P√©tain. Gentin was retained by the Vichy government as mayor of Isle-Aumont during the German occupation of France, and continued to run his printing house. He also administered and gave political direction to Le Petit Troyen. He submitted to German demands that he publish their communiqu√©s, and that the paper follow their approved line. The paper was later described as \\"a clearly collaborationist organ, as much as any Paris daily\\". His motives may have been as much financial as ideological. It was said at his trial, \\"M. Gentin derived from his functions as political director substantial pecuniary advantages, and he also maneuvered as administrator to profit from the particular conditions created by the German occupation. This was how he increased his financial participation in the company's capital.\\" Due to his attitude during the occupation Gentin was arrested in December 1944 and tried by the Aube court of justice. On 24 January 1945 the court acquitted him of the charge of endangering the security of the state, but condemned him to ten years of national degradation for collaboration. On 10 July 1945, due to the previous court decision and on the basis that he was administrator and political director of a newspaper that put itself at the service of the enemy, a Jury of Honor confirmed his ineligibility for public office caused by his vote on 10 July 1940. Fernand Gentin died on 24 April 1946 in Paris.

He received in 1882 from the Sorbonne his Ph.D. with dissertation Recherches sur les int√©grales alg√©briques des √©quations differentielles √† coefficients rationnels, with Charles Hermite as chair of the thesis committee. The dissertation was based on research initiated by Camille Jordan. An 1891 article by Autonne in the Comptes rendus de l'Acad√©mie des Sciences de Paris is one of the earliest uses of the concept of Lie groups (as groups of Monsieur Lie). Autonne won the Prix Dalmont in 1894. He was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1897, 1900, 1904 and 1908.

In 2015, over was raised worldwide by crowdfunding. Although similar concepts can also be executed through mail-order subscriptions, benefit events, and other methods, the term crowdfunding refers to Internet-mediated registries.; The Merriam Webster Dictionary defines crowdfunding as \\"the practice of soliciting financial contributions from a large number of people especially from the online community\\" This modern crowdfunding model is generally based on three types of actors: the project initiator who proposes the idea or project to be funded, individuals or groups who support the idea, and a moderating organization (the \\"platform\\") that brings the parties together to launch the idea. Crowdfunding has been used to fund a wide range of for-profit, entrepreneurial ventures such as artistic and creative projects, medical expenses, travel, and community-oriented social entrepreneurship projects.Gleasure, R., & Feller, J. (2016). Emerging technologies and the democratisation of financial services: A metatriangulation of crowdfunding research. Information and Organization, 26(4), 101-115. Even though crowdfunding has been suggested to be highly linked to sustainability, empirical validation has shown that sustainability plays only a fractional role in crowdfunding. Its use has also been criticised for funding quackery, especially costly and fraudulent cancer treatments.  History  A printed receipt 135 x 97 mm issued between 1850 and 1857 to support the French philosopher Auguste Comte Crowdfunding has a long history with several roots. Books have been crowdfunded for centuries: authors and publishers would advertise book projects in praenumeration or subscription schemes. The book would be written and published if enough subscribers signaled their readiness to buy the book once it was out. The subscription business model is not exactly crowdfunding, since the actual flow of money only begins with the arrival of the product. The list of subscribers has, though, the power to create the necessary confidence among investors that is needed to risk the publication. War bonds are theoretically a form of crowdfunding military conflicts. London's mercantile community saved the Bank of England in the 1730s when customers demanded their pounds to be converted into gold - they supported the currency until confidence in the pound was restored, thus crowdfunded their own money. A clearer case of modern crowdfunding is Auguste Comte's scheme to issue notes for the public support of his further work as a philosopher. The \\"Premi√®re Circulaire Annuelle adress√©e par l'auteur du Syst√®me de Philosophie Positive\\" was published on 14 March 1850, and several of these notes, blank and with sums have survived. The cooperative movement of the 19th and 20th centuries is a broader precursor. It generated collective groups, such as community or interest-based groups, pooling subscribed funds to develop new concepts, products, and means of distribution and production, particularly in rural areas of Western Europe and North America. In 1885, when government sources failed to provide funding to build a monumental base for the Statue of Liberty, a newspaper-led campaign attracted small donations from 160,000 donors. Crowdfunding on the internet first gained popular and mainstream use in the arts and music communities. The first noteworthy instance of online crowdfunding in the music industry was in 1997, when fans of the British rock band Marillion raised US$60,000 in donations by means of an Internet campaign to underwrite an entire U.S. tour. The band subsequently used this method to fund their studio albums. This built on the success of crowdfunding via magazines, such as the 1992 campaign by the Vegan Society that crowdfunded the production of the \\"Truth or Dairy\\" video documentary. In the film industry, independent writer/director Mark Tapio Kines designed a website in 1997 for his then-unfinished first feature film Foreign Correspondents. By early 1999, he had raised more than US$125,000 on the Internet from at least 25 fans, providing him with the funds to complete his film. In 2002, the \\"Free Blender\\" campaign was an early software crowdfunding precursor.Blender Foundation Launches Campaign to Open Blender Source on linuxtoday (July 22, 2002)'Free Blender Fund' campaign archived 2002 The campaign aimed for open-sourcing the Blender 3D computer graphics software by collecting ‚Ç¨100,000 from the community while offering additional benefits for donating members.Membership People can subscribe to become Foundation Member. Members who subscribe during the campaign period, get additional benefits for their support. During campaign: - Costs: minimum one time fee of 50 euros (or US$50) (archived 2002) The first company to engage in this business model was the U.S. website ArtistShare (2001). As the model matured, more crowdfunding sites started to appear on the web such as Kiva (2005), IndieGoGo (2008), Kickstarter (2009), GoFundMe (2010), Microventures (2010), and YouCaring (2011). The phenomenon of crowdfunding is older than the term \\"crowdfunding\\". According to wordspy.com, the earliest recorded use of the word was in August 2006. Types The Crowdfunding Centre's May 2014 report identified two primary types of crowdfunding: # Rewards crowdfunding: entrepreneurs presell a product or service to launch a business concept without incurring debt or sacrificing equity/shares. # Equity crowdfunding: the backer receives shares of a company, usually in its early stages, in exchange for the money pledged. Reward-based Reward-based crowdfunding has been used for a wide range of purposes, including motion picture promotion, free software development, inventions development, scientific research, and civic projects. Many characteristics of rewards-based crowdfunding, also called non-equity crowdfunding, have been identified by research studies. In rewards-based crowdfunding, funding does not rely on location. The distance between creators and investors on Sellaband was about 3,000 miles when the platform introduced royalty sharing. The funding for these projects is distributed unevenly, with a few projects accounting for the majority of overall funding. Additionally, funding increases as a project nears its goal, encouraging what is called \\"herding behavior\\". Research also shows that friends and family account for a large, or even majority, portion of early fundraising. This capital may encourage subsequent funders to invest in the project. While funding does not depend on location, observation shows that funding is largely tied to the locations of traditional financing options. In reward-based crowdfunding, funders are often too hopeful about project returns and must revise expectations when returns are not met. Equity Equity crowdfunding is the collective effort of individuals to support efforts initiated by other people or organizations through the provision of finance in the form of equity. (also available as Scribd document) In the United States, legislation that is mentioned in the 2012 JOBS Act will allow for a wider pool of small investors with fewer restrictions following the implementation of the act. Unlike nonequity crowdfunding, equity crowdfunding contains heightened \\"information asymmetries\\". The creator must not only produce the product for which they are raising capital, but also create equity through the construction of a company. Equity crowdfunding, unlike donation and rewards-based crowdfunding, involves the offer of securities which include the potential for a return on investment. Syndicates, which involve many investors following the strategy of a single lead investor, can be effective in reducing information asymmetry and in avoiding the outcome of market failure associated with equity crowdfunding. Software value token Another kind of crowdfunding is to raise funds for a project where a digital or software-based value token is offered as a reward to funders which is known as Initial coin offering (abbreviated to ICO). Value tokens are endogenously created by particular open decentralized networks that are used to incentivize client computers of the network to expend scarce computer resources on maintaining the protocol network. These value tokens may or may not exist at the time of the crowdsale, and may require substantial development effort and eventual software release before the token is live and establishes a market value. Although funds may be raised simply for the value token itself, funds raised on blockchain-based crowdfunding can also represent equity, bonds, or even \\"market-maker seats of governance\\" for the entity being funded. Examples of such crowdsales are Augur decentralized, distributed prediction market software which raised from more than 3500 participants; Ethereum blockchain; and \\"The DAO.\\" Debt-based Debt-based crowdfunding, (also known as \\"peer to peer\\", \\"P2P\\", \\"marketplace lending\\", or \\"crowdlending\\") arose with the founding of Zopa in the UK in 2005Ian Fraser for Unquoted.

Updated June 22, 2015 Borrowers apply online, generally for free, and their application is reviewed and verified by an automated system, which also determines the borrower's credit risk and interest rate. Investors buy securities in a fund which makes the loans to individual borrowers or bundles of borrowers. Investors make money from interest on the unsecured loans; the system operators make money by taking a percentage of the loan and a loan servicing fee. In 2009, institutional investors entered the P2P lending arena; for example in 2013, Google invested $125 million in Lending Club. In 2014 in the US, P2P lending totalled about $5 billion.Bill Payne for Gust. May 4th, 2015 US Crowdfunding in 2014 In 2014 in the UK, P2P platforms lent businesses ¬£749 million, a growth of 250% from 2012 to 2014, and lent retail customers ¬£547 million, a growth of 108% from 2012 to 2014. In both countries in 2014, about 75% of all the money transferred through crowdfunding went through P2P platforms. Lending Club went public in December 2014 at a valuation around $9 billion. Litigation Litigation crowdfunding allows plaintiffs or defendants to reach out to hundreds of their peers simultaneously in a semiprivate and confidential manner to obtain funding, either seeking donations or providing a reward in return for funding. It also allows investors to purchase a stake in a claim they have funded, which may allow them to get back more than their investment if the case succeeds (the reward is based on the compensation received by the litigant at the end of his or her case, known as a contingent fee in the United States, a success fee in the United Kingdom, or a pactum de quota litis in many civil law systems). LexShares is a platform that allows accredited investors to invest in lawsuits. Donation-based Running alongside reward-based crowdfunding, donation-based is second as the most commonly used form of crowdfunding. Donation-based crowdfunding is the collective effort of individuals to help charitable causes. In donation-based crowdfunding, funds are raised for religious, social environmental, or other purposes. Donors come together to create an online community around a common cause to help fund services and programs to combat a variety of issues including healthcare and community development. The major aspect of donor- based crowdfunding is that there is no reward for donating; rather, it is based on the donor's altruistic reasoning. Ethical concerns have been raised to the increasing popularity of donation-based crowdfunding, which can be affected by fraudulent campaigns and privacy issues.  Role  The inputs of the individuals in the crowd trigger the crowdfunding process and influence the ultimate value of the offerings or outcomes of the process. Each individual acts as an agent of the offering, selecting and promoting the projects in which they believe. They sometimes play a donor role oriented towards providing help on social projects. In some cases, they become shareholders and contribute to the development and growth of the offering. Individuals disseminate information about projects they support in their online communities, generating further support (promoters). The motivation for consumer participation stems from the feeling of being at least partly responsible for the success of others people's initiatives (desire for patronage), striving to be a part of a communal social initiative (desire for social participation), and seeking a payoff from monetary contributions (desire for investment). Additionally, individuals participate in crowdfunding to see new and innovative products before the public. Early access often allows funders to participate more directly in the development of the product. Crowdfunding is also particularly attractive to funders who are family and friends of a creator. It helps to mediate the terms of their financial agreement and manage each group's expectations for the project. An individual who takes part in crowdfunding initiatives tends to have several distinct traits: innovative orientation, which stimulates the desire to try new modes of interacting with firms and other consumers; social identification with the content, cause, or project selected for funding, which sparks the desire to be a part of the initiative; (monetary) exploitation, which motivates the individual to participate by expecting a payoff. Crowdfunding platforms are motivated to generate income by drawing worthwhile projects and generous funders. These sites also seek widespread public attention for their projects and platform. Crowdfunding websites helped companies and individuals worldwide raise US$89 million from members of the public in 2010, $1.47 billion in 2011, and $2.66 billion in 2012 ‚Äî $1.6 billion of the 2012 amount was raised in North America.Global Crowdfunding Volumes Rise 81% In 2012, August 4, 2013, The Huffington Post, Retrieved at September 7, 2013 Crowdfunding is expected to reach US$1 trillion in 2025.The Rise of Crowdfunding October 28, 2015, MyPrivateBanking Research A May 2014 report, released by the United Kingdom- based The Crowdfunding Centre and titled \\"The State of the Crowdfunding Nation\\", presented data showing that during March 2014, more than US$60,000 were raised on an hourly basis via global crowdfunding initiatives. Also during this period, 442 crowdfunding campaigns were launched globally on a daily basis.  Platforms  In 2015, it was predicted that there would be over 2,000 crowdfunding sites to choose from in 2016. Fundamental differences exist in the services provided by many crowdfunding platforms. Curated crowdfunding platforms serve as \\"network orchestrators\\" by curating the offerings that are allowed on the platform. They create the necessary organizational systems and conditions for resource integration among other players to take place. Relational mediators act as an intermediary between supply and demand. They replace traditional intermediaries (such as traditional record companies, venture capitalists). These platforms link new artists, designers, project initiators with committed supporters who believe in the persons behind the projects strongly enough to provide monetary support. Growth engines focus on the strong inclusion of investors. They \\"disintermediate\\" by eliminating the activity of a service provider previously involved in the network. The platforms that use crowdfunding to seek stakes from a community of high net-worth private investors and match them directly with project initiators. Significant campaigns=Crowdfunding for Statue of Liberty In the summer of 1885, crowdfunding diverted a crisis that threatened the completion of the Statue of Liberty. Construction of the statue‚Äôs pedestal stalled due to a lack of financing. Fundraising efforts for the project fell short of the necessary amount by more than a third. New York Governor Grover Cleveland refused to appropriate city funds toward the project, and Congress could not agree on a funding package. Recognizing the social and symbolic significance of the statue, publisher Joseph Pulitzer came to the rescue by launching a five-month fundraising campaign in his newspaper The World. The paper solicited contributions by publishing articles that appealed to the emotions of New Yorkers. Donations of all sizes poured in, ranging anywhere from $0.15 to $250. More than 160,000 people across America gave including businessmen, waiters, children, and politicians. The paper chronicled each donation, published letters from contributors on the front page, and kept a running tally of funds raised. The campaign raised over $100,000 (roughly $2 million today) allowing the city to complete construction of the pedestal. Pulitzer and The World simultaneously saved the Statue of Liberty and gave birth to crowdfunding in American politics.  Early campaigns  Marillion started crowdfunding in 1997. Fans of the British rock band raised $60,000 (¬£39,000) via the internet to help finance a North American tour. The Professional Contractors Group, a trade body representing freelancers in the UK, raised ¬£100,000 over a two-week period in 1999 from some 2000 freelancers threatened by a Government measure known as IR35. In 2003, jazz composer Maria Schneider (musician) launched the first crowdfunding campaign on ArtistShare for a new recording. The recording was funded by her fans and became the first recording in history to win a Grammy Award without being available in retail stores. Oliver Twisted (Erik Estrada, Karen Black) was an early crowdfunded film. https://www.newspapers.com/clip/60902901/now- this-is-known-as-crowd-funding/ Subscribers of The Blue Sheet formed The Florida Film Investment Co (FFI) in January 1995, and started selling shares of stock at $10 a share to fund the $80,000 - $100,000 film. The Movie was filmed in Oct 1996. The film was distributed by RGH/Lion's Shares Pictures https://varietyultimate.com/archive/pdf/1064660.pdf#navpanes=0&toolbar;=0&messages;=0&statusbar;=0 In 2004, Electric Eel Shock, a Japanese rock band, raised ¬£10,000 from 100 fans (the Samurai 100) by offering them a lifetime membership on the band's guestlist. Two years later, they became the fastest band to raise a US$50,000 budget on SellaBand. Franny Armstrong later created a donation system for her feature film The Age of Stupid. Over five years, from June 2004 to June 2009 (release date), she raised ¬£1,500,000. In December 2004, French entrepreneurs and producers Benjamin Pommeraud and Guillaume Colboc, launched a public Internet donation campaign to fund their short science fiction film, Demain la Veille (Waiting for Yesterday). Within a month, they managed to raise ‚Ç¨17,000 online, allowing them to shoot their film. Highest-grossing campaigns As of late 2019 the highest reported funding by a crowdfunded project to date is Star Citizen, an online space trading and combat video game being developed by Chris Roberts and Cloud Imperium Games; it has raised over $254M to date, and while it has a devoted fan base criticism has arisen for being a potential scam. Kickstarter campaigns On April 17, 2014, the Guardian media outlet published a list of \\"20 of the most significant projects\\" launched on the Kickstarter platform prior to the date of publication, including: Musician Amanda Palmer raised US$1.2 million from 24,883 backers in June 2012 to make a new album and art book. Other campaigns include: *The \\"Coolest Cooler\\" raised a total of $13,285,226 from 62,642 backers in July 2014 in a campaign run by Funded Today. The cooler features a blender, waterproof Bluetooth speakers and an LED light. *Zack Brown raised $55,000 from over 6,900 backers in September 2014 to make a bowl of potato salad. Noteworthy is that his initial goal was only $10, but his campaign went viral and got a lot of attention. Brown ended up throwing a potato salad party with over 3,000 pounds of potatoes. Kickstarter has been used to successfully revive or launch television and film projects that could not get funding elsewhere. These are the current record holders for projects in the \\"film\\"  # Critical Role raised a total of $11,385,449 with 88,887 backers in April 2019 to make an animated TV show based on their Twitch live-streamed Dungeons & Dragons game. Not only did the campaign exceed the $750,000 goal but the campaign also broke the Kickstarter record for most money raised for projects in the \\"film\\" category. # Mystery Science Theater 3000 raised a total of $5,764,229 with 48,270 backers in December 2015 to create fourteen episodes of the new series, including a holiday special. # Veronica Mars raised a total of $5,702,153 with 91,585 backers in March 2013 to create a film set nine years after the end of the TV show. In the campaign's first 12 hours of existence, it became the fastest Kickstarter campaign to reach both $1 million and $2 million and it held onto the record of highest in the \\"film\\" category until Mystery Science Theater 3000 beat it in 2015.  Applications  Crowdfunding is being explored as a potential funding mechanism for creative work such as blogging and journalism, music, independent film (see crowdfunded film), and for funding startup companies.TechCrunch \\"Sponsume lets projects get off the ground with Groupon-style group funding model\\"Crowdfunding Rules Could Create Mini-Disclosure Regime WSJ/CFO Journal, October 24, 2013 Emily Chasan Community music labels are usually for-profit organizations where \\"fans assume the traditional financier role of a record label for artists they believe in by funding the recording process\\".Kappel, Tim, \\"Ex Ante Crowdfunding and the Recording Industry: A Model for the U.S.?\\" in Loyola of Los Angeles Entertainment Law Review, Vol.29, Issue 3, p.376 Since pioneering crowdfunding in the film industry, Spanner Films has published a \\"how-to\\" guide. A Financialist article published in mid-September 2013 stated that \\"the niche for crowdfunding exists in financing films with budgets in the [US]$1 to $10 million range\\" and crowdfunding campaigns are \\"much more likely to be successful if they tap into a significant pre-existing fan base and fulfill an existing gap in the market.\\" Innovative new platforms, such as RocketHub, have emerged that combine traditional funding for creative work with branded crowdsourcing‚Äîhelping artists and entrepreneurs unite with brands \\"without the need for a middle man.\\"Bell, Melissa. \\"Crowd-sourcing a brand\\", The Washington Post, March 12, 2011, accessed September 3, 2011.  Philanthropy and civic projects  A variety of crowdfunding platforms have emerged to allow ordinary web users to support specific philanthropic projects without the need for large amounts of money. GlobalGiving allows individuals to browse through a selection of small projects proposed by nonprofit organizations worldwide, donating funds to projects of their choice. Microcredit crowdfunding platforms such as Kiva (organization) facilitate crowdfunding of loans managed by microcredit organizations in developing countries. The US-based nonprofit Zidisha applies a direct person-to-person lending model to microcredit lending for low-income small business owners in developing countries.\\"Is Microfinance for You?\\" , SecondAct, April 17, 2012. In 2017, Facebook initiated \\"Fundraisers\\", an internal plug-in function that allows its users to raise money for nonprofits. DonorsChoose.org, founded in 2000, allows public school teachers in the United States to request materials for their classrooms. Individuals can lend money to teacher-proposed projects, and the organization fulfills and delivers supplies to schools. There are also a number of own- branded university crowdfunding websites, which enable students and staff to create projects and receive funding from alumni of the university or the general public. Several dedicated civic crowdfunding platforms have emerged in the US and the UK, some of which have led to the first direct involvement of governments in crowdfunding. In the UK, Spacehive is used by the Mayor of London and Manchester City Council to co-fund civic projects created by citizens. Similarly, dedicated humanitarian crowdfunding initiatives are emerging, involving humanitarian organizations, volunteers and supports in solving and modeling how to build innovative crowdfunding solutions for the humanitarian community. Likewise, international organizations like the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) have been researching and publishing about the topic.Crowdfunding for Emergencies, by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs One crowdfunding project, iCancer, was used to support a Phase 1 trial of AdVince, an anti-cancer drug in 2016. Research into the suitability of crowdfunding for civic investment in the UK highlights that the public sector has not fully realised the benefits of a crowdfunding approach. Real estate  Real estate crowdfunding is the online pooling of capital from investors to fund mortgages secured by real estate, such as \\"fix and flip\\" redevelopment of distressed or abandoned properties, equity for commercial and residential projects, acquisition of pools of distressed mortgages, home buyer downpayments, and similar real estate related outlets. Investment, via specialized online platforms in the US, is generally completed under Title II of the JOBS Act and is limited to accredited investors. The platforms offer low minimum investments, often $100 ‚Äì $10,000.O'Connell, Jonathan (June 9, 2013) \\"Fundrise faces off with skeptical financial services industry over crowd-funded real estate\\". Washington Post. Retrieved June 26, 2014.Simon, Ruth and Brown, Eliot(June 11, 2014). \\"Real-Estate Sector Moves Crowdfunding Beyond the Trinkets\\". Wall Street Journal. Retrieved June 26, 2014 . There are over 75 real estate crowdfunding platforms in the United States. The growth of real estate crowdfunding is a global tendency. During 2014 and 2015, more than 150 platforms have been created throughout the world, such as in China, the Middle East, or France. In Europe, some compare this growing industry to that of e-commerce ten years ago. In Europe the requirements towards investors are not as high as in the United States, lowering the entry barrier into the real estate investments in general. Real estate crowdfunding can include various project types from commercial to residential developments, planning gain opportunities, build to hold (such as social housing), and many more. The report from Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance addresses both real estate crowdfunding and peer 2 peer lending (property) in the UK.Entrenching Innovation Intellectual property exposure One of the challenges of posting new ideas on crowdfunding sites is there may be little or no intellectual property (IP) protection provided by the sites themselves. Once an idea is posted, it can be copied. As Slava Rubin, founder of IndieGoGo, said: \\"We get asked that all the time, 'How do you protect me from someone stealing my idea?' We're not liable for any of that stuff.\\"Mike Drummond, \\"Making it Rain: Seeking Seed Money from the Crowd\\" , Inventors Digest, August 2011 Inventor advocates, such as Simon Brown, founder of the UK-based United Innovation Association, counsel that ideas can be protected on crowdfunding sites through early filing of patent applications, use of copyright and trademark protection as well as a new form of idea protection supported by the World Intellectual Property Organization called Creative Barcode.  Science  A number of platforms have also emerged that specialize in the crowdfunding of scientific projects, such as experiment.com, and The Open Source Science Project. In the scientific community, these new options for research funding are seen ambivalently. Advocates of crowdfunding for science emphasize that it allows early-career scientists to apply for their own projects early on, that it forces scientists to communicate clearly and comprehensively to a broader public, that it may alleviate problems of the established funding systems which are seen to fund conventional, mainstream projects, and that it gives the public a say in science funding. In turn, critics are worried about quality control on crowdfunding platforms. If non- scientists were allowed to make funding decisions, it would be more likely that \\"panda bear science\\" is funded, i.e. research with broad appeal but lacking scientific substance. Initial studies found that crowdfunding is used within science, mostly by young researchers to fund small parts of their projects, and with high success rates. At the same time, funding success seems to be strongly influenced by non-scientific factors like humor, visualizations, or the ease and security of payment.  Journalism  In order to fund online and print publications, journalists are enlisting the help of crowdfunding. Crowdfunding allows for small start-ups and individual journalists to fund their work without the institutional help of major public broadcasters. Stories are publicly pitched using crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter, Indiegogo, or Spot.us. The funds collected from crowdsourcing may be put toward travel expenses or purchasing equipment. Crowdfunding in journalism may also be viewed as a way to allow audiences to participate in news production and in creating a participatory culture. Though deciding which stories are published is a role that traditionally belongs to editors at more established publications, crowdfunding can give the public an opportunity to provide input in deciding which stories are reported. This is done by funding certain reporters and their pitches. Donating can be seen as an act that \\"bonds\\" reporters and their readers. This is because readers are expressing interest for their work, which can be \\"personally motivating\\" or \\"gratifying\\" for reporters. Spot.us, which was closed in February 2015, was a crowdfunding platform that was specifically meant for journalism. The website allowed for readers, individual donors, registered Spot.us reporters, or news organizations to fund or donate talent toward a pitch of their choosing. While funders are not normally involved in editorial control, Spot.us allowed for donors or \\"community members\\" to become involved with the co-creation of a story. This gave them the ability to edit articles, submit photographs, or share leads and information. According to an analysis by Public Insight Network, Spot.us was not sustainable for various reasons. Many contributors were not returning donors and often, projects were funded by family and friends. The overall market for crowdfunding journalism may also be a factor; donations for journalism projects accounted for .13 percent of the $2.8 billion that was raised in 2013. Larger crowdfunding platforms such as Indiegogo or Kickstarter, both of which are not journalism-specific, may garner more success for projects. This is because these large-scale platforms can allow journalists to reach new audiences. In 2017, 2.3 million out of Kickstarter's 7.9 million users had donated toward more than one project. Traditionally, journalists are not involved in advertising and marketing. Crowdfunding means that journalists are attracting funders while trying to remain independent, which may pose a conflict. Therefore, being directly involved with financial aspects can call journalistic integrity and journalistic objectivity into question. This is also due to the fact that journalists may feel some pressure or \\"a sense of responsibility\\" toward funders who support a particular project. Crowdfunding can also allow for a blurred line between professional and non-professional journalism because if enough interest is generated, anyone may have their work published. Crowdfunding enables freelancer journalists to travel to the sites to find the new sources.  International development  There is some hope that crowdfunding has potential as a tool open for use by groups of people traditionally more marginalized. The World Bank published a report titled \\"Crowdfunding's Potential for the Developing World\\" which states that \\"While crowdfunding is still largely a developed world phenomenon, with the support of governments and development organizations it could become a useful tool in the developing world as well. Substantial reservoirs of entrepreneurial talent, activity, and capital lay dormant in many emerging economies...Crowdfunding and crowdfund investing have several important roles to play in the developing world's entrepreneurial and venture finance ecosystem.\\"  Legal developments  As the popularity of crowdfunding expanded, the SEC, state governments, and Congress responded by enacting and refining many capital-raising exemptions to allow easier access to alternative funding sources. Initially, the Securities Act of 1933 banned companies from soliciting capital from the general public for private offerings. However, \\"President Obama signed the Jumpstart Our Small Businesses Act (\\"JOBS Act\\") into law on April 5, 2012, which removed the ban on general solicitation activities for issuers qualifying under a new exemption called 'Rule 506(c).'\\" A company can now broadly solicit and generally advertise an offering and still be compliant with the exemption's requirements if: * The investors in the offering are all accredited investors; and * The company takes reasonable steps to verify that the investors are accredited investors, which could include reviewing documentation, such as W-2s, tax returns, bank and brokerage statements, credit reports and the like. Another change was the amendment of SEC Rule 147. Section 3(a)(11) of the Securities Act allows for unlimited capital raising from investors in a single state through an intrastate exemption. However, the SEC created Rule 147 with a number of requirements to ensure compliance. For example, the intrastate solicitation was allowed, but a single out-of-state offer could destroy the exemption. Additionally, the issuer was required to be incorporated and do business in the same state of the intrastate offering. With the expansion of interstate business activities because of the internet, it became difficult for businesses to comply with the exemption. Therefore, on October 26, 2016 the SEC adopted Rule 147(a) which removed many of the restrictions to modernize the Rules. For example, companies would have to do business and have its principal place of business in the state where the offering is sold, and not necessarily where offered per the prior rule. Benefits and risks=Benefits for the creator Crowdfunding campaigns provide producers with a number of benefits, beyond the strict financial gains. The following are non financial benefits of crowdfunding. * Profile ‚Äì a compelling project can raise a producer's profile and provide a boost to their reputation. * Marketing ‚Äì project initiators can show there are an audience and market for their project. In the case of an unsuccessful campaign, it provides good market feedback. * Audience engagement ‚Äì crowdfunding creates a forum where project initiators can engage with their audiences. An audience can engage in the production process by the following progress through updates from the creators and sharing feedback via comment features on the project's crowdfunding page. * Feedback ‚Äì offering pre-release access to content or the opportunity to beta-test content to project backers as a part of the funding incentives provides the project initiators with instant access to good market testing feedback. There are also financial benefits to the creator. For one, crowdfunding allows creators to attain low- cost capital. Traditionally, a creator would need to look at \\"personal savings, home equity loans, personal credit cards, friends and family members, angel investors, and venture capitalists.\\" With crowdfunding, creators can find funders from around the world, sell both their product and equity, and benefit from increased information flow. Additionally, crowdfunding that supports pre-buying allows creators to obtain early feedback on the product. Another potential positive effect is the propensity of groups to \\"produce an accurate aggregate prediction\\" about market outcomes as identified by the author James Surowiecki in his book The Wisdom of Crowds, thereby placing financial backing behind ventures likely to succeed. Proponents also identify a potential outcome of crowdfunding as an exponential increase in available venture capital. One report claims that if every American family gave one percent of their investable assets to crowdfunding, $300 billion (a 10X increase) would come into venture capital. Proponents also cite that a benefit for companies receiving crowdfunding support is that they retain control of their operations, as voting rights are not conveyed along with ownership when crowdfunding. As part of his response to the Amanda Palmer Kickstarter controversy, Albini expressed his supportive views of crowdfunding for musicians, explaining: \\"I've said many times that I think they're part of the new way bands and their audience interact and they can be a fantastic resource, enabling bands to do things essentially in cooperation with their audience.\\" Albini described the concept of crowdfunding as \\"pretty amazing.\\" Risks and barriers for the creator Crowdfunding also comes with a number of potential risks or barriers. For the creator, as well as the investor, studies show that crowdfunding contains \\"high levels of risk, uncertainty, and information asymmetry.\\" * Reputation ‚Äì failure to meet campaign goals or to generate interest results in a public failure. Reaching financial goals and successfully gathering substantial public support but being unable to deliver on a project for some reason can severely negatively impact one's reputation. * Intellectual property (IP) protection ‚Äì many Interactive Digital Media developers and content producers are reluctant to publicly announce the details of a project before production due to concerns about idea theft and protecting their IP from plagiarism. Creators who engage in crowdfunding are required to release their product to the public in early stages of funding and development, exposing themselves to the risk of copy by competitors. * Donor exhaustion ‚Äì there is a risk that if the same network of supporters is reached out to multiple times, that network will eventually cease to supply necessary support. * Public fear of abuse ‚Äì concern among supporters that without a regulatory framework, the likelihood of a scam or an abuse of funds is high. The concern may become a barrier to public engagement. * Lack of participation - It is seen that some stories are more likely to get picked up than others based on the story. It is easy to get support if you \\"just tell a story.\\" For crowdfunding of equity stock purchases, there is some research in social psychology that indicates that, like in all investments, people don't always do their due diligence to determine if it is a sound investment before investing, which leads to making investment decisions based on emotion rather than financial logic. By using crowdfunding, creators also forgo potential support and value that a single angel investor or venture capitalist might offer. Likewise, crowdfunding requires that creators manage their investors. This can be time-consuming and financially burdensome as the number of investors in the crowd rises. Crowdfunding draws a crowd: investors and other interested observers who follow the progress, or lack of progress, of a project. Sometimes it proves easier to raise the money for a project than to make the project a success. Managing communications with many possibly disappointed investors and supporters can be a substantial, and potentially diverting, task. Some of the most popular fundraising drives are for commercial companies that use the process to reach customers and at the same time market their products and services. This favors companies like microbreweries and specialist restaurants ‚Äì in effect creating a \\"club\\" of people who are customers as well as investors. In the US in 2015, new rules from the SEC to regulate equity crowdfunding will mean that larger businesses with more than 500 investors and more than $25 million in assets will have to file reports like a public company. The Wall Street Journal commented: \\"It is all the pain of an IPO without the benefits of the IPO.\\" These two trends may mean crowdfunding is most suited to small consumer-facing companies rather than tech start-ups.  Benefits for the investor  There are several ways in which a well-regulated crowdfunding platform may provide the possibility of attractive returns for investors: * Crowdfunding reduces costs ‚Äì The platforms reduce search costs and transaction costs, which allows higher participation in the market. Many individual investors would otherwise have a hard time investing in early-stage companies because of the difficulty of identifying a company directly and the high costs of joining an Angel Group or doing it through a professional venture capital firm. * Current early-stage investing is not efficient ‚Äì Venture capital firms often neglect the consumer sector and focus mainly on high-tech companies. Crowdfunding opens up some of these neglected markets to individual investors. Crowdfunding doesn't make sense in every industry, but for some, like retail and consumer, it does. * Value of new investors ‚Äì Investors can add value to companies when they act as brand advocates and they can even be used as a focus group. Crowdfunding allows individual investors to be a part of the company they invest in.  Risks for the investor  On crowdfunding platforms, the problem of information asymmetry is exacerbated due to the reduced ability of the investor to conduct due diligence. Early-stage investing is typically localized, as the costs of conducting due diligence before making investment decisions and the costs of monitoring after investing both rise with distance. However, this trend is not observed on crowdfunding platforms - these platforms are not geographically constrained and bring in investors from near and far. On non-equity or reward- based platforms, investors try to mitigate this risk by using the amount of capital raised as a signal of performance or quality. On equity-based platforms, crowdfunding syndicates reduce information asymmetry through dual channels ‚Äì through portfolio diversification and better due diligence as in the case of offline early-stage investing, but also by allowing lead investors with more information and better networks to lead crowds of backers to make investment decisions.Kang L, Jiang Q, Tan C-H. Remarkable Advocates: An Investigation of Geographic Distance and Social Capital for Crowdfunding. Information & Management. 2017;54(3):336-348. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.im.2016.09.001 Issues in medical crowdfunding The rise of crowdfunding for medical expenses is considered, in large part, a symptom of an inadequate and failing healthcare system in countries such as the United States. Healthcare through crowdfunding relies on perceived deservingness and worth, which reproduces unequal outcomes in access. Rob Solomon, the CEO of GoFundMe, has commented on this: \\"The system is terrible. It needs to be rethought and retooled. Politicians are failing us. Health care companies are failing us. Those are realities. I don't want to mince words here. We are facing a huge potential tragedy. We provide relief for a lot of people. But there are people who are not getting relief from us or from the institutions that are supposed to be there. We shouldn‚Äôt be the solution to a complex set of systemic problems.\\" There are ethical issues in medical crowdfunding. There is a loss of patient privacy, as crowdfunding campaigns that disclose extensive personal information are generally more financially successful. The oversight regarding the veracity of claims is generally limited. For instance, physicians are obliged to uphold the ethics of the medical profession, such as patient confidentiality, but this runs in conflict with dishonest crowdfunding efforts. Medical crowdfunding perpetuates inequalities‚Äîassociated with variables such as gender, class, and race‚Äîin access to healthcare. For example, the most successful campaigns raise funds for patients who are well connected in large social networks and are able to navigate the technological landscape. Finally, the use of medical crowdfunding might reduce the impetus to reform failing infrastructures to healthcare.

Description and history The Dyer Estate is located north of Gorham center, on the west side of Fort Hill Road (Maine State Route 114), the main northbound route from the center. Set on over of land are the main house, and a collection of farm outbuildings that includes a storage barn, animal barn, greenhouse, equipment shed, and other buildings. Landscaped features of the property include a pond, impounded by an earthen dam at its south end, a croquet lawn bordered by a cedar hedge, and a walled garden. The house is a 2-1/2 story Greek Revival structure, with a side gable roof, twin interior chimneys, and clapboard siding. It has a single-story porch extending across its front and south sides. The construction date of the house is not known with certain; by stylistic analysis it was probably sometime in the 1850s, by one of two known owners during that period. The property, then more than , was purchased in 1888 by Isaac W. Dyer, a prominent Portland lawyer who served in the Maine legislature and as the United States District Attorney for many years. This property was Dyer's summer estate, and about 1900 he began a major transformation, building most of the outbuildings and landscaped features visible today. These types of built-up summer \\"gentleman's farm\\" properties are increasingly rare in the state, and the Dyer estate is notable as one of the few known that includes a walled garden.

It is the largest fossil-fuel based power generating station in the country. The plant has installed capacity of 972 MW; and is capable of generating 2500 GWh of electricity annually. The plant meets current world specifications for plants of its type, and includes an updated control room, a switchgear room, a staff training school and recreational facilities. Most of the electricity produced by Ughelli is transported through a network of conductors, to the national grid. The refurbishment of existing power units and the addition of a new 400 MW project are likely to drive a 4x increase in revenue to NGN100 billion by 2020. The plant is an asset of Transnational Corporation of Nigeria Plc (Transcorp)‚Äôs power subsidiary, Transcorp Ughelli Power Limited (Transcorp Power).  History  The station was built in 1964 with an installed capacity of 2X36MW or 72MW from two Stal-Laval gas turbines and began operations in 1966. Then the station was called Delta I under the Electricity Corporation of Nigeria (ECN), a precursor to the Nigerian Electric Power Authority (NEPA) and its successor, the Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN). In 1975, six units of General Electric (GE) Frame 5 gas turbines (20MW each) were installed in the station known as Delta II, after the merger of Niger Dam Authority (NDA), Kainji and the ECN to form the National Electric Power Authority (NEPA). In 1978 additional six units of GE Frame 5 gas turbines, like the ones installed in 1975, were added to Delta Power Station (Known as Delta III) to boost the installed capacity to a total of 312MW. In 1991, six 100MW (600MW) GE Frame 9 gas turbines were added. From 2000 to 2008 Delta II and Delta III GE units were upgraded to 150MW station each: built by Hitachi of Japan. The control systems were upgraded to Mark V, a fully computerized control system for Delta II and III. While Delta I was scrapped. Delta IV control system was also upgraded to Mark V by GE of USA which built the station. On September 25, 2012, Transcorp Ughelli Power Limited (TUPL) (which comprises Wood Rock Energy Resources Limited, Symbion Power LLC, Thomassen Holding Limited, Medea Development S.A., Tenoil Petroleum and Energy Services Limited and PSL Engineering and Control Limited) won the $300m bid for the acquisition of the Ughelli Power Plant, one of the six power generation companies of the Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN) being privatized by the Federal Government of Nigeria.

Life She was born in Brienz; at the age of 12, she moved with her family to Geneva. She first visited Brazil in 1976 to observe its rich variety of birds. On her return, she pursued a master's degree in ornithology at Nancy-Universit√©. Five years later, in Brazil, she first saw a rare blackbird Forbes's blackbird (Curaeus forbesi), known locally as \\"anumar√°\\", in the Pedra Talhada forest in the state of Alagoas. Her academic supervisor told her that the bird was a good subject for study but that the forest, the bird's habitat, would be gone in nine to ten years. The forest was being cleared to allow the raising of cattle and planting of sugar cane. Instead of studying the bird, Studer decided to save the forest. Her lobbying efforts resulted in 4,500 hectares of the Pedra Talhada forest being declared a federal reserve. Studer initiated the planting of new trees - over 800 hectares; to ensure biodiversity, the trees planted include a number of indigenous species. She also involved local children in these projects. For raising funds, Studer established the Nordesta Association in Switzerland which also has provided funding for new schools in the local villages. She also helped develop businesses to improve the local economy. Studer herself makes a living by working as an accountant in Geneva. Her initiatives in Brazil were the subject of a 1996 documentary \\"Mother Forest and the Street Children\\", written and produced by David Martinez of Dreamtime Productions and seen on the Discovery Channel.

It has smooth white and grey bark, lance-shaped, often curved leaves, top-shaped or diamond-shaped flower buds, white to cream-coloured flowers and cone-shaped fruit on a down-curved peduncle.flower budsfruit Description Eucalyptus aquilina is a mallee that typically grows to a height of and has smooth white bark mottled with grey and forms a lignotuber. The leaves on young plants and on coppice regrowth are lance-shaped to egg-shaped and a slightly different shade of green on the two sides. The adult leaves are arranged alternately, the same glossy dark green on both sides, lance shaped or curved, long and wide with the base tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are borne in leaf axils on a broadly flattened peduncle long. The buds are top-shaped to diamond-shaped, long and wide with a conical to rounded operculum with a small point on the top. Flowering occurs between April and October and the flowers are white to cream coloured. The fruit are conical with the narrower end towards the base, long and wide on a down-curved peduncle. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus aquilina was first formally described in 1974 by Ian Brooker from a specimen collected near Cape Le Grand and the description was published in the journal Nuytsia. The specific epithet (aquilina) is a Latin word meaning \\"of eagles\\", referring to the eagle-like lobes on the fruit. Distribution and habitat The Mount Le Grand mallee grows in shallow valleys, creek beds and hillsides in a small area in the Cape Le Grand National Park along the south coast, east of Esperance. It grows in dense heath in shallow soils over granite. Conservation This eucalypt is classified as \\"Priority Four\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that is rare or near threatened.

The channel first gained popularity in 2013. , HowToBasic has over 15.3 million subscribers, making it the 4th biggest Australian YouTube channel. The channel's estimated net worth is US$2 million . The channel was briefly suspended on two occasions: once in 2014 and again in late 2015 on presumed violations of YouTube's policy on misleading content. Soon after each time, the channel was restored, and suspension lifted. Description and history The channel intentionally misleads first-time viewers to believe it is a how-to channel, with video titles, thumbnails, descriptions, as well as the channel's general description, claiming its videos to be tutorials on different subjects, with a particular emphasis on cooking. The actual content of the videos, instead, shows the unidentified man interacting in point of view with food and objects in many ways, mostly by throwing, destroying, and creating a large mess out of them. Some videos have employed additional gags, with guest actors and related footage appearing. Originally, the videos were genuine tutorials of very simple actions, such as \\"How to pick up an umbrella\\" or \\"How to pour Drinks\\". A common theme in the videos is that a large assortment of chicken eggs are thrown and destroyed. Many of the videos include a running gag in which the man gives a thumbs-up (or sometimes the finger gun or the middle finger) in front of the camera while pointing the camera at the mess created, usually before the scene ends. On 24 March 2018, HowToBasic released what appeared to be a face reveal video. However, the video turned out to be a parody and a compilation of popular YouTubers claiming themselves to be the creator of the channel, ultimately continuing the legitimate creator's anonymity. Over 80 individuals had a cameo in the video, including Michael Stevens of Vsauce, Markiplier, Casey Neistat, h3h3productions, jacksfilms, iDubbbz, Boogie2988, JonTron, maxmoefoe, Jacksepticeye, RoomieOfficial, and Post Malone.

He played in Belgium for teams including RSC Anderlecht and RWDM. Career Philip Osondu played in his native Nigeria for El Kanemi Warriors when RSC Anderlecht bought him to Belgium in 1988. The attacker was seen as an emerging football talent and was transferred to Anderlecht that was a promising team. A year later, the 18-year-old striker made his debut at the highest level in an away match against Germinal Ekeren in 1989 playing under coach Aad de Mos. However, there was a lot of competition at Anderlecht with players like Luc Nilis, Luis Oliveira, Marc Van Der Linden and Gert Verheyen which made Osondu appear barely at the games. Between 1990 and 1992 the Nigerian was also loaned to neighbors RWDM. When RWDM got Osondu, coach Hugo Broos gave him more playing opportunities. For the first time in the First Division, he also found the back of the goal. Osondu scored his first goal in a 4-1 win over Beerschot VAV. A year later Broos left for Club Brugge and was succeeded by Ladislav Nov√°k. This led to fewer opportunities to play for Osondu, which in the summer led to his return to Anderlecht. In 1994 Osondu moved to second division club La Louvi√®re, where the small and technically gifted striker scored five times in twenty matches. A season later he swapped La Louvi√®re during the winter break for Union Saint Gillis, where he completed the rest of the season. Afterwards he played several years for Diegem Sport and FC Merchtem 2000.

He was United States champion in the 800-meter run in 1936, 1939, 1940 and 1941 and NCAA champion in 1936; he entered the 1936 United States Olympic Trials as one of the favorites, but fell in the final and failed to qualify for the Olympics. Early life and collegiate career Beetham was born in Cadiz, Ohio on April 30, 1914. He studied at North High School in Columbus, Ohio and became a good runner there, guided by his older brother Rupert. After graduating from high school Beetham attended Ohio State University, where he was coached by Larry Snyder; his teammates included Jesse Owens and Dave Albritton. He was a sit-and-kick runner whose usual approach was to wait in the pack and outsprint his opponents at the end. As a sophomore at Ohio State, Beetham won the 1935 Big Ten championship in the 880-yard (804.7 m) run. He also won the 880 yards in a dual meet against the University of Southern California on June 15, 1935; his winning time, 1:52.0, was the fastest in the world that year. Beetham entered the 1935 NCAA championships as the favorite, but dropped out early on the second lap. In 1936 Beetham defended his Big Ten half-mile title in a meeting record 1:52.4 and won the NCAA 800-meter championship in 1:53.0. At the national outdoor championships of the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) a week before the Olympic Trials Beetham won a close race against John Woodruff; his winning time, 1:50.3, broke Ben Eastman's meeting record by one-tenth of a second. The 1936 United States Olympic Trials were held at Randall's Island Stadium in New York City; Beetham entered the 800 meters as a leading favorite. He qualified for the Trials final by placing fourth in his heat. In the final, Beetham stayed in the middle of the pack for the first lap; as he started his kick early on the second lap, he was spiked by Marmaduke Hobbs and fell, losing his chances to make the Olympic team. He did not finish the race, which was won by Woodruff; his appeal for a solo time-trial re-run was turned down. In 1937, his final year at Ohio State, Beetham repeated as Big Ten half-mile champion both indoors and outdoors; his winning time in the outdoor meet, 1:52.2, broke his own meeting record from the previous year. He placed third at the 1937 NCAA championships as Woodruff won in a fast race; Beetham's time, 1:50.8 for 880 yards, was his lifetime best. Later life Beetham continued running after graduating from Ohio State. He placed fifth in the AAU 800 meters in 1937 and third in 1938, but regained the championship in 1939; his winning time was 1:51.7. He also won in 1940 (1:51.1) and 1941 (1:50.2), becoming a four-time national outdoor champion; in addition, he won the 600 meters at the 1939 AAU indoor championships. In August 1939 he anchored an American 4 √ó 800 metres relay team to an unofficial world record of 7:35.2 in a race against the French team in Paris. Beetham lost another opportunity to qualify for the Olympics when the 1940 Summer Games were cancelled due to World War II. He enlisted in the United States Navy after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, but continued running; in 1945 he won the 880 yards at the Millrose Games and was awarded the Wanamaker Trophy as the outstanding performer of the meet. After the war Beetham took up coaching; he was assistant coach of the Ohio State Buckeyes track team from 1946 to 1966. He was inducted in the Ohio State Varsity \\"O\\" Hall of Fame in 1981.

At one time the pub also served as the village bakery. The pub was originally known as \\"The Pig and Whistle\\" and later \\"The Fox\\" and \\"The Fox at Charlton\\", but was renamed \\"The Fox Goes Free\\" after a change of ownership in 1985. On 9 November 2015 the Fox's entry in the National Heritage List for England was updated to include the WI connection, as were records for three other buildings of WI significance.

The Rownham Ferry was a boat service across the River Avon in Bristol, England. It began operations by the twelfth century and ceased in 1932 after the construction of bridges across the river.  Description  The Rownham Ferry crossed the River Avon at the southern end of the Avon Gorge, between Bower Ashton on the western side of the river and Hotwells on the east. The ferry was in operation by the 12th century, and may have previously been a fording point at low tide. The original endpoints were two inns - the New Inn in Bower Ashton and the Rownham Tavern in Hotwells. In the early 16th century a second ferry service was established in competition to that run by St Augustine's Abbey (now Bristol Cathedral). The case was heard in the star chamber. Around 1600, the ferry is marked on John Speed's maps as \\"Rounam Pasage\\" or \\"Rownam Passage\\". In 1793 the ferry was identified as being used by many passengers to \\"cross the river at Rownham ferry and walk to the sweet and wholesome village of Ashton to eat strawberries and cream\\". When the Portishead Railway was built in 1866, the ferry became popular with users of Clifton Bridge railway station. The ferry was moved in 1873 due to the expansion of Cumberland Basin, with new slipways built on both sides of the river. At low tide, the crossing was a bridge of boats rather than a ferry. The toll was 1d, due to the tidal nature of the crossing and the need to clean the slipways of mud after each high tide. The ferry ceased operation on 31 December 1932. The slipways are still occasionally visible at low tide.

This early publishing activity was overseen by Bill Forster who became the head of UH Press when it was born.\\"The University of Hertfordshire: Sixty years of innovation\\" by Davies, Owen (ed), University of Hertfordshire Press, 2012 It is considered one of the leading UK university publishing houses. Subject areas UH Press publishes in the following subject areas: * Local and regional history * Theatre studies * Psychology * Education * Sustainable communities * Law * Romani studies Romani studies UH Press publishes books in the area of Romany Gypsy life, culture and history. English Gypsies and State Policies by David Mayall (UH Press, 1995) and On the Verge: The Gypsies of England by Donald Kenrick and Siam Bakewell (UH Press, 1995) were the first titles to be published in this area. UH Press was invited to join Interface, a Europe-wide consortium of publishers set up to disseminate research about the Romany peoples. Literature and Theatre studies It also publishes in the area of literature and theatre studies, often in partnership with the Society for Theatre Research.

It was constructed by a local temperance society at a rural crossroads which became known as Temperance Corner. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places under its full Finnish name Cokaton P.R.S. Onnen Toivo Raittiusseura in 1976 for its local significance in the themes of European ethnic heritage and social history. It was nominated for its association with the temperance movement and importance to the cultural life of an immigrant community. The hall is now maintained by the Cokato Finnish American Historical Society, which has moved other historical structures nearby to form the Finnish Pioneer Park. Description The Cokato Temperance Hall is a simple wood-frame building of two stories. It has a rectangular footprint of , with an vestibule projecting from the front fa√ßade. There are four windows on the north and south walls, and two arched windows on the second-story gable. The ground floor interior consists of a single room with a stage at the far end. A narrow staircase in the northeast corner leads to the unfinished upper floor. Origin The 19th-century temperance movement in the United States was primarily a xenophobic reaction of native-born Americans to seemingly hard- drinking Irish and German immigrants. However temperance was also a value among some immigrant groups themselves, particularly northern Scandinavians who had seen the destructive effects of alcoholism that could take root during their long, depressing winters. Finnish immigrants first homesteaded the prairie north of Cokato in 1866. Thirty years later, members of this dispersed Finnish community founded a branch of the Minnesota Temperance Society on August 2, 1896. The local branch was named the Onnen Toivo Temperance Society, meaning \\"hope of happiness\\" in the Finnish language. That same year they purchased a quarter-acre lot from a local family at a rural crossroads for $30. The clubhouse was erected on the site under the leadership of Erick Kotila. Use The hall interior in 2015 To join the Onnen Toivo Temperance Society, members had to sign a pledge to abstain from all alcohol. Members who broke their pledge and drank could rejoin if they signed a new pledge. Participants were \\"to recruit members to take the pledge, detect intemperance, reprimand but forgive offenders and educate the youth to the evils of alcohol.\\" Quarterly dues were 25¬¢ for males and 15¬¢ for females. Meetings could draw up to 44 attendees, quite a crowd given the low population and difficulty of travel. Although temperance was the price of admission, the hall really served to maintain the settlers' Finnish heritage and sense of community. It became the area's recreational and social hub. Its stage was used for plays, skits, lectures, and music performances by local and traveling presenters. The hall's recreational importance surged in 1910 when an athletic club was formed, offering gymnastics, boxing, wrestling, and other sports. Gatherings like box socials raised money for charitable causes while providing young people the chance to meet potential romantic partners. The hall also hosted civic functions such as township meetings, school events, and elections. A charitable society formed to ship food, clothing, and other assistance to Finland from World War I to 1959. They were especially active during the Winter War of 1939‚Äì40, as the Soviet Union invaded Finland but U.S. foreign policy forbade federal assistance. The hall was renovated in 1939, receiving a new roof and foundation, repaired floor, repainted exterior, and redecorated interior. A painted stage curtain advertising a local business was added; it is now on display in the Cokato Museum. Later history The Cokato Temperance Hall was used for social and school events into the 1950s. By 1967 it had fallen into disrepair, and was sold to a private owner. Three years later he sold it to a church group, the Church of God of the First Born, which used it for services for a few years before folding. In the 1970s the hall was purchased by the Cokato Finnish American Historical Society, which had been chartered in 1939 to preserve local heritage. They refurbished the hall and assembled other historical buildings at Temperance Corner to form the Finnish Pioneer Park. The park now includes the 1896 temperance hall, an 1899 one-room schoolhouse, an 1866 log cabin from one of the area's first settlers, and the 1868 Barberg‚ÄìSelv√§l√§‚ÄìSalmonson Sauna‚Äîwhich is believed to be the oldest savusauna in the United States. The Cokato Finnish American Historical Society holds several annual events at the Pioneer Park, including observances of Finnish holidays like Juhannus and Pikkujoulu. Tours of the historical buildings are available by appointment.

Life  Johann Pfeiffer was born in Nuremberg and had his earliest music lessons with various teachers in his home town. After studying law in Leipzig and Halle he worked for six months in the Hofkapelle of the count Heinrich Reu√ü-Schleiz.Fran√ßois-Joseph F√©tis: Biographie universelle des musiciens et bibliographie g√©n√®rale de la musique (1864) From 1720, he was employed as a violinist in the Hofkapelle (Court Orchestra) in Weimar. In 1726 he became concert master there and Duke Ernst August gifted him a valuable violin made by Jakob Stainer. In the years 1729 and 1730 he accompanied his employer on a trip through Holland, the Habsburg Netherlands and France. In 1732 Pfeiffer spent several in months Berlin, before he became the Hofkapellmeister of Margrave Friedrich III in Bayreuth on the recommendation of the Crown Prince, Friedrich II. In Bayreuth he also gave lessons to Wilhelmine of Prussia in composition, violin playing, and continuo and also joined the Masonic Lodge Zur Sonne. After the death of Wilhelmine in 1758, the court orchestra was reduced and Pfeiffer was released from his position as concert master, although he remained connected to the court in Bayreuth as a well respected violinist and composer until his death in 1761.Ruth M√ºller-Lindenberg: Wilhelmine von Bayreuth; Die Hofoper als B√ºhne des LebensGerber Neues Historisch-biographisches Lexikon der Tonk√ºnstler  Works  Pfeiffer's compositional style is typical of that which prevailed in South Germany during the first half of the 18th century and also demonstrates a strong Italian influence. His Ouverture-Suites are close in style to those of his German contemporaries like Telemann, Fasch and even Bach. A large part of Pfeiffer's musical output is considered lost. Since most of his surviving manuscripts are signed \\"del Sign. Pfeiffer\\", it is likely that many pieces now attributed to him are by other composers named Pfeiffer, including his Son Johann Michael (ca.1750-ca.1800), the probable composer of several sinfonias. Pfeiffer also composed music for the stage, especially for the Margravial Opera House in Bayrteuth which was built at the instigation of Wilhelmine and her husband. It is one of the few German baroque theatres surviving. The technical requirements made by Pfeiffer's surviving concertos and chamber music vary widely and a clear distinction can be made between the music written for himself or other professional court musicians, and his lesser skilled employers, their entourage and other amateur music lovers. The large number of entries Pfeiffer's works receive in the catalogues Breitkopf & H√§rtel from the 1760-1780sMGG, 2. attests to his popularity during the 18th century.

It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, basically rectangular in plan, with gables and projecting sections typical of the Queen Anne style. A single-story turret with conical roof stands at one corner, with a porch wrapping around it. The porch is supported by heavy Colonial Revival Tuscan columns, and has a turned balustrade. The house was probably built about 1888, and is one of the earliest documented examples of this transitional Queen Anne-Colonial Revival style in the city. It was built for Gardiner Andrus Armstrong Deane, a Confederate veteran of the American Civil War, and a leading figure in the development of railroads in the state.

It is a part of one of the largest health systems and the second largest faith-based health system in the United States, Catholic Health Initiatives. CHI St. Luke's Health's facilities have been recognized as some of the best in the nation.  History  St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital was founded by the Episcopal Diocese of Texas in 1954 and was one of the first hospitals established in the Texas Medical Center. In 1962, Denton A. Cooley founded the Texas Heart Institute, which became affiliated with St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital. It was there that Denton A. Cooley performed the first successful heart transplantation in the United States in 1968 and the first artificial heart implantation in the world in 1969. In 1990, St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital's 26-story O'Quinn Medical Tower was constructed and has since become a Texas Medical Center icon. In 1997, the Episcopal Diocese of Texas established the St. Luke's Episcopal Health System. It established its first freestanding emergency center in 2000 and opened two more in subsequent years. St. Luke's continued to expand as it opened a hospital in The Woodlands, Texas, in 2003. A year later, St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital entered into an affiliation agreement with Baylor College of Medicine. St. Luke's then proceeded to open a hospital in Sugar Land, Texas, in 2008, another in The Woodlands in 2009, and two more in Northwest Houston and East Houston in 2010. In 2013, St. Luke's Episcopal Health System announced the transfer of its hospitals to Catholic Health Initiatives, a national nonprofit, and changed its name to CHI St. Luke's Health.

He later moved to the Academy of Art Dresden where he met Adrian Ludwig Richter. Like many artists of his time, he visited Italy, with extended stays in Naples and Venice.KLEUDGEN vov FRIEDERICH In 1873 he arrived in Bordighera with his wife and stayed at the Pensione Calvauna, which later became Coffee Cadama, until 1884. In the city he found a small German community and fascinated by the climate and light, decided to settle in the Ligurian town. In 1885 he built his home just outside the walls of old Bordighera, near the port of Magdalena and the old cemetery. The house, which he named \\"Villa Banana\\", and that is on the 4th of Via dei Colli, still exists today but unfortunately it was turned into an apartment building and is in poor conditions.[Bordighera published yesterday by city Bordighera in 1996] In 1891 he married his second wife, Elizabeth Pudmensky. They had three children: Frieda, William (mountaineer who died in 1929) and Luise who died in 1898. The only surviving child was Baroness Frieda von Kleudgen Peano, who in 1971 wrote a book on her father's life, \\"My father\\". The daughter remembers that on the terrace of the house in the summer evenings, von Kleudgen often fiddled with bordigotti friends including the painter and Mayor GF Piana. The father loved the simple life of the village and often spoke with fishermen returning from the Bay dell'Arziglia. What fascinated him was the sea, which he painted in numerous paintings. His paintings portray him now calm, now stormy, conveying the full force of nature. His most famous paintings are the \\"fish's Nest\\" and the \\"Sea Serpent\\" which can be seen at the Bicknell Museum. Some of his paintings are on display at the Town hall of Bordighera but the majority is in private collections. Another subject he liked to paint were the paths of Bordighera.Federico Von Keudgen He also had close ties of friendship with numerous bordigotti of different welfare states and represented them in his paintings. He was a friends of the other painters and artists who lived in Bordighera as Pompeo Mariani, Giuseppe Ferdinando Piana, Hermann Nestel, Charles Garnier and of course Ludwig Winter. In 1884 Claude Monet portrayed him while he painted a window of Villa Garnier. Kleudgen reproduced in a series of watercolors the bordigotti he liked so much. Some of these works became popular because they were taken up in postcards of the time. He died in Bordighera on June 22, 1924, at the age of 68 years.

He began his artistic training in his hometown and then moved to Munich and Berlin. Like many artists of the time, he made his trip to Italy to complete his training. In 1882 he was commissioned by the German Wilhelm Spemann to illustrate the Ligurian and French coasts, from Nice to La Spezia. The drawings of Nestel were used to illustrate the book \\"Die Riviera\\", written by Woldemar Kaden. In 1887 he decided to settle in Bordighera. There, he met the botanist and landscape architect Ludwig Winter with whom he became friend. In Bordighera, he continued to collaborate with German publishers, in particular with the magazines \\"Gartenlaube\\" and \\"√úber Land und Meer\\". In Bordighera, one of Nestel's daughters married Antonio,[\\"gardener Lodovico Winter in Bordighera\\" by Luigi Viacava] the first-born of Ludwig Winter. Nestel then began a collaboration with Winter in the creation of gardens, without however interrupting his work as a painter. One of his most beautiful paintings is undoubtedly the \\"Vallone del Sasso\\" now housed at the International Institute of Ligurian Studies (IISL). The painter loved to represent in his paintings not only the landscape, but also life in Bordighera. His well-known painting \\"Afternoon in Bordighera\\" represents fishermen and rocks. He had the opportunity to exhibit his works not only in Bordighera, memorable was the one at the \\"Victoria Hall\\" in Via Vittorio Veneto, but also in Turin and Germany. Nestel was a friend of the narrow group of intellectuals and artists who had so enriched the life of the Ligurian town, as Pompeo Mariani, Giuseppe Ferdinando Piana, Charles Garnier, Clarence Bicknell and of course the countrymen Ludwig Winter and Friederich von Kleudgen. Unfortunately he died young, at only 47, in 1905. His grave is in the cemetery of Bordighera.

Before his early death he organised the 'Concerts Spirituels' which promoted German music in Vienna at a time when Italian opera was particularly popular. Life Gebauer was organist in Franckstein (ZƒÖbkowice ≈ölƒÖskie) Franz Xaver Gebauer was born in Eckersdorf, County of Glatz, Kingdom of Prussia (now Bo≈ºk√≥w, K≈Çodzko County, Lower Silesian Voivodeship, Poland.Bo≈ºk√≥w was located in the lands of the Count of Glatz (now County of Kladsko), which until 1742 was a suzerain polity within the Habsburg-ruled Kingdom of Bohemia; Empress Maria Teresa lost the territory to an invading Prussian army, and Glatz was formally annexed by the Treaty of Breslau. See also Lands of the Bohemian Crown. He was the son of a teacher and organist who gave him his first music lessons. After further training in Breslau (now Wroc≈Çaw) - about north of Glatz - he worked first as an organist in Franckstein in Silesia.An 18th century map of Glatz County shows Glatz (Kladsko) in the centre, Eckersdorf to the NW just in the NeuRoda district, and Franckstein to the NE, just by the title cartouche. In 1810 he went to Vienna, where he soon became known for his performances on the \\"mouth harp\\"Previously known as the 'Mundharmonika' in German. (i.e. Jew's harp). In addition, he played the cello and gave music lessons. In 1816 he was engaged as choral conductor and music director at the Augustinian Church, Vienna (the 'Hofpfarr Kirche' or Court parish church).

These were concert seasons which promoted music by German-speaking composers, in competition against the then current craze for Rossini.

Beethoven's Letters etc. Beethoven's music figured prominently: during the first two seasons of the 'Concerts Spirituels' of 1820‚Äì21 and 1821‚Äì22 his eight completed symphonies were performed (the 9th was finished in 1824); Leopoldine Blahetka, aged about 11, played the B flat Concerto on 3 April 1820; and the cantatas Meeresstille und gl√ºckliche Fahrt and Christ on the Mount of Olives, as well as the Mass in C were given.Thayer's Life of Beethoven, Volume 2, pp. 770-1. By Alexander Wheelock Thayer; eds. Elliot Forbes, Hermann Deiters, Hugo Riemann; ed. Henry Edward Krehbiel. The choir was thought to be much better than the orchestra; the first concerts seem to have been little more than 'run-throughs' with a band of dedicated amateurs ('dilettanti') scraping their way at sight through the works of Beethoven, who referred to the concerts in his conversation books.Thayer's Life of Beethoven, Volume 2 p. 770 By Alexander Wheelock Thayer, Elliot Forbes, Hermann Deiters, Hugo Riemann, Henry Edward Krehbiel. Gebauer wrote a number of songs, which were published; other some compositions of e.g. sacred music remained in MS.

The star has a visual magnitude of 5.19, making it visible to the naked eye from brighter suburban skies (according to the Bortle scale). Parallax measurements with the Hipparcos spacecraft put it at a distance of roughly from the Sun. This is a chemically peculiar star and was first classified as a silicon star by American astronomer William Morgan in 1933. The stellar spectrum displays an overabundance of heavier elements; particularly silicon and gallium. These abundances may be caused by the magnetic field of the star, which produces concentrations of the observed elements in the outer atmosphere. It is a Œ±¬≤ Canum Venaticorum-type variable star, ranging in magnitude from 5.15 down to 5.22. These variations are likely due to large spots or rings on the side of the star being observed. The star and its companion orbit each other closely with a period of a week and an eccentricity of 0.18. The rotation period of the primary star has become locked to its orbit, so that one face is always pointed toward its companion. The abundance of gallium and silicon varies in a sinusoidal pattern that matches this period. The primary has around 2.9 times the mass of the Sun, 3.5 times the Sun's radius, and is emitting 190 the luminosity of the Sun. The effective temperature of the star's photosphere is 12,600 K, giving it the blue-white hue of a B-type star.
