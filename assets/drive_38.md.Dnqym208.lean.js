Miguel Relvas, o Bem-Amado Vis√£o magazine, (September 4, 2011) Miguel Relvas also lists in his official biography that he was chairman of the Knights Templar Tourism Region Organization (2001‚Äì02), Chairman of the Board of the General Meeting (sic) of the Middle (sic) Tagus Urban Community (2004‚Äì09), and Member of the Board of Trustees of the Portugal-Brazil Foundation (Funda√ß√£o Luso-Brasileira). Controversies =Ethical and legal issues= Miguel Relvas has been involved in some controversies although he was never formally charged. Known instances include: Supposed pocketing and abusing of official allowances - As a member of Parliament, Miguel Relvas was one of several Portuguese parliamentarians to have pocketed out-of-town housing allowances despite living in Lisbon, and airfare allowances for trips not made or made in lower classes of service than entitled. As president of the municipal assembly of Tomar, he made ‚Ç¨30,000 in phone calls on his official phone paid for by the municipality. Supposed cronyism - Upon becoming Minister of Parliamentary Affairs in 2011, Miguel Relvas appointed for himself and his four secretaries of state a total of 56 advisors (\\"assessores\\") and support staff‚Äîa remarkably high number in view of the fact that the total staff of his Ministry was only 65.Quase 500 nomea√ß√µes para os gabinetes em dois mesesDi√°rio de Not√≠cias, (August 28, 2011)] The most blatant case was the hiring of his previous chauffeur from Parliament for ‚Ç¨2,448 per month (compared with less than ‚Ç¨1,000 for most government drivers) despite already having three Ministry chauffeurs at his disposal. Supposed Influence Peddling - As business man, Miguel Relvas has worked for private companies (see above) seen as close to his PSD political party and geared towards doing business through high-level political connections in Portugal, Brazil and Africa. The Head the Portuguese Order of the Architects claimed in July 2012 that when Miguel Relvas was secretary of state in 2003 he sought to influence the awarding of a public procurement contract in favour of a company where (future Prime-Minister) Pedro Passos Coelho worked. Miguel Relvas refuted the allegation and said he was initiating a libel lawsuit Miguel Relvas processa Helena Roseta por difama√ß√£o Di√°rio de Not√≠cias, (July 17, 2012) but, in October 2012, it emerged that indeed Pedro Passos Coelho had personally sought to obtain the awarding of such contract for the company he represented‚ÄîTecnoforma,Relvas e Passos agiram em simult√¢neo para angariar contratos para a Tecnoforma Publico, (October 13, 2012) with Miguel Relvas' official backing.Relvas e Passos agiram juntos para angariar contratos: os documentos Publico, (October 14, 2012) Moreover, it was also revealed that during Miguel Relvas' term as Secretary of State of Local Administration the large majority of EU financial support for two training programs in Portugal's center region were channelled to Tecnoforma but that the intended results never materialized.Fundos europeus: Empresa de que Passos foi gestor dominou fundo gerido por Relvas Publico, (October 9, 2012)Fundo Social Europeu: Relvas ajudou empresa ligada a Passos a ter monop√≥lio de forma√ß√£o em aer√≥dromos do Centro Publico, (October 10, 2012) The investigation was withdrawn. Supposed inflation of his academic credentials - Miguel Relvas obtained a bachelor's degree only in 2007 and under unusual circumstances (see below). It also emerged that when he became a member of the Portuguese Parliament in 1985, he had officially declared that he was a second-year law student, when in fact he had completed just one first-year course prior to dropping out. Miguel Relvas explained in 2012 that there had been \\"a lapse\\" and he had corrected that information latter in the year in a subsequent declaration. Miguel Relvas admite lapso nos registos biogr√°ficos na Assembleia da Rep√∫blica, SIC Not√≠cias (July 4, 2012) In characteristic display of chutzpah, Miguel Relvas announced right after obtaining his controversial BA degree that he was going to pursue a masters degree in political science.

Silva Carvalho resigned as Director of SIED in 2010 and, according to criminal charges against him made by the Portuguese attorney-general, he took with him unauthorized copies of the personal files of many prominent Portuguese figures.:pt:Jorge Jacob Silva Carvalho#Caso das Secretas For undetermined reasons, Miguel Relvas first sought to limit press exposure of the case (see below) and then to distance himself from it, including by stating under oath that he had only once casually met Silva Carvalho. Media reports confirmed that Silva Carvalho and Relvas had met in person at least 3 times and communicated with each other by SMS. The \\"caso das secretas\\" has an internal PSD party dimension as one of the targeted personalities in Silva Carvalho's stolen personal files was former Portuguese prime-minister Francisco Pinto Balsem√£o who, like Relvas, is from the social-democratic party PSD [https://expresso.sapo.pt/ex-espiao-tinha-relatorio-sobre-diretor-do- expresso=f729418, Expresso (May 29, 2012) but is at odds with Relvas over the privatization of a public TV channel that would increase competition on the channel (SIC) owned by Balsem√£o media group. Perhaps for these reasons, the Expresso weekly newspaper, also owned by Balsem√£o's media group, has joined the daily newspaper P√∫blico in seeking to show Miguel Relvas' association to the \\"caso das secretas.\\" Jornal \\"P√∫blico\\": Miguel Relvas acusado de amea√ßar jornalista, P√∫blico (May 18, 2012) Alleged intimidation of the press - Miguel Relvas found himself in a potentially criminal situation when the P√∫blico daily newspaper reported that he attempted to blackmail one of its journalists not to pursue a story on \\"caso das secretas\\" (see above).

Miguel Relvas ilibado pela ERC, Expresso (June 19, 2012) Denial of responsibility - To date, Miguel Relvas has never acknowledged wrongdoing or impropriety in any of his political, business, or academic endeavors, even when he was compelled to resign as a result of the irregularities in the attribution of his university degree (see below). =Connections to the Freemasonry= Miguel Relvas is said to be a Freemason and high-ranking member of the Universalis Lisbon masonic lodge that congregates important Portuguese politicians and businessmen. Miguel Relvas na mesma obedi√™ncia ma√ß√≥nica do presidente da Lus√≥fona , Expresso (July 12, 2012) However, Freemasonry activities in Portugal are largely secretive and Miguel Relvas has not publicly confirmed or denied his membership. =Academic qualifications= In July 2012 Miguel Relvas found himself embroiled in public controversy in connection with the degree he obtained from Lusophone University/Universidade Lus√≥fona with little coursework. Miguel Relvas enrolled in 1984 at Universidade Livre, of Lisbon, where he sought to obtain a law-degree but completed just one course (political science and constitutional law) with the lowest passing grade (10 out of 20). In 1985 he switched majors from law to history but did not complete any course and eventually dropped out until 1995 when he enrolled at the international relations program of Universidade Lus√≠ada (which was the rebaptized Universidade Livre after its courses lost their accreditation) but again did not to complete any courses. In 2006, following the enactment of the Bologna Process that allowed awarding of university coursework credits to reflect professional experience under the ECTS-credits framework, Miguel Relvas managed to obtain from Universidade Lus√≥fona 160 credit equivalencies out of the 180 necessary to obtain a bachelor's degree in political science and international relations. The credit equivalencies were awarded on the basis of his \\"rich professional experience\\" by the Dean of the university himself (Fernando Santos Neves) and were not made explicit in terms of the individual courses exempted. Miguel Relvas was only required to complete 4 courses (which he did with comfortable grades although there seem to be no records of him attending classes or taking tests) and was awarded in 2007 a BA degree with GPA of 11 (out of 20). Relvas fez num ano licenciatura com 36 cadeiras distribu√≠das por seis semestres, SIC Not√≠cias (July 4, 2012) It remains unclear what role the University's Board (Conselho Cient√≠fico) played in this process and most of its members at the time have distanced themselves from this decision, which seems to have been personally taken by Dean Santos Neves, Equival√™ncias de Relvas assinadas por uma √∫nica pessoa, Di√°rio de Not√≠cias (July 11, 2012) who resigned on July 12, 2012 from his Dean position but stayed with Universidade Lus√≥fona in another capacity. Portugal's Minister of Education Nuno Crato initially declined to comment on Relvas' degree, , Crato n√£o comenta caso e vai rever regime jur√≠dico, Di√°rio de Not√≠cias, (July 9, 2012) but in October 2010 he ordered an auditing of all of Universidade Lus√≥fona's degrees by accreditation, which could result in the revocation of some of those degrees including Relvas'. , Licenciatura de Miguel Relvas vai ser revista por ordem de Nuno Crato, Dinheiro Vivo, (October, 2012) The audit was supposed to be ready in \\"60 days\\" (i.e. before end-2012), but results were held until April 2013, just prior to which Miguel Relvas resigned abruptly and without acknowledging the audit's results as a reason for his resignation. The audit confirmed that many of Relvas' course equivalencies were attributed without plausible experience or even experience of any sort and that he had taken no written exams in the four courses for which he did not obtain equivalencies. (needs citation when audit results come out). The Ministry of Education referred the process to the Portugal's Public Attorney's Office with a view to the revocation of Miguel Relvas' university degree, which took place by court decision in June 2016. In popular culture In June 2012, Miguel Relvas gained instant and widespread name recognition thanks to the exceptional circumstances of his university degree attribution (see above). This is illustrated by two new memes devoted to Miguel Relvas. The first was a powerful, anti-government slogan \\"VAI ESTUDAR, RELVAS!\\" (Go Study, Relvas!). The second consisted of all sorts of ironic claims to academic degrees on the basis of equivalencies for vaguely related activities (for ex: engineer for having played with Lego blocks). The best example was when Pope Benedict XVI announced his resignation in February 2013, a new Relvas joke immediately went viral saying he was going to \\"ask for an equivalency to Pope on the basis of having attended a Catholic mass.\\" Personal life Miguel Relvas was born in Lisbon in 1961, but returned with his parents to Portuguese Angola, where he grew up with two younger brothers until just after the Carnation Revolution of April 1974 in Portugal that led to Angola's independence and the mass exodus of Portuguese citizens. The family resettled in the Tomar area of Portugal, where Relvas went to high school. Miguel Relvas married in 1989 and, in 1992, a daughter was born from that union. He separated after becoming government Minister in 2011 and publicly assumed a relationship with Marta Sousa a PSD campaign staff 17 years his junior he had met in 2010 when she worked in the publishing of a book by Passos Coelho. , Casal Relvas faz Festa Discreta, Correio da Manh√£ (February 9, 2013) Miguel Relvas apaixonado, fama.sapo.pt (July 13, 2012) He obtained a divorce in 2012 since he and Marta announced their wedding for March 2013.

The fort was chosen as the capital of the Southwest Territory in 1790, and the city, named for Secretary of War Henry Knox, was platted the following year. Knoxville became the first capital of the State of Tennessee in 1796, and grew steadily during the early 19th century as a way station for westward-bound migrants and as a commercial center for nearby mountain communities. The arrival of the railroad in the 1850s led to a boom in the city's population and commercial activity. While a Southern city, Knoxville was home to a strong pro-Union element during the secession crisis of the early 1860s, and remained bitterly divided throughout the Civil War. The city was occupied by Confederate forces until September 1863, when Union forces entered the city unopposed. Confederate forces laid siege to the city later that year, but retreated after failing to breach the city's fortifications during the Battle of Fort Sanders. Following the war, business leaders, many from the North, established major iron and textile industries in Knoxville. As a nexus between rural towns in Southern Appalachia and the nation's great manufacturing centers, Knoxville grew to become the third-largest wholesaling center in the South. Tennessee marble, extracted from quarries on the city's periphery, was used in the construction of numerous monumental buildings across the country, earning Knoxville the nickname, \\"The Marble City.\\" Knoxville's economy slowed in the early 1900s. Political factioning hampered revitalization efforts throughout much of the 20th century, though the creation of federal entities such as the Tennessee Valley Authority in the 1930s and the ten-fold expansion of the University of Tennessee helped keep the economy stable. Beginning in the late 1960s, a city council more open to change, along with economic diversification, urban renewal, and the hosting of the 1982 World's Fair, helped the city revitalize to some extent.W.

A follow-up expedition led by Juan Pardo may have visited village sites in the Little Tennessee Valley in 1567. The records of these two expeditions suggest the area was part of a Muskogean chiefdom known as Chiaha, which was subject to the Coosa chiefdom further to the south.Charles Hudson, The Juan Pardo Expeditions: Explorations of the Carolinas and Tennessee, 1566-1568 (Tuscaloosa, Ala.: University of Alabama Press, 2005), pp. 36-45, 62-63. By the 18th century, the Cherokee had become the dominant tribe in the East Tennessee region, although they were consistently at war with the Creeks and Shawnee.Cora Tula Watters, \\"Shawnee.\\" The Encyclopedia of Appalachia (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), 278-279.Ima Stephens, \\"Creek.\\" The Encyclopedia of Appalachia (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), 252-253. The Cherokee people called the Knoxville area kuwanda'talun'yi, which means \\"Mulberry Place.\\"James Mooney, Myths of the Cherokee and Sacred Formulas of the Cherokee (Nashville: Charles Elder, 1972), 526. Most Cherokee habitation in the area was concentrated in the Overhill settlements along the Little Tennessee River, southwest of Knoxville. =Early Exploration and late-18th Century Politics= By the early 1700s, traders from South Carolina were visiting the Overhill towns regularly, and following the discovery of Cumberland Gap in 1748, long hunters from Virginia began pouring into the Tennessee Valley. At the outbreak of the French and Indian War in 1754, the Cherokee supported the British, and the British in return constructed Fort Loudoun in 1756 to protect the Overhill towns from the French and their allies. After a falling out, however, the Cherokee attacked the fort and killed its occupants in 1760. A peace expedition to the Overhill towns led by Henry Timberlake passed along the river through what is now Knoxville in December 1761.Henry Timberlake, Samuel Williams (ed.), Memoirs, 1756-1765 (Marietta, Georgia: Continental Book Co., 1948), p. 54. The Cherokee supported the British during the American Revolution, and after the war, North Carolina, which considered the Tennessee Valley part of its territory, deemed Cherokee claims to the region void. North Carolina made plans to cede its Trans- Appalachian territory to the federal government, but decided to open up the lands to settlement first. In 1783, land speculator William Blount and his brother, John Gray Blount, convinced North Carolina to pass a law offering lands in the Tennessee Valley for sale.Stanley Folmsbee and Lucile Deaderick, \\"The Founding of Knoxville,\\" East Tennessee Historical Society Publications, Vol. 13 (1941), pp. 3-20. Later that year, an expedition consisting of James White (1747-1820), James Connor, Robert Love, and Francis Alexander Ramsey, explored the Upper Tennessee Valley, and discovered the future site of Knoxville. Taking advantage of Blount's land-grab act, White took out a claim for the site shortly afterward. Early Knoxville =White's Fort= In 1786, White moved to the future site of Knoxville, where he and fellow explorer James Connor built what became known as White's Fort. The site straddled a hill that was bounded by the river on the south, creeks (First Creek and Second Creek) on the east and west, and a swampy declivity on the north. The fort, which originally stood along modern State Street, consisted of four heavily timbered cabins connected by an palisade, enclosing one- quarter acre of ground.J.G.M. Ramsey, The Annals of Tennessee to the End of the Eighteenth Century (Johnson City, Tenn.: Overmountain Press, 1999). White also erected a mill for grinding grain on nearby First Creek. White's Fort represented the western extreme of the so-called State of Franklin, which Tennessee settlers organized in 1784 after North Carolina reneged on its plans to cede its western territory to the federal government. James White supported the State of Franklin, and served as its Speaker of the Senate in 1786. The federal government never recognized the State of Franklin, however, and by 1789, its supporters once again pledged allegiance to North Carolina.William MacArthur, Lucile Deaderick (ed.), \\"Knoxville's History: An Interpretation,\\" Heart of the Valley: A History of Knoxville, Tennessee (Knoxville, Tenn.: East Tennessee Historical Society, 1976). In 1789, White, William Blount, and former State of Franklin leader John Sevier, now members of the North Carolina state legislature, helped convince the state to ratify the United States Constitution. Following ratification, North Carolina ceded control of its Tennessee territory to the federal government. In May 1790, the United States created the Southwest Territory, which included Tennessee, and President George Washington appointed Blount the territory's governor. =Establishment of Knoxville= Map showing Charles McClung's 1791 plat and 1795 extension of Knoxville Blount immediately moved to White's Fort (chosen for its central location) to begin resolving land disputes between the Cherokee and white settlers in the region. In the Summer of 1791, he met with forty-one Cherokee chiefs at the mouth of First Creek to negotiate the Treaty of Holston, which was signed on July 2 of that year. The treaty moved the boundary of Cherokee lands westward to the Clinch River and southwestward to the Little Tennessee River. While Blount initially sought to place the territorial capital at the confluence of the Clinch and Tennessee rivers (near modern Kingston), where he had land claims, he was unable to convince the Cherokee to completely relinquish this area, and thus settled on White's Fort as the capital. James White set aside land for a new town, which initially consisted of the area now bounded by Church Avenue, Walnut Street, First Creek, and the river, in what is now Downtown Knoxville.Mary Rothrock (ed.), The French Broad-Holston Country: A History of Knox County, Tennessee (Knoxville, Tenn.: East Tennessee Historical Society, 1946), map facing page 33. White's son-in-law, Charles McClung, surveyed the land and divided it into 64 half-acre lots. Lots were set aside for a church and cemetery, a courthouse, a jail, and a college. On October 3, 1791, a lottery was held for those wishing to purchase lots in the new city, which was named \\"Knoxville\\" in honor of Blount's superior, Secretary of War Henry Knox. Along with Blount and McClung, those who purchased lots in the city included merchants Hugh Dunlap, Thomas Humes, and Nathaniel and Samuel Cowan, newspaper publisher George Roulstone, the Reverend Samuel Carrick, frontiersman John Adair (who had built a fort just to the north in what is now Fountain City), and tavern keeper John Chisholm. =Knoxville in the 1790s= Howard Pyle's depiction of a scout warning Knoxvillians of the approach of a hostile Cherokee (Chickamauga) force in 1793 Following the sale of lots, Knoxville's leaders set about constructing a courthouse and jail. A garrison of federal soldiers, under the command of David Henley, erected a blockhouse in Knoxville in 1792. The Cowan brothers, Nathaniel and Samuel, opened the city's first general store in August 1792, and John Chisholm's tavern was in operation by December 1792. The city's first newspaper, the Knoxville Gazette, was established by George Roulstone in November 1791. In 1794, Blount College, the forerunner of the University of Tennessee, was chartered, with Samuel Carrick as its first president. Carrick also established the city's first church, the First Presbyterian Church, though a building wasn't constructed until 1816. Lloyd Branson's The Blockhouse at Knoxville, Tennessee, showing the federal blockhouse built in 1792 In many ways, early Knoxville was a typical rowdy late-18th century frontier village. A detached group of Cherokee, known as the Chickamaugas, refused to recognize the Holston treaty, and remained a constant threat. In September 1793, a large force of Chickamaugas and Creeks marched on Knoxville, and massacred the inhabitants of Cavet's Station (near modern Bearden) before dispersing. Outlaws roamed the city's periphery, among them the Harpe Brothers, who murdered at least one settler in 1797 before fleeing to Kentucky. Abishai Thomas, an associate of Blount who visited Knoxville in 1794, noted that the city was full of taverns and tippling houses, no churches, and that the blockhouse's jail was overcrowded with criminals. In 1795, James White set aside more land for the growing city, allowing it to expand northward to modern Clinch Avenue and westward to modern Henley Street.Samuel Heiskell, Andrew Jackson and Early Tennessee History (Nashville: Ambrose Publishing Company, 1918), pp. 46-81. A census that year showed that Tennessee had a large enough population to apply for statehood. In January 1796, delegates from across Tennessee, including Blount, Sevier, and Andrew Jackson, convened in Knoxville to draw up a constitution for the new state, which was admitted to the Union on June 1, 1796. Knoxville was chosen as the initial capital of the state. Antebellum Knoxville =Frontier Capital= While Knoxville's population grew steadily in the early 1800s, most new arrivals were westward- bound migrants staying in the town for a brief period. By 1807, some 200 migrants were passing through the town every day. Cattle drovers, who specialized in driving herds of cattle across the mountains to markets in South Carolina, were also frequent visitors to the city. The city's merchants acquired goods from Baltimore and Philadelphia via wagon trains. French botanist Andr√© Michaux visited Knoxville in 1802, and reported the presence of approximately 100 houses and 10 \\"well-stocked\\" stores. While there was \\"brisk commerce\\" at the city's stores, Michaux noted, the only industries in the city were tanneries and blacksmiths.Andre Michaux, Travels to the Westward of the Allegany Mountains in the States of Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee, In the Year 1802 (London: Barnard and Sultzer, 1805), p. 89. In February 1804, itinerant Methodist preacher Lorenzo Dow passed through Knoxville, and reported the widespread presence of a religious phenomenon in which worshippers would fall to the ground and go into seizure-like convulsions, or \\"jerks,\\" at religious rallies.James Lee, Naphtali Luccock, and James Dixon, The Illustrious History of Methodism (New York: Methodist Magazine Publishing Company, 1900), p. 376. Illinois governor John Reynolds, who studied law in Knoxville, recalled a raucous, anti-British celebration held in the city on July 4, 1812, at the onset of the War of 1812.John Reynolds, Reynolds' History of Illinois (Chicago: Chicago Historical Society, 1879), pp. 65-66. On October 27, 1815, Knoxville officially incorporated as a city. The city's new charter set up an alderman-mayor form of government, in which a Board of Aldermen was popularly elected, and in turn selected a mayor from one of their own. This remained Knoxville's style of government until the early 20th century, though the city's charter was amended in 1838 to allow for popular election of mayor as well. In January 1816, Knoxville's newly elected Board of Aldermen chose Judge Thomas Emmerson (1773-1837) as the city's first mayor. With the exceptions of the years 1802, 1807, 1811 and 1812, Knoxville remained the capital of Tennessee until 1817 when the state legislature was moved to Murfreesboro. =Sectionalism and Struggles with Isolation= Early-19th century flatboat on the Tennessee River Historian William MacArthur once described Knoxville as a \\"product and prisoner of its environment.\\" Throughout the first half of the 19th century, Knoxville's economic growth was stunted by its isolation. The rugged terrain of the Appalachian Mountains made travel in and out of the city by road difficult, with wagon trips to Philadelphia or Baltimore requiring a round trip of several months. Flatboats were in use as early as 1795 to carry goods from Knoxville to New Orleans via the Tennessee, Ohio, and Mississippi rivers,Stanley Folmsbee, Mary Rothrock (ed.), \\"Transportation Prior to the Civil War,\\" The French Broad-Holston Country: A History of Knox County, Tennessee (Knoxville, Tenn.: East Tennessee Historical Society, 1972). but river hazards near Muscle Shoals and Chattanooga made such a trek risky. During the 1790s, several roads, many of which followed old Indian trails, were constructed that connected Knoxville to other settlements across East Tennessee. The first of these roads to be constructed was Kingston Pike which was laid out by Charles McClung in 1792. Beginning around 1810, stagecoach service was introduced to Knoxville and continued to operate prior to the Civil War. Known as the \\"Great Western Line,\\" the route ran westward from Raleigh, North Carolina, over the mountains to Knoxville, and then continued west to Nashville. Although the introduction of stagecoach service somewhat helped to break Knoxville's boundaries of isolation, the trips were often long and rough. During the 1820s and 1830s, state legislators from East Tennessee continuously bickered with legislators from Middle and West Tennessee over funding for road and navigational improvements. East Tennesseans felt the state had squandered the proceeds from the sale of land in the Hiwassee District (1819) on a failed state bank, rather than on badly needed internal improvements.Stanley Folmsbee, Sectionalism and Internal Improvements in Tennessee, 1796-1845 (Knoxville, Tenn.: East Tennessee Historical Society, 1939), pp. 28-32, 54-55, 83-86, 132, 161. It wasn't until 1828 that a steamboat, the Atlas, managed to navigate Muscle Shoals and make it upriver to Knoxville. River improvements in the 1830s allowed Knoxville semi-annual access to the Mississippi, though by this time the city's merchants had shifted their focus to railroad construction. =Life in Knoxville, 1816-1854= East Tennessee College, the forerunner of the University of Tennessee, moved to \\"The Hill\\" west of downtown Knoxville in 1826 In 1816, as the Gazette was in decline, businessmen Frederick Heiskell and Hugh Brown established a newspaper, the Knoxville Register. Along with the Register, Heiskell and Brown published a pro-emancipation newsletter, the Western Monitor and Religious Observer, as well as books such as John Haywood's Civil and Political History of the State of Tennessee (1823), one of the state's first comprehensive histories. The Register celebrated the move of East Tennessee College (the new name of Blount College following its rechartering in 1807) to Barbara Hill in 1826, and encouraged the trustees of the Knoxville Female Academy, which had been chartered in 1811, to finally hire a faculty and hold its first classes in 1827.Laura Luttrell, \\"One Hundred Years of a Female Academy: The Knoxville Female Academy, 1811‚Äì1846; The East Tennessee Female Institute, 1846‚Äì1911.\\" East Tennessee Historical Society Publications, Vol. 17 (1945), p. 72. Knoxville in the late-1850s, viewed from the west along Cumberland Avenue In the April 1839 issue of the Southern Literary Messenger, a traveler who had recently visited Knoxville described the people of the city as \\"moral, sociable and hospitable,\\" but \\"with less refinement of mind and manners\\" than people in older towns.H. Ruffner, \\"Notes of a Tour From Virginia to Tennessee, In the Months of July and August, 1838,\\" Southern Literary Messenger, Vol. 5, No. 4 (April 1839), p. 270. In 1842, English travel writer James Gray Smith reported that the city was home to a university, an academy, a \\"ladies' school,\\" three churches, two banks, two hotels, 25-30 stores, and several \\"handsome country residences\\" occupied by people \\"as aristocratic as even an Englishman... could possibly desire.\\"James Gray Smith, A Brief Historical, Statistical and Descriptive Review of East Tennessee, U.S.A. (London: J. Leath, 1842), p. 22. In 1816, merchant Thomas Humes began building a lavish hotel on Gay Street, later known as the Lamar House Hotel, which for decades would provide a gathering place for the city's elite.Dean Novelli, \\"On a Corner of Gay Street: A History of the Lamar House‚ÄîBijou Theater, Knoxville, Tennessee, 1817 ‚Äì 1985.\\" East Tennessee Historical Society Publications, Vol. 56 (1984), pp. 3-45. In 1848, the Tennessee School for the Deaf opened in Knoxville, giving an important boost to the city's economy. In 1854, land speculators Joseph Mabry and William Swan donated land for the creation of Market Square, creating a venue for farmers from the surrounding region to sell their produce.Jack Neely, Market Square: A History of the Most Democratic Place on Earth (Knoxville, Tenn.: Market Square District Association, 2009). =The Arrival of the Railroads= East Tennessee, Virginia and Georgia rail yard at the intersection of Gay Street (lower right) and Depot Street, as it appeared in 1871; the roundhouse has since been demolished and replaced by the Southern Terminal As early as the 1820s, Knoxville's business leaders viewed railroads-- then a relatively new form of transportation-- as a solution to the city's economic isolation. Led by banker J. G. M. Ramsey (1797-1884), Knoxville business leaders joined calls to build a rail line connecting the city to Cincinnati, Ohio to the north and Charleston, South Carolina to the southeast, which led to the chartering of the Louisville, Cincinnati and Charleston Railroad (LC&C;) in 1836. The Hiwassee Railroad, chartered two years later, was to connect this line with a rail line in Dalton, Georgia. In spite of Knoxvillians' enthusiasm (the city celebrated the passage of a state appropriations bill for the LC&C; with a 56-gun salute in 1837), the LC&C; was doomed by a financial recession in the late 1830s, and construction of the Hiwassee Railroad was stalled by lack of funding amidst continued sectional bickering. The Hiwassee was rechartered as the East Tennessee and Georgia Railroad in 1847, and construction finally began the following year. The first train rolled into Knoxville on June 22, 1855, to great fanfare. With the arrival of the railroad, Knoxville expanded rapidly. The city's northern boundary extended northward to absorb the tracks, and its population grew from about 2,000 in 1850 to over 5,000 in 1860. Local crop prices spiked, the number of wholesaling firms in Knoxville grew from 4 to 14,Robert McKenzie, Lincolnites and Rebels: A Divided Town in the American Civil War (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006). and two new factories-- the Knoxville Manufacturing Company, which made steam engines, and Shepard, Leeds and Hoyt, which built railroad cars-- were established. In 1859, the city had four hotels, at least seven factories, six churches, three newspapers, four banks, and over 45 stores. The Secession crisis in Knoxville =Antebellum Politics in Knoxville= Early-19th century Knoxville was often caught in the middle of the sectionalist fighting between East Tennessee and the state as a whole. Following the presidential election of 1836, in which Knoxvillian Hugh Lawson White (James White's son) ran against Andrew Jackson's hand-picked successor, Martin Van Buren, political divisions in the city manifested along Whig (anti-Jackson) and Democratic party lines. In 1839, W.B.A. Ramsey won the city's first popular mayoral election by a single vote, illustrating how strong these divisions had become.Aelred Gray and Susan Adams, Lucile Deaderick (ed.), \\"Government,\\" Heart of the Valley: A History of Knoxville, Tennessee (Knoxville, Tenn.: East Tennessee Historical Society, 1976). In 1849, William G. \\"Parson\\" Brownlow moved his radical Whig newspaper, the Whig, to Knoxville. Brownlow's editorial style, which often involved vicious personal attacks, intensified the already-sharp political divisions within the city. In 1857, he quarreled with the pro-Secession Southern Citizen and its publishers, Knoxville businessman William G. Swan and Irish Patriot John Mitchell (then in exile), to the point of threatening Swan with a pistol.E. Merton Coulter, William G. Brownlow: Fighting Parson of the Southern Highlands (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 1999). Brownlow's attacks drove Whig-turned-Democrat John Hervey Crozier from public life,William Gannaway Brownlow, Sketches of the Rise, Progress, and Decline of Secession (Philadelphia: G.W. Childs, 1862). and forced two directors of the failed Bank of East Tennessee, A.R. Crozier and William Churchwell, to flee town. He brought charges of swindling against a third director, J.G.M. Ramsey, the former railroad promoter and a staunch Democrat. Following the nationwide collapse of the Whig Party in 1854, many of Knoxville's Whigs, including Brownlow, were unwilling to support the new Republican Party formed by northern Whigs, and instead aligned themselves with the anti-immigrant American Party (commonly called the \\"Know Nothings\\"). When this movement disintegrated, Knoxville's ex-Whigs turned to the Opposition Party. In 1858, Opposition Party candidate Horace Maynard, with Brownlow's endorsement, soundly defeated Democratic candidate J.C. Ramsey (J.G.M. Ramsey's son) for the 2nd district's congressional seat. =Knoxville and Slavery= By 1860, slaves comprised 22% of Knoxville's population, which was higher than the percentage across East Tennessee (approximately 10%) but lower than the rest of the South (about one-third).C. E. Allred, et al., \\"Farming From the Beginning to 1860,\\" The French Broad-Holston Country: A History of Knox County, Tennessee (Knoxville, Tenn.: East Tennessee Historical Society, 1972). Most of Knox County's farms were small (only one was larger than ) and typically focused on livestock or other products that weren't labor-intensive. The city was home to a chapter of the American Colonization Society, led by St. John's Episcopal Church rector Thomas William Humes. While Knoxville was far less dependent on slavery than the rest of the South, most of the city's leaders, even those who opposed secession, were pro-slavery at the onset of the Civil War. Some, such as J.G.M. Ramsey, had always been pro-slavery. However, numerous prominent Knoxvillians, including Brownlow, Oliver Perry Temple, and Horace Maynard, had been pro-emancipation in the 1830s, but, for reasons not fully understood, were pro-slavery by the 1850s. Temple later wrote that he and others abandoned their anti-slavery stance due to the social ostracism abolitionists faced in the South. Historian Robert McKenzie, however, argues that the aggression of northern abolitionists toward Southerners pushed many Southern abolitionists toward pro-slavery views, though he points out that no one explanation neatly explains this shift. In any case, by the late-1850s, most of Knoxville's leaders were pro-slavery. The views of Brownlow and Ramsey, bitter enemies on many fronts, were virtually identical on the issue of slavery.McKenzie (p. 36) notes that Ramsey called for the reopening of the Atlantic slave trade. Brownlow revealed similar views in his debate with Abram Tyne in 1857. =The secession debate in Knoxville= Engraving in Brownlow's Sketches, showing Confederate recruits shooting at Union supporter Charles Douglas during a Gay Street rally in April 1861 The election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 drastically intensified the secession debate in Knoxville, and the city's leaders met on November 26 to discuss the issue. Those who favored secession, such as J.G.M. Ramsey, believed it was the only way to ensure the rights of Southerners. Those who rejected secession, such as Maynard and Temple, believed that East Tennesseans, most of whom were yeoman farmers, would be rendered subservient to a government dominated by Southern planters. In February 1861, Tennessee held a vote on whether or not to hold a statewide convention to consider seceding and joining the Confederacy. In Knoxville, 77% voted against this measure, affirming the city's allegiance to the Union. Throughout the first half of 1861, Brownlow and J. Austin Sperry (the radical secessionist editor of the Knoxville Register) assailed one another mercilessly in their respective papers, and Union and Secessionist leaders blasted one another in speeches across the region. Simultaneous Union and Confederate recruiting rallies were held on Gay Street. Following the attack on Fort Sumter in April, Governor Isham Harris made moves to align the state with the Confederacy, prompting the region's Unionists to form the East Tennessee Convention, which met at Knoxville on May 30, 1861. The convention submitted a petition to Governor Isham Harris, calling his actions undemocratic and unconstitutional.\\"Proceedings of the E.T. Convention: Held at Knoxville, May 30th and 31st, 1861 and at Greeneville, on the 17th day of June, 1861, and following days\\" (Knoxville, Tenn.: H. Barry's Book and Job Office, 1861). In a second statewide vote on June 8, 1861, a majority of East Tennesseans still rejected secession, but the measure succeeded in Middle and West Tennessee, and the state thus joined the Confederacy. In Knoxville, the vote was 777 to 377 in favor of secession. McKenzie points out, however, that 436 Confederate soldiers from outside Knox County were stationed in Knoxville at the time and were allowed to vote. If these votes are removed, the tally in Knoxville was 377 to 341 against secession. Following the vote, the East Tennessee Union Convention petitioned the state legislature, asking that East Tennessee be allowed to form a separate, Union-aligned state. The petition was rejected, however, and Governor Harris ordered Confederate troops into the region.Oliver P. Temple, East Tennessee and the Civil War (Johnson City, Tenn.: Overmountain Press, 1995). The Civil War =Confederate Occupation= Engraving from Brownlow's Sketches, showing Confederate soldiers marching Union prisoners through the streets of Knoxville in December 1861 The Confederate commander in East Tennessee, Felix Zollicoffer, initially took a lenient stance toward the region's Unionists. In November 1861, however, Union guerrillas destroyed several railroad bridges across East Tennessee, prompting Confederate authorities to institute martial law. Suspected bridge-burning conspirators were tried and executed, and hundreds of other Unionists were jailed, causing the county jail at the southwestern corner of Main and Walnut streets to become overcrowded with prisoners. Brownlow was among those arrested, but was released after a few weeks. He spent 1862 touring the north in an attempt to rally support for a Union invasion of East Tennessee. Zollicoffer was replaced by John Crittenden in November 1861, and Crittenden was in turn replaced by Edmund Kirby Smith in March 1862, as Confederate authorities consistently struggled to find an acceptable commander for its East Tennessee forces. In June 1862, George Wilson, one of Andrews' Raiders, was tried and convicted in Knoxville. In July 1862, 40 Union soldiers captured by Nathan Bedford Forrest near Murfreesboro were marched down Gay Street, with Confederate soldiers jokingly reading aloud their personal correspondence afterward. The divided 2nd District sent representatives to both the U.S. Congress (Horace Maynard) and the Confederate Congress (William G. Swan) in 1861. Maynard, along with fellow East Tennessee Unionist Andrew Johnson, consistently pleaded with President Lincoln to send troops into the region. For nearly two years, however, Union generals in Kentucky consistently ignored orders to march on Knoxville, and instead focused on Middle Tennessee. On June 20, 1863, William P. Sanders's Union cavalry briefly laid siege to Knoxville, but a Confederate citizens' guard within the city managed to fend them off. =Union Occupation= Harper's Weekly illustration showing Knoxville Unionists welcoming General Ambrose Burnside into the city in September 1863 In August 1863, Simon Buckner, the last of a string of Confederate commanders based in Knoxville, evacuated the city. On September 1, the vanguard of Union general Ambrose Burnside entered the city to great fanfare (the unit briefly chased future mayor Peter Staub through the streets). Oliver Perry Temple joyously ran behind the soldiers the length of Gay Street, and pro-Union Mayor James C. Luttrell raised a large American flag he had saved for the occasion. Burnside set up his headquarters at John Hervey Crozier's house at the corner of Gay and Union.D 31, 636. Thomas William Humes was reinstalled as rector of St. John's Episcopal,Digby Gordon Seymour, Divided Loyalties: Fort Sanders and the Civil War in East Tennessee (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 1963). and Brownlow returned to the city and once again began publication of the Whig. The Battle of Fort Sanders, as depicted by Kurz and Allison Anticipating the Confederates would soon attempt to retake the city, Burnside and his chief engineer, Orlando Poe, set about fortifying the city with a string of earthworks, bastions, and trenches. In November 1863, Confederate general James Longstreet moved north from Chattanooga in hopes of forcing Burnside out of Knoxville. Burnside's forces managed to delay Longstreet at the Battle of Campbell's Station on November 16, but was forced to retreat back to Knoxville with Longstreet in pursuit. General Sanders was mortally wounded on November 18 executing a critical delaying action along Kingston Pike. Fort Loudon, one of the city's earthen bastions, was renamed \\"Fort Sanders\\" in his honor. Longstreet's forces laid siege to Knoxville for two weeks, though the Union Army managed to resupply Burnside via the river. On the morning of November 29, 1863, Longstreet ordered his forces to attack Fort Sanders. During the Battle of Fort Sanders, the Confederate attackers struggled to overcome Union trenches and the barrage of Union gunfire, and were forced to withdraw after just 20 minutes. On December 2, Longstreet lifted the siege and withdrew to Virginia, leaving the city in Union hands until the end of the war. =Aftermath= In April 1864, the East Tennessee Union Convention reconvened in Knoxville, and while its delegates were badly divided, several, including Brownlow and Maynard, supported a resolution recognizing the Emancipation Proclamation. Confederate businessman Joseph Mabry and future business leaders such as Charles McClung McGhee and Peter Kern began working with Union leaders to rebuild the city.Jerome Taylor, \\"The Extraordinary Life and Death of Joseph A. Mabry,\\" East Tennessee Historical Society Publications, No. 44 (1972), pp. 41-70. Brownlow remained vengeful, however, seizing the property of Confederate leaders J.G.M. Ramsey, William Sneed (including the Lamar House Hotel), and William Swan, and expelling known Confederate sympathizers from the city. Acts of Civil War-related violence occurred in Knoxville for years after the war. On September 4, 1865, Confederate soldier Abner Baker was lynched in Knoxville after killing a Union soldier who had killed his father. On July 10, 1868, Union major E.C. Camp shot and killed Confederate colonel Henry Ashby on Main Street in front of the courthouse over a Civil War grievance.Fred Brown, \\"Two Knox Combatants Carried Civil War Grudges Back Home,\\" Knoxville News-Sentinel, 31 July 1994. On June 13, 1870, Joseph Mabry shot pro-Union attorney John Baxter in front of the Lamar House, capping a feud that had been building since the war. The following year, David Nelson, the son of pro-Union congressman T.A.R. Nelson, shot and killed Confederate general James Holt Clanton on Gay Street in front of the Lamar House.Thomas Alexander, Thomas A. R. Nelson of East Tennessee (Nashville: Tennessee Historical Commission, 1956), pp. 152-166. Knoxville and the rise of the New South (1866-1920) =Economic Growth= View across the first Gay Street Bridge in the late 1860s; the bridge shown was eventually destroyed by a flood According to historian William MacArthur, Knoxville \\"grew from a town to a city between 1870 and 1900.\\" A number of newcomers from the North, with the help of prewar local business elites, quickly established the city's first heavy industries. Hiram Chamberlain and the Welsh-born Richards brothers established the Knoxville Iron Company in 1868, and erected a large mill in the Second Creek Valley.John Wooldridge, George Mellen, William Rule (ed.), Standard History of Knoxville, Tennessee (Chicago: Lewis Publishing Company, 1900; reprinted by Kessinger Books, 2010). The following year, Charles McClung McGhee and several investors purchased the city's two major railroads and merged them into the East Tennessee, Virginia and Georgia Railway, which would eventually control over of tracks in five states.Edwin Patton, Lucile Deaderick (ed.), \\"Transportation Development,\\" Heart of the Valley: A History of Knoxville, Tennessee (Knoxville, Tenn.: East Tennessee Historical Society, 1976). The city's textile industry took shape with the establishment of the Knoxville Woolen Mills and Brookside Mills in 1884 and 1885, respectively. Mead's Quarry in South Knoxville, photographed circa 1890 As one of the largest cities in the Southern Appalachian region, Knoxville had long been a nexus between the surrounding rural mountain hinterland and the major industrial centers of the North, and thus had long been home to a thriving wholesaling (or \\"jobbing\\") market. Rural merchants from across East Tennessee purchased goods for their general stores from Knoxville wholesalers. With the arrival of the railroad, the city's wholesaling sector expanded rapidly, with over a dozen firms in operation by 1860, and 50 by 1896. In 1866, Knoxville-based wholesaler Cowan, McClung and Company was the most profitable company in the state.C. P. White, Mary Rothrock (ed.), \\"Commercial and Industrial Trends since 1865,\\" The French Broad-Holston Country (Knoxville, Tenn.: East Tennessee Historical Society, 1972), p. 222. By the late-1890s, Knoxville had the third-largest wholesaling market in the South.William Bruce Wheeler, Knoxville, Tennessee: A Mountain City in the New South (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2005). The railroad also led to a boom in the quarrying and production of Tennessee marble, a type of crystalline limestone found in abundance in the ridges surrounding Knoxville. By the early 1890s, twenty-two quarries and three finishing mills were in operation in Knox County alone, and the industry as a whole was generating over a million dollars in annual profits. Tennessee marble was used in monumental construction projects across the nation, earning Knoxville the nickname, \\"The Marble City,\\" during the late 19th century.Ask Doc Knox, \\"What's With All This Marble City Business?\\" Metro Pulse, 10 May 2010. Retrieved: 10 August 2011. The Flag of Knoxville, Tennessee incorporates the color white to symbolize marble and displays a derrick used in marble mining.Ordinance No. 958, October 16, 1896, Knoxville Minute Book, Book L, pp. 370-371. =Demographic Changes= Army cadets at Knoxville College, circa 1903 Knoxville's pre-1850s population consisted primarily of European-American (of mostly English, Scots-Irish, or German descent) Protestants and a small community of free blacks and slaves.Mark Banker, Appalachians All: East Tennessee and the Elusive History of an American Region (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2010). Railroad construction in the 1850s brought to the city large numbers of Irish Catholic immigrants, who helped establish the city's first Catholic congregation in 1855. The Swiss were another important group in 19th-century Knoxville, with businessmen James G. Sterchi and Peter Staub, Supreme Court justice Edward Terry Sanford, philosopher Albert Chavannes, and builder David Getaz, all claiming descent from the city's Swiss immigrants.Ann Bennett, \\"Historic and Architectural Resources in Knoxville and Knox County, Tennessee,\\" National Register of Historic Places Multiple Property Listing Registration Form, May 1994, Section E. Welsh immigrants brought mining and metallurgical expertise to the city in the late 1860s and 1870s. After the Civil War, African Americans, both freed slaves and blacks that had been free prior to the war, played an increasing role in the city's political and economic affairs. Racetrack and saloon owner Cal Johnson, born a slave, was one of the wealthiest African Americans in the state by the time of his death.Becky French Brewer and Douglas Stuart McDaniel, Park City (Arcadia Publishing, 2005), p. 38.

Notable members of Knoxville's Jewish community included jeweler Max Friedman and department store owner Max Arnstein. One of Knoxville's largest migrant groups consisted of rural people who moved to the city from the surrounding rural counties, often seeking wage-paying jobs in mills. Many of Knoxville's political and business leaders throughout the 20th century hailed from rural areas of Southern Appalachia.Knoxville leaders born in rural Southern Appalachian counties include Cas Walker, John Duncan, Randy Tyree, Jake Butcher, and Chris Whittle. =Knoxville in the Gilded Age= Swiss immigrant Peter Staub built Knoxville's first opera house, Staub's Theatre, on Gay Street in 1872. This was also one of the first major structures designed by architect Joseph Baumann, who would design many of the city's more prominent late-19th-century buildings.Lucile Deaderick, Heart of the Valley: A History of Knoxville, Tennessee (Knoxville, Tenn.: East Tennessee Historical Society, 1976), p. 494. During this same period, the Lamar House Hotel, located across the street from the theater, was a popular gathering place for the city's elite. The hotel hosted lavish masquerade balls, and served oysters, cigars, and imported wines.Jack Neely, Knoxville's Secret History (Scruffy Books, 1995). Initially a place for farmers to sell produce, Market Square had evolved into one of the city's commercial and cultural centers by the 1870s. The square's most notable business was Peter Kern's ice cream saloon and confections factory, which hosted numerous festivals for various groups in the late 19th century. The square also attracted street preachers, early country musicians, and political activists. Women's suffragist Lizzie Crozier French was delivering speeches on Market Square as early as the 1880s. After the Civil War, Thomas William Humes was named president of East Tennessee University (renamed the University of Tennessee in 1879), and managed to acquire for the institution the state's Morrill Act land-grant funds, allowing the school to expand.Milton Klein, University of Tennessee, Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2009.

In 1883, Knoxville annexed Mechanicsville, which had developed just northwest of the city as a village for Knoxville Iron Company and other factory workers. In the 1870s and 1880s, the development of Knoxville's streetcar system (electrified by William Gibbs McAdoo in 1890) led to the rapid development of suburbs on the city's periphery. Neighborhoods such as Fort Sanders, Fourth and Gill, Old North Knoxville, and Parkridge, are all rooted in \\"streetcar suburbs\\" developed during this period. In 1888, the area now consisting of Fort Sanders and the U.T. campus were incorporated as the City of West Knoxville, and in 1889 the area now consisting of Old North Knoxville and Fourth and Gill incorporated as the City of North Knoxville. Knoxville annexed both in 1897. In 1907, Parkridge, Chilhowee Park, and adjacent neighborhoods incorporated as Park City. Lonsdale, a factory village northwest of the city, and Mountain View, located south of Park City, incorporated that same year. Oakwood, which developed alongside the Southern Railway's Coster rail yard, was incorporated in 1913. In 1917, Knoxville annexed these four cities, along with the burgeoning suburb of Sequoyah Hills and parts of South Knoxville, effectively more than doubling the city's population, and increasing its land area from . As Knoxville grew, the city's boosters continuously touted the city as an industrial boom town in an attempt to lure major companies. In 1910 and 1911, two major national fairs, the Appalachian Expositions, were held at Chilhowee Park.Robert Lukens, Appalachian Exposition of 1910, Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2009. Retrieved: 10 August 2011. A third, the National Conservation Exposition, was held in 1913. The fairs demonstrated the economic trend known as the \\"New South,\\" the transition of the South from an agricultural-based economy to an industrial one. The fairs also advocated the responsible usage of the region's natural resources. =Urban Issues= Gay Street, photographed by the Detroit Publishing Company in the early 1900s Knoxville's rapid growth in the late 19th century led to increased pollution, mainly from the increasing use of coal, and a rise in the crime rate, exacerbated by the influx of large numbers of people with very low-paying jobs. The city, which had suffered serious cholera outbreaks in 1849, 1854, 1866, and 1873, and smallpox epidemics in 1850, 1855, 1862, 1863, 1864, and 1866, created a health department in 1879, and established a city hospital in 1883. Activists such as Lizzie Crozier French and businessmen such as E.C. Camp established organizations that helped the poor. Child workers at Knoxville's Brookside Mills, photographed by Lewis Hine in 1910 By the 1880s, Knoxville had a murder rate that was higher than Los Angeles's murder rate in the 1990s. Journalist Jack Neely points out that \\"saloons, whorehouses, cocaine parlors, gambling dens, and poolrooms\\" lined Central Street from the railroad tracks to the river.Jack Neely, \\"Detour de Knoxville,\\" Metro Pulse, 28 May 2008.

Retrieved: 10 August 2011. The Kid Curry shooting helped fuel calls for citywide prohibition, which was enacted in 1907. After World War I, the United States suffered a major economic recession, and Knoxville, like many other cities, experienced an influx of migrants moving to the city in search of work. Racial tensions heightened as poor whites and blacks competed for the few available jobs, and both the Ku Klux Klan and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) opened chapters in the city.Matthew Lakin, \\"'A Dark Night': The Knoxville Race Riot of 1919,\\" Journal of East Tennessee History, 72 (2000), pp. 1-29. On August 30, 1919, these tensions erupted in the so-called Riot of 1919, the city's worst race riot, which shattered the city's vision of itself as a racially tolerant Southern town. Transition to a modern city (1920-1960) =Louis Brownlow= The Holston and Burwell buildings dominated Knoxville's skyline in 1919 In 1912, Knoxvillians replaced their mayor-alderman form of government with a commissioner form of government that consisted of five commissioners elected at-large, and a mayor chosen from among the five. Following the 1917 annexations, the city began to struggle as it extended services to the newly annexed areas, and it became clear the new government was ineffective at dealing with the city's financial issues. In 1923, the city voted to replace the commissioners with a city manager-council form of government, which involved the election of a city council, who would then hire a city manager to oversee the city's business affairs. The first city manager hired by Knoxville was Louis Brownlow, the successful city manager of Petersburg, Virginia, and a cousin of Parson Brownlow. When Brownlow arrived in Knoxville, he was horrified by the city's condition, later writing that he found \\"something new and more disturbing\\" every day.Louis Brownlow, A Passion for Anonymity (University of Chicago Press, 1958). There were no paved roads connecting Knoxville with other major cities. The lone operable tank of the city's waterworks was full of cracks that Knoxvillians had been lazily plugging with gunny sacks. The city hospital was unable to buy drugs, as it was deeply in debt, and its credit had been cut off. City Hall, then located on Market Square, was filthy, noisy and disorganized. Map of Knoxville in 1919 Brownlow immediately got to work, negotiating a more favorable bond rate and ordering greater scrutiny of all purchases. He also convinced the city to purchase the vacated Tennessee School for the Deaf building for use as a city hall. While Brownlow had some initial success, his initiatives met staunch opposition from South Knoxville councilman Lee Monday, who according to Brownlow, was \\"representative of that top-of-the-voice screamology of East Tennessee mountain politics.\\" Opposition to Brownlow gradually intensified, especially after he called for a tax increase, and following the election of a less- friendly city council in 1926, Brownlow resigned. =Economic struggles= While Knoxville experienced tremendous growth in the late 19th century, by the early 1900s, the city's economy was beginning to show signs of stagnation. The natural resources of the surrounding region were either exhausted or their demand fell sharply, and the decline of railroads in favor of other forms of shipping led to the collapse of the city's wholesaling sector. Population growth also declined, though this trend was masked by the 1917 annexations. Historian Bruce Wheeler suggests that the city's overly provincial economic \\"elite,\\" which had long demonstrated a disdain for change, and the masses of new rural (\\"Appalachian\\") and African-American migrants, both of whom were suspicious of government, formed an odd alliance that consistently rejected major attempts at reform. As Knoxvillians were adamantly opposed to tax increases, the city consistently had to rely on bond issues to pay for city services. An increasingly greater portion of existing revenues was required to pay interest on these bonds, leaving little money for civic improvements. Urban neighborhoods fell into ruin and the downtown area deteriorated. Those who could afford it fled to new suburbs on the city's periphery, such as Sequoyah Hills, Lindbergh Forest, or North Hills. During the Great Depression, Knoxville's six largest banks either failed or were forced into mergers. Construction fell 70%, and unemployment tripled. African Americans were hit hardest, as business owners began hiring whites for jobs traditionally held by black workers, such as bakers, telephone workers, and road pavers. The city was forced pay its employees in scrip, and begged creditors to allow it to refinance its debt. =Federal programs and infrastructure growth= Tennessee Coach Company baggage agent in Knoxville, photographed by Esther Bubley in 1943 In the 1930s and early 1940s, several major federal programs provided some relief to Knoxvillians suffering amidst the Depression. The Great Smoky Mountains National Park, which wealthy Knoxvillians had led the drive to create, opened in 1932. In 1933, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) was established with its headquarters in Knoxville, its initial purpose being to control flooding and improve navigation in the Tennessee River watershed, and provide electricity to the area. During World War II, the construction of Manhattan Project facilities in nearby Oak Ridge brought thousands of federal workers to the area, and helped boost Knoxville's economy. First Creek floodwaters at 6th and Washington, photographed in 1938. Dam construction by TVA in the 1930s and 1940s helped alleviate flooding in the Tennessee Valley. Kingston Pike saw a boom in tourism in the 1930s and 1940s as it lay along a merged stretch of two cross-country tourism routes, the Dixie Highway and the Lee Highway.Jack Neely, From the Shadow Side: And Other Stories of Knoxville, Tennessee (Oak Ridge, Tenn.: Tellico Books, 2003), p. 125. During the same period, traffic to the Smokies led to development along Chapman Highway (named for the park's chief promoter, David Chapman) in South Knoxville. In the late 1920s, General Lawrence Tyson donated land off Kingston Pike for McGhee Tyson Airport, named for his son, World War I aviator Charles McGhee Tyson (the airport has since moved to Blount County). In 1947, Knoxville replaced its streetcar system with buses. TVA's completion of Fort Loudoun Dam in 1943 brought modifications to Knoxville's riverfront. In 1946, travel writer John Gunther visited Knoxville, and dubbed the city, the \\"ugliest city\\" in America. He also mocked its puritanical laws regarding liquor sales and the showing of movies on Sunday, and noted the city's relatively high crime rate. While Knoxvillians vigorously defended their city, Gunther's comments nevertheless sparked discussions regarding the city's unsightliness and its blue laws. The ordinance forbidding the showing of movies on Sunday was done away with in 1946, with the help of the state legislature. Knoxville legalized packaged liquor in 1961, though the issue remained a contentious one for years. =Political factionalism and metropolitan government= The decades following the tumultuous term of Louis Brownlow saw continuous fighting in Knoxville's city council over virtually every major issue. In 1941, Cas Walker, the owner of a grocery store chain and host of a popular local radio (and later television) program, was elected to the city council. A successor of sorts to Monday, Walker vehemently opposed every progressive measure introduced in the city council during his 30-year tenure, including fluoridation of the city's water supply, adoption of daylight saving time, library construction, parking meters, and metropolitan government. He also adamantly opposed any attempt to increase taxes. Walker's brash and uncompromising style made him a folk hero to many, especially the city's working class and poor. Knoxville's economy continued to struggle following World War II. The city's textile industry collapsed in the mid-1950s with the closure of Appalachian Mills, Cherokee Mills, Venus Hosiery, and Brookside Mills, leaving thousands unemployed. Major companies refused to build new factories in Knoxville due to a lack of suitable industrial sites. Between 1956 and 1961, 35 companies inquired into establishing major operations in Knoxville, but all 35 chose cities with better-developed industrial parks. In 1961, Mayor John Duncan called for a bond issue to develop a new industrial site, but voters rejected the measure. As early as the 1930s, leaders in Knoxville and Knox County had pondered forming a metropolitan government. In the late 1950s, the issue gained momentum, with the support of many city and county officials, and the city's two major newspapers, the News-Sentinel and the Journal. Cas Walker, however, blasted the idea of a metropolitan government as a communist plot, and his old political rival, George Dempster, also rejected the idea. When the measure was presented to voters in 1959, it was soundly defeated, with just 21% of Knoxvillians and 13.8% of Knox Countians supporting it. Revitalization (1960-present) =Knoxville in the 1960s= In 1960, several Knoxville College students, led by Robert Booker and Avon Rollins, engaged in a series of sit-ins to protest segregation at lunch counters in Downtown Knoxville. This action prompted downtown department stores to desegregate, and by the end of the decade, most other downtown businesses had followed suit. City schools also gradually desegregated during this period, largely in response to a lawsuit brought by Josephine Goss in 1959. Between 1945 and 1975, the University of Tennessee's student body grew from just under 3,000 to nearly 30,000. The school's campus expanded to cover the entire area between Cumberland Avenue and the river west of Second Creek, and the Fort Sanders neighborhood was largely converted into student housing. By the mid-1970s, U.T. employed over 4,000 faculty and staff, providing a boost to the city's economy. The growing popularity of the school's sports teams led to the expansion of Neyland Stadium, one of the largest non-racing stadiums in the nation, and the eventual construction of Thompson‚ÄìBoling Arena, one of the largest basketball venues in the nation at the time of its completion. While unemployment declined to just 2.8% in the 1960s, many of the jobs paid low wages, stunting the growth of the city's service sector. Large parts of the downtown area continued to deteriorate, and nearly half of all houses in the city's older neighborhoods were considered substandard and in a critical state of decline. A nationwide survey ranked the Mountain View area of East Knoxville 20,875 out of 20,915 urban neighborhoods in terms of housing stock, and President Lyndon Johnson referred to the residents of Mountain View as \\"people as poverty-ridden as I have seen in any part of the United States.\\" =Downtown revitalization efforts= The Market House on Market Square, constructed in 1897 and demolished in 1960 Beginning in the 1950s, Knoxville made serious efforts to reinvigorate the downtown area. One of the city's first major renovation efforts involved the replacement of the large Market House on Market Square with a pedestrian mall. The city also made numerous attempts to lure shoppers back to Gay Street, starting with the Downtown Promenade in 1960, in which walkways were constructed behind buildings along the street's eastern half, and continuing with the so-called \\"Gay Way,\\" which included the widening of sidewalks and the installation of storefront canopies, in 1964. Downtown retailers continued to slip, however, and with the completion of West Town Mall in 1972, the downtown retail market collapsed. Miller's, Kress's, and the three surviving downtown theaters had all closed by 1978. In 1962, Knoxville annexed several large communities, namely Fountain City and Inskip north of the city, and Bearden and West Hills west of the city. This brought large numbers of progressive voters into the city, diluting the influence of Cas Walker and his allies. In the early 1970s, Mayor Kyle Testerman, backed by a more open city council, implemented the \\"1990 Plan,\\" which essentially abandoned attempts to lure large retailers back to the downtown area, aiming instead to create a financial district accompanied by neighborhoods containing a mixture of residences, office space, and specialty shops. In 1978, Knoxville and Knox County voters again voted on the issue of metropolitan government. In spite of support by U.T. president Edward Boling, Mayor Randy Tyree (Testerman's successor), Pilot president Jim Haslam, Knoxville Superintendent of Schools Mildred Doyle, and Knox County judge Howard Bozeman, the initiative again failed. While a majority of Knoxvillians had voted in favor of consolidated government, a majority of Knox Countians had voted against it. =1982 World's Fair= In 1974, Downtown Knoxville Association president Stewart Evans, following a discussion with King Cole, president of the 1974 Spokane Exposition, raised the possibility of a similar international exposition for Knoxville. Testerman and Tyree both embraced the fair, though the city council and Knoxvillians in general were initially lukewarm to the idea. One key supporter of the fair was rogue banker Jake Butcher, who in 1975 seized control of Knoxville's largest bank, Hamilton National, and shook up the city's conservative banking community. Following his failed gubernatorial campaign in 1978, Butcher turned his attention to the fair initiative, and helped the city raise critical funding. To prepare for the World's Fair, the merged stretch of I-40 and I-75 in West Knoxville was widened, and I-640 was constructed. The old L&N; yard along Second Creek, home to a rough neighborhood known as \\"Scuffletown,\\" was chosen for the fair site, largely for its redevelopment potential. Three hotel chains-- Radisson, Hilton, and Holiday Inn-- built large hotels in the downtown area in anticipation of the influx of fair visitors. The fair, officially named the International Energy Exposition, was open from May 1 to October 31, 1982, and drew over 11 million visitors. Its success defied the expectations of the Wall Street Journal, which had derided Knoxville as a \\"scruffy little town,\\" and had predicted the fair would fail. While the fair was profitable, it nevertheless left Knoxville in debt, and failed to spark the redevelopment boom Testerman, Tyree, and the fair's promoters had envisioned. Furthermore, on the day after the fair closed, the FDIC raided all of Butcher's banks, leading to the collapse of his banking empire, and threatening the city's financial stability. Testerman replaced an embattled Tyree as mayor in 1983, and attempted to reinvigorate interest in his downtown redevelopment plans. =1980s, 1990s and 2000s= Sullivan's Saloon, photographed by Jack Boucher in 1976, following years of deterioration; this building was one of first to be renovated by developer Kristopher Kendrick The second Testerman administration stabilized the city's finances, initiated urban renewal projects in Mechanicsville and East Knoxville, and consolidated Knoxville City and Knox County schools. With the help of rising entrepreneur Chris Whittle, Testerman came up with an updated downtown redevelopment plan, the \\"1987 Downtown Plan.\\" This new plan called for further renovations to Market Square and the beautification of Gay Street. Victor Ashe, Testerman's successor, continued redevelopment efforts, focusing mainly on parks and blighted areas of East and North Knoxville. As the city's westward expansion along Kingston Pike had been thwarted by the incorporation of Farragut as a town in 1980, Ashe, rather than focus on large-scale annexations, turned instead to \\"finger\\" annexations, which involved annexing small parcels of land at a time. Ashe would make hundreds of such annexations during his 16-year tenure, effectively expanding the city by over 25 square miles. Preservation efforts in Knoxville, which have preserved historic structures such as Blount Mansion, the Bijou Theatre, and the Tennessee Theatre, have intensified in recent years, prompting the designation of numerous historic overlay districts throughout the city.Knoxville-Knox County Metropolitan Planning Commission, Preservation Works: Mayor's Task Force on Historic Preservation , 18 August 2000. Retrieved: 18 August 2011. The efforts of developers such as Kristopher Kendrick and David Dewhirst, who have purchased and restored numerous dilapidated buildings, gradually helped lure residents back to the Downtown area.Ronda Robinson, \\"Revered Developer Kendrick Dies,\\" 4 May 2009.

In the 2000s, Knoxville's planners turned their focus to the development of mixed residential and commercial neighborhoods (such as the Old City), cohesive, multipurpose shopping centers (such as Turkey Creek in West Knoxville), and a Downtown area with a mixture of unique retailers, restaurants, and cultural and entertainment venues, all with considerable success.H. Blount Hunter, Downtown Knoxville Redevelopment Strategy, May 2007, pp. 3-6, 10-12. In 2020, March 23, Knoxville businesses were shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Historiography of Knoxville The East Tennessee Historical Society's annual journal, published since 1929, contains numerous articles on Knoxville and Knoxville-area topics. The Society has also published two comprehensive histories of Knoxville and Knox County, The French Broad-Holston Country (1946), edited by Mary Utopia Rothrock, and Heart of the Valley (1976), edited by Lucile Deaderick. In 1982, the Society published a follow-up to Heart of the Valley, William MacArthur's Knoxville: Crossroads of the New South, which includes hundreds of historic photographs. Other comprehensive histories of the city include William Rule's Standard History of Knoxville (1900) and Ed Hooper's Knoxville (2003), the latter being part of Arcadia's \\"Images of America\\" series. The Civil War is one of the most extensively covered periods of Knoxville's history. Two early first-hand accounts of the war in Knoxville are William G. Brownlow's Sketches of the Rise, Progress and Decline of Secession (1862) and the diary of Ellen Renshaw House, edited by Daniel Sutherland and published as A Very Violent Rebel: The Civil War Diary of Ellen Renshaw House (1996). First-hand accounts written after the war include William Rule's The Loyalists of Tennessee in the Late War (1887), Thomas Williams Humes's The Loyal Mountaineers of Tennessee (1888), Oliver Perry Temple's East Tennessee and the Civil War (1899), and Albert Chavannes's East Tennessee Sketches (1900). Modern works include Digby Gordon Seymour's Divided Loyalties: Fort Sanders and the Civil War (1963) and Robert McKenzie's Lincolnites and Rebels (2006). Knoxville's history from the end of the Civil War to the modern period is covered in Knoxville, Tennessee: Continuity and Change in an Appalachian City (1983), written by Michael McDonald and Bruce Wheeler, and subsequently expanded by Wheeler as Knoxville, Tennessee: A Mountain City in the New South (2005). Mark Banker's Appalachians All (2010) discusses the development of three East Tennessee communities, Knoxville, Cades Cove, and the Clearfork Valley (in Campbell and Claiborne counties). The history of Knoxville's African American community is covered in Robert Booker's Two Hundred Years of Black Culture in Knoxville, Tennessee: 1791 to 1991 (1994). Booker's The Heat of a Red Summer: Race Mixing, Race Rioting in 1919 Knoxville (2001) details the Riot of 1919. Merrill Proudfoot's Diary of a Sit-In (1962) provides an account of the 1960 Knoxville sit-ins. A significant portion of Charles Cansler's Three Generations: The Story of a Colored Family in Eastern Tennessee (1939) takes place in Knoxville. Native Knoxvillian James Herman Robinson describes his childhood in Knoxville in his autobiography, Road Without Turning (1950). Since the early 1990s, Metro Pulse editor Jack Neely has written numerous articles (often for his column, \\"The Secret History\\") that recall some of the more colorful, odd, obscure, and forgotten aspects of the city's history. Neely's articles have been compiled into several books, including, The Secret History of Knoxville (1995), From the Shadow Side (2003), and Knoxville: This Obscure Prismatic City (2009). Arcadia has published several short books on local topics as part of its \\"Images of America\\" series, including Ed Hooper's WIVK (2008) and WNOX (2009), and 1982 World's Fair (2009) by Martha Rose Woodward. Other books on Knoxville topics include Wendy Lowe Besmann's Separate Circle: Jewish Life in Knoxville, Tennessee, which details the development of the city's Jewish community, and Sylvia Lynch's Harvey Logan in Knoxville (1998), which covers Kid Curry's time in the city. The Junior League of Knoxville's Knoxville: 50 Landmarks (1976), provides descriptions of various historical buildings in the city. A more detailed overview of the city's architectural development is provided in \\"Historic and Architectural Resources of Knox County\\" (1994), a pamphlet written by Metropolitan Planning Commission preservationist Ann Bennett for the National Register of Historic Places. The National Register includes over 100 buildings and districts in Knoxville and Knox County, with extensive descriptions of the buildings provided in their respective nomination forms, which are being digitized for the Register's online database.

She is said to have been the first abstract artist in Lebanon, though she sold nothing there until 1962. Life and career Born in 1916 in Ain el Mreisa, Beirut, Lebanon, Choucair came from a family of doctors, lawyers, engineers and historians. Her father, Salim Rawda (1872-1917) was an expatriate in Australia trading herbs and writing manuscripts on their medicinal values. When he returned to Lebanon in 1910, he met and married Choucair's mother, Zalfa Amin Najjar (1891-1995), a Brummana High School student who was fond of reciting poetry. They had three children: Anis Rawda (1911-1988) was a businessman and a member of the Beirut municipality; Anissa Rawda Najjar (1913-2016) was a social activist, who was married to the late Fouad Najjar; and the youngest, Choucair, became one of the most prominent figures of Lebanese modernism. When Choucair's father was in Damascus as a conscript in the Ottoman army, he contracted typhoid and died in 1917. Widowed early on, Choucair's mother had to raise three children on her own and under difficult circumstances. Choucair found inspiration within her mother; aside from being well-educated, a skilled orator and a poet, Najjar had also belonged to various women's associations and was awarded a medallion from Brummana High School upon turning 100. Art was a part of Choucair's life from the very beginning, and she believed that, for her, \\"art is innate.\\" She produced numerous hand-crafted objects at a very young age. When she was enrolled into the Ahlia School in 1924, she designed a multitude of school posters and was known for producing caricatures of her teachers, some of which were published in the school's newspaper. She claimed to have been far more advanced than her actual art teachers and would roam the classroom to assist those who needed help with their art. In an interview with Nelda LaTeef, Choucair recounted her mischievous behavior in the classroom stating: \\"For my sociability, I spent most of my time out in the corridor!\\" After high school, Choucair attended the American Junior College for Women (currently the Lebanese American University) in 1934 and graduated with a degree in natural sciences in 1936. In 1942, Choucair took art lessons with Omar Onsi for three months, and that was ultimately the only formal art training she had received by that point in time, having learned most of everything else on her own. Choucair's travels were also what ultimately ended up influencing her artistic production. In 1943, during World War II, the artist went to Egypt looking to find some art, but all the museums were closed as a result of the turbulent climate of the time. So, Choucair instead decided to walk around the streets of Cairo and visit the mosques she encountered, and the experience inevitably had an impact on her. \\"It was thrilling! I thought this is real art! It endures,\\" she had exclaimed in her interview with LaTeef. In a world with a fast-growing technological industry, Choucair sought refuge in Islamic Art and found it to be a timeless form of art through which she could simultaneously develop her love of art and architecture. \\"It is my second love,\\" she said to LaTeef of architecture, \\"I started out as a painter and then moved to sculpture.\\" The combination of architectural and Islamic elements became central to Choucair's artistic production, and Chris Dercon, former director of Tate Modern, emphasizes the fact that the artist chose to call into question the one-sided, Western view people often have when looking at Islamic Art. Instead, she explores principles of Islamic design and Arabic poetry within a modernist, non-objective artistic lens. Her sculptures are precise and geometric, and she tells LaTeef that her geometry is based on the proportions of the circle: \\"The essence of Arab art is the point ‚Äì from the point everything derives.\\" After her seven-month stay in Cairo, Choucair returns to Lebanon and begins working at the American University of Beirut's (AUB) library in 1945 while simultaneously enrolling in some philosophy and history courses. It is there that she meets Moustapha Farroukh, president of AUB's Art Club at that time, in 1946 and audits his art class every week. Farroukh also decided to publish one of Choucair's drawings in the club's only issue of Art Gazette. In 1947, Choucair exhibits some of her geometrical gouache drawings at the Arab Cultural Gallery in 1947, and the exhibition is considered to have been the Arab World's first abstract painting exhibition. After that, Choucair decides to leave Lebanon again in 1948 to head to Paris with her brother-in-law, Fouad, who had to travel there for business. Initially, she did not know much about the global art scene beyond Post- impressionism, which is why she wanted to go to Paris and expose herself to everything that she had found in the news over the years. It is there that she encountered abstract art for the first time, having roamed the Parisian streets in search of art galleries and museums to visit while Fouad attended to his business affairs during the day. When it was time for them to head back to Lebanon, she decided to remain in Paris and enrolled herself into the √âcole Nationale des Beaux Arts. During her three-and-a-half-year stay in Paris, Choucair observed and contributed to the thriving art scene of the region, joining Fernand L√©ger's studio in 1949. However, she ended up leaving his studio three months later upon realizing that its concepts and methods did not coincide with her goals in artistic production. In 1950, she was one of the first Arab artists to participate in the Salon des R√©alit√©s Nouvelles in Paris. Before returning to Lebanon, she had her first exhibition in Paris in 1951 at the Colette Allendy gallery, and the solo show included works she had originally displayed in Beirut, in addition to paintings she produced during her time in Paris. The exhibition was far more successful than the one in Beirut, and critics from the Art and Art d'Aujourd'hui magazines enthusiastically reviewed her work. The Art d'Aujourd'hui critic made special mention of Choucair's work, comparing her bold forms to those of a \\"stonecutter\\" and writing that \\"the walls of Galerie Allendy are about to burst with the force of the paintings hanging there this week.\\" In 1959 she began to concentrate on sculpture, which became her main preoccupation in 1962. In 1963, she was awarded the National Council of Tourism Prize for the execution of a stone sculpture for a public site in Beirut. In 1974, the Lebanese Artists Association sponsored an honorary retrospective exhibition of her work at the National Council of Tourism in Beirut. In 1985, she won an appreciation prize from the General Union of Arab Painters. In 1988, she was awarded a medal by the Lebanese government. A retrospective exhibition organized by Saleh Barakat was presented at the Beirut Exhibition Center in 2011. In 2013 the Tate Modern held the first international retrospective of Choucair's work. Choucair's work has been considered as one of the best examples of the spirit of abstraction characteristic of Arabic visual art, completely disconnected from the observation of nature and inspired by Arabic geometric art. Choucair received a prestigious honorary doctorate from the American University of Beirut (May 2014). Her artwork \\"Poem\\" is on loan to Louvre Abu Dhabi. Choucair turned 100 in June 2016. In 1953, she had married journalist Youssef Choucair, and they conceived one daughter together, Hala, who also became an artist. Her older sister, women's rights leader Anissa Rawda Najjar, lived for almost 103 years,\\"Pioneer Women Right Defender Anissa Najjar Dies at Age of 103\\" Women Economic Empowerment Portal (January 15, 2016). but her daughter had been killed during the war. Choucair died on January 26, 2017 in Beirut. Tribute On June 24, 2018, a Google Doodle commemorated Saloua Raouda Choucair's 102nd birthday.

Caesarea Dental Clinic, Saint Helier A member of the Caesarean Cycling Club in Jersey wearing the word Caesarean on his kit The Channel Islands are mentioned in the Antonine Itinerary as the following: Sarnia, Caesarea, Barsa, Silia and Andium, but Jersey cannot be identified specifically because none corresponds directly to the present names.Dominique Fournier, Wikimanche. Furthermore, later records evoke Angia (also spelled Agna ). Andium is a Latinized version of the Gaulish (Celtic) *Andion, with and- the Gaulish intensive prefix meaning \\"very\\", \\"much\\", \\"big\\". Andium roughly translates as \\"big Island\\", Jersey being the largest of the Channel Islands. The spelling Angia could be an ultimate development of *Andia. Some others identify it as Caesarea, a late recorded Roman name influenced by the Old English suffix -ey for \\"island\\"; this is plausible if, in the regional pronunciation of Latin, Caesarea was not but . Another theory is that the variation of the \\"J\\" sound today could be connected with phonetical cousins \\"g\\" and \\"k\\" (International Phonetic Alphabet) through variable pronunciations based on similar spelling. Theoretically, if Caesarea was originally pronounced with a \\"k\\", that may have naturally developed into a \\"g\\" sound for locals (or foreigners), making Gersei, Gersoi, or the other spellings relatable. Because \\"g\\" is pronounced as both a hard glutteral \\"g\\" as in \\"go\\" and a soft \\"j\\" as in \\"gym\\" or \\"gem\\", the spelling of Jersey could be a result of the variance in its pronunciation. The name Caesarea has been used as the Latin name for Jersey (also in its French version C√©sar√©e) since William Camden's Britannia (published in 1586), and is used in titles of associations and institutions today. The Latin name Caesarea was also applied to the colony of New Jersey as Nova Caesarea. Gazette de C√©sar√©e, Jersey newspaper, 1812 Angia could be a misspelling for *Augia, that is the Latinized form of Germanic *auj≈ç (> Old English ƒ´(e)ƒ° > is-land),T. F Hoad, English Etymology, Oxford University Press paperback 1993. that could have extended before the Viking Age along the coast of France, as for √Æle d'Yeu (Augia, Insula Oya) or Oye-Plage (Ogia 7th century) and constitutes the suffix -ey in Jersey, Guernsey (Greneroi), Alderney (Alneroi) and Chausey (Calsoi).Fran√ßois de Beaurepaire, Les noms des communes et anciennes paroisses de la Manche, √©ditions Picard 1986. p. 100. Chausey can be compared with Cholsey (GB, Berkshire, ƒäeolesiƒ° 891), interpreted by Eilert EkwallThe Concise Oxford Dictionary Of English Placenames, Oxford 1947. as \\"ƒäeola 's island\\". The ending -ey denotes an island. These -ey names could have been reinforced by the Viking heritage, because -ey is similar, so that it is possible to interpret the first part of the toponym as an Old Norse element. The source of it is unclear. Scholars surmise it derives from hj√∂rr (Old Norse for \\"sword\\") or jarl (earl), or perhaps a personal name, Geirr (\\"Geirr's Island\\").\\"Jersey\\", Concise Dictionary of World Place-Names.

It comprises two adjacent and hydrologically continuous wetlands ‚Äì Moulting Lagoon and the Apsley Marshes ‚Äì at the head of Great Oyster Bay, near the base of the Freycinet Peninsula, between the towns of Swansea and Bicheno. Both components of the site are listed separately under the Ramsar Convention as wetlands of international significance. Moulting Lagoon is so named because it is a traditional moulting place for black swans. It is an important site for waterbirds. Description Moulting Lagoon is a coastal lagoon, or largely enclosed estuary, formed at the mouths of the Swan and Apsley Rivers, which have a combined catchment area of 900 km2, and sheltered from the ocean by Nine Mile Spit. It is adjacent to the Apsley Marshes which store and filter floodwater from the Apsley River for gradual release into the lagoon. The geology of the site is dominated by Holocene alluvial gravels and sands with smaller areas of Jurassic dolerite and Triassic sandstone. Average annual rainfall (recorded at Swansea) is 611 mm; average maximum temperatures are 13 ¬∞C in winter and 22 ¬∞C in summer. The tidal range of the lagoon varies from 0.3 m in its upper reaches to 0.8 m at the mouth. Although the lagoon's hydrology is usually dominated by its estuarine nature, during peak flows of the Swan River these are overridden by large quantities of fresh water. During hot, dry weather, salinity levels may reach twice that of seawater in some areas. The lagoon contains areas of both deep and shallow water and is surrounded by tidal mudflats and saltmarsh. The western shore has been cleared and is mainly used for agriculture and livestock grazing; the eastern shore retains much of its native vegetation. =Plants= Zostera seagrasses cover about 25 km2 of the lagoon bed. The margins support successive bands of beaded glasswort, jointed rush and Poa grass tussocks, swamp paperbark and silver wattle, and Oyster Bay pine or pasture. Apsley marshes contain areas of woody vegetation dominated by paperbarks, some saltmarsh, large areas of common reed and freshwater aquatic herbland. =Birds= The lagoon and the adjacent marshes have been identified by BirdLife International as a 63 km2 Important Bird Area (IBA) because they regularly support over 1% of the world populations of black swans and pied oystercatchers. Other waterbirds sometimes present on the lagoon in substantial numbers include Australian shelducks, chestnut teals, Australasian shovellers, musk ducks, black-faced and little pied cormorants, hoary-headed and great crested grebes, crested and Caspian terns, white-faced herons, masked lapwings, red-capped and double-banded plovers, and red-necked stints.BirdLife International. (2011). Important Bird Areas factsheet: Moulting Lagoon. Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 18/08/2011. It supports the largest flock of common greenshanks in Tasmania. History The area was extensively used by the Oyster Bay Tribe, especially for harvesting swan eggs, prior to European settlement in the early 19th century. By the late 1820s most arable land in the region had been taken by European settlers. Subsequently, it became a popular site for waterfowl hunting, especially of chestnut teal and Australian shelduck. In 1918 much of the lagoon was proclaimed a sanctuary for waterfowl, though in 1928 it reverted to crown land. In 1959 and 1980 some parts of the lagoon were given legislative protection; however, attempts to give protection to the whole area was resisted by duck hunters and local residents. It was eventually proclaimed a game reserve in 1988, with seasonal hunting over much of the area continuing to take place, though the use of lead shot ended in 2005. Contemporary use of the lagoon includes recreational boating and fishing as well as oyster farming. =Ramsar listing= On 16 November 1982 most of what was to become the 4760 ha Moulting Lagoon Game Reserve in 1988 was designated Ramsar site 251, and a 940 ha area of the Apsley Marshes was designated Ramsar site 255, mainly because of their value as waterbird habitat, especially for black swans.

Various measures are taken for optical overheating protection. Stagnation temperatures are encountered under conditions of high radiation while no heat transfer fluid is flowing through the collector, for example during power failures, component failures, servicing, energy storage capacity limitations, or periods when little hot water is extracted from the system. More generally, stagnation conditions can be considered to be any situation under which the solar collector cannot adequately dispatch the absorbed solar heat to the heat transfer fluid. Besides any damaging effects to the system, high stagnation temperatures also place constraints on collector materials. These materials must retain their important properties during and after exposure to the high stagnation temperatures. This implies that solar collectors are generally built from high temperature resistant materials. These materials are usually expensive, heavy, and have an overall high environmental impact. Polymeric materials offer a significant cost-reduction and environmental improvement potential for solar thermal collectors and may thus benefit a broader utilization of solar energy for various heating purposes. However, the long-term service temperature of plastics is limited. Thus, for potential applications of plastics in solar absorbers an appropriate design including overheating protection is essential. Feasible ways would be a reduction in optical gain (for example, using thermotropic layers, or electrochromic devices) or an increase in system losses, by dumping of the hot water excess. In this article an alternative method to decrease the optical gain is presented. The method is based on the geometry of prisms and the phenomenon of Total Internal Reflection.  Working principle  Working Principle of the Prismatic Optical Switch. When liquid is present in the switch, the switch behaves as if transparent. When there is no liquid present, the switch becomes reflective According to Snell's law, light cannot escape from a medium when it strikes the medium boundary at an angle of incidence (Œ∏) that is larger than the critical angle (Œ∏c), an optical phenomenon called Total Internal Reflection. The critical angle can be calculated using; theta _{c}=Sin^{-1}(frac{n_{1}}{n_{2}}),; frac{n_{1}}{n_{2}}leq 1 For a polycarbonate medium, with a refraction index of n=1.59, placed in an atmosphere of air with a refraction index close to 1, Total Internal Reflection occurs when Œ∏ > Œ∏(c,air)=39¬∞. Consider a polycarbonate prismatic structure with an apex angle Œ±1,2=45¬∞ placed in an atmosphere of air. A ray of light that strikes the medium boundary at normal incidence is total internal reflected, as Œ∏in=45¬∞> Œ∏(c,air)=39¬∞. In presence of water, Œ∏(c,water)=56.8¬∞ and Œ∏in=45¬∞< Œ∏(c,water), the incoming light is merely refracted and traverses the polycarbonate medium. As such, water acts as a switching fluid. In theory, water can be replaced by any other liquid, with an index of refraction close to that of the prismatic structure, to act as the switching fluid. The optical switch consists of a self-regulating mechanism. In its passive state the switch is filled with liquid and light is allowed to pass through the switch and heat the system behind it. As the system heats up, the switching fluid evaporates out of the optical switch and the prismatic structure starts to behave as a reflective surface. No more light passes through the switch, limiting the maximum temperature of the system to the evaporation temperature of the liquid.  Angular Dependence  Transmittance of a prismatic array against day rotation(Œ¥) (Œ¥=0 stands for 12.00h, 15¬∞ equals 1 hour). The prisms are aligned such that the angle of incidence (Œ∏) in mid-summer at noon. (A); Vertical alignment of the prismatic array for a mid-summer day (a) for a mid-autumn & mid-spring day (b), and for a mid-winter day (c). B; Horizontal alignment of the prismatic array for a mid-summer day (d), a mid-autumn & mid-spring day (e), and for a mid-winter day (f). Resulting from its geometry, the optical switch is sensitive to the angle of the incident beam. Depending on the shape of the prisms, the transmittance of the switch in its reflective state during a typical day shows characteristic angular dependence. This dependence can be used to find specific transmission curves for different applications, where the geometry of the prisms serves as the input variable.  Applications  The main application for which the optical switch was developed is overheating protection for solar thermal collectors. The prismatic geometry can be integrated within the cover plate of the collectors to prevent them from overheating, either by self-regulation through evaporation, or by draining the water out of the switch at a specified maximum temperature. Temperature limitation would allow for the use of polymeric materials within solar collectors, dramatically reducing cost-price and increasing market penetration. Another application of the switch is in windows for both housing and office buildings. The amount of sunlight entering the building can be controlled by the switching liquid. Preventing the amount of sunlight entering a building will reduce the temperature inside the building on sunny days. Finally, the switch can be used within roofs of greenhouses. The plants in the greenhouse can be protected from damage on sunny days by putting the switch in the reflective state. Currently greenhouses are covered with a chalk layer to protect the plants during summer from excessive sunlight. Applying the chalk layer is time consuming and bad for the environment. Once the chalk is applied, it also blocks sunlight during less sunny days. The optical switch could potentially resolve this issue using the switching mechanism described above. The temperature inside the greenhouse can be regulated by switching a certain amount of roof sections in the reflective state. Also the switching fluid inside the roof can be circulated to extract heat from the greenhouse. These cooling methods allow that the (roof) windows remain closed and that the climate (relative humidity and raised CO2 levels) remain optimal and constant. The Switching fluid in the greenhouse roof can be used as a filter for a certain part of the solar spectrum. Water allows so-called \\"PAR\\" light (Photosynthetically active radiation, the light that plants use to grow) to pass, while \\"NIR\\" (Near Infra Red) light is absorbed. The amount of NIR light to absorb can be tuned by solving micro-particles of Copper Sulphate or clay in the switching fluid. In that way optimum growth conditions can be selected. Some greenhouse products, like flowers, are grown by using artificial light during the night. This artificial light causes so-called light pollution in the environment of the greenhouse. When a greenhouse roof consists of a well designed optical switch the greenhouse roof becomes reflective during the night, which keeps the artificial light inside the greenhouse. As a side effect there are fewer lights needed since the roof acts as an efficient mirror.

They research the theme of loneliness. 12 million people live in New York City, 7,5 million of them are singles, living alone. An impressive background for the project. Loneliness is a flourishing industry in New York. Numerous companies and organisations offer their services for singles and those seeking partners. Lea and Marcy for example, two go-ahead ladies, offer courses for singles with the title ‚ÄòFifty ways to meet your lover‚Äô. The two of them teach lonely men and women the ‚Äòknow-how‚Äô, needed to find a partner.

The book was published by HarperCollins in June 2010. Ms. Casey details numerous reasons that prove no one except David Temple had either motive or opportunity. Case synopsis Belinda Lucas and David Temple dated as classmates at Stephen F. Austin University in Nacogdoches, Texas. David became a high school coach, and Belinda a teacher. They married and had one child, a boy, who was three years old at the time of his mother's death. On January 11, 1999, Belinda, 30 years old and eight months pregnant with their second child, was killed by a single gunshot blast to her head. The weapon, a 12-gauge shotgun, was never found. The case remained long unsolved until the prosecutor determined that Temple, a football coach and teacher, had been an emotionally abusive husband involved in an extra-marital affair and, thus, had a motive for killing Belinda. Temple, represented by defense lawyer Dick DeGuerin, was convicted in November 2007 of murder in the deaths of his wife and unborn baby. He was sentenced to life in prison with eligibility for parole after 30 years. He appealed the conviction. In July 2015, a judge found that Temple should get a new trial based on violations by Deputy District Attorney Kelly Siegler of the Brady rule, which requires prosecutors to disclose materially exculpatory evidence. In November 2016, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals ruled that the guilty verdict be set aside and granted Temple a new trial because Temple's attorney had not been able to present a proper defense. On December 28, 2016, Temple was released on $30,000 bond pending a new trial. Reception The book remained on Amazon.com's Top 100 bestseller for months after its June 2010 release.

Besides the regular W800 model there is the W800 Special Edition. In 2012 the S.E. has gold-anodised wheelrims, 2 black exhausts, black engine. For both models, there is the Caf√© Style option, with a front cowl, and a cafe racer inspired seat.

Riemann invariants are constant along the characteristic curves of the partial differential equations where they obtain the name invariant. They were first obtained by Bernhard Riemann in his work on plane waves in gas dynamics. Mathematical theory Consider the set of conservation equations: : l_ileft(A_{ij} frac{partial u_j}{partial t} +a_{ij}frac{partial u_j}{partial x} right)+l_j b_j=0 where A_{ij} and a_{ij} are the elements of the matrices mathbf{A} and mathbf{a} where l_{i} and b_{i} are elements of vectors. It will be asked if it is possible to rewrite this equation to : m_jleft(betafrac{partial u_j}{partial t} +alphafrac{partial u_j}{partial x} right)+l_j b_j=0 To do this curves will be introduced in the (x,t) plane defined by the vector field (alpha,beta). The term in the brackets will be rewritten in terms of a total derivative where x,t are parametrized as x=X(eta),t=T(eta) : frac{d u_j}{d eta}=T'frac{partial u_j}{partial t}+X'frac{partial u_j}{partial x} comparing the last two equations we find : alpha=X'(eta), beta=T'(eta) which can be now written in characteristic form : m_jfrac{du_j }{ d eta }+l_jb_j = 0 where we must have the conditions :l_iA_{ij}=m_jT' :l_ia_{ij}=m_jX' where m_j can be eliminated to give the necessary condition :l_i(A_{ij}X'-a_{ij}T')=0 so for a nontrival solution is the determinant :A_{ij}X'-a_{ij}T'=0 For Riemann invariants we are concerned with the case when the matrix mathbf{A} is an identity matrix to form : frac{partial u_j}{partial t} +a_{ij}frac{partial u_j}{partial x}=0 notice this is homogeneous due to the vector mathbf{n} being zero. In characteristic form the system is : l_ifrac{du_i }{dt }=0 with frac{dx }{dt }=lambda Where l is the left eigenvector of the matrix mathbf{A} and lambda 's is the characteristic speeds of the eigenvalues of the matrix mathbf{A} which satisfy : A -lambdadelta_{ij}=0 To simplify these characteristic equations we can make the transformations such that frac{dr}{dt}=l_ifrac{du_i}{dt} which form : mu l_idu_i =dr An integrating factor mu can be multiplied in to help integrate this. So the system now has the characteristic form : frac{dr}{dt }=0 on frac{dx}{dt}=lambda_i which is equivalent to the diagonal system :r_t^k +lambda_kr_x^k=0, k=1,...,N. The solution of this system can be given by the generalized hodograph method. Example Consider the one-dimensional Euler equations written in terms of density rho and velocity u are : rho_t+rho u_x+urho_x=0 : u_t+uu_x+(c^2/rho)rho_x=0 with c being the speed of sound is introduced on account of isentropic assumption. Write this system in matrix form : left( begin{matrix} rho u end{matrix}right)_t +left( begin{matrix} u&rho frac{c^2 }{rho }&u; end{matrix}right) left( begin{matrix} rho u end{matrix}right)_x=left( begin{matrix} 0 0 end{matrix}right) where the matrix mathbf{a} from the analysis above the eigenvalues and eigenvectors need to be found. The eigenvalues are found to satisfy : lambda^2-2ulambda+u^2-c^2=0 to give : lambda=upm c and the eigenvectors are found to be : left( begin{matrix} 1 frac{c }{rho } end{matrix}right),left( begin{matrix} 1 -frac{c }{rho } end{matrix}right) where the Riemann invariants are : r_1=J_+=u+int frac{c}{rho}drho, : r_2=J_-=u-int frac{c}{rho}drho, (J_+ and J_- are the widely used notations in gas dynamics). For perfect gas with constant specific heats, there is the relation c^2=text{const}, gamma rho^{gamma-1}, where gamma is the specific heat ratio, to give the Riemann invariantsZel πdovich, I.

He is credited with guiding the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's early strategic, operational, and policy initiatives.  Early life and education  Date graduated from the UC Berkeley College of Engineering in 1992, with Highest Honors as the Department Citation recipient for Industrial Engineering and Operations Research; he also earned a Juris Doctor, magna cum laude, from Harvard Law School in 1995.  Career  Prior to joining the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, he worked as a senior vice president at Capital One and as a managing director at Deutsche Bank. He had begun his business career at the global consultancy McKinsey & Company, where he worked in the Financial Institutions Group. Date then felt an interest in getting involved in public policy: ‚ÄúThe only things I really knew anything about -- bank balance sheets, consumer credit, capital markets -- all of that was relevant from a public policy point of view in the spring of 2009‚Äù he said in an interview with Finance-Re-Wired.

The statutes were designed to ensure racial segregation would continue in that state's public schools despite the unanimous ruling of the U.S. Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education (1954) that school segregation was unconstitutional. The legislative program was named for Governor Thomas B. Stanley, a Democrat, who proposed the program and successfully pushed for its enactment. The Stanley plan was a critical element in the policy of \\"massive resistance\\" to the Brown ruling advocated by U.S. Senator Harry F. Byrd Sr.Duke, p. 18. The plan also included measures designed to curb the Virginia state chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), which many Virginia segregationists believed was responsible for \\"stirring up\\" litigation to integrate the public schools. The plan was enacted by the Virginia Assembly on September 22, 1956, and signed into law by Governor Stanley on September 29. A federal court struck down a portion of the Stanley plan as unconstitutional in January 1957.Baker, Robert E. \\"Virginia's Placement Law Illegal, Court Rules.\\" The Washington Post. January 12, 1957. By 1960, nearly all of the major elements of the plan (including the litigation curbs aimed at the NAACP) had been struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court and other federal and state courts.Dickson, p. 320. The constitutional invalidity of the Stanley plan led new governor of Virginia, James Lindsay Almond Jr., also a Democrat, to propose \\"passive resistance\\" to school integration in 1959. The Supreme Court declared portions of \\"passive resistance\\" unconstitutional in 1964 and again in 1968. Background Senator Harry F. Byrd Sr., who advocated \\"massive resistance\\" to school integration. On May 17, 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court handed down its ruling in Brown v. Board of Education, in which the unanimous court held that separate public schools for black and white students was unconstitutional. Although agitation for an end to racial segregation in schools (and society at large) had been building in the United States since the end of World War II,Patterson, p. 1-45. Brown sparked the modern American civil rights movement.Martin, p. 218. The initial reaction of most Virginia politicians and newspapers to the Brown decision was restrained.Ryan, p. 35. From the 1920s to the late 1960s, Virginia politics had been dominated by the Byrd Organization, a political machine led by Senator Harry F. Byrd Sr., another segregationist Democrat (who was also a former governor of Virginia).Bass and DeVries, pp. 339‚Äì340. Top leaders in the Byrd Organization, such as Governor Thomas B. Stanley and then‚ÄìAttorney General James Lindsay Almond Jr., were also at first reserved in their reaction to the Brown ruling.Thorndike, p. 53. However, this changed when James J. Kilpatrick, editor of The Richmond News Leader in Richmond, Virginia, quickly adopted a defiant and unyielding opposition to racial integration of public schools.Thorndike, pp. 51‚Äì52. Kilpatrick adopted the pre‚ÄìAmerican Civil War constitutional theory of interposition, and began publicly pushing for the state of Virginia to actively oppose the Supreme Court.Thorndike, pp. 51‚Äì55 Kilpatrick's hardening position, historian Joseph J. Thorndike has written, \\"likely...helped stiffen the resolve of several key figures, especially Byrd.\\" On June 18, 1954, political leaders in Virginia's Southside (a collection of counties in the south-central region of the state) met and agreed to ask for vigorous state opposition to Brown.Thorndike, p. 55. They began calling themselves the Defenders of State Sovereignty and Civil Liberties, and members included U.S. Congressmen William Munford Tuck and Watkins Abbitt as well as state senators Charles T. Moses and Garland Gray. They selected Farmville businessman Robert B. Crawford as their president. Stanley, himself from the Southside, was deeply influenced by the strong segregationist sentiments expressed at this meeting.Sweeney, p. 27.African Americans constituted about 40% (sometimes more) of the counties of the Southside and the Tidewater, and the prospect of losing political power to blacks intensified the segregationist feelings of whites in these areas. See: Sweeney, p. 27. In 1968 Almond observed that Southsiders voted in large percentages for Byrd Organization candidates. \\"...[A]s a result the Southside has exercised a power disproportionate to its part of the over-all population of the state.\\" Almond believed that \\"there would have been no hard, unyielding core of massive resistance in Virginia\\" if the Southside had not provided such a large bloc of strongly segregationist voters to the Byrd Organization. Almond quoted in Wilkinson, pp. 119‚Äì120. Six days later, Governor Stanley announced he would \\"use every legal means at my command to continue segregated schools in Virginia.\\"\\"Stanley Backs Segregation\\". United Press International. June 26, 1954. =The Gray Commission= On August 30, 1954, Governor Stanley announced the appointment of a commission, chaired by State Senator Garland Gray, to recommend a legislative response to Brown. Officially titled the Virginia Public Education Commission, it was more popularly known as the Gray Commission. In October 1954, a pro-segregation group called the Defenders of State Sovereignty and Individual Liberties (widely known as \\"the Defenders\\") formed.Bartley, pp. 94‚Äì96. The Defenders not only demanded that state legislators pledge not to support racial integration, but in June 1955 called for legislation to be enacted which barred state funds from being spent on school desegregation. Although limited primarily to the Southside and numbering no more than 15,000 members, the Defenders proved highly influential in state politics.Bartley, p. 95. The crisis over school desegregation worsened throughout 1955. On May 31, 1955, the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka (known as Brown II) ordered that school desegregation occur with \\"all deliberate speed\\". Two weeks later, Governor Stanley and the Virginia State Board of Education announced that state policy would be to continue to operate the state's public schools on a segregated basis.Huston, Luther A. \\"Segregation Ban Defied in Virginia\\". The New York Times. June 27, 1955. Then, in a seemingly unrelated case, the Supreme Court of Virginia ruled on November 7, 1955, in Almond v. Day89 S.E.2d 851 (1955) that providing state funds to private schools violated Article 141 of the state constitution.Ryan, p. 38. (In 1954, the Virginia General Assembly had enacted legislation providing educational vouchers to underage dependents of veterans who were wounded or had died in World War II). Kilpatrick and several Virginia political leaders had supported vouchers as a way of circumventing desegregation,Thorndike, p. 55‚Äì56. and the Almond decision struck directly at this proposal. The Gray Commission issued its report just five days after the Virginia Supreme Court's decision in Almond.\\"Virginians Offer Integration Bar\\". The New York Times. November 13, 1955. The report, which wholeheartedly supported racial segregation in schools and denounced the Supreme Court's 1954 Brown decision, made a number of recommendations. Two stood out. First, the Commission proposed that the state constitution be amended to permit education vouchers to be given to those parents who did not want their children attending integrated schools, or to those children who lived in counties where public schools had been abolished.Bartley, p. 109. Second, the Commission advised amending state education law to permit local school boards to assign students to schools on the basis of factors (such as aptitude, availability of facilities, health, and transportation needs) other than race. Stanley proposed enacting all the proposals recommended by the Gray Commission, with the exception of the pupil assignment provision.\\"Gov. Stanley's Statement\\". The Washington Post. July 24, 1956. The governor also sought an amendment to state law authorizing and directing the governor to withhold state funding from any public school district when the \\"public interest, or safety, or welfare\\" required it. The plan would also permit a local school district to close its public schools (in which case every child would get a tuition voucher to attend a private school) or opt to not take state funding.Baker, Robert E. \\"Virginia Assembly Faces 3 Different School Plans\\". The Washington Post. August 28, 1956. =Legislative maneuvering and the rise of \\"massive resistance\\"= Governor Thomas B. Stanley, after whom the \\"Stanley plan\\" is named Governor Stanley called the General Assembly into special session on November 30, 1955, to consider adopting the Gray Commission's report (although not its actual recommendations).Morris, John D. \\"Virginia Tackles Schools Problem\\". The New York Times. November 30, 1955. During what one newspaper called a \\"hasty, almost hysterical four-day session\\",Quoted in Ryan, p. 39. the General Assembly \\"adopted\\" the Gray Commission's recommendations‚Äîalthough it did not enact them into law.Thorndike, p. 56.Ryan, p. 39. The legislature did approve a referendum for January 9, 1956, to call a state constitutional convention. A number of individuals and organizations came out against the Gray Commission's proposals as too moderate, however. Among these were Representative (and former Governor) William M. Tuck, Virginia House Speaker E. Blackburn Moore (a close friend of Byrd's), the Defenders, Kilpatrick, and even Gray himself.Bartley, p. 110.Thorndike, p. 58. For nearly three weeks in late November and early December, Kilpatrick wrote almost daily in the pages of the Richmond News Leader in favor of interposition. In near-record numbers, Virginia voters turned out on January 9 to approve the call for a constitutional convention by a 2-to-1 margin.Morris, John D. \\"Integration Foes Triumph by 2 to 1 in Virginia Voting\\".

After the referendum, Kilpatrick and now Byrd, too, began pressing for an even stronger legislative response, based on the constitutional justification of interposition.Bartley, p. 111. The Virginia General Assembly opened its 60-day legislative session on January 11, 1956.\\"Virginia Legislature to Open Today\\", The Washington Post. January 11, 1956. Almost immediately, Byrd's supporters in the legislature demanded that the Assembly support interposition,\\"Va. Asked to Head Interposition Fight\\". The Washington Post.

February 26, 1956\\"Byrd Summons South to 'Massive Resistance. The Washington Post. February 26, 1956. But a fracture in the pro- segregation movement prevented much legislation from moving forward during the remainder of the regular legislative session. Hopes were initially high when, on March 6, 1956, the Virginia constitutional convention voted 39-to-1 to approve the constitutional amendment to permit educational vouchers.\\"Amendment to Permit Tuition Grants From Public Funds Approved\\". The New York Times. March 7, 1956.Guinn, Muriel. \\"Gray Plan Support Voted by Convention\\". The Washington Post. March 7, 1956. Five days later, 96 members of the United States Congress sponsored a resolution (introduced by Senator Byrd) called the \\"Southern Manifesto\\", which denounced the Brown decision and encouraged states to \\"resist forced integration by any means.\\"Shuster, Alvin. \\"96 in Congress Open Drive to Upset Integration Ruling\\". The New York Times. March 12, 1956Ryan, p. 40. But moderate segregationist forces (which supported the Gray Commission plan) opposed the more extreme segregationists (who believed that public opinion was becoming more and more inflamed against Brown). Byrd cautioned Virginia state legislators to \\"go slow\\" (a now-famous political phrase).Ryan, pp. 40‚Äì41.Baker, Robert E. \\"Leaders Say 'Go Slow' in Gray Issue\\". The Washington Post. January 11, 1956. Byrd and the other extreme segregationists hoped that public opinion would continue to harden against Brown, allowing political leaders to adopt interposition rather than a more moderate response.Mays, p. 137. But the moderate segregationists, too, had some early successes. A resolution declaring the Brown decision null and void was defeated by the state house on January 18.Baker, Robert E. \\"Va. House Votes Gray Bill\\". The Washington Post. January 19, 1956. As moderates battled extremists in the General Assembly and time wore on, many state legislators began to feel (with school budgets due in just 60 days on May 30) that there was not enough time to pass the Gray Commission plan.Baker, Robert E. \\"Gray Plan Delay for Year Seen\\". The Washington Post. February 11, 1956. The two sides began to fight over whether to delay a year before passing any new school legislation.\\"Gray Plan Delay Mapped in Bill\\". The Washington Post.

The Washington Post. February 24, 1956Baker, Robert E. \\"Moore Resolution Passed\\". The Washington Post. February 29, 1956.

Three days before the legislature adjourned, Governor Stanley proposed a plan to deny state funds to any school district which integrated. But this plan was also defeated.Baker, Robert E. \\"Gov. Stanley Is Beaten on Gray Clause\\". The Washington Post. March 10, 1956. The legislative session ended on March 12, 1956. The Stanley plan Although calls for a special session of the legislature had been made in February and March, Governor Stanley was not initially receptive to the idea at the beginning of April.\\"Gov. Stanley Cool to Idea of Calling Special Session.\\" The Washington Post. April 1, 1956. In mid-April, Virginia Lieutenant Governor Gi Stevens urged Stanley to call a special session of the General Assembly to reconsider the Gray Commission proposals.\\"Va.

During the spring and into the summer, Stanley began meeting with Senator Byrd, State Senator Gray, and others to strategize about a course of action. Byrd was concerned that one or more local school districts might integrate, creating a domino effect that would lead to integration across the entire South. Preventing this from happening became the preeminent concern of Stanley, Byrd, and the others. Stanley called the Gray Commission back into session in late May 1956, but the group was unable to immediately come up with any new recommendations.Baker, Robert E. \\"Va.

June 4, 1956. On June 4, the Gray Commission again reported to the governor that it had not been able to improve on its November proposals, but it, too, advised the governor to call a special session of the legislature.Morris, John D. \\"Virginia Reviews School Bias Issue.\\" The New York Times. June 5, 1956; Baker, Robert E. \\"Gray Group Asks Special Session on Va. Schools.\\" The Washington Post. June 5, 1956. The following day, Governor Stanley announced he would call the legislature into special session in late August.\\"Gov. Stanley Promises Va. Session In 90 Days.\\" The Washington Post. June 7, 1956. Governor Stanley's reversal of position regarding the special session seemed inexplicable, especially in light of the lack of new legislative proposals, but events had transpired which had changed his mind. In part, Stanley himself had come around to the \\"massive resistance\\" viewpoint. Various court decisions of the previous spring had convinced him that the federal courts (and the federal government) would not compromise on the issue of segregation.Younger, p. 344. Additionally, Stanley felt emboldened by a change in his status within the Byrd Organization. Initially, Senator Byrd had kept Stanley out of his inner circle's legislative discussions. But by late spring Byrd began including Stanley in these talks. Byrd and his close political allies were pressing for extreme measures (such as closing schools) in response to integration, and Stanley realized that action had to be taken soon or integration would occur before these measures could be enacted.Sweeney, p. 116-117. In this regard, Stanley was going against the Byrd Organization, which believed that public opinion would become even more extreme during the summer and give the organization greater political capital and freedom of movement.Sweeney, p. 117. =Crafting the Stanley plan= There had also been changes agreed in the legislative approach which had occurred behind closed doors. The Gray Commission's public claim on May 28 that it had nothing new to report was not truthful. In fact, a secret meeting of the Gray Commission's executive committee had taken place on May 27 which Representative Howard W. Smith, Representative Watkins Moorman Abbitt, Representative Burr Harrison, Tuck, and other outsiders had attended.Mays, p. 133. The group approved of Stanley's March 9 proposal to cut off all state funds for any school district which integrated, and discussed a number of other proposals (including a pupil assignment plan, whether to require local approval of integration or local approval of taxes to support integration, and repeal of state laws permitting school districts to be sued).Mays, p. 133-134. Although the full Gray Commission met publicly the following day, they were secretly joined in executive session by Governor Stanley.Mays, p. 134. Stanley announced that he was going to support a special session of the legislature, and that if the Gray Commission could not come up with any new proposals then he himself would craft bills for the General Assembly to consider. Although no plan was formally agreed upon, the Gray Commission asked its counsel David J. Mays to craft proposals along six lines: 1) Cutting off state funds to any school district which integrated; 2) Allowing local referenda to veto the appropriation of local funds for integration; 3) Repeal of state laws allowing school districts to be sued; 4) Allowing the state to invoke its police power to prevent integration (under the assumption that integration would lead to public unrest and disorder); 5) Enacting a pupil assignment plan to be implemented solely by the governor (under the assumption that no court would jail the governor); and 6) Enacting a pupil assignment plan to be implemented solely by the General Assembly (under the assumption that no court would jail the entire legislature).Mays, p. 134-135. No action was taken on these proposals at the Gray Commission's meeting on June 4.Mays, p. 136-137. With discussions on a legislative program at a standstill, on June 11 Gray called together the seven members of the Gray Commission most in favor of \\"massive resistance.\\"Sweeney, p. 139. They agreed to support a legislative program in favor of \\"massive resistance\\" and met with Governor Stanley that night. Stanley said he was willing \\"to go to any extreme that may be necessary to prevent integration anywhere in Virginia.\\" The basic legislative proposals of the \\"Stanley plan,\\" The Washington Post reported, were worked out at a secret meeting on July 2 in the United States House Committee on Rules hearing room in the United States Capitol.Sweeney, p. 140.Smith, p. 43. At the meeting were Abbitt, Byrd, Gray, Smith, Tuck, Stanley, and seven Southside state legislators. The group agreed to a five-point legislative program: 1) No public school integration would be tolerated in Virginia; 2) School districts which integrated would lose state funding; 3) The state law permitting school districts to be sued would be repealed; 4) The power to assign students to schools would be taken away from local school boards and transferred to the governor; and 5) The governor would have the power to close any school district which integrated. Despite the group's many public statements supporting local control of schools, Tuck later remarked that the purpose of the plan was to prevent integration anywhere in Virginia: \\"If they [other Virginia areas] won't stand with us then I say make 'em. We cannot compromise. ... If you ever let them integrate anywhere the whole state will be integrated in a short time.\\"Quoted in Smith, p. 43 (ellipses in original). Byrd in particular was a vocal supporter of the school closing proposal,Ryan, p. 41. and helped draft the other proposals in the plan.Douglas, p. 43. The Stanley plan had the support of the more extreme segregationists in Virginia as well. The first week of July, the Defenders promoted a plan that would withdraw the legal basis for lawsuits against school districts, permit state takeovers of school districts which integrated, and deny state funds to school districts which integrated.Mays, p. 143-144. The Defenders opposed any pupil assignment plan as too moderate a response. Accommodating this extremist sentiment, the pupil assignment plan approved at the July 2 meeting was fairly weak. After the meeting, Gray independently asked Mays to draft a stronger pupil assignment proposal. Events soon polarized the state of Virginia on the school segregation issue. On July 12, Judge John Paul Jr., of the Western District Court of Virginia ordered the racial integration of public schools in Charlottesville, Virginia.\\"Segregation In Virginia Broken by Court Order.\\" Associated Press. July 13, 1956. On July 31, Eastern District Court of Virginia Judge Albert V. Bryan Sr., ordered the racial integration of public schools in Arlington County, Virginia.\\"Judge in Virginia Sets Integration.\\" Associated Press. August 1, 1956; Feeley, Connie and Eisen, Jack. \\"Judge Bans Segregation in Arlington Classrooms.\\" The Washington Post. August 1, 1956. The rulings sparked additional lawsuits against segregated school districts across Virginia.\\"Segregation Sparks Va. Court Cases.\\" The Washington Post. July 15, 1956. The rulings also widened the split in the pro-segregation forces, with the more extremist supporters now arguing that the Gray Commission proposals were no longer an option and that only \\"massive resistance\\" and a plan implementing interposition were supportable.Baker, Robert E. \\"Va. Maps Fight On Integration.\\" The Washington Post. July 14, 1956. Governor Stanley released his legislative proposal to implement \\"massive resistance\\" on July 23, 1956, and set August 27, 1956, as the start of the General Assembly's special session.Baker, Robert E. \\"Integration Ban Sought By Stanley In Virginia.\\" The Washington Post. July 24, 1956. He made it clear that he would not permit desegregation. \\"There shall be no mixing of the races in the public schools, anywhere in Virginia,\\" he said on July 23. =Drafting the legislation= J. Lindsay Almond, whose opinions as Virginia's Attorney General helped shape the Stanley plan. The Stanley plan split the Executive Committee of the Gray Commission. Attorney General Almond (not a Byrd Organization insider and privately already seeking the governorship) drafted a substitute school closing bill on July 25 that limited the conditions under which the governor could close schools but which Almond thought was more likely to pass constitutional muster.Mays, p. 148-149. On July 26, Southside politicians attempted to force a vote through the Gray Commission which endorsed the Stanley plan (as redrafted by Almond), but the vote failed.Baker, Robert E. \\"Stanley Plan Fails to Gain Indorsement.\\" The Washington Post. July 27, 1956; Gates, p. 169.Bartley, p. 113. The commission did vote, however, to have Mays draft legislation to implement the proposals contained in the Gray Commission report as well as the governor's recommendations.Mays, p. 150. Mays spent most of July 31 drafting this legislation with four others: Almond; Mays' associate Henry T. Wickham;Slayton, Jeremy. \\"Henry Taylor Wickham, Retired Lawyer, Dies at 88.\\" Richmond Times-Dispatch. November 12, 2008. Commission staffer John B. Boatwright Jr.; and George McIver \\"Mack\\" Lapsley (Director of the Division of Statutory Research and Drafting for the General Assembly).Mays, p. 151-152. They considered a number of different ways to implement the pupil assignment plan, and decided to bring the various alternatives before the Gray Commission. Wickham was given the task of putting into legislative language the decisions the group made.Mays, p. 152. That same day, Judge Bryan ordered Arlington County public schools desegregated.Clarissa S. Thompson, et al. v. County School Board of Arlington County, et al., 144 F.Supp. 239 (1956). Mays told the drafting group that Bryan's decision invited a pupil assignment program and suggested it might pass constitutional muster. Almond agreed, and on August 1 told the press that Judge Bryan's decision left open the possibility of implementing a pupil assignment plan that would be neutral on its face but which could keep schools segregated.\\"Almond Says Bryan Decision Opens Way to Pupil Placing.\\" The Washington Post. August 2, 1956. Mays, Lapsley, Almond, Wickham, and Boatwright spent August 6 engaged in additional legislative drafting. That same day, Governor Stanley withdrew his school funding bill from consideration by the drafting committee and asked that Almond draft a stronger version which permitted a funding cut-off whether a district integrated voluntarily or not.Mays, p. 153. Kenneth Patty, Assistant Attorney General, ended up drafting the revised bill for the governor.Mays, p. 154-155. After four days of work, Patty finished his draft of the funding cut- off legislation on August 13.Mays, p. 155. On August 14, Governor Stanley announced publicly that the main thrust of his legislative proposal would be to withhold funds from any local school district which integrated.\\"Gray Calls Commission Meeting at Richmond.\\" The Washington Post. August 15, 1956. In response, Gray called a meeting of the Gray Commission to consider the governor's proposal. Stanley said he would not oppose the Gray Commission's proposal to assign students on the basis of factors other than race (which might lead to some integration). Stanley's concession, The Washington Post reported, was made because it was widely assumed that the Gray Commission was assumed to be strongly in favor of the pupil assignment plan and the tuition grant proposal. There was intense pressure on Stanley to make good on his concession of August 14. In a closed-door meeting with Assembly delegates attending the 1956 Democratic National Convention, Stanley again insisted on the authority to withhold state funds from any school district which integrated. But Delegate Delamater Davis of Norfolk (the state's largest city) said his city would likely operate its schools without state funds if ordered to integrate.\\"Stanley Maps All-Out Fight On Integration.\\" The Washington Post. August 16, 1956. By mid-August, 18 local school districts had placed their budgets on a month-to-month basis so they could close schools on short notice if ordered to desegregate.Muse, Benjamin. \\"Now‚ÄîAbout That Special Session...\\" The Washington Post. August 19, 1956. But wealthy districts such as Arlington and Norfolk let it be known that they would defy state control and integrate. Outside of the Southside, there seemed little support for Stanley's plan. This lack of support led to a shift in Stanley's legislative proposals. Originally, the governor had sought discretionary authority to withhold funds from integrated school districts; now the goal became automatic cut-off. The revised Stanley plan was presented to the Gray Commission on August 22.Baker, Robert E. \\"Gray Commission Yields to Pressure, Backs Stanley's No-Integration Plan.\\" The Washington Post. August 23, 1956. The Commission reconsidered its own proposals as well as the Stanley plan and those of other legislators (such as the Boothe-Dalton and McCue plans; see below for descriptions).\\"Gray Group Convenes on Va. Schools.\\" The Washington Post. August 22, 1956. Before the vote, Governor Stanley said he would not insist on the provision in the funding cut-off bill which would deny funds to all public schools statewide if a single local jurisdiction integrated.Mays, p. 158. Also speaking before the group, Attorney General Almond said the McCue plan would not stop integration lawsuits and probably would violate the state constitution. At the end of its meeting, the Gray Commission voted 19-to-12 to abandon its original proposals and support the Stanley plan. The meeting and vote were contentious. According to local news media, \\"the Commission capitulated to tremendous pressure from state leaders to junk its own pupil assignment plan\\". The Commission also approved a program to provide tuition grants to students in shuttered school districts so they could attend a nonsectarian school of their choice. (The original Gray Commission plan awarded tuition grants only to parents in an integrated school system who did not want their child attending an integrated school, or to parents in localities which voluntarily closed their school system to avoid integration.) Thirteen of the 15 Southside legislators on the Gray Commission voted for the Stanley plan. Of the 12 commissioners who voted against the Stanley plan, two were from Arlington County, two were from Richmond, and one was from Norfolk. At the end of the session, Arlington's State Senator Charles R. Fenwick and delegate C. Harrison Mann proposed a series of bills designed to harass the Virginia NAACP, which Fenwick and others believed had instigated the desegregation lawsuits.Mays pp. 158, 201-202 After the meeting, Governor Stanley told the press that his plan would make Virginia school systems immune to any integrationist litigation. The onus of school closures, he said, would be on African Americans who \\"force themselves into a school of another race\\". In the days before the start of the special session, it became clear that a major battle was brewing between the moderate segregationists and the extreme segregationists.Reikowsky, Ralph F. \\"Assembly Fight Shaping Up on Va. Segregation.\\" The Washington Post. August 24, 1956. Delegates from Northern Virginia openly opposed the Stanley plan as well as calls for even more radical legislation.Netherton, p. 579. Although most moderate segregationists had joined with the extremists in initially supporting the Gray Commission plan and the call for a constitutional convention, the moderates largely did not support interposition. The moderate segregationists also joined with many (such as leading educators, urban leaders from Northern Virginia, former state superintendent of public schools Dabney Lancaster, several General Assembly delegates, and Gray Commission vice chairman Harry B. Davis) who felt that the tuition voucher proposal would undermine public education.Bartley, p. 111-112. Many state legislators also seemed unsure about whether to support the Stanley plan. A press poll of the state House Appropriations Committee showed an 8-to-7 split against the plan, with two members undecided. Support for Stanley's plan came almost exclusively from the Southside and counties around it, the Tidewater counties, and portions of Southwest Virginia. Much of the lack of support focused on whether the plan would actually pass court muster as well as halt desegregation. Delegate James McIlhany Thomson, an ardent segregationist, said he believed the Stanley plan would not pass without a pupil assignment program. But on August 24, Garland Gray (whose own position had moved rightward) abandoned support for the pupil assignment plan because it permitted limited integration.\\"Assignment Plan for Virginia Schools Discarded by Gray Commission Chief.\\" The Washington Post. August 25, 1956. Governor Stanley, however, was adamant that the Assembly enact his legislative program implementing \\"massive resistance.\\" \\"If we accept admission of one Negro child into a white school, it's all over,\\" he said on August 24.\\"Virginia Governor Backs Segregation.\\" The New York Times. August 25, 1956. Enacting the Stanley plan =Other plans= The Stanley plan was not the only segregationist legislative package introduced at the special session of the Assembly. On July 31, Charlottesville State Senator E.O. McCue offered his own proposal. The McCue plan would: 1) Place all public schools under the control of the Virginia Assembly; 2) Authorize the Virginia State Board of Education to operate the schools in the name of the Assembly; 3) Make all local and county school personnel employees of the Assembly; 4) Bar lawsuits against local school districts unless initiated by the state Attorney General; 5) Require that a school district be immediately taken over by the Assembly if any current school district or school board member is the subject of an integrationist lawsuit, until such time as the Assembly desires to reestablish the local school system; 6) Vest all power to admit and/or assign students to schools in the hands of the Assembly; and 7) Require the Assembly to assign pupils to the schools they currently attend, and require that the assignment of any new pupils or changes to assignments be approved by the Assembly.\\"McCue Offers Draft of Virginia School Bill.\\" The Washington Post. August 1, 1956. (At the time, it was estimated that 125,000 pupil assignments were made each year in the state.) Another legislative package was introduced by State Senators Armistead Boothe and Ted Dalton. The Boothe-Dalton plan was less ambitious in scope. It proposed a plan in which: 1) Student school assignments would be made on factors other than race; 2) Parents unhappy with their child's school assignment would have access to an administrative appeals system; and 3) Teachers could transfer schools only as conditions warranted.Feeley, Connie. \\"Legislators to Revive School Plan for Virginia.\\" The Washington Post. August 21, 1956. The key element of the Boothe-Dalton plan was in how it differed from the Gray Commission student assignment plan. The Gray Commission plan assigned students on the basis of student welfare, availability of facilities and transportation, health, and aptitude, whereas the Boothe-Dalton plan expanded the list of factors to include school attendance areas, academic background, student personality, and student needs. Additionally, the Boothe- Dalton plan provided for an administrative appeal process, which the Gray Commission plan did not. It also identified a very specific, time-consuming process for assignment appeals (to the local school board, the state board of education, state circuit courts, state supreme court, and eventually the U.S. Supreme Court). Finally, it contained a \\"local option\\" that would allow racial integration in public schools \\"where localities are ready\\" (according to Boothe). The Mann-Fenwick plan, sponsored by Arlington Delegate C. Harrison Mann and Senator Charles R. Fenwick, was a third major proposal. Their plan established a three-member \\"School Assignment Board\\" in each school district whose members would be appointed by the governor. The plan adopted the assignment factors listed by the Gray Commission, but also borrowed language from Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education (which some legislators felt would help the statute pass court scrutiny). The Mann-Fenwick plan also permitted any parent to protest the assignment of a new pupil to their school (a process designed to give white parents the legal right to protest the assignment of a black student to an all-white school).Baker, Robert E. \\"State School Board Holds to Gray Plan.\\" The Washington Post. August 30, 1956. =Opening of the special session= Governor Stanley opened the Assembly's special session on August 27 by declaring that Virginia faced \\"the gravest problem since 1865\\".Baker, Robert E. \\"Legislators Get Stanley School Plan.\\" The Washington Post. August 28, 1956. Stanley said his goal was to have the legislature declare that mixing of races in public schools posed a clear and present danger to the operation of an \\"efficient\\" public school system (as required by the Virginia constitution). He also asserted that in order to protect the health and welfare of the people, integration must be opposed. He made it clear that he intended to stop all integration. He said he believed that if even one school integrated, integration would sweep over all of Virginia. The Stanley plan had two main aspects, the governor stated. The first was the funds withholding provision. But he pointed out that his plan (which had now been modified even further since late August) would cut off funds only to portions of school districts. (For example, if an elementary school in a district integrated, the legislation would require funds to be cut off to all elementary schools in that district‚Äîbut not to secondary schools.) He also noted that this portion of his legislative program would expire on June 30, 1958. Stanley said the second major provision of his program was the tuition grant plan, offered to parents in districts where schools closed. (Unpublicized by the governor was a provision in his tuition grant plan that would require school districts which lost state funds to provide tuition grants.) All legislators should get behind this legislative program for massive resistance, Stanley concluded, because all Virginians of all races had concluded over the past eight months that there should be no mixing of the races anywhere in the state. Fifty-eight bills about school desegregation were filed for consideration by the Virginia Assembly.Baker, Robert E. \\"58 School Bills Before Va. Session.\\" The Washington Post. August 29, 1956. The administration immediately entered into negotiations to amend the Stanley plan to allow parents to sue a school district to force it to accept state funds (and resegregate). The Boothe-Dalton and McCue plans were also filed. Backers of the Gray Commission plan filed 14 bills to implement the Commission's proposals, but the Gray plan's supporters said they would abandon their pupil assignment plan in favor of the Mann-Fenwick pupil assignment plan. Delegate C.W. Cleaton introduced a bill to prohibit school districts from raising private money to operate integrated schools, Senator Eugene Snydor introduced a bill to allow residents to vote on whether integrated schools should be closed and whether closed schools should be reopened as segregated, and Delegate Griffith Purcell introduced a bill to require a statewide referendum in November 1956 on whether school segregation should be state policy. The Assembly recessed on August 28 for the Labor Day holiday, and did not come back into session until September 4.\\"New Va. School Plan Discussed.\\" The Washington Post. August 31, 1956. The same day, Governor Stanley conferred with Rep. Smith, Delegate Gray, and House Speaker Moore. Their discussion focused on the Stanley plan's lack of an appeals process for pupil assignments. Stanley agreed to a compromise that would allow an administrative appeal (through an as-yet-to-be-worked-out process), followed by a required appeal to state courts and lower federal courts before any appeal could be taken to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Stanley plan seemed to suffer a serious blow the following day, however, when the Virginia State Board of Education voted not to endorse the plan.Gates, p. 170. Four members strongly opposed withholding state funds from integrated schools, which led to the negative vote. The board also voted to publicly support the original Gray Commission plan. Meeting with the board after the vote, Governor Stanley discussed the possibility of merging his plan with some sort of pupil assignment plan, so that pupil assignment would be permitted but funds would still be withheld if assignment failed to segregate the schools. Another blow to the Stanley plan came when Colgate W. Darden Jr., the former governor of Virginia who was now president of the University of Virginia, announced he opposed the Stanley plan and supported the Gray Commission's original proposals.Baker, Robert E. \\"Stanley School Plan Opposed by Darden.\\" The Washington Post. September 2, 1956. =Post-recess maneuvering= By the time the special session resumed on September 4, the number of bills filed for consideration by the Assembly had risen to more than 70.Feeley, Connie. \\"Virginians Air Schools' Fate Today.\\" The Washington Post. September 4, 1956. Stanley's supporters led off the debate in both chambers of the Assembly,Baker, Robert E. and Feeley, Connie. \\"Stanley Plan Debate Begins at Richmond.\\" The Washington Post. September 5, 1956. but Stanley's political position had weakened and media observers felt that he was close to compromising even further on his program. On September 6, Stanley's backers introduced a new bill in the Assembly which would give the governor the power to make pupil assignments.Baker, Robert E. and Feeley, Connie. \\"New Bill Would Give Stanley Pupil Assignment.\\" The Washington Post. September 7, 1956. The new bill expanded on the limited criteria previously proposed by the governor by declaring that pupil assignment would be made in order to ensure \\"efficient\\" (e.g., segegrated)\\"Key Parts of Virginia School Bills.\\" The Washington Post. September 23, 1956. operation of the schools and to reduce a clear and present danger to the public safety of citizens in those districts which integrated. In an effort to strengthen the Stanley plan's interposition elements, the bill also authorized circuit courts to file injunctions against any school district which violated the assignment decrees‚Äîwhich invited the prospect of pitting state courts against federal ones. Delegate Thomson introduced a bill to establish a seven-member Assembly committee to investigate any group seeking to influence public opinion in the state, teacher quality, uniformity of courses and curriculum in the public schools, and the effects of integration on public education.\\"Bills Aimed at NAACP Stir Va. Assembly Fight.\\" The Washington Post. September 11, 1956. From September 4 to 7, the Assembly heard numerous witnesses testify for and against the various plans.Baker, Robert E. \\"Va. Assembly Hears Backers of Stanley Plan.\\" The Washington Post. September 8, 1956. State Senator Harry F. Byrd Jr. (son of U.S. Senator Harry F. Byrd Sr.) endorsed the Stanley plan. He also said that if it were struck down, the Byrd Organization intended to keep enacting plans to thwart desegregation forever. Testifying against the various segregationist plans were members of the NAACP and several Northern Virginia legislators. As the hearings ended, Delegates Lucas Phillipps and Frank Moncure introduced a bill to bar the Virginia State Board of Education from denying accreditation to any private school because its building did not meet state standards. (Many legislators believed that if the public schools closed, \\"white academies\\" would spring up to offer segregated private education. These schools, however, would be forced to occupy buildings which did not meet state educational codes, and the Phillipps-Moncure bill was intended to solve this problem.) By September 9, however, it was clear that the Stanley plan was only holding onto a minority of legislative voters.\\"Va. Integration Session Goes Into 3d Week.\\" The Washington Post. September 10, 1956. =The anti-NAACP bills= On September 10, Delegate C. Harrison Mann introduced 16 bills aimed at curbing the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in Virginia. Five of the bills expanded the state's definitions of barratry, champerty, and maintenance.Barratry is the \\"stirring up\\" of litigation by inducing individuals or organizations to sue when they otherwise would not. Champerty occurs when a third party (not the plaintiff nor their legal counsel) assumes the risks and financial costs of a lawsuit in return for a portion of the monetary award. Maintenance occurs when a third party supports or promotes a litigant's suit in such a way as to prolong litigation when the parties would otherwise have brought an end to litigation or settled the suit. See: Dickson, p. 314. The eleven other bills collectively required the following groups to file a financial report and membership list annually with state: any group which promotes or opposes state legislation aimed at any race; any organization attempting to influence public opinion on behalf of any race; or any group raising funds to employ legal counsel in connection with racial litigation. =Compromise and passage= By September 13, a bloc of 17 state senators had formed to oppose any segregationist plan which did not contain an option for local school districts to integrate.Baker, Robert E. \\"New Va. Bill Set to Block Integration.\\" The Washington Post. September 13, 1956. Faced with defeat in the Senate, Governor Stanley introduced a new version of his plan on September 12 that would: #Make all local school district employees agents of the Assembly. #Require that if a school official assigned a black pupil to a white school, that official would be suspended and the governor would become the agent of the Assembly. #Give the governor the authority to investigate assignment of black pupils to white schools, and ask black students to return to their original all-black school. #Allow the closure of either a single classroom in a white school or the entire school itself, if integration occurred. #Give the governor the authority to reassign students to new schools if a school was ordered to integrate or voluntarily integrated. #Create tuition grants to encourage black students to leave white schools. #Permit the governor to withhold state funds from any school district where segregation had failed. The new plan drew extensive criticism. Southside legislators feared that only all-white schools would close. Stanley asserted that his plan would permit him to close black schools as well as white ones if an all-white school was forced to integrate (although no one seemed able to find this provision in his newly introduced bills). Attorney General Almond voiced his opinion that the new plan would not stop integrationist lawsuits, and that making the governor an agent of the legislature was clearly unconstitutional. When Speaker Moore later in the day proposed a pupil assignment plan that did not permit local integration, Stanley abandoned his new plan and supported Moore's proposal. Stanley suffered a significant setback in the House Appropriations Committee on September 14, when supporters of a local option won a narrow vote to amend the Stanley plan to permit local districts to integrate.Baker, Robert E. \\"Stanley Plan Is Modified In Committee.\\" The Washington Post. September 15, 1956. The amended plan was reported to the House floor. Stanley immediately proposed yet another new plan which automatically cut off funds to any or all portions of a school district which integrated. Under the new Stanley plan, however, a school board could petition to have the schools reopened, although this would require that the Assembly take over the district, the governor to act as the Assembly's agent, and the governor to implement a segregationist pupil assignment plan. The governor's opponents, however, countered with their own plan in which each school board would retain the right to make pupil assignments (although pupil assignments could now be appealed a three-member \\"pupil assignment board\\"). Any parents with children in a school could challenge the assignment of a child to that school. Appeals would be required to go through the state court system after leaving the pupil assignment board; in the meantime, the child would remain at their original school (a process intended to delay the assignment of a black student to an all-white school). To ensure that the plan was a \\"local option,\\" both the school board and the local pupil assignment board would need to adopt a pupil assignment plan, or state funds would be cut off. A cut-off could be avoided if 10% of the school district's voters signed a petition calling for a referendum, and voters approved implementation of a pupil assignment plan (a process intended to allow voters to bypass an integrationist school board). Local communities were also permitted to drop the pupil assignment plan if 25% of school district voters signed a petition calling for a referendum on the issue and voters approved the referendum. Debate over the competing proposals in the House began on September 17, and was highly contentious.Baker, Robert E. \\"Va. Delegates Clash Over Stanley Plan for Schools.\\" The Washington Post. September 18, 1956. The House subsequently passed the governor's latest proposal.\\"Stanley Plan Is Enacted in Virginia.\\" The Washington Post. September 22, 1956. In the Senate, however, the governor's proposal was amended to establish a statewide pupil assignment board appointed by the governor. A conference committee to reconcile the two different bills collapsed.Baker, Robert E. \\"School Bills Go to Stanley.\\" The Washington Post. September 23, 1956. A second conference committee won House members' approval of the three-member statewide pupil assignment committee, while Senate members agreed to allow appeals to go directly to the governor before heading to state courts. When the conference bill came onto the House and Senate floors, legislators from districts under court order to integrate and legislators from districts with small African American populations tried to amend the bill to include a local pupil assignment option but failed. The conference bill passed the Virginia House 62-to-37. After three hours of debate late in the evening of September 21, the Virginia Senate defeated the local option amendment 21-to-17. The conference bill passed the Senate by a vote of 22-to-16. (Although the Virginia Senate has 40 seats, there were only 38 senators present at the time. One senator had recently died. One senator was ill but ready to leave the hospital and cast a deciding vote against the Stanley plan if needed.) The final vote was not taken until 2:00 AM on September 22, and the Virginia Assembly adjourned at 2:30 AM. Among the bills passed in the final hours of the session were six \\"legal business\\" bills designed to curb the NAACP.\\"School, NAACP Bills Signed by Gov. Stanley.\\" The Washington Post. September 30, 1956. They were significantly amended in committee to meet the constitutional concerns of a number of legislators. The bills were merged so that only five were reported from the committee and passed by the Assembly.Dickson, p. 314. A final bill passed on the last day of the special session created a racial issues investigative committee. This legislation established a 10-member Assembly committee composed of six delegates and four senators. The committee was charged with investigating the effect of integration on public schools, racial matters in the state in general, and the effectiveness of racial legislation. The committee was to issue a report and make recommendations (if any) to the Assembly by November 1, 1957. Due to the number of last-minute changes and the lateness of the hour during the final votes, the Assembly held a \\"cleaning up\\" day on Saturday, September 22, to make technical clarifications to the final bills. After this session, the Assembly adjourned sine die. Governor Stanley signed the school segregation and legal business bills into law on September 29, 1956. The funding cut-off bill and legal business bills went into effect immediately, while the remaining school segregation bills took effect 90 days later. Stanley Plan as enacted Much of the Stanley plan was designed so that the governor or the Assembly would be the focus of the courts, and not local school districts or school district officials and employees. The concept was that local officials felt powerless in the face of the federal courts and could not risk fines or jail. It was believed that federal courts would be reluctant to fine or jail the governor or Assembly, allowing the state to effectively \\"interpose\\" itself between the citizenry and federal government. The elements of the Stanley plan, as enacted, were: *Pupil assignment to maintain racially segregated schools ‚Äî Pupil assignment was no longer a local matter under the new legislation. Pupil assignment was now under the authority of a state-level three-member pupil assignment board, whose members were appointed by the governor. The state board made assignments on the basis of race as well as a wide range of other factors, including \\"sociological, psychological, and like intangible social scientific factors as will prevent, as nearly as possible, a condition of socio-economic class consciousness among pupils.\\" Appeals of pupil assignment were made directly to the governor. Students and their parents were required to appeal the governor's decision through the state courts before seeking to move the appeal to the federal courts. *Automatic closure of public schools which racially integrate ‚Äî The legislation required that any school which integrated (voluntarily or not) must be immediately and automatically closed. However, the governor was given the discretion to take over integrated school(s) and reopen the school(s) on a segregated basis rather than close the entire district. Integrated schools did not have to stay closed, however. A school district could petition the governor to take over one or more schools (or the entire district) that had closed and reopen them as segregated schools. Whether exercising his discretion or acting on a petition from the school district, the governor was authorized to act only as an agent of the Assembly. The governor was also required to try to persuade the African American child to return to his or her racially segregated school, so that the schools could reopen on a segregated basis. *State reassignment and reopening of public schools ‚Äî If the governor was unsuccessful in persuading African American children to return to their racially segregated school(s), the governor was authorized to reassign the student to a racially segregated all-black school. At any time, however, a school district could request that the governor stop administering the local public schools. However, if the schools reopened on an integrated basis, all state funding would be cut off. (This constituted the local option.) *Funding cut-off ‚Äî The cut-off of state funding occurred if a school district exercised the local option. The governor had no discretion in this area; the Virginia constitution required that the state operate \\"efficient\\" public schools, and the legislature had defined \\"efficient\\" to mean segregated schools. The funds cut-off was automatic, not discretionary. However, funds could be cut off only to integrated elementary or secondary schools or the entire school district (as warranted). *Tuition grants ‚Äî School districts were required to offer tuition grants to all students in closed schools. Where schools were integrated, the school district was also required to offer a tuition grant to any pupil who objected to being educated in an integrated school. (The amount of the grant was unclear. One bill passed in the final hours of the special session limited the grant to $350 a semester, while another required the grant to be the average amount each school district spent per pupil.) Funds for the tuition grants were to come from any withheld state school funds, as well local funds. (Oddly, there was no restriction on the use of the grants, other than that they be used for nonsectarian education. This meant a tuition grant could be used to attend an integrated school.) Aftermath of the Stanley plan On December 25, 1956, Governor Stanley made his appointments to the state Pupil Assignment Board. The members were: Hugh White, superintendent of the Nansemond County public school system; Beverly H. Randolph Jr., a Charles City County lawyer who later became a Richmond delegate; and Andrew Farley, owner of the Danville Register & Bee in Danville, Virginia, and a local Democratic Party leader.\\"3 to Assign Virginia's Pupils Named.\\" The Washington Post. December 26, 1956. All three men resided in the Southside.\\"Pupil Placement Board.\\" Television News of the Civil Rights Era, 1950-1970. Virginia Center for Digital History. University of Virginia. 2005. Accessed 2011-06-19. Just three days later, the Pupil Assignment Board delegated its powers to local school superintendents and local school boards, reserving the right to approve assignments and deal with special cases or appeals.Baker, Robert E. \\"Localities to Assign Students.\\" The Washington Post. December 29, 1956. The first legal blow to the Stanley plan came on January 11, 1957, when the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia held in Adkins et al. v. School Board of the City of Newport News,148 F.Supp. 430 (E.D. Va. 1957) that the pupil assignment plan was unconstitutional.The case was consolidated with Beckett et al. v. School Board of the City of Norfolk, Virginia. See: Baker, Robert E. \\"Virginia's Placement Law Illegal, Court Rules.\\" The Washington Post. January 12, 1957. Over the next two years, multiple federal courts also struck down the pupil assignment law. The Pupil Assignment Board, however, continued to claim jurisdiction and legal authority over pupil assignments, leading to widespread confusion among Virginia's school boards. In November 1957, Almond was elected Governor of Virginia. Convinced that \\"massive resistance\\" was doomed to failure, Almond pushed to abolish the statewide pupil assignment board, and in April 1959 won passage of a new law which returned control over pupil assignment to local school districts.Baker, Robert E. \\"Almond Forces Win 2 Victories.\\" The Washington Post. April 21, 1959. Angry about the new law, the three members of the assignment board quit on February 24, 1960.\\"Pupil Placement Unit Quits, Raps New Law.\\" The Washington Post. February 25, 1960. On June 28, 1960, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed Adkins and ruled the state pupil assignment board was unconstitutional.\\"Placement Board Is Illegal, Appeals Court Confirms.\\" The Washington Post. June 29, 1960.Consolidated under Hill V. School Board of City of Norfolk, Virginia 282 F.2d 473 (4th Cir., 1960) During its three-year existence, the state board made 450,000 pupil assignments but had never permitted an African American child to attend school with whites. The school closure portion of the Stanley plan was not challenged until after it was invoked, and no school closures occurred until September 1958. In August 1958, federal courts were nearing decisions on the integration of school systems in Charlottesville, Norfolk, and Warren County. On September 4, Governor Almond stripped all local school boards and school district superintendents throughout the state of their authority to assign pupils, and ordered the school boards of the three jurisdictions to refuse to assign any black students to white schools.Baker, Robert E. and Feeley, Connie. \\"Almond Instructs Boards to Refuse Pupil Assignment.\\" The Washington Post. September 5, 1958. A day later, a federal court ordered the immediate integration of Warren County public schools.\\"High School Ordered Open to 22 Negroes in Warren County, Va.\\" The Washington Post. September 6, 1958. On September 11, invoking the Stanley plan's school closure provisions, Governor Almond closed the Warren County public school system.\\"First Closing.\\" The Washington Post.

Charlottesville schools were closed on September 17,McBee, Susanna. \\"Closure of Schools in Charlottesville Was an Anti-Climax to City Residents.\\" The Washington Post.

September 24, 1958; Baker, Robert E. \\"Almond Has Plan to Open 9 Schools.\\" The Washington Post. October 1, 1958. Parents of African American students immediately sued to have the school closure laws invalidated. On January 18, 1959, the Supreme Court of Virginia held in Harrison v. Day,200 Va. 439, 106 S.E.2d 636 (1959) that the school closing law violated Section 129 of the Virginia constitution (which required the state to \\"maintain an efficient system of public free schools throughout the State\\").Baker, Robert E. \\"Courts Void Va. School Resistance\\". The Washington Post. January 20, 1959.\\"Virginia School Closings Voided by Federal Court\\". The Washington Post. January 20, 1959. The very same day, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia held in James v. Almond170 F.Supp. 331 (1959) that the school closing statute violated the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Faced with overwhelming court opposition to the Stanley plan, Almond announced a major policy shift. Almond had first signaled that he intended to abandon \\"massive resistance\\" in September 1958 after the first wave of school closings.Baker, Robert E. \\"Virginia Eyes Shift in Resistance Policy\\". The Washington Post. September 14, 1958. But public opinion had yet to coalesce against \\"massive resistance\\". By January, with even Virginia courts siding against the state and citizens increasingly angry that their children's education was being sacrificed to maintain segregation,In Norfolk, the population was in open political revolt against the Stanley plan. See: Lawson, John. \\"Segregationist Schools Spark Revolt in Norfolk.\\" The Washington Post. September 24, 1958; Lawson, John. \\"Norfolk Seen in No Mood to Stand for Closed Schools.\\" The Washington Post. October 5, 1958. Almond concluded that the Stanley plan was no longer viable. On January 28, 1959, speaking before a special joint session of the Virginia Assembly, Governor Almond announced that Virginia was powerless to prevent school desegregation.Baker, Robert E. \\"Fight Is Lost On Schools, Almond Says.\\" The Washington Post. January 29, 1959. Speaking slowly from a typewritten script and with obvious deep emotion, Almond declared \\"Virginia has not surrendered and does not surrender now\\",Sarratt, p. 15. but then said he would not use the police power of the state to try to force schools to stay segregated. (This was an obvious reference to the incident in which Arkansas Governor Orval Faubus called out the Arkansas National Guard to bar nine African American students from enrolling at Little Rock Central High School in 1957. The students were admitted only after President Dwight Eisenhower placed the Arkansas National Guard under federal control, and had the students escorted into the high school by the United States Army's 101st Airborne Division.) Almond asked the legislature to repeal all aspects of the Stanley plan which had been overturned by the courts, repeal the state's compulsory school attendance law, adopt a $3 million tuition grant program to allow students to attend segregated private schools of their choice, and strengthen the penalty for threatening to bomb a church, school, or other meeting place. Almond also announced a study of Section 129 of the Virginia Constitution, a political gesture that was never seriously pursued. Almond's program became known by some as \\"passive resistance\\" and \\"freedom of choice\\" (although it is also sometimes called \\"tokenism\\" or \\"containment\\"), a legislative approach intended to shift Virginia toward desegregation in the face of a hostile electorate.Diehl, p. 107; Wolters, p. 93; Obituary Mosby G. Perrow Jr. \\"The Daily Advance,\\" Lynchburg, VA 31 May 1973The commission Almond established was formally titled the Virginia School Commission, but it was better known as the \\"Perrow Commission\\" after its chair, State Senator Mosby G. Perrow Jr. \\"Freedom of choice\\" was the term coined by the Perrow Commission. See: Lassiter and Lewis, p. 46-47; Morton, p. 777. On February 2, 1959, Governor Almond refused to intervene as 17 African American students in Norfolk and four in Arlington County peacefully enrolled in formerly all-white schools.Knoll, Erwin. \\"Virginia Desegregates Today.\\" The Washington Post. February 2, 1959. Historians generally list this date as the end of \\"massive resistance.\\"Duke, p. 89; Pratt, p. 11. Almond later said of his time as governor: \\"I lived in hell.\\"Pratt, p. 13. =\\"Passive resistance\\" and the end of legal segregation in Virginia= The first page of Justice William O. Douglas' draft of the decision in Griffin v. School Board of Prince Edward County. \\"Passive resistance\\" greatly slowed the pace of school desegregation in Virginia.Lassiter and Lewis, p. 19. Legislation enacted by the Assembly placed the burden on often-poor African American parents to \\"prove\\" that their child should be enrolled in an all-white school. (For example, a black family had to prove that the all-white school was physically closer than the all- black school their child was enrolled in. An actual, physical measurement had to be submitted.)Pratt, p. xiii. By the time Almond left office in 1962, only 1% of Virginia's schools had integrated.Sribnick, p. 127. By 1964, it had risen to 5%.Diehl, p. 108. The last vestiges of the Stanley plan were swept aside by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1964. The case involved the Prince Edward County public school system. Prince Edward County was one of the Southside counties. In 1951, the NAACP filed suit on behalf of African American children in Prince Edward County demanding racial integration of the public schools. The U.S. Supreme Court consolidated the case, Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County, with Brown v. Board of Education, and as part of its ruling in Brown ordered that the Prince Edward County public schools integrate. By 1959, a second lawsuit was working its way through the federal court system in Virginia, and this suit seemed likely to force the county's schools to integrate in time for the 1959-1960 school term. On June 3, 1959, Prince Edward County officials voted to defund and close their public school system.\\"County Board Votes Schoolless Budget.\\" The Washington Post. June 4, 1959. It became the first school system in the nation to close rather than integrate.White, Jean. \\"Prince Edward First in South to Close All Schools.\\" The Washington Post. August 16, 1959. White parents subsequently contributed funds to establish an all-white private school, the Prince Edward County Free School.\\"All-Private-School System to Open in Prince Edward.\\" The Washington Post. September 10, 1959. Poor African American parents were unable (and unwilling) to establish a similar school, and sued to have the public schools reopened. On January 6, 1964, the U.S. Supreme Court finally agreed to hear their case.Clayton, James E. \\"Supreme Court Will Hear Edward School Case.\\" The Washington Post. January 7, 1964. The United States Department of Justice, citing the \\"extraordinary history\\" of the Prince Edward County case, intervened to support the black parents.Baker, Robert E. \\"Justice Asks Reopening of Va. Schools.\\" The Washington Post. March 24, 1964. On May 25, 1964, the U.S. Supreme unanimously held in Griffin v. County School Board of Prince Edward County, that Prince Edward County's school closure violated the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and ordered the public schools reopened immediately.Clayton, James E. \\"Prince Edward Told By Supreme Court to Open Its Schools.\\" The Washington Post. May 26, 1964. The high court also struck down the tuition grants program, concluding that providing the grants while schools were closed violated the 14th Amendment. On June 1, the Supreme Court agreed to send its order to the district court in Richmond immediately, rather than through normal procedures (which would have delayed action by three weeks).\\"Supreme Court Acts Speed Action on Edward Schools.\\" The Washington Post. June 2, 1964. On June 2, the federal district court in Richmond ordered the schools opened.\\"Richmond Federal Court Set to Act to Reopen Prince Edward Schools.\\" The Washington Post. June 3, 1964. Prince Edward County officials refused to obey the court's orders, and on June 17 the district court threatened to have county officials imprisoned.\\"Edward Heads Face Prison Under Order.\\" The Washington Post. June 18, 1964. Prince Edward County officials bowed to the court's authority, and agreed to reopen the county's public schools on June 23, 1964.White, Jean. \\"Prince Edward Votes School Funds.\\" The Washington Post. June 24, 1964. The pace of desegregation in Virginia quickened significantly after the Supreme Court's ruling in Griffin. Passage of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 also greatly assisted this process. On May 27, 1968, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously held in Green v. County School Board of New Kent County, that Almond's \\"freedom of choice\\" plan violated the 14th Amendment.\\"Court Rejects 'Free Choice' Pupil Transfer.\\" The Washington Post. May 28, 1968. The ruling led to the collapse of \\"passive resistance\\" and to the integration of nearly all public schools throughout the state.Eskridge, Sara K. \\"J. Lindsay Almond Jr. (1898‚Äì1986).\\" Encyclopedia of Virginia. April 7, 2011. Accessed 2011-06-19. =The NAACP cases= The legal business statutes enacted as part of the Stanley plan did not survive either. The Virginia NAACP filed suit in federal court in 1956 to have the five barratry, champerty, and maintenance laws thrown out as an unconstitutional infringement of the 1st Amendment rights of freedom of speech and freedom of assembly.Dickson, p. 315. A three-judge panel of a U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia agreed that three of the laws were unconstitutional, but reserved judgment on the other two laws pending interpretation by state courts (which had not yet ruled on the laws' legality). Both the state and the NAACP appealed. In Harrison v. NAACP, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6-to-3 that the district court should have withheld judgment until state courts had considered the issue first.Dickson, p. 314-316. The NAACP then brought suit challenging all five laws in state court. A state circuit court held three of the laws unconstitutional, but upheld the barratry law and the law prohibiting advocacy of lawsuits against the state.Dickson, p. 316. On appeal, the Virginia Supreme Court struck down the anti-advocacy law as well, but upheld the barratry law. In a 6-to-3 ruling in 1963 that gave broad protection to public interest legal organizations, the U.S. Supreme Court in NAACP v. Button, held that all five of the barratry, champerty, and maintenance laws violated the 1st and 14th Amendments to the constitution. =Thomson committee= The Stanley plan also established a committee to investigate race relations and integration in Virginia. This committee was officially titled the Virginia Committee on Law Reform and Racial Activities, but was publicly known as the \\"Thomson Committee\\" after its chair, Delegate James McIlhany Thomson.Anzalone, p. 652-653. In 1954, David Scull (a printer in Annandale, Virginia) began publishing pro-integration literature on behalf of a number of organizations in Virginia. The Fairfax Citizens' Council, a group opposed to desegregation, publicized Scull's role in the printing of the literature in 1957. Scull was subpoenaed to appear before the Thomson Committee, and subjected to an aggressive series of questions (many of which did not pertain to the committee's legal charge).Anzalone, p. 653. Scull refused to answer some of these questions, and the committee went to court to force him to answer. A state circuit court ruled against Scull and ordered him to answer the questions. He refused, and was convicted of contempt of court.Anzalone, p. 652. Scull appealed his conviction to the U.S. Supreme Court. In a unanimous ruling in May 1959, the high court held in Scull v. Virginia ex rel. Comm. on Law Reform and Racial Activities that the conviction violated Scull's 14th Amendment rights to due process because the committee's inquiry was so vague and so confusing that Scull could not tell what he was being asked.Anzalone, p. 654.

She debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 8 October 2010, played by Chelsea Halfpenny. Since her inception Amy has been central to main storylines and has been played as the serial's rebellious teenager. Halfpenny has said she enjoys playing the character's mischievous side. Amy's unstable upbringing in children's homes and foster care has impacted on her persona. She is a troubled character and protects herself by creating a hard exterior. Amy's biggest fear is embarrassment and she aspires to lead a normal family life with her foster parents Val Pollard and Eric Pollard. As her storylines have developed she has grown close to the pair, yet rebelled at various stages. Charlie Hardwick and Chris Chittell who play Val and Eric have expressed their delight with the positive impact Amy has had on their on-screen family. She has a kooky style and wears heavy make- up. Other stories for the character include blackmail, one-night stands, heavy drinking and robberies. In 2011, the programme's series producer Stuart Blackburn devised a storyline to help viewers relate to Amy more. It began when Amy discovers she is pregnant by the serial's villain Cain Dingle. As the narrative progresses, Amy becomes ostracised as the fear of losing her new- found family increases. Halfpenny announced her departure from Emmerdale in October 2013, and she departed on 14 November 2013. The character was reintroduced on 7 March 2019, with Natalie Ann Jamieson now in the role. Amy has received mixed reviews from critics. Entertainment website Digital Spy has favoured many of her storylines. Halfpenny has been nominated for three Best Newcomer awards for her portrayal of Amy. Character development =Creation and characterisation= Series producer Gavin Blyth first mentioned Amy's arrival in June 2010. He said the characters of Val (Charlie Hardwick) and Eric Pollard (Chris Chittell) faced a \\"fascinating future\\" with the arrival of a \\"fresh-faced stranger who takes a shine to the pair.\\" Amy debuted on-screen on 8 October 2010 when she found herself stranded outside the village. She later moves in with Val and Eric and attempts to rebuild her life. Amy is a happy character with a mischievous personality. As Amy grew up in foster care it shows in her persona. Though it is often hard for people to understand why she acts wayward, she also has the vulnerability factor. Halfpenny said she likes Amy's mischievous side and hoped she would not learn to be sensible. Halfpenny also felt it was important that Amy remained youthful because she disliked portrayals of teenagers growing up too quickly. She found it easy to portray a character younger than herself as she could base aspects of Amy's story on her own teenage experience. At times she is scared she puts on a \\"hard exterior\\". Amy has a distinct style, Halfpenny described it as being quite \\"out there\\" in her choice of clothing and make-up. Halfpenny said that viewers would not be getting used to Amy's \\"nice side\\" and reminded them that she is good at \\"lying and scheming\\". She concluded that Amy's bad side was due to resurface. =Adjusting to family life= After Val and Eric foster Amy, she starts acting rebellious again. She starts drinking and throwing herself at men, forcing her foster parents to have second thoughts. Halfpenny told Inside Soap that Amy goes off the rails because she is convinced everything goes wrong in her life. \\"She's afraid of getting hurt, so she spoils things for herself before anyone else can get there first.\\" Halfpenny explained that Val's parental approach compared to Eric's was contrasting. Eric had not been around when his son David Metcalfe (Matthew Wolfenden) grew up, Halfpenny said this factor meant that Eric is not tolerant with Amy's bad behaviour. Though, Val had brought up her own children, her approach towards Amy is \\"light-hearted.\\" However, when Amy continues her alcohol binges, Val and Eric feel she has \\"gone too far\\" and \\"question their ability to cope with her.\\" Served with an ultimatum, Amy has to endure changes to remain with her new family. Halfpenny claimed the main change she had to make was \\"to keep her tongue in her own mouth and cool it down with the boys.\\" Off-screen Wolfenden, Hardwick and Chittel were thrilled by Amy's inclusion. Wolfenden said Halfpenny's acting skill has \\"freshened the whole place up.\\" In comparison, David was initially hostile to Amy's inclusion in his family. However, in one storyline his attitude towards her softens and results in Amy developing feelings for him. Wolfenden said David \\"has a soft spot for Amy\\" and flirted with her. Over time he began to see her as his \\"little sister.\\" When David's girlfriend, Leyla Harding (Roxy Shahidi) accuses Amy of stealing from the shop, David proves her innocence by exposing Alicia Gallagher (Natalie Anderson) as the thief. Wolfenden added that David has given out the wrong signals and acted naive during the story arc. Wolfenden explained that Amy misreads the signs because \\"she never had that sort of affection when she was growing up.\\" Amy kisses David which shocks him, though Wolfenden felt it should not surprise him. Amy lies to her best friend Victoria Sugden (Isabel Hodgins), claiming she has slept with him and runs away from home. Halfpenny revealed that Amy genuinely liked David and thought the feeling was mutual. \\"She wouldn't do it to embarrass herself; i think that is one of Amy's biggest fears being embarrassed.\\" When David tracks Amy down; she blackmails him in return for the truth but David exposes her to Eric. Halfpenny said Amy was hurt by David's deception because she trusted him and despite their problems had a \\"good relationship\\". Eric tries to convince Amy to return home to lead the life she had always wanted, because \\"deep down he really cares about her.\\" The strict parenting role is played once again with Eric, and Halfpenny branded the moment as Amy \\"meeting her match.\\" As \\"nothing is straight forward with Amy\\", she returns home but finds telling the truth hard. Amy settles into village life until Jared Haynes (Philip Hill-Pearson) arrives and blackmails Amy. An Emmerdale spokesperson revealed that Amy had an affair with Jared's father and ruined his family. \\"She‚Äôs got herself in a mess and this is just the start of her problems.\\" Amy steals from Val and Eric to pay Jared off. At this point in the story Val and Eric \\"are sick of Amy's bad behaviour.\\" Val refuses to give her any more help. =Cain Dingle and pregnancy= Amy's role in the serial increased with her much publicised pregnancy storyline. The plot begins when Amy has sex with Cain Dingle (Jeff Hordley). Halfpenny said \\"It's Amy who takes the lead and it goes from there.\\" Hordley explained that Amy's attention inflates Cain's ego and he thinks \\"'aye, aye\\". It's still young but in his book, he's like, 'wahey, I've still got it'.\\" However, when he learns she is sixteen, \\"he feels incredibly stupid and \\"embarrassed.\\" Cain shows no guilt and orders her to keep her distance. Halfpenny said Amy is not fazed by Cain's attitude and uses the situation to make David jealous. In August 2011, Amy discovers she is pregnant and is left in a state of shock. With the storyline Halfpenny received her busiest filming schedules since she started filming. Halfpenny told What's on TV that \\"it couldn't have come at a worse time\\" because Amy is on her final chance with Val and Eric. Cain is unsympathetic, angry ‚Äì while Amy is scared. Hordley said Cain wants to keep it \\"low-key ‚Äì to get rid and then move on.\\" He attempts to force her into an abortion and Amy agrees because she isn't \\"very bright\\" and thinks it will be the \\"easier option.\\" When she sees her ultrasound scan, Amy cannot go ahead with the abortion due to her own upbringing. Amy's left in a terrified frame of mind when Victoria tells her about Cain's violent past. As the storyline developed, it held the potential to ruin the positive changes that the character had achieved. Halfpenny said Amy had become really close to Val and Eric. They are in a \\"good place\\" and they think \\"Amy's all happy.\\" The one person she wants to tell is Val, with whom she shares the closest bond and shes \\"gutted\\" to remain silent. It prevents them from having a normal parent/child relationship, as the truth would ruin her one last chance. Halfpenny said her portrayal turns Amy to a \\"dark place\\" as she is \\"too young to be coping with something like this.\\" As Amy becomes preoccupied with fear in case Cain finds out, Halfpenny said it makes Amy do \\"something dangerous.\\" Though, Amy has Victoria to fall back on and is described as \\"her rock\\". Emmerdale series producer Stuart Blackburn said the storyline would change the lives of a lot of people around Amy. At times he said the narrative is \\"truly heart breaking\\" and dangerous. \\"I think it's going to change perceptions of Amy [...] we‚Äôre going to start to understand Amy an awful lot more.\\" =Departure= On 11 October 2013, it was announced Halfpenny would be leaving Emmerdale. The actress said she had had \\"an amazing experience\\" with the show and added \\"It's completely changed my life, as it's given me confidence and I'm coming out of it having learnt so much. I now feel ready to move on and play other characters, although playing Amy Wyatt has been more fun than I'd ever imagined.\\" =Reintroduction= Following Halfpenny's departure from Casualty in January 2019, speculation began that she would reprise her role as Amy. However, Halfpenny stated that she would not be returning to Emmerdale, as she wanted to do other things with her career. On 21 January, Jess Less of Digital Spy confirmed the character of Amy would be returning to the show, but with Natalie Ann Jamieson in the role. Of her casting, Jamieson said \\"I feel very lucky to be joining the cast of such a loved and respected show. I'm very grateful for this opportunity, and can't wait to find out what the future holds for Amy!\\" Storylines =2010‚Äì2013= Amy's car breaks down outside the village and Andy Sugden (Kelvin Fletcher) stops to help. Amy claims she is pregnant but Andy knows she is lying and takes her to the local garage. While her car is being serviced, Amy checks into the B&B; where she meets Val and Eric and claims to be a trainee nurse to get a discount; but tells Victoria that she is actually 16 and has run away from foster care. Victoria tries to sneak Amy out without paying but Val catches her so she offers to pay her debt by working for them. The police arrive and inform Val that Amy stole her foster parents' car and she leaves with a social worker. Victoria stays in touch with Amy and when she runs away again, Victoria hides her in the B&B;'s basement. Val finds her and lets her stay but Eric insists she leave. Amy visits Val again and tells her that her foster parents have separated and she is moving to a care home. Amy locks herself in a bathroom and workers at the care home telephone Val, claiming she will not come out until Val arrives. Val arranges for Amy to stay at the B&B; and later fosters her. Amy starts working for Leyla and develops feelings for David, who pays her attention. Amy sleeps with Cain and tries to make David jealous. When Alicia steals ¬£500 worth of stock, Leyla accuses Amy but David defends her and Alicia admits it was her. Amy kisses David on the cheek to thank him for his support and misinterpreting his concern, makes further advances but runs away after David rejects her. When she comes home, she blackmails David and tells Victoria that she slept with him but later admits that she lied. Amy, Val and Eric move into their new home at the barn conversion but her happiness is short-lived as a young man from her past, Jared, tracks her down. He threatens to tell her new family and friends about her past and demands money to keep quiet until Zak Dingle (Steve Halliwell) intervenes, realizing something is wrong. She tells Zak about her past and makes him promise to keep quiet. She pays Jared but when threatened by Zak, he reveals that Amy's affair with his father caused his family to break down. Zak makes Jared leave but Amy discovers she is pregnant and tells Cain, who demands she have a termination. Victoria suggests Amy tell Val but at the clinic, learns that her pregnancy is too advanced for a termination and the baby is due in December. She tells Belle Dingle (Eden Taylor-Draper) about the baby but insists that Belle keep it secret, scared of Cain's reaction. Amy gives birth to a baby boy in the church graveyard. Thinking he is dead, Amy wraps him in her jumper before leaving him in a telephone box and goes to David's house. She tells him what has happened and he learns that the baby has been found alive and taken to hospital. Knowing Amy needs medical attention, he waits for her to fall asleep and calls an ambulance, Val and Eric. At the hospital, she apologizes for keeping her pregnancy a secret and initially decides to keep the baby, now named Kyle, delighting Val and Eric. On Christmas Day 2011, Amy is bathing Kyle but freezes when she remembers her mother dropping her in the bath and giving her to social services. Amy runs away, leaving Kyle with Val, and confides in Victoria who helps her decide to give Kyle up for adoption. Val is upset by Amy's decision and that Eric is supporting her, making them drift apart. Val tries to win Amy back with a family trip to Portugal but goes alone and clears the bank account. Amy is upset when Eric begins dating Brenda Walker (Lesley Dunlop) and attempts to keep them apart; however, she realizes how happy Brenda makes Eric and supports the relationship. Amy discovers that Kyle's adoptive parents have died. She and Victoria attend the funeral to see if Kyle is there and see him at the wake with his adoptive grandmother, Joanie Wright (Denise Black). When Kyle drops his toy, Amy picks it up and tries to give it back but Joanie doesn't hear her so she keeps it. Amy returns the next day and a barmaid gives her Joanie's address. Amy plans to return the toy but changes her mind and leaves. Needing to see Kyle, she persuades Andy to let her take baby Jack to Kyle's playgroup and makes friends with Joanie, telling her that she is studying childcare and asking if she needs any help with Kyle. Joanie accepts and allows Amy to look after Kyle occasionally. Val is thrilled when she finds out but Victoria and Eric think it is a bad idea and Eric tells Joanie that Amy is Kyle's birth mother. Disgusted, Joanie refuses to let Amy see Kyle again but is eventually persuaded to change her mind. Sadly, while Amy and Kyle are on a picnic together, Kyle almost drowns and Joanie blames Amy. She promptly bans her from seeing Kyle and refuses to even consider changing her mind, even calling the police when Amy visits repeatedly, who warn her to stay away. Desperate to see her son, Amy and Andy (who she is now dating) call Social Services to see if she can get custody but the social worker tells her that being awarded custody is very unlikely. Feeling now that the adoption was a mistake, Amy decides to snatch Kyle and go on the run. Kerry, understanding how Amy feels, tries to talk her out of it but when she can't, decides to help her. They go to Kyle's playgroup and kidnap him and Kerry drives them to the docks. During the drive, Val phones repeatedly but they don't answer. Eventually Kerry answers and Amy tearfully reveals her plans before throwing the phone away. Eric checks the computer's internet history and finds out where Amy is going. Cain, Andy, Val, Eric and Joanie all rush to the docks. In the end, Cain persuades Amy to return Kyle, warning her of the complications of the life on the run and how Kyle might be affected. She says goodbye to Kyle and gives him to Cain but fearing she'll be sent to prison, Amy leaves, devastating Val. Val later gets a call from Amy and learns that she is living in Ireland with her aunt. In September 2015, David informs Amy of Val's death and the funeral date, but Amy believes it would be too big a risk to return to the village. She passes her regards to Eric and the family. =2019‚Äì= Amy (now played by Natalie Ann Jamieson) is found by Kerry and Jessie Dingle (Sandra Marvin) in Belfast, fighting off a scruffy man. Kerry initially thinks she is a prostitute, but a horrified Amy denies it, and says she works at a women's shelter, and the man she fought off was one of the women's husbands. When Kerry tells her that Kyle is living with Cain, Amy is horrified, but when Kerry begs her to come back to the village, she says she can't and flees. However, the next day, she leaves Ireland and secretly returns to Emmerdale, surprising her mother. Amy tells Kerry she will fight for Kyle.

He is usually selected in the full-forward line for his county, often flanking Michael Murphy with Colm McFadden (before McFadden's retirement). In 2015, Pat Spillane included McBrearty in his top 40 footballers in the game today. Among other accolades, he has one All-Ireland Senior Football Championship (2012), five Ulster Senior Football Championships (2011, 2012, 2014, 2018 and 2019) and two International Rules Series (2013, 2015). With this early success, McBrearty is believed to be \\"the most decorated player of his age ever to represent Donegal.\\" He is also part of an exclusive club to have played minor and senior matches for their county on the same day. Indeed, he was the first Ulster footballer since Benny Coulter of Down to play both grades on the one afternoon ‚Äì Benny is still waiting on that All-Ireland medal after Cork 2010. A major contributor to Donegal teams since his emergence at the start of the successful Jim McGuinness managerial era, McBrearty is considered one of the finest young footballers to have arrived on the Donegal scene since Murphy. Opponents have highlighted his \\"ace\\" attacking abilities and regard him as a considerable threat. Like Murphy, McBrearty has been a live target for Australian Football League recruitment. He turns down such offers as he wishes to further his education in Ireland and to spend time with his family. A 2015 survey ‚Äî conducted among U.S. women with little or no knowledge of Gaelic games ‚Äî ranked McBrearty as the seventh sexiest GAA player, second in Ulster and top in Donegal. Early life McBrearty is a graduate of the Phoenix Elite Academy. McBrearty was born in Dublin. His father, Seamus, a former centre- forward, who won three Donegal Under-21 Football Championships and was a panel member with the 1985 Donegal Senior Football Champions. His mother, Carol, is a cousin of Tommy Conroy. His brother, Stephen, is a teammate for club and county. Playing career =Underage= McBrearty used to play association football with St Catherine's ‚Äî also the hometown club of Everton's S√©amus Coleman ‚Äî and is a close friend of Irish association footballer Carl McHugh, with whom he played for Ireland and went on trial at Celtic. At Celtic he trained alongside the likes of Bobo Bald√© and Thomas Gravesen. He has also played soccer for Finn Harps at underage level. He also played underage for his local club Kilcar and has won many titles alongside his brother Stephen. He also played in the under-21 teams that lost to Cavan in the 2013 and 2014 Ulster finals. =Inter-county= 2011 season McBrearty was drafted into the senior panel by manager Jim McGuinness in May 2011 ahead of Donegal's opening Ulster Senior Football Championship game against Antrim. He made his Donegal senior inter-county debut against Cavan at 17 years of age and scored 1‚Äì3. His 20th-minute goal was fired first time along the ground into the Cavan net after a pass from Mark McHugh. His performances during his debut season at senior inter-county level drew widespread praise, both from local and national media. 2012 season By the age of 18 he had firmly established himself as a member of the Donegal senior football team. After his second Ulster medal in 2012, Jim and Rory reckoned he had trained only about 25 times with the senior team. In the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship quarter-final defeat of Kerry at Croke Park on 5 August 2012, Anthony Thomposn knocked McBrearty out of the game with his head, causing him concussion. McBrearty played in the 2012 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final against Mayo, making a notable contribution in the build-up to Donegal's second goal of the game. His attempt at scoring a point came crashing off the Mayo post after eleven minutes of the match and Mayo's Kevin Keane fumbled, dropping the ball into the path of Colm McFadden who promptly slotted it into the back of the net. Dublin biting incident Against Dublin in the final game of the 2013 National Football League McBrearty sustained a laceration to the shoulder, reported to have been caused by a bite from a Dublin player. The Donegal management team took photographs of the wound, photographs of a wound which appeared to suggest had been caused by the teeth marks of a Dublin opponent. McBrearty was hospitalised after the game to have the wound examined. Accompanied by his parents, he underwent blood tests and was put on a course of antibiotics by concerned medics. The incident overshadowed the entire game and rocked Dublin's football team, according to media there. Commentators described it as \\"shameful\\". However, Dublin County Board chairman Andy Kettle reacted with indifference, rejecting the need for an investigation and complaining instead of \\"a hard pitch\\". The GAA launched a probe into the behaviour of the Dublin players. On 17 April 2013, the Central Competitions Controls Committee (CCCC) cited Kevin O'Brien, the 2012 All-Ireland Under-21 Football Championship-winning captain, for the biting of McBrearty. However, most sources did not immediately name the player. The offence fell under Category III and a three-match ban was proposed, enough to end the player's year if Dublin were to exit the Championship at an early stage. 2013 season Stalked by \\"bitegate\\" (see above) since the end of the National League, McBrearty put in a man of the match performance against Tyrone in Donegal's opening game of the Ulster Championship. He played a crucial role in both of Donegal's goals. Colm Cooper collected his award for him from The Sunday Game. His quieter performance in the following game, an Ulster semi- final against Down, was put down to toothache. 2014 season McBrearty received a personal message from US actress Sarah Jessica Parker ahead of the 2014 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final: \\"My body is in NYC but my heart is in Donegal. Let's take the All Ireland and Paddy, bring it home to Kilcar. From Sarah Jessica and her son James.\\" 2015 season Under the management of Rory Gallagher, McBrearty started the opening fixture of the 2015 National Football League against Derry and scored 0‚Äì5 (two of which were frees) in what was his 46th appearance at the age of 21. He scored 0‚Äì4 (including one free) against Dublin in the next game, at Croke Park. He started the third fixture against Cork in Ballyshannon and contributed 0‚Äì3 (including one free) to the team's one-point victory.

Vent-Base Alpha  It was announced in September 2018 that Nuytten was designing and planned to build an underwater human settlement off of the coast of Vancouver, Canada in the Pacific Ocean. A prototype is to be built as early as 2019, with cylindrical living chambers that are powered from Stirling engines powered by hydrothermal vent sources. The buildings would be built on land and transported likely to the Juan de Fuca Strait, and submerged a few thousand feet below the surface.

Stine. Twistaplot is a series of children's gamebooks, that were published by Scholastic from 1982 to 1985. Books #1, #4, #9, and #14 were written by R.L. Stine, who would go on to write the Fear Street series and the Goosebumps series, which in turn spawned the gamebook spin-off series Give Yourself Goosebumps. The remaining books were written by various authors including Louise Munro Foley. They were Scholastic's response to the Choose Your Own Adventure series. After the success of the Goosebumps series, the Twistaplot titles that were written by R. L. Stine were reissued with new covers in 1994 and 1995. Style and gameplay Twistaplot covers a wide variety of genres, including science fiction, fantasy, and horror. Similar to the Give Yourself Goosebumps series, they are novels with branching plots. The books are written from the second- person perspective, in present-tense form. The protagonist in each book is never referred to by name, and the protagonist's gender is ambiguous. Thus the reader can easily imagine himself/herself as the protagonist of the storyline. But unlike the Give Yourself Goosebumps series, the books have interior illustrations. Spin-offs After the success of Twistaplot, the series spawned a series of computer games for Scholastic's electronic magazine, Microzine. It also spawned another gamebook spin-off titled Pick-a-Path, which was intended for a younger audience.

The Saubannerzug (German for \\"hog-banner campaign\\", also Kolbenbannerzug \\"club-banner campaign\\", Zug des torechten Lebens \\"campaign of the foolhardy company\\") was a military campaign of irregular Swiss forces during the Fasnacht (Alemannic carnival) period of the year 1477, in the aftermath of the Battle of Nancy. It consisted of disgruntled men-at-arms from Central Switzerland who moved towards Geneva to enforce the payment of a sum of 24,000 Gulden owed to the Old Swiss Confederacy as ransom to escape looting (Brandschatz). Events of 21 February to 4 March The company consisted of a core of about 700 mercenaries of Uri, Schwyz and Lucerne, who had participated in the Battle of Nancy, and who were unhappy with the distribution of the spoils. This company formed by 21 February, and was joined by men of other Swiss cantons, increasing to an estimated total strength of about 1,700 to 1,800 men. They caused embarrassment for the Swiss urban elites in Berne, Z√ºrich and Lucerne, who were engaged in diplomatic negotiations with Savoy and France, and who wanted to avoid the impression of not being in control of their own troops. As the company marched from Central Switzerland towards Burgundy, they threatened Swiss towns on their way. They arrived outside of Berne on 24 February, and the city council raised the 3,000-strong militia to protect the city. After promising not to interfere with Berne, they were let inside the city and given food and shelter, moving on towards Fribourg on 27 February. Outside of Fribourg, they were joined by bands from Zug and Unterwalden, now forming a force of about 2,000 strong. At this point, they were met with negotiators from Geneva, Greyerz, Basel and Strassbourg, as well as representatives of the Swiss diet, and on 4 March 1477, an agreement was settled upon which forced Geneva to pay a third of its debts immediately, and providing hostages as security for the rest. In addition, Geneva had to pay two Gulden and a drink of wine for each member of the company. The Saubanner The banner used in this campaign showed a boar (sau being a term for wild pig) and a mace or club (kolben). The alternative term for the campaign, torechtes Leben is from Early Modern High German torecht for \\"foolhardy, daredevil\\" (Modern German t√∂richt \\"simple, fatuous\\") and leben (lit. \\"life\\"), at the time term for a guild or corporation. Diebold Schilling the Elder describing the banner mentions only these two designs, the boar (eber) and the mace (kolben), and the illustrations of his Berner Chronik depict them on a triangular blue banner. But there is a banner preserved in the Museum in Zug castle which according to local tradition is identified as the original Saubanner. In contrast to Schilling's description, this banner is rectangular, and shows a much more complicated design: it features a sow (not a boar) with three piglets being fed with acorns by a fool, who takes the acorns from a large bag over his shoulder, while holding a club in his right hand. In the top corner are the coats of arms of Zug, that of K√ºssnacht am Rigi and that of the Wissnacht family of butchers. Douglas Miller, Gerry Embleton, The Swiss at War 1300-1500, Men-at-arms series No. 94, Osprey Publishing, 1979, , p. 27. Miller interprets the acorns as bait for the pigs: \\"a jester chasing a sow and piglets with a club and acorns as bait.\\" Significance Traditional Swiss historiography based on 15th and 16th century chroniclers such as Diebold Schilling depicted the Saubannerzug as rowdy march of youthful ruffians hatched out of drunken Fasnacht revelry, and indeed the term Saubannerzug in modern (journalistic) Swiss Standard German is used in the sense of hooliganism and rioting.so e.g. in the Basler Zeitung, 3 May 2010, NZZ 22 May 2010. W√ºrgler (2004) argues that the chroniclers, representing the interests of the urban patriciate, consciously and severely misrepresented the episode. W√ºrgler argues that the Saubanner enterprise was in reality a serious political and military enterprise of the Forest cantons in defense of their interests threatened by the coalition and Burgrecht treaties of the urban cantons. These tensions culminated in the Saubanner expedition, but they remained latent until their peaceful resolution in the Stanser Verkommnis of 1481.  References  External links A.

He is noted for the journal he left describing the experiences and those of his company in Canada with Burgoyne's campaign. The campaign culminated in Burgoyne's surrender after the Battle of Saratoga. Biography Pausch was chief of the Hesse-Hanau artillery in the Burgoyne campaign. Little is known of him after Burgoyne's surrender. His signature appears on the Cambridge parole, now in the Boston Public Library. In 1786 the name of Georg Pausch is entered in the official calendar of Hesse-Cassel as major in the regiment of light artillery. His name disappears from the calendar in 1796, so that it is probable he died early in that year or late in the year preceding. Journal His journal, which was found in the late 19th century in the state library at Cassel, is among the most valuable of the accounts of the German troops in the British service during the American Revolution that have yet been discovered. It gives detailed descriptions of the difficulties that the Hessians experienced in passing through the countries on the lower Rhine and the Netherlands to the seaboard. It details the fate and fortune of Pausch and his men from 15 May 1776, the day they left Hanau, to the close of Burgoyne's last battle, 7 October 1777. The journal dwells freely on the personal experiences of its author and his men while in Canada, providing glimpses into the private lives of the Hessian soldiers. Pausch's account is the first of the part played by the Hesse-Hanau artillery in the Battle of Saratoga. It supplements the information in the Military Journals of General Riedesel on the actions of the Brunswick infantry in the same battle. =Editions= The journal has been translated by William L.

Biography =Early years= Rufus Henry Gilbert was born in Guilford, New York on January 26, 1832. Gilbert was the son of William Dwight Gilbert, a county judge in Steuben County, New York.\\"Death of Rufus H. Gilbert: He Breathes His Last Unattended by Relatives or Friends,\\" New York Times, July 11, 1885. =Medical career= Gilbert studied at the New York College of Physicians and Surgeons and graduated to become a physician and surgeon.William D. Middleton, Metropolitan Railways: Rapid Transit in America. Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 2003; pg. 17. During his time in New York City, Gilbert became concerned with the cramped and overly centralized living conditions of the working class, seeing this as a major public health hazard, and began thinking about urban rapid transit as the key to provision of more sanitary living conditions. During the American Civil War, he joined the 5th New York Volunteer Infantry as a surgeon, performing the first surgical procedure during the war at the Battle of Big Bethel. He eventually became Medical Director and Superintendent of the United States Army Hospitals. =Rapid transit visionary= Towards the end of the war, Gilbert's own medical issues prevented him from a further career in this field. Gilbert subsequently became Superintendent of the Central Railroad of New Jersey, where he worked on developing rapid transport in the New York City area. In 1870 Gilbert obtained a patent for an elevated railway using the principle of pneumatics. Gilbert incorporated a company knowns as the Gilbert Elevated Railway Company but had difficulty obtaining adequate financing for the venture. Ultimately Gilbert was forced to surrender control of the company to the New York Loan and Improvement Company in order to obtain sufficient capital. The company constructed the Sixth Avenue road, known as Gilbert Elevated Railroad, which opened in 1878. Gilbert was forced out of the company by his partners soon after the road opened, however, effectively ending his career. =Death and legacy= With his health failing, Gilbert died in New York City on July 10, 1885. He was just 53 years old at the time of his death.

Constructed of riveted Swedish rolled steel and fitted with a tiller and open wheelhouse, she was completed in 1914. She was initially paired with the steam towing barge Ouse, and made regular trips between York and the towns of Hull and Goole. During her time with T F Woods & Co, she carried up to 120 tons of Swedish pulped paper rolls, destined for use by the Yorkshire Herald. She also transported bagged cocoa beans, sugar, hazelnuts and gum to Wormald Cut on the River Foss for the confectionery company Rowntrees. In 1931, Bustardthorpe was fitted with a 75kW Lister JP6 diesel engine, and was registered as a motor vessel. Collisions at Castle Mill Lock In 1949, Bustardthorpe's reverse gear failed while travelling down the River Foss, and she crashed into the lower gates of Castle Mill Lock, damaging the gates. She was then sold in 1957 to the Dry Pool Engineering and Dry Dock Company, and the following year was sold again to William Gilyott & Co Ltd of Hull.

The project was designed to implement \\"improvements of cooperation between industry and academia\\" and the \\"Promotion of European robotics\\" by applying concepts under Challenge 2 of the framework: Cognitive Systems, Interaction, Robotics (FP7-ICT-244852). =EURON= The European Robotics Research Network (EURON) was founded in 2000, with funds from the Fifth Framework Programme of the European Commission (EC). The starting date was 1 December 2000, with the network's first meeting taking place in Las Palmas, Spain, on 18 and 19 January 2001. The goal of the network is to stimulate and promote research, education and technology transfer of robotics in Europe. EURON had 230 members in 27 countries as of August 2011, with member institutes all over Europe (including \\"associated countries\\" such as Turkey and Israel). These members are all basic and applied research centres in robotics from universities, technology transfer institutes (such as the German Fraunhofer Gesellschaft), national research networks (such as the French National Centre for Scientific Research), or from companies (such as ABB or KUKA). EURON's EC funding was extended in 2004 for four years and ended in April 2008, with the project being known as EURON 2 during this period. Since then the network has continued as a community-driven organisation and is at present known as EURON 3. Its major goals are to bridge the gap between the European industrial robotics developers and the mainstream industries that do not yet exploit robotics technology as well as with the general public. EURON also aims to improve the education and training of PhD students and industrial robotics engineers. EURON members were partner in euRobotics with EUROP, a Coordination Action (CA) funded by the EC to help achieve those goals. It also serves as a central contact point to the European Commission, mainly to prepare roadmaps and facilitate the access to funding proposals for its members in the area of robotics research, mainly in the current Seventh Framework Programme of the European Union. EURON has two yearly awards: one for the best PhD thesis of the previous year, the Georges Giralt PhD Award in honour of Georges Giralt); and the euRobotics Technology Transfer Award, which honours examples of effective transfer of technology from universities or research centres to companies. =IM-CLeVeR= The IM-CLeVeR project, short for 'Intrinsically motivated cumulative learning versatile robots', started in 2009 as a 4-year research project to investigate robot design methodology for skills acquisition. Its objectives are: \\"to develop a new methodology for designing robots controllers that can: (1) cumulatively learn new efficient skills through autonomous development based on intrinsic motivations, and (2) reuse such skills for accomplishing multiple, complex, and externally-assigned tasks.\\" This project aims to solve also combine the work of a highly interdisciplinary consortium involving neuroscientists, psychologists, roboticists and machine-learning researchers. In October 2012 an outreach video showing the ongoing research on the iCub humanoid robot platform was published on the researchers webpage.

The project was sponsored by the Future and Emerging Technologies program of the European Community (IST-2001-35506). The LEURRE project ran from 1 September 2002 to 31 August 2005 and showed for the first time that social interaction between animals and robots allows for creating non-natural behaviours in animal society. LEURRE's main goals are: to study, experimentally and theoretically, the global behaviours of mixed- societies composed of animals and artificial agents; to develop models and tools for such mixed-societies; to provide a general methodology towards the control of mixed-societies; and to validate the concepts by applying this methodology to the control of experiments in the laboratory and in agriculture. The LEURRE project involved interdisciplinary collaboration between engineers and biologists, and lead to the development of a suite of tools: * The Insbot, a robot that is able to integrate into a cockroach society when impregnated with cockroach pheromones * The software package Swistrack, an open-source software that is able to analyse the trajectories of cockroaches and robots, and hence allow to analyse their individual behavior as well the spatio-temporal patterns appearing on collective level =EUROP= The European Robotics Platform (EUROP) is one of several European Technology Platforms (ETP) to improve the competitive situation of the European Union. EUROP is an industry-driven framework for the main stakeholders in robotics to strengthen Europe's competitiveness in robotics R&D;, as well as global markets, and to improve quality of life. To this aim EUROP has developed a joint European Strategic Research Agenda (SRA), which would help focus research initiatives and innovative activities towards maximum impact. The SRA was published in July 2009. EUROP's roots go back to October 2004, when leading European robotics organisations started to formulate the need for a consolidated approach to European robotics, which led to the constitution of EUROP as an ETP in October 2005.

It administers early childhood services, school-age child care services, youth services, community services, workforce development and senior services. Chinese-American Planning Council, Inc.‚Äôs mission is to serve the Chinese- American, immigrant and low-income communities in New York City by providing services, skills and resources towards economic self-sufficiency.CPC Website  History  The Chinese-American Planning Council, Inc., originally the Chinatown Planning Council (CPC), was founded in 1965 as a grass roots community-based organization in response to the tremendous influx of Chinese immigrants after the change in immigration laws, and in the midst of the Great Society movement. Initially, CPC volunteers counseled families by referring them to local schools, and provided case management services to help immigrants adjust to their newly homes. Filling a void in the community as the first social service agency to serve Chinese-Americans in New York, CPC began to expand its services based on the needs expressed by those in the community.CPC - About Us page In 1966, CPC launched its Head Start Program and youth programs for pre-school and school-age children. In 1970 it opened its first child care center; in 1971, it began its seminal youth program, Project Reach; and in 1972, it opened the Project Open Door Senior Citizen Center. It helped construct two uniquely conceived senior citizen residential buildings, Everlasting Pine and Hong Ning. In 1975, it launched its employment & training services with the English Language Center, which provided new immigrants with badly needed job-readiness skills training and workplace English instruction. The Chinese-American Arts Council, a CPC subsidiary, was founded in 1975. By 1983, CPC was providing home care services to senior citizens through its Home Attendant Program, which continues to burgeon as the population ages. The need of low English proficient, home-bound seniors for language-appropriate, culturally sensitive care prompted the launch of CPC's Mature Workers program to train home attendants, which also answered the need of middle aged workers to find low skill employment that didn't require English fluency. Since the late 1970s, as gentrification of Chinatown, Manhattan pushed up rental costs, immigrants began to move to Brooklyn and Queens, and CPC followed suit, setting up Queens (Chinatown, Flushing) and Brooklyn (Chinatown, Brooklyn) offices and changing its name and vision from the Chinatown Planning Council to the Chinese-American Planning Council. The community continued to evolve in the 1990s, with the majority of undocumented immigrants flowing in from China's Fujian Province and facing challenges that are unique, yet similar to the trajectory of waves of earlier Chinese immigrants. Since the tragedy of 9/11 in 2001, one-quarter of Chinatown's workforce was out of work. CPC responded immediately by launching 9/11 relief services to help dislocated workers get access to emergency assistance, serving more clients than any other such program in the community (3,180) due to CPC's reputation and ability to refer clients in-house to its other services. As the economic slump continued in the year after 9/11, CPC transitioned its 9/11 program to meeting long-term employment and training needs as well as ongoing case management needs, training over 800 clients and placing over 50%, a remarkable feat given the economic climate. CPC has recently achieved accreditation of its childcare centers and received three licenses to open vocational and business schools. A new program enables clients who do not qualify for government assistance to pay for their own employment workshops and placement assistance. The Workforce Development Division is enhancing its focus on health care training programs in keeping with client and market needs in the changing economy, and has introduced a new Food Protection program. In January 2005, CPC opened a one-stop multi-social services center to connect clients to services with a focus on mental health, while the Brooklyn branch is conducting mental health outreach among community seniors. Over the years, CPC has honored many people of Chinese descent who have become outstanding leaders in their fields, including architect I.M. Pei (1978), musician Yo-Yo Ma (1983), fashion designer Vera Wang (1993) , Major John Fugh (1994), film director Ang Lee (1996), Nobel Prize winner Dr. Daniel C. Tsui (1999), Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and author Sheryl WuDunn (2011), and others. CPC holds two major events, a biennial Brooklyn Bridge Walk-A-Thon with a Family Day Fair, and an annual Chinese New Year Dinner. The events and CPC are supported by many elected officials, including New York City Comptroller John Liu, New York State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, New York State Senator Tom Duane, New York City Council Member Margaret Chin, Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz, and many others.  Main office and branches  CPC has three main offices located within New York City. The main office is located at Chinatown in Manhattan, while the other two branches are located in Flushing, Queens and Sunset Park, Brooklyn.

Biography  Luis Tupatu was a member of the community of Pueblo Indians, but he had some relatives of Spanish origin who had arrived to New Mexico as settlers. So his uncle Miguel Luj√°n was one of the Captains of soldiers that accompanied Vargas in 1692. In addition, his wife belonged to a family formed by Tewas, Criollos Spaniards, and mestizos. He negotiated a plan with Diego de Vargas, governor of New Mexico at this time, to stop the fighting between Pecos Amerindians and Taos Amerindians.

Publisher: McFarland & Company, 2005. Format: Paperback, 295 pp. Language: English. Born in Belleville, Illinois, Barbara Hoffman began playing softball at age nine and advanced to organized softball leagues in St. Louis, where she was spotted by an AAGPBL scout who offered her a contract to play for the 1951 season.The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Hoffman joined the South Bend Blue Sox and was inserted at third base. But she hurt a knee and was temporarily switched to second base because the pivot was easier to catch. She hit .212 with 20 runs and 11 RBI in just 46 games, helping the Blue Sox win their first championship title in the league. In 1952, Hoffman was selected to the All Star Team and belted a home run in the contest, which she considered her greatest individual thrill. Just before the regular season ended, South Bend manager Karl Winsch suspended the flashy Charlene Pryer for not going in to pinch-run quickly when asked, which created an uproar after the game. That night at the team's hotel, several Blue Sox veterans talked the situation over. Then five players, including Hoffman, Elizabeth Mahon and Jane Stoll, quit the team in support of Pryer. I guess it was wrong for us to do it. We stood up for our principles, Hoffman reflected. She never returned to the league. Following her baseball career, Hoffman played three years with the South Bend Hoosierettes, a women's basketball team, and bowled for 25 years, but never professionally. She also took a job at Bendix Corporation, where she worked for thirty-three years until her retirement in 1985. After that, she dedicated to selling baseball cards and antiques. Barbara Hoffman is part of Women in Baseball, a permanent display at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum at Cooperstown, New York, which was unveiled in 1988 to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League rather than individual baseball personalities.

It was the first publication of a portfolio of his prints, produced not long after he decided to become a professional photographer, and has since been called \\"a landmark work in twentieth-century photography.\\" As a member of the Sierra Club in the 1920s, Adams joined the Club's annual month-long High Trips in the Sierra in addition to making several trips on his own. During these trips he captured large- format black-and-white images of many of the region's well-known features, including King's River Canyon, Muir Gorge, the pinnacles at the headwaters of King's River, Mount Brewer, The Black Kaweah, Mount Ritter, the Minarets, the area around South Fork of the San Joaquin and Evolution Valley. The best known of these images is Adams' first masterpiece: Monolith, the Face of Half Dome. The photographs he took on these trips became the core of the Parmelian Prints portfolio. According to Adams, the idea for the portfolio came from Albert Bender, a well-known San Francisco art patron. The day after first meeting Adams in 1926, Bender met with him in Bender's office and suggested Adams create a portfolio which Bender would both support and help sell. Bender called his friend Jean Chambers Moore, a well-known publisher who agreed to oversee the production of the portfolio through the then highly respected Grabhorn Press. Bender immediately suggested an edition of 100 copies, plus 10 artist's copies, of 18 prints each. Within a few hours Bender had sold 56 sets of the edition by phone to his wealthy friends before any of them had met Adams or seen what the portfolio would look like. The title of the portfolio was problematic to Adams. The term \\"parmelian\\" was a meaningless word invented by Moore, who believed that calling them \\"photographic prints\\" would not allow them to be taken seriously as art.Mary Street Alinder, Ansel Adams: A Biography, p. 61 Adams later said \\"I am not proud at allowing this breach of faith in my medium.\\" To add to his chagrin, the word \\"Sierras\\" was also wrong. According to Adams, \\"The name Sierra is already a plural. To add an s is a linguistic, Californian, and mountaineering sin.\\" When the portfolio was published it included the statement \\"One Hundred and Fifty Copies Printed by the Grabhorn Press, San Francisco, August MCMXXVII\\". Moore apparently decided to increase the number of copies made after Bender‚Äôs initial success in selling them, but neither Adams nor Moore kept track of how many copies of the portfolio were actually printed. Adams later estimated that only about 100 were completed. Of these, an unknown number were later destroyed in a warehouse fire; it is thought that no more than 75 copies were ever delivered to clients. Adams himself printed each of the images for the portfolios on Kodak Vitava Athena Grade T Parchment paper, which was both cream-colored and translucent due to the thinness of the paper. The prints measure 5 3/4\\" x 7 3/4\\" (14.6 x 19.7 cm) on sheets of 10\\" x 12\\" (25.4 cm x 30.5 cm). The eighteen prints included in the portfolio were titled as follows: *Sierra Junipers *The Abode of Snow *Monolith, the Face of Half Dome *From Glacier Point *On the Heights *A Grove of Tamarack Pine *Mount Galen Clark *Mount Clarence King *Roaring River Falls *Marion Lake *El Capitan *Banner Peak - Thousand Island Lake *Mount Brewer *Kearsarge Pinnacles *The Sentinel *East Vidette *Lower Paradise Valley *Cloud and Mountain In August, 2011, a complete copy of the portfolio was offered for sale for $110,000.

It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and located in the Hillsborough Historic District. History The house was first built in 1821 by Captain John Berry, a carpenter in the area. In 1835, Reverend Robert Burwell, his wife, Margaret Anna Burwell, and his two oldest children, Mary and John Bott, moved into the home after the Hillsborough Presbyterian Church bought the property to serve as a parsonage. Living with them was their slave Elizabeth Keckly (then Hobbes), who would as a free woman be known for her association with First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln. Two years later, James Webb approached Mrs. Burwell and asked her to educate his daughters. She agreed, and opened a school for young ladies in her home. The school ran from 1837 to 1857, and enrolled more than 200 girls over those twenty years. In 1848, the Burwells hired the home's original builder to expand the home after they purchased it from the church. After Reverend Burwell left his position with the church, he joined the school's teaching staff, which also included several graduates of the program. The Burwell School remained open for 20 years before they shifted their attention to founding a women's college in Charlotte, North Carolina, that evolved to become Queens University of Charlotte. In the years that followed, two notable families lived on the site: the Collins family from Edenton, North Carolina, and the Spurgeon Family, who were descendants of one of the Burwells' students. In 1964, the Historic Hillsborough Commission bought the property from the Spurgeon family and restored it to appear historically accurate for the antebellum period. The site is open to the public for tours and events.

The Syrian government's reaction to the protests became violent on 16 March, and deadly on 18 March, when four unarmed protesters and seven police were killed in Daraa. For the background of those protests, see: Background of the Syrian protests (2011).

This does not lead to protests in Syria on 4 February. A \\"Day of Rage\\" was called for in Syria from 4‚Äì5 February on social media sites Facebook and Twitter. Protesters demanded governmental reform. Most protests took place outside of Syria, and were small. The protests were expected to begin on 4 February, as social media mobilised the Syrian people for rallies demanding freedom, human rights, and the end to the country's state of emergency. Protests were also scheduled for 5 February in front of the parliament in Damascus, and at Syrian embassies internationally.\\"Calls for weekend protests in Syria\\". Al Jazeera reported increased security for the planned \\"Days of Rage.\\" * 4 February: Syrian protesters call for a day of anger against the government. * 5 February: In Al-Hasakah, hundreds of people demonstrate for political reform and an end to emergency law. When hundreds of protesters in Al-Hasakah participated in a mass demonstration, calling for al-Assad's departure, Syrian authorities arrested dozens, and another demonstration was quickly triggered. Suhair Atassi, who runs the banned Jamal Atassi Forum, called for political reforms and the reinstatement of civil rights, as well as for an end to the emergency law that has been in place since 1962. However, no protests occurred on either date. After the failure of attempts to arrange a \\"Day of Rage,\\" Al Jazeera described the country as \\"a kingdom of silence\\". It identified the key factors underlying Syrian stability as the country's strict security measures, the popularity of President Bashar al-Assad, and fear of potential sectarian violence in the aftermath of a government ouster (akin to neighbouring Iraq). * 17 February: A spontaneous demonstration broke out outside the Al-Hamidiyah Souq market in Damascus to protest a police beating of a shop keeper. Several men gathered and blocked a road, while chanting that \\"The Syrian people will not be humiliated\\". An eyewitness estimated that there were more than 1,500 demonstrators.

The state news service SANA called the protests the work of outside agitators. :Syrian authorities forcibly dispersed a crowd composed of 200 demonstrators in front of the Syrian Interior Ministry. Al Arabiya reported that the protesters were a mix of activists and jurists, writers, journalists, young academics, and family members to people detained in Syrian prisons.

In another statement, he finally acknowledged the protest but then turned it around by saying that the demonstration which was outside the Interior Authority's building was actually in support of President Bashar al-Assad. * 17 March: Protests that had begun the previous day in Daraa continued.  18‚Äì25 March  * Friday 18 March: Named \\"Friday of Dignity\\" () by some protesters, after a call on Facebook page \\"The Syrian Revolution 2011\\" protests for freedom and democracy and against corruption were held in several cities after Islamic Friday prayers, including Damascus, Daraa, Homs, Baniyas, Qamishli and Deir ez-Zor. It was called the most serious unrest to take place in Syria for decades. :In Daraa, possibly thousands of locals gathered - peacefully, according to some reports, but, according to a contemporary report by Israel's Arutz Sheva, armed  and marched through the city, chanting: \\"God, Syria, Freedom\\" and slogans against Rami Makhlouf, who is a cousin of al-Assad accused of benefitting from regime corruption. They demanded the release of the teenagers detained since 6 March and called for democracy, greater political freedom and an end to corruption. An amateur video purportedly shows watercannons being used in Daraa to disperse demonstrators. Security forces opened fire on the crowd, killing four. The Syrian government reacted by saying that \\"infiltrators had caused chaos and riots\\" in Daraa. :In Damascus, about 200 people tried to march from the Ummayad Mosque, chanting: \\"God, Syria and freedom only\\".

Witnesses reported that the gas seemed more toxic than ordinary tear gas. At these funerals, opposition leaders demanded from the authorities the release of political prisoners. On March 20, the government offered to release the students detained on 6 March as a concession. :Protests were also in three other cities. The Syrian League for Human Rights reported that 10 women jailed on 16 March after a rally outside the Interior Ministry in Damascus had begun a hunger strike. * 20 March, President Assad sent a delegation to offer condolences to the families of those killed in the clashes in Daraa.

A 45-year-old protester told Al Jazeera: \\"For decades we‚Äôve been ruled by an iron fist, by the force of weapon\\", \\"It‚Äôs the first time in my life I break the barrier of silence\\". :Also that Monday, Syria‚Äôs interior ministry stated that the country was facing an \\"armed insurrection under the motto of Jihad to set up a Salafist state\\". :Late that Monday night, according to a prominent activist, 10,000 people held a sit-in protest at the main central square in Homs. Security forces then opened fire and used tear gas to disperse this sit-in on this Clock Square. According to witnesses, security agents then took up positions to seal off the area and blocked the roads to the square with fire trucks, making it look like a war zone. Around midnight, leftist opposition figure Mahmoud Issa was arrested from his house in Homs. :A high-ranked officer of the Syrian army; brigadier-general Abdo Kheder al-Tellawi was shot dead by an armed group in Homs along with his 2 children and nephew.http://www.dp- news.com/pages/detail.aspx?l=1&articleid;=81193 DPnews According to the director of the National Hospital of Homs Dr. Ghassan Tannous, the bodies of the victims have been maimed and mutilated with the use of sharp tools.http://www.albaathmedia.sy/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=33795&Itemid;= Al-Baath Media :More than 10,000 demonstrators staged an anti-government sit- in in Homs, and a massive funeral procession for six demonstrators who had been killed also took place in the city. In Baniyas, about 300 children released balloons with slogans calling on Assad to leave power. :Security forces shot dead at least 13 people when dispersing a protest. The Syrian Ministry of Interior announced that the latest developments in Syria such as the killing of policemen, army soldiers and civilians and terrifying people are all armed mutiny led by extremist Salafi armed groups. * 19 April: In Homs, security forces opened fire on protesters to disperse a mass anti- government protest. On 18 and 19 April together, 21 protesters were shot dead in Homs by security police and Alawite gunmen known as ‚Äòal-shabbiha‚Äô. Wissam Tarif, director of the Insan human rights group, told Reuters that civilian shabbiha and uniformed security forces, mixed, and all carrying weapons, were now obvious in the streets of Homs. During 17‚Äì19 April, protests were also in nearby towns Rastan and Talbiseh. :A colonel-pilot of the Syrian air forces; Mohammad Abdo Khaddour was shot dead by an armed group in front of his home in Homs.http://www.aksalser.com/?page=view_articles&id;=bb7e3dadb9e7d544400864a504f5fdfb&ar;=724862860 AksAlserhttp://www.dp-news.com/pages/detail.aspx?l=1&articleid;=81251 DPnews Police forces use combat rounds and tear gas to disperse a sit-in, deaths are confirmed, but their number is unknown. Police forces cause 3 deaths after opening fire on a funeral mourning dead protesters. The authorities vowed to \\"crush any new uprising\\". A witness reported that the gunfire lasted at least two hours. :The government passed a bill today, lifting the emergency law after 48 years. President Assad still had to sign the legislation. * 20 April: Activists said that 4000 university students protested in Daraa. Around 20 students protested at the faculty of medicine of Aleppo University where they were quickly denied and absorbed by a pro-Assad rally.http://www.syria- news.com/readnews.php?sy_seq=131659 Syria-news * 21 April: President Assad endorsed the government law of 19 April, ending Syria's state of emergency. Reuters wrote, and leading activist Al-Maleh said, that this abolition hardly infringed on the powers of security forces to arbitrary arrests and detentions, or on other state tools of repression. Protesters call for Friday to be their biggest yet, in what they dub as \\"the Great Friday\\" (). * Friday, 22 April: For the first time, major demonstrations occurred in Damascus itself. Other cities where protesting was particularly strong were in Daraa, Baniyas, Qamishli, and Homs. The Douma and Harasta sections of Damascus were particularly filled with protesters. Firing throughout the country resulted 88 deaths among security forces and protesters, making it the bloodiest day so far.  Protests, slogans: On this day dubbed by activists \\"Great Friday\\" (Title: ‚Äò‚Ä¶shoot protesters‚Äô probably from 22 April (no longer retrievable), revised title: ‚Äò‚Ä¶Syria uprising‚Äô from 23 April 2011.) (), anti-government protests were held in at least 20 towns across Syria. Cries for vengeance mixed with calls for the government's fall. Security forces quelled the protests with live ammunition and tear gas. A protester from a Damascus suburb said via phone to Al Jazeera media network that peaceful demonstrators, going with olive branches, were surprised by the security forces‚Äô shooting. A protester in Douma said to The New York Times: \\"We are not scared anymore. We are sad and we are disappointed at this regime and at the president. Protests, demonstrations and death are now part of the daily routine\\". In two Damascus suburbs, protesters tore down Assad's picture and demolished statues of Assad's father. In central Damascus after Friday Prayer at the al-Hassan Mosque, hundreds of people gathered. Some of them chanted: \\"The people want the fall of the government\\"; security forces dispersed the protests with tear gas, witnesses said.  Casualties: News media and war researchers are not unanimous on the number of civilian casualties on this day. The New York Times estimated on 23 April and on 6 May that number as: \\"at least 109\\". The Institute for the Study of War in December 2011 agreed with that number and called 22 April the deadliest day in Syria between March and September 2011. But Al Jazeera English on 29 April 2011 estimated that on 22 April in Daraa alone already 100 people had been killed. First counts of deaths were in Homs 21, in Izra 15 (for Daraa an initial death-toll was not published). Deaths also were reported in the Damascus suburbs Muadamiyat, Douma, Zamalka, Barza and Qabon.  Government reaction: At Friday night, Syrian state television aired a talk show where speakers blamed foreign media, like Al Jazeera, Al Arabiya and BBC Arabic, for inciting the protests. A New York Times reporter assumed that the Syrian government emphatically tried to keep the largest cities, Damascus and Aleppo, relatively subdued. * 23 April: In Douma and Barza today tens of thousands buried protesters killed the previous day, when security forces fired into these crowds of mourners. Again 11 people were killed, activists and witnesses said. 250 Syrian soldiers were also sent to Harasta, another suburb of Damascus, to confront a \\"violent gang\\", a deserted soldier said in June 2011 to Amnesty International, but they did not find a gang there but only 2,000 unarmed protesters, and saw the secret police and security forces open fire on them. :The events of the previous, very bloody, day incited Al Jazeera to entitle the Syrian 2011 protests no longer as merely ‚Äòprotests‚Äô but henceforward as an \\"uprising\\". :Throughout the country, funerals for fallen protesters occurred. Snipers reportedly fired, killing 8 people in Daraa with 5 members of the security forces among them.http://www.syria-news.com/readnews.php?sy_seq=131797 Syria-news * 24 April: In the northern coastal city of Jableh a crackdown of security forces and Syrian army lasted into the night, killing twelve people. A resident said: \\"The army is deployed all over the area (‚Ä¶) It‚Äôs a street war\\". A Syrian human rights organisation said that nine civilians were killed in Jableh by security forces and pro-Assad gunmen.  25‚Äì30 April  = Attack on Daraa = Between 25 April and 16 May 2011, the Syrian army attacked and occupied Daraa, since 18 March the most ardent centre of the Syrian protests. The army reportedly deployed 20 or 30 tanks, between hundreds and 6,000 troops, snipers on roofs, and helicopters with paratroopers for the final conquest of the focal Omari Mosque on Saturday 30 April. Presumably 244 civilians and 81 soldiers were killed; houses were reportedly searched to arrest protesters, houses were shelled; almost 1,000 men have reportedly been rounded up. \\"They want to teach Syria a lesson by teaching Daraa a lesson\\", a resident commented. There were rumours of soldiers, or an entire army division, having defected, and joined the protesters; these reports have not been independently verified. The government claimed it was battling \\"terrorist groups\\" in Daraa. After withdrawal of part of the troops from Daraa on 5 May, army units remained deployed at the city's entrances. * 25 April: Tanks and soldiers entered Daraa and Douma. The border with Jordan was also closed. According to an activist, 18 people were killed in Daraa. * 27 April: The army continued its crack down into the 27th of April, and over the span of three days arrested over 500 people. Several dozen died from the raids. The Syrian government intensified their raids using more tanks and brigades. 2 Jordanian civilians were amongst those killed. On 27 April 233 members of the Ba'ath Party, amongst them parliament members, resigned over the violence against protesters and civilians.http://blogs.aljazeera.net/live/middle-east/syria-live-blog-april-27 * 28 April: It has been confirmed that there are defections from within the Syrian army. Two battalions were sent into Deraa on 25 April, the fourth division and the fifth division. The fifth division refused to open fire on protesters, and there has been gun battles between the fourth and fifth divisions. The fourth division is controlled directly by Maher Assad, Bashar's brother. * 29 April: Bashar's forces have cut off Daraa's water supply and electricity several days ago, as well as other cities in Syria. They have confiscated flour and food as well, in an effort to starve the people of Daraa. Activists called for another Friday of protests, dubbed \\"Solidarity with Daraa day\\".http://blogs.aljazeera.net/live/middle-east/syria-live-blog- april-29 :Protests occurred nationwide including in Damascus in order to show solidarity with Daraa. At least 62 civilians were reported killed, many from Daraa. * 30 April: The military increased their presence with more tanks and military helicopters. Snipers were positioned on buildings. Tanks began firing indiscriminately on houses, and also destroyed the local mosque. Snipers and military vehicles were also placed in other cities in the country such as Homs. Activists had called for this week, starting this Sunday, to be the \\"week of breaking the siege of Daraa\\" with the aim of stopping the siege on Daraa. A video taken allegedly shows the dead bodies of protesters from Daraa wrapped in burial cloth and gathered and stored in a refrigerated room, as the people of Daraa are unable to burial them due to the military and sniper presence. = Blockading of Douma = Douma, a working-class suburb of capital Damascus that had also assumed a vital role in the Syrian protests (see reports 1, 3, 10, 15, 16, 22 and 23 April) was raided and blockaded by army and security forces for at least several days, end of April 2011. * Monday 25 April: In Douma security forces arrested probably handsful of people. * 26 April: According to a Human Rights Watch researcher, thousands of government troops raided homes in Douma to arrest suspected protesters. * 27+28 April: Douma was completely sealed off by security forces, with its residents in need of supplies.Al Jazeera‚Äôs correspondent Rula Amin, Damascus, in video clip at 12:59 pm, 28Apr2011, in: = Remaining Syria = * 25 April: The events of 25 April, especially those in Daraa (see above), incited the prominent international news media to entitle the Syrian protests since mid-March with hindsight no longer as merely ‚Äòprotests, but as an \\"uprising\\".On 23 April 2011, Al Jazeera had decided, after the bloody events of Friday 22 April, to henceforth indicate the ‚ÄòSyrian protests‚Äô as an \\"uprising\\". Starting 25 April (the Attack on Daraa), prominent international news channels considered, with hindsight, the Syrian \\"uprising\\" to have begun in the week of 15‚Äì21 March. Examples: The New York Times, 25 April 2011; Los Angeles Times, 25 April 2011; BBC, 15 July 2012. Since 18 March, 400 civilians and dozens of soldiers and policemen had been reported killed.The numbers of casualties mentioned in this article until 26 April add up to approximately 400 civilians and 36 soldiers/policemen. :Apart from their actions in Daraa and Douma (see above), security forces also searched houses in Izra, 27 km north-north-east of Daraa, and entered Damascus-suburb Muadhamiya arresting probably handsful of people. Border crossings into Jordan near the southern town of Daraa were reportedly sealed. * 26 April: In the northern city of Jableh people were arrested, according to Rami Abdul-Rahman of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The Syrian government said its actions are a response to an Islamist-inspired uprising. * 27 April: According to a report of refugees fled into Lebanon, on 27 April a massacre may have taken place in Talkalakh, 20 miles due west of Homs and near the north-Lebanese border. Syrian military allegedly separated Sunni Muslims from Alawi Shia Muslims; arrested a popular Sheikh; Sunnis took to the streets protesting; military in tanks opened fire, killing 40 residents. Also residents would have been dragged away and tortured. No other news channel has yet confirmed anything of this story. * 28 April: The leadership of the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood, in exile since in 1982 the Brotherhood was crushed by the government, has today for the first time since the demonstrations in Syria began in March, directly supported these protests: \\"Do not let the regime besiege your compatriots. Chant with one voice for freedom and dignity. Do not allow the tyrant to enslave you. God is great.\\" :Since March, 1,000 Syrians have crossed the border into Lebanon, most of them not via the official border crossings. * Friday 29 April: On this Friday dubbed \\"day of rage\\" in most major towns in Syria protests were held, like Homs, Baniyas, Latakia, Raqqa, Hama, Qamishli, Deir ez-Zor, and, for the first time, also in the heart of Damascus, in the Maidan district. 10,000 protesters in Baniyas reportedly shouted: \\"liberty, solidarity with Daraa\\" and \\"down with the regime\\", and 15,000 in Qamishli and surrounding towns were said to have yelled: \\"With our soul and with our blood we will sacrifice ourselves for Daraa\\". In Damascus-suburb Saqba protesters chanted: \\"We‚Äôre the youth revolution, not thugs or terrorists\\". :Apart from the 33 people killed in Daraa (see above), in Homs 25 people were reported killed, according to activists, and in Rastan 17. The authorities said that today nine members of security forces were killed by \\"terrorist groups\\". :In Deir Ez-Zor, 1,000 people emerged from a mosque and were dispersed by security forces, told AFP. : In the small village Jiza near Daraa, 13-year-old boy Hamza al-Khatib was taken by his father to an anti-government rally. The boy disappeared, taken in custody by Syrian officials according to Human Rights Watch. Almost a month later (see 25 or 28 May), according to activists, his tortured, badly injured, murdered body was returned to his parents; a video on YouTube purportedly showed gunshot wounds on Hamza‚Äôs body. Prominent Syrian activist Razan Zaitouneh considers this story plausible: she believes, the Syrian government wants the people to see this and understand that the most awful thing can happen to their family members in they continue to participate in this revolution. At that same demonstration, the 15-year-old boy Tamer Mohammed al Sharey from Jiza disappeared; a video released on 9 June by activists claimed his dead and tortured body also to be returned to his parents. * 30 April: Hassan Ismail Abdel Azim, a prominent human rights activist, is arrested from his office by Syrian authorities. :138 members of the Syrian Ba'ath Party quit in protest against the deadly crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators, according to AFP information. Since mid-March 550 people died in the Syrian clashes according to Arab and Syrian organisations for human rights.

Szwed is the author of many books on jazz and American music, including studies of Sun Ra, Miles Davis, Jelly Roll Morton, Alan Lomax and Billie Holiday. Career Szwed received a B.S. in business and economics from Marietta College in 1958. He also studied trombone and music theory and played professionally for twelve years; as an undergraduate, he worked in a steel mill and performed at roadhouses, country clubs, college dances and speakeasies in Ohio and West Virginia. Thereafter, he enrolled at Ohio State University, where he earned a second bachelor's degree in communications in 1959, an M.A. in communications in 1960 and a Ph.D. in sociology and anthropology in 1965. His graduate school adviser was anthropology pioneer Erika Bourguignon, who encouraged him to bring to his work what he already knew and experienced. His work as an anthropologist and folklorist includes field studies in Newfoundland, the Georgia Sea Islands, and Trinidad. From 1982 to 2008, Szwed was John M. Musser Professor of Anthropology, African American Studies and Film Studies at Yale University. Szwed was appointed term Professor of Music and Jazz Studies at Columbia University in 2008, a position he held through 2014. From 2011 to 2014, he was Director of the Center for Jazz Studies at Columbia. He has also taught at New York University and the University of Pennsylvania, where he was Director of the Center for Urban Ethnography and Chair of the Department of Folklore. Szwed is married to Marilyn Anderson Szwed and lives in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Publications In 2000, Szwed published a study of Sun Ra, Space is the Place: The Lives and Times of Sun Ra. In 2003, he published a Miles Davis biography, So What: The Life of Miles Davis.

In 2010, Szwed published a biography of Alan Lomax, the folklorist, ethnomusicologist, and field collector of folk music of the 20th century, entitled The Man Who Recorded the World. In 2015, Szwed published Billie Holiday: The Musician and the Myth, which analyses the art of Billie Holiday's singing and the construction of her life as a mythic paradigm of African American suffering. Szwed argues that Holiday's autobiography, Lady Sings the Blues, is a generally accurate account of Holiday's life, and that Holiday's co-writer, William Dufty, was forced to water down or suppress material by the threat of legal action. The New Yorker reviewer Richard Brody writes: \\"In particular, Szwed traces the stories of two important relationships that are missing from the book‚Äîwith Charles Laughton, in the nineteen-thirties, and with Tallulah Bankhead, in the late nineteen-forties‚Äîand of one relationship that‚Äôs sharply diminished in the book, her affair with Orson Welles around the time of Citizen Kane.\\" Bibliography * Afro-American Anthropology: Contemporary Perspective on Theory and Research, ed.

It is also known in government reorganization and reform scholarship as the Taft Commission,Mansfield, H.C., 1970. Reorganizing the Federal Executive Branch: The Limits of Institutionalization. Law and Contemporary Problems 35:461‚Äì95 however, this is a bit of a misnomer as the Taft Commission originally referred to the Philippine Commission of which Taft was the chairman. The Commission on Economy and Efficiency is most notable for proposing the first budget for the federal government but also is notable for creating the procedure for the President to establish a commission to study administrative reform. Founding and purpose The Commission, like the Keep Commission, was established to study and propose more efficient methods of organization and reform. Its primary purpose was the study of a budget for the national government but its other purposes included looking at department or agency jurisdiction, personnel practices, accounting and finance procedures, and business practices.Mansfield, H.C., 1970. Reorganizing the Federal Executive Branch: The Limits of Institutionalization. Law and Contemporary Problems 35:461‚Äì95. Taft learned from Roosevelt's efforts with the Keep Commission, which had its reforms largely ignored by Congress, to involve Congress up front to have its reforms embraced. He therefore received approval from Congress prior to forming the commission and received a series of appropriations to fund the Commissions work.Weber, G.A. 1919. Organized efforts for the improvement of methods of administration in the United States: D. Appleton. The Commission was headed by legendary member of the New York Bureau of Municipal Research, Frederick Cleveland, who was already famous by this time for creating one of the first municipal budgets for New York City. New York City was the largest government in the United States by expenditures at the time.Kahn, J. 1997. Budgeting democracy: State building and citizenship in America, 1890‚Äì1928: Cornell University Press. The other members of the commission were William Willoughby, Judge Walter Warwick, Frank Goodnow, and Harvey Chase. The Congressional legislation also provided for a Board of Referees and a Board of Experts.Weber, G.A. 1919. Organized efforts for the improvement of methods of administration in the United States: D. Appleton. National budget Since the end of the 19th Century, the federal government was running deficits because of a weak tax base and pent up demand for services. Therefore, the primary purpose of the Commission was to develop a better method for providing for a more rationalized budget system. The members of the Commission brought their work from the New York Bureau of Municipal Research and began applying it to the national government.Kahn, J. 1997. Budgeting democracy: State building and citizenship in America, 1890‚Äì1928: Cornell University Press. From their early studies of the federal government and previous experience of creating the New York budget, the Commission published The Need for a National Budget, a report calling for the federal government to create a national budget. The Commission was not content to create a document which just explained the idea of the federal executive budget. Willoughby and Taft went against the expressed opinion of Congress that the President had the right to deliver any information to Congress in any way that the President chose. President Taft submitted to Congress the first consolidated federal budget in the form that the Commission had created in 1913.Weber, G.A. 1919. Organized efforts for the improvement of methods of administration in the United States: D. Appleton. This would be President Taft's last official act of state. While Congress generally ignored Taft's budget, the budget idea was firmly established. Legacy of the Commission Like most major governmental reforms, the main purposes and recommendation were contested and not immediately acted upon. Besides some reforms that could be acted upon administratively, the Commission has had two major, lasting legacies. The first legacy of the Commission was to establish the legitimate participation of the President in administrative reorganization. Prior to this time, the only Presidential Commission to look at issues of administrative efficiency and effectiveness for the government in its entirety was the Keep Commission, the results of which were ignored by Congress. It should be further recognized that Congress reacted to the Keep Commission by cutting off the funding for any such presidentially created commission in the future. By getting approval from Congress first, the President established a process for participating and guiding administrative reorganization efforts.Mansfield, H.C., 1970. Reorganizing the Federal Executive Branch: The Limits of Institutionalization. Law and Contemporary Problems 35:461‚Äì95. The second major legacy is the national budget, which was established by the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921. The federal executive budget, then as now, remains in tension with Congress's appropriation and budgeting procedures. For many years after the Budget and Accounting Act, the executive grew in its power to shape and control the budget of the United States.Schick, A, 1966. The road to PPB: The stages of budget reform. Public Administration Review 26:243‚Äì58. It was only after the passage of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 that Congress began wresting back some control over the budgetary process. The budgetary process, first envisioned by the Commission on Economy and Efficiency, is constrained by the Constitution so that only the House of Representatives can tax the people. The idea of federal budgeting is important but complex and still contested.

The city was of strategic importance due to its close proximity to the capital of Tripoli. After Zliten, only two cities ‚Äì Khoms and Tajura ‚Äì separated the rebel stronghold of Misrata from Tripoli. Background Zliten rose against Gaddafi during the initial onset of the rebellion in February 2011, but the city was soon retaken by pro-Gaddafi loyalists. It was initially used as a staging point for loyalist attacks on rebel-held Misrata. According to a report by the United Nations refugee agency, men had been kidnapped from Misrata during the battle for the city, and taken to governmental camps in Zliten, before being forced to pledge allegiance to the government and fight on the pro-Gaddafi side. By early May, the rebel Free Libyan Army had expelled pro-Gaddafi forces from Misrata, pushing by 9 May to the village of Dafniya, 20 kilometers east of Zliten. The frontline remained relatively static for the next month, with rumors of discontent and rebellion in Zliten persisting. According to the rebels, they are training and equipping fighters from Zliten, so that the city may liberate themselves. Rebels also claimed that NATO had been holding them back, preventing the frontline from advancing. On 15 May, a rebel spokesman claimed that the anti-Gaddafi forces from Misrata had coordinated efforts with Zliten revolutionaries, and defeated Gaddafi forces, but this claim was later found to be untrue. On 1 June, a rebel spokesman claimed that Gaddafi had begun arming criminals in Zliten, in an effort to keep the city under his control. This claim was denied by the Libyan government. Uprising By 9 June, heavy fighting erupted in the city of Zliten, with the rebels suffering 22 fatalities by the next day. Pro-Gaddafi forces surrounded the city, armed with artillery and Grad rockets. According to rebels, the loyalist forces threatened to have the city's women raped by mercenaries, if it did not surrender. RAF airstrikes destroyed at least 4 loyalist MBTs outside the city. On 10 June, Libya State TV reported that government forces shot down a NATO helicopter near Zliten. NATO denied this. By 11 June, rebels controlled some parts of the town, but the city center was still firmly under the control of loyalist forces. On 14 June, NATO attack helicopters were deployed and subsequently destroyed two rigid-hull inflatable boats being operated by pro-Gaddafi forces threatening maritime traffic in the area. Shortly afterwards, the attack helicopters successfully struck an anti- aircraft heavy machine gun and three military vehicles hidden under trees in the vicinity of Zliten.http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/news_75418.htm The next day, Sheikh Khalifa Zuwawi, the chairman of the rebel council in Misrata, appealed to NATO to intervene in the city to save the uprising from certain annihilation by loyalist forces. Rebels within the city had been pinned down in a single district, and photographers who approached to around four miles outside the city photographed rockets being fired within the town. By 16 June, major fighting in Zliten had ceased. Reports suggested that the rebels were holding just a few pockets of the town near the center while the majority of the city was still in loyalist hands with government troops conducting sweeps and arresting people suspected of being involved with the opposition forces. On 17 June, rebels confirmed they had no intention of taking Zliten using forces from Misrata, but were rather aiming to support Zliten residents in taking up arms against Gaddafi's forces. On 15 July, tens of thousands of Gaddafi supporters, coming from the city and from other cities in buses, were seen on the main square of Zliten to protest against the international recognition of the rebel council.

He would later receive a doctorate from Lewis & Clark College in 1945. Oregon Superintendent of Public Instruction In 1937, Oregon Superintendent of Public Instruction Charles A. Howard resigned to become president of Eastern Oregon Normal School (now Eastern Oregon University), and governor Charles Martin appointed Putnam to replace Howard. In 1938, Putnam was elected to a full term as a Democrat. In 1942, the position was changed to non-partisan, and Putnam was re-elected five more times, each time unopposed. In his nearly 25 years as state school superintendent, Putnam was an active contributor to academic articles about education and an influential voice for Oregon schools among nationwide educational organizations. During his tenure, Oregon's educational system expanded to include vocational education programs, special needs and gifted education, programs for Native Americans, along with expanded curriculum and other programs. School funding issues were also a focus of Putnam's tenure. He resigned from office in early 1961 due to health concerns.

It flows into Lake Constance between Kressbronn am Bodensee and Langenargen as the third largest tributary to the lake. It is long; if one includes the Obere Argen and its source river Seelesgraben, the combined length is .  Course  The headwaters of the Argen arise in the Allg√§u. There are two headwaters: the Obere Argen and the Untere Argen. The two arms wrap around the Gro√üe Kreisstadt of Wangen im Allg√§u and meet each other in the Neuravensburg district of Wangen im Allg√§u. =Untere Argen = The origin of the Untere Argen is the confluence of B√∂rlasbach and Stixnerbach at the western entrance to Missen at about above sea level in the Allg√§u region of Bavaria. From the confluence, it first flows north to Isny im Allg√§u, then northwest to Waltershofen, then southwest to Primisweiler. Past Primisweiler, it merges with the Obere Argen. The main tributaries are the Wengener Argen and the Haslach. The Federal highway A96 crosses it a number of times. = Obere Argen = The Obere Argen originates in a marshy area north-west of Oberstaufen in the Allg√§u. It initially flows through the Eistobel gorge, then underneath the Argentobelbr√ºcke, and past Gr√ºnenbach towards Wangen im Allg√§u. From there it flows on via Neuravensburg to Pflegelberg, where it is united with the Untere Argen. = Lower reaches = Lower reaches and mouth and between Kressbronn and Langenargen Geomorphologically, the Argen has cut a deep and wide valley into the landscape, leading to such place names as Gitzensteig. In some places, the valley is over a kilometre wide. The edges of the valley occasionally rise steeply up to , and the valley floor is at the level of Lake Constance. Further down its course, the river bed becomes increasingly broader. The river here flows past the villages of Laimnau, Apflau and Badh√ºtten. In the lower part of its course, the Argen was straightened out considerably. It no longer has oxbow lakes because of the intensive valley agriculture. In recent years the massive concrete walls alongside the river have been replaced with large boulders in most of the shallower zones. Near the estuary at Kressbronn, gravel is mined in larger quantities, creating new lakes along the river.  Ruins  The ruins of several castles and palaces flank the lower reaches of the Argen: Altsummerau, Neusummerau, the late medieval Gie√üen Castle at Kreisbrunn, Achberg Castle and Neuravensburg Castle. Remains of an ancient hill fort can be found in the woods above the river. = Mouth = The mouth into Lake Constance is flanked on both sides by small harbours for pleasure boats. On the left is a camping grounds name Gohren. There is another camping grounds with restaurant at Laimnau. At its mouth, the Argen is wide. To prevent flooding, several protective walls have been constructed along the river. Kayaking is possible; bathing facilities are available.

On February 27, President Davis wrote a letter to Abraham Lincoln, President-elect of the United States, introducing the commissioners as representatives of the government of the Confederate States.

On March 15, the commission filed a memorandum which outlined how they had been ignored by Seward and Lincoln.

The album features Dethklok members Gene Hoglan and Bryan Beller, on drums and bass, respectively. Small described the album as a \\"high-stakes, intergalactic, extreme rock album\\" and describes it as being similar to Dethklok but with more rock elements and melodic vocals. Like on previous Dethklok albums, Ulrich Wild produced the album and Antonio Canobbio designed the cover art. The album's release coincided with the premiere of the fourth season of Metalocalypse. The album was also released on vinyl in late June 2012. Production The writing process started when Brendon Small had the studio lined up and Gene Hoglan and Bryan Beller ready to begin work on the second Dethklok album, but the legal negotiations were at a standstill. So in the meantime he decided to write a solo album since he and the band were ready but had nothing to record. The song \\"Dangertits\\" is an instrumental which Small says is a tribute to shredder guitarists like Steve Vai, Yngwie Malmsteen and Steve Morse. =Concept= Small stated that the album was written to act as an \\"audio comic book,\\" in chronological order. The album follows a super hero who has just gone through a \\"very messy, public, intergalactic divorce,\\" but his ex-wife gets kidnapped, so he attempts to rescue her only to find out that she is dating the antagonist. =Story= The album is about a superhero called Triton. At the start of the story, he receives his divorce papers from his ex-wife and takes an angry drive through space to try and cool off (\\"Triton\\"). Triton then goes to a therapist, a Lazer Witch, to see what his next step in life should be. As it so happens, the Lazer Witch is also a soothsayer. During their sessions, the Lazer Witch foresees danger and warns Triton not to attempt to save his ex-wife if she gets in trouble (\\"Prophecy of the Lazer Witch\\"). Meanwhile, Triton's arch enemy, Beastblade, escapes from prison and swears revenge on Triton (\\"Beastblade\\"). Beastblade seduces Triton's ex-wife and has sex with her (\\"Deathwaltz\\"). Triton finds out about their get-together and knows that she is in danger and contemplates whether or not to save her (\\"Truth Orb and the Kill Pool\\"). He ultimately decides to save her, but gets kidnapped by Space Pirates as he tries to reach her. Triton is taken to a planet where a corrupt government runs gladiatorial games. There, he and the other slaves are forced to fight a giant worm. Meanwhile, his ex-wife realizes that she is in danger as Beastblade reveals that he plans to kill her and then Triton (\\"You Can't Run Away\\"). Triton unites his fellow slaves in the arena and defeats the giant worm. They then turn against their masters and the crowd (\\"Arena War of the Immortal Masters\\"). A large space battle ensues as Triton destroys the Space Pirates and the government that ran the arena games. Afterward, Triton rushes to save his ex-wife (\\"Dangertits\\"). Triton has his final confrontation with Beastblade and kills him. Saving his ex-wife one last time, Triton and his ex-wife part ways (\\"On My Way\\"). Release and background Upon release the album was available for purchase exclusively on Brendon Small's website, and later as a digital download on iTunes and Amazon. The album sold poorly in the first week of sales, selling only about 1,206 copies. There was no tour to support the album and was only played live once (in its entirety) at \\"WesFest\\" 8 on March 3, 2013 in West Hollywood, California. =Adaption= The story of the album is being adapted into a six-part comic book series set for release in August 2017. The comics will be written by Brendon Small and Eric Powell. Sequel On May 16, 2016, Brendon Small teased the follow up to Galaktikon on his Twitter which was followed by an announcement later on that day. The album was released on August 25, 2017. Reception Under The Gun Review gave the album an 8 out of 10.

He graduated from North Iowa Area Community College (NIACC) in 1979, A.A. degree, and from the University of Northern Iowa (UNI) in 1981, B.A. History. He received his teaching credentials. After working on his Master's in American History, he entered The University of Iowa College of Law in 1983 and graduated in 1986 (with Distinction).https://alumnius.net/university_of_iowa_c-8231-year-1983-1986# Career Savas practiced law in Silicon Valley for twelve years before turning his focus full-time to his true love of publishing and writing. In 1990, he and David A. Woodbury co-founded the Civil War publishing house of Savas Woodbury Publishers, which became Savas Publishing in 1995. Woodbury and Savas founded the well-received quarterly journal Civil War Regiments and Savas later added Journal of the Indian Wars. In 2000, Savas Publishing was sold into a merger deal with Combined Publishing of Conshohocken, PA, and Perseus Books Group of Boston and NY. From 1992 until 2009, as an adjunct lecturer Savas taught legal, historical, political, and business-related college classes in the Bay Area and Sacramento region. He speaks around the country concerning the Civil War and publishing/writing subjects. Savas and the late New York-based attorney Russell H.

Savas turned the maps and information over to a Fredericksburg-based preservation organization. This, in turn, prompted increased interest in both the battle and the battlefield, and eventually led to the land being preserved and interpreted.

Savas and Newell also received permission from author Barbee Carleton to turn her cult-favorite young adult novel Mystery of the Witches' Bridge into a screenplay, which they recently completed. Both screenplays are being read in Hollywood and elsewhere. In addition to writing numerous articles on a variety of historical topics and penning a regular column for a local newspaper, Savas has written, edited, or co-authored a dozen books (published in seven languages), and has ghostwritten nearly two-dozen more.

In the weeks following the Willard Straight Takeover of April 19, 1969, pressure grew for Cornell President James A. Perkins to resign. Ramin came to the fore as he handled the Cornell Fund through the crisis. Six weeks after Willard Straight Hall was the site of a student protest garnering national attention, Ramin‚Äôs fundraising was twenty-three percent (23%) ahead of the 1968 campaign.Peter Kihss, Perkins Picks Up Faculty Supporters at Cornell, N.Y Times (June 4, 1963). Early life Dick Ramin was the son of Richard and Florence Ramin. Dick started for his secondary school football team, the Williamsport High School Millionaires. In 1946, he was named lineman for the Pennsylvania All-State Team. While studying at Cornell, Ramin was a member of Sphinx Head and Delta Kappa Epsilon. After graduating from Cornell in 1951, Dick served in the U.S. Army for two years as a First Lieutenant.

University administrator Ramin joined the Cornell university administration in 1954. He served as Alumni Field Secretary. In 1956, he was promoted to Assistant Director of Admissions. Serving in admissions until 1959, he was then appointed Associate Director of Development. In 1964, he was appointed Cornell‚Äôs Director of Development during the peak of the university‚Äôs post-World War Two expansion under James A. Perkins. In this capacity, he was required to defend the university‚Äôs donor base through the awkward years following the Willard Straight Takeover. In 1970, Dick was asked to take on the collateral duty of Assistant Vice President for Public Affairs during the six years of periodic student protest which followed the Willard Straight incident. Speaking of Ramin‚Äôs accomplishments as Director of Development, President Dale Corson said, ‚Äúunder Dick Ramin‚Äôs guidance, Cornell‚Äôs record in fund-raising has been unsurpassed by any educational institution in the United States.‚ÄùDale Corson, Walter Lynn, James Maas, Cornell University Faculty Memorial Statement: Richard M.

Ramin excelled in fundraising to enhance of Cornell‚Äôs capital endowment. Under Ramin‚Äôs early leadership, the Cornell Centennial Campaign was successfully completed at $73.2 million in 1965. He then brought the 1980 Cornell Campaign to $250 million in donations. Ramin then spearheaded Cornell‚Äôs $1.25 billion Capital Campaign, begun in 1991 and successfully completed in 1995, just before his death. ‚ÄúCornell never had a more devoted alumnus, nor I a more steadfast friend, than Dick Ramin,‚Äù said President Rhodes. ‚ÄúHe lived and breathed Cornell. He was a superb fund-raiser: his work will live on in the remarkable benefits that the present $1.25 billion campaign will contribute to the future strength of the university he loved so much.‚Äù .‚ÄùDale Corson, Walter Lynn, James Maas, Cornell University Faculty Memorial Statement: Richard M.

He was modest and unassuming about his accomplishments, which were many and substantial. He was never boastful, nor did he do anything with fanfare or to promote himself. He always praised and gave credit to others.‚Äù And as former Cornell president Dale Corson summarized, ‚Äú[Ramin] will be remembered fondly by those who worked for and with him, for his integrity, his kindness and compassion, his unswerving friendship, his gentle manner, the twinkle in his eye, and his pride in Cornell University and its potential.‚Äù Dale Corson, Walter Lynn, James Maas, Cornell University Faculty Memorial Statement: Richard M.

The State Armed Police Forces exist in addition to the ordinary police services of the various states. The various States have different titles for their armed police units. In addition to the general term \\"Armed Police\\", other titles in different states include Special Armed Police, Armed Constabulary, Provincial Armed Constabulary and State Military Police. Although the titles are different, their organisation, weapons, equipment and tasks are broadly the same. The central government of India now refers to these forces nationwide as the State Armed Police Forces and discourages use of the term \\"paramilitary\\". However, this terminology does not necessarily coincide with the existing terminology of the states of India; For example, the state of Bihar calls its state armed police force \\"Military Police\\", which clashes with central government definitions of \\"military\\" and \\"paramilitary\\". It is not yet clear whether such discrepancies will be resolved. The State Armed Police act as a mobile armed reserve activated only on the orders from the Additional Commissioner of Police or above. They are not usually in contact with the public except during public events, civil unrest, and natural disasters. They maintain key guard posts and participate in antiterrorist operations. Depending on the type of assignment, they may be or may not be carrying firearms. Within states, each police district may maintain its own teams of policemen with higher firearms competence. Such teams, known as \\"district armed police\\", are for purely local use and are not part of the State Armed Police Forces. Bihar Military Police The Bihar Military Police is the state armed police force for the Bihar Police with headquarters at Patna. It is frequently involved in clashes with Maoist rebels. The force has been expanded since 2006 to deal with the Maoist insurgency. It has 16 Battalions with approximately 1,000 personnel in each, from Bihar Military Police 1 to Bihar Military Police 16.

They were formed in 1946 as the Odisha Military Police, and the current name was adopted in 1980. There are currently 8 regular battalions and one reserve battalion. The headquarters of the SAP is at state Police Headquarters in Cuttack. The force is under the general control and direction of the Director General and the Inspector General of Police. The Odisha Military Police was formed on 1 March 1946 by the Odisha Military Police Act (Odisha Act VII of 1946). Soon after its creation this force had to handle serious situations in places like Bhadrak, Ib, Barang, Rampur, Cuttack etc. Due to strenuous nature of work of the military police and need for more personnel its strength was increased in 1947 and 1948. The strength was further increased with the formation of a Gurkha Military Police unit. On 1 March 1948, after a merging of 27 princely states into the Province of Odisha, there was a re-organisation of the police organisation and the 2nd Battalion of the Odisha Military police was established. This battalion had both Gurkha and Odia companies. While the battalion headquarters was at Dhenkanal, two detachments of this battalion were stationed at Nayagarh and Jharsuguda. Subsequently, other battalions were formed in different parts of the state. SOG (Special Operations Group) is the Special Forces element of the Odisha Police. The SOG was formed in August 2004 on the orders of the Government of Odisha Home office with the objective of neutralising any terrorist, insurgent, extremist or illegal armed groups operating in Odisha. The SOG originally had 462 regular active posts which by 2009 had grown to 1,370 personnel. It does not recruit personnel directly, instead personnel are drawn from various state police units and the assignments are based on tenures with a maximum period of 3 years. It also allows hiring of operatives from the armed forces, central paramilitary forces and police units of other states. Operatives receive training at a special school in Chandaka and also from the Indian army based in Jabalpur. The main role of the SOG is counter-insurgency operations but handling hostage situations and hijackings also come under its responsibility. It works closely with the Special Intelligence Wing of the Odisha Police. Punjab Armed Police The Punjab Armed Police is the state armed police wing of Punjab Police. PAP have their headquarters at Jalandhar in Punjab. This is where armed policemen of the Punjab are trained. Before the Border Security Force came into existence, PAP used to protect the most sensitive border of the country common with Pakistan. PAP Jawans have a number of international players in hockey, weight lifting, volleyball, kabaddi, etc. The campus is in a huge area and is complete in itself in the areas of housing, sports grounds, training equipment, halls, schools, hospital, swimming pool etc. The operational PAP units are: *7th Battalion, headquartered at PAP Jalandhar Cantt *9th Battalion, headquartered at PAP Amritsar *13th Battalion, headquartered at PAP Chandigarh *27th Battalion, headquartered at PAP Jalandhar Cantt *36th Battalion, headquartered at PAP Bahadurgarh, Patiala *75th Battalion, headquartered at PAP Jalandhar Cantt *80th Battalion, headquartered at PAP Jalandhar Cantt *82nd Battalion, headquartered at PAP Chandigarh Rajasthan Armed Constabulary The Rajasthan Armed Constabulary is the state armed police wing of Rajasthan Police in Rajasthan. Soon after the independence, the law and order situation along the newly formed 1070 km India-Pakistan border became a serious problem. Incursions and cattle lifting by Pakistani raiders was a regular feature and it became imperative to put an end to it. In 1949‚Äì50, the duty of guarding the border was assigned to the joint forces of the Central Reserve Police Force and the Provincial Armed Constabulary, which continued until 1952. In 1952, the Government of Rajasthan decided to raise a temporary special force that could not only be deployed along the border but also assist the civil police in combating the armed banditry known as \\"dacoity\\". The first headquarters and training centre was established at Bharatpur in 1952 and five battalions were raised from ex- soldiers, police and from other sources including outwith Rajasthan. Each battalion consisted of six mobile companies and one company remained at the battalion headquarters. These battalions were then dispatched to the border areas of Sriganganagar, Raisinghnagar, Barmer, and Jaisalmer. One unit was stationed at Ghat Gate, Jaipur to combat dacoity. Within a year of its inception, the RAC proved its worth both on the border and within the State by successfully carrying out its various duties. The members of RAC displayed gallantry and high sense of morale on occasions that required courage, perseverance, and devotion to duty. Its men battled against all odds, combating not only the enemy but also facing the rigours of the desert areas devoid even of the bare necessities of life. The RAC continued as a temporary force until 1958, there after it was made permanent. In 1962, two companies were drawn from each unit and the 6th Battalion was formed. From that year up to the late 1970s more battalions of RAC were raised as demanded by the situation. India saw two wars with Pakistan and one with China and there was unrest in Jammu and Kashmir, NEFA, as well as Mizoram. RAC battalions were dispatched to these sensitive areas and earned accolades for their courage and efficiency. Later, seven of these RAC battalions were merged into the Indian Border Security Force and two into the Central Reserve Police Force. The RAC has formed various specialist units along with its regular battalions. In 1998, a Special Task Force, along the lines of the Rapid Action Force of C.R.P.F., was formed to maintain peace in the sensitive districts of Rajasthan. These companies are trained and fully equipped to handle mass riots. The training imparted to the select RAC companies is decided as per requirements. There are 3 companies of RAC, which have drawn expert swimmers from various R.A.C. battalions and are being trained for flood relief work. There are currently fifteen battalions of RAC including one special battalion formed of only female Constables called the Hadi Rani Mahila Battalion and one further battalion of MBC held as the States para-military force. Out of the 14 regular battalions of RAC, 11 battalions are deployed in Rajasthan while 3 are deployed to Delhi. =All units= *First Battalion-Jodhpur *Second Battalion- Kota *Third Battalion-Bikaner *Fourth Battalion-Jaipur *Fifth Battalion-Jaipur *Sixth Battalion-Dholpur *Seventh Battalion-Bharatpur *Eighth Battalion-Delhi *Ninth Battalion-Tonk *Tenth Battalion-Bikaner *Eleventh Battalion-Delhi *Twelfth Battalion-Delhi *Thirteenth Battalion-Jail Security *Fourteenth Battalion-Bharatpur =Special battalions= *Hadi Rani Mahila Ballation-Ajmer *Mewar Bhil Corps-Khairwara *State Disaster Response Force-Nareli, Ajmer *Mewar Bhil Corps II-Banswara Uttar Pradesh Provincial Armed Constabulary In Uttar Pradesh, the Provincial Armed Constabulary or Pradeshik Armed Constabulary is an armed reserve maintained at key locations across state and active only on orders from the deputy inspector general and higher-level authorities.

West Bengal armed police forces The state of West Bengal has the most extensive armed police organisation and structure in the country. Unlike other states of India, the state of West Bengal has two separate police jurisdictions, that of the West Bengal Police, and that of the Kolkata Police Force. It therefore has two separate state armed police structures, one for each jurisdiction. Special forces of West Bengal are: *STRACO Force *Counter Insurgency Force *Commando Force =Eastern Frontier Rifles= The Eastern Frontier Rifles is one of the state armed police force for the West Bengal Police, the other being the West Bengal Armed Police. (i.e. as opposed to the police in Kolkata). History The Eastern Frontier Rifles were founded as the Frontier Protection Force by the East India Company at some point in the second half of the 18th century, and have had their current title since 1920. The Eastern Frontier Rifles fought in the Second World War, and, as the Bengal Military Police, in the First World War. *18th century: Founded as Frontier Protection Force. *1795: Renamed Ramgarh Local Battalion *1861: Renamed Frontier Guards *1891: Renamed Bengal Military Police, modernised, & given up-to-date weaponry (NB: An unrelated unit had previously used the same title) *1920: Reorganised and renamed Eastern Frontier Rifles *1947: The force was split between the Indian state of West Bengal, and Pakistan. The Pakistani part became the East Pakistan Rifles, which became the Bangladesh Rifles when Bangladesh became independent, and Border Guards Bangladesh in 2010. The West Bengal part retained its title of Eastern Frontier Rifles. Recent events Many contingents of the Eastern Frontier Rifles are kept deployed in various disturbed areas of the state. However, in recent years the force has used for day-to-day law and order duties. Their headquarters is at Salua, near Kharagpur. Like the armed police forces of many states, the Eastern Frontier Rifles are currently challenged with the Naxalite insurgency. In February 2010 an Eastern Frontier Rifles camp called Silda was attacked and burnt down by Maoist rebels, resulting in 24 riflemen killed out of a detachment of about fifty. This resulted in condemnation of the state government by the unit's Special Inspector General, Benoy Chakraborty, who claimed his force was \\"mis-used\\" and \\"ill-treated\\". Morale in the force is believed to be low.http://www.topnews.in/law/eastern- frontier-rifles-misused-illtreated-29023 =Kolkata Armed Police= The Kolkata Armed Police are West Bengal's state armed police force for operations in Kolkata.

Both boats are extensively equipped with SAR, First aid and towing equipment - e.g. both boats have radar, multiple slaved consoles with GPS/Radar/sounder, Radio Direction finders for VHF and 27Mhz, extensive radios, Forward Looking Infra Red camera for night searches, Defibrillators (AED), and back board. Both boats are manned by volunteers on weekends and public holidays, then during nights and weekends crews remain on call-out alert in shifts if required. Green 3 is also capable of working offshore in rough weather as a RIB. She is also useful in that for rapid response she only needs a crew of two to operate. This gives WVSR inshore, fast response inshore/offshore and large/long range offshore capabilities (30NM+). Broadly equivalent to 2-3 RNLI Stations as Green3 is essentially an Inshore lifeboat (similar to an Atlantic21) with Green2 and Green1 all weather boats. Radio The WVSRG HQ is located at Ocean Reef boat launch. It is both a meeting hall, training centre and radio tower. The radio tower is manned every weekend and when not manned operators monitor the radios remotely from other locations. The tower overlooks ocean reef boat launch and handles safety logging of boat traffic in and out of Mindarie Marina, Ocean Reef and Hilarys. The group has a high radio antennae and can consequently receive marine VHF from a relatively long distance. Notable Rescues The group carries out over 300 rescues per annum on average. Some notable callouts include : * Valentine's Day 2013 - Green 1 rescued a vessel on the rocks at little island (2 nm offshore from Hillarys, WA) at night in high winds. Water Police had grounded out and couldn't get in close enough and were discussing helicoptering the 4 men on board. The local knowledge of the WVSR skipper allowed him to get his boat in and tow the casualty off. *July 17, 2013 - A 73-year-old yachtsman got into trouble in heavy seas (7m) and high winds (force 11-12). Water Police cutter Cygnet V searched at sea with 2 experienced WVSR skippers on board as crew for local knowledge. WVSR Green1 and Fremantle VSR R100 were also called out and stood by as backup. WVSR also put out shore units which ultimately found the man. / News story from WA Today *September 25, 2014 - / 2 fishermen saved from water after their boat sunk * 28 August 2014 - / Recent incident where WVSR rescued several surfers in 5 m waves * 4 Nov 2014 - / 14-hour-long rescue of a yacht with a broken mast 90nm from base See also * Royal National Lifeboat Institution * Koninklijke Nederlandse Redding Maatschappij * Soci√©t√© Nationale de Sauvetage en Mer External links * Whitford's Volunteer Sea Rescue - Home Page References Coast guards Sea rescue organizations Organisations based in Perth, Western Australia Non-profit organisations based in Western Australia Sea rescue in Australia ","title":"Whitfords Volunteer Sea Rescue Group"},{"id":"32801896","text":"India competed at the 2011 World Championships in Athletics from August 27 to September 4 in Daegu, South Korea.

Biography Spilsbury was born at 68 Great Ormond Street, London, in 1776. She had a twin brother but he died at their birth. Her parents were Rebecca and Jonathan Spilsbury. Her younger brother was Jonathan Robert Henry Spilsbury, who was baptized on 7 December 1779 at St Marylebone, London. In 1789, her father moved the family to Ireland, working as a tutor for Mrs Sarah Tighe of Rossana, County Wicklow. They returned to London two years later, settling at 10 St. George's Row, Hyde Park. In addition to learning art from her father (who was a friend of contemporary luminaries such as Joshua Reynolds and Charles Wesley) Spilsbury was tutored in colored painting by Sir William Beecher and in music by Charles Wesley the Younger, who proclaimed her the best amateur organist in London. Despite never having had any formal training, Spilsbury first exhibited at the Royal Academy at the age of fifteen and continued to do so throughout her life. Her paintings were also shown at the British Institution, the British School, the Royal Academy, the Hibernian Society of Artists, and the Dublin Society. She excelled in portraiture, genre painting, and morality painting. Her work is characterized by a particular interest in evangelical religious themes. Contemporary accounts suggest that her studio on St. George's Row, London, was so popular that up to twenty carriages could be seen outside it on weekly private viewing days. Her patrons included the Prince Regent, George IV, who frequented her studio. In 1808 Spilsbury married John Taylor, a Protestant minister with a parish in Hampshire. She moved to Ireland with her husband in 1813, residing again with Mrs. Tighe in Dublin, where she remained active as a painter. Shortly thereafter, however, her sixth pregnancy resulted in a miscarriage and Spilsbury fell ill. She died in Dublin on 1 June 1820. Today, her paintings can be found in both private and public collections including those of the National Gallery of Ireland and the British Museum.

Clerke was a native of Bandon, Cork. Being intended for the army, a profession also adopted by his brothers, St. John Augustus Clerke, who died a lieutenant-general and colonel 75th Foot, 17 January 1870 and William Clerke, afterwards a major in the 77th Foot, he was sent to the Royal Military College, Great Marlow, where he distinguished himself by his abilities. He was appointed to an ensigncy without purchase in 1808 and as a subaltern in 28th and 5th Foot, he served through the Peninsular campaigns until the loss of his right leg in the combat at Redinha in 1811 incapacitated him for further active service. On the recommendation of Lord Wellington, he was promoted to a company in the 1st Garrison Battalion, with which served until its reduction in 1814. He afterwards served with the 2nd Battalion, 57th Foot, and on the army depot staff. He was promoted to a majority unattached in 1830. He became the editor of Colburn's United Service Magazine when that journal was started in January 1829, and so continued until July 1842. On the death of Colonel Gurwood, he was entrusted with the task of seeing the last volume of Selections from the Wellington Despatches through the press. He possessed a familiar acquaintance with the French, Italian, and Spanish languages, and, although his name does not appear as the author of any scientific or other works, was a very active member of the British Association and of various learned societies. At the time of his death he was a Knight of the Royal Hanoverian Order (1831), a Fellow of the Royal Society (elected 10 April 1833), and vice-president of the Royal United Service Institution, of which he had been one of the originators. He was also a fellow of the Royal Astronomical and Geological Societies and for a short time had been honorary foreign secretary of the Royal Geographical Society. He died of paralysis at his residence, Brompton Grove, London, on 19 April 1849.

The area was not highly valued until a railroad from Worcester, MA to Boston was extended to Albany through Mittineague creating opportunities for industrial development, primarily the manufacturing of paper. The mills and the Great Famine (Ireland) brought many Irish immigrants who developed Mittineague into a thriving village within West Springfield. . Between 1850 and 1860 the population of the town nearly doubled. The Agawam Paper Co., the Mittineague Paper Co., the Strathmore Paper Co., the Worthy Paper Co.and the Southworth Paper Co. were the most prominent of the mills found along the banks of Mittineague Falls.

Originally it provided two racquet courts, and an American bowling alley. Soon after this, a new dining room and a billiards room were added. In 1894 further alterations were made, including the conversion of the bowling alley into two fives courts, one for Eton Fives and the other for Rugby Fives. By 1900 the Rugby fives court was being used as a squash court. In 1913 a covered lawn tennis court was added. By 1936 all the courts were being used for squash. Residential accommodation was added at that time. The building was damaged during the Second World War, during which time the Club gave hospitality to officers of the Royal Navy. On 6 July 1981 the Club building was destroyed in the Toxteth riots. Following this, the Club bought the lease of Hargreaves Building in Chapel Street, and converted it for their purposes.

On the Gulf of Mannar near Silavaturai, the town shares a history with nearby Karaitivu Island, the ancient port town of Mannar and the Ketheeswaram temple. Kudiramalai is the northernmost point of Puttalam District and was a southern port of Mannar during the classical period, serving the northern kingdoms of the Jaffna Peninsula and Vanni country as one of their southernmost border towns. It is west of Vanni from Trincomalee, home of Koneswaram temple. Rulers included Alli Raani, Korran, his father (Pittan) and contemporaries, AthiyamƒÅn NedumƒÅn A√±ci and his son Kumanan.Kolappa Pillay Kanakasabhapathi Pillay. (1963). South India and Ceylon.

The port was known as Hippuros by the ancient Greeks, and was mentioned in Ptolemy's Periplus of the Erythraean Sea. Archaeological excavations have found that Kudiramalai was inhabited from the first century BCE to the seventh century CE. History =Classical period= Kudiramalai shares the legends of the Tamil queen Alli Raani with Mannar; during her rule, major changes to the western coastline occurred. According to legend, she often travelled from Kudiramalai to Mannar and traded Mannar pearls for horses from Arabia; this is how the port town acquired its name. Although the Gulf of Mannar inundated much of Kudiramalai in a cyclone or tsunami, a portion of the walls of Queen Alli's palace are still visible. An ancient, cave-like structure is at the upper part of the palace wall's entrance. According to Alexander Johnston, he had a history of Queen Alli (who ruled northwestern Sri Lanka 1,800 years before him).M. D. Raghavan (1971). Tamil culture in Ceylon: a general introduction.

The Evolution of an ethnic identity: The Tamils of Sri Lanka, p. 91 =Medieval period= By the medieval period, the capital moved from Kudiramalai to Nallur. Nearby Puttalam was the medieval Jaffna kingdom's second capital during the pearling season, and increased fishing activity was noted along the banks between Kudiramalai and Mannar. Mukkuvar Tamils began migrating from Kilakarai in mainland Tamilakkam to Kudiramalai and other Malabar cities (such as Puttalam and Jaffna) of the northern kingdom during the eighth century. The Shaivites fled to the west coast from mainland Tamilakkam to escape forced conversion to Islam. In return for aid from Arabs in a struggle with a rival chief, many embraced Islam. During the 16th-century increase in Portuguese influence, many of the Mukkuvars converted to Christianity.

It originated as the headquarters of the Brown Shipley Bank, continued as offices when the bank moved to London, was converted for use by the Liverpool Racquet Club after the Toxteth riots, and later became a hotel and restaurant. History The building is dated 1859, and was designed by the local architect Sir James Picton. It was designed for the banker Sir William Brown as his headquarters. The name Hargreaves was the surname of Brown's son-in-law who ran his Liverpool business. The building continued to be the headquarters of the Brown Shipley Bank until 1888, when it moved to London. It continued to be used as offices until the 1980s. Following the Toxteth riots of 1981, when their building in Upper Parliament Street was destroyed, the Liverpool Racquet Club were looking for new premises. At this time the lease for Hargreaves Building was available for sale, and the trustees of the Club negotiated a 150-year lease from Liverpool City Council. The building was converted for the Club, and it re-opened on 20 May 1985. It contained a dining room, bar, and lounge, a billiards room, two squash courts, a small swimming pool, a gym and changing facilities, and rooms for overnight accommodation. However, by 2001 the membership of the Club had declined and the lease was sold. It has since been converted into a hotel and restaurant named the Racquet Club Hotel and Ziba Restaurant. Architecture The building is constructed in ashlar, with a granite basement and a slate roof. It is in three storeys plus a basement. The architectural style is that of a Venetian palazzo, but employing Borromini's round-arched false-perspective window reveals of Palazzo Barberini, Rome. It has five bays facing Chapel Street, and seven bays facing Covent Garden. In the ground floor are round- headed windows flanked by paired columns. Between the heads of the double- light windows are roundels containing carvings of people involved with the exploration of the Americas. These include Christopher Columbus, Isabella I, Bermejo (a Spanish \\"adventurer\\"), Vespucci, Cortez, Queen Anacaona of Cuba, and Francisco Pizarro. In the second floor are smaller two-light windows under round arches, separated by Ionic colonettes. The top floor contains even smaller two-light windows under round arches between panelled pilasters. Along the top of the building is a frieze and a cornice. The building is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a Grade II listed building, having been designated on 12 July 1966.

Jan Drapentier seems to have come to England and worked as an engraver of portraits and frontispieces for the booksellers. These, which are of no very great merit, include portraits of William Hooper (1674), Sir James Dyer (1675), Richard Baxter, the Earl of Athlone, Viscount Dundee, Henry Sacheverell, the seven bishops, and others. He is probably identical with the Johannes Drapentier who by his wife, Dorothea Tucker, was father of a son Johannes, baptised at the Dutch Church, Austin Friars, on 7 October 1694. He was largely employed in engraving views of the country seats of the gentry, &c.;, in Hertfordshire for Henry Chauncy's Antiquities of Hertfordshire (published in 1700). Later in life he seems to have returned to Dordrecht, where a Jan Drapentier became engraver to the mint, and engraved several medals commemorative of the peace of Ryswick and other important events down to the treaty of Utrecht in 1713.

Many of the private homes and public buildings designed by Giles are on the National Register of Historic Places and have been designated Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks. Based in San Antonio, his buildings can be found predominantly in south Texas and northern Mexico. Giles is credited with \\"a profound influence on architecture in San Antonio.\\" Early life Alfred Giles was born May 23, 1853 near Hillingdon, Middlesex, England. His parents were Thomas and Sophie (Brown) Giles. From 1864 to 1868, he attended the Proprietary School at Gravesend, Kent with a goal of entering the ministry in the Church of England. Instead, he chose a career in architecture and apprenticed for two years to Giles and Bivens in London while taking architecture classes at King's College London. The firm hired him after the completion of his apprenticeship. In 1873, Giles moved to New York City. Move to Texas Giles moved to the drier climate of San Antonio, Texas, in 1875 for health reasons and spent the next three years working for building contractor John H. Kampmann. After that period, Giles began his own architectural firm, the Alfred Giles Company, which grew to become \\"the foremost practice in San Antonio.\\" =The courthouses= Goliad County Courthouse, built 1894. Prior to the current Bexar County Courthouse which was constructed in 1896 and designed by James Riely Gordon, the county had its offices in the Masonic Building. Giles was contracted in 1882 to remodel the county offices in that building. D. C. Anderson was the building contractor who did the work, which was completed in 1883. Alfred Giles added the Bandera County jail in 1881 to the already existing 1880 courthouse designed by B.F. Trester. The two buildings were added to the National Register of Historic Place in 1979 as Bandera County Courthouse and Jail. In Gillespie County, Giles designed the Romanesque Revival style 1882 Fredericksburg Memorial Library, originally as the county courthouse but now housing the Pioneer Memorial Library. The structure became a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1967, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. In Dimmit County, Giles had been selected in 1883 to design the first Dimmit County Courthouse to be located at 103 N. 5th Street in Carrizo Springs, Texas. The county changed its mind and hired J. C. Breeding & Sons. It is believed, however, that Breeding used plans drawn up by Giles, as the finished Italianate style building resembled others Giles had designed in the same time period. That structure was named a Recorded Texas Historic Marker in 2000. The Italianate style Wilson County Courthouse was designed by Giles and completed in 1884. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978, and became a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1984. Also in the Italianate style was the 1885 Llano County Courthouse Giles designed. That courthouse burned down in 1892 and was replaced. The Second Empire style Presidio County Courthouse in Marfa was designed by Giles in 1886. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. It was designated a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1964. In that same year, Giles was hired to design the 1886 Kerr County Courthouse. Contractor D.C. Anderson completed the building for $19,545. That particular courthouse burned down in 1925 and was replaced by the current standing structure. Three structures have existed as the Guadalupe County Courthouse, 1857, 1858, 1889 and the present structure built in 1935. Alfred Giles was the architect of Guadalupe County's 1889 Italianate style courthouse. In 1894, Giles designed the Second Empire style Goliad County courthouse. In 1976, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places as part of the larger Goliad County Courthouse Historic District. Giles submitted a winning bid to design the Beaux-Arts style Webb County Courthouse in 1909. The plans specified yellow brick with white stone and red tile mansard roofs. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1981. He also designed the 1909 facade added to the Kendall County Courthouse in Boerne. It was designated a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1970. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 The Classic revival style Brooks County Courthouse in Falfurrias was designed by Giles in 1914 and designated a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1977 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. The similar Classical Revival style Live Oak County Courthouse was designed by Giles in 1919. =Bexar County, San Antonio vicinity= In 1880, retired Confederate States Army surgeon Claudius King had Giles design his home. The Dr. Claudius E. R. King House, used as both home and office by the physician, became a Recorded Texas Historical Landmark in 1973. In 1881, Giles was contracted to design the house for the Commanding General at Fort Sam Houston. The first occupant of the home was Christopher Columbus Augur. Although the , two-story home has been occupied by dozens of base commanders in its history, it became known as the Pershing House after John J. Pershing occupied it in 1917. The Pershing House was put on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. The Emil Elmendorf House was designed by Giles in 1884 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. It became a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1982. Maverick-Carter house Giles designed more than 20 buildings for the Maverick family in San Antonio. In 1875, he designed the Albert Maverick Building. In 1877, Giles designed the Italianate style George Maverick House and the Maverick Hotel. In 1882, he designed the Crockett Block for the Maverick family. He also created the Maverick Bank Building. Bexar County realtor William Harvey Maverick contracted with Giles in 1883 to design the Romanesque style Maverick-Carter House, which appeared on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. That same year of 1883, Giles designed for the Maverick family, the Soledad Block, University Block and the George Maverick Storehouses. The Lambermont at 950 East Grayson in the Government Hill historical district of San Antonio, Texas, was designed and built by Giles in 1894 for San Antonio politician and United States diplomat Edwin H. Terrell. While serving as United States Ambassador to Belgium, Terrell became fascinated with European castles. Upon his return to Texas, Terrell had Giles design and build the sixteen-room, four-story castle. At the San Antonio Botanical Garden, the Daniel J. Sullivan Stable and Carriage House was designed by Giles in 1896. In 1971, the Hearst Corporation donated the house to the Witte Museum to make way for a parking lot. At a cost of $325,000 in 1988, the San Antonio Conservation Society had the house re-assembled at the botanical gardens. The house re-opened in 1995 at the entrance to the garden. Giles designed only one church, located at the intersection of Presa and Carolina Street in downtown San Antonio. Construction was completed in 1918 and it was originally a Congregational Church done in a Dutch style; it is currently known as St. Anthony the Great Orthodox Church. It was deemed an historic structure by the San Antonio Conservation Society in 1988. Most records of the church as a Giles building were lost in a fire, but the cornerstone of the building is proof of its origin. King William Historic District In San Antonio's King William neighborhood, the Gothic Revival style Carl Wilhelm August Groos House that Giles designed in 1880, was built for one of the founders of Groos National Bank. It became a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1977. The Edward Steves Homestead, which became a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1970, is believed to have been designed by Giles while he was an employee of John H. Kampmann. In 1881, Giles designed the Italianate style Sartor House for jeweler Alexander Sartor, Jr. The King William Historic District home became a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1983.

In 1881, he was paid $1,000 to design a new courthouse. The courthouse was completed in 1882. When a new courthouse was built in 1939, the old courthouse became the Fredericksburg Memorial Library and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. He designed the Morris Ranch Schoolhouse in Gillespie County in 1893. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 and designated a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1981.

Kampmann. The August Faltin Building was to accommodate Faltin's expanding general store business, and was designated a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1982.Kiel (2011) p.48 Local Comfort businessman Paul Ingenhuett contracted with Giles to design the original Ingenhuett-Faust Hotel at 818 High Street in 1880, and again contracted with Giles to expand the hotel in 1894. Louis and Matilda Faust operated the hotel from 1909 until 1946.Kiel (2011) p.37 The hotel was designated a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1985. Ingenhuett secured the architectural services of Giles for the 1883 Ingenhuett Store. The store was operated until 2006, when it was destroyed by fire.Kiel (2011) pp.33, 34 Paul Ingenhuett again hired Giles in 1891 to design the Ingenhuett-Karger Saloon at 727 High Street.. Hubert Ingenhuett operated the store until it was taken over by Ernst Karger. During the Prohibition years, the building was operated as a grocery store and ice cream parlor. It was designated a Recorded Texas Historical Landmark in 2010.Kiel (2011) p.35 The 1897 Paul Ingenhuett Home at 421 Eighth Street in the Comfort Historic District was also designed by Giles.

He served as a Member of Parliament for Lyme Regis in 1584, twice for Exeter in 1586 and 1588 and in 1592 for the City of London. He occupied the honourable position of Recorder of the City of London. Origins He was the eldest son of Thomas Drew (b. 1519), by his wife Eleanora Huckmore, a daughter and co-heiress of William Huckmore of Devon, and appears to have been born at the family seat of Sharpham, in the parish of Ashprington, near Totnes, Devon. Education He attended Exeter College, Oxford, as evidenced by an entry in the register of that university recording a payment in 1557 by a Mr. Martyn of 2 shillings for the expenses of Drew, a scholar of the college. He does not appear to have taken a degree, but proceeded to London and devoted himself to the study of the law, being admitted a student of the Inner Temple in November 1560, then probably of the usual age of eighteen. Career He obtained a lucrative practice both in London and in Devon, and rapidly attained high legal distinctions. He became a Master of the Bench of the Inner Temple in 1581, and Lent Reader in 1584; his shield of arms with this date still remains in Inner Temple Hall. In Michaelmas term 1589, together with seven other counsel, Drew was appointed Serjeant-at-Law. Two of his associates in the honour of the coif (John Glanville and Thomas Harris) were fellow Devonians, and Fuller in his Worthies of England records a popular saying about the three serjeants, that \\"One gained as much as the other two, one spent as much as the other two, one gave as much as the other two\\".Fuller, Worthies of England, 1811, i. 283 Drew seems to answer best to the first description as his success in pleading enabling him to purchase large estates in Combe Raleigh, Broadhembury, Broadclyst, in Devon and elsewhere. In 1586 he was co-trustee, with other eminent lawyers, of certain manors belonging to George Cary (c.1541‚Äì1616) of Cockington, Devonshire, Lord Deputy of Ireland. He was elected Member of Parliament for Lyme Regis in October 1584, and for Exeter in 1586 and again in November 1588; in 1592 he was appointed to the honourable position of Recorder of Exeter. On 17 June 1592 he succeeded Chief- Justice Edward Coke as Recorder of the City of London, and became MP for the City of London, a prestigious seat. In 1593 he made a fulsome speech to Queen Elizabeth I when presenting the newly elected Lord Mayor, Sir Cuthbert Buckell, for her majesty's approval, the text of which is preserved in Nichols's Progresses of Queen Elizabeth.John Nichols Progresses of Queen Elizabeth, vol. iii, p.228 On 27 March 1594 Drew resigned the Recordership, having been appointed Justice of Assizes and Gaol Delivery for Essex and Kent, and for his faithful services was presented by the City of London with \\"a basin and ewer of silver-gilt containing one hundred ounces\\". Later career, family and death Drew became Queen's Serjeant in 1596, and was much employed about this time by the Privy Council in the examination of political prisoners and in various legal references. The Devon historian Tristram Risdon (d.1640), writing some fifteen years after Drew's death, stated that his \\"knowledge and counsel won him a general love\\". His death on 22 April 1598 appears to have been sudden, and is ascribed by John Chamberlain, in a letter dated 4 May 1598, to gaol fever caught while riding the northern circuit with Mr. Justice Beaumont, who also died on the same day. His will was signed, probably in extremis, on 25 April 1598, and was proved in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury on 16 May 1598. Drew sold his paternal seat of Sharpham for ¬£2,250 and erected a mansion at Killerton in the parish of Broadclyst, Devon, on the site of monastic buildings. Here he lived, and was buried in the parish church of St John, in which a sumptuous monument remains in the south aisle, erected to his and his wife's memory in 1622, with a Latin inscription in prose and verse. Marriage and children He married Bridget FitzWilliam of Mablethorpe, Lincolnshire, by whom he had four sons and three daughters, all of whom survived him, including: *Thomas Drew (d.1651), eldest son and heir, knighted at the coronation of King Charles I, who moved the family's residence from Killerton to The Grange in the parish of Broadhembury, which remained long after the seat of the family.

He would therefore have been acquainted as a child with the Black Prince's son, the future king Richard II. Inheriting most of his mother's estates, he became an esquire by 1385 and by 1390 was a knight in the King's service. Subscription or UK public library membership required In 1395 he inherited his father's estates but remained living at Beaurepaire. He also inherited the hereditary office of Master of the Buckhounds. He seems to have acted as a feoffee for William Scrope, Earl of Wiltshire, one of Richard's principal ministers. He may not have been assiduous in attending court however, as surviving documents record him most often in Hampshire, where he was appointed a JP in 1396. In 1400, after Richard II had been deposed by Henry IV, he joined in a conspiracy known as the Epiphany Rising to kill Henry and restore Richard to the throne. The plot was foiled when details were leaked and the conspirators were chased westwards from Windsor Castle by an armed force. Brocas was captured in Cirencester and sent to the Tower of London, where he was tried for treason, with three others, by Thomas FitzAlan, 12th Earl of Arundel and on 4 February condemned to death. The following day he was forced to walk to Tyburn and was there executed, presumably by beheading. He was buried in the Franciscan church of Greyfriars, London. Family Some time before 1380 he married Joan (died 1429), who was the daughter of either Sir Thomas Midelton or Gilbert Banbury of Holybourne. They lived at Beaurepaire in the parish of Sherborne St John in Hampshire and had six children, including *the elder son William Brocas (c. 1379-1456), MP for Hampshire and High Sheriff of Hampshire, and * a younger son Bernard Brocas, (died c. 1431), MP for Hampshire *the eldest daughter Catherine Brocas, who married Sir Robert Delamare of Aldermaston. Although a convicted traitor's goods and lands were forfeit to the Crown, Henry IV was not vindictive to the family. Ten days after the execution, he let the widow Joan have her husband's goods and later that year the lands yielding an annual income of 300 pounds were granted to the elder son William. The executors of the will of Bernard Brocas, knight, were: Mathew de Gurney, John Chitterne, John Marnham, John Bridbrok, and Theobald Wykham Plea Rolls of the Court of Common Pleas; CP 40/561; year: 1401; http://aalt.law.uh.edu/AALT2/H4/CP40no561/aCP40no561fronts/IMG_0975.htm; 8th entry, starting Mathew de Gurney; his widow appears in the subsequent entry References External link *David Nash Ford's Royal Berkshire History (Nash Ford Publishing) Sir Bernard Brocas Junior (1363-1400) 1350s births 1400 deaths Executed people from Berkshire English landowners People from Windsor, Berkshire People from Basingstoke and Deane People executed under the Plantagenets by decapitation People executed for treason Medieval English knights Year of birth unknown Year of birth uncertain ","title":"Bernard Brocas (rebel)"},{"id":"32802533","text":"Majuwa is a village in Sankhar VDC, Ward No. 6, Syangja District, Gandaki Zone, Nepal.

In 1813 he made some vigorous speeches on the subject, overthrowing Grattan's contention in the House of Commons that the veto was approved in Ireland, and materially contributing to the temporary defeat of the Catholic Emancipation Bill. In the following year his speeches were published, together with an anonymous ‚ÄòVindication,‚Äô said by Mr. W. J. Fitzpatrick to have been written by Dr. Lanigan, who also, according to the same authority, was the real author of the speeches, though they were ‚Äòenunciated through the ponderous trombone of Dromgoole's nasal twang.‚Äô Sheil, describing Dromgoole's mode of emphasising the end of each sentence in his speeches by knocking loudly on the ground with a heavy stick, spoke of him as ‚Äòa kind of rhetorical paviour.‚Äô Dromgoole's ill-timed outspokenness brought a hornets' nest about his ears; he was satirised by Dr. Brennan under the name of ‚ÄòDr. Drumsnuffle,‚Äô and was at last driven into exile, ending his days at Rome under the shadow of the Vatican. He probably died between 1824 and 1829.

Many have argued that the provision of tax-funded services or transfer payments reduces the incentive for workers to seek employment, thereby reducing the need to work, reducing the rewards of work and exacerbating poverty. On the other hand, socialists typically criticize the welfare state as championed by social democrats as an attempt to legitimize and strengthen the capitalist economy system which conflicts with the socialist goal of replacing capitalism with a socialist economic system.  Conservative criticism  Great Depression In his 1912 book The Servile State, Anglo-French poet and social critic Hilaire Belloc, a devout Roman Catholic, argued that capitalism was inherently unstable, but that attempts to amend its defects through ever-more burdensome regulation could only lead to the rise of what he calls the \\"Servile State\\". According to Belloc, this servile state resembles ancient slavery in its reliance on positive law as opposed to custom or economic necessity by themselves. Austrian-born economist Friedrich Hayek mentions Belloc's Servile State favorably in his book The Road to Serfdom.Hayek, Friedrich (1944) [2007]. The Road to Serfdom. (London: University of Chicago Press. p. 67. Along with others such as G. K. Chesterton and Eric Gill, Belloc advocated abolishing profit-making banking in favor of credit unions and replacing capitalism with a system they called distributism which they believed would preserve private property and revive the dignity of work exemplified by the small craftsmen and property holder of the Middle Ages. Some conservatives in the United Kingdom such as James Batholomew and Theodore Dalrymple claim that the welfare state has produced a generation of dependents who prefer to remain on assistance and make no real effort to find employment, even though assistance is officially only available to those unable to work or who are temporarily unable to find work. The welfare state in the United Kingdom was created to provide certain people with a basic level of benefits in order to alleviate poverty, but these conservatives believe that it has fostered irresponsible and immature attitudes in many of its recipients. Some British conservatives such as Conservative Party co-chairman Sayeeda Warsi also criticize the \\"'something for nothing' culture\\" of the welfare state, claiming that the high extent of the welfare state \\"discourages the unemployed from finding jobs\\".\\"Labour's 'something for nothing' culture must end\\". 55% of people in England and 43% of people in Scotland believe that \\"benefits for unemployed people are too high and discourage them from finding jobs\\".\\"British Social Attitudes Survey\\". . According to political scientist Alan Ryan, \\"[m]odern conservatives argue that liberalism promises a degree of personal fulfillment that the welfare state cannot deliver and that attempts to deliver it will inevitably lead to disillusionment\\". Additionally, citizens' resentment of paying taxes to create benefits for others creates \\"hostility between more and less favored groups that is wholly at odds with what modern liberals desire\\".Ryan, Alan (2012). The Making of Modern Liberalism. Princeton and Oxford University Presses. p. 26. Ryan also argued: > Moreover, the welfare state must employ an extensive bureaucracy whose > members are granted discretionary powers and charged by law to use those > powers for the welfare of their clients. This means that classical liberals' > concern for the rule of law and the curtailing of arbitrary discretion is > ignored: bureaucrats are given resources to disburse to their clients.

Bradford. > \\"American Conservative's Crisis of Ideas\\". Certain American libertarians criticize the welfare state because welfare programs do not work to reduce poverty, improve education, or improve health or retirement. According to them, welfare programs also increase out-of- wedlock births and decrease the incentive to work. Moreover, they believe welfare programs reduce freedom by reducing the opportunity of individuals to manage their own lives.  Socialist criticism  A Swedish Sami boy getting oats and beans from the government's food relief program Critiques of the welfare state and of social welfare programs have come from various socialists perspectives, ranging from Marxists to anarchists. In these perspectives, criticism of the welfare state often goes alongside criticism of the structural issues of capitalism and the inability for social welfare measures to solve fundamental economic issues which Marxists consider inherent to the capitalist mode of production. Initially, social insurance schemes were promoted by liberals and conservatives to appeal to working class voters to undercut the appeal of socialism. While some socialist parties tolerated social insurance, socialists often viewed advocacy of such programs as antithetical to their goal of replacing capitalism with socialism. Marxian socialists argue that modern social democratic welfare policies are unable to solve the fundamental and structural issues of capitalism such as cyclical fluctuations, exploitation and alienation. Accordingly, social democratic programs intended to ameliorate the issues of capitalism‚Äîsuch as unemployment benefits and taxation on profits‚Äîcreate further contradictions in capitalism by limiting the efficiency of the capitalist system by reducing incentives for capitalists to invest in further production. As a result, the welfare state only serves to legitimize and prolong the exploitative and contradiction-laden system of capitalism to society's detriment.Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists, by Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel; Ollman, Bertell. 1998. pp. 60‚Äì61. \\"The Marxist answers that [...] it involves limiting the incentive system of the market through providing minimum wages, high levels of unemployment insurance, reducing the size of the reserve army of labour, taxing profits, and taxing the wealthy. As a result, capitalists will have little incentive to invest and the workers will have little incentive to work. Capitalism works because, as Marx remarked, it is a system of economic force (coercion).\\" Democratic socialists such as the American philosopher and mathematician David Schweickart contrast social democracy with democratic socialism by defining the former as an attempt to strengthen the welfare state and the latter as a political movement seeking to create an alternative to capitalism. According to Schweickart, the democratic socialist critique of social democracy is that capitalism can never be sufficiently \\"humanized\\" and any attempt to suppress the economic contradictions of capitalism would only cause them to emerge elsewhere. For example, attempts to reduce unemployment too much would result in inflation while too much job security would erode labor discipline. As socialists, democratic socialists aim to create an alternative to capitalism.Schweickart, David (2006). \\"Democratic Socialism\\". . Encyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice. \\"Social democrats supported and tried to strengthen the basic institutions of the welfare state‚Äîpensions for all, public health care, public education, unemployment insurance. They supported and tried to strengthen the labor movement. The latter, as socialists, argued that capitalism could never be sufficiently humanized, and that trying to suppress the economic contradictions in one area would only see them emerge in a different guise elsewhere. (E.g., if you push unemployment too low, you'll get inflation; if job security is too strong, labor discipline breaks down; etc.)\\" In contrast to social democracy, democratic socialists advocate a post-capitalist economic system based either on market socialism combined with worker self-management, or on some form of participatory- economic planning.Schweickart, David (2006). \\"Democratic Socialism\\". . Encyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice. \\"Virtually all (democratic) socialists have distanced themselves from the economic model long synonymous with 'socialism,' i.e. the Soviet model of a non-market, centrally-planned economy. [...] Some have endorsed the concept of 'market socialism,' a post- capitalist economy that retains market competition, but socializes the means of production, and, in some versions, extends democracy to the workplace. Some hold out for a non-market, participatory economy. All democratic socialists agree on the need for a democratic alternative to capitalism.\\" Market socialism is also critical of and contrasted with social democratic welfare states. While one common goal of both systems is to achieve greater social and economic equality, market socialism does so by changes in enterprise ownership and management whereas social democracy attempts to do so by government- imposed taxes and subsidies on privately owned enterprises to finance welfare programs. Franklin Delano Roosevelt III and David Belkin criticize social democracy for maintaining a property-owning capitalist class which has an active interest in reversing social democratic welfare policies and a disproportionate amount of power as a class to influence governmental policy. Karl Marx famously critiqued the basic institutions of the welfare state in his Address of the Central Committee to the Communist League by warning against the programs advanced by liberal democrats. While Marx proclaimed that the communists had to support the bourgeoisie wherever it acted as a revolutionary, progressive class because \\"bourgeois liberties had first to be conquered and then criticised\\", he specifically argued that measures designed to increase wages, improve working conditions and provide welfare payments would be used to dissuade the working class away from socialism and the revolutionary consciousness he believed was necessary to achieve a socialist economy and would therefore be a threat to genuine structural changes to society by making the conditions of workers in capitalism more tolerable through welfare schemes.Marx, Karl (1850). \\"Address of the Central Committee to the Communist League\\". Retrieved January 5, 2013 from Marxists.org. \\"However, the democratic petty bourgeois want better wages and security for the workers, and hope to achieve this by an extension of state employment and by welfare measures; in short, they hope to bribe the workers with a more or less disguised form of alms and to break their revolutionary strength by temporarily rendering their situation tolerable.\\" Eduard Bernstein, a reformist social democrat, was skeptical of the welfare state and social welfare legislation. While Bernstein viewed it as something helpful for the working class, he feared that state aid to the poor might sanction a new form of pauperism. Ultimately, Bernstein believed that any such policies should be of secondary concern to the main social democratic concern of tackling capitalism as the source of poverty and inequality.Jackson, Ben. \\"social democracy.\\" The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics. Second Edition. Eds. Steven N. Durlauf and Lawrence E. Blume. Palgrave Macmillan, 2008. The most extreme criticism of states and governments is made by anarchists, who advocate for the abolition of all social hierarchies, including the state. Despite the anti-state and anti-market views of social anarchism, most anarchists ultimately advocate for the strengthening of the welfare state, arguing that social safety nets are short-term goals for the working class. According to Noam Chomsky, \\"social democrats and anarchists always agreed, fairly generally, on so-called 'welfare state measures'\\" and \\"[a]narchists propose other measures to deal with these problems, without recourse to state authority\\". Some anarchists believe in stopping welfare programs only if it means abolishing both government and capitalism.\\"J.5 What alternative social organisations do anarchists create?\\".

Plot In this third of the Borrowers series, the Clock family begins living in the house of a human boy named Tom. The borrowers find that they will starve because Tom and his uncle are moving away. They need to leave but Tom's pet weasel or ferret is outside the door. Luckily, the animal still has the bell that Tom put on it, but they know they cannot outrun such a swift animal. Just when things are looking grim, Spiller returns via a secret passage: he has come through the drains underneath the house. Spiller says that he has not told the rest of the borrowers about the drains because they never asked. While deciding where to go, Spiller tells them that they might go to Little Fordham which is actually a replica village. The place has been a bit of a legend with all Borrowers: a whole village made for Borrower size residents with plenty of food from the visiting big people. Spiller lets them stay in one of his hide out places, a tea kettle, while he goes and investigates the matter for them. During the waiting period, the rain comes down and causes the kettle to be put adrift downstream. The Clocks decide that their best chances are to hope that Spiller will realize what has happened and find them. For the most part there aren't many frightening adventures, but they lose the kettle some time after it gets stuck in some trash.

Biography Druitt, the son of a medical practitioner at Wimborne, Dorset, was born in December 1814. After four years' pupillage with Mr. Charles Mayo, surgeon to the Winchester Hospital, he entered in 1834 as a medical student at King's College and the Middlesex Hospital in London. He became L.S.A. in 1836, and M.R.C.S. in 1837, and settled in general practice in Bruton Street, Berkeley Square. In 1839 he published the Surgeon's Vade- Mecum, for which he is best known. Written in a very clear and simple style, it became a great favourite with students, and the production of successive editions occupied much of the author's time. The eleventh edition appeared in 1878, and in all more than forty thousand copies were sold. It was reprinted in America, and translated into several European languages. In 1845 Druitt became F.R.C.S. by examination, and in 1874 F.R.C.P., later receiving the Lambeth degree of M.D. He practised successfully for many years, and also engaged in much literary work, having for ten years (1862‚Äì72) edited the Medical Times and Gazette. He was an earnest advocate of improved sanitation, and from 1856 to 1867 was one of the medical officers of health for St. George's, Hanover Square. From 1864 to 1872 he was president of the Metropolitan Association of Medical Officers of Health, before which he delivered numerous valuable addresses. In 1872 his health broke down, and he for some time lived in Madras, whence he wrote some interesting \\"Letters from Madras\\" to the Medical Times and Gazette. On his retirement 370 medical men and other friends presented him with a cheque for 1,215l. in a silver cup, \\"in evidence of their sympathy with him in a prolonged illness, induced by years of generous and unwearied labours in the cause of humanity, and as a proof of their appreciation of the services rendered by him as an author and sanitary reformer to both the public and the profession.\\" After an exhausting illness he died at Kensington on 15 May 1883. In 1845 he had married a Miss Hopkinson, who with three sons and four daughters survived him. Druitt was a man of wide culture, being well versed in languages, as well as in science and theology. Church music was one of his special studies, and as early as 1845 he wrote a Popular Tract on Church Music. Besides his principal work, Druitt wrote a small work on Cheap Wines, their use in Diet and Medicine, which appeared first in the Medical Times and Gazette in 1863 and 1864, and was twice reprinted in an enlarged form in 1865 and 1873. In 1872 he contributed an important article on \\"Inflammation\\" to Cooper's Dictionary of Practical Surgery.

The wasp can attack a wide variety of pine species, although some species seem to be more susceptible than others, and stressed trees often are attacked. During oviposition, the female wasp lays two eggs with or without a mucoid substance and a symbiotic fungus for the larvae to feed on once they hatch. The mucoid substance is toxic to trees and aids in tree decline. The ascospores from the symbiotic fungus, Amylostereum areolatum, are also pathogenic.

They closely resemble other larvae in the genus Sirex.Uwe Sedlag: Insekten Mitteleuropas. dtv, 1986. , pp. 244‚Äì245.  Native and introduced range  thumbright350pxHabitat of the Sirex woodwasp The native habitat of the sirex woodwasp is the temperate Palearctic realm, ranging from Maghreb over Europe, Siberia, and Mongolia, to the Kamchatka Peninsula. They live in deep pine-rich forests. The species has reached other continents, such as Australia, South Africa and North America, through the export of timber and firewood. While invasion was prevented in North America for a long time, the sirex woodwasp established itself in New Zealand around 1900. There, it contributed to massive pine declines in the first half of the 20th century, spreading to Tasmania in the 1950s and then to the Australian mainland. Since 1980, it has reached pine plantations in Uruguay, and later also Argentina, Brazil and Chile; it was found in South Africa in 1994. The population increased in the Great Lakes area from 2004 on; the species had reached Vermont, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Michigan by 2009.Jamie Perrie: Sirex noctilio Positive Counties per Year. USDA/APHIS/PPQ, 20 October 2009. The wasps can swarm between 20 and 50 km (12 and 31 mi), and has been estimated to take until about 2050 to spread to the far southeast of the USA at the current spreading rate.Chalkley, D.

Retrieved on 1 March 2010.Economic Analysis of the Potential Impact of Sirex noctilio, with Emphasis on Pines in the Southeastern United States. USDA Forest Service, Arlington 2006. Subsequently, forestry authorities intensified their pest control methods and additionally started education campaigns, such as warning not to transport firewood over large distances or to store it too long. Through wood export, the wasp could spread to East Asia, West Australia and parts of Africa. Remote locations, such as the Horn of Africa, may be spared from the sirex woodwasp, providing the area is controlled. The Invasive Species Specialist Group (ISSG) of the IUCN has graded the wasp as heavily invasive.Sirex noctilio in the Global Invasive Species Database of the IUCN. www.issg.org, 23 November 2009. Retrieved on 22 August 2010.  Ecology  = Phenology = The flight time of the adults or imagines begins in the late summer to early autumn, but the date depends on the region and climate. The males hatch out earlier than females and create swarms which gather around the treetops. The females seek out leks and couple with the males on the uppermost shoots. Then the females search for suitable host trees, if possible choosing weak and dry wood. They orient on monoterpene hydrocarbon compounds, which weakened trees produce. When a tree is stressed through dryness or exterior injuries, the compounds pervade osmotic barriers and escape from the bark. The female alights on the bark to drills several holes through the wood to the xylem to place one egg in each. At the same time, she inserts spores of Amylostereum areolatum and a phytotoxic secretion. The holes branch out into several tubes, which lead away radially. The eggs are white, sausage-shaped, and by in size. Small females may lay 20 eggs, while the largest can lay up to 500. Sometimes, eggs are not placed in every tube. In the last tube, the female injects only the secretion and the fungal spores. The females often die after just three or four days, sometimes even during oviposition (egg-laying), through overexertion.Proposed Program for Management of the Woodwasp Sirex noctilio Fabricus (Hymenoptera: Siricidae). United States Department of Agriculture, 2007.Eichhorn, O. Siricoidea. In: Wolfgang Schwenke: Die Forstsch√§dlinge Europas. Band 4: Hautfl√ºgler und Zweifl√ºgler. Hamburg 1982. , p. 215. = Development of larvae = Larvae of sirex woodwasp develop through arrhenotoky: male larvae develop only from unfertilized eggs, the females only from fertilized ones. Usually, 10 males are produced per female, but the ratio varies between 20:1 and 1:1. The larvae hatch after eight days at the earliest, but in some exterior conditions, they may remain in the egg for several months. At the optimal temperature of around 25 ¬∞C (77 ¬∞F), they hatch out after 10 to 12 days. Although the larvae hatch at 30 ¬∞C (86 ¬∞F) two to three days earlier, they are 20% more likely to die. Such extreme temperatures result in slower development, and below 6.2 ¬∞C (43 ¬∞F), the larvae die. A sufficient interspersion of the wood with the mycelium of the woodwasp is crucial for its hatching, as the fungus prevents the wood from drying out. Without these prerequisites, hatching is not possible. The tree can only ward off the infestation if it floods the boreholes with resin or halts the fungus by producing a wall of polyphenols. Sirex woodwasp in the hatch hole Six to twelve larval stages occur. During the first two stages, the larvae live off surrounding fungal tissue, until they reach the inner wood. Up to the fourth stage, they eat through the final summer wood along the tracheids, and finally towards the heartwood. After the seventh stage, they usually reach their maximum size. While penetrating further, they normally turn either up or down, but they turn back if they meet a foreign borehole, encounter bubbles of resin, or dry out. The larvae only live off the fungal mycelium, which they digest through a secretion. They pupate several centimetres under the bark. Before this, female larvae sequester a secretion containing fungal oidia, which adult females incorporate in their mycetangia above their ovipositors. The adults eat through the bark, but, depending on the weather, they remain in the hatch hole for up to three weeks before they leave the wood in warm and sunny weather.Morgan 1968, p. 242. The period from hatching to pupation lasts 10 days to two years, exceptionally up to six years. Climate is a major factor, because development is slower in colder regions. = Symbiosis = The wasp's host spectrum in North America includes the endangered Pinus palustris The sirex woodwasp and Amylostereum areolatum have a mutualistic symbiotic relationship. The sirex woodwasp is, together with Sirex juvencus and S. nitobei from eastern Asia, one of three symbionts of the fungus that in the first instance benefits from its vector function. Additionally, the wasp creates the optimal conditions for the infestation through the fungus by drilling into the underlying wood layers and weakening the host tree. The fungus has adapted to this process in the course of evolution and only rarely creates fruit bodies.Hudson, Harry J.: Fungal Biology. CUP Archive, 1992. , pp. 248‚Äì252. Conversely, the woodwasp is fully dependent on the symbionts. Decomposition enables the larvae to unlock the wood by producing white rot. The mycetangia of this and other wasps from the family Siricidae support a close relationship with saprobiontic fungi. Without the process of decomposition of the host tree and weakening of the infested tree, the development of larvae is arrested. If the tree can recover from the consequences of the wasp secretion, it blocks the boreholes with resin, thus killing the larvae. = Host spectrum = The sirex woodwasp only attacks conifers, especially pines. In its usual habitat, these are mainly Pinus sylvestris, Pinus pinaster and Pinus nigra. In the Southern Hemisphere and in North America, the wasp attacks exotic and domestic pine species, generally in plantations. Examples include Pinus radiata and Pinus taeda in the United States. Unlike any other species of Siricidae, the sirex woodwasp can damage relatively healthy trees so heavily, they die back. However, the wasp mainly infests weakened trees; only when the population is high does the insect also attack intact and healthy trees. Because the wasp larvae and the fungus need living wood, the sirex woodwasp does not infest dry or dead timber. However, wasps may hatch from processed wood which was already infested. By the spring of 2011, S. noctilio had been found in Michigan, Pennsylvania, New York, and Vermont. Pines in North America that have been attacked or confirmed as hosts are: Scots (Pinus sylvestris), Monterey (P. radiata), loblolly (P. taeda), slash (P. elliottii), shortleaf (P. echinata), ponderosa (P. ponderosa), lodgepole (P. contorta), and jack (P. banksiana) (Haugen 1999).Haugen, D.A. (1999) Sirex noctilio. Pest Reports ‚Äì EXFOR Database . Retrieved on November 25, 2012 = Symptoms of infestation = Brown coloration and shedding needles Borehole of a larva Infestation damage can be divided into four categories or phases, depending on whether it is caused by the imago, fungus, larvae or secondary parasites. The first reaction of the host tree is due to the adult wasp and occurs after 10 to 14 days. A phytotoxic secretion of the wasp impairs metabolism in the shoots and needles, causing loss of water balance. The result is brown coloration of the needles and leaf drop. As with many other wood pests, fine resin drops in wasp boreholes are found in the central trunk.Photograph of an infested tree. Forestry Images. Retrieved on November 24, 2012. Attacked pines tend to develop flagging. Tip dieback begins with the needles becoming chlorotic and changing from green to yellowish-red, finally turning completely brown over a three- to six-month period. The wasp bores 1/8- to 3/8-inch-diameter holes in the tree. Unstressed trees may be attacked uniformly along the main stem, while trees with low osmotic phloem pressure are preferentially attacked, with denser clusters of boreholes. During this process, fungal spores germinate in the boreholes, a reaction caused by the dryness of the tree, creating an appropriate environment and an entry for air. The fungus breaks down the lignin, causing white rot. It moves towards the vertically aligned xylem. The vertical profile shows reddish and white streaks which run in the direction of growth. In the third stage, the larva begins to bore into the wood. By doing this, it eats a path, which at first proceeds towards the trunk centre, before turning and running back to the bark. The paths are not visible in cross-section, because they are heavily blocked with sawdust; they may also be unobserved during wood processing. The lengths of the paths vary, depending on the wood, between in diameter, which depends on the size of the larvae. The exit holes are circular and of very small diameter. Stressing of the host tree and visible larval boreholes appear in the fourth stage. The infestation is reinforced by further insects or fungi, which in turn may cause more symptoms. Imago, fungus, and larvae together can cause tree death in a period ranging from two weeks to eight months.Taylor, K. L. The Sirex Woodwasp: Ecology and Control of an Introduced Forest Insect.

Berryman: Dynamics of Forest Insect Populations. Patterns, Causes, Implications. Washington State University, Pullman 1988. pp. 411‚Äì413. = Natural enemies and parasites = Rhyssa persuasoria specializes on the sirex woodwasp and its relatives. They lay their eggs on the wasp larvae. Birds are the primary natural enemies of the sirex woodwasp. The adults are frequently hunted by swallows (Hirundidae) and swifts (Apodidae), both of which prefer males. The black woodpecker (Dryocopius martius) and great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopus major) consume some larvae, but do not specialize on the sirex woodwasp. The white-throated needletail (Hirundapus caudacutus), an Australian bird species, often attacks the wasp. Several parasites have a larger impact on woodwasp populations. These include Ibalia leucospoides (Ibaliidae); Schletterius cinctipes, Megarhyssa nortoni (Ichneumonidae); and Rhyssa persuasoria. While I. leucospoides lay its eggs into the woodwasp's egg and the hatching period is therefore similar to its host's, the ichneumons mentioned lay their eggs on larvae or adult woodwasps; they hatch out later in the springtime. The parasites locate host larvae hidden in the wood using their antennae to detect cues, including the smell of leaking drill dust or fungus mycelium, weak vibrations, or differences in temperature. The majority of these insect hyperparasites feed on honeydew and nectar, both of which affect the woodwasps' sensitivity. Another parasite is the nematode Beddingia (Deladenus) siricidicola, which was suggested in the New World in the 1970s as a possible biological control. B. siricidicola causes infertility in female wasps, but does not impair the fertility of males. Inside the host tree, the nematodes primarily feed on fungal mycelium. If they get near the wasp larvae, they infect females, which then couple with males and finally infest the wasp larvae. These eventually exit the tree carrying the nematodes with them. Competition for food between B. siricidicola and the wasp larvae also occurs, resulting in slower growth and possible starvation of the woodwasp larvae. The population of the Sirex woodwasp is very prone to infestation by B. siricidicola; infestation rates of up to 90% have been recorded. The nematodes are often used to combat the wasps by combining them with the symbiosis partner Amylostereum. The related species B. wilsoni has a similar effect, but as it also lives parasitically with the genus Rhyssa, it is not used for pest control.  Management options  Several biological control agents have been employed to try to limit populations of the sirex woodwasp. B. siricidicola has been shown to infect up to 70% of the wasps, but delivery and inoculation have been an issue when delivering the organism to the tree. The introductions of parasitic wasps Megarhyssa nortoni nortoni, Rhyssa persuasoria persuasoria and Ibalia leucospoides leucospoides have been successful hyperparasites, but do not reduce wasp populations below 40% of the local population. Although some success in slowing the population growth of the wasp has been observed, these measures are not stopping the spread of the wasp. As a consequence of forest damage in Australia and New Zealand, wood imports to those countries have been required to be certified free from living sirex larvae.Unger, Achim; Schniewind, Arno P. and Unger, Wibke Conservation of Wood Artifacts: A Handbook. Springer, 2001. , p. 303. Treatment has also been attempted with bromomethane (CH3Br), through heat, or by removing the bark.Gemeine Holzwespe, Sirex juvencus, Riesen Holzwespe, Urocerus gigas, u.a. www.holzfragen.de, 2009.

Among the earliest mobile libraries in the UK, it was set up by the Warrington Mechanics' Institute in Cheshire, England in 1858. Keen to increase borrowing from its library, the institute determined in the summer of that year to raise money for the purchase of a one-horse van, which it planned to fill with books and send each week \\"to every door in Warrington and the vicinity\\". The idea was taken up enthusiastically by local residents, who organised a flower show and bazaar to raise funds. An October 1858 account in the Warrington Guardian reported that: The event raised ¬£250 (equivalent to ¬£ in ), allowing the perambulating library to begin touring the streets of Warrington on 15 November 1858. It was an immediate success, and resulted in the number of books borrowed from the institute's library increasing from 3000 a year to 12,000. The service continued until 1872.

Biography  Gondola traded cereals only and supplied Dubrovnik with cereals from Southern Italy and Sicily. Two consecutive rulers of the Kingdom of Naples, Alfonso and Ferdinand, granted Gondola with privileges to trade in cereals from Italy. Gondola was imprisoned for some time in 1423 by vojvoda Radosav Pavloviƒá. In 1425, when Eric of Pomerania, who ruled over the Kalmar Union of northern Europe, visited Dubrovnik on his way to Holy Land and again on returning to Denmark, he wanted to buy a Venetian merchantman galley (). Since Eric did not have enough money, Dubrovnik (the Republic of Ragusa) provided him with 2,000 ducats in credit, equipped the galley for him and armed its escort of 25 armed people, placed under Gondola's command. In 1433 the Republic of Ragusa sent Gondola and Andrija Bobaljeviƒá over to congratulate the Serbian Despot ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá because his daughter Mara had been betrothed to Sultan Murad II of the Ottoman Empire. They were also mandated to ask for his help in dealing with the sultan, Dubrovnik's overlord. Paladin was appointed, on August 4, 1434, as one of the supervisors of the works on water supply for Dubrovnik. He had by then also earned the trust of Ferdinand I of Naples, who engaged him to maintain a connection with Albanian warlord Skanderbeg. In 1458, the Republic of Ragusa sent Gondola and Paladin Lukariƒá to visit the Ottoman sultan in Skopje. He was assigned the sum of 1,500 ducats, the Ragusan haraƒç, and the sultan issued a charter with benefits for Ragusan merchants. Between 1470 and 1476, Despot ƒêuraƒë's daughter Kantakuzina Katarina Brankoviƒá repeatedly attempted to collect back the 500 ducats that Gondola owed her. She was supported in this effort by sultan Murad II and his wife Mara, but she was in the end unsuccessful. Another of Gondola's missions happened in 1472. At the time, Vlatko Hercegoviƒá, head of the Duchy of Saint Sava, was building a church in Herceg Novi with financial help from the Republic of Ragusa. Gondola was one of three Ragusan officials in charge for this project.  Family  Paladin, a member of Gondola family, was twice married. For a short while, he was married to Maria of the Caboga family. On November 25, 1458, he betrothed Mirussa of the Bona family. Annotations His full name was , shortened Paladino de Gondola. In .

Plot The Clock family (tiny human-like \\"Borrowers\\") live under the floorboards at the Driver‚ÄìHellman house, suspected but so far uncaught by Mrs Driver (Victoria Wood), grandmother of young James Hellman (Charlie Hiscock). Daughter Arrietty Clock (Aisling Loftus) is seen by James and they become friends, but his grandmother's suspicions are heightened. Lifting a floorboard, she finds missing items, including furniture from James' dead mother's dollhouse. Searching online for information on \\"little people\\", Mrs Driver befriends a London university Professor Mildeye (Stephen Fry) online. Unlike his skeptical colleagues, she asks more about his specialty, Homo sapiens redactus. He visits to learn more of Mrs Driver's sightings, but James tries to take the blame for all the 'borrowings.' Their secret home compromised, the Clocks escape via a drainpipe to the sewers, where Pod (Christopher Eccleston) berates his daughter. Her parents then take Arrietty to the disused City Road tube station, where there is a thriving urban community of little people she had known nothing of. She is nearly run over by Spiller (Robert Sheehan), a biker-type leader. Arrietty's mother Homily (Sharon Horgan) makes Spiller apologise, and after Pod hires Spiller with a gold coin ('borrowed' from Mrs Driver) to guide them to a new home, the youths become friendlier. Mildeye and his lab assistant Jenny (Anne Hirsch) set an array of traps for the Clocks in the sewers around the Hellman-Driver home. Arrietty triggers one, but her parents push her out of the way and are caught themselves. Despite her protestations, Spiller drags Arrietty away to safety at Pod's request. Mildeye takes the captured Clocks to his lab, but James deletes Mildeye's phone message to his grandmother about the capture. Mrs Driver berates James' father Robert (Shaun Dooley) for being away too much (though he is absent in order to seek work), but is concealing from him mounting arrears that may lose them their home. Anxious to rescue her parents, Arriety argues with and leaves Spiller, but he follows and saves her from a street cleaning vehicle, and they seek safety by hiding in a miniature nativity scene at a church. Spiller explains to her why Pod had exiled himself from other Borrowers - he had had to sacrifice his niece Eggletina to save the Borrower community, making him a reluctant hero. The two return to James' house to seek his help. Pod and Homily try to escape, but Mildeye catches them and learns they can talk. He prepares to present them to the world the next day at an academic conference, seen trailered by James on the nightly BBC news. With James' help, Spiller and Arrietty fly over the conference venue in James' new model plane, a Christmas gift from his returned father. They drop from parachutes, and climb through air vents and ducting to the lab. James distracts Mildeye and Jenny by telling them of more little people communities, and secretly puts a modified remote control car inside a vent duct to aid the Borrowers' escape. Mildeye gets back to the lab just too late to prevent the Clocks getting away, and chases them through corridors, lifts and stairways, but they reach James who runs from the reception area with his friends inside his rucksack. Meanwhile, Jenny tries to catch Spiller in the lab. All but Spiller safely at home watch the conference online: Mildeye's audience leave when he can only display a doll's jacket. When James closes the laptop, Spiller (who has sneaked in unseen) asks \\"Did you really think they'd catch me?\\" Arrietty finally admits she likes him, and the embarrassed Spiller claims he only wanted the gold coin. James picks up this rare coin that his Grandmother was asking about before, and sets it on the floor of his mum's bedroom for Mrs Driver to find. James and Robert sell the coin to raise money for their house and for Christmas. Robert is puzzled as to why all of the strawberry creams are missing from the chocolate tin that had been 'borrowed' from by Pod at the start of the film. At the celebration under the floorboards, Pod and Homily permit Arrietty freedom to leave. She chooses to return to the Borrower city with Spiller. After their farewells are said outside by the drainpipe and Arrietty promises to visit, the ending is a still of Arrietty shooting out of the pipe into the sewers in mid-air. In the post credits, Mrs Driver slips a strawberry cream chocolate down the borrower hole and whispers \\"Merry Christmas\\".

Developed in the early 20th century, zurag is characterised by the depiction of secular, nationalist themes in a traditional mineral-paint‚Äìon‚Äìcotton medium similar to Tibetan thangka. It is thus distinguished from both traditional Buddhist fine art and the socialist realism favoured during the Mongolian People's Republic. The style was pioneered in the aftermath of the 1921 Revolution by artists such as Balduugiin Sharav, whose One Day in Mongolia remains one of the most celebrated works of Mongolian art. Zurag paintings featuring scenes from everyday life, in both contemporary collective farm and traditional pastoral nomadic settings, became popular in the 1950s and 1960s in the wake of the success of √úrjingiin Yadams√ºren's The Old Fiddler. Historical depictions of the 1921 Revolution as well as earlier national figures were also popular, but overtly religious themes were discouraged by the state. Since the establishment of democracy in 1992 there has been a resurgence of interest in the style. Recent zurag paintings have featured nationalistic scenes drawn from the Secret History of the Mongols and the life of Genghis Khan, as well overtly religious imagery inspired by pre-Buddhist shamanism. They have also become more symbolic and less strictly representational. Throughout its history zurag has encompassed a diverse range of visual styles. Flat, brightly coloured shading in the Buddhist tradition is used alongside European-style realism and geometric perspective.

Few naturally dark areas remain on the land surface of the Earth. An urban park (Ibirapuera Park, Brazil) at night Ecological light pollution is the effect of artificial light on individual organisms and on the structure of ecosystems as a whole. The effect that artificial light has upon organisms is highly variable, and ranges from beneficial (e.g. increased ability for predator species to observe prey) to immediately fatal (e.g. moths that are attracted to incandescent lanterns and are killed by the heat). It is also possible for light at night to be both beneficial and damaging for a species. As an example, humans benefit from using indoor artificial light to extend the time available for work and play, but the light disrupts the human circadian rhythm, and the resulting stress is damaging to health. Through the various effects that light pollution has on individual species, the ecology of regions is affected. In the case where two species occupy an identical niche, the population frequency of each species may be changed by the introduction of artificial light if they are not equally affected by light at night. For example, some species of spiders avoid lit areas, while other species are happy to build their spider web directly on a lamp post. Since lamp posts attract many flying insects, the spiders that don't mind light gain an advantage over the spiders that avoid it, and consequently become more common. Changes in these species frequencies can then have knock-on effects, as the interactions between these species and others in the ecosystem are affected and food webs are altered. These ripple effects can eventually affect even diurnal plants and animals. As an example, changes in the activity of night active insects can change the survival rates of night blooming plants, which may provide food or shelter for diurnal animals. The introduction of artificial light at night is one of the most drastic anthropogenic changes to the Earth, comparable to toxic pollution, land use change, and climate change due to increases in the concentration of green house gases. Light pollution can even affect the animals and plants active during the day, as these diurnal wasps that are stealing the nocturnal insects caught in spiderwebs near street lamps demonstrate.  Natural light cycles  The introduction of artificial light disrupts several natural light cycles that arise from the movements of the Earth, Moon, and Sun, as well as from meteorological factors. = Diurnal (solar) cycle = The most obvious change in introducing light at night is the end of darkness in general. The day/night cycle is probably the most powerful environmental behavioral signal, as almost all animals can be categorized as nocturnal or diurnal. If a nocturnal animal is only active in extreme dark, it will be unable to live in lit areas. The most acute affects are directly next to streetlights and lit buildings, but the diffuse light of skyglow can extend out to hundreds of kilometers away from city centers. = Seasonal (solar) cycles = The axial tilt of the Earth results in seasons outside of the tropics. The change in the length of the day is the key signal for seasonal behavior (e.g. mating season) in non-tropical animals. The presence of light at night can result in \\"seasons out of time\\" , changing the behavior and thermoregulation of affected organisms. This effect can be deadly for small mammals in the winter, since when their body acts as if it's summer they don't maintain an adequate winter body temperature to survive winter nights. = Lunar cycles = The behavior of some animals (e.g. coyotes, bats, toads, insects) is keyed to the lunar cycle. Near city centers the level of skyglow often exceeds that of the full moon, so the presence of light at night can alter these behaviors, potentially reducing fitness. = Cloud coverage = In pristine areas, clouds blot out the stars and darken the night sky, resulting in the darkest possible nights. In urban and suburban areas, in contrast, clouds enhance the effect of skyglow, particularly for longer wavelengths. This means that the typical level of light is much higher near cities, but it also means that truly dark nights never occur in these areas. The impact of clouds on light levels in urban and suburban ecosystems is completely reversed from what occurs in pristine areas.  Effects of light pollution on individual organisms  = Insects = The attraction of insects to artificial light is one of the most well known examples of the effect of light at night on organisms. When insects are attracted to lamps they can be killed by exhaustion or contact with the lamp itself, and they are also vulnerable to predators like bats. Insects are affected differently by the varying wavelengths of light, and many species can see ultraviolet and infrared light that is invisible to humans. Because of variances in perception, moths are more attracted to broad spectrum white and bluish light sources than they are to the yellow light emitted by low pressure sodium-vapor lamps. Insects killed by attraction to a buried light box. The compound eye of moths results in fatal attraction to light. Dragonflies perceive horizontally polarized light as a sign of water. For this reason, sources of water are indistinguishable from asphalt roads with polarized light pollution to them. Dragonflies searching for water either to drink or in which to lay eggs often land on roads or other dark flat reflective surfaces such as cars and remain there until they die of dehydration and hyperthermia. Light pollution may hamper the mating rituals of fireflies, once they depend on their own light for courtship, resulting in decreased populations. Fireflies are charismatic (which is a rare quality amongst insects) and are easily spotted by nonexperts, providing thus good flagship species to attract public attention; good investigation models for the effects of light on nocturnal wildlife; and finally, due to their sensibility and rapid response to environmental changes, good bioindicators for artificial night lighting. =Birds= Lights on tall structures can disorient migrating birds. Estimates by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service of the number of birds killed after being attracted to tall towers range from 4 to 5 million per year to an order of magnitude higher. The Fatal Light Awareness Program (FLAP) works with building owners in Toronto, Canada and other cities to reduce mortality of birds by turning out lights during migration periods. memorial searchlights. Similar disorientation has also been noted for bird species migrating close to offshore production and drilling facilities. Studies carried out by Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij b.v. (NAM) and Shell have led to development and trial of new lighting technologies in the North Sea. In early 2007, the lights were installed on the Shell production platform L15. The experiment proved a great success since the number of birds circling the platform declined by 50-90%.[56] Juvenile seabirds may also be disoriented by lights as they leave their nests and fly out to sea. Brazil star trails and birds in light pollution photography in Rio beach at night Birds flying trace and star trail near rio de janeiro beach at night time in light pollution Birds migrate at night for several reasons. Save water from dehydration in hot day flying and part of the bird‚Äôs navigation system works with stars in some way. With city light outshining the night sky, birds (and also about mammals) no longer navigate by stars. Ceilometers (searchlights) can be particularly deadly traps for birds , as they become caught in the beam and risk exhaustion and collisions with other birds. In the worst recorded ceilometer kill-off, on October 7‚Äì8, 1954, 50,000 birds from 53 different species were killed at Warner Robins Air Force Base. = Humans = At the turn of the century it was discovered that human eyes contain a non- imaging photosensor that is the primary regulator of the human circadian rhythm. This photosensor is particularly affected by blue light, and when it observes light the pineal gland stops the secretion of melatonin. The presence of light at night in human dwellings (or for shift workers) makes going to sleep more difficult and reduces the overall level of melatonin in the bloodstream, and exposure to a low-level incandescent bulb for 39 minutes is sufficient to suppress melatonin levels to 50%. Because melatonin is a powerful anti-oxidant, it is hypothesized that this reduction can result in an increased risk of breast and prostate cancer. Other human health effects may include increased headache incidence, worker fatigue, medically defined stress, decrease in sexual function and increase in anxiety.Susan L.

Pijnenburg, M. Camps and G. Jongmans-Liedekerken, Looking closer at assimilation lighting, Venlo, GGD, Noord-Limburg (1991) Likewise, animal models have been studied demonstrating unavoidable light to produce adverse effect on mood and anxiety. = Turtles = Lights from seashore developments repel nesting Sea turtle mothers, and their hatchlings are fatally attracted to street and hotel lights rather than to the ocean. = Zooplankton = Zooplankton (e.g. Daphnia) exhibit diel vertical migration. That is, they actively change their vertical position inside of lakes throughout the day. In lakes with fish, the primary driver for their migration is light level, because small fish visually prey on them. The introduction of light through skyglow reduces the height to which they can ascend during the night. Because zooplankton feed on the phytoplankton that form algae, the decrease in their predation upon phytoplankton may increase the chance of algal blooms, which can kill off the lakes' plants and lower water quality.  Effects of different wavelengths  The effect that artificial light has upon organisms is wavelength dependent. While human beings cannot see ultraviolet light, it is often used by entomologists to attract insects. Generally speaking, blue light is more likely to be damaging to mammals because the non-imaging photoreceptors in mammalian eyes are most sensitive in the blue region. This means that if traditional vapor discharge streetlamps are replaced by white LEDs (which generally emit more of their radiation in the blue part of the spectrum), the ecological impact could be greater even if the total amount of radiated light is decreased.  Polarized light pollution  Light pollution is mostly unpolarized, and its addition to moonlight results in a decreased polarization signal. Artificial planar surfaces, such as glass windows or asphalt reflect highly polarized light. Many insects are attracted to polarized surfaces, because polarization is usually an indicator for water. This effect is called polarized light pollution, and although it is certainly a form of ecological photopollution, \\"ecological light pollution\\" usually refers to the impact of artificial light on organisms. In the night, the polarization of the moonlit sky is very strongly reduced in the presence of urban light pollution, because scattered urban light is not strongly polarized. Since polarized moonlight is believed to be used by many animals for navigation, this screening is another negative effect of light pollution on ecology.

Nasser's tenure as Egypt's leader heralded a new period of modernisation and socialist reform in Egypt and a staunch advocacy of pan-Arab nationalism (including a short-lived union with Syria) and developing world solidarity. His prestige in Egypt and throughout the Arab world soared in the wake of his nationalisation of the Suez Canal in 1956, and Egypt's political victory in the subsequent Tripartite Aggression, but was damaged badly by Israel's successful invasion and occupation of Egyptian and Arab territory in the Six-Day War of 1967. The era is regarded as a time where ordinary citizens enjoyed unprecedented access to housing, education, jobs, health services and nourishment as well as other forms of social welfare, while aristocratic influence waned.Liberating Nasser's legacy Al-Ahram Weekly. 4 November 2000. The national economy grew significantly through agrarian reform, major modernisation projects such as the Helwan steel works and the Aswan Dam and nationalisation schemes such as that of the Suez Canal. However, the substantial economic growth that marked the early 1960s took a downturn for the remainder of the decade, only recovering in 1970. During Nasser's time in office, Egypt experienced a golden age of culture, particularly in theater, film, poetry, television, radio, literature, fine arts, comedy and music. Egypt under Nasser dominated the Arab world in these fields, producing singers such as Abdel Halim Hafez, Umm Kulthum and Mohammed Abdel Wahab, literary figures such as Naguib Mahfouz and Tawfiq el-Hakim, actors like Faten Hamama and Rushdi Abaza and the release of over 100 films yearly, compared to the production of just more than a dozen annually during Hosni Mubarak's presidency (1981‚Äì2011).  Revolution of 1952  On 22‚Äì26 July 1952, the Free Officers, a group of disaffected officers in the Egyptian army founded by Gamal Abdel Nasser and headed by General Muhammad Naguib, initiated the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 which overthrew King Farouk, whom the military blamed for Egypt's poor performance in the 1948 war with Israel and lack of progress in fighting poverty, disease and illiteracy in Egypt.Egypt during the Sadat years, By Kirk J. Beattie, p.2 The monarchy of Egypt and Sudan was gone without \\"a voice\\" being \\"raised\\" in its favour. In the following two years, the Free Officers consolidated power. Popular expectations for immediate reforms led to the workers' riots in Kafr Dawar on 12 August 1952, which resulted in two death sentences. Following a brief experiment with civilian rule, the Free Officers abrogated the 1953 constitution and declared Egypt a republic on 18 June 1953, Muhammad Naguib as Egypt's first President. Within six months all civilian political parties were banned replaced by the \\"Liberation Rally\\" government party, the elites seeing a need for a \\"transitional authoritarianism\\" in light of Egypt's poverty, illiteracy and lack of a large middle class.Egypt during the Sadat years, By Kirk J. Beattie, p.4 = Suppression of the Muslim Brotherhood = In January, the large Muslim Brotherhood organization was outlawed, remaining an illegal political organization until the Revolution of 2011. The move came in the wake of clashes between members of the Brotherhood and Liberation Rally student demonstrators on 12 January 1954. On 26 October, an assassination attempt suspected by the Brotherhood was directed at Nasser during a rally in Alexandria. This led to the regime acting against the Brotherhood, executing Brotherhood leaders on 9 December. = Presidency of Nasser = Gamal Abdel- Nasser, first became the chairman of the RCC, then prime minister, and in November 1954 after President Naguib was dismissed from office and placed under house arrest. Nasser, however, would not become President of Egypt until 1956, until which time the office was vacant. = 1956 = Meanwhile, the RCC, morally backed by both the Soviet Union and the United States, managed to remain united in its opposition to the British and French, specifically in regard to the Suez. Despite continued calls from the RCC, in debates in the United Nations, and pressure from both the US and USSR, the British refused to transfer control of the Canal to the new regime. The RCC began funding and coordinating ever greater attacks on the British and French in the Suez and Damietta. Finally, on 19 October, Nasser signed a treaty for the evacuation of British troops from Egypt, to be completed over the following 20 months. Two years later, on 18 June 1956, Nasser raised the Egyptian flag over the Canal Zone, announcing the complete evacuation of British troops. = New Constitution = President Nasser announced a new Constitution on 16 January at a popular rally, setting up a presidential system of government in which the president has the power to appoint and dismiss ministers. An elections law was passed on 3 March granting women the right to vote for the first time in Egyptian history. Nasser was elected as the second president of the Republic on 23 June. In 1957, Nasser announced the formation of the National Union (Al- Ittihad Al-Qawmi), paving the way to July elections for the National Assembly, the first parliament since 1952.  Economy and society  = Land reform = fellah in a land distribution ceremony in Minya, 1954 The original revolutionaries wanted an end to British occupation but did not have a unified ideology or plan for Egypt. One issue that was agreed on and acted quickly on was land reform. Less than six percent of Egypt's population owned more than 65% of the land in Egypt, while at the top and less than 0.5% of Egyptians owned more than one-third of all fertile land.Dr. Assem Al-Desoky's Major Landowners in Egypt: 1914-1952 (in Arabic, Dar Al-Shorouk, Cairo, 2007. quoted in Egypt on the Brink by Tarek Osman, Yale University Press, 2010, p.45 the process of land reform began on September 11, 1952, when (among many provisions) a law prohibited ownership of more than 200 feddans of land (840000 sq meters); limited the rental rate for land; established cooperatives for farmers; minimum wages, etc. During the presidency of Nasser, cultivated land in Egypt increased by almost a third (an achievement that had reportedly eluded Egyptians for more than a millennium).Egypt on the Brink by Tarek Osman, Yale University Press, 2010, p.48 = Economy = Egypt's economy grew at an average rate of 9% per annum for almost a decade. The share of manufacturing to Egypt's GDP rose from around 14% in the late 1940s to 35% by the early 1970s. \\"The combination of the land-reform programme and the creation of the public sector in Egypt resulted in around 75% of Egypt's gross domestic product (GDP) being transferred from the hands of the country's rich either to the state or to millions of small owners. The closest parallel to such a large-scale social programme had been in the early days of Mohamed Ali Pasha's rule in the early nineteenth century.\\"Egypt on the Brink by Tarek Osman, Yale University Press, 2010, p.47 =Exile of Jews= In 1956‚Äì1957, 25,000 Jews ‚Äì almost half of the Jewish population of Egypt ‚Äì were expelled from the country. Another 1,000 were imprisoned. (By 1972 the remainder had also been expelled.)  Foreign affairs  Egypt's nationalisation of the British-owned Suez Canal was a great victory for Nasser who was celebrated as both an Egyptian hero and an Arab one, capable of \`defeating the nation's enemies\` and \`representing Arab dignity\`.\\"Egypt on the Brink by Tarek Osman, Yale University Press, 2010, p.49 Chinese premier Zhou Enlai called Nasser \`the giant of the Middle East.\`Egypt on the Brink by Tarek Osman, Yale University Press, 2010, p.50 Nasser emerged as one of the architects of the Non-Aligned Movement, which was founded in 1961 as a bloc of \`independent nations\` detached from both NATO and the Warsaw Pact. Almost all African anti- colonialist freedom fighters came to him for guidance, moral support and funds. =Opposition to Baghdad Pact= A major reason why conservative Arab regimes felt threatened by Nasser during his first years in power was because his popularity had been demonstrated ‚Äì even before the Suez crisis ‚Äì when he became a leading critic of the 1955 Baghdad Pact. The Baghdad Pact was initially an alliance between Iraq and Turkey, which Britain supported with the goal of strengthening its power within the Middle East. Nasser considered the Baghdad Pact to be part of a British effort to split the Arab countries into differing groups, and to divide the region by escalating tension between them. The British later attempted to bring Jordan into the Baghdad Pact in late 1955 after Nasser agreed to purchase arms from Czechoslovokia in the Soviet bloc. The British were determined to bring Jordan into the Baghdad Pact and to apply pressure to try and force Jordan to join. Nasser had opposed the Baghdad Pact, and his successful effort to prevent Jordan from joining the pact is an example of his pragmatic diplomatic strategy. Nasser's pragmatism towards Jordan meant that he aimed to force the Jordan regime to decline to join the pact, but he did not himself attempt to overthrow the regime. This stance was rewarded with Jordanian support for Egypt during the Suez Crisis the following year in 1956. The dispute over Jordanian membership in the Baghdad pact lasted from November to December 1955. Nasser's goal was based on Egyptian national interests ‚Äì he wanted to prevent Jordanian membership in the Baghdad Pact, which was more important to him than the fate of the Jordanian regime. He was thus prepared to offer the Jordanian regime a way out in which it could survive if it did not join the pact. Nasser's strategy during the debate over the Baghdad Pact was to apply rhetorical pressure using Egyptian propaganda to launch broadcasts attacking the British, and also warning the Jordanian regime that it could be overthrown if it agreed to join the pact. The Egyptian propaganda led to riots occurring in Jordan in December 1955 during a visit of British Field Marshal Templer, who was serving as the British Defense Chief of Staff. The nature of the message that Egyptian propaganda conveyed during the crisis over Jordanian accession to the Baghdad pact is very significant. Its primary focus was on attacking the British rather than the Jordanian regime itself, and it did not itself call for the overthrow of King Hussein. In other words, this propaganda was intended to pressure the regime, and likely to implicitly convince King Hussein that his prospects for remaining in power would be greater if he declined to join the Baghdad Pact, and Jordan decided in December that it would not join the agreement. King Hussein remained in power, and sided with Egypt in future crises such as in the 1956 Suez Crisis or in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Egypt thus derived a direct reward from their pragmatic approach towards King Hussein's regime, and the example of the dispute over the Baghdad Pact may have convinced King Hussein that he needed to align with Egypt in future crisis situations. The power of Arab Nationalism also led King Hussein to dismiss the British General John Bagot Glubb as commander of the Arab Legion in 1956. The dismissal of Glubb took place while the British Foreign Secretary was in Egypt, and the British believed that represented a direct challenge by Nasser to their authority in the region. = The Tripartite Aggression = Nasser returns to cheering crowds in Cairo after announcing the nationalization of the Background Egypt had been seeking loans from the World Bank since late 1955 to finance the construction of the Aswan High Dam. A tentative agreement with the World Bank, the US and Britain indicated that US$70 million would be provided for the project. However, Nasser had recently (September 27, 1955) negotiated an agreement with the Soviet Union which provided technical and military aid to the regime, thereby angering the United States which had up until the point been supportive of Nasser and his anti-British and anti-French colonialism. Consequently, after pressure from the British government concerning the threat posed by Nasser, on 20 July 1956, the US and Britain withdrew their offers of funding, and the World Bank went back on the agreement. On 26 July, Nasser gave a historic speech announcing the nationalisation of the Suez Canal Company, under his \\"Egyptionization\\" policy, and whose revenues would be used to finance the construction of the High Dam, which was completed in January 1968. The nationalisation escalated tension with Britain and France, which froze Egyptian assets and put their armies on alert. On 1 August, the USSR offered to fund the High Dam project. Relations with Britain and France which had deteriorated to a frosty cold war level by the summer, were framed anew when the United States withdrew much of its support in demonstration against Nasser's growing friendship with the Soviet Union. Having at last convinced the United States of its error in supporting the Free Officers Movement and the special threat posed by Nasser, the British and French felt free to intrigue for his overthrow. These moved culminated in the Tripartite Anglo-French-Israeli aggression on Egypt in October. Plan In a final replay of old European power politics, the British and French negotiated a plan with Israel which would result in the return of the Suez to the British and French, the overthrow of the Nasser regime, and restoration of European, Christian and Jewish property. Although the later had suffered under the new regime, unlike the Europeans, most Jewish property survived the Egyptianization. Consequently, Israel, which had previously been used as an interlocuteur for both Soviet and American support for the RCC still had substantial elements operating in Egypt. Now the British and French decided to use this to their advantage once Israel saw the large threat Nasser posed to their continued existence. Under their plan, Israeli elements in Egypt with launch false flag operations which would be used as a pretext for Israeli launching a surprise attack on Egypt across the Sinai and toward the Suez. Using the terms of the Canal treaty which allowed the British and French to use military force in protection of the canal, an Anglo-French force would invade the canal area and subsequently invade Cairo. Invasion Israeli troops invaded Gaza and advanced toward the Sinai on 29 October. Accordingly, under the terms of the Canal Treaty, the British and French troops attacked the Canal Zone on 31 October using a combined force of air strikes, naval bombardment, and parachute drops. Large amphibious and infantry units were steaming from Cyprus and Algeria toward the canal for the final occupation and push into Cairo. Whilst the operation had all the elements necessary for surprise and legerdemain, it lacked quickness of speed given the relative strategic weakness which the British and French found themselves in the post-war period. For although the British and French still had substantial force projection capabilities and were the overwhelming military power in the region, both countries were heavily dependent on American support for their economies through the purchase of British and French debt, American direct investment, and most importantly, through the support American oil companies provided for European consumption. Consequently, by the time when the Anglo-French armada began its reinforcement of British and French positions on the Canal, the American government had already come under massive pressure from the United Nations, the Soviet Union, and most importantly from American oil companies which saw the British and French as impediments to their commercial expansion in the Middle East. When the American anger at the British and French intervention was felt at Whitehall, the British government fractured between those who saw the futility of maintaining the British Empire, those who saw the potential threat the Americans posed to the overall British economy should they end financial support of the British economy, and those British interests which still saw a need, a necessity and a reason for maintaining the British Empire. Thus, when the Eisenhower Administration initiated an oil embargo on the British and French, there was immediate panic in the British government. The French however were proving more resolute and flouted American demands stating matter of factly that America had no interest in the Middle East and were duplicitous in their support of Arab nationalism and anti-colonialism. However, with the embargo, the British pound which as a reserve currency was used in the purchase of oil had its liquidity threatened. While the British government debated this turn of events, the military campaign dithered and proved lacklustre in its execution, thereby buying crucial time for the Nasser regime to rally support from American liberals, the Soviet Union, and others in the United Nations. Finally, when in a bid of solidarity with the Nasser regime, the US government said it would no longer price support the British pound through the purchasing of British debt, the appeasers within the British government gained the upper hand and forced a surrender to American demands. Consequently, British operations were halted on 7 November. When negotiations between the British and Americans made clear that the US was in opposition to the continuation of the British and French Empires, the British government's position on its control of the Suez Canal collapsed. Henceforth it was not military operations but the liquidation of what remained of British and French assets and prestige which allowed the Anglo-French armies to remain until finally, on 22 December they were removed. As a result, all British and French banks and companies, 15,000 establishments in all, were nationalized, a process that was later extended to all foreign establishments and also to Egyptian firms. But more importantly, the event marked the abandonment of by the United States to an overt Western Civilizational identity especially of supremacy, as well as America's opposition to a European global commercial presence which it viewed as a competitor to its own global vision. As a result, with the primary leader of the West opposed to the very raison d'√™tre of European colonialism, the Suez Crisis, initiated by the Free Officers Movement and the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 marked the end of European Civilization Supremacy. According to the prominent historian Abd aI-‚ÄôAzim Ramadan, Nasser decision to nationalize the Suez Canal was his alone, made without political or military consultation. The events leading up to the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, as other events during Nasser's rule, showed Nasser's inclination to solitary decision making. He considers Nasser to be far from a rational, responsible leader. = Union with Syria = right On 22 February 1958, Egypt united with Syria, creating the United Arab Republic (UAR). The 1956 Constitution was abrogated following the union and a provisional one decreed. The Egyptian National Assembly was dissolved. On 2 April, Nasser issued a decree establishing the flag of the Republic as three horizontal bars of red, white and black with two stars. There was a crackdown on communists on 31 December for their allegedly lukewarm response to the Union with Syria. Following Syrian secession in 1962, a Preparatory Committee of the National Congress of Popular Forces was convened in Cairo to prepare for a National Congress to lay down a Charter for National Action. The 1,750-member Congress of representatives from peasant, laborer, professional and occupational associations meets in May to debate the Draft National Charter presented by Nasser. On 30 June, the Congress approves the Charter, which sets up a new political organization, the Arab Socialist Union (ASU) to replace the National Union. 50 per cent of the seats in the ASU are to be filled by farmers and workers. Elected ASU units are set up in factories, firms, agricultural cooperatives, ministries and professional syndicates. = Yemen War = In 1962, Egypt became involved in the civil war in Yemen, supporting the revolutionary regime of Abdullah al-Sallal that had ousted the country's former ruler, Imam Badr, and declared a republic. This proved to be a considerable financial and military burden on Egypt and created antipathy toward Saudi Arabia, which supported the Yemeni loyalists. = 1967 War = Under Arab pressure and as a result of rising popular expectations of Arab military might, on 18 May 1967, Nasser asks UN Secretary General U Thant to withdraw the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) stationed on Egypt's side of the border with Israel in Sinai. Egypt closed the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping in retaliation for Israel's diversion of the River Jordan. King Hussein of Jordan visited Cairo on 30 May, signing a Jordanian-Egyptian defense pact. On 5 June, Israeli army forces dealt a crushing blow to Egypt. Seventeen Egyptian airfields were attacked, and most of the Egyptian air force destroyed on the ground leading to the Israeli occupation of the Sinai Peninsula. Jordan entered the war on Egypt's side, but was forced to accept a UN Security Council ceasefire on 7 June after Israel occupied the Jordanian- controlled territories of the West Bank and the Egyptian-controlled Gaza Strip. Egypt also accepted the ceasefire. Israeli troops attacked the strategic military installations in the Syrian Golan Heights, occupying the town of Quneitra. Syria accepted the ceasefire on 10 June. Egypt's defeat in the 1967 War compelled Nasser to resign on 9 June, naming Vice-President Zakaria Mohieddin as his successor. However, he relented following massive popular demonstrations of support. Seven high-ranking officers were tried in the wake of the defeat, including Minister of War Shams Badran. Commander-in- Chief of the armed forces Field-Marshal Abdel-Hakim Amer was arrested and is reported to have committed suicide while in custody in August.  Society  At the time of the fall of the Egyptian monarchy in the early 1950s, less than half a million Egyptians were considered upper class and rich, four million middle class and 17 million lower class and poor. Fewer than half of all primary-school-age children attended school, and most of them being boys. Nearly 75% of the population over ten years of age, and over 90% of all females were illiterate.Education, from Egypt: A Country Study. Helen Chapin Metz, ed. Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1990.] Nasser's policies changed this. Land reform, the major assets' confiscation programme, the dramatic growth in university education, the creation of a dominating public sector flattened the social curve. From academic year 1953-54 through 1965‚Äì66, overall public school enrollments more than doubled. Millions of previously poor Egyptians, through education and jobs in the public sector, joined the middle class. Doctors, engineers, teachers, lawyers, journalists, constituted the bulk of the swelling middle class in Egypt under Nasser.Egypt on the Brink by Tarek Osman, Yale University Press, 2010, p.120  See also  * Sadat era * Egyptian Revolution of 2011 * Egyptian Revolutionary Command Council * History of modern Egypt * List of modern conflicts in the Middle East  References  External links *Egyptian Revolution 25/01/11 *The Long Revolution *Egyptian Royalty by Ahmed S.

On 15 March, an explosion damaged the fourth floor rooftop area of the unit 4 reactor; the source of the explosion is still unknown, although it is speculated to be due to hydrogen generation in the spent fuel pool. Japan's nuclear safety agency NISA reported two large holes in a wall of the outer building of unit 4 after the explosion. It was reported that water in the spent fuel pool might be boiling. Radiation inside the unit 4 control room prevented workers from staying there permanently. Visual inspection of the spent fuel pool of reactor 4 on 30 April showed that there was no significant visible damage to the fuel rods in the pool. Reactors 5 and 6 were also shut down when the earthquake struck although, unlike reactor 4, they were still fueled. The reactors have been closely monitored, as cooling processes were not functioning well. Unit 4 Reactor Units 1 through 4 at the plant At the time of the earthquake, Unit 4 had been shut down for shroud replacement and refueling since 29 November 2010. All 548 fuel assemblies had been transferred in December 2010 from the reactor to the spent fuel pool on an upper floor of the reactor building where they were held in racks containing boron to damp down any nuclear reaction. The pool is used to store rods for some time after removal from the reactor and contains 1,331 rods. Recently active fuel rods produce more decay heat than older ones. At 4pm JST on Monday 14 March, water in the pool had reached a temperature of 84 ¬∞C compared to a normal value of 40‚Äì50 ¬∞C. The IAEA was advised that the temperature value remained 84 ¬∞C at 7pm JST on 15 March. The temperature in the pool remained relatively constant until 30 July, when a closed circuit cooling system was commissioned. On 11 April, a fire broke out at Unit 4. =Explosion= At approximately 6am JST on 15 March, an explosion damaged the 4th floor rooftop area of the Unit 4 reactor as well as part of the adjacent Unit 3. The explosion is thought to be caused by the ignition of hydrogen that had accumulated near the spent fuel pond, the hydrogen was initially thought to have come from the stored fuel rods, but later, TEPCO believed the hydrogen came from Unit 3. A hand-written summary of a conference call, taken by an aide to then-Nuclear Regulatory Commission chairman Gregory Jazcko, stated that fuel could have been ejected from the Unit 4 spent fuel pond during this explosion; this was later found to be in error. Later reports that the Unit 4 spent fuel pool had caught fire were found to be erroneous; later reports clarified that the fire did not involve the fuel pool. Current versions of the IAEA report do not mention a fire (as of 6/2014, the logs of the fuel transfer process from the Unit 4 spent fuel pool to the common fuel pool indicate steady progress with no fuel damage reported). As radiation levels rose, some of the employees still at the plant were evacuated. On the morning of 15 March, Secretary Edano announced that according to the TEPCO, radiation dose equivalent rates measured from the Unit 4 reached 100 mSv/h. Edano said there was no continued release of \\"high radiation\\". A Fukushima spent fuel pool in the year 1999 (the view is obstructed by the reflection of the loading crane on the water surface). Japan's nuclear safety agency NISA reported two holes, each 8 meters square, or 64 m2 (690 sq ft), in a wall of the outer building of Unit 4 after the explosion. At 5:48pm it was reported that water in the spent fuel pool might be boiling. By 9:13pm on 15 March, radiation inside the Unit 4 control room prevented workers from staying there permanently. Seventy staff remained at the plant, while 800 had been evacuated. By 10:30pm TEPCO was reportedly unable to pour water into the spent fuel pool. By 10:50pm the company was considering using helicopters to drop water, but this was postponed because of concerns over safety and effectiveness, and the use of high-pressure fire hoses was considered instead. A fire was discovered at 5:45am JST on 16 March in the northwest corner of the reactor building by a worker taking batteries to the central control room of Unit 4. This was reported to the authorities, but on further inspection at 6:15am no fire was found. Other reports stated that the fire was under control. At 11:57am, TEPCO released a photograph showing \\"a large portion of the building's outer wall has collapsed\\". Technicians considered spraying boric acid on the building from a helicopter. =Structural damage of reactor building no. 4= On 24 June 2012 TEPCO revealed that some exterior walls were slightly out of vertical in reactor building no.4, due to the hydrogen explosion in March 2011. Further investigations showed damage in various parts of the building structures at the west and south side. At the third floor a wall was found to be leaning 4.6 centimeters out of vertical. All deviations were within legal limits, and the walls were strong enough to withstand an earthquake. TEPCO noted that the building was safe, because these variations were all found in the outer walls, and the spent fuel pool was supported by pillars and other structures.JAIF (26 June 2012) Earthequake report 452: Tilted walls found at Fukushima No.4 reactor =Spent fuel pool= On 16 March, the chairman of United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Gregory Jaczko, said in Congressional testimony that the NRC believed all of the water in the spent fuel pool had boiled dry. Japanese nuclear authorities and TEPCO contradicted this report, but later in the day Jaczko stood by his claim, saying it had been confirmed by sources in Japan. At 1pm TEPCO said that helicopter observation indicated that the pool had not boiled off. The French Institut de Radioprotection et de S√ªret√© Nucl√©aire (IRSN) agreed, stating that helicopter crews diverted planned water dumps to Unit 3 on the basis of their visual inspection of Unit 4.Jonathan Weisman. \\"Did NRC's Jaczko misspeak?\\". The Wall Street Journal. 17 March 2011. At approximately 2:30pm on 16 March, TEPCO announced that the storage pool, located outside the Unit 4 containment area, might be boiling. Around 8pm JST, it was then planned to use a police water cannon to spray water on Unit 4. On 18 March, it was reported that water sprayed into the spent fuel pool was disappearing faster than evaporation could explain, suggesting leakage. SDF military trucks sprayed water onto the building to try to replenish the pool on 20 March. On 22 March, the Australian military flew in Bechtel-owned robotic equipment for remote spraying and viewing of the pool. The Australian reported this would give the first clear view of the pool in the \\"most dangerous\\" of the reactor buildings. The IAEA reported, \\"From 22 March to 25 March 130 to 150 tonnes of seawater were poured into the spent fuel pool each day using a concrete pump equipped with a long articulated arm. Seawater was also poured in through spent fuel cooling system from 9:05pm UTC 24 March to 01:20 25 March. White smoke was still being observed coming from the reactor building as of 11pm UTC 25 March.\\" On 29 March, the seawater was changed to fresh water. Cumulative amount of cooling water, 20 March to 28 May Analysis of spent fuel pool water collected on 12 April suggests that while some of the 1535 fuel assemblies stored there may have been damaged, the majority of the stored fuel assemblies are intact based on measured radiation levels. TEPCO further stated that \\"the fuel rods in the Unit 4 pool had released caesium-134 and ‚àí137 in the process of being damaged\\", and that TEPCO would \\"need to continue monitoring it\\".Radiation surges above 4's fuel poolThe Japan Times Online. Search.japantimes.co.jp (13 April 2011). Retrieved on 30 April 2011. On 13 April, TEPCO reported that the temperature of the spent fuel pool had increased to 90 ¬∞C, and that the radiation level 6 meters above the pool had reached 84 mSv/h. The spike was later attributed to a failure to properly keep the spent fuel pool covered in water.NTI: Global Security Newswire ‚Äì Japan plant emits more radiation after cooling lapse. Global Security Newswire (14 April 2011). Retrieved on 30 April 2011. As of 25 April, TEPCO was still pumping between 70 and 210 tons of water into the pool, varying the amounts depending on the temperature in the pool. TEPCO also reported that it was attempting to minimize the amount of water added to the pool for fear \\"the weight of the water could weaken the reactor building\\".Monitoring rising temperatures, NHK, 25 April 2011 On 28 April, TEPCO announced it believed that water was not leaking from the pool but only evaporating. TEPCO based its belief on calculations that the heat generated by the spent fuel stored in the pool would be expected to evaporate 140 to 210 tons of water daily, in line with the amount of replacement water it adds.TEPCO: Water isn't leaking from No. 4 reactor pool, NHK, 28 April 2011 On 9 May, TEPCO began work to install a supporting structure for the Unit 4 spent fuel pool, due to the concerns that explosions could have weakened the structure.Seismic Damage Information (the 132nd Release). On 11 June, it was discovered that the water level in the spent fuel pool was only one third of normal, and only part of the fuel rods were covered with water. This was probably the cause of the high radiation levels measured. This pool has also been used to dump equipment. On Sunday 19 June, the pool was refilled, to minimize the radiation and making it possible to work again at this place.NHK- world (20 June 2011)Spent Fuel Pool refilled On 21 June, the first stage of strengthening at the second floor in the building under the pool was finished: 32 steel columns 8 meters long with a weight of 40 tons each were placed at the second floor.NHK-world (21 June 2011) First stage strengthening of floor under spent fuel pool Reactor 4 finished By 30 July, the concreting of the supporting columns was completed. From 16 June, water injection to the spent fuel pool was switched from using the concrete pumping vehicle to an alternative water injection line. On 31 July, the spent fuel pool was switched from the water-injection cooling system, to a circulatory cooling system. On 31 January 2012, six liters of radioactive water (35.500 becquerels per liter) leaked from the spent fuel pool of reactor 4 onto the floor in the building from a broken pipe. The leakage was stopped after a valve was closed, and was thought to have been caused by the cold weather.The Mainichi Daily News (1 February 2012)Radioactive water leaking from inside Fukushima No. 4 reactor The next day (1 February 2012), TEPCO released an even higher figure: 8500 liters were leaked after a pipe was dropped off after the water inside had turned into ice. The leakage appeared to have started at around 5 p.m. on 31 January 2012. This water was contaminated with radioactive isotopes, because it was mixed with water that was in contact with the fuel rods from the spent- fuel pool. TEPCO made plans to check whether there were similar cases in the other damaged reactor buildings.The Mainichi Daily News (2 February 2012) TEPCO says 8.5 tons of water leaked from Fukushima No. 4 reactor On 30 June 2012 around 6:25 hours local time, an alarm went off, and the cooling system of the spent fuel pool halted. At that time, the temperature was 33.3 degrees Celsius; no leakage of radioactive contaminated water was reported. On 4 June, a similar situation caused the cooling to be halted.The Mainichi Shimbun (30 June 2012)Cooling system suspended at Fukushima nuke plant No. 4 reactor On 1 July shortly after 3 p.m. the cooling was resumed, the water temperature of the pool having risen to 42.9 ¬∞C. TEPCO had feared that the temperature could reach 65 ¬∞C, the upper limit designated in safety regulations. The cause of the troubles was laid in some parts of the emergency power system, and these were to be replaced.The Mainichi Shimbun (2 July 2012)TEPCO resumes cooling Fukushima Daiichi No. 4 reactor fuel pool On 18 March 2013 at 6:57 p.m., the cooling system for the spent fuel pools of the No. 1, 3 and 4 reactors stopped, after the electricity instantaneously went out at the plant's accident response center. TEPCO suspects that the problem was situated in one makeshift power switchboard controlling the cooling system. The injection of water into the Nos. 1, 2 and 3 reactors was not affected. According to TEPCO, restoring the cooling system of the spent fuel pool of reactor No. 4 had the \\"highest priority\\", because the number of fuel assemblies stored in that tank was larger than in the pools of unit 1, 2 and 3. On 19 March at 10 a.m., the temperatures ranged between 15.9 C and 30.5 C, and it would take about four days until the temperature of the water inside the No. 4 spent fuel pool reaches the upper safety limit of 65 C. TEPCO was prepared to inject water into the pool whenever needed in case the water warmed up and started to evaporate.The Mainichi Shimbun (19 March 2013) Fukushima nuclear plant's fuel pool cooling system still suspended On 19 March around 1:20 p.m., one of the two lines forming the cooling system of the No. 4 spent fuel pool was restored. Around 8 p.m. TEPCO was expecting to get the other line in operation. The cooling system of the No. 1 spent fuel pool was put back in action at 2:20 p.m.The Mainichi Shimbun (19 March 2013) Fukushima plant's spent fuel pool cooling system partially restored The power loss caused anxiety and questions among residents of the region. The news was communicated by the Nuclear Regulation Authority around three hours after the incident happened. On 22 March 2013, the evacuation zones were to be reclassified, and some residents would be allowed to make day trips to their homes. Some people thought that all was under control, and others with little children were afraid for yet another evacuation.The Mainichi Shimbun (19 March 2013)Fukushima residents irked by outage at crippled atomic plant Electricity went out simultaneously at nine facilities of the plant in total, a filter system to remove radioactive materials from cooling water for the reactors, and a cooling system for yet another pool were affected too. TEPCO admitted, that this was the first occasion that such a power failure happened at so critical facilities at the site since the plant was brought under control in December 2011. On 20 March before 1:00 a.m. all systems were online again. The cooling system of pool no. 4 was restored as last. TEPCO blamed a provisional power switchboard to be the cause of the troubles. According to TEPCO, this was the last remaining makeshift power switchboard at the plant, installed after the nuclear crisis. Criticism was there from the central and prefectural government, the late announcement three hours after the power loss had caused \\"significant anxiety\\" among local people. TEPCO promised that it would seek to communicate relevant information more quickly on issues that could stir public concern.The Mainichi Shimbun (20 March 2013) TEPCO restores Fukushima plant's spent fuel pool cooling system During the investigation to find the cause of the power loss, a 6-inch rat was found electrocuted near a switch board. Further investigations were needed to find out whether this was the only cause.AP (20 March 2013)Rat may have caused this week's Fukushima outage Although for the reactor's backup systems were available, the power loss proved that that was not the case for the spent fuel pools. No measures had been taken to prevent small animals entering this important equipment located at the back of a truck in open air.The Mainichi Shimbun (21 March 2013)Fukushima plant outage reveals lack of backup power source 2 years after crisis outbreak On 21 March, TEPCO apologized for the delay in reporting the power loss, and for not contacting the media, and promised to improve on this. The NRA decided, that it would speed up the installment of back-up power supply systems, and more durable and reliable systems. A meeting of experts was announced for 29 March 2013 to discuss the TEPCO report on the subject.The Mainichi Shimbun (22 March 2013) TEPCO apologizes for delay in reporting plant power outage Serious criticism came from the Japanese government; TEPCO was instructed to install multiple power supplies, and to do more to restore public confidence in the safety of the plant. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said at a press conference, that TEPCO was ordered to improve its risk management, that TEPCO had not promptly informed the authorities, and that TEPCO's handling of the power failure had greatly damaged public trust in the company.NHK-world (21 March 2013) Govt. tells TEPCO to add multiple power sources =Concern about criticality in the spent fuel pool= Boric acid is airlifted to Fukushima for addition to cooling water. Despite widely voiced concerns, the evidence suggests that the spent fuel pool at Unit 4 did not approach criticality at any stage. Boron injection Officials are reported to have considered insertion or targeted aerial dropping of boric acid, boronated plastic beads or boron carbide pellets into the spent fuel pools to absorb neutrons. France flew 95 tonnes of boron to Japan on 17 March 2011 and the US provided 9 tons.NHK, \\"US military playing key role in relief efforts\\", 29 March 2011. Neutron absorbing boric acid has been add to water injected into the reactor cores, but is unclear if boron was included with the spraying of spent fuel pools (SFP)s. Visual inspection Visual inspection of the spent fuel rod pool on Reactor 4 on 30 April 2011 showed that there is no significant visible damage to the fuel rods in the pool. Fuel Rods Removed On 22 December 2014, Tepco crews completed the removal of all fuel assemblies, and the spent fuel pool of Reactor 4 no longer contained any stored fuel rods. The majority of the spent fuel assemblies were moved to the common spent fuel pool while some of the unused fuel assemblies were moved to the spent fuel pool of Unit 6. Units 5 and 6 Both reactors were offline at the time the earthquake struck (Reactor 5 had been shut down on 3 January 2011 and Reactor 6 on 14 August 2010), although they were still fueled, unlike Reactor 4 where the fuel rods had been removed prior to the earthquake. Government spokesman Edano stated on 15 March that Reactors 5 and 6 were being closely monitored, as cooling processes were not functioning well. At 9:16am JST, the removal of roof panels from reactor buildings 5 and 6 was being considered in order to allow any hydrogen build-up to escape. At 9pm on 15 March, water levels in Unit 5 were reported to be 2 m above fuel rods, but had fallen 40 cm in 5 hours. Published water temperatures on 18 March showed 182 ¬∞C inside Reactor 5 and 161 ¬∞C in Reactor 6. On 17 March, Unit 6 was reported to have a single operational air-cooled diesel-generator as well as dry switchgear (inside the only GE Mark II reactor buildinghttps://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304887904576395580035481822) and this was to be used to power pumps in Unit 5 to run the Make-up Water Condensate System (MUWC) to supply more water.http://www- pub.iaea.org/MTCD/Publications/PDF/Pub1710-ReportByTheDG-Web.pdf pg31 Preparations were made to inject water into the reactor pressure vessel once external power could be restored to the plant, as water levels in the reactors were considered to be declining. NISA reported that connections from the grid to all units was complete 20 March through new cables and transformers. Information provided to the IAEA indicated that storage pool temperatures at both Units 5 and 6 remained steady around 60‚Äì68 ¬∞C between 7pm JST 14 March and 9pm JST 18 March, though rising slowly. On 18 March reactor water levels remained around 2 m above the top of fuel rods. It was confirmed that panels had been removed from the roofs of Units 5 and 6 to allow any hydrogen gas to escape. At 4:22am on 19 March, the second unit of emergency generator A for Unit 6 was restarted which allowed operation of pump C of the residual heat removal system (RHR) in Unit 5 to cool the spent fuel storage pool and reactor core alternately. Later in the day, Pump B in Unit 6 was also restarted to allow cooling of the spent fuel pool and reactor core there. Crews had installed temporary submersible seawater pumps and hoses to supply cooling water to the residual heat removal system heat exchangers as the main seawater pumps were heavily damaged by the tsunami. Additionally, as there was heavy damage to electrical equipment in the basements from flooding, temporary power connections had to be made to the residual heat removal system main loop pumps. Temperature at Unit 5 pool decreased to 48 ¬∞C on 19 March 6pm JST, and 37 ¬∞C on 20 March when Unit 6 pool temperature had fallen to 41 ¬∞C. On 20 March, NISA announced that both reactors had been returned to a condition of cold shutdown. On 23 March, it was reported that the cooling pump at Reactor 5 stopped working when it was transferred from backup power to the grid supply.Seismic Damage Information (the 47th Release) (As of 08:00 24 March 2011), Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, News Release, 24 March 2011 This was repaired and the cooling restarted approximately 24 hours later. RHR cooling in Unit 6 was switched to the permanent power supply on 25 March. On 28 May, the temporary seawater cooling pump for Reactor 5 stopped, which was discovered by TEPCO at 21 local time. At that time, the temperature in the reactor was 68 ¬∞C, and in the spent fuel pool 41 ¬∞C. At 11 in the morning the following day the temperatures had risen to 92.2 ¬∞C and 45.7 ¬∞C. Cooling was restored at 12:49pm. On 24 June TEPCO completed repairs to the Reactor Building Equipment Cooling Water system of Unit 5 which removes heat from the main Fuel Pool Cooling and Clean-up system as well as other equipment. The fuel pool and reactor core are now being cooled simultaneously, the fuel pool by the Fuel Pool Cooling System and Equipment Cooling Water System and the reactor core by the Residual Heat Removal System. Previously the Residual Heat Removal System was alternately being switched between cooling the reactor core and fuel pool. On 16 September, the same was accomplished in Unit 6 and now the reactors and storage pools of both units are being cooled separately. On 3 July in the morning, a crack in a polyvinyl hose - 30 centimeters long and 7 centimeters wide - was found around the outlet of a temporary pump for seawater. At 10am the pump was shut off, the cooling system of reactor 5 was halted 15 minutes later. The polyvinyl pipe was replaced, and the cooling system was restarted at 1:45pm. The temperature in the reactor rose some 5 degrees Celsius to 47.7 degrees Celsius. Constant tidal movements were probably the cause of the rupture of the pleated flexible tube.NHK-world (3 July 2011) Cooling resumes at Fukushima No.5 reactor On 4 July TEPCO announced that all tubes and hoses used in the heat removal systems will be checked on possible weaknesses. Tubes like these, that were used to transfer highly radioactive water, did not require replacement because they were not bent at extreme angles.JAIFHoses at Fukushima to be checked At 10:16am on 15 July, TEPCO completed repairs to Pump B of the original Residual Heat Removal Seawater System of Unit 5. The original seawater system was severely damaged in the tsunami requiring the temporary seawater pumps and hoses to be installed which have proven to be leak prone. At 2:45pm on 15 July, TEPCO began pumping seawater through the residual heat removal heat exchanger with the newly repaired pump.TEPCO (17 July 2011) Plant Status of Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station (as of 3:00 pm, 17 July) External Power Unit 5&6 connection to the 500 kV Futaba Line (ÂèåËëâÁ∑ö) The Futaba lines remained energized during the earthquake, and tsunami.NISA March 2012 page 39, 41, and 46 for internal damage Damage to equipment in the plant substation prevented this power from being used.

The Mono-ha artists explored the encounter between natural and industrial materials, such as stone, steel plates, glass, light bulbs, cotton, sponge, paper, wood, wire, rope, leather, oil, and water, arranging them in mostly unaltered, ephemeral states. The works focus as much on the interdependency of these various elements and the surrounding space as on the materials themselves. Origin of the Term ‚ÄúMono-ha‚Äù and its Members ‚ÄúMono-ha‚Äù is usually translated in a literal manner, as ‚ÄúSchool of Things.‚Äù The Mono-ha artists regularly assert that ‚ÄúMono-ha‚Äù was a term disparagingly coined by critics (specifically Teruo Fujieda‚ÄúMonoha no sakugo‚Äù (Mono-ha‚Äôs Mistake), Bijutsu tech≈ç (March 1973), pp. 8-11 and Toshiaki Minemura‚Äú to ‚Äì\\"Mono-ha\\" igo no moraru‚Äù (‚ÄòRepetition‚Äô and ‚ÄòSystem‚Äô‚ÄîThe Moral after ‚ÄòMono- ha‚Äô), Bijutsu tech≈ç, no. 375 (December 1973), pp. 170‚Äì175 in Bijutsu Techo magazine in 1973) well after they had begun to exhibit their work, and they did not begin as an organized collective. The artists' writings and conversations were published before critics coined the term, including the seminal article by Lee ‚ÄúWorld and structure‚ÄîCollapse of the object [Thoughts on Contemporary Art]\\" in 1969Lee, ‚ÄúSekai to k≈çz≈ç: Taish≈ç no gakai (gendai bijutsu ronk≈ç)‚Äù (World and structure‚ÄîCollapse of the object [Thoughts on Contemporary Art]), Dezain hihy≈ç, no. 9 (June 1969) and the noteworthy artists' round table \\"Voices of emerging artists: From the realm of Non- Art\\"‚ÄúHatsugen suru shinjintachi - Higeijutsu no chihei kara‚Äù (Voices of emerging artists: From the realm of Non-Art), Bijutsu tech≈ç 22, no. 324 (February 1970): 12‚Äì53 published in 1970. Many of the Mono-ha artists were first exhibited at Tamura and Maki Galleries in Tokyo owned by Nobuo(Shinro) Yamagiishi who was also an art writer and whose archives are in the collection of The National Art Center Tokyo. Toshiaki Minemura explains in his 1986 essay ‚ÄúWhat Was Mono-ha?,‚Äù that in terms of their academic background and intellectual exchange, the Mono-ha artists are divided into three groups:Minemura, Toshiaki. \\"What was MONO-HA?\\", MONO-HA, Kamakura Gallery, 1986, p.6 # \\"The Lee + Tamabi Connection.‚Äù This comprises Nobuo Sekine, Kishio Suga, Shingo Honda, Katsuhiko Narita and Katsur≈ç Yoshida in the painting department, and Susumu Koshimizu in the sculpture department at Tama Art University (aka Tamabi) as well as Jiro Takamatsu and Lee Ufan, a Korean artist who is a close friend of Sekine. # ‚ÄúThe Geidai Connection,‚Äù a group of artists around K≈çji Enokura and Noboru Takayama, who were both graduates of the Tokyo University of the Arts (aka Geidai), and Hiroshi Fujii and Makoto Habu, who were involved in Mono-ha later on. # ‚ÄúThe Nichidai Connection,‚Äù students from the Nihon University (aka Nichidai) Fine Arts Department‚Äîwhose central figure was Noriyuki Haraguchi‚Äîalso known as the ‚ÄúYokosuka Group,‚Äù due to Haraguchi‚Äôs upbringing in Yokosuka and his critique of the local US military presence through his work.Kishio Suga. Los Angeles: Blum & Poe, 2012, p.8 Socio-Political Context Mono-ha emerged in response to a number of social, cultural and political precedents set in the 1960s. With the exception of Lee Ufan, who was a decade older, most of the Mono-ha artists were just beginning their careers when the violent student protests of 1968‚Äì69 occurred. At the same time, there was much protest against the second extension of the US-Japan Security Treaty (known in abbreviated Japanese as Anpo) in 1970, binding Japan into providing logistical support for the US war in Vietnam. Coupled with demands for the reversion of Okinawa by 1972 and the removal of nuclear weapons based there, the climate of protest during this period was symptomatic of a growing distrust of the United States‚Äô intentions towards Asia and its dominant position in the bilateral relationship with Japan. The activism of the ‚ÄúAnpo generation‚Äù gave rise to a highly intellectual counterculture that was both critical of US ‚Äúimperialism‚Äù and acutely self- aware of its Japanese identity.Munroe, Alexandra. Japanese Art After 1945: Scream Against the Sky. Harry N. Abrams Inc, 1994. p.215 The Mono-ha artists typically deny involvement with student activist movements at the time, though it is thought that the tense political climate influenced their work, allowing them to grapple with and make sense of their unease and disillusionment with postwar modernity in their different ways. Recent Attention in the United States In 2012, Blum & Poe gallery introduced the Mono-ha art into the US with the survey exhibition ‚ÄúRequiem for the Sun: The Art of Mono-ha,‚Äù curated by Mika Yoshitake. The gallery has also held solo exhibitions of Lee Ufan, Kishio Suga, Susumu Koshimizu, Koji Enokura, and Nobuo Sekine.

He is known for completing long-term projects documenting Britain and exploring the industrialisation of space. In 2008, he was nominated for the Deutsche B√∂rse Photography Prize.  Life and work  Davies was born in Sedgefield, County Durham, England in 1949.Potted biography of Davies; in Gerry Badger and John Benton-Harris (eds), Through the looking glass: Photographic art in Britain 1945‚Äì1989 (London: Barbican Art Gallery, 1989; ), p.177. He grew up in coal mining and farming communities, and this combination of open space and industry was to become a persistent motif in his creative work. His early life was spent living in industrial landscapes in County Durham and Nottinghamshire. He studied photography, first attending Mansfield School of Art to complete a foundation course, then studying at Trent Polytechnic (now Nottingham Trent University), graduating in 1974. Following this, he began working on long-term projects, seeking commissions and arts funding to support his work. He has worked closely with Amber/Side Collective on a number of commissions. In 1981, Davies won a one-year photography fellowship at Sheffield Polytechnic, and he became senior research fellow at the Art School of University of Wales Cardiff (UWIC) in 1995. He is known for producing large photographic prints of images produced from high vantage points, using traditional darkroom techniques. His work in the 1980s primarily used medium format cameras, and work from the 1990s a large format camera, although in recent years he has begun using dSLR and digital medium format cameras in his work as well. While his career began by producing traditional, but masterful, landscape images he quickly progressed to composition where the natural environment was juxtaposed against industrial elements impinging on it. This theme of industrialisation has become more prominent with The British Landscape his best-known body of work, and recent work in Mount Fuji, Japan (Fuji City), a meditation on the balance between nature and industry. He has also become involved in local politics, as his interest in the use of public space has been both personal and professional. The shift in subject matter also developed into a fascination with urban regeneration and work on this includes his Metropoli Project, City State, and Cities on the Edge, the latter of which he curated, in addition to contributing images of his own. Davies' style was a major influence on the practice of noted art photographer Andreas Gursky. His book A Green and Pleasant Land was the first photobook published by Dewi Lewis, while Lewis was at Cornerhouse. Lewis would later go on to found Dewi Lewis Publishing. He was the first photographer to be commissioned to work for the Museum of London in 2002. In 2008, Davies was nominated for the Deutsche B√∂rse Photography Prize, organised by The Photographers' Gallery. He lives with his partner and their daughter Alix in Liverpool, England.

During the summer of 1991, the UNGCI mission reached a level of 500 personnel that were delegated from the U.N. H.Q. in New York City, U.N. Geneva, U.N. Vienna, and the U.N. Kenya. National contingents of about 50 personnel originated from the following countries: Austria, Bangladesh, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Fiji, Ghana, Greece, Nepal, The Philippines, Poland, Netherlands, and Thailand. After a short training period in Baghdad, the guards moved initially to Erbil and Dohuk (in the northern part of Iraq) and were assigned to serve mostly in Kurdistan under three Sectors (Dohuk, Erbil, Sulaimaniyah), though some service was performed in the south of the country, in the area of Basra city.

It is Monson's first novel, and is described by him as a work of poetry, fiction and nonfiction. Plot Other Electricities is based on experiences Monson had as a child growing up on the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The novel focuses on the characters and their interactions with one another in a small town in Upper Michigan. Much of the book revolves around the central character \\"Yr Protagonist\\" and his interactions with his friends and family. The opening chapter describes a police officer alerting the family of Liz, Yr's girlfriend, being killed in a snowmobile crash in a frozen river, which is the basis of much of the novel. Some reviewers speculate that Yr Protagonist is a semi-autobiographical character. Structure Monson stated that he tried to \\"activate\\" otherwise non-authorial sections of the text by specially composing a character list, list of symbols, and index. The book's pieces of poetry were designed by Monson to be read as poetry or prose. The book's thematic material is based largely on repeating motifs. Role of Design Monson, who claims \\"informal training\\" in design, both authored the text and designed the page layout of an early Other Electricities in Pagemaker. In an early draft of the novel, headers and gutter space featured text that interacted with page numbers.

He was called to the bar by the Middle Temple in 1910 and took silk in 1927, entitling him to the postnominals 'KC' (which became 'QC' in 1952). In 1935 he was appointed a judge of the Cape Provincial Division, and in 1939 he became a Judge of Appeal in the Appellate Division, South Africa's highest court. Centlivres was Chancellor of the University of Cape Town from 1950 until his death in 1966. The Centlivres Building on the university's upper campus is named after him.

The reach cast involves casting the fly lure over flowing water, such as a stream, and then just before the fly lands, moving the arm and fly rod in the upstream direction to arrange the fishing line so that it produces less apparent drag in the water. The technique allows the lure to more closely resemble a free-floating insect, resulting in greater chance of it being taken by a fish. Reach casting also allows an experienced caster to pitch curved casts in order to get the lures into difficult places. Reach casting is most commonly used in fishing freshwater streams for trout although the reach cast is also used in some saltwater fishing where one can stand in the shallows and there is a consistent current moving in one direction. A reach cast is considered a type of mend during the casting stroke, an in-air mend prior to the fly landing in the water. Without this cast adjustment, the line would grow taut immediately upon impact with the moving water's surface and would pull the fly against the current or across it, making its motion become more unnatural to the fish seeking an insect that has just landed on the water. In many streams, current may flow more slowly along the edges where it is shallower and there is drag introduced by the shore, and surface-feeding trout and other fish tend to linger in the still part of the water. When casting a line across a stream, the line can land in the swifter-running portion of the current, and would pull against the fly lure that lands in the slower-moving water. The reach cast introduces some slack to compensate for the faster-moving water, allowing the fly to land and move more like a floating insect.

The quarter eagle was struck from 1908 to 1915 and from 1925‚Äì1929. The half eagle was struck from 1908 to 1916, and in 1929. The pieces remain the only US circulating coins with recessed designs. These coins were the last of their denominations to be struck for circulation, ending series that began in the 1790s. President Theodore Roosevelt, from 1904, vigorously advocated new designs for United States coins, and had the Mint engage his friend, the sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens, to design five coins (the four gold pieces and the cent) that could be changed without congressional authorization. Before his death in August 1907, Saint-Gaudens completed designs for the eagle ($10 piece) and double eagle, although both required subsequent work to make them fully suitable for coining. With the eagle and double eagle released into circulation by the end of 1907, the Mint turned its attention to the half eagle and quarter eagle, originally planning to duplicate the double eagle's design. The Mint had difficulty fitting the required inscriptions on the small gold coins. President Roosevelt, in April 1908, convinced Mint Director Frank Leach that it would be a better idea to strike a design similar to that of the eagle, but below the background, to secure a high-relief effect. Such coins were designed by Boston sculptor Bela Lyon Pratt at the request of the President's friend, William Sturgis Bigelow. After some difficulty, the Mint was successful in this work, though Pratt was unhappy at modifications made by the Mint's engravers, headed by longtime Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber. The two pieces were struck until World War I caused gold to vanish from circulation, and then again in the late 1920s. Neither coin circulated much; the quarter eagle saw popularity as a Christmas present. In 1933, President Franklin Roosevelt stopped the issuance of gold in coin form, and recalled many pieces which were in private or bank hands.  Inception  In 1904, US President Theodore Roosevelt complained about the artistic quality of American coinage to his Secretary of the Treasury, Leslie Mortier Shaw, and asked if it were possible to hire a private sculptor such as the President's friend Augustus Saint-Gaudens to give modern, artistic designs to US coins. At Roosevelt's instigation, Shaw had the Mint (part of the Department of the Treasury) hire Saint-Gaudens to redesign five denominations of US coinage that could be changed without an Act of Congress: the cent and the four gold pieces (the quarter eagle, half eagle, eagle and double eagle). By the Mint Act of 1792, an \\"eagle\\" was made equivalent to ten dollars. Mint officials originally assumed that whatever design was selected for the double eagle would simply be scaled down for the three lower denominations. In May 1907, however, President Roosevelt decided that the eagle and double eagle would bear very different designs, a departure from past practice. In August (the month of Saint- Gaudens' death from cancer), outgoing Mint Director George E. Roberts wrote, \\"no instructions have been received from the President as to the half and quarter eagle, but I expected that the eagle design would be used upon them\\". After considerable difficulties, the Mint issued the eagle and double eagle based on Saint-Gaudens' designs later that year. The eagle featured Liberty wearing an Indian headdress on the obverse and a perched bald eagle on the reverse; the double eagle featured Liberty striding forward on the obverse and a flying eagle on the reverse. Due to the difficulties with the two larger coins, little attention was given to the half eagle and quarter eagle until late 1907. On November 28, 1907, Treasury Secretary George Cortelyou wrote in a letter that the double eagle design was to be used for the two small gold pieces. On December 2, Mint Director Frank Leach instructed the Philadelphia Mint to prepare coinage dies for the small pieces, using the double eagle design. Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber replied a week later that it would be difficult to put all the legends that were required by law on the new pieces, such as the name of the country. On the double eagle, \\"E Pluribus Unum\\" is placed on the edge, an impractical setting on pieces about the size of the nickel and dime. Philadelphia Mint Superintendent John Landis forwarded Barber's letter to Leach with his own note, stating, \\"I know it will be difficult to put the inscription 'E Pluribus Unum' on the periphery of a quarter eagle, but I do not see where else it can [go] and we must try to do it\\". Barber was assigned the task of solving these difficulties. He planned to use his low-relief version of Saint-Gaudens' double eagle design, but he made slow progress on the assignment. Leach wrote to Saint-Gaudens' attorney to ask if the sculptor's assistant Henry Hering could do the work. Hering was willing, and asked for enlarged models of the double eagle designs. Barber opposed bringing in outsiders, citing delays in the preparation of the earlier gold coin designs which he attributed to the Saint-Gaudens studio: \\"it is entirely unnecessary to trouble Mr. Hering any further, unless another year is to be wasted in vain endeavor\\". On January 3, 1908, Leach wrote to Hering to inform him that all work would be done by the Mint.  Innovation  The President's friend, Dr. William Sturgis Bigelow, had been in Japan for most of 1907; on his return to his Boston home he heard about the Saint-Gaudens coinage from Senator Henry Cabot Lodge. Bigelow was one of a number of Roosevelt's friends given early specimens of the double eagle. He wrote to the President on January 8, 1908, praising the Saint-Gaudens coins and stating that he was working with a Boston sculptor, Bela Pratt, on an idea that would allow coins to be struck in high relief. Pieces struck in this manner would have the designs protected from wear and be able to stack easily (both problems with high relief coins). The President responded to express his interest on January 10, and Pratt was soon busy on a model for him to examine. Roosevelt did not then tell the Mint of the new proposal. Bela Pratt's plaster models for the half eagle The newly released eagle and double eagle had provoked considerable controversy over their omission of the motto \\"In God We Trust\\", and with Congress already preparing to require the motto's use, Leach ordered work suspended on the half and quarter eagle on January 18. The Mint had not expected to have to put \\"In God We Trust\\" on small coins of the double eagle design, on which it was already having trouble finding space for the other required legends. On the assumption the bill would succeed, Leach had Barber continue with his work, and at least one pattern half eagle was struck on February 26 for Leach to show the President. Pratt completed plaster models for the coin, using the obverse design for the ten-dollar piece as the basis, but using a photograph of an unknown, male Indian from his photo collection rather than Saint-Gaudens' female Liberty. He displayed one model in his Connecticut studio, and sent another to Bigelow for presentation to the President the next time the two friends met. Roosevelt and Bigelow had lunch with Mint Director Leach on April 3. The President was enthusiastic about the proposed coin. Leach recalled in his memoirs: The Indian Head eagle, designed by Saint-Gaudens, was the basis for the designs for the smaller gold pieces. Examples of the Indian Head gold pieces grouped with modern coins for size comparison purposes As a result of the White House lunch meeting, Leach agreed to abandon the idea that the double eagle design be used for the small gold pieces, and to cooperate with Bigelow and Pratt in the making of the new coins. Leach even undertook to reimburse Pratt's fee of $300 to Bigelow from government funds. The President wanted to see Saint-Gaudens' standing eagle from the ten-dollar piece adapted in a recessed surface for the smaller pieces, and, if it did not constitute a change of design, used on the ten- dollar piece as well (a project that did not go beyond the talking stage). Bigelow wrote to Pratt on May 1 after conferring with Leach, stating that the Mint Director would likely not object if Pratt were to improve Saint-Gaudens' standing eagle, but \\"I would not, if I were you, get too far from the original, as the President likes it. Perhaps you can make him like it better.\\" Dies had been cut for the Saint-Gaudens half eagle, causing Leach to ask for a legal opinion on whether that constituted a change of design‚Äîif it did, no further change could be made for 25 years without an Act of Congress. The opinion must have been satisfactory, as Roosevelt approved Pratt's obverse design in mid-May, subject to minor changes requested by the Mint. Leach decided that both the Mint and Pratt would make versions of the standing eagle reverse; Pratt's was adopted. Pratt sent the models and casts to the Mint on June 29. Barber did not make master dies based on Pratt's work until he returned from his August vacation at Ocean Grove, New Jersey. Experimental pieces to a total face value of $75 (likely ten half eagles and ten quarter eagles) were sent to Leach in Washington from the Philadelphia Mint on September 21. Leach showed the pieces to the President, who kept a half eagle and gave it to Bigelow. As Leach had worked against practices that allowed pattern coins to leave the Mint, the coin sent to Bigelow may have been the only pattern not to be melted. The present location of the coin is not known; no pattern coins of the Indian Head gold pieces are presently known to exist. Leach approved the designs subject to some \\"improvements\\" which Barber wanted to make. The Mint Director wrote to Superintendent Landis on September 26, After production of the new coins began, Bigelow received one of each; he showed them to Pratt who wrote to his mother, \\"They have 'knocked spots' out of my design at the mint. They let their die cutter spoil it, which he did most thoroughly ... but they tried to retouch it and gee! They made a mess of it. With a few deft strokes the butcher or blacksmith [Barber] who is at the head of things there, changed it from a thing that I was proud of to one [of which] I am ashamed.\\"  Design  Saint-Gaudens' double eagle design, which the Mint hoped to modify for the smaller gold coins The half eagle and quarter eagle are identical in design, and are unique in American coinage in having incuse (engraved, as opposed to bas-relief) designs. The obverse features the head of a Native American man, wearing a headdress and facing left. The designer's initials, BLP, are found just above the date. The reverse features a standing eagle on a bunch of arrows, its left talon holding an olive branch in place. The mint mark is found to the left of the arrowheads. Although Saint-Gaudens' design for the eagle had featured Liberty in an Indian-style headdress, no attempt was made to make her features appear to be Native American. According to numismatist Mike Fuljenz in his book on early 20th century American gold coinage, the obverse of the eagle had featured \\"Lady Liberty topped with a fanciful head covering designed to look like an Indian headdress\\". Until Saint-Gaudens' and Pratt's pieces were struck, only Mint Chief Engraver James Longacre had attempted to depict Indians on US circulating coinage (in the 1850s), with his Indian Head cent and Indian Princess designs for the gold dollar and three-dollar pieces. After Pratt, only James Earle Fraser's depiction of an Indian in 1913 on the Buffalo nickel would appear until the 2000 arrival of the Sacagawea dollar. Art historian Cornelius Vermeule in 1970 dismissed complaints made at the time of issuance that the Indian was too thin: \\"the Indian is far from emaciated, and the coins show more imagination and daring of design than almost any other issue in American history. Pratt deserves to be admired for his medals and coins.\\" Vermeule suggests that Pratt's design \\"marked a transition, in the 'emaciated' Indian at least, to naturalism\\". Breen suggests the sunken surfaces were similar to those on coins from Egypt's Fourth Dynasty. Under the Mint Act of 1792, the obverse was to bear an \\"impression emblematic of Liberty\\"; he notes that a Native American on the obverse was particularly appropriate \\"for after all the Indians were free peoples before the white man's laws made them third- class citizens\\" and suggests that Pratt's eagle, before it was modified by Barber, was \\"worthy of J.J. Audubon\\".  Production, circulation, and collecting  Mint Director Frank A. Leach thought well of the new coins despite the controversy. Dies for the half eagle were sent to the mints in Denver and San Francisco; both western mints reported difficulties in striking the new pieces. Landis wrote to his counterparts at the other mints, advising them that the planchets, or blanks, needed to be shaved very slightly to strike properly. The new coins proved to be thinner than earlier coins of their denomination, due to the field being raised above the design. This meant that automated sorting machines could not reliably sort them when mixed with earlier coins. The new gold pieces entered circulation in early November 1908, attracting some negative comment. Philadelphia numismatist Samuel Chapman wrote to Roosevelt in early December to criticize the new coins. The indentations in the new coins would harbor dirt and germs, Chapman argued; the coins could be easily counterfeited by carving a disc of metal. They could not adequately stack, and they were in any event not handsome, with the Indian \\"emaciated\\". According to numismatic historian Roger Burdette, \\"Chapman's letter caused some consternation at the White House\\". The President prepared a reply in which he expressed himself strongly to Chapman, but Bigelow persuaded him to substitute a milder letter over Bigelow's signature, defending the new coins. Bigelow's letter replied to Chapman's complaint about the Indian, \\"The answer to this is that the head was taken from a recent photograph of an Indian whose health was excellent. Perhaps Mr. Chapman has in mind the fatter but less characteristic type of Indian sometimes seen on the reservations.\\" Chapman wrote again, and had the correspondence published in the numismatic press, but no one at the lame duck Roosevelt White House bothered to reply, according to Burdette, \\"the new coins were issued and would remain as they were for twenty-five years, or until Congress ordered them changed\\". Leach wrote to Bigelow on January 2, 1909, \\"I was somewhat amused by their savage attack, and should have liked to have been in a position to reply to this unjust criticism. However, I am pleased to say that adverse criticism of the coins is an exception. I feel very well pleased with the result.\\" Both the half and quarter eagle were struck each year through 1915. While \\"hard money\\" circulated in quantity in the West, in the East banknotes were much more common. A common use of the small gold pieces was as Christmas presents‚Äîthe pieces would be produced at the various mints late in the year, be purchased from banks in December and return to vaults by late January. The establishment of the Federal Reserve System in 1913 increased the circulation of banknotes, and the Mint ceased to strike quarter eagles after 1915 and half eagles after 1916. An additional factor was the economic unrest caused by World War I, causing gold prices to rise and coins made of that metal to vanish from circulation. After the war, gold did not return to circulation, and most gold coins struck were double eagles, used for international transactions and backing for gold certificates. The quarter eagle remained popular as a Christmas gift but did not initially come back into production as the Treasury held stocks of the pieces from the prewar years. This surplus was slow to dissipate, as gift givers preferred the older Liberty Head quarter eagle that had been struck until 1908. With the Liberty Head pieces becoming rarer and acquiring a premium above face value, the quarter eagle was finally struck again in 1925, principally to be given as presents. The 1925 quarter eagle was struck only at Denver, and it was then struck from 1926 to 1929 only at Philadelphia. With the economic collapse which started the Depression, the quarter eagle was not called for in commerce, and the Mint halted production. The mint mark is located to the left of the arrowhead The half eagle was not struck again until 1929, at Philadelphia. Coins of that date have a rarity not reflected in the mintage of 668,000 as few entered commerce. Gold coins not released were melted in the mid-1930s, along with those recalled from banks and private holders, after President Franklin Roosevelt ended the issuance of gold coins in 1933. Roosevelt's actions put an end to the quarter and half eagle series, which had begun in 1796 and 1795, respectively. There are only 15 different Indian Head quarter eagles by date and mintmark; the key is the 1911 struck at Denver (1911-D), which the 2014 A Guide Book of United States Coins values at $2,850 even in well-circulated VF (Very Fine, or 20 on the Mint State scale) condition. The half eagle series is longer; 24 pieces by date and mint mark. The final entry, 1929 is the key date for the half eagle series, followed by the 1909-O, struck at the New Orleans Mint in its final year of operation.

This division was formally introduced in the sixth edition of Emil Kraepelin's psychiatric textbook Psychiatrie. Ein Lehrbuch f√ºr Studirende und Aerzte, published in 1899. It has been highly influential on modern psychiatric classification systems, the DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10, and is reflected in the taxonomic separation of schizophrenia from affective psychosis.; However, there is also a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder to cover cases that seem to show symptoms of both. History Karl Ludwig Kahlbaum (1828-1899) The Kraepelinian system and the modern classification of psychoses are ultimately derived from the insights of Karl Kahlbaum.; In 1863 the Prussian psychiatrist published his habilitation which was entitled, Die Gruppierung der psychischen Krankheiten (The Classification of Psychiatric Diseases).; In this text he reviewed the then heterogeneous state of medical taxonomies of mental illness and enumerated the existence of some thirty such nosologies from the early seventeenth-century until the mid-nineteenth-century. The major contribution of his published dissertation, which is still the foundation of modern psychiatric nosology, was to first formulate the clinical method for the classification of psychosis by symptom, course and outcome.; Kahlbaum also differentiated between two major groups of mental illnesses which he termed vecordia and vesania. Emil Kraepelin first introduced his proposed dichotomy between the endogenous psychoses of manic-depressive illness and dementia praecox during a public lecture in Heidelberg, Germany on 27 November 1898.

Life and family He was descended from a successful Berlin family of booksellers, born in Berlin, the son of Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Duncker (1781‚Äì1869) and Fanny Duncker (n√©e Wolff). His brothers included historian and politician Maximilian Duncker (1811‚Äì1886), and publisher and pundit Franz Duncker (1822‚Äì1888), founder of a trade union with labor economist Max Hirsch (1832‚Äì1905). Another brother, Hermann Carl Rudolf Duncker (1817‚Äì1892) was a member of the Prussian National Assembly and a mayor of Berlin. Duncker's father had founded the publishing firm in 1809, running it alone after business partner Peter Humblot died in 1828. Alexander Duncker started his education in 1829. After apprenticeships with Friedrich Christoph Perthes and Johann Besser in Hamburg, Duncker founded his own firm, \\"Verlag Alexander Duncker.\\" His firm specialized in Belles lettres (German: Belletristik) and visual arts. Among the authors he published were Thekla von Gumpert, Ida Hahn-Hahn, Paul Heyse, Karl von Holtei, August Kopisch, Fanny Lewald, Elise Polko, Christian Friedrich Scherenberg, Hermann von P√ºckler-Muskau, and Friedrich von Uechtriz. He was instrumental in promoting new authors, and some of them Emanuel Geibel, Wilhelm Jensen, Marie Petersen, Gustav zu Putlitz, and Theodor Storm found their first recognition through Duncker's efforts. Duncker had far-reaching political connections and regularly corresponded with King Friedrich Wilhelm IV. Later, he maintained contact with Emperor William I. From 1841 he held the title \\"Royal Court Bookseller.\\" As a reserve officer attaining the rank of lieutenant colonel, he participated in the wars against Denmark (1864), Austria (1866), and France (1870-71). Works A high point in his output was a graphic collection of Prussian castles under the title, The rural residences, palaces and residences of the Prussian nobility, together with the royal family, vacation home, and garden residences in vivid, artistically executed, colorful illustrations with accompanying text appearing from 1857-1883. The series of 320 signatures in 16 volumes included 960 color lithographs measuring 20x15 cm. The collection is especially valuable for its pictorial record of numerous stately buildings from the old eastern German lands, many of which were destroyed during and after World War II when these regions were transferred to Poland and the Soviet Union.

Many of his accomplishments came well after his retirement. Biography In 1993, he was the oldest graduate of Montana State University, at age 96, with a degree in Art. He was an avid tennis player. The Herb Kirk Junior Open, held at Montana State University is named in his honor.http://tennislink.usta.com/Tournaments/TournamentHome/Tournament.aspx?T=102103 When his eyesight failed in his 80s he took up running. Since that time, he amassed Masters Athletics World Records in the M95 800 metres and Mile run. He formerly also held the record for 5000 metres. At one point in time, Kirk held every American record between 200 metres and 5000 metres. From age 85 on, he was the first competitor in each of those age divisions of Masters athletics. In June 1999, he ran and completed the Governor's Cup 5K road race, along with four other generations of the Kirk family, which is believed to be a unique occurrence. At age 104 and 6 months, this is believed to be the oldest athlete to compete in an organized running event and second only to thrower John Whittemore in any athletic event. Kirk grew up in Pennsylvania and originally attended Lehigh University. That education was interrupted by World War I. He joined the Navy Flying Corps. At age 104, he was given the rank of Chevalier in the French Legion of Honour (L√©gion d'Honneur) for his service in the protection of France during the war. After a successful business career he retired to his wife's home town of Bozeman, where he was active in teaching pottery to nearby Native Americans. Upon graduating, he was asked to speak. He reportedly ran up to the stage, and concluded his remarks by looking at the reunion group of the class of 1943 (who would have been about a quarter century his junior) and told them \\"I am really looking forward to my 50th reunion.\\"http://www.bozemanbpw.org/BPW%20Newsletter%20March%202010.pdf When interviewed by Diane Sawyer of Good Morning America in 1999, he said about his running \\"It keeps me in good shape, active, interesting. I wouldn't do without some exercise. I'd be downhill fast.\\" Kirk's obituary in Runners World read: Herb Kirk, 1895-2001: \\"On October 3, one day after celebrating his 106th birthday, Herb Kirk, reportedly the oldest man to compete in an organized running event, died of pneumonia. At the Portland Marathon fun run in September 1996, Kirk finished the 2-mile course in about 36 minutes. He set several age group records in his late 80s and early 90s. Herb, a Montana resident, holds world and American records ranging from 200m to the 5,000m on the track. He holds countless single-age records.

With the advent of Web 2.0 and Enterprise 2.0 technologies a company can monitor and act on these relationships in real- time.McAfee, Andrew. Enterprise 2.0, Version 2.0, May 27, 2006. Accessed Aug 3, 2011. Given the number of relationships and the volume of associated data, algorithmic approaches are used to focus attention on changes that are deemed relevant.  Origin  The term was first popularized in a 2010 Forbes article,Woods, Dan. Building the Enterprise Social Graph, by Dan Woods, Forbes, Sept 28, 2010. Accessed Aug 1, 2011. to describe the multi-relational nature of enterprise-centric networks that are now at least partially observable at scale. The enterprise social graph integrates representations of the various social networks in which the enterprise is embedded into a unified graph representation. Given the online context of many of the relationships, social interactions often comprise direct communication along with interactions around digital artifacts. Therefore, the enterprise social graph codifies not only relationships among individuals but also individual-object interaction patterns. This definition follows Facebook's and Google's concept of a social graph that explicitly includes the objects with which individuals interact in a network.Facebook Social Graph APIGoogle's Social Graph API Examples of these relationship patterns can include authorship, sharing or sending information, management or other social hierarchy, bookmarking, and other gestural signals that describe a relationship between two or more nodes. Additional representational challenges arise with the need to capture interaction dynamics and their changing social context over time,Adams, Paul. The Real Life Social Network. Accessed Aug 10, 2011 and as such, representational choices vary based ultimately on the analytic questions that are of interest. Besides being a specialized type of social graph, the enterprise social graph is related to network science and graph theory.  Applications  Changes in how people connect, share, accomplish tasks through online social networks, combined with the growth of ambient public information relevant to an enterprise, contribute to the dynamism and increasing complexity of enterprise social graphs. Whereas meetings, phone calls, or email have been the traditional media for these exchanges, increasingly collaboration and conversation occurs via online social media. As Kogut and Zander point out,Kogut, B. and U. Zander, Knowledge of the Firm and the Evolutionary Theory of the Multinational Corporation , Journal of International Business Studies Vol. 24, No. 4 (4th Qtr., 1993), pp. 625‚Äì645. Accessed Aug 20, 2011. the more tacit knowledge is, the more difficult and expensive it is to transmit, since the costs of codifying and teaching will rise as tacitness increases. The consumerization of social business software enables simpler and more cost-effective ways making relationships and tacit knowledge both observable and actionable. From an internal enterprise perspective, understanding the enterprise social graph can provide greater awareness of internal dynamics, organizational and information flow inefficiencies, information seeking and expert identification, or exposing opportunities for new valued connections. From an external perspective, it can provide deeper insights into marketplace conditions and customer demand, customer issues and concerns, product development and co-creation, supply-side operational awareness or external causal relationships. Recent developments in big data analysis, combined with graph mining techniques, make it possible to analyze petabytes of structured and unstructured information and feed user- facing applications. In making use of the enterprise social graph, such applications excel at search, routing, and matching operations, particularly where these include personalization, statistical analysis and machine learning. Examples of applications that combine big data mining techniques over the enterprise social graph include business intelligence, personalized activity streams and intelligent filtering, social search, recommendation engines, automated question or message routing, expertise identification, and information context discovery.

At least 48 people were reported to have died after a suicide bomber exploded his vest at a mosque during Friday prayers in the month of Ramadan when about 300-500 people were praying; at least 40 others were also wounded. Background Pakistan has faced a renewed insurgency since the death of Osama bin Laden in April 2011, including bold attacks against military targets and the destruction of naval aircraft.

The mosque was in an area inhabited by Kokikhel tribes who have been opposed to the Taliban activities and have fought to expel them from the region. Mutahir Zeb, a regional government administrator, said that the attack could have been in retaliation and that \\"many of the wounded succumbed to their injuries, adding to the toll that may rise further as there are still people in critical condition.\\" Khalid Mumtaz Kundi, the deputy chief of the district administration, said that the suicide bomber was wearing 8‚Äì10 kg of explosives and was on foot when he exploded his vest in the prayer hall; he also said that ball bearings were used in the attack.

The wounded were taken via ambulances for treatment to the Khyber Teaching Hospital, Hayatabad Medical Complex and the Lady Reading Hospital in Peshawar.

Comparison of Hox genes between species showed that the Zerkn√ºllt gene evolved from one of the standard Hox genes (the 'paralogy group 3' Hox gene) in insects through accumulating many amino acid changes, changing expression pattern, losing ancestral function and gaining a new function. Zerkn√ºllt codes for a homeoprotein regulates aspects of early embryogenesis in insects. Unlike the canonical Hox genes which are expressed in precise zones along the anteroposterior (head to tail) body axis, zerkn√ºllt expression is restricted along the dorsoventral (back to belly) body axis. Expression of Zerkn√ºllt is repressed in the ventral part of the embryo by a protein called Dorsal, and activated in the dorsal part of the embryo by the TGF beta signaling pathway. The cells which activate the Zerkn√ºllt develop into extraembryonic tissues which surround the developing insect embryo. Zerkn√ºllt has been found to undergo a number of gene duplications in certain insect lineages. For example, in the beetle Tribolium castaneum zen duplicated to yield zen and zen2; in many flies, including Drosophila, zen duplicated to give zen, zen2 and the even more divergent Bicoid gene . Large expansions of zen through gene duplication have also been observed within Lepidoptera. In this group, zen has duplicated at least four times resulting in the emergence of the additional divergent 'Special homeobox' (Shx) genes, named ShxA, ShxB, ShxC and ShxD . The original zen gene is still present. In some lepidopteran species, such as the Domesticated Silkmoth Bombyx mori, even greater numbers of duplications of zen occurred, with 12 Shx loci annotated along with zen .

Shatrov served in the regiment as bandmaster and composed the tune on returning from the war. While the regiment was stationed in Samara in 1906, he made the acquaintance of Oskar Knaube (1866‚Äì1920), a local music shop owner, who helped the composer to publish his work and later acquired ownership of it. \\"On the Hills of Manchuria\\" achieved colossal success and Knaube boasted of having published some 82 different editions of the piece. Soon after its publication, the poet Stepan Petrov, better known by the pen-name of Skitalets, provided the lyrics which contributed to its wider success. The original words concern fallen soldiers lying in their graves in Manchuria, but alternative words were adapted to the tune later, especially during the Second World War. During the 1990s the song was featured in two films. In Nikita Mikhalkov's Urga (Close to Eden, 1991), the drunken lorry driver Sergei has the notes tattooed on his back and later sings the song in a nightclub, with the band playing from his back. Then in the British-American Onegin (1999) it was used anachronistically as the tune played at Tatyana's naming day. The song was also included in the 2010 movie Fortress of War. Israeli television drama series Shtisel (season 2, 2016) features an accordion performance of the song by one the main characters, Giti Weiss.

Directed by horror- veteran Nayato Fio Nuala, it starred Bunga Citra Lestari, Ben Joshua, and Richard Kevin. The soundtrack album, Cinta Pertama, was well received.  Production  Cinta Pertama was directed by Nayato Fio Nuala, whose previous directing experience was in horror; Hanya Wanita notes that this was evident in some hospital scenes, which were dark and eerie. The script was written by Titien Wattimena. Bunga Citra Lestari, a first time film actress but long-time sinetron (Indonesian soap opera) actress, was cast for the lead female role. To prepare, she trained with Eka Sitorus. She found the happy scenes to be hardest to act, but was grateful for the workshops and discussions the cast had on set. Addie MS was chosen to provide the score, with Lestari also providing the vocals for the soundtrack, including the lead song \\"Sunny\\", which was written by Dewiq.  Plot  Alya (Bunga Citra Lestari), a 20-year- old woman becomes engaged to Abi (Richard Kevin), a young businessman. The following day, Abi finds her unconscious, with blood dripping from her nose. Fearful that she has a life-threatening illness, he rushes her to the hospital. As Alya lies in a coma, Abi finds her diary and reads that she still loves her high school sweetheart and first love, Sunny (Ben Joshua); the two were separated after high school when Sunny left Jakarta for university, without either of them confessing their feelings. Upon reading his fianc√©e's diary, Abi decides to search for Sunny and ask him to visit Alya. Sunny, who by that point is already married, agrees after his wife gives him permission. Upon seeing Alya, Sunny's feelings return, and he holds Alya's hand. She wakes up from her coma.  Release and reception  Cinta Pertama received wide release on 7 December 2006. It was rated R for remaja, the equivalent of a US PG-13. Hanya Wanita called Lestari's performance \\"touching\\", writing that her emotional struggle showed clearly. The score was praised, with it and the cinematography being compared to other Asian romances. A song from the soundtrack, \\"Sunny\\", was released as a single. It was well received. The soundtrack album, Lestari's first, sold 75,000 copies in the first two weeks.

Mead James R. Mead (May 3, 1836March 31, 1910) was a plainsman, Kansas pioneer, one of the founders of Wichita, Kansas and state legislator. He was active in seeking to protect the rights of the Kansas Indian tribes. He aided in directing the cattle drives along the Chisholm Trail to the city. In 1871, he was instrumental in bringing the Wichita & Southwestern railroad to Wichita. He possessed a lifelong interest in biology and ethnology. Later in life, he wrote articles for the Kansas State Historical Society and for the Kansas Academy of Science. His memoirs were published (1986, 2008) in the book, Hunting and Trading on the Great Plains 1859-1875 [Rowfant Press 2008, ] . Biography James R. Mead was born in New Haven, Vermont to the Reverend Enoch Mead (born 1809; graduated Yale University 1830; ordained Presbyterian minister 1833) and Mary Emmes James. The family settled on a farm purchased near Davenport, Iowa in 1837. There Mead acquired his appreciation of nature and the American frontier. At the age of 14, he attended Iowa College (preparatory school) in Davenport and also had one year of college at age 19. James R. Mead arrived in Kansas Territory in 1859, having ridden in from his home in Iowa, and was soon involved in trading with the Indians. He was a Kansas pioneer and businessman. The trading post he established in the Arkansas Valley in 1864 was the first building on the site that was to become Wichita - a city he was instrumental in founding and developing. He later served in the State Senate, but one of his early business partners was Jesse Chisholm who had a trading post in Indian Territory and it was Chisholm's frequent trips up to get supplies from Mr. Mead during the Civil War that caused the route to be called the Chisholm Trail. In 1871 Mr. Mead was the guiding force behind the move to bring the railroad down from Newton to Wichita. Mr. Mead had a lifelong interest in archaeology, natural history, and ethnology. He wrote many articles for the Kansas State Historical Society and the Kansas Academy of Sciences. Late in life he dictated his memories of his early days in Kansas which were later published in his book Hunting and Trading on the Great Plains, 1859 - 1875. Hunting and Trading, 1859 - 1875 James R. Mead arrived in Kansas territory in 1859 at the age of 23 when the land was still the ancestral home of the Osage, Kansas, Kiowa, Comanche and many other Indian tribes. Vast herds of buffalo in the tens of millions still roamed from their northern range in Canada to southern Texas. The Santa Fe Trail and the Oregon Trail criss-crossed the state. The Santa Fe Trail originated near Westport, Kansas. The wagons, carrying 8 to 10 thousand pounds of goods with as many as 10 to 30 oxen or Missouri mules traveled all the way to Santa Fe. In the process, a huge trail of 60 to 100 feet wide was worn smooth and solid by the constant travel.James R. Mead, Hunting and Trading on the Great Plains, 1859 - 1875, page 46. Mead arrived when the land was a \\"hunter's paradise\\". There was still not a foot of railroad track in the territory. Hunting in the Smoky Hills off the Saline River (Kansas), he observed: 'The whole country had the appearance of a well-kept park belonging to some English nobleman. The grass was eaten down close by the buffalo and paths ran in every direction. The country was well watered by pure streams fringed by belts of timber and the high buttes were clothed with grass to their summits.'.James R. Mead, Hunting and Trading on the Great Plains, 1859 - 1875, page 56. In 1860 Mead established a camp on Spillman Creek northwest of present day Salina. For several years he traded with the Sioux, Cheyenne and Kaw Indians before Indian troubles convinced him that a move was in order for the safety of himself and his family. In the Summer of 1863 Mead left the Smoky Hills and established a trading post at Towanda in Butler County, Kansas. For the next several years Mead successfully operated his trading post. He continued trading with the various Indian tribes and supplying other traders including Jesse Chisholm.James R. Mead, Trader and Townbuilder, Western Trails, Wichita State University, Department of Special Collections, http://specialcollections.wichita.edu/western_trails/exhibit/exhibit.asp Treaty of the Little Arkansas On October 17, 1865 the United States and all of the major Plains Indians Tribes signed a treaty on the Little Arkansas River. It was there, that Mead first met Kit Carson who was representing the government. Wichita In 1868, along with Governor Crawford and others, he incorporated the town of Wichita. Mead insisted on the name Wichita as the Wichita Indians had occupied the town-site for several years.KANSAS.

The portrait is a tender but unflinching physical study of his mother, Barbara Holper (c. 1451‚Äì1514), completed two months before she died.Conway, William Martin. \\"Literary Remains of Albrecht Durer\\". University of Toronto, Robarts Library, 1889Tatlock, 116 D√ºrer was close to her, and after her death wrote that she had \\"died hard\\" and that \\"I felt so grieved for her that I cannot express it\\".Sturge Moore, 71 In its bleakness, the drawing has been compared to his two great 1514 engravings, Melencolia I and Madonna by the Wall. It is Durer's second portrait of her; his c. 1490 oil on oak panel painting now in Nuremberg is today generally accepted to be either an original or a copy of a lost portrait of her. The drawing was bought in c. 1877 by the Kupferstichkabinett from the Firmin-Didot auction house in Paris during a period of acquisition of over 35 D√ºrer drawings by the gallery.The others came from the Posonyi-Hulot collection, also in Paris.Campbell Hutchison, Jane. \\"Albrecht Durer A Guide to Research\\". New York: Garland, 2000. 47 Description and background Portrait of Barbara D√ºrer, n√©e Holper, attributed to Albrecht D√ºrer, c 1490 when she would have been around 39. Oil on oak panel, 47 cm x 36 cm. Germanisches Nationalmuseum, Nuremberg Barbara Holper was the daughter of Hieronymus Holper, under whom D√ºrer's Hungarian father served his apprenticeship as a goldsmith.Brion 16 Hieronymus Holper gave his daughter into marriage when Albrect was 40 and she was 15.Brand Philip & Anzelewsky, 5 Although they appear have been compatible and well-matched, according to their son they shared difficult lives and many set-backs. They had 18 children together, beginning in 1468 and ending in 1492, only two of whom survived into adulthood. D√ºrer biographer Jane Hutchinson suggests that Barbara Holper may have been trained and worked as a goldsmith.Hutchinson, 10‚Äì13 After her death, her grieving son wrote: > This my pious Mother bore and brought up eighteen children; she often had > the plague and many other severe and strange illnesses, and she suffered > great poverty, scorn, contempt, mocking words, terrors, and great > adversities. Yet she bore no malice. She feared Death much, but she said > that to come before God she feared not. Also she died hard, and I marked > that she saw something dreadful, for she asked for the holy-water, although, > for a long time, she had not spoken. Immediately afterwards her eyes closed > over. I saw also how Death smote her two great strokes to the heart, and how > she closed mouth and eyes and departed with pain. I repeated to her the > prayers. I felt so grieved for her that I cannot express it. God be merciful > to her. D√ºrer presents his mother with a stark realism that at first view might seem cruel or grotesque if he had not left behind written record of his affection. Her face is emaciated to the point of appearing skeletal, her skin deeply wrinkled and shadowed, her eyes almost detached and her face seemingly looking up towards a void of despair. Yet his written record about both his parents are deeply compassionate, sympathetic and caring and it is accepted that the portraits are sensitive studies of the ravages of old age and illness on human flesh. While D√ºrer forensically detailed the effects of aging on others, he was less inclined to record its work on his own body; his last full self- portrait was completed in 1500. Influence Melencolia I, Albrecht D√ºrer, engraving, 1514 The art historian Christa Gr√∂ssinger described the drawing as the \\"most affecting of all\\" of D√ºrer's portraits.Gr√∂ssinger, Christa. Picturing women in late Medieval and Renaissance art. Manchester University Press, 2007. 64. David Price wrote of its \\"rough depiction of her flesh emaciated by old age\\", and \\"existential piety in the cast of Barbara D√ºrer's right eye, which, almost unnaturally, directs her vision heavenward.\\"Price, 22 It is inscribed at the top with the year 1514. Large text to the top right reads, \\"This is Albrecht D√ºrer's mother when she was 63\\", while in smaller lettering just below these D√ºrer inscribes \\"and she passed away in the year 1514, on Tuesday before Rogation Week (May 16), about two hours before nightfall\\". Robert Beverly Hale praised the drawing, particularly the structure of the eye, for its attention to anatomical detail and the clarity with which the orbital cavity is described. Observing that the near eye is spherical in shape, he noted that D√ºrer's \\"treated the lids as ribbons of flesh\\" stretched over the eye.Hale, 210 The iris of the near eye includes two small highlights side by side, indicating that this was drawn in a room with multiple light sources.Hale, 210 See also *Portrait Diptych of D√ºrer's Parents References =Notes= =Sources= * Brion, Marcel.

Stock pot is a generic name for one of the most common types of cooking pot used worldwide. A stock pot is traditionally used to make stock or broth, which can be the basis for cooking more complex recipes. It is a wide pot with a flat bottom, straight sides, a wide opening to the full diameter of the pot, two handles on the sides, and a lid with a handle on top. French Chef Auguste Escoffier (1846-1935) published \\"A Guide to Modern Cookery\\" in 1907. On the first page, Escoffier writes, \\"stocks are the keynote of culinary structure\\" in French cuisine. A stock or broth is made by simmering water for several hours, to continuously cook added foods such as pieces of meat, meat bones, fish or vegetables. The slow simmering process transfers flavours, colours and nutrients to the water, where they blend, and a new ingredient is thus created, the broth or stock. A broth made with meat or meat bones creates a base with concentrated flavours and aromas, even without the addition of salt or herbs or spices. This is what is referred to as soup base. Stock pots are also used for cooking stews, porridge, boiled foods, steamed shellfish, and a vast variety of recipes. Stock pots have great versatility, and so they are used for many cooking purposes, and occasionally non-cooking purposes. Large stock pots may be used at home to boil clothing, wool or yarn for colour dying, for example. They do not come in standard sizes. The size of the pot is normally given on the manufacturer's label by volume, for example 12 litres. The most common materials for manufacturing stock pots are stainless steel, aluminium, copper and enamel (Vitreous enamel) on metal. More expensive types of stock pots have bottoms that are made of layers of different metals, to enhance heat conductivity.

Delve 68x68px Office Delve allows Office 365 users to search and manage their emails, meetings, contacts, social networks and documents stored on OneDrive or Sites in Office 365. Delve uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to try to show the most relevant people and content. In April 2015 Microsoft launched a mobile version of Office Delve in the App Store and Google Play for users with an Office 365 subscription. Graph Microsoft Graph (originally known as Microsoft Chart) is an OLE application deployed by Microsoft Office programs such as Excel and Access to create charts and graphs. The program is available as an OLE application object in Visual Basic. Microsoft Graph supports many different types of charts, but its output is dated. Office 2003 was the last version to use Microsoft Graph for hosting charts inside Office applications as OLE objects. Office 2007, specifically, Excel 2007 includes a new integrated charting engine and the charts are native to the applications. The new engine supports advanced formatting, including 3D rendering, transparencies, and shadows. Chart layouts can also be customized to highlight various trends in the data. Microsoft Graph still exists for compatibility reasons, but the entry points are removed. This product can be used within other products, and is available in the Object menu in the Insert tab in Office Programs. Sold separately in Mac releases. The first software sold under the name Microsoft Chart was an attempt from Microsoft to compete with the successful Lotus 1-2-3 by adding a companion to Microsoft Multiplan, the company's spreadsheet in the early 1980s. Microsoft Chart shared its box design and two-line menu with Multiplan, and could import Multiplan data. The simple graphs (pies, bars, lines) were drawn on the screen in graphics mode (which was not available on entry level computer models), and could not be printed on some dot matrix devices. The main drawback of Microsoft's solution at the time was the need to exit Multiplan and then load Chart to compose and draw a graph, because MS-DOS was not a multitasking operating system. In the early 1990s, Microsoft Chart was renamed Microsoft Graph. Query Visual Basic for Applications WordArt An example image created with WordArt. WordArt is a text-styling utility. It allows users to create stylized text with various \\"special effects\\" such as textures, outlines, and many other manipulations that are not available through the standard font formatting. For example, one can create shadows, rotate, \\"bend\\", and \\"stretch\\" the shape of the text. WordArt is available in 30 different preset styles in Microsoft Word, however, it is customizable using the tools available on the WordArt toolbar and Drawing toolbar, or on the WordArt tools tab on Office 2007 and 2010. It is also available in Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint, and Microsoft Publisher. In Office 2010 and 2016 i.e., Office 365, users can apply formatting effects such as shadow, bevel, glow, gradient glow, and reflection to their text. In Office 2007, WordArt was given a complete overhaul in Excel and PowerPoint, with new styles, new effects, and the ability to apply WordArt to regular text boxes. The new styles were included in Word 2010, but mostly removed in Word 2013. PowerPoint for Mac 2011 SmartArt SmartArt, found under the Insert tab in the ribbon in PowerPoint, Word, Excel, and Outlook, is a new group of editable and formatted diagrams. There are 115 preset SmartArt graphics layout templates in categories such as list, process, cycle, and hierarchy. When an instance of a SmartArt is inserted, a Text Pane appears next to it to guide the user through entering text in the hierarchical levels. Each SmartArt graphic, based on its design, maps the text outline, automatically resized for best fit, onto the graphic. There are a number of \\"quick styles\\" for each graphic that apply largely different 3D effects to the graphic, and the graphic's shapes and text can be formatted through shape styles and WordArt styles. In addition, SmartArt graphics change their colors, fonts, and effects to match the document's theme. It was included in Office since 2006 to now. Discontinued =Binder= Microsoft Binder was an application originally included with Microsoft Office 95, 97, and 2000 that allowed users to include different types of OLE 2.0 objects (e.g., documents, spreadsheets, presentations and projects) in one file. Originally a test host for OLE 2.0, it was not widely used, and was discontinued after Office 2000. The filename extension for Microsoft Binder files was .OBD; the Office Binder template format was .OBT. A Microsoft Office Binder Wizard used the extension .OBZ. Binder files could be opened in Office versions until 2003, with the Unbind add-in installable through the Add or Remove Programs menu. Office 97 Unbind is unavailable for download. = Small Business Tools = Small Business Customer Manager (SBCM) was an Access-based tool which combined accounting data from most popular accounting software and Outlook contacts and allowed user to track customer profiles and maximize revenue. It integrated seamlessly with Word and Publisher. SBFM original icon (1996-1999) Small Business Financial Manager (SBFM) was an Excel-based tool which allowed users to analyze data and create reports and charts based on a created from user's accounting data from popular accounting packages (i.e. QuickBooks). It was first released in 1996 and bundled with Small Business editions of Office 97 or with every Office 2000 suite except Standard. Originally it was created for Microsoft by Timeline Inc. and originally was called Accounting Analysis Pack. It was available in United States, Canada, United Kingdom and Australia. List of SBFM versions: * Small Business Financial Manager for Excel for Windows 95 (1.0) (1996) * Small Business Financial Manager 97 (2.0) (Office 97 Small Business Edition 1.0) (1997) * Small Business Financial Manager 98 (3.0) (Office 97 Small Business Edition 2.0) (1998); added business comparison, projection reports, charts * Small Business Financial Manager 2000 (4.0) (Office 2000 Small Business, Professional, Premium, Developer) (1999); added buy vs lease tool separate from What-If analysis) Direct Mail Manager original icon (1998-1999) Direct Mail Manager second icon (1999) Direct Mail Manager (DMM) was an-Internet-based tool which allowed businesses to conduct direct mail campaigns by importing address lists from Outlook, Excel, Access etc., verifying address lists by connecting to an Internet Site (ZIP-Station), printing envelopes, postcards and letters and using a mailing service. Originally it was released with Office 97 Small Business Edition 2.0 and subsequently bundled with every Office 2000 suite except Standard. This program was developed in association with Envelope Manager Software. An enhanced version called DAZzle Express was available from Envelope Manager Software. Additionally, Direct Mail Manager was available for United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France and Italy. Business Planner (MSBP) contained business-planning resources, templates, articles, advice from experts. It allowed user to create a business plan and a marketing plan (US only). It was available for United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, Germany and France. =Data Analyzer= Microsoft Data Analyzer 2002 was part of Microsoft Office XP. Microsoft originally purchased the software as part of the intellectual property of Maximal Innovative Intelligence - Maximal's \\"Max\\" product was rebranded as Microsoft Data Analyzer. Even though it was a stand- alone application and was not available in any Office XP bundle, it was a part of the Office XP suite. It was not updated beyond version 3.5. Microsoft Data Analyzer allows analyzing and visualizing data and data trends, and is integrated with SQL Server Analysis Services. Reports and graphs generated could be saved as HTML, Microsoft Excel, or Microsoft PowerPoint files. =Document Scanning and Document Imaging= Microsoft Office Document Scanning (MODS) is a scanning and optical character recognition (OCR) application introduced first in Office XP. The OCR engine is based upon Nuance's OmniPage. MODS is suited for creating archival copies of documents. It can embed OCR data into both MDI and TIFF files. This enables text search on the files, which is integrated into the Windows Search. Microsoft Office Document Imaging (MODI) enables editing and annotating documents scanned by Microsoft Office Document Scanning. It was first introduced in Office XP, and was included in Office 2003 and Office 2007. Although it is not available in Office 2010, it is possible to install it from a previous version of Microsoft Office and use it with Office 2010.Install MODI for use with Microsoft Office 2010, Microsoft Support (The Internet Fax feature in Office 2010 uses the Windows Fax printer driver to generate a TIFF file instead.) Microsoft offers MDI to TIFF File Converter, a command line tool, which allows users to convert one or more MDI files to TIFF. MODI supports Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) as well as its own proprietary format called MDI. It can save text generated from the OCR process into the original TIFF file. However, MODI produces TIFF files that violate the TIFF standard specifications and are only usable by itself. In its default mode, the OCR engine will de-skew and re-orient the page where required. Since Office 2003 Service Pack 3, MODI no longer takes over the file association with Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) files as part of the Service Pack's security changes. Also, it no longer supports JPEG compression in TIFF files. MODS and MODI are no longer available since Office 2010, although Microsoft recommends a workaround by installing the MODI component from SharePoint Designer 2007 or old Office media. Programmability MODI exposes a \`document\` and an \`image\` object through Component Object Model (COM). It can convert scanned images to text under program control, using its built-in OCR engine. The MODI object model is accessible from development tools that support the Component Object Model (COM) by using a reference to the Microsoft Office Document Imaging 11.0 Type Library. The MODI Viewer control is accessible from any development tool that supports ActiveX controls by adding Microsoft Office Document Imaging Viewer Control 11.0 or 12.0 (\`MDIVWCTL.DLL\`) to the application project. These folders are usually located in \`C:Program FilesCommon FilesMicrosoft SharedMODI\`. The MODI control became accessible in the Office 2003 release; while the associated programs were included in earlier Office XP, the object model was not exposed to programmatic control. A simple example in Visual Basic .NET follows: Dim inputFile As String = \\"C:testmultipage.tiff\\" Dim strRecText As String = \\"\\" Dim Doc1 As MODI.Document Doc1 = New MODI.Document Doc1.Create(inputFile) Doc1.OCR() ' this will OCR all pages of a multi-page TIFF file Doc1.Save() ' this will save the deskewed reoriented images, and the OCR text, back to the inputFile For imageCounter As Integer = 0 To (Doc1.Images.Count - 1) ' work your way through each page of results strRecText &= Doc1.Images(imageCounter).Layout.Text ' this puts the OCR results into a string Next File.AppendAllText(\\"C:testtestmodi.txt\\", strRecText) ' write the OCR file out to disk Doc1.Close() ' clean up Doc1 = Nothing MDI file format MODI uses a proprietary format with \`.mdi\` Filename extension for storing scanned documents together with optional annotations or metadata which can include the text generated by OCR process. It is known that MDI is a variant of TIFF. Key differences from TIFF include: * Magic number is \`0x5045\`, instead of TIFF's \`0x4D4D\` (ASCII \`MM\`) or \`0x4949\` (ASCII \`II\`). * Three proprietary image compression formats are used. * Numerous proprietary tag values are used. =Office Assistant= =PhotoDraw= =Photo Editor= =Office Web Components= Office Web Components (OWC) are a group of Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) components available in Office 2000, XP, and 2003. These ActiveX Controls can be plugged into web pages, Visual Basic, Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) forms, and Windows Forms, or programmed in-memory. The OWC can be used by any COM- compliant Component Object Model programming language. Applications such as Excel, Microsoft Access, Microsoft Project and Microsoft FrontPage allowed creating interactive web pages using Office Web Components. The following components are included: *Spreadsheet *Chartspace *Pivot table *Data source component The Office Web Components were discontinued in Office 2007 except as a part of Office Project Server 2007. However, they were available for download from Microsoft's website. Microsoft has not yet offered a complete OWC replacement. However, programmers can use a combination of third-party products, Excel Services, or Visual Studio Tools for Office to provide similar functionality. The Pivot Table web component may have problems on Windows 7.Webpage on Windows 7 does not render the OWC Pivot Table In many cases the problems are related to the new security settings in IE and can be solved by relaxing the restrictions in the relevant Internet Zone, allowing ActiveX controls and possibly cross-domain access. If the page is hosted locally in the computer, the settings for the zone are not accessible through the IE interface, and can be changed by editing the registry (under key [HKEY_CURRENT_USERSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionInternet SettingsZones0]). Four books in print cover OWC programming: *The O.W.C Black Book 2nd Edition - Alvin Bruney 2007 *The Microsoft Office Web Components Black Book with .NET - Alvin Bruney 2005 *Professional ASP Programming Guide for Office Web Components: With Office 2000 and Office XP - Qimao Zhang 2001 *Programming Microsoft Office 2000 Web Components - Dave Stearns 2000 =Clip Organizer= Microsoft Clip Organizer is Microsoft's clip art organizing software allowing users to find drawings, photographs, sounds, videos, and other media clips to include in presentations, publications, and other Office documents. It comes with a variety of stock media clips and offers more selection on the Microsoft Office Online website. =Picture Manager= =Script Editor= =Equation Editor= Equation Editor was a formula editor developed by Design Science that allowed users to construct math and science equations in a WYSIWYG environment, and was included in Microsoft Office and several other commercial applications. It was a simplified version of Design Science's MathType, evidenced with a dialog box enticing the user to upgrade to the full, paid version of the software. It could be used as a standalone program or as an embedded object from within applications that support OLE. Its feature set had not changed significantly since its introduction in Word for Windows version 2.0. Beginning with Office 2007, Equation Editor is no longer the default method of creating equations, and is kept for compatibility with old documents only. Instead, a reengineered equation editor is included, which is built into the document-editing part of the Fluent User Interface on core Office 2007 programs and all Office 2010 and 2013 programs, rather than accessed through a separate dialog and being treated as an OLE object in the document. In January 2018, Microsoft published a security update that completely removed the old Equation Editor for Office 2007, Office 2010, Office 2013 and Office 2016 when the update was installed, due to a vulnerability that was being actively exploited.

History The airfield was constructed in 1942 and was commissioned in January 1943 as Leesburg Army Airfield (AAF). It was used as a United States Army Air Forces training airfield by the Army Air Force School of Applied Tactics at Orlando Army Air Base. Leesburg was a sub-base of Alachua AAF with the 322d Service Squadron performed third echelon maintenance and supply for the operational units assigned to the station. The 313th Fighter Squadron was assigned to the airfield from 5 January-17 November 1943 training students with the P-40 Warhawk, with the 1158th School Squadron providing instruction in twin-engine fighter aircraft (predominantly the P-38 Lightning). Leesburg was also a repair depot with several aircraft supply and ground maintenance units. On 1 May 1944, the 910th Army Air Forces Base Unit (Fighter, Two Engine), took over the mission of the 313th Fighter Squadron, section \\"F\\" assuming the operations of the 1158th School Squadron. Closure The airfield was closed after the end of World War II and jurisdiction of the airfield was transferred to Air Technical Service Command (ATSC), whose mission was the transfer of any useful military equipment to other bases around the country. Under ATSC, buildings and equipment were sold and any useful military equipment was transferred to other bases around the country. The base was declared as surplus in 1946 and was turned over to the War Assets Administration (WAA) for disposal and return to civil use.

History The airport opened in April 1940 as the Kissimmee Municipal Airport. By 1941, it was taken over by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) as part of the expansion of defense forces in the United States prior to World War II. Known as Kissimmee Army Airfield, it was a sub-base of the Orlando Army Air Base. Operationally, once enough construction was completed, the first operational mission assigned to the new base was to conduct reconnaissance over the Atlantic coast and Gulf of Mexico, looking for Nazi U-Boats. The 26th Anti-Submarine Wing, based in Miami, deployed elements of the 9th Antisubmarine Squadron to the field. O-47 light observation aircraft, along with B-25 Mitchell and B-34 Lexington medium bombers equipped with antisubmarine radar were used to fly anti-sub patrols over the Atlantic coast and the eastern Gulf of Mexico. The antisubmarine mission was taken over by the U.S. Navy in mid-1943 operating from various naval air stations in Florida and the USAAF aircraft were withdrawn. Beginning in late 1942, the major mission of Orlando AAB became a training center for pilots and fighter and bomber groups of the Air University's Army Air Forces School of Applied Tactics (AAFSAT) tactical combat simulation school in Central and Northern Florida. Headquartered at Orlando AAB, the school's mission was to develop tactics and techniques of aerial warfare and to establish technical and tactical proficiency requirements for combat units to effectively engage and defeat enemy air forces. This was done with a wide variety of aircraft, including heavy strategic bombers; tactical fighters; medium and light bombers; reconnaissance aircraft and dive bombers, based at different airfields of the school. As part of the school, the 99th Bombardment Squadron flew B-25 Mitchells and B-26 Marauder medium bombers from the airfield. Beginning in January 1943, the mission of the airfield was changed to Night Fighter pilot training, the station coming under the jurisdiction of the AAFSAT Night Fighter Department (Dark). On 26 January 1943, the first American Night Fighter Squadron, the 414th was organized at Kissimmee AAF and equipped with Douglas P-70 Havocs, modified A-20 Havocs painted black and modified for night flying. During 1943, newly formed night fighter squadrons at Orlando AAB were transferred to Kissimmee AAF, where the received instruction in the P-70. The operational training unit was the 349th Night Fighter Squadron, which was reassigned to the airfield from Orlando AAB. In September 1943, the P-70s were replaced by the purpose-built Northrop P-61 Black Widow night fighter and the 420th NFS was moved to Dunnellon Army Air Base in August 1943. The squadron was only at Dunnellon AAF a brief time, being reassigned to IV Fighter Command at Hammer Field, California on 18 January 1944. The movement of Night Fighter training to California was caused by the Black Widows being built in Southern California and the squadrons being equipped with the aircraft were programmed for the Pacific Theater. With the night fighter training mission being moved to southern California in January 1944, the military use of the field was phased down. On 6 September 1944, the 904th Army Air Forces Base Unit (Fighter), was assigned to Kissimmee AAF with a mission of testing tactics, techniques and equipment. Numerous aircraft types were sent to the field, including P-39 Airacobras, P-38 Lightnings, P-47 Thunderbolts and the occasional P-51 Mustang. =Closure= With the end of the European War in May 1945, the pace of flying slowed down and in June 1945, orders were received from Orlando AAB that Kissimmee AAF would be closed. The airfield was closed on 7 July 1945 and jurisdiction of the airfield was transferred to Air Technical Service Command (ATSC), whose mission was the transfer of any useful military equipment to other bases around the country. Under ATSC, buildings and equipment were sold to civilian government or commercial entities and any useful military equipment transferred to other USAAF installations around the country. The base was declared as surplus and was turned over to the War Assets Administration (WAA) for disposal and return to civil use by the end of the year. =Major units assigned= * 99th Bombardment Squadron, 14 November 1942 ‚Äì 5 January 1943. * 414th Night Fighter Squadron, 26 January-21 April 1943 (P-70/A-20 Havoc) * 415th Night Fighter Squadron, 8 February-21 April 1943 (P-70/A-20 Havoc) : These two squadrons received only about two months of training in Florida before being assigned to Twelfth Air Force in North Africa, where they were equipped with British Bristol Beaufighters for operations. * 418th Night Fighter Squadron, 5 March-26 April 1943 (P-70/A-20 Havoc) * 419th Night Fighter Squadron, 22 April-15 October 1943 (P-70/A-20 Havoc) : Moved to England in late May 1943 to complete training under the Royal Air Force, where they were equipped with British Bristol Beaufighters for operations. * 420th Night Fighter Squadron, 1 June-20 August 1943 (P-70/A-20 Havoc) : Formed at Orlando AAF in June 1943, moved to Kissimmee as an Operational Training Unit (OTU).

She was wrecked early in 1801. Capture On 13 September 1798, Fulminante, under the command of Captain Monier captured the American brig Fame and brought her into Algeciras. On 29 October 1798, between Tarifa and Tangiers, , under the command of Captain Loftus Otway Bland, captured Fulminante, which had had the \\"impudence\\" (in Bland's words) to attack Espoir. Admiral Jervis, Earl of St Vincent, needing an advice boat, took her into service the next day as HMS Fulminante. On 7 November Fulminante was with Commodore John Thomas Duckworth at the capture of the island of Minorca. As a result, she shared in the prize money for the capture. Lieutenant William Robinson commanded her in January 1800, and perhaps earlier. Later that year Lieutenant Edward Morris replaced Robinson. Recapture and re-recapture The French privateer Deux Fr√®res captured Fulminante on 2 June 1800. She had been sailing off Cadiz when she encountered the French privateer. After a 40-minute fight the French were able to board Fulminante, forcing her to strike. In September the British recaptured Fulminante. By January 1801 she was under the command of Lieutenant Robert Corbet. Loss Fulminante accompanied Lord Keith‚Äôs invasion of Egypt. Here she supported General Sir Ralph Abercromby as he moved his troops from Abukir to Alexandria. She was stationed close to the shore to fire on French shore positions but her carronades did not have the range and so her shots fell short. On 23 March Corbet therefore brought her to within a cable‚Äôs length ‚Äî ‚Äî of the shore and anchored her there. During the night the wind rose, causing one of her cables to rub against the rocks, parting it. The second cable did not hold and within minutes Fulmiante had drifted on shore and was wrecked. There was no loss of life. The location of the wreck was reportedly \\"La Cruelle\\", near Damietta, which is to the east of Abu Qir. The court martial for the loss occurred on 1 April and apparently absolved Corbet. On 15 May Corbet delivered dispatches from Keith to the Admiralty. Although Fulminante was present for less than a month during the campaign, when the Admiralty in 1847 authorized the awarding of the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"Egypt\\" to all surviving claimants from the crews of all vessels present between 8 March and 2 September, Fulminante was among the vessels listed as qualifying.

It is a Swiss heritage site of regional significance. History The ch√¢teau of Donneloye in 2011 Little is known of the history of the manor of Donneloye in the Middle Ages. The last scion of the autochthonous family, Othenin de Donneloye, died circa 1387 without male issue: it is not known if a castle then existed in the village, but it seems probable. The manor passed to Edouard de Provana, of a northern Italian family, who in 1386 married Margu√©rite de Donneloye, daughter of Othenin, and in 1440 Jacques de Gl√¢ne, lord of Villardin and de la Moli√®re, and his descendants possessed it until 1528, when Catherine de Gl√¢ne married Aubert Loys. The manor was then split, and the castle acquired by the family of Roguenet (or Regnault) de Romont, who apparently made important architectural alterations to the edifice. Before 1600 Petterman d'Erlach (1579-1635), a Bernese catholic, inherited the castle by his marriage to Marguerite Roguenet, and on his death it passed to a distant relative, colonel Louis von Roll (1605-1652) of Soleure (Solothurn), who made further substantial alterations, evidenced by an inscription dated 1639 on the south fa√ßade. On Von Roll's death his widow, Claire de Vallier, sold the building to Jean-Philippe Loys (1622-1676). Loys, an influential landowner and politician in the region, reintegrated the manor, acquiring the rights and lands which had been detached since 1528. It was probably during the tenure of Loys that the windows on the first floor were enlarged, around 1660. In 1711 the Bernese, who had long wanted to acquire the manor because of its strategic position between Yverdon and Moudon, managed to persuade Loys' descendants to sell the rights, customs and usages, the family retaining the castle, the right to dispense justice to the inhabitants of Donneloye and other nearby villages, and to maintain a prison, no doubt the tower near the castle. The castle from then on seems to have been little used and fell into disrepair, the Loys family choosing to live on their estates in Moudon and Lausanne. On the death of Jean Loys in 1739 the castle passed to his son Georges, lord of Orzens, who died without issue in 1753, and then to his brother Paul (died 1784), subsequently to Paul's son Etienne-Charles, the last lord of Villardin, who died without issue in 1800. Etienne-Charles' nieces, Duval de la Pottrie then acquired the castle, but soon sold it to Louis Durussel, a local landowner, whose family maintained it until 1889 when it was sold to Jacques- Fran√ßois Viquerat (1838-1904), conseiller d'√©tat and mayor of Donneloye. One of Viquerat's charges was the preservation of historic monuments: instrumental in the restoration of the Ch√¢teau de Chillon and of Lausanne Cathedral, he also restored his residence at Donneloye in 1902. Several unfortunate additions and alterations of the 1950s have since been eliminated. Description Built just south of the parish church, the castle was once surrounded by substantial lands and curtilages, all now lost, with the exception of the granary to the east, and the massive medieval tower to the south of the former courtyard, which was enclosed by a wall, now extant only along the road. The castle was erected in several stages: dendrochronological research dates one of the earlier beams to 1434/5,Dendrochronological report accessed 28 June 2013 and by the 16th century it had taken on its current layout, including the imposing roof. The building today consists of a principal rectangular body divided by a wide central corridor. There are three floors, the upper used as an attic since the raising of the ceilings, probably in the 17th century. There are no sculptures like those of the castle of Avenches, but it is a typical example of a rural medieval Savoyard manor house. The castle is currently (2020) in private hands.Swiss castles.ch accessed 28 June 2013 Sources Luthi, Dave. Le Ch√¢teau de Donneloye: √©tude historique.

Codenamed Amniarix, she evaded Gestapo agents while gathering crucial information on the Germans' emerging rocket weapons programs from behind enemy lines. Her intelligence reports, forwarded to London, led directly to the British raid on Peenem√ºnde and to delays and disruptions in the V-1 and V-2 programs, saving many thousands of lives in the West. Rousseau was captured twice and spent time in three concentration camps. After the war, she worked as a freelance interpreter. Early life Born on 1 April 1919 in Saint-Brieuc, Jeannie Yvonne Ghislaine Rousseau was the daughter of Jean Rousseau, a World War I veteran and a French foreign ministry official, and his wife Marie, n√©e Le Charpentier. A brilliant linguist, she graduated in languages from Sciences Po in 1939. After the outbreak of World War II, she moved with her family to Dinard where she became an interpreter for the occupying German forces. Wartime work Rousseau began gathering intelligence on German operations even before she made contact with Allied intelligence. She took a job at the French national chamber of commerce as a translator and soon became the organization's top staffer, meeting regularly with the German military commander's staff. She was a frequent visitor with the Germans, discussing commercial issues, such as complaints about Nazi commandeering or offers to sell them goods, such as steel and rubber. \\"I was storing my nuts, but I had no way to pass them on.\\" She was arrested by the Gestapo in January 1941, but was later released and prohibited from staying in the coastal area. In 1941 she moved to Paris where she began working for a Parisian company that supplied materials to the German war effort, thus positioning herself as a source of valuable information for the Allied forces. Her formal career as a spy began in 1941, with a chance meeting with Georges Lamarque on a night train from Paris to Vichy. Lamarque remembered Rousseau from the University of Paris, where she had shown talent in languages, including German, and finished first in her class, in 1939. He asked her to work for him, and she immediately agreed. During 1943, she filed, among other reports two particularly remarkable ones about Peenem√ºnde. These reports led R.V. Jones, and ultimately, the rest of the British government and the rest of the Allies, directly to the missile and rocket development work going on there. Her collection and forwarding of this intelligence under very difficult circumstances led, through Jones' analysis and persuasive abilities in London, to British raids on Peenem√ºnde. Although several prominent sources incorrectly claim or imply that Rousseau's report led to the major raid on Peenem√ºnde on August 17th/18th 1943, her report did not reach R.V. Jones until after that date. These accounts also falsely imply that her main contribution related to the V-2, but she was connected to Max Wachtel's V-1 group and it was her report that first revealed Wachtel's V-1 testing site on nearby Zempin, which was not targeted in the August 17th/18th raid. The Allies knew about the V-2s and Peenem√ºnde before her first report. R.V. Jones relates that when he first inquired about the source of the extraordinary report that had originally tipped off the British government to what was going on at Peenem√ºnde, all he learned was that it came from \\"one of the most remarkable young women of her generation,\\" part of a small espionage network reporting from occupied France. Shortly before D-Day, a plan to evacuate her and two other agents was foiled by the Gestapo. She was the first to be caught. But even as she was being captured, she warned her comrades and one escaped. As Jones put it: \\"AMNIARIX's reports stand brilliantly in the history of intelligence, and three concentration camps ‚Äî Ravensbruck, K√∂nigsberg (a punishment camp), and Torgau could not break her.\\" She was rescued by the Swedish Red Cross shortly before the end of the war.

Career  Sugawa was born in Osaka to a family that owned an asbestos manufacturing business. He graduated from the economics department of Tokyo University in 1953, and subsequently joined Toho studios. He was inspired to enter the film industry after watching foreign films, which were imported into Japan in huge amounts following World War II. While working as an assistant director, he wrote a script titled Kiken na Eiy≈´tachi that was published in screenplay magazine Independent. Toho producer Masakatsu Kaneko was impressed with the script, which depicted an ambitious reporter involved in a kidnapping incident with a touch reminiscent of American films, and used it as the basis for Kiken na Eiy≈´ (1957), directed by Hideo Suzuki and starring Shintar≈ç Ishihara. In September 1958, Sugawa and Kihachi Okamoto were promoted to the rank of director by Toho to quell the ire of the company's assistant directors, who objected to the choice of an outsider, Shintar≈ç Ishihara, to direct the film Wakai Kedamono (Ëã•„ÅÑÁç£). The promotion put Sugawa ahead of many of his colleagues, who had paid their dues for many years as assistant directors to work their way up to the position of chief assistant director. At the time, he had only worked as a chief assistant director on a single film, Mikio Naruse's 1958 The Summer Clouds (È∞ØÈõ≤, Iwashi-gumo). His promotion to director at the age of 27 after only five years at the company was extraordinarily fast. He eventually made his directorial debut with Seishun Hakusho: Otona ni wa Wakaranai. Sugawa re-teamed with producer Kaneko on his second film Yaj≈´ Shisu Beshi (1959), which was lauded as a Japanese answer to the French New Wave and starred Tatsuya Nakadai, who was in between shooting the second and third installments of Masaki Kobayashi's The Human Condition. However, its original ending, in which the nihilistic protagonist escapes punishment for his crimes, sparked controversy when industry censorship organ Eirin and powerful Toho producer Sanezumi Fujimoto demanded that it be changed. While making a name for himself with his refined hard- boiled touch, a rarity in Japanese film at the time, he also harbored an ambition to create a unique brand of Japanese musical film, to the extent that he traveled to the United States in 1964 to study American musicals. Before the year was out, he presented the culmination of his research, the musical Kimi mo Shusse ga Dekiru. Furthermore, his Seich≈ç Matsumoto adaptation Kemonomichi was a coolly-depicted crime drama on an impressive scale that encompassed the machinations of the political world, and his entries in the Hitoshi Ueki-starring Nippon-Ichi no Otoko series were a darkly comedic look at post-war Japanese history (Nippon-Ichi no Uragiri Otoko) and a non-orthodox commentary on contemporary social conditions (Nippon-Ichi no Danzetsu Otoko). Sugawa reinvigorated the Toho New Action genre in the mid-70's with two frenetic Hiroshi Fujioka vehicles: Yaj≈´-gari, in which feuding father-and-son cops take on a radical group who kidnap a company president; and Yaj≈´ Shisu Beshi: Fukush≈´ no Mekanikku, a more violent and revenge-driven sequel to his own Yaj≈´ Shisu Beshi, which helped lay the foundations of Toho New Action. In 1976, Sugawa left Toho and set up his own independent production company called \\"Sugawa Eiz≈ç Productions.\\" The following year, he teamed up with Art Theatre Guild to produce and release an adaptation of Hisashi Inoue's play Nihonjin no Heso, but subsequently concentrated on writing and directing television series. His accolades as a television writer include an Agency of Cultural Affairs Arts Festival Award for NHK drama series Igata, and a Galaxy Award for another NHK series, Chichi to Musume no Kisetsu. In 1987 he directed his first film in 10 years, River of Fireflies starring Rentar≈ç Mikuni. His final film was Tobu Yume o Shibaraku Minai, an adaptation of a novel by Taichi Yamada. Personality Sugawa remained strictly non-religious throughout his life. and when he married actress Akemi Mari in 1969, they entered into a \\"contract of love\\" instead of holding a ceremony. He was also extremely particular when it came to filmmaking and seldom made compromises, which often led to clashes with authors when shooting films based on literary works. Writer Tatsuz≈ç Ishikawa, who butted heads with Sugawa during the production of a film of his novel Bokutachi no Shippai, was quoted as saying furiously: \\"I've never had to endure such humiliation.\\"  Filmography  = Writer = * 1957 Kiken na Eiy≈´ (Âç±Èô∫„Å™Ëã±ÈõÑ, directed by Hideo Suzuki) * 1990 Ruten no Umi (ÊµÅËª¢„ÅÆÊµ∑, directed by Buichi Sait≈ç) = Director = * 1958 Seishun Hakusho: Otona ni wa Wakaranai (ÈùíÊò•ÁôΩÊõ∏ Â§ß‰∫∫„Å´„ÅØÂàÜ„Çâ„Å™„ÅÑ) * 1959 Yaj≈´ Shisu Beshi (ÈáéÁç£Ê≠ª„Åô„Åπ„Åó) * 1960 Yama no Kanata ni (Â±±„ÅÆ„Åã„Å™„Åü„Å´) * 1960 Minagoroshi no Uta yori: Kenj≈´ yo Saraba („Åø„Å™ÊÆ∫„Åó„ÅÆÊ≠å„Çà„Çä Êã≥ÈäÉ„Çà„Åï„Çâ„Å∞) * 1961 Ai to Hon≈ç to (ÊÑõ„Å®ÁÇé„Å®) * 1962 Aru ≈åsaka no Onna („ÅÇ„ÇãÂ§ßÈò™„ÅÆÂ•≥, remake of Kenji Mizoguchi's Osaka Elegy) * 1962 Bokutachi no Shippai (ÂÉï„Åü„Å°„ÅÆÂ§±Êïó) * 1963 Taiy≈ç wa Yonde iru (Â§™ÈôΩ„ÅØÂëº„Çì„Åß„ÅÑ„Çã) * 1964 Kimi mo Shusse ga Dekiru (Âêõ„ÇÇÂá∫‰∏ñ„Åå„Åß„Åç„Çã) * 1965 Kemonomichi („Åë„ÇÇ„ÅÆ„Åø„Å°) * 1967 Taif≈´ to Zakuro (È¢±È¢®„Å®„Åñ„Åè„Çç) * 1968 Sararƒ´man Akut≈çjutsu („Çµ„É©„É™„Éº„Éû„É≥ÊÇ™ÂÖöË°ì) * 1968 Nippon-Ichi no Uragiri Otoko (Êó•Êú¨‰∏Ä„ÅÆË£èÂàá„ÇäÁî∑) * 1969 Burakku Komedi: Aa!

It was in theaters with The Muppets on November 23, 2011. Small Fry is the second short in the Toy Story Toons series, based on the characters from the Toy Story feature films. The short involves Buzz getting trapped at a fast food restaurant, where there is a support group for discarded kids' meal toys from over the years, with a kids' meal toy version of Buzz taking his place. Plot One night at fast food chicken restaurant Poultry Palace, Bonnie is disappointed to receive a Zurg belt buckle as her kids' meal toy, as the restaurant ran out of Mini Buzz Lightyear toys. In a nearby display cabinet, a Mini Buzz Lightyear complains to a Mini Zurg that they will never be played with, but Mini Zurg prefers to stay. After eating dinner, Bonnie goes to play in the ball pit with Rex and Buzz Lightyear, whom she brought along. Seizing a chance to be played with, Mini Buzz sneaks out of the display cabinet, climbs into the ball pit and pulls Buzz under the balls to take his place. Bonnie's mother packs the toys in her bag, unaware that Mini Buzz was not the real Buzz. Mini Buzz successfully fools Rex into thinking he is the real Buzz and that he was shrunk by the plastic in the ball pit, though when they return home, the other toys instantly realize he is an imposter. Meanwhile, Buzz emerges from the balls and discovers he was left behind at the restaurant, which is now closed. While trying to escape, Buzz discovers a storage room where a support group for abandoned fast food toys is being held, led by a mermaid toy named Neptuna. The support group think Buzz is another victim of abandonment and he is forced to take part in the meeting. During a reenactment therapy session, Buzz meets Gary Grappling Hook, a toy grappling hook and a member of the group, and he uses him to escape. Back at Bonnie's house, the other toys demand Mini Buzz to reveal Buzz's whereabouts, and then begin devising a plan to break into Poultry Palace and save him. However, Buzz soon finds his way home and returns, confronting Mini Buzz about his behavior. Mini Buzz is then seen at the support group opening up to the others, with Buzz now accompanying him as his sponsor. In a post-credits scene, Mini Zurg is left with the electronic belt buckle as his sole companion, much to his delight.

The leaf blade is cut into finger-like segments, themselves once-divided, which are borne on the outer side of a curved, dark, glossy rachis (the central stalk of the leaf). These finger-like segments are not individual leaves, but parts of a single compound leaf. The \\"fingers\\" may be drooping or erect, depending on whether the individual fern grows in shade or sunlight. Spores are borne under false indusia (rolled flaps of tissue) at the edge of the subdivisions of the leaf, a characteristic unique to the genus Adiantum. Until 1991, A. viridimontanum was grouped with the western maidenhair fern, A. aleuticum, which grows both in western North America and as a disjunct on serpentine outcrops in eastern North America. At one time, A. aleuticum itself was classified as a variety (A. pedatum var. aleuticum) of the northern maidenhair fern, A. pedatum. However, after several years of study, botanist Cathy Paris recognized that A. aleuticum was a distinct species, and that some of the specimens that had been attributed to that taxon (group of organisms) were a third, hybrid species intermediate between A. pedatum and A. aleuticum. She named the new species A. viridimontanum for the site of its discovery in the Green Mountains in Vermont; it has since been located in Quebec and in one site on serpentine in coastal Maine. A. viridimontanum is difficult to distinguish from its parent species in the field. It can generally be separated from A. pedatum by the shape of the ultimate segments (the smallest divisions of the leaf), and by its habitat on thin, exposed serpentine soils rather than in rich woodlands. It more closely resembles A. aleuticum; however, the stalks of the ultimate segments and the false indusia are longer and the spores larger. Due to its limited distribution and similarity to other Adiantum species within its range, little is known of its ecology. It thrives on sunny, disturbed areas where ultramafic rock is covered with thin soil, such as road cuts, talus slopes, and asbestos mines. Individual plants seem long-lived, and new individuals only infrequently reach maturity. It is one of four species endemic to serpentine in eastern North America and is considered globally threatened due to its habitat restrictions. Description Adiantum viridimontanum is a medium- sized, deciduous, terrestrial fern, about wide and high. Its fronds range from in length from the base of the leaf stalk to the tip. Like many ferns, the frond of A. viridimontanum is divided into a series of leaflets, known as pinnae, and the pinnae are further divided into pinnules. The shape of the frond in A. pedatum, A. aleuticum, and A. viridimontanum is very similar. They are usually described as having a rachis that forks into two branches, which curve outwards and backwards. Several pinnae grow from the outer side of the curve of each rachis branch, with the longest pinnae located closest to the fork of the rachis. The fingerlike pinnae are pinnately divided into short- stalked pinnules. However, this interpretation of the frond architecture (pedately divided into pinnae, then pinnately divided into pinnules) presents a problem: no other species of Adiantum, nor any other member of the Polypodiaceae sensu lato (the family in which Adiantum was once included) has a forking rachis. In fact, these species are not pedate, but pseudopedate. What appears to be a fork in the rachis is in fact the junction between the rachis and a basal pinna. That basal pinna makes up one of the two curving branches; the rachis runs straight up the first fingerlike segment on the other branch, while the remainder of that curving branch is made up of the other basal pinna. Both basal pinnae are further divided and subdivided to create the other fingerlike segments. Therefore, even though they appear structurally similar, the longest and most central fingerlike segment represents the tip of the frond, pinnately divided into pinnae (the first level of division of the frond), while the two shorter fingerlike segments immediately on either side of it are pinnae, pinnately divided into pinnules (the second level of division). Each fingerlike segment thereafter represents a level of division one greater than the one that precedes it. Therefore, the final, pinnate subdivisions of each fingerlike segment may be referred to as \\"ultimate segments\\" to avoid the technical inaccuracy of calling them pinnules. The rhizome shows little branching, with intervals of 4.0 to 7.5 mm between nodes. It measures 2.0 to 3.5 mm in diameter. The rhizome and the stipe (the stalk of the leaf, below the blade) have bronze-colored scales. The stipe and rachis range from chestnut brown to dark purple in color and are glabrous; the stipe is about 2 to 3 mm in diameter while the rachis is smaller, 1 to 2 mm. The basal pinnae are from three to seven times pinnate (due to the pseudopedate structure of the blade), while the apical parts of the blade (and the corresponding segments of the basal pinnae) are once- pinnate. The penultimate segments of the blade (the apparent \\"pinnae\\", or fingerlike segments) are typically lanceolate in shape. The overall arrangement of the penultimate segments ranges from drooping and fan-shaped on plants growing in the shade to funnel-shaped on plants growing in full sun; under the latter conditions, the segments stand stiffly erect. The ultimate segments of the divided blade (the apparent \\"pinnules\\") are borne on short, dark stalks of 0.6 to 1.5 mm, with the dark color often spreading into the base of each segment. They are long and obliquely triangular, the basiscopic margin forming the hypotenuse. The tip of the segments is typically acute, but entire (not pointed). They measure from 9.5 to 22.5 mm in length and 4.2 to 7.5 mm in breadth, the average length being about 2.5 times the breadth. Their tissue is herbaceous (firmly leafy) to chartaceous (parchment-like) in texture, and bright green to bluish-green in color. As in other members of Adiantum, the glabrous leaves shed water when young. Under shady conditions, the ultimate segments lie within the plane of the blade, but tend to twist out of the plane when grown in the sun. The acroscopic margins of these segments are lobed, with narrow (less than 1.0 mm) incisions lying between lobes. In fertile segments, these lobes are recurved to form false indusia beneath the leaf. These are transversely oblong, from 2 to 5 mm in length and from 0.6 to 1.4 mm in width. The sporangia (the fern's spore-bearing structures) are borne on the underside of the leaf beneath the false indusium, a trait found in all members of Adiantum and not in any species outside it. The sori are round, and are found on veins ending in the false indusium, below the veins' ends. The spores are tetrahedral to globose, yellow in color, and measure 41 to 58 micrometers (Œºm) in diameter (averaging 51.4 Œºm), on average larger than other species in the A. pedatum complex. Spores appear in the summer and fall. The species has a chromosome number of 116 in the sporophyte. =Identification= Adiantum viridimontanum closely resembles the other species in the A. pedatum complex (A. pedatum and A. aleuticum), and distinguishing the three in the field is difficult. Paris and Windham, in their study of the complex, noted that while each species, collectively, can be distinguished from the others, no single morphological character was absolutely distinctive among species. Sterile triploid hybrids between A. viridimontanum and the other two species may occur, further complicating field identification. One potentially distinguishing character is the shape of the ultimate segments in the middle part of the leaf blade, which are oblong in A. pedatum and long-triangular or reniform (kidney-shaped) in A. viridimontanum and some specimens of A. aleuticum. Furthermore, A. viridimontanum can grow in both shade and sun, while A. pedatum grows in shade only. Adiantum viridimontanum can be separated from the morphologically similar individuals of A. aleuticum by the greater length of the stalks on the medial ultimate segments and of the false indusia, measuring greater than 0.9 mm and greater than 3.5 mm, respectively, in A. viridimontanum. Spore size is also a useful character (although not easily measured in the field); the average A. viridimontanum spore measures 51.4 Œºm in diameter. While A. aleuticum spores can reach up to 53 Œºm, they average about 43 Œºm. In A. aleuticum growing as a disjunct on eastern serpentine (the specimens most likely to be confused with A. viridimontanum), the rhizome is much more frequently branched, with intervals of 1.0 to 2.0 mm between nodes. Taxonomy The work which led to the recognition of Adiantum viridimontanum as a distinct taxon began in the early 20th century. Following the discovery of disjunct specimens of western maidenhair fern, then classified as A. pedatum var. aleuticum, on the serpentine tableland of Mount Albert by Merritt Lyndon Fernald in 1905, botanists began to search for western maidenhair on ultramafic outcrops elsewhere in Quebec and Vermont. It was first identified in Vermont by L. Frances Jolley in 1922 at Belvidere Mountain in Eden. In 1983, William J. Cody transferred A. pedatum growing on serpentine, both in eastern and western North America, to A. pedatum subsp. calderi instead. Many of the stations for the fern in Vermont were described in 1985, in a survey of ultramafic outcrops in that state. From 1983 to 1985, Cathy A. Paris, then a graduate student, gathered specimens of A. pedatum from non-serpentine soils in the Midwest and Vermont, and from serpentine soils in New England and Canada, for biosystematic analysis. In 1988, Paris and Michael D. Windham published the results of this analysis, revealing A. pedatum in North America to be a cryptic species complex. They showed that A. pedatum sensu lato included two well-distinguished diploid taxa, one found in the Eastern woodlands, and the other found both in the Western mountains and as a disjunct on serpentine in the East. However, not all of the serpentine disjuncts proved to belong to the Western taxon. Several of them, including most of the specimens in Vermont, were found to be tetraploid, forming a taxon distinguishable from the two diploids. Isozyme banding patterns suggested that the tetraploid had arisen by hybridization between the eastern subspecies of non-serpentine woodlands and the western and serpentine taxon, followed by a duplication of the hybrid genome through polyploidy (allowing the chromosomes to pair and restoring sexual fertility). This allotetraploid was also morphologically intermediate between the two taxa, although it more closely resembled the serpentine taxon (hence its referral to var. aleuticum before Paris's work). Paris formally described the tetraploid as a new species, A. viridimontanum, in 1991, and also separated the western and serpentine taxon from A. pedatum as the species A. aleuticum. The type specimen of A. viridimontanum was collected from a talus slope at the old asbestos mine on Belvidere Mountain on August 28, 1985. The sequencing of several chloroplast DNA loci has revealed that the A. viridimontanum chloroplast genome most closely resembles that of A. aleuticum, suggesting that A. aleuticum was the maternal parent of A. viridimontanum. In 2015, Christopher Fraser-Jenkins treated it as a subspecies of a broadly defined A. pedatum as A. pedatum subsp. viridimontanum, arguing that the morphological similarity among members of the complex should outweigh the biological species concept in defining the boundaries of the species. Distribution and habitat Natural distribution of A. viridimontanum within eastern Canada and the northeastern United States Adiantum viridimontanum is narrowly distributed in New England and Quebec. At least seven stations in Vermont lie in the Missisquoi Valley, in the northern Green Mountains, giving the fern its common name. The ultramafic rocks of this area extend northwards into Quebec, where as of 2001, eight stations were known in southern Quebec and six in the Thetford Mines area. It is also known from one station on serpentine on Deer Isle, Maine. The fern thrives in thin serpentine soils on sunny, disturbed habitats such as roadcuts and talus slopes, in dunite and other ultramafic rocks. Anthropogenic disturbance has removed thicker soils and increased sun exposure in many of these sites; for instance, many of the Quebec stations are in asbestos mines, both abandoned and active. In more natural habitats, frost weathering and erosion may promote rock fall and maintain suitable habitat. A detailed quantitative analysis of habitat preferences has shown that while A. viridimontanum occupies similar habitat to A. aleuticum in northeastern North America (ultramafic ledges, mine dumps, etc.), it also occupies serpentine-influenced northern hardwood forests, where the calcium-rich forest habitats preferred by A. pedatum have been altered by magnesium-rich drainage from ultramafic sites. This niche is not generally occupied by either of the two parent species. The eastern serpentine outcrops where A. viridimontanum thrives have relatively few endemics, compared to serpentine exposures globally. A. viridimontanum is one of only five taxa (four species and a variety) that are strictly endemic to serpentine in eastern North America, and two of these, A. aleuticum and Aspidotis densa, grow on non-serpentine substrates elsewhere in North America. Ecology Adiantum viridimontanum largely reproduces asexually by branching rather than sexually through spores. While wind-blown spores can result in sexual reproduction for the species, most spores probably fall within a relatively short radius of the plant. In addition, reproduction through spore dispersal requires the spore to land in suitable conditions for generating a gametophyte, typically in bright sunlight on thin serpentine soils. These requirements allow A. viridimontanum to colonize recently disturbed sites on ultramafic outcrops, where bedrock has been exposed and competing plants have been removed. The populations appear stable, with the long life of individuals compensating for low recruitment rates. Little is known about the role of A. viridimontanum in the ecosystem. In general, ferns are less susceptible to herbivory than flowering plants due to higher levels of toxic and distasteful compounds in their foliage. A. viridimontanum is not known to be threatened by a particular predator or disease. Conservation Under the NatureServe conservation status system, A. viridimontanum is considered globally vulnerable (G3). It is considered imperiled (S2) in Vermont and vulnerable (S3) in Quebec; it has not yet been classified in Maine. Conservation of A. viridimontanum is primarily limited by its restricted habitat on serpentine cliffs and talus slopes. However, these sites are also of little value to humans. The most likely threat to the species is expansion of asbestos mining, which often occurs near populations of the fern, or other reuse of abandoned asbestos mines. Road construction might also threaten some sites, although this is mitigated by the fern's ability to flourish on disturbed serpentine.

Development The title of the anthology was originally Girls Doing Boys Doing Boys: Japanese Boys‚Äô Love Anime and Manga in a Globalized World. Mark McHarry recounts that he attended Yaoi-Con in 2006 and met other scholars there. They decided to make a book together because of their interests in wanting to research and learn more about the genre and because the three editors are fans of the genre. The book largely focuses on the spread of BL in the West. The book does not contain any explicit illustrations as figures.KUCI interview with Mark McHarry and Hope Donovan Subversities 18 October 2010 Contents The book is split into three parts with 14 chapters in total by various authors. The chapters are organised thematically into parts. Part One is called \\"Boys Love and Global Publishing\\", Part Two is called \\"Genre and Readership\\", and Part Three is called \\"Boys‚Äô Love and Perceptions of the Queer\\". Reception Andrea Wood notes the variety of contributors to the volume and notes that the volume is uneven in its quality. She notes that some contributors say that Boys Love holds a similar appeal to romance novels and that some use \\"outdated\\" scholarship to differentiate BL from romance novels. Wood notes that there is little use of comics scholarship in the volume, and little discussion of individual works. She feels though that \\"most readers will be able to find something that appeals to them\\".Andrea Wood.

Nele Noppe feels that the book does not solely focus on \\"organized fandom but rather concentrate on reader involvement\\". Noppe notes that although the volume seems to lack a focus, that some points recur through the anthology, such as a comparison between slash fiction and Boys Love, the sexual and gender identities of the BL fandom, why readers like BL, but noting that several chapters use surveys and responses of the fans themselves to avoid the \\"pathologization\\" that Noppe regards as common in studies of BL fans.Noppe, Nele. 2011.

He is primarily known today for writing the melody to the hymn Precious Lord, Take My Hand. He also served on the first geological survey of Yellowstone National Park, under Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden. Early years George Nelson Allen was born in Mansfield, Massachusetts, to Otis Allen and Susanna Allen. He had four siblings; his mother was a teacher. While living near Boston he studied music under Music Education pioneer Lowell Mason.George Nelson Allen Family Oberlin When George turned 20 he tried to go to Lyman Beecher, an important figure in the Second Great Awakening, in Cincinnati, Ohio, where he was running a seminary. George fell ill along the way and never made it, instead studying at Adelbert College. In 1835 he transferred to Oberlin College, and in 1837 while still a student was named the school's instructor of music, replacing Elihu Parsons Ingersoll, who had a few years prior become the first college Music professor in the United States. In 1841, he married Caroline Mary Rudd, a classmate at Oberlin. George and Caroline had five children. In 1844 Oberlin published Allen's Social and Sabbath Hymn Book, a collection of hymns. One of the hymn melodies in this book, entitled Maitland, was used as the setting for Must Jesus Bear the Cross Alone, whose words were originally written by Thomas Shepherd in 1693. Many years later Thomas A. Dorsey would use the melody as the setting to his own hymn, Precious Lord, Take My Hand, which became popular through its association with Martin Luther King Jr. and the Civil Rights Movement. Geology In 1847 George Allen was appointed Professor of Geology and Natural History, in addition to his music position. In his position he sought to harmonize religion and the Genesis account of creation with modern science, particularly Darwinism. As part of his duties he went on trips to Jamaica in 1864, and Yellowstone in 1871, to collect geological and botanical specimens. Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden, who led the Yellowstone expedition, was one of his former geology students. Retirement and death In 1864, due to poor health, he resigned his music position; in 1871 he retired from teaching. In 1874, he moved to Cincinnati to be near his son; he died there in 1877, and was buried in Oberlin.

The Model 1857 was first made in 1857. Prior to that year, pocket watches were not made of standard parts and repairing and making the watches was difficult and expensive. The American Watch Company created and marketed the first successful industrialized watch. Before 1857, The Boston Watch Company made and sold approximately 5,000 movements and 4,000 cases before it failed financially, and in the factory at the time there was an estimated 1,300 watches in various stages of production that had yet to be finished into complete watches. In the spring of 1857, the Boston Watch Company did not have enough money to stay running and was forced into insolvency. Most pocket watches were made in England or France, so this was a test for early American manufacturing to take and produce items better than the countries in Europe, which at the time was in the middle of the industrial revolution. Most of the Model 57 pocket watches were in coin silver, which is 90% pure. American system of watch manufacturing in Wikipedia is a great side reference on the Waltham Model 57 Pocket Watch President Abraham Lincoln's Waltham Pocket Watch In tribute, upon the Gettysburg Address, Abraham Lincoln was presented with a William Ellery, key wind watch Waltham Model 1857, serial number 67613. This watch is now in the collection of the National Museum of American History at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC. Winding and setting the Model 57 The majority of 1857 model Waltham movements are keywind from the rear and keyset from the front. A small amount of the total production of 1857 model movements were fitted with a stemwind mechanism from the factory. The earliest stemwind 1857 movements were fitted with no reversing clutch on the winding stem, and had no setting mechanism; these early movements required using a key to set the time. Later stemwind movements were lever setting, with a unique design of set lever which pivoted out from the movement rather than pulling out. Later 1857 movements also added a reversing clutch, a feature ubiquitous on all subsequent Waltham stemwind watches. All stemwind 1857 movements have the winding stem located at 3:00. Some stemwind 1857 movements were fitted with a screw which could be used to lock the winding click into the \\"off\\" position to allow the mainspring to be let down. This feature can be identified as a small screw head on the barrel bridge with the word \\"patent\\" next to it. Surviving 1857 model movements also occasionally turn up fitted with an Abbot's patent stemwind conversion.

Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is glorified in the Divya Prabandha, the early medieval Tamil canon of the Azhwar saints from the 6th‚Äì9th centuries AD. It is one of the 108 Divyadesam dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshipped as Gopalakrishnan and his consorts Lakshmi as Rukmini and Sathyabama. It is one among the eleven divyadesams of Thirunangur Tirupathis and is closely associated with Thirumangai Alvar. The temple is open from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. to 7 p.m and has four daily rituals at various times of the day. The Thirumangai Azhwar Mangalasasana Utsavam celebrated annually during the Tamil month of Thai is the major festival of the temple during which the festival images of the eleven Thirunangur Tirupathis are brought on mount designed like Garuda, called Garuda Vahana, to Thirunangur. Legend vimana The legend of all the eleven temples of Thirunangur are closely associated with each other. As per legend, the Hindu god Shiva started dancing in fury at this place after the death of his consort Uma due to the yagna (sacrifice) of Daksha. Each time his lock of hair touched the ground, there were eleven other forms of Shiva who appeared. The celestial deities were worried that if the dance continues, it would result in decimation of entire creations. They prayed to Vishnu for help, who appeared at this place. On seeing Vishnu, Shiva's anger was reduced and he requested Vishnu to appear in eleven forms like he did. On his request, Vishnu appeared in eleven different forms at Tirunangur. The eleven places where Vishnu appeared are believed to be where the eleven temples in Tirunangur are located.R. 2001, pp. 470-1 As per another legend, Krishna, the eighth incarnation of Vishnu and his consort Sathya Bhama chose this location for their garden as it was looking like the one in the palace of the king of celestial deities, Indra. Kavalam indicates elephant and padi indicates place - it is believed that Krishna saved an elephant at this place leading to the name of the temple. The event is described in the verses of Tirumangai Azhwar in Nalayira Divya Prabandham. The Temple Image of the shrine of Thayar It is located in Thirunangur, a small village, 10 km away from Sirkali, on the way to Thiruvenkadu. The temple has a small shrine with Vimanam. The shrine houses the granite image of Gopalakrishna and his consorts Rukmini and Sathya Bhama on either sides.T. 2002, p. 94 Gopalakrishna is sported in standing posture with his consorts Rukmini and Sathyabama. The name of the consort in a separate shrine is Madavaragal Mangai and Sengamala Nachiar. Worship practices and festivals View of the temple tower The temple is open from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. The temple belongs to Thenkalai sect of Vaishnavism. As at other Vishnu temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Vaishnavaite community, a Brahmin sub-caste. The temple rituals are performed four times a day: Ushathkalam at 8 a.m., Kalasanthi at 10:00 a.m., Sayarakshai at 5:00 p.m. and Ardha Jamam at 7:00 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Gopalakrishna, Rukmini and Sathyabama. During the worship, religious instructions in the Vedas (sacred text) are recited by priests, and worshippers prostrate themselves in front of the temple mast. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. During the new moon day of the Tamil month Thai, the festival deity of Thirumangai Azhwar is brought to the temple from Thiruvali-Thirunagari. The Thirumangai Azhwar Mangalasasana Utsavam is celebrated in the Tamil month of Thai (January‚ÄìFebruary). The highlight of the festival is Garudasevai, an event in which the festival images of the eleven Thirunangur Tirupathis are brought on mount designed like Garuda, called Garuda Vahana, to Thirunangur. The festive image of Thirumangai Azhwar is also brought on a Hamsa Vahanam (palanquin) and his paasurams (verses) dedicated to each of these eleven temples are recited during the occasion. The festival images of Thirumangai Alvar and his consort Kumudavalli Naachiyar are taken in a palanquin to each of the eleven temples. The verses dedicated to each of the eleven temples are chanted in the respective shrines. This is one of the most important festivals in the region which draws thousands of visitors.

The image of the presiding deity Purushottaman and his consort Purushottanayagi are depicted in standing posture. The image of the festival deities are also housed in the same shrine. Literary mention Purshottama Perumal temple is revered in Nalayira Divya Prabhandam, the 7th‚Äì9th century Vaishnava canon, by Thirumangai Azhwar. The temple is classified as a Divyadesam, one of the 108 Vishnu temples that are mentioned in the book. During the 18th and 19th centuries, the temple finds mention in several works like 108 Tirupathi Anthathi by Divya Kavi Pillai Perumal Aiyangar. Sage Upamanyu is believed to have worshiped the presiding deity. Worship practices and festivals Image of the shrine over the sanctum The temple is open from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. As at other Vishnu temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Vaishnavaite community, a Brahmin sub-caste. The temple rituals are performed four times a day: Ushathkalam at 8 a.m., Kalasanthi at 10:00 a.m., Sayarakshai at 5:00 p.m. and Ardha Jamam at 7:00 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Purushottaman and Purushottama Nayagi. During the worship, religious instructions in the Vedas (sacred text) are recited by priests, and worshippers prostrate themselves in front of the temple mast. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. During the new moon day of the Tamil month Thai, the festival deity of Thirumangai Azhwar is brought to the temple from Thiruvali-Thirunagari. The Thirumangai Azhwar Mangalasasana Utsavam is celebrated in the Tamil month of Thai (January‚ÄìFebruary). The highlight of the festival is Garudasevai, an event in which the festival images of the eleven Thirunangur Tirupathis are brought on mount designed like Garuda, called Garuda Vahana, to Thirunangur. The festive image of Thirumangai Azhwar is also brought on a Hamsa Vahanam (palanquin) and his paasurams (verses) dedicated to each of these eleven temples are recited during the occasion. The festival images of Thirumangai Alvar and his consort Kumudavalli Naachiyar are taken in a palanquin to each of the eleven temples. The verses dedicated to each of the eleven temples are chanted in the respective shrines. This is one of the most important festivals in the region which draws thousands of visitors.

The story is loosely based on the 1837 Hans Christian Andersen tale \\"The Little Mermaid\\". The series has been dubbed into various languages including French, Spanish, Polish and Italian. It is also often known as Mako the Mermaid, Mako-chan‚Äôs Magic, Syrenka Mako and Magical Mako-chan. Mah≈ç no Mako-chan aired in 1970 via Nippon Educational TV (NET), which is now TV Asahi. Plot Mako (her name is sometimes romanized as \\"Maco\\" or \\"Makko\\", and is changed to \\"Ginny\\" in the Italian version) is a mermaid and the youngest daughter of the Dragon King. She longs for the human world despite it being forbidden by her father. One stormy night, she saves a human boy from a wrecked ship and falls in love with him. Mako makes a deal with the Witch of the Sea and is transformed into a human high school girl with the condition that she can never be return to being a mermaid. With the magical pendant called the \\"Tear of the Mermaid\\", Mako meets many people and experiences many things as she learns what it means to be human, all while waiting for the day she can once more meet the boy she rescued. Unlike in the original story of The Little Mermaid, in this adaptation (created by Toei's planning team and featuring Masaki Tsuji as head writer), the mermaid is still able to speak while in human form, and this adaptation also does not end in tragedy as the original story did. Toei made a more faithful adaptation of the story as a feature film in 1975, which used some of the same staff as this TV series, including animator Shingo Araki. Characters ; :The heroine. She is the youngest daughter of the Dragon King but yearned to become a human so she can be with the boy she loves, Akira. Found by old fisherman Urashima and adopted as his granddaughter, she starts attending Karatachi School. ;Haruko :Mako's classmate at school, she becomes her closest friend there. She wears glasses yet is more vociferous in opposing wrongs, or Tomiko for that matter. ; :Jiro, along with his identical twin brother Taro, are old Urashima's real grandsons and helped him take Mako to the hospital. They also urged their grandfather to save her from traffickers who were about to sell her off.

He is able to assume human form and appear on Earth so he can help, and scold, Mako. He often overrules his wife's overprotectiveness and lets his daughter do her own things, but is stern, particularly with Mako's use of her magical pendant and the etiquette she should follow. ; :The Dragon King's wife and mother of Mako. She rarely speaks and is only seen in flashbacks, but seems to be overprotective of Mako, unlike her husband and her mother who are willing to let her go her own way. ; :A sea hag who is the Dragon King's mother-in-law. She is able to communicate with him in his human form, and often derides his lack of control over Mako to spite him (even though it was thanks to her magic that Mako was able to become a terrestrial being). ; :The old fisherman who found a nude and unconscious Mako on the beach after her transformation into a human being. He takes her in as his adoptive granddaughter. He's very stern, but deep down cares for Mako. (His surname, which Mako adopts, may be based on the legend of Urashima Tar≈ç.) ; :The young human Mako once saved from drowning, he had been on a cruise ship that capsized when the event occurred and thus lost a lot of his memory from the experience. Mako falls in love with him, but once she becomes a terrestrial being, he's not found so easily. Akira in truth is a drifter who does odd jobs and arrives and leaves town at will.

He fought most notably in the Battle of Tornow in 1758, and the Battle of Kay in 1759. He was instrumental in Frederick the Great's victory at Leuthen in December 1757. In 1760, Wedel was appointed as Frederick's first Minister of War. He came out of retirement to serve in the War of Bavarian Succession in 1778. Wedel received the Pour le M√©rite and his name was inscribed on the Equestrian statue of Frederick the Great in 1851.  Biography  The family Wedel belongs to the Pomeranian nobility. Carl Heinrich Von Wedel was born on 12 July 1712 in the Uckermark, Brandenburg. His father, Georg Wilhelm, was the Uckermark's Superior Court, and owner of the Goritz manor‚Äîhis mother was Marie Salome of Eichstedt. At fifteen years of age Wedel joined the Prussian military, enlisting as a corporal in the King's Leibregiment (Nr. 6). In 1730 he was promoted to ensign, on 1 March 1735 to second lieutenant. On 23 June 1740, Frederick II appointed him captain and company commander of the Grenadier Guards Battalion (Nr. 6). Wars of Austrian Succession Wedel took part in the Silesian Wars, though his regiment did not see battle. Nevertheless, Wedel received on 14 August 1743 a promotion to major in the Infantry Regiment von Kleist (Nr. 26), to which be belonged for the following 14 years. He was wounded in the Battle of Soor in 1745. Wedel was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 8 September 1751, and awarded the Pour le M√©rite on 31 May 1752. He was promoted on 17 June 1755 to the rank of colonel. Seven Years' War The first battle experience Wedel's regiment had in the Seven Years' War occurred at the Battle of Prague on 6 May 1757. Six days later, he was appointed regimental commander. He was present at the Battle of Rossbach. At Leuthen, he led his regiment on the difficult march to flank the Austrian left; by 1 p.m. his regiment was in place, and launched its attack. This regiment fulfilled their role with such success that 14 members were awarded the Pour le M√©rite. On 5 January 1758 Wedel took over the Infantry Regiment Schultze (Nr. 29), though he moved to the head office of his prior regiment only three weeks later. In the spring he joined the siege corps before Olomouc. Wedel repulsed Laudon's attacks in Littau on 20 June, and in Gundersdorf on 28 June. In September, he was transferred to a corps in the Uckermark to free it from Swedish control. Frederick II promoted Wedel to lieutenant general on 22 February 1759. In July, he was transferred command of the Dohna Corps, Frederick deciding the Christoph von Dohna was too ill to continue. Frederick sent Wedel to thwart the Russian advance into Brandenburg with 28,000 men; these were not enough. Due to Wedel's poor management and aggressiveness--he was ordered to attack a Russia army twice his size--they were crushed at the Battle of Kay. This loss left the road to Berlin open, and Frederick was forced to hurry north to Frankfurt an der Oder to repel the Russian and Austrian allied armies. At the subsequent Kunersdorf, Wedel was severely wounded. Health problems forced him to retire from active service in 1760. =Last years= Wedel subsequently served as Frederick's minister of war. Wedel was recalled to service for Frederick's last war with Austria over the Bavarian succession. He died 2 April 1782 in G√∂ritz. Frederick's heirs considered Wedel one of the key generals in the establishment of the Prussian state and included his name on the Equestrian statue of Frederick the Great in 1851.  Family  In 1747, Wedel married Friederike Auguste von Br√∂cker. Their marriage produced four daughters and a son. Two daughters survived to adulthood and married the sons of Wilhelm Gustav von Anhalt-Dessau. * Caroline Friederike (19 February 1748 - 5 June 1780) ‚àû 10 February 1768 to Heinrich Wilhelm von Anhalt (1735‚Äì1801) * Friederike Albertine (17 September 1751 - 8 October 1825) ‚àû Karl Philipp von Anhalt (1732‚Äì1806) References =Citations= =Bibliography= * 1782 deaths Lieutenant generals of Prussia 1712 births German military personnel of the War of the Austrian Succession Prussian military personnel of the Seven Years' War People from Uckermark (district) People of the Silesian Wars ","title":"Carl Heinrich von Wedel"},{"id":"32805488","text":"The 13th Man, also known as The Thirteenth Man, is a 1937 American mystery film directed by William Nigh and starring Weldon Heyburn, Inez Courtney and Selmer Jackson.

The park is part of the Bangweulu Swamps, and it is bordered at the east by the Chambeshi River and at the west by the Bangweulu Flats. It has an altitude of 1100 meters. History Isangano National Park became a protected reserve in 1957. It was given national park status in 1972 under statutory order number 42. The park went into decline after being given national park status due to lack of financial support, lack of infrastructure, poaching, and illegal human settlements. In July 2007, the government of Zambia started to take steps to evict illegal settlers in the park under the Provincial Development Coordinating Committee resolution. This was done so that the park could be reestablished and restocked with wildlife. Wildlife There is little wildlife in Isangano National Park and little game because of the illegal human settlements and subsistence hunting by those living in the park.

It is one of the 108 Divyadesam dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshipped as Kudamudakoothan and his consort Lakshmi as Amirtagadavalli. It is one among the eleven divyadesams of Thirunangur Tirupathis and is closely associated with Thirumangai Alvar. The temple is open from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. to 7 p.m and has four daily rituals at various times of the day. The Thirumangai Azhwar Mangalasasana Utsavam celebrated annually during the Tamil month of Thai is the major festival of the temple during which the festival images of the eleven Thirunangur Tirupathis are brought on mount designed like Garuda, called Garuda Vahana, to Thirunangur. Legend vimanam The legend of all the eleven temples of Thirunangur are closely associated with each other. As per legend, the Hindu god Shiva started dancing in fury at this place after the death of his consort Uma due to the yagna (sacrifice) of Daksha. Each time his lock of hair touched the ground, there were eleven other forms of Shiva who appeared. The celestial deities were worried that if the dance continues, it would result in decimation of entire creations. They prayed to Vishnu for help, who appeared at this place. On seeing Vishnu, Shiva's anger was reduced and he requested Vishnu to appear in eleven forms like he did. On his request, Vishnu appeared in eleven different forms at Tirunangur. The eleven places where Vishnu appeared are believed to be where the eleven temples in Tirunangur are located.R. 2001, pp. 470-1 Arimeya Vinnagaram literally translates to the place where Hari (another name of Vishnu) resides.

Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is glorified in the Divya Prabandha, the early medieval Tamil canon of the Azhwar saints from the 6th‚Äì9th centuries AD. It is one of the 108 Divyadesam dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshipped as Peralulalan and his consort Lakshmi as Allimalar Nachiyar. It is one among the eleven divyadesams of Thirunangur Tirupathis and is closely associated with Thirumangai Alvar. The temple is open from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. to 7 p.m and has four daily rituals at various times of the day. The Thirumangai Azhwar Mangalasasana Utsavam celebrated annually during the Tamil month of Thai is the major festival of the temple during which the festival images of the eleven Thirunangur Tirupathis are brought on mount designed like Garuda, called Garuda Vahana, to Thirunangur. Legend The legend of all the eleven temples of Thirunangur are closely associated with each other. As per legend, the Hindu god Shiva in the form of Rudra started dancing in fury at this place after the death of his consort Uma due to the yagna (sacrifice) of Daksha. Each time his lock of hair touched the ground, there were eleven other forms of Shiva who appeared. The celestial deities were worried that if the dance continues, it would result in decimation of entire creations. They prayed to Vishnu for help, who appeared at this place. On seeing Vishnu, Shiva's anger was reduced and he requested Vishnu to appear in eleven forms like he did. On his request, Vishnu appeared in eleven different forms at Tirunangur. The eleven places where Vishnu appeared are believed to be where the eleven temples in Tirunangur are located.R. 2001, pp. 470-1 It is believed that Vishnu advocated Rudra the importance of Dvadasanamems or the twelve Vaishnava marks in the respective parts of the body. Rama, the seventh avatar of Vishnu came to this place after killing Ravana. He made a golden idol of a cow and gifted to a Brahmin from the ashram of sage Dranethra, from where the place obtained its name. It is believed that Azhagiya Manavalar, the presiding deity at the Azhagiya Manavala Perumal Temple in Trichy came to this place at the request of Shiva.R. 2001, pp. 498-9 The Brahmin is believed to have built the temple with the gold he obtained and hence it is called Thiruchemponsey (chempon indicated gold in Tamil).

The RPSGT credential certifies its holder is regarded by the BRPT as fully competent to work in the field of sleep studies. Most RPSGTs conduct sleep studies on patients. Some RPSGTs score sleep studies. Basically scoring a study means summarizing it, so it can be used by others involved in the sleep medicine field. The RPSGT candidate may qualify for the credentialing examination by a variety of paths. Depending on the qualifying path taken, one must work for a minimum of six to eighteen months full-time in polysomnography to be eligible for the examination. As of December 2014 the BRPT listed over 21,000 holders of the RPSGT credential. The credential is valid for five years. To renew it, the holder must earn 50 continuing education credits (CECs) or retake the credentialing exam. Two major sources in the US for obtaining CECs are the American Association of Sleep Technologists (AAST) and the American Association for Respiratory Care (AARC). Certified Polysomnographic Technician In the US, certification is awarded by the Board of Registered Polysomnographic Technologists (BRPT). The CPSGT is considered a transitional certification.

To be eligible for the exam, one must have worked full-time for three months in polysomnography and have taken the AASM A-STEP Self-Learning Modules. The AASM is the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. To maintain the CPSGT, the holder must earn ten continuing education credits (CECs) per year.

The NBRC initiated this credential, in spite of the fact that the Registered Polysomnographic Technologist (RPSGT) credential was widely accepted in the field of sleep medicine. This initially caused conflict amongst various organizations in the sleep field. To earn the SDS credential, the applicant must first be a Certified Respiratory Therapist (CRT) or a Registered Respiratory Therapist (RRT). The CRT applicant must have six months experience in sleep studies and the RRT applicant must have three months in sleep studies. Both the CRT and RRT applicants must pass an examination.

Petersen came from a well off family of pharmacists in Frankfurt (Oder). Her grandfather, the \\"university pharmacist\\" Friedrich Petersen had since 1780 worked at the apothecary \\"Zur Goldenen Kugel.\\" His second son, Karl later took over the business, marrying Wilhelmine (n√©e Dionysius), and Marie Petersen was the first child of this union. Shortly after her birth, Petersen developed a chronically deformed spinal curvature, and orthopedic institutions in Berlin were unable to correct the condition. Upon the death of Petersen's mother in 1834, her father sold his pharmacy in order to devote himself to the care and upbringing of his children. He remarried, and his second wife, Amalie, transformed the household into one of the most musical in Frankfurt. Marie lived modestly and withdrawn and received a well-rounded education, earning her the esteem of her contemporaries. Because of her illness, Marie rarely left her hometown. In 1851 she made one journey in the Harz mountains, the catalyst for her literary activity. A travel letter she had sent to a relative under the title Prinzessin Ilse was published anonymously in 1852 as A Fairy Tale from the Harz Mountains. The story was widely successful, but Petersen's identity as the author only appeared in the twelfth edition, this time published with an additional tale. It was also translated into both English and French. Marie did not live to see the great success of her two stories. She died in 1859 after a slight inflammation took proved too much for her weak body.

He owned a men's hairstyling salon during his time out of council in the 1990s.

First council term (1982‚Äì86) Venneri was first elected to council in 1986 municipal election for the east-end Fran√ßois-Perrault division. Running for the progressive Montreal Citizens' Movement (MCM), he defeated incumbent councillor Rocco Luccisano of Civic Party of Montreal (CPM).Several years later, Venneri said that he joined the MCM because of its decentralized approach to municipal government. See Lison Budzyn, \\"Frank Venneri : ¬´ J‚Äôai l‚Äô√¢ge de la retraite mais j‚Äôai l‚Äôenvie de continuer ¬ª\\" , Journal de St-Michel, 30 September 2009, accessed 19 August 2011. The MCM won a landslide victory in this election under Jean Dor√©'s leadership. Venneri was initially a backbench supporter of the Dor√© administration and served as a city representative on the regional Montreal Urban Community.Ingrid Peritz, \\"Dore, MCM sweep to power; New mayor controls 55 seats to rivals' 3,\\" Montreal Gazette, 10 November 1986, A1; \\"The MICU Chief and Mayor of Montreal GDerald Tremblay [sic] presents his new team in the Villeray / Saint-Michel / Parc-Extension borough,\\" Canada NewsWire, 21 June 2005, p. 1. In 1987, Venneri spoke against Miron Inc.'s plans to continue operating a cement-mixing business near his ward that had long been subject to complaints about noise, pollution, and heavy traffic. Miron's original quarry site had been purchased by the city in 1984 and shut down, but, due to an administrative error, the company later received a permit to build a new factory in the same area. The Montreal executive committee later revoked Miron's permit, but Venneri charged that the company did not immediately comply with this decision.\\"Councillor proposes a deal to end Miron dispute,\\" Montreal Gazette, 19 September 1987, A3; \\"Miron will face court action if it doesn't close, councillor warns,\\" Montreal Gazette, 16 September 1987, A3; Clair Balfour, \\"What constitutes big news remains a judgment call,\\" 13 October 1987, B3. The 19 September article includes the incorrect statement that Venneri had tried to work out a deal for Miron to receive a two-month extension on its cement operations in return for a promise to shut down the site thereafter. In fact, Venneri proposed that the company be allowed to continue its administrative office work for two months while discontinuing its cement operations immediately. The city was ultimately able to take over the site without incident, and the quarry was demolished a year later. Venneri ran as a Progressive Conservative Party of Canada candidate in the 1988 Canadian federal election in the division of Papineau‚ÄîSaint-Michel. As the MCM's constitution prevented party members from running for other parties (at any level of government), he was required to resign from caucus and sit as an independent councillor.\\"MCM splits with Tory councillor,\\" Montreal Gazette, 13 August 1988, A4.

Venneri did not rejoin the MCM after the federal election, and he formally severed his ties with that party in November 1989 to join the newly formed Montreal Municipal Party (MMP).\\"MCM loses two councillors from its ranks,\\" Montreal Gazette, 1 December 1989, A3.

Out of council The MMP fell victim to internal divisions after the 1990 election, and in 1992 the party leadership announced plans to merge with the Civic Party. The merger never formally took place, but many Municipal Party members later joined the Civic Party as individuals. Venneri was among these, serving as the CPM's vice- president in an unsuccessful attempt to relaunch the in during the buildup to the 1994 municipal election.Michelle Lalonde, \\"Leader quits, once-powerful Civic Party in tatters,\\" Montreal Gazette, 29 June 1994, A3. The CPM was unable to find a mayoral candidate, and in August 1994 Venneri helped merge the venerable organization into the newly formed Montrealers' Party. Venneri himself was the CPM's interim president and de facto leader in the final days of the party's existence.Michelle Lalonde, \\"Civic Party planning to team up with Choquette,\\" Montreal Gazette, 29 July 1994, A3; Graeme Hamilton, \\"Tattered remnant of party founded by Drapeau dies Monday,\\" Montreal Gazette, 6 August 1994, A3; Susan Semenak, \\"Drapeau's party disappears; Civic Party name dies in municipal merger,\\" Montreal Gazette, 9 August 1994, A1. Venneri ran for the Montrealers' Party in the 1994 municipal election and finished third against Vittorio Capparelli, who had by this time joined the Vision Montreal (VM) party. The Montrealers' Party dissolved the following year, with Venneri remarking that its questionable financial strategies had doomed it from the start.Monique Beaudin and Helena Katz, \\"Choquette party may pull plug on itself,\\" Montreal Gazette, 19 April 1995, A1. Return to council (1998‚Äì) Venneri was re-elected to Montreal city council as a Vision Montreal candidate in the 1998 election in a rematch against Capparelli, who had left Vision Montreal the previous year and rejoined the MCM. Vision Montreal won a council majority, and Venneri served for the next three years as a backbench supporter of Pierre Bourque's administration. He was re-elected in the 2001 election for the redistributed Jean-Rivard division; G√©rald Tremblay's Montreal Island Citizens Union (MICU) won this election, and Venneri served with the official opposition. In December 2003, Venneri and five other Vision Montreal councillors left Bourque's party to join MICU. This allowed Tremblay to consolidate his majority on council, and in January 2004 Venneri was named vice-chair of Montreal's finance committee.Sue Montgomery, \\"Tremblay gets six new councillors,\\" Montreal Gazette, 13 December 2003, A8; Linda Gyulai, \\"Mayor plays the suburb card,\\" Montreal Gazette, 26 January 2004, A4; \\"Tremblay purges independents: New allies on council named to committees,\\" Montreal Gazette, 27 January 2004, A7. He was re-elected as a MICU candidate in the 2005 election, again defeating Capparelli, who had by this time rejoined Vision Montreal. The Jean-Rivard electoral division was renamed as the Fran√ßois-Perrault division for this election, though it had different boundaries from the previous division of that name. Venneri remained vice- chair of Montreal's finance committee after the election and also served on the city's committee on services to residents.\\"City wages war on dirt,\\" Montreal Gazette, 26 May 2006, A7.

Plot The story of the forty-seven r≈çnin has been depicted in many ways, with each version focusing the emphasis on different parts of the story‚Äîthe rivalry of Lords Asano and Kira, Asano's assault on Kira, Asano's sentence of seppuku immediately afterward, and the revenge attack 21 months later against Kira by the forty-seven loyal retainers. Oishi Kuranosuke, Asano's chamberlain and the head of the 47 samurai, is often the primary character, and his actions are often held up as the epitome of bushido, the honor code of the samurai. In this telling, the emphasis is on the preparation for and the attack on Kira's castle. The immediate reactions to Lord Asano's assault on Lord Kira are shown in flashback, and Lord Asano and the actual assault are barely shown at all. Unlike other versions of the story, Oishi Kuranosuke does not pretend to descend into a life of debauchery, and Kira is shown as expecting the attack.

She studied psychology at university, not history, pursuing research. She obtained her doctoral degree from the University of LondonKathryn Tidrick, Author information at Macmillan, Macmillan. Retrieved 20 August 2011 She has written articles for the London Review of Books, and for the New York Times Gandhi - A Political and Spiritual Life Tidrick's work on Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi's life has received much attention. In her book Tidrick argues that Gandhi's student life in London was his decisive and formative period where he acquired the ideas which would be put to use till his death. This point of view differs from more conventional understandings of Gandhi's intellectual inheritance that locates his ideas in Ancient India. William Dalrymple called her work \\"Brilliant\\" and remarked that her research brought certain unexplored dimensions of Gandhi's intellectual life to light such as the influence of occultists of London \\"she locates the roots of Gandhi‚Äôs thought in the lunatic spiritualist fringe of late-Victorian England, among the occultists, high fibre-ists and mediums who flourished in late 19th- century London\\". Francis Robinson, Professor of the History of South Asia at the University of London, remarked that her study brought to the front the experimental aspects of Gandhi's life in its milieu which was Victorian. Gandhi: A Political and Spiritual Life became the centre of a controversy since Perry Anderson called it the most important biography of M. K. Gandhi in his book The Indian Ideology. Anderson's book criticises the nationalist idea of India created by Indian historians which has made Gandhi into a saint who cannot be criticised.

In the United Kingdom, this term also applies to a field for a general automobile racing competition, particularly Formula 1. Description The saddling paddock at left racetrack In Canada and the United States of America, a paddock is a small enclosure used to keep horses. In the United Kingdom, this term has a similar meaning, and also applies to a field for a general automobile racing competition, particularly Formula 1. The most common design provides an area for exercise and is often situated near the stables. Larger paddocks may have grass maintained in them, but many are dirt or a similar natural surface. In those cases drainage and a top layer of sand are often used to keep a suitable surface in the paddock. In the American West, such an enclosure is often called a corral, and may be used to contain cattle or horses, occasionally other livestock. The word paddock is also used to describe other small, fenced areas that hold horses, such as a saddling paddock at a racetrack, the area where race horses are saddled before a horse race. Horse breeders may let stallions loose in a paddock or field with mares that they would like the stallion to impregnate. This allows the most natural form of mating to occur and the regularity of mating using this method promotes the chances of a mare becoming pregnant. However, high-value stallions are rarely used for breeding in this manner, as uninterested mares may severely injure them.

In 1959 he worked at GTV as assistant floor manager, before becoming assistant producer of In Melbourne Tonight and later producer-director of The Breakfast Show. After a stint working at NBN3 in Newcastle, Philipp joined the fledgling ATV0 in Melbourne (later to become part of Network Ten Australia) producing The Children's Show. In 1965, he teamed with writer John Michael Howson to create The Magic Circle Club, which took The Children's Show's timeslot. Philipp served as the program's executive producer/director. When The Magic Circle Club was cancelled in 1967, Philipp worked as producer/director on sitcom Hey You for ATV0 before joining again with Howson to create Adventure Island for ABC National Television, which shared a similar premise and format with The Magic Circle Club, along with much of the same cast and crew.http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/2768636.html Again Philipp was the executive producer/director of each episode. The program was notable for being the ABC's first co-production with an outside production company (Godfrey Philipp Productions). On both The Magic Circle Club and Adventure Island, Philipp made innovative use of the opportunities afforded by the televisual technology of the day to create previously unseen (on Australian TV productions) special effects to realize the programs‚Äô fantasy aspects.http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/tv-visionary- remembered-20110623-1ghs0.html When Adventure Island was cancelled in 1972, Philipp worked as a freelance producer/director. He directed an episode of Skyways for Channel Seven in 1979. Working for Reg Grundy Productions, Philipp was the second executive producer of Prisoner for Network Ten in 1979 and also directed episodes of the series. Awards and recognition Philipp received a special Logie award in 1973 for his contribution to Australian children's television. In 1979, he worked at Northern Rivers Television to create a new children's program called Rainbow, which was not picked up by any of Australia's national television networks. However his work on this program was recognized with another Logie award. After leaving the television industry in the 1980s, Philipp worked voluntarily for The Salvation Army. In later life he suffered from osteoporosis. Death He died on 21 April 2011. His final years were spent in the aged care residence of Sumner House, Brotherhood of St Lawrence in Fitzroy, Victoria.

It was the official flag of Cambodia for almost five years and it was displayed at the 1972 Summer Olympics where Cambodia officially competed under its new government after a long absence. The last place where it was hoisted as official flag of the state was in May 1975 in the final area held by the Khmer National Armed Forces on the escarpment of the Preah Vihear Temple in the D√¢ngr√™k Mountains. Even though their government had surrendered, loyalist Khmer Republic soldiers continued to fiercely hold their ground for nearly a month after the fall of Phnom Penh.

The Deeside Railway was taken over by the GNoSR and in 1894 Culter was the terminus for the Aberdeen suburban service although a few trains continued to Banchory. Despite the 1937 closure of many other stations on the Aberdeen suburban service, Culter remained open until 1966 as an intermediate station on the Deeside Railway that ran from Aberdeen (Joint) to Ballater. Culter is located in the parish of Peterculter, Aberdeenshire, Scotland.

The 1963 timetable. The 1853 station only had a short single platform on the later eastbound or northern side. By 1892 the line had been doubled and a goods yard built on the eastern side with two sidings, approached from the east. A complex and extensive network of lines lay within the paper works buildings. The goods yard had several sidings, a crane and weighing machine. The line west towards Park from the new station site was not completely doubled until after 1899. A pedestrian footbridge was present, a signal box on the western end of the eastbound platform, typical GNoSR wooden station buildings and a shelter on the westbound platform together with a water tank tower. Crossover points lay towards the east end of the platforms and a single siding lay parallel to the line on the southern side.

Written by Dorrell and Stuart E. McGowan, the film is about a singing cowboy who gets caught up in a war between oilmen and cattle ranchers, taking the side of the ranchers until he learns that oil will bring a railroad to town. The film is also known as Serenade of the West in the United Kingdom. Plot When Doris Maxwell (Judith Allen) starts drilling for oil, cowboy Gene Autry (Gene Autry) tries to stop the drilling, believing the territory's water supply will be ruined. Doris' father, bank president Maxwell (William Farnum), embezzled $25,000 to support the drilling project. Doris and Gene's fight heats up after he shoots out the tires on her car and she steals his horse, Champion. In an attempt to discredit Gene, Doris, who runs a radio station above Sing Low's cafe, broadcasts him on a program sponsored by the oil company. When Gene discovers the trick, he sets out in a rage to find her. George Wilkins (Weldon Heyburn), who is in charge of the oil well drilling, takes Doris to the drilling site and tell her the well is dry and he needs additional funds from her father to bring the well in. Doris doesn't know that Wilkins is actually trying to swindle her father by getting him to pay for all of the equipment while he stalls the drilling. Wilkins intends to take over the lease on the profitable land when the bank's lease runs out. While taking the payroll to the drilling site, Wilkins and Doris are held up by two thieves, who are actually Wilkins' henchmen. Gene comes to the rescue and grudgingly returns the money to Doris, who continues on to the drilling site. Wilkins reprimands his men for getting caught and then lets them go. Doris and Gene return to the bank, where they discover Maxwell has tried to commit suicide after receiving a letter notifying him that the bank examiner would be arriving soon. Protecting Maxwell from embezzlement charges, Gene makes it seem as if Maxwell was shot during a robbery. Sometime later, Gene learns that the railroad will go through the town if the oil comes in, and he informs Wilkins that he will publicly support the drilling. Not wanting any public attention on his operation, Wilkins orders his men to hold Gene captive until after the lease is transferred to him. Gene escapes and alerts the townspeople to Wilkins' crooked dealings. Wilkins spreads a rumor that Gene intentionally swindled his friends by making them buy worthless oil stock, and later tells a crowd that Gene was behind the bank robbery. A mob gathers and goes after Gene who is forced to flee. At the oil well, Gene finds Sam Brown, an oil worker who was shot by Wilkins after he discovered that the well only needed to be dynamited to come in. After getting a doctor to treat Sam, Gene and Frog Millhouse (Smiley Burnette) dynamite the well, despite the opposition from Wilkins and the crowd. Following the blast, the well comes in and soon the oil company, now called the Maxwell-Autry company, is prospering. Gene distributes dividends to his friends on their investment, and Frog, who has been searching for an addition to his butterfly collection, discovers a poor specimen.

The wars began in the 1600s with the arrival of Spanish colonists in present-day New Mexico. War between the Mexicans and the Apache was especially intense from 1831 into the 1850s. Thereafter, Mexican operations against the Apache coincided with the Apache Wars of the United States, such as during the Victorio Campaign. Mexico continued to operate against hostile Apache bands as late as 1915.http://www.aaanativearts.com/apache/Apache_Mexican_Wars.htmhttp://www.theoutlaws.com/indians3.htm For other conflicts involving the Apache see Apache War (disambiguation). War with the Spanish The Spanish first encountered the Apache, whom they called Querechos, in 1541 in the Texas panhandle. At the time the Apache were buffalo hunting nomads and semi-nomads who had trading relationships with the Pueblos of the Rio Grande valley. The early contacts were friendly, but in the 17th century, the relationship between Spaniard and Apache deteriorated because of slave raids by the Spaniards and Apache attacks on the Spanish and Pueblo settlements in New Mexico. The Apache migrated south and west, under pressure from the Comanche who were also expanding southward. Being pushed off the buffalo-rich Great Plains into the more austere desert and mountains of the Southwest probably caused the Apache to become more dependent upon raiding for a livelihood. By 1692, they were present in the present-day state of Chihuahua, Mexico. They soon were also visiting Sonora and Coahuila and seem to have absorbed several other Indian peoples native to the future U.S.-Mexico border area, the Suma, Manso, Jano, and Jocome. Chihuahua, Sonora, and Coahuila were more populated and richer than the Spanish colonies in New Mexico, and Apache raiding soon became a serious problem. In 1737, a Spanish military officer said, \\"many mines have been destroyed, 15 large estancias [ranches] along the frontier have been totally destroyed, having lost two hundred head of cattle, mules, and horses; several missions have been burned and two hundred Christians have lost their lives to the Apache enemy, who sustains himself only with the bow and arrow, killing and stealing livestock.\\"Schmal, John P. \\"Indigenous Chihuahua: a story of war and assimilation\\" http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/374-indigenous-chihuahua-a- story-of-war-and-assimilation A Lipan Apache in 1857. The Lipan were the easternmost of the Apache, living in the San Antonio, Texas, area in the early 19th century. The Spanish response to the Apache problem in the 1770s was to reorganize its frontier defenses, withdraw from some areas, establish a \\"cordon of presidios\\" (forts) along the northern frontier, undertake punitive missions against the Apache, usually with Indian allies, and encourage peace with the Apache. The chain of 18 presidios located about apart in Sonora, Chihuahua, Texas, New Mexico, and future Arizona was the backbone of the defense against Apache raids. In the late 18th century, presidios each had a complement of 43 soldiers, with the exception of Santa Fe, New Mexico, and San Antonio with 76 soldiers assigned to them. The soldiers in the presidios were reinforced by local militia and Indian allies.Weber. David J. (1992), The Spanish Frontier in North America. New Haven: Yale University Press, p. 213, 216 The most prominent of the presidios was at Janos, Chihuahua Schmal, http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/374-indigenous-chihuahua-a-story-of-war- and-assimilation Another, the Presidio San Augustin del Tucson became the most important Spanish settlement in Arizona. The punitive missions of the Spanish against the Apache extracted a heavy toll of lives but were ineffective in halting Apache raids. The intensity of the conflict was at its peak from 1771 to 1776 when in Chihuahua and Coahuila \\"1,674 Spaniards were killed, 154 were captured, over one hundred ranches were abandoned, and over sixty-eight thousand animals were stolen.\\" Many of the Spaniard deaths recorded were probably mestizos and Christian Indians. Apache casualties were also heavy. In October and November 1775, a Spanish military operation headed by Hugo Ocon√≥r in New Mexico killed 132 Apache and took 104 prisoners.Griffen, William B. Apaches at War & Peace: The Janos Presidio, 1750‚Äì1858 Albuquerque: U of NM, 1988, p. 32‚Äì33 In 1786, the Viceroy in Mexico City, Bernardo de Galvez, issued an Instruci√≥n to continue war with the Apache, but also to persuade them to make peace. Military operations intensified, but, at the same time, Apache who voluntarily surrendered and settled at the presidios were treated kindly and provided rations. Another factor inducing the Apache to make peace may have been the fact that New Mexico had made peace with the Comanche in 1786, and Comanche were now joining the Spanish in military operations against the Apache.Griffen, pp. 53‚Äì54 By 1790, most of the Apache bands, which had no central leadership, were at peace with the Spanish. By 1793, almost 2,000 Apache were settled at a dozen presidios, including 400 at Janos and 800 at El Norte (El Paso, Texas). The number of Apache still living in the mountains and deserts is unknown. Relative peace between the Apache and the Spaniards and Mexicans would endure until 1831.Griffen, pp. 139, 267‚Äì268 War with Mexico The approximate locations of the principal Apache tribes, ca. 1840. Most of the raids into Mexico were carried out by the Chiricahua and Mescalero. When Mexico became independent in 1821 the long-standing peace with the Apache began to fall apart. The number of soldiers at the frontier presidios was reduced, as was the budget for supporting the soldiers and the Apache. The key element leading to war was that, in 1831, the Mexican government cut off food rations to Apaches settled near presidios. The 2,000 Apache at the presidios quickly departed, it being necessary for them to resume their hunting- gathering lifestyle if they were to survive. The military commander of Chihuahua declared war on the Apache on October 16, 1831, and initiated military action against them.Griffen, William B., Utmost Good Faith: Patterns of Apache-Mexican Hostilities in Northern Chihuahua Border Warfare, 1821-1848, Albuquerque: U of NM Press, 1988, p. 28 Mexico, however, was ill-prepared for a war against the Apache. The two states most affected, Chihuahua and Sonora, operated almost independently of each other and the federal government. Sonora (which included Arizona at this time) had a thinly-scattered population of perhaps 50,000 people; Chihuahua had a more concentrated population of 134,000 and a better organized government.Griffen, Utmost Good Faith, p. 5Stevens, Robert C. \\"The Apache Menace in Sonora\\" Arizona and the West, Vol. 6, No. 3 (Autumn 1964), p. 213 The Apache tribes most involved in the war, the Chiricahua (called \\"Gile√±os\\" by Mexicans) and the Mescalero numbered only 2,500 to 3,000 people. Neither tribe had a central authority but consisted of a number of independent bands, numbering 100 to 500, each of which made their own decision concerning peace or war with the Mexicans. Bands would often unite temporarily to launch larger forces against the Mexicans, but most Apache raids were relatively small scale, involving a few dozen warriors. The Apache also negotiated separately with Mexican states and municipalities, carrying on war with some while at peace with others. Mexico's problem defeating the mobile and elusive Apache was exacerbated by the rising hostility of the Comanche, Kiowa and Kiowa-Apache who, especially in the 1840s and 1850s, launched large raids involving hundreds of men into northeastern Mexico from their safehaven on the Texas plains.Griffen, Utmost Good Faith, p. 183(See: Comanche-Mexico Wars) Apache raids beginning in 1831 occurred in fits and starts as bands and leaders, most prominently Juan Jos√© Comp√°, who was literate and spoke Spanish, alternately raided and responded to peace overtures from Mexican authorities. Most often the Apache objective in a raid was to steal livestock and other property; but a common Apache modus operandi was also to travel by horseback in small groups into Mexico, rendezvous with other groups, attack a settlement, kill the men and capture as many women, children, and livestock as desired, and then flee toward their homeland, setting ambushes along the way to discourage pursuit. The Apache avoided pitched battles unless they were superior in numbers or had the element of surprise.Stevens, Robert C. \\"The Apache Menace in Sonora, 1831-1849\\", Arizona and the West, Vol. 6, No. 3 (Autumn, 1964), p. 225 However, after Mexican independence the resources and manpower devoted to the presidios declined. In Sonora, in 1833, the state government solicited public donations to bolster its defenses, and in 1834 briefly reduced salaries of all state officials by 10 to 33 percent to devote the money to enlisting more soldiers.Stevens, pp 215‚Äì216 In Chihuahua, in 1832, to supplement the presidios all civilian men were ordered to carry weapons at all times, all occupied places were ordered to be fortified, and local defense forces were organized. By the early 1840s Chihuahua had 1.500 soldiers under arms in addition to local defense forces. However, much of this force was devoted to protecting the eastern part of the state against Comanches rather than fighting the Apache.Griffen, Utmost Good Faith, p. 166‚Äì171 Scalp hunters John Johnson's massacre of Apaches in 1837 took place near here in the Animas Valley of New Mexico. The landscape is typical of that inhabited by the Apache, a mix of desert plains and rugged mountains. In 1835, the government of Sonora put a bounty on the Apache which, over time, evolved into a payment by the government of 100 pesos for each scalp of a male 14 or more years old. Later, Chihuahua offered the same bounty for males plus a bounty of 50 pesos for the capture of an adult female and 25 pesos for a child under 14. Bounty hunters were also allowed to keep any Apache property they captured. The bounty for one Apache male was more than many Mexicans and American workers earned in a full year.\\"The Scalp Industry\\" http://xroads.virginia.edu/~HYPWE/HNS/Scalpin/old/folks.html, accessed 10 Jul 2012. It is unclear, however, whether the scalp bounty was actually paid during the first few years. A famous and often-exaggerated battle (or massacre) involved a United States citizen named John Johnson, resident in Sonora, who led an expedition against the Apache in April 1837. The Apache had raided near the municipality of Moctezuma and driven away a herd of cattle. Johnson gathered together 17 North Americans and 5 Mexico muleskinners, apparently collected expense money from the Sonora government, and borrowed an artillery piece, probably a Swivel gun, small enough to be carried mule-back from the presidio at Fronteras. Johnson found an Apache encampment near the southern end of the Animas Mountains in New Mexico. Juan Jos√© Comp√° led the group which consisted of, according to Johnson, of 80 men plus women and children. Johnson and his men attacked the Apache, killing 20, including Comp√°, and wounding another 20. For his accomplishment, Johnson received a reward of 100 pesos and the official thanks of the state government. With the death of Comp√°, Mangas Coloradas (Red Sleeves) became the most prominent Apache leader.Strickland, Rex W. \\"The Birth and Death of a Legend: The Johnson \\"Massacre\\" of 1837\\", Arizona and the West, Vol. 18, No 3 (Autumn 1976), Pp. 257-286 The son of Mangas Coloradas, the most prominent Apache leader of the 1850s. Photo taken in 1884. Punitive missions such as Johnson's however, inflamed the Apache rather than intimidated them. The rich Santa Rita copper mine in New Mexico was a principal target of Mangas Coloradas and his followers. In 1838, 22 fur trappers were killed nearby and the Apache severed the mine's supply line. The 300 to 400 inhabitants of Santa Rita fled south toward the Janos presidio, 150 miles away, but the Apache killed nearly all of them en route. Afterwards, the Santa Rita mine was only occasionally in operation until 1873 when Apache chief Cochise signed a peace agreement with the US and the mine was reopened.Bowden; http://www.newmexicohistory.org/filedetails.php?fileID-25010, accessed 30 Jul 2012; Cooper, James E. (1975) \\"Santa Rita\\" Ghost Towns and Mining Camps of New Mexico University of Oklahoma Press, Norman, OK, pp. 188-191, In 1839 North American James Kirker was contracted by the governor of Chihuahua for 25,000 pesos to raise an army of up to 200 men to suppress the Apache. Kirker's second in command was a Shawnee Indian named Skybuck.\\"James Kirker, the King of New Mexico.\\" http://xroads.virginia.edu/~HYPER/HNS/Scalpin/children.html, accessed 12 Jul 2012; Spybuck was also possibly a Wyandotte as there are Spybucks in early census reports of the tribe.\\"Wyandot and Shawnee Indian Lands in Wyandotte county, Kansas\\" Collections of Kansas State Historical Society, Vol 15 (1919-1922), p. 116 The \\"Sahuanos\\", or Shawnees, as Kirker's men were called also included Delaware Indians and escaped slaves from the U.S as well as Anglos and Mexicans. Kirker's small army seems to have worsened the situation by killing friendly Apache or groups negotiating peace, after which Apache raids increased. In 1846, Kirker and local Mexicans were responsible for a massacre of 130 peaceful Apaches at Galeana, Chihuahua. Kirker claimed that he had followed the trail of stolen livestock to the Apache encampment.Griffen, Utmost Good Faith pp. 58-61, 119, 171-172, In 1849, the bounty laws in Chihuahua were formalized and strengthened. Apache adult male prisoners were worth 250 pesos each, females and children 150 pesos. Dead Apache adult males were worth 200 pesos, the scalp to be given to local governments for verification. The state that year paid out 17,896 for scalps and prisoners. The law was quickly abandoned as it was too costly and Apache scalps could not be distinguished from those of other Indians or of Mexicans.Griffen, Apaches at War & Peace, p. 224 The punitive missions of Johnson, Kirker, and the Mexican army do not appear to have reduced the scope and scale of Apache depredations.Griffen, Utmost Good Faith, p. 247 Casualties Geronimo's last camp and his warriors at the time of his surrender in 1886 in New Mexico near the Mexican border. It is impossible to come up with an accurate estimate of casualties for either Mexicans or Apache, but historian William E. Griffen found enough data to illustrate the scope of the war in Chihuahua. From 1832 to 1849, there were 1,707 recorded encounters, 80 percent of which resulted in hostilities, between Indians (Apache and Comanche) and Mexicans. Of these 1,040 were reported to be Apache. The remaining 667 were by Comanche or Indians unidentified by tribe. Data was sufficient to total up casualty figures for nine of the years between 1835 and 1846. A total of 1,394 Mexicans were killed, including 774 killed by Apache and 620 killed by Comanche or unidentified Indians. A total of 559 Indians were reported killed, including 373 Apache and 186 Comanche and unidentified Indians. Casualty figures for both sides included many women and children. Additional incidents and casualties undoubtedly were unrecorded.Griffen, Utmost Good Faith, pp. 217‚Äì307 Deaths due to the Apache war in Sonora may have been even higher, although data is anecdotal. A Mexican official estimated that 5,000 Sonorans had lost their lives to the Apaches in the 1830s. That seems an exaggeration although, undoubtedly, casualties were substantial. The town of Arizpe saw its population reduced from 7,000 to 1,500 in a few years because it was necessary to move the capital of the state from there because of Apache attacks. Tucson was attacked several times and 200 people were killed by infiltrating Apache inside the walls of the presidio of Fronteras between 1832 and 1849.Stevens, pp.219‚Äì221 What is clear is that Mexico's capacity for defense was seriously weakened by Apache and Comanche raids at the same time as Mexico was suffering from \\"centralism, clericalism, militarism, and American imperialism.\\"Smith, Ralph A. \\"Indians in American- Mexican Relations Before the War of 1846.\\" The Hispanic American Historical Review,Vol. 43, No. 1 (Feb 1963), p 36 Enter the United States The U.S. victory in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and the annexation of much of northern Mexico in 1848 did not initially impact the ongoing war between Mexico and the Apache as raids into Mexico and in the new territories of the United States continued as usual. Over time, however, the U.S. took the bulk of the responsibility for defeating and pacifying the Apache, most of whom resided in the United States. The employment of friendly Apache as scouts to find and fight hostile Apache was a critical element in the eventual success of the U.S. (see Apache scouts). The last hostile band of Apache, led by Geronimo, surrendered in 1886, although individual Apaches continued with banditry in the U.S. and Mexico for many additional years (see Apache Wars). Illustrating the tenacity and elusiveness of the Apache, thousands of U.S. and Mexican soldiers and Apache scouts pursued Geronimo for more than one year, mostly in northern Mexico, until he was induced to surrender his band of only 36 men, women, and children.

In decision making and psychology, decision fatigue refers to the deteriorating quality of decisions made by an individual after a long session of decision making.. It is now understood as one of the causes of irrational trade-offs in decision making. Decision fatigue may also lead to consumers making poor choices with their purchases. There is a paradox in that \\"people who lack choices seem to want them and often will fight for them\\", yet at the same time, \\"people find that making many choices can be [psychologically] aversive.\\" For example, major politicians and businessmen such as former United States President Barack Obama, Steve Jobs, and Mark Zuckerberg have been known to reduce their everyday clothing down to one or two outfits in order to limit the number of decisions they make in a day. Effects =Reduced ability to make trade-offs= When consumers visit car dealerships, they may feel overwhelmed by all of the different financing, upgrades, and warranty options. Trade-offs, where either of two choices have positive and negative elements, are an advanced and energy-consuming form of decision making. A person who is mentally depleted becomes reluctant to make trade-offs, or makes very poor choices. Jonathan Levav at Stanford University designed experiments showing how decision fatigue can leave a person vulnerable to sales and marketing strategies designed to time the sale. \\"Decision fatigue helps explain why ordinarily sensible people...can't resist the dealer's offer to rustproof their new car.\\" Dean Spears of Princeton University has argued that decision fatigue caused by the constant need to make financial trade-offs is a major factor in trapping people in poverty.. Given that financial situations force the poor to make so many trade-offs, they are left with less mental energy for other activities. \\"If a trip to the supermarket induces more decision fatigue in the poor than in the rich ‚Äì because each purchase requires more mental trade-offs ‚Äì by the time they reach the cash register, they'll have less willpower left to resist the Mars bars and Skittles. Not for nothing are these items called impulse purchases.\\" =Decision avoidance= Decision fatigue can lead people to avoid decisions entirely, a phenomenon called \\"Decision avoidance\\".. In the formal approach to decision quality management, specific techniques have been devised to help managers cope with decision fatigue.. Other forms of decision avoidance used to bypass trade-offs and the emotional costs of decision making can include selecting either the default, or status quo options, where these are available. =Impulse purchasing= Decision fatigue can influence irrational impulse purchases at supermarkets. During a trip to the supermarket, trade-off decisions regarding prices and promotions can produce decision fatigue, hence by the time the shopper reaches the cash register, less willpower remains to resist impulse purchases of candy and sugared items. Sweet snacks are usually featured at the cash register because many shoppers have decision fatigue by the time they get there. Florida State University social psychologist Roy Baumeister has also found that it is directly tied to low glucose levels, and that replenishing them restores the ability to make effective decisions. This has been offered as an explanation for why poor shoppers are more likely to eat during their trips. Stanford University Professor of Psychology Carol Dweck found \\"that while decision fatigue does occur, it primarily affects those who believe that willpower runs out quickly.\\" She states that \\"people get fatigued or depleted after a taxing task only when they believe that willpower is a limited resource, but not when they believe it's not so limited\\". She notes that \\"in some cases, the people who believe that willpower is not so limited actually perform better after a taxing task.\\" =Impaired self-regulation= The \\"process of choosing may itself drain some of the self's precious resources, thereby leaving the executive function less capable of carrying out its other activities. Decision fatigue can therefore impair self-regulation\\". \\"[S]ome degree of failure at self regulation\\" is at the root of \\"[m]ost major personal and social problems\\", such as debt, \\"underachievement at work and school\\" and lack of exercise. Experiments have shown the interrelationship between decision fatigue and ego depletion, whereby a person's ability for self-control against impulses decreases in the face of decision fatigue. Baumeister and Vohs have suggested that the disastrous failure of men in high office to control impulses in their private lives may at times be attributed to decision fatigue stemming from the burden of day-to-day decision making. Similarly, Tierney notes that \\"C.F.O.s [are] prone to disastrous dalliances late in the evening\\", after a long day of decision-making. With regard to self-regulation in legal regulation: One research study found that the decisions judges make are strongly influenced by how long it has been since their last break. \\"We find that the percentage of favorable rulings drops gradually from ‚âà65% to nearly zero within each decision session and returns abruptly to ‚âà65% after a break.\\".
