He was formerly the auxiliary bishop of Manhattan. He is a Slavist, theologian and polyglot, adherent of the Western Rite Orthodoxy.  Life  John Robert Shaw was born on December 21, 1946, and grew up in a small New England town. He came of an old American family, of \\"Anglo\\" ancestry, and was raised in the Episcopal Church. Interested in languages from an early age, he began learning Russian and Greek from the time he was 14. At first, he did not see the connection between these languages and religion, but as he became more curious about Anglicanism, he came to believe that just as the Church of England had broken away from Rome, so in turn had the Roman Catholic Church originated as one of the Orthodox patriarchates but separated and made changes in its teachings. From age 16, his curiosity about these things began to turn into a serious quest for the \\"true church\\". That year, he began immersing himself in everything he could read about Orthodox Christianity and discovered that one of his schoolmates, Dmitry Rimsky, was of Russian Orthodox background. Rimsky's father, Fyodor Rimsky, was a parishioner of the Synodal Cathedral of Our Lady of the Sign in Manhattan, and although he did not attend services too often, he recommended the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia to Shaw and promised to take him there the next time he went. Then, on April 6, 1963 (which was Lazarus Saturday that year), Shaw made a visit to the chapel of St. Sergius in Southbury Connecticut and met Dmitry Alexandrow (the future Bishop Daniel of Erie) who took him that evening to the Night Vigil service in New Kursk-Root Icon Hermitage, Mahopac, New York. That first experience of Orthodox worship made a lasting impression. Shaw spent that summer in Greece, staying with the Yiannouzis family in a suburb of Athens and, surrounded there by the Orthodox Church, made a firm decision to embrace Orthodox Christianity as soon as possible. After attending Russian Orthodox services for most of that year, Shaw was received into the Orthodox Church by chrismation on the day after he turned seventeen, December 22, 1963. Rd. Dmitry Alexandrow was away from Southbury for some time, working with the newly arrived Old Believer Cossacks who had emigrated from Turkey, and John was received into the Orthodox Church by the Very Rev. Fr. Michael B. Draovitch, of Waterbury, Connecticut. For a few months, John attended St. Mary's Russian Orthodox Church in Waterbury, Connecticut, but was soon involved again in ROCOR, and has remained a ROCOR member ever since. After graduation from high school, Shaw studied at the University of Pittsburgh, majoring in Russian linguistics, with a minor in East European history. He graduated cum laude in 1968 and entered Holy Trinity Seminary in Jordanville, New York, where his classmates included the future Bishop Peter (Loukianoff) of Cleveland, Fr. Alexander Lebedeff, Fr. Stefan Pavlenko, Fr. Vitaly Kichakov, Bro. Adam Krotov and others. As a seminarian, Shaw's \\"obedience\\" was at the linotype. He was tonsured a reader on September 27, 1970, by Archbishop Averky. After graduation from Jordanville in the class of 1971, Shaw served as a helper, translator, subdeacon and chauffeur to Archbishop Nikon (Rklitski) and, on the recommendation of his father-confessor, Archimandrite Cyprian (Pyzhov), was ordained to the subdiaconate, diaconate (April 11, 1976) and priesthood (April 25, 1976) by Archbishop Nikon. He was assigned to St. Vladimir Memorial Church, in Jackson New Jersey. On September 4, 1976, Archbishop Nikon suddenly died and Shaw was reassigned at the request of Archbishop Seraphim (Ivanov) to Holy Virgin Protection Cathedral in Chicago, Illinois where he served from November 1976 until March 1991. On the feast of the Ascension in 1984, Shaw was elevated to the rank of archpriest. Then, when a priest was suddenly needed at Holy Trinity Church in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Archbishop Alypy (Gramanovich) (who had succeeded Archbishop Seraphim) assigned Shaw to that parish, where he served from March 17, 1991, to November 30, 2008. During that period, Shaw also translated two books from Russian into English: Vladyka Alypy's Slavonic textbook, which is now published in both Russian and English editions by Holy Trinity Monastery in Jordanville, and Monk Mitrophan's How Our Departed Ones Live, which was published in both languages by the efforts of Fr. Stefan Pavlenko and his parishioners in Burlingame, California. Shaw was one of the delegates to the 4th All-Diaspora Sobor in 2006, and was a member of the delegation to Russia in 2007, for the restoration of communion between ROCOR and the Moscow Patriarchate. On May 13, 2008, Shaw was asked by the newly elected Metropolitan Hilarion (Kapral) to serve as Bishop of Manhattan. After this On May 15, 2008, the Council of Bishops of the ROCOR decreed to send the curricula vitae of archimandrite George (Schaefer) and protopriest John Shaw along with accompanying appeals to Patriarch Alexy II of Moscow and All Russia for the confirmation of their candidacies for episcopal consecration. The Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church confirmed their election (together with previously elected archimandrite Theodosius (Ivashchenko)) on June 23, 2008. Shaw was tonsured a monk at Holy Trinity Monastery in Jordanville on December 5, 2008, by Bishop John (Bƒìrzi≈Ü≈°), and given the name Jerome in honor of Saint Jerome of Stridonium because of their common multi-lingual talents and translation efforts. Shaw was elevated to the rank of an archimandrite by Bishop Peter (Loukianoff) of Cleveland on December 7, 2008, and consecrated Bishop of Manhattan on December 10, 2008, in the Synodal Cathedral of Our Lady of the Sign, on December 10 of the same year. April 11, 2011, \\"in consideration of his diligent service ... and in connection with the 35th anniversary of entering the priesthood\\", Shaw was awarded a commemorative panagia. On May 18, 2011, a vicariate was established for the parishes adhering to the Western rite. Shaw was appointed an assistant of the First Hierarch in management of these communities. On July 10, 2013, an extraordinary session of the Synod of Bishops of ROCOR censured Shaw \\"for his willfulness in administering the parishes adhering to the Western Rite, and in performing various ecclesiastical services not approved by the Synod of Bishops, and for criticizing his brethren in letters to clergy and laity\\", relieved him of all duties, and retired him.

Biography The son of land-owners, after his Agricultural studies at the University of Perugia, he worked alongside his father in managing the family estate, experimenting in the sectors of viticulture, olive-growing, fruit orchards, tree cultivation, and cattle and swine husbandry. In the 1950s he managed the delicate passage from sharecropping to direct management of the family company, gradually moving away from other crops and specialized in viticulture, a choice which later resulted in the opening of Cantine Lungarotti Winery, a winery that from its inception has been based on rational methods and updated, responsible enological practices.Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani, Istituto per l'Enciclopedia Italiana Treccani, ad vocem In 1968 Torgiano received the DOC appellation for its Rosso and Bianco wines, the first of these prestigious appellations to be awarded to Umbria‚Äôs wine production; in 1990 the DOCG was granted to Rosso Riserva (with retroactive recognition to the 1983 vintage). With the collaboration and curatorship of his wife, art historian Maria Grazia Marchetti, he founded the Wine Museum of Torgiano (MUVIT) and the Olive and Oil Museum (MOO) in Torgiano, as well as the Lungarotti Foundation (1987) all of which are aimed at highlighting the great cultural heritage associated with agriculture in Italy, through activities of research, exhibits and publications.Fondazione Lungarotti, The Wine Museum.

MacDonagh was born in Cloughjordan, County Tipperary, where he grew up in a household filled with music, poetry and learning. Both his parents were teachers who strongly emphasized the value of education. He toured with the Moody Manners Opera Company in England and the United States before writing the script for D.W. Griffith's The Fugitive (1910). During the 1916 Easter Rising, he was stationed alongside his brother Thomas MacDonagh (one of the seven leaders of the Rising) at the massive complex of Jacob's Biscuit Factory. Following the surrender, Thomas MacDonagh was court martialled, and executed by firing squad on 3 May 1916, aged thirty-eight. MacDonagh last saw his brother in Richmond Barracks after the surrender. He was initially sentenced to life imprisonment and was sent to Knutsford Prison and thence to Frongoch internment camp, from which he was released in August 1916. He became involved with the Film Company of Ireland. His first film as director was the comedy Paying the Rent (1917), starring Arthur Sinclair and photographed by Brian Magowan. This was followed by the feature Willy Reilly and his Colleen Bawn (1920, at the height of the Irish War of Independence), a historical drama based on a novel by William Carleton and produced by Jim Sullivan. It was shot in the grounds of St Enda's Rathfarnham, where his brother Thomas and Patrick Pearse had founded a school to promote Irish education.IMDB John MacDonagh played the part of Tom the Fool (under the alias of Richard Sheridan) in the film. Some of the actors, such as George Nesbit and Jim Plant, used false names in the credits to protect themselves during those politically troubled times. It was premiered at the Bohemian Cinema, Dublin, in April 1920. He also filmed the funeral of his brother Thomas MacDonagh's wife, Muriel, the largest ever seen in Dublin at the time. At the same time as filming Willy Reilly, he filmed the issuing of Republican Loan bonds by Michael Collins, signed on the block on which Robert Emmet had been beheaded. Buying the bonds were what the subtitle cards described as 'Republican notabilities' including Erskine Childers, Arthur Griffith, Grace Gifford (whose sister Muriel had married Thomas MacDonagh, and who married Joseph Plunkett an hour before his execution in 1916), and Joseph MacDonagh, his brother, Minister for Labour in the first D√°il, who would die on hunger strike on Christmas Day 1922. After making other films in the United States he returned to theatre. From 1920 he managed the Irish Theatre Company's theatre in Hardwicke Street working with, among others, Jimmy O'Dea. In 1921 he wrote the theatrical hit The Irish Jew, about the election of a Jew as Lord Mayor of Dublin, for Broadway, in which O'Dea played a cameo part. This helped O'Dea on the way to become Ireland's most popular comedian. In 1922 he directed some light comedy films produced by Norman Whitten, including Casey's Millions, with Barrett MacDonnell, Chris Sylvester and Jimmy O'Dea, which was critically well received. In the same year he directed Wicklow Gold, from a libretto by himself, with Chris Sylvester, Jimmy O'Dea and Abbey actress Ria Mooney. After working in plays by Shaw for a few years he and Jimmy O'Dea did revues, the first of which, Dublin To-Night, was produced at the Queen's Theatre in 1924. In 1928, this company's first production Here We Are won international acclaim, and in December of the same year it produced its first Christmas Pantomime, Sinbad the Sailor. He subsequently returned to Ireland and joined RT√â as productions director, a position he held until 1947.

He had his artistic debut at the acclaimed and prestigious Spring Exhibition (For√•rsudstillingen) at Kunsthal Charlottenborg, Copenhagen in 1953. Haugen S√∏rensen is a member of the artistic union Decembristerne and the artist collective Gr√∏nningen, as well as Veks√∏lund in Denmark. The post-war and contemporary sculptor has been hailed as the greatest Danish sculptor since Bertel Thorvaldsen. He has received several important distinctions for his works through the years, such as the Eckerberg Medal in 1969 and the Thorvaldsen Medal in 1979. In 1958 he was selected to represent Denmark at the Biennale di Venezia. Haugen S√∏rensen's sculptures are placed all around the world. Early life As a child, together with his brother Arne, Haugen S√∏rensen began to draw and later to model. When he was 15, he trained as a plasterer and potter and then attended the Design School in Copenhagen. As a sculptor, however, he was self- taught.Pia Kristine M√ºnster, \\"J√∏rgen Haugen S√∏rensen\\", Kunstindeks Danmark & Weilbachs Kunstnerleksikon. Retrieved 4 June 2012. J√∏rgen Haugen S√∏rensen has spent most of his life abroad, living in a voluntary exile in Southern Europe. The 1960s he spent in Paris, France and Verona, Italy before finally settling down in the artists' town Pietrasanta in Tuscany from 1971. Despite developing a style far removed from his Danish contemporaries, Haugen S√∏rensen has always been highly present in his native country in exhibitions as well as in the artistic debate. Career After his debut at Charlottenborg's spring exhibition in 1953, he rapidly gained a reputation as a sculptor who crafted works of the human body and of animals with intense expressiveness and realism. His scenes of butchery became central to his work. At the end of the 1950s during a stay on the island of Bornholm, he entered a more abstract phase, experimenting with tiled pipes and other ceramic products, although he maintained elements of the body and other recognizable phenomena. During the dramatic years of the Algerian War, he settled in Paris creating figurative sculptures in bronze from 1959 to 1963. They depict scarred, torn organic forms reflecting a reality of cruelty, fear and sexuality. He traveled widely to Italy, Germany, Spain and Yugoslavia, developing a style which was far removed from Danish culture. At the end of the 1960s, he often created compositions made up of several smaller sculptures, sometimes using materials such as plastic or textiles, occasionally borrowing elements from other sculptors. After an interruption at the end of the 1960s when he turned to films, he returned to sculpture making use of marble, often combining different colours and finishes, as can be seen in his decorative work outside the School of Journalism in Aarhus. Other important works include the geometrical Huset der slikker solskin (The House which Licks Sunshine, 1980) for the Danish Institute in Rome, Dumhedens store flod (Stupidity's Great River, 1995) in Ribe, and Sorg (Sorrow, 1990) for the French University in Istanbul. His later work often consists of large angular shapes with rough surfaces as his three sculptures for the University of Lund (1994) and his 7 meters tall Colossus at the Amager Beach Park in Copenhagen.\\"J√∏rgen Haugen S√∏rensen\\", Den Store Danske. Retrieved 4 June 2012. Throughout his career Haugen S√∏rensen has been rethinking how to work with sculpture, and according to him art is important precisely because it is the means through which society breathes. His oeuvre can thus largely be viewed as a commentary on basic conditions of human existence. Style Since his debut in 1953 he has without any formal training or schooling shifted between materials and modes of expression within the sculptural sphere. His artistic language has evolved throughout his career, but the production has always kept an abstract core within its diversity. He has primarily worked with sculptures even though he is also an accomplished draughtsman. Haugen S√∏rensen's works present his views of the human condition in his own, often brutal style. His reservations about the Academy's approach are evident in his oeuvre's glaring contrast to the generally theoretical approach of his contemporaries. Free of attachment to any given idiom, Haugen S√∏rensen channels his creative talents to depicting his own outlook on life, capturing the basic themes of life and death, love and suffering as the focal points of his sculpture, whether working with clay, plaster, fabric, terracotta, bronze, marble or granite.\\"J√∏rgen Haugen S√∏rensen at Statens Museum for Kunst\\" , ArtKnowledgeNews. Retrieved 5 June 2012. J√∏rgen Haugen S√∏rensens inspiration stems from myriad places. From Francis Goya's depictions of the Spanish peoples suffering during the Franco rule to Pablo Picassos anti-war oil painting Guernica from 1937 and his own memories of childhood visits in the slaughterhouses in the Copenhagen Meat Packing District and readings of Kurt Vonnegut's novel Slaughterhouse Five from 1969. Haugen S√∏rensen studied Gian Lorenzo Bernini's craftmanship and marble sculptures, the Mediterranean crafts traditions and he also took away ideas from his meeting with the abstract expressionist art movement in Paris and CoBrA in the 1950s.

It was directed by Glenn Jordan, who had previously worked with Woods on the 1986 TV movie Promise and the 1991 TV movie The Boys. The film first aired on the CBS network on January 2, 1994. The film was based on the 1982 novel of the same name by Robert Kimmel Smith. The book is an American Library Association Best Book for Young Adults and a nationwide best-seller. Background The film stars James Woods as Paul Clark, Anne Archer as Mary Parker and Melissa Lahlitah Crider as Hilary Clark. Others in the film included Graham Beckel as Charlie, Diane D'Aquila as Marion, Keegan MacIntosh as Bobby and Barry Bonds as himself. The film was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Unlike many TV movies, Jane's House was never released on VHS or DVD, leaving the film to be available unofficially only, recorded from a television showing. After meeting each other during the film project, Woods announced his engagement to 23-year-old actress Melissa Lahlitah Crider in 1997, but their wedding was later called off, and they broke up in 2000. Plot Paul Clark and his children, Hilary and Bobby, are really down-hearted after the death of Jane, Paul's wife. After seventeen years of happy suburban marriage, Paul loses Jane to a heart attack, and is left alone to raise their two children. Paul also runs a couple of sporting-goods stores with his younger brother Charlie. Hilary needs advice on birth control, Bobby blames himself for his mother's having gone away, and Paul sleepwalks through his loss. This is until Mary Parker enters his life. A former tennis star who is now an agent and promoter of active athletes, something about Paul's courtliness attracts Mary, who never had time for childhood or marriage. She sends him Barry Bonds, the San Francisco Giants MVP outfielder, to sign baseballs at the sporting-goods store, and in return Paul sends her a pair of shoes. Soon they meet for coffee, listen to Mozart and have dinner, where they soon decide to live together. This appears to be very difficult as their characters are totally different, and so are their lifestyles. Mary is continuously reminded of the deceased Jane, where the children do not take well to their new stepmother. The film focuses on the struggle to make a new life after the experience of death and grief.

There is neither stalking nor incest, not a single traumatic secret, nobody dies on-camera, and absolutely nothing is explained, sanctioned or abhorred by a lawyer of therapist. \\"Jane's House\\" aspires to a troubled, Laurie Colwin sort of sweetness, and achieves it. None of the story would be remarkable except for the quiet performance of James Woods. After so much raw meat, this is vegetarian James Woods: baffled, decent, tentative, nostalgic, romantic, domestic. As his suffering was sotto voce, almost parenthetical, so his brand-new love is a hum, not a crescendo. Instead of raging, he accommodates. All the competitive edges belong to Anne Archer. In an odd (and affecting) reversal of traditional roles, once they all move out of their suburban memory palace, Woods will be the wife in his second marriage. I'm not saying \\"Jane's House\\" has anything so radical in mind. But in the hesitations of his portrayal, Woods leaves us room to imagine all kinds of things. For once, we aren't bullied.\\" Upon the film's original broadcast, the Observer- Reporter gave the film three out of five stars, also writing a review under the headline \\"Woods, Archer outstanding in 'Jane's House'.\\" The review stated, \\"Two exceptional performances raise the soap opera plot to a higher level. The \\"Jane\\" of the title is James Woods' dead wife, who apparently was a \\"one of a kind\\" person who could do it all. Woods meets Ann Archer, a woman with a lot to offer, and they marry. But it's an uphill climb for Archer to befriend Jane's two children and to overcome the dead woman's indelible image. The writing is never mawkish, and the two leads are so good they almost make you forget you've seen this story a hundred times before.\\" Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three out of five stars upon release, stating \\"James Woods softens his image in \\"Jane's House,\\" a three star love story airing from 8 to 10p.m. Sunday on Channel 2. The intense actor takes a gentler approach to his role as a Long Island sporting goods retailer, still mourning his wife a year after her death.\\" ReferencesExternal links * 1994 television films 1994 films 1994 drama films English-language films CBS network films Films directed by Glenn Jordan American films Films based on American novels Films with screenplays by Eric Roth ","title":"Jane's House"},{"id":"36037585","text":"Gb√©ko is an arrondissement in the Ou√©m√© department of Benin.

The Merchant of Venice: A Guide to the Play, p.241 The film was made on location in Venice, with scenes and characters added which were not in the original play.

The characters in the German retained Shakespeare's nomenclature, but in the American they were given new names sourced from the Italian work Il Pecorone, a 14th-century short story collection attributed to Giovanni Fiorentino, from which Shakespeare is believed to have drawn his idea.

Mordecai, The Jew of Mestri, has a young daughter, Rachela, whom he has betrothed against her will to Elias, the son of his merchant friend Tubal. Rachela is secretly in love with the Signor Lorenzo, a Venetian gentleman - and a Christian. Giannetto is an idle scapegrace who has lost his inheritance and is carelessly living on his affluent merchant friend, Benito, on whom he habitually charges his debts. The Lady of Belmonte, Signora Beatrice, is an affluent widow in the region, whose hand is much sought after. Giannetto visits her and also falls for her charms. The Prince of Aragon is the most distinguished of her many suitors, but she despises him as a vain popinjay. Beatrice is immediately favourable towards Giannetto's suit, but Aragon tell her that he is in fact an idle pauper, and disappointed she reluctantly consents to marry the Prince instead. Changing her mind after, she seeks out Benito to find whether the tales are true; he convinces her that it is but idle slander, and she promptly plights her troth to Giannetto. Meantime Rachela has eloped with Lorenzo, and together they seek refuge in Signora Beatrice's house. Her father and the rest of the Jews disown her; as a Christian she is regarded as dead. Some of Benito's ships have been lost at sea, and when the time comes for his friend's marriage, he cannot defray the costs. Knowing that other of his ships are sure to return in time, he borrows money for him of the Jew of Mestri, giving him a bond for the sum at a month's date. Giannetto reluctantly agrees to this; the forfeit in the bond is a pound of flesh from the defaulter; Benito is confident that he can pay the money in time, Mordecai hopes this will be an opportunity for taking revenge for the loss of his daughter. The time comes for the bond to expire, and news arrived that the rest of Benito's ships have been destroyed. Rejoicing, Mordecai hauls him before the court, demanding his stipulated forfeit. Giannetto, telling Beatrice of his friend's danger, receives thrice the sum from her coffers and attempts to redeem the bond, but Mordecai is obdurate ‚Äì the date is past. Beatrice then disguises herself as a Doctor of Law and comes to the court; initially agreeing to the Jew's demands, when he prepares his knife to the breast of Benito she halts him, reminding him that is he is not utterly exact in the flesh he removes - one pound - his life will be forfeit. Sensing this as an impossibility he desists, and the bond is annulled. Benito offers the fair Doctor payment for her services, but she refuses, desiring only as a courtesy a ring of Giannetto - the same she had herself given him, bidding him keep it always; he reluctantly gives it up.

By tradition, the first son in each generation was called Henry which can sometimes cause challenges for local historians.http://www.streatfield.info He was admitted to the Middle Temple on 29 October 1723. The Streatfeild family owned numerous estates in Kent, including Tyhurst and Chiddingstone Cobham. Henry Streatfeild bought Bore Place in 1759. Upon acquiring Bore Place, Henry chose to lease the attached lands to tenant farmers and Bore Place estate was divided in two, with one tenant farmer occupying the main house (South Bore Place) and another living in North Bore Place. Henry himself chose to live at High Street House in Chiddingstone, later known as Chiddingstone Castle, which he had inherited from his father in 1747.

This however was successfully contested by her cousins, and after much legal wrangling Henry and Anne only received the income from the Sidneys' Welsh properties - but these were still fairly significant.

It is currently abandoned. History Ship Shoal (known as Ship Island Shoal in early maps) is a bar running east‚Äìwest in the open waters of the gulf. The Louisiana State Legislature petitioned the U.S. Congress for a light to be erected on this hazard in 1848, but instead of a fixed tower, a lightship was provided instead. This vessel, the Pleasonton, was named after Stephen Pleasonton, who was in charge of the lighthouse service at the time. It exhibited a pair of red lanterns and took station on December 29, 1849. Pleasonton's tenure was then drawing to a close, and when the Lighthouse Board was formed in 1852, they requested funding for an iron tower to replace the lightship. Design and construction were protracted, and a total of $103,000 was spent before the light was erected in 1859. The tower was patterned on those being built along the Florida shore, with a ring of eight piles driven into the bottom and surmounted by an octagonal skeleton tower in height. The keeper's dwelling was a cylindrical iron house on a platform near the base of the tower. A second order Fresnel lens was provided; during the Civil War Confederate forces raided the tower and carried away the lens and lantern glass, eventually removing them to St. Martinville, but they were recovered at the end of the war. In the meantime the tower was recaptured by the Union and a new lens mounted. Shortly after the war the Lighthouse Board became aware that keepers at the light were becoming ill. An 1866 investigation determined that the problem was red lead paint in the light's cisterns, which was poisoning the water. The paint was stripped and the tanks relined with coal tar. The tower survived many hurricanes, but over time the tower developed a considerable tilt, which placement of granite blocks around the footings in 1896 was not sufficient to remedy. The beacon was automated in 1929 and discontinued in 1965, and the tower abandoned, though quick flashing lights were set on the structure to warn of the obstruction. The town of Berwick plans to move the tower to a park in the town, adjoining the Southwest Reef Light which has already been relocated there, but Ship Shoal Light remains in the gulf for now.

It was released on September 18, 2012. Initially envisioned as a solo project by founder John Connolly, the project eventually grew into a full-fledged band involving a number of musicians that he had intentions of working with, namely Scott Phillips of Creed and Alter Bridge, and Eric Friedman of Submersed. The album received generally positive reception but limited public exposure, as little promotion of the album in the way of touring was possible due to members' commitments to their respective bands. Background After completing the recording and touring for Sevendust's eighth studio album, Cold Day Memory, guitarist John Connolly desired to branch out to a new project in the downtime before working on what would become their ninth album, Black Out the Sun. He originally envisioned doing a solo album where he would play all the instruments and sing all the vocals, much in the same vein as Dave Grohl's first album under the Foo Fighters name, Foo Fighters. However, before really starting on it, he spoke with a number of other musicians who he had spoken with working on material with over the years, and ended up working with them as well. The band recorded as a four piece, with each of the members coming from different bands. Connolly and Vinnie Hornsby had both played together for many years in the alternative metal band Sevendust, as the guitarist and bassist respectively. Eric Friedman had previously been the guitarist for the now-defunct band Submersed, and Scott Phillips is the drummer for Creed and Alter Bridge. Members had other past connections as well. Creed had toured with Sevendust in the past, such as for Woodstock 99. Friedman had worked members of Creed in the past; Phillips played drums for half the tracks on Submersed's first album, In Due Time, while Creed guitarist Mark Tremonti produced the album and played on one track. Additionally, Friedman later contributed to Tremonti's 2012 solo project, and respective album, All I Was. Connolly summarized how the recording lineup fell into place: > ...we said we're just going to go in here and have fun with this. We had a > bunch of songs lying around that we wanted to take in. Originally, it was > just going to be me going in there and doing most everything. The more we > talked about it and the more we got together a game plan and studio time, > the more we kind of started talking about, \\"Hey, Scott, remember ten years > ago when we first talked about doing that thing, that side project? Well, > what are you doing in March?\\" [laughs] Literally, it was pretty much that. > Erock [Eric Friedman] was like, \\"Hey, man I want to get in on this.\\" I had > already talked to Vinnie about doing it, because we knew that [fellow > Sevendust members] Morgan Rose and Clint Lowery were going to be doing Call > Me No One. It literally came together, for lack of a better description and > explanation for how it really happened. It wasn't like I sat down and said, > here is my top fifty drummers that I'm going to go after, here's my top 25 > guitar players ‚Äî it wasn't that at all. It was just us saying, \\"Hey, man, > let's just go in and do what we always said we were going to do.\\" I think > the end result at the end of the day surprised us just as much as it > surprised everyone else. Recording and composition The band began formally recording the album in February 2012. The album was self-produced, and recorded in Connolly's private recording home-based studio. Connolly stated this approach came with both its benefits and its difficulties: > ...being a singer recording in your own house in a neighborhood, which is > very interesting. It was probably the most bizarre recording schedule I‚Äôve > ever been on. Actually tracked the vocals from about 8:30 in the morning > till about 11:00/11:30/noon, somewhere around there, because it was the only > time of the day where I could get complete quiet in the neighborhood. It‚Äôs > either that or UPS trucks or here comes the landscapers down the > street...It‚Äôs a great concept to go, ‚ÄúYeah, yeah, we‚Äôre just going to make a > record in the house,‚Äù then all of a sudden you start doing it and, wait a > minute, turn the Wii off, I can hear Just Dance coming through. And the > landscapers are definitely in a couple of songs for sure. I heard it and we > buried it enough..But just coming to terms with the sound of your voice and > doing it here at home, kind of where I can do it by myself and critique the > shit out of it, it‚Äôs tough when you step out for the first time and you go, > I need to become a lead singer. How do you do that? So I had to really kind > of sit down and do a little bit of homework and figure out what my strengths > were, things I did better than others, what you want to do but don‚Äôt want to > . The track \\"12804\\" was written as a tribute to Pantera guitarist Dimebag Darrell, who was shot and killed while performing at a concert on December 8, 2004 (12/8/04). The track \\"Bring You Back\\" features guest vocals by Connolly and Hornsby's Sevendust bandmate Lajon Witherspoon. Connolly said that the band took inspiration from bands such as the Foo Fighters and A Perfect Circle in a sound he described as \\"sorta heavy, just not real metal.\\" Release and promotion The band had a contest on their Facebook allowing for fans to submit their artwork for the album, with the band choosing their favorite to appear within the album booklet. Similarly, the band held a poll on Facebook to see which song should be the album's first single. The three options were \\"HELLo\\", \\"Watch It Burn\\", and \\"Closure\\". Additionally, a local radio DJ that Connolly knew, also played \\"HELLo\\" and \\"Watch It Burn\\" for feedback. While Conolly had originally felt that \\"HELLo\\" would be the best choice, the band ended up going with \\"Watch it Burn\\" because it received far more support than other songs in both scenarios. Conolly has stated that he desires to perform the album live, but if and when will ultimately come down to the availability of members and their respective bands. Reception The album has received mostly positive reviews. Lithium Magazine strongly praised the album, stating, \\"To say that this band is more than the sum of their parts just doesn‚Äôt seem to cut it. The songs on this disc are, plainly put, awesome! With a natural, un-contrived flow from track to track, you can actually hear that these cats are friends who just wanted to jam, without anyone fighting to put their own stamp on the tunes...Projected takes you on a furious flight, a musical journey that is at once both familiar and exhilaratingly new.\\" The New Review praised the album for being \\"...a quality release worth checking out for fans of early-2000s era hard rock along the lines of Disturbed, Crossfade, Godsmack and Seether.\\" Metalholics praised the album as well, giving it an \\"8.7 out of 10\\" rating and stating that the album \\"...is more than a mere 'side' project or vanity recording. Projected has legs and Human offers complexity and depth you can sink your ears into. This is a complete album one can listen to repeatedly without the need to skip tracks.\\" Jam Magazine stated that \\"All eleven songs on Human are solid, well-crafted tunes that prove to be a great listen from beginning to end. You can really hear and feel this music. Each member made sure to add their own unique signature to the music despite the well-known sounds they created with previous projects.\\" Broken Records Magazine called the album a \\"unique masterpiece\\". The album was Revolver's album of the week upon its release.

It may be described by an equation or displayed in a diagram called a polar plot. The drag polar Drag and lift coefficients for NACA 633618 airfoil. Full curves are lift, dashed drag; red curves have = 9¬∑106, blue 3¬∑106. Drag polar for the NACA 633618 airfoil, colour-coded as opposite plot. The significant aerodynamic properties of aircraft wings are summarised by two dimensionless quantities, the lift and drag coefficients and . Like other such aerodynamic quantities, they are functions only of the angle of attack , the Reynolds number and the Mach number . and are often presented individually, plotted against , but an alternative graph plots as a function of , using parametrically. Similar plots can be made for other components or for whole aircraft; in all cases they are referred to as drag polars. The drag polar of an aircraft contains almost all the information required to analyse its performance and hence to begin a design. Since the lift and the drag forces, and are scaled by the same factor to get and , = . As and are at right angles, the latter parallel to the free stream velocity or relative velocity of the surrounding, distant, air, the resultant force lies at the same angle to that direction as the line from the origin of the polar plot to the corresponding , point does to the axis. If, in a wind tunnel or whirling arm system an aerodynamic surface is held at a fixed angle of attack and both the magnitude and direction of the resulting force measured, they can be plotted using polar coordinates. When this measurement is repeated at different angles of attack the drag polar is obtained. Lift and drag data was gathered in this way in the 1880s by Otto Lilienthal and around 1910 by Gustav Eiffel, though not presented in terms of the more recent coefficients. Eiffel was the first to use the name drag polar. Because of the Reynolds and Mach number dependence of the coefficients, families of drag polars may be plotted together. The design of a fighter will involve a set at different Mach numbers, whereas gliders, which spend their time either flying slowly in thermals or rapidly between them may require polars at different Reynolds numbers but are unaffected by compressibility effects. During the evolution of the design the drag polar will be refined. A particular aircraft may have different polar plots even at the same and values, depending for example on whether undercarriage and flaps are deployed. Drag polar for light aircraft. = 0.017, K = 0.075 and = 0.1. The tangent gives the maximum point. The accompanying diagram shows a drag polar for a typical light aircraft. Such diagrams identify a minimum point at the left-most point on the plot, where the drag is locally independent of lift; to the right, the drag is lift related. One component here is the induced drag of the wing, an unavoidable companion of the wing's lift, though one that can be reduced by increasing the aspect ratio. Prandtl's lifting line theoretical work shows that this increases as . The other drag mechanisms, parasitic and wave drag, have both constant components, totalling say, and dependent contributions that are often assumed to increase as . If so, then :::::::::: The effect of is to lift the polar curve upwards; physically this is caused by some vertical asymmetry, such as a cambered wing or a finite angle of incidence, which ensures the minimum drag attitude produces lift and increases the maximum lift to drag ratio. Power required plots One example of the way the polar is used in the design process is the calculation of the power required () curve, which plots the power needed for steady, level flight over the operating speed range. The forces involved are obtained from the coefficients by multiplication with , where œÅ is the density of the atmosphere at the flight altitude, is the wing area and is the speed. In level flight, lift equals weight and thrust equals drag, so curve for the light aircraft with the drag polar above and weighing 2000 kg, with a wing area of 15 m¬≤ and a propeller efficiency of 0.8. :::::::::: and ::::::::::. The extra factor of /Œ∑, with Œ∑ the propeller efficiency, in the second equation enters because = (required thrust)√ó/Œ∑. Power rather than thrust is appropriate for a propeller driven aircraft, since it is roughly independent of speed; jet engines produce constant thrust. Since the weight is constant, the first of these equations determines how falls with increasing speed. Putting these values into the second equation with from the drag polar produces the power curve. The low speed region shows a fall in lift induced drag, through a minimum followed by an increase in profile drag at higher speeds. The minimum power required, at a speed of 195 km/h (121 mph) is about 86 kW (115 hp); 135 kW (181 hp) is required for a maximum speed of 300 km/h (186 mph). Flight at the power minimum will provide maximum endurance; the speed for greatest range is where the tangent to the power curve passes through the origin, about 240 km/h (150 mph).) If an analytical expression for the polar is available, useful relationships can be developed by differentiation. For example the form above, simplified slightly by putting = 0, has a maximum at = . For a propeller aircraft this is the maximum endurance condition and gives a speed of 185 km/h (115 mph). The corresponding maximum range condition is the maximum of , at = , and so the optimum speed is 244 km/h (152 mph). The effects of the approximation = 0 are less than 5%; of course, with a finite = 0.1, the analytic and graphical methods give the same results. Rate of climb For an aircraft to climb at an angle Œ∏ and at speed its engine must be developing more power, say, than that required to balance the drag experienced at that speed in level flight and shown on the power required plot. In level flight = but in the climb there is the additional weight component to include, that is :::::::::: = + .sin Œ∏ = + . Hence the climb rate .sin Œ∏ = . Supposing the 135 kW engine required for a maximum speed at 300 km/h is fitted, the maximum excess power is 135 - 87 = 48 Kw at the minimum of and the rate of climb 2.4 m/s. This suggests a more powerful engine is called for. Glider polars The same aircraft, without power. The tangent defines the minimum glide angle. Without power, a gliding aircraft has only gravity to propel it. At a glide angle of Œ∏, the weight has two components, at right angles to the flight line and parallel to it. These are balanced by the force and lift components respectively, so :::::::::: and ::::::::::. Dividing one equation by the other shows that the glide angle is given by tan Œ∏ = /. The performance characteristics of most interest in unpowered flight are the speed across the ground, say, and the sink speed ; these are displayed by plotting .sin Œ∏ = against .cos Œ∏ = . Such plots are generally termed polars, and to produce them the glide angle as a function of is required. One way of finding solutions to the two force equations is to square them both then add together; this shows the possible , values lie on a circle of radius / . When this is plotted on the drag polar, the intersection of the two curves locates the solution and its Œ∏ value read off. Alternatively, bearing in mind that glides are usually shallow, the approximation cos Œ∏ ‚âÉ 1, good for Œ∏ less than 10¬∞, can be used in the lift equation and the value of for a chosen calculated, finding from the drag polar and then calculating Œ∏. The example polar here shows the gliding performance of the aircraft analysed above, assuming its drag polar is not much altered by the stationary propeller. A straight line from the origin to some point on the curve has a gradient equal to the glide angle at that speed, so the corresponding tangent shows the best glide angle ‚âÉ 3.3¬∞. This is not the lowest rate of sink but provides the greatest range, requiring a speed of 240 km/h (149 mph); the minimum sink rate of about 3.5 m/s is at 180 km/h (112 mph), speeds seen in the previous, powered plots.

His fourth book, it was published in May 2012 by Collins. Shortly after release, its core contention that addiction is not a pathological disorder provoked controversy.  Overview  In addition to his research, the book is informed by Thompson's experience as a former alcoholic and his participation in the Alcoholics Anonymous Twelve-Step sobriety program.Thompson, Damian. (2012) The Fix: How Addiction is Invading our Lives and Taking Over Your World. Collins. He rejects the brain disease theory of addiction (an example of which is disease theory of alcoholism), arguing that addiction is instead a voluntary and reversible behavioural disorder based on the brain's reward system, namely the mesolimbic pathway. Thompson argues that addiction is universally being fostered by technology and the social environment for commercial purposes, pointing to sugar addiction from sugar-rich foods such as cupcakes, addictions to pornography, video games, shopping, and drugs such as alcohol, caffeine; illegal drugs such as cocaine and heroin, and controlled medical drugs ‚Äî such as zopiclone ‚Äî obtained via prescription or without one from an online pharmacy. He believes that the boundaries between everyday addictions and less socially acceptable ones are becoming increasingly blurred, and also perceives an overlap between them, citing evidence that sugar triggers \\"the brain's natural opioids,\\" and that the brain can become addicted to them in the same way that it does to morphine or heroin.Colantuoni, Carlo; Rada, Pedro et al. 'Evidence that Intermittent, Excessive Sugar Intake Causes Endogenous Opioid Dependence,' Obesity Research 10, 2002. Cited in Thompson (2012), p. 16  Reception  The Economist described the book as an \\"entertaining and informative account\\" of addiction, although written in a \\"waspish\\" style which it considered to understate the seriousness of the issue. ConservativeHome viewed it as an \\"eye-opening, iconoclastic analysis\\" of contemporary addiction. In Wired UK, Milo Yiannopoulos felt its perception of a disparity between the evolutionary status quo of human beings and the overwhelming world in which they live was presented with \\"gentle but terrifyingly persuasive regularity\\". The book provoked a dispute between Thompson and The Guardian's Tanya Gold, a recovering alcoholic. Gold described it as a \\"dangerous polemic\\", accusing Thompson of writing a \\"poison pen letter\\" to Alcoholics Anonymous. The Huffington Post's Rupert Wolfe-Murray also criticised Thompson's rejection of the disease model of addiction, suggesting he was giving alcoholism the banality of everyday obsessions and asking if this was a form of denial. Thompson responded to Gold, clarifying his view that addiction is a matter of choice, and also responded to Wolfe-Murray on his blog, writing that the disease model of addiction should not be an \\"emotional crutch\\". In The Washington Post, James Norton wrote that Thompson speaks in a deceptively casual voice at first, but ultimately brings the reader through a \\"whirlwind of anecdotes, interviews and studies\\", offering an argument with \\"real force and substance\\" and engaging reading material. He felt that Thompson's argument isn't likely to be popular, but is a \\"far more nuanced look at the mechanics of addiction than we lay readers are usually offered\\".

At age six, she appeared in Mademoiselle Magazine, and continued modelling in print-ads and catalogs. After graduating from St. Agnes High School, Madden was given a full scholarship to the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City. Soon after she worked in the photography department of Sports Illustrated. She later worked in the publicity departments at publishers Random House, G.P. Putnam & Son, and Farrar Straus and Groux. She met husband Kevin Madden, publisher of House and Garden, Self, and Bon Appetit magazines, in the early 1970s.  Career  Chris Madden started her own public relations firm in 1976, and then started writing books on decorating and show houses. After her early books such as Interior Visions (Stewart, Tabori & Chang, 1988), Rooms with a View (PBC International, 1992), and Kitchens (Clarkson Potter, 1993), Madden was selected by HGTV as one of their first four hosts.

The current address of the theater is 46 North Orange Avenue, and it is located at the southwest corner of Orange Avenue and Washington Street. The building's current lack of impressive architecture is offset by its significant cultural history. The Beacham Theatre was considered an important contributing structure when the Downtown Orlando historic district was created in 1980 and the building was granted local landmark status in 1987.\\"The Beacham Theatre,\\" City of Orlando, Historic Preservation Board The Beacham was once part of the vaudeville circuit and hosted celebrity acts such as John Philip Sousa, the Ziegfeld Follies and W.C. Fields, whose signature was once visible inside a dressing room. In the eras of silent film and Classical Hollywood cinema, the Beacham was operated as a movie theater that utilized then-current state-of-the-art motion picture technology. The Beacham, as it is currently named, has since been used as a series of concert venues and nightclubs thus saving it from demolition. The Beacham Theatre was once home to the internationally recognized late-night underground discotheque Aahz, a notable early component of the US electronic dance music movement in the early 1990s. History=Construction The former Orange County Jail on the site of the Beacham Theatre The Beacham Theatre was constructed in 1921 by Braxton Beacham Sr., who had previously owned three other Orlando theaters and had served as Mayor of Orlando during 1907. In 1917 Beacham paid approximately $17,500‚Äì$20,000 for the property one block southwest of his stately residence on Jefferson Street after Orlando's citizens voted to pave the road to the cemetery instead of purchasing the old jail. The property he purchased had formerly served as the jail for Orange County since about 1873. With a $200,000 investment, the former jail building was torn down in 1919 and Beacham developed a series of connected building units along the west side of Orange Avenue between Washington Street and Oak Street (now Wall Street). The new building was then known as \\"Beacham's Block\\" and is now known as the Beacham Building. The location of Beacham's theater was precisely where several condemned prisoners were executed by hanging. According to local folklore, the Beacham Building is reportedly haunted. The Beacham Theatre was constructed to have excellent acoustics. The Beacham's auditorium features \\"square columns adorned with feathered capitals that climb gracefully to a high ceiling decorated with rectangles of intricate plasterwork.\\" When constructed, the theater was outfitted with draperies that covered the plaster walls. The draperies had \\"mild tan figures delicately woven into the broad white field with an occasional soft blue figure\\" that were selected by Mrs. Roberta Holland Beacham, wife of Braxton Beacham Sr. The Beacham Theatre shortly after construction in 1921 Beacham outfitted his theater with innovative state-of-the art equipment from the Southern Theater Equipment Company of Atlanta. The Beacham's box office in the lobby featured both an automatic admission ticket vending machine dispenser and ticket chopping machine. A decorative marquee that was unique in Florida extended toward the street and featured an electric changeable sign that flashed the daily program. Two Powers 6B type \\"E\\" projectors were supplied by the N Power company of New York. The Midas Gold film screen was made especially for the Beacham. A medium-sized pipe organ from the Austin Organ Company of Hartford, Connecticut, was purchased and installed at a cost of $15,000. The organ, Opus 1034 with 3 manuals in a center console, 24 ranks of pipes and 24 stopsAustin Organs Database, retrieved October 14, 2016. was played by both Mr. Herman Stuart and Mrs. Roberta Branch Beacham, wife of Braxton Beacham Jr. to accompany silent films and vaudeville acts. Typhoon cooling and ventilating equipment was installed in the theater. The Beacham Building's construction featured numerous fireproofing and fire safety measures. When the theater opened, the auditorium had an operating capacity of 1400. Tunnels from the theater stage trap ran into the basements of two nearby hotels. The tunnels had low ceilings and were sealed during new construction in the early 1980s. The tunnels extended south into the San Juan Hotel, where Mr. Beacham happened to have had an office, and then east under Orange Avenue into the Angebilt Hotel. Historians reason that the purpose of the tunnels may have been either for vaudeville performers to enter the theater from their hotels without being mobbed by crowds, or the tunnels could have been used for the storage and transportation of alcoholic beverages during prohibition as has been discovered at some of the other theaters in the Central Florida area. Vaudeville and Silent film era On December 9, 1921, Orlando's premier vaudeville and movie house opened by showing The Wonderful Thing, starring Norma Talmadge, a Path√© News newsreel, and Buster Keaton's The Boat.Act Two: A Beacham History. 1985. Celebrity Dinner Theater. The Beacham Theatre was originally the only independent theater in Orlando. However, the next year, in 1922, Beacham leased his theater to Mack Sparks of the Sparks Theater Company chain. Beacham Theatre and San Juan Hotel circa 1923. Marquee: The Second Orlando Picture The Burned Crucifix The senior Braxton Beacham died in 1924 after a long illness, and Roberta Holland Beacham died soon after in 1926. Their estate and real property were left to their children, Norma K. Hughes, Roberta Augusta Rogers, Braxton Beacham Jr., and his wife Roberta Branch Beacham. Florida and Orlando were on what was referred to by vaudeville performers as \\"The Straw Hat Circuit.\\" The Beacham Theatre was included on the Alexander Pantages, Orpheum, and Keith-Albee vaudeville performance circuits (later combined as the Keith-Albee-Orpheum circuit). Manager Harry Vincent started several promotions at the Beacham Theatre in the summer months of the mid-1920s that included Bank Night, Amateur Night, and Country Store Night, which was supported by dozens of local merchants. An advertisement for the Beacham in 1925 says, \\"Don't talk about the hot weather. Beat the heat in a Beacham seat. 'Kum Keep Kumfy Kool at the Beacham' is known to many and you won't enjoy yourself until you too get into the line that leads to comfort.\\"What's What, Here and There as Recorded by \\"Bobby\\" (1925) magazine. Theatrical section via LMS, Orange County Public Library. Orlando. Frank Bell served as manager of the theater with organist Herman Siewart and Ken Guernsey leading the community sing-along at open forum meetings that were held for several months during the winter on Sunday afternoons. The Beacham's \\"exploitation director\\" Frank H. Burns often designed and created large elaborate standing displays that decorated the facade and lobby of the theater in order to advertise new film features. The iconic displays that Burns created for the Beacham Theatre were sometimes complete with coordinated costumes for the employees. In 1928 Vitaphone and Movietone \\"talkie\\" equipment debuted during the city's first \\"Progress Week\\" during the last week of August. \\"The queen of the vamps,\\" actress Theda Bara, was in appearance at the Beacham as students from Orlando High School sneaked into the balcony via the fire escape. Sound was provided by two gramophone discs that accompanied each film. Both phonographs were played simultaneously in case the needle skipped during a film. Output could be easily switched so that the film's sound could remain in synchronicity with the picture. William Booth succeeded Frank Bell as manager of the Beacham after Bell was transferred in 1928. The city's \\"Sunday closing law\\" was repealed by voters in 1929 by a majority of only 59 votes. Movie theaters and other businesses in Orlando were then permitted to operate seven days a week. All of Orlando's theaters, including the Beacham, celebrated by showing free films until late into the night. = End of the vaudeville and silent film era = Interest in silent films began to diminish in 1929 and they were gradually phased out and moved into obsolescence. On Thursday evenings at the Beacham for the Bank Night promotion, $200 was raffled with prizes of $50. On Saturday, December 24, 1931, and on Wednesday, September 28, 1932, a brand new $325 Austin 7 Sport Roadster was given away. Vaudeville acts continued touring at the Beacham for several more years until approximately 1933. Homer Fuller served as manager of the Beacham during the end of the eras of silent films and vaudeville. In 1933 following a bitter lawsuit against Orlando Enterprises over nonpayment of the lease for the building that had been originally negotiated with the senior Braxton Beacham in 1924, the theater was closed for almost three weeks. $8000 in back taxes on Beacham's building was due. Beacham Jr. claimed the closure was deliberate and malicious and sued for $100,000. Two separate judgments were entered against Orlando Enterprises Inc. for $2291.67 each and a payment agreement was reached. Litigation was then withdrawn. As a result of the suit the lease was not renewed and Beacham's theater again became Orlando's only independent cinema.Beacham Movie Line Up in September 1933 (April 18, 2013), retrieved February 9, 2017 In the same year, the theater was soon leased Florida State Theaters. Harry Vincent was named manager of the reopened theater in 1933; however, soon after, Vernon D. Hunter became the theater's manager and remained in that role for the next two decades. First-Run Movie era In August 1937 the Orlando Police Department raided the Beacham Theatre. All of the equipment for the Bank Night marketing promotion was seized after authorities declared it to be a lottery. The Yearling was filmed locally in 1946 and the Beacham's projectionist Byram McGee served as an electrician and steward on the film production. Mcgee's wife Lois acted in the role of Ma Forrester and was also the production's wardrobe supervisor. Numerous other local technicians were involved with making the film. The Orlando Story, filmed by Don Parrisher Motion Picture Productions of New York, contained images of daily life in Orlando. The movie was heavily promoted locally and was shown at the Beacham over three days in August 1949. Student ticket for The Robe and the debut of CinemaScope at the Beacham Theatre In December 1949 The Tom Thumb Follies staged radio broadcast performances at the Beacham. When a Santa Claus from the Elks Lodge lifted one young elf into the audience for the last verse, the smell of bourbon whiskey caused her to ponder, \\"I wasn't just sure where the night's polka would land us. Maybe Oz?\\" After an extensive remodel, CinemaScope equipment was introduced at the \\"New\\" Beacham Theatre in 1954 with the addition of stereophonic sound, new projection lenses, and a wider screen. CinemaScope had its debut at the Beacham on January 7, 1954, for a two-week showing of the film The Robe. Vernon D. Hunter retired after 20 years as manager of the Beacham Theater. Walter Colby became the executive director of several Orlando theaters including the Beacham. Braxton Beacham Jr., died in 1961. The box office of the Beacham Theatre in March 1991. The 1954 box office was removed in 2000. During the Civil Rights Movement, the Beacham Theatre had frequent stand-in protests by African American citizens of relegation to lesser \\"colored theaters\\" mandated by Jim Crow laws such as the Florida Constitution of 1885. Reverend Nelson Pinder, of Parramore's Episcopal Church of St. John the Baptist, along with other community leaders such as NAACP Youth Council advisor, Rev. Curtis Jackson, worked with white officials for peaceful integration in Orlando in order to avoid incidents of racial violence that were occurring in other Florida cities. Rev. Pinder organized the church's Liberal Religious Youth group. Rev. Pinder's youth group protests were often joined by local members of the Youth Council of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Each night, activist members of the youth groups quietly stood-in near the Beacham's ticket booth until the theater stopped selling tickets. On May 24, 1962, white supremacists were also picketing the Beacham at the same time as the Liberal Religious Youth group. Orlando police arrested eight teen protestors. The teens were kept in so-called protective custody and were later released to their parents. Following agreements with a biracial committee from Orlando Mayor Bob Carr's office, of which Rev. Pinder was a member, the Beacham Theatre quietly began allowing a limited number of African-American patrons into the balcony for designated showings in 1963. The theater remained racially segregated for African-American patrons until 1965. In 1964 the theater was temporarily closed down while Cinerama equipment was installed. A super-wide anamorphic movie screen was added to the auditorium and the stereophonic sound system was upgraded. Two Norelco Universal 70/35mm Motion Picture Projectors and a small restroom for the projectionist were installed in a newly built downstairs projection booth under the balcony that required the removal of two aisles and several seats. Following the Beacham's upgrade to 70 mm film technology, The Sound of Music had a continuous 14-month run between 1965 and 1966. Orlando's Chamber of Commerce held open forum meetings at the Beacham Theatre on Sundays during the winter months of 1971-1973 under the direction of W. F. Blackman. =End of the first-run movie era= 1990s logo depicting the Beacham Theatre's mid-century marquee. During the 1970s Orlando, like many U.S. cites, was experiencing symptoms of urban decay. The rush from the city to the suburbs affected nearly all of the city's businesses. As an effect of the exodus, each of Downtown Orlando's movie theaters closed. Dick Gabel and John Prine were serving as projectionists at several of the theaters. Following a decline in attendance, by 1974 the Beacham Theatre and Florida State Theaters in general were primarily showing exploitation films and B-movie action films. The next year, H. A. Tedder, who was the Orlando executive manager at long- time lessee Florida State Theaters, made the decision that The Beacham Theatre would cease operating as a first-run movie cinema. After showing a Sunday double-feature of Return of the Street Fighter, and The Scavengers, the Beacham Theatre's manager, McKinley Howard, closed the theater's doors as a first-run film cinema for the last time on September 28, 1975.Last picture Show: Beacham. September 28, 1975. Florida State Theaters remained responsible for paying the monthly lease of $2700 until the theater was sold. Live Entertainment era In 1975 Larry and Sherry Carpenter purchased the Beacham Building from then-owners, Betty Rubles Bray, and Burkett H. Bray Jr. A great- granddaughter of Braxton Beacham, Mrs. Bray, refused to sell the theater by itself without also selling the rest of the building as a package. An extensive $250,000 remodeling and restoration followed that included multi- colored Art Deco revival style graphics painted over the facade and a large multi-story mural of a saxophone and its open case painted on the rear of the theater that faced west and was clearly visible from nearby Interstate 4. Following the restoration the Carpenters opened Orlando's franchise location of The Great Southern Music Hall at the Beacham in 1976. The 700-seat Great Southern Music Hall was a concert venue that hosted approximately 180 prominent national and regional acts at the Beacham. The Great Southern Music Hall was occasionally still used as a movie theater that presented world cinema and classic Hollywood films by film directors such as John Carpenter, Federico Fellini, and Mel Brooks during the week. John Lawson was the acting projectionist and served as stage director for concerts. As The Great Southern Music Hall, only about seven music shows were unprofitable. Nevertheless, Orlando's Great Southern Music Hall closed in 1981 due to the rising costs of hosting concerts for notable musical acts and competition from larger venues. Roberta Branch Beacham died in 1980. Mural on Beacham Theater in 1983 In 1981 Sherry Carpenter, then sole owner, leased the theater to Jeff Roberts. Roberts opened Laser World, a futuristic one- and one-half hour laser light show that featured lasers, sound, ballet, costumed modern dance routines and magic illusion, as well as outer space photographs that were projected onto a large viewing screen from behind. Laser World closed in 1982. Other short-lasting entities followed. The Orlando Sentinel critic Howard Means, reminded readers, that the 1965 installation of \\"then-new Cinerama equipment at the Beacham was the latest testimony to the faith in the future of Downtown Orlando\\" and that, \\"The Beacham had long been seen as a bellwether of the health of the center city.\\" Upon further reflection, he lamented, \\"that the Beacham is simply a microcosm of modern downtown realities.\\" Means editorialized, by 1982 \\"The present state of the Beacham was the latest testament to decay,\\" and, \\"In the way of dying enterprises, the Beacham's reincarnations became increasingly more short-lived.\\" In February 1983 Oscar F. Juarez, an Orlando property developer and Republican Party strategist, purchased the building for $1.5 million. Soon after the purchase, a plan was announced to lease it in order to open a bar and French restaurant \\"with a Georgetown flair\\" that later became Valentyne's Restaurant as well as a new nightclub inside the theater. A vision for the theater announced in 1983 was for a New York-style nightclub dubbed Studio 46 that emulated the spirit of the legendary \\"Studio 54.\\" Studio 46 did not come to fruition but the primordial description of Orlando's very own \\"Studio 54\\" at the Beacham Theater was soon realized a few years later. The theater was next leased by Ellen Hunt, of Orlando, and Roger Lopez, of France in August 1983. Hunt and Lopez opened a cabaret club in the theater named Moulin Orange that featured Las Vegas-style showgirls. Moulin Orange was only open for several months during 1983 and 1984. In December 1984 with the hope of operating an expansion to his dinner theater franchise, a five-year lease of the theater was granted to Theatre Management Corporation of Orlando consisting of actor Tom McKinney and Rick Allen, a producer of the Reynolds Theater. The Beacham served as a Celebrity Dinner Theater franchise location in conjunction with Valentyne's restaurant that was next door from 1985 until 1986. Under new management, Valentyne's Celebrity Dinner Theater briefly reopened in 1986 before the dinner theater venture at the Beacham finally ended entirely early in 1987. The Beacham Theatre was granted local historic landmark status on September 21, 1987, for its historical significance to the community. Between each new identity for the theater and the occasional concert, the Beacham Theatre sat unoccupied and empty. \\"Square columns and feathered capitals climb gracefully to intricate plasterwork\\" in 1991. Despite the new recognition for the theater by the City of Orlando, Mr. Juarez saw the building as a liability with many pleasant memories surrounding it, but with little economic potential. Citing maintaining the building and rehabilitation of the area, he first announced plans to raze the building for an unspecified mix-use purpose and later to redevelop the former Beacham Block with a new skyscraper that would be used as a combination office building and hotel. In 1988 Juarez received two successive approval Certificate of Appropriateness permits from the City of Orlando Board of Historic Preservation to demolish the Beacham Theatre within 180 days. The \\"Bye-bye Beacham Bash\\" was promptly organized by Orlando Remembered and attended by former theater doormen, ushers, candy girls, and cashiers on December 9, 1988. However, Mr. Juarez's redevelopment plan and the new construction of a 20-story office building and parking garage fell through at the last moment due to poor timing. Additional parking could have contributed to a revitalized downtown area, but the market for office space in Downtown Orlando was nearly saturated in the late 1980s and there was a general lack of interest from prospective future tenants. Had the project materialized, Mr. Juaraz would have been required to reconstruct a replica of the original Beacham Theatre facade using original building materials of brick, stucco, decorative tile, and pastel colors. Beacham Theatre facade in March 1991 In 1987 Brad Belletto and then-wife Lisa moved to Orlando from Louisiana. Brad Belletto, then owned a theatrical equipment manufacturing company and had formerly owned Moon Sound, a New Orleans sound and lighting company. The Bellettos, intent on overhauling the music scene in Orlando, were looking for a new venue following operation of a successful club in Baton Rouge. They found the Beacham Theatre and immediately fell in love with it.Long Live The Beacham, Central Florida Magazine, February 1989, p.12. At that time, the Beacham was being subleased to Clark J, a local record producer, and a brief partnership was formed. Late in 1988 the lease for the Beacham's theater was secured by the Bellettos under Entertainment Investments International. Several of Lisa's cousins relocated to Orlando to help out with the task of preparing the Beacham for its opening and Brad's mother Bev tended the bar through the entire duration of the lease. The Bellettos also hosted an annual full-service Christmas dinner for hundreds of the city's homeless population at the Beacham Theatre with food donated by Orlando's high-end restaurants and businesses. The Bellettos planned to use the Beacham Theatre for theatrical performances and concerts during the week and as a nightclub on the weekends. Frank Carroll, served as the managing artistic director for theatre productions and starred in a Las Vegas-style musical revue tribute to Liberace, Viva Liberace, Viva. A \\"Leonard Bernstein opera\\" and \\"an Edward Albee drama\\" were additional production features before theatrical productions ceased. Concerts were coordinated by Mary Ann D'Arpino of Mary Ann Productions, who had an office at the Beacham; Island Productions; Harry Tiyler of Fat Harry Productions, and Cellar Door Productions. Several prominent musical act concerts of nearly every genre were staged during this time.  Night Club era  Since 1988 the theater has been used as a series of combination nightclub and concert venue enterprises. In May 1989 the Beacham Theatre was sold by Oscar Juarez for $1.8 million to a property management firm owned by Longwood businesswoman Missy Casscells and her husband Frank Hamby. = Late Night era: (1988‚Äì1994) Aahz = Brad and Lisa Belletto with other Beacham DJs scoured sources across the U.S. and Europe and traveled frequently for new and rare records. During the Second Summer of Love in the United Kingdom that began in 1988, on Friday and Saturday nights the Beacham Theater housed a discotheque that had a progressive dance music format with Lisa Belletto as resident DJ and lighting control operator and Brad Belletto as operating director. Initially the club was to be called \\"F/X (or Effects)\\"Beacham Theatre Returns! 1988. Brad Belletto. but it opened as \\"Pure NRG (or Energy).\\" The late nights at the Beacham featured DJs, beat matching, rare and obscure dance music on vinyl records, intelligent lighting, and themed decor that at times included original paintings by local artist Rollo. The popularity of dancing throughout the night at the Beacham Theatre initially caught on slowly and many free passes were given out. Soon, the entry queue for \\"Late Night\\" snaked around the block. The transition from handyman special to underground hotspot was attributed to the Belleto's planning, dedication, and vision. The conceptual themes for \\"Late Night\\" were frequently alternated (sometimes weekly) and occasionally repeated. The various themes subsequently included World War III, Aahz, Trancentral, The Haunted Theatre, Egypt, Alphabet City, Psychedelic Babylon, Unity, and Reunion. The all-night dance parties were eventually referred to using the umbrella term \\"'Late Night' at the Classic Beacham Theatre.\\" The Aahz nightclub concept was born after Lisa saw the name at a shop in Los Angeles. The Bellettos and Shayni Howen then created and developed the Aahz concept for the Beacham. Shayni and her team created Aahz's iconic d√©cor which included a painted yellow brick road and a giant paper mache Wizard of Oz head behind the stage. At midnight each night, DJ Lisa typically played Rhythm Device's Acid Rock, at which point the stage's curtain was raised and the glowing eyes and smoking mouth of the Wizard were revealed. Eventually the combined tasks of simultaneously playing all of the music and operating the lights became overwhelming for Lisa and as a result Shayni's sister, \\"Late night\\" veteran Stacey \\"StaceBass\\" Howen, was brought in to operate the computerized lighting control console and promote the nightclub. By the Summer of 1989, Lisa was expecting her first child and still resident DJ. Only two months before the birth of her son she invited Kimball Collins, who was the DJ in the Beacham Buildings northern unit, to replace her and hired him as Aahz's resident Late Night DJ. Joseph Jilbert (DJ Jo-Edd), Steve McClure (DJ Monk) and Paul Campbell (DJ Stylus) had brief stints as DJ at \\"Late Night\\" when they were hired to fill in for Lisa or Kimball Collins. Dave Cannalte was quickly brought in as \\"Late Night's\\" co-resident DJ. At this point, Underground music such as Industrial dance music and Gothic rock was played during Orlando's normal bar operating hours from 10 p.m. until just after 2 a.m. Upon an announcement at around 2:30 a.m. (or an opening at 3 a.m.) that said simply, \\"Welcome to Late Night,\\" mixed New Beat, Progressive dance, Balearic beat, and Acid house electronic dance music began that frequently lasted until 8 a.m. and occasionally lasted until as late as 11 a.m. Local DJ's Jerry Johnson (the Reverend), Andy Hughes, Jay Skinner, Robby Clark, Troy Davis, Eddie Pappa (DJ Icey) and DJ Lisa Belletto were occasional guests for special events such as the \\"DJ Unity for the World\\" dance party in December 1991. 1991 Return of AAHZ flyer Dave Cannalte and Kimball Collins, and Stace presided over and further developed an ever-growing local scene. Chris Fortier later joined the duo of Kimball and Dave Cannalte as an Aahz resident DJ. As it evolved, \\"Late Night\\" boosted the careers of numerous DJs and producers such as Andy Hughes, Jimmy Van M, AK1200, DJ Icey, DJ Baby Anne, Sean Cusick, and Cosmic Baby, as well as Dave Seaman, Sasha and John Digweed. The use of psychedelic drugs such as ecstasy and LSD at the Beacham Theatre during the late 1980s and early 1990s was prevalent and eventually began to attract the attention of law enforcement agencies. After \\"warnings\\" about increased surveillance of the Beacham that allegedly came from the Drug Enforcement Administration, additional security, pat-downs, new restrictions on reentering, attire, and the behavior for patrons were implemented. Once, during the early 1990s, \\"Late Night\\" was raided by masked agents of the Metropolitan Bureau of Investigation who temporarily stopped the music and turned on the lights while they searched for and detained a suspect. The final all-night Aahz-themed events (The Return of Aahz) were held at the Beacham between September 7, 1991, and July 4, 1992, and lasted until Dekko's opened. However, \\"Aahz\\" was the theme that really stuck with patrons and among participants is still used as a nickname for \\"Late Night\\" reunion tour events and even for the Beacham Theatre itself. \\"Lift\\" night soon commenced in the Beacham Building's north-most unit, then called Barbarella's. The Beacham Building's north-most corner unit was once called Beach Club where Kimball Collins was resident DJ in the mid-1980s. \\"Late Night\\" in the Beacham Theatre returned when Unity presented \\"Welcome (Back) to Late Night\\" on October 30, 1993. \\"Late Night's\\" Reunion at the Beacham was then initiated at Dekko's. 1992 Death of AAHZ flyer =Cultural impact= The early mornings at the Beacham Theatre kick started Orlando's own Summer of Love between 1991 and 1992 that helped usher in the increased popularity of the subculture surrounding electronic dance music in Florida and subsequently in the United States. \\"Late Night\\" organized several music festivals that were held at the Orange County Convention Center such as the \\"Infonet\\" DJ spinoff on October 24, 1992, the \\"Infonet 2\\" dance party on December 31, 1992, and \\"Infonet 3,\\" \\"The Underground Explosion,\\" on July 3, 1993. Subsequent large-event promoters failed to emulate the spirit of those events. Although, \\"raves\\" per se were not held in the Theater, the Beacham served as the prototype for nearly all of the larger so-called rave-oriented nightclubs that followed it. In doing so, \\"Late Night\\" at the Beacham Theatre inspired the genesis of the internationally recognized \\"Orlando Sound\\" genre that is also known as Florida breaks. =End of the Late Night and Live Entertainment eras= Inside \\"Late Night\\" at the Beacham was always very dark and the auditorium was absolutely filthy. In contrast, initially the scene's \\"vibe\\" was pure and drugs such as MDMA that were available were relatively unadulterated. As time went on, the beloved Beacham was beautified and remodeled into Dekko's. While the Beacham itself was cleaned up, the overall \\"vibe\\" of Orlando's scene seemed to darken somewhat just as the quality of club drugs that were still available during that time became tainted. During the summer of 1994, at a \\"Late Night\\" event featuring a guest appearance DJ Sasha, two female revelers who were attending a Reunion event at the Beacham Theatre collapsed just before sunrise. The women were carried outside to Orange Avenue in front of Dekko's where CPR was administered by an Orlando Police Department officer and paramedics were dispatched. Tragically, one of the young women expired. The Orlando Sentinel reported the May 1, 1994, passing of 20-year old Teresa Schwartz and that the other young woman was briefly in critical condition. However, she promptly recovered. Substance abuse, related cardiac arrhythmia, or hyperthermia was the suspected cause of death. The incident along with those at other venues in Orlando, shocked the underground dance club scene in Central Florida and were followed by a dramatic decrease in attendance. \\"Late Night's\\" organizers made the responsible decision to end Reunion at Dekko's after their pleas for young club-goers to practice moderation were ignored. The Dekko's concept was sold to a competitor in the following months. 2016 AAHZ Reunion On Saturday nights during 1995 \\"Late Night\\" briefly resumed in The Club at Firestone with DJ Robby Clark Kimball Collins, Dave Cannalte, StaceBass and friends. However, the City of Orlando subsequently created a \\"Rave Review Task Force\\" in 1997 and later passed a local ordinance that contributed to Florida's crackdown on after-hours nightclubs. Central Florida's crackdown led to the eventual passage of an \\"anti-rave\\" law in Florida that ultimately led to the signing of national Anti-Rave legislation. The Aahz Reunion Tour launched in 1998 and as of 2019, reunions of Aahz \\"Late Night\\" occur nearly biannually and are frequently held in the Beacham Theatre. \\"Late Night\\" reunions, however, now end promptly before 2:30 a.m. =Night Club exclusive use era= By 1992 the future looked brighter for the Beacham Theatre when Mike Berry, staff writer, for The Orlando Sentinel wrote that, \\"The Beacham Theatre is the latest testament to reincarnation.\\" Concerts were no longer being held in the auditorium during this time period and the Beacham Theatre was used exclusively as night club through 2010. It was 1992 when Orlando Attorney Mark NeJame leased the Beacham Theatre with the option to match the purchase price of any prospective buyers. The Beacham underwent restoration at a cost of in excess of $1,000,000. NeJame then opened \\"Dekko's,\\" a mainstream \\"high-energy dance club.\\" \\"Dekko's\\" is an amalgam of Deco and Gekko. The \\"Dekko's\\" concept featured a rose-beige exterior with a newly restored Art Deco inspired facade with red neon lighting. Dekko's interior included extensive use of the color purple and a sushi bar in the balcony. The inclusion of a terrarium (vivarium) with live subtropical geckos was planned. \\"Dekko's\\" was open from late 1992 until the \\"high-energy dance club\\" concept was bought out in 1994 by Bill Harmening who operated The Edge, a competing nightclub. \\"Zuma Beach Club\\" followed Dekko's and opened in 1994. The recently remodeled auditorium was gutted for the change. Redecoration was complete with fishing nets, galvanized watering troughs for beer, and warning signs for sharks. On February 22, 1995, NeJame entered a new partnership with George Maltezos, John SanFelippo and brother, Joseph SanFelippo. Zuma Beach was often described by NeJame as \\"the cheesiest club in America.\\" Rolling Stone in 1997 described Zuma Beach as a \\"cheesy dive.\\" Zuma Beach even hosted an Extreme Championship Wrestling \\"hardcore\\" professional wrestling match on January 29, 2000. Mercifully, \\"Zuma Beach\\" closed its doors in late 2000. Finally, after yet another remodeling of the auditorium, \\"Tabu opened in 2001.\\" Initially, Tabu was more of an upscale nightclub. Backstreet Boy Howie Dorough, who performed his first musical at the Beacham as one of the Munchkins in the Lollipop Guild for a theatre production of The Wizard of Oz, was a design and talent acquisition advisor for Tabu. However, Tabu later became more mainstream. Tabu had a weekly lineup presentation that with the exception of hosting live music, was similar to the theater's current nightclub iteration. Tabu closed in late 2010 when Mark NeJame and Joseph SanFelippo left the partnership. =Return of Live Entertainment= Beacham logo In 2011 leases for the Beacham Theatre were renewed by John SanFelippo and George Maltezos, along with Gerard Mitchell and Michael McRaney, who leased the adjacent unit. Their partnership is named 46/54 North Orange Ave, LLC, and both units are leased from building owners Margaret Casscells and Frank Hamby, of Beacham Theater, LLC. left Since 2011 \\"The Beacham\\" nightclub has operated in partnership with \\"The Social,\\" a smaller venue next door at 54 North Orange Avenue. The venues, are connected via a passage and door. The Beacham features disc jockey entertainment and plays Hip hop, Top 40, Latin music, and Reggaeton.\\" The Live Entertainment era currently continues on stages at both The Beacham and partner The Social. Prominent national and international musical acts perform with fidelity to the countless shows by numerous acts that have previously held performances in the Beacham Theatre from the mid-1970s through the early-1990s. Description Beacham's Building is divided into seven rental units using wood frame, brick walls, different facades, and paint. The theater is the south-most unit. The two-story Beacham Theatre was constructed in 1921 in a simple 20th Century Commercial Style. The structure is constructed of reinforced concrete and brick with stucco out-surface. Utilization of wood in the construction was minimized. Historical The facade was decorated with multi-colored tile trim and impregnated with seashell. The first story originally contained two small storefronts, a boxoffice, and lobby entrance to the theater as well the auditorium, stage, dressing rooms, staff restrooms, and a green room. The second story of the theater contained restrooms, windowed offices, a projection booth, and balcony seating section as well as additional dressing rooms accessible by a spiral staircase. Above the stage was the fly system and catwalk.  Modifications  In 1936 Art Deco styling with Mediterranean- style tile was added to the facade and extensive neon lighting was installed the on the entrance overhang. Inside, the theater was modernized to provide lighted stairs, air conditioning into the dressing rooms, an enlarged auditorium, and improved seating. Capacity was reduced to 1,051. To diminish echoes from the projectors and recorded sound equipment, the auditorium was carpeted with a floral pattern and the plaster walls were covered with an Ozite material. Vernon Hunter oversaw the modernization. Beacham Theatre upstairs offices in March 1991. In 1954 the look of the theater was modernized once again with the removal of parapets, cornices, and windows. The marquee was replaced with a new porcelain one. The lobby was enclosed with glass doors and the boxoffice was moved to the right side of the lobby exterior and rebuilt. An entirely new stucco sheeting was installed over the facade, a wide screen was installed, and new decorations and push-back seats were added with additional alterations to the floor plan and seating areas. Capacity was reduced to 650. In 1964 the proscenium was modified to accommodate the installation of Cinerama widescreen. A new projection room was constructed under the balcony to accommodate 70-mm projectors. By 1975 the theater was no longer being used as a feature cinema. For the 1976 opening of the Great Southern Music Hall, the theater's interior and stage were remodeled, the proscenium was rebuilt, balcony seating was added. The facade was repainted with Art Deco graphics and a large mural was painted on the back of the theater. Capacity was increased to 765. The balcony was remodeled in March 1991 revealing the theater's original 35 mm film projection port. The balcony was extended in 1981. In 1984 the theater cinema's 765 seats were removed and sold and the sloped auditorium floor was terraced. Buffet dinner tables for 400 and balcony tables for 100 were added. The backstage area was remodeled, and the balcony was restored back to its original shape. Exterior drainage was improved. The degraded ceiling plasterwork was repaired and repainted, the roof was replaced and wiring were upgraded in 1988. External air conditioning was being pumped in. By 1991 the balcony was renovated and re-extended and the 70 mm film projection room under the balcony had been removed and the air conditioning repaired. Opera boxes were installed on the second floor of either side of the stage and the DJ booth was relocated shortly thereafter. Facade restoration proposal for the Beacham Theatre As the Beacham was renovated to become Dekkos's in 1992, it was discovered that the stucco sheeting that was installed during a modernization in 1954 could not be economically removed without severely damaging the original facade underneath. Restoration plans for the facade had to be modified. An arched molding was then added to the facade. A sunburst and red neon lighting was subsequently added. Following an effort to \\"bring back the aesthetics of the old Beacham Theatre,\\" in 2000 owners restored the Beacham's ornate plaster ceiling moldings, facade, and marquee. In addition, the sloping theater floor was made level and the stage was elevated. The original Beacham Theatre sign is awaiting restoration and is being stored on the roof. Around 2005, the facade was modified by removing a small semi-circular molding in front of the sunburst. The points of the sunburst were also removed leaving a large semi- circular molding and larger arch above it decorating the facade. Beacham Theatre's facade was in poor condition between 2014 and 2016. =Recent Changes= The balcony and upstairs areas were remodeled in 2011 with a beautifully painted ceiling and the addition of two chandeliers. Restrooms were installed in place of the theater's original office area and 35 mm film projection booth. During the summer months of 2016 the crumbling arched molding was removed from the facade. The facade was then repaired and repainted and new red and blue neon lighting was installed. As of 2019, the theater's ornate plaster ceilings are in a state of disrepair with the decorative ceiling concealed behind a black cloth barrier that can retain any pieces of plaster that might fall. Two skyboxes were added in 2019. Further restoration in the near future is in a discussion and planning stage. In October 2019 Orlando's Historic Preservation Board approved a major makeover for the entire Beacham block was announced. The construction effort is planned to last one year with a completion date near the centennial anniversary of the building. The theaters facade will be reconstructed with styling elements from the 1920s, 30s, and 40s.

Plans to enter the Indian market were delayed for several years, due to high tariffs and emissions regulations. The pollution regulations have recently changed, but the tariff problem is yet unresolved. In 2007, U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab and the Minister for Commerce and Industry of India, Kamal Nath, had agreed that Harley- Davidson motorcycles will be allowed access to the Indian market in exchange for the export of Indian mangoes. One Indian commentator called this \\"mango diplomacy.\\" However, India had not specified emission standards for motorcycles over 500 cc displacement, effectively prohibiting the import of Harley-Davidsons, along with most models of other manufacturers. Plans to export to India were also held up by import duties of 60% and taxes of 30%, which effectively doubled the sale price. A Harley-Davidson spokesman said the company thinks demand is high enough to overcome the tariffs, and (then) chief operating officer Matthew Levatich said they would continue to push for lower tariffs. Levatich has since been promoted to chief executive officer. Harley- Davidson is introducing 12 models in India from the range of five motorcycle families, namely Sportster, Dyna, VRSC, Softail and CVO. The motorcycles are completely built units and will be imported to India, thus attracting a tax over 100% in the price range of 695,000 rupees and 3,495,000 rupees ex- showroom. The bookings might start from April 2010 and the motorcycle delivery will commence from June 2010. To begin with, Harley-Davidson would have five dealerships (Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Chandigarh) with the aim of increasing the dealerships to more than 20 in the next five years.Harley- Davidson India Intros Motorcycle Lineup MotorcycleUSA.com In November 2010, Harley-Davidson said that it will start an assembly facility for complete knock down (CKD) kits of its motorcycles in India by the first half of 2011, making it only the second CKD facility outside the US. In 2014 Harley began production of their Harley-Davidson Street 500 and 750 models in India for domestic sales and export. On September 24,2020 Harley Davidson announced that it would discontinue its sales and manufacturing operations in India due to weak demand and sales. The move involves $75million in restructuring costs, 70 layoffs and the closure of its Bawal plant in northern India.

Inventory management challenges  Every company has the challenge of matching its supply volume to customer demand. How well the company manages this challenge has a major impact on its profitability.Yogesh Malik, Alex Niemeyer, and Brian Ruwadi, ‚ÄúBuilding the supply chain of the future,‚Äù McKinsey Quarterly, January 2011. In contrast to the traditional \\"binge and purge\\" inventory cycle in which companies over-purchase product to prepare for possible demand spikes and then discards extra product, inventory optimization seeks to more efficiently match supply to expected customer demand. APQC Open Standards data shows that the median company carries an inventory of 10.6 percent of annual revenues as of 2011. The typical cost of carrying inventory is at least 10.0 percent of the inventory value. So the median company spends over 1 percent of revenues carrying inventory, although for some companies the number is much higher.Marisa Brown, ‚ÄúInventory Optimization: Show Me the Money,‚Äù Supply Chain Management Review, July 19, 2011. Also, the amount of inventory held has a major impact on available cash. With working capital at a premium, it‚Äôs important for companies to keep inventory levels as low possible and to sell inventory as quickly as possible.William Brandel, ‚ÄúInventory Optimization Saves Working Capital in Tough Times,‚Äù Computerworld, August 24, 2009. When Wall Street analysts look at a company‚Äôs performance to make earnings forecasts and buy and sell recommendations, inventory is always one of the top factors they consider.Dan Gilmore, ‚ÄúSupply Chain News: What is Inventory Optimization?,‚Äù Supply Chain Digest, August 28, 2008. Studies have shown a 77 percent correlation between overall manufacturing profitability and inventory turns.Vijay Sangam, ‚ÄúInventory Optimization,‚Äù Supply Chain World Blog, September 2, 2010. The challenge of managing inventory is increased by the ‚ÄúLong Tail‚Äù phenomenon which is causing a greater percentage of total sales for many companies to come from a large number of products, each with low sales frequency.Dan Gilmore, ‚ÄúSupply Chain News: What is Inventory Optimization?,‚Äù Supply Chain Digest, August 28, 2008. Shorter and more frequent product cycles which are required to meet the needs of more sophisticated markets create the need to manage supply chains containing more products and parts.William Brandel, \\"Inventory Optimization Saves Working Capital in Tough Times,‚Äù Computerworld, August 24, 2009. Hence, businesses need to understand how this affects their inventory and how they can seize the opportunities presented by such products. At the same time, planning frequencies and time-buckets are moving from monthly/weekly to daily and the number of managed stocking locations from dozens in distribution centers to hundreds or thousands at the points of sale (POS). This leads to a large number of time series with a high level of demand volatility.P.J. Jakovljevic, ‚ÄúA Modern Tale of Long (Supply Chain) Tails ‚Äî Part I,‚Äù Technical Evaluation Centers Blog, July 2009. This explains one of the main challenges in managing modern supply chains, the so-called ‚Äúbullwhip effect‚Äù, which often causes small changes in actual demand to cause a much larger change in perceived demand, which in turn can mislead companies to make bigger changes in inventory than are really necessary.‚ÄúBullwhip Effect in Supply Chain,‚Äù World News.  Non-optimized approach  Without inventory optimization, companies commonly set inventory targets using rules of thumb or single stage calculations. Rules of thumb normally involve setting a number of days of supply as a coverage target. Single stage calculations look at a single item in a single location and calculate the amount of inventory required to meet demand.Sean P. Willems, ‚ÄúHow Inventory Optimization Opens Pathways to Profitability,‚Äù Supply Chain Management Review, March/April 2011.  Deterministic vs. stochastic  Inventory optimization models can be either deterministic‚Äîwith every set of variable states uniquely determined by the parameters in the model ‚Äì or stochastic‚Äîwith variable states described by probability distributions.Leslie Hansen Harps, ‚ÄúOptimizing Your Supply Chain: A Model Approach,‚Äù Inbound Logistics, April 2003. Stochastic optimization takes supply uncertainty into account that, for example, 6 percent of orders from an overseas supplier are 1‚Äì3 days late, 1 percent are 4‚Äì6 days late, 5 percent are 7‚Äì14 days late and 8 percent are more than 14 days late.‚ÄúAre Your Inventory Management Practices Outdated,‚Äù AberdeenGroup, March 1, 2005. Stochastic optimization also accounts for demand volatility which is a top priority among the challenges faced by supply chain professionals.Tim Payne, ‚ÄúMagic Quadrant for Supply Chain Planning for Process Automation,‚Äù Gartner Research, ID Number G00200934. September 3, 2010. For example, management predicts a 65 percent probability of selling 500 units, a 20 percent probability of selling 400 units and a 15 percent probability of selling 600 units. High service levels can be achieved with cost overruns, excessive inventory and firefighting, but higher profitability can be achieved by understanding the sources of volatility and planning appropriately. The result is a better understanding of the inventory requirements than with a deterministic approach.‚ÄúAre Your Inventory Management Practices Outdated,‚Äù AberdeenGroup, March 1, 2005.  Single vs. multi-echelon  Single-echelon location problems are single-type problems such that either the material flow coming out or the material flow entering the facilities to be located is negligible. In multiple-echelon problems, both inbound and outbound commodities are relevant. This is the case, for example, when distribution centers (DCs) have to be located taking into account both the transportation cost from plants to DCs and the transportation cost from DCs to customers. In multiple-echelon problems, constraints aiming at balancing inbound and outbound flows have to be considered.Introduction to Logistics Systems Planning and Control - Gianpaolo Ghiani, Gilbert Laporte, Roberto Musmanno http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/book/10.1002/0470014040 A sequential single- echelon approach forecasts demand and determines required inventory for each echelon separately. Multi-echelon inventory optimization determines the correct levels of inventory across the network based on demand variability at the various nodes and the performance (lead time, delays, service level) at the higher echelons.Noha Tohamy, ‚ÄúA User Guide to Network Design and Inventory Optimization Solutions,‚Äù Gartner Research, Publication Number G00209211, December 8, 2010. Multi-echelon inventory optimization looks at inventory levels holistically across the supply chain while taking into account the impact of inventories at any given level or echelon on other echelons. For example, if the product sold in a retailer‚Äôs outlet is received from one of its distribution centers, the distribution center represents one echelon of the supply chain and the outlet another one. It should be clear that the amount of stock needed at the outlets is a function of the service received from the distribution center. The better the service that is provided upstream, the smaller the protection that is needed downstream. The goal of multi-echelon inventory optimization is to continually update and optimize safety stock levels across all of these echelons.Dan Gilmore, ‚ÄúSupply Chain News: What is Inventory Optimization?,‚Äù Supply Chain Digest, August 28, 2008. Multi-echelon inventory optimization represents the state of the art approach to optimize inventory across the end to end supply chain. Modeling multiple stages allows other types of inventory, including cycle stock and prebuild along with safety stock due to time phased demands, to be accurately predicted. As part of inventory optimization, supplier performance, customer service and internal asset metrics should be continuously monitored to enable continuous improvement.‚ÄúInventory Optimization: Balancing the Asset versus Service Tradeoff,‚Äù APQC Best Practices Report, 2011.  Benefits  Companies have achieved financial benefits by employing inventory optimization. A study by IDC Manufacturing Insights found that many organizations that utilized inventory optimization reduced inventory levels by up to 25 percent in one year and enjoyed a discounted cash flow above 50 percent in less than two years.William Brandel, \\"Inventory Optimization Saves Working Capital in Tough Times,‚Äù Computerworld, August 24, 2009. Electrocomponents, a United Kingdom based world‚Äôs largest distributor of electronics and maintenance products, increased profits by ¬£36 million by using inventory optimization to achieve higher service levels while reducing inventory.Sarah Lafferty, ‚ÄúHandling Volatile Demand,‚Äù Supply Chain Movement, Number 1, Quarter 1, 2012. Pages 36-38. Castrol used inventory optimization to reduce finished goods inventory by an average of 35 percent in two years while increasing service levels (defined as line fill rates) by 9 percent.Hallie Forcino, ‚ÄúBreak on Through to the Other Side,‚Äù Managing Automation, February 2005. Smiths Medical, a division of Smiths Group, used inventory optimization to better address demand volatility and supply variability, thus reducing the risk of both understocks and overstocks while smoothing out manufacturing cycles.Robert J.

Main reason for the separation is political conflict. It is even possible that family members are given citizenships of different countries. Examples where families were divided through political conflicts are the division of the Korean peninsula and the division of Germany through the inner German border. Both cases were caused by a rearrangement of national boundaries. However, families can also be divided if national boundaries remain unchanged, but instead groups of people or invidviduals are moved, forced to leave or flee. Forced displacement such as flight from persecution, violence or a severe lack of public order can be causes of divided families. For example, over 100,000 unaccompanied minors applied for asylum in other countries in 2015. Other examples are population transfer, third country resettlement and deportation. Many countries offer programmes for family reunification that allows divided families to live together again.  Division of the Korean peninsula  The division of the Korean peninsula is one of the last remaining relics of the Cold War. Since the end of the Korean War in 1953, there has been virtually no contact between the citizens of the two countries, including the many families who were divided during the turmoil that engulfed Korea after liberation from Japanese rule and during the three-year Korean War. Many people in both North Korea and South Korea have lost contact with the rest of their family, and are unable to communicate with them due to strict regulations across borders. In the 1980s, South Korea held special programs to reunite divided families. Between 1910 and 1945 Korea lost sovereignty and was colonized by Japan, which caused millions of Koreans to disperse. Between 25% and 35% were separated after the liberation right before the Korean War. The vast majority of the divided families (i.e. between 65% and 75%) were separated by the start of the Korean War on and around June 25, 1950. Seoul, the capital, was taken in 3 days. The largest seaborne evacuation from the North was from Hungnam between 15 and 24 December 1950, when 86,000 refugees along with UN Forces escaped from North Korean and Chinese forces. Millions more fled their homes to flee south. All communication with their relatives, due to the iron curtain that divided the peninsula left many not knowing the whereabouts and well-being of their loved ones who remained behind in the North. There were fathers and brothers who left their mothers behind, thinking they would be able to return in a few days, only to lose their relatives for a lifetime. Mothers who left their children behind, only to never be able to see them again. Children who became lost in the mad scramble of huge crowds of people flooding the paths to escape. The United Nations Command includes a provision in the armistice regarding the ‚Äòvoluntary‚Äô repatriation of displaced persons. But after the 'armistice, the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), at the 38th parallel between North and South Korea, becomes the most heavily militarized border in the world. Some divided families between South Korea and the Korean diaspora who live in Western countries were able to reunite. In 2010 there were 1.7 million Americans of Korean descent residing in the United States. 100,000 Korean Americans are estimated to be members of a divided family, who still have kin living in North Korea. In 1903 the first Korean Americans arrived in Hawaii as laborers. From 1975 - and after the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, abolishing quotas on the number of Asians allowed to enter the United States, was passed - Koreans began immigrating to the United States in large numbers, becoming one of the top five countries of origin of immigrants to the United States. Korean American pastors began to visit North Korea to search for their family members as well as the family members of those in their congregations. However, reuniting divided families between the two Koreas remains difficult due to lack of communication. The problems posed by these divided families is a pressing humanitarian issue that has been used for political ends by the governments on both sides of the 38th parallel north over the last five decades. Most families do not know the fate of their relatives on the other side of the border. Following the historic summit of 2000 in Pyongyang, there have been several rounds of reunions, but the number of families affected remains low. For many of the first generation, divided families' time is running out, as many pass away before seeing their relatives again. > ‚ÄúBy 28 June 2001, a mere 11 months after the first round of reunions in > August 2000, 12,664 of the 116,460 original applicants for reunion had died. > These figures clearly underline the pressing need for a solution to be found > to this issue before the first generation of divided families finally > disappear from the two Koreas‚Äô societies, and the infringement of their > fundamental human rights they have endured for so long becomes > irreversible.‚ÄùKorea‚Äôs Divided Families: Fifty years of separationby James A. > Foley, p. 63. > ‚ÄúClearly the most stressful psychological factor in their predicament is the > uncertainty surrounding their loved ones‚Äô fates. 83% had no idea of the > whereabouts or status of their relatives.

In 1971-1972 the Red Cross talks regarding divided families ended without any agreement being reached. In 1983 the Korean Broadcasting System hosted a ‚ÄòCampaign to Reunite Ten Million Divided Families‚Äô telethon that attracted millions looking for their divided families, but it was only broadcast within South Korea, due to North Korea‚Äôs non- participation. Still, after the 95 minute program was extended to 453 hours and 45 minutes due to overwhelming response, 10,000 out of 109,000 applicants were reunited. In 1980 Choong Lim Chun, a Canadian, began to reunite divided families, including Korean Americans, after receiving a letter and picture of his older sister in 1979 from a security guard for North Korea‚Äôs Olympic team, while working as a reporter for the New Korea Times. Although Korean Americans initiated contact, North Koreans sought their relatives as well by advertising in North Korean media and later, applying to meet them. Following his death in 1995, his wife Soon Young has continued his work. Between 1989 and 1991 were the three ‚ÄúGolden Years‚Äù for Korean Americans. Politician and activist, Lim Su-kyung, publicly advocated for reunification and reunions. Lim even travelled to Pyongyang, but was arrested for violating the National Security Act after she returned to the South through Panmunjom. Travel to the North was abundant. However, this was followed by the ‚ÄúDark Times‚Äù between 1992‚Äì1997, because North Korea ended Korean American visitations due to complaints from its general populace about preferential treatment given to the family members of Korean Americans. In 2000 June 13‚Äì15, a Summit between South Korean President Kim Dae Jung and North Korean leader Kim Jong Il was held, where South and North Korea agreed to host reunions. Only Korean Americans who were related to South Korean candidates were able to participate. According to the 2000 U.S. Census Bureau, there were between 1.2 and 1.4 million Korean Americans. In 2001 there was a trial exchange of correspondence between 300 members from each side. According to calculation in 2001, 12,664 of the 116,460 South Koreans who originally applied to the National Red Cross died less than a year after their application ‚Äì 10.9% of the total number of applicants from the South. Also in 2001 Korean Americans, encouraged by South Korean reunions, collected more than 100,000 signatures in support of Korean American reunions. Because of their work, House Concurrent Resolution 77 (Rep. Xavier Becerra and Rep. Ed Royce) and Senate Concurrent Resolution 90 passed, in support of Korean American reunions. In 2007 the Divided Families Foundation (previously Saemsori) lobbied to create the Congressional Commission on Divided Families, co-chaired by Rep. Mark Kirk and Rep. Jim Matheson. A State Department letter to Rep. Jim Matheson directed him to the Divided Families Foundation and the Korean Red Cross regarding his divided family constituent, Wan Chan No. The Congressional Research Service estimated there were between 104,000 and 500,000 Korean Americans with North Korean family members and stated that only 80 Korean Americans had met their relatives through their kin in South Korean reunions. There were no reunions in 2008 after the election of President Lee Myung-bak and his stop to unconditional aid. Section 1265 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, directed the President to report to Congress on family reunions between U.S. citizens and their relatives in North Korea. The 2009 House Report 111-187 (accompanying H.R. 3081 ‚Äì State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Bill, 2010) \\"urges the Special Representative on North Korea Policy, as the senior official handling North Korea issues, to prioritize the issues involving Korean divided families, and to, if necessary, appoint a coordinator for such families.\\" In 2010‚Äì2011 the Divided Families Foundation restarted lobbying, and created an internship program with the 111th Congress and the Obama Administration Divided Families Foundation which partnered with the American Red Cross to deliver 3 Red Cross Messages to North Korea. On 2012 Mar 24 the Divided Families Foundation kicked off its registration drive with 588 letters to addresses received from the South Korean Ministry of Unification and on Mar 27, Amb. Robert King recommended that Korean American divided families members register with the American Red Cross, just as in South Korea. = South Korean - North Korean family reunions Former division of Germany  Many German families were divided between 1961, when the Berlin Wall and the inner German border were erected, and the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989 and the German reunification. \\"The wall divided friends, families and loved ones, causing people on both sides to lose their jobs and livelihoods if trapped on the wrong side.\\" References See also  *Displaced person History of Korea Family Refugees Forced migration ","title":"Divided family"},{"id":"36038188","text":"The Malvern School, founded in 1998, is a year-round private preschool for ages six weeks to eight years.

Written by Arnold Fanck and Rolf Meyer, the film is a modern-day Robinson Crusoe story about a man so angry about the post-World War I conditions in Weimar Germany that he voluntarily goes to live on a desert island. The film was shot partly on location in South America.Bergfelder & Bock, p. 116. Plot During World War I, the German cruiser SMS Dresden is attacked by British ships off the coast of Chile. The crew manages to abandon ship before it sinks. They make their way to an isolated island where they are taken prisoner. After spending three years in custody, the sailors manage to escape and make their way back to Germany, intending to continue fighting for their Fatherland. When they arrive, however, they encounter a different Germany from the one they left behind‚Äîone where they are ridiculed and attacked by mutineers. One of the returning crew, Carl Ohlsen (Herbert A.E.

Mimmo Martinucci: Dreaming of the Italian islands. Help for amateur radio. Vol 3 - All the islands of Sicily. 2007, Sandit Books,  Geography  The two rocks are located between the districts of Grottasanta, Mazzarona and Tunis Avenue, in a bay called \\"Coast of Piliceddi\\". The coasts in the neighborhood are all very jagged, except a little beach, formed by the disintegration of the rocks. The depth of the sea doesn't exceed the 20 meters. The rocks * The \\"Big Rock\\" is 70 meters away from the coast and is more than 12 meters high. It is called the elephant or mastodon because of its shape. It is divided in half by a narrow fissure which starts at sea level and goes to the top of the rock, forming two caves. The back is exposed to the open sea and is composed of sharp rocks and holes caused by the erosion of breaking waves. The front is perpendicular to the sea level and is exposed to the bay. It is one of the best known sets of rocks near Syracuse, because of the legend of the two brothers and also because of the actual death of a boy around 12 years old. He died trying to get in the lower part of the rock (the footbridge). * The \\"Little Rock\\" is about 50 meters away from the coast and is 5 meters high. It takes the form of a small boat. It is around 12 meters from the big rock - leaving room for boats to pass between them. The highest part of the rock, on the left, is flat and perpendicular to the sea. On the right, it slides down to sea level and is full of holes and sharp rocks, because of its exposure to the open sea.  Legend of the two brothers  Three versions: # One day two brothers come to go spearfishing. One of them dives under the water and gets stuck in a crack, the other dives to save him, but both drown. # One bright and sunny day, two brothers decided jump from the bigger rock. The two brothers climb the rock but before their jump, the sea becomes turbulent and agitated. They jump and are drowned by the waves and stormy seas. # The third version compares the two rocks to two brothers; an older brother and younger brother. Flora and fauna Both the flora and fauna are typical of the Mediterranean. There are several species of aquatic plants, mostly neptune grass. The fauna is composed of crabs, shellfish, sea urchins, octopus, starfish, fish of various species, moray eels, and there can be stingrays. In the 2005 there was an influx of jellyfish, mostly Pelagia noctiluca. Other seaside towns saw an increase in jellyfish. The Pelagia noctiluca is very irritating and has hurt many people whom have tried to swim.  Tourism  Tourism is mainly present in the summer, between the months of June and September. The tourists who come to visit this place, are particularly attracted by the beauty of the sea and the landscape of jagged cliffs. There are boat tours driven by professionalists, which take tourists visiting the sea and rocks. The tour, lasting about half an hour, begin from the island of Ortigia, then passes from the coast of sea grottoes of Syracuse, and finally arrives at the \\"Two Brothers\\", where it stops for a few minutes to give tourists the possibility to swim. Afterward they repeated by the same round, bringing the tourists to Ortigia. This is a particularly suitable place to spend some time in contact with marine nature, repose and also for fun. The two rocks are also a great place for diving. There is also practiced spearfishing, given the abundance of the fauna.  How to reach the rocks  The two rocks are accessible through the Via Sicilia, situated in the district of Grottasanta. Going from this to its end, and turning right, there is a destroyed wall, and immediately after the bike path. After this there is a large lawn by Mediterranean, bounded by cliffs overlooking the sea (\\"Coast of Piliceddi\\"), and from there the two rocks are visible. Walking centrally towards the cliff, you will reach a cliff with a short, steep descent, where you can see the stairs carved into the rock of ancient origin. Going down toward the reef closest to the sea, one arrives at a small peninsula, where the rocks of \\"Two Brothers\\" are only accessible by the sea. Somewhere between the mainland and the rocks there are around 60 meters of distance.

Munasinghe is a right-handed batsman who bowls right-arm medium-fast. His first appearance for Italy came against a Leinster Cricket Union President's XI in a warm up match for the 2008 European Cricket Championship Division One, though he made no appearances during the main tournament itself. He was then selected as part of Italy's squad for the 2008 World Cricket League Division Four in Tanzania, making four appearances. With the ball, he took 2 wickets in the tournament at an average of 32.50, with best figures of 1/32. With the bat, he scored 20 runs with a high score of 11 not out. His next appearance for Italy came in the 2010 European Cricket Championship Division One, in which he played five matches. He was then selected as part of Italy's squad for the 2010 World Cricket League Division Four, which was hosted by Italy. He made six appearances during the tournament, helping Italy earn promotion to the 2011 World Cricket League Division Three. Division Three was played in Hong Kong in January 2011, with Munasinghe selected as part of Italy's thirteen man squad. He played in all six of Italy's matches in the tournament, took 13 wickets during the tournament, at an average of 20.00, with best figures of 4/60. In July 2011, Munasinghe played in the European T20 Championship in Jersey and Guernsey, which saw Italy end the tournament as runners-up to Denmark. This result qualified them to take part in the World Twenty20 Qualifier in the United Arab Emirates in March 2012. He was selected as part of Italy's fourteen man squad for the qualifier. He made his Twenty20 debut during the tournament against Oman, with him making eight further appearances, the last of which came against Kenya.

Larson served as law clerk to two U.S. Judges. From 19851986 Larson clerked for Minnesota Supreme Court Justice Rosalie E. Wahl. During the 19861987 court term she clerked for Judge Theodore McMillian of the U.S. Court of Appeals, Eighth Circuit. In 1987, Larson began working as an associate for the Washington D.C. branch of the law firm Powell, Goldstein, Frazer & Murphy. In 1990 she joined the faculty of Northwestern University Law School, where she twice won the Robert Childs award for excellence in teaching. Larson joined the faculty of the University of Wisconsin Law School in 1996 where she remained for the rest of her life. She was active in the Association of American Law Schools.  Scholarship and philosophy  During her time on faculty at Northwestern, Larson developed her theory of \\"sexual fraud\\" ‚Äì \\"intentional lies made for the express purpose of gaining sexual consent that would otherwise have been withheld,\\" in Larson's words ‚Äì as a tort for which people could sue if they suffered damages such as sexually transmitted diseases. Larson's 1993 Columbia Law Review article, \\"'Women Understand So Little, They Call My Good Nature \\"Deceit: A Feminist Rethinking of Seduction\\" was widely acclaimed within the fields of legal theory and feminist thought. In 1999, Oxford University Press published her book Hard Bargains: The Politics of Sex, co-authored with Linda Hirshman. The book offered a critical analysis of the power dynamics involved in heterosexual sex, a theme echoed in Larson's scholarly work on the legal histories of prostitution, rape and sexual harassment. Other notable areas of scholarship included her participation in amicus briefs for Webster v. Reproductive Health Services and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, supporting reproductive rights and her analysis of the legal rights of residents of the colonia settlements on the U.S. Mexico border.  Death and influence  Larson died at her home in Madison, Wisconsin on December 24, 2011.

At each node the symbols of the string are projected onto two partitions of the alphabet, and a bitvector denotes to which partition each symbol belongs. Note that only the bitvectors are stored; the strings in the nodes are only for illustratory purposes. The Wavelet Tree is a succinct data structure to store strings in compressed space. It generalizes the \\\\mathbf{rank}_q and \\\\mathbf{select}_q operations defined on bitvectors to arbitrary alphabets. Originally introduced to represent compressed suffix arrays, it has found application in several contexts. The tree is defined by recursively partitioning the alphabet into pairs of subsets; the leaves correspond to individual symbols of the alphabet, and at each node a bitvector stores whether a symbol of the string belongs to one subset or the other. The name derives from an analogy with the wavelet transform for signals, which recursively decomposes a signal into low- frequency and high-frequency components.  Properties  Let \\\\Sigma be a finite alphabet with \\\\sigma=\\\\Sigma. By using succinct dictionaries in the nodes, a string s \\\\in \\\\Sigma^* can be stored in nH_0(s) + o(s\\\\log \\\\sigma), where H_0(s) is the order-0 empirical entropy of s. If the tree is balanced, the operations \\\\mathbf{access}, \\\\mathbf{rank}_q, and \\\\mathbf{select}_q can be supported in O(\\\\log \\\\sigma) time.  Access operation  A wavelet tree contains a bitmap representation of a string. If we know the alphabet set, then the exact string can be inferred by tracking bits down the tree. To find the letter at ith position in the string :- If the ith element at root is 0, we move to the left child, else we move to the right child. Now our index in the child node is the rank of the respective bit in the parent node. This rank can be calculated in O(1) by using succinct dictionaries. Along with moving to a child we also refine our alphabet to the respective subset. These steps are repeated till we reach a leaf, where we are left only with one letter in our alphabet, which is the one we were looking for. Thus for a balanced tree, any S[i] in string S can be accessed in O(\\\\log \\\\sigma) time.  Extensions  Several extensions to the basic structure have been presented in the literature. To reduce the height of the tree, multiary nodes can be used instead of binary. The data structure can be made dynamic, supporting insertions and deletions at arbitrary points of the string; this feature enables the implementation of dynamic FM-indexes. This can be further generalized, allowing the update operations to change the underlying alphabet: the Wavelet Trie exploits the trie structure on an alphabet of strings to enable dynamic tree modifications.

Later he was well known for his drawings and paintings in the romantic historical style, including numerous book illustrations. His frescoes decorate various buildings in Trieste and surroundings. Early years Assault upon the Shkodra Castle by Ottoman forces in the siege of Shkodra of 1478‚Äì9 (1860) Giuseppe Lorenzo Gatteri was born in Trieste on 18 September 1829. His father, also Giuseppe Gatteri, was a well-known oil and fresco painter who had moved in 1824 to Trieste from Rivolto, near Codroipo in Friuli. In 1840 his father took Giuseppe Lorenzo with him to Venice, there the son became a pupil of other painters, supported by a scholarship from the municipality of Trieste. Gatteri was described as a child prodigy; by the age of 11 he impressed members of the Minerva Society in Venice with his ability to improvise drawings of episodes from antiquity. A contemporary Art Journal lauded Gatteri's Gatteri's teachers encouraged him to follow the Romantic style of painting while respecting the Venetian school's tradition of warm color. He exhibited two pen drawings in the Trieste Society of Fine Arts in 1841, and three more the next year. In 1842 his father took Giuseppe Lorenzo to Milan, where again he was shown off at gatherings of the elite as a child prodigy. He greatly impressed the nobility by the speed and quality of his work and his sense for composition. In 1843 his father took him to Turin. He was received by King Charles Albert of Sardinia, who commissioned a series of drawings. The Venice Academy of Fine Arts awarded him prizes in 1845, 1847 and 1851. Later career Cesare Borgia leaving the Vatican (1877) Gatteri illustrated several literary and historical books. After his return to Trieste in 1857 he illustrated a biography of the sailor C. Costantini, a history of Trieste and a book of poems by Pietro Zorutti in the Friulian language. He prepared 150 drawings for a History of Venice (1852) by Francesco Zanotto.Printed in Venice in 1852 and reprinted in 1872. The plates were engraved by Antonio Viviani and other Venetian artists. He decorated the ceremonial hall of the Gravisi-Barbabianca Palace in Koper (Capodistria). The fresco on the ceiling depicts Apollo on a chariot. He decorated several cafes in Trieste. In a magnificent villa on the Via Ginnastica in Trieste he painted the ceiling of one of the rooms with a fresco square depicting a youthful Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria and the Empress Elizabeth on horseback surrounded by heraldic symbols and lesser personages. Gatteri was appointed curator of the Revoltella Museum in Trieste from 1873 to 1876. He was co-founder and the first chairman of an art association in 1884. Work Arcadian Holocaust ‚Äì scene from the Cretan Revolt (1866‚Äì69) Gatteri paints historic themes in the style of Romanticism. The Revoltella Museum in Trieste contains many of his masterworks, including: The Feast of Mary, Arrival of the Queen of Cyprus in Venice (1864), Entertainment given by Cardinal Riario to the Duchess of Ferrara (1872), Cesare Borgia leaving the Vatican (1877) and Minerva awarded the Arts and the Virtues (1884), thought to be his last work. His book illustrations were also important, including those for Dante's Divine Comedy, Francesco Zanotto's Venetian History (1852) and Vincenzo Scussa's Chronological History of Trieste (1863). Gatteri's works, whether in oils or on paper, were always dramatic compositions, decorated with rich period costumes, brightly colored or bejeweled or shining armor. He has been criticized for taking excessive care to depict clean and bright surfaces, to render excessive detail, and thus to lose life and spontaneity. Another critic has called him a scholar of costume and of theatrical decoration of dead ages, who failed to understand what his paintings depicted.

Background Brian Wittenstein signed a severance agreement with TNA, his former employer, on August 3, 2011 which included a non-disclosure agreement preventing him from disclosing certain confidential TNA information (including information regarding talent contracts). He was subsequently hired by WWE after which, TNA asserted that Wittenstein violated the agreement by downloading confidential TNA trade secrets and providing that information to WWE. Although WWE fired Wittenstein and alerted TNA officials as to the disclosure of the information, TNA claimed that WWE had access to the information for three weeks prior to disclosure and in this time, WWE used secret contract information and attempted to poach their talent in violation of Tennessee's Uniform Trade Secrets Act. The information was alleged to include data regarding wrestler compensation, which was used to recruit contracted TNA talent to work for WWE.

Born in the United Kingdom of Australian parents, she is a citizen of both countries. Biography She grew up in Melbourne, Australia, attending Tintern Grammar and taking a degree in Music from Melbourne University (B.Mus Hons 1966), where she won the Ormond Exhibition and was placed first in her final year. Following a period of working internationally as musical director and composer of music for the theatre, she continued orchestration studies in London with William L Reed and piano studies with the Swiss pianist Albert Ferber, a pupil of Walter Gieseking and who often played for Sergei Rachmaninoff. Her debut at London‚Äôs Wigmore Hall in 1974, sponsored by the Stanley Lewis Concerts Society, was followed by concerts and broadcasts in the UK and tours worldwide, both as solo recitalist and concerto soloist. In 1993, she appeared in the Australia Day Gala at the Royal Opera House in the presence of the Prince of Wales. She has appeared with orchestras including the London Philharmonic, Philharmonia, BBC Concert Orchestra and leading orchestras in Australia, Europe and America.Robert Cummings,\\"Penelope Thwaites - Artist Biography\\", \\"All Music\\" Repertoire and recordings Her concert repertoire encompasses a wide range of classical composers, some represented on her CD ‚ÄòTravelling Between Worlds‚Äô (LIR). Her Bach recording (2013) for the same label was described in one review as ‚Äòclassic Bach keyboard works enlivened by some exquisite playing...Bach's music becomes here in one of Busoni's adaptations, richly expressive and soul searching, raptly played...an impressive survey of some wonderful good-to-be-alive music‚Äô (Sinfoni September 2014). Beginning in 1975 Penelope has made a point of including music by Australian composers such as Malcolm Williamson, Margaret Sutherland, Arthur Benjamin, Peggy Glanville-Hicks, Jennifer Fowler, Alison Bauld, David Worrall and many more, whether in solo recitals, concertos and chamber works. Her pioneering LP ‚ÄòAustralian Piano Music‚Äô (Discourses 1980) was broadcast worldwide as something of a novelty at the time. Penelope found a special affinity with the music of Melbourne-born pianist and composer Percy Grainger. She has now recorded more than 260 tracks of his music: first for Pearl records (most of the four-hand repertoire with John Lavender), solo discs for Unicorn Kanchana and Regis, and most notably as a featured solo, chamber and orchestral artist on eight of Chandos Records‚Äô 20-CD Grainger Edition. In 2016 Heritage Records released a box set of the complete Grainger music for two pianos four hands, featuring the three earlier recordings by Thwaites and Lavender together with a fourth CD recorded in 2016 by Penelope with Timothy Young. BBC Music Magazine (February 2017) commented ‚Äòpassion undimmed, along with dexterity, the playing‚Äôs flair and precision are unchanged‚Ä¶Listening again only makes the heart grow fonder...I can't think of another composer who so quickly and quirkily enhances life.‚Äô Other activities Her lectures and broadcasts on the composer and detailed research into his life and work led to her editing The New Percy Grainger Companion (Boydell & Brewer 2010, paperback edition 2016).The New Percy Grainger Companion,\\"Boydell & Brewer\\", First Published: 28 Nov 2010 She was Artistic Director for two major Grainger Festivals in London (St John‚Äôs Smith Square in 1998 Ian Lace, \\"The Grainger Event\\", Music Web International, 8 November 1998 and a four-day celebration at King‚Äôs Place in 2011 ‚Äì 50 years since Grainger‚Äôs death.Jonathan Lennie, \\"Percy Grainger: Much more than folk\\", \\"Time Out\\", 8 February 2011 Her interest in promoting Australian composition led to her founding and chairing the international Performing Australian Music Competition which took place in London in 2001 and 2008, attracting young musicians from 20 countries who chose and performed music of 80 Australian composers.

Players assume the roles of space explorers on a mission to survey the galaxy. The crew is evaluated on teamwork and how they deal with problems that arise on their journey. Unlike most board games, in Space Alert, players need to make decisions and play cards in real time. It was given a special prize for \\"New Game Worlds\\" in the 2009 Spiel des Jahres awards. Gameplay Game Board and Components. The game is separated into two rounds, the action round and the resolution round. The action round consists of 10 minutes of gameplay. During this round, the computer announces threats that appear, and the players play cards which allow them to take actions in response to the threats. Each card allows the player to move around the ship, or to take actions (such as firing a laser, supplying energy to a reactor, etc.). After the action round, players complete the resolution round, during which they resolve their actions and determine whether or not they survived the threats. They then calculate their points based on the number of threats handled and the amount of damage their ship sustained. Roles The crew consists of a captain, a chief of security, a communications officer and two general space cadets. The captain is responsible for announcing the progression of the turns. The chief of security announces internal threats, while the communication officer announces external threats. The general space cadets have no specific role. Computer announcements The action round progression follows an audio track, included in the game components, that narrates the different events in each phase. These events include enemy activity, incoming data, data transfers, and the end of each phase. Incoming data allows players to draw cards. Data transfers allow players to exchange cards. Enemy activity details the external and internal threats. Threats There are two types of threats: external and internal. External threats spawn outside the ship and are usually dealt with by shooting lasers or missiles. Internal threats spawn inside the ship. All threats are categorized as serious or common threats. Serious threats, if not dealt with, usually end in a substantial amount of damage. Space Alert: the New Frontier Expansion 150x150px Space Alert: the New Frontier is an expansion pack for Space Alert released in 2010. The expansion adds to many different aspects of the game. There are new threats, (including more difficult \\"red\\" threats,) a new \\"double actions\\" game mode, player specializations and an experience system. These additions can all be used simultaneously or players can pick and choose which additions they would like to play with for a given mission.

Even a few days before the birth, Anne had not decided who would be the midwife and kept three women near her, without making a choice.Memorials of Affairs of State, vol. 2 (London, 1725), p. 56. Finally, Alice Dennis was chosen and received a reward of ¬£100.Frederick Madden, Issues of the Exchequer: James I (London, 1836), p. 23.  Life  Greenwich Palace, Mary's birthplace. Finally, on 8 April 1605, at Greenwich Palace, Anne of Denmark delivered a girl. Although the peoples of King James were slightly disappointed, the birth of the first princess of the two united realms was a cause for celebration. Throughout the realms, bonfires were lit and church bells rung all day long; the celebrations were encouraged by the fact that 68 years had elapsed since the birth of a child to an English sovereign, the last being Edward VI. The next day, King James drank health to his wife and new daughter. In letters announcing Mary's birth to his relatives, James described her as \\"a most beautiful infant\\" and punned on her not-yet-revealed name, saying that \\"if I would not pray to the Virgin Mary, I would pray for the Virgin Mary.\\" Preparations for a royal christening started immediately after the birth. The location decided upon was the chapel at Greenwich Palace and the date, 5 May. Mary was carried by Elizabeth de Vere, Countess of Derby, who was supported by the Dukes of Holstein and Lennox.John Nichols, The Progresses, Processions, and Magnificent Festivities, of King James the First, vol. 1 (London, 1828), pp. 512-3. The infant's clothing, a train of purple velvet, embroidered with gold and furred with ermines, was supported by two countesses, being so long that it fell to the ground. The archbishop of Canterbury, Richard Bancroft, christened the child with the name Mary, as her godparents, Ulrik of Denmark, brother to the queen, Lady Arbella Stuart, first cousin to the king, and Dorothy Percy, Countess of Northumberland, had decided to name her. Immediately after the ceremony was complete, the noblemen put on their coats and the trumpets sounded. As a way to further celebrate this joyful occasion, the king presented Queen Anne with new jewelry and created several new peerages. On the 19 May 1605, Anne of Denmark, who had no role at the christening, was \\"churched\\". This ceremony took place at Greenwich Palace. The king and the lords heard a sermon in the King's Closet. He then went into the Chapel. The Queen came from her private lodging, where she had had her \\"laying in\\", to her Closet with a train of ladies. Some of the lords came to bring her into the Chapel, and she came to the altar supported by the Dukes of Holstein and Lennox., then went to her seat in a canopy called a \\"traverse\\" opposite the king. After prayers and music the king and queen came to the altar together and embraced, then walked to the door of the King's Presence Chamber.John Nichols, The Progresses, Processions, and Magnificent Festivities of King James the First, vol. 1 (London, 1828), p. 514. Mary was given into the care of Sir Thomas Knyvet, afterwards Lord Knyvet, who helped arrest Guy Fawkes and stop the Gunpowder Plot. On 1 June 1605, Mary was sent to Stanwell, Middlesex, to Knyvet's residence. He built new lodgings for the women of Mary's household.Mary Anne Everett Green, Calendar State Papers Domestic, Addenda 1580-1625 (London, 1872), p. 469. He was given ¬£20 per week for the infant princess's diet and that of her suite, consisting of six rockers and several inferior attendants; but the King himself paid their wages, the expenses of moving young Mary from house to house, of her coach and horses and other such costs. Elizabeth Hayward, Knyvet's wife, took great care of her \\"royal charge\\" during her short life.  Death and burial  A later depiction of Mary's tomb. At 17 months old, Mary contracted a violent cold that developed into pneumonia. She was constantly feverish and Queen Anne was called to Stanwell and frequently visited her young child. An eyewitness account later preached at her funeral stated that \\"such was the manner of her death, as bred a kind of admiration in us all that were present to behold it. For, whereas the new-tuned organs of her speech, by reason of her wearisome and tedious sickness, had been so greatly weakened, that for the space of twelve or fourteen hours at the least, there was no sound of any word heard breaking from her lips; yet when it sensibly appeared that she would soon make a peaceful end of a troublesome life, she sighed out these words, 'I go, I go!' and when, not long after, there was something to be ministered unto her by those that attended her in the time of her sickness, fastening her eye upon them with a constant look, again she repeated 'Away, I go!' And yet, a third time, almost immediately before she offered up herself, a sweet virgin sacrifice, unto Him that made her, faintly cried 'I go, I go!' The more strange did this appear to us that heard it, in that it was almost incredible that so much vigor should still remain in so weak a body; and whereas she had used many other words in the time of her extremity, yet now at last, as if directed by supernatural inspiration, she did so aptly utter these, and none but these.\\" As soon as Mary died, the Earl of Worcester, the Earl of Leicester and the Earl of Totnes went to Hampton Court Palace, to inform the queen of her daughter's death. Seeing the three men before her, Queen Anne realized what had happened and spared the men the task of telling her. After showing the normal maternal signs of sorrow, she demanded that the king be told of Mary's death, an autopsy performed and a funeral prepared. Thus, a private ceremony took place at Westminster Abbey's Henry VII Lady Chapel on 23 September and Mary's embalmed body was buried opposite of her sister Sophia's tomb. Her effigy, created by Maximilian Colt, represented a young girl, clad in a mature dress, with the traditional ruff, carved in ivory. It reads (or read in the nineteenth century) \\"I, Mary, daughter of James, King of Great Britain, France and Ireland and of Queen Anne, received into heaven in early infancy, found joy for myself, but left longings for my parents, on the 16th of September, 1607. Ye congratulators, condole: she lived only 1 year [sic, according to Everett Green] 5 months and 88 days.\\"  Ancestors  References = Notes  Bibliography  * 1605 births 1607 deaths 17th-century English people 17th- century Scottish people 17th-century women English princesses Scottish princesses Mary Burials at Westminster Abbey Deaths from pneumonia ","title":"Mary Stuart (1605‚Äì1607)"},{"id":"36039210","text":"Velappan is a surname.

When Killian steals a sample of the virus and sells it to domestic terrorists, she calls up her old friend Tony Stark to help recover it. After Tony is severely beaten by Mallen, a terrorist who had been injected with the virus, he convinces Maya to inject him with Extremis too. Tony defeats and apprehends Mallen, but he discovers that Killian could not have acted alone in selling Extremis. Tony confronts Maya, who confesses to assisting in the crime as she knew it would force defense contractors to renew their funding. She is subsequently taken into custody. Later, Tony believes Extremis is altering his brain functions so he gets her out of jail to help him. She is placed under his custody. When Sal Kennedy is killed, Maya feels she could have saved him if she had been allowed to continue her research on Extremis. She is unknowingly tricked into giving the Mandarin samples of the virus. Following the events of the Secret Invasion storyline, Maya Hansen disappeared from the series and was not seen again until the relaunch of the Iron Man series during the Marvel NOW! event.

The squadron, known as the \\"Lucky Red Lions\\", is based at MCB Hawaii and falls under the command of Marine Aircraft Group 24 (MAG-24) and the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing. Mission Provide assault support of combat troops, supplies and equipment during amphibious operations and subsequent operations ashore. Routinely, VMM squadrons provide the foundation for an aviation combat element (ACE) of any level Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) mission that may include conventional assault support tasks and special operations. History=Early years Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 363 the \\"Lucky Red Lions\\", was activated on June 2, 1952, at Marine Corps Air Station Santa Ana, California and was designated the Marine Helicopter Transport Squadron 363 (HMR-363). It was activated as a result of the demands of the Korean War. In 1953, the unit flew the Sikorsky HRS-1 and during this period took part in Operation Desert Rock, the first atomic test to use ground troops. Soon thereafter, the squadron became the first West Coast helicopter unit to receive the Sikorsky H-34 helicopter. In December 1964, a disastrous flood struck Northern California, and on Christmas Eve, HMM-363 deployed aboard the USS Bennington and rushed northward to the disaster area. UH-34D from HMH-363 flying near MCAS Tustin in 1964. Vietnam War The squadron was deployed to Vietnam in August 1965. On September 1, 1965, HMM-363 engaged in their first combat missions ever. The squadron‚Äôs initial troop insert was a combined operation with HMM-161 in moving the 3rd Battalion 3rd Marines into a landing zone south of Da Nang at Marble Mountain. Close ties between HMM-363 and Republic of Korea (ROK) forces were developed in Operation Flying Tiger. The Tiger Division was airlifted to Hill 78 in conjunction with the operation, which was viewed as the most successful Korean offensive of the war to date. The squadron was also involved with numerous operations, which increased in intensity following the Tet Offensive in early 1968. March 26, 1968 was perhaps the most disastrous day in the history of HMM-363. During a rocket attack, five squadron members were wounded and required medical evacuation. During the flight up the coast of Vietnam, the medevac aircraft lost its engine and crashed killing seven people including the commanding officer. The only survivors were the pilot and co-pilot who managed to escape before the aircraft sank in the coastal waters. On January 23, 1969, the squadron was redeployed back to California and was designated \\"Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron 363\\" (HMH-363) after having received the Sikorsky CH-53A transport helicopter. Post-Vietnam In October 1972, the squadron was the first unit to receive the powerful CH-53D. In March 1977, the squadron was selected to participate in the operational evaluation of the USS Tarawa (LHA-1), the first of the new large and modern amphibious ships. In early 1983, the squadron was awarded the Meritorious Unit Citation. The Squadron provided relief efforts and humanitarian support in the Philippines following a devastating earthquake and flood in 1990. HMH-363 flew countless missions and over 500 flight hours in 3¬Ω weeks, delivering food, clothing, and shelter to inhabitants living in remote areas of the Philippines. The squadron received the Humanitarian Service Medal for its relief effort. CH-53D Sea Stallions from HMH-363 on the flightline at MCB Hawaii on January 12, 2006. During Desert Shield/Desert Storm, HMH-363 supported the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing in Okinawa and returned to California in May 1991, terminating its unit rotations to Okinawa after this eleven-month deployment. In December 1992, the squadron participated in Operation Restore Hope in SomaliaSimmons (2003), p.320. and was awarded the Joint Meritorious Unit Commendation and Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal. The squadron has also supported Joint Task Force Six at Fort Bliss, Texas.

From late 2006 to early 2007, HMH-363 deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Based at Al Asad, this was the unit's first deployment in support of the Global War on Terror During Operation Iraqi Freedom HMH-363 flew 848.8 hours in one month. The squadron deployed again to Al Asad in Summer 2008 to support Operation Iraqi Freedom. They returned to MCB Hawaii in February 2009.

Lane pretends to be ignorant at first, but then apologizes while arguing that he was only taking his own money that he had previously invested and for which he had not been compensated. Don demands his resignation and gives him the weekend to think of an \\"elegant exit\\", assuring him that this is the worst part of starting over. Lane wanders over to Joan's (Christina Hendricks) office with the drink still in his hand, but she sends him away after he makes a lewd comment. At a partners meeting, Pete (Vincent Kartheiser) says Jaguar would like to pay SCDP via a fee structure instead of straight commission. He adds that Jaguar's tire supplier, Dunlop, is interested in meeting with SCDP. Later declaring that he is tired of meager accounts, Don tells Roger to arrange a meeting with Ed Baxter at Dow Chemical Company. Roger calls Dow the \\"Moby-Dick\\" of accounts and reminds him that Ken Cosgrove (Aaron Staton) is hesitant about doing business with his father-in- law, but Don does not care. Over drinks, Roger tells Ken they are going after Dow Chemical but assures him he is not obligated to work on the account. Ken agrees to keep the proceedings secret from his wife if Roger agrees to force him onto the account and to exclude Pete from all meetings. Roger tells Don he arranged a meeting with Baxter on Monday. As Betty Francis (January Jones) packs for a family ski vacation, Sally complains that she would rather spend the weekend with Don and Megan (Jessica Par√©). An angry Betty calls Don to say she is dropping Sally off at his apartment. To Megan's surprise, Sally shows up at the apartment and informs her that she will be staying for the weekend. Megan later complains to Don for not telling her about Sally's visit. Don confides that he had to fire Lane for embezzlement. Lane arrives home drunk to find that Rebecca has surprised him with a new Jaguar. She tells him her reasoning ‚Äî he never spends on himself. He vomits, but, the next morning, reassures Rebecca (Embeth Davidtz) that he likes the car. Lane attempts to commit suicide in the middle of the night using the new car's exhaust, but, in an ironic confirmation of Cooper's earlier retort of Jaguars that \\"They don't start!\\", the car fails to start. He then walks into SCDP's empty office and types a letter at his desk. Sally invites Glen to visit while Don and Megan are at work the next day. He agrees. The next morning, she waits for Megan to leave the apartment before rushing to change out of her pajamas. Glen arrives at the Draper apartment. They visit the American Museum of Natural History. He admits that he told friends he was going to \\"do it\\" with her, but that he thinks of her as a little sister. Feeling ill, Sally runs to the bathroom and finds blood on her underwear. Arriving home, Megan looks for Sally and sees Glen's duffel bag. Sally takes a cab to the Francis house and sprints to the bathroom. She later hugs Betty tightly and explains that her menstrual cycle has started. Glen shows up at the Draper apartment and tells Megan that Sally left him at the museum. Betty phones and tells her that Sally \\"became a woman today,\\" and just needed her mother. Megan insists Glen stay until she can drive him to his train. Betty gives Sally a hot water bottle and assures her that starting her cycle means \\"everything is working.\\" Roger rallies Don as they wait outside Baxter's (Ray Wise) office. Inside, Don puts aside Baxter's concerns about the advertised anti-smoking letter and insists Dow Chemical needs a new agency, despite having 50% of the market share. Don chides Baxter and his staff for allowing Dow to be satisfied with a 50% market share when they should go after more - and SCDP is the agency that can help them do it. Lane's secretary drops off some company records with Joan, saying Lane has not arrived and his office door is locked. Joan tries to open Lane's door to find it blocked, and is disturbed by a foul odor and the sight of an upturned end- table. She goes into the neighbouring office, where Pete, Harry and Ken are conversing, and informs them. Pete hops up onto a couch to look into Lane's office through the partition window; he claps his hand over his mouth in shock, and Ken holds Joan as she bursts into tears. Back from their meeting with Dow, Don and Roger arrive to a nearly empty office. They soon discover Cooper, Pete and Joan seated in the break room and are informed by them that Lane hanged himself. Cooper tells them the other employees do not know yet, and were sent home on a contrived pretext. Don, Pete, and Roger force their way into Lane's office and find his corpse dangling from the door. They cut it down and place it on the couch to preserve his dignity, against the advice from the police about not tampering with a crime scene. Roger picks up a note from the floor and opens it. He tells the group that it is Lane's boilerplate resignation. At home, Don offers to drive Glen back to his dormitory at Hotchkiss in Connecticut. Glen states that \\"everything you think is going to make you happy just turns to crap.\\" Don asks what Glen would do if he could do anything; later in Don's car, Glen drives and smiles as Don helps him steer. Production Jared Harris's character Lane Pryce is killed off in the episode. Jared Harris was told after the tenth episode read-through by series creator Matthew Weiner that Lane Pryce's time was at an end. About Lane's forced retirement, Harris stated: \\"In the beginning, he doesn't know that's the reason he's being called into the office. Once it comes up, he thinks he can bluff his way out of it. And then he goes through all of these emotions, from anger to denial to depression to acceptance. It was all written in there. The [script] was very specific about the different turns he would take.\\" Harris continued about his character's subsequent suicide: \\"When Matt told me [the Jaguar] idea, I laughed my ass off. When he said the car doesn't start, I just laughed for about five minutes. Nothing goes right for [Lane]...The sadness that I feel is that it's been such an amazing experience.\\" Pete's (Vincent Kartheiser), Don's (Jon Hamm), and Roger's (John Slattery) \\"shocked and chaotic\\" reactions to Lane's corpse were the actors' genuine reactions, according to Harris. Weiner called the decision to write off Lane Pryce \\"a terrible thing to have to deal with.\\" He added, \\"You want to make sure that it's worth it, that they're going out with a bang and you're not sacrificing someone who's a great actor and a great musician in the orchestra. But also I feel like there have to be stakes. This year was filled with foreboding of violence and death, and the connection of that early summer between the riots, which resulted in death, police killing innocent people, and the Richard Speck murders and the guy on the Texas tower [Charles Whitman]. The randomness and the nihilism that was born from that was something that permeated the story. Lane's story I thought was about someone who has undervalued themselves and that was his only way out, he thought.\\" Reception=Critical reception The episode received critical acclaim. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote about the \\"palpable, painful sense of dread throughout this episode\\", stating: \\"Though Lane's tax trouble seemed to come out of nowhere a few weeks ago...all of his behavior, and Don's, felt very true to form, and not like characters acting in a way designed to create a specific end point. Lane was doomed, but by his own actions and foibles as much as by any plot engineering to get that noose around his neck.\\" The Guardians Paul McInnes felt the series was \\"recovering its poise\\" on its way to the season finale, stating: \\"After dallying with melodrama (Pete and Beth Dawes, Harry and Hari Kinsey), the show has moved back towards the darker, more sophisticated narratives of cause and unexpected consequence. This week Lane may have taken his own life, but Don also got his mojo back and the two were directly related.\\" Verne Gay of Newsday compared the characters of Lane Pryce and Don Draper, stating: \\"Both have secret lives protected by carefully constructed fa√ßades. For both, the fa√ßade is everything ‚Äî and Lane's would simply fall away, like a line of dominoes when confronted with the consequences of his lie. A lie, after all, made in the service of his son.\\" Ratings \\"Commissions and Fees\\" was watched by 2.41 million viewers and received an adult 18-49 rating of 0.8. Accolades This episode received a nomination for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series for the 64th Primetime Emmy Awards.

The game was developed by Playfish and published by Electronic Arts. The game was announced at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2012, during EA's press conference on June 4, 2012,http://www.marketwatch.com/story/simcity- social-breaks-groun 4d-on-facebook-2012-06-04 and released on June 25, 2012. On April 14, 2013, it was announced that the game would be shutting down. On June 14, 2013, SimCity Social and The Sims Social both ceased completely, with no possible access to the game. This was met with very negative response from players of both games. Objective Like its forebear, SimCity, the objective is to design and build a city without specific goals although in SimCity Social, optional goals are introduced in the form of quests. Game Play This is a resource based game. Players must collect various resources which are then consumed to develop or maintain the city. Development is performed by clicking directly on city buildings or surrounding undeveloped land, accessing a menu where resources can be purchased or manipulated (and some resources temporarily stored) or through a series of online dialogues that form quests. Some resources replenish over time while other resources are obtained for direct actions with buildings, visiting neighbors or requesting resources from them, or can be purchased with credit card or PayPal from the developer's online store. Additional themed quests that are only available for a limited amount of time, such as a week or two, regularly appear. Completion of these quests unlock exclusive buildings not available at any other time. With new quests, new buildings and new collectibles are introduced. Resources *Energy is a resource needed for many actions. It recovers at the rate of one energy every three minutes. It can be purchased as batteries which can be used to replenish energy later in the game. Energy can also be gifted by other players (it does not reduce a donor's own energy resources), and can be earned by visiting neighboring cities and performing actions. Energy is fully replenished when a player reaches the next level of experience. *Diamonds are also earned on certain quests and every time the player (as mayor) increases a level of experience. Diamonds are required to purchase premium content, but can also be used to skip quests, collectible requirements, and wait time. *Simoleons are the in-game currency. They are accumulated mainly by interacting with businesses, but also from farms and student jobs. *Materials are used to build and upgrade many structures. They are accumulated by interacting with factories or sending trains from the station. *Fame develops as the player interacts with neighboring territories. Fame can be used for a variety of special purchases. *Experience (XP) appears as turquoise stars and builds a player's level. When experience reaches 100%, there is a reward of simoleons, one diamond, and full energy replenishment. *Collectibles are items that are released by interacting with structures. These are used in developing structures after they have been bought or completing quests. Many collectibles are connected specifically with the type of building they can be released from, such as ticket stubs from attractions or x-ray plates from hospitals. *Population increases unlock specific quests or buildings. It also increases the level of the mayor's house. *Neighbors (other players which are befriended through Facebook) can also staff your structures when necessary, for instance facilities and farms both need a specific complement of avatars from SimCity Social friends to be fully operational. Interaction with neighbors' buildings also provide specific \\"friend/foe\\" collectibles and a more developed relationship (either positively or negatively) increases the likelihood of their appearance. City building Building can only take place on flat, solid land where trees have been bulldozed. All player constructions can be moved at no cost during game play providing the structure has reached a minimum level of development. Some existing game structures may be developed by the player, Some of these require expending purple diamonds to move. The initial city is on a small central area of developable land and a player must purchase more land for expansion using simoleons and collectible land permits. Structures fall into ten categories, some of which require a minimum city population to unlock: *Roads - connect buildings together. They have no cost to build and no cost to remove. Many developments that are unconnected by roads will not function appropriately. *Homes - cost one energy unit and 100 simoleons to build. They generate population as they develop, and their development depends on distance to the waterfront as well as other buildings in the locality. There is no direct way for a player to directly affect the population of a building - only indirectly by the placement of homes or population-increasing structures. The maximum population for a 2 x 2 tile home is 660, but can be upgraded up to 1600. *Farms - The two farm types, vegetable and animal, are purchased using simoleons and generate simoleons as crops/goods mature. Unlike businesses, the amount of time to produce (and therefore the amount of simoleons produced) are variable, but crops can rot and therefore return less simoleons if not collected soon after they are ready. *Businesses - There are several different types of businesses. Most businesses are simply bought, though some business are the result of quests, or require either diamonds or fame to acquire. Businesses generate simoleons on a regular basis, and can produce more when upgraded. *Factories - Factories have a similar range of diversity as businesses, and are obtained in the same way. Factories generate materials on a regular basis, but may also create a pollution cloud, which negates or blocks the structure it is on until it is cleaned at the cost of one energy unit. *Attractions - Attractions increase the population of housing nearby. The effect and range increase with upgrades, as well as their appearance. *Decorations - These include statues, billboards, trees, grass, flowers, pavement, and small entertainment structures such as Ferris wheels or playgrounds. These small structures increase population in nearby housing, or can boost the output of businesses and factories by a certain percentage. *Facilities - Hospitals, fire and police stations all cost simoleons and materials to construct. When they are active in the city, vehicles leave the facilities to control fires, crimes or medical emergencies. Upgrades increase the number of vehicles, and therefore the effectiveness of these facilities. *Landmarks - Large structures that have a substantial impact on population increase in local housing. Landmarks can be accessed through quests, or purchase by simoleons, diamonds, materials or fame. *Friend or foe - These can only be purchased with fame, and most require \\"friend/foe\\" collectibles to be built. They act as landmarks do.

For example, in Judo or Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, where competition is generally divided by belt rank, a practitioner is conventionally not allowed to choose his or her own ranking and thus must compete at a level predetermined by his or her instructor. Sandbagging prohibitions Some officiating organizations attempt to proactively curb the occurrence of sandbagging. These actions range from simple rule restrictions, such as the International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation prohibiting those with a Judo black belt from competing in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu white belt divisions, to organizations such as the North American Grappling Association employing a special tracking system designed to record competitors nationally and potentially re-assign them to a higher skill-level in NAGA events.

As the evidence mounts, it becomes chillingly apparent that one of the two gumshoes is the guilty party.\\" Both Video Movie Guide 2002 and VideoHound's Golden Movie Retriever gave the film two out of five stars. Entertainment Weekly awarded the film a B- grade and wrote: \\"Despite obvious plotting and the most annoying soundtrack this side of Flashdance, Stranger by Night is still worth watching for a bravura performance by veteran video star William Katt in a role that would work perfectly in a big-screen Quentin Tarantino version of Starsky and Hutch. Unfortunately, Katt's wonderfully obnoxious cop is only peripheral to this tale of a tough-guy detective Steven Bauer whose alcoholic blackouts are followed by discoveries of dead hookers and a parade of red herrings.

It acts as a companion app for Xbox video game consoles, providing access to Xbox Live community features, remote control, as well as second screen functionality (formerly branded as SmartGlass) with selected games, applications, and content. On Windows 10, the app additionally serves as a launcher for PC games installed on a device (including games obtained from Microsoft Store and Steam), and provides access to the system's screen recording functions. During E3 2019, the existing version of the Xbox app for Windows 10 was renamed Xbox Console Companion, and a new Xbox app was introduced in beta. The new Xbox app on Windows 10 supports Microsoft's games-on-demand subscription service Xbox Game Pass. Features Through the app, users can access their activity feed, Xbox Live friends and messages, manage their party, watch saved Game DVR clips, browse OneGuide, and view their achievements. Some games and apps can provide second screen integration via the app, displaying supplemental content. The app can also be used as a remote control for the console. The Windows 10 version of the app allows users to stream games from an Xbox One console over a local network, and has the ability to view and edit Game DVR recordings from an Xbox One console. It also serves as a front-end for a PC version of Game DVR on supported hardware (Game DVR settings were moved to the Settings app on Windows 10 version 1703), and has a library display for games installed on the device, such as those obtained via Steam and Microsoft Store. History The original logo of the Xbox One SmartGlass app Xbox 360 SmartGlass was originally announced at E3 2012, for Windows 8, Android and iOS. Microsoft demonstrated use cases for the new app within both games and entertainment, including a minimap for Ascend: New Gods, a second screen experience for School of Rock with supplemental content, and Game of Thrones (with interactive maps and family tree diagrams). With the release of Xbox One in November 2013, Microsoft released an accompanying Xbox One SmartGlass app for Android, iOS, Windows 8.1, and Windows Phone, which contained more extensive functionality for controlling the console. Windows 10 introduced a revamped version of SmartGlass referred to simply as Xbox, which notably added a library display for PC games, and the ability to stream games from an Xbox One console on a local network. On June 12, 2016, the mobile versions of the Xbox One Smartglass apps were updated for parity with the desktop version, and renamed \\"Xbox\\" as well. Xbox 360 SmartGlass was not updated and was discontinued in May 2018. The mobile apps were updated alongside the Xbox One's May 2019 firmware update, adding cross-platform status indicators to friends. On June 9, 2019, coinciding with Microsoft's E3 2019 press conference, Microsoft released a new Xbox app in beta exclusively for Windows 10 May 2019 Update (version 1903), which has a redesigned interface, and serves as the client for Xbox Game Pass on PC. In advance of the conference, Microsoft rebranded the existing Xbox app on Windows 10 as Xbox Console Companion.

Their son, Clarence Stafford was born in October 1906 in Mountain View, California. While working he became an expert in photoengraving and learned photography. This helped him find a job in Shanghai, under a year's contract with the Commercial Press, to install a photoengraving plant, and teach their workman to run it, where he moved with his family in 1909. Frank Stafford was among the first Seventh-day Adventist missionaries to acquire a knowledge of the Shanghai dialect.

The book has been translated into Korean, Chinese, Traditional Chinese, and Japanese.  Inspiration for Howard's Gift  Howard Stevenson & Eric Sinoway on the Harvard Business School campus (circa 2012) Howard's Gift was written by Eric Sinoway after Howard Stevenson, his mentor, professor, and close friend at Harvard University, survived what by all measures should have been a fatal heart attack. Stevenson and Sinoway developed what has been described as a \\"father-son\\" relationship while Sinoway, a mid-career student at Harvard at the time, undertook an independent study with Stevenson, who was then Harvard's Vice Provost for University Planning. Following completion of their student-faculty collaboration, Sinoway joined the Harvard development office and the relationship between the two deepened further. In 2014, after three doctors declared him healthy, Stevenson experienced unattended cardiac arrest on January 5 in the middle of the Harvard campus. With a survival rate of approximately 1%, unattended cardiac arrest is almost always fatal. In Stevenson's case, it almost certainly would have been were it not for a remarkable set of events. * Stevenson collapsed outside of one of the only buildings on the Harvard campus at the time that had a mobile defibrillator. * When a colleague saw him collapse, she ran inside to grab the defibrillator. * While she did, a second colleague ran across campus to Howard's side and began performing CPR. * The colleague who retrieved the mobile defibrillator brought it to his side and administered it. * The individual performing CPR went to his office. On his desk in his office was his mail, which he opened. That day in his mail was his certification of his CPR training from the week before. * An ambulance came to the Harvard Business School campus to retrieve Howard. It was one of two ambulances in the entire city of Boston that had a special clot-busting drug onboard called TPA; TPA is not typically administered in ambulances but bedside in hospitals. The ambulance that arrived at Howard's side happened to have it on board. * The technician on the ambulance that arrived at Harvard Business School had advanced training to give a needle injection directly into the heart, as he did to Howard, who lay unconsciously on the HBS campus. * The technicians worked on Howard for approximately 40 minutes to stabilize him, put him in an ambulance, and rushed him to Mt. Auburn Hospital, where the head of the cardiac unit was on duty. * The Mt. Auburn Hospital medical staff induced a -day coma. Doctors estimate that he went without oxygen for almost 4 minutes after his heart initially stopped. * When Howard was brought out of the coma, given the lack of oxygen to the brain and the trauma of the event, the president of the hospital remarked that it seemed like a virtual impossibility that there had been no cognitive damage ‚Äì which there was not. Following Stevenson's release from the hospital and prolonged recovery at home, Sinoway spent hours a week with him discussing a wide range of topics focused on achieving success and satisfaction in life. It was these discussions that set the foundation for Howard's Gift. Archives and records *Howard H.

While the term was coined by Tushman, the concept was being developed by social scientists from the late 1950s onwards. Most of the early work was conducted in large American corporations with well established R&D; laboratories. The term has since been used in relation to less well defined innovation networks.  Background  The post-WWII years saw the burgeoning of the American corporation and in particular major R&D; labs, for example, Tushman examined the \\"communication activity of all the professionals (N=345) in the R&D; facility of large mid-Western U.S Corporation. The laboratory is isolated from the rest of the corporation and is divided into seven departments (divisional laboratories). The departments are, in turn, organized into separate project areas. The projects were stable over the course of the research and each respondent was a member of only one project.\\" With this increase in spending on R&D;, there was increased interest in the effectiveness of that spending and how to improve the efficiency of commercial research. Of course, all the academic research presented anonymous data from the firms with which they had been working so it is hard to know who the participating laboratories were. Academic adoption The concept of a boundary spanning role has been popular throughout academic research into innovation systems with over 48,000 peer-reviewed articles referencing the term since 1958. With the exception of closed systems, all systems have a transference across their boundaries and this process is facilitated by the boundary spanner. As models of innovation developed, the role of the boundary spanner remained key in seeking out and bringing new ideas into the system or sub-system. Research has also found that boundary spanners tend to be opinion leaders. The role of the boundary spanner, is defined largely by where the boundary is drawn.  Internal boundary spanners  One challenge within the field of knowledge management, is that the collection & codification of explicit knowledge into tacit knowledge is frequently held in silos within the organisation. Boundary spanners are needed to move that knowledge around the organisation in a process sometimes referred to as socialisation. External boundary spanners Where the boundary of the innovation system of interest coincides with the boundary of the organisation, then the role takes on an extra dimension. Boundary spanning is a key element in the Acquisition capacity of a firm in Cohen's theory of absorptive capacity. Individual boundary spanners At the individual level, this may be equated to the Resource Investigator role within Belbin's Team Inventory. Broader adoption The term boundary spanning is now widely used to describe any situation where an individual crosses the boundaries of a social group.

The film stars Ramki and Rahman in the lead roles, while Ramya Krishnan and Roja appear in other pivotal role. The film was produced by Ravi Yadav's Yadavalaya Films, had music scored by Ilaiyaraaja and has late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's assassination and the Sri Lankan civil war as its backdrop. The film began in 1991 and was stuck for thirteen years as the Censor Board refused to allow such a film with a drastic political message to be released, and the film finally released in March 2007 with several cuts. Plot A group of people in a van and ambassador car make their way into an apartment building, start shooting at the guard and proceed to kill people inside the apartment including Padmanabha, the EPRLF leader. They then kill the policemen in the check post and proceed. They are caught by Ramakrishnan (Ramki) and Arun (Rahman). Ramakrishnan also saves Divya (Ramya Krishnan) when she is caught in the chase. When Ramakrishnan questions the leader Sivarasan (Mansoor Ali Khan), he remains silent. Another LTTE member (Rajesh) who was not caught phones Subha Sundaram to release his fellows. Ramakrishnan releases them and they proceed to Sri Lanka. Divya parks her car in a no parking area and refuses to move the car. When asked by a traffic constable, she shows Ramakrishnan's visiting car. Arun orders to seize the car and also tears up the visiting card when Divya shows it. Divya complains to Ramakrishnan and asks him to get the car and an apology from Arun. Ramakrishnan convinces Arun to give her car back. Then Ramakrishnan and Divya get married. One day in a meeting, the DGP (M. N. Nambiar) informs that the state govt may be dismissed, so they have to tighten security in Chennai since ruling party supporters may indulge in violence. Sivarasan, Dhanu and group of 12 people arrive in a boat from Jaffna to Point Calimere, they are received by the smuggler Shanmugam, who accommodates them. Sivarasan exchanges suitcase of gold biscuits for money. Sivarasan then goes to Subha Sundaram's house to find the photographer. Then Subha introduces Hari babu to Sivarasan. Sivarasan insists Haribabu to take photos of all political party leaders homes, offices etc. and when the latter ask for a reason, Sivarasan says it is for a book to be published worldwide. The DGP informs that Rajiv Gandhi (Anupam Kher) will arrive in Sriperumbudur for an election rally and they must guard him since he is under threat of terrorists. Sivarasan and other LTTE members assemble and plan to kill Rajiv Gandhi during the election rally. They then conduct a mock drill of the assassination and prepare a belt bomb. Rajiv Gandhi arrives and gives his answers on Ramjanmabhoomi and the Sri Lankan issue to reporters at a press meet. He then garlands Indira Gandhi's statue and arrives at the venue. Dhanu sneaks in as a person to garland Rajiv Gandhi. Arun doesn't allow her since she is not on the list. When Rajiv Gandhi arrives, he lets Dhanu garland him when a female constable stops her and she activates the bomb. Confusion follows after the blast and wires short-circuit due to the impact. A colleague of Haribabu phones Subha Sundaram that Hari is dead due to the blast. Subha asks him to get Hari's camera saying it is very important. The riots break out in Chennai city due to Rajiv Gandhi's death and a small hotel owner asks Sivarasan and others to leave due to the tension. They all leave in a Maruthi van. The rioters plan to cut up a DMK flag. But a DMK worker (Chandrasekhar) fights them. Ramakrishnan intervenes and the worker recites poetry saying that they are not weak but they follow their party orders since they believe their party as a family. A voiceover of Muthuvel Karunanidhi is heard saying that at this unfortunate time, people may provoke and try to demoralise the party but they must not lose their hope. Arun tries to talk with DGP regarding suspension of officers. A Congress leader asks the DGP to release his party men. The DGP says rowdies and goondas are using this situation so they cannot differentiate between rowdy and party members. Arun asks why they have been suspended the Congress leader says they should be dismissed. Arun loses his cool when the Congress leader says police have chickened out and run, Arun says that since there where no party people and only police, common people died. Arun asks whether they knew of the blast before, he storms out and Ramakrishnan follows him. The DGP asks the leader to go away since politicians and police still have respect. Karthickeyan (Vijayakumar) from (New Delhi) arrives to investigate the case. Sivarasan says they are at a critical stage of their mission and says that the Tamil Nadu coast has come into control of the Indian Navy so they cannot escape via sea. Another LTTE commander (Rajesh) says that Karthickeyan is a competent officer and says that they must not use old contacts and must remain underground till further instructions. Karthickeyan arrives in Chennai. He tells the officials that they must not believe in a single path to cracking the case. He also says that the Press can divert them by posting rumours. He visits the assassination site and then later in headquarters and asks Ramakrishnan to develop the film from Haribabu's camera. In Thiruthuraipoondi, Shankar gets caught and based on his diary, the officers arrest Nalini's mother, brother and finally Nalini and Murugan. Based on their confessions, they arrest Subha Sundaram and Shanmugham and also find a large cache of weapons in the safe house and beaches. Meanwhile the hit squad moves to Mysore and lies low as per instructions. Sivarasan says that only one mission is completed. The investigating team gets information of Sivarasan and others hiding in Konakunte near Mysore. They proceed and after a standoff, Sivarasan and Subha commit suicide and also destroy all evidence. In an ADMK victory celebration of Jayalalithaa, the tigers plan to kill her, but Ramakrishnan recognizes and shoots him. While trying to find out about others, a militant who was disguised as officer kills the militant. Then Ramakrishnan chases him and kills him. The militants then threaten Ramakrishnan that they will kill his wife. Arun goes to Ramakrishnan's home and manages to kill the militant even though he is heavily injured. Another LTTE commander (Rajesh) plans to kill the chief minister through a bomb attached to his police jeep and crash into the CM's car. Ramakrishnan crashes his car and jumps into the sea. In the end, Arun and Geetha are United and Ramakrishnan & Divya have babies and all four are seen on the beach. A militant holding a rifle is shown with the message \\"No More Violence\\" in the ending scene.

The film was launched in July, 1991 and completed the same during December, 1992. In December 2006, in a landmark judgement, the Madras High Court dismissed a petition filed on behalf of the Central Board of Censors against an earlier verdict by the court, allowing the screening of the film with an 'A' certificate after certain cuts. The court subsequently directed the board to award an 'A' certificate to the film within four weeks of their judgement. The petition had alleged that the film supported the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). Sections of the Tamil Nadu Congress had also taken exception to some scenes in the film. Chief Justice of Madras High Court A. P. Shah and Justice K. Chandru viewed the film and found nothing objectionable in it. R. K. Selvamani revealed that the court had actually said there is no need to delete the portions, which the earlier verdict wanted to be cut. The scenes, which the censors wanted to cut, included the Tigers' training and police officers fleeing the venue, where Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated.

History  The Order of Good Hope was founded in 1973, by the republican government of South Africa, to grant those who had distinguished themselves in the promotion of international relationships and to have sensibilised the general interest towards South Africa. It was abolished in 2002. President Nelson Mandela had announced his intention to reform the Order. The new South African government saw the Order as a relic of apartheid, above all because the insignia was considered too European (the rays, the colours, the anchor and the Latin motto of the Order. The insignia was also costing the government around 11,000 rand per initiate. In its place was created the Order of the Companions of O. R. Tambo.  Classes  Awarded to foreign citizens (and, from 1980 to 1988, to South Africans too), for promoting international relations with the increasingly isolated apartheid state. The order was originally divided into five classes: *Grand Collar - for heads of state only. *Grand Cross - for heads of government, ministers of state, judges, presidents of legislatures, secretaries of state, ambassadors, commanders-in-chief, and others. *Grand Officer - for legislators, envoys, senior military officers, and others. *Commander - for charg√©s d'affaires, consuls-general, colonels, and others. * Officer - for consuls, lower-ranking military officers, and others. The order was reorganised in 1988: *Grand Cross - for excellent meritorious service (heads of state and, in special cases, heads of government). *Grand Officer - for outstanding meritorious service (heads of government, ministers of state, judges, presidents of legislatures, secretaries of state, ambassadors, commanders-in-chief, and others). *Commander - for exceptionally meritorious service (legislators, envoys, senior military officers, and others). *Officer - for meritorious service (charg√©s d'affaires, consuls-general, colonels, and others). * Member - for exceptional service (consuls, lower-ranking military officers, and others).

It was the first satellite of the Yantar series and was managed by the Soviet military intelligence agency, the GRU. These satellites were in orbit for 30 days and photographed sites of interest using a film camera. Yantar-2K was proposed in 1967 and had its first test launch in May 1974. It was in military service from 1978 to 1983 and was given the name Feniks (), meaning phoenix. Equipment Yantar differed from Zenit in that it had to stay in orbit for a month unlike Zenit's 8‚Äì14 days. It also had 2 film return capsules, something it had in common with the US KH-7 GAMBIT reconnaissance satellite. Yantar had three parts: the aggregate/equipment module (AO - Agregatnyy Otsek), the instrument module (PO - Pribornnyy Otsek) and the special equipment module/special apparatus module (OSA - otsek spetsialnoy apparatury). The special equipment module was the part that returned to earth at the end of the mission, and contained the Zhemchug-4 (pearl) camera. Each section was shaped like a truncated cone which gave the craft a conical shape. The craft was 6.3m long (although one source says 8.5m) with a maximum diameter of 2.7m. It weighed 6.6 tonnes. The aggregate module was 1.2m long and 2.7m diameter and contained the propulsion unit. It used UDMH fuel with an oxidiser. Attached to it were two solar arrays, each six metres long with four panels. The instrument module was 1m long and 2.4m diameter. It contained most of the equipment including Kvadrat gyroscopes, telemetry systems and attitude control. It was covered in thermal radiator panels. The special equipment module was 3.3m long with a diameter of 2.3m. A shade 2.5m long with a diameter of 0.9m was attached to the front. The module contained the Zhemchug-4 camera, the Salyut-3M computer, film and film handling systems. It also acted as the reentry vehicle. Attached to it were two film return capsules (SpK Spuskayemaya Kapsula) which were 0.8m diameter spheres. They contained retro rockets and could land on the ground or on water. During a thirty-day mission the film return capsules deorbited on the tenth and eighteenth days with the final film returning with the re-entry vehicle. Space historian Peter Gorin estimates that the camera lens had a diameter of 600mm and a focal length of approximately 3000mm to 4000mm. This could give a resolution of 0.5m, although there is some evidence that the lens diameter was only 420mm, which would reduce the ground resolution to only 0.7m. The lens was retractable and had a cover which only opened when the camera was taking photographs. The film type is unknown but might be the same as in the Zenit, which had 300mm x 300mm frames. The camera was developed by the Krasnogorsk Optical-Mechanical Plant (KMZ). The satellite de-orbited by retracting the lens into the special equipment module. The other two modules and the lens shade separated and burnt up in the atmosphere. The reentry vehicle then landed on the ground. The computer and camera were designed to be reusable. The craft contained a self-destruct mechanism. Operation The first test launch of a Yantar-2K was on 23 May 1974 which ended in launch failure and the loss of the satellite. The second flight, on 13 December 1974, was successful and Kosmos 697 landed after 12 days. After seven test launches the satellite was taken into service with the first one on 5 August 1978. There were thirty launches in total, including test launches, with the last one on 28 June 1983. Yantar-2K was replaced by the similar Yantar-4K1, named Oktan. It had its first test launch on 27 April 1979 and had its first operational flight in 1982.

Donnellan completed the MA in Writing at NUI Galway in 2004. Since then he has worked as a novelist, journalist, travel writer, teacher and playwright. He completed his first novel, El Ni√±o, in 2005 and immediately secured a literary agent. He left Ireland soon after and went on to live in Spain, Australia and Canada. While traveling he worked as a travel writer and journalist and co-founded the arts paper Urban Pie in Vancouver. Upon returning to Ireland he went on to work with Druid (2009) and RTE (2010). Later, he established his own theatre company, Truman Town Theatre. All Truman Town Plays are written, directed, and produced by Donnellan. The company exploded on to the theatrical circuit in 2011 with their hit play Sunday Morning Coming Down. Following a national tour, they went on to produce (and tour) two more hugely successful plays: Shortcut to Hallelujah and Gun Metal Grey. These dramas eventually became known as the Ballinrobe Trilogy. Taking a quick step back into the fiction world, El Ni√±o was published in 2012, and Donnellan is currently in negotiations to sell the film rights. Moving slightly from rural settings but not themes, the company toured a fourth Play, Velvet Revolution. An intense two hander set in a stark urban landscape, it created interest in Mick's work among the film industry. He followed Velvet Revolution with his fifth Play ‚Äì Radio Luxembourg and it was immediately optioned by London Film Company Dixon/ Baxi/ Evans and adapted for the screen. While the film was in development, Donnellan's second novel ‚Äì \\"Fisherman‚Äôs Blues.\\" was published to great acclaim. As it rose up the ranks, and enjoyed positive reviews, Mick was taken on board as joint screenwriter on the Radio Luxembourg/Tiger Raid project alongside writers Simon Dixon and Gareth Coulam Evans. After some months commuting to and from London, the script was locked down and a shoot organised in the Jordanian desert. Titled Tiger Raid and directed by Simon Dixon, it starred Brian Gleeson, Damian Molony and Sofia Boutella. It was accepted into the Tribeca film festival (New York) and was also seen at Cannes and Edinburgh, and the Irish Premiere was screened at the Galway Film Fleadh. Tiger Raid was produced by Gareth Coulam Evans and the executive producer was Aporva Baxi. Most recently Donnellan completed work on the exciting screen adaptation of his play Shortcut to Hallelujah with Florence Films. Hot off the press, the screenplay is titled Sam and is based on the gypsy curse supposedly set on the Mayo Football team as they returned home as All Ireland Champions in 1951. Set in the present day, Sam is drenched in Irish lyricism and modern- day dark humour. The script has been met with keen interest by film producers and actors throughout the industry. In May 2019 his third novel was published. It was called Mokusatsu. Donnellan also enjoys lecturing drama and theatre at NUI Galway and adult evening classes in creative writing at the AIT (Athlone Institute of Technology) in County Westmeath.

It mainly used by local and long-distance passenger services.  Route description  The line branches off at the Lietzow (R√ºgen) station on the Stralsund‚ÄìSassnitz railway. It then runs eastward along the northern shore of Kleiner Jasmunder Bodden lagoon. It then swings south and, later, southeast, on a neck of land between the Kleiner Jasmunder Bodden and the Baltic. Parallel to the railway line, between it and the sea, is the four and a half kilometre long complex of Prora. The line ends at the station of Binz at the northern edge of the village. The station is known locally as the \\"Big Station\\" (Gro√üer Bahnhof), in contrast to the small station in the south of the village.  History  Until the 1930s there was only an isolated railway network on the island of R√ºgen. This comprised two standard gauge tracks, the line from Altef√§hr to Sassnitz and the line that branched off in Bergen to Lauterbach. The completion of the R√ºgen Causeway in 1936 meant that, from then on, the island of R√ºgen could be directly accessed by train. By contrast, the onward journey to Binz, the largest seaside resort on R√ºgen, and to the other resorts in the southeast of the island, was complicated by having to change in Bergen auf R√ºgen and Putbus to the narrow gauge line of the R√ºgen Light Railway. In addition, the resort for the Strength through Joy (KDF) organization was built in the second half of the 1930s north of Binz, where 20,000 people were to be accommodated. To connect that and to improve services to Binz, a line was built from Lietzow station to Binz and inaugurated on 15 May 1939. By 1938 the station building in Binz was finished. There were plans for an extension of the route along the coast to Thiessow, as well as the replacement of the narrow gauge railway from Putbus with a standard gauge track. These did not come to fruition due to the outbreak of World War II. The KDF complex was never completed; holiday traffic was not part of the war effort. In 1940, only two pairs of trains ran per day. After the war, the track was initially dismantled as war reparations to the Soviets. But by 1952 it was back in service. A new halt was built in Prora East. Track facilities ast Lietzow station Binz benefited as R√ºgen's role as a tourist destination grew. This also increased the importance of the line again. Prora was a military out-of-bounds area in GDR times and large barracks were set up using the KdF blocks. Accordingly, the railway line became important for military traffic. Several express trains (D-Z√ºge) bringing conscripts stopped at Prora. Depending on the summer timetable, up to six pairs of express trains ran. They connected Binz, to places such as Berlin, Leipzig, Dresden, Erfurt, and, in the late 1980s, even Bratislava. Local passenger services were also relatively frequent; for example, in 1988 a total of twelve pairs of trains operated. Despite its importance, thanks to its high traffic density, the line remained, operationally, just a branch line. Together with the Sassnitz and Stralsund railway, and the connexion to the Mukran Ferry Port, the line was electrified. Electrical services began on 27 May 1989. In 1991, the route was connected to the Deutsche Bahn's Intercity network using IC train \\"R√ºgen\\". Long-distance services were restructured several times, the basic services on the line changed little, however. The number of commuter trains was reduced somewhat in the early 1990s. Several early and late connexions, among other things, were dropped on the closure of the Army barracks at Prora. In the late 1990s, capacity was gradually increased during the day by moving to an hourly timetable.  Train services  Local passenger rail services run hourly, the line being worked by Regional Express Line No. 9 (Regionalexpresslinie 9). Trains run alternately to Lietzow (with connexions to the Sassnitz-Rostock- Stralsund services) and to Stralsund. Three to five pairs of long-distance services run daily, most going to Rostock via Berlin to west or south Germany. At weekends, there is a direct Eurocity connexion to Prague.

Metaforms are rituals, rites, myths, ideas, or stories created to contain emerging knowledge relating to menstruation. Metaformic Theory is founded upon anthropological data and artifacts used in menstruation rites or rituals recorded over the last 400 years. The most common of these are menstrual seclusion rites. Menstrual seclusion rites incorporated three basic restrictions for menstruating women: they must not see light, touch water, or touch the earth. Metaformic theorist, Judy Grahn uses the theory to examine how these restrictions \\"constructed our minds externally, not abstractly, but through using physical metaphors‚Äîmetaforms‚Äîthat embody a comparison to a menstrually based idea.\\" Grahn is referred to as the founder of Metaformic Consciousness.Gajus, Gregory, http://www.metaformia.org/articles/soaked-in-semen-and-blood/ Metaforms themselves have roots in early human culture, but the theory truly emerged when Grahn outlined the Metaformic Theory in her book Blood, Bread, and Roses: How Menstruation Created the World. She continues to write and edit the online journal, Metaformia: A Journal of Menstruation and Culture, which includes many other authors' works on Metaformic Theory and related menstrual topics. Metaformic Theory has been linked to the creation of a \\"post-queer\\" theory.  Key Concepts = Metaformic Consciousness  Metaformic consciousness developed in a period of Chaos, which in this context is a pre- language consciousness \\"when our pre-human ancestors could not perceive shape, color, light, depth, distance, as we do, and had no names for them and no fixed sense of their qualities.\\" For menstruating women the process of menstrual seclusion became a process of learning. The evolution of women's consciousness was due specifically to separation of light and dark. Menstruants were not allowed to look at light in fear of destroying it and sending everyone back into Chaos, creating a way to retain the knowledge gained through these rites as they had not yet discovered language. When women emerged from seclusion into the light, generally at dawn, they began to see the difference between light and dark, between day and night. Many menstrual seclusion rights required that the emerging woman be led through nature by other women of the village as though it were the first time she was seeing it. Separation from above and below was another common feature of seclusion rites. When in seclusion, the menstruant often was made to lay down or stay up in a tree for the remainder of her cycle, creating a physical separation from above and below. Ancient cultures used menstrual imagery to explain and connect the events around them. Menstrual rites, once established, also provided ways to organize other aspects of life, including childbirth, illness and death. People also used metaforms as a tool to understand cause and effect and nature's patterns. They could then begin to predict events such as rainfall and other natural phenomena. By sharing and externalizing metaformic consciousness, our pre-human ancestors left Chaos. Penelope Shuttle and Peter Redgrove point out that, \\"Our words for 'mind' and 'civilization' came from words which mean 'moon experience,'\\" referring to the connection between menstruation and the moon.  The Four Categories of Metaforms  Based on content, all metaforms fall into four categories: Wilderness, Cosmetic, Narrative, and Material. = Wilderness = Wilderness metaforms often include creatures, formations, and elements of nature that depict menstrual ideas. The most common wilderness metaforms feature a creature attracted to female blood or possessing a suggestively feminine shape. The theory analyzes the ways in which many ancient cultures used a variety of animals in metaformic mythology. The Wild Dog family, a common deity of tribes in Africa, Eurasia, and North and South America is commonly used in such mythologies of ancient cultures. The wild dogs, attracted to the smell of blood, created a necessity of seclusion for menstruating women during ancient times. This necessity led to women's menstrual seclusion rites, such as huts built in trees or burying the menstruant and her scents waist deep in a pit with a shelter over her. This seclusion may be seen as a sacrifice to keep the tribe safe from predators, as they were attracted to the smell of blood and the farther the menstruant was from her tribe, the safer they were. Snakes often appear in metaformic mythologies, such as the Wawilak Sisters Snake myth of Australian aboriginal people. Deities from many different cultures are presented in the form of a snake or serpent. In Central America, the Aztec goddess of creation was a snake and in ancient Greece, Gaia, the earth goddess, was a serpent. = Cosmetic = Cosmetic metaforms use \\"human body action, artful movement, shape, ornament and decoration, and even ingestion of meaningful foods,\\" to depict methods of organization of the world. Cosmetic metaforms are the ways in which menstruation rites were made visible upon women's bodies, through various forms of modifications. For many cultures, cosmetic expression after the conclusion of menstrual seclusion was a very specific way of displaying a woman's unique knowledge gained through her experience. Some metaforms were expressed through temporary modifications like painting or dying, while others were more permanent modifications like tattoos, scarification, and embedded objects. = Narrative = Narrative metaforms are based on language, stories, numbers, and sound that \\"came about as people imagined themselves and their originators to be characters in a life cycle.\\" Numbers and measurement are of particular significance in narrative metaforms. Beginning with the earliest examples on lunar calendars, menstruation and the cycles of the moon were intertwined in many cultures. Metaformic Theory references many examples of narrative metaforms across cultures. One example is the Hindu goddess, often known as Kali, who possessed many qualities of the narrative metaform. Know also as the goddess of the dark moon, Kali was also tied to the number three, and often possesses an enraged red face. Metaformic theorists also discuss how cultures, like the Romans and Gaelic used the same words for menstruation and the keeping of time, while the Mayan calendar was directly influenced by women's menstrual cycles. = Material = Material metaforms express our current external cultural ideas through crafting goods from earthen materials. For example, beads, made from animal bones, were dyed and made into necklaces or used for counting menstrual and lunar cycles among ancient women. Necklaces themselves are metaformic, representing the vagina that has powers of creation and destruction. Ancient women crafted jewelry to contain emerging knowledge relating to menstruation and the way the world was organized, fashioning their ontological worldview. Jewelry functions as an expression of human consciousness, abstract thinking, and enhances powers while being an art form made from natural materials. Another material metaform is the rose which is given as a gift to show love and respect, but fundamentally symbolizing the vulva in its blood red form. This plant has been cultivated and crafted through horticulture, made by humans to share and pass on metaformic consciousness.  Ethnomathematics  Mathematician John Kellermeier posits mathematics as quantitative techniques which humans developed as a survival response. Quantitative thinking is seen as a vital element of culture because of its relevance to society. Kellermeier has found that menstruation played a key role in the development of counting and measuring time through anthropological artifacts. Many other scholars also contend that women invented timekeeping through charting their menses on various animal bones and beads. Lunar calendars were not only methods for measuring time; they indicated both the phases of the moon and a woman‚Äôs menstrual cycle. Lunar markings found on prehistoric bone fragments show how early women tracked their cycles and planned families in correlation with the phases of the moon. The earliest form of counting \\"artifacts are menstrual calendar bones, notched with correct lunar cycles, tabulating pregnancy and menstruation.\\" The prehistoric calendar bones include the Ishango bone, the most well known, which was discovered on the shore of a lake in Zaire, Africa, and represented a six-month lunar calendar. The Isturitz Baton represented both a five- and four-month lunar calendar. The Blanchard Bone Plaque represented a two-month lunar calendar. The invention of using beads to family plan is due to the direct correlation of women's menstrual cycles with the lunar cycle. These beads covered in red ochre, which was used in rituals involving nature and perhaps symbolic of menstrual blood, and the animal bones with lunar marking provided the foundations for our elaborate modern mathematic and science systems that took thousands of years for our ancestors to develop. Much of the evidence on lunar calendars are from the Paleolithic period and characterized by the development of venus or feminine figurines. These \\"exact lunar tallies [that] fall within...a complex storied tradition involving at the center a female creatrix figure and all of her characteristic symbols,\\" according to the anthropologist, Alexander Marshack. Feminine figures, such as Venus of Willendorf and Venus of Laussel, bear traces of having been covered in red ochre.  Music  Singer and songwriter, Polly Wood, composed an anthem for metaformia called Bledsung. Wood performed Bledsung live at Kuumbwa Jazz Center in Santa Cruz, California for the \\"Goddesses Sing\\" show on January 25, 2008.  Film  2011 film, Poomarem, which means flowering tree, by Vijay Vipan, illustrates many of the core concepts of metaformic theory. Poomarem focuses on the \\"menstrual origins of sciences and arts, such as geometry, time, painting, and cooking; and also the violence, and the isolation that inevitably accompany the loss of women's rituals within a society.\\" Vipan states that this film is \\"A new relational origin story that women's menstrual rituals are the roots of human culture and that in human evolution women and men have markedly different relationships to blood.\\" This film was shown at the 2011 Rotterdam International Film Festival held in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.

It has been in common use by anarchists in England since the late 19th century. The journal Commonweal, for instance, includes an article by John Creaghe from Sheffield in which he records that the Sheffield Telegraph newspaper 'was furious when it found we were Anarchists with \\"Neither God nor Master\\" for our motto' (11 July 1891, p. 76). An early 20th century usage is evident in a pamphlet handed out by the Industrial Workers of the World during the 1912 Lawrence Textile Strike. The phrase is derived from the French slogan \\"Ni dieu ni ma√Ætre!\\" (literally 'Neither god nor master') coined by the socialist Louis Auguste Blanqui in 1880, when he published a journal by that name. In Joseph Conrad's novel The Secret Agent, first published in 1907, the anarchist character The Professor says: \\"My device is: No God! No master.\\"(Joseph Conrad, The Secret Agent, Pan Classics, 1975 edition, p. 228) Uses Margaret Sanger's feminist pamphlet used the slogan as a subtitle in 1914. Its first use can be traced back to the French journal Ni Dieu ni ma√Ætre, published in 1880 by Auguste Blanqui. The French phrase appears twice in Friedrich Nietzsche's 1886 work Beyond Good and Evil. It appears first in Section 22, in a critique of the notion that nature dictates a morality of equality before the law. It appears again in section 202 where he identifies it with the anarchists and as indicative of their \\"herd\\" mentality, which he is criticizing. It is also the inspiration behind English poet A.E. Housman's \\"The laws of God, the laws of man\\", which was published in 1922 in his final collection, Last Poems. The poem effectively dramatises the psychological urge behind the saying, but also ends with a reflection on the impracticality criticism often levelled at anarchist philosophy. Feminist usage In 1914, Margaret Sanger launched The Woman Rebel, an eight-page monthly newsletter which promoted contraception using the slogan \\"No Gods, No Masters\\". Sanger insisted that every woman was the mistress of her own body. Women without superstition: No gods ‚Äì No Masters! by Annie Laurie Gaylor is a collection of writings by women freethinkers during the 19th and 20th century. Contemporary usage Today the slogan continues to find use in anarchist politics. An anthology of anarchist writing was collected under the title \\"No Gods, No Masters: An Anthology of Anarchism\\". The slogan has also found use in musical cultures, largely associated with the punk movement. But it was first used in the French chanson field, by the anarchist poet and singer-songwriter L√©o Ferr√© who released the song \\"Ni Dieu ni ma√Ætre\\" on an EP in 1965. This song, metaphorically depicting the French death penalty procedure, ends with these verses: \\"This slogan that breaks all the rules / Made for the benefit of fools / Rejecting all authority / Unless respecting liberty / This principle of human rights / I recommend it for your fights / We shall proclaim it to the last / No God no master!\\". The slogan was also chosen as a song title by the English crust punk/heavy metal band Amebix on their EP Who's the Enemy, Swedish death metal band Arch Enemy on their album Khaos Legions, Luxembourgish neofolk/martial band Rome on their album Confessions D'Un Voleur D'Ames, and Chicago-based hardcore band Harm's Way, who released an EP entitled No Gods, No Masters in 2010. The slogan is used as the main chorus in the song \\"Religious Cancer\\" by Nailbomb on their album Point Blank. Canadian female punk band Pantychrist released their song \\"No Gods No Masters\\" in 2014 with lyrics espousing the pro-feminist usage of the phrase that was used as the byline of the 1914 Margaret Sanger newsletter The Woman Rebel. The slogan was rephrased as No Gods, No Managers, as an album title by American crack rock steady band Choking Victim. The phrase has also been modified by religious anarchists, who combine neopagan religiosity and anarchist ideas, to be \\"Many Gods, No masters\\".

Spisak, 558 U.S. 139 (2010), was a United States Supreme Court decision on the applicability of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. It further examined issues of previous court decisions on jury instructions and the effectiveness of counsel. Background Frank Spisak Jr. was convicted of three murders and two attempted murders at Cleveland State University. In 1983 a jury sentenced him to death. His claims were denied by the State of Ohio in direct appeal and to the Ohio Supreme Court stating that his claim was \\"not well-taken on the basis of our review of the record\\". Spisak filed for habeas corpus relief in the District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. First he argued that the jury instructions at the penalty phase of trial unconstitutionally required the jury to consider in mitigation only factors that the jury unanimously found mitigating (violating Mills v. Maryland, 1988).. Second he argued that he had suffered significant harm because his original counsel had given an inadequate closing argument during sentencing (violating Strickland v. Washington, 1984).. The District Court subsequently denied his petition. The petition was accepted on appeal to the Sixth Circuit and blocked the State from executing Spisak. The State of Ohio appealed to the Supreme Court. In Hudson v. Spisak (552 U.S. 945, 2007) the Court remanded the case back to the Sixth Circuit and ordered the appeals court to reconsider in light of two recent cases, Schriro v. Landrigan (2007). and Carey v. Musladin (2006).. The Sixth Court of Appeals again reinstated its earlier opinion. Again the State appealed and the Supreme Court granted review. Decision of the Court The unanimous decision was handed down by Justice Breyer. The court asked two questions; Did the Sixth Circuit disobey the directives of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) and Did the Sixth Circuit exceed its authority when it presumed that Mr. Spisak suffered harm by deficient counsel? It answered yes to both. First Question In Mills v. Maryland (1988), the Supreme Court ruled that when imposing the death penalty the jury must be allowed to consider any mitigating circumstances that included any part of the defendant's record. In addition the jury must be allowed to consider \\"any relevant mitigating evidence.\\" Under the AEDPA a federal court is allowed to override a state court if the state court decision was directly contrary to established Federal Law. The Court ruled that the State of Ohio had not violated the rights of the defendant by requiring the jury to only consider unanimous mitigating factors. In addition the Court overruled the Appeals Court determination that the instructions were unconstitutional on the basis that the jury was precluded from considering other sentencing options until it had rejected the death penalty. The Court criticized the Appeals Court saying \\"we have not previously held jury instructions unconstitutional for this reason, Mills says nothing about this matter.\\" Second Question In Strickland v. Washington (1984), the court ruled that in order for an individual to claim relief for deficient counsel the petitioner must demonstrate that the \\"counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\\" In addition there must be evidence that because of this deficient counsel the result would have different. The Court found that the counsel had done an adequate job. The court went further and stated that even if counsel had not sufficiently defended Spisak there was no reasonable probability that the outcome would have been different. Describing in detail the closing arguments of the trial Justice Stevens went as far to say that Spisak had \\"alienated and ostracized the jury\\".

Location  The camp was located south of G√∂hren in the vicinity of the south beach immediately west of the road from G√∂hren to Lobbe. Somewhat further east is the Baltic Sea. The camp was constructed in 1812. Today only remnants of the earthworks have survived; they have been designated as a heritage site and run parallel to the road. The former encampment is commemorated at the highest point of the earthworks by a rock with the inscription Hessisches Lager im Jahre 1812 (\\"Hessian Camp in 1812\\"). In addition, an information board has been set up. Diagonally opposite is the museum ship, Luise.  History  The tented camp on the shores of the Baltic Sea was erected by two companies of Hesse-Darmstadt troops in a wood. The troops belonged to those states in the Confederation of the Rhine that were allied to Napoleonic France. Strategically, the camp had the aim of preventing the landing of British troops on R√ºgen. There was an encampment laid out for 100 men and a dugout, which was covered with straw and branches. In the centre, an oblong space was created, which was laid out with walkways and grass banks and was described as clean. In addition, a large earth pyramid was built, but there is no trace of it today. The purpose of the pyramid is unclear. It may have served as a signal station or lookout. According to local oral tradition, the discipline of these troops was much better than that of English, Bavarian, Berg and French troops who, at that time, were also periodically stationed in the M√∂nchgut region.

The three castles formed the center of power of the Barons of Gr√ºnenberg in the Oberaargau region during the High Middle Ages. History Plan of the castle from archeological digs in the 1850s. 1-7 are Langenstein Castle 8-9 are Schnabelburg and 10-23 are Gr√ºnenberg Castle The complex of three ruined castles sit on a hill above the village of Melchnau. The Lords of Langenstein were first mentioned in 1194 when they helped found St. Urban's Abbey. The castle was likely built around that same time. Shortly thereafter, the Barons of Gr√ºnenberg inherited the Langenstein lands which they ruled from Gr√ºnenberg Castle. Between the 12th and 15th centuries, Gr√ºnenberg Castle was a cultural and political center for the nobility that ruled over much of the Oberaargau region. As the family split into separate branches, including the Schnabel von Gr√ºnenberg, Grimm von Gr√ºnenberg and Gr√ºnenberg vom Albis, a third castle was added to the complex. In the 14th and 15th centuries, the families expanded their power through marriage, purchase or holding fiefs for the Habsburg or Kyburg families. Their influence spread out from the Oberaargau into the Bernese Oberland. In 1383-84, during the Burgdorferkrieg, the castles and village were attacked and captured by Bernese troops. After the war, the lands and castles were returned to the Gr√ºnenbergs after they entered into a treaty with Bern. In 1432, the family sold Aarwangen to Bern and the last resident of Gr√ºnenberg Castle, the knight Wilhelm of Gr√ºnenberg, moved to Rheinfelden. In 1444 Gr√ºnenberg Castle was besieged and occupied by Bern. The Gr√ºnenberg lands were annexed and a Bernese vogt or bailiff moved into the castle. In 1452 the last male Gr√ºnenberg heir, Wilhelm, died and in 1480 the family sold Langenstein castle to Bern.Gr√ºnenberg Castle accessed 4 June 2012 After the Gr√ºnenberg lands were absorbed by Bern, it became part of the Bailiwick of Aarwangen. The castles were abandoned and began to slowly fall into ruin. In 1850, the municipal president Jakob K√§ser began to study the ruins, which he documented in a book, the K√§ser-Chronik in 1855. In 1949 the old castle chapel was excavated and roof was built over the chapel ruins to prevent further decay. Between 1992 and 1998 the rest of the ruins were excavated and preserved.Gr√ºnenberg Castle- archeology accessed 5 June 2012 Location The ruins are located on a hilltop just outside the village of Melchnau. From the parking lot in Melchnau Oberdorf, it takes about 10 minutes to follow a well marked trail to the ruins. Gr√ºnenberg castle site Plan of Gr√ºnenberg Castle The first castle was probably a wooden fort from the 10th or 11th centuries. It was replaced in the 12th century by a stone curtain wall and a tower that would later be replaced by the donjon in the north-west corner. The wall had a silicate core with a shell of roughly trimmed sandstone blocks. The rock was quarried in trenches near the castle grounds. Shortly thereafter, the south and north residences were added inside the curtain wall. The original castle entrance was to the southeast. The southeast wall was protected by two trenches, which were spanned by a bridge at the original castle gate. The castle chapel and well house were added later, probably in the 13th century, onto the south residence. During the 14th century the castle expanded as the fortunes of the family grew. The northern residence block was extended and dominated the entire northern side of the castle. The castle gate was relocated to the northern corner. The steep cliff face on the northeast limited the size of the gatehouse. The large circular oven was added to the western side of the courtyard at about the same time.

It embraces a set of epistemological theories, teaching strategies, approaches to content, classroom practices, and teacher-student relationships. Feminist pedagogy, along with other kinds of progressive and critical pedagogy, considers knowledge to be socially constructed.  Overview  The purpose of feminist pedagogy is to create a new standard in the classroom or possibly even take away the standards classrooms hold. For example, a classroom that is liberating and without any sort of binary. Feminist Pedagogy naturally creates a new method of teaching, where its skills and knowledge is not just limited to a classroom but rather society as a whole. Classrooms that employ feminist pedagogy use the various and diverse experiences located within the space as opportunities to cultivate learning by using; life experiences as lessons, breaking down knowledge, and looking at gender, race, and class as one. Feminist pedagogy addresses the power imbalances present in many westernized educational institutions and works toward de-centering that power. Within most traditional educational settings, the dominant power structure situates instructors as superior to students. Feminist pedagogy rejects this normative classroom dynamic, seeking to foster more democratic spaces functioning with the understanding that both teachers and students are subjects, not objects. Students are encouraged to reject normative positions of passivity and to instead take control of their own learning. By taking action in their learning students are encouraged to develop critical thinking and analysis skills. These abilities are then used to deconstruct and challenge the issues in our society such as, \\"oppressive characteristics of a society that has traditionally served the politically conservative and economic privileged.\\" The theoretical foundation of feminist pedagogy is grounded in critical theories of learning and teaching such as Paulo Freire's Pedagogy of the Oppressed. Feminist pedagogy is an engaged process facilitated by concrete classroom goals in which members learn to respect each other's differences, accomplish mutual goals, and help each other reach individual goals. This process facilitates participatory learning, validation of personal experience, encouragement of social understanding and activism, and the development of critical thinking and open-minds. It identifies the practical applications of feminist theory, while promoting the importance of social change, specifically within the institutional hierarchy found in academia. Feminist pedagogy is employed most frequently in women's studies classes, which aim to transform students from objects to subjects of inquiry. However, the use of feminist pedagogy is not restricted only to women's studies courses.  Atmosphere of Schools  Who owns the knowledge? Who decides what we get to learn and how we learn it? Not only does the education system decide this for us they also decide who we are; and what we are limited to do/ know. Feminist pedagogy arises from the rejection of traditional institutional structures and practices. For example, western schools, specifically within the U.S. is creating a capital off of all these ambitious students. Especially when it comes to higher education many people varying from the ages 17-20 are led to believe that they need to take out thousands of dollars in loans to survive. However, the one thing many students complain they never learned in school how to deal with money, in effect making them a victim of this capitalist society. The educational climate of schools, the result of dominant neoliberal competitive ideologies downplays and discourages communal process of learning, research, and community action. Classroom power dynamics operating within neoliberal institutions, exhibit a competitive style of engagement that employs fear and shame as a motivator for student growth. Traditional approaches to education maintain the status quo, reinforcing current power structures of domination. The \\"academic work process is essentially antagonistic to the working class, and academics, for the most part, live in a different world of culture, different ways that make it, too, antagonistic to working-class life.\\" In contrast, feminist pedagogy rejects societal systems of oppression, recognizing and critiquing institutional and individual compliance associated with the academy that perpetuates larger ongoing societal oppression. The classroom is a microcosm of how power is disturbed and exercised in the larger society. \\"Students use subtle means to keep their vested power and attempt to enforce and replicate the status quo in the classroom.\\"  Qualities of feminist pedagogy  Critical pedagogy advances the idea that knowledge is not static and unitary but rather results from an open-ended process of negotiation and interaction between teacher and student. Feminist pedagogy, as an offshoot of critical pedagogy, further holds that gender plays a critical role in the classroom, influencing not only \\"what is taught, but how it is taught.\\" Like all forms of critical pedagogy feminist pedagogy aims \\"to help students develop consciousness of freedom, recognize authoritarian tendencies, and connect knowledge to power and the ability to take constructive action.\\" Feminist pedagogy aligns itself with many forms of critical pedagogy including those focused on race and ethnicity, class, post colonialism and globalization. The introduction of the book Feminist Pedagogy: Looking Back to Move Forward by Robbin D. Crabtree explained the qualities and distinctions from critical pedagogy: > Like Freire's liberatory pedagogy, feminist pedagogy is based on assumptions > about power and consciousness-raising, acknowledges the existence of > oppression as well as the possibility of ending it, and foregrounds the > desire for and primary goal of social transformation. However feminist > theorizing offers important complexities such as questioning the notion of a > coherent social subject or essential identity, articulating the multifaceted > and shifting nature of identities and oppressions, viewing the history and > value of feminist consciousness-raising as distinct from Freirean methods, > and focusing as much on the interrogation of the teacher's consciousness and > social location as the student's. Feminist pedagogy concerns itself with the examination of societal oppressions, working to dismantle the replication of them within the institutional settings. Feminist educators work to replace old paradigms of education with a new one which focuses on the individual's experience alongside acknowledgment of one's environment. It addresses the need for social change and focuses on educating those who are marginalized through strategies for empowering the self, building community, and ultimately developing leadership. Feminist pedagogy, operating within a feminist framework, embodies a theory about the transference of knowledge that shapes classroom practices by providing criteria to evaluate specific educational strategies and techniques regarding the desired course goals or outcomes. Many distinctive qualities characterize feminist pedagogies and the instructional methods that arise out of feminist approaches. Of the associated attributes, some of the most prominent features include the development of reflexivity, critical thinking, personal and collective empowerment, the redistribution of power within the classroom setting, and active engagement in the processes of re-imaging. The critical skills fostered with the employment of a feminist pedagogical framework encourages recognition and active resistance to societal oppressions and exploitations. Also, feminist pedagogies position its epistemological inquiries within the context of social activism and societal transformation. Reflectivity, essential to the execution of feminist pedagogy, allows students to examine the positions they occupy within society critically. Positions of privilege and marginalization are decoded, producing a theorization and greater understanding of one's multifaceted identity and the forces associated with the possession of a particular identity. Critical thinking is another quality of feminist pedagogy that is deeply interconnected with practices of reflectivity. The critical thinking encouraged by feminist pedagogy is firmly rooted in everyday lived experiences. Critical thinking is employed inside and outside of the classroom space to challenge dominant cultural narratives and structures. Empowerment within the classroom setting is central to feminist pedagogical instructional techniques. Students are confirmed in their identities and experiences and are encouraged to share with the space personal understandings to build a diverse and intersectional base of knowledge. Classroom spaces that operate from within a feminist pedagogical framework value integrity of the participants and the collective respect of existing differences in experiences and knowledge. Validation of student realities fosters the development of individual talents and ability and solidification of group cohesion. Empowerment of the student body is achievable through the intentional dissemination of traditional classroom power relations. It is understood and central to the success and progression of the classroom space that power is shared throughout all its constituents. In traditional academic settings, the position of power is maintained through the authority exercised by the instructor. The structure of this power relation solely validates the teacher's experiences and knowledge, maintaining that students have little to offer in the facilitation of learning. At its core, feminist pedagogy aims to decenter power in the classroom to give students the opportunity to voice their perspectives, realities, knowledge, and needs. This tool will utilize the process of decentering power, where the educator distances themselves from their authority status and enables their students to have equal footing with them. Unlike many other methods of teaching, feminist pedagogy challenges lectures, memorization, and tests as methods for developing and transferring knowledge. Feminist pedagogy maintains that power in the classroom should be delicately balanced between teacher and students to inform curriculum and classroom practices. The sharing of energy creates a space for dialogue that reflects the multiple voices and realities of the students. By sharing the power and promoting voice among students, the educator and students move to a more a democratic and respectful relationship that recognizes the production of knowledge by both parties. The shared power also decentralizes dominant traditional understandings of learning by allowing students to engage with the professor freely, instead of having the professor give students information. Feminist pedagogical theorists not only question the current climate of the classroom but engage in speculations of what it could exist as. Understandings facilitated within the classroom space is not meant to live within the confines of academia but are encouraged to promote social activism. Theory and classroom explorations are positioned to their social contexts and implications. Students are encouraged to take what they learn in the classroom and apply their understandings to institute social change. History Feminist pedagogy evolved in conjunction with the growth of women's studies within the academic institution. The increased awareness of sexism occurring on college campuses and the need to promote professionalism within certain segments of the women's movement resulted in the institutionalization of women's studies programs. The institutionalization of women's studies programs, facilitated the challenging of existing canons and disciplines which is reflected in classroom teaching methods. \\"The field of Women's Studies has expanded dramatically since the first courses were offered in 1970. The critiques of dominant paradigms and compensatory research efforts that characterized its early stages generated an explosion of scholarship that has significantly expanded the undergraduate women's studies curriculum, made possible the development of graduate level instruction, and propelled efforts to integrate the evolving scholarship on women across the curriculum. Throughout the evolution of the field, the processes of teaching women's studies courses have received considerable scholarly attention, resulting in a significant body of theory that attempts to define elements of feminist teaching\\".  Influential figures = Paulo Freire  Paulo Freire Theorist Paulo Freire is known for his work in the field of critical pedagogy, of which feminist pedagogy is a particular manifestation. In his book Pedagogy of the Oppressed 1968, Freire used Marxist theory to argue that the student- teacher relationship reflected and reinforced problematic societal power structures. He also argued against what he called the banking model of education, in which a student is viewed as an empty account waiting to be filled by the teacher, writing \\"it transforms students into receiving objects. It attempts to control thinking and action, leads men and women to adjust to the world, and inhibits their creative power.\\" Freire's work emphasized the need for teachers to eschew their class perspective and see both education and revolution as process of shared understanding between the teacher and the taught, the leader and the led. Feminist pedagogy, as it has developed in the United States, provides a historically situated example of critical pedagogy in practice. Feminist conceptions of education are similar to Freire's pedagogy in a variety of ways, and feminist educators often cite Freire as the educational theorist who comes closest to the approach and goals of feminist pedagogy. Both feminist pedagogy as it is usually defined and Freirean pedagogy rest upon visions of social transformation; underlying both are certain common assumptions concerning oppression, consciousness, and historical change. Both pedagogies assert the existence of oppression in people's material conditions of existence and as a part of consciousness. They also rest on a view of consciousness as more than a sum of dominating discourses, but as containing within it a critical capacity ‚Äî what Antonio Gramsci called \\"good sense\\"; and both thus see human beings as subjects and actors in history and hold a strong commitment to justice and a vision of a better world and the potential for liberation.  bell hooks  bell hooks bell hooks is an accomplished American writer, author, feminist, and social activist. In Teaching to Transgress: Education as the Practice of Freedom, she argues that a teacher's use of control and power over students dulls the students' enthusiasm and teaches obedience to authority, \\"confining each pupil to a rote, assembly-line approach to learning.\\" She advocated that universities encourage students and teachers to collaborate, making learning more relaxing while simultaneously exciting. She describes teaching as \\"a catalyst that calls everyone to become more and more engaged\\" in what she calls engaged, interactive, transgressive pedagogies. Hook's pedagogical practices exist as an interplay of anti-colonial, critical, and feminist pedagogies and are based on freedom, \\"Creating a Community in the Classroom‚Äù that resembles both democratic process and healthy family life, as shaped by 'mutual willingness to listen, to argue, to disagree, and to make peace'. hooks also built a bridge between critical thinking and real-life situations, to enable educators to show students the everyday world instead of the stereotypical perspective of the world. hooks argues that teachers and students should engage in interrogations of cultural assumptions that are supported by oppression.  Patti Lather  Patti Lather has taught qualitative research, feminist methodology, and gender and education at Ohio State University since 1988. She is a renowned feminist author with a total of four published books. Lather focuses on critical feminist issues and theories, and has recently started research on the relationship between feminism and education.  Ileana Jim√©nez  Ileana Jim√©nez is a high school teacher in New York City who teaches courses on feminism, LGBT literature, Toni Morrison, and memoir writing. She is nationally known for her book and speaking about inclusivity in high schools, her work to make schools safer spaces for LGBT students, and has won numerous awards for curriculum development.She was heavily influenced in her feminism and her pedagogy by bell hooks. Jim√©nez teaches a class at Elisabeth Irwin High School in New York called \\"Fierce and Fabulous: Feminist Writers, Artists, and Activists.\\" This class consists of juniors and seniors. The objective of this class is to bring feminism to the attention of teens. Educate through an intersectional lens to help students comprehend their lives. Jim√©nez wants to apply the feminist pedagogy to engage her students with the national and global issues of our everyday lives. \\"Intersections, which explains how intersectionality helps understand power and oppression, identity and agency.\\"  Judy Chicago  Judy Chicago is an American artist, art educator and writer. She is best known for her work as a feminist artist and a pioneering feminist educator in the arts. Chicago developed the first feminist art program at Fresno State College in 1970. In 1972 Womanhouse was exhibited at CalArts to an audience of over 10,000. This large scale installation was the product of Judy Chicago and Miriam Schapiro Feminist Art Program and one of the first art pieces of its kind to center the experiences of women. Since then, Chicago has become a leading voice in Art Education. Her career as an art educator is chronicled in her 2014 book Institutional Time: A Critique of Art Education. Her collection of feminist teaching materials from 1970 to 2005 are archived at Penn State University where it is accessible through the Judy Chicago Art Education Collection.  Practical implementation  Shimer College students engage in a decentered discussion of Sappho. At its core, feminist pedagogy aims to decenter power in the classroom to give students the opportunity to voice their perspectives, realities, knowledge, and needs. This can be utilized through the process of decentering power, where the educator distances themselves from their authority status and enables their students to have equal footing with them. Pedagogy can also be implemented practically through the use of engaging in activism, within the classroom and outside of it. Decentering power One of the central tenets of feminist pedagogy is transforming the teacher and student relationship. Under this teaching method, educators seek to empower students by offering opportunities for critical thinking, self-analysis, and development of voice. Unlike many other ways of teaching, feminist pedagogy challenges lectures, memorization, and tests as methods for developing and transferring knowledge. Feminist pedagogy maintains that power in the classroom should be delicately balanced between teacher and students to inform curriculum and classroom practices. The sharing of energy creates a space for dialogue that reflects the multiple voices and realities of the students. By sharing the power, to promote voice among students, the educator and students move to an equal position in which students produce knowledge. The shared power also decentralizes Consciousness Raising One of the primary methods that feminist teachers utilize this decentering of power is through the process known as \\"consciousness raising.\\" Popularized in the early 1970s, the technique is implemented usually by sitting in a circle and discussing one's own experiences and by finding commonalities that individuals thought were only personal matters of their own lives. Ideally, consciousness raising is used as a method to increase the number of people who are aware of a social issue or problem.  Questioning and Debriefing  Similar to Consciousness Raising, questioning and debriefing calls for a discussion. The idea of it is to help students realize their own personal stereotypes that stem from race, class, and any other background characteristics. The end goal is to create a reflective discussion on how each of them have more than likely been a victim of some type of discrimination and to call for action from that moment on. The call for action could include bringing in guest speakers and having them hear other stories, or for a more interactive assignment perform a skit. Whatever it may be the objective is to end the prejudice behavior. Activist projects Activist projects encourage students to identify real-life forms of oppression and to recognize the potential of feminist discourse outside of the academic realm. The goals of this practical application of feminist pedagogy include raising students' consciousness about patriarchal oppression, empowering them to take action, and helping them learn specific political strategies for activism. Students' activist projects have taken a variety of forms, including organizing letter-writing campaigns or writing letters to the editor, confronting campus administration or local law enforcement agencies, organizing groups to picket events, and participating in national marches. Feminist teachers who have written about their experiences assigning activist projects recognize that this non-traditional method can be difficult for students. One noted difficulty along the way, including students who resisted putting themselves in a controversial position and students who had trouble dealing with backlash. Since they want students to have a positive, yet challenging (often first) experience with activism, they often give students a great deal of freedom in choosing a project. Teachers may ask students to develop a project that would \\"protest sexism, racism, homophobia, or any other 'ism' related to feminist thought in one situation.\\" Feminist assessment The literature on feminist assessment is sparse, possibly because of the discrepancy between notions of feminism and assessment. For example, traditional assessments such as standardized tests validate the banking model of education, and the concept of assessment in the form of grades or ability to advance within a structured curriculum is a form of power held by an institution. Nonetheless, the literature on feminist pedagogy does contain a few examples of feminist assessment techniques. These techniques decenter the power structure upheld by traditional assessment by focusing on student voice and experience, which allows students agency as they participate in the assessment process. The use of journaling is considered to be one feminist assessment technique as well as the idea of \\"participatory evaluation,\\" or evaluations characterized by interactivity and trust. Assessment techniques borrowed from critical pedagogy should be considered when thinking of feminist assessment approaches. These may include involving students in the creation of assessment criteria or peer assessment or self-assessment. Finally, Accardi argues feminist assessment approaches can be embedded into more traditional forms of assessment (such as classroom assessment techniques or performance assessment techniques) if students are allowed to reflect on or evaluate their experiences. Surveys, interviewing and focus groups, too, could be considered assessments with a feminist approach provided that a student voice or knowledge is sought. These assessment strategies should be tailored to the type of instruction taking place; performance assessment techniques may be more appropriate for short term instruction. If the instructor has more time with the learner, then the opportunity for more in-depth, reflective feedback and assessment is possible. Critiques There are several elements of feminist pedagogy that has been criticized over the years. The distinctiveness of feminist pedagogy from other critical and progressive pedagogies have been brought into question. Feminist pedagogy shares intellectual and political roots with the movements comprising the liberator education agenda of the past 30 years. These movements have challenged traditional conceptions of the nature and role of education, and of relationships among teachers, learners, and knowledge. They have promoted efforts to democratize the classroom, to clarify and expose power relationships within and outside the classroom, and to encourage student agency, both personal and political. Moreover, they have called for education to be relevant to social concerns, arguing that knowledge generated and transmitted in the classroom should relate to the lives of those it describes and facilitate social justice in the world at large. Exploring the similarities between feminist and other critical and progressive pedagogies, the argument that feminist pedagogy is not entirely distinct from other pedagogies in its ideologies and strategies contains some validity. Feminist pedagogy aims to redistribute power throughout the classroom. Although attempts to restructure power relations there remains the possibility of maintaining traditional educational hierarchy in feminist classrooms. \\"Even those professors who embrace the tenets of critical pedagogy (many of whom are white and male) still conduct their classrooms in a manner that only reinforced bourgeois models of decorum.\\" The intentionality behind efforts to redistribute power have the possibility of simply masking power relations rather than authenticity exposing and addressing the compositional makeup of power. Regardless of efforts to create a more egalitarian teacher/student interactions, teachers still largely determine the direction of the classroom, it is teachers who \\"set the agenda and assign grades, not the students. Feminist Pedagogy, focusing acutely on the power relations between student and teacher can often fail to address the power dynamics that operate among class participants. \\"As the classroom becomes more diverse, teachers are faced with the way the politics of domination are often reproduced in the educational setting. For example, white male students continue to be the most vocal in our classes. Students of color and some white women express fear that they will be judged as intellectually inadequate by these peers. Hegemonic white feminism has been criticized for being oppressive in its failure to address and incorporate intersectionality within its ideological consciousness. Many have charged American feminism with claims of racism class elitism from within its mostly academic boundaries, charging that American feminism has become another sphere of academic elitism. It is important to note that many white female (and male) scholars, even self-identified feminists, do not value everyone's presence in the collective effort of women's or human liberation, hooks refers to these folks as co-oppressors in society, alongside others from privileged classes who do not participate in struggles against oppression in our complex society. Bernice Fisher points out how feminist pedagogy is at odds with its historical roots in the tradition of \\"consciousness raising.\\" Consciousness raising groups were an important part of the women's liberation movement of the 1960s and 1970s. Through these groups, individuals were able to recognize that they shared similar struggles. Thus the number of people aware of a particular social issue increased. \\"Most discussion of feminist pedagogy can be seen as a struggle to reconcile the consciousness raising vision with the realities of higher education. Since the latter assumes and generally supports competition and an individualistic orientation toward learning, one of the first problems for the feminist teacher is to create the kind of trust which consciousness raising presupposes.\\" With the institutionalization of women's studies within the academic, feminist teacher were dispersed into \\"less radical universities, community colleges and other contexts where the rhetoric of feminism was far less familiar and more threatening, the situation tended to be reversed, teachers who were activists were in touch with, or part of, the changing women's movement, and in a sense became its representatives to the students.

The purpose of DCNA is to protect the extensive biological resources and promote sustainable development of the natural resources of these islands, both on land and at sea. To do so, DCNA is developing sustainable funding sources such as a trust fund, building capacity through training workshops and promoting the overwhelmingly beautiful and unique nature, ranging from exuberant rainforest to coral reefs and pearl white sand dunes. The extensive biological resources are the basis of one of the main sources of income on the islands: nature tourism. DCNA not only focuses on the sustainable management of existing protected areas, but also to increase awareness and knowledge of the value of nature.

The district encompassed Jerusalem as well as Bethlehem, Hebron, Jaffa, Gaza and Beersheba. During the late Ottoman period, the Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem, together with the Sanjak of Nablus and Sanjak of Akka (Acre), formed the region that was commonly referred to as \\"Palestine\\".The 1915 Filastin Risalesi (\\"Palestine Document\\") is a country survey of the VIII Corps of the Ottoman Army, which identified Palestine as a region including the sanjaqs of Akka (the Galilee), the Sanjaq of Nablus, and the Sanjaq of Jerusalem (Kudus Sherif), see Ottoman Conceptions of Palestine- Part 2: Ethnography and Cartography, Salim Tamari It was the 7th most heavily populated region of the Ottoman Empire's 36 provinces. The district was separated from Damascus and placed directly under the Ottoman central government in Constantinople (now Istanbul in English) in 1841, and formally created as an independent province in 1872 by Grand Vizier Mahmud Nedim Pasha. Scholars provide a variety of reasons for the separation, including increased European interest in the region, and strengthening of the southern border of the Empire against the Khedivate of Egypt. Initially, the Mutasarrifate of Acre and Mutasarrifate of Nablus were combined with the province of Jerusalem, with the combined province being referred to in the register of the court of Jerusalem as the \\"Jerusalem Eyalet\\", and referred to by the British consul as creation of \\"Palestine into a separate eyalet\\". However, after less than two months, the sanjaks of Nablus and Acre were separated and added to the Vilayet of Beirut, leaving just the Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem. In 1906, the Kaza of Nazareth was added to the Jerusalem Mutasarrifate, as an exclave, primarily in order to allow the issuance of a single tourist permit to Christian travellers. The area was conquered by the Allied Forces in 1917 during World War I and a military Occupied Enemy Territory Administration (OETA South) set up to replace the Ottoman administration. OETA South consisted of the Ottoman sanjaks of Jerusalem, Nablus and Acre. The military administration was replaced by a British civilian administration in 1920 and the area of OETA South was incorporated into the British Mandate of Palestine in 1923. The political status of the Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem was unique to other Ottoman province since it came under the direct authority of the Ottoman capital Constantinople. The inhabitants identified themselves primarily on religious terms, 84% being Muslim Arabs. The district's villages were normally inhabited by farmers while its towns were populated by merchants, artisans, landowners and money-lenders. The elite consisted of the religious leadership, wealthy landlords and high-ranking civil servants. History In 1841, the district was separated from Damascus and placed directly under Constantinople and formally created as an independent Mutasarrifate in 1872. Before 1872, the Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem was officially a sanjak within the Syria Vilayet (created in 1864, following the Tanzimat reforms). The southern border of the Mutasarifate of Jerusalem was redrawn in 1906, at the instigation of the British, who were interested in safeguarding their imperial interests and in making the border as short and patrollable as possible., pp. 369‚Äì370 In the mid-19th century the inhabitants of Palestine identified themselves primarily in terms of religious affiliation. The population was 84% Muslim Arabs, 10% Christian Arabs, 5% Jewish, and 1% Druze Arabs. Towards the end of the 19th century, the idea that the region of Palestine or the Mutasarifate of Jerusalem formed a separate political entity became widespread among the district's educated Arab classes. In 1904, former Jerusalem official Najib Azuri formed in Paris, France the Ligue de la Patrie Arabe (\\"Arab Fatherland League\\") whose goal was to free Ottoman Syria and Iraq from Turkish domination. In 1908, Azuri proposed the elevation of the mutassarifate to the status of vilayet to the Ottoman Parliament after the 1908 Young Turk Revolution. The area was conquered by the Allied Forces in 1917 during World War I and a military Occupied Enemy Territory Administration (OETA South) set up to replace the Ottoman administration. OETA South consisted of the Ottoman sanjaks of Jerusalem, Nablus and Acre. The military administration was replaced by a British civilian administration in 1920 and the area of OETA South became the territory of the British Mandate of Palestine in 1923, with some border adjustments with Lebanon and Syria.

The area was important for two reasons. The cold climate produced some of the densest and thickest beaver fur in North America. The number of furs produced was somewhat greater than its only rival, the Saskatchewan River fur trade. Secondly, the great distance from Montreal and Hudson Bay required the highly developed and efficient transportation system that characterized the Hudson's Bay Company in the nineteenth century. The natural center of the trade was the Peace-Athabasca Delta at the west end of Lake Athabasca. The lake itself led eastward into relatively poor country. To the north, the Slave River and Mackenzie River led to the Arctic Ocean. To the west, the Peace River (Canada) led to the Rocky Mountains. To the south the Athabasca River led southwest to the Rocky Mountains with connections to the Columbia District across the mountains on the Pacific coast and also connections south to the North Saskatchewan River. The administrative center of the region was the depot at Fort Chipewyan on the west end of the lake where out-going furs and in-coming trade goods were stored. The route eastward was south up the Athabasca River, east up the Clearwater River (Saskatchewan) to Methye Portage, east down the Churchill River to Frog Portage, south down the Sturgeon-Weir River to the depot at Cumberland House, Saskatchewan, east down the Saskatchewan River to Lake Winnipeg and from there either to Hudson Bay or Montreal.

From 1989 until 2014, Fowler was the primary studio host for college football. Fowler is also a regular anchor on ESPN for coverage of tennis and soccer. In 2014, he replaced Brent Musburger as the play-by-play announcer for Saturday Night Football on ABC, having him on ESPN's top announcing team alongside fellow College Gameday's Kirk Herbstreit; this meant he would also be selected to announce one of the two College Football Playoff semifinal games and the College Football National Championship.Michael Humes, Chris Fowler Signs Extension with ESPN Through 2023, ESPN Media Zone, March 13, 2014 Career Fowler and Desmond Howard handling post-game coverage for College GameDay in 2009 Prior to joining ESPN, Fowler spent nearly two years at KCNC-TV, then the NBC affiliate in Denver, as a production assistant, a producer/writer and as a sports reporter. In 1984, he worked for several months at KMGH-TV in the same city as an intern in the sports department. Fowler joined ESPN in July 1986 as the host/reporter of Scholastic Sports America, a stint which lasted two years. In 1988, he began serving as a college football sideline reporter for two seasons. While on the college football beat, Fowler conducted an exclusive interview with former star University of Oklahoma quarterback Charles Thompson, who was in prison at the time on drug charges. He began as host of the College GameDay football road show in 1990 and expanded to ESPN's other Saturday college football segments in 1991. After Charles Woodson won the 1997 Heisman Trophy over Tennessee's Peyton Manning, Tennessee fans blamed ESPN and in particular, Fowler, who had emceed the award ceremony and handed the trophy to Woodson. Fowler received abuse from Tennessee fans (and he described the reaction as \\"trailer park frenzy\\" on a radio show), and GameDay avoided shooting on the Tennessee campus for several years that followed. Fowler in 2007 In February 2015, ESPN announced Rece Davis would take over for Fowler as host of GameDay, but that Fowler would continue his play-by-play role on Saturday Night Football on ABC and College Football Playoff games, and as host of the annual Heisman Trophy presentations. Until 2006, he was also the lead studio host of College Basketball on ESPN. Fowler has also worked with ESPN's Summer X Games from 1995 to 2000 and the Winter X Games from 1998 to 2000 as well as horse racing broadcasts, including the Breeders Cup World Thoroughbred Championship on ESPN. In addition, he serves as the head play-by-play for tennis tournaments broadcast on ESPN, including Wimbledon, Australian Open, French Open and for the US Open being broadcast for the first year in 2009 on ESPN. In 2010, he anchored, along with Mike Tirico, ESPN's and ABC's month- long coverage of the 2010 FIFA World Cup. In 2020, Fowler announced the first game of the Monday Night Football Kickoff Week doubleheader alongside Kirk Herbstreit. He is also the host of the ESPN Classic show SportsCentury. Education A graduate of the University of Colorado in 1985 with a Bachelor of Science degree, Fowler was the first recipient of the Alan Berg Memorial Journalism Scholarship, awarded by the Denver Press Club. While an undergraduate, Fowler, a Denver-area native, served as a producer and co-host for a weekly magazine program aired over a cable television system in Boulder, Colorado from 1983 to 1985. He also spent two years as sports director at KAIR-AM, the university's radio station. From 1982 to 1984, he covered high school sports for the Rocky Mountain News. Personal life Fowler grew up in Rockford, Illinois and State College, Pennsylvania where his father, Knox, was a theater professor. While he was a teenager, the family relocated to Colorado Springs, where he graduated from General William J. Palmer High School in 1980.

Emmet Walsh as Sheriff Bob, James Crittenden as Lester, Art Evans as Earl Yates, Joanna Jackson as Lutie Yates, Ed Morgan as Judge Henry McGrath and David Powledge as Andrew Taylor.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106418/fullcredits#cast The film was originally released on VHS in America where it now remains out-of-print, unavailable in the country on DVD. An all-region Australian import DVD was later released, as well as a Spanish import DVD, and a Dutch import DVD. The film's tagline reads \\"A triangle of innocence, sin ... and murder.\\" Plot Travis Graham is a lonely and rather feeble minded uneducated young man whose abusive father recently died, but who left all of his money to a TV preacher but left Travis his valuable coin collection and his large farm in Texas. One day, a young woman, named Kelly Ann Welsh, walks into his life. At the same time, another attractive blonde claiming to be from England, named Jolene, starts taking an interest in Travis after supposedly wanting to buy the farm. Both women are secretly after something, but impressionable Travis, in need of emotional aid and comfort after the death of his father, finds himself the object of the girls' attentions. Even when he realizes he is being played for a fool he does not have the inclination to escape the ladies' clutches and things begin to take a sinister turn when both Kelly Ann and Jolene persuade Travis to partake in bank robberies with them around town and Travis is too gullible to refuse. When their actions attract the suspicions of the local deputy, both women will resort to murder to keep their game in play. The climatic twist of the film comes when both Kelly Ann and Jolene are revealed to be sisters (Jolene is also not from England, but from Alabama) who have been plotting this whole scam to steal Travis father's money along with keeping their stolen bank cash for themselves. Travis realizes this only after learning that they murdered Deputy Bobby, and in the struggle he shoots and wounds Jolene, but is wounded in return by Kelly Ann who does away him. Both women dispose of Travis' body in a furnace and having completed their goal, leave the farm in Travis' convertible automobile for places unknown to find, scam and murder their next unsuspecting victim.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106418/plotsummary Cast * Stephen Baldwin as Travis * Patsy Kensit as Jolene * Jennifer Rubin as Kelly Ann * Adam Baldwin as Bobby * M.

Patsy Kensit and Jennifer Rubin costar as a pair of oversexed young ladies who get their jollies by victimizing their male lovers.

If not for the nudity of the gals (which, granted, is very nice and very prevalent), there'd honestly be nothing else to watch here but Baldwin's mullet. The direction, by TV hack Duane Clark, manages to introduce tons of sub-plots (such as flashbacks to a mysterious robed figure) then completely ignore them for the remainder of the film. The continual staring of Baldwin's character at a badly painted portrait of a stern old dude would be far less funny if they weren't accompanied by 'mysterious music' that leaves you wondering when the painting's eyes are going to move. They never do, though yours will. They'll roll back into your head if you sit through this dreck.\\" Scoopy gave an unfavorable review and wrote \\"Bitter Harvest is a bad erotic thriller. There was a time I lost all interest in where the plot was going, and the nudity was over by then as well.\\" For the DVD & Video Guide 2005, authors Mick Martin and Marsha Porter gave a rating of two stars out of five and wrote \\"Baldwin is good, but excessive subplots lessen the film's impact.\\" The book VideoHound's Golden Movie Retriever gave a rating of two out of five stars.

Throughout his church career, Metropolitan Iriney served the Soviet Union as a KGB recruiter and longtime handler of George Trofimoff, the highest ranking traitor in the history of the U.S. Army. Life Igor Vladimirovich Susemihl was born in 1919, the son of an agronomist. When he was six years old, his family moved to Berlin, Weimar Germany as White emigres. Soon after, Igor's widowed mother, Antonina, married Vladimir Sharavov, a former officer in the White Army. Beginning in 1928, the Sharavov family took in George Trofimoff, the son of a White emigre who was unable to provide for his son. Trofimoff remained with the Sharavovs until 1943, when he returned to his father. 6 December 1942, Igor was ordained a deacon by Metropolitan Seraphim (Lade) (Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia). Following the Second World War, he moved to Australia with his wife and children. Deacon Igor later received an Ecclesiastical divorce and was ordained as a hieromonk by the Moscow Patriarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church. After taking the monastic name Father Iriney, he served from 1966 to 1972 as auxiliary bishop of Munich and West Germany. In 1972, he was consecrated as Metropolitan of Vienna and All Austria. During that era, Metropolitan Iriney renewed his acquaintance with Trofimoff, who had become a Colonel in the United States Army specializing in military intelligence. In 1969, Colonel Trofimoff had been promoted to the head of the U.S. Army element at the Nuremberg Joint Interrogation Center, a clearing house for Soviet and Eastern Bloc defectors. Trofimoff's indictment statesGeorge Trofimoff Affidavit that, after learning that his foster brother was chronically short of funds, Iriney \\"recruited him into the service of the KGB.\\" The indictment states that the KGB possessed several similar collaborators among Moscow Patriarchate clergy, both inside and outside of the USSR. At the time, Iriney was auxiliary bishop of Munich and West Germany, but later became the Metropolitan of Vienna and Austria in 1975. He continued to hold this position until his death in 1999.–ò—Ä–∏–Ω–µ–π (–ó—É–∑–µ–º–∏–ª—å) Biography information on the web-site of the ROC Beginning in the 1960s, Trofimoff and the Metropolitan met often and maintained a close personal relationship. In a 1999 conversation with an undercover FBI agent, Trofimoff described his recruitment as follows, > ...it must have been the '70s. But it was very informal... There were no > photographs, there was just talking... He would ask me something and I would > tell him something.. verbal information.. He had a few questions about > current events... First, it was just a conversation between the two of us... > He would ask my opinion on this and that... Then, he would maybe ask me, > 'Well, what does your unit think about it?' Or, 'What does the American > government think about it?'Andy Byers (2005), pages 111-112. Upon being asked whether Bishop Iriney's actions made him suspicious, Trofimoff responded, > No, not in the beginning... I said I needed money. And I told him my wife > bought some furniture and I can't pay for it, I don't know how to get the > money. And he says, 'I tell you what, I'll loan it to you.' So he gave me, I > think, 5,000 marks and then, it wasn't enough, because I needed more, and > about three or four weeks later I said to him, 'You gotta help me one more > time, and I'll give it back to you when I have a chance.' ...And that was > the end of it. Then he talked to me a couple times. Always like this. Then > he says, 'Well, you know, I'll tell you what. You don't owe me any money... > And if you need some more, I can give you some more... Don't worry about it. > You're going to have to have a few things, this and that.' And this is how > it started.Andy Byers (2005), page 112. In 1999, Col. Trofimoff boasted that he routinely smuggled every classified document he could obtain home to be photographed with a special camera and tripod. The film was passed on to KGB agents during meetings in Austria. According to former KGB General Oleg Kalugin, however, Colonel Trofimoff, who was given the code name \\"Markiz\\", always received his money from Metropolitan Iriney. Trofimoff further explained that Metropolitan Iriney paid him a standard amount of 7,000 Deutschmarks (DM) per week. The payments were always made in used bills and when Trofimoff needed more money toward a down payment on his house, the Metropolitan \\"went to his contact in Moscow\\" and returned with 90,000 DM. This sum was then worth 40,000 American dollars.Byers (2005), page 114. In 2001, General Kalugin testified under oath to having invited Metropolitan Iriney to visit his dacha in 1978. According to Kalugin, \\"He did good work, particularly in recruiting Markiz. I wanted to thank him for what he had done.\\"Byers (2005), page 172. Trofimoff further explained that, in 1987, Metropolitan Iriney ordered him to cease his espionage work for the KGB. According to Trofimoff, \\"...he told me to destroy the camera, so I smashed it with a hammer and I threw it in the garbage, far away.\\"Andy Byers (2005), pages 113-114. In 1992, a retired KGB archivist named Vasili Mitrokhin defected to the United Kingdom, taking with him thousands of pages of classified papers and handwritten notes on KGB operations at home and abroad. Major Mitrokhin's information included evidence that a NATO interrogation center was being compromised by a mole, codenamed, \\"Markiz\\". He handed over KGB records that showed classified documents that exceeded 80 volumes ‚Äì 50,000 pages taken over 25 years. Mitrokhin didn't have a name, but he was able to produce a vague sketch of the traitor. Furthermore, the Soviet files he delivered described the spy as a \\"career American intelligence officer\\" and the courier who carried the secrets as a Russian Orthodox \\"clergyman\\". On December 14, 1994, Colonel Trofimoff and Metropolitan Iriney were arrested and interrogated by the German Federal Police, or Bundeskriminalamt, based on the mentioned sketch. Shortly thereafter, both were brought before Dr. Bode, a judge of the Federal Constitutional Court, for a preliminary hearing. During the hearing, Metropolitan Iriney admitted to having loaned Trofimoff money, but denied having links to the KGB. He did admit, however, that, \\"The KGB was everywhere, also in the Church.\\"Byers (2005), page 80. The Metropolitan also admitted to having, \\"a very strong, personal relationship,\\" with his female housekeeper, Gudula Walker.Byers (2005), page 82. As Germany's espionage laws possess a five-year statute of limitations, Dr. Bode refused to file charges. As a result, both Colonel Trofimoff and Metropolitan Iriney were released. Metropolitan Iriney then returned to his duties as Hierarch of Austria. After his death in 1999, Patriarch Alexei II sent a telegram praising him. Legacy In 2000, Colonel George Trofimoff was arrested in Tampa, Florida and charged with espionage. In taped conversations with an undercover FBI agent, Trofimoff had admitted that his \\"brother,\\" Metropolitan Iriney, had recruited to spy for the U.S.S.R. In 2001, Colonel Trofimoff was convicted of treason and espionage and sentenced to life imprisonment. He remains the highest ranking U.S. military officer ever tried or convicted on those charges.

According to a United States Senate staff report, this practice presents \\"highly aggressive sales tactics [which] charge millions of American consumers for services the consumers do not want and do not understand they have purchased.\\" It reports that consumers involuntarily spent $1.4 billion USD due to these practices, US$792 million of that paid to the third-party sites which presented services paid for by post- transaction marketing. The report concluded that such marketing practices \\"exploit consumers' expectations about the online 'checkout' process.\\" It stated that their \\"Misleading 'Yes' and 'Continue' buttons cause consumers to reasonably think they are completing the original transaction, rather than entering into a new, ongoing financial relationship with a membership club.\\" Mechanics of the practice The Senate report identified \\"data pass\\", or the automatic transfer from the merchant after the transaction of the customer's credit card information. Information provided by the Federal Trade Commission and the National Association of Attorneys General, and information collected from telephone billing has found that requiring the entry of credit card information will decrease the likelihood that a customer will enter a transaction by a factor of 3 or 4. Therefore, companies will use the automatic transference of this information which will induce consumers to involuntarily provide their credit card information to merchants which they were otherwise unwilling to transact with. It also reported that post-transaction marketers will pay a US$10 to US$30 \\"bounty\\" for a customer's enrollment in a membership club. The report also identified low consumer awareness of their involuntary memberships to these clubs, and cites numerous consumer complaints. It also presents companies' training scripts for customer service staff response to such complaints, especially those from individuals unaware of their enrollment. It also identifies high cancellation rates as evidence that these subscriptions were unwanted. In addition, it identified unscrupulous efforts to protect merchants against legitimate consumer complaints by labeling it as a \\"strict no-no\\" to refer customers to the providers of the services which they were involuntarily enrolled in, and quotes a variety of complaints from merchants who were concerned about these deceptive practices.Deception in Post-Transaction Marketing Participating companies Senator Rockefeller held a hearing regarding aggressive sales tactics used by companies. Hundreds of popular companies, most notably Intelius, will, in an effort to increase the profit of the transaction, provide something to the consumer immediately after the purchase on the site. Consumers are typically provided with cash back for simply pressing a confirmation button. However, when they do, their credit card information is automatically submitted to a third-party marketing company, which signs the customer up for a package of useless services. These practices have been utilized by major companies, including 1-800-Flowers.com, Buy.com, Classmates.com, ColumbiaHouse, Confi-Check, Expedia, FTD, Fandango, Hotels.com, Hotwire, InQ, Intelius, MovieTickets.com, Orbitz, Priceline, RedcatsUSA, Shutterfly, Travelocity, US Airways, and VistaPrint, profiting at over US$10 million each.The Post Transaction Marketing Wall Of Shame: Hundreds Of Well Known Ecommerce Sites Rip Off Customers  TechCrunch Classmates.com profited greater than US$70 million. The three largest companies engaging in these practices are Affinion, Vertrue and Webloyalty.* \\"Senate Cracks Down on Sneaky Membership Club Dues.\\" (Video). The Today Show. The report notes that these three companies have profited greater than US$1.4 billion. There are currently 4 million people enrolled in these plans. 450 or more e-commerce sites have joined the fraud, said the report, 88 of which have received at least US$1 million. The websites can earn up to US$2,600 per thousand visitors, with a conversion rate up to 4.5%. It was noted that these scams have significant similarities to the Scamville social gaming fraud. The companies which do not engage in these tactics, such as Scamville, are at a disadvantage. They earn less income, which means that advertising costs could overpower profits. Therefore, companies are forced into the practice, or out of business. A Supplemental Staff Report released in May 2010 starts the exploration of efforts by post-transaction marketers to avoid refunds. One of these efforts is using scripts, which are in place in order to minimize the amount returned to consumers and refused to refund, unless the consumer specifically demands a refund. Another practice is to deliberately avoid informing consumers that they have multiple memberships, even when they call to report one such membership.

It was flown by him in various competitions during 1911, including the Daily Mail Circuit of Britain competition in which Cody was the only British contestant to complete the course. On 29 October Cody set a new British endurance record in the aircraft, flying for five hours and fifteen minutes. Design Developed from his Michelin Cup winning machine of 1910 and using the same Green engine the Cody Circuit of Britain biplane was a pusher biplane with a single frontal elevator supported by booms at the centre and either end and two rear-mounted rudders, each supported by a boom at top and bottom and fitted with a small horizontal fixed stabiliser. The tail was the most obvious difference between this aircraft and its predecessor. Like the Michelin Cup aircraft, it had a tricycle undercarriage with an added long rear skid and distinctive wheels mounted on each lower wingtip.Lewis 1962., p.194 Operational history The Circuit of Britain biplane made its maiden flight on 13 July 1911.Jarrett 1999, p. 13. *The aircraft, flown by Cody, was entered for the Daily Mail Circuit of Britain race: Cody came fourth, his aircraft being the only British aircraft to complete the 1,010 mile course. *Cody won second place in the Manville Prize contest with a flight of 2 hours 16 minutes. *On 11 September Cody won the British Empire Michelin Cup No.2 flying the Circuit of Britain biplane, with a cross-country flight lasting 3 h 6 min 30 s, being the only competitor to finish the course. *On 29 October Cody won the British Empire Michelin Cup No.1, covering over a closed circuit at Laffan's Plain in 5 h 15 min, a new British duration record. On 3 July 1912 the aircraft was severely damaged on landing when Major H.D. Harvey-Kelly clipped a tree with one wingtip and crashed. Cody, who was instructing Harvey-Kelly, was severely injured in the crash.

History S√∂dra Latin has a rich history, as its predecessor S√∂dermalms Pedagogia employed its first headmaster as far back as in 1654. In 1820 it became a trivialskola and in 1879 it was merged with the southern part of Stockholms gymnasium, its new name being Stockholms h√∂gre allm√§nna √• latinlinjen fullst√§ndiga l√§roverk √• S√∂dermalm. The school changed its name multiple times through the years until it decided upon its current one in 1971. The current school building was designed by Per Emanuel Werming and opened in 1891 (its twin building Norra Real having opened a full year earlier). The structure was conceived in a way that would allow daylight to directly illuminate all rooms and corridors inside it, with 21 classrooms having been built in total. Typical of the design - in addition to the monumental orange-red brick facade - is a semicircular assembly hall placed centrally in the school's building plan. The last renovation took place in 1996. Despite its current uneven female-to-male ratio, S√∂dra Latin was a boys- only institution until 1961. Education In modern times, S√∂dra Latin is known for its high-level schooling in the arts. Between 1976 and 1978 the establishment successively replaced the music department of Statens normalskola in √ñstermalm, becoming consummate in 1980. In 1985 it launched one of the country's first drama programmes. Besides aesthetically and artistically oriented programmes, the school also offers education in the humanities and natural sciences, among others. Notable alumni Several prominent Swedish people have received their schooling at S√∂dra Latin, many of them artists or other cultural personalities. *Sven Stolpe *Stig Dagerman *Isaac Gr√ºnewald *Tomas Transtr√∂mer, Nobel Prize winner *Klas √ñstergren *Alexander Skarsg√•rd *Gustaf Skarsg√•rd *Bill Skarsg√•rd *Max Martin *Helena af Sandeberg *Helena Mattson *Anna-Lena Strindlund,http://sv.stagepool.com/nyfiken_pa/956/intervju_med_anna_lena_strindlund *Hjalmar Mehr *Per Ahlmark *Mona Sahlin *Olle Hellbom *Jonas Hassen Khemiri *√Ösa Romson *Peter Pohlhttp://www.nada.kth.se/~pohl/biografi.html *Lykke Li *Noomi Rapace *Mattias Jacobsson *John Landquist *Yung Lean *Dirty Loops *Danny Saucedo *Saga Molldal *Alva Mogert Palm *Moa Mogert Palm *Alba August *Joel Kinnaman Notable teachers *Alf Ahlberg *Immanuel Bj√∂rkhagen *B√∂rge Ring *Svetlana Eriksson See also *Education in Sweden *Norra Real *√ñstra Real *Norra Latin *Kungsholmens gymnasium *Viktor Rydberg Gymnasium ReferencesExternal links Wikimedia Commons *Stockholm's inner- city upper secondary schools at the turn of the 20th century Schools in Stockholm Education in Stockholm Gymnasiums (school) in Sweden Buildings and structures in Stockholm Music in Stockholm Music schools in Sweden ","title":"S√∂dra Latin"},{"id":"36040720","text":"Franklin Township is one of twenty-one current townships in Carroll County, Arkansas, USA.\\"Franklin Township, Carroll County, Arkansas.\\" U.S. Census Bureau.

The show follows the life of character George Findlay, a role that Ken Finkleman reprised from The Newsroom and subsequent television projects. The series was originally slated to be the second season of Finkleman's previous HBO Canada project Good Dog, but was retitled in accordance with a change in the show's setting. The show was described in early media coverage as having been inspired in part by the launch of Sun News Network.\\"Ken Finkleman‚Äôs latest TV series spoofs Sun News Network\\". National Post, March 20, 2012. In the show's first episode, for example, Findlay is forced to respond to allegations that his new venture is aspiring to be \\"Fox News North\\", an epithet which the real Sun News Network also faced both before and after its launch.\\"Sun News network courts scandal again\\". Toronto Star, February 2, 2012. The series was nominated for several awards at the 1st Canadian Screen Awards, including Best Comedy Series, Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series for Jason Weinberg and Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series nods for both Samantha Bee and Jud Tylor. Overview George Findlay (Finkleman) is a character who has been present in virtually all of Finkleman's past television projects, including The Newsroom, Good Dog, More Tears, Foolish Heart and Foreign Objects.\\"The Six Faces of George\\". The Globe and Mail, March 4, 2011. A television producer, in Good God he has returned to television news as the new head of Right News, a conservative cable news channel. Despite identifying his own politics more with the left-wing side of the political spectrum, Findlay has been depicted in all of Finkleman's productions as self-centred, cynical and unsympathetic, motivated far more by personal gain than deeply held principle, and given to political views that are often poorly thought out and sometimes hypocritical in nature. The show's other principal stars are Lolita Davidovich as Virginia Hailwood, the socialite daughter of the wealthy businessman who owns Right News and a former love interest of Findlay's, and Samantha Bee as Shandy Sommers, the network's devoutly Christian morning show host. The cast also includes John Ralston, Jason Weinberg, Steven McCarthy, April Mullen, Jud Tylor, Brendan Gall, Stephanie Anne Mills, Tamara Hope, Janet van de Graaf and John White.\\"Ken Finkleman (and alter ego George Findlay) are back with 'Good God'.

Amateur career Almora attended Mater Academy Charter School in Hialeah Gardens, Florida. In 2011, Almora was named USA Baseball's athlete of the year after leading the 18 and under team to a 9‚Äì0 record and being named the tournament MVP. He played on six national teams while in high school, tying a record. He won the USA Baseball Richard W. \\"Dick\\" Case Player of the Year Award in 2011. He committed to play college baseball at the University of Miami. Professional career=Draft The Chicago Cubs selected Almora in the first round, with the sixth overall selection, in the 2012 MLB draft out of Mater Academy Charter School. He signed with the Cubs, receiving a $3.9 million signing bonus. MLB.com ranked Almora as the second best prospect in the Cubs organization in 2013, and the 39th ranked prospect in all of baseball. Minor leagues Almora spent 2012 with both the AZL Cubs and Boise Hawks, batting .321 with two home runs and 19 RBIs in 33 games. He played for the Kane County Cougars in 2013. He had a .329 batting average in 61 games played, as he missed time due to injury. After the 2013 season, the Cubs assigned Almora to the Arizona Fall League to gain more experience. In 2014, he played for the Daytona Cubs and Tennessee Smokies where he slashed .270/.291/.392 with nine home runs and 60 RBIs in 125 games. Almora spent 2015 back with the Smokies where he batted .272 with six home runs and 46 RBIs in 106 games. He began 2016 with the Iowa Cubs. At Iowa prior to being called up, he was batting .318 in 54 games. MLB careerChicago Cubs2016= Almora was promoted to the Cubs on June 7, 2016 when Jorge Soler was placed on the disabled list. He made his first MLB career start in left field on June 8, 2016 against the Philadelphia Phillies and on his first fielding opportunity threw out a runner at home to complete a double play. The following day, he got his first major league hit. On November 2, 2016, in Game 7 of the 2016 World Series, Almora took over as a pinch runner for Kyle Schwarber, the Cubs designated hitter who opened the top of the 10th inning with a lead-off single to right. Almora advanced to second base on a rare tag- up play from first base thanks to a deep fly ball out hit by Kris Bryant. After Cleveland Indians pitcher Bryan Shaw intentionally walked Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo, Almora scored the go-ahead 7th run for the Cubs off of a double by Ben Zobrist. The Cubs went on to win the game 8-7, earning their first World Series victory since 1908 thanks in part to Almora's baserunning skill. =2017= In 132 games, Almora finished the season with a .298 batting average, eight home runs, and 46 RBIs. He also changed the name on the back of his jersey from 'Almora Jr.' to just 'Almora.‚Äô =2018= On April 22, in an away game against the Colorado Rockies, Almora made three leaping catches in center field; in the first, second and ninth innings of the Cubs' 9‚Äì7 win. Almora finished his 2018 campaign batting .286 with five home runs and 41 RBIs in 152 games. He was the final out of the 2018 NL Wild Card Game against Colorado, struck out by Scott Oberg to end the 13 inning, 2‚Äì1 Rockies victory. =2019= Almora opened the 2019 season on Chicago's 25-man roster. =2020= Almora opened the 2020 season on Chicago's 26-man Opening Day roster, but was optioned to the alternate training site, located in South Bend, Indiana. Before being sent down, Almora was platooning with the current starting center fielder, Ian Happ. Almora was hitting .167 with 5 hits in 30 AB. He was optioned when the Cubs received Cameron Maybin from the Detroit Tigers. Personal life Almora's father, Albert Sr., played baseball in Cuba before he defected to the United States. Almora began training with his father when he was three years old. Albert is so close to current MLB player Manny Machado that Almora considers him to be his cousin, though they are not related by blood. Machado was quoted as saying that he would love to play with Almora and win a World Series together, a dream they had as kids. Almora married former Philadelphia 76ers and Philadelphia Flyers dancer Krystal Gregorio on July 21, 2016. Their first child, a son named A.J., was born in August 2016. Almora chose \\"Tico\\" as his nickname for the Players Weekend during the 2017 and 2018 season. He says that the nickname was given to him as a child for his rowdy nature.

Founded in 1902 and named after Portuguese poet Lu√≠s de Cam√µes, it is one of the largest and most prestigious secondary schools in Lisbon, known for the many important Portuguese public figures who have attended it, including novelist Ant√≥nio Lobo Antunes, current UN Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres and former President of the European Commission Jos√© Manuel Barroso. History School coat-of-arms At the beginning of the 20th century, and following the reform of the lyceum educational system by the Ministry and Secretary-of-State for Business, in 1905, Eduardo Jos√© Coelho the public school equipment initiated a period of development. This involved the rationalization of teaching which extended to the reorganization of spaces, as exemplified by architects Miguel Ventura Terra and Jos√© Marques da Silva, who worked on many of the lyceums in Lisbon and Porto. In Lisbon, Ventura Terra was responsible for work done on the Pedro Nunes (1906), Cam√µes (1907) and Maria Am√°lia (1913) lyceums, which became a reference to school architecture in the era and modernized the building culture of the city. In 1907, Miguel Ventura Terra (1866-1919) was commissioned by the Ministry of the Kingdom and Dire√ß√£o-geral da Instru√ß√£o Secund√°ria Superior Especial to install a lyceum on State lands. Construction on the site began in January 1908, under the supervision of Ant√≥nio Ribeiro. The final project was inaugurated on 16 October 1909. The lyceum of Cam√µes was constructed to substitute the old National Lyceum of Lisbon, created in 1902, and inadequate for the teaching needs and number of students. At the time of its inauguration there was a general consensus that the building had beautiful conditions and a model for hygiene and pedagogic teaching, as reported by the newspapers. Critics noted that the school was isolated on the square (the Largo do Matadouro Municipal), which was a natural zone on the edge of urban expansion and little accessible. The lyceum, owing to its purpose-built nature (from scratch and specific to teaching) was an architectural educational reference, both formally and esthetically, respecting the functional necessities of the site. The great number of students that this urban lyceums received, and that hygiene theories at the time, meant that there was an obligation to include physical education classes, resulting in a modular system of pavilions used for complimentary classes, with patios and exterior recreational spaces. The principal wings, used for traditional teaching rooms were linked to new sporting pavilions, gymnasium, change rooms and projected swimming pool (which were unique for the country at the time). The lyceum was a public utility, functional and rationalist. It was projected to integrate into the urban fabric, albeit isolated initially. Ventura Terra delineated a construction model that was more simple then the habitual designs, responding to the a request by the first rector of the Central Lyceum, Rui Teles Palhinha: :construction of a building that purpose built...that obeyed the principals of the utmost economy, with the eye to a precise school of airyness and light...and dispensing with pumice and rich woods. Ventura Terra therefore included rectangular articulated blocks, using new materials for the time (iron and tile) and a composition that did not include closed corridors in favour of halls open to the patio and exterior galleries, and multiple recreational spaces. Two decades later, in 1927, two pavilions were constructed for physical education and chemistry classes, in response to new reforms in the education system, along with the necessity to alienate the laboratories from the principal installations, to avoid accidents. In the 1930s, the building was remodelled, in order to expand students, as well as install a new canteen and annexes. The DGEMN began work on the site in 1954, with periodic repairs and conservation projects, by the Direc√ß√£o dos Servi√ßos de Constru√ß√£o e Conserva√ß√£o (1954), then the Servi√ßos de Constru√ß√£o e Conserva√ß√£o (1957 and 1961). In 1959, two pavilions/halls were constructed by the Servi√ßos de Constru√ß√£o e Conserva√ß√£o, in conjunction with the Junta de Constru√ß√µes para o Ensino T√©cnico e Secund√°rio. In 1970, a bust of Cam√µes commissioned and executed by Fernando Fernandes, which was presented in 1972. On 3 August 2006, the Vice-President of IPPAR initiated a process to classify the building, that terminated on 6 December 2011 with its classification as a Monumento de Interesse P√∫blico by the DRCLVTejo. Architecture The oblique view of the secondary school The site is situated in an urban landscape, occupying half of the block delimited by the Pra√ßa Jos√© Fontana, Rua Almirante Barroso, Rua da Escola de Medicina Veterin√°ria and Rua Dona Estef√¢nia. The Pra√ßa Jos√© Fontana (a triangular \\"square\\") and organized around the Jardim de Henrique Lopes de Mendon√ßa fronts the main facade of the school, separated urban arterial and grated fence with access by pavement stone. To the south, in the neighbouring block, is the Escola Superior de Medicina Veterin√°ria (Supeior School of Veterinary Medicine) and to the north, the small walls of the old lyceum, oriented to the Rua Almirante Barroso and the primitive Escola Industrial Ant√≥nio Arroio (Industrial School Ant√≥nio Arroio). The symmetrical rectangular plan, in the form of a tridentFran√ßa (2010), p.149 is composed of a principal facade, and two lateral wings, as well as central body parallel to this, that creates two vast, rectangular open spaces used as recreational areas. The halls are distributed, essentially, in the lateral wings and the central block used for gymnasium and refectory, while the front facade provides the administrative spaces for the institution. In the administrative wing is the bust of Cam√µes.

Set in a fantasy medieval era, Wreckateer casts players as part of a demolition team tasked with destroying various structures. Players use the Kinect motion sensor to launch projectiles from a ballista and then guide them in-flight to their targets. Gameplay In Wreckateer, the player is the newest employee of the Wreck & Tinker Destruction Company, which has been hired to demolish castles and other structures that have been infested by goblins. The player is armed with a ballista that launches various enchanted projectiles, and the object of the game is to destroy as much of the structure as possible using the provided projectiles. After the projectile is loaded, the player readies and aims the ballista by pulling away from the Kinect sensor, then launches the shot by spreading their arms. Many shots can be nudged in-flight by swiping at them in the desired direction, while some have special abilities that can be activated when the player spreads their arms widely above their head. For example, a Bomb Shot will explode on command, a Split Shot will break into four smaller, linked projectiles, and a Flying Shot will sprout wings, allowing the player to fly the projectile into a target. The level starts with a pre-set number of shots, and the level ends after the last shot has been fired. Points are scored for damage to structures, elimination of goblins and for collection of floating bonus icons. Players receive medals for reaching certain scores, and receipt of at least a bronze medal unlocks the next level. Development The game was announced in 2012 with an announcement trailer. The game was more formally unveiled during Microsoft's press conference at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2012. A spokesperson demonstrated the gameplay stage, complete with motion gestures. The game was released as a part of the Xbox 360 Summer of Arcade series. Reception Wreckateer received \\"average\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Chris Watters of GameSpot lauded the game's \\"enjoyable score-chasing and good Kinect controls\\", while Mitch Dyer of IGN said the game \\"falls just short of 'irresistible addiction' and instead settles for 'amusing distraction'.\\" The Digital Fix gave it a score of six out of ten and said, \\"With no real story to speak of, and little variety in the levels besides the occasional addition of snow or a waterfall, this isn't the kind of game you'll play for hours. In fact, Wreckateer is highly reminiscent of a smartphone game, the kind of thing that is a lot of fun, but only in short bursts.\\" The Guardian similarly gave it three stars out of five and said that \\"as good as it is, The Wreckateer [sic] won't win over anyone who isn't already convinced by Kinect. It looks like players may have to wait for the next generation of consoles before that's even possible. Metro also gave it six out of ten and said it was \\"the closest thing so far to a 3D Angry Birds game, but although the Kinect controls are fine it's the gameplay and visuals that need adjusting.\\" References 2012 video games Kinect games Microsoft games Unreal Engine games Video games developed in the United States Xbox 360 Live Arcade games Xbox 360 games Xbox 360-only games Iron Galaxy games Puzzle video games ","title":"Wreckateer"},{"id":"36041050","text":"Bj√∏rnfjell Chapel () is a chapel of the Church of Norway in Narvik Municipality in Nordland county, Norway.

At one stage he became step-father to the piper John Moore (1834‚Äì87), as he married the boy's mother when her first husband died. He also taught the piper Peter Kelly. He kept a dance hall in the Suckeen for some years before it was forcibly closed by a local priest. Francis O'Neill who published a short biography of him in 1913 wrote that \\"Sightless and old and unable to make a living by other means than music, he was obliged, like many another unfortunate Irish minstrel, to take refuge in the poorhouse as his only escape from starvation.\\" The intervention of the Gaelic League caused him to participate in the Feis Ceol of 1901 in Dublin, where he won first prize in the piper's competition. His performance - under the heading Large Concert Hall of the Rotunda - was described in a Dublin newspaper as follows: > \\"A notable incident was the playing of Mr. Martin O‚ÄôReilly, who played a > selection entitled ‚ÄúThe Battle of Aughrim,‚Äù descriptive of the advance, the > trumpets of the British, the battle onslaught of the Irish soldiers, and the > wail of the women. Aughrim was of course a lost field, but, nothing daunted, > the gallant old piper, throbbing with a spirit that might long to play his > countrymen into battle, fired them with a stirring and strident version of > the victorious march of Brian Boru.\\" Following this he performed at a number of concerts in various towns around Ireland, such as the Belfast Harp Festival of 1903. A photograph was taken of him by a Father Fielding in Dublin, which in 1907 became the frontispiece for O'Neill's Dance Music of Ireland. O'Reilly however ended up back in the poorhouse, in Gort, where he died in 1904.
