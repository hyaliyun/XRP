The Society chartered the Australasian Steam Navigation Company's steam launch Bonito, of 77 tons gross register as its river boat. It left Sydney in tow of Egmont on 10 June, and left Moreton Bay on 17 June 1885 in tow of the company's steamer Wentworth for Townsville and thence to Thursday Island by the A.S.N. ferry Alexandra. The Queensland Government steamer Advance (Captain Williams), took her to the mouth of the Fly River, where she was met by the Hon. John Douglas and Rev. McFarlane aboard the missionary steamer Mary. From there she would make her way to Mibu Island, in the Fly delta, and take on coal and fresh provisions from the schooner Mavis before proceeding up-river. :Their original target, the Aird River, some 100 km further around the Gulf of Papua, was abandoned when it was learned how difficult crossing the river mouth could be. They proceeded up the Fly river to about past Ellangowan Island to a major tributary on the north-east side, which on 28 July they named Strickland River in honour of Sir Edward Strickland president of the Society. They proceeded up the Strickland to a point where the Bonito got stranded on a shoal or gravel bed, and a smaller party, consisting of Everill, Haacke, Shaw, Creagh, Froggatt and Waddick and some of the Javanese, proceeded another in the whaleboat. On returning to base they found tropical rains had lifted the Bonito off the shoal into deep water, so they steamed down the river and reached Thursday Island, and were back in Sydney on 3 December 1885. Stories had somehow reached Thursday Island through Rev. McFarlane, that the whole expedition had been surprised and massacred during the night and the Bonito had been looted and burnt. Accounts of supposed disaster were published in Sydney and Melbourne papers of 9 November and were not contradicted until the party had returned to Thursday Island. By this time a punitive expedition had been despatched from Thursday Island and a gun-boat was on its way up from Sydney.

Jay McVicker (born Jesse Jay McVicker; October 18, 1911 – August 31, 2004) was an American artist. He is known for his printmaking, particularly his early aquatints and his experimental use of intaglio techniques. McVicker was also active as a painter and sculptor throughout his career. A student of Ella Jack and Doel Reed at Oklahoma State University, McVicker showed early promise as a Regionalist watercolorist and printmaker. After graduating with a BA in 1940 and an MA in 1941, both from Oklahoma State University, he joined the faculty and remained in Stillwater, Oklahoma for the rest of his life. After World War II, McVicker turned to abstraction, and exhibited widely throughout the United States and abroad. Early life and education McVicker was one of five children born to Jesse Allen and Clara Mae (Hendrick) McVicker, and from childhood was known as J. Jay. In 1915, the family moved to Berlin, Oklahoma, a small rural community northwest of Oklahoma City, near Vici, Oklahoma. He attended school in the nearby town of Weatherford, Oklahoma, and became a championship wrestler. He enrolled at the Southwestern Institute of Technology (now Southwestern Oklahoma State University), also in Weatherford, from 1930 to 1932. In 1938, he married Laura Beth Paul (1909–1993), while he was a student at Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical College (now Oklahoma State University). He received both a BA (1940) and an MA (1941) from Oklahoma A&M.; Because the University didn't offer a Master of Fine Arts degree at the time, McVicker wrote an art history thesis that surveyed the use of color in European painting from the Renaissance through the early twentieth century. After graduation, McVicker joined the faculty at Oklahoma A&M.; He became head of the Art Department in 1959, and retired on May 31, 1977. Career By the time the United States joined the Second World War, McVicker was well-known for his Regionalist prints and watercolors, but within a few years of the war's end, he was dedicated to abstraction and even non-objectivity in all media. Apart from a couple of years in California and in the U.S. Navy, McVicker spent his entire life in Oklahoma. His work, however, was exhibited widely, including at the Museum of Non-Objective Painting and the Downtown Gallery in New York City, and the Salon des Réalités Nouvelles in Paris, France. He was represented by the Bethesda Gallery until it closed, and today is represented by M. Lee Stone Fine Art and Peyton Wright. A book about McVicker by Oklahoma State University professor Louise Siddons was published by the University of Oklahoma Press in 2018.

It was described as a “semi-philanthropic” organisation, or combination of Non-governmental organization, and a development agency, as it provided development funds without requiring any direct repayment, but did expect the Lancashire cotton industry to benefit indirectly in the longer term from the availability more secure cotton supplies.Robbins, (2009), pp. 1-2 The Association's operations initially involved distributing those varieties of cotton seed which would produce the types of cotton its members required and providing expertise, both at no cost, in British protectorates and colonies where climatic and soil conditions were favourable for growing cotton and later began to supply machinery and act as a selling agent for growers. From 1921, the British Government became increasingly dissatisfied with its anomalous position as a non-state organisation undertaking activities which were regarded as proper to the colonial administration and, in 1927, a governmental agency, the Empire Cotton Growing Corporation, took over most the BCGA's work although the Association continued to operate as a trade representational body.Robbins, (2009), p. 19 History In the last quarter of the 19th century, the Lancashire cotton industry obtained around three- quarters of its supplies of raw cotton from the United States, one sixth from India and the rest mainly from Egypt and Brazil. This was because Lancashire spinning machinery was generally adapted for medium-staple cotton such as American Upland cotton, rather than Indian short-staple cotton, used mainly for cheaper fabrics, or high-grade but expensive Egyptian long-staple types.Robbins, (2015), p. 870 By the end of that century, Lancashire was facing increasing competition from manufacturers in the US and India, both using their home-grown cotton, and from the emerging cotton industries of France, Germany and Japan. Despite increasing worldwide demand for cotton, production in the United States was increasing only slowly, as almost all the land suitable for cotton was already in use for its cultivation and, in years when the domestic crop was low, it was largely used at home, with little being exported.Court, pp. 116-19Himbury, pp. 266-7 World demand for raw cotton exceeded supply and Lancashire mills, which were highly dependent on United States raw cotton, were concerned about their future as their continued supply was dependent on market conditions and open to speculative manipulation. In 1901, a committee was appointed to investigate the establishment new cotton growing areas in British colonies, dependencies and protectorates.Hutton, pp. 743-4 Formation Following the committee's recommendation, the British Cotton Growing Association (BCGA), aiming to promote growing suitable grades of cotton within the British Empire, was founded in February 1902. The Association was composed of manufacturers, merchants, shippers and representatives of the various industries and trades unions connected with the cotton industry in Lancashire. It was organised as a semi-philanthropic body, using subscriptions from those involved in the cotton industry to distribute seed and provide technical expertise at no cost to the beneficiaries in order to develop cotton-growing, without any direct or immediate benefit to the subscribers.Robbins, (2015), pp. 872-3 The Association was at first given financial support by the British Government, but in 1915 subsidy was withdrawnRobbins, (2009), p. 9 and, in 1917, the Empire Cotton Growing Committee was established to take over some of its responsibilities. This led to the Association restricting its activities in several countries. However, in 1923 the Cotton industry Act, 1923 empowered the Empire Cotton Growing Committee to collect a levy of Sixpence for every 500 pounds on all raw cotton purchased by British spinners to support its own activities and, at its discretion, those of the British Cotton Growing Association.Onyeiwu, p. 89 The Association was inaugurated with a guarantee fund of £50, 000, and this was used to send consignments of seed and growing instructions to countries with potential to grow cotton and to dispatch cotton experts to undertake pioneering work and conduct experiments there. In 1904 the Association was applied for, and was granted, a Royal Charter and its capital was increases to £500,000 to ensure adequate funding for the extension of its expanding operations.Rose, pp. 176-7University of Birmingham Expansion In its early days, the BCGA generally worked through the Colonial Office or officials in the colonies, but it soon realised that, to meet its objectives, it needed to do more than provide seed and expertise, so from 1920 it began to supply machinery and buildings, to finance cotton ginneries and to act as selling agent for the cotton crops at guaranteed prices. It worked principally in Africa, including the Sudan, Nigeria, the Gold Coast and other colonies in West Africa, Uganda and Kenya in East Africa, Nyasaland and the Rhodesias in Central Africa and Union of South Africa. It also operated in India, Iraq, Australia and the West Indies. The Association also encouraged British Government investment in infrastructure projects likely to benefit cotton production, such as roads, railways and irrigation works, including the Sennar Dam in the Sudan and the expansion of Nigerian Railways.Bader, pp. 213-14Onyeiwu, pp. 94-6, 110-12University of Birmingham Although India was already established as a supplier of raw cotton, much of this was of the short-staple variety generally used for the coarse types of cotton cloth produced for the Indian domestic market and, while much existing African cotton production was also short-staple, the Association thought that the higher prices which high-quality long-staple cotton would command, and the absence of significant local cotton manufacturing, would convince African farmers to produce the long-staple variety that Lancashire required: this underestimated the demand of local manufacturers in some colonies. It also wished to have a wide range of sources of supply, rather than replacing dependence on the United States with over-reliance on India.Onyeiwu, pp. 94-6 Operations The Association initially planned to operate through plantations owned either by itself or by European planters and companies. It was advised against this policy by many colonial officials, particularly in areas where cotton was already grown.Hutton, pp. 747-8 However, at least ten private cotton plantation companies were floated, mainly in West Africa, between 1902 and 1914: all failed through poor planning, insufficient capital or lack of agricultural experience.Robbins, (2015) pp. 891-2 The cost of supporting private firms that failed to create viable plantations also convinced the Association to rely on African producers. The Association paid African farmers at least market rates, and sometimes above-market rates, particularly after the First World War, when worldwide cotton prices slumped, to ensure growers did not change to growing crops other than cotton. It also offered significant cash incentives for high-quality cotton and, as a result of these two policies, the Association frequently lost money on its cotton dealing.Onyeiwu, pp. 97-101 In West Africa, the BCGA also faced the problem that growing cocoa, peanuts or tobacco could be more lucrative than cotton, in East Africa and Northern Nigeria that local cotton industries with limited transport costs offered comparable or better prices than Lancashire and that in much of Nyasaland and Uganda poor transport links increased costs to uneconomic levels.Bader, p. 221 It was also prevented from operating in Egypt, which produced excellent long-staple cotton. In order to meet these challenges, the Association sought legislation by the colonial authorities to regulate the production and sale of cotton, aiming to promote exports at the expense of local sales.Onyeiwu, pp. 106-7 Later history and legacy In 1927 the Empire Cotton Growing Committee was replaced by the Empire Cotton Growing Corporation (later renamed the Cotton Research Corporation) as the main governmental agency supporting cotton production. This body took over most of the research work previously carried out the BCGA to improve the quality and yield of cotton grown. By this time, the Association had generally given up its role as buyer, because many colonies had established their own marketing boards. However, the Association continued as a consulting organisation and as a trade representational body.World Bank, pp. 8-9Onyeiwu, pp. 102-3 There is little doubt that the Association was successful in promoting the growth of cotton, and particularly long-staple cotton, in the British African colonies and in the other colonies in which it operated in during the first quarter of the 20th century. In the same period. Lancashire's consumption of American cotton decreased significantly, whereas American cotton exports to Western Europe and elsewhere were relatively stable, suggesting its aim of securing alternative supplies was realised. However, the United States remained Britain's largest supplier, with the BCGA's colonial cotton supplying about 20% of cotton Lancashire used in 1918.Himbury, (1918). p. 266 This colonial supply was useful in ensuring that there were no shortages in years when the American crop was low or prices high, particularly as the range of sources made supplies less dependent on adverse conditions in one country.Bader, p. 226-8 After attempts by brokers and speculators in the United States to restrict cotton exports and raise prices in 1902-03 and 1909–10, no significant further attempts were made to corner this market.Robbins, (2015), pp. 878, 884 However, it is not clear how much of this increase in African cotton exports would have occurred without the Association's activities. One view is that, as the colonial administrations of several African territories lacked the financial resources to promote major agricultural change, priming the pump by the BCGA was necessary to bring about change, at least in the poorer countries.Elliott, pp. 123, 133-4 An alternative view is that the cost of the Association's operations may have been excessive for the benefit achieved, and its obsessive quest for new supplies may have been at the expense of adapting the industry to the new technologies emerging in that period.Onyeiwu, pp. 115-17 Comparison with other colonial states In 1902 when the BCGA was formed, four other European states (France, Germany, Portugal and Belgium) each had domestic textile industries and African colonies, and each attempted to grow cotton in those colonies to reduce dependence of imported cotton. Although France and, for a short time, Portugal had organisations similar to the BCGA, these never exercised as much influence over colonial production as the BGCA did. Germany and Portugal initially concentrated on plantation production rather than peasant cotton growing and, in all four countries, the colonial administrations had more direct control than in British colonies where the BCGA operated and used more coercion. After the BCGA ceased its development operations in 1927, British colonial administrations assumed greater control over their cotton production.Robbins, (2009), pp. 18-19  France The French textile industry was even more dependent than Britain's on United States cotton, with over 90% of its supplies from that source at the end of the 19th century. Although cotton had been produced for centuries in West Africa, it was not grown intensively and yields were low. Attempts were made to improve the quantity and also the quality of cotton produced in the late 19th century, but the first sustained effort began in 1903 when the Association Cotonniere Coloniale (ACC), composed of French cotton manufacturers, began to supply seeds and technical advice: unlike the BCGA, the ACC did not market raw cotton and built only a few ginneries.Roberts, pp. 462, 465-6Delpeuch, p. 5 The colonial administration did not favour of European-owned plantations but instituted a policy of forcing African producers to grow cotton and to sell it in controlled markets. However, the efforts of the ACC largely ceased by 1915, and supplies of African cotton dwindled.Roberts, pp. 468-9 After the First World War, the ACC was solely as a lobbying body for manufactures in France. Cotton production in the six main French cotton-producing colonies: Burkina Faso, (formerly Haute-Volta), Chad, Mali (formerly Soudan Français), the Ivory Coast, Benin (formerly Dahomey) and Cameroon) was developed by cooperation between the French Administration and a French public company, Compagnie française pour le développement des fibres textiles (CFDT).Delpeuch, pp. 3-4 Its two main problems were the unsuitability of much of French West Africa for cotton production without irrigation, and competition from local textile industries. Where cotton could be grown successfully, the local administrators resorted to compelling local producers to grow cotton and sell it to the CFDT at low prices up to 1931. This was counterproductive, and French Africa only supplied about 7% of the cotton that metropolitan France required.Delpeuch, pp. 6-7  Germany The German Kolonial-Wirtschaftliches Komitee (KWK), or Colonial Economic Committee, was set up in 1896. From the outset, it was dominated by textile manufacturers seeking raw materials and, from 1902, it directed plans for economic development in German African colonies, effectively as an agent of the German Government. Its main aim was to increase colonial cotton production, although it also attempted other projects to increase raw material supplies. The main KWK project was in Togo, where cotton was produced on European owned plantations between 1904 and 1909. However, much of this cotton was low-grade and the attempt was later ended. Colonial cotton production never met more than a small fraction of German needs.Smith, pp. 129-30 One of the main problems the KWK had is that it initially conscripted African labour to work on plantations, both in Togo and German East Africa. In Togo, this led to large-scale migration to adjacent British and French colonies to escape forced labour, and in German East Africa it was an important factor leading to the Maji-Maji uprising of 1905, after which plantation production there was abandoned there, followed a few years later by it ceasing in Togo.Knoll and Hiery, pp. 174-5 Portugal Efforts to promote cotton growing in Angola and Mozambique began in the mid-19th century, mainly through plantations, but cotton only became an important product at the start of the 20th century, when Portugal's growing textiles industry became dependent on imported cotton.Pitcher, pp. 46, 52-3 A number of plantation companies experimented with cotton, but it was only when the colonial government in Mozambique followed the British example and turned to peasant production in 1906, followed by Angola in 1907, that significant amounts were produced, particularly in and just after the First World War. In both colonies, Africans were obliged to plant cotton, but had to sell this to European traders for export at a guaranteed but low price.Pitcher, pp. 59-61 Most development, including the provision of free seeds and arranging transport, was promoted by colonial governors, as an organisation modelled on the BCGA only existed for a few years and did not undertake these tasks. Frequent changes of government before 1926 prevented consistent policies being applied, and Angola and Mozambique only produced around 5% of the cotton Portugal's textiles industry required, until the establishment of the Estado Novo, which introduced increasingly brutal coercion from its inception in 1926, and particularly after 1938.Isaacman, pp. 487 492-3 Belgium The Congo Free State which gained international recognition in 1885, granted large concessions to private companies and, until the rights to these concessions were rescinded when the Belgian Government annexed its territory as the Belgian Congo in 1908, Congolese people were debarred from activities other than subsistence agriculture. Few of the concessionaires had initiated cotton growing, but in 1917 a requirement to produce saleable crops was imposed on Africans, including the growing of varieties of cotton suitable for the Belgian textile industry.Likaka, pp. 12, 15-16 Initially, the administration sought to promote peasant cotton growing through incentives but, from 1921, it gave twelve Belgian companies the exclusive right to purchase cotton in a defined area and, in practice, a labour monopoly in those areas. Further grants were made in later years. Cotton growers in these areas were forced to grow cotton and sell it to the designated company at a price determined by negotiation between the administration and the companies.Likaka, pp. 19-20, 22-3 Until this system was reformed in the mid1930s, it only produced moderate amounts of often low- grade cotton and impoverished the coerced growers.Likaka, pp. 135-6 Operations by territory  Sudan Initially, the BCGA was not interested in the Sudan, largely because an agreement with Egypt limited the amount of water the Sudan could abstract from the River Nile for irrigation. An agreement of 1912 between the Egyptian and Sudanese governments allowed the latter greater freedom to use the waters of the Blue Nile for irrigation and, from 1915, the Association began to import Sudanese cotton and sell it to Lancashire mills.Serels, pp. 69-70 However, it was only after the British Government advanced funds for large-scale irrigation in the Gezira region that substantial cotton production was possible. As most of the land in Gezira belonged to its indigenous population, the colonial Sudanese Government devised a scheme under which owners whose land was to be irrigated were required to lease it to the government for 40 years at a fixed rent, receiving also the right to cultivate that land in an approved manner, namely to grow cotton. From 1921, this became the basis of land tenure in the Gezira Scheme, the area of which was greatly increased when the Sennar Dam was completed in 1925. A smaller irrigation scheme also operated in Kassala province.Serels, pp. 71-2 Unlike the rest of Africa where plantations had either not been or abandoned, in the Sudan, the “Syndicate” system operated: a type of plantation where native producers entered into a form of partnership with the Sudan Plantations Syndicate Limited, which had received a concession from the Sudan government. Under this, the Sudanese farmer received 40% of the sales price of his crop, the government that granted the concession and provided irrigation water received 35% and the company, responsible for general management and supervision, ploughing the land and ginning the cotton had the balance of 25%.Onyeiwu, p. 101 Once the Gezira Scheme became fully operational in 1925, cotton became the principal export of the Sudan, reaching a high point in 1929 before the Great DepressionMollan, pp. 97-8  West Africa The BCGA saw West Africa as a suitable area for commercial cotton growing, particularly in Nigeria. The Gambia and Sierra Leone, although having suitable climate and soils, were heavily involved in growing peanuts and, in parts of the Gold Coast, the mining industry was the main employers.Nworah, p. 317 In general, the Association favoured production by African farmers, but in Sierra Leone and Ibadan it experimented with plantations. Although cotton production prospered in some areas, the Sierra Leone plantations failed and the lack of rail connections in other areas and high cost of sea transport from West Africa depressed producer prices.Nworah, pp. 320, 323, 326 From 1902, some attempts were made to encourage cotton growing in the River Volta region of the Gold Coast, but efforts to grow Egyptian cotton failed and American Upland Cotton was only moderately successful. The Association's efforts in the Gold Coast ceased by 1912.Dumett, pp 161-3  Nigeria Cotton, particularly in Northern Nigeria, was either rain-grown or an irrigated crop long before the colonial period. The BCGA made an agreement with the Nigerian Government in 1904 to establish model farms and a research station, build ginneries and provide suitable seeds and experts to improve the quality and quantity of the crop. Initially, yields were small and transport, except were farms were near major rivers or railways, was difficult.Bader, pp. 220-1Duggan, (1922) pp. 203-4 Cotton growing was not popular in areas where cocoa, oil palms or peanuts were grown and, in 1910 the Association's research station was closed, so by 1914 the future for cotton looked uncertain. In the Kano region, the Association's was disappointed because the local cotton industry paid as much or more to local farmers as it did, until the railway arrived there in 1912 and cut transport costs.Ijere, pp. 300-1 However, a boost in prices caused by the First World War, the Association's introduction of high-quality varieties of seed and the promotion of cotton in areas irrigated by the annual rise of Lake Chad improved yields and prices.Duggan, (1922) pp. 205-6 The Association also instituted a series of certified cotton markets in 1921, where certification by its trained graders was required for the cotton to be accepted at Association ginneries. Until 1923, it also agreed to purchase all certified cotton at a price fixed six months in advance to give growers certainty, but it withdrew this guarantee as world prices recovered from a post-war slump.Duggan, (1926) pp. 12, 14  Uganda and Kenya In 1902, the BCGA turned to Uganda as a suitable area for growing cotton, as it possessed a favourable climate and fertile soils. A high-grade long-staple cotton was introduced and, as production increased cotton become Uganda's most important cash crop.Parker, pp. 127-8 Cotton was initially planted in Buganda and extended to the Bunyoro, Busoga and Ankole districts in 1905. Ugandan cotton production increased rapidly until 1912, aided by a degree of coercion applied from 1908 onward.Nayenga, pp. 176-8 The cotton producers were then hit by fluctuating world prices and disruption caused by the First World War and many in areas with poor transport links ceased growing the crop. The Association made strenuous efforts to promote the growing of cotton in the First World War, with some success. However, after 1918, it faced strong competition from Indian traders and a significant part of the Ugandan crop was sold to India rather than Britain, as transport costs to India were lower.Anderson, pp. 322-323 Cotton found less favour in Kenya, although the association attempted to introduce it in 1906, mainly near Lake Victoria and in coastal districts. In 1914, the Association withdrew from Kenya, although its former operations there were transferred on by the British East Africa Corporation.Swainson, p.61  Nyasaland From 1903, the BCGA promoted the growing of Egyptian cotton by African farmers in the Lower Shire River valley and along the shores of Lake Nyasa. This type was unsuitable for highland areas but a variety of Upland cotton was developed for the Shire Highlands. Initially, the Association's main input was the provision of free reliable seed to local farmers, but it later provided advice on cultivation and, in 1910, it built a ginnery and purchased part of the cotton crop.Terry, pp. 60-1, 65-6 Also in 1910, the colonial administration made rules limiting who could issue seed to or purchase cotton from African farmers, creating a virtual monopoly for the Association. Although European planters growing cotton were not covered by these rules, many used the Association to purchase their cotton. After a boom in sales at the start of the First World War, discontinuance of a British Government grant in 1916 caused the association to cease operations in areas where transport was difficult, and disastrous floods in the Lower Shire in 1918, were good transport links existed, severely hit production there. A post-war slump in cotton prices convinced most European planters, and many African farmers outside the Lower Shire valley to cease growing cotton but, after 1924, production by African growers in the Lower Shire revived.Terry, pp. 64-5, 67Onyeiwu, p. 102-3  Northern and Southern Rhodesia  The BCGA's interest in both sections of colonial Rhodesia was minor, as much of these territories was climatically unsuitable for cotton growing, and there were alternative employment opportunities to growing cotton for their African populations.Elliott, p. 135 Small amounts of cotton were grown in the Zambezi valley in Southern Rhodesia and the Association saw this as a promising area to develop production by distributing suitable seed from 1904 on.Nyambara, pp. 81-2, 85 However, results were unfavourable before the First World War, as peasant farmers made more money selling maize or other foods. A wartime increase in the cotton price, intensive promotion of cotton and a further price increase in the mid-1920s caused more African farmers to turn to cotton, although white farmers expressed concern about African labour shortages on their farms. From the 1930s, cotton growing suffered from low prices and being restricted to areas considered unsuitable for tobacco growing or cattle herding, so it never realised the Association's earlier expectations.Nyambara, pp. 88-90, 95-6 The BCGA experimented with cotton growing in the areas of North-Eastern Rhodesia close to the Nyasaland border from 1908. Upland cotton of good quality could be grown there, but lack of economic transport made the cost of production excessive. The withdrawal of government support to the Association and decline in cotton prices after the First World War ended its interest in that area.Himbury, pp. 266-7  South Africa  The BCGA set-up an experimental cotton farm in the Tzaneen area near the Limpopo in 1903 and, a cotton gin was installed there in 1905. In 1913, in cooperation with the Department of Agriculture, further experimental sites for cotton were established at Rustenburg and at Barberton. These with Tzaneen became the three main centres of cotton production, all in the Transvaal. However, cotton was never of more than local important in the country until the 1930s.Taylor, pp. 259-60  Iraq  In 1920, Iraq became a League of Nations mandate under British control. The BCGA established that soil and climatic conditions are suitable for growing cotton, but only with irrigation and better transport facilities. However, the high cost of implementing infrastructure improvements prevented significant commercial production there.Bader, p. 222  West Indies  The BCGA introduced cotton growing into the West Indies and British Guiana in 1903. The bulk of the crop grown was Sea Island cotton of very fine quality, but the quantities grown were small.Himbury, p. 267  Other countries  The BCGA investigated cotton growing in Queensland Australia between 1904 and 1908 and again in 1911, but considered that the high cost of labour would prevent commercially successful operations.Hentzel, pp. 208, 211 After German East Africa was occupied by British forces in late 1918, and before it was formally mandated to Britain as Tanganyika (territory), the Association was given the task of promoting cotton production, including guaranteeing prices, arranging transport and building new ginneries. However, it was already stretched and unable to devote sufficient resources to carry this out effectively and was replaced by the Empire Cotton Growing Corporation.Kabissa, pp. 23-4  References  Sources *D.

Life Birth Safiye Sultan was born on 13 December 1696 in the Edirne Palace, thus being the third daughter of Sultan Mustafa II. Marriages Safiye was betrothed at the same time as her sisters Emine Sultan and Ayşe Sultan, to the son of Merzifonlu Kara Mustafa Pasha, known as Maktulzade Ali Pasha, and Beylerbey (governor - general) of Adana at the time. The marriage took place on 8 May 1710, during the reign of her uncle Sultan Ahmed III. The wedding procession travelled only a short distance from the Imperial Gate, through Cebehane and Soğukçeşme road to the princess's palace at Demirkapı, known as \\"Rami Pasha’s palace\\", where the marriage was consummated. Soon afterwards, in June 1710, the bridegroom was sent away to Diyarbekir to serve as provincial governor. After Ali Pasha's death in 1723, Safiye married Mirzazade Mehmed Pasha on 1 July 1726. After Mehmed Pasha's death in 1728, she married Ebu Bekr Pasha in 1740, during the reign of her half-brother Sultan Mahmud I. She was widowed at his death in 1759. Issue Safiye Sultan had a daughter Zahide Hanımsultan, who married Ebu Bekr Pasha's son Elhac Suleiman Bey, and died on 6 February 1790.

Her dowry was 20,000 ducats. A month later, after sending on her trousseau, Ayşe and her equally magnificent procession left for the Zeyrek Palace that had been allocated to her. But instead of accompanying Ayşe Sultan all the way to Zeyrek, a neighbourhood to the northwest of the Valens Aqueduct, the dignitaries went only as far as the grand vezir’s palace. From this point onwards, the more functional core of the procession, comprising the princess and her trousseau, was taken to the Zeyrek palace in a relatively quiet and unostentatious way. Numan Pasha became the grand vizier in 1710, and in 1719 the governor of Crete, where he died the same year.

Croft Castle After his marriage, Johnes lived in Herefordshire, but was active in politics in Cardiganshire for many years. His family was Whig by tradition. He was a candidate for Cardiganshire in 1741 and 1747, but withdrew each time. Later he acted as election manager for the Lloyd family of Peterwell, negotiating the election of John Lloyd for Cardiganshire in 1754 and of Herbert Lloyd for Cardigan Boroughs in 1761. Early in 1760, he boasted to the Duke of Newcastle that he had always shown attachment to Government.

It is common in the Horn of Africa, with a habitat of the Rift Valley and eastward. It feeds upon a wide variety of species, including livestock, wild mammals, and humans, and can be a vector for various pathogens. The adult male has a distinctive black and ivory ornamentation on its scutum. Taxonomy and names Male in Gerstaecker's description Male in Pocock's description Rhipicephalus pulchellus was described by Carl Eduard Adolph Gerstaecker, who initially placed it in the genus Dermacentor due to the ornamentation; all Dermacentor ticks are ornate. Its syntypes are at the Museum für Naturkunde. transferred this species to Rhipicephalus in 1897. R. I. Pocock described a junior synonym, R. marmoreus, in 1900; its holotype was deposited at the Natural History Museum, London. By 1901, Neumann had synonymized it with R. pulchellus. In 1926, Maria Tonelli-Rondelli described a subspecies R. p. humeralis, but in 1949, Fritz Konrad Ernst Zumpt reclassified it as its own species, R. humeralis. In 1904, Neumann circumscribed a new subgenus, (Eurhipicephalus), and included among its species R. (E.) pulchellus. Aldo Castellani and Albert J. Chalmers then referred to this species as Eurhipicephalus pulchellus, treating Neumann's subgenus as its own genus. B. I. Pomerantsev circumscribed a new Rhipicephalus subgenus (Lamellicauda) in 1936, which included R. (L.) pulchellus. J. A. T. Santos Dias circumscribed a subgenus, (Tendeirodes) including R. (T.) pulchellus and the three other rhipicephalids with ornamentation, i.e., R. T. dux, R. T. humeralis, and R. T. maculatus, but this subgenus is not recognized by Jane Brotherton Walker and colleagues. In 1998, Pierre-Claude Morel created a pulchellus species group within the nominate subgenus (Rhipicephalus) consisting of these four species. Based on the larval and nymphal forms of Rhipicephalus species, Walker and colleagues placed R. pulchellus in the R. appendiculatus species group, consisting of R. appendiculatus, R. armatus, R. carnivoralis, R. duttoni, R. humeralis, R. maculatus, R. muehlensi, R. nitens, R. pulchellus, R. sculptus, and R. zambeziensis. In Neumann's 1901 description of R. maculatus, he mistakenly described female specimens of R. pulchellus as representing the female of this new species. The specific epithets pulchellus and marmoreus are Latin adjectives meaning \\"beautiful little\\" and \\"made or consisting of marble\\", respectively; the word ' is a diminutive of ' \\"beautiful\\". These refer to the male scutal pattern. It is also known by the common name \\"zebra tick\\" both due to its black and white ornamentation and having the zebra as a frequent host. It is also sometimes known as the \\"yellow-backed tick\\". Description Adult male Variation in the ornamentation patterns of the male. The males have ivory ornamentation surrounding the edge of the conscutum and much of its center. The male gnathosoma is significantly longer than it is broad, with dimensions of to . Its conscutum measures to . Adult female Large \\"extreme\\" of female R. pulchellus, showing dorsal and ventral views as well as its tarsus IV. The female gnathosoma is slightly longer than it is broad, with dimensions of to . Its scutum measure to . Its scutum is mostly ivory colored and its alloscutum is dark brown. Hosts This tick has been found on many species, including both livestock and wild animals, particularly ungulates; common hosts include Burchell's and Grevy's zebras, the black rhinoceros, and antelopes such as the gemsbok, eland, and hartebeest. In one study conducted in Kenya, hundreds of specimens were found on Masai giraffes. They have been found on baboons in the Amboseli region of Kenya near Mount Kilimanjaro, although they only made up 1.8% of all ticks recorded in this study. These ticks have also been known to have elephants as their hosts. Although they far less frequently parasitize birds than they do mammals, examples exist of the ostrich and the yellow- necked francolin as hosts for this species, as well. It is a very common tick of cattle; in some parts of Ethiopia, 90% of all ticks collected from cattle and camels are R. pulchellus. This tick is present on 80% of cattle, and individuals are hosts to over 1000 of this tick each. In one study, adult ticks were found on their hosts' neck and belly (45%), head (36%), forelegs (7%), hump region (13%), and hing legs (3%), with immature ticks found on the head and forelegs. Humans Ulcer from R. pulchellus bite Immatures have been known to host on legs of humans. The tick has been described as having a \\"strong affinity for human being\\"; ulcers generally form where larvae and nymphs feed on humans, and adults have also been found feeding on humans. Disease transmission Many pathogens harmful to humans and other animals can be transmitted by this tick. The Dugbe virus has been isolated from R. pulchellus collected from sheep in Ethiopia. There is also evidence that this tick can transmit Rickettsia conorii as guinea pigs tested positive for its antibodies after being fed on. One study suggested a possible link between this tick and typhus due to a similar distribution in Kenya, although transmission was unsuccessful in laboratory settings. The Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever virus has been extracted from this tick. The West Nile virus has also been extracted from R. pulchellus. It has also been shown to transmit Nairobi sheep disease, and is likely its main vector in northern Somalia. It is the main vector for the Kismayo virus. The piroplasm Theileria taurotragi has R. pulchellus as one of its main vectors. Predators The red-billed oxpecker regularly eats this tick. Habitat and distribution This tick inhabits the Afrotropical biogeographic realm. It has been reported in the Palearctic, namely in the Giza Governorate, Egypt, but some researchers are hesitant about listing the Palearctic in its distribution based on just that report. Adult ticks looking for hosts inhabit scrub and long-grass areas. It occurs in the Horn of Africa, particularly in the Rift Valley and eastward. It lives between elevations of in semiarid bushlands and plains with an annual rainfall of . One study predicted that its habitat range will increase throughout 2100 due to climate change. It is most active during the rainy season. Population It was the most common tick in one study conducted in Haller Park, Kenya. In the early 1900s, it was very common in Kenya's Athi Plains, and also found near Nairobi, Kiambu, and Ruiru, and is the predominant tick collected from grass in the Kilimani area of Nairobi in a 1935 study. One long-term study conducted in Laikipia, Kenya involved people walking for and counting the number of ticks found on their clothing; the average number of R. pulchellus adults peaked at three. As introduced species R. pulchellus has been reported as being found on animals such as giraffes, zebras, rhinoceroses, and others that were imported into the United States, but it does not seem to have become established anywhere in the Nearctic realm.

It is located southwest of the city of Chaumont, Haute-Marne, just to the west of the Route Nationale 67 (N67) highway about north of Semoutiers-Montsaon in the Haute-Marne département of northeast France. During the early years of the Cold War, Chaumont-Semoutiers air base was used by United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE). Origins Starting in the mid-1930s, a grass airstrip was used near Chaumont by the French Air Force for training. After the fall of France, the German Luftwaffe also used the facility as a training station. After the war, the airstrip was left unused. With the outbreak of the Cold War in the late 1940s, with the Berlin Airlift, negotiations began in November 1950 between France and the United States to establish air bases and station combat wings in France to increase NATO's force strength. During the negotiations for selection of sites, the Second World War airfield at Chaumont was proposed for expansion into a modern air base. The airfield was unused since the war and there were no plans for French civil or military use. An agreement was reached to develop Chaumont into a United States Air Force tactical fighter-bomber installation there by 1953. United States Air Force tenure Construction of Chaumont- Semoutiers Air Base started on 25 January 1951, with much effort being made to have minimal facilities ready by November. Various delays, however, pushed runway construction back to October. Minimum facilities were ready for USAF use by April 1952. The entire facility was a work in progress, however, until 1956. Republic F-84G-20-RE Thunderjet Serial No 51-1231 137th/48th Fighter Bomber Wing - 1953. In May 1952, the 137th Fighter-Bomber Wing activated at Chaumont with the 125th, 127th, and 128th Fighter Squadrons flying the F-84G \\"Thunderjet\\". The squadrons were drawn from the Oklahoma, Kansas, and Georgia Air National Guards respectively. The aircraft arrived at Chaumont on 25 June, being the first USAF tactical air fighters to be based permanently in France, albeit working mostly in tents and temporary wooden buildings on their new base.  48th Fighter-Bomber Wing  Republic F-84G-1-RE Thunderjets 51-890 of the 494th Fighter Bomber Squadron and 51-830 of the 493d FBS. Note the Pierced Steel Planking being used for the parking apron as concrete pads have not yet been poured. Both aircraft were eventually sold to the Belgian Air Force as Serials FZ-175 and FZ-199. 890 was destroyed on 25 May 1955 at Sylt, West Germany. F-86F-35-NA Serial 53-1222 of the 494th Fighter-Bomber Squadron, 1955 F-86Fs of the USAFE 48th Fighter-Bomber Wing \\"Skyblazers\\" aerobatic team performing over Paris - 1955 On 10 July 1952, the 48th Fighter-Bomber Wing activated and took over the mission from the 137 FBW. The 48th, with three fighter-bomber squadrons, the 492d, 493d, and 494th gained the personnel and equipment of the 137th FBW. The 137th FBW was reassigned without personnel and equipment, back to the control of the Oklahoma Air National Guard. The 58 F-84Gs and support aircraft were assigned to the 48th FBW. The few National Guardsmen still with the wing departed. With the F-84, the 48th FBW formed part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's Allied Command Europe, participating in exercises with the United States Seventh Army. In addition, the 48th conducted operational readiness exercises and tactical evaluations. The 48th frequently deployed to Wheelus Air Base, Libya for training. On 15 January 1960, the 48 TFW redeployed to RAF Lakenheath, UK. In the early morning, the wing's three fighter squadrons lifted off Chaumont's runway and, after making farewell passes over the outlying village, headed toward the English Channel. With the departure of the 48th TFW, Chaumont-Semoutiers Air Base was placed in reserve status. The base became a satellite of Toul- Rosières Air Base, being maintained by the 7544th Combat Support Group.  1961 Berlin Crisis  After almost two years without any permanent flying units, Chaumont Air Base was reactivated as part of Operation Tack Hammer, the United States response to the Berlin Crisis of 1961. F-84Fs from the 7108th Tactical Wing in formation over Chaumont - 1962. With the end of the Berlin Crisis, these aircraft were reassigned to the 366th Tactical Fighter Wing. On 1 October 1961, as a result of the Berlin crisis, the New Jersey Air National Guard (ANG) 108th Tactical Fighter Wing was ordered to active duty. When activated, the 108th consisted of the 119th, 141st, and 149th Tactical Fighter Squadrons. All three squadrons were flying the F-84F Thunderstreak. Only a portion of the 108th TFW deployed to France due to DOD budget limitations. This consisted of 28 F-84Fs of the 141st TFS and officers and airmen from all three squadrons, with the remaining aircraft and personnel remaining on active duty at their home stations. In France, the deployed elements of the 108th TFW were designated the 7108th Tactical Wing on 20 November due to the reduced strength of the wing in Europe. The 106th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron from the 7117th Tactical Wing at Dreux-Louvillier Air Base spent all its time in France flying from Chaumont. The 7108th departed from Chaumont and was relieved from active duty in August 1962.  366th Tactical Fighter Wing  On 30 April 1962, the 366th Tactical Fighter Wing was activated and assigned to USAFE. It had four Tactical Fighter Squadrons, formed by absorbing the assets and personnel of the Air National Guard squadrons rushed to Europe in the wake of the Berlin Crisis, then as the ANG personnel were demobilized, personnel were drawn from the active-duty ranks. On 8 May 1962 it was reassigned to Seventeenth Air Force. Each squadron flew 20 former ANG F-84Fs. It was split between four bases, with the 389th Tactical Fighter Squadron located at Chaumont. On 26 April 1963, the 366 TFW was notified of its pending relocation to Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico. The initial deployment of personnel began on 4 June. Personnel and equipment were either moved to Holloman, or reassigned throughout USAFE. The 366th officially departed Chaumont on 22 July 1963. USAF closure After the departure of the 366 TFW, Chaumont was placed in reserve status, being used occasionally for NATO exercises and deployments. A small USAF contingent, the 7366th Combat Support Group maintained the facilities. By the end of 1966, all USAF equipment was removed from Chaumont, and on 26 March 1967 the last American assigned left, and the installation was turned over to French control. Current uses After the USAF withdrawal from France in 1967, the French Army took up residence at Chaumont, changing its name to Quartier General d'Aboville. The 403e Régiment d'artillerie (403e RA) operated from the installation. Detachments of the Regiment participated in the 1991 Gulf War, the humanitarian intervention in Rwanda, peacekeeping operations in Lebanon and Bosnia and various internal security system operations of the 'Vigipirate' and 'Polmar' type. The Regiment was disbanded on 30 June 1999. In 1999, the French Army 61e Régiment d'artillerie (61e RA) Aerial Surveillance Regiment arrived at Chaumont equipped with the CL 289 drone. The 61st Artillery regiment has deployed on NATO exercises to Bosnia and Kosovo. In addition to the Army, the French militarised police Force (Gendarmerie Nationale) has also taken up residence at Chaumont-Semoutiers. References * Endicott, Judy G.

It was formed at the beginning of the Defence of Madrid in early spring 1937 with battalions of the Carabineros corps and it remained in Madrid all along the war. Its first commander was Carabineros Lt. Colonel Enrique del Castillo Bravo who was succeeded by Carabineros Commanders Emeterio Jarillo Orgaz and José Casted Sena.Carlos Engel, Historia de las Brigadas Mixtas del E. P. de la República, 1999 This unit should not be confused with the 8th Santander Brigade or 8th Mixed Brigade of the Santander Army Corps (Cuerpo del Ejército de Santander) led by Militia Major Juan Egea Jiménez,Miguel Ángel Solla Gutiérrez, La República sitiada: Trece meses de Guerra Civil en Cantabria, p. 324 which later became the 169th Mixed Brigade. History A predecessor unit was established in March 1937 at the Madrid Front as \\"Brigada M\\". It was organized with the 4th, 15th and 16th Carabineros battalions. During the instruction period the unit was under the command of Carabineros Lt. Colonel Enrique del Castillo Bravo. At the onset of the Civil War del Castillo was Engineer Captain at the Nr 1 Railway Regiment (Regimiento de Ferrocarriles nº 1) at Leganés and was transferred to the Carabineros Corps. Later the command of the unit was handed over to Carabineros Commander Emeterio Jarillo Orgaz, who at the time of the coup of July 1936 was Lieutenant at the 6th Command of the corps in Alicante Province. The Chief of Staff was Major Ruiz del Toro and the Comissar Demetrio Martín Martínez. One month after its establishment the Brigada M was renamed 8th Mixed Brigade (8.ª Brigada Mixta) and was placed under the 18th Division of the III Army Corps of the Central Army. Towards the end of 1937 Jarillo was replaced by Carabineros Commander José Casted Sena, who had been as well at the 6th Command of the Carabineros corps in Alicante, but as captain. The unit remained in the same division and at the same sector of the Madrid Front for the remaining two years of the war. It specialized in trench warfare and remained in its post until 27 March 1939 when the Madrid defense crumbled. Militia Captain Juan Borrás Garcerán was named Chief of Staff a few days before the surrender of the Republic that marked the end of the war.

He was vilified by the press, partly on account of his eccentric appearance and long flowing hair, even after he had been released on bail by the police. The film was directed by Roger Michell, written by Peter Morgan, and starred Jason Watkins in the title role of Christopher Jefferies. The title is taken from The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum by Heinrich Böll, a famous fictional account of media defamation.https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/the-fate-of- christopher-jefferies-shows-that-it-can-still-be-dangerous-to-be- different-9921920.html Plot The drama begins the day before Yeates’ disappearance, and follows the innocent Jefferies through his arrest, release and subsequent isolation as his un-sought fame profoundly affects his life. Five weeks later the real killer, neighbour Vincent Tabak, is finally arrested.

The show is a sequel to the original 1974 series of the same name, which both Clement and La Frenais wrote. The sitcom focuses on prison inmate, Nigel Norman Fletcher (played by Bishop), the grandson of Norman Stanley Fletcher, who is sent to Wakeley Prison to serve a five year sentence for cyber crimes. The programme's creation came about when the BBC decided to air a one-off special of Porridge as part of its Landmark Sitcom Season in 2016, which later proved popular with viewers and led to a series being commissioned, with Clement and La Frenais recruited into the show's production team. The first episode premiered on 6 October 2017. Premise The main storylines of the show focus on its central character, Nigel Norman Fletcher, a talented computer specialist, who is sent to the fictional Wakeley Prison in southern England, to serve a five year prison sentence for cyber crimes, the proceeds of which he used to support his now ex-girlfriend's lifestyle. Much like his grandfather, Norman Stanley Fletcher, Nigel has his own personal opinions of criminal life that he likes to voice out, though he considers himself to be an \\"uncommon criminal\\", as he has some regret of the actions he committed, and often seeks to avoid being caught up in illegal schemes that could endanger his well-being or add time to his sentence. Each episode's plot usually focuses on events that Fletcher becomes involved in. In addition to Fletcher, the series also features an array of supporting characters. Like his grandfather, Fletcher shares a cell with another prisoner named Joe Lotterby, a senior but veteran old-time criminal who knew his grandfather and his old cell-mate Lennie Godber, and has a somewhat cynical view on life as a result of his previous sentences in prison, while he often comes into conflict with prison officer Mr Meekie, whose character is similar to that of Mr Mackay from the original series, in that he firmly dislikes Fletcher and often suspects him of being up to something, and who often mocks him in return as a result. Although Fletcher has a firm dislike of the prison guards, he has some respect for other prison officer Mr Braithwaite, whose character is similar to that of Mr Barrowclough in the original series, in that he is more gentle and trusting of the prisoners and thus quite gullible, although he is quite meek when fights break out and slightly dim on some areas, such as jokes. Fletcher is close friends with two other prisoners, Shel and Aziz, and often has dealings with Dougie Parfitt, a hardcore criminal involved in contraband and drugs, who sometimes requests Fletcher's help with a scheme he is working on, and is often assisted by his right-hand man Scudds (referred to as \\"Scuddsy\\" by Fletcher), who is somewhat dim-witted, but has feelings and a deep respect for Fletcher. Cast * Kevin Bishop as Nigel Norman Fletcher * Dave Hill as Joe Lotterby * Mark Bonnar as Mr Meekie * Dominic Coleman as Mr Braithwaite * Harry Peacock as Dougie Parfitt * Ricky Grover as Scudds * Jason Barnett as Shel * Harman Singh as Aziz * Colin Hoult as Barry * Daniel Fearn as Ullett * Rory Gallagher as Loomis * Pippa Haywood as Governor Littlewood * Caolan Byrne as Culhane For the one-off special, Colin McFarlane portrayed the character of The Judge, who sentences Fletcher for his crimes. Much like in the original series, the narration given in the opening titles, is voiced by McFarlane. Production In March 2016, it was announced that a sequel pilot to Porridge would air as part of the BBC's Landmark Sitcom Season, starring Kevin Bishop as Norman Stanley Fletcher's grandson and written by the original writers Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais. After the success of the pilot, in October 2016, BBC One commissioned the show for a full series which went into production in January 2017. However there are no plans for a second run due to poor ratings. Episodes Seven episodes of Porridge, all written by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, were produced for the BBC. The show began airing on 28 August 2016 and ended on 10 November 2017. All episodes had a running time of 30 minutes.

Sometimes jewellery used by the Dutch royal family are dubbed \\"crown jewels\\". In the past, the terms \\"House-diamonds\\", \\"House- jewels\\" (Will of William I in 1841, Art. 12) and \\"family jewels\\" (1784 in the will of William V) have been used. In 1790 the term \\"Bijoux de la Couronne\\" was used by Luise of Brunswick -Wolfenbüttel to refer to a large diamond from Borneo. In 1896 the Firm of van Kempen & Begeer wrote about resetting the jewels of the Crown (\\"juweleelen der kroon\\"). Queen Juliana gave a selection of her formal jewelry to the new Foundation Regalia of the House of Orange- Nassau, instituted on 27 July 1963. In 1968 a Foundation \\"Kroongoederen van het Huis van Oranje-Nassau\\" was instituted. It owns the regalia and the House- jewels. The Houses of Orange and Nassau have a collection of jewels, including diamonds and pearls. The famous Small Sancy diamond of 34 carat was bought by Frederik Hendrik, and is now in the collection of the Prussian Royal Family. These collections have been dispersed several times. After the death of William III in 1702 there were several heirs in Germany, descendants of his grandfather Prince Frederick Henry. The famous Orange pearls were sent to Prussia. In the 19th century the daughters and granddaughters of William I and the daughter of William II were given a large collection of jewels when they married. The jewels are now by inheritance in the collections of the royal and princely families of Sweden, Denmark, Prussia and Saxen-Weimar. Consecutive Princes of Orange and Kings of the Netherlands have tried to institute a collection of crown-jewels that weren't a fideï comis and were therefore inseparable but they did not succeed. It was King William III of the Netherlands who decided that a number of gems and jewels were to be \\"the diamonds of the Crown\\". They were to be reserved for the ruling monarch and his consort.René Brus Amongst these \\"crown jewels\\" are large and old fashioned tiaras, devants the corsage and necklaces set with large emeralds, sapphires, diamonds and rubies. They are sometimes worn during state-banquettes.René Brus The most impressive solitaire in the collection is a light blue dropshape rose-cut Indian diamond that once belonged to Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange. It is as \\"large as the egg of a dove and as clear as water\\". It has now been worn again by queen Maxima after spending decades in the royal vaults. The diamond has no official name but it has been referred to as the \\"Stuart\\" or \\"Holland\\" diamond in the past.René Brus It was set in a tiara in 1897 by Jeweller Eduard Schürmann & Co. in Frankfurt. The diamond weights about 40 crt, the entire tiara weights 2400 gr. The sets of diamonds, rubies and sapphires given to Queen Wilhelmina and Queen Juliana were not legally part of these collection. The set of jewels containing 800 diamonds and the famous \\"Garuda\\" bracelet from the Dutch East Indies that were given to the then Princess Juliana were broken up after their deaths. The stones are now part of several earrings, brooches and other jewels.René Brus During World War II the Dutch Crown Jewels were flown for safekeeping from The Hague to the UK and were kept in the vaults of Wolverhampton Town Hall.

Biography  Born in Juilly (Seine-et- Marne),Archives of Seine-et-Marne, commune of Juilly, birth certificate No 25, year 1898 (vue 112 /202) (without marginal mention of death) the son of composer Dynam-Victor Fumet (a student with César Franck, 1867–1949), brother of writer Stanislas Fumet, father of flautist Gabriel Fumet, Raphaël Fumet showed exceptional talent as a pianist and improviser at an early age. Raphaël Fumet In parallel to his studies of musical composition with Vincent d'Indy at the Schola Cantorum de Paris, he was employed in many Parisian cinemas where his extraordinary facilities allowed him to improvise directly on the organ on the images of silent films of that time. His charisma as a musician earned him the friendship of many artists, mainly in Montparnasse; he was especially connected with painters and sculptors as yet unknown as Soutine, Modigliani, Jeannette Hébuterne, Juan Gris, Joseph Bernard… Raphaël Fumet, who was very independent by nature and naturally had little incentive to confront the sectarianism exacerbated by the aesthetic quarrels of his time, withdrew first to the countryside in the famous College of Juilly in Seine-et-Marne where he remained ten years as Maître de chapelle. During the 1940 debacle, he left Jully with his family and moved to Angers where he became professor of piano and harmony at the conservatory, as well as organist at St. Joseph's Church, continuing his father's work in almost complete isolation.  His work  The history of art has always been that of genius rather than that of the various academics seeking a \\"historically correct\\" aesthetic consensus. Raphaël Fumet's music is a remarkable illustration of this paradox. Raphaël Fumet Although he possessed the qualities of an outstanding creator, he essentially lacked a fundamental social know-how at a time when the composer was totally dependent on the structures of the institution that governed his art in this very tough competition. This probably explains the extraordinary abandonment of his work, which has only just begun to be published. Of course, the fact that his music never broke with a lineage that could be located from Monteverdi to Stravinsky through his father Dynam-Victor Fumet whom he worshipped, did not facilitate his promotion at a time when any language that did not recommend itself to the avant-gardism was considered worthless. Moreover, convinced that his music had little chance of being understood, Raphaël Fumet would do almost nothing for the diffusion of his work. \\"I no longer believe in the success of serious music,\\" he wrote to a friend about one of his works, Le Colloque des Horizons, which unfortunately has disappeared. \\"The man of the century wants to enjoy in music anything other than harmony, in the proper and universal sense of the word. He wants sensual or \\"scientific\\" but never love that looks like trees and flowers, which makes him look old-fashioned and meaningless. It is true that the realization of a musical piece is such a work, such an undertaking on one's own life, that one has little time in its completion to take care of, if his dear daughter, the day of her presentation to the public, will have success at the ball...\\" Though condemned to create in silence until his death, without ever hearing the echo of his music, Raphaël Fumet has left us - in spite of his inevitable discouragement - a certain number of works that are all significant in their diversity, testifying to the non-conformist freedom of their author, and to the search, against all odds, for musical beauty alone. Listening to this so strong work, leads to consider that there is not a sense of history of unique and ineluctable art, but different directions sometimes contradictory with, in some cases, possible returns to previous horizons...

Description The rhizomatous perennial herb grass-like sedge typically grows to a height of and has a tufted habit. It blooms between November and February producing green-brown flowers. The culms are rigid with a terete arrangement. The culms grow to around in height and have a diameter of about . The leaves are just sheaths. The simple or compound inflorescence has four to twelve primary branches up to a length of approximately but usually shorter. The spikelets are flattened with between four and fifteen in each cluster each are long and in width. Following flowering a grey-brown trigonous nut with an obovoid to ellipsoid shape will form. The nut is around in length with a diameter of about . Taxonomy The species was first formally described by the botanist Robert Brown in the work Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen that was published in 1810. The samples were collected in 1802 during an expedition by and to map the South Australian coastline. The species name vaginatus is taken from the Latin word, vagina, meaning sheath. Distribution The plant is found in subtropical regions extending into tropical areas in the northern end of its range. In Western Australia it is found along creeks and streams in the Kimberley, Pilbara, Gascoyne, Mid West and Goldfields-Esperance regions where it grows in sandy- clay alluvium often around limestone. The species is also found in north western and south eastern South Australia, Victoria, Queensland, the Northern Territory and New South Wales. It will grow well in full sun to part shade in well-drained soils but can need watering in summer when cultivated. In Victoria the species was once found in the Grampians and around Swan Hill but no specimens have been collected in 1913 and it is now possibly extinct in these areas. Uses Cyperus vaginatus can be harvested from the wild as a source of fibre. The fibre is taken from the outer parts of the stems and is traditionally used by Indigenous Australians to make nets and cordage. The species is known to attract butterflies.

C. Tecklenborg was a German shipbuilding company, located at the river Geeste in Bremerhaven. About 440 ships of different types, including many famous tall sailing ships were built at the yard. Founded in 1841 it was finally closed in 1928.  History  The beginning dates back to September 30, 1841 when Johann (Jan) Simon Abegg and P.H. Ulrichs started the small shipyard \\"Abegg & Co\\" in Bremerhaven near the mouth of the river Geeste. This venture was financed by the entrepreneur and shipowner Franz Tecklenborg (1807-1886) from Bremen. In 1843 Franz Tecklenborg took over all activities but handed the operational responsibility to his brother the shipbuilder Johann Carl Tecklenborg (1820-1873). From this point on the shipyard operated under the name \\"Johann C.Tecklenborg\\". When Franz Tecklenborg decided to extend the fleet of his shipping company based in Bremen he ordered 19 vessels at the yard of his brother in the following years. To cope with rising demand of ships the shipyard opened a new site across the river Geeste in Geestemüde in 1852. In 1872 Franz Tecklenborgs youngest son Eduard Tecklenborg (1849-1926) entered into the company and took on responsibility. After the death of Johann Carl Tecklenborg in 1873 the technical management was handed over to the talented engineer Georg Wilhelm Claussen (1845-1919). As of 1880 iron and then steel replaced wood as the core material for the hull of all ships build by Joh. C.Tecklenborg. The shipyard build several of the so-called Flying P-Liners. In 1897 the company was converted into a stock cooperation and operated as Joh. C. Tecklenborg Schiffswerft- und Maschinenfabrik AG. In 1914 over 4300 people were employed by the shipyard. In 1926 Tecklenborg became member of the Deschimag - a cooperation of several more or less important German shipyards under the leadership of Bremen's shipyard AG Weser. But already two years later in 1928 the Tecklenborg shipyard was finally closed. Reasons were the low market trend of new construction of merchant ships because of the upcoming economic crisis and the following global depression in the 1930th, the internal local competition between the both great shipyards in Bremerhaven Tecklenborg and G. Seebeck, but last not least the competition to the leading company AG Weser. About 2,500 people lost their jobs in Bremerhaven at that time. The last ship delivered by Tecklenborg was the Schulschiff Deutschland in 1927.  Ships built by Joh. C. Tecklenborg (selection)  • 1846, Rappahannock, first ship of the yard, type of the ship is unknown • 1899, , the first and closest vessel to respond to distress signals from the in April 1912.

His titles included Count of Cardona and Viscount of Vilamur. Comte de Cardona i vescomte de Vilamur. His parents were Hug I, 1st Count of Cardona, and his wife Beatriu. Biography  In 1396 Joan Ramon, heir of Cardona, was one of the magnates who went to Sicily to assist its new king, Martín. The young king soon granted him the investiture to the Admiralty previously held by his father. Upon the death of his father, the first count, Hug de Cardona, in 1400 he inherited the county of Cardona. He inherited the title of Admiral of Aragon.

In 1412 they both lodged their protest against the way the delegates for the Compromis de Casp had been elected. However, once the decision had been pronounced, choosing Ferran de Antequera as the new king of Aragon, the count Joan Ramon I was fervently loyal to the new dynasty and refused to collaborate with the Urgellist revolt of 1413. In 1418 count Joan Ramon I was the Ambassador of king Alfonso V to the Church Council of Constance. In 1423 count Joan Ramon I commanded the fleet that brought to besieged Naples the troops lead by the infante Pere. These reinforcements allowed king Alfonso V to retake the city of Naples.

The group consisted of rebels from the Druze community in Syria, particularly in the Suwayda Governorate. The group disbanded in the beginning of 2014 after frequent attacks on it by Sunni Islamist groups, particularly al-Qaeda's al-Nusra Front. History The founder and first commander of the group was First Lieutenant Khaldoun Sami Zinedine, a defector from the Syrian Armed Forces. Zinedine defected near Damascus, moved to the Daraa Governorate, and joined the Free Officers Brigade in October 2011. In December 2011, he announced the formation of the Sultan Pasha al-Atrash Battalion. The group stated that its goal was to protect demonstrators in and around Suwayda. In July 2012, the group blew up a Syrian Air Force ammunition depot in the Thula Military Airbase near Suwayda. In January 2013, the Sultan Pasha al-Atrash Battalion launched an offensive against Syrian government forces in Dahr al-Jabal, near Suwayda. On 23 January, 1st Lt. Khaldoun Zinedine was killed in action during the offensive, which was repelled by government forces and a number of his fighters were \\"wiped out\\". After his death, Khaldoun was succeeded by his brother, 1st Lt. Fadlallah Zinedine, as the commander of the group. Tensions between the group and Sunni Islamist groups cumulated through 2013. The group initially cooperated with the Dawn of Islam Brigade in Daraa. In October 2013, 2 fighters from the Sultan Pasha al-Atrash Battalion were captured by the \\"Sharia Commission in Daraa\\" and sentenced to death.. Some time in late 2013, 1st Lt. Fadlallah Zinedine was captured and detained for several hours by al- Qaeda's al-Nusra Front in Daraa. In January 2014, the Sultan Pasha al-Atrash Battalion announced that it would suspend all of its operations in Syria and leave for Jordan. It cited the lack of support for the Suwayda Military Council and other Druze rebel groups from the Supreme Military Council, the \\"conspiracy of radical Islamists\\" and \\"hostilities\\" toward the people of Suwayda in general.

Wood left his .38 Enfield revolver in the kitchen and called the police before fleeing the scene. He went on the run for over a week, making several telephone calls to journalists and family members. Eight days later he threatened to jump off the Amiens Cathedral in France but was talked down by the police after seven hours. He was then extradited back to Sheffield for trial. On 30 July 1987, Wood was convicted on two counts of murder, one of attempted murder and one of theft, after a week-long trial. He had pleaded not guilty to the murder of Danielle, instead submitting a manslaughter plea claiming he killed her to complete a suicide pact. An appeal against the guilty verdict was filed a month later and rejected in 1989. The case impacted upon British firearms policy, especially the manner in which regional police forces communicate over firearm ownership. Background Ian Wood (born 1949) began renting Ughill Hall, an 18-room mansion on the outskirts of Bradfield, with his mistress Danielle Ledez in April 1986 after leaving his wife Margaret and his three children. Wood was a solicitor and the ex secretary of the Law Society in Sheffield. Danielle Ledez (1948-1986) was a French teacher from Amiens, France, who moved to Ughill Hall with Wood and her two children whilst in the process of divorcing her second husband (and father of the children) Colin Lloyd, a teacher from Sheffield. Shootings An Enfield No. 2 revolver similar to the one Wood used. At approximately 12 midnight on 21 September 1986, Wood went to the playroom in the mansion and killed his mistress Danielle Ledez by shooting her once in the head. Ledez was 10 weeks pregnant by Wood. Wood then proceeded to play hide-and-seek with Ledez's daughter Stephanie (aged 3), after which he led her into Christopher's bedroom and shot her twice in the head, killing her instantly. He then took Ledez's son Christopher (aged 5) into the bathroom and told him to close his eyes as he had a surprise for him, then shot him twice in the head. Wood then bludgeoned the boy with a large ruler four or five times in the back of the head. Wood changed clothes, packed his bags, and left the house shortly afterwards, leaving the weapon he used, an .38 Enfield revolver, in the kitchen with one live round left. The police went to the mansion on the evening of 22 September 1986 after receiving a telephone call from Wood; finding all the doors and windows locked, they broke down the door. Christopher was rushed to Sheffield Children's Hospital with severe head injuries and was placed on life support after surviving without medical attention for 21 hours. Manhunt Initial response Following the discovery of the bodies, the police appealed to Wood to turn himself in and warned members of the public not to approach him as he may be armed. Wood's wife Margaret and their three children were put under police protection immediately, as was Ledez's husband Colin Lloyd. A total of five homes in England were put under protection throughout the manhunt. A formal arrest warrant was issued on 23 September 1986 with more details on Wood's flight, including the numberplate of the car he fled in. Phone calls On 23 September 1986, a police press conference was interrupted when Wood made a series of telephone calls to Brenda Tunney, a reporter for the local newspaper Sheffield Weekly Gazette. Wood refused to disclose his location but claimed the purpose of the calls was to \\"put his side\\". Wood made no further telephone calls to either the police or journalists for nearly 48 hours after the initial series of calls. By 26 September he had made at least eight phone calls. On 27 September, Wood called Tunney four times asking about funeral arrangements for Ledez and her daughter. The police discussed the mental state of Wood with a consultant psychiatrist on the same day due to the firearm confiscations and the phone calls. The following day, Wood made three more calls to Tunney and threatened suicide in one of them; he claimed he killed because of \\"love and desperation, not anger and hate\\". Potential whereabouts On 25 September, a receptionist at the Automobile Association office in Barnstaple reported that a man matching Wood's description had requested an international driving licence. Interpol were notified of the case on the same day, after which French police interviewed Ledez's parents. Up until this point, Wood, who owned no other properties, was believed by police to still be in the Yorkshire area. After Wood's capture, British and French authorities were \\"puzzled\\" by the ease with which Wood travelled under his own name. At his trial, it was established that Wood had gone to a pub after committing the killings and then, over the course of the next few days, travelled to Dover where he caught a ferry to France. Surrender Ian Wood on the gargoyle at Amiens Cathedral On 29 September, Wood joined a public tour of Amiens Cathedral, approximately away from Ledez's birthplace, but broke away from the tour group at about 12 noon, climbed over the parapet, and clung to a gargoyle about above the ground, threatening to commit suicide by jumping off. He left a note with a member of staff at the cathedral shortly beforehand informing them of his intention to commit suicide, which prompted them to call the police. The police, firemen, the church's priest, and members from the British Consulate pleaded with Wood for seven hours, at which point Wood surrendered. A crowd of several hundred people had gathered to watch from below. Wood later claimed that he did not wish his family to see his fall on television, describing the scene as \\"a circus\\". Wood had telephoned Ledez's family to inform them of his intention to commit suicide. Legal proceedings Extradition A day after Wood's surrender, British police filed an extradition request to French authorities to send Wood back to the UK for prosecution. Wood decided not to object to the extradition request after a brief meeting with his family and was confident that he would receive a fair trial in a British court. On 7 October, a formal request on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions was made to a magistrate in Sheffield. Wood was flown back to the UK on 19 November where he was remanded in custody. Remand The police successfully applied to continue holding Wood on remand on double murder and attempted murder charges at Sheffield Magistrates' Court on 22 November. Wood made a further short committal appearance in court on 1 December and his trial was formally announced on 3 February 1987. Trial Sheffield Old Town Hall, the venue for Wood's trial =Pleas and charges= On 1 December 1986, the prosecution charged Wood on two counts of murder and one count of attempted murder, for Danielle, Stephanie, and Christopher, respectively. Wood also faced a specimen charge of stealing £84,000 from clients he represented in property deals, although the prosecution claimed the sum could have been £150,000. Wood pleaded not guilty to the murder of Danielle and instead entered a manslaughter plea on the grounds that they had agreed to a suicide pact. The prosecution did not accept the manslaughter plea and pursued a trial for the murder of Danielle. However, Wood pleaded guilty to the murder of Stephanie and the attempted murder of Christopher. He also pleaded guilty to stealing £84,000 from clients. =Suicide pact claim= The Homicide Act 1957 states that if a person kills someone in pursuance of a suicide pact and then does not commit suicide themselves, they are guilty only of manslaughter and not murder. However, Geoffrey Rivlin, leading the prosecution, told the court that in such a situation the onus is on the killer to prove that a suicide pact was made. Wood gave the court a detailed account of the five-point agreement he claimed to have made with Ledez as to what to do after the killings and before his suicide: #Visit a French church and light candles for Ledez and her children. #Send a detailed explanation of the deaths to the press. #Kill Ledez's husband, Colin Lloyd. #Ensure Ledez and her children were buried in a French village cemetery. #Visit their graves and lay flowers for them. Rivlin argued that Wood's story did \\"not have a ring of truth about it\\". Several of Ledez's French friends who were interviewed by police claimed that Ledez had shown no signs of depression or suicidal intentions. In addition, her mother received a telephone call hours before Ledez died and she did not suspect her daughter was suicidal. To support Wood's claim, the defence called Wood's mother, who said that Ledez had confided her suicidal intention to her on multiple occasions and that she feared that her husband Colin would physically harm her or Christopher. The witness also stated that Wood had called her within 24 hours of the shootings and explained the plan to her. The prosecution called Alan Wales, Wood's doctor, who testified that he advised the police to confiscate Wood's gun collection after an appointment on 11 November 1985. Wales said that Wood appeared \\"distressed\\" and prescribed him with antidepressants. On 30 July 1987, the final day of the trial, the prosecution argued that Wood's suicide threat on Amiens Cathedral was not genuine and was done only to disguise his true motive, with Rivlin summarising that Wood \\"killed out of his obsessive hatred, not love\\". Gilbert Gray, leading the defence, argued that Wood had nothing to gain from lying about a suicide pact because he would be sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder and attempted murder of Ledez's children anyway. =Verdict and sentencing= On 31 July 1987, the jury at Sheffield Crown Court unanimously rejected Wood's claim that he killed Ledez as part of a suicide pact and found him guilty of murder. Justice Taylor sentenced Wood to life imprisonment for each murder, 12 years for the attempted murder, and three years for the specimen charges of theft from clients. Wood was struck off the Law Society register and the Law Society Compensation Fund paid out at least £240,000 in compensation to the theft victims. Appeal On 28 August 1987, Wood's solicitor filed an appeal against the guilty verdict. The appeal was rejected on 25 July 1989. Aftermath Previous confiscations and police dispute After the trial, a dispute occurred between South Yorkshire Police and Sussex Police over which force was responsible for erroneously allowing Wood access to firearms. Wood's ten-piece gun collection had been confiscated twice; firstly in December 1985 over fears from his wife and doctor of deteriorating mental health and alcoholism, and secondly because of an administrative error in renewing his licence. The guns were returned two weeks after the first confiscation. South Yorkshire Police later said that they had to return them because there was no evidence that Wood was a threat to himself or others. In March 1986, Wood bought 50 rounds of ammunition in Sheffield for his .38 Enfield revolver which he had inherited after his father used it to commit suicide. South Yorkshire Police ascribed these events to an \\"administrative mix-up\\" with Sussex Police, who were responsible for executing the firearms clause in Wood's father's will. Sussex Police said that when Wood asked for the gun and the remaining 11 rounds they tried to dissuade him but he returned a month later with a renewed firearms certificate from South Yorkshire Police. The differing interpretations of the Firearms Act by the two police forces resulted in the Home Office intervening and seeking a detailed explanation from both forces and holding talks with them over possible amendments to the Firearms Act. Firearms policy Bill Michie, the Member of Parliament for Sheffield Heeley, campaigned for stricter firearm ownership regulations, such as psychiatric assessment of prospective gun owners, in response to the murders. In October 1986, Michie asked Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher if the government would change its firearms policy in response to the murders, to which she responded: \\"The Home Office ... will keep that matter under permanent review\\". Less than a month after Wood's conviction, the Hungerford massacre took place, in which Michael Robert Ryan killed 16 people. This prompted Parliament to pass the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988, which banned civilian ownership of nearly all semi-automatic weapons.

HIs titles included Count of Cardona and Count-consort of Prades, as well as Viscount of Vilamur. 'Juan Ramón Folch de Cardona y Ximenez de Arenós' His parents were Joan Ramon I, 2nd Count of Cardona, and his wife Joana de Gandia.  Biography  He was born in (circa) 1400. In 1404, he received the Viscountcy of Vilamur from his family. When his father, the 2nd Count of Cardona, died, he inherited the title of Admiral of Aragon. on 22 May 1423, he was made 3rd Count of Cardona, Admiral of Aragon by the Lieutenant of Aragon and queen in charge of Aragonese–Catalan affairs on behalf of her absent husband, Alfonso V of Aragon, who resided at Naples, Italy. He became, at the age of four years, 1st Viscount of Vilamur in 1404. Almost twenty years later, In 1430?, Folch commanded a fleet of 22 galleys and eight big ships, assisting Aragonese king Alfonso V of Aragon, (1395 - king of Aragon and Sicily 1416 - king of Naples \\"manu militari\\" between 1434 - 1458), who was besieged in Naples. On his return home, he took the French city of Marseille. For his actions he was awarded by Alfonso V of Aragon brother, king John II of Aragon, (king successor 1458 - 1479) the Sicilian town of Termes, in 1463, during which time King John II was at Tudela, kingdom of Navarre, where he was disputing with his son, Charles of Viana, the Navarrese throne, illegally, in spite of being a widower of Queen Blanca I of Navarre, (1385–1441). King don Juan II, battling against his own rebelling Catalan subjects, experienced extreme difficulties in 1467, but in 1468, the younger son of later king (since 1479) John II of Aragon, 16-year- old Ferdinand II of Aragon, received the military help of this 3rd Count of Cardona, who died in 1471. In the aftermath of the Compromis de Casp, the young Joan Ramon was still planned to marry Cecilia de Urgell, sister of the vanquished throne candidate Jaume, Count of Urgell. However, by 1418 this wedding project for him had ended in failure. Instead, the young heir Joan Ramon de Cardona was in 1418 married with Joana de Prades, a younger sister of the Dowager Queen Margarida. and Juana Gonzalva Ximenez de Arenós, Countess of Prades, Lady of the Barony of Entença (Sp. ), sister of the Margerida de Prades who married the aged and ailing King Martin I of Aragon Joana inherited the county of Prades and the barony of Entenza, by royal decision of 1425. This made the young Joan Ramon a sitting peer, Count of Prades, in the parliament, already in lifetime of his father. It even meant that the son's rank was higher than the father's, because Prades was a more senior peerage. The father and son always presented themselves together in the parliament. The younger Joan Ramon was active in parliamentary politics. His father died in 1442, and Joan Ramon II inherited Cardona too. In 1445, as a belated consequence of the death of his father, he decided to renounce Prades and Vilamur in favor of his own son, Joan Ramon III. However, from about 1445, he also lived in retirement in Cardona, taking an abstentionist role to politics. When the civil war broke out in 1462, the county of Cardona was one of the loyals of don Juan the Unreliable. Despite of the old count's inactivity, this loyalty caused the Catalan authorities to declare the elderly Count Joan Ramon II as enemy of the Principality of Catalonia, in 1462.

In May 1812 the military governor of the Isles of Scilly, Lieutenant General Vigoureux, requested a new signal tower station on Newford Down, St Mary’s to allow signals to be passed from the mainland in Cornwall to the batteries below Star Castle. The Admiralty agreed and adverts for its construction were placed in October 1813. After a series of delays, the tower was erected by Messrs. Hambledon. The date of construction is quoted as 1814, but it was reported in the Hampshire Chronicle on 8 January 1816 that had been erected on Newford Down, Scilly, and Lieutenant John Trinder RN was appointed to superintend it. However, the tower appears to have been unsuccessful and in December 1816, it was closed down by the Admiralty and the building reverted to the custody of the land owner, George Osborne, 6th Duke of Leeds. In 1831 the site was taken over by HM Coastguard as a subsidiary to the main station situated on the Garrison. In 1903 a wireless mast and receiving office were built nearby, The Newford Down semaphore station became known as Telegraph Tower, and the area around it is now known as Telegraph. The Lloyd’s Mercantile Marine Signal Station in the garrison was closed and the work of signalling passing ships was carried out by the coastguards at Telegraph Tower. In 1908 a telegraph house was erected on the tower's roof by the contractor, Arthur Carkeep.

It is about friendship and survival. A fictional story based on real events, covering the untold story of Republican women prisoners involvement in the 1980/81 Dirty Protest and first hunger strike. It is inspired by Nell McCafferty's The Armagh Women and adapted on the play/screenplay \\"Now and at the hour of our Death\\" that Murphy co-wrote with theatre company Trouble and Strife. Silent Grace stars Orla Brady, Cathleen Bradley, with Cara Seymour, Dawn Bradfield, Carol Scanlan, Conor Mullen, and Patrick Bergin. It received completion funds from The Irish Film Board. Silent Grace was chosen as the UK entry for the Cannes Film Festival in 2002 but as it previously screened in the Cannes market in 2001, it could not be considered any further for competition. The film premiered at the Galway Film Fleadh 2001. It then was selected for the Taormina, Moscow, Foyle, Dinard and Hamptons International Film Festival USA (nominated for the Conflict and Resolution Award). A small cinema release followed in UK/Ireland via Guerilla Films in 2004. Silent Grace was critically acclaimed, and was awarded the Soka Art Award (Japan). Silent Grace experienced a revival and wider audience in 2017 after 3 major articles in the Irish Times Culture section about the women and the film that had been written out of history. On 24 June 2017, TV3 gave Silent Grace its nationwide broadcast premiere at primetime, in the Republic of Ireland, on Be3. TV3 said in IFTN \\"Silent Grace firmly puts women back in the 1980s narrative and makes compelling viewing\\". The Sunday Times made it one of the \\"Films of the Week\\" Plot Aine a young tear away criminal is thrown into the same cell as Eileen, a high ranking Republican woman leader. At first at odds, Eileen helps save Aine’s sanity. An unlikely friendship develops between them as Aine joins the protest and Eileen helps her to survive. In a remarkable turn around of events when Eileen embarks on a hunger strike, Aine risks all to help save her life... Cast * Orla Brady as Eileen * Cathleen Bradley as Aine * Cara Seymour as Margaret *Dawn Bradley as Geraldine *Carol Scanlan as Aine's Mother *Rob Newman as Father McGarry *Conor Mullen as the Governor *Patrick Bergin as Peter/IRA Leader Reception Silent Grace was critically acclaimed. Michael Dwyer in the Irish Times gave it 3 stars and said it was \\"unusually even-handed, well judged... rooted in its humanist agenda, surmounts the limits of its very low budget, to emerge as a work of sincerity and concern.\\" Tara Brady wrote in Dublin's Hot Press, where it was Critics Choice, \\"Maeve Murphy must be some kind of genius... brilliantly confounds expectations... compelling coming of age drama, wonderfully humane... Orla Brady is magnificent.... I urge you to seek it out\\". Larushka Ivan-Zadeh in the Metro in London gave it 4 stars \\"compelling.\\" And it was in their Top Ten Films for 2 weeks. Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian said it \\"bodes well for Murphy's future movies'. Ronnie Schieb in Variety, David Parkinson in The Radio Times, The Evening Standard, Rich Cline in Shadows on the Wall, Anton Bietel in Movie Gazette, Belfast Telegraph and The Huffington Post reviewed it favourably. However, as more films were made about the male hunger strikers, Silent Grace often ceased to be mentioned in the hunger strike film discourse. It wasn't until its 2017 revival when it was placed fully back on the map due to the promoting of the film from the Irish Times and TV3. Silent Grace was received very favourably, with a fresh review in The Irish Times Film Section and selected \\"Films of the Week\\" in The Sunday Times. Maeve Murphy and Patrick Bergin appeared on Breakfast TV on TV3 for the debut broadcast at prime time.Patrick Bergin and Maeve Murphy talk 'Silent Grace' TV3 Group Ratings were good.

South Korea has state-funded mental health services, the majority of which are inpatient hospital facilities, but they are largely underfunded and underutilized. Despite the prevalence of mental illness, social stigma remains prevalent throughout the South Korean population, which discourages sufferers from seeking treatment. Mental illness, while present across all demographic groups, is most common among the elderly and adolescents in South Korea.  History  Western medicine was first introduced to South Korea by missionary doctors, and led to the transition of mental healthcare from shamanistic healers and traditional Korean medicine to mental hospitals sponsored by the Japanese government, which was occupying Korea, by 1910. Missionary hospitals, which tended to be more humane, also existed, but the isolation of patients by government mental hospitals contributed to the development of stigma in Korean society. Recently, the basis of mental healthcare in South Korea has shifted from long-term hospital stays to community-based healthcare, but the length of admission of those staying in mental hospitals is on an upward trend. This calls into question the effectiveness of South Korean health infrastructure, as the average length of stay in other OECD countries was less than a quarter of that in South Korea in 2011. Some experts question how well treatment methods in South Korean mental hospitals are working compared to that of other OECD countries.  Societal perceptions of mental illness  South Koreans have been found to have comparatively higher levels of internalized stigma, which relates to higher rates of mental illness and more severe symptoms. Seeking treatment for mental health conditions is largely frowned upon in Korean culture, with reports stating that only seven percent of those affected by mental illness seek psychiatric help. As a culture heavily influenced by Confucianism, the honor of the family is prioritized over the individual, leading Koreans to forgo treatment to preserve their family's face. It is also said by Korean doctors that Confucian culture emphasizes individual will and self-discipline which creates a social prejudice against mental health. Those who turn to therapy often pay out-of-pocket and in cash to avoid the stigma associated with mental health services on one's insurance record. Stigma also hinders the ability of those recovering from mental illness to reintegrate into society.  Mental healthcare  South Korean law prohibits workplace discrimination based on mental health conditions, but discrimination persists due to the lack of enforcement of such legislation. Psychiatrists and other mental health professionals are well-trained and numerous, but mental healthcare remains isolated from primary care, still a major contributor to South Korea's strong stigma against mental healthcare. Mental health medication is widely available, and almost all medications available to patients in the West are available in South Korea. The universal health coverage as provided by the state means that the majority of South Koreans can afford medicine and treatment for mental illness, but stigma often discourages people from utilizing their health coverage. Public spending on mental healthcare remains low, at 3%, most of which goes to inpatient mental hospitals despite the fact that most people receive treatment from outpatient facilities. As of 2005, the Korean government did not officially allot any funds towards mental healthcare in the national budget. The South Korean government passed the Mental Health Act in 1995. The Mental Health Act expanded the number of national mental hospitals and community mental health centers with the goal of making mental healthcare more accessible to communities. However, the act also made involuntary hospitalizations significantly easier. In 2017, the Mental Health Act was amended to protect the individual rights and liberties of those admitted to inpatient mental hospitals. The 1999 Medical Protection Act and Welfare Law for the Handicapped protect the rights of disabled persons, and the mentally ill have qualified for protection under these laws since 2000.  Mental illness   Contributing factors  Economic hardship during the late 1990s led to a sharp increase in mental illness and suicide in South Korea, as well as almost all other Asian countries that the economic depression affected. Social stigma within the South Korean population likewise discourages people from initially seeking treatment, exacerbating the severity of mental illness. Cultural factors other than stigma, such as binge-drinking, may also contribute to mental health issues within South Korean society. Due to Korea’s societal, academic and corporate structure, Koreans are placed under substantial stress from a relatively young age. South Koreans are known for their intelligence and incredible work ethic; these qualities contribute significantly to the economy but also place the people who drive the economy under immense pressure. Korean children and adolescents are placed in an education system that has a relentless focus on intellectual excellence, with anything less than such considered unacceptable. Suicide is the leading cause of death for adolescent Koreans, making suicide a suffocating reality in school systems. Korean students face not only academic pressure, but also the common stressors that the average student faces in any school setting. Social exclusion is a contributing factor to depression amongst Koreans aged from 10-19. In school systems children are victimized for their economic status or for other trivial reasons. Korean students are encouraged to excel above their peers which encourages a competitive environment welcoming hostility amongst peers. Korean students who have been bullied are said to have lower tests scores, lower self-esteem and increased levels of anxiety, making them more likely to become victims of depression.  Depression  In 2001, between 3 and 4.2 percent of the South Korean population was estimated to have major depressive disorder as outlined in the DSM-IV, a number which has been increasing. Women, smokers, shift workers, those with poor health, those who exercise in the evenings, those who perceive their lives to be stressful, and those that were underweight were more likely to have major depressive disorder. Depression is estimated to cost over $4 billion USD in the South Korean economy, with morbidity costs taking up the greatest proportion of that value. Increasing attention to the treatment and prevention of depression would affect economic growth as well as public health.  Alcohol use disorder  Compared to the United States and other East Asian countries, alcohol use disorder is more prevalent in Korea, and treatment is four times less likely to be sought out in Korea. The 2009 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey found that less than 2% of those with alcohol use disorder had received any form of treatment or intervention by a professional. Kye-Song Lee found in a 2013 study that nearly 7% of South Koreans have alcohol use disorder, the highest rate of any country in the world. South Koreans drink more alcohol by volume per capita than the residents of any other country in the world, consuming twice as much alcohol and 1.5 times as much hard alcohol per person as Russians, the next highest consumers. The prevalence of alcohol use disorder is increased by the expectation of businesspeople to engage in heavy drinking with their colleagues after work. In addition to being seen as a method of bonding with friends and colleagues, drinking alcohol is also viewed as a method of stress-relief. However, alcoholism is associated with violent crime in South Korea, with about 2 out of every 5 violent crime cases perpetrated by someone under the influence of alcohol.  Other mental illness  Maeng-Je Cho et al. found that over one- third of the South Korean population has had a mental disorder at any point in their lives, and over one-fifth have experienced a disorder in the past year. 17% of the South Korean population has insomnia, which is a rate comparable to that of insomnia in the United States. 6.6% of Koreans have nicotine dependence disorder, 2% have a mood disorder, and 5.2% have an anxiety disorder, all of which are less frequent among Koreans than among Americans. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is especially prevalent among refugees from North Korea living in South Korea. In a 2005 study, Jeon et al. found that 29.5% of North Korean refugees in South Korea were found to suffer from PTSD. A higher rate was found among female refugees than male refugees.  Demographics of mental illness  = Mental illness in the elderly = Between 17.8 and 27.9 percent of those aged 65 or older in South Korea are likely to suffer from depression, significantly higher than the rate in other countries. Factors associated with late life depression in Korea include illiteracy, living alone, poverty, low education, smoking, head trauma, and intellectual disability. The high rate of depression among Korean elders may be a result of the rapidly aging population and the dissolution of the tradition of children caring for their aging parents. Government social services for the elderly, such as the Law of Elderly Welfare, are inadequate to provide for the growing population's needs, contributing to mental illness within the demographic. Among a sample of elderly Koreans living in the United States, 34% were found to have depression, less than a fifth of which had ever seen a mental health professional. The majority of older Koreans living in the United States exhibited a negative perception of mental health services. = Mental illness in adolescents = More than 10% of Seoul adolescents have been found at high risk for internet addiction disorder. Internet addiction is positively correlated with family factors including child abuse and a harsh parenting style. Depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder are both correlated with internet addiction among adolescents. The 2009 study named, Addictive Internet Use among Korean Adolescents:A National Survey, found that a reason why internet addiction disorder is so prominent in Seoul adolescents, is due to a large number or students using the internet primarily for online gaming. In middle school males, 67.0% listed online gaming as their primary use of the internet. High school males listed online gaming as their primary use of the internet at 44.8%. When females of the same age are taken into account, 23% listed their primary use for blogging/ updating personal homepages. High school females listed searching information at 23.9% as their primary use of the internet. A reason why males are more exposed to internet addiction disorder is the idea of internet shops called PC bangs, where the common customers are male from mid teens to late twenties. Hyun-Sook Park et al. have found a gender difference in predictors of suicide ideation among Korean youth; with the main predictors for females being bullying, sexual orientation, depression, low self-esteem, and hostility; and the primary predictors for males being history of suicide attempt, parental alcohol abuse, smoking, hostility, and low self-esteem. Besides the elderly, adolescents have the highest suicide rate in South Korea and adolescents had the highest proportional increase in suicide rate between 1986 and 2005.  Suicide  In 2013, the suicide rate in South Korea was 29.1 per 100,000, a decrease from 33.3 per 100,000 in 2011. This rate is more than twice the OECD average. Between 2000 and 2011, South Korea's suicide rate more than doubled, contrary to the international trend of a steadily decreasing suicide rate. This rise in suicides is potentially linked to the economic wellbeing of South Koreans, as suicides have historically been higher during times of economic strife. The increase in suicides has been most significant among women, adolescents, and the elderly.

The company was founded in Yakutsk in 2012. It is one of the fastest growing international passenger transport service operating on the Real-Time Deals model. In inDriver app all conditions of the trip are determined as a result of an agreement between passengers and drivers. inDriver works both in small towns with a population of 10 thousand inhabitants, often with the weak Internet and without maps of the settlement, and in the largest cities with the highest level of competition, successfully adapting to the needs of the residents of any settlement. The p2p business model of the service today meets the needs of people who are trying to get away from the dictates of price corporations while using the capabilities of IT technologies makes the passenger-driver relationship much more transparent. The demand for such a model is great in many parts of the world According to OZY, the fees that inDriver takes from drivers' receipts averages 5–8% of the fare, which is significantly less than other major ride-hailing services. Passengers make all payments for rides directly to drivers in cash or non-cash settlements. This helps make fare for rides with inDriver even lower. The inDriver mobile app is available on Android and iOS. History On 2012 New Year's Eve in Yakutsk, in Eastern Siberia, the air temperature dropped below -45 degrees, and local taxi drivers simultaneously doubled the cost of trips around the city. In response, the inhabitants of Yakutsk made the \\"Independent Drivers\\" group on social networks, where people could post a request for a ride and put the price they are willing to pay, and then drivers took such orders. As a result, in just six months more than 60 thousand people joined the group. In 2013, Sinet started developing a stand-alone mobile application, called inDriver, which was based on the concept of the real time deals (RTD). In 2014, the company expanded regionally, launching in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk in January and in Vladivostok in April. The first international launch took place in December in Astana, Kazakhstan. In July 2014 InDriver made freight and inter-city services available within the app using the same business model. In February 2017 the service passed the threshold of 100,000,000 rides booked through the InDriver mobile app. Registered users comprised more than 5 million people at the time. In the summer of 2017 Russian venture capital fund LETA Capital committed to a $5 million investment in inDriver, followed by $10 million investment round in 2018. The company plans to use this investment to launch its service in USA and Canada. During 2017-2018 winter season, the service increased its network from 70 to 120 cities in Russia and CIS countries, and the total turnover from completed trips for 2018 exceeded the equivalent of $300 million.

It is one of the few pre-industrial sites still visible in the region.\\"La verrerie en noir de Trinquetaille à la fin du XVIII e siècle\\" par Danielle Foy et Henri Amouric in Archéologie du midi médiéval, 1984 (French) The factory has produced glass jugs, such as Dame jeanne. The Verrerie was only in operation for about twenty years as the Revolution and then the continental blockade made the cost of producing the glass prohibitive.Arles Patrimoine (French)  History  During the first half of the 18th century, a white glass factory was installed in the Cavalerie district. Transferred to Trinquetaille, it was in operation for 6 years and was forced to close because the fuel (wood) is rare in the region, resulting in extra cost.  Successive owners  In 1782, a Norman glassmaker associated with two Arlesians: a merchant and a lawyer settled on the site, using existing buildings and creating new ones. This glassmaker chooses his installation in the region, for the use of local resources: sand of the Rhône and soda of the Camargue. The rental lease, with the owner of the premises, Mr. Datty, was signed on February 3, 1781, but the town council of the city of Arles gave its agreement of installation, only a year later, March 10, 1782 In the following week, the company \\"Grigniard et Cie\\" is definitively created for the management of glassware, a 9-year lease is confirmed with the owner. In spite of this contract, Mr. Datty sought to have the lease destroyed in 1785. After several months of legal attempts, he finally sold the land and buildings to the managing company for 11,000 livres. In 1791, the three partners have not yet repaid their debts. The factory then passed into the hands of four Arlesian bourgeois. In 1791, only one owner owned the factory, Joseph Yvaren. Grignard and Boulouvard, two of the four Arlesian associates are arrested as royalists and guillotines on the Canebière. In 1799, its activity stopped definitively: The unfavorable conjuncture (continental blockade, superimposition, revolutionary crisis) made its situation fragile. The cost of transporting coal prevented it from remaining competitive. The glass industry is held by the owners of mining sites. Following the destruction of the parish church of St Pierre de Trinquetaille during the Second World War, the large hall would have served as a church.  Current situation  In 1979, the city bought the site that served as a squat. The municipality Perrot wanted to raze the buildings except the large hall to build housing. In 1982, archaeological finds testifying to antique luxurious habitat were discovered. In 1987, the main hall was classified as a historic monument as of 11 December 1987. The other buildings were listed under Historic Monuments on the same date. In 1996, the building corresponding to the workers' quarters welcomes the new town hall annex. In 2014, a project of development is envisaged by the City council. In 2016, the roof consolidation works are implemented.  Functioning of the Verrerie  Great hall of the glassworks of Trinquetaille This factory operated day and night (25 fonts per month), 6 to 7 months a year because in Provence operating a glassworks for the manufacture of 600 bottles per day was forbidden in summer. 40 people were housed on site. Here are the different trades that could be found there: *the \\"kids\\" who go to get the sand (at the Île des Sables) and pick the glass (4), *the blowing workers, *the \\"big boys\\" who blow the glass coarsely (4), *the master glassmaker who applied the finishing touches to the work, *furnace operators (4), *the site manager, *the bottle carriers(4), *shopkeepers (3), *the moulder, *the sifters (4 at least) Making crucibles: *a potter *a man who walked the earth *a lampworker  The production  This black glass (bottle glass) factory made from sand and soda (produced from the salicornia in the Camargue) produced ordinary bottles or \\"pints of Paris\\" (1/3), bordelaises (1/3 ) and 1/3 of very diverse products: oil bottles, English bottles, jugs, \\"lajeesjeannes\\", carafes. These containers thus produced are then transported by the Rhone, empty. A collection was organized before the annual opening of the factory to collect the \\"leached\\" ash and the broken glass of the households of Arles and its surroundings. The coal imported from Rives de Giers (Loire) was used as fuel (1440 tons in 1785). This production was then exported. For example, in 1793, out of 313,500 pieces, 96,000 were sold to the store, 73,000 in Genoa, 55,000 in Nice, 54,000 in Marseille, 34,000 in Sète and 15,000 in Toulouse. It is assumed that some of these pieces were exported to the Americas, the principal outlet for the glass-works of Provence.  Architecture  The glassworks of Trinquetaille is made up of an initial hall, augmented by a building built between 1782 and 1785. The buildings are built of stone (stone of Beaucaire) and stone coated with lime. Building A is present before the large hall (building E) built in 1783 on a basilical plane sheltering two corridors of air circulation perpendicular around a central melting furnace. There were several annealing furnaces and crucibles.

His work has also encompassed Hollywood film scores and West End musicals. Newman died on August 10, 2020. Early life Newman was born Derrick Martin Morrow in London. His father was a doctor of West African descent, and his mother was an Irish nurse. He was adopted by the Newman family when he was a few months old. At the age of seven, he began learning to play the cello and the piano. After serving with the Royal Navy, he studied music at university in Exeter and London and then at Trinity College of Music, where he chose to specialise in musical composition and conducting.

History  The concept of marching units was used throughout the 19th and 20th centuries in the French Army and its associated military systems. Under the First French Empire, the designation of Provisional Regiment was used to identify a regiment created by levies from different regular units, or from garrison troops. In the 20th century however only the term regiment de marche continued to be used.  Early Unites de marche of the French Army  The first marching regiments appeared during the Napoleonic Wars. The Spanish War () saw heavy casualties amongst the regular French units involved and in 1808 Napoleon INapoléon Bonaparte, Correspondance de Napoléon Ier – 1808 , p. 473, Imprimerie impériale, Paris, 1864 authorised the creation of marching regiments to replace these losses. Napoleon I designated \\"provisional regiments\\" for specific assignments as well as \\"marching regiments\\" intended for deployment outside France. These ad hoc units might also be used to bring metropolitan garrisons up to strength. It was in 1812, during the Russian Campaign (), that the concept of marching regiments became general. As examples: * On 29 February 1812, a provisionary regiment (later redesigned as a marching regiment) of hussarss () was formed in Toulouse and at Foix from the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 10th Hussar RegimentsNapoléon Bonaparte, Correspondance de Napoléon Ier – 1812, Imprimerie imperial, Paris, year 1864, passage 260, 409, 447, 502; * On 8 May 1812 the 1st Marching Regiment of Paris was created. It was deployed towards Erfurt () and subsequently Berlin () where the regiment was dissolved on 16 June; * On 28 May 1812, a Cavalry Marching Regiment of 1000 men was raised, recruited from the depots of the French Army in Spain. Brought together in Bayonne () the new units was deployed in Russia; * On 2 September 1812, Napoleon ordered a column to be created consisting of the \\"Infantry Marching Regiment of the 3rd Corps\\", the Cavalry Marching Regiment', the 5th Marching Cavalry, and the 6th Marching Cavalry. It participated in the Battle of Borodino (). During the retreat from Moscow, marching regiments were constituted to bring back scattered detachments from fragmented corps to their respective units of origin. Étienne Alexandre Bardin, Nicolas Charles Victor, Oudinot de Reggio; title: Dictionnaire de l'armée de terre, tome VII; editor Perrotin, Paris, year 1841, passage 4669.  Spanish expedition and siege of Algiers  During the Spanish Expedition () in April 1832, a number of depot units were sent to Spain under the designation of Provisionary Regiments Later, during the expedition of 1830 and the siege of Algiers (), Marching Regiments were created and embarked. Général Étienne Alexandre Bardin () explained in his Dictionary of the French Army that these marching regiments were used because the under strength light infantry units could only provide two formed battalions of veteran chasseurs. During this period, opinions differed in respect of the effectiveness of employing marching regiments. The administrator Pierre Agathange Audier recommended the practice in his \\"Study course of military administration\\" published in 1824. However, Général Étienne Alexandre Bardin expressed the contrary view that \\"If in the course of a major war and during distant operations we are forced to resort to this method of reinforcing the army, the practice is administratively deplorable\\".  Overseas and foreign campaigns of the Second French Empire  French Chasseurs d'Afrique during the Battle of Balaclava () in 1854. Expeditions undertaken in Algeria, Russia, Mexico and Italy during the Second French Empire made use of marching regiments.  Crimean War  Marching regiments drawn from units of the French Army of Africa were engaged from 1854 to 1856 in the Crimean War.  French intervention in Mexico  The French expeditionary corps which disembarked in Mexico () on 8 January 1862 consisted initially of the 1st Marching Regiment plus 2,000 men of the 1st Marine Infantry Regiment (1erRIMa) and the 2nd Marine Infantry Regiment (2e RIMa). The same year, reinforcements were received from the 2nd Marching Cavalry Regiment (Lieutenant-Colonel Jean-Auguste Margueritte), which was composed of two squadrons drawn from the 12th Chasseurs à Cheval Regiment plus two squadrons taken from the 3rd African Chasseurs Regiment\\".  Franco-German war of 1870  The disaster of the Franco-Prussian War () led the French to create in urgency numerous marching regiments. = End of the Second French Empire = The 13th Army Corps () (général Vinoy () was formed in August 1870 at Paris. The Marching Regiments of this corps were constituted of three depot battalions belonging to different regiments with recruits or recalled veteran soldiersLieutenant-colonel Léonce Rousset, Histoire générale de la guerre franco-allemande (1870–1871), Librairie Illustrée, Paris, year 1900, tome I through VI. * The 5th Marching Regiment () (colonel Hanrion) and the 6th Marching Regiment () (lieutenant-colonel du Guiny) with two marching chasseurs companies formed the 1st Brigade of général Mattat.

With three batteries de 4 and one engineer company, these two brigades constituted the 3rd Infantry Division of général Blanchard (). = Beginning of the Third French Republic = Fort (), assuring the defense of Paris in 1870 ().  Siege of Paris  Following the disaster of Sedan (), a national defense government () proclaimed on 4 September 1870 the Third French Republic and the decline of Emperor Napoleon III (). The 14th Army Corps (général Renault ()) was formed accordingly in the entrenched camp of Paris. The battalions in depot had already deployed, and the only available units left were a company of each deployed regiment, in charge of receiving soldiers recalled for service. Accordingly, the available companies were doubled. These demi-companies were supposed to form the regiment of the 14th Corps. Each new regiment accordingly consisted of eighteen different company corps. * The 15th Marching Regiment () (lieutenant-colonel Benedetti) and the 16th Marching Regiment () (lieutenant-colonel Guadel) with two chasseurs companies à pied formed the 1st Marching Brigade of général Ladreit de la Charrière () which was killed on 2 December 1870 during the defense of Paris. * The 17th Marching Regiment () (lieutenant-colonel Sermensan) and the 18th Marching Regiment () formed the 2nd Brigade of général Lecomte ().

World War I  Marching Regiment of the Foreign Legion RMLE, in November 1918, at Nancy. Less than a year from the beginning of first world war, the government decided on 25 January 1912, to constitute 40 Marching Battalions, as in 2 Marching Battalion by military region. They were formed of new recruits, reserve soldiers in the depot of garrisons and the wounded medically refit for service. Marching Regiments were equally created from the troupes d'Afrique (), such as the 4th Marching Tirailleurs Regiment. The 1st Foreign Regiment 1er RE of Sidi Bel-Abbès and the 2nd Foreign Regiment 2e RE of Saida, garrisoned in Algeria, mounted four demi-battalions destined constitute the principal formations of the future regiments: * The 2nd Marching Regiment of the 2nd Foreign Regiment, (), 2eR.M.2eR.E (1914 – 1915). * The 2nd Marching Regiment of the 1st Foreign Regiment, (), 2eR.M.1erR.E (1914 – 1915). * The 3rd Marching Regiment of the 1st Foreign Regiment, (), 3eR.M.1erR.E (1914 – 1915). * The 4th Marching Regiment of the 1st Foreign Regiment, (), 4eR.M.1erR.E (1914–1915). The Marching Regiment of the Foreign Legion (RMLE) was created on 11 November 1915 by fusion of the 2nd Marching Regiment of the 1st Foreign Regiment (2eRM 1erRE) and the 2nd Marching Regiment of the 2nd Foreign Regiment (2eRM 2e RE). The Marching Regiment participated to Battle of the Somme () in 1916 and to Second Battle of the Marne () in 1918. Whilst the Foreign Legion's battailons de marche are the most renowned in WW1, other troop types were similarly grouped, such as the 1er Régiment de Marche d’Infanterie Colonial du Maroc associated with the Moroccan Division (France). In Palestine, the Détachement Français de Palestine et de Syrie comprised such a regiment of Tirailleurs Algériens and of Armenian volunteers in the Légion d'Orient. The first Régiment de Marche d’Afrique was made up of two troop types of the Armée d'Afrique, its first two battalions formed of Zouaves and its third of Foreign Legionnaires. The second regiment was formed solely of Zouaves. Both units were in the Corps expéditionnaire d'Orient and saw combat in the Gallipoli campaign.  World War II  On the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, a Marching Regiment was constituted from the three battalions of the 146th Fortress Infantry Regiment (), the 156th Fortress Infantry Regiment (), and the 160th Fortress Infantry Regiment (), to participate in the Saar Offensive (). This Marching Regiment penetrated Germany through the woods of Warndt, then received an order to retreat following the capitulation of Poland. At the same time, Marching Regiments of the French Foreign Legion were constituted to gather foreigners wishing to serve in the French Army. Accordingly, 5,000 Ukrainian volunteers who did not want to serve in either the Polish or Soviet forces, enlisted in the 21st, 22nd and 23rd Marching Regiments of Foreign Volunteers (RMVE). Following the Armistice of 22 June 1940 (), the African units which rallied to Free France () were organized by général de Gaulle in Marching Battalions principally in the 1st Free French Division (). The 1st Marching Regiment of Moroccan Spahis (), created on 24 September 1942, was the first Marching Regiment of Free France. The Marching Regiment of Tchad, created in July 1943 from the Senegalese Tirailleurs of Tchad, was the first Regiment of Free France, and illustrated capability at Kufra () until Germany. Due to these Faits d'armes, this regiment was the only marching regiment which was not dissolved after the Liberation and which still is active under the respective designation. From 1 July 1943 until 1 July 1945, the 3rd Foreign Infantry Regiment 3e REI had been designated as Marching Regiment of the Foreign Legion (RMLE) which was the original designation for the latter from 15 November 1915 until 15 November 1920.  First Indochina War  In May 1945, the French Foreign Legion started the creation of a régiment de marche to be sent to re-occupy Indochina; their training and administrative base at Sidi-bel-Abbès, sixty miles south of Oran in northwest Algeria. During the Indochina war, the Legion's strength would reach 30,000 men.  Other armies Marching Units   Austria-Hungary  The Austro-Hungarian Army made use of marching units during World War I. The Marching Battalions were regrouped in Marching Regiments, and two marching regiments formed the Marching Brigade.  Germany  = Grand Duchy of Baden = In 1808 the Grand Duchy of Baden, created in 1806 under the impulsion of Napoleon I, contributed a combined infantry regiment for service alongside the French in the Peninsular War. In 1809 it became the Linien-Infantry-Regiment N°4. = Electorate of Bavaria = During the Battle of Hohenlinden in December 1800 the Bavarian Corps, serving alongside the Austro-Hungarian Army against the French, had a Combined Light Horse Regiment consisting of six squadrons. Such was one of the first appearances of this type of regiment. = Kingdom of Prussia = Revue of the Grand-Maneuvers of Kalisch which united in 1835, Combined Regiments of the Kingdom of Prussia and the Russian Empire. In 1812, the auxiliary corps of the Kingdom of Prussia was essentially formed of combined regiments composed of battalions or squadrons issued from the different regiments. Once peace prevailed again, Prussia continued deploying combined regiments during grand maneuvers. Accordingly, during the grand maneuvers of Kalisch, which took place during the summer of 1835 the Russian and Prussian Army, the latter having contributed two combined cavalry regiment and a combined infantry regiment. Journal des sciences militaires, 2e série, tome XIV, J.Corréard, Corréard Jeune, Paris, 1836, passage 316–318 In 1859 and 1860 a new short- lived form of combined regiments was created. Those were Landwehr regiments augmented by mobilized reserve troops and reserve formations, named \\"Combined Infantry Regiment\\". In 1860 they were converted into regular infantry regiments. = German Empire = During World War I the German Imperial Army formed marching regiments from various incomplete units and detached elements; like the 79.R/85.L which was formed with the staff and four companies of the 79th Reserve Infantry Regiment and two battalions of the 85th Landwehr Regiment. = German Reich = During World War II the Wehrmacht used the term Kampfgruppe for ad hoc formations; usually with combined arms and anywhere from companies to a full corps in size.  Russia  In October 1813, during the Battle of Leipzig, the Russian reserve Army of Poland commanded by Levin August von Bennigsen consisted of 2nd Combined Regiments of Uhlan comprising four squadrons. In the years of 1830, the Imperial Russian Army had taken the habit of creating Combined Regiments, formed of various regular units, to participate to grand-maneuvers. During the Grand-Maneuvers of Kalisch, which united in 1835 the Prussian Army and Russia Army, Russian Imperial Guard placed in lieu a combined cavalry regiment and a combined infantry regiment.

It was built during 1929. It is also known as the General Insurance Office Building; the GIO building, and was constructed as the Sun Building or the Sun Newspaper Building. The property is privately owned and was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. The GIO building was built in the Interwar Skyscraper Gothic style. History  Aboriginal occupation  It is possible that the site of 60-70 Elizabeth Street was once used by Aboriginals living in the area of what is now the City of Sydney. It is not known how many Aboriginals lived around Sydney at the time of the First Fleet in 1788, but several language groups are known to have occupied the area, the first of which to come into contact with Europeans being coastal members of the Dharruk group. Up to eleven small clan groups of around fifty people lived near Sydney Harbour. Although Governor Phillip harboured good intentions towards the Aborigines, widely disparate attitudes towards land ownership, the effects of disease (the Aboriginal population was decimated by an epidemic from around April 1789), and marginalisation caused a major decline in the numbers and cultural survival of Aboriginal people in Sydney.  The early owners of the site  The land on which 60-70 Elizabeth Street stands comprises sections of three early land grants made in Section 40 of the City of Sydney. It includes land from part of Allotment 7, granted to Jacob Josephson on 5 April 1836, part of Allotment 18 granted to Francis Wilde (or Wild) on 14 May 1836 and part of Allotment 8 granted to Joseph Roberts on 29 December 1842, although all were in occupation for a number of years beforehand. The major part of the site consists of that portion located on the part of Allotment 7, one of several adjoining parcels of land granted to Jacob Josephson. Josephson was a jeweller by profession, a Jewish Christian who reached Sydney in May 1818 as a result of being convicted of having forged bank notes in his possession. He died in the first half of the 1840s, and his son Joshua Frey Josephson inherited his property, including Enmore House, in 1945. Joseph Josephson was born in 1815 in Hamburg, and arrived with his mother in Sydney in 1820. He displayed great musical talent and was teaching music by 1834. On 17 February 1844 he became a solicitor, the same year in which he was elected to the Sydney City Council to represent Cook Ward. In 1848 he became Mayor of Sydney as well as a justice of the peace, and on 9 June 1855 he was admitted to the NSW Bar. The following year he travelled to England, entered Lincoln's Inn and was called to the Bar in April 1859. On his return to Sydney he practiced as a barrister and in 1862 became a land titles commissioner under the newly introduced Real Properties Act. During this decade he was a director of the Australian Joint Stock Bank and invested in pastoral and city land. In 1868 he became solicitor general, but resigned from parliament in 1869 after his appointment as a district court judge. Josephson resigned in 1884 to devote more time to his private affairs, and died in January 1892. Lot 7, however, remained in the possession of the Josephson family until the beginning of the 1920s. Lot 8 appears to have been occupied by one Richard Roberts from July 1829 onwards, and was not associated with Joseph Roberts and also William Henry Roberts until September 1842. It remained in the possession of members of the Roberts family until 1874, when title to it was conveyed to John Starkey. The land granted to Francis Wild in 1836 was hotly contested several years later by Bridge Jagon, who claimed to be his widow, and John and Mary Harper, who claimed to have been left the land in Wild's will. A ruling was made in favour of Mary Harper and it came into her possession at the beginning of 1851. The John Harper mortgaged the property to John Thomas Neale in December 1864, but about three years later it was sold to Jacob Christian Fischer, probably as a means of settling the payment of the mortgage. After Jacob Fischer died in August 1894 titled passed to his widow Jane, and on her death in December 1905 to her son George. On 1 July 1908 it was then conveyed from George Fischer to Sir Matthew Harris. Harris (1841-1917) was the great nephew of John Harris of Ultimo. He acquired a large amount of real estate, partly through inheritance, and between 1881 and 1900 he represented the Ward of Denison on the Sydney Municipal Council, and Sydney-Denison in the Legislative Assembly between 1894 and 1901. Harris served as Mayor of Sydney between 1898 and 1900. He later became president of Sydney Hospital was a vice president of the Royal Agricultural Society and president of the Wentworth Park Trust. In all probability Harris purchased the property as an investment. The property remained in the possession of the Harris family until 1927, when it was then sold to Sun Newspapers Limited.  Early development on the site  By 1835 the land granted to Francis Wild and William Roberts was substantially developed but Josephson's more substantial adjoining lot was relatively empty, containing only four detached, domestically scaled buildings along Phillip Street. However, by the second half of the 1830s the section of Elizabeth Street between Hunter and King Streets was \\"bounded on both sides ... by a series of irregular-built private dwellings - some of them having, however, a respectable appearance; but the principal buildings are towards the south end of the section, near which, a very handsome enclosed series of Chambers, for the use of the legal profession, have been erected; communicating with Elizabeth and Phillip Street, and being in the immediate vicinity of the Supreme Court House, they are found to be very convenient by the gentlemen of the law ...\\" Already the legal profession was congregating in this part of Sydney. Phillip Street, by contrast, was relatively undeveloped. By 1842 Wentworth Chambers, the future site of 60-70 Elizabeth Street and possibly the \\"handsome enclosed series of Chambers\\" previously mentioned, had been erected on part of Josephson's grant. At the end of the 1840s the character of Elizabeth Street had undergone substantial change. The section between Hunter and King Streets showed that \\"with few exceptions the whole of the buildings are of modern construction, and being situated in the vicinity of the Supreme Court, are principally occupied as Chambers by the Barristers, and other members of the Legal Profession\\". Wentworth Chambers consisted of two single storeyed gabled buildings with an open passage running between them. Josephson appears to have lived or operated chambers on the opposite side of the street at the same period. Joseph Josephson's land was brought under the provisions of the Real Property Act in February 1863 by his son. It was one of the earliest properties in NSW to have been brought under these provisions, and at the time much of it was occupied by a number of houses that fronted Elizabeth and Phillip Street. A Certificate of Title dated 30 September 1873 confirms that Joshua Josephson was the owner of the land. Wentworth Court, or Place as it was termed, was occupied by \\"weekly tenants\\" in the middle of the 1870s. By the first half of the 1880s the building was known as Wentworth Court and contained a ground floor and two upper levels. It was considered to be sufficiently important in the middle of this decade to warrant separate listing in Sands Sydney and suburban directory. Its mixed tenants included artists, merchants, watchmakers, surveyors, and most of all, solicitors and barristers. A photograph of the building taken in May 1926, shortly before it was demolished, shows its Elizabeth Street facade to have been a restrained three storey building with a high parapet and a simple tripartite fenestration pattern. At the same time, the Phillip Street facade was more elaborate in its decorative treatment and punctuated by arched openings, in addition to being a storey taller. The title of the land was transferred to Sydney Arthur Josephson and William Edward Wilson as joint tenants. Title to the land was transferred from Josephson and Wilson to Sun Newspapers Ltd in stages, from May 1920 to February 1921. The site was then consolidated when Sun Newspapers Ltd purchased a large amount of Lot 18 from the Harris Family during 1927. It has not been ascertain when the company purchased Lot 8 or part thereof.  Sun Newspapers  The Australian Newspaper Company was one of several that published newspapers in Sydney during the 1890s. Its Australian Star was one of only two afternoon tabloid newspapers published in Sydney during that decade. However, after 1901 the company began to run at a loss. In 1907 it started attempts to raise capital, and towards the end of 1908 it needed to raise capital to fund new plant and for other purposes. The chairman of the Company, Sir Robert Anderson, approached the managing director of the Associated Tobacco Companies, Sir Hugh Denison, for a loan to assist these funding requirements. Despite obtaining the loan, in a relatively short period of time the Australian Newspaper Company found itself contemplating the very real prospect of liquidation. One of its directors, Herbert Easton, induced Sir Hugh Denison to examine the company's position, and the result was that a consortium of a number of Sydney's businessmen formed a new company that was called the Sun Newspaper Company Limited. Two of the board of the Australian Newspaper Company served on the board of the new organisation, and a complete overhaul of its publications was made. The Australian Star remained in publication for a further three months, whilst the Sunday Sun was transformed into a daily paper, and the first issue of its successor, The Sun, was issued on 1 July 1910. Its editor, Montague Grover, aimed to provide the publication with something new: ...[h]e succeeded so well that many of his differences have since become the routine of up-to-date journalism. Prior to the advent of The Sun, Australian newspapers did not have front windows for the display of their best goods, but now most of them have followed the fashion of printing their leading news items on the front page. Sedater [sic] schools of journalism looked askance at many of Mr. Grover's \\"revolutionary\\" changes, but the public evinced a growing appetite for them. Crispness and brightness of presentation in all department of news was the aim. Circulation on the first day was double that of The Star, helped no doubt by promotional stunts such as motor boats bearing Sun posters speeding around the harbour and a chariot drawn by seven horses driven by a golden haired \\"Apollo\\" traversing Sydney's streets. The new newspaper turned out to be no less surprising, with news on the front page instead of the expected advertising and changes to the conventional layout of newspapers from that era. The sun was successful because, amongst other things, its publishers made great and innovative use of a cable service from overseas and gave a large amount of its space over to crime and human interest stories. Further increases in circulation meant that the premises occupied by the newspaper became inadequate, so land at the rear of the Castlereagh Street building, extending back to Elizabeth Street, was purchased and a new building was erected over the entire site. The building was completed towards the end of 1915. In 1918 Sun Newspapers Ltd took over the failing The Northern Times in Newcastle and changed its name to The Newcastle Sun, and erected a new four storey building in Hunter Street, Newcastle. This was designed by architect Joseph Kethel. During the second half of the 1920s the company expanded its interests still further. The Daily Telegraph Newspaper Co Ltd, which had been founded in 1879 and had erected a very large building at the corner of King and Castlereagh Streets between 1912 and 1916, found itself falling behind in this competitive era. A new company was set up to incorporate the Daily Telegraph Newspaper Co Ltd, with holding the controlling interests in it. In January 1921 Moore Street, which extended between Pitt and Castlereagh Streets beyond Martin Place, which only stretched between George and Pitt Streets, was renamed Martin Place as well. Evidently Sun Newspapers Ltd recognised that the extension would eventually take place, reflected by the purchase of the property between Elizabeth and Phillip Streets from Josephson and Wilson that concluded in February 1921. The building occupied by Sun Newspapers Ltd was located at the head of Martin Place and so right in the path of the proposed extension of the street through from Castlereagh Street to Macquarie Street. This had been suggested as far back as 1909 by a Royal Commission into the improvement of the City of Sydney. Architect Joseph Kethel lodged an application for a new building with the Sydney City Council on 18 January 1926, and the following May another application was lodged, this one for the demolition of Wentworth Court. However, two months later an application was ledged, this one for the demolition of Wentworth Court. However, two months later an application was lodged by the building contractors Stuart Bros for the excavation of the site and yet another application was lodged for demolition a few days after that. In the meantime, however, Sun Newspapers Ltd organised an architectural competition that was held in 1926, with six architects selected to submit entries, indicating that the newspaper was reconsidering its new premises. The entries were adjudicated by Professor Leslie Wilkinson, Chair of the School of Architecture at The University of Sydney, and Kingsley Henderson, a prominent architect from Melbourne whose practice designed many major office buildings throughout Australia during the 1920s and into the 1930s. \\"After adjudication had been carried out in the usual way, and the names of the competitors kept sealed until after the award had been made, by a remarkable coincidence the winner, Mr J Kethel, turned out to be the architect who had carried out the \\"Sun\\" Newspapers' work for many years past...\\" Kethel lodged a revised application for the new building on 27 July 1927. The structural engineer for the project was E. Leslie James.  Joseph Alexander kethel  Joseph Alexander Kethel was born on 31 January 1866. He was the second son of the Honourable Alexander Kethel, MLC, and was indentured into the practice of Thomas Rowe and Sydney Moore Green, architects, in 1887. A number of business premises located in Sydney were designed in Kethel's office. They included the building for Alliance Assurance Company at 97 Pitt Street (demolished), the London Assurance Building at 16-20 Bridge Street (demolished), major alterations to an office building at 16 Loftus Street, Sydney (, demolished) and numerous private residences and pastoral homesteads. The buildings included \\"Cavan\\" in the vicinity of Yass, \\"Chatsworth\\" at Potts Point (1922, demolished) and a residence at Leura, both for William Rhodes (demolished), ecclesiastical buildings such as the former Fuller Memorial Church in Surry Hills and theatres such as the Independent Theatre at North Sydney. Kethel held the position of Honorary Architect to the Royal Australian Historical Society. He died on 29 April 1946. Kethel was responsible for a number of earlier buildings for Sun Newspapers, so it is not surprising that he received the commission for 60-70 Elizabeth Street, for he designed the newspaper's earlier building in Castlereagh Street and its premises in Newcastle. He also designed a buildings for the publishers of Truth and Sportsman at 61-73 Kippax Street, Sydney.  The Sun building  The newly completed Sun Building, erected by the firm of Concrete Constructions Ltd, was officially opened on 15 October 1929 by the Governor of NSW, Sir Dudley de Chair. Was attended by a large number of dignitaries, including the Premier, Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, the President of the Legislative Council, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sydney and numerous others. The appearance of the building's exterior excited interest because it was an example of the newly popular \\"commercial Gothic\\" idiom that enjoyed a brief flowering in Sydney and other Australian cities in the second half of the 1920s and into the early 1930s. This aroused mixed feelings in some quarters. The editors of the influential architectural journal Building felt that: Some aspects of the building reflected peculiarities inherent in the height restrictions current at the time, and because of the fall across the site the building effectively ended up with two different roof levels. Towers on either side of the building served different functions. That on the Elizabeth Street side held aloft the gilded balloon representing the sun, whilst the tower on the Phillip Street side contained an observation platform. Below it, a cafeteria for the use of staff opened out onto the roof over the Elizabeth Street side of the building. Such staff amenities were relatively common parts of interwar office building design, but evidently not so common in other newspaper offices. A hospital located on the thirteenth floor was another facility provided for the benefit of the staff, as was a \\"mechanical suite where each departmental foreman has his own table, and mechanical toilets with enclosed showers, etc.\\" Further consideration was shown for the staff by the use of \\"Vita glass\\" in a number of the building's windows. This proprietary glass was claimed to allow the passage of ultra violet radiation, and so benefit those working behind it. Seven high speed lifts, travelling at the maximum permitted speed of 600 feet (182 metres) per minute were installed. This was amongst the largest lift installations in any Sydney office building during the interwar period. Some of the innovations to be found in the building included the largest mechanical ventilation system installed in any Australian building of the time, (no doubt due in part to there being three floors constructed below the level of Phillip Street) while the exhaust fan in the system was the largest that had yet been installed in any Australian building up to that time. The basement levels contained the printing machinery and heavy storage. The exterior of the building was clad in a rich variety of materials. The ground floor levels were finished with Uralla granite, with emerald pearl around the windows and red granite on the Elizabeth Street facade. Above these levels it was clad in Benedict Stone of a soft grey hue. Benedict stone, apparently named after the person who invented it, appears to have been introduced in America during the 1880s. It was manufactured in a straightforward fashion - selected stone was crushed into chips and dust, then washed and mixed with a special cement. It was then poured into moulds of the required configuration. The Sun Building was the first major project in Sydney, if not Australia, to make use of this material. The decorative potential of stone was exploited to enhance parts of the interior as well. The main entrance vestibule was ornamented in \\"richly coloured\\" Cudgegong marble, whilst the main entrance stair landings and mid landings were tiled with panels depicting Apollo, the Sun God. By contract, the rest of the interiors were considered to be quite plain. The newspaper took pride in the fact that \\"wherever possible\\" Australian materials, \\"in keeping with the national character of the paper\\" were used. One very unusual feature associated with the building was the two landscaped plots in front of the Elizabeth Street facade. A central path connected the main entry and the footpath along the street. The plots, protected by chains slung between posts, were enhanced by decorative pedestals amidst expanses of lawn and young trees. Regretfully they were to have a short life, as this section of Elizabeth Street was widened around 1934. Apart from the Sun Building there were a number of large buildings erected for the publishers of newspapers in Sydney during the second and third decades of the twentieth century. They included the Daily Telegraph Building at the corner of King and Castlereagh Streets (now known as the Trust Building), designed by the architectural firm of Robertson & Marks and completed in 1916, The Sydney Morning Herald building at the corner of Hunter and O'Connell Streets, designed by the architectural firm of Manson and Pickering and completed in 1929, and the Evening News Building designed by the architectural firm of Spain and Cosh and completed in 1926. =Subsequent history of Sun Newspapers Limited= On 1 October 1929 Sun Newspapers Ltd merged its interests with those of S. Bennett Ltd to form Associated Newspapers Limited, which was an operating as well as a holding company. The following January the new company purchased the Daily and Sunday Guardian from Smith's Newspapers Ltd and the remaining shares in Daily Telegraph Pictorial Ltd were purchased in February 1930. The directors of the company were forced to undertake some drastic measures as a result of the economic depression of the early 1930s and correspondingly reduced circulating revenue. As a result, the Evening News and Sunday Pictorial were discontinued, the Daily Guardian and Daily Pictorial were incorporated into a new newspaper called The Daily Telegraph, and the Sunday Guardian and Sunday Sun were incorporated into one newspaper. In this way the company published a morning, an evening and a Sunday newspaper. During 1936 the principal assets of S. Bennett Limited were sold to Consolidated Press Limited (of which Associated Newspapers was a shareholder), as was the goodwill of The Daily Telegraph. At this time Associated Newspapers were possessed of only one active subsidiary company in the form of Sun Newspapers Limited. It was decided to consolidate these interests and reduce operating expenses by amalgamating the two companies, and to this end Sun Newspapers was voluntarily liquidated on 29 March 1937. S. Bennett Limited was the next subsidiary to go, and was liquidated during 1938, whilst the Newcastle Sun was sold to the Newcastle Morning Herald and Miners' Advocate Pty Limited. On 26 January 1938, the company launched a \\"pioneer journey in Pictorial News in Australia\\", Pix. During 1939 and 1940 the company invested in new plant and machinery to allow for expanded circulation and business, whilst at the end of 1939 a subsidiary company, Wireless Newspapers Pty Limited, was placed into voluntary liquidation. Around this time the company was also acquiring shares in Australian Newspaper Mills Pty Limited. Its stable of publications included the Daily Sun, Woman, Sunday Sun, World's News, Pix, Wireless Weekly and Radio and Hobbies. By 1943 Wireless Weekly had been replaced by Pocket Book Weekly, and despite the strictures of paper rationing circulation figures exceeded previous years. In 1947 two new magazines were introduced - Sporting Life and Glamour - and in the second half of 1949 Sungravure Limited was formed to take over the company's rotogravure printing activities. At the Annual General Meeting of Associated Newspapers held at the end of 1953, W. O. Fairfax gave notice of his candidature for election to the Board. This followed on from negotiations with John Fairfax and Sons Pty Limited earlier in the year that were concluded by the issue of shares to that company, to assist Associated Newspapers in improving its financial position. John Fairfax and Sons were also given representation on its Board. In June 1955, 60-70 Elizabeth Street was sold to the Government Insurance Office, or GIO, at the time a controlled entity of the Government of New South Wales. Magazine and job printing rights were sold to Sungravure Limited, mirroring continued difficulties within the company. By the end of 1956 W. O. Fairfax had become Chairman of Directors whilst production and distribution of The Sun was transferred to John Fairfax & Son's Broadway premises. Employees were transferred to Sungravure and John Fairfax and Sons, which carried the bulk of newsprint requirements. In the second half of 1970 half of Sungravure Pty Limited was sold to the International Publishing Corporation, an overseas company that was the world's largest publisher of magazines. Associated Newspapers now only published The Sun and The Sun Herald. By 1974 the parent company was deriving a trading profit from the publication of The Sun and operated an interest of one-third in The Sun Herald. In a reversal of what had happened in 1970, on 21 April 1978 Associated Newspapers regained total ownership of Sungravure Pty Limited.  Subsequent history of the Sun building  Evidently Sun Newspapers Ltd foresaw the need to expand its new premises within the next decade, for its site was enlarged in October 1931 by the acquisition of a new title from the Sydney City Council of a part of the former Allotment 7, 68-70 Elizabeth Street. The Council of the City of Sydney had resumed this land the previous year, in August 1930. An application to demolish the buildings which stood on this land was made in November 1933. The site was expanded yet again by a new title in March 1936 from the addition of part of Lot 7 and part of Lot 8 in Section 40, purchased from the Council of the City of Sydney in November 1935. The Council had resumed the land in May 1935. During the second half of the 1930s architects Scott Green and Scott were responsible for the design and documentation of a series of alterations and additions to the building (refer to Appendix 3). In June 1936 Scott Green and Scott lodged an application to the building. In June 1936 Scott Green and Scott lodged an application for the enclosure of the northern lightwell in 1938, which was adjacent to the recently completed APA Building on Martin Place. Documentation describing major extensions to the building on the site of 68-70 Elizabeth Street was lodged in July 1938. This necessitated the demolition of a building called Dymocks Chambers on Elizabeth Street and Northfield Chambers (erected around 1888) at 163 Phillip Street. In June 1939 it was proposed to construct a floor across a lightwell on the fifth floor. The same architects were involved with the building continued after World War Two, but by this time was known as EA & TM Scott. They were responsible for the design and documentation associated with the construction of a mezzanine level between the sixth and seventh floors in 1946-47, a fan room on the western side of the roof of the extension and the construction of lavatory accommodation at the Phillip Street level. After ownership of the building was transferred to Associated Newspaper Ltd during the liquidation of Sun Newspapers in August 1939, from the next month part of the basement was leased by the Sydney City Council. Associated Newspapers Limited finally became proprietor of the land on 17 December 1953. The title was transferred from Associated Newspapers to the Government Insurance Office on 15 June 1955. The building was then extensively remodelled internally to suit the requirements of its new owners and many original finishes and fittings were swept away. The works were designed by the NSW Government Architect's Office and carried out by the NSW Public Works Department. At the same time extensive repairs and refitting of the steel framed windows took place, and the whole of the works were completed by the middle of 1957. Associated Newspapers tenanted a part of the building until February 1963. From 1959 onwards the building was subjected to numerous programs of alteration and modification, and for a number of years these were designed by the architectural firm of Morrow and Gordon. The modifications carried out under their direction affected a large part of the building. In 1959 the firm documented alterations to the main entrance off Phillip Street, partitions on the ninth floor and alterations to provide a car park, which included the construction of a series of ramps and \\"mezzanine\\" levels between the existing floor slabs. Between 1961 and 1964 their work included alterations to toilets and associated spaces, further alterations on the ninth floor, a covered way on the roof, a new tea room on the sixth floor, alterations on the seventh floor, and alterations to the \\"tank\\". In 1968 major upgrading of the mechanical ventilation system was documented and two years later plans were prepared for and alterations to the ground floor. Apart from Morrow and Gordon, there were other architects who were responsible for work to the building in this period. For instance, the Melbourne-based architect Guildford Bell designed facilities for Ansett Transport Industries in the basement and ground floor levels during 1959. The pace of change continued unabated during the 1970s and 1980s. Extensive alterations were carried out in 1970 and 1971, while alterations to Floors 7, 9, 10 and 11 took place in 1972. All were designed by architect R. B. Keers. In 1985 major alterations to the building, valued at $12 million, were documented by the architectural firm of Keers Banks and Maitland. This resulted in the removal of all the interior fabric excepting structural items from the ground levels upwards and installation of new services, lifts, stairs and toilet areas. New plant room accommodation was constructed at roof level, many windows were replaced and the introduction of retail tenancies on the ground floors resulted in modifications to the facades at street level. Since these extensive modifications were completed, there have been various alterations related to internal partitioning and changes in tenancies.  Description  The subject building is identified as occupying Lot 1 D.P. 87319 at 60-70 Elizabeth Street and 153-163 Phillip Street. It consists of a structural steel, reinforced concrete and masonry structure, and contains seven basement levels given over to car parking, a lower ground and ground floor level, and eleven upper floors. The building is accessed via entries on Elizabeth and Phillip Streets, whilst vehicular access is located on the southern end of the Elizabeth Street facade and the loading dock is situated on the Phillip Street side of the building. The exterior of the building was designed in what has become known as the Interwar Skyscraper Gothic style. There were relatively few buildings erected in this style in Australia, which showed the influence of American skyscraper design of the 1920s, the most notable example of which was Howells and Hood's Chicago Tribune Building of 1922-25. Indeed, this precedent was acknowledged in the Australian architectural press. The adaptation of Gothic embellishments and its inherent verticality was though appropriate as an expression of the height and vertical thrust of tall buildings in America during the 1920s. The major examples of this style of architecture in Sydney were designed and built between 1926 and 1930. The style effectively formed a bridge between the dominant Commercial Palazzo idiom of the 1920s and the Art Deco style of the late 1920s and 1930s - \\"... relatively few buildings were built in this style, but they provided potent images which had effects on the Art Deco style.\\" Its characteristics, a number of which appear in the facades of 60-70 Elizabeth Street, include concentrated \\"medieval\\" motifs and detailing concentrated at the base and parapet levels of the building, vertical expression achieved by the accentuation of window mullions, and \\"Gothic\\" towers above the level of the roof to form a landmark on the city skyline. 60-70 Elizabeth Street has strong visual associations with other interwar office buildings in this part of the city. They include the former APA Building to its immediate north at 53 Martin Place, the former State Savings Bank at 48-50 Martin Place and the former MLC Building at 42-46 Martin Place. As a group, the buildings provide a valuable demonstration of the ways in which architectural styles in tall office buildings evolved during the interwar period, and are evidence of the major changes that took place in this part of the city as a result of extending Martin Place to Macquarie Street. A Structure and Facade Review of the building was undertaken by Ove Arup & Partners for Rider Hunt Terotech, and is appended to this report. The building was also inspected by Roy Lumby on 8 September 1999.  External fabric  The exterior of 60-70 Elizabeth Street has retained much of its early configuration and a relatively large amount of early fabric. The configuration of its facades is characteristic of many office buildings erected during the interwar period, consisting of a polished stone base (the ground floor cladding) that is extended into the upper part of the building by means of decorative detailing, a relatively plain shaft of window bays and decorative detailing at the top of the building and parapets. The facades were originally symmetrical and arranged in a tripartite configuration broken into five bays of windows of unequal width, but this configuration has since been obscured by the additions that were erected during the latter part of the 1930s on the southern side of the building. Early metal framed windows still remain in place in the large arched openings above the ground floor levels on both facades, although a leadlight window above the Elizabeth Street entrance, visible in early photographs, has been removed. All other windows were replaced as part of the late 1980s works. The flat roofs are covered with a proprietary membrane system, identified by Rider Hunt Terotech as \\"butynol\\". The original awning that sheltered the ground floor level of the Phillip Street facade has been removed, although the brackets that held suspension cable off the facade are still in place. Other modifications to the exterior of the building include: installation of new shop fronts on both facades; erection of canopies above the Phillip Street entrance and above shop fronts on the Elizabeth Street facade; recently installed stone cladding along the ground floor level of the Phillip Street facade, insertion of grilles above the level of ground floor openings along the Phillip Street facade and the addition of large plant room spaces on the roof levels. Many of these alterations and additions were carried out during the 1980s. However, doors to the ground floor car part vestibule in Elizabeth Street may also be remnants of early building fabric. Some parts of the building are in defective condition. Theses have been identified by Ove Arup & Partners as follows: *Concrete is spalling off the stair structure and walls in a number of locations in the tower on the eastern side of the building, and corroding reinforcement has been exposed. There is also evidence of water penetration into the tower; *There are numerous cracks in the fire stairs, reflecting the joints between steel framing and masonry infill panels; *Cracking has occurred in the roof parapet at the southern end of level 11 and the top of the plant room wall at the southern end of the building above level 11, on its eastern and western sides; *The metal plant room roof has been damaged by pedestrian traffic across it, and screws fixing the roof sheeting have corroded, as have gutters associated with the roof. There has been some water penetration through the roof or from the guttering; *Some of the hold-down bolts of the handrails around the level 10 and 11 roofs have corroded; *There are a small number of locations where cement rendered surfaces are deteriorating and coming away; *Two steel framed windows in the tower at level 11 are corroding; *Staining has taken place on facade paintwork and on the reconstructed stone surfaces; *Fittings and mechanisms on the original windows at the lower levels of the building are broken or ineffective in operation. Several of the windows do not seal properly when closed; *Areas of dampness are evident in basement levels due to water penetration through perimeter walls, particularly in the northwestern and south western corners.  Internal fabric  Unlike the exterior of the building, virtually all of the building's interior were removed as part of the alterations that were carried out during the 1980s. The only early fabric remaining in the building is the former board room and an adjacent anteroom of the seventh floor. There is very little else left of the original building fabric apart from structural columns, floor slabs and concrete stairs in the roof towers. The ground floor levels contain retail tenancies and a large central circulation space that links Elizabeth and Phillip Streets. Wide stairs and an escalator accommodate the change in level. Finishes throughout date from the late 1980s and are dominated by the extensive use of light toned marble. Columns are faced with mirrored glass whilst ceilings are divided into recessed sections from which large light fixtures are suspended. Floor finishes consist of carpet surrounded by a marble margin. Generally the office levels reflect fitouts undertaken by the various tenants. For instance, the foyer on the fifth floor has an \\"Art Deco\\" theme, designed by the Department of Public works around 1996. Lift lobbies are also given some distinction according to tenant requirements such as the lobby on the tenth floor, which is finished with a panelled timber dado. However, the ceilings of the lift lobbies are uniform, with coved sides and a flush ceiling decorated with plaster mouldings in a \\"Gothic\\" motif similar to that found in the ceiling of the early board room on the seventh floor. The Board Room on the seventh floor presently forms part of the Attorney General's tenancy. It and the adjacent ante room are part of the building's early fabric. Kethel's 1927 drawings do not indicate a board room at this level nor does it appear in Scott, Green & Scott's 1938 documentation. It is quite possible that it was decided to locate the two rooms here whilst the building was under construction, or they may have been relocated from another level during the works carried out during the 1980s. Original fabric in these spaces includes timber wall panelling, timber parquet floor and a fireplace with a low panelled timber ceiling above it in the board room. The ceiling above the rest of the Board Room may also be original. The ante room has only retained early timber wall panelling, although earlier ceilings may be concealed above the existing suspended ceiling, and original flooring may be concealed beneath present coverings. Wall mounted light fixtures and other luminaires are recent fabric. The toilet areas throughout the building are fitted out with recently installed fabric, as are the lift cars. There are now five lifts, two fewer than when the building was first completed. The lift cars are lined in timber, with panelled timber ceilings. The building was constructed in 1929 to house the offices and printing presses of The Sun newspaper, an afternoon tabloid, which ran from 1910 until the 1980s. Sun Newspapers Limited occupied this site from 1929 until 1939. Joseph Kethel won the architectural competition top design the building. After the liquidation of Sun Newspapers in August 1939, the building was owned by Associated Newspapers Ltd. This building was the last of the great newspaper buildings to be built in the Sydney central business district, and the spectacular Skyscraper Gothic style confidently portrayed the commercial power of the media. The former Sun Building is one of only three in the city to be designed in this architectural style; with the other two being the Grace Hotel and the State Theatre.  Heritage listing  As at 27 August 2008, The GIO Building is historically significant because of its associations with Sun Newspapers Ltd newspaper publishing activities in Sydney during the first half of the twentieth century. Its site has associations with the historically prominent figure, Joshua Josephson. The building is aesthetically significant because it is possibly the first major Interwar Skyscraper Gothic style building in Sydney, of which it is also a rare example, and because it is a major building designed by architect Joseph Kethel. The building has technical significance, due to its early and extensive use of the proprietary building material, Benedict stone. It is possibly the first major application of this material in a large city building in NSW. GIO Building was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. 60-70 Elizabeth Street has important associations with Sun Newspapers Ltd, which did much to change the way in which newspapers were published in Sydney in the early part of the twentieth century, and with the subsequent publication of newspapers up until the mid twentieth century. It is one of a number of large buildings erected specifically for the use of newspaper publishing in the second and third decades of the twentieth century in the City of Sydney. However, evidence of this past use has been removed from much of the building's interior. The site has historical associations with the significant figure of Joshua Josephson, who was a prominent legal figure and for a time mayor of Sydney, as well as holding property interests in the city centre. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. 60-70 Elizabeth Street is an important work by the architect Joseph Kethel, who was responsible for the design of a number of buildings for newspaper publishers during the first third of the twentieth century and designed a wide range of other buildings. The building is a rare example of a large Interwar Skyscraper Gothic style building in the City of Sydney, with a relatively intact exterior. It was the first major example of this style to be erected in Sydney, and may be the first to have been erected in Australia. The building also contains a small amount of original internal fabric in the form of the boardroom on the seventh floor and the associated ante room. The building is an important part of the architectural fabric of the area around Martin Place, Elizabeth Street and Phillip Street and has strong visual relationship with the former APA Building and other major interwar office buildings in this locality. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The building is not considered to demonstrate any social significance. It does not appear to have any association with a contemporary community for social, spiritual or other reasons. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The exterior of the building has technical significance because it was the first time that a proprietary synthetic stone, Benedict stone, was employed as the cladding of a major building in Sydney.

He was one of the disciples of Fazlallah Na'imi, the founder of the Hurufism sect. Ahmed Lur also attempted to assassinate the Timurid ruler, Shahrukh Mirza. Though Shahrukh was injured in the altercation, the attack ultimately failed to kill him.  Biography  His hometown was in Luristan. The Timurid era historian Hafiz-i Abru mentioned Ahmed Lur as a commander of Ahmad Jalayir, the Jalayirid ruler of Iraq. Ahmed Lur was accompanied by Jalayirid sultan in his last military campaign in Azerbaijan. Jalayir was killed in this war. As a result, Ahmed Lur decided to go to Shirvan and finally he settled in Herat, the Timurid dynasty's capital city. Lur started weaving hats in a simple booth. Apparently, this occupation (weaving the hats) had a special sacred place among the followers of Hurufism. As Ahmed immediately communicated with the followers of the Hurufism sect after entering Herat, it seems likely that Ahmed was familiar with sect before going to Herat and perhaps even while in Azerbaijan. Efforts to kill Shahrukh  Sheykh Fazlallah Astarabadi, the founder of the Hurufism sect was killed by Miran Shah, son of Timur in 1393. As a result, a group of followers of Hurufism in the Timurid territory started revenge-seeking fights against the Timurid rulers. While he wearing a shepherd's coat, Ahmed attacked Shahrukh Mirza, the brother of Miran Shah on the pretext of delivering a letter of complaint in Herats main mosque. The king was badly injured by the knife attack but ultimately survived. Ahmed was killed by a friend of Shahrukh Mirza, Ali Sultan Qouchin in 1426. After this incident, Shahrukh's emirs used this opportunity to repress the followers of Hurufism, leading to many being killed and even burned. A well-known calligrapher at Shahrukh's court was accused of having been a friend of Ahmed and was sentenced to prison. These persecutions eventually reached the point where the famous Persian poet, Qasem-e Anvar was exiled to Samarqand due to his diwan being found in Ahmed Lur's booth.

The attack was carried out by members of the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) using the covername \\"People's Republican Army\\". Three Protestant civilians were killed in the bombing. Background A lot of members of the Official IRA (OIRA) were not happy with a ceasefire the group called in 1972 and in December 1974 the dissenters in the OIRA set up the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) and a political wing called the Irish Republican Socialist Party (IRSP). 1975 was one of the worst years of \\"The Troubles\\" for attacks with civilian casualties with Loyalist paramilitaries carrying out attacks including the Strand Bar Bombing, the Miami Showband killings and the attacks at Donnellys bar and Kays tavern. And Republican paramilitaries carrying out attacks including the Mountainview Tavern attack, the Bayardo Bar and the Tullyvallen Orange Hall massacre. All of these attacks saw high numbers of civilian deaths and injuries. On 15 December 1975 the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) killed Ronald Tranior a 17-year-old member of the IRSP after a bomb attack on his house in Ballyoran Park in Portadown.Jack Holland & Henry McDonald, INLA – Deadly Divisions, 1994, p.83 - 84 The bombing Henry MacDonald and Jack Holland said that it seemed the attack was in revenge for the killing of Trainor two weeks earlier. On 31 December (New Year's Eve) 1975 an INLA unit planted a time bomb in a duffel bag in the Central Bar pub in the mainly Protestant town of Gilford near Portadown. The bomb went off at around 21:00. The explosion killed three Protestant civilians, Richard Beattie (44), William Scott (28) and Sylvia McCullough (31) who died of her injuries the day after. Around 30 people were injured in the bombing and were taken to the Craigavon Area Hospital by ambulances. Conviction A 29-year-old Portadown INLA member Francis Corry was given 4 life sentences in December 1979 for the three Central Bar killings and for that of 14-year-old Portadown boy, Thomas Rafferty killed by a booby-trap bomb in February 1976. Aftermath On 5 January 1976, just six days after the bar bombing ten Protestant workmen were shot dead and one badly injured by a group calling itself the South Armagh Republican Action Force near Kingsmill in Armagh.

A section of about forty men from the National Liberation Army (ALN) under the command of Lieutenant Ali Khodja ambushed a unit of 21 men from the 9th Colonial Infantry Regiment of the French Army commanded by Second Lieutenant Hervé Artur. The ambush led to the complete destruction of the small unit of French marines, with a total of 20 French soldiers killed, including their commander, Hervé Artur. One French soldier was taken prisoner and later released. Algerian losses are unknown, but thought to number around one killed and a few wounded.  Historical context  After the 1st November 1954, Algeria was at war. As the armed insurgency led by the National Liberation Front (FLN) grew in size, the French army's numbers fell, because Moroccan troops were returning to their now-independent country, a drop in effective strength of the units, and increasing numbers of desertions of Algerian spahis and tirailleurs. President of the Council Guy Mollet recalled available reservists to increase the military strength in Algeria to 200,000 soldiers.Jean-Charles Jauffret, \\"Le mouvement des rappelés en 1955–1956\\", (The Recall Movement in 1955-1956) in Mohammed Harbi and Benjamin Stora, La Guerre d'Algérie, (The War on Algeria), Paris, Robert Laffont, Pluriel collection, 2004, p. 202-203. Recently elected to ensure \\"peace in North Africa,\\" he nevertheless implemented a repressive policy and refused to negotiate on independence until a ceasefire was reached. It was also the first time a socialist government, supported by the Communists, decided to send in the army.François Buton, « Quand les disponibles ne veulent pas l’être. Le « Mouvement des rappelés » pendant la guerre d’Algérie », in André Loez and Nicolas Mariot, Obéir/désobéir : les Mutineries de 1917 en perspective (Obeying/Disobeying: The Mutinies of 1917 in Perspective), La Découverte, 2008, 448 p. (, read online [archive]), p. 2. In May 1956, the first recalled reservists landed in Algeria. The FLN, for its part, organized in September 1955, very shortly after the events of Constantine, one of its first propaganda operations. Abane Ramdane, head of the Algiers zone, invited into the Palestro maquis the French journalist , to whom were presented the demands of the independence movement; Barrat also met with djounoud, National Liberation soldiers.Branche 2010, p. 16-17. Protagonists  The ambush pitted the French Army against the Algerian National Liberation Army with, on the French side, the 2nd section of the 2nd Battalion of the 9th Colonial Infantry Regiment.Branche 2010, p. 20-21Andrea Brazzoduro, « Comptes-rendus : Raphaëlle Branche, L’Embuscade de Palestro. Algérie 1956 » [archive], sur Histoire@Politique, 18 March 2011 commanded by Second Lieutenant Hervé Artur, and on the Algerian side part of the Ali Khodja commando unit, several groupsA group was made up of eleven men, a sergeant and two corporals (Branche 2010, p. 24). with a total of some forty djounoud. Staff of the ALN wilaya 4, 1956–1957. Ali Khodja was born in Algiers on January 12, 1933. In October 1955, he deserted from the Hussein Dey barracks with two others, carrying with them weapons, and joined the maquis in Palestro led by . Khodja was entrusted with the command of an ALN section with a strength of one hundred men.Branche 2010, p. 24. He soon distinguished himself in action, becoming the commando Ali Khodja, one of the legends of the ALN. (, read online) To obtain weapons and clothing, the Khodja unit, like all other units of the NLA at that time, favored ambushes executed in accordance with the motto \\"Strike, Recover and Stall.\\"Branche 2010, p. 23, 25. Hervé Artur was born in Paris on September 17, 1926; after his military service in Algeria, he prepared a philosophy degree, which he abandoned for a job in a transport company. At the end of April 1956 he was recalled to military service and served with the rank of second lieutenant in the 9th Colonial Infantry Regiment stationed in Kabylie.Branche 2010, p. 44, 239. This officer, who believed in the pacification of Algeria by the French army, commanded a section of twenty infantry consisting of two sergeants, two corporals, two corporals, and fourteen soldiers.Bigot and Chorliet, sergeants, Galleux and Aurousseau, master corporals, Poitreau and Hecquet, corporals, Desruet, Dufour, Caron, Dobœuf, Gougeon, Carpentier, Serreau, François, Villemaux, Chicandre, Nicolas, Daigneaux, David-Nillet and Dumas, soldiers (Branche 2010, p. 239-242). Most were working-class in civilian life.Branche 2010, p. 44. On the morning of 18 May, the unit went on a reconnaissance mission to the villages near Ouled Djerrah. The guerilla attack lasted less than twenty minutes and ended in an ALN victory. Only five members of the 2nd section survived the ambush: sergeant Alain Chorliet, master corporal Louis Aurousseau, and Lucien Caron. The three were injured, as were two other men, Jean David-Nillet and Pierre Dumas. Gravely wounded, Caron was left with the kabyle villagers of the douar, and the other survivors taken away by the moudjahideen. The two wounded men were entrusted to the villagers of the neighboring douar, Bou Zegza. David-Nillet and Dumas were held as prisoners by Khodja, who retreated into the mountains. Mutilations At the moment of leaving the location of the ambush, the soldier Pierre Dumas taken prisoner, saw the elders of the neighboring village of Djerrah arrive. The press of the time reported uncritically that these residents began to mutilate the French soldiers. The true course of events is unknown but the mutilations were not on the scale reported. Lieutenant Artur's throat was cut and his men had knife marks all over their bodies. The eyes of some had been put out, but it was not possible to exclude animals as a cause of this. But gendarmes noted neither emasculations, nor eviscerations. Writings persist to this day that talk of lips and noses cut off, cut throats, eyes put out, throats cut, stomachs eviscerated and stuffed with pebbles, or testicles cut off. « La rencontre avec la mort 1956 ») According to and Évelyne Lever, \\"these mutilations were carried out by the survivors of the local population, the day after a particularly brutal ratissage, or raid. Yves Courrière shared this point of view, specifying that the mutilations took place \\"after the death of the French soldiers.\\" 23 May 1956: French retaliation On May 19, not having heard from the 2nd section, the French Army sent three battalions and four helicopters to find them. In the helicopters were elements of the 4th squadron of the 13th Parachute Dragoon Regiment (RDP) based at Draâ El Mizan. On May 23, the parachutists of the 1st Foreign Parachute Regiment (1st REP) and of the 20th Colonial Parachute Battalion (20th BPC) found 19 members of commando Ali Khodja fortified in a grotto with the two prisoners, near Tifrène. In the ensuing fighting sixteen moudjahideen were killed and three taken prisoner. Jean David-Nillet was accidentally killed in the assault, and the wounded Pierre Dumas was set free. Historian notes that on the afternoon following discovery of the French bodies \\"forty-four Algerians were summarily killed\\" while \\"most, even the military admitted, were fleeing the encircling French troops north of the ambush location.\\". The village of Djerrah was also completely destroyed in reprisal. The actions of Henri Maillot, a militant from the Algerian Communist Party (PCA) who had deserted a few weeks before with a truckful of weapons, has sometimes been juxtaposed to the ambush of May 18, 1956. This hypothesis was rejected by Branche, who underlined the hostility of the FLN towards Maillot's attempt to set up a maquis in the Ouarsenis region.. Consequences Press The Palestro ambush gave the French government reason to put into place strict information controls. Five days after the ambush, on May 21, 1956, , Armed Forces Secretary, sent General Henri Lorillot an instruction forbidding communication to the press of the numbers of military casualties. Also, a few days later, a code of conduct came to very strictly govern information on military operations in progress. Finally, a communiqué from resident minister Robert Lacoste forbade the press, without authorization, from identifying units engaged in fighting, disclosing casualties sustained by friendly forces, or the names of victims or other information \\"which might upset the interested families.\\" Executions On 19 June 1956, a month after the ambush, two \\"rebels\\" condemned to death were executed, Ahmed Zabana and Abdelkader Ferradj. The choice of Zabana can easily be explained by his important role in the Algerian independence movement, but that of Ferradj seems to only be explained by his membership in the Ali Khodja commando group; he was accused by the press and by the resident minister of having participated in attacks prior to the Palestro ambush. These executions constituted \\"an answer\\" to the ambush. Some clues indicate that Aurousseau and Serreau, the two soldiers who disappeared from the Artur unit, were still alive at the beginning of June 1956, prisoners of the ALN and were possibly executed in reprisal for the deaths of Zabana et Ferradj. Collective memory Crosne carrying the name of Jean David-Nillet, originally from this town who died in the French Army's assault to free him. According to historian Benjamin Stora, \\"Palestro would remain the most famous ambush of the war, a symbol of the worst that can happen: a surprise attack, impossible to defend against, mutilation of corpses. The military hierarchy was also adept at using this trauma to overcome reluctance.\\" As a military event the ambush itself was not particularly significant, in terms of either casualties or the death of the particular officer commanding the section, the incident was well within the norms of 1956. The event nonetheless took on, in the following days and for very long afterwards, a particular importance, joining in the French imagination, next to the massacre in Constantinois on August 20, 1955 and, a year later, the , a triptych that supposedly symbolised the violence and savagery of the independence fighters. Official discourse, or in the media, associated with the \\"fellagha\\" an image of \\"savagery\\" and \\"fanaticism\\", proof of the \\"primitive character\\" of the Algerian being the ambush itself and the mutilations that accompanied it.. The word \\"massacre\\" came to be used rather than \\"ambush\\", as the event was initially called. Finally, the event itself took on a whole other meaning: it was no longer a defeat of the French Army, but violence that targeted — by assimilation — \\"civilians\\". Insurrection of 1871 The creation of the French village of Palestro was decreed by Napoléon III in 1869, in the centre of an alluvial plain edged by mountains 80 km south-east of Algiers. The Isser oued flows into this bowl after a course of four kilometers through the rocky defile of the gorges of Palestro. It is a strategic area between Kabylie and the Mitidja coastal plain.. It was named for the French victory at the Battle of Palermo. Less than three years after it was founded, during the revolt of Cheikh Mokrani, the village was attacked April 21, 1871, by 1,500 to 1,800 armed men. Roughly fifty colonists were killed in a few moments: among them were mayor of Palestro Dominique Bassetti, and the brigadier of the gendarmerie, killed with an axe by three detainees freed by the insurgents. In 1991, the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), then in 1992, the Armed Islamic Group of Algeria, installed their rear bases there. , has said that Djerrah (or Palestro) remains the symbol of a place that is difficult to control, where violence seems to almost take on a certain logic.http://www.nonfiction.fr/article.htm?articleID=3286&categ;=4&page;=2  See also  * Algerian War * Battle of Bouzegza * Battle of Algiers References  Sources and bibliography  *Raphaëlle Branche, L’Embuscade de Palestro : Algérie 1956, (The Palestro Ambush: Algeria 1956), Paris, Armand Colin, 2010, 256 p.

It has become known as the first genocide of the 21st century. The genocide, which is being carried out against the Fur, Masalit and Zaghawa tribes, has led the International Criminal Court (ICC) to indict several people for crimes against humanity, rape, forced transfer and torture. According to Eric Reeves, more than one million children have been \\"killed, raped, wounded, displaced, traumatized, or endured the loss of parents and families\\". The crisis and ongoing conflict in Sudan's Western Darfur Region have developed from several separate events. The first is a civil war that occurred between the Khartoum national governments and two rebel groups in Darfur: the Justice and Equality Movement and the Sudan Liberation Army. The rebel groups were initially formed in February 2003 due to Darfur's \\"political and economic marginalization by Khartoum\\". In April 2003, when the rebel groups attacked the military airfield and kidnapped an air force general, the government launched a counterattack. It led to a response from the Khartoum government where they armed militia forces to eliminate the rebellion. This resulted in mass violence against the citizens in Darfur. A second factor is a civil war that has occurred between the Christians, the animist Black southerners, and the Arab dominated government since Sudan's independence from the United Kingdom in 1956. The violence that took place for about 11 years left more than a million people displaced by the hostilities: fleeing to other places around Sudan or across the border to Chad. The ethnic conflict in Darfur has been persistent, with Arab racism at its roots.Makau Mutua, \\"Racism at root of Sudan's Darfur crisis.\\" CSMonitor, July 14, 2004 Darfur is home to six million people and several dozen tribes. Darfur is split into two: \\"those who claim Black 'African' descent and primarily practice sedentary agriculture, and those who claim 'Arab' descent and are mostly semi nomadic livestock herders\\". In 2013 the United Nations (UN) estimated that up to 300,000 people had been killed during the genocide, in response the Sudanese government claimed that the number of deaths was \\"grossly inflated\\". By 2015, it was estimated that the death toll stood between 100,000 and 400,000. The violence continued into 2016 where the government allegedly used chemical weapons against the local population in Darfur. This led to millions being displaced due to the hostile environment. Over 3 million lives are heavily impacted by the conflict.  War crimes  Arab Janjaweed tribes have been a major player in the conflict. The BBC first reported on the issue of ethnic cleansing in November 2003, and earlier that year in March. An administrator from the United States Agency for International Development giving testimony to congress mentioned ethnic cleansing and the \\"population clearance\\" which was occurring in Darfur. In April 2004, Human Rights Watch (HRW) released Darfur Destroyed: Ethnic Cleansing by Government and Militia Forces in Western Sudan, a 77-page report compiled by HRW following 25 days spent in the region. The executive director of the African branch of HRW, Peter Takirambudde, stated \\"There can be no doubt about the Sudanese government's culpability in crimes against humanity in Darfur\\". The HRW report also documents Janjaweed killings of Muslim religious leaders, desecration of the Koran and the destruction of mosques.  Rape during the Darfur genocide  The use of rape as a tool of genocide has been noted. This crime has been carried out by Sudanese government forces and the Janjaweed (\\"evil men on horseback\\") paramilitary groups. The actions of the Janjaweed have been described as genocidal rape, with not just women, but children as well. There were also reports of infants being bludgeoned to death, and the sexual mutilation of victims being commonplace. With the ongoing conflict, it has not been possible for interviewers and activists to conduct population-based surveys in Darfur. However, the rapes reported have mostly occurred in non-Arab villages by the Janjaweed with the assistance of the Sudanese military. The settings in which these attacks occurred: # The Janjaweed forces surrounded the village and then attacked girls and women who left the village to gather firewood or water; # The Janjaweed forces either went house to house, killing the boys and men while raping the girls and women, or rounded up everyone, bringing them to a central location, where the forces then killed the boys and men then raped the girls and women # The Janjaweed forces went to nearby villages or towns, internally displaced person (IDP) camps, or across the border into Chad to rape women and children. According to Tara Gingerich and Jennifer Leaning, the rape attacks were often carried out in front of others \\"including husbands, fathers, mothers, and children of the victims, who were forced to watch and were prevented from intervening\\". This genocidal rape has been committed upon a wide age range, that includes women of 70 years or older, girls under 10, and visibly pregnant women. The missing women and girls have possibly been released, but may have heretofore been unable to reunite with their families. In a statement to the UN, former secretary general Kofi Annan said \\"In Darfur, we see whole populations displaced, and their homes destroyed, while rape is used as a deliberate strategy.\\"  International Involvement   United Nations – African Union Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID)  The United Nations issued a hybrid United Nations-African Union mission (UNAMID) to maintain peace in Darfur. It was established on 31 July 2007 with the adoption of Security Council resolution 1769. However, it formally took over on 31 December 2007. The Mission's headquarters is in El Fasher, North Darfur. It has sector headquarters in El Geneina (West Darfur), Nyala (South Darfur), Zalingei (Central Darfur) and El Daein (East Darfur). The Mission has 35 deployment locations throughout the five Darfur states. The African Union (AU) and the United Nations (UN) produced a framework document for intensive diplomatic and political peacekeeping efforts. Sudan's acceptance of the African Union Hybrid Operation in Darfur derived from intensive negotiations by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and several actors in the international community. According to the UNAMID website, \\"the mandate is renewed yearly, and the adoption of Security Council Resolution 2296 extended it until 30 June 2017.\\" The peacekeeping mission is confronted with several challenges from security to logistical constraints. The troops that have been deployed operate in unforgiving, complex, and often a hostile political environment. Also, the missions are faced with many shortages in equipment, infrastructure, transportation, and aviation assets. As the budget of UNAMID is $1,039,573.2 for the fiscal year 2016–2017. Yet, with the limited resources and hostile environment, the troops still manage to provide protection to the locals in Darfur and assist the progress of the humanitarian aid operation. UNAMID contributes to promote peace, address the critical roots of the conflict and help end the violence considering \\"the mission carries out more than 100 patrols daily\\". The peacekeepers facilitate cooperation and maintain peace by: * Protecting civilians without prejudice to the responsibility of the Government of Sudan. * Delivering humanitarian assistance by UN agencies and other aid actors and the safety and security of humanitarian personnel. * Intervening between the Government of Sudan and non-signatory movements. * Resolving community conflict through measures of addressing its root causes. The mission had an authorized strength of 25,987 uniformed peacekeepers on 31 July 2007. The operation included 19,555 troops, 360 military observers and liaison officers, 3,772 police advisers and 2,660 formed police units (FPU). In mid-2011, UNAMID stood at 90 percent of its full authorized strength, making it one of the largest UN peacekeeping operations.  2018  Although violence is still occurring in Darfur, it is at a low level and the region is increasingly stable. The UNAMID forces are exiting as there had been a reduction to the number of troops deployed in the field in Darfur, Sudan. The Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations Amina Mohammed states: > \\"We have invested $16 billion in peacekeeping alone over the past ten years, > in addition to humanitarian funding and bilateral aid to alleviate the > suffering of the population. As the region recovers from war, now is the > time to consolidate gains,\\" she said, adding that it was time to \\"step up > and make sure Darfur moves towards peace and prosperity.\\"  Reactions  Destroyed villages (August 2004) In 2007 a former employee of Google, Andria Ruben McCool, conceived the idea of using the high resolution imagery from Google Earth to map what was occurring in Darfur. The project was titled Crisis in Darfur and is run by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in partnership with Google earth. The software allows users to zoom in on the region, and users were able see over 1600 destroyed and damaged villages. Mark Tarn writing in the Guardian describes the images as 'dramatic' as the area is marked by red and yellow icons which he says 'graphically conveys the mayhem that has been inflicted on the people of the region'. In 2004 Colin Powell told the state committee on foreign affairs that a genocide had been carried out in Darfur, that the Sudanese government and the Janjaweed were responsible, and that the genocide may still be ongoing. Powell stated that having reviewed the evidence which had been compiled by the State Department and having compared it to information which was freely available throughout the international community he came to the conclusion that genocide had been carried out in Darfur\\" On September 21, 2004, during the Senate Foreign Relations convention, Powell expressed: > \\"In July, we launched a limited investigation by sending a team to visit the > refugee camps in Chad to talk to refugees and displaced persons. The team > ... were able to interview 1136 of the 2.2 million people the UN estimates > have been affected by this horrible situation.\\" > \\"Those interviews indicated: ... a consistent and widespread pattern of > atrocities: Killings, rapes, burning of villages committed by jingaweit and > government forces against non-Arab villagers; three-fourths of those > interviewed reported that the Sudanese military forces were involved in the > attacks; ... [villages] often experienced multiple attacks over a prolonged > period before they were destroyed by burning, shelling or bombing, making it > impossible for the villagers to return to their villages. This was a > coordinated effort, not just random violence.\\" > \\"When we reviewed the evidence compiled by our team, and then put it beside > other information available to the State Department and widely known > throughout the international community, widely reported upon by the media > and by others, we concluded, I concluded, that genocide has been committed > in Darfur and that the Government of Sudan and the Jingaweit bear > responsibility-and that genocide may still be occurring.\\" Powell concluded by announcing that at the next UN Security Council Resolution an investigation on all violations of international humanitarian law and human rights will occur in Darfur, Sudan with a view to ensuring accountability. In a speech given by President George W. Bush on May 29, 2007, he confirms that the situation in Darfur should be classified as a genocide. President Bush goes on further to say that the United States will be taking action against the Government of Sudan due to the lack of positive change in the country, at the hands of President Omar al-Bashir. In the same speech, President Bush details the way in which the United States' Department of Treasury will be tightening economic sanctions on Sudan. Not only will the United States tighten their economic sanctions, but President Bush claims that the Secretary of State will have meetings with the United Kingdom and other allies in order to put into action a new United Nations Security Council resolution. To end the speech, President Bush calls upon the United Nations, the African Union and other members of the international community to not obstruct the steps being taken to restore peace to Darfur. President Bush also calls upon the President Bashir to stop the injustices and killings of innocent people in Darfur. According to Rebecca Joyce Frey, the international community has taken the same stance with regards to Darfur as it did with the Rwandan genocide, that of an 'outside observer' or 'bystander'. Joyce Frey also argues that Bashir, as well as other leaders have realized that the lack of intervention in Rwanda from the international community gives them free rein to continue the genocide without them having any serious concerns over international intervention. Nicholas Kristof, writing in the New York Times, has claimed China \\"is financing, diplomatically protecting and supplying the arms for the first genocide of the 21st century' in Darfur\\". China was seen as an enabler for President Bashir's resistance to UN deployment and international attention. China did press Sudan to accept the UN deployments in Darfur. However China had also supplied Khartoum with weapons and had the power to single-handedly veto resolutions of the United Nations Security Council.Funk, Kevin, and Steven Fake. Scramble for Africa: Darfur-Intervention and the USA. Black Rose Books, 2009. China's primary goal is not achieving better human rights practices in the abstract but satisfying Darfur's basic needs for food, shelter, and security. In a 176-page report carried out by the International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur to the United Nations Secretary-General, the Commission determined that the Government of Sudan did not intentionally pursue policies that would lead to genocide. The Commission \\"found that government forces and militias conducted indiscriminate attacks, including killing of civilians, torture, enforced disappearances, destruction of villages, rape and other forms of sexual violence, pillaging and forced displacement, throughout Darfur.\\" The Commission concluded, however, that \\"[t]he crucial element of genocidal intent appears to be missing, at least as far as the central government authorities are concerned.\\" The Commission goes on to say that the war crimes and crimes against humanity that occurred in Darfur are just as important as if the situation were determined to be a genocide.http://www.un.org/news/dh/sudan/com_inq_darfur.pdf The Save Darfur Coalition, as David Lanz discusses in his article entitled, \\"Save Darfur: A Movement and Its Discontents\\", was one of the biggest international social movements and had significant impacts on how the world reacted to Darfur. Some of the achievements that Lanz attributes to the Save Darfur Coalition, that became extremely popular in the United States, was the change in rhetoric from the government. Lanz attributes Colin Powell's consideration of the Darfur Crisis as a genocide as one of the movement's biggest achievements. One other accomplishment that Save Darfur claims responsibility for was their vital role in lobbying the UN Security Council for their referral of Darfur to the ICC. In the United States, the Save Darfur movement got the attention of many celebrities, most notably including: Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Mia Farrow and Richard Branson. Farrow famously travelled to Darfur and filmed children playing. Farrow and Branson also posted videos to YouTube, where they, and others, went on hunger strikes in solidarity to the people in Darfur. George Clooney was credited as one of the most influential celebrities to bring the Darfur Crisis onto the world stage. Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt had made $1m donation to three charities working in Sudan.  Proceedings of the ICC  Initially the ICC refused to add the charge of genocide to the indictment for Bashir, however following an appeal this decision was overturned. The trial chamber found that there were \\"reasonable grounds to believe him responsible for three counts of genocide\\". On 14 July 2009, the ICC issued an indictment for the president of Sudan, Omar Bashir, for crimes against humanity and for having facilitated and ordering the genocide in Darfur. On 12 July 2010 the ICC issued a second indictment for the arrest of al-Bashir for genocide, this was the first instance of the ICC issuing an arrest warrant for the crime of genocide. As well as Bashir another six suspects have been indicted by the court, Ahmed Haroun, Ali Kushayb, Bahar Abu Garda, Abdallah Banda, Saleh Jerbo, Abdel Rahim Mohammed Hussein, none of those indicted have yet been taken into custody. Luis Moreno-Ocampo, prosecutor for the ICC having filed charges for crimes against humanity, is also pursuing in his application the charge of genocidal rape as such actions can be tried before the ICC as stand-alone crimes. On February 11, 2020, the government of Sudan agreed that former president Omar al-Bashir will face war crime charges before the ICC. The commitment came during peace talks with rebel groups.  Darfur Refugee Camps  Darfur Refugee Camps The citizens in Darfur who have fled the genocide in Sudan- and continue to flee today- settle in one of the 13 refugee camps in Eastern Chad. About 360,000 Darfuri's suffer in those camps: \\"The 10+ years they have lived in the camps have been marked by tight resources, threats from inside and outside the camps, and more, but life is getting even harder for the refugees.\\" UNHCR proposed to the UN Secretary-General to \\"take responsibility for the protection and voluntary return of IDPs to their villages of origin in West Darfur in partnership with other agencies…\\". The UN approved of their proposal to govern and create a protective environment in camps, host communities and settlements for the displaced people to a within Darfur. (PDF) There have been funding shortfalls which impacted the increase in the refugees and internally displaced persons. The environment and lack of exceptional living conditions is not able to accommodate the refugee community. As of 2018, a group of refugees that have been in Chad since 2003–2004 are returning to North Darfur. They are the first of thousands who are expected to return voluntarily to Darfur in the coming months. The refugees are provided with transport and packages which include three months of food rations, provided by the World Food Programme (WFP). As the peace and security situation is maintained in Darfur, more refugees will want to return to Sudan.  Media and popular culture   Films  The documentary The Devil Came on Horseback (2007), focuses on the violence and tragedy of the genocide happening in Darfur. The story is seen through the eyes of an American who returns home to make the story public using the images and stories of lives systematically destroyed. In 2009, Uwe Boll, a director and producer, released a movie named Attack on Darfur. The story centers on American journalists visiting Sudan to interview the locals about the ongoing conflict. They are confronted with the atrocities the Janjaweed caused in which they try their best to stop the killings and help the villagers faced with genocide. Filmmaker Ted Braun examines the genocide in Darfur, Sudan. Alongside Hotel Rwanda star Don Cheadle, the film Darfur Now (2007) is a call to action for people all over the world to help the ongoing crisis in Darfur. Sand And Sorrow: A New Documentary about Darfur (2007) is a documentary film about the ongoing Darfur conflict. Interviews and footage of human right activist John Prendergast, Harvard professor Samantha Power and New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof are shown to depict the origins and the aftermath of the conflict between the Arab and non-Arab tribes in the Darfur region.

He held world records in helicopter competitions. He helped popularize light aviation and was a prominent activist in the world of Russian GA. He was also an active member of the aviation organization .  Biography  He was born in Moscow in 1959 into the family of test pilot Rostislav Fabiovich Farikh born May 12, 1922. His grandfather Fabio Farikh was a prominent polar pilot and a motoring pioneer in Russia. In 1976, Mikhail graduated from Moscow School No. 10. He entered the law faculty of the Military Institute of the Ministry of Defense (which is now, after several transformations, part of the MU RF MD), from which he graduated in 1980. He served in the armed forces as a legal officer until 1995. He retired with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. After being discharged into the reserves, he went into the automobile audio equipment business. He was fond of multi-discipline car audio competitions and in 2006 became the Russian champion in EMMA racing, in which driving skills as well as car audio and tuning are put to the test. After giving up his active role in business, Mikhail enrolled in cooking courses, studied Italian, and then ended up by chance in a flying club, where he began to study flying at  Mobile Sound Systems  Prolozavr demo car Mikhail Farikh made a valuable contribution to the recent history of Russian and international mobile sound- system design and all-terrain vehicles. The projects he headed attracted great attention at car audio competitions, exhibitions, and social events. In sound- pressure level (SPL) competitions between 2001 and 2007, Team Prology took first place 48 times and second place twice and set 14 Russian records. The absolute Russian record of 173.4 dB, set in 2003 with the car named “Ladoga,” has yet to be surpassed. He helped to develop and build a number of mobile audio complexes (Hurricane, Typhoon, JBL Sound Cruiser, Prolozavr 1.0 and 2.0). The JBL Sound Cruiser test car made a great impression at the 2005 IFA in Berlin and received worldwide acclaim.  Flight Activity  R44 Mikhail began to learn to fly helicopters in 2007. In 2008, he acquired his private pilot license. He immediately began flying frequently and extensively. He acquired a British pilot license in the same year, and an American one in 2010. In subsequent years, he continued to increase his qualifications by attending courses at various domestic and foreign flying clubs (in England, Spain, the US, Canada, etc.), and was constantly improving his technique, paying special attention to autorotation landings. The Robinson R44 and Robinson R66 were Mikhail's main helicopters. Mikhail's intense flight activity is proved by the hours he logged — without performing commercial flights or training student pilots, Mikhail flew 332 hours in 2011 (a total of 1,340 hours as of 2011) and 425 hours in 2013 (altogether 2,113 hours). He flew more than 2,100 hours in the six years after he began training. Later Mikhail also mastered flying airplanes and received a “Single-engine land- based plane” entry in his pilot license. He also flew gliders and other types of aircraft. Mikhail Farikh after his first flight on a glider in 2012. After major reforms to Russian aviation legislation in 2010, he mastered the new flight rules and helped other pilots to do so. In 2012, he was the first Russian private pilot to cross the border of Russia in a helicopter under the new rules for foreign flights. He twice (in 2010 and 2013) organized the Robinson Safety Course (a safe piloting course) in Moscow, as well as a workshop led by the British pilot Quentin Smith, nicknamed “Captain Q” on operating the Robinson R44 in the cold months of the year and under ever- changing weather conditions. Quentin is considered to be one of the most experienced Robinson R44 pilots; he twice went around the world by helicopter and became the first pilot in aviation history who landed a piston helicopter on both the North and South Poles. Between September 22 and 26, Mikhail Farikh and Dmitry Rakitsky carried out a speed-record-breaking flight from Moscow to Sakhalin. The FAI registered three records at once as a result of this four- day flight.  Volunteer Air Rescuer  Mikhail Farikh cooking meat at an airshow Mikhail was one of the first pilots in Russia who helped rescue people who had gotten lost in the woods. In 2011, he took part in four search-and- rescue operations in cooperation with the Liza Alert volunteer organization. He flew for a total of about 15 hours This initiative led to the formation of the Angel helicopter search-and-rescue detachment, which now comprises over 90 people. Mikhail continued to take part in rescues and joint exercises. He was posthumously awarded the badge of honor of the Angel helicopter search-and- rescue detachment. In addition to searching for people (mushroom gatherers, tourists, etc.), he participated in search-and-rescue operations aimed at searching for crews of aircraft in distress. He vigorously advocated the mandatory use of satellite trackers (SPOT, inReach, etc.), which make it possible to find aircraft following accidents.  Flight to the North Pole  In 2013, he reached the North Pole as a crew member with PIC Dmitrii Rakitsky, flying the Moscow — North Pole — Moscow route. The crew was the first in the world to make that flight with the light helicopter Robinson R66. Flights past the Arctic Circle were also performed for scientific purposes. During the flight, with the participation of the polar explorer Oleg Prodan, they placed radio buoys at the location where the schooner Svyataya Anna from the Brusilov Expedition was wrecked, so as to determine the direction of ice drift, which might make it possible to discover the ship itself.  Around- the-World Flight  The first attempt to fly around the world in 2012 did not move beyond the preparatory stage, as the US aviation authorities issued a NOTAM, according to which aircraft of several countries, including those registered in Russia, were not cleared for flights under the VFR over American territory. In 2013 the around-the-world flight attempt met with success. It was carried out by two Robinson R66s, flown by Farikh and Dmitrii Rakitsky, Alexander Kurylev, and Vadim Melnikov. Cameraman and film director Dmitrii Kubasov traveled the whole way with the pilots. This was the first around-the- world helicopter flight in Russian history.  Other Aviation Activity  As an active member of the Russian aviation community and representative of AOPA Russia, Mikhail developed relationships with government agencies and regulatory bodies and participated in various events along with other GA pilots.Совещание Ространснадзора в УТЦ-22. Выступление М.Фариха от лица АОПА- Россия Youtube (10.04.2012). He also took part in various air shows and events — Vertoslet, the travel-media PereDvizheniye Festival, and others. In 2015, under Mikhail's leadership, a group of five helicopters (the crew of one of them containing representatives from the US, Britain, and Russia) visited three poles — the magnetic pole, the geographic pole, and the pole of inaccessibility. During this flight, a unique refueling feat was accomplished with the use of a store of fuel arranged ahead of time on drift ice. In 2015, at the annual conference of AOPA Russia, he presented the Pilot of the Year award in his capacity as the King of Arms of the organization. Also in 2015, Mikhail took part in a successful attempt to set the Guinness World Record for the largest helicopter formation. When Mikhail himself did not take part in the flights, he did a lot to make them possible, by sharing experience with others, rendering organizational assistance, and following his colleagues’ flights closely. One of the biggest projects undertaken with Mikhail's assistance was the 2014 Moscow — New Zealand — Moscow flight headed by Evgeny Kabanov.Выпуск 194 Пилот ТВ (18.09.2014). Mikhail also played a big role in the 2015 attempt by Sergey Ananov to carry out a solo around-the-world flight in a Robinson R22.  Death during the “Searching for the Two Captains” expedition  Mikhail Farikh talks about the goal of the last expedition. Recorded on the day of the catastrophe — June 18, 2016. Mikhail Farikh died on April 18, 2016Свидетельства очевидцев: крушение вертолёта Robinson R-66 RA-06233 на острове Белый Время Ямала (19 April 2016). during the second helicopter expedition in search of the Svyataya Anna gunvessel. The fatal crash occurred at 22:06 local time (17:06 UTC) at Oleg Prodan, polar explorer and director of the Onezhskoye Pomorye National Park, and Alexei Frolov, founder and owner of the Mirital company, died along with him. All three men held private pilot licenses with the helicopter pilot entry. A group of three Robinson R66 helicopters participating in the “Searching for the Two Captains” expedition was flying along the route from Amderma Airport to the landing site on Bely Island in the Kara Sea. While they were approaching the island, thick, low cloud cover formed. The crew of the formation leader decided to descend into the clouds to determine their lower boundary and see if it was possible to land. While carrying out this mission, the helicopter crashed to the ground. The IAC board's report it states that “the most probable cause of the R66 RA-06233 helicopter’s crash was the PIC’s loss of flight altitude control during the attempt to establish visual contact with terrain under weather conditions that did not comply with VFR and the pilot’s experience level, which led to the aircraft’s collision with the icy surface of the Kara Sea”. A large crowd paid its last respects to the deceased crew in the memorial hall of the Troyekurovskoye Cemetery on April 24, 2016. Mikhail Farikh is buried at the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow, Alexei Frolov is buried at the Zvyaginskoe cemetery (Moscow region), while Oleg Prodan was buried in at his birthplace in Rybinsk, along with his parents.  Memorialization  In recognition of Mikhail's contributions to the development of sound-system competitions, the National Association of Automobile Audio Competitions, АМТ Eurasia, declared the 2016 season the Season in Memory of Mikhail Farikh. In spring 2017, work to memorialize convoy BD-5 and the crew of the lost R66 on Belyi Island was undertaken. On March 17, 2017, a large wooden cross was installed on the island at with the support of the non-profit partnership Arctic Development Center. A month later, on April 13, 2017, an AOPA Russia air expedition attached a plaque with the following explanatory text to the cross: Il-14 \\"Penguin\\" named after Mikhail Farikh In 2016, an Il-14 Penguin restored to airworthy condition by enthusiasts was named after Mikhail Farikh.  World Records  Mikhail set three speed records along these routes in the class of piston helicopters with MTOW of 1,000 to 1,750 kg: #Istra, Moscow Region (Bunkovo) — Tyumen: 173.04 km/h — currently valid world record. #Istra, Moscow Region (Bunkovo — Krasnoyarsk: 99.34 km/h — currently valid world record. #Istra, Moscow Region (Bunkovo — Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk: 66.15 km/h — currently valid world record.

She showed her best form as a two-year-old in 2004 when she was unbeaten in her first four races including the Fillies' Sprint Stakes, Queen Mary Stakes and Phoenix Stakes. On her only subsequent start that year she finished third in the Cheveley Park Stakes. At the end of the year she was rated the second-best filly of her generation in Europe. She failed to reproduce her juvenile form in three starts as a three-year-old in 2005 and was retired from racing. She has had some success as a broodmare. Background Damson is a dark bay mare with a narrow, interrupted white stripe bred in Ireland by Epona Bloodstock Ltd. As a yearling in October 2003 she was consigned to the Goff's sale and was bought for €160,000 by the trainer David Wachman. Wachman is the son-in-law of the Coolmore Stud's John Magnier. Like many Coolmore horses the details of the filly's ownership changed from race to race: she sometimes raced in the colours of Susan Magnier, while on others she was described as the property of a partnership between Magnier and Michael Tabor. She was one of the best horses sired by Entrepreneur who won the 2000 Guineas in 1997. He was not a great success as a breeding stallion and was exported to Japan in 2002. Her dam Tadkiyra produced several other winners including the Prestige Stakes winner Geminiani. She was a granddaughter of Tonnera (Prix Saint-Alary) who was in turn a daughter of the outstanding sprinter Texana (Prix de l'Abbaye). Racing career 2004: two-year-old season Damson began her racing career in a maiden race over five furlongs at Cork Racecourse on 12 April in which she started at odds of 5/1 in a five-runner field. Ridden by Jamie Spencer she took the lead approaching the final furlong and won by two lengths from The Quiet Woman. At Naas Racecourse on 7 June the filly was stepped up in class for the Listed Fillies' Sprint Stakes and started 15/8 second favourite behind the Jim Bolger-trained Pictavia. Spencer sent her into the lead in the last quarter mile and she quickly opened up a clear lead before being eased down to win \\"comfortably\\" by two lengths. Nine day after her win at Naas, Damson was sent to England for the Group 3 Queen Mary Stakes at Royal Ascot and started the 11/2 joint favourite alongside the James Fanshawe-trained Soar. Spencer restrained the filly before making rapid progress in the last quarter mile. She took the lead a furlong out and drew away in \\"impressive\\" fashion to win by three lengths from Soar. Spencer commented \\"She won so easily at Naas I thought she would go really well here today... when I asked her to go she went through the pack so quickly I nearly crashed into something else. It was a great adrenaline rush when we got into the clear\\". Kieren Fallon took over from Spencer when Damson was moved up to Group 1 class and matched against male opposition i the Phoenix Stakes at the Curragh on 8 August. She was made the 8/11 favourite in a six-runner field with the best of her opponents appearing to be the Aidan O'Brien-trained colts Russian Blue (Marble Hill Stakes) and Oratorio. After racing in third place behind Russian Blue, Damson moved up to take the lead entering the final furlong and kept on well to win by three quarters of a length from Oratorio. Her victory gave Wachman his first success at the highest level and was the first for a filly in the race since Eva Luna (IRE) won in 1994. After the race Wachman said \\"She's so switched off. Kieren said it is only a matter of pressing the button. She seems to be so relaxed in behind horses. It's a big relief to have that over with and we'll think about the Cheveley Park now. We'll also consider the Moyglare. She's smart, but as soon as she hits the front she idles\\". For her final appearance of the season Damson was sent to England for a second time and started odds-on favourite for the Cheveley Park Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse on 30 September. She sustained her first defeat as she came home third in a \\"blanket finish\\" beaten half a length by the winner Magical Romance. Wachman offered no excuses saying \\"She just did not go through the final furlong after coming with a run that made it look as if she could win. I am sure it was not the distance, so maybe it is just the end of a long season for her\\". In the International Classification for 2004 Damson was rated the best two-year-old filly trained in Ireland and the second best female of her generation on Europe behind Divine Proportions. 2005: three-year-old season Damson was the ante-post favourite for the 1000 Guineas but was withdrawn four days before the race after a \\"bad reaction\\" following a workout at Newmarket. Wachman commented \\"it's disappointing for all concerned but it's not the end of the world\\". The filly made her three-year-old debut on 22 May at the Curragh in the Irish 1,000 Guineas. She briefly took the lead in the straight before fading to finish ninth behind Saoire. In the Coronation Stakes (run that year at York) she was made 7/2 favourite but came home seventh of the ten runners in a race won by Maids Causeway. After two races over one mile Damson was dropped back in distance for the Sprint Stakes over six furlongs at the Curragh on 7 August. After being restrained towards the rear of the field she moved up into second place but faded badly in final furlong and finished ninth. On 29 August 2005 it was announced that Damson would not race again. Wachman said \\"Maybe she was slightly unlucky in the spring when she couldn't run in the Guineas but that doesn't matter now. She won a Group 1, a Group 3 and a Listed so I only wish I had a few more like her\\". Breeding record After her retirement from racing Damson became a broodmare for Liberty Bloodsock, a breeding company associated with the Coolmore Stud.

He founded the F. & K. Engineering Company and the German-Japanese Machine Tool Company, called Nichidoku Kikai Seisakujo, in Tokyo. Foerster was a leading industrialist and one of the richest foreigners in Japan. War  Rescue of Jewish refugees  With the help of the \\"Jewish Refugee Committee\\" he employed a sizable number of Jewish refugees from Germany and the occupied territories in his company. Being anti-Nazi, he organized, together with the \\"Jewish Refugee Committee\\" in Tokyo, the entry of his new employees and their families to Japan. Despite enormous pressure of the Nazi party and the German missions abroad in Tokyo and Yokohama, he refused to dismiss his staff members. Publicly he dissociated himself from NS policy and called himself a \\"stateless person\\". Hans Alexander Straus (Columbia Records) and Karl Rosenberg (Liebermann-Waelchli & Co.) in Tokyo, who organized the committee, received application documents from persecuted Jews in Germany and the German occupied territories which they forwarded to Foerster. Foerster then provided a free passage to Japan. The family men worked at Foerster's company and their children attended school. In this way a sizable number of Jewish refugees from Germany, Austria, and other countries, such as Czechoslovakia, came to Japan. In a letter written in 1939 to a stateless Jewish engineer in Germany, who had lost his job because of his Jewish descent, Rosenberg described Foerster as a man of \\"extraordinary independence, full of character and without prejudice\\". But even though the engineer was able to provide a passport without imprinted \\"J\\" and an employment contract with Foerster's company, the Japanese denied the entry of the family. But Foerster – as Rosenberg described – \\"worked desperately\\" to get a permission for the family to enter Japan. At least, like in other cases, he was successful. Shortly afterwards Rosenberg noted overjoyed, that Foerster was able, \\"despite extreme difficulties\\", to convince the Japanese authorities. Several other cases are documented. At the end of 1940 Foerster saved the children of one of his employees in Vienna from deportation to a concentration camp. Some months after their arrival in Japan they were deprived of citizenship by the German consulate in Yokohama. But Foerster was able to prevent the deportation of the whole family to the Shanghai Ghetto at the very last moment.  Defamation as an alleged criminal by German diplomats  Because of his resistance work, Foerster was defamed as an alleged criminal by German diplomats in Tokyo and Yokohama. For this purpose they used a forged criminal record, which they spread in the German community. After the war it was also handed over by the Japanese to the Allied Forces in Japan to discredit Foerster. It was based on the criminal record of a namesake of Foerster. This man was imprisoned several times in Germany for theft, dealing with stolen goods and sexual crimes. He was born in 1890 in Reichenbrand near Chemnitz and not in 1905 in Reichenbach in the Vogtland. His records clearly show that he was imprisoned from 23 July 1937 until 23 June 1938 in the prison of Hoheneck in Germany. At this time Foerster was already living in Japan for years as a successful businessman. But later SCAP included the forged criminal record into the Foerster-file, which led, in combination with false statements of interested parties, e. g. former officials, to the destruction of Foerster's credibility.  Arrest  Because of his strong opposition against NS policy and anti-Semitism he, his Japanese wife and several employees were arrested on 24 May 1943 by the Japanese Kenpeitai at the instigation of German authorities, who fraudulently denounced him as a \\"Soviet spy\\". Foerster was tortured (also by Josef Meisinger) and forced to sell his factory to a Japanese company. He was imprisoned for more than a year and released 13 June 1944. Foerster was acquitted being a \\"spy\\" by a Japanese court, but he was sentenced on probation i. a. because of anti-war propaganda and stirring up the public. Some days later he was placed under house arrest. On 17 May 1945 Foerster was arrested again as an \\"anti-Nazi\\" element, at the instigation of Meisinger. Together with Jews from Germany and Allied citizens (e. g. Catholic nuns) he was interned at Tokyo Koishikawa. Foerster was elected spokesman and supplied the detainees with additional food rations, he purchased with the help of a German woman, who was married to an Indian citizen. At the time of the great bombing of Tokyo, during the night of 25 to 26 May 1945, it was largely thanks to him that the inmates left camp alive. Foerster disarmed the guard and helped the internees out of the burning house. On 15 August 1945 the camp was liberated by American forces. Post-war  Results of SCAP / CIC investigations  After the war Foerster and his family lived at Lake Nojiri where he owned a house. The Allied forces in Japan carried out extensive investigations. Former German diplomats and others were interrogated. SCAP-files on Foerster show that interested parties were able to discredit him. Internal investigations of the Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC) revealed that Foerster was a sincere \\"anti-Nazi\\", who employed Jewish refugees in his company and was therefore regarded as \\"persona non grata\\" by German NS authorities. It was determined that Foerster was accused of anti-war propaganda, arrested twice as \\"anti-Nazi\\", and that he was denounced by the \\"Butcher of Warsaw\\", Josef Meisinger, to Japanese authorities.  Expropriation and forced repatriation to Germany  Despite these results and the fact that Foerster had been a stateless person since 1936, his property in Japan was expropriated and he was deported to Germany as an alleged Nazi, together with his wife and their daughter. Jewish friends who tried to help him were told that they were \\"only stateless foreigners\\", that Foerster \\"lies whenever he opens his mouth\\" and that he \\"never was arrested because of political terms\\". It was also mentioned that it could be dangerous for them to interfere in Foerster's case.  Results of German court investigations  Back in Germany it took nearly twenty years for German courts to come to the same conclusions as the CIC did before Foerster's forceful repatriation. After questioning a lot of witnesses, the judges of the higher regional court in Frankfurt am Main decided, that Foerster had been persecuted by Meisinger because of his antagonism against National Socialism and his resistance work, especially the employment of Jewish refugees. The court also stated that Meisinger had fraudulently denounced Foerster as a \\"spy\\", knowing that the Japanese would at the very least detain him for a long time. The judges declared that Meisinger had used the Japanese as an \\"instrument\\" of persecution. A few months after this decision, Foerster died. He was never rehabilitated publicly. On 28 August 2018, the biography of Willy Rudolf Foerster, the ″Schindler″ of Tokyo, was publicly presented at the Haus der Geschichte in Bonn. In a lecture the author Clemens Jochem presented individual biographies of Jewish employees rescued by Foerster, photos and essential new documents relating to the Foerster case.; ;  References   Sources   Books  [Memoirs of an employee of Foerster.

Leningrad period From book to film A clip from Post (silent version) In 1923 Tsekhanovsky demobilized and returned to Saint Petersburg (then Petrograd, renamed to Leningrad in a year) where he continued the art career. Among his projects were cinema posters that advertised foreign movies. He also taught art at the Tavricheskaya Art School. In 1926 he joined a group of book illustrators headed by Vladimir Lebedev which specialized on children's literature. Tsekhanovsky's area was popular science. His distinguishable \\"industrial\\" art style influenced by Lebedev and the constructivism aesthetic brought him fame.Some of the children's books illustrated by Mikhail Tsekhanovsky at the Rarus's Gallery (in Russian) In 1927 he illustrated the Post poem by Samuil Marshak about a letter that followed his friend Boris Zhitkov in his adventures around the world. The book saw many re-releases and has been since considered the peak of Tsekhanovsky's craftsmanship. Biographers agreed on that the book itself was designed according to the rules of film editing and was \\"full of movement\\". The artist also produced a number of flip books, thus his turn to animation was only a matter of time. In 1928 Sovkino signed a contract with him for an animated film based on Post. Tsekhanovsky, unfamiliar with the media, collaborated with Ivan Druzhinin and his own wife Vera Tsekhanovskaya, both professionally trained beginning animators. They had to improvise on their way and ended with a mix of traditional and cutout animation (called flat marionettes at the time) that brought Tsekhanovsky's unique vision to life. The silent version of Post was released in 1929, and in 1930 a musical score by Mikhail Deshevov was added along with a voiceover and some text by Daniil Kharms, while the positive was colorized by hand. It became the first Soviet animated color and sound film, while also the first to gain domestic and international acclaim. Frank Lloyd Wright showed it to Walt Disney as an example of thought-provoking animation.Giannalberto Bendazzi (2015). Animation: A World History: Volume I: Foundations - The Golden Age. — CRC Press, p. 81 Picture and sound Pacific 231: Symphonic Poem About a Steam Locomotive For the first time Soviet press started talking about animation as a new form of art, which was in fact director's original intention. As he wrote in his critical essay From Murzilka to Big Art, filmmakers of that time took animation for a \\"secondary, creatively insignificant offshoot of the big art of cinema, but not as a branch of graphics and painting, not to mention a separate form of art... Technical, professional and artistic processes of building a graphiс film are entirely different from the filmmaking process... Animation is not a filmed marionette, not a puppetry, not a theatre, not cinema... It is a new spatiotemporal type of fine art\\".Sergei Asenin (1983). The Wisdom of Fiction: Masters of Animation about Themselves and Their Art. — Moscow: Iskusstvo, p. 201—205, 97 In the same essay Tsekhanovsky brought up the subject of unity of animation and sound, as well as the concept of graphical sound which he is credited with inventing way back in 1929.Sound, Speech, Music in Soviet and Post-Soviet Cinema, 2014 by Indiana University Press, p. 22, 33 While Arseny Avraamov and others started developing the idea actively, Tsekhanovsky went his own way. The 1930 version of Post already featured a rhythmical picture synchronized with the pre-recorded sound, making it a separate, independent element of the film. In 1931 he directed two experimental \\"naturophotographic\\" live shorts Gopak and Pacific 231 made as attempts to illustrate a national dance and Arthur Honegger's orchestral work by synchronizing visual imagery with music.In Pursuit of the Lost Post documentary at the MasterFilm YouTube channel (in Russian) The Tale of Balda All this inspired Mikhail and Vera Tsekhanovsky to launch their most ambitious project: an animated opera The Tale of the Priest and of His Workman Balda based on the fairy tale in verse by Alexander Pushkin with a heavy Rosta posters influence. It was conceived in 1932 as the first traditionally animated Soviet feature film that used the \\"album method\\" of animation, with characters drawn on paper instead of celluloid. In 1933 Tsekhanovsky invited Dmitri Shostakovich to create the score and Alexander Vvedensky to write lyrics. The Bazaar scene from The Tale of the Priest and of His Workman Balda Shostakovich loved the opportunity to compose an innovative satirical opera with abstract characters led by his music and not by someone else. He called it \\"a fairy tale full of ardor, ease and joy, and writing music for it is just as easy and joyful\\". As Tsekhanovsky wrote during September 1934, \\"...he works incredibly fast without losing quality. True artist. True craftsman. Now it's up to me. I must create something worth of his music. I must. Balda is the only project where I can show what I'm capable of\\". They recorded 15 scenes by November.Sofia Hentova (1981). Shostakovich in Petrograd-Leningrad. — Leningrad: Lenizdat, p. 110—115 Yet problems started early into the production. Tsekhanovsky, still inexperienced, was always behind the composer, facing organizational and financial problems. First attempts to close Balda by Lenfilm date back to 1933. In March 1936, studio executives persuaded the composer to reorchestrate his score from a symphony to chamber orchestra. Around the same time the infamous Muddle Instead of Music article was published in press, condemning Shostakovich's opera. All this paralyzed the work, and the project was officially closed.John Riley (2005). Dmitri Shostakovich: A Life in Film. — New York: I.B.Tauris, p. 23-25, 47 Nevertheless, Tsekhanovsky compiled four finished parts and the rest of material into a full movie. It wasn't released, but shelved instead \\"for better times\\" which never happened, as it was destroyed in fire caused by the 1941 bombings of Leningrad that hit Lenfilm. Vera Tsekhanovskaya managed to save only a small Bazaar segment. Shostakovich regarded the film's score among his best works ever done: \\"There are a number of pieces I'm happy with. Especially Balda — from start to finish\\". In 2005 one of his students restored the 50-minute score and released it to public.Shostakovich: The Tale of the Priest & His Worker Balda / Sanderling at ArkivMusic World War II Tsekhanovsky's feelings were deeply hurt. He released his next long-planned short only in 1940. The Tale of a Silly Little Mouse turned a traditional children's film, although still free from cliches of its time.Georgy Borodin. The Story of the Unknown Picture. M. M. Tsekhanovsky's The Tale of a Silly Little Mouse in Documents article from the Notes by Film Historian magazine № 73, 2005 (in Russian) Once again he collaborated with Samuil Marshak and Dmitri Shostakovich whose score is performed independently at opera houses today.The Silly Little Mouse. Opera for the very youngest at the Mariinsky Theatre website The Tale of a Silly Little Mouse Unlike Shostakovich who enjoyed working with Tsekhanovsky, Marshak was annoyed by the changes made to his script (including the more kids-friendly ending) and requested to edit the film, which led to a conflict between Lenfilm and Mosfilm management. Finally he agreed to withdraw most of the claims in exchange to his name being removed from the credits (done in the final edit lost during the war). The film was shot in full color using the three-color film process by the cinematographer Pavel Mershin and released to a moderate success.The Tale of a Silly Little Mouse color restoration by Nikolai Mayorov and Vladimir Kotovsky, Nikolai Mayorov's official blog (in Russian) In the meantime Tsekhanovsky had been teaching students who wanted to join his studio at Lenfilm. He prepared a whole generation of animators by 1941 when the Great Patriotic War started. The consequences were truly catastrophic: many were killed at fronts, others starved to death during the Siege of Leningrad.Eleonora Guylan, Peter Bagrov. Once upon a time... Memoirs about the Leningrad pre-war animation at the Notes by Film Historian magazine, № 73, 2005 (in Russian) Tsekhanovsky himself nearly survived the siege. He lost a lot of weight, he witnessed the fire that ruined Lenfilm and all its archives, the deaths of his colleagues including Ivan Druzhinin who was killed during the Winter War campaign. In 1942 he was evacuated to Samarkand along with his wife and joined Soyuzmultfilm where he had worked till his death.Ivan Ivanov-Vano (1980). Frame by Frame. — Moscow: Iskusstvo, p. 129 Moscow period After the war Tsekhanovsky became known as one of the main supporters and promoters of rotoscoping (called Eclair by Russian animators after the Eclair video projector). Between 1948 and 1960 he produced a number of fairy tale adaptations that made excessive use of this technology to the point that actors who posed for the characters could be easily spotted. He stated that the use of realistic characters in a fairy tale would only emphasize on the fantasy element. His films of that time received numerous awards at the international film festivals, including the 1949 Czech Film Festival at Mariánské Lázně (Best Children's Film for Rainbow-Flower), the 1951 Karlovy Vary International Film Festival (Best Animatied Film for The Tale of the Fisherman and the Fish) and the 1960 Mar del Plata International Film Festival (The Silver Oak Leaf for The Frog Princess).Mar del Plata International Film Festival 1960 at MUBI With Fox, Beaver and the Rest (1960) Mikhail and Vera Tsekhanovsky started to make a return to their experimental past. Two satirical fables by Sergey Mikhalkov were presented by the author himself who was holding two pieces of paper with the drawn characters coming to life. In two years the couple released The Wild Swans based on H. C. Andersen's fairy tale which became the first Soviet widescreen animated feature. It was drawn in an original \\"formalistic\\" manner with a heavy Gothic influence.Max Zherebchevsky: \\"I create all kind of wonders out of fear\\" interview with an art director, August 30, 2012 (in Russian) Tsekhanovsky's last film — Post (1964) — was a straight-up remake of his first animated work. Also made as a traditionally animated widescreen short, it was seen by critics as a tribute to the constructivism traditions and featured many scenes borrowed directly from the 1929 version, as well as some of the original music. Mikhail Tsekhanovsky died on June 22, 1965 and was buried in Moscow. He was survived by his wife Vera Tsekhanovskaya (25 December 1902 — 25 April 1977) who preserved her husband's diaries kept since the 1920s. In 2014 MasterFilm company released a documentary In Pursuit of the Lost Post where two specialists of the Moscow Film Research Institute — Nikolai Izvolov and Sergei Kapterev — traveled around the world, trying to find the fragments of the 1930 version of Post which had been considered to be lost.

She founded the Calliope Poetry Theatre in 1971 and ran it until 1978. Her poetry-and-jazz concert with Eric Dolphy in 1962 was one of the first of its kind.  Biography  She was born in Philadelphia on November 13, 1918, the youngest of twelve children of Italian immigrant parents. Her father was a tailor. Jessica Dragonette (1900–1980), the semiclassical singer and radio star, was her cousin. She had a son, Reed, with her first husband, Charles Dye; with her second husband, John Corsiglia, she had three children, Juanita, John, and Ralph. In the late 1940s she moved to New York City, where she began giving and organizing poetry readings at the Harlequin, Le Metro, Les Deux Megots, and other venues. A childhood friend of the writer, Theodore Sturgeon, in Philadelphia, she lived with him in New York in 1946. _Thunder and Roses, Volume IV, The Complete Stories of Theodore Sturgeon_ , 356 She was known as a powerful reader; writer D. H. Melhem recalled that she had a magnificent voice. Often described as a metaphysical poet, in the 1960s Dragonette was also known as a jazz poet. Her 1962 concert with the Eric Dolphy Quintet at New York's Town Hall, arranged by Martin Mitchell and Ross Fagin, was \\"unprecedented,\\" according to Calvin C. Hernton. Writing in Down Beat magazine, critic Bill Coss called it \\"the first big- league combination of the two art forms that has had moments of true brilliance.\\" Dolphy spent several months composing original music in response to four of Dragonette's poems; one of these compositions, \\"Mandrake,\\" is included on his album Iron Man (1963). Poet Lorenzo Thomas recalled decades later that although \\"the Dolphy/Dragonette collaboration was special in terms of its artistic achievement,\\" it was also \\"typical of the kind of interdisciplinary and interracial artistic exchange available on the Lower East Side in the early 1960s.\\" After her second marriage ended, Dragonette worked at various jobs to support her children, often going for long periods without writing. In the early 1970s she moved to a subsidized apartment in the Westbeth Artists Community in Greenwich Village, where she held readings, ran the Calliope Poetry Theater, edited a poetry magazine called Voice Media, and taught a poetry workshop at the Greenwich House Music School. During the last few years of her life, she mentored and encouraged many younger writers, including Vera Lachmann, Ed Sanders, Daniela Gioseffi, Hugh Seidman, Stanley Barkan, Honor Moore, Glen Kappy, and D. H. Melhem. She died of cancer on January 18, 1979. Her poetry has been published in many journals and anthologies, including Emily Dickinson: Letters from the World, ed. Marguerite Harris (Corinth Books, 1970) and The Dream Book: An Anthology of Writings by Italian American Women, ed. Helen Barolini (Schocken Books, 1985). A recording of her poem, \\"From the Valley of the Shadows,\\" is included on New Jazz Poets (Folkways Records, 1967).

A significant event for the DIY music scene of the Czech Republic and the punk subculture of Europe, it is associated with movements such as veganism, anarchism, feminism, anti-fascism, and straight edge. It features an international lineup of bands from diverse punk rock genres including hardcore, crust punk, emo, and grindcore, as well as talks and zines. Catering is provided by local animal rights organization Svoboda zvířat. Fluff originated from Y2K HC Fest, an event organized in August 2000 in Plzeň by Michal Kočan and Tomáš Kadlec. They renamed it for the 2001 edition and moved it to the Rokycany airfield in 2006. Attendance exceeded 3000 by 2012, when a free side stage called Psych Tent was established outside the paid festival entrance. Organized by Jakub Ďuraško of Stoned to Death Records, it has spearheaded the inclusion of more experimental rock and electronic music into the lineup. Fluff currently runs for four days, starting on Thursday with a free warm-up and ending on Sunday night. Additional shows are held in Prague on Thursday and Monday. Location Rokycany townscape in July 2015. The airfield lies just beyond the centre-left forest. Rokycany is a town with a population of just over 14,000, located 17 km east of the regional capital Plzeň. The Rokycany airfield is within walking distance of the town centre and train station. Two paths can be taken from the station: the more frequented one passes by the town's swimming pool (which is very popular with the festival audiences on hot days) while the slightly faster one leads through a forest and hillside which is a protected natural area. The airfield lies between this forest and a highway. Fluff Fest has been described as a \\"strain\\" on Rokycany, which is not otherwise frequented by foreign visitors and subculture members. It brings a business boom to the town, especially in sales of vegetarian and vegan food. The Czech police, including local municipal units, road units, and investigative units, monitor Fluff with the stated goal of preventing crime, tackling theft, and making sure transportation runs smoothly. Theft of cash, credit cards, mobile phones, and cameras has been an issue on the campsite and the organizers pay to remove graffiti from buildings and rented equipment each year. Nevertheless, Michal Kočan stated in a 2013 interview that unlike in Plzeň where the festival was originally held, few complaints from the residents have reached the organizers and their relationship with the local authorities, who appreciate the international attention that the festival brings, is generally positive. In a 2011 interview, Kočan reflected that the festival's location in the Czech Republic serves as a meeting point between \\"tired\\" Western Europe where hardcore punk scenes are oversaturated and \\"raw\\" Eastern Europe where they are still forming. In 2013, he confirmed that he hopes to showcase more Eastern European bands at future editions. History Vitamin X and Birds in Row have played Fluff four times while Heaven Shall Burn, Good Clean Fun, Endstand, Rise and Fall, Victims, Raein, Dangers, Loma Prieta, and Graf Orlock have appeared three times. Y2K HC Fest Around 1996/1997, Michal Kočan, Tomáš Kadlec, and Míra Kafka visited Ieperfest in Belgium for the first time and decided to organize their own hardcore punk festival. In 1999, the techno- oriented venue Exist formed in Plzeň, entrusted with the premises of a former swimming pool. The building included a hall with a capacity of about 500 and the adjacent ground provided a large camping area, which allowed Kočan and Kadlec to start planning Y2K HC Fest in the summer of 1999. They spent all their savings on the event and enlisted the help of close friends, forming the core festival crew which has stayed intact since. Y2K was held on 4–6 August 2000 with some 1000 attending and over 30 bands performing, including Good Clean Fun, Point of No Return, Cripple Bastards, Heaven Shall Burn, and numerous Czech ones. Perhaps a week prior, the police seized the premises due to Exist's connection to the drug trafficking present in the techno scene, the club's owner having been arrested. Finally, they allowed Kočan and Kadlec to go through with the festival and even pressured the city to grant them a camping area. Although the amount of work involved led the duo to decide that it would be a one-off event, they reconsidered due to positive feedback and the number of contacts they had already made. Kadlec has been responsible for the festival lineup ever since. Fluff Fest 2001 The 2001 edition was held on 3–5 August at the Plzeň exhibition ground and drew perhaps 2000 visitors. It was organized by Kočan and Kadlec along with their English translator Jenny and some 15 friends who worked at the festival from about 2 days prior. They named it after Bellybutton Fluff, a name under which they had promoted shows at the 007 club in Strahov, Prague from 1997 until 2000. They decided to advertise Fluff Fest only within hardcore punk scenes: online, in zines, and through posters and flyers. Performing bands included Vitamin X, Heaven Shall Burn, Caliban, Endstand, and Cataract. At the Vitamin X show, a conflict between stage-diving audience members and organizers who sought to prevent damage to on-stage gear resulted in an early finish. The festival kept moving around Plzeň for 5 years until it settled in Rokycany. Fluff Fest 2002 The 2002 edition was held on 2–4 August and closed by Point of No Return and Good Clean Fun. Fluff Fest 2003 The 2003 edition was held on 1–3 August. Performing bands included Caliban, Deadlock, I Shot Cyrus and Nueva Ética. Fluff Fest 2004 The 2004 edition was held on 23–25 July. Performing bands included Heaven Shall Burn, Analena, the Idoru, and Endstand. The zine library as well as a large number of distro stalls had become features of the festival, as had movie screenings and dance after-parties. Disputes with area owners and the police over camping took place. Fluff Fest 2005 The 2005 edition was held on 15–17 July. Performing bands included Walls of Jericho, the Ocean, Deadlock, and Purified in Blood. Fluff Fest 2006 The 2006 edition was held on 21–23 July, having moved from Plzeň to the Rokycany airfield. It drew about 2500 visitors to a lineup which included Good Clean Fun, 31Knots, the Suicide File, Rise and Fall, and Endstand. The Cinema Tent was established, screening documentaries on topics pertaining also to human rights and music. A few people who worked on the event questioned the DIY ethic of Kočan and Kadlec due to estimating that the duo's final income was about 755,000 Kč, after subtracting expenses of over 550,000 Kč (including €300 for New Winds, €300 for Good Clean Fun, and €500 for the Suicide File) from their estimated gross income of 1,310,000 Kč. They argued that Kočan and Kadlec sought to profit from the festival and should have given more to workers, benefit campaigns, and bands. They also noted that Svoboda zvířat made perhaps 130,000 Kč selling food. In a 2011 interview, Kočan suggested that this criticism was unfounded and stemmed from a personal grudge, and that if it had led to a major backlash they may have abolished the festival. Fluff Fest 2007 The 2007 edition was held on 20–22 July. Performing bands included Maroon and 108 on Friday, Victims, Set Your Goals, and Vitamin X on Saturday, and La Quiete, Oi Polloi, Rise and Fall, These Arms Are Snakes, and Converge on Sunday. Various workshops were held throughout the festival. Fluff Fest 2008 The 2008 edition was held on 25–27 July, preceded by a welcome movie screening on Thursday 24 July. Performing bands included War from a Harlots Mouth, Meneguar, and Raein on Friday, Daïtro and Maroon on Saturday, and Cataract, Amenra, Death by Stereo, and Bane on Sunday. Side stages had been introduced, including the Arty Tent. Fluff Fest 2009 The 2009 edition was held on 24–26 July and drew about 3000 visitors. Performing bands included Trial, An Albatross, Have Heart, Victims, Ratos de Porão, Fall of Efrafa, Analena, Antillectual, and Rise and Fall. An After- Fluff was held at 007 on Monday 27 July. Fluff Fest 2010 The 2010 edition was held on 23–25 July, preceded by a welcome movie screening on Thursday 22 July. Various movies were screened throughout the festival. Performing bands included Carpathian, Comadre, and Ruiner on Friday, Ampere and Amenra on Saturday, and Cruel Hand and Municipal Waste on Sunday. Fluff Fest 2011 The 2011 edition was held on 22–24 July and drew about 3000 visitors. Announced acts included Ceremony, La Dispute, Black Breath, the Carrier, Blue Note, Victims, Touché Amoré, Ensign, Raein, Rosetta, Polar Bear Club, Dangers, and Joe Lally. Additionally, a diverse group of Czech bands performed. Amnesty International appeared among organizations presenting themselves at the festival. The Cinema Tent held screenings and talks pertaining largely to human and animal rights topics. It also held some electronic and hip hop shows. For the first time, a large share of the main lineup appeared on a second tent stage aside from the classic main stage. The organizers got into a disagreement with their portable toilet provider, leading to a low standard of toilet service which lasted into the next year. Fluff Fest 2012 The 2012 edition was held on 20–22 July. The core crew consisted of about 20 people, joined by 50 to 100 volunteers who helped clean the area in exchange for free entry. An extra food stall was set up, working in benefit of Svoboda zvířat and providing \\"slightly more expensive but higher quality food\\". Performing bands included Verse, Pianos Become the Teeth, Trapped Under Ice, Defeater, Self Defense Family, Loma Prieta, Code Orange Kids, Landscapes, Graf Orlock, No Omega, and Light Bearer. Movies were screened at the Cinema Tent, organized by realitaTV, a group monitoring the treatment of animals in commercial use. The Psych Tent appeared as a side stage for the first time, organized by Stoned to Death Records, a label which had just been founded by Jakub Ďuraško in Prague. There were calls to cancel Defeater's appearance due to their raising funds for the Wounded Warrior Project. Kadlec and guitarist Jake Woodruff exchanged emails in which Woodruff stated that the band members are anti-war, and that the description of soldiers as \\"heroes fighting for our nation's freedom\\" in their press release was not written by them and was worded poorly. Upon performing, Defeater said nothing on the issue to the audience and were whistled off stage by anarchist protesters before the end of their set. Reflecting on the festival in a 2013 interview, Kočan said that although attendances have grown organically with each edition, he would like to \\"keep as close as possible to the atmosphere of a small punk club show\\", suggesting \\"70–100 bands on 3 or 4 stages\\" plus an open stage as an adequate size limit. He stated that he would rather focus on increasing lineup diversity, quality of services, and the presence of politics and non-musical activities than on getting bigger names on the bill, doubting that Madball or Agnostic Front would ever appear. He envisioned the festival as a space for discussion within hardcore punk, open to anyone who wishes to set up a stall or otherwise present their ideas, which is why Defeater's appearance was not banned. Kočan also noted that while most of the crew work with the touring company Fluffwheels, which has been connected to the festival since the start, he quit this day job to work towards opening a venue in Prague, which opened under the name Underdogs' in the Smíchov district in late 2016. Fluff Fest 2013 The 2013 edition was held on 25–28 July and drew audiences of between 6000 and 8000. For the first time, bands also performed on Thursday, with We Came Out Like Tigers closing this warm-up. Other bands included Code Orange Kids, Harm's Way, Circle Takes the Square, and Full of Hell on Friday, Downfall of Gaia, Brutality Will Prevail, Dangers, and Vitamin X on Saturday, and Mouth of the Architect, the Black Heart Rebellion, Birds in Row, Coliseum, and Strike Anywhere on Sunday. Side stages included Psych Tent II and the first Queer Noises Tent, oriented on electronic music. A speech on the contemporary anarchist movement was given by Brian D. of CrimethInc. while Greg Bennick held a workshop on becoming a hardcore punk vocalist/lyricist. Refundable cups had been introduced to reduce the environmental impact of the event. Fluff14 The 2014 edition was held on 24–27 July and closed by We Came Out Like Tigers, No Omega, Backtrack, D.O.A., and Bane on Sunday. Side stages included Psych Tent III, which was performed by Andrea Belfi on Friday, and Queer Noises Tent 2. Large numbers of activist stalls had become a feature of the festival area. A Pre-Fluff matinée was held at Café na půl cesty on Thursday 24 July. Fluff15 The 2015 edition was held on 23–26 July. Performing bands included Raein, Endpoint, 7 Seconds, Loma Prieta, Trial, MDC, Birds in Row, Dangers, and Svalbard. Movies were screened already on Thursday. Side stages included Psych Tent IV, Queer Noises Tent 3, a grindcore-oriented stage, and an open stage. Fluff16 The 2016 edition was held on 21–24 July. Performing bands included Oathbreaker, Earth Crisis, Graf Orlock, Blacklisted, RVIVR, Rosetta, Totem Skin, Petrol Girls, Archivist, the Black Heart Rebellion, Dawn Ray'd, Swain, No Omega, and Jungbluth, while La Quiete were announced but had to cancel. A petition to ban Earth Crisis' appearance due to some members' alleged anti-abortion views was dismissed by Kadlec as nonsensical. Side stages included Psych Tent V, Queer Noises Tent 4, a grindcore-oriented stage, and an open stage. Fluff17 The 2017 edition was held on 20–23 July and headlined by Heaven in Her Arms, Doom, and City of Caterpillar on Friday, Vitamin X, Burn, and Chokehold on Saturday, and Racetraitor, Birds in Row, and Sect on Sunday. Side stages included: Psych Tent VI; the grindcore-oriented All Go/No Slow stage; an open stage; the Underdogs' Tent, which was curated by a different promoter each night; and the Infoshop Tent, which held acoustic performances on Friday (including Jonah Matranga) and Sunday (including Throw Me off the Bridge, the project of Birds in Row bassist Quentin Sauvé). On Saturday, the Infoshop first held talks including a speech by Greg Bennick and a discussion on the SHAC campaign, before staging several hip hop shows by Czech and Slovak acts. Fluff 2018 The 2018 edition was held on 26–29 July and headlined by Listener, Swain, and Morrow on Friday, Hexis, Ruiner, and Majority Rule on Saturday, and Suffocate for Fuck Sake, Monarch, and Loma Prieta on Sunday. All side stages continued from 2017 except the Underdogs' Tent. The Infoshop Tent held talks on topics such as direct action and gender during the day and acoustic performances at night; Greg Bennick co-led a mental health workshop oriented on depression and suicide support there on Sunday following a main stage speech on Saturday. Fluff 2019 The 20th anniversary 2019 edition was held on 25–28 July. For the first time, shows were also held in Prague, at the organizers' own venue, Underdogs', on Thursday 25 July (headlined by Listener) and Monday 29 July (headlined by Birds in Row). In Rokycany, the main lineup was headlined by Thou on Friday, Ceremony on Saturday, and the Body on Sunday. The open stage was cancelled to give more space to the Infoshop Tent and the Zine Library in the early afternoons, but All Go/No Slow, Psych Tent VIII, and the Infoshop continued as side stages.

PDf fulltext In 2017 Agnolín and colleagues perform a phylogenetic analysis of these genera in addition to the newly discovered Australornis and Vegavis, the latter genus of which a more complete specimen has been found. This allowed the team to do anatomical comparisons between these genera. They have found support of them making up a family of birds showing specializations to diving, classified as the sister taxon to crown Anseriformes. This is evidence that some families of modern birds have crossed the K–Pg boundary unaffected by the extinction event that occurred. The authors also stated this is further evidence of Gondwana having an important role for the evolution of modern birds. Another 2017 paper by Worthy et al. that focuses on the evolution and phylogenetic relationships of giant fowl has found weak support in finding the vegaviids to be the sister taxon to Gastornithiformes (which the authors included Gastornithidae and mihirungs in the order). In the description and phylogenetic placement of Maaqwi from Sandy et al. (2017) found an alternative position for vegaviids where the data supported placing them as stem-birds in the more exclusive clade Ornithurae. If so this would significantly imply vegaviids were the only group of stem- birds to have survived the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event alongside modern or crowned birds. In 2018 Mayr and colleagues did a review of vegaviid systematics stating that while Vegavis and Polarornis are sister genera based on overall similarities in their femur and tibiotarsal bones, the inclusion of the other species is poorly supported and may not be vegaviids at all. Furthermore, comparison of the plesiomorphic traits of the pterygoid and the mandible does not seem to firmly established anseriform or galloanserine affinities for Vegaviidae. Mayr et al. (2018) commented to try and classify all southern hemisphere birds into a single clade is premature as it may not illustrate the complex relationships and the convergent evolution birds have undergone.

IFC Research Bioinformatics and computational biology Boguski's work in computational biology has, over the years, involved algorithm development (e.g. Gibbs sampler, text mining), database design, development and implementation (dbEST, XREFdb, ArrayDB) and data mining, data analysis and data annotation. One database effort in particular, the database of Expressed Sequence Tags (dbEST, 1993), has enjoyed a particularly influential life contributing first to gene discovery and subsequently to succeeding generations of genomics applications, namely transcript mapping, design and construction of microarrays, discovery in silico of single nucleotide polymorphisms and, ultimately, analysis and annotation of the human genome. Genome and proteome research *Comparative Genomics & Evolution - Boguski's group first coined the term comparative genomics in 1995 to describe their work on the large-scale sequence analysis of the homologs of human disease genes in model organisms and the first comparative genomics database, XREFdb. Over the next six years they studied thousands of gene sets in humans, rats, mice, Drosophila, nematodes and yeast and established the basic evolutionary parameters for interpretation of conserved protein-encoding genes in the human genome. *Transcript Mapping - Clusters of human genes and ESTs (“UniGenes”) were utilized to construct the first comprehensive transcript map of the human genome (1996, 1998). Historically, this was the first instance of Science magazine using the World Wide Web to publish results, provide hyper-linked information resources and supplemental data sets. These maps facilitated and accelerated the positional cloning of hundreds of genes and this mapping approach was widely applied to other organisms. *Functional Genomics - Boguski's group used human UniGenes to design and construct the first human cDNA microarray (representing 10,000 genes) and were first to provide a rigorous definition of functional genomics for the community. While on sabbatical at NHGRI, their group implemented the first relational database and analysis system, ArrayDB, for microarray data. This design was copied by numerous academic and commercial groups. Their group was also first to apply methods of statistical text-mining to the interpretation of gene expression profiles. In the 2001 Genome Issue of Nature, they immediately followed the first publication of the human genome sequence with a paper showing how to use microarray technology to experimentally annotate and correct computational gene predictions. *Pharmacogenomics - They cloned and sequenced the pregnane X receptor (PXR) gene that encodes the key transcription factor regulating the expression of genes encoding drug and xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes. They also identified functional sequence polymorphisms in the promoters of these genes, cytochromes P450 3A (CYP3A), and studied the genotypes and corresponding molecular phenotypes in several populations differing in their drug-metabolizing abilities. *Neurogenomics - They pioneered the application of genome-scale approaches to neurobiology with the construction of a comprehensive, 3-dimensional transcript map of the mouse brain, the Allen Brain Atlas. *Proteomics and Knowledge Mining - At Novartis, Boguski's division was responsible for the application of proteomics technologies and computational knowledge-mining Systems Biology for drug target and biomarker discovery  References  External links *Mark Boguski’s website Year of birth missing (living people) Living people Washington University School of Medicine alumni Johns Hopkins University faculty Harvard Medical School faculty Johns Hopkins University alumni Members of the National Academy of Medicine ","title":"Mark Boguski"},{"id":"55473210","text":"Tydskrif vir Letterkunde (English: Journal for Literature) is a peer-reviewed academic journal covering African literature.

Coetzee.Coetzee, A.J. 1949. In Nienaber, P.J. Hier is ons skrywers! Johannesburg: Afrikaanse Pers Boekhandel. Originally, the journal was known as Die Afrikaanse boek. In 1936 it became the journal for the \\"Afrikaanse Skrywersvereniging\\".Stander, J. 2011. 75 jaar van Tydskrif vir Letterkunde – 'n voorlopige verkenning. In Tydskrif vir Letterkunde, 48(2):5-8. The Skrywerskring was founded in Johannesburg and its goal was to positively promote the Afrikaans literature and arts. The journal's title was soon changed to Jaarboek van die Afrikaanse Skrywersvereniging. It held this title until 1950. The first editions were compiled by C.M. van den Heever, and other prominent writers that were part of the Skrywerskring. The group did not allow any women to join the group. Elisabeth Eybers, a poet who was not allowed to join the group, once described it as: \\"Die Johannesburgse Vereniging vir Manlike Belangstellendes in Letterkunde\\" [The Johannesburg Association for Men interested in Literature]. Along with its establishment in 1934, the Skrywerskring was affiliated with the International PEN-club, A World Association of Writers. Today, this club still sees the protection of the author's intellectual property as very important.PEN International. 2014. PEN International Copyright Manifesto. http://www.pen-international.org/pen-international-copyright-manifesto/# In order to establish a democratic society, the club recognised that it was also important for writers be able to freely express themselves so that a diverse body of voices can be heard. When the National Party (NP) came to power in 1948 they strictly upheld the apartheid policy. The Skrywerskring, however, was careful to not be too opinionated about or critical toward any political events. They did not want to attract the attention of parliament or any prominent societal figures.Roos, H. 2012. Tydskrif vir Letterkunde: 75 jaar. In Tydskrif vir Letterkunde, 49(1):2012. The main focus of the Skrywerskring was to create a dialogue about literature, not a polemical dialogue about social or political events. During a congress in 1948 PEN members raised questions about discrimination inherent in apartheid policies. This created a tension between the Skrywerskring and PEN members and after some time the Skrywerskring withdrew its membership from the PEN-club. Under the editorship of C.M. van den Heever, the journal was renamed to Tydskrif vir Letterkunde in 1951. It was also published quarterly. Van den Heever was the editor-in-chief for 21 years until his death in 1957. In the 1960s a once-off edition was published with the title 60 and the subtitle Tydskrif vir Letterkunde. Abel Coetzee was the editor-in-chief. The title 60 echoed the literary movement of the time and joined in with the voices of some of the most prominent writers of that time. The next edition that was published carried the title of Tydskrif vir Letterkunde and has continued to do so in the editions published since. An edition that was published in 1963 voiced Coetzee's approval of the censure policy: \\"Waar dit nou in ons volksgemeenskap gebeur dat die uiterste vryheid van bepaalde kunstenaars in bepaalde rigtings in beslag gelê is moet ons as verantwoordelike volksgenote aanvaar dat die staatsbestuurlike funksionele groep dreigende gevare vir die gemeenskap sien groei, wat net op die manier bekamp kan word. Ons moet aanneem dat die optrede in goeie trou geskied en dat inperkinge óf net tydelik sal wees, óf net in die allernoodsaaklikste gevalle toegepas sal word\\"Coetzee, A. J. 1963. Die skrywer en die gemeenskap teenoor mekaar. In Tydskrif vir Letterkunde, (Nuwe reeks), 1(III): 6-11. [\\"As citizens we should accept that the [censorship] group appointed, is assessing growing concerns for the community and acting upon it. This is in reference to the freedom of certain artists in certain directions that has been seized. We must accept that the actions taken are done in good faith and that any impingements will only be temporary or will only be applied in the most extreme circumstances.\\"]  Tydskrif vir Letterkunde on censure and finances  In its early history Tydskrif vir Letterkunde received a lot of criticism because it accepted money from the central government to finance the journal. The journal also received finances from the Afrikaanse Persfonds (a trust established from the personal funds of general J.B.M. Hertzog). In 1976 the funds were stopped because the trustees of the Persfonds felt the money would be better suited for other purposes, as they explained to the then editor-in-chief Elize Botha. Botha would seek other financial means and the Nasionale Pers Ltd would provide financial support until 2001. From 2001 all funds are raised by advertisements and authors' page fees. The policy over publications that was enforced by the NP led to a careful reaction by the Skrywerskring. They did not want to upset the authorities who were providing financial support for the journal. Initially there were also members of the Skrywerskring associated with the censuring activities. Someone like N. P. van Wyk Louw opposed the censure policy from the start. He also published debates around the censure policy in the journal Standpunte. Only in the 1970s did the Skrywerskring and Tydskrif react to the \\"Wysigingswet op Publikasiebeheer\\". This law meant that an appeal to the censuring of a work could be delivered to court. Today Tydskrif is strongly opposed against any measure that could impede freedom of speech. It also does not tolerate any form of publication management that could affect the being of the South African democracy.Willemse, H. 2011. Tydskrif vir Letterkunde: ’n Aaneenlopende rekord van 75 jaar. In Tydskrif vir Letterkunde, 48(2):13-30.  Tydskrif vir Letterkunde and Standpunte  Between the two journals Tydskrif vir Letterkunde and Standpunte there was a so-called North-South literary division. This was based on a geographic division between the North, known previously as the Transvaal, and the South, the current Western Cape. The first edition of Standpunte was published in 1945. It was important for the editorial members to create a platform where there was no external influence on the discussion of Afrikaans literature. The last edition of Standpunte appeared in 1986. Elize BothaBotha, E. and Roodt, P. H. 2006. Die Tagtigers en die Tydskrif vir Letterkunde – was daar 'n Tagtigerbeweging? In Tydskrif vir Letterkunde, 43(1):57-67. said over this division: \\"Vir baie jare het die persepsie bestaan dat Standpunte 'n ‘suidelike' literêre beskouing onderhou, en die Tydskrif 'n ‘noordelike' – wat dit presies beteken het, wil ek hier nie probeer uitlê nie; daar was in elk geval in die vroeë dekades van die tydskrifte se geskiedenis aanvoelbare spanning tussen die groepering rondom die Louws, en dié rondom C.M. van den Heever en sy vriend en kollega Abel Coetzee. Later het die spanning Noord-Suid een van die gemeenplase in literêre gesprekke geword.\\" [\\"For many years there was the perception that Standpunte held a southern literary viewpoint and that Tydskrif held a northern literary viewpoint. It is difficult to explain exactly what this means, but there was a palpable tension in the early decades of the two journals' existence. That is, there was a tension between the Louws on the one side and C.M. van den Heever and his colleague and friend Abel Coetzee on the other side. Later this tension would become a platitude in literary conversations.\\"]  Editors-in- chief  Coenie Rudolph.Rudolph, C. n.d. National Afrikaans Literary Museum and Research Centre (NALN). http://www.culturalheritageconnections.org/wiki/National_Afrikaans_Literary_Museum_and_Research_Centre_(NALN)From 1966 to 1973 Coenie Rudolph was the editor-in-chief of the journal. Rudolph was a writer who lived in Pretoria and was also a lecturer in education. Under his editorship many new, creative voices were published such as Abraham H. de Vries, Hennie Aucamp, Ingrid Jonker and Chris Barnard. Elize Botha was appointed as Rudolph's successor in 1973. Botha was a South African academic and literary critic. She lectured at, among others, the University of South Africa and the University of Pretoria. Botha's appointment was quite a remarkable event as women were not previously allowed to be members of the Skrywerskring. The journal was very successful under Botha's editorship. Many new writers and poets debuted in the journal such as Lina Spies and P.J. Haasbroek. A new generation of \\"Tagtigers\\" also published in the journal during this time. In 1992 , a writer, poet and Hertzog prize winner, was appointed as the new editor-in-chief of Tydskrif vir Letterkunde. He was editor-in-chief for 10 years, until 2002. During this time, the Skrywerskring also disbanded. Hein Willemse became editor-in-chief in 2003. Willemse is a South African academic, literary critic, activist and author. He brought a few changes to the journal. The journal now has a focus on a broad variety of African literature and editors and collaborators were appointed in Africa, North America and Europe. Because of the work with editors and collaborators of other countries, the journal's language policy was changed to not only include Afrikaans, but also Dutch, English and French. The format of the journal was adapted to mainly peer-reviewed scholarly articles and the journal is no longer published quarterly but bi-annually. Since 2016 the journal has only been published electronically. Only electronic submissions are accepted.

Dedicated to teaching, missionary work, and temperance reform, she served as professor of French and belles-lettres in the Ohio Wesleyan College; presided over and addressed the first public meeting ever held in Cleveland conducted exclusively by religious women; co-founded the Western Reserve School of Design (later, Cleveland Institute of Art); and was a charter member of the order of the Daughters of the American Revolution. Early years and education Mary Bigelow Janes was born in Mansfield, Ohio, March 10, 1832. Her parents, of Revolutionary ancestry, were from Vermont. Her father, Rev. John Janes, Jr. was a pioneer Methodist Minister in Ohio and Michigan. He also owned a book store in Norwalk, Ohio on the site later occupied by the Norwalk National Bank, and the Avalon Hotel. Her mother, Hannah Brown, was one of the founders of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Ann Arbor, Michigan. John Janes. Sr. (paternal grandfather), and Daniel Brown, Sr. (maternal grandfather), lived in Vermont, each was the father of 12 children. John Janes, Sr., emigrated to Delaware County, Ohio while Daniel Brown settled in Ann Arbor, Michigan Territory. John Janes, Jr., became a Methodist preacher, traveling Detroit Circuit. Two daughters of Daniel Brown, Sr., Rebecca and Hannah B., organized the nucleus of the First Methodist Episcopal Church of Ann Arbor, their father and brother Daniel aiding the establishment of Michigan University. John Janes, Jr. married Hannah B. Brown, their marriage occurring in May, 1828. In time, they became parents of five children, which included Mary B.; Eliza R. (died young); Emma, was a professor in Central California, later becoming a writer and journalist in Washington, D.C.; and Frank, who went into the railroads business. As a very young child, Ingham was a pupil in Lizzie T. Higgins’ School. At nine years of age, she was placed me in Latin Grammar at the SEminary, which she attended with Mary Watrous, Mary Tuttle, and Mary Beardsley. Later on, Lawyer Curtis drilled Ingham in Virgil at her home. Ingham also attended Norwalk Seminary and Baldwin Institute. Career Mary Ingham, 1888 or earlier. Educator In 1850, at the age of 18, Ingham went to Cleveland, Ohio, as a teacher in the public schools. She served as assistant principal at Norwalk North Grammar School and Rockwell School of Cleveland. During a portion of the six years spent there, she boarded and studied in the family of Madame Pierre Gollier, learning to speak the French language fluently. Appointed professor of French and belles-lettres in the Ohio Wesleyan College for young ladies, in Delaware, Ohio, she applied herself to the study of German, adding thereto Spanish and Italian, and received from her alma mater the honorary degree of M. L. A. She retired from her teaching career in 1866. Social and religious activist On March 22, 1866, she married William A. Ingham (died 1898), and removed to Cleveland. In 1870, she was chosen to inaugurate in northern Ohio the work of the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society. She presided over and addressed the first public meeting ever held in the city of Cleveland conducted exclusively by religious women. Afterward, she addressed large audiences in the various cities of Ohio, in Baltimore, Washington D.C., Buffalo, New York City, New Haven, and Minneapolis, upon the needs of the women of foreign lands. In March, 1874, being in charge of the praying community of her own city, she led for six weeks a very successful temperance crusade and was among the most active of Cleveland women in establishing inns, reading-rooms and chapels. She became chairman of the Pearl street inn, which for seven years did great work in the evangelization of the masses in the 9th, 10th and 11th wards of Cleveland. She was one of the original committee members in Chautauqua, New York that projected in August, 1874 the formation of the National Woman's Christian Temperance Union. That organizing convention met in Ingham's city on November 18–20, 1874. Ingham served as treasurer of the national organization (1874–75), though she was primarily affiliated with the local chapter in Cleveland. Ingham was one of the founders of the Western Reserve School of Design. She was a charter member of the order of the Daughters of the American Revolution, and also of the Cleveland Sorosis, modeled upon that of the New York Sorosis organization. Writer Writing was always a favorite pastime with Ingham. At age 10, her first article was published in the Norwalk \\"Reflector.\\" While in Delaware, encouraged by Professor W. G. Williams, she wrote her first story, for which he gave her the subject, \\"Something to Come Home To,\\" receiving for it US$15 from The Ladies' Repository. That was followed by other articles. For the Cleveland \\"Leader\\", she wrote letters from the United States and Europe. Her letters from Florida in 1882 contained very accurate descriptions of natural scenery in the land of flowers. In 1880, at the request of the management of the \\"Leader,\\" she began, in a series of articles covering three years' space, the \\"History of Woman's Work in Cleveland since 1830.\\" She included, besides the founding of the four churches and a review of the principal charities, sketches under the title of the \\"Women of Cleveland.\\" Her pen-name was \\"Anne Hathaway.\\" In 1884, she wrote the history of the pioneer Methodist Episcopal Churches of Cleveland. In 1890, Ingham wrote her famous \\"Flag Festival\\", the third edition being adapted to Discovery Day. Personal life Mary Ingham, 1896. Her husband, William, was a bookseller and the senior member of a Cleveland-based publishing business, Ingham & Bragg. It became Ingham, Clarke & Co. in 1872, and their son, P.M. Ingham, was a part of that house. She continued with her religious and missionary activities after relocation to Los Angeles in 1908, and died 17 November 1923.

As a journalist he specialized in radio, and was opposed to commercialization. He was socialist deputy for Yonne from 1936 to 1942. Life Early years Paul Jean Louis Campargue was born on 21 September 1903 in Marseille. He was the son of a Marseille tax collector. He attended the Collège Sainte-Barbe in Paris for his secondary education. He became a journalist very early. He joined the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO: Section Française de l'Internationale Ouvrière). He became deputy director of the daily newspaper L'Aurore and vice-president of the Paris press union. Campargue became involved in radio, edited Mon programme and was radio columnist for Le Populaire, a socialist daily. He felt that radio was a key medium for political parties. Paul Brenot, technical director of the Compagnie générale de la télégraphie sans fil (CSF), was an advocate of privatized radio stations along the American model, as opposed to the common European approach of nationalization. Camparque attacked Brenot's position, called it the \\"American radio bluff\\" and pointed out that almost all radio frequencies, transmitter and programs in the US were controlled by a small number of powerful corporations. Campargue published an article on the \\"Police de l'Air\\" in Le Populaire on 7 March 1934. He highlighted the fact that the government was concerned about the use of ham radio and low-powered radio broadcasting to engage in subversive activities and cause political upheaval. He wrote, \\"We know precious little about the organization charged with monitoring programs of authorized radio stations and detecting transmissions from stations that do not comply with the radio authority.\\" Political career In the general elections in May 1932 Campargue played a large role in getting Georges Boully elected in the Yonne department. Campargue ran for election to the Senate for Yonne on 26 April 1936, and was elected on the second ballot on 3 May 1936. He joined the Socialist group, and sat on the Committee on Public Works and the Committee on Communications and on Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones. He was rapporteur for the 1937 bill concerning reinforcement and reorganization of personnel in the broadcasting service. At the start of World War II he was mobilized as second lieutenant of a transport unit (train des équipages). His conduct earned him a citation in the order of the day. He refrained from voting to grant constitutional powers to Marshal Petain on 10 July 1940, and left politics. He was demobilized of 5 August 1940. Later career Campargue was excluded from the Socialist Party after the Liberation of France because he had abstained from voting against the bill revising the Constitution. He did not resume political activity, but continued his career in the press and publishing. He became managing director of the Ventillard group and of the \\"Transports-presse\\" company and chairman of the \\"Auxiliaire transports-presse\\". Paul Campargue died in Paris on 14 February 1969.

The caption reads: \\"Only Authentic Portrait of Wilhelm Heinrich Sebastian Von Troomp (From the Oil Painting)\\" The Baron Trump novels are two children's novels written in 1889 and 1893 by the American author and lawyer Ingersoll Lockwood. They remained obscure until 2017, when they received media attention for perceived similarities between their protagonist and U.S. President Donald Trump. 19th century publication and reception Lockwood published the first novel, Travels and adventures of Little Baron Trump and his wonderful dog Bulger, in 1889, and its sequel, Baron Trump's Marvelous Underground Journey, in 1893. The novels recount the adventures of the German boy Wilhelm Heinrich Sebastian Von Troomp, who goes by \\"Baron Trump\\", as he discovers weird underground civilizations, offends the natives, flees from his entanglements with local women, and repeats this pattern until arriving back home at Castle Trump. The novels were part of a trend in U.S. children's literature that responded to the demand for fantastic adventure stories triggered by Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland (1865). They were, however, indifferently received and did not enter the canon of children's literature. An 1891 reviewer wrote about one of Lockwood's novels: \\"The author labors through three hundred pages of fantastic and grotesque narrative, now and then striking a spark of wit; but the sparks emit little light and no warmth, and one has to fumble for the story.\\"The Atlantic Monthly, vol. LXVII (1891), p. 131. Jaime Fuller associates this review with a Baron Trump novel, but the archives of The Atlantic indicate it was about Lockwood's apparently similar novel \\"Wonderful Deeds and Doings of Little Giant Boab and his Talking Raven Tabib\\". 2017 rediscovery In July 2017, the books were rediscovered by Internet forum users, and then the media, who pointed out similarities between the protagonist and U.S. President Donald Trump. Jaime Fuller wrote in Politico that Baron Trump is \\"precocious, restless, and prone to get in trouble\\", often mentions his massive brain, and has a personalized insult for most people he meets. Fuller also notes that Baron Trump lives in a building named after himself, \\"Castle Trump\\"; while the real-life Donald Trump had lived in Trump Tower for decades. Furthermore, Donald Trump's youngest son is named Barron Trump. Chris Riotta noted in Newsweek that Baron Trump's adventures begin in Russia. Riotta also mentioned another book of Ingersoll's, 1900; or, The Last President, in which New York City is riven by protests following the shock victory of a populist candidate in the 1896 presidential election who brings on the downfall of the American republic. As of July 2017, filmmaker and Trump supporter Leigh Scott was reported to plan a crowdsourcing campaign to produce a feature film adaptation of the Baron Trump novels.

It also bore the name of Le Tour du monde, journal des voyages et des voyageurs (1895–1914).  History  Le Tour du monde (Around the world) was created in January 1860 by Édouard Charton, designer of ', under the aegis of the Librairie Hachette : every six months, the weekly booklets sold through the network of railway stations, gathered in one volume, which was offered in bookstore. A second series was inaugurated in 1895 under the title Le Tour du monde, journal des voyages et des voyageurs (Around the World, newspaper travel and travelers): much more modern, it reproduced photographic images, rather than engravings. This weekly was aimed at a popular readership and spent its content on travel and exploration. It described in detail most of the great expeditions which marked the end of the 19th century; and early 20th, the last great period of exploration of the world by Western travelers. Fifty years span from discovering the source of the Nile in the early 1860s, to conquering the South Pole in late 1911. The magazine combined text and illustrations in the early woodcuts, which were gradually replaced by reproductions of photographs at the end of the 19th century. After July 1914, it ceased publication. In February 1930, the title was bought by Lectures pour tous.  The first 52 issues  Each edition was at least 16 pages, illustrated with engravings in black and white. On the cover would be found a single engraving under the header that blocked half the page above twin columns of print, sometimes the entire page. Inside, besides half-page prints, there were three full page prints. Text was carried on two columns.

V. A. Lechumanan Chettiar as its president and Abdul Aziz and H. M. Desai as joint-secretaries. In 1942 Aziz was elected as president of the CIC and Savumiamoorthy Thondaman as its secretary. In 1945 Thondaman defeated Aziz for the presidency of the CIC and in 1948 Aziz regained the presidency. In 1950 the CIC was renamed to the Ceylon Workers' Congress (CWC). In November 1955 the leadership clashes between Aziz and Thondamon came to a head, with Aziz's election as the president of the CWC and Thondaman's candidate, S. Somasundaram, appointed as party secretary, with Thondaman's loyalists voting on 22 November to expel Aziz and his supporters from the CWC. The Aziz faction subsequently formed the Democratic Workers Congress (DWC) registering the party on 1 January 1956. The DWC then joined the World Federation of Trade Unions. In 1962 a number of key DWC leaders left the party to join the Communist Party workers' union and one of the party's stalwarts, K. G. S. Nair, died of a heart attack. In 1968 M. A. Thangavel and A. K. Kandasamy left the DWC and formed the Agricultural Plantation Workers Congress. Following Aziz's death in June 1990 there was another split in the DWC, with Aziz's son, Ashraf, forming the Aziz Democratic Workers Congress while the leadership of the DWC was held by V. P.

This mite feeds on members of the lily family, and has damaged garlic crops. At one time, it was also thought to feed on wheat and other grasses, but the wheat curl mite is now regarded as a different species, Aceria tosichella. Taxonomy This mite was first described in 1938 by the German zoologist Friedrich Kiefer. It was believed to be found across Europe, Asia and North America, feeding on grasses and plants in the lily family. As such, it was thought to be a vector of the wheat streak mosaic virus, but it was later realised that the mites feeding on grasses and lilies were different species, and the wheat curl mite is now classified as Aceria tosichella, with Eriophyes tulipae being restricted to bulbous plants. Description Eriophyes tulipae is a small cylindrical mite tapering towards the front and back, with an adult length of . The gnathosoma bears a pair of featherclaws by way of mouthparts. The prosoma and the opisthosoma are continuous and there are no legs or ocelli. The few setae on the body point towards the rear and there are tubercles along the rear margin of the shield. The posterior end has an anal sucker. Biology Eriophyes tulipae feeds on the green plant tissues of members of the lily family. The life cycle consists of an egg stage, two nymphal stages and an adult stage. The first stage nymph has dorsal setae that do not point towards the rear, and these change orientation at the moult at the end of this stage. In Central America, this mite is a crop pest of garlic. The mites live between the layers of the garlic cloves and inside the leaves, and form small galls. The garlic bulbs may fail to develop and the leaves may turn yellow. The mites can be dispersed by wind, having climbed to the upper parts of the plant. Distribution The dry bulb mite is found on all continents except Antarctica (Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania, South America).

The specific epithet is a tribute to Victor Nigon who first studied Caenorhabditis elegans in the laboratory with Ellsworth Dougherty in the 1940s (Nigon, 1949). Isolates come from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Kerala, India.  C. briggsae hybrids research  C. nigoni is noteworthy because it is very closely related to the hermaphroditic species, C. briggsae. Despite substantial differences between C. nigoni and C. briggsae in their modes of sexual reproduction (50:50% female:male versus 99:1% hermaphrodite:male, respectively), their genome sizes (129 Mb versus 108 Mb, respectively), and their protein-coding gene counts (29,167 versus 22,313, respectively), these two species can interbreed to produce not merely viable male and female hybrid offspring, but partially fertile female hybrid offspring. Nevertheless, hybrids between these two species are subject to Haldane's law: heterogametic offspring (males) are much less viable than females. A detailed map of hybrid incompatibility sites for the C. briggsae genome was generated in 2015. Hybrid male inviability primarily manifests itself during embryonic development and is most pronounced at lower growth temperature. Moreover, surviving C. nigoni/C. briggsae hybrid males are sterile. This sterility is at least partially caused by the presence of either of two X-chromosomal subsequences from C. briggsae, either of which is associated with abnormal transcriptional downregulation of C. nigoni autosomal genes encoding spermatogenic functions; this downregulation may be due to abnormal upregulation in hybrids of a subset of 22G RNAs specifically targeting the down-regulated spermatogenenic genes. Yin et al. (2018) have produced a third-generation genome assembly of C. nigoni, which they used to define which genes differ between the two species and to begin characterizing the functional effects of these differences. They report that most of the difference in gene count between C. nigoni and C. briggsae is due to gene losses in the latter species, that these lost genes encode (in C. nigoni) disproportionately short proteins with disproportionately high levels of male-biased RNA-seq expression, that the lost genes include three Male Secreted Short (mss) genes, and that transgenic restoration of mss-1 and mss-2 from C. nigoni to C. briggsae causes C. briggsae males to become much more effective at reproductive competition (both against other males, and against hermaphroditic self-fertilization). The differences in genome sizes are not due to bulk changes in repetitive DNA, because both genomes have closely similar fractions of repetitive elements (C. nigoni 27% versus C. briggsae 25%). However, there does exist a higher proportion of satellite DNAs in C. nigoni than in C. briggsae, along with more species-specific families of satellite DNA in C. nigoni. In parallel work using an independently produced third-generation genome assembly of C. nigoni, Ren et al. (2018) analyzed whole-genome alignments of the chromosomes of C. nigoni to C. briggsae; they report that the two genomes have broad chromosomal synteny, but also have many intra- and inter-chromosomal sequence rearrangements. These rearrangements are likely to impede meiotic recombination between chromosomes of the two species, and might also cause partial inviability and infertility of interspecies hybrids.

Players can choose to play the tactical combat game between individual units, or the larger strategic combat game between armies. Reception In the inaugural issue of Ares Magazine, Steve List was unimpressed by The Beastlord, especially as a two- or three-player game, giving it a rating of only 4 out of 9. \\"The only truly defective component is the rules booklet, which leaves out crucial information. Beast Lord is really a four-player game, and mediocre at that.\\". In the July 1980 edition of Dragon, Bill Fawcett was generally pleased by The Beastmaster. He did note that the switching between tactical and strategic combat was \\"time consuming\\", and that \\"One of the greatest drawbacks (or advantages) of this game is that it was obviously not designed to be played in a few hours. The Beastlord is most definitely a campaign game with all the attendant problems and greater degree of sophistication that the larger time scope allows.\\" He concluded that \\"[This] is a well integrated and eminently playable package... a fairly complicated game that takes a substantial commitment of time to play...

A prominent activist in the United States and the West Indies, Smith co-founded the National Maritime Union with Joseph Curran and M. Hedley Stone. By 1948 he was wanted by the U.S. Immigration Service for deportation, and is remembered as one of the most powerful black labor leaders in U.S. history. Background Ferdinand Christopher Smith was born on May 5, 1893, in Savanna-la-Mar in Westmoreland Parish, Jamaica. His father was a teacher. Career Early years Jim Crow sign for \\"colored\\" waiting room at bus station in Durham, North Carolina (1940) Smith was first a laborer (porter), then waiter in a local hotel. He left to live in Panama, where he worked as hotel steward and salesman: he first experienced Jim Crow conditions. At the end of World War I, he left to live in Cuba as a migrant laborer. He left Cuba for Mobile, Alabama, as a sailor. He worked for two decades as a ship's steward. During the 1920s, he joined the Communist-created Maritime Workers Industrial Union (MWIU). In 1936, he supported the 1936 Gulf Coast maritime workers' strike and joined its national committee. NMU Seamen in hiring hall under National Maritime Union banner, New York City (December 1941: Photograph by Arthur Rothstein) In 1937, Smith emerged as vice president during formation of the National Maritime Union, which itself reflected a rise in union activism among seaman in the wake of the 1933 Scottsboro Boys Case and the 1934 West Coast waterfront strike (led by Harry Bridges's International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union or ILWU and the West Coast Marine Cooks and Stewards or MCS), following the demise of the International Seamen's Union (ISU) and the decline of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW or \\"Wobblies\\") in the 1920s. Ironically, Smith's name came to the fore because he was tried internally by an NMU committee for failing to support the 1934 strike but later cleared the union. Smith supported non- discrimination. He pushed through a non-discrimination plank in the NMU constitution. In 1944, he had a non-discrimination pledge added to contracts with more than 100 ship companies. He supported civil rights more broadly by partaking in the National Negro Congress and Negro Labor Victory Committee. In 1940, Smith joined Chicago Alderman Earl B. Dickerson to meet with Donald M. Nelson, Chair of the War Production Board. In 1943, during a race riot in Harlem, local and federal officials asked Smith to come help ease tensions. He was also involved with maritime unions in the Caribbean and South Atlantic. In 1944, Smith had at least one major speech written for him by Frank Marshall Davis during the presidential campaign of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Also in 1944, it became public knowledge that Smith had British, not American citizenship. In 1945, he resigned as vice president left the country. He soon re-entered as a legal immigrant and became NMU secretary In 1948, the NMU expelled Smith, Paul Palazzi, and Howard McKenzie for mis-use of union funds. Also 1945, the NMU gave more money than any other union for the re-election of Benjamin J. Davis, Jr. for New York City Council. Deportation In early 1948, NMU president Joe Curran bowed to pressure and fired known communists from the NMU, including Smith. In February 1948, U.S. Immigrations arrested Smith as an illegal alien. In March 1948, Smith found himself lumped into a group of Communist party and labor leaders, headed for deportation. Lee Pressman, who had just left the CIO as general counsel, joined a group of lawyers to defend them. Pressman represented all five, at least some of whom had their own attorneys: alleged Soviet spy Gerhart Eisler (represented by Abraham J. Isserman), Irving Potash of the Fur and Leather Workers Union; Smith, secretary of the NMUM (Pressman); Charles A. Doyle of the Gas, Coke and Chemical Workers Union (Isadore Englander), and CPUSA labor secretary John Williamson (Carol Weiss King). Pressman went on to join Joseph Forer, a Washington-based attorney, in representing the five before the U.S. Supreme Court. In April 1948, Pete Seeger partook in a benefit concert for Smith's defense. By that time, according to congressional hearings in 1955, Smith was no longer vice president. On May 5, 1948, Pressman and Forer received a preliminary injunction so their defendants might have hearings with examiners unconnected with the investigations and prosecutions by examiners of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. (All attorneys were members of the National Lawyers Guild.) Last years Smith was deported. He went to live in Vienna, Austria, where he worked for the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU). In 1951 (or 1952), Smith found himself deported to Jamaica. He remained involved in union activism by organized sugar works and leading a union federation until his death in 1961. Personal and death Benjamin J. Davis, Jr. was a close friend of Smith's. Smith died on August 14, 1961, in Jamaica. Legacy In the 1943 mural The Contribution of the Negro to Democracy in America by African-American artist Charles Wilbert White, Smith appears among: Peter Salem, Nat Turner Denmark Vesey, Peter Still, Harriet Tubman, Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, George Washington Carver, Marian Anderson, Paul Robeson, and Lead Belly. \\"By placing White in the Contribution mural, White suggests the importance of organized labor to the collective uplift of African American communities, particularly given that the CIO was steadily gaining ground within the American labor movement.\\" Historian Peter Cole has assessed: > Through his position at the NMU, he [Francis Smith] gave money and spoke out > on many issues: the racist hiring practices of New York City employers, the > election of the black Communist Ben Davis to the NYC city council, the > effort to oust notoriously racist senator Theodore Bilbo of Mississippi, > etc. Other struggles were anticolonial--as when he pushed for the > independence of Puerto Rico, the Philippines, India, South Africa, and > Ghana.

The historic residence was an icon in the area, situated at the end of St Mary Street of which name of street derives from the niche on the façade of the building. The façade was notably characterized by its dark green colour which had made it a noticeable landmark. The niche of the Assumption of Our Lady, dated to 1875, is listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands (NICPMI). At one point the building was in the parameters of the Urban Conservation Area (UCA), but this status was later retired. The house was demolished in 2019, and there are plans to built thirteen residences above street level and garages below ground in its place. The landmark niche has been requested, by the Planning Authority, to be incorporated in the new building. History Sliema developed into a town during the period of British colonial rule, when townhouses were built both by the British and by the Maltese. It was common for the Maltese to build their houses in the vernacular style, mixed with some influence of the period.p. 16 The building was erected around the mid-nineteenth century to be purposely used as a residence, with the layout of a townhouse. Either from the beginning, or at one point, the façade was painted in dark Green, and houses painted similarly in the immediate vicinity are unknown today. The colour attarcts the passers by because of its unusual painted colour, and colloquially became known, as it is still known today, as Id-Dar il-Ħadra. This unofficial name translates to as The Green House. It has been an iconic building and a landmark on its own. The owners of such houses may often be better known for the type of building they live at and sometimes be nicknamed for it; such example in this case would be “The Green House owner (family)” or “The Green House resident(s)” (). The imposing niche on the façade, a listed monument Predominantly on the façade sits a Baroque niche where a statue of the Assumption of Our Lady stands. Being one of the first houses to be built in the area, the integral niche gave the name to the street that is found at, as St Mary Street. The later name was likely given as a consequence of the building being visible from different points of the street, which like the name of the house may origin from the residents's given reference. The building is, however, addressed at No. 1, St Agatha Street, exactly at the cross-section of St Mary Street. The niche received the blessing by Bishop Gaetano Pace Forno,T. (2018). Toroq Slimiżi: Triq Santa Marija. Leħen il-Banda Ċittadina 'Sliema', festa 2018, 53-55. who awarded those who prayed in front of it with indulgences. A date is written on the niche as 1875, which is an approximate indication of when the building was built. The area of the residence was declared as part of the Urban Conservation Area (UCA), for being in the historic core of Sliema. The niche was eventually listed a national monument in Sliema, being on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands (NICPMI). It was listed by the Superintendence for Cultural Heritage (SCH) in the early 21st century. The building remained a residence throughout the 20th century, after which point became uninhabited and eventually dilapidated. The building became too expensive for the owners to maintain and at the same time it because more profitable to sell to third parties for development. Furthermore, other buildings erected on sides of the building has led to damage in the foundations of the building. The owners saw it was no longer safe not feasible for use. In the 21st century the area was removed from the UCA status and, years later, the owners of the property applied with the Planning Authority (PA) for the redevelopment of the site, which showed motion to demolish the present building. The application proposes to completely destroy the building, build thirteen residences with underlying garages including a ground floor maisonette with its own entrance, eleven flats and another flat with terrace at the top. As soon as a notification (PA/03062/17) was attached to the building, the residents, conservationists and interested parties were outraged at the request of the developers. The NGO Flimkien għal Ambjent Aħjar (FAA) and the Sliema Heritage Society (SHS) opposes any development apart from the rehabilitation of the present structure. FAA spokesperson, Environmental Officer Tara Cassar, has pressured the SCH to protect the property. The SCH has agreed and called for its preservation. The SHS has said that further to the detailed niche, the interior of the building also has a decorated interior, characterized by columns at the staircase. The PA gave its opinion that had had the permission be granted it would request to conserve the entire façade, while dismantling the staircase before demolishing the interior. Based on this preposition, it would follow the concept of facadism, the staircase would be integrated again in the interior, and would destroy the backgarden. The Sliema Local Council has objected for its demolition. It is established that the demolition of previous houses has led to a domino effect, and the demolition of The Green House would create major precedence. Residents have insisted on their objection to the proposed development, even as suggested by PA, believing it would impact on them negatively and would destroy a sentimental and historic heritage. The PA made a final decision to grant the permission for the demolishion of the building in February 2019. The house was demolished in March 2019. Architecture The Green House was a two-storey building at the inter-section of two streets but is situated on one side. It had a vernacular design, with an asymmetric façade and a Maltese characteristic interior.

In 1975, due to the a new legislation of Singapore, the assets and the rights to publish Singapore edition of Sin Chew Jit Poh, was sold to Sin Chew Jit Poh (Singapore) Limited, but the descendant of the founder, the Aw family, retained some of the management shares. In 1977 Sin Chew Jit Poh (Singapore) Limited made an initial public offering to sell the ordinary shares of the company and merged to form Singapore News and Publications Limited, a predecessor of Singapore Press Holdings in 1982. History Newspapers Sin Chew Jit Poh and Sin Pin Jit Poh were founded by Chinese billionaire Aw Boon Haw in January 1929 and in 1939 respectively, in Singapore and Penang of the Straits Settlements; the publisher of Sin Chew Jit Poh was incorporated in 1928 and its parent company Sin Poh (Star News) Amalgamated Limited was incorporated in 1941.

Archaeological finds establishes that the town had an ancient history as the centre of Hindu and Jain religious faiths. Arang also finds mention in the Hindu epic Mahabharata. Arang has many Jain and Hindu temples that are dated to the 9th to 11th centuries. Archaeological excavations carried out in the town has confirmed the town's ancient history as a Hindu and Jain religious center, which prospered under the rule of Hindu kings. The ancient temples in Arang, which are tourist attractions are the Baghdeval temple, the Bhanda Dewal temple, the Mahamaya temple, the Danteshwari temple, the Chandi Maheshwari temple, the Panchmukhi Mahadev temple, and the Panchmukhi Hanuman temple. Of these, the Bhand Dewal temple and Bagh Deval temple are particularly ancient and well-known. In May 2017 an idol of Adinath (Rishabhanatha) was excavated near this temple. This idol is in height, in width and in thickness. This standing sculpture has a Yaksha and Yakshini near its knee region on two sides. The sculpture is dated to 5th-6th centuries AD. Temples Bhand Dewal temple Detailed carvings on the wall Sculptures of Jain tirthankaras Ajitanatha, Neminath and Shreyanasanatha inside Bhand Dewal Bhand Dewal temple, a Jain temple dated to the late eleventh century, is in the Mahakosala area of Arang. It is built in the Bhumija style of architecture. The plinth of this temple has detailed ornamentation. It has a socle that supports a pedestal and two rows of sculptures on the wall. The temple layout plan is in a star shape known as stellate (meaning: shaped like a star, having points, or rays radiating from a center) with six \\"offsets\\". The temple rises to five floors, which is considered an unusual feature. The temple faces west and is in a rundown condition. In the past, a mandapa (an outdoor pavilion) and a porch probably existed as part of the temple. The damaged front fascia of the temple tower has been plastered without any decoration, and also whitewashed. The north-east and south-east faces of the temple tower, which were also dilapidated, have been redone in brick and mortar, but crudely. However, the overall view of the tower is still pleasing. At some stage, this temple was used as a survey marking station. As there was a tendency for the upper half of the tower to structurally burst by its seams, a metal strap bracing has been wound around the tower at the middle section to give it stability. A similar strap has been wound round at the top of the tower. A large number of images are carved on the exterior and interior faces of the temple. The bigger images are carved in two lines. Above the lines of bigger images, a row of carvings of smaller images has been sculpted. At the base of the larger images is a row of a highly decorated depiction of inscription panels, flowers, and a royal march of horses, animals, and people. The exterior faces of the temple have been embellished with carved images. The temple has three free-standing large images of Jain tirthankaras deified in the garbha griha or sanctum sanctorum. These are carved ornately in black stone and highly polished. The three Tirthankaras are Ajitanatha, Neminath and Shreyanasanatha. The central figure is adorned with the symbol of a wheel holding two deers in the left hand, and a globe on the right hand. The base of this image has a \\"winged figure\\" carving. Carved images also embellish the exterior faces of the temple. Bagh Deval temple Bagh Deval temple, which was inferred initially as a Jain temple, is dated to the 11th century.

She was engaged in charitable and public enterprises. She was a member of the Texas board of lady managers of the World's Fair Exhibit Association, and the vice-president of the Woman's Humane Association of Fort Worth. Due to her efforts, the city installed a number of drinking fountains for people and for animals. Early life Wilhelmina (nickname, \\"Willie\\") Franklin was born in Tennessee, on January 11, 1865. She belonged to one of the oldest and most aristocratic families of Tennessee, her family being closely identified with the social and political aristocracy of that State before the Civil War. At its close, while she was an infant, they moved to Texas, and settled in Washington County, Texas. There, at the Baylor University, Pruitt's school education began. It was continued and finished at the Waco Female College, and in her native State. Her education was thorough and liberal, and while in school, she displayed unusual intellectual talents. She began to write verses when she was a child, and at the age of thirteen years she contributed to the local press. Career At Waco, May 1, 1887, she married Drew Pruitt (1860-1937), a lawyer, of Fort Worth, in which city she moved. Their son, Drew, Jr., was born at Fort Worth in April, 1888. Her work focused on matters of municipal reform, being an active participant in measures for the moral and physical comfort of the masses. One of the social schemes, born of modern philanthropy, with which she was closely identified was set forth in the declared purposes of a society named \\"The Woman's Humane Association,\\" of which she was the president. Its object was to provide needed benefits, both for individuals and for the community at large; in work of the latter class, its most conspicuous achievement was the free distribution of pure drinking water throughout the city for people and animals. In carrying out the design, several stone fountains were erected, which, apart from their usefulness, were attractive features in the city. Her reputation as a writer extended throughout the South. Pruitt's literary work indicated a versatile and cultured writer, and met with ready acceptance from papers and periodicals noted for their critical requirements. Her contributions, both prose and verse, usually appeared over the pseudonym of Aylmer Ney. She was a member of the Press Women of Texas. In 1906, they removed to Los Angeles. Here, her husband was appointed judge, and made a specialty of corporation and probate law. She died on February 22, 1947, in San Antonio, Texas and is buried in the city's Mission Burial Park South.

Early life and education  Hunt grew up in Anchorage, Alaska. She studied anthropology and classical studies at the Pacific Lutheran University (PLU), graduating in 2011. She then obtained a Master's of Science in paleopathology from Durham University. Hunt's fascination with archaeology dates back to her childhood in Alaska, where she never missed an episode of National Geographic. Kathryn studied archaeology during her time at PLU. Here, she became interested in Egyptology, which inspired her to sign up on a whim for a dig in Egypt along the Nile Delta. While participating in this dig, she was able to excavate remains of Egyptian royalty from areas surrounding the Valley of the Kings. In 2009, aged 22, Hunt was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of ovarian cancer. This occurred during her junior year at PLU. Around the same time as her diagnosis, Hunt's aunt passed away from ovarian cancer. Before she passed away, Kathryn's aunt reminded her \\"my cancer is not your cancer\\", inspiring her to continue to fight her own battle with her cancer, although her aunt had lost hers. She later entered remission after over 2 months of chemotherapy and surgery to remove more than 20 benign tumors from her abdomen. Just 2 months after this, Hunt returned to classes, even embarking on a trip to return to the Valley of the Kings shortly after. This experience moved Hunt towards researching the global history of cancer.  Academic career  Since beginning her studies, Hunt and colleagues have documented 272 cases of ancient cancer in the Cancer Research in Ancient Bodies (CRAB) Database. Previously, researchers had suggested that cancer was a modern day illness that did not affect people in historical times. However, through the field of paleo-oncology, research has shown that the first case of cancer documented in humans occurred 1.5 million years ago. By researching ancient texts, Hunt has found sources referencing to cancer as an illness by ancient Egyptians. She has even found records of ancient cancer treatments such as pharmacopoeia, surgery, cauterization, and fasting. These texts also listed many different plants used as a remedy to cancer, including spurge, which is similar to a castor bean, and Ecballium elaterium,also known as the squirting cucumber. Finding textual evidence of cancer inspired Hunt to pursue physical evidence of cancer. She began studying bones as the primary method for identifying cancer. Often, there are lesions present on the bones from the cancer metastasizing from other regions of the body. After abnormalities in the bone are recognized by researchers, further analysis can be done to understand more about the lesions. This can be done with microscopic analysis or through radiographs. Aside from her achievements within the field, Hunt has been a vocal advocate for the expansion of the field itself, generating both awareness and interest for the fairly new subject of paleo-oncology. Many scientists in the field of bio-archaeology tend to focus research on things such as infectious diseases and other frequent public health indicators. Paleo-Oncology is a very diverse field, requiring help from scientists of all specialties, including evolutionary biologists, archaeologists, geneticists, oncologists, and many more. Part of Hunt's purpose for studying ancient cancer is to help the scientific community to better understand the history of various forms of the disease, including potentially unknown causes and treatments. Hunt has conducted studies all around the world, including the time she spent conducting archaeological excavation and research in Egypt's Valley of Kings, Israel's Jezreel Valley, and with Transylvania Bioarchaeology. Hunt's ultimate goal is to establish a standard methodology for diagnosis of cancer in bones. In order to do this, Hunt along with help from Jennifer Willoughby, Casey Kirkpatrick, and Roselyn Campbell, launched an organization called the Ancient Cancer Foundation (ACF). One of Hunt's ultimate goals is to help build a foundation for which paleo-oncological research can progress—based in methodological discussion, multidisciplinary collaboration, and open access to information. Hunt co-founded the Paleo- Oncology Research Organization (PRO) in 2012 with colleagues Casey Kirkpatrick (Western Ontario University), Roselyn Campbell (University of California Los Angeles), and Jennifer Willoughby (Western Ontario University), which later becoming a subsidiary of the Ancient Cancer Foundation (ACF). The organization is a multidisciplinary institution that facilitates research into the global history of cancer (paleo-oncology) and open circulation of that information to the researchers as well as the public. Paleo-oncological research has been consistently growing and requires the contributions of historians, linguists, and scientists alike to further the world's understanding of cancer's historical development. The Paleo-Oncology Research Organization is working to list evidence of cancer in an online database to aid future paleo-oncologists in diagnosis of cancer in bones. It is also the hope of Hunt and her fellow researchers that this database will aid present and future scientists in their studies on how cancer has changed and evolved through time. This research will likely be aided by developments and advances in DNA analysis.  Professional career  Kathryn Hunt currently holds the position of human osteologist on the Jezreel Valley Research Project. She is also an assistant director of the Jucu de Sus Necropolis excavation and field school which she works with alongside Transylvania Bioarchaeology. Hunt is also a co-founder and creative director of the Paleo-Oncology Research Organization (PRO). Excavations that Hunt has participated in during her career include an archaeological excavation for Penn State's Mendes Expedition and an excavation for PLU Valley of the Kings Expedition in Egypt.  Honors and Awards  After forming PRO, Hunt was awarded a TED fellowship,https://ideas.ted.com/why-im-searching-for- cancer-in-ancient-human-bones/ \\"Searching for the history of cancer in ancient human bones\\" TED Ideas and was named one of Fast Company's Most Creative People of 2014, one of OZY's Rising Stars, and one of Foreign Policy's Leading Global Thinkers.

Some victims were transferred to Santa Casa de Montes Claros, about 130 km from Janaúba. The most severely burned victims were transferred using aircraft to the João XXIII hospital in Belo Horizonte, about 550 km away, which has specialized burn care. The case moved the country and had international repercussions. Perpetrator The night watchman, Damião Soares dos Santos (May 21, 1967, Porteirinha, in the northern region of Minas Gerais – October 5, 2017), resided in Janaúba, in same name of Brazilian state where his family lived. He chose his father's three-year death anniversary for the daycare fire. Police found gas in his home and two days before the fire, he told his family that he was going to die and that that would be his \\"gift\\" to them. He was the youngest sibling out of eleven. According to neighbours, he was a discreet individual who sold home-made popsicles to children.  Aftermath  The mayor of Janaúba, Carlos Isaildon Mendes, described the tragedy as \\"catastrophic.\\" He asked for help from the state government, which provided helicopters and hospitals, and neighboring municipalities, which provided ambulances and medicine for burn victims. Governor Fernando Pimentel decreed official mourning for three days and determined that all state security and health forces work in the care of victims and in the investigation, as well as the creation of an emergency command post in the city. On a Twitter post, President Michel Temer said: \\"I, as a father, imagine that this must be a very painful loss, I hope that these things will not happen again in Brazil. I express my solidarity with families.\\" On October 8, Temer granted teacher Helley de Abreu Silva Batista, who died in the fire, the National Order of Merit. In a statement, the Special Secretariat for Social Communication of the Presidency of the Republic said that the title is awarded to \\"those who have given examples of dedication and service to the country and Brazilian society, [such as] teacher Heley Batista, who sacrified her own life to save the lives of her students, showing courage and heroism that have touched us all.\\" The teacher was known to have managed to save a few of the children and also for having fought against the perpetrator. The federal government also released 8.7 million reais for the reconstruction of the burned-out daycare center and for the construction of two other educational institutions, one of which will be named after Professor Heley Batista. A memorial will also be built in honor of the victims.

The season is produced by Fremulon, 3 Arts Entertainment, and Universal Television. The season concluded on February 1, 2018, and consisted of 13 episodes. The series focuses on Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell), a deceased young woman who wakes up in the afterlife and is sent by Michael (Ted Danson) to \\"the Good Place\\", a heaven-like utopia he designed, in reward for her righteous life. However, she quickly realizes that she was sent there by mistake, and must hide her morally imperfect behavior (past and present). William Jackson Harper, Jameela Jamil, and Manny Jacinto co-star as other residents of the Good Place, together with D'Arcy Carden as an artificial being helping the inhabitants. Each of the episodes are listed as \\"Chapter (xx)\\" following the opening title card. Cast Main Kristen Bell portrays series protagonist Eleanor Shellstrop. * Kristen Bell as Eleanor Shellstrop, a deceased, selfish saleswoman from Phoenix, Arizona who winds up in the Good Place by mistake. In order to earn her spot, she recruits Chidi to teach her the fundamentals of becoming a better person. * William Jackson Harper as Chidi Anagonye, a deceased professor of ethics and moral philosophy from Senegal. Assigned as Eleanor's soulmate in Michael's first Good Place experiment, he gives her ethics lessons in an attempt to make her a better person. * Jameela Jamil as Tahani Al-Jamil, a deceased, wealthy English philanthropist who believes she belongs in the Good Place. She forms an unlikely friendship with Eleanor, who initially dislikes her positive attitude, condescending way of speaking, and tendency to name drop. * D'Arcy Carden as Janet, a programmed guide and knowledge bank who acts as the Good Place's main source of information and can provide its residents with whatever they desire. Later, Janet gains a more humanlike disposition, and begins to act differently than the way she was designed. ** Carden also plays Bad Janet, a disrespectful version of Janet designed not to respond to residents properly. * Manny Jacinto as Jason Mendoza, a deceased amateur DJ and drug dealer from Jacksonville, Florida who winds up in the Good Place by mistake.

Later, Jason proves to be an immature and unintelligent, but kindhearted Jacksonville Jaguars and Blake Bortles fan. * Ted Danson as Michael, a Bad Place architect who runs the Good Place neighborhood in which Eleanor, Chidi, Tahani, and Jason reside. Michael has a deep affinity for the mundane aspects of human life, like playing with paper clips or searching for one's car keys.

Zagone is an independent filmmaker and television director who is best known for his independent feature films Read You Like a Book (starring Karen Black, Tony Amendola and Danny Glover) and The Stand-In (starring Danny Glover). He is also well known for the iconic guerilla-style documentary Drugs in the Tenderloin, as well as his many forays into the musical culture of San Francisco, including Go Ride the Music, featuring Jefferson Airplane and Quicksilver Messenger Service; A Night at the Family Dog, featuring the Grateful Dead, Santana, and Jefferson Airplane; Big Brother and the Holding Company with Janis Joplin; and the infamous Bob Dylan Press Conference. Zagone was one of the first filmmakers to cover the cultural explosion of the 1960s in the San Francisco Bay Area, as well as one of the first directors to make music videos. In addition, he was one of the first directors to implement an open policy of diversity for all of his film projects, for both cast and crew. Zagone has been a guest lecturer at the California College of the Arts (where one of his students was Wayne Wang), and has been asked to speak at classes at DeAnza College, San Francisco Art Institute, and San Francisco State. He has also conducted workshops at Video Expo, Film Arts Foundation, and The Bay Area Video Coalition. He is the recipient of three Emmys from the San Francisco chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, and is a member of the Directors Guild of America. Many of the films and programs Zagone directed have been uploaded to YouTube, including the Bob Dylan Press Conference, Credence Clearwater Revival's music video for \\"Sweet Hitchhiker,\\" and The Human Be-In. Selected Film and Television Work 1963–1970 A year after beginning his volunteer status at KQED, Zagone was promoted to producer and director in the Programming Department. Some of the initial live TV shows that Zagone directed were The Jim Kerr Show (gardening), The Ed Radenzel Show (news) Laura Webber (folk guitar), World Press (news), the first local TV presentation of the California Tennis Championship, and the first international soccer match televised in the United States (Glasgow Celtics vs. Munich Bayern). It was during this time that he directed and produced many innovative television programs, not only for local Bay Area programming, but also for the National Educational Television network (which eventually transcended to PBS). A partial list of Zagone's early directing and producing work from 1963 to 1971: Five programs from Ralph J. Gleason's NET Jazz Casual series: –B.B. King's first national television appearance –The Charles Lloyd Quartet with the celebrated pianist Keith Jarrett –Count Basie Reminisces with Freddie Green on guitar, Sonny Payne on drums, and Norman Green on bass –The Woody Herman Band –The Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Orchestra Young Zagone with a Bolex Camera Youth in the Tenderloin (1964) Producer/director Youth in the Tenderloin was a studio program that featured participants discussing the burgeoning overflow of disenfranchised young people living in the Tenderloin District of San Francisco. The participants of the program were knowledgeable experts about the Tenderloin community and its issues, and included Rev. Ed Hansen of the Glide Foundation; Mark Forrester, a Central City Poverty community organizer; and Dr. William Kiely from St. Mary's Hospital. The San Francisco Chronicle said of the film, \\"it was one of those rare exceptions – a combination of good reporting, discussion by experts, and a forthright suggestion at the close. It pulled no punches and it made a meaningful statement.\\" Drugs in the Tenderloin (1967) Producer/Director Zagone was given a Reader's Digest Foundation Award to support a follow-up to Youth in the Tenderloin. The result was Drugs in the Tenderloin, which went on to win a prestigious NET award for Excellence. Dormant for over 50 years, the film was recently rediscovered and played multiple sold-out shows at the Tenderloin Museum and the Mission District's famous Roxie Theater. It also was screened for two nights as part of the Another Hole in the Head film festival. It is set to play at the San Francisco Urban Film Festival in November 2017. In his review of the festival for Beyond Chron, Peter Wong wrote, \\"Rather than being a vice tourist, Zagone's camera becomes a witness for the people who live with the Tenderloin's realities 24/7. This approach yields several revelatory interviews…. Despite some sound problems resulting from period technology, this rarely screened film is a cinematic time capsule worth viewing.\\" Bob Dylan Press Conference (1965) Producer (With Ralph J. Gleason)/Director Dylan's infamous press conference held in the KQED studios was also attended by Bill Graham, poet Michael McClure, and Allen Ginsberg. Footage from the press conference was used in the Martin Scorsese documentary, No Direction Home : Bob Dylan (2005) for the American Masters series on PBS. The conference was also reproduced and dramatized in the Todd Haynes movie I'm Not There (2007) with Cate Blanchett as Bob Dylan. The infamous 1965 Bob Dylan Press Conference, produced (with Ralph J. Gleason) and directed by Zagone The Newcomers (1965) The San Francisco version of a New York public television program called The Comers, The Newcomers was a studio talk show series hosted by Buzz Anderson that featured some of the brightest and most talented high school students in the Bay Area. The students talked frankly about subject matter that affected their lives, including sex, race, and school issues. One of the featured students was Ted Lange, who went on to have a successful television acting career. Music in Golden Gate Park (1966) Producer/Director This program was the very first television program that used studio video cameras to shoot on location. The program featured The Steve Miller Band playing in the Children's Playground; Mimi Farina singing in a Golden Gate Park meadow; Margaret Fabrizio playing harpsichord at the Portals of the Past (directed by Joyce Campbell), and Ashish Khan, son of the famed Sitar player Ali Akbar Khan, playing sitar at the edge of Golden Gate Park.

In this presser, Mr. Sahl discusses his involvement with Jim Garrison, the Texas Attorney General, and the Kennedy Assassination conspiracy theories. Portions of this press conference were featured in the 2006 PBS American Master's series Mort Sahl: Shaping Laughter. Steve Miller Band Music Videos Directed by Zagone and Ben Van Meter These two videos were the first music videos of the Steve Miller Band and one went on to win Best Experimental Film at the San Francisco Film Festival and the Bellevue Film Festival. Clips of these videos were used in the production honoring Steve Miller when he was indoctrinated into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. National Center for Experiments in Television The Rockefeller Foundation funded a consortium of artists to meet daily to discuss the state of television, then collectively or in tandem with others create visionary segments utilizing the studios and equipment of KQED. Zagone augmented the works with the NABET engineering crew at KQED. Participants were poet Joanne Kyger, composer Richard Felciano, author Bill Brown, and filmmakers Loren Sears and Robert Nelson. Videos that were created for these experiments were later viewed at the U.C. Museum in Berkeley and at the Whitney Museum in New York. Youth Drug Ward (1968) Producer/Director This documentary was filmed at the Langley Porter Neuropsychiatric Institute in San Francisco at the University of California Medical Center. The film was a study of the program put forth by Dr. Harry Wilmer, an innovator in the field of social psychiatry and treatment for drug addiction.

The program featured The Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, and Santana, plus a jam featuring members of all these bands with the addition of the Steve Miller Band and Quicksilver Messenger Service. The program was augmented by some of San Francisco's most prestigious light show artists. San Francisco Mix (1970) Executive Producer/Director This experimental \\"magazine-style\\" show preceded the Evening Magazine show, setting the foundation for the successful format of the Evening Magazine. One of the San Francisco Mix dramatic narrative programs featured Victor Wong, at the time a journalist on the prestigious Newsroom program at KQED. Zagone liked the way Victor looked on camera and cast him in the lead role in the program, entitled Searching. Victor would later move on to become a beloved character actor in Hollywood films, featured in Bertolucci's The Last Emperor, John Carpenter's Big Trouble in Little China, and Wayne Wang's Dim Sum, among others. In one comedic scene in Searching, Victor interacts with a group of improv actors in a theatre setting. One of the characters was the then-unknown comedic actor Robin Williams. This appearance would prove to be Mr. Williams's very first national television appearance. It was only years later, after Williams became famous, that Zagone scrutinized the Searching program and recognized the young actor. Selected Film and Television Work 1970–2000 Fantasy Films (1971–1973) Zagone and filmmaker Irving Saraf set up the film division at Fantasy Records in Berkeley under the aegis of Ralph J. Gleason. Musical \\"promo films\\" (aka music videos) were among the first output of the newly formed department.

It is not to be missed.\\" Evening Magazine (1975) Producer The prototype for this show, prior to Zagone's involvement, was a studio program with guests discussing how-tos and tips. When Zagone became producer, he suggested to the executive producer Bill Hillier that the program should be shot on location, utilizing the new hand-held ENG cameras. Zagone also instilled the program with three hosts. Each program featured a serious journalistic segment, an entertainment segment, and a \\"how-to\\" segment. The style and concept was soon adopted by most of the television industry, including 20/20 at ABC. Zagone helmed this show for 6 months before returning to his freelance work.

Widely known by her pen-name, \\"Belle Bremer\\", her vision was greatly impaired, so much so that much of the time she was unable to read or write. Swafford was a native of Indiana, and by education, environment, and primary attachments, she was an Indiana poet. Yet she called herself semi- Southern, because of her Virginian parentage and her own yearly temporary home in the South. She spent her winters at Huntsville, Alabama, a noted health resort of the time, where much of her poetical work was done. It was said that the cheerful, hopeful tone of these poems, made more effective by an underlying pathos, was a pleasing contrast to the melancholy which marred the work of so many versemakers of the time. Early years Marthena Funkhouser (nickname, \\"Aunt Mat\\") was born near Terre Haute, Indiana, in July 26, 1845. Her parents, John G. Funkhouser and Mary E \\"Polly\\" Martin, were Virginians. Her father, of German ancestry, was a large farmer of Vigo County, Indiana. Her mother was of English descent. Each year she spent part of her time in the South, generally passing the winters in Huntsville. She was reared in Terre Haute, and received a liberal education, which she supplemented by extensive reading and study. Swafford was troubled by an optical weakness, which at times made her unable to read or write, and her health was delicate. She was a precocious child and at an early age showed by her poetical productions which ranked her with the foremost of the rising authors of the Wabash Valley. Career Her first literary work was stories for the Philadelphia \\"Saturday Evening Post.\\" She became a contributor to \\"Peterson's Magazine\\" and other periodicals, and her poems were extensively read and copied. The Atlanta \\"Constitution\\" introduced her to its extended southern constituency, and some of her best work appeared in that journal. Much of her work was done during her winter residence in Huntsville. In poetry, she belongs to the romantic rather than to the aesthetic school, though her verse was characterized by melody and a noticeable artistic treatment. Her muse was preëminently heroic and ideal, as her subjects generally indicated. She wrote of \\"The Norse King,\\" \\"The Haunted Battlefield,\\" \\"The Hesperides,\\" \\"When My Ship Comes In,\\" and other like matters, which appealed to the imagination of the reader. Among her most warmly-esteemed Southern literary friends was Henry W. Grady. She published one volume of poems, entitled Wych Elm (Buffalo, 1891). Swafford was a charter member of the Western Association of Writers. Personal life On May 8, 1862, she married Dr. Benjamin Franklin Swafford (died 1900), a prominent physician in Terre Haute. Her home was a social and literary center, and her time was devoted to good works and literature. She died June 29, 1913, in Indianapolis, and she was buried at Highland Lawn Cemetery in Terre Haute.

Early life Grant was born in Lossiemouth, a town in Moray, Scotland. Her parents were Jane and William Dean. She had 3 siblings. Her 3 of her maternal uncles were captains of schooners, while her father was not. He instilled a love of education into Grant during her childhood. Grant attended public school in her hometown and Elgin Academy. In 1917, she earned a master's degree from University of Aberdeen in English and French. She taught in England and Scotland for 5 years after the completion of her degree. Additionally, she studied at Sorbonne in Paris and the }University of Madrid, where she became fluent in Spanish. She moved to the United States in 1924 with her husband aboard the SS Californian. They settled in Los Angeles. Grant earned her PhD in comparative literature from the University of Southern California in 1940. Career Grant was the first blind person to teach in the California Public School system. She began as a teacher in the Los Angeles, California public school system in 1927. She was an advocate for Mexican American students and often went with them to court if they got into trouble. Due to her vision loss in the 1940s, she was forced from her position as Vice Principal at Belvedere Junior High School into early retirement by the Board of Education. The National Federation of the Blind and the Belvedere Junior High School Faculty Club fought the Board of Education to keep her out of forced disability retirement. They retained her, and she ended up working for thirteen years as a teacher for blind students. In February 1949, Grant was removed from her teaching position at Belvedere and placed at Polytechnic High School. Due to misconceptions of blindness, Grant was moved forced from school to school. She was required to have a sighted adult in the classroom at all times as a safety precaution. She was a skilled teacher. Once students showed improvement, they were removed from her classroom. She retired from teaching in June 1962. Her teaching career spanned thirty-two years. During her retirement celebration, her colleagues gave her a book filled with letters of appreciation. In August 1962, she received a Fulbright-Hays Fellowship to educate teachers in Pakistan about teaching blind children. In 1964, she received another Fulbright Fellowship to continue her work in Pakistan. Activism Due to her experiences as a teacher who was blind, Grant worked on legislative and organizational efforts so that blind teachers would not have to experience such discrimination in the workplace. In conjunction with the California Council of the Blind, Grant fought to get the California legislature to eliminate discriminatory practices for teachers who are blind. The California legislature passed legislation to remove the requirement that teachers be keenly sighted in order to be certified as teachers and banned discrimination for teachers in the university application process, their education, and their job search process. Grant felt blind students should be educated alongside their sighted peers. She believed this helps to prepare the children who are blind to live in a sighted world. This was most positively received in developing countries where they lacked funding to build separate schools for blind students. Before she retired from teaching, Grant took a sabbatical from teaching in 1959 to travel around the world with her white cane she lovingly named Oscar. She was in Pakistan from September 1959 to February 1960 organizing the Pakistan Association of the Blind. The aim of her trip was to learn as much as she could about education in the countries she visited. Her particular interest was in the education of children who are blind. At the time of her trip, she had been completely blind for twelve years, and society considered women and people who were blind too helpless to travel alone. During one of her yearlong trips, she visited twenty-three countries, including Great Britain, Fiji, India, Myanmar, and Pakistan. In 1967, Jacobus tenBroek, who was president of the National Federation of the Blind and the International Federation of the Blind, asked Grant to travel to Africa to report on education of blind children in Africa and the overall acceptance of blind people in society, as well as their options for independence. For this trip, The American Action Fund for Blind Children provided Grant with a $2,000 stipend for her travel and expenses. After her trip ended, she continued her humanitarian efforts from California. She would collect Braille books, typewriters, music, paper, watches, and folding canes. Some of these items she would send to people who needed them in the United States. Other items she sent to other countries. Due to these efforts, Grant helped to establish Braille libraries in 65 countries. In 1964, Grant became the first woman to receive the Newell Perry award from the National Federation of the Blind. She was named International Teacher of 1967. She was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1972. Due to her humanitarian efforts, she was known to correspond with about 800 people in seven different languages. On her travels, she spoke about the \\"White Cane Law\\" and the National Federation of the Blind in order to spread the awareness of rights for blind people. Grant wrote a book about her world travel with only her white cane accompanying her. There were challenges to writing her book, from Braille notes being flattened from the humidity in the tropical climate where she traveled to difficulty finding a publisher. Her book was not published until 2016, nearly forty years after her death. Awards Newel Perry award, National Federation of the Blind, 1964 International Teacher of 1967 Nominated for the Nobel Peach Prize in 1972 Personal life Grant was married to a physician, Alexander Grant. Together they had one daughter, Jane Susannah \\"Hermione\\" Grant, born in 1930. Her husband died in 1946. Grant lost her vision in 1948 due to Glaucoma.

After competing nursing training and working as a psychiatric nurse, she returned to school to earn a bachelor's, master's and PhD degree. Developing ideas about the philosophy involved in taking care of other people, she moved away from practicing nursing and turned toward academia. She taught at various universities in Norway and Denmark and was recognized as a Knight 1st Class of the Order of St. Olav for nursing by the Norwegian crown in 2011. Early life Kari Marie Martinsen was born in Oslo, Norway in 1943. The older of two sisters, she grew up in a home composed of her parents, who were both economists and had formerly been part of the Norwegian resistance movement during World War II, her sister and her grandmother. After completion of her high schooling, Martinsen enrolled in Ullevål College of Nursing and graduated in 1964. Career Upon her graduation, Martinsen completed a clinical practice at Ullevål University Hospital through 1965 and then worked as a psychiatric nurse at Dikemark Psychiatric Hospital for two years. During her work, she began to question the policy of objectifying patients by focusing on the technology of care and disease, rather than the patient. The idea led her to further her education, enrolling in psychology at the University of Oslo, from where she obtained a bachelor's degree in 1968. Going on to further her education, Martinsen enrolled at the University of Bergen (UB) to study philosophy and phenomenology. She completed her Master of Arts degree in 1974 with her thesis, Philosophy and Nursing: A Marxist and Phenomenological Contribution (1975), which was the first critical analysis in Norway evaluating the profession from a philosophical and social perspective. From 1976 to 1977, Martinsen served as dean of the Nursing Teacher’s Training faculty, which had been established as a joint venture by county authorities, three nursing colleges and the University of Bergen. At the time in Norway, debate was on- going over the educational requirements for nurses. Martinsen favored a four- year program, attained through a 2-year care assistant certification, followed by another two years of study to attain a nursing degree. Her stance that the social aspects of care were equal to the technical aspects, were viewed as provocative and she was asked to withdraw from the Norwegian Nursing Association (NSF). In 1978, Martinsen took a position at the University of Oslo in the history department as a lecturer on socio-political history and worked to develop the social history of nursing in Norway under a grant she had received from the General Science Research Council. Martinsen returned to the University of Bergen in 1981 as a scientific assistant in the history department, lecturing on feminist history. Her research focus from 1976 to 1986 evaluated the social history of women and caring, evaluating when the shift from care of the sick shifted from \\"women's work\\" and charitable activities to professionally trained nurses. She completed her PhD in philosophy from UB in 1984 with her work History of Nursing: Frank and Engaged Deaconesses: A Caring Profession Emerges 1860–1905. Promoted to associate professor in 1986, Martinson lectured in the Department of Health and Social Medicine at UB. Caring Nursing and Medicine: Historical-Philosophical Essays (1989) marked a turn in her research to a philosophical phase and evaluated the impact of Martin Heidegger's theories on the development of a concept of caring. In her philosophical studies, Martinsen makes a distinction between the activities of observing and classifying and perception, or the way one emotionally reacts to the patient. The following year, Martinsen moved to Denmark to develop master's degree and PhD programs in nursing at Aarhus University. Soon after she arrived, Heidegger's ties to Nazism became public knowledge and Martinsen reevaluated her previous work based on his philosophy. In From Marx to Løgstrup: On Morality, Social Criticism and Sensuousness in Nursing (1993), she confronted the issues with Heidegger and introduced the philosophy of Knud Ejler Løgstrup, as it related to a discussion of care. While in Aarhus, she simultaneously worked as an adjunct professor at the University of Tromsø (UT) from 1994 to 1997. She moved to Tromsø in 1997 when she was offered a full professorship at UT, but remained only one year. Between 1998 and 2002, Martinsen worked as a free-lance researcher and lecturer before returning to the University of Bergen as a full professor of nursing science. In 2007, she accepted a full professorship at Harstad University College in Troms County northern Norway. Martinsen's work has been influential in developing a concept of care in nursing in Nordic countries and has been used as a comparison point for nursing ethics in Anglo-American thought and practice. In 2011, Martinsen was recognized as a Knight 1st Class of the Order of St. Olav for nursing by the Norwegian crown.

The gun was manufactured in 1882, but nothing is known of its abandonment. The bottom of its stock was buried in 4-5 inches of accumulated soil and vegetation, and a round of ammunition stored in its buttstock dated between 1887 and 1911, indicating that it had been resting there for many years. A post about the weathered gun on the park's Facebook page captured the public's imagination and went viral because of the mystery of who left the gun propped against the tree and why they never returned for it.  Discovery  Prior to the rifle's discovery, the National Park Service had started a $280,000 fuels reduction project around Strawberry Creek Campground to prevent campfires from sparking wildfires in the surrounding forest. As part of the project, the Park Service sent staff from their cultural resources office to search the project area for artifacts, which is when archaeologist Eva Jensen found the rifle leaning against a tree above the campground. The discovery was fortunate because less than two years later the Strawberry Fire swept through the area and consumed the juniper tree the rifle had been leaning against.  Conservation and description  The rifle is a Winchester Repeating Arms Company Model 1873, the same type featured in the 1950 film Winchester '73. The rifle's serial number indicates that it was manufactured in 1882. Winchester mass-produced this model of .44-40 caliber rifle that became known as the \\"Gun that Won the West,\\" making 25,000 of them in 1882 alone. The park service sent the gun to the Firearms Museum at the Buffalo Bill Center of the West in Cody, Wyoming for analysis and conservation. A team of researchers took the firearm to a local hospital to be X-rayed under the patient name \\"Rifle\\". While the chamber and ammunition tube were not loaded, the X-rays revealed a live .44-Winchester centerfire caliber cartridge in a compartment inside the buttstock. This cartridge was manufactured by the Union Metallic Cartridge Company sometime between 1887 and 1911. The X-ray also showed that a crack in the stock had been repaired with metal pins. The conservators used hydroxypropyl cellulose to preserve the wooden gunstock and prevent it from further deterioration.

Literally, the word Zhongjunjiang means \\"General of central army\\". The post originally was named \\"Situ\\" (司徒). Zhongjunjiang was also known as \\"Jiangjun\\" (將軍), \\"Dazheng\\" (大政, 太政, 大正) and \\"Yuanshuai\\" (元帥). Since Zhao Dun's term as Zhongjunjiang, the post's jurisdiction was widened and its holder automatically obtains the regency of Jin. Historical evidence also indicate that Zhongjunjiang had the legislative power. In 633 BCE, Duke Wen of Jin held a military parade in Beilu and announced his plan of military reform. The duke thereby established the central army in addition to the upper army and the lower army of Jin. Xi Hu was the first Zhongjunjiang appointed by the duke of Jin. To hold the post of Zhongjunjiang, one has to be in the rank of Qing (卿). In Jin's history, six powerful vassal states of Jin and their leader held this post in turn. The six clans were known as the Liuqing of Jin (六卿). Namely, the six clans were: Han, Zhao, Wei, Zhi, Zhonghang, and Fan. Luan and Xi clan were two clans which also possessed the status of qing but became extinct due to political struggles in Jin's court. The dictatorial power of Zhongjunjiang led to the constant conflicts between the six vassal states of Jin. Approaching the end of its existence, Jin was troubled by the civil wars waged by its own retainers against each other. The last Zhongjunjiang before the partition of Jin was Xun Yao. According to Chunqiu Dashibiao (春秋大事表) by Qing dynasty historian Gu Donggao, Zhongjunjiang is etymologically the origin of the Chinese words 將軍 and 元帥. The two alternative names of Zhongjunjiang later influenced the naming system of a certain country's military, especially China, Japan, Korea and Vietnam. The word 將軍 (Jiāngjūn, Shōgun, Changgun, Tướng quân, \\"General\\") derived from Zhongjunjiang. Another alternative name 元帥 (Yuánshuài, Gensui, Wansu, Nguyên soái) is used in the four countries as a translation and equivalent of the English word \\"Marshal\\".

He was familiaris of Nicholas Garai, Palatine of Hungary. Initially known as Anthony of Somkerék (), he was the founder of the distinguished Erdélyi de Somkerék noble family. Family Anthony was born in the early 1370s into the Somkeréki family, which had landholdings and estates in Transylvania. The kinship originated from the gens (clan) Becsegergely, thus his distant relatives were the Bethlen and Apafi families, future royal houses of the Principality of Transylvania. His earliest known ancestor is comes Ant in the late 12th century.Engel: Genealógia (Genus Becsegergely, 4. Erdélyi (somkeréki) branch) Anthony was one of the three children of Nicholas Somkeréki (fl. 1360–92), a member of the Nemegye branch of the kindred, and Elizabeth Méhesi. Anthony's siblings were John (fl. 1391–1410), whose two sons died without male descendants, and Catherine (fl. 1408–10), who married vice-voivode Peter Sztrigyi. When Anthony resided abroad for years to service his king, or held positions outside the region of Transylvania, he was considered as a foreigner and as a result he was called Erdélyi (\\"from Transylvania\\"), as referring to his place of origin. After his death, it became surname of the family. His first wife was Margaret Antimus, a daughter of vice-palatine John Antimus, who also served the Garai family. She was mentioned by a single charter dated around 1402 or 1403, and died before 1415. Their marriage produced three sons and two daughters. The eldest child Gelét (or Gregory) was referred to as a royal familiaris in 1430. John I did not survive childhood, while Nicholas I simultaneously functioned as vice-voivode and ispán of Torda County in 1448. The two daughters Barbara and Catherine married Stephen Tuzsoni (\\"the Bulgarian\\") and vice-voivode Nicholas Vízaknai, respectively. After Margaret's death, Anthony married his second spouse Clara from an unidentified family. She was mentioned by a papal document in 1415. They had two sons: Ladislaus I, who died in infancy, and Stephen I, probably the most illustrious member of the family. The 16th- century members of the Erdélyi family descended from Stephen's branch. Career Erdélyi is first mentioned by name in December 1391 during a land division agreement within the family. He appeared in a same context in the next year. It is possible that his father died in that year, becoming Anthony and his brother John Somkeréki as joint heads of the household in Somkerék (today Șintereag, Romania). He entered royal service by 1396, when participated in the Battle of Nicopolis. After the defeat, Erdélyi and other lords kept the ships ready, when Sigismund and his escort fled the battlefield and managed to escape with Venetian ships in the Danube. According to historian Elemér Mályusz, Erdélyi then already belonged to Nicholas Garai's accompaniment (considering that, Garai and his banderium was entrusted to secure Sigismund's withdrawal in the 1395 Wallachian campaign too). Erdélyi was made castellan of Knin Fortress by 1401 (when his lord Garai held the dignity of Ban of Croatia and his father-in-law John Antimus functioned as vice-ban). In that capacity, he successfully defended the castle against Hrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić, the partisan of claimant Ladislaus of Naples, who besieged Knin in that year. When Garai was appointed Palatine of Hungary, Erdélyi also left Croatia. For his courageous engagement in Knin, while Sigismund was imprisoned, Erdélyi was granted the villages of Harina, Bilak (Herina and Domnești in Romania, respectively) and the uninhabited Nécs in July 1402. In that year, he participated in Sigismund's military expedition to the Kingdom of Bohemia, when the king captured his brother Wenceslaus IV and ruled Bohemia for nineteen months. Erdélyi stayed in Bohemia until the next year, when Sigismund had to abadon his claim temporarily due to Ladislaus of Naples' invasion to Southern Hungary. Returning Hungary, Erdélyi was donated the confiscated lands, fields, meadows and mill of the disloyal John Kolman for his Bohemian military service in May 1403. He received huge land donations in June 1405: Gernyeszeg, Sáromberke, Sárpatak, Unoka and Körtekapu (today Gornești, Dumbrăvioara, Șapartoc, Onuca and Poarta, respectively) became properties of the Erdélyi family. His territorial seat was Sáromberke, which also granted the right to collect custom and to host market. Erdélyi was frequently mentioned as castellan of Somló between 1405 and 1411. He also acted as relator of Garai during a lawsuit in 1406. When his lord served as ispán of Sáros County from 1406 to 1409, Erdélyi functioned as one of the two vice-ispáns under him, alongside Demetrius Zsörki. Erdélyi was last mentioned in this capacity in August 1408, but it is plausible that he held the office until Garai's end of term in 1409. Alongside Stibor of Stiboricz, Voivode of Transylvania and other local nobles, Erdélyi participated in a provincial diet at Brassó (present-day Brașov, Romania) on 1 September 1412, where acted as an arbiter in the revision of previously issued privilege diplomas of the local Saxon district (\\"Terra Saxonum de Barasu\\"). As a member of the escort of Nicholas Garai, Erdélyi traveled to Germany and was present at the coronation of Sigismund as King of the Romans took place in Aachen on 8 November 1414. Traveling further to Italy, Erdélyi also took part in the initial phase of the Council of Constance at the turn of 1414 and 1415, and acted as majordomo of Garai's court. Returning Hungary, Erdélyi served as castellan of Buda and Rohonc (present-day Rechnitz in Austria) in 1416. Two documents issued in July 1423 refer to him as vice-palatine. Erdélyi died in 1429 or 1430; he last appears as living person in contemporary records in May 1429 and was first referred to as deceased in March 1430. Estates and privileges For his loyal service, he was granted the privilege of building a castle in one of his estates by Sigismund at the national diet of Tétény (today Budafok-Tétény) in August 1410. The monarch confirmed this permission in April 1415. This was implemented by his son Stephen decades later, who erected a castle near Gernyeszeg. In June 1412, King Sigismund also permitted to Erdélyi to hold a national fair twice a year and weekly fair on Mondays at Somkerék. Erdélyi also acquired this privilege regarding his estate at Sáromberke in March 1415. Two months later, a royal charter ordered payment of the customs there for the local Székely and Saxon communities. For his service in Germany, Erdélyi and his family were granted the right of jus gladii to all of his landholdings in November 1414. After his role in the Council of Constance, the royal chancellery also donated a coat-of-arms to the Erdélyi family in January 1415. A month later, Antipope John XXIII permitted Anthony Erdélyi and his wife, Clara to receive full forgiveness from all confessors on the territory of the Diocese of Transylvania. Erdélyi bought a portion of Szengyel (present-day Sânger, Romania) from local nobles in 1414. He also purchased the village of Záh in 1417, too. He bought the two-thirds portion of Denk in Hunyad County (today Dâncu Mare and Dâncu Mic in Romania) from his nephews, the sons of Peter Sztrigyi in 1421, who were willing to divest the estate because of their uncle's previous benefits. Erdélyi bought half of plow and fishpond at Faragó (today Fărăgău, Romania) from the widow of John Sámsondi in May 1427. Erdélyi acquired the half of the uninhabited waste Lőrinctelke in Torda County for 100 denari from John Kecseti in May 1428. Erdélyi exchanged his estates Méhes and Valka (present-day Miheșu de Câmpie and Văleni in Romania, respectively) for the village Rücs (present-day Râciu in Romania) with James Meggyesfalvi in April 1429. The cathedral chapter of Transylvania, as a place of authentication, registered Erdélyi as the new owner of Rücs in May 1429, his last mention as a living person. Since the 1400s, various lawsuits were launched against Erdélyi and his soldiers for their alleged involvements in unlawful acquisitions of neighboring lands, looting and domination. In one case, Erdélyi was charged with murder of a local nobleman Andrew Csatári, but he was acquitted. He also had several conflicts with Ladislaus II Szécsényi, the owner of Sárpatak (today Șapartoc, Romania) in Torda County. For instance, Szécsényi intended to build a mill at river Mureș (Maros), whose operation threatened Erdélyi's neighboring lands, Gernyeszeg and Sáromberke with flooding. Despite an official ban, the mill was built within short time, causing heavy damage to Erdélyi. Thereafter, Szécsényi was forced to demolish the mill. Regarding the verdicts of the lawsuits against him, Erdélyi's affiliation to the Garais and, thus, the royal court protected him from adverse judgments, according to historian Szidónia Weisz. Erdélyi, as a lesser nobleman, was much richer than most of his neighbors because of his influential relationships, thus he was able to lend large sums for pledged landholdings, further increasing his family's estates and wealth.

He gave the name \\"Côte d'Azur\\" (Azure Coast) to the French Riviera. Life Early years (1830–67) Stéphen François Emile Liégeard was born on 29 March 1830 in Dijon, Côte-d'Or. His parents were Jean Baptiste Liégeard (1800–87), Mayor of Dijon, and Catherine Emilie Vallow (). His family was extremely wealthy. He studied at the Lycée in Dijon, then attended the Dijon Faculty of Law. He published his first collection of poems and short theatrical plays, Memories of some summer evenings, when he was 22, and throughout his life published many other works that were well-received by the critics. He enrolled at the bar in Dijon in 1854. He was awarded a gold medal for his doctorate in law. In 1856 Liégeard entered the administration as a counselor to the prefecture of Drôme. He published a poem, The Golden Bees, in honor of the Empire and the Emperor in 1859. He was appointed sub-prefect of Briey, Moselle in 1859. On 17 December 1860 in Augny he married Jeanne Mathilde Labbé. Their daughter Jeanne M Adélaïde was born in 1861. Liégeard was appointed sub-prefect of Parthenay, Deux-Sèvres in 1861, then of Carpentras, Vaucluse in 1864. Deputy (1867–70) In 1867 Liégeard gave up his position as sub-prefect of Carpentras to run for election to the legislature. On 24 March 1867 he was elected deputy as official candidate for the second district of Moselle, replacing Charles de Wendel, who had resigned. He sat with the dynastic majority. He was reelected as the government candidate in the general elections of 24 May 1869. He signed the request for interpellation of the 116. He voted with the liberals. He was in favour of selection of mayors in municipal councils, in favour of ministerial responsibility, against hidden loans and in favour of lower railway tariffs. In July 1869 he voted for a subsidy of 100,000 francs to Gustave Lambert to undertake an expedition to the North Pole. Later years (1870–1925) The château of Brochon, represented in Stéphen Liégeard's writing paper. Liégeard returned to practice at the bar in Dijon when the legislation was dissolved on 4 September 1870 during the Franco-Prussian War. He joined the Dijon Academy and Clémence Isaure's Académie des Jeux Floraux. Liégeard had a property in Cannes where he spent his winters, and loved the beauty of what he called the \\"Côte-d'Azur\\" by analogy with his birthplace, the \\"Côte-d'Or\\". The name substituted the azure blue color of the Mediterranean for the gold of Côte-d'Or. His best known work, La Côte d'azur, was written at Brochon in 1887 and published in Paris in 1888. The Académie française awarded the book the prix Bordin. The name \\"Côte d'Azur\\" became a common alternative to the \\"French Riviera\\". Liégeard was ambitious to be admitted to the Académie française, but abandoned that hope after attempts in 1891, 1892 and 1902 all failed. His attempts to be elected to the Academy were rejected in favour of Pierre Loti, Edmond Rostand and Émile Zola. Stéphen Liégeard built the Château de Brochon in an estate near Brochon, Côte-d'Or that was partly acquired at the start of the 19th century by his grandfather, Étienne Liégeard. Étienne's son Jean-Baptiste completed the purchase in 1843, and Jean-Baptiste's son Stephen Liégeard bought the old castle that belonged to the estate from the family of the engineer Henry Darcy. Stéphen Liégeard had the château built as a monument to his wealth and good taste. Construction started in 1895 directed by the architects Louis Perreau and Leprince, a pupil of Eugène Viollet-le-Duc. The artists Xavier Schanosky, Achille Cesbron and Paul Gasq decorated the château. Stéphen Liégeard was councilor-general of Moselle, a knight of the Legion of Honour (12 August 1866) and a Knight of Saint-Grégoire. He died on 29 December 1925 in Cannes, Alpes-Maritimes. Gaston Liégeard, Stéphen's son, was a bachelor and died in 1953. His nephew refused to accept the château and it passed to the state, which decided to use it for a school. The Lycée Stéphen Liégeard was opened in 1962. Publications Plaque in Liégeard's honour in Dijon * Souvenirs de quelques soirées d'été, Dijon, Loireau-Feuchot, 1852, 32 p.

Life Simons was born at Tielt in 1538, to a farming couple, Etienne Simoens and Marie van Slambrouck.A. C. De Schrevel, \\"Simons, Pierre\\", Biographie Nationale de Belgique, vol. 22 (Brussels, 1920), 597-619. Orphaned young, Pierre was educated at the Bogard school in Bruges, where he showed such promise that the governors decided to send him to Leuven University for further studies. On 20 March 1559 he graduated from the Faculty of Arts as second of his year among 154 students, and received a scholarship to go on to a Theology degree, studying at Holy Spirit College. He graduated Bachelor of Theology in 1563, and was ordained priest on 18 September of the same year by Petrus Curtius, bishop of Bruges. In 1567 he graduated Licentiate in Theology, and the following year was appointed to a prebend in the chapter of Bruges Cathedral. At Holy Ghost College, Simons had been taught by Cornelis Jansenius, who as bishop of Ghent appointed him canon penitentiary in 1569, and archpriest in 1570. Simons worked in tandem with Clemens Crabbeels, archdeacon and diocesan official, who would later become bishop of 's-Hertogenbosch. In 1570 Simons accompanied Jansenius to the provincial synod in Mechelen, at the closing of which he delivered an oration on obedience to canon law. In 1571 he delivered the inaugural address to the diocesan synod of Ghent. As archpriest he visited Oudenaarde after it had been recovered from rebel forces and reported on the atrocities committed against the clergy in the town. His report was turned into verse by the soldier-poet Jacobus Yetzweirtius. Copies were published in 1841 in Recueil de Chroniques, Chartes et autres Documents concernant l'Histoire et les Antiquités de la Flandre, and in 1870, in volume 8 of Analectes pour servir à l'histoire ecclésiastique de Belgique. In 1576 he delivered the funeral oration for Jansenius. In 1577 the rebels took control of Ghent, and in September the following year Catholic worship was proscribed in the city. In October the city government banished Simons, who went into exile first in Douai and later in Kortrijk, where his friend Jan David was a parish priest. After David had joined the Jesuits in 1582, Simons took over his pastoral duties. In September 1584, a fortnight before Ghent returned to royal control, Pope Gregory XIII confirmed the nomination of Simons to the diocese of Ypres and of Crabbeels to 's-Hertogenbosch. The two were consecrated in Tournai on 13 January 1585. He was enthroned in his see on 27 January. Simons was diligent in visiting his war-torn diocese, reforming clerical and monastic discipline, and preaching frequently. He restored the cathedral, commissioning new choir stalls from Urbain Taillebert and a monumental crucifix from Orner van Ommen. He also had a new high altar and tabernacle installed. He provided refuges in Ypres for several religious communities from the Flemish countryside, until 1601 subject to raids by the Dutch garrison in Ostend, and in 1594 provided a new home for the Poor Clares of Middelburg. In his first year as bishop he revived the annual procession in early August commemorating the Siege of Ypres (1383), which had been suppressed in 1578, and instituted a new annual procession in April to commemorate the city's reconciliation. He was particularly concerned with education, encouraging the re-establishment of parish schools and Sunday schools, and in 1586 refounding the diocesan seminary established by his predecessor, Martin Rythovius. He provided the Jesuits with a house in Ypres in return for them providing two teachers to the seminary, and converted one of the prebends of his cathedral chapter into a position for a graduate in Theology who would teach Sacred Scripture. Simons died in Ypres on 5 October 1605. He was buried in his cathedral. He left bequests to the cathedral, to the Faculty of Theology in Leuven, to Groeninghe Abbey in Kortrijk, to the Bogard school in Bruges, and to his sister, with the diocesan seminary as residual legatee. After his death his writings and surviving sermons were edited for publication by his friend Jan David.

The essence of new hermeneutic emphasizes not only the existence of language but also the fact that language is eventualized in the history of individual life.(1999) Dictionary of Biblical Interpretation, R.N. Soulen, \\"Ernst Fuchs\\", by John Hayes, 422–423. This is called the event of language. Ernst Fuchs,Ernst Fuchs, Briefe an Gerhard Ebeling, in: Festschrift aaO 48. Gerhard Ebeling, and James M. Robinson are the scholars who represent the new hermeneutics. And it is said that language event (German: Sprachereignis, the word event) occurs continuously, not that the interpreter insists on the text, but the text continually asserts the interpreter. Fuchs' concern is not to ask for the meaning of the text, but to learn how to listen to unobtrusive language about human beings' existence according to the hermeneutical help given with the text itself. Fuchs' achievement lay in bringing the insights of Karl Barth, Rudolf Bultmann, and Martin Heidegger into fruitful conjunction. He sought to bridge Barth's Calvinist emphasis on the revealed Word of God with Rudolf Bultmann's Lutheran emphasis on the nature of human existence before God by employing a phenomenology of language derived in part from Heidegger's later position, arguing that both human existence and the being of God are ultimately linguistic-made available in language - and that theology is thus properly \\"faith's doctrine of language\\"(Sprachlehre des Glaubens). Theology's task is essentially hermeneutical, i.e.,theology translates Scripture into contemporary terms and contemporary existence into scriptural terms. Fuchs' interests is language event with existential philosophy. Conversely, the reality of God's love is verbalized in Jesus' word and deeds recorded in the Gospels and is thus preserved as language gain (Sprachgewinn). In the freedom of proclamation God's presence in the gospel and the \\"Yes of love: happens again - that is, comes to be as language, opening up the future to authentic existence (faith, hope, and love).

Bottom: 9-slice scaling, corners aren't distorted. 9-slice scaling (also known as Scale 9 grid or 9-slicing) is a 2D image resizing technique to proportionally scale an image by splitting it in a grid of nine parts. The key idea is to prevent image scaling distortion by protecting the pixels defined in 4 parts (corners) of the image and scaling or repeating the pixels in the other 5 parts. A variation of the concept, the 3-slice scaling, consists in a grid of 3 parts in which only the pixels in 2 parts (the edges) are protected and the pixels on the middle part are repeated.  History and use  The concept was first introduced in a consumer application by Macromedia in Flash 8 (2005). and it was available as feature to scale symbols. Later on, in 2007 Adobe introduced it as a feature in Adobe Fireworks CS3, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe Flash. Today is also present as a feature of game development software like Unreal engine, Urho3D, and Unity 3D. The technique can be used to manipulate both bitmap/raster graphics and vector graphics.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) deemed Maywood Chemical a Superfund site in 1983 and has since been in the clean process..  Origins  Maywood was established as a borough in 1894. Stepan Company purchased Maywood works in 1959 and renamed it Maywood Chemical Company. Maywood became a Superfund location in 1983 after radioactive thorium waste was processed through the borough.  Town history  Maywood was established as a borough on June 29, 1894. Maywood borders Hackensack, Lodi, Rochelle Park, and Paramus. Maywood is a mid-class community that features about 9,555 people living in community, the census is made up of about 74% white, 5% Black or African American, 10% Asian, and 6% other.  Company history  Maywood Chemical Company was involved in the creation of the Superfund site. This was mainly because of act of processing radioactive thorium waste from 1916 through 1955. Maywood Chemical was formerly known as Maywood Works before it was purchased by Stepan Company in 1955.  Superfund designation  Maywood Chemical Company was designated as a Superfund site in 1983. Since the designation, there has been state intervention which has involved community members filing a lawsuit against Stepan Company in 1997. National intervention has involved the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, who helped with cleanup.  State intervention  548 residents filed a lawsuit against Stepan Company in 1997 claiming that the operations of Maywood Chemical Works caused health problems that involved cancer and deficit disorder. The Lawsuit was filed after a study from the New Jersey Department of Health showed that the rate of brain and nervous system cancer was twice the national average. The lawsuit was settled in 1999.  National intervention  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has stepped in to help Maywood Chemical Company with the cleanup of the chemical waste within the Superfund site and is responsible of the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action (FUSRAP) contaminants which relates to all contaminations on the property, which is thorium. Stepan Company is responsible for all non-FUSRAP contamination, which is radiological soil cleanup.  Health and environmental hazards  The health and environmental hazards of radioactive thorium consists of effects in plant growth and dangers to humans and animals that involves cancers and disorders when exposed to thorium for periods of time.  Dangers to humans  Some effects to humans and animals consists of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and cancer. If inhaled, the thorium may stay in the lungs for an extensive period of time. All left over thorium in the body will be inserted into the bloodstream and then placed in the bones. This can cause lung and bone cancer.  Dangers to environment  The effects are not as harmful to the environment. Effects are only expected to occur when there are large amounts of exposure. When effected, thorium can be found in soil, rocks, water, and air, which then become hazardous to the area.  Cleanup  Maywood Chemical Company is currently in the cleanup stage and being cleaned by two entities, the U.S. Army Corps and Stepan Company. Cleanup includes the removal of soils contaminated with pollutants such as radioactive thorium  Initial cleanup  The initial cleanup consisted of testing in 1980-1983 from the State, EPA, and the Department of Energy (DOE). Testing revealed that there was low-levels of contamination at several locations. The site was then assigned to the DOE in 1984. The removal of soil was immediately started .  Current status  Maywood Chemical is still currently listed as a Superfund site. The USACE and Stepan Company are currently working to clean the site. The ongoing cleanup process involves soil cleanup work, removal and disposal of contaminated materials, and restricted land use.

Apte is notable for her many achievements in the field of pancreatic disease research, including becoming the first in the world to successfully isolate pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs), the cells associated with pancreatic fibrogenesis. The effectiveness of this isolation method allowed her team to prove that PSCs’ close communication with cancerous cells contributes to the aggressiveness of pancreatic cancer, a major discovery that led the government of New South Wales to award her The Premier’s Award for Woman of the Year in 2015. Education and career Apte was born in India to a family that encouraged its female members to seek education and to earn professional accomplishments. Her great-aunt was a gynecologist, and her aunt and grandmother were respectively principal and founder and principle of girl’s schools. As a high school student in 1974, Apte won the state prize for 100% marks in mathematics at the High School Certificate Exam. In 1982 she earned her MBBS from the University of Poona in India after graduating with honors with the intention of becoming an ophthalmologist. These plans were disrupted soon after her graduation, when Apte left India for Australia with her husband. While waiting to re-sit for the exams that would allow her to work as a doctor in Australia, Apte began volunteering for Newcastle Hospital’s pathology lab, where she developed an interest in medical research and especially research into the mechanisms behind pancreatic illness. Apte pursued this area of study at the University of New South Wales in Australia, from which she graduated with a Doctor of Philosophy in 1998, after becoming the first to successfully isolate PSCs. Honours and awards She was awarded the New South Wales Woman of the Year Award in 2015 for this achievement and her continuing research in the field of pancreatic illness.
