It was released on 11 December 2017 by Global Records and UMG in a partnership with supermarket chain Lidl. For this record, she collaborated with multiple producers, including Marcel Botezan, Sebastian Barac, Thomas Troelsen, Alex Cotoi and Vlad Lucan. It was entirely recorded at the studios of Global Records in Bucharest, Romania. Nirvana has been described as a pop album, with influences varying from electronic dance music (EDM), reggaeton and R&B; to Latin, club and tropical music. Upon its release, the album received positive reviews from music critics, who commended that Inna showcased her versatility as an artist, while criticizing the songs as lacking innovation and similar to her past material. To promote Nirvana, three singles, \\"Gimme Gimme\\", \\"Ruleta\\", and \\"Nirvana\\", preceded the record in 2017, to commercial success in some European countries. \\"Ruleta\\" notably reached number one in Lithuania and number three in Romania. The album itself failed to impact any country's charts. Background and release In April 2017, it was announced that Inna was working with Spanish disc jockey Sak Noel, who had previously remixed her single \\"Gimme Gimme\\" (2016). Publications also reported that the singer was working on an upcoming fifth studio album with producer David Ciente and Romanian singer and songwriter Irina Rimes, respectively. On 23 November 2017, the record's title and its cover were unveiled during an Instagram post on Inna's account. During a post on her blog, Inna explained the record's name: \\"Nirvana for me has a very simple meaning. It means 'cool', cause my new album is reeeeally cool! [...] My Nirvana is my family and my team, [...] when I perform on the stage and I see your happy faces, [...] [and] music and making people happy. My hope for this album is to help you find joy and peace of mind in this chaos called life. Even if just a little bit! That is Nirvana!\\" Producers on Nirvana include Marcel Botezan, Sebastian Barac, Thomas Troelsen, Alex Cotoi and Vlad Lucan; it was entirely recorded in the studios of Global Records in Bucharest, Romania. The tracklist of the album was revealed via Facebook on 27 November 2017. Nirvana was released in Romania on 11 December 2017 by Global Records and UMG, in a partnership with supermarket chain Lidl. The album's Japanese release followed in September 2018, also containing Inna's collaboration with Alexandra Stan and Daddy Yankee on \\"We Wanna\\" (2015). Composition Nirvana is a pop album; it opens with Inna's collaboration with Romanian singer Erik on \\"Ruleta\\", which is an English and Spanish language EDM and reggaeton-influenced song with touches of Indian and Caribbean music. The second track \\"Gimme Gimme\\" is a Bollywood, Indian and Gypsy-inspired pop track. A sample of British group Touch and Go's \\"Would You...?\\" (1998) is used during \\"My Dreams\\". \\"Tropical\\", Nirvana fourth track, features a trumpet in its instrumentation along with uncredited male reggae vocals; Jonathan Currinn of CelebMix identified the song as one of the album's highlights. Parts of tropical pop song \\"Hands Up\\" showcase Inna's falsetto voice, and its love-themed lyrics contain various metaphors, while \\"Nirvana\\" is a Latin-inspired club recording, featuring a portion of rap delivered in Spanish during its drop. R&B-influenced; \\"Don't Mind\\" features lyrics in both English and Spanish language, and is followed by \\"Lights\\", which is influenced by African music. Currinn wrote that the song allowed Inna to showcase her versatility as an artist. He compared \\"Lights\\" to Romanian recording artist Alexandra Stan's \\"La Fuega\\" from her third studio album Alesta (2016), writing: \\"[it] is going to be a Marmite track; some people will love it, some people are going to hate it.\\" Raluca ChirilƒÉ from InfoMusic considered the track for a standalone single release. Nirvana ends with tropical pop song \\"Dream About the Ocean\\", which \\"has an oceanic wave style to it\\" and whose lyrics deal with self confidence, and Romanian language ballads \\"Nota de platƒÉ\\", \\"Cum ar fi?\\" and \\"Tu »ôi eu\\". Reception Music critics were positive to mixed towards the album. Currinn of CelebMix gave a positive review of Nirvana, and thought that \\"each track is amazing but different in itself\\". He went on comparing album track \\"Hands Up\\" to \\"Endless\\" (2011), \\"Nirvana\\" to \\"Bop Bop\\" (2015) and \\"Heaven\\" (2016), \\"Don't Mind\\" to material from Barbadian singer Rihanna' catalog, and \\"Dream About the Ocean\\" to Inna's \\"Walking on the Sun\\" from her 2015 eponymous studio album. Currinn praised the majority of the record's material as highlights, concluding: \\"This whole album is a great collection of tracks, that truly show off Inna's versatility as an artist. She truly stuns everyone.\\" An editor of French website Just Focus praised the album's singles and selected tracks, although criticizing the lack of originality of other songs. They wrote: \\"The rest is truly the recycled Inna dance sound without any originality. This is the time to evolve, as most artists do now, including Lady Gaga, Rihanna, Kesha etc... Inna's music will always be welcome but the use of the same formula is not enough, especially in a current period in which artists are focusing more on innovation.\\" Promotion Three singles preceded Nirvana in 2017 (\\"Gimme Gimme\\", \\"Ruleta\\", and \\"Nirvana\\") to commercial success in Europe including Romania and Turkey. \\"Ruleta\\" notably peaked at number three in her native country, at number one in Lithuania, and at number five in Turkey.

The impact of vocabulary on proficiency in second language performance \\"has become [‚Ä¶] an object of considerable interest among researchers, teachers, and materials developers\\" (Huckin & Coady, 1999, p. 182). From being a \\"neglected aspect of language learning\\" (Meara, 1980, as cited in Xu & Hsu, 2017) vocabulary gained recognition in the literature and reclaimed its position in teaching. Educators shifted their attention from accuracy to fluency by moving from the Grammar translation method to communicative approaches to teaching. As a result, incidental vocabulary teaching and learning became one of the two major types of teaching programs along with the deliberate approach.  Goals of vocabulary learning  Vocabulary learning goals help in deciding the kind of language to be learnt and taught. Nation (2000) suggests three types of information to keep in mind while deciding on the goals. 1)number of words in the target language. 2) Number of words known by the native speakers. 3) The number of words required to use another language . It is very difficult to know all the words in a language as even native speakers don't know all the words. There are many specialized vocabularies that only a specific set of people know. In this context if somebody wants to count all the words in a language, it is useful to be familiar with terms such as tokens, types, lemmas, and word families. If we count the words as they appear in language, even if they are repeated, the words are called tokens. If we count all the words but not counting the repetition of a word, the words are called types. A lemma is the head word and some of its reduced and inflected forms. Types and strategies of vocabulary learning There are two major types of vocabulary learning: deliberate and incidental. Vocabulary learning types and low-frequency are important components in a vocabulary teaching program. The two major types of vocabulary learning are deliberate and low-frequency. It is important to treat these types as complementary -rather than mutually exclusive- by using different vocabulary learning strategies and their combinations. Scott Thornbury (2002) describes these types by stating that \\"some of the words will be learned actively\\", while others \\"will be picked up incidentally\\" (p. 32). Dodigovic (2013) and Nation (2006) emphasize the same distinction - only using a different term for the one side of this dichotomy: deliberate vocabulary learning. Nation (2006) also adds another nuance to this concept by calling it \\"deliberate, decontextualized vocabulary learning\\" (p. 495). Elgort (2011) to uses the term deliberate, while DeCarrico (2001) prefers to talk about \\"explicit versus implicit learning\\" (p. 10). Other authors, although employing various terminology are also in favor of this same distinction. For example, throughout their article, Alemi and Tayebi (2011) talk of ‚Äúincidental and intentional‚Äù vocabulary learning, as does also Hulstijn (2001). Expanding the terminology even further, Gu (2003) uses the terms ‚Äúexplicit and implicit learning mechanisms‚Äù throughout his article in discussing the second language learning strategies. Whatever terminology is used in the literature by different authors, the two major types of vocabulary learning are discussed: explicit and incidental. These two concepts should not be perceived as competitors but rather as mutually reinforcing (Nation, 2006b). In both types of vocabulary learning or their combination, the efficiency of learning is achieved by following one or more of the vocabulary learning strategies. Different researchers look into the nature of this concept from various perspectives. Given that vocabulary learning strategies are very diverse, Schmitt(2000) suggests a summary of major vocabulary learning strategies and classify them into five groups: determination, social, memory, cognitive and meta-cognitive. Building on this classification, Xu and Hsu (2017) suggest two major categories of vocabulary learning strategies ‚Äì direct and indirect. The first category includes four types of strategies: memory, cognitive and compensation strategies; the second category contains the meta-cognitive, effective and social strategies. Based on their research, Lawson and Hogben (1996) distinguish repetition as the major strategy of vocabulary learning, while Mokhtar et al. (2009) explain that ESL students prefer vocabulary strategies such as guessing and using a dictionary. =Deliberate Vocabulary Learning= One of the major types of vocabulary learning in language acquisition is deliberate vocabulary learning. Before moving on to presenting the literature, it is important to mention that when talking about deliberate vocabulary learning, various terminologies are used by different linguists and writers. Elgort and Warren (2014), as well as Schmitt (2000), use the term explicit (which is mostly used for grammar teaching), while Nation (2006) uses the word decontextualized vocabulary learning and contrasts the term with \\"learning from context\\" (p. 494) without explicitly using the term incidental vocabulary learning. Intentional vocabulary learning (Dodigovic, Jeaco & Wei, 2017; Hulstijn, 2001), active learning (Thornbury, 2002), and direct instruction (Lawrence et al., 2010) are also used. However, throughout this paper, the term deliberate (Elgort, 2011; Nation, 2006) will be used to refer to this concept. The advocates of deliberate vocabulary learning paradigm -for example, Coady, 1993; Nation, 1990, 2001, as cited in Ma & Kelly, 2006- agree that context is the main source for vocabulary acquisition. However, they also believe that in order to be able to build up sufficient vocabulary and acquire the necessary strategies to handle the context when reading, learners need support. Thus, extensive reading may be sufficient for developing advanced students‚Äô vocabulary, but it has to be supplemented with deliberate vocabulary learning at lower proficiency levels (Elgort & Warren, 2014). Kennedy (2003) supports this notion and argues that deliberate learning is more appropriate for students with up to an intermediate level of proficiency, while incidental learning, which can occur outside the classroom, is more valuable with higher proficiency students. The limited classroom time should be spent on the deliberate teaching of vocabulary (Schmitt, 2000), as the main problem of vocabulary teaching is that only a few words, or a small part of what is required to know a word, can be taught at a time (Ma & Kelly, 2006). Ma and Kelly (2006) argue that learning a word requires more ‚Äúdeliberate mental effort‚Äù than merely being engaged in meaning-focused activities. However, according to the authors, the advocates of deliberate approach believe that it should be combined with incidental learning to be more efficient. Schmitt (2000) demonstrates that deliberate vocabulary learning, unlike incidental learning, is time-consuming, and too laborious. Moreover, according to Nation (2005), deliberate vocabulary learning is ‚Äúone of the least efficient ways‚Äù to improve students‚Äô vocabulary knowledge. Yet, he claims that it is a vital component in vocabulary teaching programs. However, Schmitt (2000) states that deliberate vocabulary learning gives the learners the ‚Äúgreatest chance‚Äù for acquiring vocabulary, as it focuses their attention directly on the target vocabulary. He presents an important concept from the field of psychology: ‚Äúthe more one manipulates, thinks about, and uses mental information, the more likely it is that one will retain that information‚Äù (p. 121). The deeper the processing, the more likely it is for the newly learned words to be remembered. Therefore, explicit attention should also be given to vocabulary, especially when the aim is language-focused learning (Nation, 2006b). According to Ellis (1994, as cited in Laufer & Hulstijn, 2001), while the meaning of a word requires ‚Äúconscious processing‚Äù and is learned deliberately, the articulation of its form is learned incidentally because of frequent exposure. Ma and Kelly (2006) mention the necessity of establishing a link between the meaning and form of a word by various strategies, e.g., ‚Äúdirect memorization,‚Äù which is a strategy of deliberate vocabulary teaching. In vocabulary teaching programs, it is also necessary to consider the frequency of the words (Nation, 2006b). Thus, high-frequency words deserve to be taught explicitly (Kennedy, 2003) and sometimes even low-frequency words can be taught and learned deliberately, for example through word cards, word part analysis, and dictionary as recommended by Nation (2006b). However, when measuring the difficulty by the results, deliberate vocabulary learning is easier than incidental learning, yet it needs more focused effort. Therefore, directing deliberate attention to the particular aspect can lighten \\"the learning burden\\" (Nation, 2006a). To sum up, deliberate vocabulary learning is essential to reach a threshold of the vocabulary size and it is a prerequisite to incidental learning (Schmitt, 2000). =Incidental Vocabulary Learning= Another type of vocabulary learning is called incidental vocabulary learning. By its nature, incidental vocabulary learning is one of the key aspects of language acquisition. This concept, which is also referred to as passive learning (Shmidth, 1990; as cited in Alemi & Tayebi, 2011) or implicit learning (Gu, 2003), is the process of acquiring vocabulary without placing the focus on specific words to be learned (Paribakht & Wesche, 1999). It is deemed that, this type of learning should occur with low-frequency words (Nation, 2005) as the first few thousand words are better learned through deliberate learning approach (Huckin & Coady 1999). However, this may be hampered by the fact that several encounters with a word are needed before it is committed to memory (Nation, 1990), which may not be possible with low- frequency words (Nation 1990). Aelmi and Tayebi (2011) as well as Schmitt (2000) link incidental vocabulary learning with the communicative context. The formers stress that incidental vocabulary learning occurs by \\"picking up structures and lexicon of a language, through getting engaged in a variety of communicative activities\\" (p. 82), while the latter indicates that producing language for communicational purposes results in incidental learning. There is a number of factors which affect the occurrence of incidental vocabulary learning. Most of the scholars agree that the best way is through extensive reading (Jian-ping, 2013; Restrepo Ramos, 2015). Restrepo Ramos (2015) indicates that ‚Äúthere is strong evidence that supports the occurrence of incidental vocabulary learning through reading for meaning comprehension‚Äù (p. 164). However, as research shows, 95% of the words must be familiar to the reader to understand a text (Hirsh & Nation, 1992; Laufer, 1989). According to Nation (2009), this figure is even higher, i.e., 98 percent. Huckin & Coady (1999), on the other hand, argue that \\"extensive reading for meaning does not automatically lead to the acquisition of vocabulary. Much depends on the context surrounding each word, and the nature of the learner's attention\\" (p. 183). While Dodigovic (2015) finds that it is the approach that matters, i.e., the bottom-up processing of readings is better than the top-down. Thus, to develop incidental vocabulary learning, the learners should be exposed to the words in different informative contexts, following the bottom-up processing of the readings.

The hydrographic slope of the Kauskatitineu River is served on the West side by the northern route from Matagami. The surface of the river is usually frozen from early November to mid-May, however, safe ice circulation is generally from mid-November to mid-April.  Geography  The main hydrographic slopes near the Kauskatitineu River are: *North side: Columbus Lake, Broadback River, Rupert River, Du Tast Lake; *East side: Dana Lake (Eeyou Istchee Baie-James), Iyinu Kaniput River, Evans Lake, Broadback River; *South side: Matawawaskweyau River, Muskiki River, Nottaway River, Soscumica Lake; *West side: Chabouilli√© Lake, Rodayer Lake, Dusaux Lake, Nottaway River.

After comments by Naz Shah in 2014 and Ken Livingstone in 2016 resulted in their suspension from membership pending investigation, Corbyn established the Chakrabarti Inquiry, which concluded that the party was not \\"overrun by anti-Semitism or other forms of racism\\", although there was an \\"occasionally toxic atmosphere\\" and \\"clear evidence of ignorant attitudes\\". The Home Affairs Select Committee of Parliament held an inquiry into antisemitism in the UK in the same year and found \\"no reliable, empirical evidence to support the notion that there is a higher prevalence of antisemitic attitudes within the Labour Party than any other political party\\", though the leadership's lack of action \\"risks lending force to allegations that elements of the Labour movement are institutionally antisemitic\\". In 2017, Labour Party rules were changed to make hate speech, including antisemitism, a disciplinary matter. In 2018, Corbyn was challenged for querying in 2012 the removal of Freedom for Humanity, an allegedly antisemitic mural, in response to a Facebook post from the artist, and for having been a member of Facebook groups, mainly pro-Palestinian, containing antisemitic posts. In July of that year, Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) adopted a definition of antisemitism, for disciplinary purposes, that included the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) Working Definition, with modified examples relating to how criticism of Israel could stray into antisemitism. In September of that year, the NEC added all 11 IHRA examples, unamended, to the definition of antisemitism, and included them in the Party's code of conduct. In February and July 2019, Labour issued information on investigations into complaints of antisemitism against individuals, with around 350 members resigning, being expelled or receiving formal warnings, equating to around 0.08% of the membership. Also in February 2019, nine MPs resigned from the party, citing Labour's leftward political direction and its handling of allegations of antisemitism and of Brexit ‚Äì most of them then formed The Independent Group. In May 2019, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) announced an inquiry into whether Labour had \\"unlawfully discriminated against, harassed or victimised people because they are Jewish\\". In July, the party published online educational material on combatting antisemitism and promoted it to all members. In April 2020, an 860-page report into the handling of antisemitism by the party concluded that there was \\"no evidence\\" that antisemitism complaints were treated any differently than other forms of complaint, or of current or former staff being \\"motivated by antisemitic intent\\". 20th century =Second Boer War and \\"Jewish finance\\"= In the late 19th century, antisemitism was common throughout British society, and this was reflected in political parties, including Liberals and the Labour movement. During the Second Boer War (1899‚Äì1902), Labour figures opposed to the war asserted that Jewish gold mining operators and financiers were a driving force behind it, with Labour leader Keir Hardie asserting that Jewish financial houses were part of a secretive \\"imperialist\\" cabal that promoted war. According to Judd and Surridge in The Boer War: A History, the Independent Labour Party and the Trade Union Congress all blamed \\"Jewish capitalists\\" as \\"being behind the war and imperialism in general\\". =Jewish immigration and the Balfour Declaration= From 1880 to 1921, Britain's Anglo-Jewish community grew fourfold from 80,000 to 317,000 due to immigration from Eastern Europe and the high birth rate of the arriving population. British Jews during the 20th century generally supported the labour movement. The UK arm of Poale Zion, a Jewish workers movement, called Poale Zion (Great Britain), later the Jewish Labour Movement, affiliated to the Labour Party in 1920. Many prominent Labour leaders had an affinity with the goals of Labour Zionism, but were initially reluctant to press for parliamentary support for relieving obstacles to Jewish immigration to Palestine, given the party's commitment to an anti-imperialistic policy. In 1920, they gave unqualified support to both the Balfour Declaration and the British Mandate for Palestine. The basic principles that evolved stressed (a) gradual growth of a Jewish homeland through selective immigration; (b) the formation of a binational society and (c) criticism of Zionism's separatist agenda. =Support for Israel= Generally, Labour support for Israel continued, in the expectancy that the Labour Zionist strand in Jewish state- building would lead to socialism and development in the Middle East generally. Ernest Bevin, Britain's Foreign Secretary from 1945 to 1951, was critical of Zionist goals; he argued that Jews should be convinced to resettle in Europe, and said that Americans supported Jewish immigration to Palestine because \\"they did not want too many Jews in New York\\". Bevin also voiced antisemitic canards between Jews and finance, as well as communism. There is no evidence that this affected his political decisions. =Growing sympathy for Palestine= Aberystwyth University's James R. Vaughn says the rise of a radical anti-Zionism in the Labour Party started with the creation of the Labour Middle East Council in 1969 by Christopher Mayhew. Dave Rich concurs that Mayhew founded the council in order to change the \\"pro-Israel\\" position of the Labour Party and references the influence of pro-Palestinian activists within the Young Liberals. By the 1980s, with the election of Menachem Begin's Likud party, the emergence of messianic nationalism, neo-liberal economic reforms, the occupation of the West Bank and of the Gaza Strip, and the decline of the Israeli Labor Party, socialism declined in Israel. These factors contributed to falling Labour support for Israel, at the same time as there was growing sympathy for Palestinian aspirations for statehood. According to June Edmunds, Lecturer in Sociology of the University of Sussex, the party's leadership was initially supportive of Israel but shifted to support Palestine in the early 1980s, although the membership did not; later challenges to this shift eventually resulted in a more balanced view of both sides and broad support for a two-state solution. Edmunds credits the shift towards Palestine aspirations to more moderate appeals by Palestinians, a sharp shift to the right in Israeli politics and an increase in anti-colonial politics among the left. Richard Seymour wrote in 2018 that \\"Palestinian rights have been a growing concern in the British Left since the 1982 Sabra and Shatila massacre\\" when \\"the British trade union movement and the Labour Party began to break with Israel in response\\". The Labour Committee on Palestine was formed in June 1982 to challenge the Labour Middle East Council, which supported a two-state solution, and to oppose the \\"Zionist state as racist, exclusivist, expansionist and a direct agency of imperialism\\". Labour politicians Ken Livingstone of the Greater London Council and Ted Knight of the Lambeth London Borough Council were early supporters; the chair was former British Anti-Zionist Organization (BAZO) activist Tony Greenstein. The new Committee backed a resolution at the 1982 Labour Party Conference to recognise the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as the \\"sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people\\", which passed at the Conference, \\"embarrassing\\" the Party leadership. Antisemitic attitudes are said to have been rare in the Labour Party in the 1980s. In his 2012 book, The British Left and Zionism: History of a Divorce, Manchester University's Paul Kelemen ascribed the shift in Labour's views to Israel's increasingly right-leaning politics and to the left's opposition to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. He found no evidence that antisemitism played a role in the left's changing perceptions of the Israeli Palestinian conflict in that period. Daniel L. Staetsky, a senior research fellow for the Institute for Jewish Policy Research, stated in his 2017 study Antisemitism in Contemporary Great Britain: A Study of Attitudes Towards Jews and Israel that, in the 1980s, parts of the political left assumed strong pro-Palestinian and anti- Israel positions, and faced accusations of antisemitism within the Labour Party. He found that anti-Israeli positions did not correlate generally with antisemitism, since the majority of those surveyed who were critical of Israel did not espouse an antisemitic attitude \\"We have discovered that anti-Israel attitudes are not, as a general rule, antisemitic. This is to say that a significant proportion of those who hold anti-Israel attitudes, a majority in fact, do not espouse any antisemitic attitudes\\" and that antisemitism on the left was no higher than that of the general population. 'Levels of antisemitism among those on the left-wing of the political spectrum, including the far-left, are indistinguishable from those found in the general population. Yet, all parts of those on the left of the political spectrum ‚Äì including the 'slightly left-of-centre,' the 'fairly left-wing' and the 'very left-wing' ‚Äì exhibit higher levels of anti-Israelism than average. The most antisemitic group on the political spectrum consists of those who identify as very right-wing: the presence of antisemitic attitudes in this group is two to four times higher compared to the general population. Although the prevalence of antisemitism on the far right is considerably higher than on the left and in the political centre, the far right remains marginal in British politics in general, as well as on the broader political right. =Jewish voting intentions= In the 1980s, much of the Jewish population supported Margaret Thatcher, especially in her own seat of Finchley. Tony Blair and Gordon Brown were both patrons of the Jewish National Fund and members of Labour Friends of Israel and many Jewish voters returned to Labour in the late 1990s under New Labour, with polling generally showing Jews as evenly split between Labour and Conservatives, which remained the case in 2010, when Labour elected its first Jewish leader, Ed Miliband, who narrowly defeated his brother, David Miliband. 2000‚Äì2015 =Tested election posters= In the run-up to the 2005 United Kingdom general election, the Labour Party, under Tony Blair, tested posters which TBWA, Labour's advertising agency, later said originated from Campaign Director Alastair Campbell. One depicted the faces of Conservative Party leader Michael Howard and Shadow Chancellor Oliver Letwin, who are Jewish, superimposed upon flying pigs. The slogan was \\"The Day Tory Sums Add Up\\" and the poster illustrated the adynaton, when pigs fly, used for something that will never happen. A second poster was of Michael Howard swinging a pocket watch on its chain with the slogan \\"I can spend the same money twice!\\" somewhat suggestive of stage hypnosis, where the subject is persuaded to accept false suggestions as true. Conservative backbencher Ann Widdecombe had suggested Howard, whose father was born in Romania, had an image problem in that he had \\"something of the night about him\\". Labour strategists leapt at this by then depicting Howard as a Dracula figure swinging a hypnotic watch. The pose was said by The Jewish Chronicle to be reminiscent of fictional Jewish, criminal, characters, such as the moneylender, Shylock, from Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice and the master pickpocket, Fagin, from Dickens' Oliver Twist. The posters were not used and Labour denied any antisemitic intent. They prompted protests from some Jewish groups but the Board of Deputies of British Jews declined to raise the issue. =Concern over Israel lobby= In 2003, Labour MP Tam Dalyell claimed, referring to the Israel lobby in the United States, that \\"there is far too much Jewish influence in the United States\\" and that \\"a cabal of Jewish advisers\\" was directing American and British policy on Iraq, stating that six of seven hawkish advisers to President George Bush were Jewish, close to Ariel Sharon's Likud, and also singling out Michael Levy, chief fundraiser for Tony Blair and his Middle East envoy for nine years. Eric Moonman stated he didn't think Dalyell, a close associate of Richard Crossman, antisemitic, but that his language could be taken as supportive of that outlook. In 2010, Labour MP Martin Linton said, in reference to the Israel lobby in the UK, \\"There are long tentacles of Israel in this country who are funding election campaigns and putting money into the British political system for their own ends,\\" while his Jewish fellow Labour MP Gerald Kaufman said that right-wing Jewish millionaires had large stakes in the Conservative Party. Community Security Trust spokesman Mark Gardner responded: \\"Anybody who understands antisemitism will recognise just how ugly and objectionable these quotes are, with their imagery of Jewish control and money power.\\" In 2015, Kaufman said that \\"Jewish money, Jewish donations to the Conservative Party ... [and] support from the Jewish Chronicle\\" had led to \\"a big group of Conservative MPs who are pro- Israel whatever (its) government does\\", referring to the Conservative Friends of Israel; Corbyn condemned Kaufman's remarks at the time as \\"completely unacceptable\\". In 2010, Ed Miliband became Labour's first ever Jewish leader. In August 2014, Miliband was criticised by Jewish donors and supporters for describing Israel's ground incursion into Gaza in summer 2014 as \\"wrong and unjustifiable\\". Jewish support for Labour fell to 15% in the May 2015 general election, compared to 64% for the Conservatives. =Livingstone's comments= In 2005, Livingstone was accused of antisemitism after he asked Evening Standard reporter Oliver Finegold if he had been \\"a German war criminal.\\" When the reporter said he was Jewish, Livingstone said he was \\"just like a concentration camp guard, you are just doing it because you are paid to, aren't you?\\" and asserted that he (Finegold) worked for the \\"reactionary bigots... who supported fascism\\" at the Daily Mail. The Evening Standard was then a sister of the Mail, which had been supportive of fascism in the 1930s. =Corbyn's backbench record= Jeremy Corbyn is a patron of the Palestinian Solidarity Campaign and had campaigned extensively for Palestinian rights during his 32 years as a backbencher. In August 2015, as Corbyn emerged as a front-runner in the Labour Party leadership election, The Jewish Chronicle devoted its front page to seven questions regarding Corbyn's associations with those it described as \\"Holocaust deniers, terrorists and some outright antisemites\\", although Corbyn said he met with them in his search for peace in the Middle East.‚Äî  These included his relationship with Islamist organisations Hezbollah and Hamas, organisations that Corbyn called \\"friends\\" (although he has stated he disagrees with their views); and his failure to object to what the Chronicle described as antisemitic banners and posters that \\"dominate\\" the London Quds Day rallies supported by the organisation, Stop the War Coalition, of which Corbyn was national chair from 2011 to 2015. Two of the questions related to \\"Deir Yassin Remembered\\", an organisation commemorating the massacre of over 100 Palestinian villagers in 1948 and founded by Holocaust denier Paul Eisen.Labour condemned by Holocaust survivor at launch of memorial design exhibition, The Jewish Chronicle 4 September 2018 Up to 2013, Jeremy Corbyn and Jewish Labour MP Gerald Kaufman attended \\"two or three\\" of the group's annual events. Corbyn has said that this had taken place before Eisen had made his views known publicly, and that he would not have associated with him had he known. It was reported that Eisen's views were known in 2005 and that he had written an essay on his website in 2008 entitled \\"My life as a Holocaust denier\\".\\"Labour condemned by Holocaust survivor at launch of memorial design exhibition\\", The Jewish Chronicle 4 September 2018 Labour MP Diane Abbott defended Corbyn by calling his critics part of a \\"Westminster elite\\" afraid of Corbyn's anti-austerity agenda. 47 prominent Jewish activists, including Laurence Dreyfus, Selma James, Miriam Margolyes, Ilan Papp√©, Michael Rosen and Avi Shlaim were signatories to a letter criticising The Jewish Chronicles reporting of Corbyn's association with alleged antisemites. 2016 =Shah, Livingstone and Walker's comments= In April 2016, after it was revealed that Labour MP Naz Shah had, during the 2014 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict and before she became an MP, shared a graphic of Israel superimposed on the U.S. with the caption \\"Solution for Israel-Palestine conflict ‚Äì relocate Israel into United States\\", adding the comment, \\"Problem solved\\". She was suspended pending investigation, but reinstated after agreeing to apologise for bringing the party into disrepute. By May 2016, the Labour Party had suspended 56 members for statements alleged to be antisemitic, pending investigation; these comprised 0.4% of the parliamentary group, 0.07% of Labour councillors, and 0.012% of the Party membership. The graphic that Shah shared was created by American political scientist Norman Finkelstein, who described the controversy as \\"obscene\\". Referring to those on the right of the Labour Party allegedly using the scandal to undermine Corbyn, Finkelstein asked \\"What are they doing? Don't they have any respect for the dead? ... All these desiccated Labour apparatchiks, dragging the Nazi holocaust through the mud for the sake of their petty jostling for power and position. Have they no shame?\\" Former London Mayor Ken Livingstone defended Shah and said he had never heard antisemitic comments from Labour members. Livingstone added: \\"When Hitler won his election in 1932 his policy then was that Jews should be moved to Israel. He was supporting Zionism before he went mad and ended up killing six million Jews.\\" After being suspended for a year, a hearing in April 2017 by the National Constitutional Committee determined he was guilty of prejudicial and detrimental conduct and suspended him from standing for office or representing the party at any level for a further year. In May 2018, he resigned from the party, saying the issues surrounding his suspension had become a distraction. In a statement Livingstone said, \\"I do not accept the allegation that I have brought the Labour Party into disrepute ‚Äì nor that I am in any way guilty of antisemitism. I abhor antisemitism, I have fought it all my life and will continue to do so.\\" In May 2016, the vice- chair of Momentum, Jackie Walker, was investigated by the party over private comments she made on Facebook exaggerating the role of Jews in the Atlantic slave trade. Walker said her words had been taken out of context and no further action was taken following the investigation. Jon Lansman, the chair of Momentum, defended her, describing the media as \\"a 'lynch mob' whose interest in combating racism is highly selective\\". Following that year's Party Conference, at which Walker asked in a training session why Holocaust Memorial Day did not include pre-1940 genocides such as the Atlantic slave trade, she was removed from her Momentum position, while remaining on its steering committee, after Manuel Cortes, the general secretary of the TSSA union, said their funding would be reconsidered otherwise. Lansman called Walker's comments \\"ill-informed, ill-judged and offensive\\", but not antisemitic. The party suspended her from membership, pending investigation. Walker said that she \\"utterly condemn[s] antisemitism\\", that her words were taken out of context, and that \\"I would never play down the significance of the Shoah. Working with many Jewish comrades, I continue to seek to bring greater awareness of other genocides, which are too often forgotten or minimised. If offence has been caused, it is the last thing I would want to do and I apologise.\\" She was expelled from the party for misconduct in March 2019. =Inquiries into antisemitism= Following the suspensions, Corbyn commissioned an inquiry into antisemitism and other forms of racism in April 2016, led by Shami Chakrabarti, a barrister and the former head of the human rights advocacy group Liberty. She joined the Labour Party when appointed to, she said, show that she had members' interests and values at heart. The inquiry had two deputy chairs: Jan Royall, who was also investigating allegations of antisemitism at Oxford University Labour Club, and David Feldman, Director of the Pears Institute for the Study of Antisemitism. In 2007, Feldman was a signatory to Independent Jewish Voices, which in May 2016 described some allegations of antisemitism within Labour as \\"baseless and disingenuous\\", and Chakrabarti said he distanced himself from this comment. In June, the inquiry reported that it had found \\"no evidence\\" of systemic antisemitism in Labour, though there was an \\"occasionally toxic atmosphere\\", and made 20 recommendations, including outlawing offensive terms and improving disciplinary procedures. Responses comprised both acceptance and criticism. Jeremy Newmark, chair of the Jewish Labour Movement, said: \\"It's a strong platform for the party to ... set a gold standard in tackling racism and anti- Semitism.\\" John Mann MP, chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Antisemitism, called it \\"hugely significant\\". The Jewish Leadership Council and Community Security Trust jointly welcomed aspects of it. The Board of Deputies of British Jews said: \\"We hope that the implementation of this report will be rigorous and swift.\\" Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis also called for a \\"full and unhesitating implementation of the report's findings\\". Chakrabarti was Labour's sole nomination to the House of Lords in David Cameron's August 2016 Resignation Honours. She became a peer in September and the following month was appointed Shadow Attorney General. Commentators were immediately more critical, with the report being described as a \\"whitewash for peerage scandal\\" by the Board of Deputies of British JewsBook and documentary to launch on Labour's 'Whitewash' inquiry , The Jewish Chronicle, Daniel Sugarman, 23 June 2017Shami Chakrabarti handed peerage weeks after suppressing Jeremy Corbyn interview from 'whitewash' anti-Semitism report , Telegraph, Christopher Hope and Laura Hughes, 5 August 2016Honours list: Jeremy Corbyn accused of 'buying' Labour anti-Semitism report after author is given peerage , Independent, Caroline Mortimer, 4 August 2016 while British author Howard Jacobson called the inquiry \\"a brief and shoddy shuffling of superficies\\" that \\"spoke to very few of the people charging the party with anti-Semitism and understood even fewer of their arguments\\", and suggested that the peerage was showing contempt for those who had raised issues over antisemitism in the party. In April 2018, Chakrabarti accepted that some recommendations had not been implemented and said that the new Labour Party General Secretary, Jennie Formby, would make this a priority. Following allegations of antisemitism within the Oxford University Labour Club, an inquiry was launched by Labour Students, chaired by Jan Royall. The party's National Executive Committee accepted the report in May 2016. The report found that there was \\"no evidence the club is itself institutionally anti-Semitic\\", though there was a \\"cultural problem\\" in which (antisemitic) \\"behaviour and language that would once have been intolerable is now tolerated\\". In October, the House of Commons Home Affairs Select Committee held an inquiry into antisemitism in the United Kingdom. The committee found \\"no reliable, empirical evidence to support the notion that there is a higher prevalence of antisemitic attitudes within the Labour Party than any other party.\\" It was critical of Corbyn's response to antisemitic incidents against Labour MPs and described the Chakrabarti inquiry as \\"ultimately compromised\\". The report also found that \\"the failure of the Labour Party to deal consistently and effectively with anti-Semitic incidents in recent years risks lending force to allegations that elements of the Labour movement are institutionally anti-Semitic\\". =Muslim prejudice= In May 2016, Baroness Ruth Deech said that \\"Too many Labour politicians cravenly adopted the anti-Semitic tropes and anti-Israel demonization they think will get them British Muslim votes, rather than standing up to the prejudice that exists in the community\\".Why the Labour Party Won't Confront British Muslim anti-Semitism , Ha'aretz, Ruth Deech, 4 May 2016 In the same month, Dr. Manfred Gerstenfeld said that, while not all of the most extreme antisemitic slurs were made by Muslim representatives of Labour, they represent a disproportionately large proportion of antisemitic perpetrators. According to Gerstenfeld, Labour's issue with antisemitism \\"demonstrate what happens when a party bends over backward to attract Muslim voters\\".Muslims play a prominent role among Labour party anti-Semitic inciters , Dr. Manfred Gerstenfeld, Arutz Sheva, 8 May 2016 2017 =Jewish constituencies in the general election= During the 2017 general election campaign, Jeremy Newmark, the chairman of the Jewish Labour Movement, said that \\"Jeremy Corbyn appears to have failed to understand the nature of contemporary anti-Semitism in the same way that it's understood by most of its target group\\". Labour MP Wes Streeting criticised the party's record on antisemitism, saying \\"I don't think many Jewish voters in my constituency have been very impressed with the way the Labour Party as a whole have responded\\", but denied that Corbyn was antisemitic. According to polling in 2015, politicians' attitudes towards Israel influence the vote of three out of four British Jews.\\"Huge majority of British Jews will vote Tory, JC poll reveals\\". The Jewish Chronicle, 7 April 2015\\"How Ed Miliband Lost Britain's Jewish Voters\\". The Jewish Daily Forward, 8 April 2015 It is estimated that 26% of Jewish voters voted for Labour. Analysis by election analysts Prof Stephen Fisher, Prof Rob Ford, Prof Sir John Curtice and Patrick English based on The British General Election of 2017 by Philip Cowley and Dennis Kavanagh suggests that, in the five UK constituencies where, according to the 2011 Census, more than 10% of the population identify as Jewish: Finchley and Golders Green (21.1%), Hendon (17.0%), Hertsmere (14.3%), Hackney North and Stoke Newington (11.3%) and Bury South (10.2%), Labour's vote share at the 2017 general election increased by seven share points on average, almost three points less than the national average. This includes an above- average swing to Labour in Hackney North and Stoke Newington. =Hate speech made a disciplinary offence= During the 2017 Labour Party Conference, new rules proposed by the Jewish Labour Movement and supported by Jeremy Corbyn were adopted on hate speech. Previously, party members could not be disciplined for \\"the mere holding or expression of beliefs and opinions\\". Under the new rules, those who express antisemitic or other forms of hate speech, including racism, Islamophobia, sexism and homophobia, or other \\"conduct prejudicial to the Party\\", can be disciplined. =Authors' public letter= In November 2017, Jewish authors Howard Jacobson, Simon Schama, and Simon Sebag Montefiore in a letter to The Times, said \\"We are alarmed that during the past few years, constructive criticism of Israeli governments has morphed into something closer to antisemitism under the cloak of so-called anti-Zionism\\", further stating \\"Although anti-Zionists claim innocence of any antisemitic intent, anti-Zionism frequently borrows the libels of classical Jew-hating,\\" and adding \\"Accusations of international Jewish conspiracy and control of the media have resurfaced to support false equations of Zionism with colonialism and imperialism, and the promotion of vicious, fictitious parallels with genocide and Nazism\\".Howard Jacobson, Simon Schama Condemn Labour Party's Failure To Address Anti-Semitism , The Forward, Talya Zax, 7 November 2017 2018 =Corbyn's backbench record= Jeremy Corbyn's defenders have cited his record of opposing and campaigning against racism and antisemitism, and supporting Jewish communal initiatives. He organised a demonstration against a 1970s National Front march through Wood Green; spoke on the 80th anniversary of the Battle of Cable Street, noting that his mother was a protester; signed numerous Early Day Motions condemning antisemitism; in 1987, campaigned to reverse Islington Council's decision to grant the planning application to destroy a Jewish cemetery; and in 2010, called on the UK government to facilitate the settlement of Yemeni Jews in Britain. He also took part in a ceremony in his Islington constituency to commemorate the original site of the North London Synagogue and visited the Theresienstadt Ghetto, calling it a reminder of the dangers of far-right politics, antisemitism and racism. His defenders have criticised the tactics of opponents and the role of the media. The following actions by Corbyn when he was a backbencher were the subject of criticism. Talk by Hajo Meyer In January 2010, during the UK's Holocaust Memorial week, Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn co-chaired a meeting in the House of Commons, with the main talk by anti- Zionist Auschwitz survivor Hajo Meyer entitled, \\"The Misuse of the Holocaust for Political Purposes\\", where Israel was compared to the Nazis. Meyer said \\"Judaism in Israel has been substituted by the Holocaust religion, whose high priest is Elie Wiesel.\\" In August 2018, Louise Ellman MP told the BBC that she was \\"absolutely appalled\\" at Corbyn for chairing Meyer's talk. When asked about his involvement with the meeting, Corbyn said that \\"Views were expressed at the meeting which I do not accept or condone. In the past, in pursuit of justice for the Palestinian people and peace in Israel/Palestine, I have on occasion appeared on platforms with people whose views I completely reject. I apologise for the concerns and anxiety that this has caused\\". Renaming of Holocaust Memorial Day In January 2011, a motion was submitted to rename Holocaust Memorial Day to \\"Genocide Memorial Day\\", supported by 23 MPs, mainly from the Labour Party and including Corbyn. Karen Pollock, chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust said in 2018 that \\"Holocaust Memorial Day already rightly includes all victims of the Nazis and subsequent genocides, but the Holocaust was a specific crime, with anti-Semitism at its core. Any attempt to remove that specificity is a form of denial and distortion.\\" Labour responded by saying that \\"this was a cross-party initiative, jointly sponsored by a senior Conservative MP, to emphasize the already broader character of Holocaust Memorial Day. It is not our policy to seek a name change for this important commemoration\\".Labour Leader Corbyn Backed Call to Replace 'Holocaust' With 'Genocide' for Official Memorial Day, Haaretz, 2 August 2018Corbyn has led Labour into a nightmare of his own making, The Sunday Times, 4 August 2018 John A. Hobson's foreword In 2011, Corbyn wrote the foreword for a republication of the 1902 book Imperialism: A Study, by John A. Hobson, which contains the assertion that finance was controlled \\"by men of a single and peculiar race, who have behind them many centuries of financial experience\\" who \\"are in a unique position to control the policy of nations\\". In his foreword, Corbyn called the book a \\"great tome\\" and \\"brilliant, and very controversial at the time\\". Corbyn was criticised for his words in 2019, after his foreword was reported by Conservative peer Daniel Finkelstein in The Times.Jeremy Corbyn endorsed book about Jews controlling banks and the press, The Times, 1 May 2019Corbyn's praise for deeply antisemitic book, The Times, Daniel Finkelstein, 30 April 2019Jewish leaders demand explanation over Corbyn book foreword, The Guardian, Heather Stewart and Sarah Marsh, 1 May 2019 Corbyn responded that the language used to describe minorities in Hobson's work is \\"absolutely deplorable\\", but asserted that his foreword analysed \\"the process which led to the first world war\\" which he saw as the subject of the book and not Hobson's language. Hobson was also cited and praised by previous Labour leaders. In 2005, Gordon Brown said in a Chatham House speech: \\"This idea of liberty as empowerment is not a new idea, J. A. Hobson asked, 'is a man free who has not equal opportunity with his fellows of such access to all material and moral means of personal development and work as shall contribute to his own welfare and that of his society?'\\" Tony Blair described Hobson as \\"probably the most famous Liberal convert to what was then literally 'new Labour'.\\" Response to mural The 2012 Freedom for Humanity was a street mural painted in east London by American artist Mear One. The artwork depicted what Mear One described as an \\"elite banker cartel\\" of the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the Morgans and others sitting around a Monopoly-style board game on the backs of men with dark complexions. The temporary mural was later removed prematurely by Tower Hamlets council following complaints by residents. Lutfur Rahman, then Mayor of Tower Hamlets, said \\"the images of the bankers perpetuate antisemitic propaganda about conspiratorial Jewish domination of financial and political institutions\\". In response, Mear One denied that the mural was antisemitic; he said that the mural was about \\"class and privilege\\", and pointed out that the figures depicted included both \\"Jewish and white Anglos\\". According to historian Deborah E. Lipstadt, as well as contemporary local media, the Jewish caricatures resembled the imagery used by Der St√ºrmer in Nazi Germany. Corbyn, who responded to a Facebook post from the artist, containing an image of the mural, lamenting its removal and referencing freedom of expression, before it had been criticised in the media, asked \\"Why? You are in good company. Rockerfeller(sic) destroyed Diego Viera's mural because it includes a picture of Lenin,\\" referring to Nelson Rockefeller's destruction of Diego Rivera's Man at the Crossroads fresco in 1934. In March 2018, Labour MP Luciana Berger asked Corbyn why he had questioned the mural's removal. Corbyn's spokesman issued a statement later in the day: \\"Jeremy was responding to concerns about the removal of public art on grounds of freedom of speech. The mural was offensive, used antisemitic imagery, which has no place in our society, and it is right that it was removed\\". Berger said the response was \\"wholly inadequate\\". In his own statement, Corbyn said: \\"I sincerely regret that I did not look more closely at the image I was commenting on, the contents of which are deeply disturbing and antisemitic,\\" he said. \\"The defence of free speech cannot be used as a justification for the promotion of antisemitism in any form. That is a view I've always held.\\" Karen Pollock of the Holocaust Educational Trust said that the mural was \\"indefensible\\" as it \\"was blatantly anti-Semitic, using images commonly found in anti-Semitic propaganda ‚Äì it is impossible not to notice\\". Jeremy Gilbert, professor of cultural and political theory at the University of East London argued that this accusation is based on a logical fallacy, saying that the allegation \\"amounts to a mere argument from resemblance: because anti-capitalist discourse and anti-Semitic discourse share some structural features, they are fundamentally the same\\". For example, both anti-capitalist discourse and antisemitic discourse are often conspiratorial in nature; but similarity does not denote the same motive or intent. Comments about certain Zionists In a January 2013 meeting in Parliament, the UK Palestinian Authority representative Manuel Hassassian said that Jews are \\"the only children of God ... because nobody is stopping Israel building its messianic dream of Eretz Israel [the Land of Israel]\\". Pro-Israel activists at the meeting then challenged Hassassian. In August 2018, MailOnline released footage of comments that Corbyn had made a few days after this event at Friends House in Euston, convened by the Palestinian Return Centre. There, he defended the earlier comments made by Hassassian on the history of Palestine, which, he said, were \\"dutifully recorded by the thankfully silent Zionists\\" in the audience. Corbyn went on to say that these \\"Zionists\\" had approached Hassassian and \\"berated him afterwards for what he had said\\", and that these \\"Zionists\\" had \\"two problems\\": \\"One is that they don't want to study history and secondly, having lived in this country for a very long time, probably all their lives, they don't understand English irony either. Manuel [Hassassian] does understand English irony and uses it very, very effectively so I think they need two lessons which we can help them with\\". His comments were accused by some of being coded antisemitism, including by Labour MPs Luciana Berger, Wes Streeting, Mike Gapes, Catherine McKinnell, and political strategist John McTernan. A number of Conservative MPs reported Corbyn to the parliamentary standards watchdog over the comments. Historian Deborah Lipstadt, writing in The Atlantic, asserted that Corbyn had crossed the line from anti-Zionism to antisemitism. Corbyn's remarks were defended by shadow chancellor John McDonnell, who argued that the comments were \\"taken out of context\\". A Labour spokesperson said that parts of the speech which contexualised Corbyn's language were \\"edited out of the footage ... He had been speaking about Zionists and non-Zionist Jews and very clearly does not go on to use Zionists as any kind of shorthand for Jews\\". Corbyn's membership of Facebook groups In March 2018, it was reported that, in 2014, Corbyn and some of his staff had been members of three private Facebook groups, including \\"Palestine Live\\" and \\"History of Palestine\\", containing antisemitic posts. A spokesman said that Corbyn had been added to the first two groups by others, had little involvement in them, and had either left them already or left following the reports. The Labour Party stated that a full investigation would be undertaken and action taken against any member involved. =Facebook groups= At the beginning of April 2018, The Sunday Times reported that it had uncovered over 2,000 examples of antisemitic, racist, violent threats and abusive posts in Corbyn-supporting private Facebook groups, including frequent attacks on Jews and Holocaust denying material. The 20 largest pro-Corbyn private Facebook groups, which have a combined membership of over 400,000, were reported to have as members 12 senior staff who work for Corbyn and shadow chancellor John McDonnell. Many of the posts criticised Labour MP Luciana Berger and Jonathan Arkush, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews. A Labour Party spokesperson said the groups \\"are not officially connected to the party in any way\\". Labour MPs urged Corbyn to instruct his supporters to shut down groups containing abusive posts. Subsequently, Corbyn deleted his own personal Facebook account that he had set up before becoming Labour leader, although his official page remained. =Christine Shawcroft resignation= In March 2018, Christine Shawcroft, the recently appointed head of the Party's disputes panel, resigned after it emerged she had opposed the suspension of Peterborough council candidate Alan Bull, for what she called \\"a Facebook post taken completely out of context and alleged to show anti-Semitism\\". She later said that she had not seen the \\"abhorrent\\" Facebook post in question. Bull, in 2015, had shared in a closed Facebook group an article suggesting that the Holocaust was a hoax to \\"invite discussion and debate\\". Bull later said \\"I'm not an anti-Semite, I am not a holocaust denier ‚Äì I support equal rights for Palestinian people\\". =Relationship with the Jewish community= In March 2018, the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Jewish Leadership Council issued an open letter stating that Corbyn was \\"repeatedly found alongside people with blatantly anti-Semitic views\\", concluding that Corbyn \\"cannot seriously contemplate anti-Semitism, because he is so ideologically fixed within a far- left worldview that is instinctively hostile to mainstream Jewish communities\\". Following the open letter's publication accusing Corbyn of siding with antisemites \\"again and again\\", hundreds of people outside Parliament Square gathered to protest 'Enough is Enough' against antisemitism in the Labour Party, demanding that Corbyn do more to tackle anti-Jewish feeling in Labour Party ranks. Jewish Voice for Labour organised a smaller counter-demonstration. A Jewish Voice for Labour spokesman said after the event: \\"There is a massive difference between saying that more needs to be done within the party and a demonstration like this which is implicitly trying to force him [Corbyn] out ... This protest is unnecessary, inflammatory and politicised.\\" The organisation said in a statement that it was \\"appalled\\" by the Board of Deputies' letter. \\"They do not represent us or the great majority of Jews in the party who share Jeremy Corbyn's vision for social justice and fairness. Jeremy's consistent commitment to anti-racism is all the more needed now.\\" Jewish Voice for Labour's Chair Jenny Manson defended Corbyn on Daily Politics, saying he had taken \\"enormously strong action\\" to deal with the issue in his party. In April 2018, Corbyn attended a \\"third night\\" Passover Seder celebration held in his constituency by the radical Jewish group Jewdas. Corbyn was criticised for attending the event by the Jewish Leadership Council, while the Board of Deputies of British Jews said: \\"If Jeremy Corbyn goes to their event, how can we take his stated commitment to be an ally against anti-Semitism seriously?\\" Charlotte Nichols, Young Labour's women's officer and a member of Jewdas, commended Corbyn for attending the event, arguing that it was \\"absolutely right\\" for Corbyn to \\"engage with the community at all levels\\" and that many of the event attendees \\"are absolutely part of the 'mainstream community'\\". In April 2018, following a meeting with Corbyn to discuss antisemitism in the Labour Party, the Jewish Leadership Council and the Board of Deputies said \\"We are disappointed that Mr Corbyn's proposals fell short of the minimum level of action which our letter suggested. In particular, they did not agree in the meeting with our proposals that there should be a fixed timetable to deal with antisemitism cases; that they should expedite the long-standing cases involving Ken Livingstone and Jackie Walker; that no MP should share a platform with somebody expelled or suspended for antisemitism; that they adopt the full International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism with all its examples and clauses; that there should be transparent oversight of their disciplinary process\\". Corbyn described the meeting as \\"positive and constructive\\" and re- iterated that he was \\"absolutely committed\\" to rooting out antisemitism in the Labour Party. In April 2018, the Israeli Labor Party, the sister party of the Jewish Labour Movement, led by Avi Gabbay announced it would cut ties with Corbyn and his office due to their handling of antisemitism, but still retain ties with the UK Labour Party as a whole. In a letter to Corbyn, Gabbay wrote of \\"my responsibility to acknowledge the hostility that you have shown to the Jewish community and the antisemitic statements and actions you have allowed\\".Antisemitism: Israeli Labor leader cuts ties with Jeremy Corbyn , 10 April 2018 In September 2018, Femke van Zijst, spokesperson of the Labour Party of the Netherlands, declared that her party found \\"recent reports worrisome\\" about Corbyn and the growth of anti-semitism in the Labour Party of the United Kingdom. In November 2018, Marie van der Zyl, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said \\"Over the summer, we showed how we could keep this issue of antisemitism on the front pages day after day, week after week, exacting a severe political and reputational cost for continued failure.\\" =Working definition of antisemitism= Criticism In December 2016, Labour adopted the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) Working Definition of Antisemitism. In May 2017, Stephen Sedley said: \\"Anti-Semitism, where it manifests itself in discriminatory acts or inflammatory speech, is generally illegal. Criticism of Israel or of Zionism is protected by law. The IHRA working definition conflates the two by characterising everything other than anodyne criticism of Israel as anti- Semitic\\". Labour formally adopted the definition at its September 2017 Conference. Jewish Voice for Labour's Jonathan Rosenhead described it as intentionally \\"vague\\", allowing for \\"the protection of Israel\\" via \\"a side door\\" and thus \\"encouraging the presumption that criticism of Israel is likely to be antisemitic\\". The organisation saw the change as an \\"anti-democratic restriction on political debate\\", and offered their own definition. In July 2018, 39Chernick, Ilanit (18 July 2018). \\"39 Jewish left-wing groups pen letter supporting BDS\\" The Jerusalem Post. left-wing Jewish organisations in 15 countries, including six in the UK, declared that the definition was \\"worded in such a way as to be easily adopted or considered by western governments to intentionally equate legitimate criticisms of Israel and advocacy for Palestinian rights with antisemitism, as a means to suppress the former\\" and that \\"this conflation undermines both the Palestinian struggle for freedom, justice and equality and the global struggle against antisemitism. It also serves to shield Israel from being held accountable to universal standards of human rights and international law\\". Writer and scholar of antisemitism Antony Lerman said \\"Jewish leaders claim exclusive rights to determine what is antisemitism, potentially putting Jewish sentiment above the law of the land. The fundamental principle that IHRA is so flawed it should be abandoned, not tinkered with. The answer to hate speech is more speech, not suppression of offensive views\\". Revision In July 2018, Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) adopted a new code of conduct defining antisemitism for disciplinary purposes, intended to make the process more efficient and transparent. It included the IHRA definition, but amended or omitted four of the eleven examples, all relating to Israel, and added three others. \\"Accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the interests of their own nations\\", is described as wrong, rather than antisemitic. \\"Comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis\\" is only to be regarded as antisemitic if there is evidence of antisemitic intent. The omitted examples were \\"the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor\\" and \\"Requiring higher standards of behaviour from Israel than other nations\\". Jennie Formby, the general secretary, said the code supplements the definition \\"with additional examples and guidance\\", creating \\"the most thorough and expansive Code of Conduct on anti-Semitism introduced by any political party in the UK\\". NEC member Jon Lansman said \\"Clear and detailed guidelines are essential to ensure that antisemitism isn't tolerated, while protecting free speech on Israel's conduct, within a respectful and civil environment. This is what Labour's code of conduct provides.\\" Response The Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Jewish Leadership Council said that the new rules \\"only dilute the definition and further erode the existing lack of confidence that British Jews have in their sincerity to tackle anti-Semitism within the Labour movement\\".\\"Labour wrong not to use full antisemitism definition in code of conduct, Sir Keir Starmer says\\", Independent, Benjamin Kentish, 8 July 2018 Margaret Hodge MP called Corbyn a \\"fucking anti-Semite and a racist.\\"Labour MP labels Corbyn an 'antisemite' over party's refusal to drop code , Guardian, Heather Stewart and Jessica Elgot, 17 July 2018 Law lecturer Tom Frost said the code ignored the Macpherson Principle that \\"A racist incident is any incident which is perceived to be racist by the victim or any other person.\\" On 16 July, over 60 British rabbis, including Harvey Belovski, Laura Janner- Klausner, Danny Rich and Jonathan Wittenberg said that Labour had \\"chosen to ignore the Jewish community\\", that it was \\"not the Labour party's place to rewrite a definition of antisemitism\\", and that the full definition had been accepted by the Crown Prosecution Service, the Scottish parliament, the Welsh assembly and 124 local authorities. Later in July, in an unprecedented move, three UK Jewish newspapers, The Jewish Chronicle, Jewish News and Jewish Telegraph, carried a joint editorial saying that a Corbyn government would be an \\"existential threat to Jewish life\\" in the UK which, according to David Patrikarakos, was the most drastic step taken by the Anglo-Jewish community since Oliver Cromwell allowed Jews back into the country in the 1650s. The former chief rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks in turn stated that Labour's antisemitism was causing British Jews to consider leaving the country. The newspapers also stated that \\"Had the full IHRA definition with examples relating to Israel been approved, hundreds, if not thousands, of Labour and Momentum members would need to be expelled.\\" A Labour spokesman said the party posed \\"no threat of any kind whatsoever to Jewish people\\". Defence Human rights solicitor Geoffrey Bindman said that \\"The new code of conduct on antisemitism seeks to establish that antisemitism cannot be used as a pretext for censorship without evidence of antisemitic intent in line with the view of the all-party Commons home affairs select committee in October 2016 that the IHRA definition should only be adopted if qualified by caveats making clear that it is not antisemitic to criticise the Israeli government without additional evidence to suggest antisemitic intent‚Ä¶ Far from watering down or weakening it, Labour's code strengthens it by addressing forms of discrimination that the IHRA overlooked.\\" Geoffrey Robertson QC made a similar point. Philosopher and scholar of antisemitism Brian Klug said \\"The IHRA code is a living document, subject to revision and constantly needing to be adapted to the different contexts in which people apply its definition. This is the spirit in which the drafters of Labour's code have approached their task.\\" In Historian Geoffrey Alderman wrote: \\"This Labour Party row will not be settled by relying on a flawed and faulty definition of antisemitism.\\" Outcome and media review In September 2018, all 11 examples were accepted by the NEC, while Jeremy Corbyn said that they would not prevent criticism of the Israeli government or advocating Palestinian rights. Also in September 2018, the Media Reform Coalition examined over 250 articles and broadcast news segments covering the issue, and found over 90 examples of misleading or inaccurate reporting. The research found evidence of \\"overwhelming source imbalance\\", in which Labour's critics dominated coverage which failed to include those defending the code or critiquing the IHRA definition, and omitted contextual facts about the IHRA definition, concluding these were \\"systematic reporting failures\\" disadvantaging the Labour leadership. =Corbyn's responses= In March 2018, in response to claims that he may be seen as antisemitic, Corbyn stated, \\"I'm not an anti-Semite in any form\\" and that he challenges \\"anti- Semitism whenever it arises and no anti-Semitic remarks are done in my name or would ever be done in my name\\". In the same month, Corbyn also said that he would not tolerate antisemitism \\"in and around\\" Labour. \\"We must stamp this out from our party and movement\\", he said. \\"We recognise that anti-Semitism has occurred in pockets within the Labour Party, causing pain and hurt to our Jewish community in the Labour Party and the rest of the country. I am sincerely sorry for the pain which has been caused, and pledge to redouble my efforts to bring this anxiety to an end\\". The following month, writing in the Evening Standard, Corbyn said, \\"We have not done enough fully to get to grips with the problem, and for that the Jewish community and our own Jewish members deserve an apology. My party and I are sorry for the hurt and distress caused\\".J. Murphy, 'Jeremy Corbyn apologises for anti-Semitism in Labour and admits its a 'clear' problem party has failed to tackle' (24/04/18) in Evening Standard In August 2018, he said that antisemitism was a \\"problem that Labour is working to overcome\\". He said that some criticism of Israel may stray into antisemitism at times, but denied that all forms of anti-Zionism were inherently racist, and pledged to \\"root out antisemitism\\" within the party, saying: \\"People who dish out anti-Semitic poison need to understand: You do not do it in my name. You are not my supporters and have no place in our movement.\\" In a video release a few days later, Corbyn apologised again, saying, \\"I acknowledge there is a real problem of antisemitism that Labour is working to overcome. I am sorry for the hurt that has been caused to many Jewish people\\".A. Morales, 'Corbyn Says Sorry for Labour's \`Real' Antisemitism Problem' (05/08/18) on Bloomberg News In the same month, Corbyn said that the notion that he or Labour posed an \\"existential threat\\" to British Jews was \\"overheated rhetoric\\", but agreed that factions of the Labour Party had issues with antisemitism and that there was work to be done for Labour to regain the trust of British Jews.Anti-Semitism is so bad in Britain that some Jews are planning to leave, CNN, 17 August 2018Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party's anti-Semitism 'problem' becomes a crisis, The Washington Post, 10 August 2018 In September 2018, at the Labour Party Conference, Corbyn said he wants Labour and the Jewish community to \\"work together and draw a line\\" under antisemitism. He went on to attack the record of the Conservative Party for accusing Labour of \\"anti-Semitism one day, then endorse Viktor Orb√°n's hard- right government the next day\\". In February 2019, Corbyn reiterated, \\"As leader ... I wish to set out my own commitment along with that of the wider shadow cabinet as the leaders of the Labour Party in parliament to root out antisemitism. I am determined we will defeat racism wherever we see it and I know that antisemitism is one of the oldest, nastiest and most persistent forms of racism.\\" A week later, he said in Parliament, \\"(Antisemitism has) no place whatsoever in any of our political parties, in our lives, in our society\\". In July 2019, Corbyn said \\"While other political parties and some of the media exaggerate and distort the scale of the problem in our party, we must face up to the unsettling truth that a small number of Labour members hold anti-Semitic views and a larger number don't recognise anti-Semitic stereotypes and conspiracy theories. The evidence is clear enough. The worst cases of anti-Semitism in our party have included Holocaust denial, crude Jewish-banker stereotypes, conspiracy theories blaming Israel for 9/11 or every war on the Rothschild family, and even one member who appeared to believe that Hitler had been misunderstood. I am sorry for the hurt that has been caused to many Jewish people. We have been too slow in processing disciplinary cases of mostly online anti-Semitic abuse by party members. We are acting to speed this process up. People who hold anti-Semitic views have no place in the Labour Party. They may be few ‚Äì the number of cases over the past three years represents less than 0.1% of Labour's membership of more than half a million ‚Äì but one is too many.\\" In October 2019, a Labour spokesperson said \\"Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party are fully committed to the support, defence and celebration of the Jewish community and continue to take robust action to root out antisemitism in the party and wider society.\\" During the 2019 general election, Corbyn apologised on ITV's This Morning programme.C. Chaplain, 'Jeremy Corbyn says he is 'very sorry for all that's happened' with Labour anti-Semitism in This Morning interview (03/12/19) on inews.co.uk A few days before, other members of the shadow cabinet, including Nia Griffith, Richard Burgon and John McDonnell, apologised for antisemitism in their party.F. Perraudin, 'Corbyn says Labour has offered apologies to antisemitism victims (27/11/19) on The Guardian In June 2020, Corbyn said claims he tolerated antisemitism among his supporters were \\"wrong and extremely unfair\\" and that he had taken steps to create a \\"robust process\\" to deal with the claims, describing antisemitism as \\"absolutely, totally unacceptable in any form\\". 2019 =Training and education= In 2018, the Jewish Labour Movement was invited to provide antisemitism awareness training to those subject to disciplinary proceedings but declined as they did not believe training was an appropriate sanction. In July 2018, Jewish Voice for Labour asked its members for help in delivering an \\"expanded programme\\" of antisemitism training to party members in response to what it called a \\"growing number of requests\\". In March 2019, the Labour Party, referencing the volunteer-led nature of existing antisemitism training, announced that a short course in antisemitism would be developed by the Pears Institute for the Study of Antisemitism and that Jewish communal organisations would be consulted. The intention would be to enrol staff, NCC and NEC members on the course. The Jewish Labour Movement, which had provided volunteer-led training for the past three years, then withdrew its training provision for branches. In June 2019, Labour peer Peter Hain and former Israeli negotiator in peace talks Daniel Levy argued that \\"actually the problem is political, and therefore requires a political not simply a procedural solution\\". In July 2019, Labour MP Clive Lewis in an article in The Independent wrote that: \\"Expulsions alone will not solve Labour's antisemitism crisis. Political education about antisemitism can help to ensure a socialist politics based on real equality becomes the common sense across the party.\\" In July 2019, Labour appointed Heather Mendick as a liaison officer to improve the party's relationships with the Jewish community. Jewish Leadership Council Chair Jonathan Goldstein expressed objections to the appointment and said that the JLC will not be engaging with Mendick. Later in July 2019, Labour issued an online leaflet entitled \\"No Place For Antisemitism\\" alongside related documents and videos, as the launch of a programme of educating members on oppression and social liberation, and to help them confront racism and bigotry. This was promoted to all party members by an email from Jeremy Corbyn. =Disciplinary processes, outcomes and staff claims= Disciplinary processes In April 2018, the new Labour General Secretary, Jennie Formby, announced that a team of lawyers had been seconded to handle disciplinary cases and that a new post of in-house general counsel had been advertised \\"to advise on disciplinary matters and improvements to our processes\\". In September 2018, the NEC approved a doubling of the size of the party's key disciplinary body, the National Constitutional Committee, in order to speed up the handling of antisemitism claims. In February 2019, Formby noted that the Governance and Legal Unit had suffered during 2018 from a high level of staff sickness and departures, which was addressed in part by secondments. She also said that the unit was now back to full strength and that the size of the unit will be more than doubled. Later in the month, Lord Falconer accepted an invitation to examine Labour's processes in order to increase transparency though this did not take place due to the announcement of the Equality and Human Rights Commission's investigation. Formby asked that a request by Deputy Leader of the Labour Party Tom Watson to Labour parliamentarians, asking that complaints about antisemitism be copied to him for monitoring, be disregarded on the grounds that this would disrupt the official process and be in breach of data protection law. In May 2019, Labour National Executive Committee member Jon Lansman wrote that leaked emails \\"...suggest that former compliance unit officials from the Labour right may have delayed action on some of the most extreme and high-profile antisemitism cases, including Holocaust denial, allowing a backlog of cases to build up that would damage the party and Jeremy's leadership.\\" He also accused former General Secretary Iain McNicol and his team of delaying action on handling antisemitism cases, and allowing a backlog of cases to build up that would damage the party and Jeremy Corbyn's leadership. In July 2019, a Labour spokesperson said that the rate at which antisemitism cases have been dealt with had increased fourfold after Formby took up her position in May 2018. In August 2019, Jewish Voice for Labour said that Labour's processes had greatly improved since April 2018. Later in the month, the NEC agreed to speed up determination of the most serious cases by giving a special panel comprising the General Secretary and NEC officers the authority to consider these cases and expel members where appropriate, rather than requiring the cases to be referred to the quasi-judicial National Constitutional Committee. The rule change will be submitted for approval to the Labour Party Conference in September. In June 2020, following the election as leader of Keir Starmer, it was reported that \\"a trusted ally of the Labour leader\\" had been appointed as a \\"management enforcer\\" to oversee the management of allegations of antisemitism. According to a party source, \\"For anyone seeking to stay in their jobs it would not be sensible to disobey the new manager's requests. The manager has also been given the power to step in and make decisions himself about cases.\\" Disciplinary outcomes In February 2019, Formby announced to Labour MPs that, of the complaints about antisemitism received by the party from April 2018 to January 2019, 400 related to individuals who were not party members. In a further 220 cases, Labour had found that there was insufficient evidence of a breach of party rules. Some of the remaining 453 complaints, i.e. those where there was sufficient evidence of a breach of party rules, related to social media posts dating back a number of years. These 453 complaints received over the ten month period represented 0.06% of Labour's 540,000 membership. Investigations had resulted in 12 expulsions and 49 resignations from the party and 187 formal warnings, while some complaints received recently were still under investigation. Some Labour MPs questioned the accuracy of the data. In July 2019, Formby provided updated disciplinary figures regarding complaints of antisemitism and committed to regularly publishing statistics. During the first six months of 2019, 625 complaints about members had been received, some members being the subject of multiple complaints, and 116 members suspended. A further 658 complaints were received about people who were not members. Of the complaints received relating to members, Labour decided that 100 lacked sufficient evidence and 163 showed no rule breaches, 90 received formal warnings or reminders of conduct and 97 had been referred to the National Constitutional Committee, which has the power to expel members. 146 cases were still being processed. National Executive Committee Antisemitism Panels had met six times and made 190 decisions, compared with two and eight in the same period the previous year. The National Constitutional Committee had concluded 28 cases and made eight expulsions with another twelve members resigning, compared with ten, seven and three in the same period the previous year. In January 2020, the Labour Party reported that 149 members resigned or were expelled during 2019 as a result of disciplinary processes relating to antisemitism. Of these, 45 members were expelled, compared to ten in 2018 and one in 2017. NEC disciplinary panels heard 274 cases, compared with 28 cases in 2017. 296 members were suspended, compared to 98 in 2018, itself a big increase on the previous year. After the September 2019 annual conference gave NEC panels the power to expel, twice the number of people were expelled in two months than had been expelled during the whole of 2018. Claims by former staff In April 2019, the Party's lawyers wrote to its former head of disputes asking what information he had shared with the media and for his commitment not to commit further breaches of his non-disclosure agreement. In July, an edition of the BBC programme Panorama entitled \\"Is Labour Anti- Semitic?\\" produced by John Ware, included a claim by former staff that, in the first half of 2018, senior Labour figures had interfered in the complaints process while new senior officials in their department downgraded outcomes for antisemitic behaviour.BBC1 website. Retrieved 19 July 2019. Labour denied that there was interference and said the former staff included those who had \\"personal and political axes to grind\\". The Party added \\"The Panorama programme was not a fair or balanced investigation. It was a seriously inaccurate, politically one-sided polemic, which breached basic journalistic standards, invented quotes and edited emails to change their meaning.\\" The BBC responded that \\"the investigation was not pre-determined, it was driven by the evidence\\". Labour later submitted a formal complaint about the programme to the BBC, one of around 1,600 received. Staff members represented by the GMB trade union voted overwhelmingly to call on the Party to be consistent in supporting whistle-blowers wherever they worked and to apologise to their former colleagues.\\"Labour staff members vote overwhelmingly to condemn party's response to Panorama documentary on antisemitism\\", The Independent, 18 July 2019. Retrieved 19 July 2019. =Resignations of MPs and peers= In August 2018, Labour MP Frank Field resigned the Labour whip over a \\"culture...of nastiness\\". He retained his party membership, announcing that he would sit as an \\"independent Labour MP\\". It was suggested by Owen Jones that the resignation had little to do with antisemitism, whilst Andrew Grice (a columnist for The Independent) and others have suggested that Field left before he was deselected by his local party, as he had lost a vote of confidence in his constituency over his support for Theresa May's Brexit plans in a recent parliamentary vote. In February 2019, seven MPs quit Labour to form The Independent Group (latterly Change UK), citing their dissatisfaction with the party's leftward political direction, its approach to Brexit and to allegations of antisemitism. They were later joined by four more MPs, including three from the Conservative Party. Another MP resigned from Labour to sit as an independent. One of the original seven, Luciana Berger, said that Labour had become \\"sickeningly institutionally racist\\". Two days later, Corbyn said in Parliament, in response, \\"(Antisemitism has) no place whatsoever in any of our political parties, in our lives, in our society\\". Four of the MPs had recently lost votes of no-confidence brought by their constituency parties, while two such motions against Berger had recently been withdrawn. Following its failure to secure any seats in May 2019 European Parliament election, six of its MPs resigned to sit as independents. In July 2019, three members of the House of Lords, David Triesman, Leslie Arnold Turnberg and Ara Darzi resigned the Labour whip to sit as independents, citing dissatisfaction with the party's handling of antisemitism, Brexit and defence policy. In October 2019, Louise Ellman MP resigned from the party, citing her worries about antisemitism in the party and opposition to the prospect of a government led by Corbyn. Labour responded that \\"Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party are fully committed to the support, defence and celebration of the Jewish community and continue to take robust action to root out antisemitism in the party and wider society.\\" Motions of no confidence in Ellman had recently been submitted for discussion in three branches of her constituency Labour Party. Riverside constituency Labour party said: \\"[S]he made it very clear at the last CLP meeting that she could not support a Jeremy Corbyn-led government. This inevitably meant that Louise would be triggered and was very unlikely to win any reselection process.\\" =External investigations= In November 2018, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick announced that they had been passed an internal Labour dossier detailing 45 allegations of antisemitic hate crimes committed by Labour Party members and would review them with a view to investigation. In May 2019, following complaints submitted by the Jewish Labour Movement and the Campaign Against Antisemitism, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) launched a formal investigation into whether Labour had \\"unlawfully discriminated against, harassed or victimised people because they are Jewish\\": specifically, whether \\"unlawful acts have been committed by the party and/or its employees and/or its agents, and; whether the party has responded to complaints of unlawful acts in a lawful, efficient and effective manner.\\" In 2016, Labour MP Harriet Harman had expressed concern about the suitability of its chair, David Isaac, given his principal role as an equity partner at a City law firm that advises the Conservative government, Pinsent Masons. Previously, in September 2017, the EHRC Chief Executive, Rebecca Hilsenrath, had demanded a zero tolerance approach to antisemitism in the Labour Party and swift action by the leadership to deal with it. Antony Lerman, former founding director of the Institute for Jewish Policy Research, raised concerns that such a statement made Hilsenrath unsuitable to lead a probe into Labour. He wrote in openDemocracy: \\"Prior to investigation, is it not worrying that the CEO already claims to know what the Labour Party needs to do?\\" Hilsenrath later recused herself from the decision to investigate the Labour Party as her status as \\"an active member of the Anglo-Jewish community\\" could cause a perception of bias. The Labour Party asked the EHRC to communicate any interim recommendations in the course of the investigation. The Shadow Chancellor, John McDonnell, looked forward to the investigation's conclusions stating: \\"I want it quicker actually, I need it speeded up. Let's learn the lessons and then also work with the organisation to implement what recommendations they bring forward. On that basis I'm hoping we'll get a clean bill of health but more importantly we can become much more effective at tackling not just antisemitism but racism, both in our party and society overall.\\" Jewish Voice for Labour welcomed the investigation by the EHRC. The organisation produced a dossier for the EHRC in response to its request for evidence in relation to its investigation. JVL holds that without making public the complaints and Labour's response when the EHRC shared them ahead of launching the investigation, the EHRC have violated the Equality Act 2006 which requires that they specify who is being investigated and \\"the nature of the unlawful act\\" they are suspected of committing, both required by its own terms of reference. Signatories to JVL's letter includes human rights lawyer Sir Geoffrey Bindman QC and University of Oxford professor Avi Shlaim. In June 2020, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Conservatives in power had \\"for some reason, which I don't fully understand... decided to take away its independent status and make it part of the government machine\\". =Criticism of Labour Party advocates= In 2019, those seeking to defend the Labour Party and some members from what they saw as unfair or exaggerated allegations themselves came under attack. Chris Williamson MP was suspended and investigated after he was recorded saying that \\"The party that has done more to stand up to racism is now being demonised as a racist, bigoted party. I have got to say I think our party's response has been partly responsible for that because in my opinion‚Ä¶ we have backed off too much, we have given too much ground, we have been too apologetic...We've done more to address the scourge of antisemitism than any other political party. And yet we are being traduced\\". As with Jackie Walker and Labour Against the Witchhunt, efforts were made to prevent him speaking at events. Before the 2019 general election, the Labour Party banned Williamson from standing as a Labour candidate. Pro-Corbyn websites, such as The Canary, were the target of an advertising boycott campaign by Stop Funding Fake News, which said that The Canary regularly published \\"fake news\\" and attempts to \\"justify antisemitism\\" and that two of its writers had made antisemitic comments. According to Jewish News, the campaign has been backed by Rachel Riley, who campaigns against the party leadership's handling of allegations of antisemitism, while The Canary has called the accusations a smear and those behind the campaign \\"political Zionists\\". Research by the Community Security Trust identified a number of pro-Jeremy Corbyn and pro- Labour social media accounts that claimed that allegations of antisemitism in the party were \\"exaggerated, weaponised, invented or blown out of proportion, or that Labour and Corbyn are victims of a smear campaign relating to antisemitism\\". A report by independent researcher David Collier on the social media activity of 14 Labour Party members showed a pattern of greatly increased references to Israel, antisemitism and British Jewry following Corbyn's election as leader. This has been ascribed to a response to the critical media coverage of allegations of antisemitism in the Labour Party. =Response to attack on rabbi= After an Israeli rabbi was attacked whilst visiting London in November 2019, Corbyn phoned Rabbi Herschel Gluck, chairperson of Jewish neighbourhood watch organisation Shomrim, to express his concern for and empathy with the community. He tweeted that \\"We must stop this scourge of antisemitism\\". Gluck commented that the community appreciated Corbyn's concern and that Corbyn was the only party leader who called. 2020 =Keir Starmer's statements= On 4 April 2020, newly-elected party leader Keir Starmer expressed the view that \\"Antisemitism has been a stain on our party\\" and apologised to the Jewish community on behalf of the Labour Party, vowing to fight it. Starmer had previously made eliminating antisemitism in the Labour Party one of his main campaign issues, and said he would take steps to eradicate it \\"on day one\\" of his assuming party leadership. He also said he would look to fully cooperate with the EHRC's investigation into antisemitism in the party. =Internal investigation into Labour's Governance and Legal Unit= The following week, Sky News reported that an 860-page report into the handling of antisemitism by the party, planned to be sent to the EHRC in addition to previous submissions, would be withheld on the advice of lawyers. The report was the result of an internal investigation into Labour's Governance and Legal Unit, which handles disciplinary cases. The report concluded that there was \\"no evidence\\" that antisemitism complaints were treated any differently than other forms of complaint, or of current or former staff being \\"motivated by antisemitic intent\\". The report also found that Corbyn's team inherited a lack of \\"robust processes, systems, training, education and effective line management\\" and that hostility towards Corbyn by former senior officials contributed to \\"a litany of mistakes\\" which \\"affected the expeditious and resolute handling of disciplinary complaints\\", including providing \\"false and misleading information\\" to Corbyn's office on the scale and handling of antisemitism allegations. The report urges the EHRC to \\"question the validity of the personal testimonies\\" of former members of staff. Furthermore, The Independent, which saw the dossier in full, stated that the report said that staffers associated with the right-wing of the Labour Party sought to undermine Corbyn and prevent Labour from winning the 2017 general election in the hope that a poor result would trigger a leadership contest to remove Corbyn as leader. Former Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell called for the immediate suspension of some former staff named in the document, pending the results of the independent investigation, and the document should be provided to the EHRC investigation into the party. He said: \\"They've got to have access to all of the information. We've got to rid ourselves of this culture that prevented a Labour government when we desperately needed one but also, by the looks of it, undermined the party's ability to deal with antisemitism effectively\\" and wrote that \\"the revelations in the leaked Labour report are a genuine scandal\\". On 23 April, Labour's NEC met and to agreed the terms of reference for the independent investigation into the circumstances, contents and release of an internal report to conclude with its own report being published by mid-July. Several amendments were passed by the NEC, including one moved by Rayner that referred to the offer of whistleblower protections. On 1 May, the NEC appointed a four-person panel to investigate the report on the party's handling of internal antisemitism complaints. Martin Forde QC, a barrister was chosen by the NEC to chair the independent inquiry. He will be supported by three Labour peers: Baroness Debbie Wilcox, Lord Larry Whitty and Baroness Ruth Lister. In June 2020, Jeremy Corbyn said: \\"I always knew that there was a culture in the Labour party that was not a healthy one, of an almost self-perpetuating bureaucracy. All organisations have a degree of self- perpetuating bureaucracy about them.\\" In June 2020, the Labour Party revealed during a High Court hearing, that it had suspended the membership of some party members in order to protect the integrity of its investigation into the leaked anti-semitism report. According to Novara Media, former party director Emilie Oldknow, who featured prominently in the leaked documents, and Patrick Heneghan, Labour's former executive director for elections, campaigns and organisation were among the members who were suspended. In June, Labour's press office provided a statement prepared by party lawyers to journalists covering the story that defended the comments, describing criticism as \\"po- faced\\" and stating: \\"These were messages exchanged between co-workers in the expectation that they would remain private and confidential and the tone of the language used reflects that.\\" In response, 13 NEC members (one third of the NEC), including representatives from four trade union from Transport Salaried Staffs' Association, Fire Brigades Union, Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen and Unite the Union wrote to Labour leader Keir Starmer accusing his office of misleading them about how the party dealt with leaked WhatsApp messages by senior officials detailed in the report and accusing party officials of defending \\"racist, sexist and abusive\\" messages about colleagues, and \\"also directly prejudged the specific issues that Martin Forde's inquiry is considering... and thereby undermines its independence\\". The NEC members called for an apology and retraction from Starmer. =Sacking of Rebecca Long-Bailey= In June 2020, Rebecca Long-Bailey was asked to resign as Shadow Secretary of State for Education by Labour leader Keir Starmer after she shared a link to an Independent interview with the actor Maxine Peake which contained the following words: > \\"The tactics used by the police in America, kneeling on George Floyd's neck, > that was learnt from seminars with Israeli secret services.\\"'People who > couldn't vote Labour because of Corbyn? They voted Tory as far as I'm > concerned', Independent, 25 June 2020. Text of the original interview is > available here via Pressreader.com. The original article stated that \\"the Israeli police has denied this\\".Text of the original Independent interview is available here via Pressreader.com. Starmer said that the article should not have been shared by Long-Bailey\\" as it contained anti-Semitic conspiracy theories\\". The Independent amended the original article to add a note that \\"the allegation that US police were taught tactics of 'neck kneeling' by Israeli secret services is unfounded\\". Peake later stated that she was \\"inaccurate in [her] assumption of American police training and its sources\\". The claim had been linked to a report by Amnesty International, but Amnesty said that they had never reported that Israeli security forces had taught the technique. The Guardian said a \\"series of individual MPs condemned the decision\\" and some did not consider Peake's allegations to be anti-semitic. John McDonnell, shadow chancellor under Jeremy Corbyn, said that \\"criticism of practices of [the] Israeli state is not anti- semitic\\". He did not believe that Long-Bailey should have been sacked and stood \\"in solidarity\\" with her. NEC member Jon Lansman said: \\"I don't believe there is anything antisemitic in the [Maxine Peake] interview and sacking Rebecca is a reckless overreaction by Keir Starmer.\\" =Steve Reed= In July 2020, Steve Reed used twitter to suggest that Conservative Party donor Richard Desmond was \\"the puppet master to the entire Tory cabinet\\" in relation to the planning scandal involving Desmond and minister Robert Jenrick. The tweet was criticised as antisemitic for containing a \\"classic anti-Semitic trope about a Jewish businessman\\" and Conservative MPs asked Starmer to sack Reed. After Reed deleted the tweet and apologised, no further action was taken against him. =Aftermath of 2019 Panorama programme= In July 2020 the Labour Party was sued for defamation by seven former members of staff who had appeared in the 2019 BBC Panorama programme Is Labour Anti-Semitic? The former staffers said senior Labour Party figures had made statements attacking their reputations and suggesting they had ulterior political and personal motives to undermine the party by appearing in the programme. When the programme was aired, a Labour party spokesperson had called them \\"disaffected former officials\\" and said they had \\"worked actively to undermine\\" Corbyn and had \\"both personal and political axes to grind\\". In response to the lawsuit Starmer agreed to pay damages to the former staff members and issue a formal apology. Corbyn expressed disappointment at Starmer's decision and said that the Labour Party was risking \\"giving credibility to misleading and inaccurate allegations about action taken to tackle anti-Semitism in the Labour Party in recent years\\" and that the settlements were a \\"political decision, not a legal one\\". In response, the show's presenter John Ware decided to sue Corbyn personally.https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/labour-whistleblower- apology-jeremy-corbyn-political-decision-a4505646.html A fundraising campaign, set up with an initial target of ¬£20,000 to help Corbyn with legal fees related to Ware's action, surpassed ¬£270,000 within a few days. Starmer's decision also prompted the Labour Party's largest backer, the trade union Unite lead by Len McCluskey, to review its donations to the party. McCluskey said \\"It's an abuse of members' money. ‚Ä¶ It's as though a huge sign has been put up outside the Labour party with 'queue here with your writ and get your payment over there' \\". Rebuttals = Labour movement = In September 2017, general secretary of Unite the Union, Len McCluskey said that the row \\"was created by people who were trying to undermine Jeremy Corbyn\\". He stated that he had never heard antisemitic language at a party meeting, adding \\"Unfortunately at the time there were lots of people playing games, everybody wanted to create this image that Jeremy Corbyn's leadership had become misogynist, had become racist, had become anti-Semitic and it was wrong.\\" In October 2017, Labour Against the Witchhunt was formed to oppose what they saw as unjustified disciplinary action against Labour activists in relation to alleged antisemitism. In December 2017, Momentum founder Jon Lansman categorised antisemitism in the Labour Party into three forms: petty xenophobic remarks, of which he \\"[doesn't] think there's much\\" in the Party; old-school blood libel type antisemitism, which, according to Lansman, is \\"extremely rare\\"; and the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict, whereby, Lansman says, \\"we all understand that when that conflict heats up, it results in dreadful antisemitism. It shouldn't result in that, but it does\\". In May 2019, Labour National Executive Committee member Peter Willsman asserted that the Israeli embassy were \\"behind all this antisemitism\\" and were \\"the ones whipping it all up\\". He added: \\"They caught somebody in the Labour Party. It turns out they were an agent in the Israeli Embassy\\", referring to The Lobby. In June 2019, Labour peer Peter Hain and former Israeli negotiator in peace talks Daniel Levy claimed that the effect of Labour's stance on antisemitism has been \\"to empower apologists for totally unacceptable Israeli government attacks on Palestinians and the steady throttling of their rights ‚Äì allowing those apologists to scale new heights in their dishonest attempts to label criticism of such Israeli policy as 'antisemitic'\\". In July 2019, the Labour Party in Northern Ireland (LPNI) released a statement opposing the second suspension of Chris Williamson on the grounds that it was \\"arbitrary and unreasonable\\" and stated that the \\"allegations of 'rampant anti-semitism in the Labour Party' have led to detailed research and a number of investigations being conducted to ascertain the truthfulness of the claims. Some of the research has been conducted by world renowned Jewish organisations, with no affiliation, support for, or loyalty to the UK Labour Party. Despite their clear objective and independent credentials; their findings have been almost universally ignored by the UK media.\\" It then went on \\"it is a fair comment to say that the Labour Party does not have any form of particular problem with anti-semitism. It is also fair to say that Labour Party Members are not to blame for the narrative that suggests that there is a particular problem with anti-semitism in the party. It logically follows that members of the Labour Party should not feel that they should be apologetic about something that has been shown to be false.\\" In August 2019, former Deputy Leader of the Labour Party and Shadow Home Secretary Lord Hattersley said that he believed that Labour had \\"managed to expunge the party\\" of antisemitism. = Jewish activists and organisations = Some left-wing Jewish groups have disputed the antisemitism claims. These include Jewish Voice for Labour, Jews for Justice for Palestinians, Jewish Socialists' Group, Jewdas and Independent Jewish Voices; all of whom have said that accusations of antisemitism against the Labour Party have a twofold purpose: firstly, to conflate antisemitism with criticism of Israel in order to deter such criticism and, secondly, to undermine the Labour leadership since Corbyn was elected leader in 2015. In August 2015, dozens of prominent Jewish activists signed an open letter criticising The Jewish Chronicle for what they viewed as its \\"character assassination\\" of Corbyn. They wrote: \\"Your assertion that your attack on Jeremy Corbyn is supported by 'the vast majority of British Jews' is without foundation. We do not accept that you speak on behalf of progressive Jews in this country. You speak only for Jews who support Israel, right or wrong.\\" They continued, \\"There is something deeply unpleasant and dishonest about your McCarthyite guilt by association technique. Jeremy Corbyn's parliamentary record over 32 years has consistently opposed all racism including antisemitism.\\" Signatories to the letter included Laurence Dreyfus, Selma James, Miriam Margolyes, Ilan Papp√©, Michael Rosen and Avi Shlaim. In April 2016, Richard Kuper, spokesperson for Jews for Justice for Palestinians, said that, while \\"there is some antisemitism in and around the Labour party ‚Äì as there is in the wider society in Britain\\", \\"there is clearly also a coordinated, willed and malign campaign to exaggerate the nature and extent of antisemitism as a stick to beat the Labour party\\" under Corbyn. In the same month, Ian Saville, a Jewish Socialists' Group and Labour Party member, said he was \\"disturbed\\" by the way antisemitism had \\"been used to attack the left in the Labour Party.\\" In April 2016, the Jewish Socialists' Group said that antisemitism accusations were being \\"weaponized\\" in order to \\"attack the Jeremy Corbyn-led Labour party with claims that Labour has a \\"problem\\" of antisemitism\\". It added \\"A very small number of such cases seem to be real instances of antisemitism. Others represent genuine criticism of Israeli policy and support for Palestinian rights\\" The statement concluded \\"The Jewish Socialists' Group sees the current fearmongering about antisemitism in the Labour Party for what it is ‚Äì a conscious and concerted effort by right-wing political forces to undermine the growing support among Jews and non-Jews alike for the Labour Party leadership of Jeremy Corbyn, and a measure of the desperation of his opponents\\". Later that month, 82 \\"Jewish members and supporters of the Labour party and of Jeremy Corbyn's leadership\\" wrote an open letter to The Guardian stating that they \\"do not accept that antisemitism is 'rife' in the Labour party\\" and that \\"these accusations are part of a wider campaign against the Labour leadership, and they have been timed particularly to do damage to the Labour party and its prospects in elections in the coming week.\\" The Jewish members and supporters included Miriam David, Ivor Dembina, Professor Stephen Deutsch, Selma James, Miriam Margolyes, Charles Shaar Murray, Ian Saville and Lynne Segal. In December 2017, Jewdas suggested that the allegations are aimed at discrediting the party and called the reaction to them a \\"bout of faux-outrage greased with hypocrisy and opportunism\\", saying it was \\"the work of cynical manipulations by people whose express loyalty is to the Conservative Party and the right wing of the Labour Party\\". In March 2018, Joseph Finlay, the former deputy editor of Jewish Quarterly magazine and co-founder of several grassroots Jewish organisations, wrote in the Jewish News defending Corbyn, describing him as \\"one of the leading anti-racists in parliament\\", and that; \\"Antisemitism is always beyond the pale. Labour, now a party of over half a million members, has a small minority of antisemites in its ranks, and it suspends then whenever it discovers them. I expect nothing less from an anti- racist party and an anti-racist leader.\\" He continued, \\"There are many threats to Jews ‚Äì and we are right to be vigilant. ... The idea that Britain's leading anti-racist politician is the key problem the Jewish community faces is an absurdity, a distraction, and a massive error.\\" In May 2018, the Palestinian- Israeli Socialist Struggle Movement said that they \\"view Corbyn as a strong opponent of antisemitism and see the attacks being made on him for what they are: attempts to discredit a left-wing politician who has put forward a manifesto seen by capitalists as too radical in favour of working class interests ... The smear campaign against Corbyn is a dangerous attempt to sabotage the struggle for left and socialist solutions\\". In February 2019, over 200 Jewish members and supporters of the Labour Party signed a letter published in The Guardian, calling the party under Corbyn an \\"a crucial ally in the fight against bigotry and reaction\\" and Corbyn's campaigning consistently in support for \\"initiatives against antisemitism\\". They also welcomed Labour's support for \\"freedom of expression on Israel and on the rights of Palestinians\\". They felt that the \\"disproportionate focus on antisemitism on the left, which is abhorrent but relatively rare.\\" The Jewish members and supporters included Prof David Epstein, Mike Leigh, Prof Michael Rosen, Prof Avi Shlaim, Gillian Slovo, Prof Annabelle Sreberny, Walter Wolfgang, Peter Buckman, Erica Burman, Keith Burstein, Miriam David, Michael Ellman, Nick Foster, Susan Himmelweit, Selma James, Ann Jungman, Frank Land, Gillian McCall, Helen Pearson and Ian Saville. In July 2019, Andrew Feinstein, anti-corruption campaigner and executive director of Corruption Watch pointed out that \\"Only a very small percentage of Labour members hold anti-semitic views and a YouGov poll in 2015 found Labour displayed the second least amount of any political party, second only to the Liberal Democrats. In 2017, two years into Jeremy Corbyn's leadership, the extent of anti-semitism in Labour had actually dropped, according to polling.\\" In August 2019, Gabor Mat√©, Canadian psychologist and writer, Jewish holocaust survivor and former Zionist, when asked about allegations of antisemitism in the Labour Party said: \\"...The whole antisemitism charge, when it comes to the Palestinian issue, is simply a way to intimidate and silence critics of horrendous Israeli policies.\\" In November 2019, John Bercow, the Jewish former Speaker of the House of Commons and Conservative MP, said he had never experienced antisemitism from a Labour Party member and had known Corbyn for 22 years and did not believe he was antisemitic. In February 2020 Bercow claimed that he had only ever experienced 'subtle' antisemitism from members of his own Conservative Party, and had never experienced any antisemitism from Labour MPs. In November 2019, 14 British Jews signed a letter published in The Guardian stating: \\"As British Jews, most of whom have family in Israel and lost family in the Holocaust, and all of us with plenty of experience taking on antisemites face to face across the political spectrum, we are not prepared to be used as cannon fodder in what is really a political siege of the Labour party.\\" The British Jews included Antony Lerman, Lynne Segal, Jacqueline Rose, Miriam David, Brian Klug, Jonathan Rosenhead, Graeme Segal and Stephen Sedley. = Academics and researchers = In April 2016, independent researcher Jamie Stern-Weiner's review of the cases of antisemitism found that some were represented in the media in a way that treated comments about \\"Zionists\\" as being the same as Holocaust denial and comments about antisemitic conspiracy theories. In May 2016, Israeli historian and Oxford University Professor of International Relations Avi Shlaim argued that \\"charges of Jew-hatred are being deliberately manipulated to serve a pro-Zionist agenda.\\" In the same month, Norman Finkelstein said: \\"The only plausible answer is, it's political. It has nothing whatsoever to do with the factual situation; instead, a few suspect cases of antisemitism ‚Äì some real, some contrived ‚Äì are being exploited for an ulterior political motive. As one senior Labour MP said the other day, it's transparently a smear campaign.\\" In January 2017, John Newsinger, professor of history at Bath Spa University, wrote: \\"There has been a sustained attempt made to discredit the Corbynites by alleging that they are somehow responsible for the Labour Party having a serious problem with anti- Semitism, that the Labour left and the left outside the Labour Party is, in fact, anti-Semitic ... There are two points worth making here: first that the allegations are politically motivated smears, perpetrated by people completely without shame, and second that they do considerable damage to the real fight against anti-Semitism.\\" Also in 2017, linguist and philosopher Noam Chomsky said: \\"I wholeheartedly support the right of anyone to criticise Israel without being branded antisemitic. That goes in particular for Jackie Walker.\\" In April 2018, 42 senior academics wrote to The Guardian condemning anti- Corbyn bias in coverage of the debate and suggested that \\"Dominant sections of the media have framed the story in such a way as to suggest that antisemitism is a problem mostly to do with Labour and that Corbyn is personally responsible for failing to deal with it. The coverage has relied on a handful of sources such as the Board of Deputies, the Jewish Leadership Council and well-known political opponents of Corbyn himself.\\" They continued: \\"It is not 'whataboutery' to suggest that the debate on antisemitism has been framed in such a way as to mystify the real sources of anti-Jewish bigotry and instead to weaponise it against a single political figure just ahead of important elections. We condemn antisemitism wherever it exists. We also condemn journalism that so blatantly lacks context, perspective and a meaningful range of voices in its determination to condemn Jeremy Corbyn.\\" The academics included Lynne Segal, Annabelle Sreberny, Beverley Skeggs, Gary Hall, Neve Gordon, Margaret Gallagher, Maria Chatzichristodoulou, Jill Daniels and Ruth Catlow. One of the academics, Jane Dipple of the University of Winchester, was herself investigated by her university and the Labour party over allegedly antisemitic posts on Facebook. In August 2018 the university said that Dipple no longer worked there but refused to say if she had been sacked or if she had resigned. Later that April, Israeli historian and socialist activist Ilan Papp√© stated that \\"Corbyn is not an anti-Semite and the Labour Party, until his election, was a pro-Israeli bastion...\\" and \\"there is anti-Semitism among all British parties ‚Äì and much more on the right than on the left.\\" He continued: \\"It is not the Labour Party that is infested with anti-Semitism; it is the British media and political systems that are plagued by hypocrisy, paralysed by intimidation and ridden with hidden layers of Islamophobia and new chauvinism in the wake of Brexit.\\" In May 2018, Stephen Sedley, a former Court of Appeal judge, dismissed the charge that the Labour Party is \\"institutionally\\" or \\"culturally\\" antisemitic. He wrote that \\"an undeclared war is going on inside the party, with pro-Israeli groups such as the Jewish Labour Movement seeking to drive out pro-Palestinian groups like the Jewish Voice for Labour by stigmatising them, and Corbyn with them, as anti-Semitic.\\" He believes that outside bodies like the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Jewish Leadership Council ‚Äì \\"neither noted for balanced criticism of Israel\\" ‚Äì weigh in, aided by \\"generous media coverage\\". In July 2018, philosopher and scholar of antisemitism Brian Klug wrote: \\"It's paradoxical if, at the moment Labour wakes up to the necessity of combating antisemitism in its ranks, it is shouted down because of its failure to deal with it in the past.\\" In October, he wrote: \\"It appears that two different objectives are being conflated by Jewish leadership: confronting antisemitism and toppling Corbyn.\\" In August 2018, Lorna Finlayson, a lecturer in political philosophy at the University of Essex stated that \\"No one has yet produced any evidence either that antisemitism is more prevalent in the Labour Party than elsewhere in British society (within the Conservative Party, for instance), or that its incidence within Labour has increased since Corbyn became leader.\\" In September, Professor Rebecca Ruth Gould, a literary theorist, said that \\"Labour must recognise the internal diversity of the Jewish community and not allow a political faction to silence other points of view, as is happening now to an unprecedented degree.\\" In October 2018, Goldsmiths, University of London-owned Media Reform Coalition published a report on the coverage of the revised Labour's code of conduct on antisemitism examining \\"over 250 articles and broadcast news segments.\\" It reportedly found \\"over 90 examples of misleading or inaccurate reporting.\\" In relation to the IHRA definition of antisemitism, the research found evidence of \\"overwhelming source imbalance\\", which over-represented critics of Labour, failed to report on those defending the code or critiquing the IHRA definition and excluded \\"contextual facts about the IHRA definition.\\" A group including Noam Chomsky, Yanis Varoufakis, Ken Loach, and Brian Eno wrote to The Guardian protesting against the newspaper's reporting. In November the report's main author Dr Justin Schlosberg, wrote an open letter to the Reader's Editor of The Guardian (whom the report had been critical of) criticising the newspaper's lack of reporting or comment on the research, despite it being \\"endorsed by a wide range of experts as well as public figures.\\" and having \\"sparked considerable debate on social media platforms and attracted significant attention from independent media outlets.\\" In March 2019, Neve Gordon, Professor of Politics and Government at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev wrote: \\"the real point of contention ... is not about whether the party should tolerate anti-Semitism, but about what anti-Semitism is.\\" = Journalists and authors = In 2018, Mark Seddon and Francis Beckett conclude that \\"(t)he debate has become toxic. It's all abuse and bullying and point-scoring. It long ago ceased to concentrate on the protection of British Jews on one hand, and the creation of a better and more equal society in Britain on the other.\\" For Matt Seaton the controversy over Labour's attitudes to Jews and antisemitism is a proxy fight whose real conflict is one of a battle for the soul of the party waged between social democrats and traditional anti-imperialist socialists. Rob Ferguson locates the specific attack on Jeremy Corbyn in the UK in the context of wider international developments since 1967 and particularly from the early 2000s. In July 2018, writer and scholar of antisemitism Antony Lerman wrote: \\"It's hard to believe, after the battering Labour has experienced over the issue of antisemitism in the party since Jeremy Corbyn was elected leader and the fact nothing the party has done has succeeded in fully placating its critics, that officials expected anything approximating universal approbation. But the new code [of conduct] had barely seen the light of day before it was being condemned in the harshest terms by all and sundry...\\" In September, he noted \\"...The default mode of almost all the mainstream media is to take as given that the party is institutionally antisemitic\\" and \\"the ever wilder doubling- down on painting Corbyn an antisemite and the increasingly desperate attempts to oust him from the leadership using hatred of Jews as a weapon with which to achieve this.\\" In August 2018, author Lev Golinkin wrote: \\"so many others are, too, for anti-Semitism that's at least as dangerous. And yet the same leaders and institutions who are up in arms over Britain's Labor Party have failed, over and over, to express appropriate outrage\\" and \\"a case can be made that for many of these institutions, people like Corbyn and Farrakhan are manna from heaven, because they allow them to show the world how fiercely they fight anti-Semitism without actually having to do so in places where it's inconvenient.\\" Israeli journalist and author Gideon Levy called Corbyn \\"a paragon of a leftist, one who has fought his whole life for the values he believes in.\\" He added: \\"Leave the incitement campaign against Corbyn and wish him luck: He's a man of conscience, and I hope he'll be Britain's prime minister. It could be good for Israel as well.\\" In November 2019, Levy wrote \\"The new and efficient strategy of Israel and the Zionist establishment brands every seeker of justice as an anti-Semite, and any criticism of Israel as hatred of Jews. Corbyn is a victim of this strategy, which threatens to paralyze and silence Europe with regard to Israel.\\" Writer Richard Seymour wrote: \\"...allegations that Labour is institutionally antisemitic, or that Corbyn himself is a racist, cut against, rather than with, the grain of what people already suspect to be true. Those who dislike Corbyn overwhelmingly think he's a politically correct peacenik, not a Jew-hater.\\" In August 2018, American scholars Noam Chomsky and Norman Finkelstein, called the criticism of Corbyn and Labour 'insane' and 'hysteria' and led by powerful interests, with Chomsky arguing that the aim is to undermine Corbyn's attempt to create a political party responsive to the electorate, and Finkelstein asserting that, given the lack of evidence, the campaign was a calculated hoax.‚Äî In May 2019, Finkelstein called the allegations of antisemitism \\"witch-hunt hysteria\\". In July 2019, Chomsky said: \\"The way charges of anti-semitism are being used in Britain to undermine the Corbyn-led Labour Party is not only a disgrace but also ... an insult to the memory of the victims of the Holocaust.\\" In February 2019, journalist and author Jonathan Cook noted that a Labour Party report by Jennie Formby providing numbers on Labour antisemitism cases \\"decisively undercut\\" the claims of Corbyn's critics \\"not only of endemic anti-semitism in Labour, but of any significant problem at all\\". In November 2019, he said that \\"The media and Israel lobby may have been largely successful in recruiting British Jews and many others to their self-serving campaign to stop Corbyn becoming prime minister...\\" In April 2019, historian and University of Buckingham Professor of Politics Geoffrey Alderman wrote in the Jewish Telegraph that Jeremy Corbyn \\"has an impressive demonstrable record of supporting Jewish communal initiatives\\". In May, he wrote in The Spectator that \\"I will agree that from time to time, as backbench MP and party leader, Corbyn has acted unwisely. But the grounds for labelling him an anti-Semite simply do not exist.\\" In October 2019, Greg Philo, lead author of Bad News for Labour: Antisemitism, the Party and Public Belief remarked in an interview with Jacobin magazine that \\"Both the BBC and even a paper like the Guardian have contributed to public misunderstanding of this issue. They have a moral duty to discuss the new evidence and analysis that we have offered. But both have not covered it. That is a key source of their power ‚Äî they can impose silence and simply refuse to discuss their own role.\\" Palestinian author and academic Ghada Karmi wrote that the book \\"shows Labour is not 'institutionally racist' but the victim of an orchestrated campaign of unfounded accusations of antisemitism.\\" Surveys and studies = General population = In 2015, 2016 and 2017, the Campaign Against Antisemitism (CAA) commissioned YouGov to survey British attitudes towards Jews. The 2017 survey found that supporters of the Labour Party were less likely to hold antisemitic views than those of the Conservative Party or the UK Independence Party (UKIP), while those of the Liberal Democrats were the least likely to hold such views. 32% of Labour supporters endorsed at least one \\"antisemitic attitude\\", as defined by the CAA, compared to 30% for the Liberal Democrat, 39% for UKIP supporters, and 40% for the Conservatives. Further analysis by the blog Evolve Politics of the survey data revealed that, among Labour Party supporters, antisemitism had declined between 2015 and 2017. Antisemitic attitudes among the UK population by political position according to the 2017 JPR survey. The very right-wing are the most antisemitic, while those on the left of the political spectrum are in line with the average of the general public. A Populus poll during August 2018 found the wider British public did not pay much attention to the prominent news coverage over antisemitism in the Labour Party. No more than 5% rated it as the news story they had noticed most. A study into contemporary antisemitism in Britain by the Institute for Jewish Policy Research (JPR) in September 2017 found that \\"Levels of antisemitism among those on the left-wing of the political spectrum, including the far-left, are indistinguishable from those found in the general population. Yet, all parts of those on the left of the political spectrum ‚Äì including the 'slightly left-of-centre,' the 'fairly left-wing' and the 'very left-wing' ‚Äì exhibit higher levels of anti Israelism than average.\\" It went on, \\"The most antisemitic group on the political spectrum consists of those who identify as very right-wing: the presence of antisemitic attitudes in this group is 2 to 4 times higher compared to the general population.\\" It continued: \\"However, in relation to anti-Israel attitudes, the very left-wing lead: 78% (75‚Äì82%) in this group endorse at least one anti-Israel attitude, in contrast to 56% in the general population, and 23% (19‚Äì26%) hold 6‚Äì9 such attitudes, in contrast to 9% in the general population. Elevated levels of anti-Israel attitudes are also observed in other groups on the political left: the fairly left-wing and those slightly left-of-centre. The lowest level of anti-Israel attitudes is observed in the political centre and among those who are slightly right-of-centre or fairly right-wing.\\" The report, however, found that \\"...anti-Israel attitudes are not, as a general rule, antisemitic; but the stronger a person's anti-Israel views, the more likely they are to hold antisemitic attitudes. A majority of those who hold anti-Israel attitudes do not espouse any antisemitic attitudes, but a significant minority of those who hold anti-Israel attitudes hold them alongside antisemitic attitudes. Therefore, antisemitism and anti-Israel attitudes exist both separately and together.\\" The study stated that in \\"surveys of attitudes towards ethnic and religious minorities... The most consistently found pattern across different surveys is heightened animosity towards Jews on the political right...\\" and that \\"The political left, captured by voting intention or actual voting for Labour, appears in these surveys as a more Jewish-friendly, or neutral, segment of the population.\\" = British Jews = In 2017, a poll commissioned by Campaign Against Antisemitism of 1,864 British Jewish adults found that 83% (in 2016, 87%) felt that the Labour Party was too tolerant of antisemitism among its MPs, members, or supporters. A Survation poll by The Jewish Chronicle prior to the 2017 general election found that 13% of Jews intended to vote for Labour, an increase from the 8.5% in May 2016. When asked to rank the degree of \\"antisemitism among the political party's members and elected representatives\\" between 1 (low) to 5 (high), Jews ranked Labour at 3.94, compared with 3.64 for UKIP, 2.7 for the Liberal Democrats, and 1.96 for the Conservatives.Labour support just 13 per cent among UK Jews , The Jewish Chronicle, Marcus Dysch 30 May 2017 In September 2018, a Survation survey conducted for The Jewish Chronicle found that 85.9% of British Jews considered Jeremy Corbyn antisemitic, and 85.6% considered the Labour Party to have \\"high\\" or \\"very high\\" levels of antisemitism within the party's members and elected representatives. This compares to 1.7% and 6.1% for Theresa May and the Conservative Party respectively. This was an increase from 69% who considered the party to have \\"high\\" or \\"very high\\" levels of antisemitism in 2017. A poll conducted for The Jewish Chronicle by Survation in October 2019 showed that 87% of British Jews believed that Corbyn was antisemitic, with 47% \\"seriously considering\\" leaving the country if Corbyn became Prime Minister. = Labour Party members = In May 2016, a YouGov poll found that 49% of Labour members felt that the party did not have a problem with antisemitism, 47% agreed that it was a problem, but \\"no worse than in other parties, while 5% thought that antisemitism is a bigger problem in Labour than in other parties. In March 2018, a poll showed 77% of Labour members believed the charges of antisemitism to be deliberately exaggerated to undermine the leader or stop criticism of Israel, while 19% said it was a serious issue.

It has two areas of habitation, consisting of over 800 rooms and was inhabited from approximately 1000-1450 A.D. History The older section of the pueblo was inhabited during the Pueblo III Period, from 1250-1300. It has a variety of masonry styles, and several different building materials were used, including large sandstone boulders, smaller sandstone, and river cobblestones. At the southern end of the northern pueblo rests a large great kiva, with an eastern entry ramp. The construction began with a few central rooms, and as the population grew additional rooms were added as necessary, without any central plan.Archeology Southwest, pp. 5-6 The great kiva was constructed first, along with a suite of rooms immediately adjacent. The additional rooms were added as needed to the north and east of this original structure.Archeology Southwest, p. 13 The newer, southern section was inhabited from 1310-1370. It was a much more planned construction, with rooms constructed of tabular sandstone arranged in a geometric grid pattern around the central plaza, which in turn had a single rectangular great kiva on its southern side.Archeology Southwest, p. 6 The pueblo was one of the largest situated in Little Colorado River valley, and one of the few which was continuously inhabited throughout the Pueblo III and Pueblo IV periods. The ancient pueblo residents constructed numerous irrigation canals, utilizing the waters of the river. Excavations were conducted on the site during the 1980s and 1990s by the White Mountain Archaeological Center, although no papers were published regarding those excavations, and any artifacts from those digs have not been shared with the public. Description Sherwood Ranch Pueblo had formerly been known by the name \\"Raven Ruin\\", but became known by the name of the ranch on which it was located when it was donated to The Archaeological Conservancy in 2003 by Ruth and Wendell Sherwood. The site clearly has two distinct areas of habitation, the older is situated to the north, with the newer portion is at the southern end of the site. The site was inhabited from approximately 1000 through 1450 A.D., and has features of both the Mogollon and Anasazi cultures, to the south and north respectively. It contains two kivas and estimates of the total number of rooms varying from 250 to over 800.Archeology Southwest, p. 4 The pueblo is claimed as ancestral by both the Hopi and Zuni tribes, and was one of the last settlements to be abandoned at the end of the Pueblo IV era.

Michiel Brinkman is notable for his Justus van Effen housing block complex in Spangen, which is a Rijksmonument, built in 1922. it incorporates 3m wide connecting terraces on the third floor, known in Dutch as Bovenstraten (sing. Bovenstraat), and in English as 'Streets in the sky'. Career Michiel Brinkman was born in Rotterdam on 16 December 1873, the son of Hermanus Antonie Brinkman and Anna Maria Brinkman (n√©e Juijn). He married Andrea Johanna Salomina Wulff. He studied at the Academie van Beeldende Kunsten en Technische Wetenschappen under Henri Evers. He practised in the office of Barend Hooijkaas jr., until 1910 when he opened his own firm. Brinkman en Hooijkaas during 1908-1909, built the Koninklijke Roei- en Zeilvereeniging De Maas in Veerhaven. This is celebrated as a Rijksmonument. The architecture practice Brinkman & Van der Vlugt (1925-1936) designed the Van Nelle factory in Rotterdam, the Feyenoord football stadium and the standard Dutch telephone box. Later he worked with his son, J.A. Brinkman, in a partnership with L.C. van der Vlugt, J.H. van den Broek and Jaap Bakema. Justus van Effencomplex Justus van Effen site in 2017 :\\"the apotheosis of Dutch functionalism \\":Arjan Hebly In 1919 Michiel Brinkman designed a complex of 273 dwellings in the Spangen district of Rotterdam. One large block of 147 by 85 metres encircles a courtyard containing a few smaller blocks and a central taller service block with a central heating plant, baths and cycle shelter. A public street enters and leaves the perimeter hugging block through 6m high arches, the road forks at the facilities building. An architecturally significant feature was the use of an access terrace, the bovenstraat a raised walkway along the block's inner edge at third storey level. This reduced the need for many space-consuming stair towers. Brinkman chose to offer a middle ground between two conventional models of social housing: the poorly ventilated, dimly lit towers of dense cities and the undifferentiated row houses of suburban enclaves. He aimed to achieve a feeling of unity associated with garden-village development, whilst using a stacked construction and bovenstraten. He was experienced in planning industrial buildings where the flows of commodities between processes are critical, and he took such a systems approach towards housing. Tradesmens' delivery route were facilitated, and the directions of rubbish disposal. He was familiar with new ways of working with reinforced concrete, and employed it to form the floor decks. Balconies were precast. The window sizes followed function, large for lounges and small and recessed for bedrooms. Window placement was such that they were designed into the room, but also used externally as a regular visual feature. The courtyard is broken up into a series public areas that ripple from small to large giving a dynamic to the external space. Buildings are pierced at ground floor level by the road and main pathways but are continuous at the level of the bovenstraat. Most units are entered from the inner courtyard. Units on the ground and first floors are accessed at ground level and have their own garden. Above these are two maisonettes reached from the access gallery. All units consist of a living room, kitchen, toilet and three bedrooms, plus central heating which was a first for Dutch social housing, and a rubbish chute The bovenstraat was reached by one of ten stairways and two goods lifts, which allowed tradesmen to bring their trolleys, which were very much a feature of 1920s South Holland, up to the front-doors. The terraces were provided with plant-boxes and play space for the children to socialise. Every unit had outside laundry drying space. There was some initial criticism that this was 'un-Dutch' and just added unnecessary cost to the scheme, this was adamantly rebuked by the Socialist dominated city council. The neglected scheme was first renovated in 1985-1990, some maisonettes were knocked through to provide accommodation for larger families and the walls were rendered with a white stucco, and the detailed windows replaced with generic stock. This was at a time of recession in Rotterdam and the project was not successful. A second attempt led by Dutch architecture practices Molenaar & Co. and Hebly Theunissen, and a landscape architect Michael van Gessel, began in 2006 and was completed in 2012. The restoration team won the 2016 World Monuments Fund/Knoll Modernism Prize for their work.2016 World Monuments Fund/Knoll Modernism Prize. Retrieved 31 December 2018 The original exterior details were restored, while the interiors were improved by installing modern heating systems that use rooftop solar panels to capture heat for hotwater and glazing the interior doors to improve the quality of the light. The bovenstraat walkway concept, 'Streets in the sky', influential on Dutch architecture was developed further by Le Corbusier for his Unite d'Habitation in Marseilles, and later by Peter and Alison Smithson for Golden Lane Estate and Robin Hood Gardens, in London.

Her parents were both members of the Reformed church that traced its inauguration back to Huldrych Zwingli, and they both voted for the Social Democrats. Eva was the eldest of her parents' four children. Walther Kolmer (1879‚Äì1931), her father, held a position as \\"Imperial and Royal Adjunct Professor\\" in Human Medicine and Biology at the University of Vienna. Eva's father was his parents' only child. During her own childhood Eva spent a lot of time with her paternal grandparents, enjoying access to her grandfather's book collection and able to listen to the \\"grown- up conversations\\" when there were guests. Gustav Kolmer, her grandfather, worked as a parliamentary correspondent with the Neue Freie Presse, one of Vienna's leading daily newspapers. Eva's mother, born Lili Erika Pereles (1887-1942), came from a family which had risen to moderate prosperity, owning a series of shoe factories, but she had many cousins and three elder siblings: she appears herself to have grown up in modest circumstances. While her children were small she worked during the afternoons as her husband's secretary. Later, on 17 August 1942, Lili Erika Kolmer was deported to the Maly Trostenets extermination camp near Minsk, and murdered there on 21 August. The family was a musical one and Eva took piano lessons till she was twelve, after which other interests came to the fore. She grew up and attended the gymnasium (secondary school) in the D√∂bling quarter of Vienna, on the north side of the city, a short walk beyond the university. She passed her school final exams (\\"Abitur\\") in 1930. She was already actively interested in issues of social justice while still at school, and involved with the Young Communists. She remained in Vienna, now as a medical student, between 1931 and 1938, although her student career was not uninterrupted. She had already, when aged just seventeen, joined the Communist Party in September 1930. There are indications that in 1930, it was in order to demonstrate solidarity with the working class that she took a job in a light bulb factory, but she soon moved on, to work as a research assistant at the bacteriological institute of the Vienna University Institute for Experimental Pathology. Her father's death, from a heart attack in 1931, left her widowed mother with four children to support on a small pension, and from 1931, in parallel with her university studies, Kolmer was earning money by undertaking cancer research on behalf of the \\"Pearson Research Foundation\\" She had already produced her first piece of published research, an article entitled \\"A specific detection of cadmium\\" (\\"Ein spezifischer Nachweis des Cadmiums\\"), jointly with F.Pavelka, in 1930. = Student years = During her student years Kolmer, while still active as a Communist Party member, also participated in the activities of the Socialist Students Association (\\"Verband Sozialistischer StudentInnen √ñsterreichs\\" / VSSt√ñ). The 1933 Nazi take-over in Germany had its counterpart in neighbouring Austria, where between 1932 and 1934 Chancellor Dolfuss systematically transformed the country into a one-party dictatorship. The Communist Party was outlawed in May 1933. Kolmer persisted with her political activism, however: she was arrested in August 1934 and held by the authorities for several months. Among her mother's wider family, the arrest drew attention to Eva's Communist activism, and she found herself marked out as something of a \\"black sheep\\". Her mother's elder sister, Marie, lived at this time in Berlin and was married to a director of \\"British Petrol\\". Relations between the sisters and their respective families were now severed. At the university she passed the exams for the first stage of her degree in 1935, but Prof. Freund, the head of the university institute at which she was studying, warned her not to persist with her political activities. The Pearson foundation which was funding her research (and, indirectly, her university studies) sent Kolmer to work for a period in a Swiss cancer sanatorium. She was able to save some money from this work which funded further travel. However, after briefly backing away from her political activities she resumed \\"semi-legal work\\" on behalf of the party in Women's Associations and Consumer Co-operatives. She undertook her first trip to England at the end of 1935. In 1936 she began a clinical internship but also intensified her political activism. That led to a decline in her academic results. For the first time, she failed an exam, which led to another difficult conversation with Prof. Freund at the institute. It took place in the wake of a period working at the \\"London Hospital\\", which had been intended to create awareness for a cancer diagnosis method that Freund had developed: that exercise had not been a success. There was also conflict involving \\"Mr. Pearson\\" resulting from awareness of Kolmer's communist activities. The Pearson institute was the institute's principal funder. Prof. Freund told her that as an \\"incorrigible communist\\" she would have to abandon her course. = English exile = In March 1938 Austria was incorporated into Germany, creating a \\"Greater Germany\\", albeit under circumstances that those who had advocated the arrangement when German unification had risen up the agenda during the previous century could not have foreseen. On account both of her Jewish provenance and of her record of left-wing political activism, Kolmer could not expect an easy life in a state controlled by the Nazis. The Pearson foundation which had sponsored her research earlier in the decade was based in England, and her own travels had enabled her to establish further contacts in London. By now she had also mastered the English language. Following the advice of party comrades she emigrated, leaving Vienna on 16 March 1938 with a train ticket that took her to Z√ºrich, from where she went on via Paris (where she encountered \\"passport problems\\"), arriving in London on 24 March 1938. She arrived, one of the first of a wave of political exiles from Austria, with a British pound in her handbag and, as she later wrote, no idea that she was not to set foot in her native land for another seven years. An \\"invitation letter\\" from an English friend had persuaded the authorities to let her into the country, and supported a three-month visitor's permit, but she had no long term visa and no permission to obtain work. The invitation letter had been provided by Wilson Harris, a prominent journalist and the editor of The Spectator whom she had met the previous year while visiting London on a journalistic assignment of her own, on behalf of the \\"Wiener Wirtschaftswoche\\". The Spectator's traditionalist conservatism reflected its editor's background, and it is hard to have seen that there can have been much meeting of minds between Kolmer and Harris on political matters. Harris was, as it turned out, one of several contacts in the English establishment whom she had been able to cultivate during her visits to London during the 1930s. Others included the Liberal politician, Geoffrey Mander who, like Wilson, took a particular interest in Austria, along with the formidable feminist campaigner Margery Corbett Ashby and the Duchess of Atholl, whom Kolmer later described as \\"highly prominent but completely mad\\". In due course the administrative issues began to be resolved and she obtained laboratory work with her former sponsors at the Pearson Organisation. Fairly soon she was dropped by Pearson \\"on political grounds\\", however. She was able to stay with Margery Corbett Ashby for her first month in England. During this time she found time to produce a short report, describing the dramatic events of March 1938 in Austria. Wilson Harris provided an introduction to the London publisher, Michael Joseph: she published her account under the title \\"Austria Still Lives\\" in London in May 1938 under the pseudonym \\"Mitzi Hartmann\\". The fifty pounds she received for the little book enabled her to repay a debt and live on the balance for a short time. She also found casual secretarial and journalistic work. She was particularly appreciative of the learning opportunities provided by a stint working at \\"The Peckham Pioneer Healther Centre\\". In September 1938 Kolmer was a co-founder, with Ruth Zerner, of the non-party-political \\"Council of Austrians in Great Britain\\" In March 1939 she was appointed general secretary of the \\"Austrian Centre\\" in London, an appointment which required her to obtain permission from the British Interior Ministry (\\"Home Office\\"), and for which she received a payment of two pounds per week. By this time, as more victims of race based or political persecution attempted to gain admittance from central Europe to England she had, in the words of one source, \\"become well established in Austrian refugee relief work\\". In September 1939 the British government declared war on Germany, following the simultaneous invasion of Poland by Germany and the Soviet Union. It would take several more months before the war had a serious impact on most people's daily lives in London, and in the meantime, during the nervous months of uncertainty at the end of 1939, Eva Kolmer married Jakob Wolloch, a childhood friend who was now, like her an Austrian refugee from political persecution, living in London. One practical step the government could take on the home front, as it waited to find out what war would involve, was to dust down a regulation providing for the arrest and detention of enemy aliens. While the armies of Germany and the Soviet Union concentrated on the carve up of Poland, the significance of this remained unclear, but once France was invaded, in May 1940, the British government decided that thousands of people who had fled from the Nazis during the previous few years because they were persecuted on account of their Jewishness and/or their political activities, represented a threat. Mass arrests took place. Eva Kolmer, well connected with the British establishment, found herself classified as \\"an official of a refugee organisation\\", and so she was not interned. She was indeed permitted to visit Austrian internees in the camps to which they had been consigned by the British authorities. Jakob Wolloch, her new husband, was not so lucky and she was obliged to lobby extensively to try and hasten his release, at the same time using all her contacts to lobby more widely against the policy of arresting political refugees. Sources are silent about the effectiveness of her campaigning on her husband's behalf. Within a year or two the British government had changed its mind about the problem of the enemy aliens, and most were quietly released, The Wolloch marriage quickly broke apart, ending in divorce. The British security services were aware of Eva Wolloch's political sympathies and aware of concerns within the political establishment that known communists among the German and Austrian refugees might make common cause with Britain's home-grown communists, to the detriment of British interests. They certainly took a close interest in her activities while she was in England, although the practical impact on her of British security services' attentions is not clear. As the war progressed Eva Wolloch was associated with a number of groups and activities, including many that involved with fellow members of the Austrian Communist Party, though it is hard to determine whether this was part of a communist conspiracy, or simply a matter of political refugees from Nazism doing what they could in opposition to a shared enemy. In or before 1941 she was a co-founder of the \\"Free Austrian movement\\" which operated in close concert with the \\"Austrian Centre\\" and almost certainly had links to the Soviet Union. However, there are suggestions that exiled Austrian communists played down their communist connections in order to avoid antagonising the British authorities and to work with the may Austrian refugees who had been persecuted for reasons of race, and who would have been horrified to be associated with communists. = Heinz Schmidt = From around 1941 Eva Wolloch was living in London with the German journalist (and communist) Heinz Schmidt. War ended in May 1945, with both Austria and the western two thirds of Germany under allied military occupation. The allies had already agreed in 1943 that in political terms Austria should not remain integrated into a larger Germany state. In the early part of 1946 Heinz Schmidt returned to the part of Germany now administered as the Soviet occupation zone By this time Eva Wolloch had already returned to Vienna, where she had been selected to become secretary of the communist faction in the lower house of a restored National Council (parliament). There existed a complementary (or alternative) possibility of formally completing her medical studies and working as a doctor.Gedenkbuch f√ºr die Opfer des Nationalsozialismus an der Universit√§t Wien 1938, Wien 2009. It is not without irony that the promising political career set out before her in occupied Austria was trumped by her love for a man. After much agonising, and following discussion with the Austrian party leaders Johann Koplenig and Friedl F√ºrnberg, she would end up moving to the Soviet occupation zone in Germany in order to rejoin Schmidt. There was no possibility in occupied post-war Europe of moving directly from Vienna to Berlin, and by 17 February 1946 she was back in London. That was the date on which she wrote to Viktor Matejka, who was taking a lead from the political left in re-establishing a democratic political structure in Vienna: \\"My future is still very uncertain, but I will in any case spend a few more weeks here in England\\". In the end she found herself staying in England till August 1946, although once it became clear that she had decided not to build her future in Austria she lost much of her leadership role and political influence with the Austrian refugee community, many of whom were impatient to be able to return home. She applied at least some her energies to contributing newspaper articles and lecturing on her experiences of Vienna. She also compiled a booklet of memoirs on the \\"Austrian Centre\\" and her work with the Austrian expatriate community during seven years of enforced exile in London. = Soviet occupation zone = When she joined Heinz Schmidt in the Soviet occupation zone in the late summer of 1946, Eva Kolmer also became a member of the recently formed Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED). A united party of the left, formed out of the conviction that back in 1933 the Nazi Party had been able to take power because of divisions of the political left, the SED soon became the ruling party in a new kind of German one-party dictatorship. Eva's medical qualifications were retrospectively conferred, respecting the unusual circumstances which had made it impossible for her to take her final medical exams before she fled Vienna in 1938. In 1947 Eva Wolloch and Heinz Schmidt were married. Their daughter Renate was born at the end of that year. Their son Walter was born in May 1950. While Heinz Schmidt took a top job with the Berliner Rundfunk (radio station), Eva Schmidt-Kolmer (as she now became) took a position as head of the statistics and information department at the National Administration (in the Soviet zone) for Health Care. In this role she was instrumental in drafting the law on the care of mothers and children (\\"Gesetz √ºber den Mutter- und Kinderschutz\\") which, following the relaunch of the Soviet zone as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany) in October 1949, became, in September 1950, one of the first laws to be ratified by the country's new parliament (\\"Volkskammer\\"). In 1948, based in Berlin, she became national secretary of the Democratic Women's League (\\" Demokratischer Frauenbund Deutschlands\\" / DFD), of which she was, according to at least one source, a co-founder. In March 1948 Eva Schmidt-Kolmer was one of 400 delegates to the People's Council (\\"Deutscher Volksrat\\") which convened in the Soviet part of Berlin, mandated to draw up a constitution, based on a draft created two years earlier by The Party. She was also a member of the Provisional Parliament (\\"Provisorische Volkskammer\\") which met in October 1949 with instructions to implement that constitution. By this time she sat not as an SED member but as a member for the DFD which, in addition to its other functions, was one of the mass movements that received a (fixed) allocation of seats in the legislature. Although seat allocation was controlled by the ruling party, the inclusion of other \\"parties\\" and non-parties in the legislature was intended to provide for a more inclusive political power structure. Critics saw this as a largely cosmetic device. = German Democratic Republic = Many political refugees who had headed for Moscow to escape the Nazis in the 1930s had ended up in internal exile, and would still have months or years to wait at the end of the war before they would be able to leave the Soviet Union. However, there was one group of 30 men who had spent the war years in Moscow and who remained on good terms with the Soviet leadership. These men were flown back to Berlin by the Soviets, under conditions of great secrecy, on 30 April 1945, a week before the formal end of the war. Much later these men came to be known as the Ulbricht Group, and during the decade 1945/55 it turned out that they had arrived with a very detailed plan for the future of Germany. After a series of confrontations in 1949 it became clear that the United States and its allies could and would block the extension of the group's nation building programme across the western part of Germany. Nevertheless, within the area administered, till 1949, as the Soviet occupation zone, by the time the German Democratic Republic was founded, the entire region had been established, in its basic essentials, as a Soviet-style one-party \\"communist\\" state. As cold war tensions intensified, the East German leaders who had spent the war in Moscow grew increasingly mistrustful of those comrades who had not. The most high- profile victim of this development was probably Paul Merker, but there were others lower down in the power structure who also found themselves branded as \\"Westemigranten\\" (\\"Western emigrants\\") as Walter Ulbricht, backed by his immediate circle sought to consolidate their power base. On 20 October 1949 the Politburo removed Heinz Schmidt from his post at Berlin Radio, citing his \\"nationalistic arrogance\\" and \\"insufficient political vigilance\\" (\\"nationalistischer √úberheblichkeit [und] ungen√ºgender politischer Wachsamkeit\\"). Between 1950 and 1955 he was retained on the books at Berlin Radio under a \\"provisional contract\\" in the production department. What actually happened was that he was relocated to Schwerin in the extreme north of the country, accompanied by his wife.G. Niebsch, Ch. Grosch, U. Bo√üdorf, G. Graehn-Baumann: \\"Gesundheit, Entwicklung und Erziehung in der fr√ºhen Kindheit: Wissenschaft und Praxis der Kinderbetreuung in der DDR. Der Anteil Eva Schmidt-Kolmers an der Konzipierung und Realisierung.\\" Lang, Frankfurt am Main 2007, ., pp.28, 124, 300 In Schwerin Heinz was employed in a relatively low- grade position as head of the Arts and Culture section at the Regional Headquarters of the Machine and tractor station. (Agricultural land had been taken over by the state, but tractors and other farm equipment were separately acquired, maintained and allocated as required, so that the Machine and tractor stations, became vital strategic elements in the rural economy of East Germany, just as they already were in the Soviet Union.) Eva gave birth to the couple's son in May 1950. Following that she was employed as a section leader in the regional head office of a trade organisation. However, in 1951 she was given a job much closer to her heart, as head of the Mother and Child Health Protection Department at the Ministry for Health Care office covering Mecklenburg. Her talent for extreme multi-tasking was again on display during her time in Mecklenburg, as Eva Schmidt-Kolmer combined her day job with a programme of intensive research on themes involving child health and protection. On 11 July 1952 she received her doctorate: her dissertation was entitled \\"Health protection for mother and child\\" (\\"Gesundheitsschutz f√ºr Mutter und Kind\\"). Schmidt-Kolmer and her husband were evidently rehabilitated in 1954. They relocated again, this time to Leipzig, home of the prestigious Karl-Marx University (as it was then known). In Leipzig Heinz Schmidt became editor in chief of, Das Magazin. while his wife undertook a specialist medical training in social psychology (\\"Sozialhygiene\\") at the University Medical Faculty. She had already, in 1953, accepted an invitation to head up a working group on infant and toddler hygiene under the auspices of the East German Social Psychology Study Group (\\"Arbeitsgemeinschaft der Sozialhygieniker in der DDR\\"). This gave her the opportunity to study research from the Anglo- Saxon world, notably by John Bowlby and James Robertson, including their then pioneering work on attachment theory, key parts of which were translated and published in the East German medical literature.J. Robertson: √úber den Verlust m√ºtterlicher F√ºrsorge in fr√ºher Kindheit. In: Zeitschrift f√ºr √§rztliche Fortbildung 1957, 21/22. Over the next few years there were a number of comparative studies undertaken in East Germany to compare the outcomes for children brought up within a family and those who grew up in institutions. The studies always revealed substantial developmental disadvantages for the institutionalised children, while children who grew up in a family environment consistently displayed the better outcomes. Schmidt-Kolmer was involved in extensive discussion and testing of different approaches that might be used to narrow or eliminate the gap, such as step-by-step familiarization in place of sudden institutionalisation, personal toys, mixed age grouping, avoidance of frequent personnel changes among care staff and promotion of contact with birth families. In 1956 the couple were allowed to return to Berlin. Armed with her doctorate, on 1 July 1956 Schmidt-Kolmer joined the social psychology (\\"Sozialhygiene\\") department of the Medical Faculty at the Humboldt University, initially as a senior assistant, mandated by her new boss, Prof.Kuert Winter, to develop her expertise in the field of social psychology. She received her habilitation (higher academic qualification) in 1957 or 1958 for work on childhood development during the first three years of life. The qualification opened the way to a long-term academic career, and she accepted a teaching chair in her chosen speciality. A full professorship quickly followed. According to at least one source, as a university teacher she in effect founded the discipline of \\"Childhood and youth social hygiene\\" (\\"Hygiene des Kindes- und Jugendalters\\"), which she then promoted and developed through her research and teaching. In 1959 Schmidt-Kolmer conducted in the northern town of G√ºstrow what was described as the first large scale comparison research project between children growing up (1)in families, (2)with daycare centres, (3)with working-weekly child care centres and (4)in long-term care using children's homes.Eva Schmidt-Kolmer: Verhalten und Entwicklung des Kleinkindes. Der Einflu√ü verschiedenartigen sozialen Milieus auf das kindliche Verhalten und seine Bedeutung f√ºr die Hygiene des Kindesalters. Berlin, 1959. That same year she was appointed to head up the \\"Department for [Social] Hygiene in childhood\\" (\\"Abteilung f√ºr Hygiene des Kindesalters\\") at the Berlin University Institute for Social Hygiene. However, after the imposition of the Berlin Wall in August 1961, the results of her research studies ceased to be published, and independent research teams in Halle, Leipzig and Berlin were disbanded. There was no further discussion of attachment theory. Ideas about reforming child rearing outside the family were left to wither and then disappeared from the East German public agenda. Schmidt-Kolmer served between 1966 and 1974 as director of the \\"National Institute for [Social] Hygiene during childhood and adolescence\\" (\\" Zentralinstituts f√ºr Hygiene des Kindes- und Jugendalters Berlin der DDR\\"). She chose the name of the institute herself, intending to emphasize the interdisciplinary nature of the administrative and academic responsibilities for health protection throughout childhood and adolescence (\\"um die Interdisziplinarit√§t der administrativen und wissenschaftlichen Aufgaben des Gesundheitsschutzes f√ºr das gesamte Kindes- und Jugendalter deutlich zu machen\\"). This centrally directed institute was given the task of creating a mandatory education programme for all the childcare facilities in the country. Eva Schmidt-Kolmer never left anyone in any doubt about the closeness of her own involvement in this till the day she retired, and indeed she remained closely in touch with the institute till it was closed down, in the context of reunification, in 1990. On the basis of her research, Schmidt-Kolmer pleaded for the systematic creation and expansion of day nurseries. Under her leadership, between 1971 and 1973 six thousand children in daycare centres were closely monitored during their first three years. Motor skills, game activity, language and social skills were observed and measured using test procedures. They showed that the more time parents spend with their children, the better the children develop. Especially during the first two years, the overall mental development of the child depends on joint activity with the parents.B.

Berlin 1998 (degree dissertation) = Retirement and death = After she retired she remained active, producing various papers and books and serving on a number of committees. At the end of her life Eva Schmidt-Kolmer became seriously ill with cancer. She died in Berlin on 29 August 1991.

She was an influential participant of the Black Movement of Brazil from its beginnings in the 1960s until her death. Through her academic research, she evaluated the importance of quilombos as autonomous spaces for people of African descent during the colonial period and challenged the political environment and racial policies of the government toward Afro- Brazilians. Her scholarship on the invisibility of black women, and particularly non-Anglo women of the African diaspora had an international impact on research regarding the complexities of the black experience and lack of attention focused on Afro-Latinas in transnational feminism. Early life Maria Beatriz do Nascimento was born on 12 July 1942 in Aracaju, Sergipe, Brazil to Rubina Pereira Nascimento and Francisco Xavier do Nascimento. Her father was a mason and her mother raised their ten children. Nascimento was their eighth child. Around 1949, the family migrated south and settled in the Cordovil neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro. After completing her secondary schooling, she enrolled at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), graduating with a bachelor's degree in history in 1971. During her schooling, she became involved in the Black Movement of Brazil (). Beginning as a student organizer, Nascimento was a co-founder of several associations and attended numerous conferences and public forum discussions on blackness and racial politics. Career Upon graduating, Nascimento began working as an intern at the Brazilian National Archives and continued her education, studying at the Fluminense Federal University (UFF). She married Jose do Rosario Freitas Gomes and the couple subsequently had a daughter, Beth√¢nia Gomes. While at UFF, she was involved in the founding of the Andre Rebou√ßas Working Group, which had a significant effect on the resurgence of black identity and the politicization of race under the Brazilian military government from 1974 to 1985. Her research during this period centered on ethnographic studies in three of the surviving quilombo communities (African-Brazilian Maroon societies) in Minas Gerais. Conducting interviews and evaluating archival materials, Nascimento came to recognize quilombos as \\"autonomous black spaces of liberation\\". In 1977, Nascimento was one of the speakers at the Quinzena do Negro (Black Fortnight), organized by Eduardo Oliveira e Oliveira at the University of S√£o Paulo. The conference was pivotal in Nascimento's development, and was where she secured her place as an anchor in the Black Movement, through her introduction of theoretical ideas about the significance of quilombos for Afro-Brazilians and the intersection of race and gender in the political environment for black women in Brazil. She also strongly criticized the Brazilian Academy of Sciences for its racist policies. In 1978, she joined the Movimento Negro Unificado Contra a Discrimina√ß√£o Racial (Unified Black Movement, or MNU) and over the next decade worked with Raquel Gerber, a filmmaker, on a documentary which would become one of her most important legacies. Nascimento completed her graduate studies at UFF in 1981 and began a master's degree program at UFRJ studying communications with , a noted Brazilian sociologist and journalist. She taught history at the Rome State School (), in Copacabana and published articles in various newspapers and journals like Estudos Afro-Asi√°ticos (Afro-Asian Studies), Folha de S√£o Paulo, Revista Cultura Vozes (Culture Voices Magazine), and Revista do Patrim√¥nio Hist√≥rico (Historical Patrimony Magazine), while serving on the editorial board of Boletim do Centen√°rio da Aboli√ß√£o e Rep√∫blica (Centennial Bulletin of Abolition and the Republic). In 1989, Nascimento and Gerber released Ori, their documentary about the relationship between Africa and Brazil and the Black Movement in the country. Death and legacy Nascimento was murdered on 28 January 1995 during a domestic dispute between Aurea and Ant√¥nio Jorge Amorim Viana, known as Danone. The murderer, Danone, believed that Nascimento had counseled his wife, Aurea to leave him because of their violent relationship. At the time of her death Nascimento and Gomes had separated, and she was in relationship with Roberto Rosemburg, her common law spouse. She was buried on 30 January 1995 at the Cemit√©rio de S√£o Jo√£o Batista. Nascimento impacted international scholarship on black women, calling into question their invisibility because of patriarchy and colonialism, but also because of the over-emphasis on the English-speaking diaspora among academics and the language barriers to intellectual discourse from non-Anglo scholars. Nascimento caused feminist scholars to recognize the need for expanding research to encompass Afro-Latinas for a deeper understanding of the complexities impacting the African diaspora. Al√©x Ratts published a biography on Nascimento and her career, Eu Sou Atl√¢ntica in 2007.

Other early Zoroastrians include Pestonji Framji Daver, a Parsi who came to San Francisco in 1892, and the first recorded Irani Zoroastrian, Rostam Kermani, who settled in the United States in 1926. It is believed that the first North American Zoroastrian Association was formed in 1929, when a group of seven Zoroastrians in the New York area gathered in one Phiroze Saklatwala‚Äôs living room on November 10, 1929. Overview The oldest fire temple in the United States was one purchased by Arbab Rustam Guiv in New Rochelle. The most notable fire temple in the United States is the Dar-e-Mehr temple located in Pomona, New York. It was purchased in 2001 and subsequently purpose-built with Zoroastrian tenets and then inaugurated in April 2016. Demographics In 2006, the United States had the world's third-largest Zoroastrian population at six thousand adherents.

It is one of only two forts on the Antonine Wall to have been found with stone ramparts; the other is Castlecary. A digital reconstruction of the fort has been created. Location Balmuildy Bridge looking south towards Glasgow from the air The fort is located in Glasgow, west of Bishopbriggs and east of Bearsden, south of the River Kelvin and north of the Forth and Clyde Canal. The fort was just south of the River Kelvin and north-west of Easter Balmuildy Farm which locates it within Glasgow City Council's borders, close to East Dunbartonshire to the east. Its neighbouring forts are Bearsden to the west and Cadder to the east although there are intermediate fortlets at Summerston to the west and Wilderness Plantation to the east. See map below for details. Context Forts and Fortlets associated with the Antonine Wall from west to east: Bishopton, Old Kilpatrick, Duntocher, Cleddans, Castlehill, Bearsden, Summerston, Balmuildy, Wilderness Plantation, Cadder, Glasgow Bridge, Kirkintilloch, Auchendavy, Bar Hill, Croy Hill, Westerwood, Castlecary, Seabegs, Rough Castle, Camelon, Watling Lodge, Falkirk, Mumrills, Inveravon, Kinneil, Carriden Mars Ultor has been scanned and a video produced. Balmuildy Castro was constructed between 142 and 154AD at the order of Roman Emperor Antoninus Pius.Robertson, Anne S. (1960) The Antonine Wall. Glasgow Archaeological Society. p. 7. Quintus Lollius Urbicus, governor of Roman Britain at the time, initially supervised the effort. It was one of sixteen forts built to support the Antonine Wall, with small fortlets between them; troop movement was facilitated by a road linking all the sites known as the Military Way. Antoninus Pius never visited Britain, whereas his predecessor Hadrian did. Pressure from the Caledonians may have led Antoninus to send the empire's troops further north. The wall, and Balmuildy, was abandoned only eight years after completion, and the garrisons relocated back to Hadrian's Wall. In 208 Emperor Septimius Severus re-established legions at the wall and ordered repairs; this has led to the wall being referred to as the Severan Wall. The occupation ended a few years later, and the wall was not occupied again. Most Roman forts along the wall held garrisons of around 500 men. Larger forts like Castlecary and Birrens had a nominal cohort of 1,000 men but probably sheltered women and children as well, although the troops were not allowed to marry. It is likely that there were large communities of civilians around the site. Descriptions and finds Second Legion. George MacDonald calls in no. 27 in the 2nd edition of his book The Roman Wall in Scotland. It has been scanned and a video produced. The site was excavated by Steuart Napier Miller who wrote about it in his 1922 volume: The Roman fort at Balmuildy (Summerston, near Glasgow) on the Antonine Wall. Sir George Macdonald also described the site in the 1934 in The Roman wall in Scotland. The related site of Summerston was written about by J. M. Davidson in 1937. An altar to Fortuna was found in one of the fort's bath houses similar to the one found at Castlecary. There was also an altar dedicated to Mars found along with some statues. A dedication to a building by the Second Legion was found although the stone had been repurposed by farmers. Fragments of another stone by the same legion were also discovered. Part has been scanned and a video produced. All of these finds are now in the Hunterian Museum in Glasgow. Other discoveries include: a door hinge plate, a terracotta bath house drainpipe, a holdfast to stick tiles to the bath house wall, a perfume pot, an unguent pot, a Samian ware platter, and a clay cheese press.

Her library was the basis for what is now the Women's Library. Early life Bentinck was born in Tangier in 1867. Her father was the aristocrat Ferdinand Seymour, Earl St. Maur, while her mother, Rosina Elizabeth Swan, was a maid. Her father was the son and heir of Edward, 12th Duke of Somerset and his wife, Georgiana Sheridan (a daughter of Thomas Sheridan and the novelist Caroline Callander). Her parents brought her to England, where they had a son, Harold St. Maur, but her father died in 1869 and they never married. She and her brother were brought up by her paternal grandparents after her mother married again and her stepfather died. Her illegitimacy was a problem during her childhood but this was balanced by the education and care that her de facto parents gave her. They also gave her their surname.David Doughan, \\"Bentinck, Ruth Mary Cavendish (1867‚Äì1953)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2006. Retrieved 25 November 2017. When her grandmother died she was left ¬£80,000. Political involvement In 1909, she joined the Women's Social and Political Union. This was a militant organisation who believed in \\"Deeds not Words\\". Bentinck did wear a sandwich board but unlike many of its members she was never arrested. She wrote The Point Of Honour: A Correspondence On Aristocracy And Socialism in 1909. The third key event in 1909 was founding a library that was to become in time the Women's Library. In 1912, Bentinck and Florence Gertrude de Fonblanque organised a suffrage demonstration that involved women dressed in brown, green and white walking from Edinburgh to London. The \\"Brown Women\\" gathered signatures for a petition and national attention. The following year de Fonblanque and Bentick decided to set up the Qui Vive Corps. The idea was that these brown, green and white uniformed volunteers would appear at suffrage events organised by any organisation. It was intended that these would attend any suffrage inspired event. The Qui Vive Corps were involved in campaigning among the miners for the Labour Party in Derbyshire and Staffordshire. The reason for their support for Labour was because the suffragettes objected to the governing Liberal Party's policy of not supporting women's suffrage. In 1913, she was involved with the Northern Men's Federation for Women's Suffrage which she was helping to organise. In 1918, her library was given to the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS) although Bentinck still took a strong interest. The library is considered her most important legacy. The NUWSS gave the library to the Women's (Service) Library in 1931. Her collection is considered to be the core of what is now the important Women's Library. Personal life In 1885, she married an aristocrat named Frederick Cavendish-Bentinck (1856‚Äì1948). Frederick, a son of the Rt. Hon. George Cavendish-Bentinck, inherited his father's debts when he died. His older brother was William George Cavendish- Bentinck, British Member of Parliament who married the American heiress, Elizabeth Livingston (who had two girls but no boys). Together, Ruth and Frederick were the parents of four surviving children, including: * Ferdinand Cavendish-Bentinck, 8th Duke of Portland (1888‚Äì1980), who served as Private Secretary to Governor of Uganda from 1925 to 1927 and as Speaker of Kenyan Legislative Council. * Lucy Joan Cavendish-Bentinck (1889‚Äì1954), who married Sir Reginald Hervey Hoare, the British Envoy to Persia from 1931 to 1934. * Victor Cavendish-Bentinck, 9th Duke of Portland (1897‚Äì1990), who served as Assistant Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office in 1944 and as the British Ambassador to Poland from 1945 to 1947. * Venetia Barbara Cavendish-Bentinck (b. 1902), named after Frederick's sister, Venetia James (n√©e Cavendish- Bentinck), wife of racehorse owner and breeder John Arthur James.

At the age of 18 he emigrated to the United States to live with relatives in Medford, Massachusetts. He worked as a housepainter and went to night school to learn English. While taking an art class at night school, a teacher noticed Bengtz's talent and suggested he apply to an art school. Bengtz enrolled at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts (the \\"museum school\\") in 1928. He won the school's top scholarship, the Paige Traveling Scholarship, which allowed him to study in Europe for two years. He graduated in 1933.  Career  Bengtz taught at the museum school from 1934 to 1969. During the 1940s he taught all four years of drawing, as well as anatomy and lithography, while Karl Zerbe taught all four years of painting. He founded the Graphics Department in 1939 and became head of the Drawing and Graphic Arts Department in 1941. During World War II he worked as a technical illustrator for the Raytheon Company.

In 1968 he created a stained glass window for St. Olaf's Church, a 13th-century church in his ancestral home of Jomala; the window depicts Christ and St. Olaf, patron saint of the √Öland Islands.  Later years  After retiring from the museum school, Bengtz worked with the Carl A. Weyerhaeuser family to plan and launch the Art Complex Museum in Duxbury, Massachusetts. He worked with the architect on the building plan, and became the museum's first director in 1971. He also taught art classes at Boston University. Bengtz died at his home in Duxbury, Massachusetts, on November 10, 1973. His works are included in the permanent collections of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the Smithsonian Institution, the Fogg Museum, the Cincinnati Art Museum, and other museums and private collectors. His papers are on file with the Boston Public Library. The Art Complex Museum named its Bengtz Gallery in his honor, and published a collection of his lithographs in 1978. In 2007, the centennial of his birth was marked in Finland with an exhibition at the √ñnningebymuseet, and in 2010 the Finnish government issued a postage stamp featuring a detail from the stained glass window he created for St. Olaf's Church.

Hull 802 will be the second of two Scottish ferries capable of operating on either marine diesel oil or liquefied natural gas (LNG), with benefits of a marked reduction in carbon dioxide, sulphur and nitrous oxide emissions. The first steel for both ships was cut on 7 April 2016. The first ship, was launched on 21 November 2017 by the First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. However, this launch has been widely criticised as the ships were so far behind schedule that the ship had painted on black boxes for windows and is still docked just a few metres away from where she was launched, with little progress being made. Service Hull 802 was expected to be launched in 2018, and to enter service on the Uig Triangle the following year. Following delays to both ships and nationalisation of the shipyard, the second ferry is estimated to be delivered to CMAL in summer 2022.

The material for the project was being gathered for over two years from 1998 to 2000. The album was promoted with a single \\"Ja to ja\\", released on November 1, 2000. The album peaked at number 2 on the Polish OLiS chart, almost 12 years after its original release. Kinematografia received Fryderyk award in \\"Best hip-hop album\\" category. T-Mobile Music placed the track \\"Chwile ulotne\\" on the list of \\"120 most important Polish hip-hop songs\\". 8 days after the album was released Magik committed suicide by jumping out of the window of his apartment situated on the ninth floor of the building, in Katowice. His death was extensively commented on media and in hip-hop community. Kinematografia is considered to be one of the most important album in Polish hip-hop history. As of 2012 the album has sold 65,000 copies in Poland.  Background  After Magik's departure from Kaliber 44, and Rahim's departure from 3xKlan, Fokus wanted to found a new group so he asked both of them to join him. On October 1998, the group started to work on first songs for their new album. Those songs were: \\"Priorytety\\", \\"Ja to ja\\", and \\"Gdyby...\\". In the same year, DJ Bambus became the group official DJ, and Sot was a beatboxer. The group sent their demo tracks to a few record labels and initially the only record label that was interested in releasing their album was RRX, in which Paktofonika signed a contract. Shortly after that, the deal was broken due to the misunderstanding between the label and the group. On spring 2000, the group signed a deal with Gigant Records. Rahim commented that fact later stating: Kinematografia was finally released on December 18, 2000. 8 days later, on December 26, 2000, Magik committed suicide by jumping out of the window from his apartment. On September 21, 2012, the biographical movie about Paktofonika titled Jeste≈õ Bogiem was released and its popularity caused that Rahim and Fokus decided to repress the album. On December 9, 2012, almost twelve years since its release, the album peaked at number 2 on Polish OLiS chart.  Reception and accolades  Upon its release, Kinematografia received favorable reviews from most music critics. Borys Dejnarowicz of Porcys, an independent Polish music portal, rated that album on 7.5 out of 10 points stating that he \\"doesn't know if there has been created something like that before.

Thornycroft & Company to build a yacht to his specifications. The yacht was built at Thornycroft's yard at Woolston, Southampton. She was completed in 1938 and christened MY Shemara. MY Shemara was requisitioned by the Royal Navy at the start of the Second World War in 1939 and used as a training vessel for anti-submarine warfare. (See also Madiz, a similar super yacht that saw RN Service in WWII). It was during a training exercise with HMS Shemara that the submarine HMS Untamed was lost with all her crew. Shemara left Royal Navy service in 1946. Once returned to Docker's ownership, the Shemara became known for lavish parties with guests including King Farouk of Egypt. However in 1965, Docker put her on the market for ¬£600,000, and she was eventually sold to the property developer Harry Hyams for ¬£290,000. Hyams used the Shemara on a number of Mediterranean cruises, but she was largely left laid up in Lowestoft, and was not regularly used between the 1980s and 2010. In 2010 Shemara was bought by businessman Charles Dunstone, and a project was started to return her to her former glory. In order to achieve this, a new company, Shemara Refit LLP, was created. The refit was completed in 2014, and the yacht now has a contemporary interior while retaining many of her historic original features, including as much of her original steel and teak as possible. The ship's machinery was completely replaced with a new Rolls-Royce diesel-electric system comprising five main generators providing power for two electrically driven azimuthing pods and a bow thruster.

Torres (January 13, 1932 ‚Äì August 25, 2000) was an American professional wrestler. Primarily a babyface throughout his career, he was a part of 'The Famous Torres Brothers' with Alberto & Enrique Torres and was a major star in the 1950s and 60s as a both a tag team and singles competitor. He wrestled primarily within the National Wrestling Alliance, where he was a multi-time NWA World Tag Team Champion and NWA World Junior Heavyweight Champion and also wrestled in the American Wrestling Association (where he held the AWA Midwest Heavyweight Championship) and Worldwide Wrestling Associates. Early life Before entering professional wrestling, Ram√≥n Torres' older brother Enrique was already a World Heavyweight Champion and established star in the world of wrestling. Ram√≥n and his brother Alberto had aspirations of stardom themselves and wanted Enrique to help them break into the business. Enrique agreed to help them, with the condition that they learn the amateur style first and become competent shoot wrestlers. \\"I told both of them to join a wrestling team. They joined a wrestling team in San Francisco, at the YMCA and other places. Join a wrestling team and learn how to wrestle\\" Enrique stated. After competing as amateurs, Enrique agreed to them becoming pros. Professional wrestling career Ram√≥n began his career in his native California and did not take long to establish himself in the territory. He captured the NWA Pacific Coast Tag Team Championship with Enrique on September 19, 1953 in San Francisco. In an era before the likes of Gorgeous George the Torres trio stood out for their charisma and mat skills. Ram√≥n also held the NWA World Tag Team Championship with Tex McKenzie when the duo defeated Mike and Ben Sharpe on September 21, 1957. Ram√≥n was to become a major fan favourite throughout the California territories, winning the NWA Pacific Coast Heavyweight Championship on five occasions. Ram√≥n and his brothers became the top babyface team in numerous territories throughout the NWA, including Florida, where they had noted rivalries with the Von Brauners and Keomuka & Matsuda. The brothers continued to travel throughout North America, winning tag team gold from the Georgia and Tri-State territories in the American South to the Stampede Wrestling territory in Calgary. On September 10, 1971, Ram√≥n defeated Roger Kirby to capture the NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship in Monroe, Louisiana. As was customary for the world champions of the NWA, Torres defended the title in various territories as a travelling champion, eventually losing the title in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. That same year, he also competed in the American Wrestling Association, winning the AWA Midwest Heavyweight Championship in August, 1971.

He also holds an appointment as Professor of Management and Organizations at the University of Michigan Ross School of Business. His research has focused on the political activity of the U.S. corporate elite over the 20th and 21st centuries. He was influential in the development of social network analysis, and has published research in the fields of organizational theory, economic sociology, and political sociology. Career Mizruchi received his A.B. from Washington University in St. Louis in 1975 and his M.A. and PhD from the State University of New York at Stony Brook in 1980, both in sociology. From 1980 to 1987 he was a statistical consultant in the computing center of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, becoming an Assistant Professor of Psychiatry (biostatistics). In 1987 he moved to Columbia University, first as Assistant and then as Associate Professor of Sociology. In 1991 he moved to the University of Michigan as Professor of Sociology, with a courtesy appointment as Professor of Business Administration. He was named Barger Family Professor in 2012 and Robert Cooley Angell Collegiate Professor of Sociology in 2014.  Academic work  Mizruchi's work has centered on, first, the changing ownership and control of the largest U.S. corporations, and, second, corporate political action. His key theoretical work has been explaining the sources of unity and conflict among U.S. big business. When do firms, modeled as independent agents in most social scientific analysis, collaborate to achieve common goals? This line of research addresses a long- standing question about the nature of the corporation: who controls the corporation when ownership is widely dispersed among shareholders? Can managers act in their own interest, and what forces prevent them from doing so? To address these questions, Mizruchi has empirically focused on relationships between firms arising from corporate board relationships. Many corporate board members serve on more than one corporate board, creating Interlocking directorates that allow for the diffusion of ideas; Mizruchi has investigated how this interlock network has evolved, and the role that it plays in coordinating action. Not all interlocks, however, are created equal. He shows that through the twentieth century, representatives from financial institutions played a central role in the interlock network. Through these network ties, banks were able to monitor firms' behavior, with significant financial consequences. However, his later work demonstrated recent declines in the centrality of banks. This thesis is expanded in his latest book, which highlights the growing fracturing of the U.S. corporate elite over the past forty years, and suggests broad consequences for the governance of the U.S. economy.

Background The long-standing national Militia of the United Kingdom was revived by the Militia Act of 1852, enacted during a period of international tension. As before, units were raised and administered on a county basis, and filled by voluntary enlistment (although conscription by means of the Militia Ballot might be used if the counties failed to meet their quotas). Training was for 56 days on enlistment, then for 21‚Äì28 days per year, during which the men received full army pay. Under the Act, Militia units could be embodied by Royal Proclamation for full-time home defence service in three circumstances:Litchfield, pp. 1‚Äì7.Dunlop, pp. 42‚Äì5.Grierson, pp. 27‚Äì8.Spiers, Army & Society, pp. 91‚Äì2. * 1. 'Whenever a state of war exists between Her Majesty and any foreign power'. * 2. 'In all cases of invasion or upon imminent danger thereof'. * 3. 'In all cases of rebellion or insurrection'. The 1852 Act introduced Artillery Militia units in addition to the traditional infantry regiments. Their role was to man coastal defences and fortifications, relieving the Royal Artillery (RA) for active service. History The Royal Sussex Militia Artillery was raised in April 1853 by transferring 206 volunteers from the Royal Sussex Light Infantry Militia. The first commandant was Lieutenant-Colonel George Kirwan Carr Lloyd, a former Captain in the Rifle Brigade. The Colonel-in-Chief was Charles Gordon-Lennox, 5th Duke of Richmond KG, who had been Colonel of the Royal Sussex Militia since 1819. Several of the other early officers were retired from the British or East India Company's armies, or prominent personages in the county, including Captains Sir James Sibbald David Scott, 3rd Baronet, and the Hon. William E. Sackville-West, son of Earl De La Warr. The unit's Major was William Augustus St Clair, formerly of the Bombay Horse Artillery, who succeeded at Lt-Col Commandant on 2 May 1861.Litchfield, pp. 134‚Äì6.Hart's Army List, 1855.Army List, various dates.Burke's, 'De La Warr', 'Richmond'.'The St Clair Family of Dorman's Land' at RH7. The new corps' headquarters was established at Lewes, the county town of East Sussex, until November 1883 when it moved to Eastbourne. The unit consisted of five batteries.Litchfield, Appendix 5. The Artillery Militia was reorganised into 11 divisions of garrison artillery in 1882, and the Sussex unit became the 3rd Brigade, Cinque Ports Division, RA. When the Cinque Ports Division was abolished in 1889 the title was altered to Sussex Artillery (Eastern Division) RA.Spiers, Late Victorian Army, pp. 63‚Äì4. From 1902 most units of the Militia artillery formally became part of the Royal Garrison Artillery, the Eastbourne unit taking the title of Sussex RGA (M). Embodiments The unit was embodied for home defence twice: * Crimean War: 1 February 1855 to 16 June 1856 * Second Boer War: 1 May to 17 October 1900 Disbandment After the Boer War, the future of the Militia was called into question. There were moves to reform the Auxiliary Forces (Militia, Yeomanry and Volunteers) to take their place in the six Army Corps proposed by St John Brodrick as Secretary of State for War. Some batteries of Militia Artillery were to be converted to field artillery. However, little of Brodrick's scheme was carried out.Dunlop, pp. 131‚Äì40, 158-62.Spiers, Army & Society, pp. 243‚Äì2, 254. Under the sweeping Haldane Reforms of 1908, the Militia was replaced by the Special Reserve, a semi-professional force whose role was to provide reinforcement drafts for Regular units serving overseas in wartime. Although the majority of the officers and men of the Sussex RGA (M) accepted transfer to the Special Reserve Royal Field Artillery, all these units were disbanded in March 1909.Dunlop, pp. 270‚Äì2.Spiers, Army & Society, pp. 275‚Äì7.Litchfield, Appendix 8. Uniform and insignia In 1854 the officers of the Royal Sussex Militia Artillery wore a black leather helmet carrying a plate bearing the star of the Order of the Garter with the cross of St George picked out in red with crossed gilt cannons below. A scroll beneath was inscribed 'ROYAL SUSSEX MILITIA'. After 1882 the officers wore the standard gilt Cinque Ports Division helmet plate. Equipment An engraved print of June 1854 shows the Royal Sussex Militia Artillery at gun practice at Southover, Lewes. The guns shown include two 32-pounder muzzle-loaders on traversing carriages. The wooden gun shed from which they are shooting has mock fortress embrasures facing the firing range over the South Downs. Honorary Colonels The following served as Colonel of the unit: * Charles Gordon-Lennox, 5th Duke of Richmond KG, appointed Colonel-in-Chief on the unit's formation. * Sir James Hayes Sadler, KCMG, FRGS, an officer of the unit from 1854 to 1882, was appointed Honorary Colonel on 5 August 1882 and held the post until its disbandment.Hart's Army List 1899.

She was appointed in 2014 and her six-year term ended on 30 April 2020. Biography She graduated from the University of Warsaw with a law degree in 1975, and obtained a doctorate degree in 1981. She became a professor for the University of Warsaw in 1992, served as Vice-Rector of the University in 2005, and became head of the Law Department in 2008. Politically, Gersdorf was part of the Solidarity movement in the 1980s, and worked in the Supreme Court Office of Jurisprudence and the Office of Supreme Court Analysis in the 1990s. In 1989, after the new post-communist government took over, she was appointed to the Social Conciliation Commission, which helped to get political prisoners back in the workforce. She served as a legal advisor to the Supreme Court, and in 2008 was nominated to be a Judge. She served in that role for six years when she was nominated to be the First President of the Supreme Court, succeeding Stanis≈Çaw DƒÖbrowski, who had died earlier in 2014, and Lech Krzysztof Paprzycki, who was an acting First President. After becoming First President of the Supreme Court, in 2017 the Law and Justice party had planned to change the court's structure, including the party nominating its own justices rather than having judges nominate them. In an open letter to colleagues, Gersdorf spoke out against this push, stating that \\"the courts are easily turned into a plaything in the hands of politicians\\" and urging fellow judges to preserve the independence of the judiciary. The law was later passed in both legislative chambers but was vetoed by President Andrzej Duda. The Law and Justice party continued to seek significant changes to the court's system; one measure was to enact mandatory retirement starting on 4 July 2018, which would force Gersdorf and 26 other judges out of the 72 judges in the court to retire, despite the court justices having previously voted in favor of allowing themselves to continue to run until the end of their term. Gersdorf and several of her colleagues are fighting this measure. Backed by public protests, Gersdorf has continued to show up for work, saying that the government is attempting \\"a purge of the Supreme Court conducted under the guise of retirement reform\\" and noting that under the Constitution of Poland, her term continues through 2020.Poland's top judge Gersdorf defies retirement law, BBC News (July 4, 2018). The European Commission filed an infringement procedure against the Polish government, stating that the law undermines judicial independence and therefore was a breach of the Treaty on European Union and Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which protect the rule of law.Rule of Law: Commission launches infringement procedure to protect the independence of the Polish Supreme Court, European Commission, Brussels, 2 July 2018.

It was considered a subspecies of the red-fronted gazelle (E. rufifrons) or conspecific with Thomson's gazelle (E. thomsonii) and Mongalla gazelle (E. albonotata) by some authors in the past. This small gazelle stands nearly at the shoulder and weighs between . The coat is dark reddish brown with a dark reddish stripe on the flanks, except for the underparts and the rump which are white. Horns, present in both sexes, measure in length. Little is known about the ecology and behaviour of Heuglin's gazelles; they typically remain solitary or form groups of two to four. Herbivores, these gazelles possibly browse as well as graze. Gestation lasts nearly six months, after which probably a single calf is born. Heuglin's gazelles inhabit open areas such as steppes, dry grasslands and thorn bushlands up to an elevation of . Habitat loss and illegal hunting for meat are major threats to the survival of these gazelles. Populations might have fallen by 20% in roughly nine years after 2008; as of 2016, only 2,500 to 3,500 individuals remain in small fragmented groups, with fewer than 2,500 adults. Heuglin's gazelle is classified as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. Taxonomy German explorer and ornithologist Theodor von Heuglin first described Heuglin's gazelle in 1863. He based his description on a specimen from the plains close to Ain-Saba in Bogosland in Abyssinia (the Ethiopian Empire). This species has been considered a subspecies of the red-fronted gazelle (Eudorcas rufifrons) or conspecific with Thomson's gazelle (E. thomsonii) and Mongalla gazelle (E. albonotata) by some authors. In 2013, biologist Colin Groves considered Heuglin's gazelle an independent species, and this has subsequently been followed by many authors. Characteristics This species is notably smaller than other gazelles, shows significantly lesser sexual dimorphism and has shorter and thinner horns (present in both sexes). The head-and-body length is between , and the shoulder height is nearly . Males weigh between , while the weight of females varies from . The coat is dark reddish brown, except for the underparts and the rump which are white. There is a dark reddish stripe on the flanks. The face is darker in the middle, and there are white circles around the eyes. The horns measure in males and in females, and turn inward at the tips. They are spaced apart at the base, and the tips are separated by . Females have more slender and straighter horns than do males. The tail measures and is rufous at the base, turning black towards the end. It is smaller and more rufous than the red-fronted gazelle, the nose is unmarked. Dorcas gazelle, sympatric with Heuglin's gazelle in some areas, has a lighter reddish stripe. The larger and paler Soemmerring's gazelle shares its range with Heuglin's gazelle in southwestern Eritrea, and has short, heavy horns curved backward with tips pointing inward, a whiter rump and short white hairs on the tail. Ecology and behaviour Heuglin's gazelles lead solitary lives or form groups of two to four. They scrape the ground to create resting sites under shrubs or large trees, such as the Egyptian balsam (Balanites aegyptiaca) in savannahs and Vachellia nubica in shrublands, during the hottest period of the day. Groups of gazelles may rest in shallower sites for long periods of time, as suggested by the increasing dung piles in these areas. Little is known of territorial behaviour in the wild; captive males form dung heaps close to the fences of their enclosures, smelling and scratching the ground nearby followed by excretion. Preorbital glands are also used for marking. Herbivores, they possibly browse as well as graze. Though Heuglin's gazelles can survive for long periods without water, they are more water-dependent than other gazelles in their range. Copulation lasts a few seconds; the male stands upright on the hindfeet and mounts the female. Gestation lasts 184 to 189 days, after which probably a single calf is born; most births take place in the wet season. Jackals may prey on young; hyaenas may also be potential predators. Little else is known about the ecology and behaviour of these gazelles. Distribution and habitat The range is east of the Nile River and patchy, bounded by the southern Red Sea Hills in Sudan and mountainous terrain in northwestern Ethiopia and western Eritrea. Heuglin's gazelles inhabit open areas such as steppes, dry grasslands and thorn bushlands up to an elevation of . Little is known about the populations and their status. Numbers have plummeted in Eritrea; in 2019 the Forestry and Wild Life Authority of Eritrea declared that Heuglin's gazelle had been sighted again in the country in the Dige sub-zone (Gash-Barka Region). The gazelle was reportedly seen last during the time of the Italian colonial rule in Eritrea (19th to 20th centuries). Threats and conservation The IUCN Red List classifies Heuglin's gazelle as Endangered. According to the IUCN, the numbers might have fallen by as much as 20% in roughly nine years after 2008. As of 2016, only 2,500 to 3,500 individuals remain in small fragmented groups, with fewer than 2,500 adults. The gazelle is suffering from severe habitat loss due to overgrazing, deforestation, agricultural expansion and droughts. Illegal hunting for meat is another major threat. Heuglin's gazelle occurs in several protected areas: Gash-Setit in Eritrea, Kafta Sheraro National Park (and probably Alatash National Park) in Ethiopia, and Dinder National Park in Sudan. Antelope conservationist Rod East noted that populations in the Dinder National Park are threatened by hunting particularly in the wet season when the animals often cross the border of the park. Moreover, in the dry season camel and goat herders often trespass the area and let their animals graze on the vegetation, depriving Heuglin's gazelles of food and resting sites.

Under Jena's tenure as health minister, Odisha has become the first State in the country to have formulated the Universal Eye Health Programme (UEHP). In a first-of-its-kind health programme, the state aims at providing comprehensive, accessible, affordable and equitable eye care to people of all age groups. The Rs. 600 crore scheme will provide five lakh spectacles to students and 10 lakh cataract patients will be operated free of cost. Glaucoma patients will also be offered free treatment. In June 2017, the Odisha state government took initiative to completely sponsor the expenses for separating Craniopagus twins Jaga-Balia. The state health department, in co-ordination with AIIMS and doctors from across the globe, ensured that the operation (successful in very rare cases) was a complete success. The surgery received major media attention and was considered as a medical marvel. In 19 December 2017, Odisha government launched various pro people health schemes such as (1) NIDAAN for all types of essential diagnostic services provided free of cost to all categories of patients in all public health facilities as per its level from Sub-Centers to Medical Colleges and Hospitals. Annually over 1.50 crores patients requiring diagnostic services at public health facilities are being benefited. (2) SAHAY for free Dialysis Services. Annually about 50 thousand patients are being benefited. (3) AMA CLINIC for Healthcare services in Urban clinics including fixed day specialists services in Obstetrics and Gynecology, Pediatrics, Medicine and Geriatrics, Eye-care, Physiotherapy and Psychiatric. Urban population over 45 lakhs in 27 towns will be benefited under the scheme. (4) ANMOL to equip the ANMs with the latest technology, the government decided to provide the ANMOL tablet computers to all the ANMs. It will help in providing real-time service to the beneficiaries, especially pregnant women, mothers and newborns in the state. In January 2018, Measles-Rubella (MR) vaccine was introduced in the state immunisation programme for the first time. The vaccination drive covered about 1.13 crore children across Odisha between the ages of nine months and 15 years. The 5-week long campaign involved 70,367 schools, 47,689 ASHAs, 71,129 Anganwadi workers, 8665 health workers and officials of state government departments and 37,160 outreach vaccination sessions. On 26 February 2018 Government of Odisha launched Khushi scheme (meaning \\"Happiness\\" in Odia) to provide free sanitary pads to girl students in Odisha. It was launched by the Chief Minister of Odisha Naveen Patnaik. The Government of Odisha will spend 70 Crore Indian rupees annually for running this program in the state. On 15 August 2018, Biju Swastya Kalyan Yojana was launched by Chief Minister of Odisha Naveen Patnaik. Under this scheme around 70 lakhs families will get free health services in all state government health care facilities starting from Sub center level up to district headquarter hospital level. A budget of 250 crore was sanctioned by the state government. Annual health coverage of Rs 5 lakhs per family and 7 lakhs per women members of the family will be provided under this scheme at any hospital of India.https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/naveen- patnaik-launches-health-scheme-in-rain-hit-independence-day- programme/articleshow/65411203.cms The minister has earned himself a fiery reputation for conducting surprise visits to hospitals and health centres across the state to check the level of preparedness among the staff and authorities.

The church's origins are medieval, though the present building was extensively remodeled during the Victorian and Edwardian years. Early history Saint Isan and his companion Saint Edeyrn are believed to have been active in the area in the 6th century, after having been sent by St Teilo to establish religious settlements. Isan reached what is now Llanishen in 535 or 537 AD, and established a 'llan' (enclosure) at the site. This would have consisted of a primitive structure which served as both a church and as accommodation for visitors. The llan would have also included a farming plots and would have been surrounded by a palisade. Isan died in 537 AD, so his time in the district would have been fleeting, but had significant effect. As the Celtic church was still using Latin as its language, Isan also used the name Dionysius. As local people did not use or understand Latin, this name was corrupted to Dennis or Denys, and was later applied to St Denys' Church in Lisvane.An associate of Isan's was St Edeyrn, from whom the name Llanedeyrn is derived, and who also has a church dedicated to him in Llanedeyrn. The first mention of a proper church at the location dates from the 12th century, at which time it was a chapel of ease to St Mary's Church in what was then the separate and fairly distant town of Cardiff, which would not absorb Llanishen until the late 19th century. The church consisted of a nave, chancel, a tower and a porch. A sanctuary, chancel and north and south windows were added in the 14th century. The tower was added in the 15th century. It, together with the medieval nave, survive, along with a small portion of the south chancel wall which is thought to be the oldest surviving part of the church. Later extensions and further history Interior looking east towards the chancel The first enlargement occurred in 1854 when Prichard and Seddon added a north aisle and an arcade. After the opening of the Rhymney Railway, Llanishen's population began to grow as the village began to transform into a suburb. The 1854 aisle was demolished and replaced by H.D. Blessley in 1907-8, a new nave and chancel also being added, together with a second (south) arcade which matched the style of the 1854 arcade. A vestry was added in 1927. The church gained listed status in 1952. In 1993, the Llanishen Local History Society planted a tree at the site of St Isan's original llan. St Faith's Church, Llanishen The sister church of St Isan's is St Faith's on Morris Avenue. It was built in the 1960s to serve the area's growing population of the postwar years.

She was the first female president of the Constitutional Court (formerly known as the Court of Arbitration). She took part in founding a movement called the \\"Femmes Pr√©voyantes Socialistes\\". She was one of the first women to pursue a political career that took her to the highest levels. The main idea for which she fought her whole life was the equality and emancipation of man and woman. Youth Irene P√©try grew up with five brothers in a working-class family. Her parents were fervent members of the Belgian Workers Party, ancestor of the Parti Socialiste. She was involved in politics from an early age, and participated in local meetings of this party. Irene was a good student and managed to finish her economics degree at the Royal Athenaeum of Waremme in 1942. She was forced to interrupt her studies because of World War II and for lack of money. As a substitute for university education she attended socialist popular education circles, took language courses and participated in conferences. Femmes Pr√©voyantes Socialistes (FPS)  Ir√®ne P√©try began work as a private employee in a company located in Li√®ge. Later, after the war, she joined the Socialist Mutuality in her hometown of Waremme, where she developed a section called \\"Femmes Pr√©voyantes Socialistes\\" (Forward-looking Socialist Women). This group was located at the Joseph Wauters Clinic, also in Waremme. Today it is a medical analysis laboratory. The Femmes Pr√©voyantes Socialistes (FPS) movement has evolved greatly since the time when Irene P√©try inaugurated it. Today, this movement prioritizes the equality of men and women (fighting wage inequality and the issue of part-time work). The FPS movement also militates for the rights of citizens (voluntary termination of pregnancy, fight against insecurity) while conducting prevention campaigns with the aim of raising citizens' awareness about the fight against domestic violence, prevention of bulimia and anorexia, and screening for breast cancer. In this way, the movement fights for an egalitarian society with specific political demands. After the establishment of the FPS movement, Irene P√©try was its National Secretary for French-speakers for nearly 30 years (1953 to 1982). At the same time, she had other duties. She was the editor-in-chief of a monthly magazine published called La Femme Pr√©voyante, and she was one of the presenters of the television program \\"La pens√©e socialiste\\" (Socialist Thought) at RTBF. Irene P√©try's political commitment did not stop with the FPS movement. She also agitated for women's rights. As early as the 1950s, she fought for economic and legal gender equality. Later, in the 1960s, she emphasized the development and growth of more and more family planning centers. She continued to advance, and in the 1970s militated for decriminalizing abortion prior to legalizing it. However she chose to take a step back when faced with \\"extremist\\" feminist groups that emerged in the 1970s. Political career  From 1959 to 1964 Ir√®ne P√©try was a communal councilor in Uccle. In 1966, she became vice-president and then president of the International Council of Women of the Socialist International. Subsequently, she was appointed Vice President of the Socialist International. The Socialist International Women is the international organization of women's organizations of socialist, social democratic and labor parties affiliated to the Socialist International. Meanwhile, in the late sixties, Irene found herself involved in government, without being a member of parliament. In the early seventies, she joined the office of the Socialist Party. At the beginning of 1973 she became the Secretary of State for Development Cooperation. She performed this function in the Leburton-Tindemans-De Clercq government for a period of 10 months. She also became deputy to the Federal Public Service Foreign Affairs Minister at the time, Renaat Van Elslande, a Belgian politician of the Flemish Social Christian Party (Christen- Democratisch en Vlaams). Renaat Van Elslande served as Minister for Foreign Affairs from 1973 to 1977. Irene was thus the first socialist woman to hold a ministerial office in Belgium. Ir√®ne then ran for election for Li√®ge (where she resided at the time) in the March 1974 legislative elections, where she was elected as a deputy. In October 1976, following the fusion of the Belgian municipalities, she became communal councilor at Sprimont, for a period of 7 years (from 1977 to 1984). A few months later, she was elected to the Senate. The president of the Senate at that time was Pierre Harmel from the PSC (Centre d√©mocrate humaniste) between 1973 and 1977. Ir√®ne P√©try had some responsibility for the institutional evolution of the state, since she was a directly elected senator. She was rapporteur of the Senate Committee that was defining new structures that would ultimately be adopted by the Belgian state. In August 1976 she gave her voice to the majority which gave birth, among other things, to the political structure of Wallonia. From 15 October 1976, she participated in the meetings that inaugurated the Walloon Regional Council. Among the hundred or so members of this assembly, she was one of eight women parliamentarians from Wallonia. During the same period, in 1978 she created a political association called \\"Socialist Tribunes\\" with Ernest Glinne and Jacques Yerna. This is a left-leaning Walloon association. Ir√®ne P√©try was also a member of the French Community of Belgium from 1974. In 1980 she became the seventh president of the Cultural Council of the French Community when she succeeded L√©on Hurez. She was the first woman to be president. She was president until October 1982. She was reelected as senator in 1981, holding office until September 1984, this time for Namur. Finally, Irene P√©try became a judge at the Court of Arbitration as early as the 1980s. Belgium, which was at that time unitary, took the path towards federalism in 1970. The Court of Arbitration was created after the constitutional revision of 1980, renamed from 7 May 2007 the Constitutional Court. It was born in September 1984 and Ir√®ne P√©try was designated by the Socialist Party to represent it. After this, she abandoned her various political mandates to devote herself fully to her new task. She took over from Jean Sarot as President of the French Court of Arbitration from 19 February 1991. She also held the general presidency until 1992. Irene P√©try was appointed Minister of State in May 1992. Although this title does not give any particular rights, it recognizes great services rendered to the country and the status of a \\"wise person\\". At the end of a political career it is more than a reward, it is a consecration. On June 20, 1992, she chose to end her activities at the Court of Arbitration. She was then 70 years old. Some writings Ir√®ne P√©try wrote two articles for the feminist periodical Les Cahiers du Grif. In 1974 it published an issue with the theme \\"The social insecurity of women\\" where she wrote Inflation and the impossibility of predicting and Housing and the impossibility of settling.

History In 1955, the Santa Fe reduced its passenger operations on the Peavine route to a single daily train in either direction. Officially designated as train 42 (northbound) and train 47 (southbound), the service became known unofficially as the Hassayampa Flyer or the Hassayampa Chief, after the nearby Hassayampa River. The northern terminus was originally Ash Fork, to connect passengers from Phoenix with intercontinental trains between Chicago and the West Coast on the Southern Transcon main line. In 1960, the Santa Fe re-routed the Southern Transcon to avoid the sharp curves and steep gradients between Williams and Ash Fork. The new 44 mile stretch of railroad took the main line out of the downtown depots in both towns, with a freshly-constructed station constructed at Williams Junction serving as the new northern terminus for the Hassayampa Flyer. The Santa Fe had already won planning approval for a further amendment to the route of the Peavine, creating a new cutoff that bypassed a tortuous section of track between Prescott and Skull Valley. Works began in 1961 and were completed the following year, leaving Prescott without any direct passenger services. A branch line to the town remained, but it was abandoned before the end of 1962. With passenger numbers on the route dwindling, through Pullman cars from Chicago to Phoenix were terminated in October 1967 and later that year the Santa Fe withdrew the Hassayampa Flyer from service. The Interstate Commerce Commission, the railroad regulatory body, ordered the train reinstated, but only a handful of passengers continued to use it. In April 1969, it was permanently removed from the timetable.Schweiterman. p. 10.

Early life  Allama Khadim Hussain Rizvi was born in 1966 in the Pindi Gheb area of Attock District, Punjab. His brother, Ameer Hussain, is a retired Junior Commissioned Officer (JCO) from Pakistan Army. He started hafiz class in Jhelum. Further, he took admission in Jamia Nizamia, Lahore.

Retrieved 8 September 2019. He delivered Friday sermons at Lahore's Pir Makki Masjid while in the Punjab Auqaf and Religious Affairs Department. He has been confined to a wheelchair since 2009 ever since an accident near Gujranwala as the driver of his vehicle fell asleep while driving from Rawalpindi to Lahore. In 2015, he founded a political party called Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), a political front for Tehreek Labbaik Ya Rasool Allah (TLYP). TLP came into existence after the hanging of Mumtaz Qadri, who assassinated Salmaan Taseer, the Governor of Punjab, for opposing the blasphemy laws and subsequently rose to fame. During the assassination of the Governor, Rizvi was serving as an auqaf official in the Punjab government. Rizvi had justified the assassination on the pretext that Taseer had termed the blasphemy law as a \\"black law\\". He was served warning notices to cease and desist from spreading his views in favour of blasphemy laws but his refusal to do so led to his removal from public service. After his removal, Rizvi had more opportunity to preach his views. He travelled across the country to build support for Section 295-C of the Pakistan Penal Code, which deals with blasphemy committed against Prophet Muhammad. He also spoke out for the release of Mumtaz Qadri; his persistent advocacy earned him the nickname of \\"blasphemy activist\\" in religious circles.  Controversies  = 2017 Faizabad sit-in = On 6 November 2017, Rizvi organized a long march from Lahore to Islamabad to press for the resignation of the Law Minister Mr. Zahid Hamid belongs to PML(N) regarding an alleged ill-motive change and favour Ahmadi Muslims, in bill of \\"2017 Election of Pakistan\\". Rizvi soon began receiving support from public, other religious political parties and other segments of society, making way for mushroom growth of protests nationwide. The general public took the same demand of resignation of the Law Minister to the streets Thereafter, total shutdown began, and the government ultimately responded with a forced shutdown of all news channels, followed by blocking social media networks, to contain the situation and the flow of information. This created mayhem and confusion in the cities of Karachi, Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Lahore along with some others in Punjab. Finally, by late evening the army chief intervened and asked \\"both sides\\" to show restraint. = 2018 Asia Bibi protests= On 31 October 2018, after eight years of detention and conviction by all the lower courts, a Pakistani Christian woman, Asia Bibi, who was accused of blasphemy, was found innocent in a landmark Supreme Court verdict. The final judgment said that one of Bibi's accusers violated the Ashtiname of Muhammad, a \\"covenant made by Prophet Muhammad with Christians in the seventh century but still valid today\\". Justice Asif Saeed Khosa ruled that the two women who made accusations against Asia Bibi \\"had no regard for the truth\\" and that the claim that she blasphemed Prophet Muhammad in public was a \\"concoction incarnate\\". The Supreme Court of Pakistan's ruling cited \\"material contradictions and inconsistent statements of the witnesses\\" that \\"cast a shadow of doubt on the prosecution's version of facts.\\" This prompted the TLP, under the leadership of Rizvi to initiate demonstrations in Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar and Multan. Clashes with police were reported. A leader of TLP, Muhammad Afzal Qadri, said all three Supreme Court judges \\"deserve to be killed\\". The Red Zone in the capital, Islamabad, where the Supreme Court is located, was sealed off by the police. In public speeches, Rizvi demanded that Aasia should be subjected to the punishment for blasphemy under Pakistan's penal code. He was quoted saying, \\"Our sit-in will go on until the government accepts our demand\\" denying reports that the sit-in would soon be over. He would later be arrested on 23 November 2018 along with other TLP leaders and then subsequently released on bail in May 2019 = Murder of professors = In March 2019, a third year student at Bahawalpur's Government Sadiq Egerton College, Khateeb Hussain, stabbed associate professor Khalid Hameed in a fatal encounter. Khateeb Hussain was in contact with Zafar Gillani, a lawyer and senior member of the TLP prior to the murder, and obtained approval for the act over Whatsapp. The supposed motive for the killing was blasphemous and insulting rhetoric towards Islam, however, no evidence was provided for this allegation. In 2018, Sareer Ahmed, the principal of Islamia College in Charsadda, was murdered by a 17-year old student who he had reprimanded for missing a number of classes. The student accused the professor of engaging in \\"blasphemy\\" for reprimanding him for skipping class to attend rallies held by the TLP. Both students stated that they were inspired by Rizvi. = 2020 Zindagi Tamasha controversy = In 2020, Rizvi promoted protests on the release of the Pakistani film Zindagi Tamasha. He accused film-maker Sarmad Khoosat of blasphemy. The material he alleged to be blasphemous includes criticism of ulama and an alleged reference to bacha bazi. Pakistani author Mohammed Hanif, who had seen both the censored and uncensored versions of the film, denied that any criticism of ulama was contained in the movie. However, according to many, it targeted the majority community of Pakistan, having the potential to lead to massive and possibly destructive protests for which it was banned by the state. Supporters of Rizvi were quick to point out that suggesting criticism of ulama is blasphemous, may in itself constitute blasphemy as it implies ulama hold sacred or holy rank.

The protesters demanded the resignation of Minister for Law and Justice Zahid Hamid to \\"protect the identity of the country.\\" Their objective was achieved as a deal was struck with the government and the minister stepped down on 27 November 2017 culminating in an end to the peaceful protests that continued for 20 days without harm until, despite of all the warnings given out by various religious groups about the sensitivity of the matter, because of the violence and the disturbance caused by the protesters the government was forced to use force against the protestors. Demands They demanded that the government identify and punish those persons responsible behind the change of wording in the declaration of the prophethood of Muhammad in the election laws and the resignation of Law Minister Zahid Hamid over accusations of removing the clause.  Negotiations  The negotiations didn't start until after a week of protest as the oppositions and people started to condemn governments policy of ignoring the protesters. Several bilateral talks ended in failure as the protesters were steadfast on their demand of resignation of law minister. Some of the delegations that went on behalf of government also called the demands of the protesters to be just. =Issue behind protest= According to the government version, it was an oversight in the Election Bill 2017 (one of the forms, on the subject relating one‚Äôs belief in the finality of prophethood of Muhammad, substituting the phrase ‚ÄúI solemnly swear‚Äù with ‚ÄúI believe‚Äù). The National Assembly of Pakistan claimed it as a ‚Äúclerical error‚Äù and later restored the original clause in the Election Act related to the finality of the prophethood in an oath that was turned into a religious and political controversy. However, the government failed to satisfy the protesting clerics.  Internet blocking and media blackouts  On 25 November 2017, the NetBlocks internet shutdown observatory and Digital Rights Foundation identified mass-scale blocking of social media and content-sharing websites YouTube, Twitter and Facebook throughout Pakistan. Transmission of TV news channels were put off-air by PEMRA as a strategy of operation against sit-in protesters at Faizabad interchange, which immediately ignited as a countrywide demonstrations. Pakistan Broadcasters Association condemned the government‚Äôs unilateral shut down of news channels on 25 November 2017. However, transmission of news channels were restored by PEMRA in the afternoon of 26 November 2017 and the PTA was instructed to lift its ban over social media websites. Reactions On 25 November 2017, police launched an operation using tear gas and water canons to clear the area where Tehreek-e- Labaik protesters had camped out for the last 20 days as they have blocked the main routes into the capital of Islamabad, after the police, the government called the army to control the law and order situation in the federal capital (Islamabad). The protest took place in other parts of the country, including both rural and urban areas. The government faced strong reactions by general public and a large numbers of protestors blocked the national highways throughout the country. Police was withdrawn from most of cities to avoid clashes. This crackdown also sparked outraged against the ruling party and many mob attacks took place on homes of Members of PMLN causing them to flee from their homes. Many more protesters died during clashes in Karachi and outskirts of Lahore.Sit in's were held until the leadership at Faizabad asked them to disperse after the agreement. The crowds dispersed peacefully. Head of the Moon Sighting Council Mufti Muneeb ur Rehman strongly condemned the action of the government. Pakistani politician Imran Khan called for the protests to remain peaceful, while not explicitly supporting or opposing the goals of Tehreek-e-Labaik.

The overall design resembles a catamaran with two ship-like bodies encasing the four wheels, and a large, horizontal wing in between carrying the solar cells. This design minimizes frontal area to reduce aerodynamic drag while maximizing exposure of the solar cells to solar irradiation. The driver sits between the wheels on the right side under a curved cockpit glass and is protected by race-grade seat belts and a strong roll bar. With a carbon fiber outer hull, the car weights less than 200 kg. of high-efficiency silicon solar cells are powering the car and charging the buffer battery, employing maximum power point trackers (MPPTs) to maximize energy yield.

The restaurant is open only for dinner and has a chalkboard listing more expensive, nightly specials above the bar. All food is sourced within 60 miles of the downtown Sonoma restaurant. The salads may include burrata with Early Girl tomatoes and squash blossoms in the summer. In the fall, organic mixed greens with candied pecans and grapes, beet and grapefruit salad, or a tomato bread salad. Appetizers may include house-smoked trout crepes, crab cakes, or portobello mushroom and polenta.

Seafood is also on the nightly menu, which may include soy-sesame glazed halibut with whipped potatoes and braised kale or dayboat scallops. A pasta special is often on the menu, which may include housemade tagliarini with lamb meatballs in a sauce comprising picholine olives, feta and goat cheese, eggplant and roasted peppers. Other offerings include steak and quail. The dessert menu includes butterscotch pudding. The wine list comprises local California wines from Sonoma and Napa and French wine selections. Atmosphere Cafe La Haye is a small modern restaurant with 34 seats. It has large windows facing the street and mirrors on the walls to give the illusion of a larger space. Paintings by local artists, available for sale, decorate the walls. A small bar, with four bar seats, overlooks the open air kitchen. Gropman is at the restaurant most nights, serving as ma√Ætre d'. Reception Michael Bauer of the San Francisco Chronicle calls Cafe La Haye \\"charming\\" and in 2009 shared that the restaurant is \\"pleasant, but the interior takes a back seat to the food, which continues to showcase Sonoma's best.\\" He has listed it over 15 times on his Top 100 Bay Area Restaurants list. The Press Democrat's Jeff Cox said in 2014 that the restaurant \\"keeps getting better and better.\\" The Michelin Guide 2018 named Cafe La Haye a \\"good standard\\" restaurant, describing it as a \\"standby off the square in downtown Sonoma.\\" They state that the restaurant \\"hasn't aged a day.\\" Lonely Planet calls Cafe La Haye a \\"top table for earthy New American cooking\\" and that the \\"dining room gets packed cheek-by-jowl and service can border on perfunctory\\" but praises the \\"clean simplicity\\" and \\"flavor packed\\" food.

It was located in modern central Shanxi province. The commandery was established by the Qin state in 248 BC, after Qin general Meng Ao attacked Taiyuan, then part of the State of Zhao, and annexed 37 Zhao cities including Yuci (Ê¶ÜÊ¨°), Xincheng (Êñ∞Âüé) and Langmeng (ÁãºÂ≠ü).Records of the Grand Historian, Chapter 5. The seat was Jinyang (ÊôâÈôΩ, near modern Taiyuan city), a former capital of Zhao. In early Western Han dynasty, the territory was successively part of the Han Kingdom of King Xin, and the kingdoms of Dai and Taiyuan. In 114 BC, Taiyuan was once again administered directly as a commandery. In 2 AD, the commandery administered 21 counties, namely Jinyang, Junren (Ëë∞‰∫∫), Jiexiu (Áïå‰ºë), Yuci (Ê¶ÜÊ¨°), Zhongdu (‰∏≠ÈÉΩ), Yuli (‰∫éÈõ¢), Cishi (Ëå≤Ê∞è), Langmeng (ÁãºÂ≠ü), Wu (ÈÑî), Yu (ÁõÇ), Pingtao (Âπ≥Èô∂), Fenyang (Ê±æÈôΩ), Jingling (‰∫¨Èôµ), Yangqu (ÈôΩÊõ≤), Daling (Â§ßÈôµ), Yuanping (ÂéüÂπ≥), Qi (Á•Å), Shang'ai (‰∏äËâæ), L√ºchi (ÊÖÆËôí), Yangyi (ÈôΩÈÇë), and Guangwu (Âª£Ê≠¶). The population was 680,488, or 169,863 households.Book of Han, Chapter 28. By 140 AD, the number of counties had decreased to 16, and the population to 200,124, or 30,902 households.Book of Later Han, Chapter 110. In 280 AD, after the unification of Western Jin, the commandery had 13 counties (Jinyang, Yangqu, Yuci, Yuli, Yu, Langmeng, Yangyi, Daling, Qi, Pingtao, Jingling, Zhongdu, Wu) and 14,000 households.Book of Jin, Chapter 14. The commandery was abolished in 583 during early Sui dynasty. In Sui and Tang dynasties, Taiyuan Commandery became an alternative name of Bing Prefecture (Âπ∂Â∑û), and later, Taiyuan Prefecture (Â§™ÂéüÂ∫ú). In 742 AD, the commandery had a population of 778,278, or 128,905 households in 13 counties.Book of Sui, Chapter 30.New Book of Tang, Chapter 39.

J. Farrell. Academically he is remembered largely for the celebrated non-parametric measure of productive efficiency that he published in 1957.  Biography  Mike Farrell was born in Swindon, England, on May 9, 1926. He was the son of Richard J. Farrell, OBE, an engineer for the Crown Agents for Overseas Governments and Administrations, and Margaret E. Deane. In 1934, his family moved to Sheffield, England, and in 1936 he entered King Edward VII School, Sheffield. In 1944 he won a scholarship to New College, Oxford. He travelled to the US in 1951. While in the USA he met Margaret Bacon, later a psychologist and psychotherapist, daughter of Ernst Bacon, whom he married in 1952. He returned to Cambridge with Margaret in 1953. They had five sons. In 1957, he contracted poliomyelitis. He spent most of a year in the hospital, never recovering fully. Being an avid tennis player and ‚Äúrambler,‚Äù the lasting effects of polio were severely limiting. Despite a dire initial prognosis that he would never walk again, through his determination, he eventually did walk, often unaided. He died in Cambridge on 27 October 1975, aged 49.

Matthew, Brian Harrison and Lawrence Goldman\\"Farrell, Michael James (1926‚Äì1975).\\" The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of EconomicsAnnual Report of Kings College, Cambridge, November 1976 He won an open scholarship in mathematics to New College, Oxford. After his first year at Oxford, he served two years of National Service at the Statistics Division of the Board of Trade, after which he returned to Oxford and changed his studies to PPE. Upon graduating from Oxford in 1949 he moved to Cambridge to the Cambridge University department of applied economics, led by Richard Stone. From 1951 to 1953, he was a Commonwealth Fund fellow, and spent two years with the Cowles Commission for Research in Economics, in Chicago. He was made assistant lecturer in the faculty of economics and politics at Cambridge in 1953, lecturer in 1956, and reader in 1970. In 1958 he became a fellow of Gonville and Caius College, and he was college lecturer in economics from 1960 to 1968 and director of studies in economics and College Registrar until his death. He spent sabbatical leaves at Yale University, Carnegie Mellon University, and University of California, Berkeley, as well as at Center for Operations Research and Econometrics (CORE) in Leuven (also known as Louvain), Belgium. In 1962 he was elected a fellow of the Econometric Society. He edited the Journal of Industrial Economics and was a joint managing editor of the Review of Economic Studies from 1965 to 1968. In 1969, applying for the post of Director of the Department of Applied Economics at Cambridge, Farrell wrote: ‚ÄúMy primary interest in economics has been in the quantification of economic theory and in relating it to empirical data. This has often led me to use econometric and other mathematical techniques‚Ä¶ But my interest in making inferences from empirical evidence is in no way confined to situations where sophisticated mathematical techniques are applicable. ‚Ä¶‚Äù His influences included Philip Andrews, the author of Manufacturing Business, and D. G. Champernowne.The Price of Inequality: How Today's Divided Society Endangers Our Future By Joseph E. StiglitzWeiss, Thomas G. ‚ÄúTranscript of interview of Richard Jolly,‚Äù United Nations Intellectual History Project, The Graduate School and University Center, City University Of New York, New York, 20 July 2005 He influenced notable economists, including Joseph E. Stiglitz and Richard Jolly. In addition to The Measurement of Production Efficiency, his papers include a pamphlet ‚ÄúFuller Employment?‚Äù (1965) and a theoretical discussion in Economica (1966) of the question whether destabilizing speculation can be profitable. Computational Econometrics: Its Impact on the Development of Quantitative Econometrics, edited by Charles G. Renfro, 2004 According to Dr. Lucy Joan Slater, Farrell was the first person to use the Electronic delay storage automatic calculator (EDSAC) I and to program regression analysis.Q. W. Farrell, In conversation with Dr. L. J. Slater Dr. Slater reported years later ‚ÄúProfessor Kaldor (Nicholas Kaldor) said that Mike had infected the economics faculty with numeracy!‚Äù  Farrell efficiency  Leaving aside religious economic debates about whether productive inefficiency can exist, previous attempts to measure it largely fell into two classes. Labor productivity, one popular measure, is simply output divided by labor input. Clearly this begs the question of whether differences in labor productivity are explained by differences in other inputs; it also suggests that one could equally measure capital productivity, or paperclip productivity. One response to this is to fit a parameterized production function, but the results may depend sensitively on the functional form assumed. Farrell's solution was to deem an input-output vector inefficient only to the extent that it is Pareto-dominated by a convex combination of other observed input-output vectors. This amounts to approximating the feasible production set by the convex hull of observed input-output combinations. This work (Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, 1957) has been very influential and exceptionally highly (and durably) cited.

In the presence of Manpreet Singh Ayali, the memorial was inaugurated on 6 October, 2015 by Jathedar Avtar Singh Makad, ex-president, Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee. Building The memorial which was built by British, was declared a protected monument in 1964 under the Punjab Ancient, Historical Monuments, Archaeological Sites and Remains Act. Considering the condition of the building, renovation at a cost of Rs. 10 lakh was done in 2011 by the Punjab Heritage and Tourism Promotion Board, that ceased soon due to the lack of funds which led to attract criticism by some for ignoring the project. With another investment of Rs. 30 lakh, on a half-acre land, with a khanda at the top, the 55-feet memorial constructed with Chhoti Nanakshahi brick, with a library having books on history, literature, and religion, was reconstructed to be ready in October 2015. First Anglo-Sikh War First Anglo-Sikh War was fought in 1845-46, which resulted in Punjab getting, partially, under control by the British, after the expansion. It is believed that British prepared for the war in 1843 when Lord Ellenborough discussed the possibilities of military occupation of Punjab with the home government. At the time of war, British total number of military troops in Punjab were around 86,023 men with 116 guns, in which, 45,500 men were armed with 98 guns in the hill stations of Subathu and Kasauli, with 60,000 Sikh Soldiers.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. History Methodism in Lisbon can be traced to a sermon preached in the spring of 1840 by Dr. Nelson Rathbun, a circuit preacher and physician, from Pioneer Grove (present-day Mechanicsville). The small congregation was served by circuit preachers until 1858 when the Lisbon Circuit was established with a resident preacher in Lisbon. The following year the Methodists assisted the Lutherans in building their new church. The two congregations shared the building until 1868 when the Methodists built their own church at the same location as the present church. A parsonage was built for $1,375.69 in 1887 In the year of 1898 the old edifice religious was torn down. The present edifice religious was built at a cost of $14,000, and completed 1899. Carpenter Daniel C. Hartung supervised the construction, which was carried out by locals. The church building was dedicated on April 9, 1899, with about 900 people in attendance. The congregation bought a Steinway piano at that time for $450. It is still in use here. The pipe organ was installed in 1915. The church's spire was struck by lightning in 1956 and it was destroyed in a fire. Before 1979 the congregation here had shared a minister with another congregation. That year, the Rev. Kalen Fristad became the first minister to serve this congregation alone. In 1989 the front entrance area of the church was enclosed. The parsonage was torn down and an addition was built onto the church in 1995. A parking lot was created across the street from the church in 1996, and a new spire was placed on the tower in 1999. Architecture The church building was designed by the prominent Cedar Rapids architectural firm of Josselyn & Taylor. It was designed in a combination of Queen Anne and Shingle Styles. The building reflects the effects of the Social Gospel movement, which was prominent at the time it was built. It advocated for a larger social and educational role for evangelical religious institutions. In order to carry out these roles, church buildings were being built with libraries, large Sunday school classrooms, and social halls that served community gatherings as well as missionary and charitable work. Lisbon United Methodist Church was one of the first Methodist churches in Iowa that was designed according to the Akron Plan. It featured a large classroom that opened onto the main sanctuary, which had the pews in a semi-circular arrangement. Social rooms and kitchen were built on the lower level.

It is endemic to north-eastern Thailand and known from the Kalasin, Roi Et, and Ubon Ratchathani Provinces. The specific name jarujini honours Jarujin Nabhitabhata from the National Science Museum of Thailand. Common name Jarujin's treefrog has been coined for it. Description Adult males measure and adult females in snout‚Äìvent length. The snout is rounded dorsally and angular in profile. The tympanum is visible. Both fingers and toes are broadly webbed and have discs, the toe discs being smaller than those on the fingers. The dorsum is light brown. There is a narrow dark band running between the eyes. The back has irregular dark crossbands. The underside is patternless, anteriorly cream and posteriorly yellow. The ventral surfaces of hands, feet, and thighs are light orange. The limbs have dark crossbars. The webbing is reddish brown. The iris is yellow. Males have median subgular vocal sac. The tadpole has a striking colouration: the body is yellowish grey with gold lateral stripe, and the tail is light yellow in its anterior part and bright red further back, with the whole tail covered with irregular black spots. The largest specimen (Gosner stage 38) measured in body length. Habitat and conservation Zhangixalus jarujini occurs in a variety of habitats within dipterocarp and hilly evergreen forests at elevations of above sea level. Individuals have been found on the ground or in vegetation (from near the ground to up to 2 metres above the ground) near small bodies of water including a rain pool in igneous rock, a seep running over solid rock, a rocky stream, small ponds, and a dried rocky stream bed with small pools. Tadpoles are known from a small stream pool with silt and leaf-litter bottom. The known populations occur in protected areas, including Phu Sri Tan Wildlife Sanctuary, Phu Pha Namtip Non- hunting Area, and Phu Jong-Na Yoi National Park. These populations might not face any threats. However, outside the protected areas much of the natural vegetation has been lost, and Zhangixalus jarujini has likely lost much of its original habitat.

Early life She was born Lady Anne Evelyn Beatrice Cavendish on 6 November 1927 at 2 Upper Belgrave Street, London, the third daughter of Edward Cavendish, 10th Duke of Devonshire (1895‚Äì1950), and his wife, Lady Mary Gascoyne-Cecil (1895‚Äì1988), granddaughter of Prime Minister Robert Gascoyne- Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury. Career She first wanted to be a prison visitor at the age of 14, and took up this role from 1949 until 1974, although she struggled at first to gain access to women's prisons, so resorted to extensive letter writing and using her wide network of friends and relations. One of the prisoners she regularly visited was the murderer Myra Hindley, whom she introduced to Lord Longford; he later argued for her release. Lady Anne became very aware of how boring and pointless life in prison could seem, and founded the charity Fine Cell Work, which gives men and women in prison the opportunity to create intricately-detailed cushion covers, wall hangings and rugs. She was keen on embroidery and needlework herself, and was confident that men would enjoy it too. The designs are created by leading fashion designers, and the skilled work can be rewarding, and may lead to paid work on release.

Harris worked at the all-black Monroe Comprehensive High School, where she taught Latin, French, and Social Studies. Early life McCree Harris was an African American activist born in 1934 in Albany, GA. Her family life was sheltered as she was raised by Reverend Isaiah A. Harris and Katie B. Harris who both dedicated their time towards the Racial Equality and Economic Empowerment of African Americans. As the founder of Mt. Calvary Baptist Church, the Reverend used the church as a means to support this empowerment with the goal of increasing voter registration among African Americans in the south. Rev Harris a minister, architect, church builder, and entrepreneur passed in 1951 long before the Albany Movement began. He was an active leader in the Black Church movement throughout Georgia and deemed as one of the prominent ministers in Georgia. At this time, attaining voter registration was very difficult in the south primarily for African Americans. Whites used intimidation including poll taxes and tests to African Americans that were necessary to pay or pass in order to attain voting privileges. These tests often included minor trivia details about the US constitution which many of the white test administrators could not answer themselves, resulting in African Americans not successfully passing the test or gaining voting privileges. The Reverend compensated by attempting to educate the voters in preparation for the exams to become registered. These tests and racial unfairness sprouted from the Jim Crow laws that enacted racial segregation in the south. Katie Harris, began her education at Albany State College after the birth of her eight children. She devoted her life to the education of children as an elementary school teacher. McCree had seven siblings John H, Rosetta (Bae), Juanita (Neat), Alphonso, Elijah (Peter Rabit), Rutha Mae and Emory Harris, each actively participating in the movement. \\"Janie Culbreth Rambeau, who began working with SNCC while she was a student at Albany State College, stresses that there were many women in southwest Georgia ‚Äúwho didn‚Äôt actually march and go to jail, per se, but who made contributions that you would not believe.‚Äù \\"Katie B. Harris, for example, whose children include Rutha Harris, one of the original SNCC Freedom Singers, her brother, Emory, and sister, McCree, all of whom were extremely active in the movement, opened her home to any movement worker who needed something to eat or a place to sleep. Rambeau says, ‚ÄúPeople would come in and they would sleep on a pallet on the floor, just to be with Mama Katie B.‚Äù Women in southwest Georgia made their homes gathering places for the movement, and their rooms were filled with young participants who felt a sense of responsibility toward them and sought security in their homes and under their care.\\"[Janie Culbreth Rambeau, interview with author, by telephone, Jan. 25, 2001APA (American Psychological Assoc.) Boswell, A., & McArthur, J. N. (2006). Women Shaping the South : Creating and Confronting Change. Columbia: University of Missouri Press.] Rutha, Alphonso, Elijah and Emory provided their services to the movement as members of the Freedom Singers. Rutha was an original Freedom Singer and Emory was a founding member of a chapter of male Freedom Singers in the early 1960s. Freedom Singers originated in an African American congregation, Mt. Zion Baptist Church, that followed fellowship through singing that developed common spiritual lyrics to embody the purpose of the civil rights movement that was developing across the south. As a following of the Albany Movement under the leadership of C.B. King the SNCC formed along with the support of Freedom singer's fundraising. McCree Harris attended graduate school at Columbia University and started her career as a teacher at Monroe High School where she taught French, Latin, Social Studies and African American History. She encouraged students to participate in the movement, leading them to protest segregation of stores and theaters. Rutha participated in Freedom Singers, who performed across the country and raised money for the Student Nonviolent Coordination Committee (SNCC). These Freedom Singers were likely to be imprisoned for protesting, which allowed them to boost morale and increase positivity through song whilst they remained committed to their movement. The Albany Movement led to over 1,000 supporters to be jailed. In the summer of 1962, Martin Luther King and Abernathy returned for the sentencing of December convictions for which they would rather be jailed then pay the fine. Albany sheriff Lorie Pritchett, who encouraged officers to use nonviolent tactics in public/media settings, took care of the fines so that King and Abernathy were released against their will. Unfulfilled immediate efforts left Albany's African American community to rally around other leaders. A lot happened outside of the public eye in the Albany Movement. McCree and others of her family actively worked behind the scenes of the movement tirelessly protecting protesting students both black and white, developing strategy, preparing meals, and donating finances, all to keep the cause running smoothly while avoiding jail time. McCree Harris believed strongly in Albany's movement for equality and rights in conjunction with the civil rights movement as a whole, by educating black youth to build a larger movement for years to come. The Albany Movement McCree Harris became a political activist leader as a result of her teaching job at the all-black Monroe Comprehensive High School. She had known that she wanted to help change the segregated south for her whole life. Harris went back to Albany, Georgia, and joined the Albany Movement because she felt that something wasn't quite right in Albany. The town of Albany, as Harris says, was hard to desegregate. Harris' work in the Albany Movement eventually brought many changes to segregated Albany. Harris advocated for equal rights and desegregation, and her main goal was to \\"raise the educational status of black youth\\". When the Albany Movement started in the fall of 1961, she encouraged her students to boycott the public transportation system, to take part in local sit-ins, and join marches. Because Harris \\"had direct contact with the student body\\", the marching lines increased. Albany as a precursor to the Birmingham movement strategy allowed the students and young people to participate in the movement because they did not have jobs to lose while being arrested. This work was done with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee(SNCC). McCree Harris also took her teachings from Talladega College and told students, \\"Don't pay for segregation.\\" The phrase was used as a reminder to stay away from businesses that practiced racial segregation, like her local movie theater. The one exception was when Harris took her students to see a popular film. When the \\"white section\\" was filled and individuals came to the \\"black section\\" for seats, she told her students not to give up their chairs. Eventually, the authorities arrived and threatened to arrest the kids so McCree Harris left with her class. McCree Harris was one of the original board members of the Albany Civil Rights Movement. She was a teacher at her old high school, Monroe High School when she joined. Harris joined the board against the advisement of the superintendent of schools, who told her joining would result in her arrest and subsequent loss of a teaching job. Despite this, she was able to contribute a considerable amount to the movement, and she participated in civil rights marches and evaluations of public facilities. These evaluations weren't always without resistance. Harris herself gave an account of one such event where a man threw a hot drink on her while she did not retaliate. She worked vigorously and privately for the Albany Movement because she could not jeopardize her job as a Social Studies, Latin, and French school teacher at an all-black Monroe High School. At Monroe High School, McCree Harris was also involved with The Freedom Singers. She often went on field trips with the schools music teacher, Ann Elizabeth Wright, and the school chorus at statewide competitions. She even often organized protests on voter registration and brought groups of her high school students to protests after school hours. Local college students would come to protest with Harris too; she worked hard to bring the community together to fight for the racial inequality that was happening in the south. In Albany she also started working for the SNCC. This work on voter registration was with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). This organization was unique because it allowed people with little or no power the opportunity to help in the fight for voter rights. The work she remained involved in was very demanding. Afterward, being a life long diabetic, the stress and wear caught up with her body. She took an entire year off work to get restored to health. Despite this, she retained a strong loyalty to her school and concern for her students. Known to them as \\"Teach\\", she valued them beyond measure. In a personal statement, Harris said, \\"My main goal in the (Albany Civil Rights) Movement was to raise the educational status of black youth in our community.\\" Her work and accomplishments reflect this, and in 1999 upon the recommendation of her niece Deidra L Fryer, the National Council of Negro Women (NCNW) named her the State of Georgia and National Community Leader of the Year. After the first civil rights meeting was held on November 25, hundreds of civilians were being arrested and beaten in the streets. 700 African American residents of Albany were jailed just days after the meeting. During an interview, McCree Harris stated, \\"I thought I would get involved in politics because it would help my race, which is who and what I am interested in.\\" She joined several community groups during her lifetime. McCree was on the board of both the Economic Development Council and the Water, Gas, and Light Commission. She was also a member of the National Urban League, the National Association of Colored People(NAACP), and the community relations council. During her participation, she worked alongside Shirley Sherrod and Martin Luther King Jr. to lead voter registration marches. Harris also went with Martin Luther King Jr. to Saint Augustine, Florida, in an attempt to desegregate the Munson Motor Hotel. Activist meetings were held at Old Mount Zion Baptist Church; and although fearful of being caught and thrown in prison, Harris attended every meeting. During the 1990s, the church was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Individuals wanted the transform the Zion Baptist Church into a museum to show the hard work and dedication of those who participated in the Albany movement, Harris being one of the participants included. McCree Harris was a secretary of a non-profit organization that helped transform the church. The board used $750,000 to convert the church into \\"Albany's Museum at Old Mount Zion Church,\\" which officially opened in November 1998. The executive director of the Albany Civil Rights Movement Museum, Angela Whitmal stated, \\"From the inception of the idea of a museum, 'McCree Harris' worked very hard to make it a reality.\\" Democratic Party Involvement After her time working for the Albany Movement, she worked as a political operative for several local Albany candidates. Harris has been a huge part of the desegregated civic effort in Albany. Harris worked as an advisor to several members of the Democratic Party in Albany, including John White and former Mayor Paul Keenan, who recalled her as \\"a valuable personal friend and a valuable citizen.\\" Harris was his consultant during Albany's flood of 1994. After the flood, many black citizens of Albany accused the city of purposely diverting floodwater away from wealthy white families and towards their neighborhoods, creating more racial tension. Harris advised Keenan on the difficult task of admitting the greater property damage to black homes while denying any sort of manipulation by the government.

History  The Bronx Council on the Arts was founded in the early 1960s when community leaders: Jerry Klot, Reverend William Kaladjian and others came together to provide summer arts & culture activities in the Bronx. In 1969 the Bronx Council on the arts merged with the Bronx Committee on the Arts and worked to improve access to the arts around the Bronx by introducing various programs around the Borough including the Bronx regrets program and the opening of the Bronx Museum of the Arts. As the Bronx Council on the Arts continued to grow they offered their programs at various galleries and venues located throughout the Bronx but lacked a central space. That changed in 2011 when Chase donated the former Washington Mutual Branch located at 2700 East Tremont Avenue to be used as their headquarters. Due to lack of funds, the group was unable to develop and utilize the space. In 2015 with support from Councilman James Vacca and Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr and other donors, they were was able to obtain the funds needed to renovate the building and utilize it as their central office and moved in during 2019.

Xconomy wrote that the company's intent was to create a metal 3D printer that would \\"churn out parts more quickly\\" and be \\"much cheaper, smaller, safer and easier to operate\\" than alternatives on the market. To eliminate the need for trained personnel to operate the equipment, dangerous features such as lasers were not made a part of the design process. By October 2015 the company had 11 employees, with Ric Fulop as CEO. Initially the company raised around $14 million in startup funding, with leading Series A funders including New Enterprise Associates, Kleiner Perkins, and Lux Capital. By the spring of 2016, the company was headquartered in Lexington, Massachusetts and had developed functioning prototypes. After former investors injected an additional $34 million into Desktop Metal in April 2016, that summer the company raised funding from investors including GE Ventures and Saudi Aramco Energy Ventures. By February 2017, the company had moved its headquarters to Burlington, Massachusetts. That month the company raised $45 million in a Series C round of venture funding led by GV and including participation from BMW iVentures and Lowe's Ventures. With total raised brought to $97 million, the capital was used for research and development, with plans to begin selling the first product later that year in a variety of industries. =2017= Desktop Metal was collaborating with Ford Motor Company's research and advanced engineering and manufacturing teams by 2017, refining its system to meet manufacturing requirements. Desktop Metals was also working with BMW in Munich to explore eliminating the need to warehouse parts, and companies such as Milwaukee Tools and Jabil Circuit Inc. A U.S. were evaluating the printers for production use. The company revealed two distinct metal 3D printing systems in late April 2017: a studio model and a production model. The Studio System, safe for office settings is designed for rapid printing and the production of small volumes, while the latter is intended for high-speed production of parts. Both systems include a printer, furnace, and cloud-based software to operate the machines, with the ability to print several hundred alloy types. Forbes described the pricing scheme of the products as \\"competitive,\\" noting the systems cost \\"10 times less than what's on the market.\\" Stratasys, an investor in Desktop Metal, announced in May 2017 that its resellers would stock Desktop Metal‚Äôs products. The World Economic Forum named Desktop Metal to its 2017 Technology Pioneers list of 30 companies in June, and also that month, MIT Technology Review named Desktop Metal among its 50 Smartest Companies in the World for the year. Desktop Metal raised a total of $115 million in a Series D round of funding in July 2017, its largest round to that point. Funds went to R&D;, its sales program, and international growth and brought the total raised since founding to $212 million. The company began shipping the Studio System in December 2017 as part of its \\"Pioneer\\" program. The first printer went to Google's Advanced Technology and Products Group and among other early customers were the United States Navy, Built-Rite Tool & Die, and Lumenium. =2018= By early 2018 the company had been granted two patents for separable support and an interface layer, with around 100 patents pending for around 200 inventions. In February 2018 the company previewed Live Parts, a software program for automatically generating printable designs. At CES 2018 Desktop Metal won an emerging tech award from Digital Trends. In 2018 it also won a Gold Edison Award. In March 2018, Ford Motor Company led a $65 million investment round in Desktop Metal, with Ford's CTO joining Desktop Metal's board of directors. With a $1.2 billion valuation, by May 2018 Desktop Metal had been named the fast growing \\"unicorn\\" in United States history, surpassing $1 billion after 21 months in operation. Desktop Metal introduced an upgrade to its industrial scale systems at Formnext 2018, claiming the 50% printing speed increase made the model \\"the fastest metal printer in the world.\\"https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/desktop-metal- upgrades-production-system-for-2019-launch-claims-fastest-metal-printer-in- the-world-143089/ Cofounder Ric Fulop asserted that the system dropped the price per part significantly compared to other systems, in one case from $700 per kilo of parts to $50 a kilo. = 2019 = In January 2019, Desktop Metal raised an additional $160 million in funding, resulting in a valuation at $1.5 billion.https://www.forbes.com/sites/amyfeldman/2019/01/23/3-d-printing- unicorn-desktop-metal-raises-160-million-for-expansion/#16a32e083c04 By May 2019, the company employed around 300 people, mostly engineers, with the machines made through contract manufacturing. It also had a sales channel distributing in 48 countries. In June 2019, the company began shipping to Europe. By 2019, the company had raised $437 million from investors, and was one of only three 3D printing unicorns. In November it introduced a system for metal job shops\\"Desktop Metal 3D Printers Set to Disrupt Manufacturing\\", Nanalyze and a system using fiber placement. = 2020 = Desktop Metal will go public through a reverse IPO, a merger with Trine Acquisition Corp. (NYSE: TRNE), a special-purpose acquisition company. Products =Printer systems= Desktop Metal launched its first two products in April 2017: the Studio System, a metal 3D printing system designed for engineers and small production runs, and the Production System, intended for manufacturers and large-scale printing. In 2019 the company introduced the Shop System, a metal binder jetting printing system designed for machine and metal job shops, as well as Fiber, a continuous carbon fiber printer using automated fiber placement technology (AFP) to make parts.printing continuous fiber on the desktop\\", Composites World Studio System Both the Studio System and Production System include two key components: a printer that produces small objects out of metal powders, and a sintering furnace to densify the objects using thermal processes. The systems can print a variety of materials, including steels, copper, aluminum, and alloys such as Inconel. Powders also used in the metal injection molding market are housed in replaceable cartridges made by various metallurgy companies and Desktop Metal. As the process doesn't utilize dangerous lasers, or hazardous materials, the Studio System can be housed inside office spaces with standard wall outlets. The Studio System uses a proprietary technology called Bound Metal Deposition, similar to fused deposition modeling (FDM) where the printer \\"extrudes a mixture of metal powder and polymers to build up a shape, much as some plastic printers do.‚Äù When the shape is complete, it is placed in a furnace which burns away the polymers and ‚Äúcompacts the metal particles by sintering them together at just below their melting point.\\" At that temperature the metal is fused without melting and losing its shape. The sintering causes predictable shrinking, which the system‚Äôs software compensates for by making items slightly larger during the printing step. Beyond the printer and furnace, the Studio System also includes a debinder to remove part of the polymer binder before sintering. Production System The Production System uses a printing method where droplets of a binding agent are \\"jetted\\" onto a metal powder in heated layers. The method is called Single Pass Jetting, used for quickly producing metal parts. According to the company, the system can process 8,200 cubic centimeters per hour, which is nearly 100 times faster than laser-based systems using powder bed fusion (PBF). It can produce dozens of parts simultaneously. The Production System was named by Popular Science as one of the top engineering innovations of 2017, in the magazine's annual Best of What's New issue. =Live Parts software= Desktop Metal developed Live Parts, an AI software for users to automatically generate printable object designs. The program allows users to input specifications for an object, then creates a computer model which can be printed using any 3-D printing system.

Bracha Fuld, also known as Barbara Fuld (1926‚Äì1946) was a Jewish resistance fighter who died in an attempt to help Jewish Holocaust refugees enter Palestine. She was the first female Jewish soldier killed during the pre-state conflict with the British.  Early life  Fuld was born Barbara Fuld in 1926 in Germany. Her father had served in the German army during WWI, and he took his own life after the events of Kristallnacht in 1938, unable to reconcile his Jewish and German identities. Fuld's older sister Petra had been sent to the United States to escape antisemitism. In 1939, Fuld left Germany and immigrated with her mother to Palestine, where Fuld became known as Bracha instead of Barbara. Fuld's mother, Lotte, opened a candy store.  Military career  Upon graduating high school in 1944, Fuld joined the Palmach, an elite Jewish military force that was working with the British. She was named an outstanding cadet, and was one of the few women who trained to become a squad commander. She was made an officer at the age of eighteen. Fuld first instructed women soldiers, and was later put in charge of several platoons and military detachments. Fuld became romantically involved with fellow Palmach member Gideon Peli. At the end of WWII, the British attempted to stop Jewish Holocaust refugees from coming to Palestine, and the Palmach fighters revolted. They began to sabotage and assault the British military, while helping to smuggle Jewish immigrants into Palestine.  Death and legacy  191x191px In March 1946, a ship of illegal Jewish immigrants from Italy was set to arrive in Palestine. Fuld and her squad were sent to protect a stretch of road that would be used to help the immigrants reach safety. The ship was captured and diverted by the British before arriving, but the message to abort the mission did not reach Fuld and her squad in time, and they soon encountered a British tank unit. After an exchange of fire, Fuld was badly wounded. Instead of receiving medical treatment, she was taken to a police station to be interrogated, and she died of her injuries shortly afterwards. Fuld was the first female Jewish fighter killed resisting the British during the pre-state conflict. Bracha Fuld Street in 195x195px Six months after her death, a ship for transporting illegal Jewish immigrants was named the S. S. Bracha Fuld, which the British soon seized.

Gunderson had also earlier worked for Cooley LLP, where in the 80s he had been one of the first associates sent to Palo Alto to start the firm's Silicon Valley venture practice with partner Lee Benton. The firm grew rapidly along with the Dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, and by 1999, Gunderson Dettmer became notable for being the first law firm in the country to raise first-year associate salaries to $125,000. The firm was able to weather the collapse of the Dot-com bubble and Early 2000s recession to remain a significant player in the tech start-up field, even as Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison collapsed due to its practice of accepting equity as payment from start-ups, many of which wound up going bankrupt in the crash. By the early 2010s, Gunderson Dettmer had become the top global law firm in venture funding by number of deals. In 2011, the Wall Street Journal reported that Gunderson Dettmer had surpassed Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati as the most active law firm in venture capital.

She is known for her early advocacy of sex education and public health education in Singapore. She was also known for her poetry and short story writing.  Biography  Tan was born Nallammah Navarendam on 12 May 1923 in Ipoh. Tan's parents were teachers and she was the fourth out of six children. Tan attended the Methodist Girls' School in Ipoh. She graduated from the University of Malaya in 1952 with a bachelor's degree in Medicine. Tan told The Straits Times in 1984, that at first she'd wanted to be a lawyer, but chose medicine because there was no law faculty at the time at the school. After school, she became a government health officer and later an administrative officer for the Ministry of Health. In the 1960s, she advocated introducing sex and health education in schools. Tan would later head the Singapore Medical Association committee to organize the first public health program in Singapore. Between 1967 and 1971, she was the principal of Eusoff College, which was part of the University of Singapore. Tan was also a faculty member of the university. During the 1970s, she began writing newspaper columns and gave speeches against gender discrimination. She brought up the idea of creating a \\"Women's Affairs\\" department in the government. In 1975, Tan, along with Chan Choy Siong and Lim Kim Choo, were recognized with Outstanding Women Awards for their work for women's rights in Singapore. Tan earned her doctorate of medicine in 1975. The next year, she was promoted to associate professor at the university. Tan became a member of the faculty of Community Medicine of the Royal College of Physicians in 1978 and five years later, became a fellow. When she retired from the university, she ran a private clinic from her home for several years. Tan served on the World Methodist Council (WMC) Presidium between 1976 and 1981 and the WMC Family Life Committee between 1976 and 1991. She was the first Singaporean to be elected to the Presidium. She was awarded the Honorable Order of Jerusalem for her work on the council and within the Methodist community. Tan began to exhibit symptoms of Alzheimer's disease in the early 2000s. Tan died in the Tan Tock Seng Hospital on 27 March 2012, after suffering a chest infection that developed into pneumonia. In 2015, Tan was inducted into the Singapore Women's Hall of Fame.  Writing  Tan wrote poetry as a young adult, but did not start writing seriously until she was on maternity leave in 1961. Tan's husband, Tan Joo Liang, encouraged her to explore her personal style of writing during her leave. She wrote her first story, \\"Robert and the Beetroots\\" at that time. In 1974, her short story, \\"The Goddess of Mercy\\" was aired on BBC. An anthology of women's fiction, called The Sun in Her Eyes: Stories by Singapore Women (1976), brought recognition to her writing. It was also the first time that Singaporean women's short stories had been collected into an anthology. She was also featured in Singapore Short Stories Volume II (1978). The collection of her short stories, Hearts and Crosses (1989), incorporate her own personal experiences and take place in Singapore. Many of her short stories are also characterized by a sense of irony and having a twist ending. Tan's poetry has been called \\"essentially feminine\\" by The Straits Times, even though Tan herself never felt as though she was a \\"woman writer\\" and was influenced primarily by male writers as a young adult. The Times also describes how her satirical poetry has a sense of \\"dry humor.\\" Her non-fiction work included focus on family and social issues, as well as providing educational information about puberty and sexual health. Her health education books, You Need to Know (1976) and Beyond Your Navel (1977) are written in a \\"inimitable, chatty style\\" according to The Straits Times. Beyond Your Navel discusses both sexual and emotional health, breaking down ideas into clear and simple sections for better understanding. She also discusses drug addiction in the book. Tan wrote a weekly column in the Sunday Times called 'You' where she discussed issues many readers faced, politics and developing the community.

Background and education Nelly was born and raised in Kenya. She is the middle child and only girl in a family of three siblings. She attended Kapsabet Academy Primary School in Nandi County and Eregi Girls Boarding Primary School, in Kakamega County for her elementary schooling. She then transferred to Saint Mary's Tachasis Girls High School, in Nandi County, graduating from high school in 2002. After high school, Nelly's mother could not afford college fees. Instead, Nelly volunteered at Sally Test Paediatric Centre, in Eldoret. While there, she met Stephen Leapman and his wife Judy Leapman, who volunteered to sponsor her education at Indiana University and to host her while in the United States. She graduated from the IU School of Nursing with a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degree. Career After college, she started working as a critical care nurse in the state of Indiana, in the United States. However, in 2010, she began to explore the possibility of starting a beauty line of products geared towards African women. With US$400 (approx. Sh40,800), Nelly Tuikong started Pauline Cosmetics (named after her mother). She researched online and approached Kiralee Hubbard, an American makeup artist who owns Eye Max Cosmetics for advice and mentor ship. Nelly chose to start with four product lines; lip stick, lip gloss, mascara and eye shadow. In 2012 she relocated back to her native Kenya and settled in Eldoret. After about three years of making start-up mistakes (she ordered her first large batch of cosmetics before she developed the market), she started to distribute her line through retail outlets in a sustainable manner. As of February 2016, she was supplying to over 40 retail outlets in Kenya, with plans to expand to other East African countries, including Uganda and Rwanda.

The ship was built and designed specially to support the Dutch submarines. She entered service on 21 August 1987, and is the only surface vessel attached to the Dutch submarine service. History The former torpedo ship HNLMS Mercuur was in need of replacement at beginning of the early 1970s. She was a minesweeper of the Aggressive-class and re-purposed in 1972 as a submarine support ship. The ship, however, was due her age not adequately equipped to fulfill the tasks the Royal Netherlands Navy wanted to use her for, so in 1977 the Royal Netherlands Navy started to make plans and designs for her replacement. The new ship would also be called Mercuur and named after the planet Mercury. This name was always given to ships that were not meant for combat, but rather had a support function. The design of the new ship was especially tailored made for submarine support tasks. The new Mercuur could, for example, hoist torpedoes onto deck with a special hoisting installation which was constructed at the backside of the ship. The ship can also do launch tests for the MK48 torpedo, which are used by the all Dutch submarines since the Zwaardvis-class submarines entered service in the 1970s. The design has also a retractable bow thruster with which the Mercuur can accurately approach a submarine to retrieve her torpedoes, which have been shot during an excerise at the Mercuur. Like the water-filled hydrographic research vessel of the Royal Netherlands Navy it has a sling damper system. In 1985 the construction of the new HNLMS Mercuur began. The Royal Netherlands Navy signed a contract with Koninklijke Maatschappij de Schelde (now known as Damen Schelde Naval Shipbuilding) to build the ship. The contract was placed to make sure no yard worker would be fired, since shipbuilder De Schelde struggled at the time with orders, so it had to lay off workers if the situation did not change. The order can therefore be seen as subsidy. On 6 November 1985 the keel was laid and on 16 October 1986 the Mercuur was launched. On 21 August 1987 the ship HNLMS Mercuur was put into service and has been serving ever since, with a minor break for implementing upgrades during her modernization. She has served several Dutch submarines during her service. Besides the current Walrus-class submarines that are in active duty, they have also supported the previous active Zwaardvis-class submarines and even the older Dolfijn-class submarines during their last years of service in the Royal Netherlands Navy.  Modernization  In 2015 Damen Group won an order for the maintenance and modernization of the torpedo support ship HNLMS Mercuur. The ship will would undergo modifications including; a different design of the bridge, a whole range of new electronic equipment, and a reinforced bow. Damen also announced that the interior of the Mercuur would re-designed, such as the kitchen and living quarters. The Mercuur arrived on 7 September 2015 at Damen Shipyards Den Helder for her modernization to start. It was towed to Damen Shiprepair Harlingen for the final phase of the refurbishment six months later. After the modernization is complete, the Mercuur is expected to stay in service in the Royal Netherlands Navy till at least 2025. However, the Mercuur will be replaced before 2034 alongside other navy ships.KVMO, \\"Nut en noodzaak onderzeeboten: deltaplan voor defensie\\" Marineblad Maart 2016 nr 2 Jaargang 126, pg. 5 In April 2017 the modernized HNLMS Mercuur took part in a shakedown cruise to test her upgrades.  Support role  Mercuur has several tasks that all involve supporting the Dutch submarines. Firstly, Mercuur will always take part in training exercises which involve the submarines of the Royal Netherlands Navy, during these exercises Mercuur functions mostly as target ship. Another task of the Mercuur is that it performs tests and experiments with torpedoes that are used by the four Dutch submarines. Besides tests and experiments it also performs maintenance on the torpedoes.

After achieving the goal for Afro-Bolivians to be protected under the law, she served as the head the Ministry of Gender and was appointed deputy mayor of the Peripheral Macrodistrict of the Municipality of La Paz. Early life Marfa Inofuentes P√©rez was born in 1969 in La Paz, Bolivia, one of three children of Benjam√≠n Inofuentes. Her father was born in Toca√±a, a village in the Bolivian Yungas Region, where the majority of the country's of Afro-Bolivians originated. After completion of her secondary studies, Inofuentes enrolled in the Universidad Mayor de San Andr√©s, studying sociology and law. Career In 1990 Inofuentes joined the Afro-Bolivian Saya Cultural Movement (), a group organized to preserve the cultural traditions of black Bolivians, particularly the artform of saya, by increasing their visibility and acceptance in the wider society. She participated in a public performance of saya in Toca√±a in 1990, one of the first times that the public was allowed to witness the ceremonies. In 2001, after the World Conference against Racism, Inofuentes and Jorge Medina, co-founded the Afro-Bolivian Center for Community Development () to advocate for government recognition of Bolivia's black population. According to a 1997 poll by the Inter-American Development Bank, which included M√≥nica Rey Guti√©rrez, another Afro-Bolivian activist, the population numbered around 20,000 people, but the previous census in 2001 had no category except \\"other\\" to survey the actual size of the ethnic group. She believed that lack of state recognition as a minority, and inability to determine the size of the population, furthered marginalization of Afro-Bolivians, as there were no protections in law for discrimination or racial violence. Traveling widely, Inofuentes represented Bolivia's black women at meetings of the Organization of Ibero-American States in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, and the United States. She was also a member of the feminist organization the Network of Caribbean Latin American and African Diaspora Women (). In 2006, after the election of President Evo Morales, lawmakers met in Sucre to rewrite the Constitution. Inofuentes and other black activists lobbied all of the political parties, pressing for recognition as an ethnic group. As one of the main activists involved in the Bolivian Constitutional Assembly, Inofuentes argued for the addition of articles to protect the civil rights of Afro-Bolivians, including language that recognized the population and protected their culture with the same provisions afforded to indigenous people and other intercultural minorities. Gaining the concessions desired, in 2009, Afro-Bolivians gained constitutional protection and recognition, after the Bolivian constitutional referendum passed. Her activism led to her being appointed to head the Ministry of Gender. In 2010, she was appointed as Deputy Mayor of the Peripheral Macrodistrict of the Municipality of La Paz, but after one year, she developed health problems and entered into a coma from which she did not recover. Death and legacy Inofuentes died on 4 March 2015 at the Obrero Hospital in La Paz and is most remembered for her activism to gain recognition for the cultural traditions and identity of Afro-Bolivians.

Voice interaction with Cortana provides features such as setting alarms, facts, searches, weather, news, traffic, flights, and other real-time information. Additionally, the speaker's Cortana integration with one's Microsoft Account enables calendars, reminders, commutes, to-do lists, and home automation features, among others. The device supports music streaming from Spotify, iHeartRadio, and TuneIn. and is also the first smart speaker to support voice calls using Skype. The inside of the speaker consists of seven far-field microphones, three woofers, three tweeters, two passive radiators, and a 40-watt amplifier. History In December 2016, Microsoft announced it was partnering with Harman Kardon to develop a Cortana-powered smart speaker for release in 2017 and teased a preview of the device on YouTube. The device was officially unveiled on October 2, 2017 and became available for purchase on October 22, 2017 at Microsoft Store and select retailers, such as Best Buy, for an introductory price of $199.95. Over the Thanksgiving weekend during Black Friday sales, the speaker was discounted to $99. =End of life= Microsoft announced in July 2020 that they would end support for Cortana on the Invoke speaker in January 2021. The speaker will receive a firmware update in 2021 to make it into an ordinary Bluetooth speaker. Microsoft offered a $50 gift card to Invoke owners who had used the Cortana feature after July 31, 2019 and before its end-of-life announcement. Features =Standalone audio= By itself, the Harman Kardon Invoke can function as a standalone Bluetooth wireless speaker and also has Spotify Connect integration for audio streaming. Manufactured by a home audio equipment manufacturer, the Invoke contains 3 woofers and 3 tweeters for full range, 360-degree sound as well as 2 passive radiators which aid the bass performance in a small enclosure. =Cortana= The integration of Microsoft's Cortana brings smart speaker features to the Invoke including virtual assistant, music streaming, home automation, and calls to/from mobile and landlines, as well as Skype-to-Skype calls, all via Skype. Cortana can be activated through saying the wake phrase \\"Hey Cortana\\" or by a three-second long touch of the capacitive touch area on the top of the speaker. Cortana can then subsequently be controlled through voice commands in the same way it can be controlled on Windows 10, Windows 10 Mobile, Windows Phone 8.1, Xbox One, iOS, Android devices. Because Cortana synchronizes with one's Microsoft account, the Invoke offers interoperability between all devices on which a user has Cortana, such as their phone, allowing for synchronization with a user's Cortana Notebook including appointments, reminders, lists, places, lifestyle recommendations, traffic, commutes, packages, flights, alarms, weather, and news topics. The Invoke also has access to Cortana Skills Kit which enables features such as home automation, music streaming, and other mobile app integration. =Incoming and outgoing calls= Invoke can make and receive hands-free calls with Cortana through its integration with Skype. =Home automation= Through Cortana, the Invoke is compatible with home automation platforms including Insteon, Nest, SmartThings, Wink, and Philips Hue. On February 16, 2018 Microsoft announced connected home skills were added for ecobee, Honeywell Lyric, Honeywell Total Connect Comfort, LIFX, TP-Link Kasa, and Geeni.https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2018/02/16/hey-cortana-turn- heat-cortana-now-works-smart-home-providers-ifttt/ Support for IFTTT was also added. Reception Initial reviews praised the Invoke for both its high end design and build quality as well as its superior sound quality versus competitors such as Amazon Echo and Google Home and that it's \\"a compelling option for anyone who values music quality\\". Molly Price of CNET compared the Invoke to Amazon Echo and Google Home, noting that the Invoke's metal outer casing design, smooth-turning volume control, and touchpad, \\"feels high-end, and that's good news for a speaker with a higher price tag than the Amazon Echo and Google Home.\\" She also found \\"the Invoke's 360-degree sound to deliver fuller bass and cleaner treble than Amazon's Echo line of speakers.\\" Another CNET editor, Ty Pendlebury, compared the Invoke to Alexa-powered Sonos One and \\"found it well matched -- though each speaker had its strengths and weaknesses\\" Engadget's Devindra Hardawar highly praised the Invoke's audio quality, stating \\"It sounds amazing, so it's particularly well-suited for audiophiles\\" and that \\"Invoke's audio is much richer and nuanced, while the Echo sounds cheap and flat by comparison.\\" He also noted the high build quality, mentioning the \\"huge difference in build quality: The Echo is made entirely of plastic, while the Invoke features a more premium-feeling metallic case, with only a bit of plastic around the base. Even the control dial feels much better than the Echo's; it turns more smoothly and feels like controlling a piece of high-end audio gear.\\" Hardawar credited Harman Kardon's long history in the audio equipment industry for its success of Invoke's as an audio device. Both reviews also mentioned that while (at the time of Invoke's release) Microsoft's Cortana was behind other assistants in terms of skillset, that Microsoft and Amazon's partnership to integrate Alexa into Cortana, and vice versa would soon resolve that shortfall. As of February 2020, this has not happened.

The site is located on Monte Moli√£o, an elevation north-west of Lagos city center, on the east bank of the Ribeira de Bensafrim, in the parish of S√£o Sebasti√£o. It is the vestiges of an old fortified settlement, also identified as Lac√≥briga, occupied since the Second Iron Age, between the end of the 4th century BC and the end of the 3rd century BC. This location is of Celtic origin and was progressively abandoned during the Carthaginian and Roman, the Republican Roman, and the Imperial Roman ages due to the growth of another population center, with the same name. Excavation history Entrance of the archaeological site. At the end of the 19th century, Portuguese archaeologist, Est√°cio da Veiga, identified the remnants as being of a fortified town. He observed the presence of several constructions: an elliptical cistern, \\"a great wall that ended at an acute angle as if it were a fortified point,\\" and other smaller structures, enough to indicate a \\"destroyed fortified settlement\\". He collected two gold earrings (4th Century), republican coinage, a bronze of Mercury from the Roman Period (2nd century AD) now in the National Archaeology Museum, Roman amphorae and ceramics and other materials of the Iron Age, Roman age and medieval age. In the early 20th century Father Jos√© Joaquim Nunes discovered a Roman necropolis of imperial times the location of which is unknown today. In 1992, a section of Monte Moli√£o was destroyed by an extension of National Road 125. In 2005, drilling and geophysical surveys were carried out.

These family traditions have rich and multifaceted features such as loyalty, mutual love, honesty, respect for the elder people and parents and tolerance. Every person in the family must adhere to his or her personal status, rules, relationships and principles like in the mutual relations in the society.  Family structure of Azerbaijan  The Azerbaijani people have a unique family type. In general, the Azerbaijani family type is a unique one not only in the West, but also in the East. Because, Azerbaijan has tradition as a parent-child relationship, to respect for adults and it has preserved fundamental national values from ancient times to today. 75-80 percent of young people pay attention to parental advice and respect them. In some countries, after a child reaches certain age, parents force them to live independently. This situation affects the family relationship. Because family is such an institution that commitment should not be broken. Azerbaijan has very few such cases. In majority of cases, children live with parents until they get married. There are few people, who live with their parents after the marriage. Each family member must fulfill owned responsibilities, and should do everything for family, respect and care for family members, share the family's joy and sorrow, be loyal to the common tradition and rules available in their region. The society is developing due to existence of true families. Until the beginning of the 20th century, a big family was very common. The big family was based on blood consanguinity. These family type of kinship ties are strong, family leadership belongs to the man or elderly man, and he carries the responsibility of his family. The eldest son receives the greatest share of the heritage, and after the death of his father he becomes the head of the family. Before the 20th century, the Azerbaijani family historically consisted of two forms in general terms. The first was the broad patriarchal families in which the representatives of the two or three generations lived in the 19th century together with their father, mother and married boys. The second one was the small families which consist of husbands and wives and children. It is possible to find examples of large family structure in Azerbaijan in the late 19th century and early 20th century, or even in the early years of the Soviet era. In such families, orphan children would grow up under the influence of their uncle. The real estate was shared within the family according to the Shari'a law and principles. The share of inheritance for male children was more than the inheritance for female children. = Modern family model of Azerbaijan = Azerbaijani families can be divided into two groups according to the 20th and the beginning of the 21st centuries: 1) Family living in districts or villages, suitable for national family mentality; 2) Families living in bigger cities, e.g. in Baku or in different countries of the world. Earlier, there were lots of families with 5-10 members. Moreover, families were staying close to relatives such as aunt, uncle, grandfather, grandmother etc. Now, not too much of this is left. As of the end of the 80's, only a very small family type with three children began to increase. Now, most of children do not have relatives such as aunt, uncle, and cousin. For example, an honorary title \\"mother heroine\\" in the 1990s awarded for looking after and raising a large family with 10 children, was abolished in 1990s after the collapse of SSRI. After the gaining independence mothers with four or five children were regarded as \\"mother heroine\\". But nowadays, Azerbaijan are consist of majority of families with 2 and 3 children  Woman in Azerbaijani family  The Azerbaijani woman has a special place in protecting the integrity of the family. Everyone is obliged to the mother because of their life and their existence. The word \\"mother\\" is holy, that is why native land is called motherland, where human was born and grew up. Mother is the backbone of the family. The happiness of every family depends primarily on the role of the mother and her activities. The status of women in Azerbaijan has undergone several major changes over the past few millennia. Nevertheless, women in Azerbaijan provided many solutions to issues related to different periods of the history of country. The Azerbaijan Democratic Republic created in 1918, was providing gender equality rights to people living in the country. Thus, Azerbaijan became the first country in the East to accept the women rights to vote. A number of events are being held in Azerbaijan on the occasion of International Family Day, which is celebrated worldwide and aimed at directing people's attention to family problems on 15 May every year. The selection of exemplary families at the \\"Family Holiday\\", organized by the State Committee for Family, Women and Children Affairs, as well as holding ceremonies in different regions of the country has become a good tradition. At present there are 1 million 831 thousand 100 families in the country. Over the past five years, the poverty rate has been reduced from 49 to 13 percent and 766,000 new vacant jobs have been created. Particular attention is paid to the creation of conditions for the comprehensive development of the family and the solution of their various problems. = Marriage age = The Family Code, such as the allowed marriage age for girls was risen from 17 to 18 in 2011. According to the new rules, forcing a woman to marry will be faced with either fine of two to three thousand manats or arrest up to 2 years. If the same situation committed against person under 18, the amount of fine will be from three to four thousand manats and arrest period is up to 4 years.  Laws  Azerbaijan joined the International Conventions on the strengthening of family, protection of women and children's rights, and accepted the relevant laws in Republic in the 1990s. In addition, Azerbaijan joined International Labor Organization (ILO) Recommendation #156 on \\"Equal opportunities and equal treatment for men and women workers - employees with family responsibilities\\", the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, ‚Äúon the rights of the child‚Äù, ‚Äúon the protection of children related to inter-country adoption and cooperation‚Äù, \\"on Minimum age for Employment of Children in Agriculture\\", \\" on prohibition of child labor worst forms and urgent measures to eliminate child labor\\" and other conventions. The laws on \\"Family agriculture\\", \\"Children's rights\\", \\"Prevention of limitations on disabled children and their health, Rehabilitation and social protection of disabled children\\", \\"Social protection of children who lost their parents\\", \\"Nutrition of infants and young children\\", \\"About compulsory dispensary for children‚Äù, The \\"Transnational organized crime\\" of UN\\", Convention on the prevention, suppression and punishment of human trafficking, especially women and children\\", \\"on Approval of the protocols against illegal crossing of migrants by land, sea and air \\", ‚Äúabout the citizenship of a married woman \\", \\"on regulation of human rights and freedom in the Azerbaijani Republic, \\" About social services for the elderly\\", \\"on the legal status of children born out of wedlock \\",\\" On social protection of families with children \\"and others have been accepted.  The Code of Azerbaijani family  This Code defines standards governing the establishment and strengthening of family relationships, the principles of breaking relationships, the rights and duties of family members, the responsibilities of public authorities in this field, as well as the rules of state registration of civil status acts, in accordance with the fundamental human and civil rights and freedom envisaged in the Constitution of the Republic of Azerbaijan.  State Committee for Family, Women and Children Affairs of Azerbaijan Republic  The State Committee for Family, Women and Children Affairs was created by the Decree of the Azerbaijani President on February 6, 2006 and Hijran Huseynova was appointed Chairman of the Committee by the Decree of the President dated February 6, 2006.

Formed in 1986, the corps served as part of the 6th Independent Air Defense Army and then the 6th Air and Air Defense Forces Army from 1998. It was headquartered near Leningrad and controlled both interceptor and surface-to-air missile units. It was reorganized into the 2nd Air Defense Brigade in 2009, the 2nd Aerospace Defense Brigade in 2013, and the 2nd Air Defense Division in 2014.  History  = Cold War = The 54th Air Defense Corps was formed in the spring of 1986 after the 18th Air Defense Corps was expanded into the 6th Independent Air Defense Army in a return to the organizational system of the 1960s and 1970s. It was headquartered in the village of Khvoyny near Taytsy, the former headquarters of the 18th Corps. It included two interceptor fighter aviation regiments: the MiG-31-equipped 180th Guards at Gromovo, and the MiG-23-equipped 177th at Lodeynoye Pole. The corps also included five surface-to-air missile-armed anti-aircraft rocket brigades: the 83rd at Zelenogorsk-4, the 82nd at Gostilitsy near Lomonosov, the 84th at Vaganovo, the 86th at Stekelyanny near Ulyanovka (Sablino), and the 204th Guards at Korstovo, Kingiseppsky District. Five anti-aircraft rocket regiments were also a part of the corps: the 169th Guards at Kornevo near Vsevolozhsk, the 219th at Pervomayskoye-1, the 341st at Lopukhinka-2 near Gostilitsy, the 555th at Ostrov-2 (Tishino), and the 967th at Tikhvin. The 46th Radio- Technical Brigade at Khvoyny provided radar coverage for the corps. On 28 May 1987, the forces of the corps were alerted when Mathias Rust's aircraft appeared on Soviet radar. The commanders of three battalions from the 204th Brigade reported that they were tracking the aircraft and were ready to launch missiles, but they were not given permission to fire, and Rust slipped through the air defense system. = Russian service = The 219th, 341st, and 967th Regiments were disbanded in 1993. On 15 February of that year, the 169th Guards Regiment was disbanded and its lineage transferred to the 86th Brigade, which briefly became the 157th Guards Anti-Aircraft Rocket Brigade and in 1994 was redesignated the 1490th Guards Anti-Aircraft Rocket Regiment. In 1994, the 204th Brigade was reorganized as the 1491st Guards Anti-Aircraft Rocket Regiment, and after it was disbanded in 1998 its lineage transferred to the 1489th Regiment, the former 84th Brigade, which became the 1489th Guards. Also in 1994, the 83rd Brigade became the 1488th Regiment, and around the same time the 82nd Brigade combined with the 158th Guards Anti-Aircraft Rocket Brigade, relocated from Latvia, to become the 500th Guards Anti-Aircraft Rocket Regiment. On 1 June 1998, the 6th Independent Air Defense Army merged with the 76th Air Army to form the 6th Air and Air Defense Forces Army. The corps became part of the combined unit. The 159th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment at Besovets joined the corps by 2000. On 1 July 2002, the 180th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment was disbanded. In 2006, the 141st Anti-Aircraft Rocket Brigade at Nenimyaki was transferred from the Ground Forces to the corps and became the 1544th Anti-Aircraft Rocket Regiment, subsequently relocated to Vladimirsky Lager. In 2008, the 170th Radio-Technical Brigade at Petrozavodsk, previously transferred to the corps, was reorganized as the 334th Radio- Technical Regiment. In 2009, the corps was converted into the 2nd Air Defense Brigade as part of the reform of the Russian Air Forces, and became part of the 1st Air and Air Defense Forces Command. At the same time, the 46th Brigade was converted into the 333rd Radio-Technical Regiment. The 159th Guards and the 177th Fighter Aviation Regiments were disbanded as part of the reforms, leaving the new brigade with no interceptor units.

The hydrographic slope of Lake Theodat is accessible through the forest road from Matagami which passes on the west side of Evans Lake. The surface of the lake is generally frozen from early November to mid-May, however safe ice circulation is generally from mid-November to mid-April.  Geography  This lake has a length of . Its outline is in the form of a lying anchor, a maximum width of and an altitude of . Lake Theodat has many bays, peninsulas and about 43 islands. The Theodat lake is crossed to the West by the Th√©odat River. Lake Theodat is supplied in its eastern part by the discharge of the Th√©odat River, by a discharge (coming from the East) of lakes and by another discharge (coming from the North) draining a zone of marsh. The mouth of this lake Th√©odat discharges towards the West to join Le Gardeur Lake. The mouth of Theodat Lake is located at the bottom of a bay on the West bank, at: * East of the mouth of the Th√©odat River; * Northeast of downtown Matagami; * Northeast of Soscumica Lake.Distances from the Department of Natural Resources Canada's Atlas of Canada (published on the Internet). The main hydrographic slopes near Lake Th√©odat are: *North side: Legoff Lake, Marte River, Nemiscau River; *East side: Lake T√©s√©cau, Lake Camousichouane; *South side: Broadback River, Salamandre River, Nipukatasi River; *West side: Evans Lake, Chabinoche River. Toponymy Several designations of this body of water have been known since the beginning of the 20th century. The map of the province of Quebec (1911) by James White, accompanying the ninth report of the Geographical Survey of Canada, refers to this waterbody \\"L. Geikie\\", of unknown origin. The \\"Dictionary of Rivers and Lakes of the Province of Quebec\\" (edition of 1914) uses the designation \\"Lake Geikie\\" under the heading \\"Mill River\\" (today Th√©odat). The 1925 edition of the same book designates this lake \\"Lake Eikie\\". In addition, maps of the southern Quebec leaflet published in 1924 and 1935 by the Department of Lands and Forests and, in 1940, by the Ministry of Lands and Forests, Hunting and Fishing, identify this water body \\"L. Mill\\". The 1933 and 1941 editions of the map of the Abitibi and Mistassini Territories published by the Department of Lands and Forests, designate this lake \\"Mishagomish Lake\\", Cree origin name meaning \\"large expanse of water\\" . In 1945, the Geography Commission announced its intention to choose a definitive name to designate the water body and also the river, noting that the new name could be none of those then known. Even francified in the form Michagomiche, the aboriginal toponym remained a problematic choice given names of the same root used in the same region as this lake. Two years later, the Geography Commission attributes the term Theodat to the lake and its emissary. Theodatus evokes the life work of Gabriel Sagard, baptized Th√©odat, recollet brother and missionary in Huronie in 1623 and 1624. He was born between 1590 and 1595 and died in France around 1636.

As a two-year-old in 2006 she was one of the best fillies of her generation in Ireland when she won three of eight races including the Moyglare Stud Stakes and the Goffs Million as well as finishing third in the Phoenix Stakes. She ran unplaced in the 1000 Guineas in the following spring and was retired from racing later that year. Background Miss Beatrix is a bay mare bred in Ireland by Bill Durkan. As a yearling in September 2005 she was offered for sale at Goffs and was \\"bought\\" for ‚Ç¨180,000 by the trainer Kevin Prendergast. Prendergast was in fact acting on behalf of the filly's breeder so that no money actually changed hands. During her racing career she was trained by Prendergast and owned Durkan. She was ridden in all but two of her races by Declan McDonogh. She was sired by Danehill Dancer, who won the Phoenix Stakes, National Stakes and Greenham Stakes before becoming a very successful breeding stallion. His other progeny have included Choisir, Mastercraftsman, Legatissimo, Lillie Langtry and Dancing Rain. Her dam Miss Beabea was a sprinting mare who won the Blenheim Stakes and finished second to Johannesburg in the Phoenix Stakes. Her dam Lady Ellen was a half-sister to Indian Ridge. Racing career =2006: two-year-old season= On her racecourse debut, Miss Beatrix started 5/2 favourite for a maiden race over five furlongs on heavy ground at the Curragh on 26 March. She finished third behind Drayton and Latin Walk but was later promoted to second after the winner failed a drug test. On 6 June she contested a similar event at Tipperary Racecourse and came home third of the thirteen runners behind City of Tribes and Rabatash. Eight days after her defeat at Tipperary, the filly was stepped up in distance for a maiden over seven furlongs on good to firm ground at Leopardstown Racecourse and started 4/6 favourite against nine opponents. She took the lead two furlongs from the finish and won \\"easily\\" by three and a half lengths from Evening Rushour. Miss Beatrix was stepped up in class and started favourite for the Listed Woodpark & Ballysheehan Studs Stakes at the Curragh on 30 June but made little impact and finished seventh behind the Jim Bolger-trained Gaudeamus. On 19 July the filly produced a much better effort in the Silver Flash Stakes at Leopardstown leading for most of the way before being overtaken in the closing stages and finishing second to the favourite Chanting. Miss Beatrix was then stepped up to Group 1 class and started a 50/1 outsider in a seven-runner field for the Phoenix Stakes over six furlongs at the Curragh on 13 August. Ridden by Willie Supple she belied her odds as she finished strongly to take third place behind Holy Roman Emperor and the Coventry Stakes winner Hellvelyn. Supple was again in the saddle when the filly returned to the Curragh for the Moyglare Stud Stakes two weeks later. The form of her run in the Phoenix Stakes had been boosted earlier that afternoon when the sixth-placed Rabatash won the Group 3 Round Tower Stakes. The Dermot Weld-trained Supposition started favourite ahead of Simply Perfect while Miss Beatrix was made a 14/1 outsider. The other nine runners included Gaudeamus, Brazilian Bride (Fillies' Sprint Stakes) and Alexander Tango. After being held up at the rear of the field Miss Beatrix made rapid progress in the last quarter mile and took the lead in the final strides to win by a short head from the British challenger Silca Chieve. Kevin Prendergast said \\"She should have been second in the Phoenix Stakes, but she didn't follow the leader through, so when I saw the sixth win the Group 3 here today, I thought she must have a big chance\\". Supple commented \\"The boss has done a wonderful job. She settled much better today and I always felt we'd get there\\". On 19 September Miss Beatrix was one of 28 juveniles to contest the Goffs Million, a race restricted to horses sold at the Goffs sales, which carried a first prize of ‚Ç¨985,000, making it the most valuable race for two- year-olds in Europe. She started the 6/1 second favourite behind Fly Free in a field which also included Finsceal Beo, Drumfire (Solario Stakes) and He's A Decoy (Rochestown Stakes). The field split into two separate groups on either side of the course with Mis Beatrix racing towards the rear of those on the far side (the right hand side from the jockeys viewpoint) before making a forward move two furlongs out. She took the lead approaching the final furlong, opened up a clear lead and won \\"comfortably\\" by one and a quarter lengths from Regime, with Drumfire taking third ahead of Emerald Hill. Prendergast said I thought she might have improved from the Moyglare, but it's dangerous to think like that at this time of year. Only the man above knows the score. Anything this filly achieves next year will be a bonus, but she has taken her racing well and she will be aimed at the Guineas\\". =2007: three- year-old season= Miss Beatrix made her first and only appearance of 2007 in the 194th running of the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket Racecourse on 6 May. She started the 12/1 fifth choice in the betting but was ever in serious contention and finished 18th of the 21 runners, twenty-five lengths behind the winner Finsceal Beo. Prendergast reported that the filly came out of race \\"very flat and very sick\\" and despite hopes that she would return later in the year for a sprint campaign she never raced again. Breeding record At the end of her racing career, Miss Beatrix was retired to become a broodmare for her owner's stud. She has produced eight foals and two winners: *Oh So Lucy, a bay filly, foaled in 2009, sired by Galileo. Failed to win in seven races. *Korantam, bay colt, 2010, by Galileo.

Mayo surrendered the city to the Union Army on April 3, 1865, and was twice deposed by Union generals during the military occupation and Congressional Reconstruction. Early and family life Joseph Mayo was born on November 16, 1795 at Powhatan Seat, a plantation in Henrico County, Virginia about two miles east of what would become downtown Richmond.Virginius Dabney, Richmond: the Story of a City (Doubleday and Co., 1976), p. 17http://wmpeople.wm.edu/asset/index/scotto/fultonmeminpdf His background was intertwined with the city and with slavery. His father, Joseph Mayo (1771-1820), grandfather and great-grandfather shared the same name; his mother was Jane Poythress (1773-1837), also of what would later be called the First Families of Virginia. Joe Mayo had an elder brother Philip Mayo (1793-1857) and younger brothers Peter Poythress Mayo (1797-1857), Judge Robert Mayo (1807- _) of Westmoreland County, Virginia, and John Bland Mayo (1812-1868), as well as sisters Agnes (b. 1831), Elizabeth Mayo (b. 1804-1864), Lucy Ann Mayo and Martha Tabb Mayo. His paternal great grandfather, Joseph Mayo, had helped found the town of Richmond, working with his brother William Mayo (who surveyed the lots), and William Byrd (who owned the land and built his own stately mansion). During Henrico County's first personal property census, in 1783 (two years before the birth of the future Mayor Mayo), the first Joseph Mayo owned 37 enslaved persons, compared to the county's largest slaveowner, Peter Randolph (who owned 74 enslaved persons) and about a dozen other wealthy individuals (including the estate of lawyer Robert Carter Nicholas which owned 41 slaves).Louis H. Manarin and Clifford Dowdey, The History of Henrico County (University Press of Virginia 1984) p. 164 His son John Mayo (1769-1818) (this Mayor Joseph Mayo's uncle) built the first bridge across the James River to Manchester (annexed to the City of Richmond, long after Mayor Mayo's demise).https://www.ancestry.com/boards/thread.aspx?mv=flat&m;=1091&p;=surnames.mayo A lawyer (as would be his great-grandson), Joseph Mayo wrote a will in 1780 in which he attempted to free his slaves (as was illegal at the time, so he asked his executors to seek special legislation after his death to free them), and as an alternative asked his executors to divide them among named relatives. Litigation ensued after his death, which went before the Virginia Supreme Court. In November 1791 (two years before young Joe Mayo was born), the judges decided that Mayo's slaves were freed by special legislation and divided the rest of the property among the named heirs (his descendants as well as those of his brother and Paul Carrington).Mayo v.

A civic booster, he wrote a city guide in 1820. In 1832, Richmond opened the reservoir and pump house that Mayo had advocated for firefighting purposes.William Asbury Christian, Richmond: her Past and Present (1912, reprinted 1973 by The Reprint Company of Spartanburg, South Carolina) p. 115 In 1846, Richmond voters elected Mayo to represent them in the Virginia House of Delegates (a part-time positions). Re-elected several times until his election as Mayor disqualified him from legislative service, Mayo was ultimately replaced by Thomas P. August, who had represented Richmond in the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1850 and would later be elected to the Virginia Senate.Cynthia Miller Leonard, Virginia General Assembly 1619-1978 (Richmond: Virginia State Library 1978)pp. 423, 427, 432, 437 In December 1851, Mayo became president of the new Southern Rights Association of Richmond; the association opposed abolitionists, with D.H. London as its original President and W.F. Ritchie as secretary.Christian p. 172 Meanwhile, after the new 1851 state constitution broadened suffrage, Richmond's voters elected Joseph Mayo to the city council in 1852. When the city's mayor of more than a decade, General William Lambert, died on March 23, 1852, the city's recorder Samuel T. Pulliam became the interim mayor, then voters elected Joseph Mayo as Lambert's successor.compare Christian p. 178 and http://www.palmspringsbum.org/genealogy/getperson.php?personID=I61125&tree;=LegendsThe marble inscription of Richmond's mayors included among the findagrave pictures for David J. Saunders does not include Pulliam's middle initial; documents of Samuel H. Pulliam indicate it was his father Samuel T. Pulliam Although challenged by bricklayer Martin Meredith Lipscomb, mayor Mayo won re-election easily in 1853, so in the next election Lipscomb instead ran against city sergeant John Milton Fergusson, a fifteen year veteran whom he defeated in 1854. In 1855 and 1856, Mayo ran on a unified Know Nothing Party ticket with Lipscomb.Gregg D. Kimball, American City, Southern Place: a cultural history of antebellum Richmond (University of Georgia Press 2000) p. 12 In 1853, Mayo spoke at festivities marking the first anniversary of the locomotive shop added to the Tredegar Iron Works. The Tredegar Iron Works had been founded by Joseph Reid Anderson (who would represent Richmond in the House of Delegates for several terms). Other speakers included councilman Samuel D. Denoon (who had founded a brass foundry after rising from artisan ranks), Whig A. Judson Crane and New York born Oliver P. Baldwin (editor of the Richmond Republican and the state senator representing Richmond in 1855-1856).Kimball pp. 175-176 Mayor Mayo continued to promote Richmond. He ordered new fire engines after a fire destroyed the Virginia Woolen Mills and Haxall Mills in the summer of 1853, and in 1857 ordered out the Young Guard and artillery to protect a prisoner accused of assaulting a child (the convicted defendant was later sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment). He also led many public meetings, including dedication of the new equestrian statue of General George Washington in Capitol Square in 1858 and greeted the Prince of Wales during the royal visit of 1860.Christian pp. 179, 188, 191, 209 American Civil War Mayo remained Richmond's mayor throughout the American Civil War. On May 29, 1861, Mayor Mayo greeted Confederate President Jefferson Davis, and with the City Council arranged to give him a refurbished mansion originally built by Dr. Brockenbrough (and later owned by J.A. Seddon) for use as the White House of the Confederacy.Christian pp. 222-223 Mayor Mayo chaired a public meeting after the First Battle of Manassas in 1861 to arrange for the transport and care of wounded soldiers. By the year's end Mayor Mayo helped Richmond's city council loan the Confederate States $50,000 as well as appropriate $10,000 to fortify the city. Mayo also continued to preside over the Mayor's Court, and became known for his authoritarian manner, especially for stern treatment (including whippings) of free blacks accused of non-felonies (such as stealing small amounts).Nelson Lankford, Richmond Burning: the Last Days of the Confederate Capital (Viking, 2002) p. 52 As Richmond's mayor, Mayo had vowed eternal defiance as Union troops approached within sight of his city during the Peninsular Campaign in mid-1862. On May 15, 1862, Mayo spoke at a public meeting called by Governor John Letcher and helped organized the city's defenses, including organizing a Home Guard of all males between 16 and 18 and over 45 years old.Christian p. 231 Although Union forces retreated after the Battle of Seven Pines, food shortages plagued less wealthy residents of the Confederate capital. On March 13, 1863, a factory on Brown's Island in the James River that manufactured ammunition for Confederate troops exploded and burned down, killing many women and girls, so Mayor Mayo organized donations to assist their families.http://twoexplosions.umwblogs.org/richmond-browns- island-march-13-1863/aftermath-of-the-explosion-and-counting-the-dead/ Weeks later, on April 2, 1863, Mayor Mayo addressed a crowd of women and young boys marching on the Confederate commissary and plundering food from stores. After speeches by President Jefferson Davis, Governor Letcher and bishop McGill also failed to stop the rioters, the Public Guard led by Captain Gay, fired upon and dispersed them.Christian p. 241https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/05/the-richmond-bread-riot/ While Mayo's only son, lawyer Abel U. Mayo, did not serve in the military (possibly because of his age), two of his brother Robert's lawyer sons rose from initial commissions as Majors in the Confederate States Army to full colonels, and also held Virginia government offices after the war. Nephew Joseph Campbell Mayo Jr.,http://antietam.aotw.org/officers.php?officer_id=706 mis-interprets the middle name a Virginia Military Institute graduate, commanded the 3rd Virginia Infantry, including at the Battle of Antietam (in which he was wounded) and surrendered at Appomattox Courthouse at the war's end, ultimately becoming Virginia State Treasurer in 1872.https://civilwartalk.com/threads/the-streets-of-richmond.125873 His brother Robert Murphy Mayo, another VMI graduate, served in the 47th Virginia Infantry before becoming a member of the Virginia House of Delegates and (briefly) the U.S. House of Representatives. On April Fool's Day, 1865, Mayor Mayo protested when he heard about Confederate General Robert E. Lee's order of several weeks previous, that evacuating troops should destroy all government-owned cotton, tobacco and military stores in the city. Major Isaac Carrington had reported to General Richard Ewell even before the defeat at the Battle of Five Forks that Richmond warehouses contained little cotton but much tobacco. Furthermore, ordinance officer Josiah Gorgas had suggested ruining the tobacco by pouring turpentine over it, which would not endanger surrounding buildings if it were burned.Lankford, p. 56 The following day, President Jefferson Davis invited Mayor Mayo and Virginia's Governor William \\"Extra Billy\\" Smith to attend a cabinet meeting before the Confederate officeholders left by rail for Danville, Virginia. Thus, Mayo heard orders to pack up remaining vital Confederate archives and to prepare for evacuation.William C. Davis, An Honorable Defeat: the Last Days of the Confederate Government (Harcourt Inc.2001) p. 58. However, the book consistently misstates the mayor's first name as John. Mayor Mayo also called a city council meeting that afternoon, where members agreed that to destroy liquor in the city, lest drunken residents sack Richmond as the troops left.Lankford, p. 71, 77 The meeting also ordered the city's gas works shut down as a fire precaution. After the Confederate government left Richmond on April 2, 1865, the departing troops burned the tobacco storehouses as mayor Mayo and city council president David J. Saunders had feared. The resulting conflagration destroyed much of the city. Early the following morning, Mayo rode his carriage eastward out of the city, seeking a Union officer to whom to surrender Richmond, as well as plead for assistance in suppressing the fire. His carriage passed the last Confederate unit evacuating Richmond, led by Gen. Martin Gary of South Carolina, who passed westward and would cross the burning Mayo bridge before it collapsed into the James River. Near the intersection of the Osborne Turnpike and New Market Road, At Tree Hill Farm about two miles from the city center and three miles from the Virginia Capitol building,http://www.richmond.com/from-the-archives/from-the-archives-tree- hill-farm-country-living- with-a/collection_12bff7f8-df57-11e6-b601-8b852c6b4ad5.html#10 mayor Mayo encountered Union Major Atherton Stevens and his 40 men of the 4th Massachusetts Cavalry. The mayor handed over a surrender note (written by another but signed with Mayo's characteristic flourish). After receiving assurances that the Union army would protect people and property, mayor Mayo accompanied the mounted troops into his city. When they reached the city hall, Major Stevens dictated orders to protect inhabitants and property.Lankford pp. 118-119 About an hour later, Stevens' commanding officer, Gen. Godfrey Weitzel, rode with his staff on the same turnpike into Richmond, and mayor Mayo repeated the symbolic surrender. Gen. Weitzel then filled out a military telegraph form for his commander, General Ulysses S. Grant, disclosing the city's surrender at 8:15 a.m., the fires, and the enthusiastic reception his troops received.Lankford p. 133Dabney pp. 190-193 After President Lincoln's assassination (which happened on the same day Confederate General Robert E. Lee returned to Richmond to great acclaim), General Grant ordered mayor Mayo arrested, along with any city councilor who had likewise not yet taken the oath of allegiance.Lankford p. 221 However, when the Union-sympathizing Virginia Governor, Francis Pierpont, arrived in Richmond on May 26, he allowed Mayo to resume office.Dabney p. 201 Thus, on June 7, the mayor's court reopened for the first time since April 1. It then suspended again on June 13 until after the election, while the Virginia General Assembly met to reorganize the city government and remove certain constitutional restrictions.Christian p. 272 When Congressional Reconstruction began, Virginia's military administrator, Gen. John Turner, hearing complaints about vigilantes rounding up blacks and charging them as vagrants in the mayor's court, where mayor Meyo threatened to return them to slavery, instructed his subordinates not to obey directions from mayor Mayo or other city officials.Michael A. Chesson, Richmond After the War\\" 1865-1890 (Virginia State Library1981 p.92 Governor Pierpont formally removed mayor Mayo from office, then on July 3, 1865 appointed city council president David J. Saunders Richmond's mayor to replace him. However, when municipal elections were held on April 6, 1866, voters attempted to return Mayo to office.

Death and legacy In his final years, Mayo suffered \\"softening of the brain\\" (dementia), and was placed in an asylum. The Mayo family lost control of their Powhatan Seat plantation in 1866, and the structure was demolished in the 20th century.

Manly Miles was born at Homer, New York, the son of Manly Miles, a soldier of the Revolution, and Mary Cushman, a lineal descendant of Miles Standish. In 1837 his family moved to Flint, Michigan, where he worked on the farm, to his common school education adding reading and study during spare moments. In 1850 he graduated M.D. from Rush Medical College, Chicago, and practiced in Flint till 1859, when he was appointed by Governor Moses Wisner assistant state geologist in the department of zoology. In 1860 he was appointed professor of animal physiology and zoology in the Michigan State Agricultural College at Lansing. While in the zoological department of the Geological State Survey he was in constant correspondence with the leading naturalists of the period, as Agassiz, Cope, Lea, and discovered two new shells, two others being named after him by Lea. His catalogue was by far the most complete of any then compiled. In 1864 the duties of \\"acting superintendent of the farm\\" were added to his chair while in 1865 he became professor of animal physiology and practical agriculture and also farm superintendent. In 1869 he ceased to teach physiology, devoting his entire time to practical agriculture, being far ahead of his time. In 1875 he resigned to accept the professorship of agriculture in the University of Illinois. Later he moved to Houghton Farm, near Mountainville, New York, and devoted himself entirely to scientific experiments, though afterwards he accepted the professorship of agriculture in the Massachusetts Agricultural College at Amherst (now the University of Massachusetts Amherst). In 1886 he returned to Lansing to investigate, study and write until his death. Among his appointments and memberships were: membership in the Michigan State Medical Society; member of the Buffalo Society of Natural Science; of the Entomological Society of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; fellow of the Royal Microscopical Society, and of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Dr. R. C. Kedzie, who entered the Agricultural College two years later than Miles, said that he found \\"Dr. Miles an authority among both professors and students, on birds, beasts, reptiles, stones of the fields and insects of the air.\\" To his death he retained his habits of investigation and study, though his great deafness rendered his public work difficult. Miles was the first professor of practical agriculture in the United States. On February 15, 1851, he married Mary E. Dodge, of Lansing, Michigan, who survived him. Manly Miles died at Lansing, Michigan, February 15, 1898, from fatty degeneration of the heart. He was a constant writer and advisor of the American Agriculturalist and wrote many books on practical agriculture.

She was married to Mark Wilks who was sent to jail for her refusal to pay tax and his refusal to make his wife tell him how much she earned. Life Wilks was born in De Montfort Square in Leicester to John and Sarah Annie Bennett. She attended the university of London and when she left in 1896 she was a qualified doctor and she had a degree in surgery. The same year she married Mark Wilks who was a London teacher.Hilary Frances, ‚ÄòWilks , Elizabeth (1861‚Äì1956)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 25 Nov 2017 The Women's Tax Resistance League badge: \\"No Vote No Tax!\\" Wilks was a founder member of the Women's Tax Resistance League which was a group who objected particularly to women paying tax to a government over which they had no electoral control. Wilks became the treasurer of the organisation whose motto was \\"No Vote No Tax!\\". Wilks came to notice when she refused to pay her tax in 1908. Married women were not required to pay taxes per se in Britain at that time. According to the law a married couple's joint income was added together and the husband paid the tax. However Elizabeth, who as a doctor, earned more than her husband, refused to tell her husband how much she earned. This put the authorities into a quandary as Elizabeth was not liable to pay tax and her husband was nominally willing to pay the tax but he said that he had no idea how much to pay. There was no legal requirement for Elizabeth to tell her husband about her income. In 1910 the authorities illegally seized some of her goods in an attempt to levy the tax on her income. The authorities then tried to claim the tax either from them as a couple or by her husband alone. This was legally unsatisfactory as Mark was being asked for tax on her income (of about ¬£600 per annum) that he was nominally unaware of. 3,000 teachers signed a petition when Mark Wilks was placed in Brixton Jail and there was a demonstration in Trafalgar Square to protest at his treatment. He was released after a fortnight to a celebrations at Caxton Hall from the supporters of the Women's Tax Resistance League. His support included the writer George Bernard Shaw. Despite a debate in the House of Lords where it was realised that the law was unfair, British law did not get amended until 1972. The Wilks moved to the village of Headley Down in Hampshire where Elizabeth was concerned by the quality of the public housing in 1933. She raised the money to build sixteen new residences which were managed by the newlyformed Headley Public Utility Society. Wilks died in Headley Down in 1956 and she left her home and ten acres of woodland to the Headley Public Utility Society. The residences were given to the local authority but the Headley PUS still maintains the woodlands for public benefit.

The project did not receive government support and only one Sp.1 was built. Design and development The designer of the Samolot Sp.1 was Piotr Tulacz, the technical director of Samolot. A private venture, it was intended to be a research development vehicle for a more powerful fighter aircraft and, in addition, to demonstrate to the Government that high performance aircraft could be built with Polish materials. The Samolot Sp.1 was a braced parasol wing monoplane. Its two-part wing, rectangular in plan apart from blunted tips, was moderately thick. Each half-wing was built around a pair of wooden spars and was covered with plywood, then joined centrally and supported just above the fuselage on cabane struts. Primary wing bracing was provided on each side by a parallel pair of steel struts, enclosed in wooden streamlined cladding, from the lower fuselage to the wing spars. It had been designed to accept radial engines in the power range and when the Sp.I was completed in the mid-1926 the only available engine was an elderly six-cylinder Anzani 6A-4 which gave . This was housed under a circular cross-section metal cowling with its cylinder heads protruding for cooling. The cowling blended smoothly into the rest of the fuselage which was a thick ply-skinned semi-monocoque, tapering to the rear. The pilot's open cockpit was just behind the trailing edge of the wing, where there was a small cut-out to improve his field of view. The Sp.1's tailplane and fin were integral parts of the fuselage and also ply covered, as were the control surfaces; the elevators were divided. The Sp.I had a conventional, fixed undercarriage with a track of . The mainwheels were on a single axle with rubber-cord shock absorbers, mounted on steel V struts from the fuselage at the base of the wing struts. These struts, like the wing bracing, were clad in wood streamlining. The first flight, flown by Samolot's chief test-pilot Edmond Holodynski at Poznan-Lawica, was in July 1926. Further flight-testing showed a lack of power but also some handling problems and instabilities. The latter were soon corrected by a reduction in fuselage length and some rudder modifications and the aircraft was re-engined with a Salmson 9Ac, a nine-cylinder modern radial. As a result, the Sp.I handled well and bettered its calculated performance. Despite its good performance, Samolot failed to get Government funding and Sp.I development was abandoned. It did leave a legacy, in that some of the engineers who had worked on its design subsequently joined the design team of the successful PWS-10, another braced parasol wing aircraft.

He wrestled primarily in the National Wrestling Alliance and the American Wrestling Association and is a former NWA World Junior Heavyweight Champion. Professional wrestling career Jim Osborn began wrestling in the early 1960s under the ring name Paddy Osborne for Gulas Wrestling Enterprises and the NWA Tri-State territory. He switched to his real name in 1963 and spent his rookie years competing primarily for NWA Tri-State, \\"Wrestling Promotions, Inc.\\" in Arizona, the Gulf Athletic Club in Houston. From there, he worked San Francisco, Arizona and Los Angeles and Georgia Championship as \\"Red Osborn\\". On August 10, 1967, Osborn and Johnny Kostas captured the NWA Pacific Northwest Tag Team Championship in the Pacific Northwest territory. During this time, Osborne also wrestled in Vince J. McMahon's World Wide Wrestling Federation. There, he competed against Pat Patterson in San Francisco on August 12, 1967 in Patterson‚Äôs first bout for the WWWF. The following year, 1968, on July 17, Osborn defeated Mil Mascaras on July 17 for LA's NWA Hollywood territory before heading to the American Wrestling Association. Still competing under his real name, he had notable rivalries with Bob Mulligan and Billy Red Lyons before \\"leaving\\" the promotion. Osborn's absence from the AWA was pre-planned. He returned later the same year in 1970 and teamed with Dr. X (Dick Beyer; perhaps the most hated heel in the AWA's history) as \\"Double X\\". It was an open secret that Double X was indeed Red Osborn and the pair competed as a tag team, using their similar appearances and masked identities to their advantage during matches. On July 18 in St. Paul, Double X was \\"unmasked\\" by AWA's original masked wrestler; Mr. M (Bill Miller). In 1972 Beyer left for a wrestling tour of Japan and Osborn left the Minnesota territory and went to work for Leroy McGuirk and Tri-State in Oklahoma using the ring name \\"Dr. X\\". As Dr. X, Osborn was introduced in Tri- State as a masked man sitting ringside during a televised event who eventually interfered in the aid of the heel wrestlers. Osborn made the Dr. X persona his own and became perhaps the most successful masked heel the McGuirk territory had seen . He defeated Ram√≥n Torres (wrestler) in December 1971 to win the NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship and soon thereafter entered a programme with Danny Hodge, with the two engaging in a series of stiff matches. The rivalry culminated with Hodge capture the Junior Heavyweight title in Shreveport. In January 1973, Osborn traveled to Japan to compete for the Japan Pro Wrestling Alliance (JWA) as Dr. X. He had previously competed in Japan in 1970, headlining bouts with Antonio Inoki under his real name. He would compete primarily with Billy Red Lyons. He returned to the Oklahoma territory in 1977, having notable rivalries with Dick Murdoch and Bill Watts. During this tenure in the late 1970s, Osborn (as Dr. X) competed as a fan favourite and went on to win the NWA United States Tag Team Championship with Porkchop Cash, Cicl√≥n Negro and The Brute respectively.

Frobenius, computes the characters of irreducible representations of the symmetric group Sn. Among the other applications, the formula can be used to derive the hook length formula. In , Arun Ram gives a q-analog of the Frobenius formula.  Statement  Let chi_lambda be the character of an irreducible representation of the symmetric group S_n corresponding to a partition lambda of n: n = lambda_1 + cdots + lambda_k and ell_j = lambda_j + k - j. For each partition mu of n, let C(mu) denote the conjugacy class in S_n corresponding to it (cf. the example below), and let i_j denote the number of times j appears in mu (so Sigma , i_j j = n). Then the Frobenius formula states that the constant value of chi_lambda on C(mu), :chi_lambda(C(mu)), is the coefficient of the monomial x_1^{ell_1} dots x_k^{ell_k} in the homogeneous polynomial : prod_{i < j} (x_i - x_j) prod_j P_j(x_1, dots, x_k)^{i_j}, where P_j(x_1, dots, x_k) = x_1^j + dots + x_k^j is the j-th power sum. Example: Take n = 4 and lambda: 4 = 2 + 2. If mu: 4 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1, which corresponds to the class of the identity element, then chi_lambda(C(mu)) is the coefficient of x_1^3 x_2^2 in :(x_1 - x_2)(x_1 + x_2)^4 which is 2. Similarly, if mu: 4 = 3 + 1 (the class of a 3-cycle times an 1-cycle), then chi_{lambda}(C(mu)), given by :(x_1 - x_2)(x_1 + x_2)(x_1^3 + x_2^3), is ‚àí1.

Through her training with Elsa Gindler's student Lucy Heyer in the 1930s and long career as a physical therapist, Rosen developed a particular approach to the body and eventually began teaching it to others. She synthesized her approach into a system of Rosen Method bodywork, in which a practitioner identifies and works on areas of habitual muscular tension in the client; and movement, which involves a series of gentle movements done to music, as a form of preventative physiotherapy. The Rosen Institute she founded in Berkeley in the 1980s pioneered research into incorporating dance approaches in physical therapy. The institute has affiliate training centers in 16 countries across the world. In her 70-year career as a physiotherapist, Rosen cared for between 30,000 and 40,000 patients.

Emery. It is the only Tudor Revival style building designed by Emory, and only one of two fraternity houses that he designed. The building features ornamental half- timbering and stucco veneered walls, a steeply pitched roof with two separate cross-gabled sections, and a two-story wing that is oriented diagonally from the main body of the house. Three of the four-floors are above grade and one is exposed on the back side via the sloping lot. The Iowa Beta chapter of Sigma Phi Epsilon was chartered on April 20, 1916. It was the fraternity's fortieth local chapter. During World War II part of the building was rented to female students as many male students left to join the military. A fire damaged the third floor in 1943. In 1952, the kitchen and the house mother's quarters were expanded. Journalist Robert L. Bartley resided here until his graduation from Iowa State in 1959.

This area features a variety of residences in both high and common styles, from the elaborate home of armsmaker Samuel Colt to multi-unit apartment houses, many of which were built between about 1860 and 1900. The district is roughly triangular, extending from South Green along Main Street and Wethersfield Avenue to include Morris, Dean, and Alden Streets. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. Description and history What is now the South Green, south of downtown Hartford at Main Street and Maple Avenue, was allocated as common pasture land by the city in 1642. The home of early political leader George Wyllys stood nearby, and that family's prominence in the area gave Wyllys Street (the southern boundary of the green) its name. In 1850, Solomon Porter led a push to increase development in this area, and in 1854 the city boundary (originally at Wyllys Street) was moved south. Wethersfield Avenue was built with large Italianate homes, mainly in brick, for wealthier buyers, while the side streets were built out with more modest single and multifamily residences. Most of the construction in the early 20th century was apartment blocks; one of these was designed by George Dunkelberger, the designer of the bridges on the Merritt Parkway, and exhibits a similar flair for the whimsical. Non-residential buildings in the district include three churches, a small number of commercial buildings, and a modest number of small light industrial buildings. The district is bordered by three other historic districts: the Colt Industrial District to the east, Charter Oak Place to the north, and Congress Street to the west. Previously listed properties within the district include Armsmear, the National Historic Landmark home of armsmaker Samuel Colt, the Henry Barnard House, home to 19th- century educator Henry Barnard and also a National Historic Landmark, and the Day-Taylor House.

She was the daughter of Charles, comte de Neuillan, and married to Philippe de Montaut-B√©nac, duc de Navailles in 1651.

In her position of Premi√®re dame d'honneur, she was responsible for the ladies-in- waiting of the queen. When king Louis XIV started to court a maid-of-honour to the queen, Anne-Lucie de la Mothe-Houdancourt, de Navailles protested to the king, using religious arguments. The king reprimanded her and ordered her to stop interfering, asking her to consider the effects of his displeasure, and the advantages of her compliance. After having consulted a priest, however, she remained steadfast in her opposition and attempts to prevent the king from gaining access to the bedchamber of the maids-of-honour, going so far as to have bars placed to the secret entries to the chamber. This resulted in the disgrace, dismissal and banishment from court for both her and her spouse in 1664.

Born in Tottenham and educated at the local grammar school (alongside another future economist, Ralph Harris), Maynard served with the RAF in the north African theatre during the Second World War. After the war, he was offered a place at the London School of Economics, where he specialized in Keynesian macro-economics and developed an early interest in the economics of inflation. During a tenure as Fellow in Political Economy at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, he was encouraged by future Nobel Prize winner Simon Kuznets to work on the relationship between growth and inflation. This led to the publication in 1962 of his book Economic Development and the Price Level which became a classic and went through a second edition in 1972. In this book, he followed Keynes's distinction between income and profit inflation and applied it to an early two-sector framework between the agricultural sector and the rest of the economy. He accorded great importance to the terms of trade between the two sectors as a determinant of inflation. He applied this analysis in country chapters on the United States, Great Britain, Japan, Russia and Latin American countries, with a special emphasis on Argentina. During a stint with the Harvard Development Advisory Service in Argentina, he teamed with Belgian economist Willy van Ryckeghem to design a stabilization model of inflation in which several policy instruments are combined to reduce inflation and avoid a recession. The Maynard-van Ryckeghem model was applied between 1967 and 1970 and brought inflation down from 20 to 7 per cent, while achieving growth of 4 per cent per annum. Bank credits played a central role in preventing a recession. Later, in their post mortem of the Argentine experience, the authors blamed the ultimate failure of the stabilization attempt on an unforeseen surge in beef prices following a meat shortage. In their other joint work A World of Inflation, published in 1976, they resisted the prevailing monetarism of the seventies, and tested international differences in inflation rates by various structural variables, such as minimum employment rates and differential productivity rates between tradeables and nontradeables. Geoffrey Maynard was for 25 years professor of economics at the University of Reading and editor of the Bankers' Magazine. He also served as deputy chief economic adviser in the British Treasury under the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, Denis Healey, from 1974 onwards, where he was a lone voice against incomes policy whilst remaining supportive of a cut in public spending to offset the jump in oil prices. He was later interviewed by Margaret Thatcher to become her chief economic adviser, but their memorable meeting was cut short after Maynard risked to answer \\"Yes, but...\\" to Mrs. Thatcher's dogmatic views, to which she answered: \\"No buts...\\" and ended the meeting. He then became director of economics at Chase Manhattan Bank and special advisor to David Rockefeller instead. He later got his revenge in his book The Economy under Mrs. Thatcher, which was critical but not entirely unfavourable to her policies. Professor Geoffrey Maynard.

Like other cheilanthoids, they are ferns of dry habitats, reproducing both sexually and apogamously. Many species have leaves divided into a large number of small, bead-like segments, the probable inspiration for the generic name. Hairs and/or scales are often present on both the upper and lower surfaces of the leaf, and their presence and appearance are useful in distinguishing between species. The genus is most diverse in Mexico, but species are found from southwestern Canada south to southern Chile, and one species is endemic to southern Africa. Description No single morphological character divides Myriopteris, as presently circumscribed, from the other cheilanthoids. Convergent evolution in arid environments is thought to be responsible for widespread homoplasy in the morphological characters traditionally used to classify this group. While small, bead-like ultimate segments are associated with the genus, they only appear in about 40% of its species, and appear in some cheilanthoids outside the genus as well. Cheilanthes sensu stricto bears 32 spores per sporangium in sexual species and 16 in apogamous species; with the exception of a few species of Notholaena, Myriopteris and the other cheilanthoids bear 64 spores per sporangium when sexual and 32 per sporangium when apomictic. Myriopteris can also be separated from Cheilanthes s.s., although less reliably, by spores bearing crests or wrinkles (rather than spines or bumps) and a lack of enlarged vein endings (rather than prominent hydathodes). The three subgroups of the genus, informally called the alabamensis, covillei, and lanosa clades, likewise lack unique defining features. The small, bead-like ultimate segments are found in the core subclade of the covillei clade and also in M. gracilis, which is deeply nested in the alabamensis clade. Circinate vernation (the unfolding of new leaves as fiddleheads) is found throughout the lanosa clade and also in M. wrightii, the most basal member of the alabamensis clade. Most species have round rachises, although early-diverging members of the alabamensis and lanosa clades have rachises deeply grooved on the upper surface and flattened rachises shallowly grooved near the frond tip, respectively. Leaf indument (hairs and scales) is highly diverse across the genus and a key feature in species identification. Myriopteris covillei has large, prominent scales beneath the leaf. The base chromosome number for the genus appears to be x=30, except for a portion of the alabamensis clade, where x=29; the latter is typical for other cheilanthoids. Most species are either sexually reproducing diploids or apogamous triploids, with the exception of M. lendigera and some specimens of M. microphylla and M. scabra, which are sexually reproducing tetraploids. Taxonomy The genus was first described in 1852 by A.L.A. F√©e, who separated it from Cheilanthes proper by the presence of red hairs among the sporangia and a scarious (hardened) indusium formed from the leaf margin. He typified it on Myriopteris marsupianthes. F√©e described the division of the leaf into numerous small, beadlike segments, all capable of bearing spores, which may have led him to choose the name Myriopteris; \\"myrio-\\" means \\"very many\\" and \\"pteris\\" means \\"fern\\". John Smith recognized Myriopteris in his Cultivated Ferns of 1857, noting the \\"minute, orbicular or cuneiform, concave\\" ultimate segments typical of species in the genus. However, most authors until the 21st century preferred to include the genus in Cheilanthes. The development of molecular phylogenetic methods showed that the traditional broad circumscription of Cheilanthes is polyphyletic. Many of the morphological characters that have traditionally been used to separate the cheilanthoid ferns into genera, including Cheilanthes, are homoplasious; that is, they have appeared independently in unrelated groups, probably as a result of convergent evolution in arid environments. A molecular phylogeny of 157 cheilanthoid species by Michael D. Windham et al. in 2009 revealed seven well- supported clades within the group. One of these included a number of mostly North American species usually placed in Cheilanthes sensu lato. They informally referred to this group as the myriopterids, Myriopteris being the most senior genus whose type specimen was included in the clade. Further phylogenetic analysis by Eiserhardt et al., in the course of a study on cheilanthoid evolutionary radiation in the Cape Floristic Region, also supported the existence of the myriopterid clade and showed that Cheilanthes rawsonii, an African endemic, was deeply nested in it, its closest relative being C. parryi. After more extensive sampling within the clade, Amanda Grusz and Windham revived Myriopteris in 2013 and provided names in it for all species in the myriopterid clade. Further molecular studies by Grusz et al. confirmed the monophyly of this group, and showed that its species can be divided among three well-supported clades. These were informally referred to by the epithet of a prominent species in the clade, without formal taxonomic rank; they are the alabamensis clade (A), covillei clade (C), and lanosa clade (L). The genus Cheilosoria was described by Conde Vittore Trevisan in 1877 to accommodate Cheilanthes allosuroides, now M. allosuroides, and a few other species of Cheilanthes with long sori along the veins and relatively unmodified false indusia. That genus was lectotypified on C. allosuroides by Edwin Copeland in 1947. If the alabamensis clade were to be treated as a separate genus, Cheilosoria would be the senior name for it. Species The following species (including two hybrids) are those recognized by Grusz & Windham in 2013, with some additions from the Checklist of Ferns and Lycophytes of the World (version 8.11). Letters in parentheses following the scientific names indicate which of the three clades the species belong to, if known. Distribution and habitat Myriopteris parryi growing in a rock outcrop in Death Valley. The greatest diversity of species occurs in Mexico. Myriopteris species are mostly confined to the Americas, ranging from southwestern Canada to southern Chile. M. rawsonii is endemic to Namibia and South Africa. It is most closely related to M. parryi, a species of the Sonoran and Mojave Deserts. Like either cheilanthoids, Myriopteris species occupy dry habitats, growing on rocks or soil.

Life  Caroline Lenferna de Laresle was born in Pointe-aux-Piments, Mauritius, on 20 March 1824. At the time she was growing up there were very few Roman Catholic community leaders in Mauritius. There were only five parishes, with around the same number of priests and no nuns at all. The few priests were often on poor terms with one another, as such de Laresle was not baptised at birth. She attended a boarding school run by a Mrs Farquarson in Port Louis. At the school de Laresle requested to be baptised, with this being carried out in 1835; she took her first holy communion the very next day. Afterwards, inspired in part by Father Xavier Masuy, a Belgian priest; Father Jacques- D√©sir√© Laval; and Bishop Bernard Collier Bishop of Port Louis, de Laresle decided to devote her life to charity and become a nun. As her father could not afford to send her to France for training, she studied as a novitiate under the Ladies of Loreto, who had arrived in Mauritius in 1845. De Laresle took her vows as a nun on 1 May 1849, adopting the name Marie-Augustine. De Laresle founded her own order of nuns, the Congr√©gation des s≈ìurs de charit√© de Notre-Dame-du-Bon-et-Secours (Congregation of Sisters of Charity of Notre Dame of Good Works and Succour) on 14 June 1850. The order had six nuns by 1855 and expanded to more than 60 by 1860. The order began in Port Louis and within 17 years had established 20 convents, hospitals, hospices, schools and nurseries. De Laresle had been inspired to open the first orphanage after discovering an abandoned baby on Christmas Day. The sisters founded their first primary school at Camp Yoloff, Faubourg de l'Est in 1853 and in 1855 came to the aid of the victims of an outbreak of cholera. The order also ran a leper colony, and from 1868 the sisters also served in the Civil Hospital (now known as the Dr AG Jeetoo Hospital). As Mother Superior, de Laresle resisted control of the order by the successors of Collier as bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Port-Louis. De Laresle visited Rome to petition for the order to be granted the pontifical right, bringing it under jurisdiction of the pope and removing it from diocesan control. This was granted by Pope Leo XIII, and in recognition of this the order added \\"Perpetual\\" to their name. De Laresle died whilst in Rome on 28 January 1900. Legacy De Laresle authored Je serai Soeur de Charit√©. Her order continues to this day and now has branches in Africa, Europe, Asia, and South America. Father Carmello Conti Guglia of the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate spent four years collecting de Laresle's correspondence and wrote a biography that was published in Italy and is now being translated into French. Material uncovered by his research is being used to promote de Laresle's beatification.

Career  Ivone Soares was born on 23 October 1979 in Bairro Central in Maputo. Her father was a technical engineer for Radio Mozambique and her uncle is opposition leader and RENAMO politician Afonso Dhlakama. Soares' family grew up near Maputo Cathedral and she attended the Josina Machel and Francisco Manyanga secondary schools. Whilst growing up Soares became interested in politics and began leafleting for RENAMO at the age of 14 and attended meetings of its youth league. As soon as she turned 18 Soares registered as a member of the organisation. Her mother is a member of the opposing FRELIMO party. Soares has a degree in communications science and in 2015 studied for a masters degree in public administration. Soares applied unsuccessfully for a civil servant position at the Ministry of Youth and Sports early in her career, she was unsuccessful and has never again worked in the public sector. She was head of external affairs at RENAMO and a spokesperson for the party's lection office. She since became a member of the Assembly of the Republic, representing RENAMO in the Zambezia Province. When Soares entered parliament she was one of Mozambique's youngest politicians. She is now chairperson and deputy head of RENAMO and leads its parliamentary group. Soares is secretary for women politicians in the Democratic Union of Africa, a continental centrist association. She is a member of the Pan-African Parliament and its Permanent Commission of Justice and Human Rights. Soares is also vice- president of youth for the Pan-African Parliament and president of RENAMO's youth league. In Mozambique Soares has encouraged citizens to cooperate with census officials to improve the quality of information recorded. She favours decentralisation and wants more powers to be devolved to regional governors, many of which are Renamo members ‚Äì this would require an amendment to the Constitution of Mozambique. Soares is also seeking to establish provincial police forces to supplement the federal force. Soares was subject to an attempted assassination on 8 September 2016 by an assassin on a motorbike. The attempt failed when his AK-47 type weapon jammed and Soares was able to escape by car.

Career Unusually in Orthodox Jewish life, she mediated between her husband and Menachem Mendel Schneerson, who was the Lubavitcher Rebbe, leader of one of the largest Hassidic groups, on matters relating to Israel. Her husband was far more of a \\"dove\\", and Schneerson was quite \\"hawkish\\". This was made possible by a longstanding connection between them - she had even played football as a child with Schneerson in pre-war France.

She was the mother of the painter and philosopher Egon von Vietinghoff. Life Jeanne C√©line Emma Bricou was born on 31 December 1875 in Schaerbeek, now a district of Brussels, Belgium. Her parents were Alexis Pierre Joseph Bricou (1825‚Äì77), and his third wife Emma Antoinette Isaure Storm de Grave (1841‚Äì1933), who came from a patrician Dutch family. She was their only child, and her father died when she was 18 months old. Although she was a Protestant she received her secondary education at the Catholic Sacr√©-Coeur convent school in Jette, on the outskirts of Brussels. The Francophone boarding school was run by the Sisters of the Sacred Heart. Jeanne was sent there to perfect her French. Her closest friend there was Fernande Cartier de Marchienne, who would be the mother of the writer Marguerite Yourcenar. The two girls formed an intimate relationship. Jeanne met the Baltic German Baron Conrad von Vietinghoff at a lecture on a spiritual topic in Dresden, and married him on 17 April 1902 in the Hague, Netherlands. Her husband was a musician. They lived for about two years in Courland, Latvia, home of Conrad's parents, then in Saint Petersburg and in Germany before moving to Holland. They had two sons: Egon (1903) and Alexis (1904). In 1905 Jeanne learned of her former classmate Fernande's death, and wrote inviting her husband Michel de Crayencour to come with his daughter Marguerite for a vacation at her mother's summer house in Scheveningen, by the sea. The young Egon de Vietinghoff recalled spending time on the beach with Marguerite Yourcenar, who was the same age as him. Jeanne and her husband shared a common sense of dignity, integrity, ethics and religion, and their home became a meeting place for people interested in art and intellectual discussion. They lived in Paris, Wiesbaden, Geneva and Z√ºrich. Visitors included Romain Rolland, Maurice Maeterlinck, Guy de Pourtal√®s, Pablo Casals and Carl Schuricht. The family often visited Jeanne's mother in the Netherlands, and travelled in France, Italy, Germany, the Baltic States and Switzerland, sometimes taking the children's governess with them. Despite this busy life, Jeanne took the time to write five books of reflections on life, the soul, personal crises, spiritual development and the divine influence. She developed liver cancer at the age of 50. She died on 15 June 1926 in Pully, near Lausanne, Switzerland. She was buried in the Jouxtens cemetery above Lake Geneva near Lausanne.

Between 2010 and 2017, 837 women were murdered and 1,172 murder attempts were made. Statistics According to Peru's National Statistics Institute 2014 survey, 32.3% of Peruvian women had at some point experienced physical violence from a spouse or partner, and 11.9% had experienced such in the previous 12 months. The country's national human rights ombudsman's office has estimated that every month 10 women are killed by their partners. A 2015 study by the same office revealed that from January 2009 to October 2015, 795 femicides were committed, but the courts had issued only 84 sentences between 2012 and 2015. In 81% of the cases of attempted femicide no measures were taken by authorities to protect the survivor, and 24% of women who turned to the justice system for help were later murdered by the very men from whom they had sought protection. In 2017, between January and September there were 94 femicides, 5,707 sexual assaults and 21,000 assaults. Of the 5,707 sexual assaults, 71.33% of victims were children. A recent study on intimate femicides in Peru, identified two main risk factors that increase the likelihood to pass from attempted femicide to femicide: past psychological violence and premeditated violence. Between the two, the former had the strongest statistical effect. Reporting a previous aggression did not affect the probability of being a victim of femicide. The same study estimated the Years of Life Lost (YLL) due to premature mortality caused by feminicides. This estimate represented 16,567 years lost between 2011 and 2015. This study used the official data (2011-2015) from the Ministerio de la Mujer y Poblaciones Vulnerables (Registro Administrativo de las Fichas de Feminicidio y Tentativa del MIMP).

The film is based on the book of the same name by Donna VanLiere. Plot Gretchen DanielsLater in the movie, the name tag on her husband shows \\"Danielles\\". moves back to her hometown of Wilsonville with her son Ethan, at the urging of her husband and Ethan's father, Kyle, who was injured while on deployment and is recovering at a military hospital in Germany. Ethan wants his dad to come home for Christmas; he writes a letter to Santa asking for such (even saying that he didn't want a bicycle, a baseball glove, or an Xbox). But although Kyle's condition improves, and is originally told he will be able to come home for Christmas, a last minute change threatens those plans. In the house next door resides Melissa McCreary, who works all the time and doesn't socialize with anyone. One day, Gretchen is approached by a local landlord with a message for Melissa: her mother (Ramona) has passed away and the apartment needs to be cleared out by the weekend. Gretchen is reluctant to pass along the message, as she barely knows Melissa, but does so anyway, and offers to help her clean out the apartment. While initially going through the apartment, and later at Ramona's memorial service, Melissa shares that she was not aware that Ramona was ill or had moved back to town; the two hadn't spoken in ten years. Ramona was a workaholic who frequently left Melissa alone with babysitters and was constantly forcing Melissa to move to accommodate her job situation; therefore, they never lived in one place long enough to settle down and make friends. The two fought constantly, which ultimately came to a head when Melissa turned 18; after Ramona announced yet another job relocation this time Melissa refused to go, resulting in her and Ramona having one final argument which broke ties between the two. Melissa tells Gretchen that Ramona left and she moved back to Wilsonville (the only place she ever stayed long enough to feel at home). While going through Ramona's belongings, Melissa discovers an unfinished note Ramona was writing to her, asking for her forgiveness and telling her that before she was born, Ramona had a previous child that she gave up for adoption. Gretchen (who herself was adopted) convinces the reluctant Melissa to go on a search to find her sibling (convincing her that she could be giving both of them an amazing gift - the gift of family). During the search the two become friends along the way, and Melissa realizes that her decision to isolate herself from Ramona (and anyone else - as she had become a workaholic just like Ramona) was a huge mistake. Ultimately Melissa admits to Gretchen that she lied about her estrangement with Ramona: what really happened is when she and Ramona argued over the planned move, Ramona didn't leave - Melissa simply moved out and asked Ramona never to contact her again. Melissa wishes she could take back her original decision to cut ties with Ramona, and realizes that the note about her sibling was giving Melissa a chance to forgive herself. Initially believing that her sibling is male, Melissa asks Bruce (a volunteer at a local food pantry, featured in one of her mother's photos) if he is her brother. It turns out he is not, but convinces one of the pantry's main supporters, a local attorney (for whom Gretchen works part time) to assist in the search. At the end, the attorney locates the adoptive records, which reveal that Melissa's sibling is not a brother, but a sister - Gretchen (Ramona had given birth to a girl and immediately turned her over to an adoption agency, who had a prearranged adoption with Gretchen's adoptive parents). At the town's Christmas event, Kyle surprises everyone by appearing, thanks in part to Melissa who asks Bruce, who was a former soldier, to use any connections he had so that Kyle could come home to recuperate.

The film used hidden cameras and lavalier microphones to capture an insight into the sport's highest-profile competitors, Dave Molyneux and Tim Reeves. The film was financed and distributed by Beaumanx Productions and was shot in association with North One Television, Blue Olive Productions and the Isle of Man Government. It received a limited theatrical release in Northern Ireland, Germany and the Isle of Man, and was released on home media in May 2018.  Development  Manx sidecar enthusiast and sponsor Christopher Beauman first devised the idea of a reality show in the Isle of Man TT paddocks hoping to promote sidecar racing to a wider audience, in order to increase sponsorship potential for the competitors. Development began in early 2015 with Greenlight International handling sales and distribution. Using early concept footage shot during the TT and Southern 100 2015, a teaser-trailer was screened during an interview with Dave Molyneux at the TT Press Launch in April 2016, and on the film's official Facebook page. Despite the impromptu nature of observational documentary production, the filmmakers were able to loosely script and plan for almost-any eventuality within the film's story due to the rigid structure of the event. The filmmakers hoped to capture the raw emotions present at the TT, commenting that 3 Wheeling is \\"not a documentary, it's a movie - it just so happens that it's all happening for real.\\"  Production  The Department of Economic Development (Isle of Man) provided support in allowing the production company access to restricted zones at the TT Grandstand, and principal photography took place during racing period of 2016 with Dave Molyneux, Tim Reeves and Klaus Klaffenb√∂ck attached to star. Manx-Based company Blue Olive Productions captured original footage on Canon DSLRs, GoPros and the Osmo camcorder, with racing footage filmed and licensed by North One Television. The camera-crew described the filming technique as \\"invisibly intrusive\\" and admitted that it took several days to develop a suitable method of capturing the action close-up, without affecting the race- team's concentration. Beaumanx Productions sponsored Dave Molyneux Racing in order to secure the publicity-shy racer. The film's director stated that Molyneux's dislike for the limelight made 3 Wheeling difficult to film, but acknowledged that it allowed them to portray Molyneux as a \\"...brilliant character...\\" with \\"...a tremendous screen-presence...\\". Second Unit was filmed during the Southern 100 and Manx Grand Prix 2016, and the movie took ten months to complete.  Release  The official trailer was previewed at the TT Press Launch in March 2017 and the film was premiered at the Villa Marina on 7 May. Most of the film's stars were in attendance; Reeves and Klaffenb√∂ck were unable to attend due to racing seasons commitments. The film was then released in theatres in Northern Ireland, Germany, and the Isle of Man.  Reception  The film's official Facebook page has amassed 1.2 million page-likes via its viral marketing campaign. Manx Radio's TT commentary team were treated to an advanced screening of the film, and praised how successfully the atmosphere of the TT was captured and portrayed. Tim Glover noted the strength of the characters telling the story as opposed to a narrator, and considered the start-line scene from race one as one of the film's highlight, citing the sound design and powerful subject matter as Reeves said goodbye to his family as the standout moment of the film. Dave Christian said \\"You don't have to be a racing fan to watch that, it was an amazing piece of film\\" and Roy Moore remarked that he believed the public would flock in their droves to watch the film. In September 2018, the film opened the Toronto Motorcycle Film Festival supported by Harley-Davidson and was screened at London Fields Brewery as part of the Fuelled Moto Film Fest in August 2018.

Partly self-taught, he finished his training in Paris, without enrolling in a school, and frequented the studio of Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps, as well as painters of the Barbizon School and of the \\"Groupe du Restaurant du Havre\\" including Thomas Couture, Eug√®ne Isabey, Th√©odore Rousseau and others. He exhibited at the Brussels Salon from 1842. In 1852 he joined his two brothers in Paris where he lived for several years, dividing his time between the worldliness of the Imperial Court, in particular the Jardin des Tuileries, and the Bohemianism of caf√© life. He executed many drawings of horses in the Bois de Boulogne which he exhibited in Amsterdam in 1854, and later in Dijon in 1858. He became acquainted with Charles Baudelaire, whom he met again in Brussels in 1864. The poet dedicated to him the piece Les Bons Chiens (\\"Good Dogs\\"), the penultimate work, preceding √âpilogue, in the collection Petits po√®mes en prose. (Dogs were Stevens' preferred subject matterRobert L. Delevoy, Les Stevens on the website Encyclop√¶dia Universalis). He finally returned to live in Brussels in 1869. Rue Joseph Stevens His work attracted many patrons, notably Henri Van Cutsem; King Leopold II also bought paintings of his. Despite (or perhaps because of) his success, he fell prey to alcohol in his later years. Ernest Meissonier painted his portrait, and a street in the city of Brussels (connecting the district of Marolles to that of Sablon), is named after him.  Works  Stevens produced mostly canvases showing domestic animals (generally dogs, monkeys and horses) in sometimes curious or run-down settings far removed from Romanticism. This realism, of which he was one of the pioneers, attracted the interest from the 1850s of predominantly French critics and intellectuals, particularly Baudelaire and also L√©on Cladel, who was inspired by Stevens' paintings to write L√©on Cladel et sa kyrielle de chiens (1885).

It was described as a new species in 2013. It is listed as endangered by the IUCN. Taxonomy and etymology It was described in 2013. Its closest relative is the dark-brown serotine, Neoromicia brunnea. Rosevear's serotine and the dark-brown serotine are separated by a genetic distance of 6.9-7.2%. The new species was assigned to the genus Neoromicia based on its single upper premolar: a trait shared amongst all species in the genus. The authors who described the species chose the specific epithet \\"roseveari\\" to honor Donovan Reginald Rosevear, \\"who made a significant contribution to West African bat research in the 20th century, culminating in his book The Bats of West Africa\\". Description It is a small bat, with a total body length of . Its tail is ; its forearm is long; its hindfoot is long; its ear length is . It has a body mass of . Its maximum skull length is . Despite this small size, it is the largest \\"pipistrelloid\\" (bats in the genera Hypsugo, Neoromicia, and Pipistrellus) in West Africa. In some aspects, Eisentraut's pipistrelle overlaps with Rosevear's serotine in size, though they can be differentiated by their morphology. Its fur is dark chocolate brown in color. The fur on its ventral surface is bicolored, with the bases of individual hairs darker than their tips. The fur on its dorsal surface is a constant color throughout, in contrast to the bicolored ventral fur. Its ear is relatively short, and rounded at the tip. The outer edge of the tragus is curved; the base of the tragus has a \\"distinct lobe.\\" Relative to other species in its genus, it has a robust skull and a broad snout. Its dental formula, typical for Neoromicia species, is , for a total of 32 teeth. Biology As only six individuals have ever been encountered, very little is known about the biology of this species. A female captured in Guinea in early March 2008 was pregnant, however, with a fetus from crown to rump. Range and habitat Only six specimens have ever been documented. Four specimens were recorded on the Liberian border of Mount Nimba and the other two specimens were in the Simandou Range of Guinea. All captured individuals were netted over small streams in primary rainforest. Two of the Mount Nimba individuals were encountered at above sea level. Conservation It is currently evaluated as endangered by the IUCN. It meets the criteria for this designation because its extent of occurrence is estimated at less than and its area of occupancy is estimated at less than . Major threats to this species include deforestation via slash-and-burn agriculture, logging, and mining.

History Born in a family with great political connections, Pedro Parente started his career in the public administration at 20 years old while studying to receive his bachelor's degree in Electronic engineering. He was moved from the Bank of Brazil to the Ministry of Planning of Andrea Calabi, under request of his executive secretary Jo√£o Sayad, to help create the Secretary of National Treasury. Years later, he worked in the governments of Jos√© Sarney and Fernando Collor de Mello until he played greater roles during the administration of Fernando Henrique Cardoso. Under Cardoso's presidency, Parente became Chief of Staff from January 1, 1999 to January 1, 2003, Minister of Planning, Budget and Management from May 6 to July 18, 1999, executive secretary of the Ministry of Finance and also accumulated the position of Minister of Mines and Energy in 2002. During that time he was known as \\"blackout minister\\", for being the coordinator of the crisis management team during the power outages that happened in that very year. He left the public administration for the private sector once Lu√≠s In√°cio Lula da Silva came to office and was appointed as vice-president of the Brazilian media conglomerate RBS group, until accepting, in 2010, the position of CEO and president of Bunge Brazil, one of the biggest trading companies in the world, which made its sugar and alcohol productions assets available for sale to concentrate on more profitable operations in grains, seeds oils and processed foods. On 19 May 2016, Parente was appointed by then acting president Michel Temer to the office of president of Petrobras. His name was submitted and approved by the Administrative Council of the company, an essential requirement to take office. He was sworn in on June 1, 2017. On 1 June 2018, after a week long trucker's strike against fuel prices, Parente resigned from the presidency of Petrobras.

She is also the daughter-in-law of Sabina Mugabe, the sister of former President of Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe. Prior to 2015, Zhuwao was active in ZANU‚ÄìPF politics, serving for several years as the party's provincial treasurer for Mashonaland West Province.  Life and career  Zhuwao was born on 10 January 1965. During the 2008‚Äì09 Zimbabwean political negotiations, Zhuwao was selected to be on the Constitution Select Committee (COPAC), which worked to draft a new Zimbabwean constitution. She was assigned to serve as a rapporteur, gauging public opinion during the constitution-drafting process. In September 2010, Zhuwao assaulted fellow committee member Bednock Nyaude, MDC‚ÄìT House of Assembly member for Bindura South. Zhuwao assaulted Nyaude outside the offices of the District Administrator for Kadoma in Mashonaland West Province. She punched him in the chest after accusing him of insinuating that she had personal issues, a charge Nyaude denied. Following the incident, Nyaude reported the assault at Kadoma Central Police Station on 7 September 2010, and also informed COPAC members Editor Matamisa and Walter Chidakwa, both House of Assembly members. Matamisa, in turn, reported the incident to COPAC co-chairs Paul Mangwana and Douglas Mwonzora. Monzwora said that if found guilty, Zhuwao would be suspended from COPAC. On 6 February 2011, Zhuwao was defeated by Tsitsi Mugabe in the election for chair of the ZANU‚ÄìPF Zvimba District Coordinating Committee. Mugabe received 26 votes to Zhuwao's 14. In October 2014, Zhuwao became involved in the heated ZANU‚ÄìPF succession infighting between Vice President Joice Mujuru and then-Minister of Justice Emmerson Mnangagwa. During what her husband described as a \\"coup\\" attempt, Zhuwao slapped ZANU‚ÄìPF Mashonaland West provincial chairman Temba Mliswa after a tense verbal exchange. She reportedly slapped Mliswa, who did not retaliate, once, before others present intervened. Reports of the incident soon went viral on the internet. At a meeting with top government officials days later, President Robert Mugabe reportedly denied that a coup attempt occurred, expressed disapproval of the incident, and apologized to Mliswa on Zhuwao's behalf. Mugabe also reportedly questioned Media Minister Jonathan Moyo why Mliswa was being portrayed in state media as the aggressor when in reality, he was the victim of the assault. Zhuwao confirmed the incident but refused to comment, saying she would later issue a statement. In July 2015, Zhuwao stepped down from her post as ZANU‚ÄìPF Mashonaland West provincial Women's League treasurer due to pressure from fellow party members, who accused her of refusing to sign a petition that led to the ouster of acting provincial Chair Ziyambi Ziyambi. Zhuwao was reportedly seen as a Ziyambi supporter and was thus targeted by Ziyambi opponents. Zhuwao confirmed that she had resigned, but said that the move was not related to politics, rather, she stepped down to study at the University of Zimbabwe. She is married to ZANU PF exiled politician Patrick Zhuwao and their son Jason Zhuwao is also a ZANU PF politician.

Capital to establish the company was provided by Lizzie B. Ward to construct a small plant across from the Old Ward Mill which was run by her husband James Ward. Thomas immigrated in 1868 from Carmarthenshire in Wales with his wife and son W. Aubrey Thomas who served as secretary of the company until he was appointed as representative to the U. S. Congress in 1904. The company was managed by another son Thomas E. Thomas after J.R. Thomas died unexpectedly in 1898. The Thomases returned the favor of their original capitalization by purchasing an iron blast furnace from James Ward when he went bankrupt in 1879. Using their knowledge of firebrick they were able to make this small furnace profitable. Later they used it to showcase the value of adding hot blast to a furnace using 3 ovens packed full of firebrick. The furnace was managed by another son John Morgan Thomas. Fire brick was first invented in 1822 by William Weston Young in the Neath Valley of Wales, in the next county east of Llanelli where the Thomas family lived before emigrating to Niles. It is recorded that Firebrick was made in the Llanelli area in 1870 but the market was highly cyclical and it was difficult to make a living at it. From 1937 to 1941 the company worked to prevent the United Brick Workers Union (CIO) from organizing the workers in preference for an independent union favored by management. The CIO union prevailed. In spite of this episode the company had good relations with the employees and tried to keep them employed during economic downturns. The \\"Clingans\\" mentioned in that referenced interview were Margaret Thomas Clingan, a daughter and John Rhys Thomas Clingan, a grandson, who took over management of the Company when T.E. Thomas died in 1920. Patrick J. Sheehan worked various jobs at Niles Fire Brick Company from age 13 up until 1897 when he was appointed superintendent of the plant. When Sheehan started with the company they occupied a plant covering a floor space of 3,600 square feet, two kilns, and the output was 640,000 bricks per year. The plant was moved to Langley street eighteen months afterward, and the output increased to 1,200,000. This Langley street works has constantly added to each year, until the output was 6 million and in 1905 they built the \\"Falcon\\" plant on the site formerly occupied by the Langley street plant. Which doubled production to 12 million per year. By 1955 the output was 25 million. The work of molding and firing brick was highly labor- intensive. Immegrants from Southern States and European countries especially Italy were sought to perform the work under working conditions that were long and hard. An article in the March-April \\"The Niles Register\\" of the Niles Historical Society discusses the history of the headquarters of the company at 216 Langely Street with a pattern shop in the back where skilled workers created the molds for custom bricks ordered by the mills in the 1902- 1912 period. After that the pattern shop was used by the Sons of Italy and later by the Bagnoli-Irpino Club. This was a result of the large percentage of immigrants from the Bagnoli-Irpino area in Italy. One of the founders of the club was Lawrence Pallante an early immigrant from that area and presumably an ancestor of the reference articles. Immigration from that area began in 1880 and extended to about 1960.

She spent the majority of her childhood North Karnataka, a region of southern India. On her upbringing, Sengupta remarked, \\"I have grown up in a family that is committed to social justice.\\" She speaks English, Hindi, Kannada, Bengali, Tamil and Malayalam.  Education  Sengupta received her B.A. in economics from Lady Shri Ram College for Women, a constituent college of Delhi University in New Delhi, India, where she graduated in 1995 with honours. She is noted as a prominent alumni of Lady Shri Ram College for Women Sengupta was invited to recite part of her poem \\"Silence\\" at the 2014 Genderknowledge Academic Congress, which was held at her undergraduate alma mater. In 1998, she received a master of philosophy degree in development studies from Queen Elizabeth House, Oxford University studying as a Rhodes Scholar. She later did her doctoral work in politics at Oxford studying formal and informal structures and practices within the police in Karnataka. According to Paul Amar's book New Racial Missions of Policing: International Perspectives on Evolving Law, the title of her thesis at Oxford was \\"Embedded or Stuck: the Study of the Indian State, its Embeddedness in Social Institutions and State Capacity.\\" Sengupta contributed a chapter to this book, entitled, \\"Concept, Category, and Claim: Insights on Caste and Ethnicity from the Police in India.\\" Additionally, Sengupta was a Visiting Scholar at the University of Berkeley, California from 2007‚Äì2009.  Work and activism  Former United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton became aware of one of Sengupta's poems in March 1995, when Clinton was the First Lady and visiting India. Later, Clinton used it in her speeches in Delhi and at a United Nations women's conference in Beijing, China. :(excerpt from \\"Silence\\"): The poem also inspired Clinton to write a chapter in her autobiography, Living History entitled \\"Silence Is Not Spoken Here\\". Sengupta co-edited Defending Our Dreams: Global Feminist Voices for a New Generation (2005) which was reviewed favorably by Sister Namibia. The Women's Review of Books praised her essay in Defending Our Dreams, calling it a \\"visionary\\" work about feminism and the eradication of poverty. In Development in Practice, a reviewer comments that the \\"connection between dreaming and planning is the most arresting element the book offers to its readers. The dreams of its young contributors, are demonstrating new visions, new skills, and new approaches to development and feminism, which present a potential breakthrough in strategies for promoting social justice and women‚Äôs rights.\\" Feminist Studies praised the book and wrote, \\"This volume does provide a surprisingly cohesive account, for a collection, of the thinking of key feminists about international trends.\\" See the publications section below for more information. Sengupta (far right) in a panel discussion at Wikimania 2017 in Montreal Sengupta was the Chief Grantmaking Officer at the Wikimedia Foundation in San Francisco, California. She is the co-founder of Whose Knowledge, a group set up to improve online knowledge and information in marginalised parts of the world, including Asia, Africa and Latin America. She works as the co-director of the organization alongside Siko Bouterse and Adele Vrana. The group has been described as \\"a global, multilingual campaign to reimagine the internet to be for and from all.\\" As of October 2018, her work to decolonise the internet is supported by a fellowship from the Shuttleworth Foundation. In a keynote speech she gave at the Digital Library Federation's 2018 Forum, Sengupta spoke on her work to decolonise the internet. She said, \\"decolonising [the internet is] at the heart of true empowerment. In many ways, the crisis of violence and injustice that we face today feel like they are rooted in a hidden crisis of unknowing.\\"Sengupta, Anasuya. \\"Decolonizing Knowledge, Decolonizing the Internet: An Agenda for Collective Action.\\" Digital Library Federation. DLF Forum Opening Plenary, Las Vegas, NV. Retrieved 10 December 2018. Sengupta went on to discuss the importance of libraries and the need for a greater representation of the world's languages on the internet. Sengupta has used her platform to advocate for the decolonisation of knowledge in the Media. On 11 July 2016, she co-authored an article with Thenmozhi Soundararajan, Harjit Kaur, and Umar Malick on the need for revisions for social-science textbooks in California for the Indian Express. In this article, the authors argue that the Hinduvita lobby has marginalised the identities of other communities (such as the Dalit people, whom Whose Knowledge works with) in their effort to revise California's textbooks. They also advocate for the removal of historical inaccuracies in textbooks to dismantle false narratives about certain religious or ethnic groups, specifically Muslims. Furthermore, Sengupta has been featured in other major media outlets for her work to decolonise the internet, including BBC News, The Guardian, Mail & Guardian, and The Atlantic, among others. On 11 December 2018, Sengupta and Claudia Pozo released a resource series, \\"Our Stories, Our Knowledges\\" through Whose Knowledge. It is divided split into four parts: \\"Part 1: Decolonising Our Stories and Knowledges,\\" \\"Part 2: Transformative Practices for Building Community Knowledges,\\" \\"Part 3: Adding Our Knowledge to Wikipedia,\\" and \\"Part 4: How to Ally and Be a Good Guest.\\" The series focuses on the structures of power which silence marginalized voices, practices for those communities to overcome epistemic barriers placed upon them by white colonialist structures, the work of Whose Knowledge in these efforts, and advice for allies who want to get involved in decolonising the internet. In September 2018, The Oxford Internet Institute awarded Sengupta the Internet and Society Awards for her work on Whose Knowledge; Nani Jensen Reventlow was also presented with this honor for her work on the Digital Freedom Fund, an organization which works towards the advancement of digital rights in Europe through litigation.

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010. History =Spencer High School= The school building was completed in 1914. Designed by Chicago architect John D. Chubb, it is a three-story Neoclassical structure with a flat roof. It features slightly projecting bays and prominent belt courses that encircle the building. The belt course that runs below the second-floor windows divides the different brick that was used for the first floor from that used on the upper two floors. When it was constructed, the building was symmetrical in design, but when the auditorium was added in 1937 it threw off the symmetry. This was the first high school- only building in Spencer. Previously, the high school grades were on the first floor of the town's only school building, and the lower grades were on the upper floor. This building was built when A. H. Avery was the superintendent of the Spencer school district. Avery had introduced a five-year high school program that included vocational training as many students would not be going on to college. He advocated for the new school building that included vocational-specific classrooms. =Auditorium= The auditorium was designed by the Des Moines architectural firm of Keffer & Jones. The three-story Art Deco structure was completed for $132,000. Financing for its construction came from three sources: $57,000 came from Public Works Administration funds, $70,000 from a local bond referendum, and $5,000 from the local school district. The addition contained additional classroom space and a 1,200 seat auditorium that served the high school and the needs of the local community. The present gymnasium was added to the building in 1967. A new high school was built in 1960, but it did not include an auditorium. The old high school became a junior high school and then a middle school, but the high school continued to use the old auditorium until 2016. In 2010 the Spencer Area Activity Center relocated to the first floor of the high school building, and the upper two floors were converted into 16 apartments by Community Housing Initiative.

University of Santiago de Compostela‚Äù Philasterides dicentrarchi is a marine protozoan ciliate that was first identified in 1995 after being isolated from infected European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) reared in France. The species was also identified as the causative agent of outbreaks of scuticociliatosis that occurred between summer 1999 and spring 2000 in turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) cultivated in the Atlantic Ocean (Galicia, Northwest Spain). Infections caused by P. dicentrarchi have since been observed in turbot reared in both open flow and recirculating production systems. In addition, the ciliate has also been reported to cause infections in other flatfishes, such as the olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) in Korea and the fine flounder (Paralichthys adspersus) in Peru, as well as in seadragons (Phyllopteryx taeniolatus and Phycodurus eques), seahorses (Hippocampus kuda and H. abdominalis), and several species of sharks in other parts of the world.  Biology and Pathology  P. dicentrarchi is included within the subclass Scuticociliatia, which includes about 20 species of ciliates that are typically microphagous bacteriovores and generally abundant in eutrophic habitats in lakes and in coastal marine habitats. Some of these ciliates, characterized by possessing a scutica (a transient kinetosomal structure that is present during stomatogenesis), can behave as endoparasites and are capable of producing serious infections in a wide variety of vertebrates, especially fish, and invertebrates such as crustaceans and echinoderms. P. dicentrarchi is a microaerophilic scuticociliate that lives at the sea bottom, at or below the oxycline or on the monimolimnion, where it feeds on bacteria. However, when it encounters a host it can also behave as an opportunistic histiophagous parasite. Survival of the species inside the host and adaptation to a parasitic lifestyle are attributed to the existence of physiological adaptations at the level of mitochondrial metabolism. Such adaptations include the presence of a second terminal oxidase (which enables the ciliates to obtain energy and survive low levels of oxygen), antioxidant enzymes, inorganic pyrophosphatases (capable of producing energy by an ATP alternative pathway produced during oxidative metabolism) and the ability of the species to survive in hyposaline environments. Although the route of entry to the host is unknown, the findings of experimental infection studies suggest that the ciliate probably gains access through lesions in the gills and/or the skin. Infected fish show haemorrhagic ulcers on the skin (particularly around the operculum), abundant ascitic fluid in the abdominal cavity, uni- or bilateral exophthalmia, and systemic infection with the presence of ciliates in blood, gills, gastrointestinal tract, liver, spleen, kidneys and musculature. In the final phase of infection, ciliates reach the brain and cause softening and liquefaction of the tissue.  Diagnosis  Diagnosis of P. dicentrarchi in the sea bass and the turbot was initially based primarily on morphological characteristics associated with the oral apparatus and the number of kineties. However, it has been suggested that the combined use of morphological, biological, molecular and serological techniques is necessary for correct identification of the species. P. dicentrarchi was previously considered a junior synonym of Miamiensis avidus. However, recent physiological and molecular studies have shown that P. dicentrarchi and M. avidus strain Ma/2 -ATCC 50180‚Ñ¢- are different species.  Treatments  No effective chemotherapeutic measures have been developed for controlling scuticociliatosis in the acute phase of the disease to date. However, the addition of disinfectants such as formalin, hydrogen peroxide and Jenoclean (a mixture of Atacama extract 97%-Zeolites- and citric acid 3%) to seawater has been demonstrated to kill the ciliates. Bath treatments consisting of a combination of benzalkonium chloride and bronopol have also proved to be effective in reducing fish mortality. Several compounds of well-known antiprotozoal activity, including niclosamide, oxyclozanide, bithionol sulfoxide, toltrazuril, N-(2 '-hydroxy-5 '-chloro-benzoyl) 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline, BP68, doxycycline hyclate, albendazole, carnidazole, pyrimethamine, hydrochloride quinacrine and quinine sulphate, are also active against P. dicentrarchi. Antimalarial drugs such as chloroquine and artemisinin also inhibit the in vitro growth of P. dicentrarchi. Other studies investigating the in vitro effects of several new synthetic compounds, including 2 naphthyridines, 2 pyridothienodiazines and 13 pyridothienotriazines, have demonstrated that all display parasiticide activity, and that pyridothienotriazine (12k) was the most active. In addition, several compounds of natural origin have also shown in vitro antiparasitic activity: the polyphenols mangiferin and (‚Äì)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), curcumin, resveratrol and the synthetic polyphenol propyl gallate.  Prevention  Vaccines containing trophozoites inactivated with formalin and prepared in oil adjuvants have been developed and have shown good protection against the homologous serotype. Several P. dicentrarchi serotypes have been described. However, the protection induced against heterologous isolates appears to be very low or non-existent.  Research  Research on Philasterides dicentrarchi, which includes aspects of cell biology, diagnostics, interactions with the host immune system, search for new treatments, development of vaccines or risk analysis, is being carried out under the EU funded Horizon2020 Project ParaFishControl.https://www.parafishcontrol.eu  References  Philasterida Ciliates Parasitic eukaryotes Parasites of fish ","title":"Philasterides dicentrarchi"},{"id":"55890423","text":"Anna C.

As the leader of the geriatric unit at Sunderland, she was a pioneer in geriatric medicine and geriatric psychiatry. Early life Eluned Woodford-Williams was born on 12 September 1913 in Liverpool. She was the eldest of four daughters born to John Woodford-Williams, a dentist, and Edith Mary Stevens. She began her schooling at Liverpool College, and after her family moved to Wales she attended Cardiff High School for Girls. She received a BSc from the Welsh National School of Medicine in 1933 before moving to London to complete her clinical training at University College Hospital, graduating as MBBS in 1936. Career After qualifying, Woodford- Williams became a house physician at University College Hospital. She later became interested in paediatrics, taking up a position at Liverpool's Alder Hey Children's Hospital and gaining a Diploma in Child Health in 1938. She then moved to Redhill Hospital in Surrey as a resident medical officer, and in 1940 she was awarded an MD with a gold medal. She transferred to Manchester in 1942, working as an assistant physician at Manchester Royal Infirmary and Manchester Northern Hospital. After the war, she moved with her husband Dennis Astley Sanford to Sunderland, where he had been appointed a consultant surgeon. She did not work for several years, but in 1950 she began working for the Austrian geriatrician Oscar Olbrich, first as his senior registrar and later as an assistant physician. When Olbrich died in 1958, Woodford-Williams succeeded him as the leader of the Sunderland geriatric unit; under her leadership, the unit gained an international reputation for geriatrics. She established the practice of admitting all patients over the age of 65 to the geriatric unit, regardless of their specific illness; this practice has since become the norm in many hospitals. Woodford-Williams, who petitioned the Royal College of Physicians to create a geriatrics committee, has been credited with establishing geriatrics as a distinct medical discipline. She was appointed to the Health Advisory Service in 1973 and held the position for five years, during which time she influenced government policy on geriatric medicine and especially geriatric psychiatry. She also co-edited the journal Gerontologia Clinica. Later life Woodford-Williams retired to Abersoch around 1980. She recovered from an episode of infective endocarditis but later died of heart failure on 25 November 1984 in Sunderland. Honours Woodford-Williams was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1978. She was elected Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians (FRCP) in 1964 and Fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatrists (FRCPsych) in 1983 for her contributions to geriatric psychiatry.

She was the founder of the South Side Settlement House, later renamed in her honor as Ada S. McKinley Community Services, which continues today as a major Chicago social service organization. Early life and education Ada Sophia Dennison was born and raised in Texas during Reconstruction: born in Galveston in 1868, she subsequently moved with her family to Corpus Christi. She attended Prairie View College and Tillotson Missionary College, and subsequently became a teacher in Texas schools. In 1887, she married the dentist William McKinley, and they subsequently moved north to Chicago. In Chicago, McKinley became prominent in political and social circles as part of the women's club movement, and was a leading member of the Phyllis Wheatley Club. In 1916, she served as secretary of the Colored Women's Hughes Republican headquarters in Chicago, which backed the unsuccessful presidential campaign of Charles Evans Hughes. She worked with other leading African-American women of Chicago on the campaign, including Ella Berry and Ida B. Wells-Barnett. In the ensuing years of World War I, McKinley served as head recreational host at the \\"War Camp Club,\\" organized by the Chicago Urban League, which provided social services to returning soldiers and sailors. The War Camp Club is recognized today as a community-based antecedent to recreational therapy for troops returning from combat. South Side Settlement McKinley established the \\"Soldiers and Sailors Club\\" in 1919 to attend to the needs of returning African-American servicemen from World War I. After the Chicago race riot of 1919, she marched together with white settlement house workers including Jane Addams and Harriet Vittum to show that interracial solidarity was possible. In 1926, McKinley renamed her organization the South Side Settlement House, becoming its president and chief resident. In the 1940s, the growing organization moved to the community center of the Ida B. Wells Homes. The South Side Settlement under McKinley's leadership was distinguished from other settlement houses by its work with Wells Homes residents. Death and legacy In 1949, the South Side Settlement was renamed the Ada S. McKinley Community House. McKinley laid the cornerstone at the organization's new headquarters on 34th Street in Bronzeville in 1952. She died just hours later, of a cerebral hemorrhage. In the 1990s, it was discovered that McKinley's gravestone in Glenwood, Illinois was in severe disrepair. Ada S. McKinley Community Services arranged to have her reinterred at the Oak Woods Cemetery in Chicago, along with her husband and son. Her monument stands next to a monument to Chicago mayor Harold Washington. The dedication of McKinley's monument was marked by an overflight by the Tuskeegee Airmen. As of 2012, Ada S. McKinley Community Services operated more than 40 locations around Chicago and the surrounding area, with annual revenue of more than $38 million per year. McKinley is also the namesake of the Ada S.

The Ledger Syndicate distributed comic strips, panels, and columns to the United States and the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Sweden, New Zealand, and Australia. The syndicate also distributed material from the Curtis Publishing Company's (the Public Ledger's corporate parent) other publications, including The Saturday Evening Post, Ladies' Home Journal, and The Country Gentleman. From 1933 to 1941, the Ledger Syndicate was a key contributor to the burgeoning comic book industry, with many of the company's strips published in both the seminal Funnies on Parade, and what popular culture historians consider the first true American comic book, Famous Funnies. For whatever reason, the Ledger Syndicate favored comic strips with alliterative titles, including Babe Bunting, Daffy Demonstrations, Deb Days, Dizzy Dramas, Hairbreadth Harry, Modish Mitzi, and Somebody's Stenog.  History  The Public Ledger Syndicate was founded in 1915 by Public Ledger publisher Cyrus H. K. Curtis,Frederic Hudson, Alfred McClung Lee, Frank L. Mott, editors. \\"The Daily Newspaper in America,\\" American Journalism 1690-1940 (Psychology Press, 2000), p. 594. The first big comic strip success was A. E. Hayward's Somebody's Stenog, launched in late 1918. The Syndicate was particularly active in the 1920s, when it launched a number of comic strips, including such long-running titles as Connie, Dizzy Dramas, Dumb-Bells, Hairbreadth Harry, and Modish Mitzi. In 1933, just as the concept of \\"comic books\\" was getting off the ground, Eastern Color Printing began producing small comic broadsides for the Ledger Syndicate, printing Sunday color comics from 7\\" x 9\\" plates. Eastern Color sales manager Harry I. Wildenberg and his coworkers realized that two such plates would fit on a tabloid-sized page; later that year, Wildenberg created the first modern-format comic book when idly folding a newspaper into halves and then into quarters, finding that a convenient book size. Shortly thereafter, Eastern Color published Funnies on Parade, which reprinted in color several comic strips licensed from the Ledger Syndicate, the McNaught Syndicate, Associated Newspapers, and the Bell Syndicate,\\"Funnies on Parade,\\" Grand Comics Database. Accessed Oct. 29, 2018. including the Ledger Syndicate strips Hairbreadth Harry, Nipper, High-Gear Homer, and Somebody's Stenog. Eastern Color neither sold this periodical nor made it available on newsstands, but rather sent it out free as a promotional item to consumers who mailed in coupons clipped from Procter & Gamble soap and toiletries products. The company printed 10,000 copies, and it was a great success.Brown, Mitchell. Following that success, the Ledger Syndicate became a regular source of material for Eastern Color's ongoing anthology series Famous Funnies. The Ledger Syndicate provided strips for Famous Funnies issues #1‚Äì87, from 1934 to 1941, including A. E. Hayward's Somebody's Stenog and The Back-Seat Driver; Frank Godwin's Connie, The Wet Blanket, Babe Bunting, Roy Powers, Vignettes of Life, and War on Crime; F. O. Alexander's Hairbreadth Harry and High-Gear Homer; Clare Victor Dwiggins' Footprints on the Sands of Time; Joe Bowers' Dizzy Dramas; Gar (Schmitt)'s Dumb-Bells; and Walt Munson & Kemp Starrett's Such is Life.

Sive is a South African-born biologist and educator. She is a Member of Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Professor of Biology at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Associate Member of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. Sive studies development of the vertebrate embryo, and has made unique contributions to understanding how the face forms and how the brain develops its normal structure. Her lab also seeks to understand the origins of neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders, such as epilepsy, autism, Pitt‚ÄìHopkins syndrome and 16p11.2 deletion syndrome. In December 2019 it was announced that she will become the Dean of the College of Science at Northeastern University in June 2020. Education Sive received her Bachelor of Science with honors in 1979 from the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa with a double major in zoology and chemistry. She left South Africa for England where she taught secondary school science. She then went to the United States for graduate studies in molecular biology under Robert G. Roeder. She received a PhD from Rockefeller University in 1986. Research Sive is a pioneer in many research areas and has developed multiple techniques. These include analysis of the extreme anterior domain (EAD), a unique and important embryonic region she named. She used a simple anterior organ, the mucus-secreting cement gland of the frog Xenopus, to define the genetic network required for anterior position. The EAD also gives rise to the mouth and the Sive group has defined key steps necessary for mouth formation. Using their ‚Äòfacial transplant‚Äô technique, her group made the unprecedented discovery that the EAD is also a facial signaling center, which guides neural crest cells into the developing face, where they form the jaws and other structures. Since the EAD is present in humans, the work is directly relevant for understanding human craniofacial anomalies. Another focus of Sive‚Äôs research has been nervous system patterning. Using novel techniques in subtractive cloning, her laboratory defined some of the earliest molecular markers and regulators of the nervous system in both Xenopus and the zebrafish Danio. Expression of these genes answered the age-old question of when the embryo decides to make a nervous system: Sive showed that future brain cells are set aside when the embryo is just a ball of cells. Function of these genes, including otx2 and zic1 (opl), was studied using hormone-inducible fusion proteins, a technique first used in embryos by Sive. She also developed the first zebrafish ‚Äòexplant‚Äô culture method, and so identified cell interactions that initiate brain development. As well, Sive identified retinoic acid as a regulator of brain patterning, and demonstrated its activity on expression of hindbrain Hox genes. And she defined additional roles for fibroblast growth factors in precise patterning of the hindbrain. As structure and function are closely allied, Sive also focuses on how three- dimensional structure of the brain is generated by the processes of morphogenesis. Sive first identified and named ‚Äúbasal constriction‚Äù as a cell- shape-change occurring during brain morphogenesis. In addition, she identified and named the process of ‚Äúepithelial relaxation,‚Äù a cell-sheet-stretching process that occurs as brain ventricles form. Indeed, she pioneered use of zebrafish to study the brain ventricular system‚Äîcavities filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that form the body‚Äôs ‚Äúthird circulation.‚Äù Using a unique drainage assay, Sive identified Retinol Binding Protein in the CSF as essential for survival of brain cells. Sive has a long-standing interest in neurodevelopmental disorders, including those relating to mental health. A great challenge is that these disorders often involve multiple genes, whose contributions to a disorder is frequently unclear. Sive pioneered zebrafish as a tool for probing gene function associated with autism spectrum disorders. Her group has identified genes that interact and contribute to brain dysfunction in the prevalent and serious 16p11.2 deletion syndrome, most recently implicating lipid metabolism in symptomatology. Besides running her eponymous lab, she is also a faculty member at the Whitehead Institute. She began teaching at MIT in 1991 and was chosen as a Searle Scholar the following year. She received the National Science Foundation Young Investigator Award in 1992, as well. Academic roles In 1993, Sive founded the Cold Spring Harbor Course on Early Development of Xenopus and taught this together with colleagues Richard Harland and Robert Grainger. As of 2019, this course continues to run annually. In 2015, she was named a MacVicar Faculty Fellow, MIT‚Äôs highest award for undergraduate teaching She additionally received the MIT School of Science Teaching Award (2003) and MIT‚Äôs Alan J. Lazarus Advising Award in 2016. She teaches on campus, and several of her courses are offered through the MIT OpenCourseWare online initiative. Sive was chair of the MIT Biology Undergraduate Program (2003-2006) and served as the first Associate Dean for the MIT School of Science (2006-2013), with oversight for education and equity. During her tenure in that role, she was instrumental in compiling the 2011 Report on the Status of Women Faculty in the MIT Schools of Science and Engineering, which uncovered both positive aspects as well as an ongoing need for oversight of female faculty trajectory. Sive has served aschair of MIT‚Äôs Committee on Student Life and as founding chair of MIT‚Äôs Faculty Postdoctoral Advisory Committee. In 2014, Sive founded and is Director of the MIT-Africa initiative, leading the Africa Advisory Committee to write a Strategic Plan for MIT Engagement in Africa. In 2017, Sive was named Director of Higher Education at the MIT Jameel World Education Lab (J-WEL).

It is 95 km travel distance via North‚ÄìSouth Expressway from Johor Bahru to Yong Peng, and another 77 km from Federal Route 1. Strategically situated between Kuala Lumpur and Johor Bahru, Segamat is a fast-growing agricultural oil palm and rubber district, famous for its delicious durians, hence its recent slogan to attract tourists: Selamat Datang ke Segamat - Tanah Raja Buah-buahan (Malay: Welcome to Segamat - The Land of the King of Fruits). The eponymous town is a typical medium size town with a blend of old and new cultures. A mere 45 minute drive from town offers a variety of hiking and swimming sites namely the famous Gunung Ledang, Air Panas Waterfall and Bekok Waterfall which make an enjoyable weekend getaway. History Segamat Town (Bandar Segamat) in Segamat District According to local historian, Hassan bin Muhammad, the area used to be known as Rantau Panjang. In around 1511, a Bendahara of Malacca, Bendahara Tepok and his troops were retreating to Johor after the fall of Melaka to the invading Portuguese forces led by Afonso de Albuquerque. The Bendahara and his troops stopped and rested by a river in the area and drank water from the river. After the drink, the Bendahara exclaimed, \\"Segar amat!\\" (Malay: \\"Very refreshing!\\"), and named the river Segar Amat, in which over time evolved into Segamat. The name Segamat was initially applied only to the river, whereas the settlement nearby was still called Rantau Panjang. The town assumed the river's name only at the turn of the 20th century. Buyong Adil in his Natural History of Malay Chapter V (Sejarah Alam Melayu Penggal V) wrote that Segamat is a state of the 9 states of Negeri Sembilan, said the results of the above events. Martin Lister, the British Resident of Negeri Sembilan in 1895 - 1897 also mentioned that Segamat was one of the states that Negeri Sembilan was once ruled by Temenggong Abd. Rahman and appointed Temenggong Konit to administer Segamat / Muar from 1801. By 1900, Segamat, along with Klang and Naning was seceded to neighbouring states by Negeri Sembilan. This has caused Segamat to be annexed by Johor. By the end of the 19th century, the four original districts have several minor subdistricts, for example the previous Muar District has 4 minor districts - Parit Jawa, Chohong, Lenga and Segamat. The first District Officer of Segamat Minor District was Encik Menthol bin Haji Ahmad. In 1933, the district of Segamat was formed after a major district boundary realignment was made by the government of Johor to split the original 4 districts (Muar, Batu Pahat, Johor Bahru and Sedili) into 8 districts (before the 2008 realignment which added the Kulai and Tangkak districts to form 10 districts in Johor). After the formation of Segamat District, the government began to develop Segamat, mainly with agricultural activities to boost the economy of Segamat. This included the construction of the national railroad system passing the town of Segamat and also the construction of the main road known today as Federal Route 1. In the 1970s, Tun Razak Highway was constructed to boost the economy of Segamat as an agricultural hub, to shorten the travelling time to Kuantan and to speed up the development progress of the poorly developed areas in southern Pahang. The Johor branch campus of Universiti Teknologi MARA was constructed at Jementah in the end of the 1980s and started its operation in 1991. The construction of UiTM campus in Segamat district turned Segamat into another important educational hub in Johor besides Skudai, which houses Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. In 1996, the Segamat Land Port was constructed to make Segamat an important transportational hub, like Nilai in Negeri Sembilan. By constructing the land port, manufacturers may just transport their goods to Segamat Land Port and then the goods can be transported to the nearest sea ports such as Pasir Gudang by train and this will increase the transportation efficiency. However, the plan did not materialise as planned; the space is subsequently rendered largely vacant as of latest 3 February 2012. In 1999, the second bridge of Segamat, funded mainly by private developers, was constructed to reduce congestion at the main bridge. The second bridge was included as a part of Segamat Inner Ring Road package consisting the road upgrade to 4-lane road at Jalan Pemuda, Jalan Hassan, Jalan Pee Kang Hai and Jalan Chia Chin Koon, which was completed in August 2005. The inner ring road package is useful to divert the traffic flow when the main roads at the town center are closed for special occasions and events such as National Day. Segamat experienced floods during the 1950s, 1984 and recently on 18 December 2006. The one in 2006, which was caused by Typhoon Utor in the Philippines, was generally considered to be the worst flood to have happened in Segamat and Johor. There is a conspiracy theory that the 2006 flood was caused by improper release of water from the upstream Bekok Dam. The theory is based on the fact that the water level of the Segamat River overflowed at a rate which was believed impossible to have been caused by rain alone. In January 2011, severe flooding occurred in Segamat and other parts of upstate Johor and the neighbouring state of Melaka, with about 31,000 people evacuated and several deaths.\\"Segamat Cut Off\\", theSun, 1 February 2011 Segamat has been upgraded to Municipal Council since 1 January 2018 at Dataran Segamat.  Townscape  Segamat Square The town of Segamat is the fifth largest town in the state of Johor with about 80,000 residents. According to local residents of Segamat, the town centre of Segamat can be divided into two, where both neighbourhoods are separated by Segamat River:- * Bandar Atas (Uptown) - The original town centre of Segamat. The official site of Segamat town centre today is Dataran Segamat, or Segamat Square. * Bandar Seberang (Crosstown) - Located at the other side across Segamat river. This neighbourhood is known as Bandar Seberang because of its location across Segamat river. This area houses most of the supermarkets and shopping centres in Segamat. In addition to the town centre, the urban area of Segamat also covers some villages and towns namely Pekan Jabi, Bukit Siput, Segamat Baru and Bandar Putra Segamat, which makes up the overall population of Segamat urban area to 100,000 residents. The cost of living in Segamat is relatively affordable. Accommodation is readily available at the housing areas in Segamat town. Shophouses, supermarkets, restaurants and hawker centres in the proximity offer various and inexpensive choices for shopping, chilling out and eating out. A popular shopping market in Malaysia, Giant has also been constructed here. Economy Agriculture is the main contributor of Segamat's economy, contributing about 61.8% of the total employment in 1991. The second economic contributor is manufacturing sector, with 13.1% of total work force in 1995. This is followed by the government service sector, with 12.2% of total work force in the same year. = Commercial areas = The only shopping complex was built and started opening since year 2012 in Segamat named OneSegamat Mall, which is located adjoining the bus & taxi terminal and adjacent to the railway station, thus enjoying great traffic flow of shoppers and commuters creating excellent business potentials and sales prospects. The complex has the only cinema in Segamat located in its first floor, an 8-screen cinema operated by Lotus Five Star with a capacity around 1,800 people. In the same year, a popular shopping KIP MART was built at the Bandar Utama. Wisma Jakel is the most famous in Segamat =Shopping= *OneSegamat *Billion Shopping Centre *Billion Yayasan *Econsave Segamat *Kipmart *Nirwana Supermarket *Nirwana Yayasan *Housemaker Complex *Arked Sri Genuang *Arked Mara *Cowboy Transportation =Car= Segamat is well-linked by both federal and state road networks. Highway , the main north‚Äìsouth trunk road of Peninsular Malaysia, runs through the town centre of Segamat. The national expressway PLUS does not serve Segamat; motorists using PLUS are however able to get to Segamat by leaving the PLUS expressway at Exit 235 - Tangkak Interchange (from Kuala Lumpur), Exit 242 - Yong Peng South Interchange and Exit 241 - Yong Peng North Interchange (from Johor Bahru). From Exit 235, motorists can then use highway and head north towards Segamat. Highway joins Segamat to Tangkak and terminates at Muar. Meanwhile, motorists from the east coast especially Pahang, can access Segamat through Tun Razak Highway (highway ), which connects Segamat through Muadzam Shah to Gambang near Kuantan. Besides, there are several main state roads in Segamat, namely: * - Jalan Pogoh * - Jalan Muar-Labis * - Jalan Batu Enam * - Jalan Bekok * - Jalan Tasek Alai =Public transportation= Segamat Public Transportation Terminal Rail Segamat town has one railway station offering KTM Intercity services. However since 2016, diesel trains on the Intercity service only ply between Johor Bahru and Tumpat, Kelantan. Direct services to Segamat and the east coast are no longer possible from Kuala Lumpur and further north. Passengers are required to switch to the ETS service (electrified Intercity trains) at Gemas, Negeri Sembilan. Other stations in the Segamat constituency include Batu Anam, not in active service since 2017. Road There are three main intercity bus lines that serve the Segamat:- * Yow Hoe (Gemas-Ayer Hitam) * North-West Johor (Segamat-Muar) * Kenderaan Bas MARA-DARA (Segamat- Muadzam Shah) using highway Notable natives * Yeo Bee Yin (Batu Anam), Minister of Energy, Technology, Science, Climate Change and Environment * Lee Boon Chye * Penny Tai References External links * Segamat.com.my - Segamat Community Website * YM Ungku Mohd.

The event took place on May 5, 2001 at Kawasaki Stadium in Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan. The event marked the return of FMW to the Kawasaki Stadium since Fall Spectacular in 1997. The event commemorated the twelfth anniversary of the promotion and was the final edition of the Anniversary Show as the promotion closed on February 15, 2002. In the main event, Tetsuhiro Kuroda and Mr. Gannosuke took on Hayabusa and The Great Sasuke in an exploding 15000 volt thunderbolt octagon cage electric bomb deathmatch, which Hayabusa won by pinning Gannosuke. In another important match of the event, Genichiro Tenryu of WAR defeated Kodo Fuyuki. Background =Production= On March 13, 2001, FMW held a pay-per-view event at Korakuen Hall which was headlined by a match between Tetsuhiro Kuroda and Kintaro Kanemura. The event was a failure as it drew a crowd of only 2,000 people and FMW started preparing for its 12th Anniversary Show, which marked FMW's return to the historic Kawasaki Stadium after 1997's Fall Spectacular. The event was conducted in the parking lot of the Kawasaki Stadium. =Storylines= Hayabusa made his return to FMW after six months in the main event of 12th Anniversary Show. At Deep Throat, Tetsuhiro Kuroda defeated Mr. Gannosuke in a match which stipulated that Gannosuke must retire if he lost. Later that night, Kodo Fuyuki defeated Hayabusa to retain the WEW World Heavyweight Championship and then announced that he was taking time off due to injury and would return to FMW at 12th Anniversary Show on May 5, 2001. Tetshiro Kuroda turned heel by attacking Hayabusa and proclaiming himself the new ace of FMW. On November 28, Kuroda turned on his tag team partner Masato Tanaka during a three-way match against Jado and Gedo and the team of Kodo Fuyuki and Kintaro Kanemura, which led to a six-man tag team match pitting Fuyuki, Kanemura and Kuroda against Tanaka, Jado and Gedo, which Kuroda's team won. This led Masato Tanaka to form Complete Players with Jado and Gedo. On December 20, Fuyuki, Kanemura and Kuroda defeated Complete Players in a barbed wire match and Kuroda confronted Hayabusa after the match at ringside and Hayabusa marched to confront Kuroda but Mr. Gannosuke held him back. On January 7, 2001, Kuroda established himself as FMW's top heel when he turned on Kodo Fuyuki during a title defense of the WEW World Tag Team Championship against Masato Tanaka and Gedo on January 7, 2001. Kuroda then formed Team Kuroda with a bunch of FMW's mid-card villains. On February 6, Kuroda called out Hayabusa for a confrontation after his match and then goaded him into getting attacked by The Masked Sumo, who hit a chair on Hayabusa's injured arms until The Great Sasuke returned to FMW to make the save. On February 23, Kodo Fuyuki and The Great Sasuke defeated Kuroda and Mammoth Sasaki when Sasuke pinned Kuroda, setting up a Naked Man Deathmatch between the two on March 5, which Kuroda won. On March 13, Mr. Gannosuke helped Kuroda defeat Kintaro Kanemura to become the #1 contender for the WEW World Heavyweight Championship. On April 1, Kuroda defeated Kodo Fuyuki, with Gannosuke's help, to win the WEW World Heavyweight Championship and then Gannosuke joined Team Kuroda. Shortly after, it was announced that Kuroda and Gannosuke would take on Hayabusa and The Great Sasuke in Hayabusa's return match, an Exploding 15000 Volt Thunderbolt Octagon Cage Bomb Deathmatch at the 12th Anniversary Show. On April 15, Kuroda, Gannosuke and Mammoth Sasaki defeated GOEMON, Onryo and The Great Sasuke in a match and then Hayabusa tried to make the rescue for Sasuke but got attacked and then Gannosuke ripped off Sasuke's match and wore it to mock Hayabusa and Sasuke. On April 1, Mammoth Sasaki defeated Kintaro Kanemura to win the WEW Hardcore Championship, setting up a rematch between the two for the title at 12th Anniversary Show. Kodo Fuyuki had beaten FMW owner Atsushi Onita at 9th Anniversary Show on April 30, 1998 in a match stemming from their legitimate rivalry over the backstage influence in FMW, which ultimately led to Onita's departure from FMW on November 20. Fuyuki planned on reviving the rivalry and setting up a rematch between the two at 12th Anniversary Show but talks with Onita fell down and Genichiro Tenryu was roped in to replace Onita and return to FMW as a WAR representative and face Fuyuki in a match at 12th Anniversary Show to resolve the feud between Tenryu and Fuyuki which had begun in the WAR promotion during the mid-1990s. Event =Preliminary matches= In the opening match, Ricky Fuji and Satoru Makita took on Tomokazu Morita and Yoshihito Sasaki. In the end, Fuji executed a Kamikaze and a DDT to Sasaki for the win. After the match, Morita tried to attack Fuji but Fuji countered by hitting him with a DDT. Next, Shinjuku Shark took on the mixed martial artist Tarec Pasca. In the end, Shark hit a moonsault for the win. Next, the team of Flying Kid Ichihara, Hisakatsu Oya, Survival Tobita and Tomomi Tanimoto took on Azusa Kudo, Kaoruko Arai, Naohiko Yamazaki and Saitama Gorilla in an eight- person tag team match. Oya hit an enzuigiri and two consecutive backdrop suplexes to Yamazaki, allowing Tanimoto to pin Yamazaki for the win. Next, Ricky Banderas defended the IWA World Heavyweight Championship against Chocoball Mukai. In the end, Banderas hit a brainbuster and a diving crossbody on Mukai to win the match and retain the title. Next, the team of Emi Motokawa and Kyoko Inoue took on Ayako Hamada and AKINO. In the end, Hamada hit a Hama- chan Cutter to Motokawa for the win. In the following match, Mammoth Sasaki defended the WEW Hardcore Championship against Kintaro Kanemura. In the end, Kanemura hit a German suplex, a Baku Yama Special and a double underhook powerbomb to Sasaki to win the title. Later, GOEMON and Onryo defended the WEW World Tag Team Championship against the team of Super Crazy and Super Nova. In the end, GOEMON delivered a diving senton to Nova to retain the titles. In the penultimate match, Kodo Fuyuki took on Genichiro Tenryu in a match in which Ashura Hara served as the special guest referee for the match. In the end, Tenryu hit a series of lariats to Fuyuki for the win. =Main event match= The main event was an Exploding 15000 Volt Thunderbolt Octagon Cage Bomb Deathmatch pitting the WEW World Heavyweight Champion Tetsuhiro Kuroda and Mr. Gannosuke against Hayabusa and The Great Sasuke. In the end, Hayabusa hit a H Thunder to Gannosuke for the win. Reception The event received negative reviews from Stuart of Puroresu Central, who considered it a \\"disappointing show\\". He compared it to be better than the previous year's event. He appreciated the AKINO/Hamada vs. Motokawa/Inoue joshi tag team match as the best match of the show while criticized Tenryu/Fuyuki and the main event for not living \\"up to their potential\\", with \\"For a regular FMW PPV, where you have to lower the standards, this show would have been good, but this was their big event.\\" The show drew a crowd of 10,500, the biggest crowd for the company since 1997's Fall Spectacular due to its return to Kawasaki Stadium as they were holding their shows at smaller venues where they could not draw much crowds.

In 1935, she was the first woman to become a storyboard artist for Walt Disney Productions. Life and career Born in Rome, Italy, Majolie was born Bianca Maggioli. She attended art classes in School of the Art Institute of Chicago and McKinley High School. While studying at McKinley, her French teacher, Josephine Mack, changed her to Blanche Majolie. Meanwhile, Walt Disney served his freshman year at McKinley, but dropped out to volunteer in the Red Cross in 1918. Majolie claimed she \\"did not know him or his friends personally, and saw him only once on the day after he came back to school dressed in his G.I. uniform to say good-bye [at the end of World War I]. I was graduating mid- term, handed him my girl grad-book, and he drew pictures in it.\\" After graduating, Majolie studied figure painting and design at the Grand Central School of Art, clay sculpturing at Art Students League, and \\"drawing for line continuity\\" at Leonardo da Vinci Art School in New York. In 1929, she worked as a freelance artist on fashion assignments for Earnshaw Publications, and served for five years at J.C. Penney as an art director and brochure designer until 1934. At the same time, she submitted a comic strip about a girl named Stella who was trying to find a job during the Great Depression for a contest held by King Features Syndicate. In 1934, Majolie submitted a letter to Disney expressing interest in working for his animation department. The two held lunch at the Tam O'Shanter Inn where based on the strength of her samples of \\"Stella\\", he hired her to serve in the story department. In 1935, the story department was predominantly male with at least fifteen men where story conferences were mostly held for slapstick-driven ideas. That same year, Majolie submitted a thirteen-page outline entitled \\"The Romance of Baby Elephant\\", which went into production as the Silly Symphony cartoon, Elmer Elephant. Her affectionate story would later be praised by animators Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston where they wrote the following about her contributions: \\"We could not have made any of the feature films without learning this important lesson: Pathos gives comedy the heart and warmth that keeps it from becoming brittle.\\" In 1937, she was commissioned by Disney to provide a new English translation of the Carlo Collodi novel, The Adventures of Pinocchio, for his animated film adaptation. In 1938, she wrote several outlines and provided visual development artwork for early versions of Cinderella and Peter Pan. That same year, she partnered with artist Al Heath to provide conceptual artwork on the Nutcracker Suite segment in Fantasia. Following her work on The Ugly Duckling, Majolie took a sabbatical leave from Disney claiming she had \\"lost interest\\". She returned in June 1940 where she was informed that she was fired. After her career at Disney, Majolie married American artist Carl Heilborn in 1942. She later worked on private commissions for glass panels and ceramic art sculptures, and briefly returned to Chicago to illustrate her book The Children's Treasury. In 1953, they opened the Heilborn Studio Gallery in Los Angeles where they featured their work and that of other artists. Heilborn later died of a heart attack on April 26, 1954.

The city continued to develop into the Early Dynastic Period (Mesopotamia) around 2900-2350 BCE. Considered one of the first cities, the site of Uruk ‚Äì modern-day Warka in Iraq ‚Äì shows evidence of social stratification, institutionalized religion, a centralized administration, and what art historians would categorize as high art and architecture, the first in the long history of the art of Mesopotamia. Much of the art of Uruk shows a high technical skill and was often made using precious materials.  Sculpture  Sumerian dignitary, Uruk, circa 3300-3000 BCE. National Museum of Iraq. Fragment of a Bull Figurine from Uruk, c. 3000 BCE Votive sculptures in the form of small animal figurines have been found at Uruk, using a style mixing naturalistic and abstract elements in order to capture the spiritual essence of the animal, rather than depicting an entirely anatomically accurate figure. The use of animal figures as votive offerings as opposed to human figures probably replaces a ritual act of animal sacrifice and makes it eternal by leaving the image of the sacrificed animal in the temple. Many of these animal votives were discovered at Uruk Level III (c. 3000 BCE) and would have been offered to the goddess Inanna in return for her favor. A group of objects dubbed Kleinfunde or \\"small finds\\" by excavators was also discovered in Uruk. The collection of small objects consisted of animal figures inlaid with stone, and vessels that would have been used for rituals in the temple but had since gone out of use and were subsequently buried in sacred ground rather than discarded unceremoniously. Similar animal figures could have been used as amulets or cylinder seal handles. Warka Vase in the National Museum of Iraq. = Narrative art = Uruk is also the find place of two of the oldest examples of narrative art, the Uruk Trough and the Warka Vase. Though it could not have functioned as a basin, the limestone Uruk Trough could have functioned as a cult image in the temple of Inanna and shows flocks of sheep carved in relief approaching a reed hut with lambs coming out of the structure. According to the British Museum where this object is held, the scene with sheep could represent the fertility of the flock while it is under Inanna's protection, although the \\"animals emerging from a hut\\" motif could also be associated with agricultural practice where shepherds would separate ewes and lambs during the day to help conserve the ewe's milk. The Uruk or Warka Vase depicts a religious banquet, probably associated with an agricultural festival, that is connected to rituals involving the goddess Inanna. The vase is divided into four registers: the bottom register depicts water, plants, and ears of wheat; the second depicts right-facing sheep; the third depicts left-facing nude priests with offering vessels; and the fourth and top register depicts a ‚Äúpriest-king‚Äù (damaged) and attendant moving right to approach Inanna herself, who can be identified by the two reed gateposts leading into her temple filled with offerings behind her. This order of registers from bottom to top could reflect the social hierarchy and loosely represent the ranked administration that has been identified in the city of Uruk. = Mask of Warka = In addition to narrative art, one of the most famous examples of sculpture found at Uruk is the marble head of a goddess, the Mask of Warka or Lady of Warka, which most likely represents Inanna. It was discovered in the Eanna district at Uruk. Dating to circa 3100 BCE, it is probably from one of the earliest known near life-size sculptures. The face of the sculpture was most likely inlaid with precious stones such as lapis lazuli. The head once belonged to a larger composite statue of the goddess, which was most likely made out of wood. As with the votive animal figurines, the style has abstract elements such as the eyebrows which would have been inlaid with stone, as well as naturalistic elements, such as the soft, rounded cheeks and lips.  Seals  Beginning in the Middle Uruk period, traditional stamp seals were replaced by cylinder seals. Uruk was the first civilization to make use of cylinder seals, a practice that would eventually permeate the entirety of the ancient Near East, as well as Bronze Age Greece. Cylinder seals were used by individuals and were a marker of one's identity as they acted as a signature and were used for officiating documents. The small objects were cylindrical in shape and were engraved with metal tools. The carving was done in such a way that the seals could be rolled onto clay in order to make an impression. Broken clay seal impressions have been found amongst the same layers of debris on Eanna Level IV where early clay writing tablets have been found. Though many of the recovered cylinder seals used to make such impressions are made of stone, there is also evidence that the people of Uruk used metal over bitumen, shell, and clay to create cylinder seals. The use of stone seals as signatures implies the existence of a complex administrative system in ancient Uruk. The subject matter depicted on the seal varied from kings and livestock to more religious subjects such as symbols of the gods. Cylinder seal and seal impression with serpopards and eagles from the Uruk period (4100-3000 BCE)  Pottery  Beveled-rim bowl, c. 3400-3200 BCE Pottery found at Uruk includes wheel made, hand-made and molded pieces. Potters at Uruk specialized in mass-produced functional vessels. The fast potter's wheel was introduced during the later part of the Uruk period, making it quicker and easier to produce pottery on a massive scale and with a greater sense of standardization. Thousands of beveled rim bowls have been found at the site, and it has been theorized that they were used to measure rations for families or dependant laborers. Another innovation in pottery invented and used by the potters of Uruk is the ceramic ring scraper. As the exportation of ceramics began, the weight of a large vessel became problematic when travelling as a trader. The ring scraper allowed excess, unnecessary material to be scraped from a vessel before firing, making the piece much lighter and easier to carry through town or across the desert. Because of the ability for artists to create pottery on a mass scale, the pottery of Uruk could be distributed to other parts of what is now modern Iraq. Studies have shown that Uruk pottery seemed to be more popular in northern Iraq than it was in southern Iraq.  Writing  Early writing tablet, c. 3100-3000 BCE Archaeologists have found what are considered to be the oldest written texts at Uruk. From the start of excavation at Uruk in the early 1900s, archaeologists found clay tablets with pictographic signs that were recognized as precursors to cuneiform script. This ‚Äúproto-cuneiform‚Äù was drawn into the clay using a pointed tool and additional circular impressions symbolized numbers. Dated to around 3200 BCE, these earliest tablets were found amongst discarded materials in pits on Eanna Level IV and would most likely have been used to seal containers and doors. Approximately 4000 clay tablets and fragments from this level have been found. Most of these tablets would have recorded economic transactions and administrative texts such as exchanges of goods and the allocation of rations for workers, and some record the number of livestock born into a given herd, as well as the amount of livestock, such as sheep and rams, that would have been allocated to individual owners. One written text provides evidence of the social stratification of the city, listing 120 officials including the city leader as well as those who led the law, the plow, and the lambs. This same text also provides special terms for priests, metalsmiths, and potters. By the third millennium BCE, other genres of writing, including poetry, mathematics, and sciences, began to appear.  Architecture  Location of main ruins within city of Uruk The largest remaining ruins at Uruk are the temple structures near the center of the city. The ruins, which consist of an approximately 6 square kilometer area, are encircled by a city wall. Uruk temple architecture followed the building plans of the previous Ubaid culture. Structures were made on tripartite plans with a central hall and smaller rooms on either side. One of the most famous examples of Uruk temples is the White Temple, named after the white gypsum plaster that covered it. The White Temple, dedicated to the god Anu was built upon a platform 13 meters high. This style is a predecessor to the ziggurat formations that would come later in Mesopotamian history. Unlike later temples, the White Temple lacks a central niche. There is evidence for buildings in Uruk used for cult purposes which were richly decorated and that contained altars for worship to the various gods. For example, within Temple C in the Eanna District, pillars containing cone mosaic panels were discovered by excavators. To create these panels, dated to around 3300-3000 BCE, 10-centimeter cones of baked clay or gypsum were arranged and pressed into wet plaster and painted to create diamond, triangle, and zigzag patterns.

S. chamaejasme is a herbaceous perennial plant with heads of white, pink or yellow flowers, grown as an ornamental plant in rock gardens and alpine houses, but considered a weed playing a r√¥le in the desertification of grasslands in parts of its native range. Like many others of its family, it is a poisonous plant with medicinal and other useful properties.

World Health Organization, Regional Office for the Western Pacific Region 2013 http://www.wpro.who.int/publications/Medicinal_Plants_in_Mongolia_VF.pdf Description Stellera chamaejasme is a herbaceous perennial. Unbranched stems, 20‚Äì30 cm tall, emerge in a cluster from an underground rhizome. Narrow, overlapping leaves are borne along the stems. Individual leaves are narrow and pointed, up to 2 cm long. The flowers are grouped into rounded tightly packed terminal heads. Flowers lack petals, instead having petaloid sepals forming a tube up to 1.5 cm long with usually five (but possibly four or six) short lobes at the end. The flower colour varies from shades of pink and white to yellow. There are twice as many stamens as calyx lobes, in two series. The ovary has a single chamber (locule). The fruit is a dry drupe, enclosed by the remains of the calyx. Taxonomy Jasminum polyanthum in bloom, showing wine- red exteriors of corollas reminiscent of those of Stellera (re. species name chamaejasme i.e. \\"ground jasmine\\"). The genus Stellera was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753. He recognized two species: Stellera passerina (now placed in the genus Thymelaea as T. passerina) and Stellera chamaejasme. The generic name Stellera (not to be confused with the entirely unrelated Stellaria) commemorates Georg Wilhelm Steller (St√∂ller), while the specific epithet chamaejasme is a rendering into botanical Latin orthography of the Greek œáŒ±ŒºŒ±ŒØ khamai \\"(down) on the ground\\" and ŒπŒ±œÉŒºŒµ iasme \\"jasmine\\". The name in its entirety thus means \\"Steller's plant that resembles a kind of jasmine (that creeps) on the ground\\". The flower of Stellera chamaejasme is fragrant like that of jasmine and also has a wine-red exterior, like that of certain species of jasmine, e.g. common jasmine Jasminum officinale and the Chinese species Jasminum polyanthum. Unlike jasmine, however, Stellera is a herbaceous plant, not a woody one, and its stems do not twine. Many species names were later created in the genus, but all are now usually considered synonyms of other species, including S. chamaejasme, although the Flora of China states that there are 10 to 12 species. Studies in 2002 and 2009, based on chloroplast DNA, placed Stellera in a small group of related genera, either as sister to Wikstroemia or embedded within it; however for most genera only one species was included. Distribution and habitat Stellera chamaejasme is native to northern and western China, Tibet, the Himalayas (Nepal, Bhutan), the state of Uttar Pradesh in north India, Russia and Mongolia. In China, it is found on sunny dry slopes and sandy places between 2600 and 4200 m. Cultivation Stellera chamaejasme is cultivated as an ornamental plant in rock gardens and alpine houses. It is considered difficult to grow, needing a sunny position and gritty soil if grown outside, or a large pot if grown under cover. It is propagated by seed.

A work on native Chinese medicinal plants aimed at farmers states that Stellera is a very poisonous plant used as an insecticide and that, if consumed by an animal, will cause the victim's intestines to disintegrate.Chung kuo t'u nung yao chih - A Chinese native medicinal flora for farmers, preface by Kuo Mo-j'o, Director, Acad. Sinica and compiled by a committee (gives brief account of medicinal use of each plant and fuller account of insecticidal properties) pub. Beijing, 1959. Corroboration of this evidence for the damaging effect upon the intestines of certain plants belonging to the Thymelaceae may be found in an account of \\"Lasiosiphon kraussianus Hutch. & Dalz. \\" (referable, possibly to Lasiosiphon kraussianus (Meisn.) Meisn. or a Gnidia sp.) of South Africa: the plant is exceedingly poisonous and rapidly fatal to stock: the intestines of an animal perforate about a day after eating it. This lethal property is put to use by certain African tribes who use the powdered root of the plant to poison waterholes during the rainy season, the poison remaining potent for seven days and killing any animal which drinks it.Medicinal and Poisonous Plants of Southern and Eastern Africa 2nd edition,Watt J.M.& Breyer-Brandwijk M.G. pub.E.&S.Livingstone; Ltd. 1962 page 1024-5. The plant family to which Stellera belongs - Thymelaceae - is notable for the number of poisonous species which it contains and also for a certain similarity in chemistry to the family Euphorbiaceae, both families having a number of genera producing phorbol esters.Wink, Michael and van Wyk, Ben-Erik, Mind-Altering and Poisonous Plants of the World, A Scientifically Accurate Guide to 1200 Toxic and Intoxicating Plants , pub.

It is interesting to note, in this context, that Chinese herbal medicine recognises a similarity in action between Stellera and certain Euphorbia species: Perry (1980)Perry, Lily M. assisted by Metzger, Judith Medicinal Plants of East and Southeast Asia, pub.

E. pallasii Turcz.) and Euphorbia sieboldiana Morr. & Decne. are listed under the same heading (no. 86, langdu) - and as possessing the same or very similar medicinal properties: pungent, poisonous plants used as cathartics, anthelmintics, expectorants, also used topically to treat ulcers and skin diseases. Chemistry and properties The principal constituents of Stellera chamaejasme include, among others, flavonoids, coumarins, lignans and diterpenoids. A recent work on the medicinal plants of Mongolia notes the presence in the root (rhizome) of sugars, organic acids, saponins and tannins and the following specific compounds: the flavonoids 5,7-dihydroxy-4‚Äô,11-dimethoxy-3‚Äô,14-dimethylbenzoflavanone, ruixianglangdusu A and B, 4‚Äô,4‚Äô‚Äù,5,5‚Äù,7,7‚Äù-hexahydroxy-3,3‚Äù-biflavone, 7-methoxyneochamaejasmin A; the coumarins: sfondine, isobergapten, pimpinellin, isopimpinellin, umbelliferone, daphniretin, bicoumastechamin and daphnetin; diterpenes (unspecified); the lignans: (+)-kusunokinin, lirioresinol-B, magnolenin C, (-)-pinoresinol monomethyl ether, (-)-pinoresinol, (+)-matairesinol, isohinokinin, and (-)-eudesmin; and the steroids: daucosterol, Œ≤-sitosterol. Above-ground parts of the plant were found to contain the coumarins: daphnorin, daphnetin, daphnoretin, daphnetin 8-O-b-D-glycopyranoside and chamaejasmoside. A scientific paper of 2015 refers to this plant - regarded as a choice and hard-to-grow ornamental by European and American gardeners - as being one of the most toxic of grassland weeds in the range where it is native and notes that cattle which consume its shoots and flowers may be fatally poisoned. The paper notes further that populations of the plant are in no way endangered, having been flourishing and increasing for some years: this appears to be due not simply to the plant's competing vigorously with other species for water and nutrients, but also to its containing / secreting herbicidal compounds.Water and ethanol extracts of S. chamaejasme inhibited seed germination and/or seedling growth in no fewer than 13 plant species, and the phytotoxic effects were stronger upon dicotyledonous plants than upon monocotyledonous plants. The phytotoxic compounds were observed to be liberated particularly by dead or moribund specimens of S. chamaejasme and to lead to reduced seedling growth in the grasses Lolium perenne L., Psathyrostachys juncea (Fisch.) Nevski and Bromus inermis Leyss. and the legumes Melilotus suaveolens Ledeb. (see Melilotus), Onobrychis viciifolia Scop. (sainfoin) and Medicago sativa L. (alfalfa). Furthermore, pesticidal properties were confirmed to be present in S. chameajasme: the ethanolic extract of S. chameajasme strongly inhabited the growth of the following insect pests: the butterfly Pieris rapae, the aphid Myzus persicae and the corn-borer moth Ostrinia furnacalis, and showed contact and oral toxicities against two other stem-borer moths which are pests of rice: Sesamia inferens and Chilo suppressalis.

He also wrote poetry in other forms, as well as prose fiction and non-fiction critical and scholarly works on Japanese classical literature. He was a lecturer at Waseda University.  Biography  Utsubo Kubota was born on 8 June 1877. He was born in Wada Village, Higashichikuma District (modern-day Matsumoto City), Nagano Prefecture. His real name was Ts≈´ji Kubota (Á™™Áî∞ ÈÄöÊ≤ª Kubota Ts≈´ji). He graduated the School of Letters at the T≈çky≈ç Senmon Gakk≈ç (present-day Waseda University). After working as a reporter for various newspapers and magazines, he returned to Waseda to become a lecturer on literature. He died in 12 April 1967.  Writings  Kubota was a leading poet of the Japanese Naturalist school. He wrote many tanka, as well as poems of other forms such as the ch≈çka. He first came to the attention of the poet Tekkan Yosano for a tanka he published in the magazine Bunko in 1900. Early in his literary career he published shintaishi (poetry in modern forms) and tanka in Tekkan's important magazine My≈çj≈ç, but left after less than a year. In 1905 he published the anthology Mahiruno („Åæ„Å≤„ÇãÈáé). It was also around this time that he took an interest in the philosophy of Naturalism and began writing prose fiction, researching classical Japanese literature, and engaging in literary criticism. 1911 saw the publication of his short story collection Rohen (ÁÇâËæ∫). In 1912 he published Utsubo Kash≈´ (Á©∫Á©ÇÊ≠åÈõÜ), with the intention of distancing himself from tanka, but he continued to write them throughout his career.  Reception  Literary historian and critic Donald Keene wrote of Kubota that he \\"attained his greatest distinction as a poet relatively late in life\\", contrasting him in this sense to the poets associated with the magazine My≈çj≈ç. He went on to note that \\"[Kubota's] poetry often has a perfection of diction that defies translation, though his themes and imagery are less compelling compelling\\" than other Naturalist poets.

Her instrument is the trombone. She is the first female wind instrument player to play regularly in New Orleans's Preservation Hall. She also plays the bass drum, and she also works as a graphic designer and photographer. Early life Toivola grew up in Helsinki and attended the Lyc√©e franco-finlandais d'Helsinki, and graduated from its high school in 1994. After that she studied Romance philology and ethnomusicology at the University of Helsinki. She wrote her master's thesis on the ReBirth Brass Band of New Orleans and received a grant for a field trip from the Finnish Cultural Foundation in 2003. The title of the thesis was Feel Like Funkin‚Äô It Up ‚Äî A Study on the New Orleans Jazz Band called ReBirth Brass Band. Toivola graduated from the university in 2005. Toivola played the piano from the age four on, but she never was excited about that instrument or the material she had to play. ‚ÄúTo the disappointment of my teacher, I could never get excited about the theory behind the piano playing, but the music itself had the effect on me that with guts I learned the pieces by heart, slowly but surely.‚Äù Toivola discovered jazz in the early 1990s, when he mother took her to a jazz festival. After this, she would listen to jazz music, but she did not play it. For some time she had an alto saxophone, but she was not destined to play it for long: Career as a musician Even at a young age, Toivola knew some musicians and was able to join a band in Helsinki. Then she met some musicians from New Orleans, visiting Helsinki, and they encouraged her to visit their city. When she got there, she went around with her trombone and was given a chance to jam and to get to know the music circles there. Toivola visited New Orleans for the first time in 1995, and she has lived there since 2004. She found her husband, trumpet player Leroy Jones there, and they have been a couple since 1997 and married since 2016. In the early days Toivola and Jones experienced a setback, when hurricane Katrina hit the city. The damage that ensued was caused not so much by the hurricane itself but by the fact that the levees built to protect the city failed one after another. Water rose in the flat Toivola and Jones had rented to about four feet, which meant that almost all of their possessions were destroyed. However, the place was cleaned up, and the things that were ruined were thrown away. Luckily the music scene quickly picked up, and they started to get invitation to play gigs. Musicians were the first people to return to the city after the hurricane. Toivola later appeared in the American television drama series Treme, during its second season in episode eight, entitled Can I Change My Mind? Nowadays one of Toivola's routines is to play a Friday night gig at the Preservation Hall in her husband's band. She visits Finland a couple of times a year, and then she plays in the bands Spirit of New Orleans (SONO) and New Orleans Helsinki Connection. SONO has also played abroad, e.g. in Fiji and New Zealand, as well as in the most important jazz festivals in Europe and Scandinavia. They have also released three albums. New Orleans Helsinki Connection has played twice on New Orleans's JazzFest.

It is the 15th overall episode of the series and is written by Denise Th√© and directed by David Von Ancken. It aired on CBS in the United States and on CTV in Canada on February 16, 2012. The title refers to the \\"Blue wall of silence\\", a term to denote the unwritten rule that purportedly exists among police officers not to report on a colleague's errors, misconducts, or crimes, including police brutality. Plot =Flashbacks= In 2008, Reese (Jim Caviezel) and Stanton (Annie Parisse) are working on an undercover operation when they are joined by Mark Snow (Michael Kelly). Snow advises them to take care of a prisoner who was convicted of selling secrets to the Chinese government and kill him if the situation worsens. Later, Reese goes to a bar where he meets Peter Arndt (Jonno Roberts), Jessica's fianc√© but he remains unknown to him. While Peter leaves, he is joined by Stanton, who proclaims that Peter will take good care of Jessica. She convinces her to let it go and they leave just as Peter brings Jessica (Susan Misner) to meet them. =Present day= Reese is notified by Finch (Michael Emerson) of their newest number: Michael Cahill (Michael Aronov), a paramedical officer who is respected by a lot of people and seems to live a quiet life. Finch identifies that Cahill is a smuggler who works for a man named Vargas (Jos√© Z√∫√±iga). Reese joins as a driver for the ambulance and they are nearly caught by a police officer until Cahill brushes him off. Reese follows Cahill to a house he supposes it's breaking in, but is in fact living with his wife and son. He and Finch deduce that Cahill is infiltrating the gang in an attempt to take them down, works for a person only known as \\"L.O.S.\\", and that Cahill's real name is Daniel Tulley, a former NYPD officer. Cahill meets with Detective Byrne (Skipp Sudduth), his boss and gets him to meet with L.O.S. in their next pickup and tells him that Vargas has an inside man in HR. Finch gets Carter (Taraji P. Henson) to provide information on the workings of undercover cops. Later, the gang go to a Chinese restaurant to meet with L.O.S. but they are attacked by the Chinese, who injure Ajax (Robin Lord Taylor), one of the gang. They flee to a warehouse where they destroy their phones to lose contact with their handlers. Vargas suspects one of them is a mole and sets to find out who is. While Vargas is distracted, Cahill takes a hidden phone from Ajax and calls Byrne to tell him his location. Finch has Fusco (Kevin Chapman) infiltrate the IA file room to dispose of Cahill's file but is caught by officer Ian Davidson (Reg E. Cathey) and put under arrest. Davidson then informs Vargas about the call, revealing himself to be his inside man. Intending to save Cahill, Reese takes the phone from him and takes responsibility and is tortured by Vargas before being confronted by Cahill. Convincing him to trust him, Cahill makes it appear that he killed Reese. Then, the gang takes Reese and Ajax's corpse to a car and burn it down to dispose of the evidence. Thanks to Cahill slipping a flashlight, Reese escapes from the trunk before he gets killed and rendezvous with Carter. They are also informed of Fusco's state and hurry to a meeting between HR and Vargas's gang. Cahill holds L.O.S. (Michael Berresse) at gunpoint until Carter and Reese arrive and a shootout ensues. Cahill tries to arrest L.O.S. but Reese explains that he is from the CIA, remaining untouchable. Despite knowing this, Cahill arrests L.O.S. Davidson takes Fusco to the woods, intending to execute him. However, Davidson is killed by Reese, who destroys the evidence that he was connected with Vargas as he needs Fusco to enter HR. Later, Finch tells Reese that Snow had L.O.S. released from jail. When L.O.S. is released, he is put in a van and presumably killed. Fusco contacts with a friend, Officer Patrick Simmons (Robert John Burke) to dispose of Davidson's body, officially becoming part of HR. Reception =Viewers= In its original American broadcast, \\"Blue Code\\" was seen by an estimated 13.16 million household viewers and gained a 2.8/7 ratings share among adults aged 18‚Äì49, according to Nielsen Media Research. This was a 14% decrease in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 15.14 million viewers with a 3.3/8 in the 18-49 demographics. With these ratings, Person of Interest was the third most watched show on CBS for the night beating The Mentalist, but behind !Rob!, The Big Bang Theory, second on its timeslot and fifth for the night in the 18-49 demographics, behind Grey's Anatomy, !Rob!, The Big Bang Theory, and American Idol. =Critical reviews= \\"Blue Code\\" received generally positive reviews from critics. Keysha Couzens of TV Overmind wrote \\"An undercover cop is in danger as he tries to bring down the crew of smugglers he's been on the inside of on last night's Person of Interest.\\" Luke Gelineau of TV Equals wrote \\"I really had problems with the end of the episode. Finding out that the mysterious 'LOS' was actually working for the CIA just came completely out of left field. He's buying drugs to fund the war on terror? Uh...ok. Why couldn't it just be a drug lord? Instead we have this undercover cop going home feeling like crap for wasting his time chasing down a CIA agent? Lame.\\" Sean McKenna of TV Fanatic gave the episode a 4.5 star rating out of 5 and wrote \\"And while the flashbacks did illustrate Reese's longing for his loved one and difficulties in completely giving himself to his job, they and subsequent flashbacks haven't been as interesting as the present focus. Still, unraveling the mystery of the characters in small doses gives the series more than just the procedural aspects. Once again, Person of Interest delivers and it looks like the show is only going to get better.\\"  References  External links * \\"Blue Code\\" at CBS \\"Blue Code\\" at TV Guide * Person of Interest (TV series) episodes 2012 American television episodes ","title":"Blue Code (Person of Interest)"},{"id":"55890976","text":"James Paul Lister (born 6 April 1976) is an Australian politician.

Plot The action takes place in 18th century Venice. Rascal Truffaldino, who fled to wealthy Venice from poor Bergamo, gets employed as a servant to one signor by the name of Federico Rasponi, who in fact is a disguised girl Beatrice, Federico's sister. She, under the guise of her late brother, tries to find her lover, Florindo Aretusi, who was mistakenly accused of killing Federico in a duel and therefore fled to Venice. The disguised Beatrice comes to the house of the Venetian merchant Pantalone, where everyone is sure that Signor Posoni has died. This is what is explained to poor Truffaldino, who by tradition went up into the house first to announce the owner's visit. After this visit, while the new owner was engrossed with business, Truffaldino served another signor and also got employed by him as a servant. However, after this, the first owner who has settled in the same hotel, Brighella returns, and Truffaldino decides to serve both to receive double salaries. The second owner is the same Florindo. For some time, more due to his luck than resourcefulness, Truffaldino successfully serves both masters, getting into comic situations and coming out of them with agility. Beatrice (under the name Federico) has to pretend that she insists on a wedding with Clarice, the daughter of the old Pantalone, betrothed to the late Federico. But the latter loves Silvio, the son of Dr. Lombardi, whose arrival deprives the self-styled bridegroom's hopes of Clarice's hand. In the end, everything ends well: Beatrice reunites with Florindo, Clarice marries Silvio, and Truffaldino finds a wife - Smeraldin, a servant in the house of Pantalone.

It is the 16th overall episode of the series and is written by Sean Hennen and directed by Jeff T. Thomas. It aired on CBS in the United States and on CTV in Canada on February 23, 2012. Plot Finch (Michael Emerson) prepares Reese (Jim Caviezel) for their next number: Adam Saunders (Matt Lauria), a prop trader in the investment firm, Baylor Zimm. Reese poses as John Rooney, an asset manager. He finds that Adam has short sold on Robert Keller's case. Finch breaks into Adam's house and finds documents regarding his mother's death. Reese and Adam go to a bar where Adam pays the bill for every worker. He is then confronted by a man named Victor and they end up fighting until Reese calls them off. Later, Reese discovers that Adam is involved in a relationship with Sydney Baylor (Noelle Beck), who is also his boss. Adam had advised his adopted uncle to invest big in a firm call Tritak, that he now suspects has some serious problems. Raising an alarm puts his life in danger. It turns out a co-worker of Adam's and the SEC guy who is harassing him, together are using Tritak's imminent failure to defraud thousands of people out of tens of millions of dollars, as they sell it short. Reese is able to protect Adam from assassins sent to kill him before he leaks the news too early, while Finch uses his unlimited funds to keep Tritak in operation, save the investors' money, and expose the villains.

Founded in April 1962 at the premises of the Royal College of Surgeons of England in London, it was inspired by a similar learned society in the United States, the Verhoeff-Zimmerman Society, founded in 1945 and at that time called \\"The American Ophthalmic Pathology Club\\". In the early 1960s, ophthalmic pathology in Europe was not yet recognized as a distinct discipline and its practitioners had rarely had a formal training in the subject. Invitations to an inaugural meeting to be held in London were sent by Norman Ashton of London, S. Ry Andersen of Copenhagen, and Willem Manschot of Rotterdam to about 30 prospective members in May, 1961, together with details of what would be expected of them: * The members should have a special knowledge of ocular pathology. * They should be actively engaged in this work. * They should have adequate laboratory facilities. * They should have sufficient pathological material to provide interesting cases for the meetings. The society is governed by its Council, which is chaired by the Society's President, according to a constitution and bye-laws. The members of the Council and the President are elected from and by the Ordinary Members, the basic members of the society, who are themselves elected by existing Ordinary Members and are limited to 35 in number. The Council is elected for three years and consists of the President, the Corresponding Secretary and the Organizing Secretary, the latter being responsible for organizing the next scientific meeting.

In addition, it encourages research, teaching and improvement of technical methods in ophthalmic pathology through scientific meetings. The society organizes an Annual Meeting typically held in a city where one of its Ordinary Members is located, and branded symposia on ophthalmic pathology in collaboration with general ophthalmological congresses held in Europe and elsewhere.

Cresswell's An Introduction to Modal Logic and published two anthologies in 1974 and 1979 aimed to spread the knowledge of two areas of the intensional logic unknown in Italy: tense logic and conditional logic. In a number of academic papers, he developed a variant of so-called connexive logic named \\"logic of consequential implication\\", which turns out to be translatable in the main system of propositional modal logic and so decidable via the tableaux method. Books Google Pizzi is also known for his contributions to modal logic concerning the problem of defining necessity in terms of contingency and the use of Aristotelian squares and cubes in visualizing the relations between modal notions. In collaboration with Brazilian logicians, Pizzi has explored the subject of multimodal logics (i.e. of logics whose language has more than one modal primitive), about which he produced a monograph. His work in the field of epistemology has been mainly concerned with the counterfactual theory a causation, to which he devoted a book (1997) and a wide number of papers. He also published a book which is a collection of essays about abduction and the logic of legal proof (2009).

It was found that the bedrock at the entrance was cut by cart ruts. To the right of the entrance there were two areas of broken stone, perhaps indicating hearths, and a possible quern-stone. Near the centre of the interior, foundations of a building were discovered, thought at the time to be medieval, but more recently thought to be the remains of a Romano-Celtic temple. In 1999 and 2000 there were geophysical and topographical surveys.

The precise limits of the genus are uncertain. When broadly circumscribed to include Dendrostellera and Stelleropsis, it consists of annual and perennial herbaceous plants and small shrubs, with reddish, white or green flowers lacking petals, and is found in central and south-west Asia and south-east Europe. Description When broadly circumscribed (i.e. including Dendrostellera and Stelleropsis), Diarthron is a genus of annual or perennial herbaceous plants or short deciduous shrubs. Prior to a review in 1982, only the annual species were placed in Diarthron, with the perennial herbs being in Stelleropsis and the shrubs in Dendrostellera. The flowers lack petals. There are usually four (sometimes five) sepals, united at the base into a tube with lobes at the end, reddish, white or green in colour. The ovary has a single chamber (locule). The fruit is dry with the seed enclosed in a thin glossy black pericarp. Taxonomy The genus Diarthron was first described in 1832 by Nikolai Turczaninow for the species Diarthron linifolium. Many species were added to the genus in 1982 by Kit Tan, being transferred from related genera. A 2006 study suggested that as circumscribed, Diarthron is not monophyletic, so that Dendrostellera and Stelleropsis which Tan had merged into Diarthron should be reinstated. Studies in 2002 and 2009, based on chloroplast DNA, placed Diarthron in a small group of related genera, sister to a clade consisting of Thymelaea and Daphne; however for most genera only one species was included. =Species= The Plant List (version 1.1, September 2013) recognizes the following species: *Diarthron altaica (Thi√©b.-Bern.)

Completed in as a residence for Captain William Cox and family, the house was completed in the Old Colonial Greek Revival style with its design attributed to either Mortimer Lewis, John Verge or Francis Clarke. The property is privately owned. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. Set on , Fernhill was built as a much grander residence with associated gardens following Cox's earlier construction of The Cottage, that dated from . Following Cox's death in 1837, Fernhill was completed under the supervision of one of his sons, Edward.  History  =Aboriginal land= The traditional owners of the land now occupied by Cox's Cottage were the Mulgowie people, who became known as the \\"Mulgoa tribe\\".Karskens, 2009, 9 There is a reference to an attack on the Cox property by Aboriginal people in 1814.Sydney Gazette, May 1814. =Colonisation= The Mulgoa valley has played an important part in the history of the development of New South Wales. From 1810 Mulgoa was a key area of settlement in the colony.Anderson, 2008 The first land grant was made by Governor Macquarie to Lieutenant William Cox, a colonial magistrate who promptly registered the property in the parish records in the name of his infant son, Edward. Cox's Cottage is part of early colonial land grants and purchases to members of the Cox family in the Mulgoa Valley, south of Penrith, eventually totalling some .Kinhill Stearns, 1983; Bertie 1930, p51 The first of the grants, of , made in 1809 to the infant Edward Cox and confirmed by Governor Macquarie the following year,Watson, 1917 became known as Fernhills or Fernhill. Fernhill estate is located principally on the first land grant made in the Mulgoa Valley (to the infant Edward Cox) dating back to 1809. The name Fern Hills seems to have been given it as early as 1810.Stapleton, for Dept. of Planning, 1983 Lieutenant William Cox is perhaps best known for supervising the construction of the first road over the Blue Mountains in the second half of 1814.Betteridge, 2009 He sailed to New South Wales on the Minerva in 1799. During his 37 years of residence in the early colony, he made a substantial and enduring contribution to its progress in the fields of public administration, building and agricultural development. The Cox family were remarkable \\"house and garden\\" people. During the middle years of the 19th century, William Cox Sr. was at Clarendon, near Windsor; his eldest son William, lived at Hobartville, Richmond; his sons Henry, George and Edward were to build and occupy their respective houses of Glenmore, Winbourne and Fernhill at Mulgoa. Another son, James, settled in Van Dieman's Land, where he built his own magnificent Clarendon. Around all these houses the Cox families created beautiful gardens.Chippindall/Broadbent, 1979, 2 For some time the property of was managed jointly with that of William Cox by the overseer James King with occasional help from Cox's sons, George, Henry and Edward. Edward Cox (1805‚Äì68) returned from schooling in England (since 1821) and established his separate estate at Fernhill. In 1827 he married Jane Maria Brooks (of Denham Court estate, Ingleburn) and the family lived at The Cottage, Mulgoa (to the east) for many years. By the late 1830s Fernhill was one of the principal estates in the Mulgoa Valley and included The Cottage site to the east. At this time it was one of five properties that had expanded to occupy virtually the entire Mulgoa Valley. In 1842 Edward Cox began building the sandstone house. It was planned on a large and sophisticated scale and in the Greek Revival style, possibly by colonial architect Mortimer Lewis. The house was completed in 1843 and Edward and Jane Cox moved in then. Above the door is a date of 1842.Stapleton, 1983 The architect of Fernhill is not known with any certainty. The house bears features suggestive of the work of Mortimer Lewis and John Verge. The less-well known architect, Francis Clarke, was working in the area at the time of Fernhill's construction and the house may have been designed by him.Report to Heritage Council, 1978 Lewis' private commissions show a dependence on published sources, identified in recent year by architectural historian James Broadbent. Fernhill and Tomago boast separate entrance and garden fronts at right angles to each other, the garden fronts marked by bay windows. Their plans are probably adapted from the British architect William Wilkins' design for \\"Oxberton House\\", Nottinghamshire, as published by George Richardson in the New Vitruvius Britannicus (1802-8).Carlin, 2012 Elements of the house suggesting the involvement of Mortimer Lewis are: narrow \\"slit\\" side light windows flanking the front door; internal skirting boards with \\"window-panelling\\" insets; papier mache ceiling friezes and roses (from Bealerfeld & Co. in London)(much used in the 1840s, e.g. by Surveyor-General Sir Thomas Mitchell at Parkhall in Douglas Park; who influenced Lewis; and at Government House, Sydney (which Lewis supervised construction of) (NB: these were later removed and the ceilings stencilled); the \\"Gothic\\" black marble fireplace in the major room; the niches and arched vault openings in and off the entrance lobby (as at Garry Owen house in Lilyfield, by Lewis).Griffin, 2013 The house appears to have been designed as a two storey building. The recession of the 1840s is said to be the reason for its unfinished (one storey) state. Twenty Irish stone masons were brought out to Australia under the bounty system of immigration for the specific purpose of building the Fernhill house, using sandstone quarried from the local hills. Edward Cox and his family lived in the house from 1843 until his death in 1868, when the property passed to his eldest son, Edward King Cox. The surviving stable at the rear (west) is said to be built in 1839 and is certainly of the same period as the house. In the early 1850s the estate was singled out by Governor FitzRoy's aide-de-camp, Col. Godfrey Mundy, for the way in which its landscape had been moulded by thinning the native species. Other ket developments include: *It was described as \\"a modern mansion situated on rising ground with well kept shrubberies, lawns and a well kept ... vineyard\\". *Following Edward Cox's death in 1863the property passed to his eldest son, Edward King Cox (1829-1883) of Rawden, Mudgee, who until 1885 carried out at The Cottage, Mulgoa, a noted racehorse stud producing several Melbourne Cup winners.Stapleton,1983 E. K. Cox was a breeder of fine race horses and Fernhill Stud produced the first Sydney Cup winner and several Melbourne Cup winners. *Following E. K. Cox's death in 1883 the estate seems to have been divided. *In 1888Standish Cox sold the house and surrounding land to Mr Wright of Wright Heaton. For some years possibly due to the recession of the 1890s the house is said to have been uninhabited. *By 1911the property was owned by R. B. Baynes, Mayor of Mulgoa. *About 1931the house and 1000 acres was bought by Mr & Mrs Moyse who ran it as a guest house. At that time the building had a galvanised iron roof and a large stone reservoir holding 45,000 gallons. *Mr John Darling bought the estate. Darling was a World War II fighter pilot, a banker, director of resource companies, accomplished international agri-business pioneer and Australian film industry visionary. After World War II Darling married Susie Yencken and they settled at Vaucluse. Weekends were often spent at Fernhill, Mulgoa, which Darling bought in 1956 and gradually restored.Lee, 2015 *Darling and garden designer Paul Sorensen reworked the garden around the house. *In 1980the house was sold with 1000 acres to the property developer, Warren Anderson for $2.8 million.Dawson, 7/1980, 91 * and earlierthe house was extensively restored and renovated by former owner Darling and then Anderson. The most notable addition has been the sandstone columns (ex the Union Club, Sydney) in the northern pergola. *December 2001-January 2002bushfires damaged the property down to Mulgoa Road, but had some benefits in killing some of the cypress hedging obscuring/blocking views.

The Tripps have been using the estate as a venue for functions, such as picnic race events on the racetrack, \\"Tough Mudder\\" endurance events, concerts and the like. Fernhill has reputedly been sold for redevelopment as a cemetery.Lucas, 2017, 2 Rookwood General Cemetery Trust confirmed in May 2017 that a sale has not yet occurred, but it has entered into a six-month exclusivity period which will allow the trust to conduct the required due diligence process, commencing with a period of community consultation, the trust's spokeswoman told the Penrith Press.Petrinic, 2017  Description  =Setting= Fernhill is in (on the western side of the middle of) the Mulgoa Valley, a picturesque rural landscape retaining a number of significant colonial and later 19th century farm estates, building complexes and areas of natural bushland. The valley is bounded to the west by the Nepean River and the Blue Mountains National Park, to the east it slopes down to Mulgoa Road and merges with the undulating slopes of Western Sydney. It is characterised by predominantly rural landscape and comprises creek flats, gently sloping agricultural land, wooded hills and escarpment areas.Anderson, 2008, modified, Stuart Read, 30/7/08 =Landscape= Fernhill is a consciously created rural landscape in the English landscape tradition, formed by: * the process of elimination rather than planting; * the removal of natives regarded as unpicturesque; and * thinning to create a park like scene with clumps of rough-barked apples and Angophora trees left along the drive to the house. Beyond the avenue of trees the drive crosses the wall of a dammed watercourse. The road continues across two small decorative but massively constructed balustraded bridges and winds upwards below the now partially obscured garden front of the house. Significant elements are the hill setting of the house and original (southern) entrance drive including the drive, bridges, pond and estate landscaping in English landscape park style. The house, garden and modern works are not significant elements. Mundey's nineteenth century description of Fernhill's landscape being the finest piece of English park like scenery, but with Australian species, in New South Wales, is still arguably true.RNE, based on National Trust (Broadbent), 1981. =Driveway= The original entrance drive was designed to provide visitors with constantly changing glimpses of the house and its estate. Two damaged but still trafficable sandstone arch bridges on the drive exist. They were unnecessary in an engineering sense as the drive could have been constructed higher up the hill to avoid the shallow gullies which the bridges cross. They were an obvious attempt by the designer to increase the grandeur of the entrance. This contrived landscape is an integral part of the setting of the house and outbuildings. The drive is lined with avenue and specimens and clumps of rough-barked native apple or apple box/oak trees (Angophora intermedia, A.subvelutina, A.costata) contrived to offer occasional glimpses of Fernhill's house and St. Thomas' Church to the east, although the latter views are filtered by regenerating bush. The estate has many mature 19th century native trees, particularly Angophora trees or apple oaks. Recent () stone faced walls and rail fences detract seriously from the historic quality of the planting. The original drive went from the house to The (Cox's) Cottage (also once known as Fernhills/Fernhill) (east of the current Mulgoa Road alignment, facing the old Mulgoa Road (now renamed St.Thomas' Road). The southern of two existing drives goes to the house from Mulgoa Road through (/80) dry stone walls at the gates. The northern drive /80 is planted with an avenue of bloodwoods (Corymbia sp.) and runs in a relatively straight line up hill, compared to original (southern) driveway, with its carefully contrived bends to reveal views and hide them.Stapleton, I, 1983 and Stuart Read, pers.comm., 2002 The northern of the two existing drives passes an orchard plantation area of pecan (Carya illinoiensis) trees and a large rock-faced stable structure to the north. It winds up hill past a large dam to its north and around another smaller dam/large pond to its south but still north of the house, approaching the house by a sloping driveway north- west of both the main house and a second, later house in sandstone with a verandah around it, set on a lower terrace. The drive also passes numerous outbuildings and yards to the west of the house on approach.Stuart Read, pers.comm., 2002, 2009 =Dam on the northern drive= A large dam was formed by the drive crossing Littlefields Creek. Reportedly timber piling was removed in works and lined with (quite dramatic and tall) stone walling which has changed its character.pers.comm Mr F Gardiner, Manager The dam was probably original to the drive - it is shown on plan. It is a similar construction to the dam at The (Cox's) Cottage, Mulgoa to the east. =Stone bridges on southern / original drive= Includes two stone bridges and a dam - all shown on plan. Both are very fine ashlar sandstone bridges with buttresses, piers and capped parapets. Architectural design. Both were in poor order (1981) with their downhill sides collapsing. These were presumably built before the house as second storey of house did not eventuate. =Garden= North of the main house and between it and the newer second house on a lower terrace to the north (built by Warren Anderson) are a grove of pecan (Carrya illinoiensis) trees, a boundary planting of olives (Olea europaea cv.).Stuart Read, pers.comm., 11/11/09 Around the original house is a garden dating from the 1840s, much of it re-designed/planted) by garden designer Paul Sorensen around . The garden's early configuration is now obscured (1981 and 2002 observations), but critical elements of early planting survive as setting for the historic house. Old and substantial exotic or non-locally native trees including Bunya pines (Araucaria bidwillii), stone pines (Pinus pinea), and Chinese elms (Ulmus parvifolia) remainStapleton, 1983; confirmed Stuart Read, 19/7/2013). Other exotic trees of note include coral trees (Erythrina sp.), pistachios (Pistacia sp.), olives (Olea europaea cv.).Stuart Read, pers.comm., 11/11/2009 The Sorensen garden redesign includes terracing to the house's south with a swimming pool on the lower terrace, a long pergola edging a lawn to the house's north edged with trees (including olives and cypresses. A lawn to the east slopes to a large oval pond on the far (east) side of which runs one drive to the house. In 1969 owner John Darling hired garden designer Paul Sorensen to construct a garden around the house. At that time photographs showed little \\"development\\" around the house apart from the carriage loop and dramatic views. Darling and Sorensen were both keen to provide a setting both sympathetic to the house and suitable for modern outdoor living. Planting then was limited to two jacaranda trees (Jacaranda mimosifolia), one bunya pine, a few smaller trees and a row of struggling Nile/ African lilies (Agapanthus praecox ssp. orientalis). The immediate land was littered with farm structures, tank stands, castor oil bushes and dead wattles. Cattle were roaming through parts of the house at the time. Sorensen and the Darlings created level lawns around the house by building retaining walls and lots of fill. This in turn required replanning the carriage loop, which was buried in the process of filling. This was replaced with a car court hidden below a retaining wall to the north-east of the house with an approach stair arriving at lawn level near a grove of Chinese elms at the end of an enormous pergola. In this pergola Sorensen (/Darling) reused old architectural elements, sandstone columns from the Union Club, Bligh Street, Sydney (demolished in the early 1960s to build the Wentworth Hotel). These were erected as supports for the heavy timber pergola over which white Wisteria sinensis \\"Alba\\" was planted. This pergola design was very refined, with the timber ends fashioned in a detail sympathetic to the Georgian architecture of the house. A wide bed of mixed plantings of perennials and shrubs, including camellias and azaleas, forms a backdrop to the pergola when viewed from the house, adding a floral display at this important arrival point to the house. A swimming pool was installed south of the house, sited so it cannot be seen from the house, even though it is on the central southern axis (bay). It was set at a lower level below a balustraded wall. While flowering shrubs were planted for further screening. A pool house was set below the adjoining upper terrace and is invisible from other parts of the garden. Hedges were planted as an important garden feature. The rose garden is screened by tall hedges of star jasmine (Trachelospermum jasminoides) with the entrance being arched with yellow banksia rose (Rosa banksiae 'Lutea'). Star jasmine was also used to screen a new tennis court to the southwest. The garden was nowhere near complete when Darling sold Fernhill to Owston Nominees (Warren Anderson), who continued to use Sorensen's services. Later works included provision of an ornamental pool (the dam with island east of the house) and the transplanting of an ancient evergreen magnolia/bull bay (Magnolia grandiflora) from Sydney into the garden. Much recent (1981) planting and the introduction of unsympathetic landscape elements (walls, gazebo on island in recent dam east of house), etc obscure the significance of the setting and obstruct original panoramic views from the house.Stapleton, I., for Dept. of Planning 1983(extensive planting of cypress hedges further block views out/in particularly to/from the north - these were damaged in the 2001/2 summer bushfires.Stuart Read, pers. comm., 2002 Shrubs in the garden include a pomegranate (Punica granatum) west of the house, and an area of formal roses on a terrace below and north-west of the house. =House= Fernhill is a single storey ashlar sandstone house. There is a central semi-circular bay on the south-eastern elevation, with a stone flagged verandah, curved timber rafters and the roof of which is supported by stone Doric columns. The extensive cellar features a stone cantilevered stairway. The windows and the entrance on the north-eastern elevation suggest that a verandah along that side of the house was planned but never built. Interior ceilings are lofty as the house was originally designed for two- storeys. Window sills are hewn from the wall of masonry, rather than being separate blocks of stone. The stone-flagged entrance hall has flattened corners containing round-headed niches which flank the opening into the central hall. Very fine cedar joinery and papier mache ceiling ornamentation. Also very fine Italian style chimney pieces. All of the living rooms feature elegant architraves. Interior ceilings are lofty as house was originally designed for two storeys. Roof is of corrugated iron. Elements of the house suggesting the involvement of Mortimer Lewis are: narrow \\"slit\\" side light windows flanking the front door; internal skirting boards with \\"window- panelling\\" insets; papier mache ceiling friezes and roses (from Bealerfeld & Co. in London)(much used in the 1840s, e.g. by Surveyor-General Sir Thomas Mitchell at Parkhall in Douglas Park; who influenced Lewis; and at Government House, Sydney (which Lewis supervised construction of) (NB: these were later removed and the ceilings stencilled); the \\"Gothic\\" black marble fireplace in the major room; the niches and arched vault openings in and off the entrance lobby (as at Garry Owen house in Lilyfield, by Lewis). =Wings / Officers' courtyard / Two stone garden walls= Off the western side of house, joined to its two wings (these are remnants of original officers' courtyard of house) are two stone garden walls - both bent i.e.: cornered - one at right angles. Coursed colonial rubble walls of bush stone. Shaped coping of smaller stones, includes gateway to stable (west of house). =Stables and coach house= A sandstone building from is located behind (west of) the main house. A drive runs between it and the house, accessed by a flight of stone steps and terraced lawn and garden areas. The building is thought to be a stable and coach house, with fine face sandstone construction, mostly original openings, coach house door original, roof and all other joinery and finishes are . Facing it across the drive are lemons (Citrus limon) espaliered against wide trellis mounted on walls, likely to have been put in by Sorensen.Stuart Read, visit, 19/7/2013 =Stone box drain= Substantial drain with dished bottom and stone sides and top running from back (west) of house under south end of old stable.

The property retains most of its rural landscape character including a strong historical and visual relationship with the Cox family's earlier house Mulgoa Cottage and church, St. Thomas' Church of England. The three buildings were originally linked by tree-lined drives, the remains of which bear evidence of an attempt by Cox to create an English-style rural landscape in an Australian setting. The native trees of the area include Angophora subvelutina, a species which approximates the English Oak in size and habit. = Condition = Despite modifications, the overall physical condition is good.

Heritage listing  The Fernhill estate comprises an extensive area of modified and natural landscape which provides the setting for a house completed c.1845 for Edward Cox. The estate is primarily significant for its landscape which is a rare Australian example of the English landscape school's practice of modifying the natural landscape to create a romanticised natural appearance embellished by a richness of cultural features: for the house which is a fine example of Greek Revival architecture, exceptionally well crafted; and the setting of the estate within the Mulgoa Valley with its modified landscape distinguished by historic colonial era homesteads and the Anglican Church (St. Thomas', Mulgoa). The estate also demonstrates a unique phase in Australia's history with the rise of the landed pastoral estates, in this instance developed by Edward Cox and his son Edward King Cox (Paul Davies, 2005). The importance of Fernhill as a group of related sites (along with St. Thomas' Church, Mulgoa, and the Cottage, Mulgoa) is twofold: the landscape is exceptionally significant in its own right irrespective of the buildings, and is as important as the architectural, historic and visual relationships of the buildings themselves. This group of three sites retain their original visual relationship to each other and demonstrating the ambitions and changes in wealth and status of an important early colonial family (the Coxes) from 1810-1880s. The landscape between the Cottage, the Church and Fernhill has remained virtually unaltered since the 1850s. This landscape is a unique piece of evidence of a very rare attitude in the mid-nineteenth century towards the natural environment. Fernhill's landscape extends generally from Mulgoa Creek in the east to beyond the ridge of bush behind Fernhill house in the west, from Littlefields Creek in the south to Mayfields Road in the north. Fernhill setting is an extensive area of modified landscape providing a picturesque approach to the historic Homestead. The landscape is significant for the high degree of creative design achievement, attributed to the original owner, Edward Cox. It is historically significant for the following reasons: * the landscape is a rare Australian example of the English landscape school's design technique which modified existing landscapes to create a romanticised natural appearance; * the landscape demonstrates a cultural phase in Australia when landscape design was influenced by the teaching of Thomas Shepherd who advocated the adaptation of the English design technique. The landscape contains a richness of cultural features such as: * long vistas to the Homestead; * vistas to St. Thomas' (the family) Church spire from the Homestead; * use of water as a foreground for vistas and views; * ornamental bridges to articulate enframed views; and clumps of trees carefully created by thinning of native bushland (RNE) Fernhill is possibly the only intact early colonial garden laid out on the principles of the English Landscape Garden (a landscape \\"Park\\" in the picturesque manner) but relying entirely on indigenous plant material and the process of elimination (thinning and tree removal) rather than planting (Broadbent, J., for the National Trust of Australia (NSW) 1981). While unfortunately somewhat altered in character and detail, Fernhill's remnant exotic trees of the 19th century garden (Bunyas, stone pines, Chinese elms) around the house and the remnant garden layout are a carefully contrived culmination of the more important landscape drive. Fernhill was probably one of the last buildings completed in the Colonial period of New South Wales architecture. It was the home of Edward Cox, son of William Cox, and as such is intimately linked with much of the early rural development of the colony. Fernhill property retains most of its rural landscape character, including a visual relationship with the Cox family's earlier house Mulgoa Cottage and church, St Thomas' Church of England.Report to Heritage Council 1978 Fernhill was constructed of stone quarried on the site and was probably one of the last buildings to be completed in the noble colonial period. It was at this time that the Greek and Romantic Revival period commenced in which the buildings were constructed of imported materials. (RNE). Believed to be possibly the finest extant Greek Revival temple house in New South WalesFox & Associates 1987: MV-4 The fact that the house was not completed (it is single storey, and was apparently to be two storied) makes it physical evidence of the depression of the 1840s. Perhaps most significant is its siting. In the truly picturesque sense, it is sited like a Greek temple, on an acropolis of a site, to command the country for miles around. It is also significant as the home of a prominent settler, Edward Cox. Fernhill (Sydney) was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Fernhill was probably one of the last buildings completed in the Colonial period of New South Wales architecture. It was the home of Edward Cox, son of William Cox, and as such is intimately linked with much of the early rural development of the colony.

Amidst significant community opposition, the NSW Government declined planning approval for a cemetery on Fernhill. In early 2018 the estate was bought by the NSW Office of Strategic Lands of the NSW government. Popular culture The finale of season three of The Bachelor was filmed at Fernhill.

Career  Born in the 9th arrondissement of Paris, the daughter of a physician, Yvonne Gouvern√© moved to a career as a pianist after studying at the Schola Cantorum de Paris. In 1918, following a decisive meeting with Andr√© Caplet, she turned to the profession of accompanist and singer. With Caplet, at the Concerts Pasdeloup, they premiered in concert Le Martyre de saint S√©bastien by Claude Debussy in November 1922 and Miroir de J√©susMiroir de J√©sus on Musicalics by Caplet with Claire Croiza as the soloist in June 1923. After Andr√© Caplet's death in 1925, she decided to dedicate herself to making her master's works known and continued her career at the Walther Straram concerts between 1925 and 1933. Among so many others, she participated in the premiere of ≈ídipus Rex by Igor Stravinsky (1928) and Judith,Judith on Data.bnf.fr oratorio by Arthur Honegger in 1928. In 1929/30, again with Walther Straram, at the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es, she hosted innovative radio programs called \\"Vulgarisation musicale\\". Still in 1930, she joined Roger D√©sormi√®re at the Soci√©t√© de musique d'autrefois (SMA),Soci√©t√© de musique d'autrefoisArchives of the Soci√©t√© de musique d'autrefois first foray into early music, which we call today Baroque (D√©sormi√®re and Yvonne Gouvern√© had already collaborated in a concert of homage to Caplet in 1927), the SMA which she met again after 1956. Again with Desormi√®re, it was the foundation of the Orchestre symphonique de Paris with the premiere of Igor Markevitch's Cantata on 4 June 1930. In 1934, after the death of Walther Straram, Gouvern√© founded a vocal ensemble soon to be associated with the \\"Triton concerts\\" by Pierre-Octave Ferroud, Henry Barraud, Jean Rivier and Emmanuel Bondeville, which led to the first a cappella choir auditions by Florent Schmitt, Francis Poulenc, Roland-Manuel and the performing of Les noces by Stravinsky conducted by Charles Munch. Beginning in 1935, Munch, both at the Philharmonic Orchestra and the Orchestre de la Soci√©t√© des Concerts du Conservatoire, will always call on Gouvern√© for the choirs. It was the time of the first exceptional concerts: the Requiem by Berlioz in the courtyard of honour of the Invalides on 16 June 1938 with Munch, the Requiem by Verdi the same year with Bruno Walter, Salle Pleyel. Thanks to Bondeville, the choir also entered the station, which led her to meet again Desormi√®re at the newly created (1934) Orchestre national de France by D√©sir√©-√âmile Inghelbrecht. She worked with the National Orchestra until the early 1960s.Last identified concert on 30 January 1963, Video of Le coeur et la main by Charles Lecocq During the war, after the retreat to Rennes, she was first charged with broadcasts to the United States and then returned to Paris in September 1940. During all the Occupation, she will continue to work with D√©sormi√®re (especially on the famous recording of Pell√©as et M√©lisande) and with Munch.

Still in 1942, Emmanuel Bondeville, music director of the radio station, instructed Gouvern√© to gradually take over the French radio broadcasts in Paris..Historique du ch≈ìur de Radio-France on choeurdelaradio.org. At the Liberation of France, Henry Barraud, appointed musical director of the Radiodiffusion fran√ßaise, assigned her the task of taking over the entire choir formation, dispersed and dismembered by four years of occupation. Hence in 1946, the foundation of the Ma√Ætrise de Radio France and in 1947 the rapprochement of the Symphonic Choir and the Lyric Choir.: The Choir (Yvonne Gouvern√©) often worked with the orchestra of French radio. She rehearsed in Paris, then Rennes and Marseille before returning to the capital in 1942. The ensemble took the name of Ch≈ìur lyrique in 1945 and merged with the F√©lix Raugel Choir in 1947 to form the Ch≈ìur de la Radiodiffusion fran√ßaise. Premieres also followed one another, the Trois petites liturgies de la pr√©sence divine by Olivier Messiaen at the Les Concerts de la Pl√©iade (1943‚Äì1947) on La-Pleiade.fr (accessdate 26 November 2017) and on disks in 1945 and the Requiem by Maurice Durufl√© in 1946, with the Orchestre national de France, with H√©l√®ne Bouvier and Camille Maurane as soloists, both conducted by Roger D√©sormi√®re. Still with the National, on 17 February 1947, it was Eug√®ne Bigot who conducted the premiere of the Ode au peupleOde au peuple on data.bnf.fr for choir and orchestra by Louis Saguer. On 8 May 47 took place the premiere of Myst√®re des saints innocentsMyst√®re des saints innocents on Gallica by Henry Barraud by Manuel Rosenthal and that of Naissance du verbe by Giacinto Scelsi again with D√©sormi√®re on 28 November 1949. Gouvern√© also worked for the cinema, such as for example for le R√™veLe R√™ve on IMDb after √âmile Zola by Jacques de Baroncelli, Golgotha (music by Jacques Ibert) by Julien Duvivier, la Vie parisienne (Offenbach) by Robert Siodmak, The Citadel of Silence (Darius Milhaud) by Marcel L'Herbier, Port of Shadows (Maurice Jaubert) by Marcel Carn√©, V√©ronique,V√©ronique on IMDb etc.; for the theatre, at the Th√©√¢tre Fran√ßais, Athalie by Jean Racine (music by Haendel, adaptation by Jacques Chailley).

Plot The film tells about the intelligentsia and the revolution in Russia, about the life of the family of Turbin officers during the Russian Civil War. Kiev. Winter of 1918-1919. The power in the city passes from the hetman to the Directorate of Ukraine, then from Petliura to the Bolsheviks. Turbins and their acquaintances have to make their choice. Colonel Alexei Turbin and his brother Nicholas remain loyal to the White Movement and bravely defend it, without worrying about their lives. Elena's (n√©e Turbin) husband, Vladimir Talberg flees shamefully from the city with the retreating German troops.

It is one of the sub-villages in the Keezhamanai village of this taluk. History Before 1739 Karaikal was under the regime and control of Raja Pratap Singh of Tanjore. In 1738, Dumas, a shrewd calculative prudent man and a lover of peace and above all one who was anxious to extend the French territory in India by smooth means, negotiated with Sahuji of Thanjavur for possession of Karaikal, the fortress of Karakalcheri and five village for 40,000 chakras. On 14 February 1739 the French took possession of Karaikal town, the fort of Karakalcheri and eight dependent villages. At this point, the King of Thanjavur raised the price for the town of Karaikal and the fort of Karakalcheri to 50,000 chakras. He also demanded a loan of 150,000 chakras without interest repayable in three years against the hypothecation of Mayavaram lands, and an annual rent of 4,000 pagodas for five villages. The French agreed to all the terms except for the payment of 150,000 chakras, which was then reduced to 10,000 chakras, while the annual rental was reduced to two or three thousand chakras. The villages so received were Kilaiyur, Melaiyur, Puduthurai, Kovilpathu and Tirumalairayanpattinam. Subsequently, two villages were ceded to the French. Pratap Singh, who succeeded the throne, renewed the demand for a loan of 100,000 chakras, and on receipt of the first instalment of 4,000 chakras he assigned eight more villages to the French viz., Codague (Kondagai), Vanjiyur, Arimullimangalam, Niravi, Dharmapuram, Uzhiapathu, Mattakudi (probably Mathalangudi) and Polagam. Then on 12 February 1740, he sold these villages for 60,000 chakras, which he had assigned only the previous year for 40,000 chakras.

It was established via a 1922 bond measure of to purchase the land originally owned by Charles B. Polhemus, and currently hosts a baseball field, tennis courts, sculptures, playground, Japanese tea garden, recreation center, miniature train, rose garden and the San Mateo Arboretum.  Features  =Recreation center= Central Park's recreation center is leased by Self-Help for the Elderly (SHE), offering activities for approximately 1,000 senior citizens between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. on weekdays. SHE primarily serves low-income and minority senior citizens. The Central Park location is the only SHE activity center in San Mateo County. The Central Recreation Center offers ceramics classes and a ceramics studio in the park in an auxiliary building adjoining the tennis courts. Closure of the recreation center was first proposed in 2003. The three proposed 2014 updates to the Central Park Master Plan would demolish the existing the recreation center; only one proposal calls for rebuilding the recreation center. Other informal proposals have been advanced to relocate SHE to either the yet-to-be-completed Bay Meadows Park or the existing city senior center on Alameda de las Pulgas, which would decrease access for seniors, who typically have limited options for private automobiles and public transit. =Fitzgerald Field (baseball)= One of the earliest features at Central Park is the baseball field in the western corner, laid out at the inception of Central Park in 1922. San Mateo's semiprofessional baseball team, the Blues, played at the field from 1924 to 1941, interrupted by World War II, and resumed play in 1948 until the team was disbanded in 1978. Prior to their move to Central Park, the Blues played as an amateur team starting in 1898 at what is now the Martin Luther King Center north of downtown. When they moved to Central Park in 1924, the Blues participated as a semiprofessional team in the California State League, winning several championships during the 1920s and 30s. Justin \\"Fitz\\" Fitzgerald managed the Blues between 1924 and 1935 after his major-league playing career ended. Light stands were added to the field in 1935, and the grandstand has a capacity of approximately 1,100 people. The field was dedicated for Fitzgerald on August 21, 1960, commemorated by a plaque on the grandstand's exterior wall. Reputedly, Barry Bonds would hit home runs from Fitzgerald Field across bordering El Camino Real while playing high school baseball for Serra. Some proposals in the 2014 Master Plan update included the removal of Fitzgerald Field, which was opposed by local little league officials. The San Mateo City Council showed strong support for retaining Fitzgerald Field in 2015. =Tennis courts= Central Park has six lighted tennis courts on the roof of a single-level garage parking structure (built 1963). In 2007, a proposal to demolish and replace the parking structure was advanced, as it was considered seismically unsafe, but the existing structure was reprieved in 2009 with a retrofit plan. The retrofitting contract was awarded in 2010. All three of the proposed 2014 updates to the Central Park Master Plan would remove the tennis courts in favor of plazas or open space to provide a more formal park entrance. The proposed updates address a criticism that the tennis courts (along with the Fitzgerald Field grandstand) form a barrier between downtown and the rest of Central Park. =Japanese Tea Garden= Toyonaka pagoda The Japanese Tea Garden was designed by Nagao Sakurai and was installed in 1966. Plants featured in the garden include cherry trees, Japanese maples and bonsai. San Mateo set up a sister-city relationship with Toyonaka in 1963, and Toyonaka has donated several sculptures which can be seen in the Tea Garden, including the five-level stone pagoda statue (installed 1963) and a small shinden shrine (in 1991, for the Tea Garden's 25th anniversary). In addition, the Japanese Tea Garden structures include the surrounding fence, a traditional gazebo (azumaya), and a teahouse (chashitsu). View of pond and bridges. It is open from 10AM to 4PM on weekdays and 11AM to 4PM on weekends. The Tea Garden water features include a waterfall and pond with two bridges; visitors may feed the pond's koi from the main bridge at 11AM and 3PM daily in the spring and summer. =Children's playground= The children's playground at Central Park features a wood-and-steel play structure along with steel climbing equipment in a large sandbox. A nearby miniature railway runs in a loop. Children's train The Bianchi miniature railway, named after its current owner, runs an Arrow Development locomotive on gauge track. The Arrow \`Streamliner‚Ä≤ locomotive was originally built in 1953 to replace an Ottaway steam locomotive, and was later converted to battery power. Rides are $2 each, and the operator of the train also occasionally opens the snack bar in the Fitzgerald Field grandstands. The miniature train is painted in the Southern Pacific \\"Daylight\\" livery, and has been running since May 10, 1948. It can accommodate 10 children. =San Mateo Arboretum= Within the main area of the park is a rose garden with gazebo, popular for photos and weddings, and nearby is a meeting space for the San Mateo Arboretum Society. The San Mateo Arboretum Society was founded in 1974, and undertook the restoration of the adjoining Kohl pumphouse, which now serves as its meeting place and headquarters, in 1976. The rose garden was planted and is maintained by Arboretum Society volunteers. =Sculptures and historic structures= Leon, the copper giraffe by Guibara (1978) Albert Guibara sculpted a life-size giraffe statue by brazing copper plates together, named Leon, in honor of his father's 80th birthday. It was installed in 1978 and can be seen on the park's northeast lawn, by the corner of 5th and Laurel (). The iron dog statue is popular with children An Italian cast-iron statue of a dog dates back to Kohl's ownership of the property and can be seen on the south side of the park, near the Arboretum and the 9th Avenue entrance. The wrought-iron fence fronting the park along El Camino Real also dates to Kohl's time. The Kohl pumphouse is the only building left from Kohl's ownership of the property. Regular events Since 1979, a five-game little league exhibition baseball series has been held between San Mateo and Toyonaka all-stars biennially. San Mateo and Toyonaka trade hosting duties, and the final game is held at Fitzgerald Field in the years that San Mateo hosts the series. On Thursday nights during the summer, Central Park hosts the Central Park Music Series, a series of free concerts featuring live music from Bay Area-based performers. 2014 featured eight concert dates, and 2015 is planned to have eight dates as well. The City of San Mateo holds the Eggstravaganza egg hunt and parade early each spring at Central Park. Other holidays and events are celebrated at the park, year round including: San Mateo Bacon & Brew Festival (October), Holiday Floral Art Show (December), San Mateo on Ice (Ice Skating Rink from November until January), and various San Mateo Arboretum Society events (all year round).  History  In 1854, Charles B. Polhemus, then the director of the San Francisco and San Jose Railroad, purchased the land which would later become Central Park; he built a mansion on the grounds in keeping with the fashion of wealthy San Franciscans to establish an estate on the Peninsula. Polhemus is credited with laying out the downtown core of San Mateo in September 1863 alongside the newly completed railroad. In 1880, William Kohl, founder of the Alaska Commercial Company, acquired Polhemus's estate and had it landscaped by John McLaren and William O'Farrell with trees and a long stone and iron fence along El Camino Real. Many of Kohl's trees have survived along with the fence and can be seen in present-day Central Park. The only other surviving structures built between 1890 and 1910 are the Kohl pumphouse and the pony shed. The 13-room Victorian mansion was later inherited by Kohl's son, C. Frederick, and Frederick Kohl lived there while building his own estate in Burlingame. Kohl's Burlingame estate and mansion, completed in 1914, have been the site of Mercy High School since 1931. The City of San Mateo acquired the first of land from C. Frederick Kohl's estate in 1922 via a bond measure of , establishing it as the first public park in San Mateo; the baseball field was one of the first amenities laid out. An additional were added in 1926. San Mateo Junior College occupied the former Kohl mansion on the park grounds near the northern corner of 5th and Laurel from 1923‚Äì1927. After the College moved to the former home of San Mateo High School on Baldwin Avenue, the mansion was demolished in 1928. Many of the park's current amenities, including the playground, recreation center, and tennis courts were installed while Stanley Pitcher was serving as Superintendent of Parks (1937‚Äì1969). =Master Plan update= The City of San Mateo unveiled three proposals in 2014 to update the Central Park Master Plan: * Recreation Center option: a new, expanded recreation center would be built on the site of the current tennis courts with additional underground parking, and the Fitzgerald Field grandstand would be downsized in favor of publicly-accessible art studios replacing those in the current recreation center. * Enhanced Open Space option: the current recreation center would be replaced with an open lawn and bandshell, and the tennis courts would be replaced with a large plaza atop expanded underground parking. * Community Gathering option: Fitzgerald Field would be removed and replaced with a large lawn and the current recreation center would be replaced with a pavilion. The changes to the Master Plan attracted negative publicity, mainly for the proposed removal of longstanding amenities.

Biography  Y≈´gure Maeda was born on 27 July 1883. He was born in Minamiyana Village, ≈åsumi District (modern-day Hadano City), Kanagawa Prefecture. His real name was Y≈çz≈ç Maeda (ÂâçÁî∞ Ê¥ãÈÄ† Maeda Y≈çz≈ç). He dropped out of middle school without graduating. In 1904 he moved to Tokyo and became a student of the tanka poet Saish≈´ Onoe. He died in 20 April 1951.  Writings  Most of Maeda's early tanka compositions were submitted to a variety of literary magazines and were rejected without a second word. He was encouraged by Saish≈´ Onoe, writer of a poetry column for the periodical Shinsei (Êñ∞Â£∞), to keep up his efforts, however. Maeda and Bokusui Wakayama were among the first poets to join Onoe's Shazens≈ç-sha (ËªäÂâçËçâÁ§æ) when it was founded in 1905. The poets of the Shazens≈ç-sha were insistent of simplicity and clarity of expression, in opposition to the poets associated with important magazine My≈çj≈ç. Maeda was one of the most critical of what he saw as the excessive romanticism of the My≈çj≈ç poets. In 1906, Maeda founded his own poetic society, the Hakujitsu-sha (ÁôΩÊó•Á§æ). In 1924, he was joined by Hakush≈´ Kitahara, Toshiharu Kinoshita, Chikashi Koizumi, Zenmaro Toki and others in forming a group to publish a new literary magazine, Nikk≈ç, which was to be purely devoted to Modernism. He took his first aeroplane ride in 1929, inspiring him to write in a more colloquial fashion ‚Äî he felt the experience could not be described in traditional language. He continued to write unconventional tanka for fifteen years after this. Maeda was an exceptionally prolific poet, and more than 40,000 of his tanka survive, but he published very little of this during his lifetime.  Reception  Literary historian and critic Donald Keene compared Kubota's poetry to that of Akiko Yosano, ironically one of the targets of Maeda's criticism.
