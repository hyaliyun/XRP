He is known as the father of light coagulation which was the predecessor to many eye surgeries.  Early Life  Gerhard Rudolph Meyer was born as the son of Edmund Meyer (1887-1973) and Josephine Meyer B. Schmitz (1890-1959) in Elberfeld, Germany. In 1935, the family also adopted surname of Edmund Meyer's mother, Julie Schwickerath (1860-1929) and henceforth Gerhard Rudolph Meyer was stylized as Meyer-Schwickerath. One year after Gerhard's birth, his younger brother, Klaus Meyer-Schwickerath, was born, who went on to study law and become a politician. After graduating from high school, Meyer-Schwickerath decided not to be a lawyer, contrary to the family tradition, because he did not want to defend Nazism. He opted to become a physician instead. He began his medical studies in 1940. During the World War II he worked as a medic. A knee injury saved him from working on the front lines.Wolfgang Hippe, Staatspreis NRW: Gerhard Meyer-Schwickerath, Staatspreistr√§ger des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen 1989. online  Career  Shortly after the war, Meyer- Schwickerath moved to Hamburg, where he worked as an assistant physician at the University of Hamburg-Eppendorf's eye clinic until 1952. In 1953, he received his post-doctoral degree and the right to professorship at the University of Bonn. In 1959, he worked as senior physician with Paul Mikat and Kurt Biedenkopf to transform Essen's municipal hospital into the Essen University Hospital. From 1959 to his retirement in 1985, Meyer-Schwickerath served as the Director of the Ophthalmology Center at the Essen University Hospital. In 1964, he took the position of professor at the University of M√ºnster. He was an honorary member and president (1973‚Äì75) of the German Ophthalmological Society (DOG). One of his most famous patients was Leonard Bernstein.  Invention of Photocoagulation  Meyer-Schwickerath examined many patients whose retinas were damaged following total solar eclipse of July 9, 1945. He noticed that the retinal scars were the result of surface diathermy. In 1946/1947, Meyer-Schwickerath determined that a progressive retinal detachment could be halted through precision scars. According to some accounts, the idea of producing a scar by means of light came to him following a sleepless night, in which, for fear of forgetting, he had recorded the two words \\"light\\" and \\"coagulation\\" on a note. In 1946, he started conducted the first experiments on light coagulation. In 1949, he performed the first successful treatment of a retinal detachment with a light beam (light coagulation) by with a self-constructed device on the roof of the ophthalmic clinic at the University of Hamburg-Eppendorf. This first device focused sunlight through a telescope and utilized a series of mirrors leading into the operating room and into the eye of a Patients. Since sunlight is not always reliable due to cloud coverage, this method proved to be unsatisfactory in the long run to Meyer-Schwickerath. In the 1950s, he collaborated with the Zeiss Labs to develop the high pressure xenon gas discharge lamp, which eliminated the need for sunlight and produced a stronger beam for coagulation.Werner E.

Personal Life  In 1945, after the war and graduation, Meyer-Schwickerath married 22-year-old Berta Steinbicker in M√ºnster. They had three sons and one daughter.  Legacy  With the development of the light coagulation technique and his later work, Meyer-Schwickerath acquired an international reputation. At the 2007 DOG congress, Charles P. Wilkinson, president of the American Academy of Ophthalmology, counted Meyer-Schwickerath among the pantheon of German medical figures. Wilkinson said, \\"I can assure you that the names von Graefe, Helmholtz, Leber, all the way up to Custodis, Meyer-Schwickerath ‚Äì these legendary names are known to virtually every resident who has ever trained in America.\\"  Honors  Gerhard Meyer-Schwickerath received numerous awards and honorary doctorate different universities.

This project has thereby become the first of such irrigation type projects in the country to be completed in time without any budget enhancements. It also holds a record in Limca Book of Records. The project was Inaugurated by the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh Nara Chandrababu Naidu in March 2016 while the project was completed in one year record of time.  Project Details  The project has one of the largest pump houses in Asia with 24 pumping units spread across an area of 7,476 sq m. The project has a combined capacity to discharge 240 cumecs of water. These pumps deliver water drawn from the river Godavari in Pattiseema into the Polavaram Project Right Main Canal for the benefit of farmers in the Krishna river delta. Under the Bachawat tribunal and inter-state agreement between Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh, 100 tmc of water can be diverted from River Godavari to River Krishna. Pattiseema project will bring the 100 TMC water to River Krishna. This project has faced lot of hurdles in initial days as it was opposed by YSRC party citing that it had no storage component. Though there were objections from opposition parties chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh Nara Chandrababu Naidu has decided to take up this project. The bold decision taken by chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu has helped thousands of farmers cultivating 1.3 million acres in krishna delta which faces water shortage in the period June to August. The water pumped into canal from River Godavari would take 7 ‚Äì 8 days to reach Prakasam Barrage after travelling by Gravity for about 160 km. Polavaram project is envisaged to bring Godavari water to Krishna and the Polavaram Right canal was dug by then Chief Minister YS Rajasekhar Reddy. The Polavaram project got delayed and Chandra Babu Naidu started pattiseema and linked thorugh Right canal to bring water to Krishna. In 2015 as part of trial run it has lifted 8.8 tmc of godavari water to krishna delta which saved standing crops worth Rs2,500 crores during dry spell. During 2016-17 kharif season 56 tmc of godavari water released along with 20 tmc from Nagarjuna sagar project to meet needs of 11,35,900 acres of agriculture as well as 1,51,912 acres of aquaculture in Krishna delta. Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu had been showcasing PLIS as the first project interlinking two major rivers (Godavari and Krishna) in the country. Project utility As there is no adequate water availability (three out of four years) in the Krishna River, the water supplemented, during the monsoon months in to the Prakasam Barrage pond on the Krishna River, from the Godavari River by the Pattiseema Lift would enable the saved water of the Krishna River for the irrigation and drinking water uses of the Rayalaseema region by the Pothireddypadu canal and the Handri Neeva lift from the Srisailam reservoir. Pattiseema Lift would not become redundant even after the Polavaram Project is completed as it would be used during the dry season (December to June months) when the Polavaram right canal is unable to receive water by gravity due to fall in the Polavaram reservoir level below its full canal supply level of MSL. The dead storage (nearly 119 tmcft below the 41.15 MSL) out of the 194 tmcft gross storage of the Polavaram reservoir would be released to the down stream Godavari river and transferred to the Prakasam barrage by the Pattiseema Lift. It would further enable to supply additional Krishna water to the Rayalaseema region by eliminating water support to the Krishna barrage throughout the monsoon year. The power consumption is nearly 100 MW when all the pumps are put in service. The cost of power is nearly Rs one crore per day to supply 0.8 tmcft/day which is affordable to divert the badly needed Krishna water supply to the Rayalaseema region.

Rouse Hill House and farm was the family home of Richard Rouse, the Colonial Superintendent of Public Works and Convicts at Parramatta. The homestead, in the Australian Georgian style, was developed between 1813 and 1819 with further developments in . The homestead is managed by Sydney Living Museums as a museum that is open to the public. Much of the former grounds have been transformed into Rouse Hill Regional Park and subsequent residential and commercial developments. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Rouse family Richard Rouse (1774-1852) appears to have begun building at Rouse Hill in 1813 although the grant of was not made until October 1816.Broadbent & Bogle 1990, 7 Sometime between 1818 and 1825, Rouse, his wife Elizabeth (1772-1849) and family moved from Parramatta to the new house. The son of an Oxfordshire cabinet maker and shop-keeper, Rouse came to the colony, free, in 1801. Prospering quickly, by 1805 he was Superintendent of Public Works and Convicts at Parramatta. In this role he supervised the building of Governor Lachlan Macquarie and his wife's additions to Old Government House, Parramatta, in the mid 1810s. It is possible that these works influenced Rouse to build a bigger house than he first intended, adding larger, longer rooms behind the front range. He chose the site of his new house while building toll houses for Macquarie's upgraded road to the Hawkesbury River. Rouse sited the new house prominently, possibly with an eye to its possible use as an inn, on a hilltop adjacent to the toll house (also built by him) on the Parramatta to Windsor Turnpike. He acquired other properties, more fertile than the Rouse Hill farm, but Rouse Hill had the advantage of strategic siting. While other early colonial homesteads overlooked their crops or pastures, Rouse Hill has always overlooked the busy Windsor Road. It was from here that Rouse and his descendants oversaw their distant pastoral and agricultural interests, rather than the estate itself being the focus of those interests. Rouse was not bred to the land, but was shrewd and capable, careful of money and acquisitive of property. He left, on his death in 1852, extensive holdings throughout the colony. The Rouse Hill estate grew to by Rouse's death, by purchase of an adjacent grant.https://www.hht.net.au/museums/rouse_hill, accessed 15/10/10Historic Houses Trust, 1997, 2 Rouse consolidated his land holdings at North Richmond from around 1806 and increased his pastoral holdings in the north west of New South Wales, using his sons to colonise further west while he continued to acquire land in Parramatta and Western Sydney. A number of the property's outbuildings finished construction following the completion of the house, including the laundry wing, cottage, barn and woolshed. The garden layout reflects the construction of the house between 1813 and 1818. Some trees remain from the plantings in the mid 19th century. With the exception of outbuildings, Rouse seems to have made no other alterations to the property's buildings. This was left to later generations. Rouse died in 1852 leaving the property to his son Edwin Rouse. The property went to Edwin's son Edwin Stephen Rouse on his death in 1862. A summerhouse, woolshed and a two-storey service wing was added in the 1860s, the stables built in 1876 and 1877 and the house redecorated and partly furnished in 1885. The service wing made no direct connection with the house. A verandah, weighted sash windows, a modified front door and sidelights and other late 19th century innovations were also installed. These too have been done in such a way as to preserve the integrity of the house. Rouse Hill Public School opened to the east of Rouse Hill Estate in 1888. Edwin Stephen Rouse's eldest daughter Nina, who had left the house in 1895 to marry George Terry, returned with her husband to live at Rouse Hill in 1924. This was a result of their bankruptcy. Following the death of Edwin Stephen Rouse in 1931 his estate was administered by Trustees, mainly family members and later a family company, until 1969. In 1932 the studio was converted into a breakfast room. Estate subdivision had begun in 1951 and the property had been reduced to by 1963. Nina Terry died at Rouse Hill House in 1968 and the following year the remaining were subdivided. The homestead block of went to her two sons Gerald and Roderick Terry as tenants in common. When a family dispute occurred following the death of Edwin Rouse's granddaughter Nina Terry in 1968, architect John Fisher (early member of the Institute of Architects, member of the Cumberland County Historic Buildings Committee and National Trust of Australia (NSW) Board member after its reformation in 1960) chaired the Rouse Hill Preservation Committee, which brought together the family and representatives of the National Trust of Australia (NSW). This led to the NSW Government resuming the property, which later became a property under the care of the Historic Houses Trust of New South Wales (HHT).Lucas & McGinness, 2012 A further subdivision in 1974 reduced the homestead block to . State government ownership In March 1978 the NSW government purchased the property which also contained 24 outbuildings (and half its contentsMackaness, 2010, 5). It was administered by the Planning and Environment Commission, later the Department of Planning, which commissioned restoration works from the Public Works Department.Broadbent & Bogle, 1990, 7 The Heritage Council's Restoration Steering (HC RS) Committee resolved to have a conservation statement prepared for the buildings and their site. Urgent repair works to the outbuildings were identified and undertaken under the supervision of the Government Architect's Branch, Public Works Department and the main entrance driveway was regraded and regravelled. Urgent repair and stabilisation on the homestead and outbuildings continued and a fire control service was installed in the garden. A gardener was contracted to carry out urgent garden maintenance. The HC RS Committee considered the need for accurate documentation of interior finishes and contents of the buildings and for curatorial and materials conservation work to be carried out. The initial conservation programme was endorsed and circulated to various interested conservation bodies for comment. The Royal Australian Historical Society was requested to undertake an historical research programme on the property. An archaeologist was contracted to be present during any excavation works associated with the repairs programme. There has been a continuity of family ownership at Rouse Hill until 1978. Particular forces in the family's history and those of wealth in the 19th century, followed by financial hardship, longevity and resistance to change in the 20th century have left the property in a poignantly fragile condition. This fragility is inherent in much of the property's historic fabric and is integral to the archival significance of the place. Historic Houses Trust In 1984 the summer house was repaired/reconstructed, and the property was transferred to the Historic Houses Trust in 1987. Family association with the property continued through the occupancy of Gerald Terry from 1968, Roderick Terry, 1968‚Äì80, and the latter's daughter and son in law, Miriam and Ian Hamilton and the Hamiltons' ownership of a significant portion of the collection. The collection was subsequently transferred to the Hamilton Rouse Hill Trust. Since 1978 descendants have returned many significant family items and the collection now comprises over 20,000 objects as diverse as costume, furniture, tools and automobiles. By 1993, there were 25 acres (10 hectares) of land left, in the management of the Historic Houses Trust.Bogle, 1993 When the HHT opened Rouse Hill Estate to the public in 1999 it was in a limited capacity and a very different context. In 2007, anticipating the extraordinary residential growth in the area, the HHT sought funding of $19m from Treasury to provide new visitor and cultural facilities (interpretation, programs, research and access to the collection) along with commercial activities (cafe, retail, auditorium and flexible public spaces to be used as venues). The project aimed to improve the property's sustainability and allowed it to be opened up to thousands of visitors a year. The property received an Energy Australia National Trust Heritage Award in 2004. In 2008, HHT got first stage funding for the education component of its vision for the site. To protect the heritage precinct the State Government established the Rouse Hill Regional Park, transferred the 1888 Rouse Hill Public School (former) and adjacent lands to the HHT and diverted the upgraded Windsor Road (to the east away from the house and school).Mackaness, 2010, 5 Advocacy by the Friends of the HIstoric Houses Trust was in large part responsible for moving the road to create this bypass, protecting the site's setting from encroachment. On 10 March 2009, remnant Roads & Traffic Authority (RTA) lands were transferred to the HHT (from the Windsor Road bypass which is open further to the east than the old road alignment (in a cutting). The Hills Shire Council approved stage one development application for works. In 2009-10, the construction program was almost complete on former RTA land and Rouse Hill Public School (former) adjoining re-aligned Windsor Road. The school house was conserved, repainted in Victorian colour scheme and interpreted as 19th century school; cafe, retail, education centre and outdoor auditorium (for 60); parking; security; flexible public spaces to be used as venues and landscaping works completed. The property's capacity and visitation rate increased, including increasing numbers of local schools (capacity now for 20,000 children a year to visit). Transfer of the remnant RTA lands created a new opportunity for research and interpretation. HHT historians Joy Hughes, Jane Kelson and curator Fergus Clunie began gathering historic maps of the region. Searching for the location of the original Toll House at Rouse Hill, he unearthed new evidence about the line of the old Hawkesbury Road (1794-1813) on which the pursuit and \\"battle of Vinegar Hill\\", an armed conflagration between convicts and troops, took place in 1804. Although the road has long since disappeared, it defined the boundary of the first land grant in the area, the 1000 acre \\"Copenhagen\\" given to Captain William Bligh. It also ran close to the surviving kilometre stretch of the old Windsor Road built by convicts in 1812-13 as the first turnpike in the colony between Sydney and the Hawkesbury. The exact location of the battle of Vinegar Hill has long been debated, but the map evidence and line of the old Hawkesbury Road indicate that it most likely took place between Second Ponds Creek and the crest of Rouse Hill, formerly known as Vinegar Hill. A line of very early trees at the edge of the road is believed to date back to the time of the battle. Rouse Hill house dating from 1813, is remarkable as one of the longest continuously occupied houses in Australia, set in the oldest surviving garden in Australia and with original outbuildings, interiors and collections intact. As the likely site of the battle of Vinegar Hill, it now has a new level of significance, with exciting interpretive possibilities, and this has encouraged HHT to rethink its approach to the property.Mackaness, 2010, 4-5 By June 2016, increased visitation had been achieved by introducing a series of limited-number tours of the house's interiors. Works to conserve the farm's dairy precinct had been completed. Two main posts whose subsoil bases had decayed were re-footed, with new spliced material and a pad footing.

This intactness extends to all aspects of the property.Historic Houses Trust 1997:6 The property is perhaps unique for its survival as a largely intact estate with an unbroken chain of occupancy, allowing the survival of major garden and interior elements of every period of its history to the present. This layering of artefacts and fashions is especially prevalent in the gardens where designs and physical details such as edging, fencing, planting containers, bed designs and paths provide a case history for the study of the development of garden practices in Australia. The physical condition of the property was reported as being good as at 18 September 1997. House Rouse Hill house is a large two storey Georgian house set on top of a ridge which falls away gradually to all cardinal points. The house is oriented to the northeast, midway between Parramatta & Windsor. The house has a separate two storey brick service wing, offices forming an arcaded courtyard, 22 rooms, staircase hall, service stair and two cellar rooms. The house has a fine stone-flagged stair hall with cantilevered timber stair. The doors are all six panelled with some architraves and panelled jamb linings. The main house is built of sandstone with a slate roof, timber floors(kitchen, scullery, staircase, hall, arcade and verandah are flagged) and oakgrained hardwood joinery. Garden The garden is perhaps Australia's oldest surviving colonial garden in relatively intact form. The surviving physical evidence in the gardens includes borders in a variety of materials, fence and gate remnants, fragments of trellis and arbours, paving and numerous soil displacements that become evident with the location's annual dry spells. These physical remains, matched with pictorial evidence from photographs, drawings and engravings of the property, and writings, have resulted in the identification of four stages of the garden's development: , , and . This continuity and evidence of evolution of a very early intact garden from the first quarter of the 19th century to the Edwardian era and 20th century is extremely rare in Australia. The effects of new technologies in Australian estate gardening with replacement of palings with wire fences, displacement of stone and brick garden or path edgings with terracotta tile edgings, etc. are quite evident.Bogle, 1993 adapted by Read, S., 2004 Dominating the garden and seen from afar are tall, mature Araucaria pines (Bunya pine, A. bidwillii and hoop pine, A. cunninghamii).Stuart Read, 6/2014 visit Bath House (1858) Picturesque building in the garden thought to have been built by Scottish-born Parramatta builder and architect, James Houison, it originally featured ine arched timber trellises on the two verandahs and porches on each side.

The Rouse dairy contains a linear row of bails, with a gabled, fibre-cement- clad \\"milk house\\" at the western end that held the pumping machinery and generator. As per 1947 plan specifications, the floor was laid with easily washed concrete to maintain strict hygiene. A much earlier timber structure, containing two cow bails for hand-milking, also survives at Rouse Hill House and features in tours of its outbuildings. Outbuildings Other buildings on the site include a slab built cow shed, brick bath house, a reconstructed timber summer house, brick stables.Chivell 1978 The property also has an extant caretaker's house.  Heritage listing  Rouse Hill Estate is one of the most significant and substantial houses of the Macquarie period which dates from 1810 to 1822. Rouse Hill Estate is the largest and most complete publicly owned physical record - in the form of buildings, furnishings, artefacts and landscape relationship - of the occupancy and culture of a European-Australian family, encompassing the tastes, fortunes, and endeavours of seven generations from the early 19th century to the late 20th century.Historic Houses Trust 1997:8 The property is perhaps unique for its survival as a largely intact estate with an unbroken chain of occupancy, allowing the survival of major garden and interior elements of every period of its history to the present. This layering of artefacts and fashions is especially prevalent in the gardens where designs and physical details such as edging, fencing, planting containers, bed designs and paths provide a case history for the study of the development of garden practices in Australia.

This continuity and evidence of evolution of a very early intact garden from the first quarter of the 19th century to the Edwardian era and 20th century is extremely rare in Australia. Rouse Hill Estate was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Rouse Hill Estate is significant for the record of the Rouse and Terry family occupancy over the seven generations and 180 years which the property constitutes. This record is to be found physically in the house, its outbuildings, finishes, collection, garden and rural curtilage. The property is significant for: * Its association with Richard Rouse, building contractor and free settler, and Superintendent of Public Works, based at Parramatta. * Its association with the convict period through assignment of convicts for the building of the house and operation of Rouse Hill Estate and nearby properties. * As a record of the history of taste and level of cultural awareness held by a particular class of people in the history of New South Wales. The property provides evidence of recurrent themes in NSW history, for example, the family's prosperity throughout the 19th century followed by relative poverty in the 20th century is representative of \\"Boom and Bust\\" themes in Australian social and economic history. Of local significance is its association with a local population which included men and women who worked on the Rouse Hill property, shop keepers, local clergy, school masters and their families. Historic Houses Trust 1997:6-7 The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Rouse Hill Estate is exceptional as a record of the aesthetic tastes of seven generations of a single family. The aesthetic responses to the place depend on the diversity of the visual evidence - in the building, range of decorative and applied arts, garden and the agricultural surrounds, and their interconnectedness.Historic Houses Trust 1997:7 The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The family history is representative of a class of people who survived the 1840s depression to rise to social prominence in the second half of the 19th century. It encompasses: *the family's role as landowners with significant commercial interests in Parramatta *the family's pre commercial and social prominence as pastoralists *the social make-up of the extended family which included, free settlers, emancipists, pastoralists, businessmen, merchants and military, political and engineering men. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The property is significant for: *The evidence that the wide range of building works, including agricultural works, provides of various forms of design and construction from 1812 to the present *The wide range of services and domestic equipment at the place dating from 1812 to the present. *the immense research potential of the continuum of building techniques, services and equipment on the site and for the one family. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The garden is important for its layout rather than its plants. It is perhaps the earliest garden design to have survived in NSW, almost unaltered in form although modified slightly in detail.Broadbent & Bogle 1990:24 The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The historical relationship of Rouse Hill to other properties owned by the Rouse family is representative of historical patterns of settlement in NSW in which first generation properties on the Cumberland Plain were supplemented or eclipsed.

NGC 4753 was discovered by astronomer William Herschel on February 22, 1784. It is notable for having distinct dust lanes that surround its nucleus. The galaxy is a member of the Virgo II Groups, an extension of the Virgo Cluster. Physical characteristics The distribution of dust in NGC 4753 lies in an inclined disk wrapped several times around the nucleus. The material in the disk may have been accreted from the merger of gas rich dwarf galaxy. Over several orbital periods, the accreted material eventually smeared out into a disk. Differential precession that occurred after the accretion event caused the disk to twist. Eventually, the disk settled into a fixed orientation with respect to the galaxy. The age of the disk is estimated to be around half a billon to a billion years. Another explanation suggests that the dust in NGC 4753 originated from red giant stars in the galaxy. Dark Matter Analysis of the twisted disk in NGC 4753 by Steiman-Cameron et al. revealed that most of the mass in the galaxy lies in a slightly flattened spherical halo of Dark Matter. Globular clusters NGC 4753 has an estimated population of 1070 ¬± 120 globular clusters. Supernovae NGC 4753 has been the host to two supernovae, SN 1965I and SN 1983G. SN 1965I On June 18, 1965 a type 1a supernova was discovered in NGC 4753. SN 1983G Astronomer Robert Evan discovered a type 1a supernova known as SN 1983g in NGC 4753. The supernova was discovered on April 4, 1983. Group Membership NGC 4753 is a member of its own galaxy group, known as the NGC 4753 Group. The NGC 4753 Group is located near the southern edge of the Virgo Cluster. The group, along with other groups of galaxies form part of a filament that extends off from the southern border of the Virgo Cluster that is called the Virgo II Groups.

The speaker contains a six-microphone array, allowing use of the virtual assistant Amazon Alexa. In 2018, the smart speaker added support for Apple's AirPlay 2. Originally slated for 2018, Google Assistant integration was released in May 2019.  Design   Hardware  The Sonos One features two Class-D amplifiers, a woofer, a tweeter, and six far-field microphones. Running on a 64-bit motherboard, it is equipped with an AC and Ethernet port on the back of the speaker and is capable of 802.11b/g Wi-Fi connection. When connected to the network using Ethernet, the speaker can also act as a Sonos BOOST.  Software  The Sonos Controller app mainly controls and sets up the speaker, but can also connect other music services like Spotify, Amazon Music, Pandora Radio, and iHeart Radio through voice interaction. As with its predecessor, the speaker can link with SonosNet, a mesh network to play media for one, some or all speakers regardless of location. The speaker communicates with the companion app and music streaming services through Wi- Fi.  Sonos One Gen 2  The second generation of the Sonos One increased the memory, added Bluetooth Low Energy and updated the processor. The three updates do not include any new features from the Gen 1s. Sonos states that the original Ones will continue to support all current features but the Gen 2 may allow them to add new experiences that the Gen 1 will not be able to support. The Gen 1 and Gen 2 will work as a stereo pair and look and sound the same. The only visual difference is the branding on the bottom of the Gen 2.  Sonos One SL  In addition to the Gen 2, Sonos released the One SL in September 2019. The SL version is the same as the Gen 2 without the microphones (so you cannot use Alexa or the Google Assistant). The SL is intended as the replacement for the Play:1 speakers and addresses the concerns that some users have with smart technology.

They serve ceremonial and security functions. By tradition, the reigning Sultan of Yogyakarta serves as Colonel-in-chief of the Guards.  History  The Kraton Guards in 1920 The Yogyakarta Kraton Guards were formed during the reign of Hamengkubuwono I around the seventeenth century.OBYEK PENELITIAN, http://elib.unikom.ac.id/ The soldiers of the infantry and cavalry troops used firearms, in the form of rifles and cannons. For about half a century, the Kraton Guards were strong, as was proven when Hamengkubuwono II led an armed resistance against the invasion of British troops under General Gillespie in June 1812. Following the reign of Hamengkubuwono III, the British company was able to dissolve the army of the Yogyakarta Sultanate. In an agreement on October 2, 1813, signed by Sultan Hamengkubuwono III and Stamford Raffles, it was written that the Sultanate of Yogyakarta was not justified in maintaining strong armed forces. Under the supervision of the British Government of the Company, the palace could have only limited armed entities. It was no longer possible for them to perform military functions. Since then, the function of armed units has been limited to guarding the sultan, the palace and its traditions.When Raffles ran Java, Tim Hanningan, historytoday.com Prawirotomo (Javanese: Í¶•Í¶øÍ¶ÆÍ¶∂Í¶´Í¶∫Í¶¥Í¶†Í¶∫Í¶¥Í¶©Í¶∫Í¶¥) soldier is a soldier who has advantages compared to other soldiers, this is not separated from the origin of the soldier's existence of 1000 members of Mataram army who helped the prince Mangkubumi to fight the Dutch East India Company. When the Dutch East India Company returned to power, the armed forces that had been weakened were increasingly reduced until they had no military relevance. According to existing records, from the reign of Hamengkubuwono VII to the reign of Hamengkubuwono VIII between 1877 and 1939 13 companies of the Kraton Guard Regiment existed: * Sumoatmojo (Javanese: Í¶±Í¶∏Í¶©Í¶∫Í¶¥Í¶ÆÍ¶†ÍßÄÍ¶©Í¶∫Í¶¥Í¶óÍ¶∫Í¶¥) * Ketanggung (Javanese: Í¶èÍ¶∫Í¶†Í¶ÅÍ¶íÍ¶∏Í¶Å) * Patangpuluh (Javanese: Í¶•Í¶†Í¶ÅÍ¶•Í¶∏Í¶≠Í¶∏Í¶É) * Wirobrojo (Javanese: Í¶ÆÍ¶∂Í¶´Í¶ßÍ¶øÍ¶ó) * Jogokaryo (Javanese: Í¶óÍ¶∫Í¶¥Í¶íÍ¶∫Í¶¥Í¶èÍ¶ÇÍ¶™Í¶∫Í¶¥) * Nyutro (Javanese: Í¶öÍ¶∏Í¶†Í¶øÍ¶∫Í¶¥) * Dhaeng (Javanese: Í¶ÆÍ¶∂Í¶´Í¶ßÍ¶øÍ¶ó) * Jager (Javanese: Í¶óÍ¶íÍ¶∫Í¶Ç) * Prawirotomo (Javanese: Í¶•Í¶øÍ¶ÆÍ¶∂Í¶´Í¶∫Í¶¥Í¶†Í¶∫Í¶¥Í¶©Í¶∫Í¶¥) * Mantrijero (Javanese: Í¶©Í¶§ÍßÄÍ¶†Í¶øÍ¶∂Í¶óÍ¶∫Í¶´Í¶∫Í¶¥) * Langenastro (Javanese: Í¶≠Í¶îÍ¶∫Í¶§Í¶±ÍßÄÍ¶†Í¶øÍ¶∫Í¶¥) * Surokarso (Javanese: Í¶±Í¶∏Í¶´Í¶∫Í¶¥Í¶èÍ¶ÇÍ¶±Í¶∫Í¶¥) * Bugis (Javanese: Í¶ßÍ¶∏Í¶íÍ¶∂Í¶±ÍßÄ).

In 1942, the Kraton Guards were dissolved by the Japanese government, but in 1970, they were restored at the orders of Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX. Ten companies were officially reactivated with some changes in their structure. Originally, 13 companies formed the Kraton Guard Regiment. The changes in the newer version include changes to dress uniforms, ceremonial weapons, the number of personnel and recruitment techniques. The ten companies (two battalions) of the Kraton Guard Regiment can be seen by the public at least three times a year, at the Garebeg Mulud, Garebeg Besar and Garebeg Syawal ceremonies, in the alun-alun of Keraton Ngayogyakarta Hadiningrat. These ten companies are reinforced by the two companies of the Royal Guard Battalion of Pakualaman. When combined, the RGB serves as the unofficial 3rd (reserve) Battalion of the regiment for events around Yogyakarta City and the Yogyakarta Special Region. The 10 companies consist of around 90 active personnel and each are organized into a platoon of musketeers (carrying Lee-Enfields and Beretta BM59s) and lancers each.

History  Jiayetang's founder Liu Chenggan was a bibliophile from a wealthy banker family of Huzhou. Chenggan invested a tremendous amount of money collecting rare publications from different dynasties of China. Jiayetang, at its peak, included parts of the Yongle Encyclopedia and drafts of Siku Quanshu. Among its collections were the Song dynasty version of the Early Four Historiographies (Shiji, Han Shu, Hou Hanshu and Sanguo Zhi). In 1950, after the communist revolution, the library was specifically protected due to its value. Jiayetang's unique documents concerning Sino-Indian borders were later used as strategic resources during the Sino-Indian War of 1962. Currently, Jiayetang possesses over 150 thousand woodcut plates originally used for book publication.

While initially and currently described as a species, from 1959-2006 it was considered a subspecies of the Mexican funnel- eared bat, Natalus stramineus. Taxonomy Gerrit Smith Miller described it as a new species in 1902. Per Tejedor 2005, other authors followed in listing N. mexicanus as a full species in 1949. In 1959, George Goodwin revised it from a species to a subspecies of the Mexican funnel-eared bat, Natalus stramineus. Per Tejedor 2011, it was revised again to species status in 2006. In 2012, another funnel-eared bat of Mexico, Natalus lanatus, was synonymized with Natalus mexicanus, meaning that there is currently only one recognized species of funnel-eared bat in Mexico. Description It is a small bat, weighing only . Its forearms are long. Its back is a pale orange brown or yellow in color, and its belly is yellow. It has broad, cream-colored ears with blackish margins. The skin of its face is pale pink. Its limbs are very long in relation to its body size. Its flight membranes are pale brown. Its wings are long and narrow. Biology Females are monoestrous, or capable of becoming pregnant once a year. Pregnant females have been observed January through July, and gestation is thought to last 8-10 months due to slow fetal development. The litter size is one pup. It roosts in caves during the day. It is colonial, forming groups of up to 300 individuals. Range and habitat It is found in Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Panama. It is not found at elevations above , though most observations of it occur at around . It prefers dry and semi-deciduous forests. Occasionally, it is also encountered in conifer forests. Conservation As of 2019, it is evaluated as least concern by the IUCN. It meets this criteria because it has a wide geographic range, and its population size is presumed to be large. While its population trend is unknown, it is thought that it is, at least, not declining rapidly. It is threatened by cave disturbance by tourists and by mining activities.

She has been revered as the \\"mother of plant virology and serology\\".  Early life and education  Beale was born in Croton-on-Hudson, New York. She attended Ossining School, and continued on in 1914 to Barnard College, where she earned her A.B. in botany in 1918. She then attended Cornell University to pursue a Ph.D. in plant pathology at the newly created Department of Plant Pathology. From 1918 to 1919, Beale worked with Herbert Hice Whetzel, the creator and chair of the department, but ultimately postponed completion of the degree. Several years later, in 1925, her principal investigator at the time, Louis O. Kunkel at the Boyce Thompson Institute, encouraged her to resume her graduate studies at Cornell. She returned to Whetzel's lab and began working on her M.S. degree. Though she completed a dissertation, Whetzel refused to sign off on the degree. In 1927, with the encouragement of Kunkel, Beale resumed her pursuit of the Ph.D., this time enrolling in Columbia University in the department of bacteriology. During this time, she learned about cutting-edge techniques in bacteriology and serology from Fredrick Parker Gay, and about immunologic tools in diagnosing human disease from Claus W. Jungeblu. These experiences helped her shape and complete a dissertation on serologic identification of plant viruses, particularly tobacco mosaic virus.  Career  From 1919 to 1920, after postponing her graduate studies at Cornell, Beale was an instructor at Vassar College where she taught biology. After receiving an American-Scandinavian Foundation fellowship, she spent 1 year at the University of Copenhagen. Upon her return to the United States, she joined the New York City Department of Health where she worked in the research laboratory of William H. Park, building on her expertise in bacteriology and serology. In 1921, she became an accredited laboratory assistant in bacteriology after passing the New York State exam, and was offered a laboratory assistant position with William A. Murrill at the New York Botanical Gardens studying fungi (mycology) in 1922. After becoming a Bishop Museum Fellow in 1923, Beale spent 1 year in Honolulu at the Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Association. When she returned to New York in 1924, she applied for and was accepted to a position as a plant pathologist at the newly opened the Boyce Thompson Institute located, at the time, in Yonkers, New York. She remained at the Boyce Thompson Institute for the bulk of her career, even continuing her research there while she co-currently pursued her graduate studies at Columbia University. With her Ph.D. completed in 1929, she was granted a National Research Council Fellowship and became a Research Associate in the department of Bacteriology at Columbia University in addition to her position at the Boyce Thompson Institute. During her career, Beale was granted funding from the John and Mary R. Markle Foundation (1942‚Äì1946) for advancement in serology, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1942) \\"for a study of the photoelectric titration of plant viruses\\". In 1948, she was promoted to both plant pathologist at the Boyce Thompson Institute, and to research associate at Columbia University. Beale retired from these positions in 1952 and began a prolific monograph on plant viruses. The project was well funded across several sources including the American Tobacco Corporation, the Boyce Thompson Institute, the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, the National Institutes of Health, the National Library of Medicine, and received USDA and Agricultural Research Service support. The project concluded with the publication of \\"Bibliography of Plant Viruses and Index to Research\\" in 1976.  Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research  Beale joined the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research in 1924 where she remained until her retirement in 1952. She originally joined the virology laboratory of Louis O. Kunkel, whose research focus was on the cause and transmission method of yellows disease in plants. At the time, tobacco mosaic disease in plants (particularly tobacco plants, and fresh market crops, like tomatoes and potatoes) was negatively impacting American agriculture and the economy. The disease was highly infectious and easily spread to a healthy plant simply by touching the leaf with infected leaf sap. There was great economic pressures to find the cause of tobacco mosaic disease and a way to control it, ensuring continued agricultural production. Key research questions were: #Were all cases of tobacco mosaic disease caused by the same infectious agent, or several infectious agents leading to similar disease symptoms? #What was(were) the infectious agent(s)? #Was there a way to definitively diagnosis a plant had been infected?  Research contribution  Peter K. Olitsky, at the Rockefeller Institute, had previously proposed that tobacco mosaic disease was caused by a bacterial infection. Setting out to investigate, Beale published she was \\"unable to obtain any evidence that the active agent producing mosaic disease in tobacco and tomato plants multiplies outside the living plants\\", casting suspicion on a bacterial cause. Turning to investigate the leaves of infected plant leaves, Beale developed a bioassay to track the development of an infection with a 0.5% aqueous solution of iodine green. Beale's landmark contribution to the application of serology in the field of plant virology precipitated as a result of her dissertation work in 1929. She demonstrated infected leaf sap injected into rabbits could produce polyclonal antibodies in rabbit antiserum that were not found in the control (non-infected leaf sap injections). The antibodies were specific to Tobacco mosaic virus, thus identifying and characterizing the virus as a pathogenic agent in tobacco mosaic disease. The specificity of the antibody for Tobacco mosaic virus, being unreactive with other viruses, proved to be a useful tool with which to diagnose a Tobacco mosaic virus infection. It also allowed for the isolation and characterization of unique strains of Tobacco mosaic virus, making it possible for her collaborator, Wendell M. Stanley, to work with a single pure strain. This increased research precision helped facilitate and accelerate Stanley's contributions to the advancement of the Tobacco mosaic virus field. Furthermore, she demonstrated that Tobacco mosaic virus in leaf sap could be neutralized, or inactivated, by the antibodies isolated from the antiserum. In conclusion, Beale formed the basis of using immunology and serology to chemically define the Tobacco mosaic virus nature which could be expanded and applied to the virology field in general.  Legacy  Helen Purdy Beale's research with Tobacco mosaic virus integrated immunology into the field of plant virology, and the serology tools she developed would become standard practices both in research and medical diagnostics. Her collaborator, W. M. Stanley, has been quoted stating that Beale possessed the rare quality to \\"correlate the chemical with the serological work and thus to secure fundamental information regarding viruses in general\\". In his recommendation letter Beale's application to the Guggenheim Fellowship, Kunkel wrote \\"In my opinion Dr Beale possesses unusual ability as a research worker and as a scholar....She is one of those gifted persons who periodically comes for-ward with a new idea\\".  Death  Beale died on November 5, 1976, in Ridgefield, Connecticut, where she lived in retirement. Her obituary described her as \\"unflappable, witty, and persevering\\".

It is located on the Lorraine Plateau in northeastern France, 1 mile (1.6 km) to the west of √âtain; on the west side of the D√©partemental 906 (D906) (Meuse) road, adjacent to the village of Rouvres- en-Woevre in the Meuse d√©partement about 12 miles east of Verdun. It was built in 1937 and has been used by the French, British, and U.S. Air Forces, before the French Army took the base over, after 1967. Origins P-61 Black Widow with rockets installed at √âtain-Rouvres Air Base, c. 1944. Rouvres airdrome was built by the French Air Force in 1937. They flew Bloch-131 tactical reconnaissance aircraft. When World War II began, the Royal Air Force moved in flying Hawker Hurricanes of No. 73 Squadron RAF. After the fall of France, the Luftwaffe used the base, flying Focke-Wolfe Fw-190D fighters. When the German Army was driven out by the U S Third Army in early September 1944, the airfield was put back into operational service by the United States Army Air Forces IX Engineer Command 926th Engineering Aviation Regiment. On 9 September the combat engineers arrived to lay down a temporary airfield to support the ground forces in their advance against enemy forces. The 926th EAR laid down a 5000' grass runway aligned roughly east‚Äìwest (08/26), along with a small support area. The 7th Field Hospital was stationed here on 13 Sep 1944, where C-47 transports of the IX Tactical Air Command evacuated wounded to General Hospitals in the rear. In late October 1944, the 825th Engineering Aviation Regiment returned to the airfield and improved the facility, laying down an all-weather Pierced Steel Planking (PSP) runway for Ninth Air Force combat fighter use along with upgrading the support site with tents for billeting and also for support facilities; an access road was built to the existing road infrastructure; a dump for supplies, ammunition, and gasoline drums, along with a drinkable water and minimal electrical grid for communications and station lighting. The United States Army Air Forces Ninth Air Force 362d Fighter Group used the captured airfield from 5 November 1944 until early April 1945. Its USAAF designation was A-82, Verdun/Etain Advanced Landing Ground (ALG). Three squadrons of P-47 \\"Thunderbolts\\" bombed and strafed such targets as flak positions, armored vehicles, and troop concentrations during the Battle of the Bulge. There was some controversy at the time as stationing a hospital and a combat unit on the same airstrip was a violation of the Geneva Conventions, but the 7th Field Hospital was not relocated until 15 Jan 1945 after Metz was taken. The 362d received a Distinguished Unit Citation for action over the Moselle-Rhine River triangle. Despite the intense anti- aircraft fire encountered while flying armed reconnaissance in close cooperation with infantry forces in that area on 16 March 1945, the 362d hit enemy forces, equipment, and facilities, its targets including motor transports, armored vehicles, railroads, railway cars, and gun emplacements. In addition P-61 \\"Black Widows\\" from the 425th and 416th Night Fighter Squadrons operated from Verdun/Etain until moving into occupied Germany in 1945. By mid-April the airfield had become redundant combat needs and the facility was returned to being a S&E; (Supply and Evacuation) airfield, and was used until being closed on 22 May 1945. The wartime airfield was then turned over to French authorities.Johnson, David C. (1988), U.S. Army Air Forces Continental Airfields (ETO), D-Day to V-E Day; Research Division, USAF Historical Research Center, Maxwell AFB, Alabama. In the immediate postwar years, Etain Air Base was unused. In May 1952 the World War II airfield at Etain was proposed for expansion into a modern air base. An agreement was reached to redevelop Etain and to station United States Air Force tactical fighter-bombers there by the end of 1954. However budget restrictions delayed major construction for about a year. Although a base facility was ready for the USAF to use at the end of 1954, the facility was not ready for full acceptance until the summer of 1956 with the railroad spur into Etain not being completed until June 1955, and underground fuel storage was delayed until 1956. United States Air Force use The first contingent of USAF personnel to Etain Air Base was Flight \\"C\\", 73rd Support Group (Depot) from Chateauroux-Deols Air Base on 1 February 1953. This advanced group was tasked with safeguarding USAF property and to coordinate construction activities. In addition, the 7005th Air Base Squadron was activated to bring the base up to operational status. The first USAF unit to use Etan AB was the 388th Fighter- Bomber Wing, deploying to France from Clovis Air Force Base, New Mexico in December 1954. The 388th FBW's flying elements consisted of the 561st, 562d, and 563d Fighter-Bomber Squadrons, each equipped with North American F-86 Sabre (F models). The mission of the 388th FBW was to train for and conduct tactical nuclear weapons delivery.  49th Fighter-Bomber Wing  North American F-100D-40-NH Super Sabre Serial 55-2760 assigned to the 562d TFS/388th TFW, then to 7th TFS/49th TFW Headquarters, 49th Fighter-Bomber Wing was assigned to √âtain Air Base, absorbing the assets of the 388th FBW. The wing was relocated to France from Misawa Air Base, Japan.  U.S. Army  After the departure of the 49th TFW, the base was maintained by Detachment 1, 7514th Support Group, headquartered at Toul Air Base. √âtain Air Base was put into a standby status by the USAF. U. S. Army units were moved onto the base from the Verdun area to relieve overcrowding there. In the spring of 1960 Company C and Headquarters & Service Company of the 97th Engineer Battalion (Construction) relocated to the airfield from the Maginot caserne in Verdun. They provided general engineering services in the area including in Verdun, the old Maginot Line (NATO facilities), and in Etain. The 249th Engineer Battalion (Construction) also was assigned the base to build a railroad spur line to a munitions dump near the old World War I battlefield. In late summer of 1965, the 249th relocated back to Germany while the 97th moved to Sidi Brahim Barracks in √âtain town proper, freeing up the base for Air Force reserve use during the Berlin Wall crisis. In addition to these Army units, some small USAF weather, civil engineering and postal squadrons were assigned to the base.  1961 Berlin Crisis  After two years without any permanent flying units, on 5 September 1961 √âtain Air Base was reactivated as part of Operation Tack Hammer, the United States response to the Berlin Crisis. Former Ohio 166th TFS Republic F-84F-40-RE Thunderstreak, Serial 52-6526. Today, this aircraft is on permanent exhibit at the Museum of the United States Air Force Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio The 121st Tactical Fighter Wing of the Ohio Air National Guard were called to active duty for a period of twelve months on 1 October. When activated, the wing consisted of three operational units, the 162nd TFSquadron, based at Springfield Municipal Airport, Springfield Ohio; the 164th based at Mansfield-Lahm Municipal Airport, Mansfield Ohio, and the 166th based at Lockbourne AFB, Ohio. However, due to funding shortages, only 26 F-84Fs of 166th TFS was deployed to France, although several ground support units from the 162nd and 164th were also deployed. On 4 November the first ANG T-33 aircraft arrived at Etain, with the F-84s arriving on 16 November. On 11 December, the deployed units of the 121st TFW were redesignated the 7121st Tactical Wing. In July 1962 the deployed Air National Guardsmen were no longer needed in Europe and the 7121st began to redeploy its personnel to Ohio. All the aircraft and support equipment, however, remained at Etain to equip a new wing being formed there, the 366th Tactical Fighter Wing. The last of the ANG personnel departed on 9 August 1962. The 7368th Combat Support Group was activated to operate the base after their departure.  391st Tactical Fighter Squadron  The 366th Tactical Fighter Wing was a USAFE experiment. Wing Headquarters for the 366th was activated at Chaumont-Semoutiers Air Base on 8 May 1962, with 4 operational aircraft squadrons being equipped with the aircraft left behind by the deployed Air National Guard wings deployed to France as a result of the Berlin Crisis. The assets of the ANG 166th TFS at Etain were assigned to the 391st Tactical Fighter Squadron, with other squadrons being formed at Chambley, Phalsbourg and Chaumont Air Bases. The ANG 166th TFS had transferred 25 F-84Fs to the 366th at Etain, and the squadron allocation was 20, 5 aircraft were transferred to Phalsbourg. In addition, several pilots from the 166th remained on active duty in France performed instructor duty for the new pilots being assigned to Etain. The 366th TFW/391 TFS remained at √âtain until 16 July 1963 when the 366th TFW moved to Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico. USAF closure The 7368th CSG remained to maintain the base in a reserve status for the next several years. The No. 1 Wing RCAF (Royal Canadian Air Force) from Marville AB used √âtain during May 1965 for NATO exercises, but otherwise the base remained largely unoccupied. On 7 March 1966, French President Charles De Gaulle announced that France would withdraw from NATO's integrated military structure. The United States was informed that it must remove its military forces from France by 1 April 1967. By 16 November all American equipment was removed from the facility and on 15 March 1967 √âtain Air Base was returned to the French. Current Uses After the USAF departed, √âtain AB was taken over by the French Army as a helicopter base. It was renamed Base Lieutenant √âtienne Mantoux. Currently, the 3rd Combat Helicopter Regiment (3 RHC) operates from the base and flies SA341, SA342, SA 342L1 and 342M1 VIVIANE \\"Gazelles\\", and SA 330 \\"Pumas\\". About 1000 soldiers serve with the regiment, which has participated in operations in C√¥te d'Ivoire, the Balkans, Indonesia, Lebanon, and Chad. The 3rd RHC will be the first numeric regiment of the brigade with systems as SIR and SIT. The base is well-maintained and has been expanded over the years, and remains a front-line French military installation. References * Endicott, Judy G.

Formerly a merchant vessel named Union, she was purchased by Admiralty in 1776 and sent to North America to resupply larger naval vessels in action against American rebels. She was captured by a 20-gun American privateer on 8 May 1779, following a brisk action which killed her captain and five of her crew. Retaken by the British two days later, she was sailed to Scotland where she was sold out of Navy service in December 1779.  Construction  The outbreak of the American Revolutionary War in 1775, and the need to service substantial fleets at sea, strained Royal Navy resources and necessitated the purchase of additional storeships, transports and victualler vessels. As part of this process, on 13 June 1776 the Admiralty instructed the Navy Board to obtain two new ships of around 300 tons burthen, which would resupply naval vessels then operating off the Gulf of St Lawrence in North America. Only one such ship was immediately available a merchant barque named Union, was offered for sale by shipping agent James Wilkinson, with an asking price was ¬£9 per ton for hull, masts and yards. A Navy Board counter-offer of ¬£6.4s per ton was refused, and on 10 July the vessel was purchased on Wilkinson's terms for ¬£3,438.Winfield 2007, p. 358Syrett 1988, pp.6768 Seven days later she was brought into Deptford Dockyard where she was renamed Elephant and placed in a dry dock for fitting- out and for copper sheathing of her hull. As built, Elephant was long with an keel, a beam of , and a roomy hold depth of . Her crew quarters were comfortably designed, with a headroom of between and , and a captain's cabin measuring . The ship as a whole measured 382 tons burthen; nearly one quarter larger than the Navy Board's specifications in making the purchase. The merchant vessel Union had been unarmed, so dockyard workers now cut five gunports on each side of her upper deck and filled these with four-pounder cannons.Syrett 1988, pp. 7172 Eight -pounder swivel guns were also ranged along her sides for use against enemy boarding parties. Her Admiralty- designated complement was 40, including only one commissioned officer a lieutenant who would serve as captain. The crew comprised four warrant officers a boatswain, a gunner, a carpenter and a surgeon and eight petty officers, 22 naval ratings, and six servants and other ranks.Rodger 1986, pp. 348351 Naval career Elephant was commissioned into the Royal Navy in July 1776, as a storeship under the command of Lieutenant Benjamin Bechinoe. In 17779 her command was transferred to Lieutenant Robert Long, for service In New York harbour. On 21 April 1779 she set sail from New York for Portsmouth, and had reached Newfoundland Banks by 8 May, when she encountered the 20-gun American privateer General Mifflin. The equally matched vessels engaged in battle over the next six hours before Elephant was surrendered with the loss of five of her crew, including Lieutenant Long. A further ten men were wounded, and they and the other survivors were taken aboard General Mifflin as prisoners. A 14-member American prize crew took command of Elephant and set sail for the North American mainland. The voyage was unsuccessful; on 10 May the captured vessel was sighted by the Royal Navy's 74-gun third rate, , and was retaken after a short pursuit. which immediately recaptured her and her crew. The Americans were taken aboard Hero as prisoners and a British crew piloted the recaptured Elephant to Scotland for repairs. She made port in Greenock near Port Glasgow, in June 1779, but was declared surplus to Navy requirements four months later. She was removed from Navy lists in December 1779, and is recorded as having been sold into private hands, at Greenock, for the sum of ¬£1,500.

Biography  She was born in 1937, the daughter of Mar√≠a Teresa Gonz√°lez and Mr. Ladr√≥n de Guevara. She began her career around 1957 as a dancer in nightclubs and theaters. In cinema, she began participating in films such as El boxeador (1958), starring Joaqu√≠n Cordero, and Tin Tan y las modelos (1960), starring Tin Tan, but she achieved stardom and gained international fame with her performance in Luis Alcoriza's Academy Award-nominated film, Tlayucan (1962), with Julio Aldama, Andr√©s Soler and No√© Murayama. Another one of her most famous films is Ruletero a toda marcha (1962), in which she played a single mother named Carmen and co-starred with Eulalio Gonz√°lez \\"El Piporro\\", Mar√≠a Duval and Sara Garc√≠a. On stage, she appeared in plays such as La tierra es redonda and Blum. Her final film was La rabia por dentro, co-starring English model June Wilkinson and Armando Silvestre. She was said to have been \\"extremely shy\\", and that is the reason why her mother and her brother V√≠ctor never noticed \\"the emotional lack of control\\" the actress was going through when she decided to commit suicide. According to her brothers statements, the actress \\"was as cheerful and content as ever\\" the night that she \\"announced her intentions to bathe\\" and locked herself in the bathroom and filled the tub. \\"Thirty or forty minutes passed\\", and since the actress was still in the bathroom, her mother and her brother became worried and knocked on the door. When they did not get a reply, they forced the door open and found the actress unconscious in the tub. She had swallowed twenty-five sleeping pills. She was taken immediately to the Hospital de la Raza, where she remained in a coma until she died of cardiac arrest on 30 December 1962 at 10:30 am. She was interred the next day in the actors' section of Mexico City's Pante√≥n Jard√≠n. In 1963, at the 1st Silver Goddess Awards, the actress was posthumously honored with the Best Actress accolade for her role in Tlayucan.

Ignite was open-sourced by GridGain Systems in late 2014 and accepted in the Apache Incubator program that same year. The Ignite project graduated on September 18, 2015. Apache Ignite's database utilizes RAM as the default storage and processing tier, thus, belonging to the class of in-memory computing platforms. The disk tier is optional but, once enabled, will hold the full data set whereas the memory tier will cache full or partial data set depending on its capacity. Regardless of the API used, data in Ignite is stored in the form of key-value pairs. The database component scales horizontally, distributing key-value pairs across the cluster in such a way that every node owns a portion of the overall data set. Data is rebalanced automatically whenever a node is added to or removed from the cluster. On top of its distributed foundation, Apache Ignite supports a variety of APIs including JCache-compliant key-value APIs, ANSI-99 SQL with joins, ACID transactions, as well as MapReduce like computations. Apache Ignite cluster can be deployed on-premise on a commodity hardware, in the cloud (e.g. Microsoft Azure, AWS, Google Compute Engine) or in a containerized and provisioning environments such as Kubernetes, Docker, Apache Mesos, VMWare.  Clustering  Apache Ignite clustering component is based on the shared nothing architecture. The nodes are divided into two main categories - server and client. Server nodes are storage and computational units of the cluster that hold both data and indexes and process incoming requests along with computations. Server nodes are also known as data nodes. Client nodes are connection points from applications and services to the distributed database represented as a cluster of server nodes. Client nodes are usually embedded in the application code written in Java, C# or C++ that have special libraries developed. Furthermore, Apache Ignite provides ODBC, JDBC and REST drivers as a way to work with the database from other programming languages or tools. The drivers utilize either client nodes or low-level socket connections internally in order to communicate to the cluster.  Partitioning and replication  Ignite database organizes data in the form of key-value pairs in distributed \\"caches\\" (the cache notion is used for historical reasons because initially, the database supported the memory tier). Generally, each cache represents one entity type such as an employee or organization. Every cache is split into a fixed set of \\"partitions\\" that are evenly distributed among cluster nodes using the rendezvous hashing algorithm. There is always one primary and zero or more backup copies of a partition. The number of copies is configured with a replication factor parameter. If the full replication mode is configured, then every cluster node will store a partition's copy. The partitions are rebalanced automatically if a node is added to or removed from the cluster in order to achieve an even data distribution and spread the workload. The key- value pairs are kept in the partitions. Apache Ignite maps a pair to a partition by taking the key's value and passing it to a special hash function.  Memory architecture  The memory architecture in Apache Ignite consists of two storage tiers and is called \\"durable memory\\". Internally, it uses paging for memory space management and data reference, similar to the virtual memory of systems like Unix. However, one significant difference between the durable and virtual memory architectures is that the former always keeps the whole data set with indexes on disk (assuming that the disk tier is enabled), while the virtual memory uses the disk when it runs out of RAM, for swapping purposes only. The first tier of the memory architecture, memory tier, keeps data and indexes in RAM out of Java heap in so-called \\"off-heap regions\\". The regions are preallocated and managed by the database on its own which prevents Java heap utilization for storage needs, as a result, helping to avoid long garbage collection pauses. The regions are split into pages of fixed size that store data, indexes, and system metadata. Apache Ignite is fully operational from the memory tier but it is always possible to use the second tier, disk tier, for the sake of durability. The database comes with its own native persistence and, plus, can use RDBMS, NoSQL or Hadoop databases as its disk tier.  Native persistence  Apache Ignite native persistence is a distributed and strongly consistent disk store that always holds a superset of data and indexes on disk. The memory tier will only cache as much data as it can depending on its capacity. For example, if there are 1000 entries and the memory tier can fit only 300 of them, then all 1000 will be stored on disk and only 300 will be cached in RAM. Persistence uses the write-ahead logging (WAL) technique for keeping immediate data modifications on disk. In the background, the store runs the \\"checkpointing process\\" which purpose is to copy dirty pages from the memory tier to the partition files. A dirty page is a page that is modified in memory with the modification recorded in WAL but not written to a respective partition file. The checkpointing allows removing outdated WAL segments over the time and reduces cluster restart time replaying only that part of WAL that has not been applied to the partition files.  Third-party persistence  The native persistence became available starting version 2.1. Before that Apache Ignite supported only third-party databases as its disk tier. Apache Ignite can be configured as the in-memory tier on top of RDBMS, NoSQL or Hadoop databases speeding up the latter. However, there are some limitations in comparison to the native persistence. For instance, SQL queries will be executed only on the data that is in RAM, thus, requiring to preload all the data set from disk to memory beforehand.  Swap space  When using pure memory storage, it is possible for the data size to exceed the physical RAM size, leading to OOMEs. To avoid this, the ideal approach would be to enable Ignite native persistence or use third-party persistence. However, if you do not want to use native or third-party persistence, you can enable swapping, in which case, Ignite in-memory data will be moved to the swap space located on disk. Note that Ignite does not provide its own implementation of swap space. Instead, it takes advantage of the swapping functionality provided by the operating system (OS). When swap space is enabled, Ignites stores data in memory mapped files (MMF) whose content will be swapped to disk by the OS depending on the current RAM consumption  Consistency  Apache Ignite is a strongly consistent platform that implements two-phase commit protocol. The consistency guarantees are met for both memory and disk tiers. Transactions in Apache Ignite are ACID-compliant and can span multiple cluster nodes and caches. The database supports pessimistic and optimistic concurrency modes, deadlock-free transactions and deadlock detection techniques. In the scenarios where transactional guarantees are optional, Apache Ignite allows executing queries in the atomic mode that provides better performance.  Distributed SQL  Apache Ignite can be accessed using SQL APIs exposed via JDBC and ODBC drivers, and native libraries developed for Java, C#, C++ programming languages. Both data manipulation and data definition languages' syntax complies with ANSI-99 specification. Being a distributed database, Apache Ignite supports both distributed collocated and non-collocated joins. When the data is collocated, joins are executed on the local data of cluster nodes avoiding data movement across the network. Non-collocated joins might move the data sets around the network in order to prepare a consistent result set.  Machine Learning  Apache Ignite provides machine learning training and inference functionality as well as data preprocessing and model quality estimation. It natively supports classical training algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, K-Means and others. In addition to that, Apache Ignite has a deep integration with TensorFlow. This integrations allows to train neural networks on a data stored in Apache Ignite in a single-node or distributed manner. The key idea of Apache Ignite Machine Learning toolkit is an ability to perform distributed training and inference instantly without massive data transmissions. It's based on MapReduce approach, resilient to node failures and data rebalances, allows to avoid data transfers and so that speed up preprocessing and model training.

The spree started on 25 September 2017 and in result 16 women were injured; none of them was robbed or killed by him. Attacks The stabber first injured three female citizens on 25 September. He then injured two more on 26 September, and another on 28 September. The affected area was said to be from Johar Chowrangi to Pehlwan Goth between Habib University and Rado Bakery, and the victims were brought to nearby hospital; Darus Sehat, Gulistan-e-Johar. On 4 October, five women were wounded in the areas from Gulshan-e-Jamal to Gulshan Chowrangi, within three hours. On 16 October, a girl was stabbed near Federal B. Area. Some women remained either untraceable, or were approached by the local police station, but they refused to file complaints. According to the information, 16 female citizens had fallen victim until. Perpetrator The attacks were done by the same person under same dressing. As reported by some victims and seen in CCTV footages, the suspect appears to be a thin man, with 5‚Ä≤ 7‚Äì9‚Ä≥ height and aged 20‚Äì29. He is clad, wearing black T-shirt and jeans with a bag. He rides a red motorcycle wearing a helmet, and attacks from behind a woman with his left hand using a sharp object and rides away. One of the victims saw him without wearing a helmet, who told he has curly hair and a light shave. He was also said to be suffering from psychological disorder. The CCTV clips were of poor- quality that they didn't aid in the investigation. The attacker's face and bike's number plate were extremely hard to figure out. All the survivors were \\"decently attired\\", so involvement of terrorists in the attacks is not suspected by the police. Aftermath These attacks spread panic and fear, forcing many women to stay in home. Soon, high alert security was sent to patrol the areas and investigate throughout. Following this, the female students at University of Karachi demanded additional security and consequently their attendance was low. They were advised to use point busses instead of using public transport, and the use of helmet was banned while riding a bike within the university premises. A police team too visited the university to validate reports of attacks on women campus, however, Vice Chancellor Prof. Dr. Muhammad Ajmal Khan rejected the reports. Reactions On 13 October, police produced Shahzad in the court, saying that he is close to the suspect. On 15 October, Sahiwal police arrested suspect Waseem from Mandi Bahauddin with the help of a team of Karachi police, who was said to be behind the similar knife attacks in Chichawatni area, where 50 women were injured within three years since 2013. Though, after another attack on 16 October in Karachi, it resulted in stating that he might not be involved in Karachi attacks as he never visited. So, Punjab police wanted to interrogate him for similar attacks in Sahiwal, Rawalpindi and Lahore. However, on 14 November, all five cases against Shahzad were closed and he was set free due to lack of evidence.

Sybil the nun At a date now unknown, Sybil became a professed nun of Amesbury Priory, a house of the Order of Fontesvraud. It is recorded that in 1391 her election as prioress was confirmed by the King, then Richard II.Houses of Benedictine nuns: Abbey, later priory, of Amesbury, in Ralph B.

A 1341 letter of the king to Amesbury Priory during the Hundred Years' War disputed some of the rights of the abbess and restricted others, In the light of this, when the prioress died about 1349 the nuns played safe and sought the king's licence to elect. This created a precedent for the future that was followed in 1391, as it had been also in 1379.H.F.

How long Sybil had been a nun before she was elected prioress is difficult to calculated. Some women of rank who became nuns had such status that they were elected when the earliest vacancy came about, but that might happen at greatly varying intervals, and only detailed research would show whether at various moments Sybil was the nun of the highest social rank, or the one whose family made the most significant benefactions to the monastery, or could reasonably be expected to do so or to wield influence with some other source of patronage, such as the King. It may be that she was elected simply on the grounds of her personality, piety or abilities. A Wayward Sibling A curiosity is that Sybil's own sister Katherine was also a nun,Nicolas Nicholas Harris, Testamenta vetusta, vol. 1, Nichols, London, 1826, p. 124. though of a rather turbulent kind, and in a different monastic house. Katherine had entered Bungay Priory in Suffolk, but at some point in 1376-1377 she absconded and was said to be \\"vagabond in secular attire in divers parts of the realm\\". While not the norm, absconding was not totally unknown for medieval English nuns.Eileen E. Power, Medieval English Nunneries c 1275 to 1535, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1922, pp. 442. In the absence of fuller specific information on her case, it is clear that while the nuns made a personal and public commitment to that life by a supposedly free choice, some of them may have been pressured by the family to enter the monastery, perhaps from dynastic or financial reasons. Others may have run away because they had become bored with the monotony of life, or exasperated by its austerity, or after having experienced personality conflicts, or psychological problems. Whatever its motive, Katherine's flight become the subject of a denunciation by the local bishop, the Bishop of Norwich, Henry le Despenser and of a consequent order from King Henry II for her capture and forcible return to her monastery.Eileen E. Power, Medieval English Nunneries c 1275 to 1535, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1922, pp. 442; Douglas Richardson, Magna Carta Ancestry: A Study in Colonial and Medieval Families, vol. 1, Everington, Salt Lake City, 2nd edition 2001, p. 157. If Katherine Montague had been a nun long enough to desert in 1376-1377, perhaps this should be taken as an indication that Sybil, too, may have been a nun for some time before her election in 1391. A Complicated Role Running a monastery in medieval England was a complicated business, given the administrative and economic responsibilities that were joined to spiritual duties. As a woman, Sybil would not be summoned to parliament as many of the male monastic superiors were.Martin Heale, The Abbots and Priors of Late Medieval and Reformation England, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2016, pp. 187ff. However, as Prioress she was under the authority of at least four powerful figures: the Pope, the King, the diocesan Bishop and the Abbess of Fontevraud. The latter, though resident on the Continent, had an agent resident in England, termed a procurator or proctor general, who at times travelled extensively across the country attending to the affairs of the Order.See the details regarding Grovebury Priory, where such a proctor general is known to have resided. Cf. Alien house: Priory of La Grave or Grovebury, in A History of the County of Bedford, vol. 1, London, 1904, pp. 403‚Äì404. British History Online http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/beds/vol1/pp403-404 [accessed 29 September 2017]. Moreover, in theory the houses of the Order of Fontevraud were unlike the average monastic communities in so far as in principle they had side by side a female house and a male house, all under the authority of the local prioress. The historical records regarding Amesbury Priory speak in the 14th century of a male house of 12 priests referred to as ‚Äòcanons‚Äô (i.e. canons regular). As to the female house, we learn that in 1317-1318, it contained no less than 117 nuns (perhaps including small numbers of lay sisters), though 36 new nuns were consecrated in 1327. These numbers are much reduced in 1381, with only 28 nuns, besides the prioress.Houses of Benedictine nuns: Abbey, later priory, of Amesbury, in Ralph B. Pugh & Elizabeth Crittall (edd.), A History of the County of Wiltshire, vol. 3, London, 1956, pp. 242-259. British History Online http://www.british- history.ac.uk/vch/wilts/vol3/pp242-259 [accessed 29 September 2017]. At the time of the Dissolution of the monasteries and the Priory's closure in 1539 there seem only to have been the prioress and 33 nuns.Houses of Benedictine nuns: Abbey, later priory, of Amesbury, in Ralph B. Pugh & Elizabeth Crittall (edd.), A History of the County of Wiltshire, vol. 3, London, 1956, pp. 242-259. British History Online http://www.british- history.ac.uk/vch/wilts/vol3/pp242-259 [accessed 29 September 2017]. Storms As the 14th century closed, Dame Sybil became embroiled in some notable events. Firstly, in May 1398, some 7 years after her election as prioress, an inquiry was ordered by the King into the government of the priory with a view to reforming it according to the ordinances and constitutions. Among other indications of indiscipline was the birth of a child in 1398 to a nun of Amesbury, Margaret Greenfield,Eileen E. Power, Medieval English Nunneries c 1275 to 1535, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1922, p. 455. but in general motives and outcome are unknown. It is known, however, that before January 1399 Dame Sybil showed a decisive temperament by having the elderly Prior Robert Daubeneye thrown out of the monastery. In the uproar of accusations and counter-accusations that followed, Dame Sybil emerges as high- handed and the mixed royal and ecclesiastical enquiries were favorable to the Prior and his reputation as a priest in good standing, though he was not reinstated but was ordered to receive a pension. However, on 14 March 1400 there was an astounding sequel when ruffians invaded the monastery after nightfall and Sybil some of the nuns were imprisoned for at least two days, the prioress was manhandled and perhaps the monastery's treasure was carried off. Upon her prompt complaint, Henry IV, crowned king on 13 October 1399, issued orders to officers of the crown to free the nuns and restore order, since ‚Äúevildoers of the town have taken and imprisoned‚Äù them.Caroline Dunn, Stolen Women in Medieval England: Rape, Abduction, and Adultery, 1100-1500, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2013, p. 167. The official investigations brought to light an attempt of Dame Sybil to pare down the number of canons from twelve to four, replacing them with secular priests.Douglas Richardson, Magna Carta Ancestry: A Study in Colonial and Medieval Families, vol. 1, Everington, Salt Lake City, 2nd edition 2001, p. 157; Gwen Seabourne, Imprisoning Medieval Women: The Non-Judicial Confinement and Abduction of Women in England, c. 1170-1509, Ashgate, Farnham, 2013, pp. 138-139; Caroline Dunn, Stolen Women in Medieval England: Rape, Abduction, and Adultery, 1100‚Äì1500, Cambridge University Press, 2015 (= Cambridge Studies in Medieval Life and Thought, Fourth Series 87). This was a delicate moment since in 1388 Richard II, to whom Sybil's male relatives were steadfastly loyal, had been deposed by Henry IV. Her brother John had been heavily caught up in resistance to the new king and was imprisoned by a mob at Cirencester and without trial beheaded on 7 January 1400, three months before the irruption at Amesbury. Those days were but a memory when Sybil's next storm arose, related perhaps to the long political and military struggles between the crowns of England and France. These meant a variety of problems for the so-called alien priories, that is, those monastic houses, usually small, that were dependencies of foreign, usually French, mother houses.Alison McHardy & Nicholas Orme. The Defence of an Alien Priory: Modbury (Devon) in the 1450s, in The Journal of Ecclesiastical History (1999) 303-312.) Only one of the difficulties was that communication with the mother house was often impossible and impolitick and as a result discipline at the English dependencies suffered. In 1378, all the monks in alien priories had been expelled from England and finally in 1414, under Henry V, those that remained were suppressed. The situation at Amesbury was not so drastic, partly because the house fell into a distinct subcategory of its kind since for a long time the head of the house, the prioress, had been elected by the nuns, by the king's leave and with his confirmation, rather than being appointed by the abbess of Fontevraud, their nominal monastic superior. It would seem, however, that Amesbury suffered the same systemic disciplinary problems as elsewhere. Over a decade after the earlier storm, the prioress launched an appeal to the King, claiming she had been evicted from the house and was afraid to enter it again. On 7 February 1415 King Henry V, in the presence of Henry Chichele, Archbishop of Canterbury, ordered that she receive \\"suitable sustenance for herself and her servants from the spiritual and temporal possessions belonging to the said priory of Amesbury\\" until a visitation of the house could be conducted by the Archbishop and the ills remedied.Malcolm Vale, Henry V: The Conscience of a King, Yale University Press, New Haven, 2016, p. 193. Again, the doughty Sybil survived and maintained her position as prioress. Final Years Though information on the outcome of various phases of these repeated investigations have not survived, she was to continue in as prioress for many years, dying only in 1420.Houses of Benedictine nuns: Abbey, later priory, of Amesbury, in Ralph B.

The story develops around Baba Yaga and Koschei, both villains in traditional Russian fairy tales (as well as the fairy tales of other Slavic countries). The film was produced by American film companies The Walt Disney Company CIS with Russian film companies Yellow, Black and White and Kinoslovo. Translation. The film stars Viktor Khorinyak, Mila Sivatskaya, Elena Yakovleva, Ekaterina Vilkova, Konstantin Lavronenko and Yevgeny Dyatlov. It was scheduled to have a wide release on October 26, 2017. As of November 26, 2017, the film became the highest-grossing local-language release of all time in Russia, surpassing Stalingrad with 1.68 billion rubles ($28.8 million) and topping out at $30.5 million. In Russia, the film holds the 12th place biggest box-office audiences. This was Disney Russia's second film produced specifically for the Russian market, with the first being The Book of Masters (2009). Plot The film opens with sorceress Varvara, princess of the fantasy world Belogorye (\\"The White Mountain\\"), hunting down who she claims to be the last Bogatyr in the world. She petrifies him and throws him into the sea, where hundreds of other victims rest. Ivan Naydenov is a young man living in modern Moscow, an orphan who managed to make his way in life by being a con artist: he masquerades as a \\"white mage\\", starring in rigged psychic contest shows and performing \\"rites\\" for clients. He starts having doubts about his selfish life choices, however, when asked to help a boy in a coma to wake up, which he obviously cannot do. One day, during a faulty escape from a client's husband, he miraculously ends up in Belogorye. This parallel world is inhabited by the characters of Russian fairy tales and magic is commonplace. Leshy appears to have dragged Ivan there, claiming that Ivan is the lost son of Ilya Muromets himself, hidden on Earth years ago. Ivan is then immediately captured by Varvara's warriors and brought before prince Dobrynya Nikitich. Dobrynya seems friendly at first, but Varvara soon throws Ivan into dungeon behind her husband's back. There, Ivan meets disembodied Koschei, who tells him that the only way to get back to Earth is by using the magical Sword Kladenets. He himself used it to achieve immortality, but Bogatyrs overthrew and imprisoned him thirty years prior. Since the forces of good have won, first most of the magical creatures were imprisoned or killed, and then Bogatyrs themselves. Provided Ivan is truly the son of Ilya, he can uncover the Sword and use it to bring the magical creatures back their power, and to return home. Baba Yaga is soon captured and thrown into the same dungeon, but it proves to be a trick: she brought along Vasilisa the Wise in frog form, who easily releases the prisoners. Despite Ivan being more of nuisance than any help, the three decide to take him with themselves and find the Sword together. Escaping the dungeon, they also enlist Vodyanoy the Merman, attracted to Baba Yaga (in her younger form, obviously). Koschei tells Ivan that Vasilisa helps them because her entire village was turned into frogs by jealous Varvara after she caught the eye of Dobrynya. Despite bonding with Vasilisa over the loss of their parents, Ivan still decides that he wishes to get home and not to stay with her. Varvara eventually captures the heroes, turns Vodyanoy into stone and forces Ivan to get the Sword for her, lest his friends are killed. Ivan does recover the Sword and overpowers his foes with it, but Koshei turns out to be in league with Varvara. Moreover, Dobrynya himself is revealed to be the mastermind of the whole scheme, planning to use the Sword to get the same kind of immortality as Koschei. Reasoning that he no longer needs his help, Dobrynya betrays Koschei, and Ivan uses the Sword to escape to Earth. Back in Moscow, he quickly realizes that he cannot abandon his beloved Vasilisa in trouble, and decides to get back. Upon finding Leshy, he returns to Belogorye, sets free Zmey Gorynych and uses a modern handgun to fight his way to Dobrynya. However, the latter has already completed the ritual and is now immortal, about to execute Vasilisa and Baba Yaga. Using Gorynych as distraction and cover, Ivan challenges Dobrynya to a fair duel, hoping to give his companions time to destroy the magical stone and therefore undo the Immortals' invulnerability. During the fight, Dobrynya reveals that it was his envy of Ilya that led to betrayal of bogatyrs. Koschei eventually gets his hands on the magical stone, and, touched by the selfless heroism of his companions, decides to shatter it, killing himself and Dobrynya. Varvara escapes Belogorye in horror, and her petrified victims come back to life, Ilya among them, reunited with his son now. Ivan decides to stay in Belogorye rather than return to the life of a fake \\"mage\\", marrying Vasilisa. The only thing he comes back into his world for is to use the real magic to help the comatose boy from the beginning of the film. The film ends with Varvara on Earth, meeting her mother. It is revealed that the two planned to enthrall Dobrynya and gain dominion over Belogorye, but with that plan failed, will now have to make a different move.

History  Vesyoly khutor was founded in 1845 by Cossacks from the village of Bagaevskaya. In this year, at the command of Ataman of Bagaevskaya, seven Cossacks were evicted with their families for rebelliousness, and this decision was approved by The Cossack Circle. The settlers were allocated a money share and began to build dugouts. From those seven dugouts, the history of khutor Vesyoly (originally known as Vesyolaya Semiizbyanka or Merry Seven Dugouts) began. According to 1915 data, the khutor at that time had 300 households and a population of 1998 residents. During Russian Civil War the area around khutor was a place of fierce fightings. By Spring of 1920, it was taken by forces of Red Army. In 1935 Vesyolovsky District of Rostov Oblast was established and Vesyoly became its administrative center.

The tomb is traditionally attributed to that of a Lahore resident named Buddhu, though research suggests the tomb was actually built for the wife of Khan-e-Dauran Bahadur Nusrat Jang. Some Sikhs regard the tomb to be a gurdwara built by Buddhu. Location The tomb is located alongside the Grand Trunk Road, east of the Walled City of Lahore. The tomb is situated across the GT Road from the University of Engineering and Technology. History The tomb was built around 1641, and is traditionally ascribed to be the tomb of Buddhu, son of Suddhu - a local brick maker who supplied bricks for several royal buildings in Lahore during the Shah Jahan period. Historical record suggests that the tomb was actually built for the wife of Khan-e-Dauran Bahadur Nusrat Jang - an amir of the Mughal royal court. The amir was himself was later buried in it following his death in 1643. In keeping with Mughal funerary tradition, the tomb was likely located in a garden which no longer survives. The site was used by Prince Sher Singh as his army's headquarters during his invasion of Lahore. Architecture Some of the tomb's exterior tile-work survives The base level of the tomb is square shaped, and has an doorway in each side. Each doorway is flanked by a small recessed arch. Atop the base is an octagonal layer upon which the tomb's prominent dome is placed, measuring 32 feet in diameter. The tomb is decorated with glazed blue and yellow tile-work, laid primarily in floral designs. The tomb's dome is decorated with blue tile-work in a chevron pattern. Associated legend The tomb has traditionally be ascribed to be the brick-kiln of Buddhu. Buddhu's servants are said to have refused Abdul Haq, a disciple of Mian Mir, from warming himself at the brick kiln. Haq cursed the kiln, leading to its eventual decline. Buddhu was forced to atone for his sin, but the insult was considered so great that the kiln remained out of service thereafter. A Sikh version of the legend asserts that Buddhu had refused to feed Bhai Kamliya, and was later cursed by him until Buddhu was able to repent to Guru Arjan before his business was restored. Sikhs assert that the tomb was actually built as part of a gurdwara. Conservation The site is protected by the Antiquities Act 1975. The site was partially restored in 2014 by Dr. Abdul Rehman, with support from an alumni fund for Fulbright scholars, and The United States Educational Foundation in Pakistan. Impact of Metro construction The monument is situated along the planned route of the Orange Line of the Lahore Metro. Heritage campaigners submitted a petition to the Lahore High Court as the planned metro line will pass close to Buddhu's Tomb, the Shalimar Gardens, and nine other sites in the city in violation of the Punjab Special Premises Ordinance, 1985 and Antiquity Act, 1975.

Television and film Roosevelt has been portrayed many times in film and on television. Karl Swenson played him twice: in a 1962 episode of The Virginian titled \\"Riff-Raff,\\" and in the 1967 western picture Brighty of the Grand Canyon, the story of a real-life burro who guided Roosevelt on a hunting trip to find mountain lions. Brian Keith played Roosevelt in the 1975 film The Wind and the Lion. He was also portrayed by actor Tom Berenger in 1997 for the TNT movie Rough Riders, a made-for-cable film about his exploits during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in Cuba. Frank Albertson played Roosevelt in the 1956 episode \\"Rough and Ready\\" of the CBS series My Friend Flicka.\\" Robert Vaughn portrayed a younger Roosevelt in the Law of the Plainsman 1959 episode, \\"The Dude.\\" He is portrayed by an unknown actor in the series Deadliest Warrior as a partaker in a fight against Lawrence of Arabia. Robin Williams portrayed Roosevelt in the form of a wax mannequin that comes to life in Night at the Museum and its sequels Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian and Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb. In the limited series adaptation of The Alienist, Roosevelt is portrayed by Brian Geraghty. Roosevelt, portrayed by Mike O'Connell, is a recurring character in the Comedy Central series Another Period. Roosevelt, as portrayed by Ed Metzger, briefly appears in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. The Roosevelt family was the subject of The Roosevelts, a documentary directed by Ken Burns. In 2015, Showtime began to develop a limited series based on the life of Roosevelt. In 2017, it was announced that Leonardo DiCaprio will portray Roosevelt in a biopic to be directed by Martin Scorsese. Through archive recordings, Roosevelt's voice is heard in Bart Stops to Smell the Roosevelts, an episode of The Simpsons. Other works In Don Rosa's comic book series The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck (1994‚Äì1996), Roosevelt meets and befriends Scrooge McDuck in 1882 when both were visiting the Dakota badlands and later again in 1902 at Fort Duckburg. In Don Rosa's story The Sharpie of the Culebra Cut (2001), collected in The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck Companion, they meet for the third time during the construction of the Panama Canal in 1906. Roosevelt is a prominent character in Harry Turtledove's Southern Victory series. In the Great War trilogy, which makes up part of the Southern Victory series, Roosevelt serves as the 28th President of the United States from 1913 to 1921 and leads the US to victory over the Confederated States of America. He was elected president as a Democrat in the 1912 election against Socialist Party candidate Eugene Debs. He defeated Debs again in 1916 and attempted to run for a third term in 1920, only to be defeated by Socialist candidate Upton Sinclair. He later died suddenly in 1924 of a cerebral hemorrhage while golfing. In the alternate history novel And Having Writ... by Donald R. Bensen (1978), Roosevelt was the first major world leader to get acquainted with the four aliens Raf, Ari, Valmis and Dark, and acts as a benevolent and friendly presence. He declines to run for a second full term in 1908 and is succeeded by Thomas Edison. In 1909, he helps the four aliens escape from house arrest (they had been place under house arrest by Edison so that he can pry technological secrets from them) in New York. In 1912, Roosevelt ends up seceding Edison, who declined to run for a second term due to him rather to go back to inventing. As with Grover Cleveland, he was counted twice in the numbering of the presidents: as the 26th president from 1901 to 1909 and the 28th president from 1913 to 1921. In 1925 while attending the demonstration of an experimental moon rocket, Roosevelt is killed when the device's engines exploded and destroyed the platform he was on. In the alternate history novel Back in the USSA by Eugene Byrne and Kim Newman (1997), Roosevelt wins the 1912 presidential election on the Progressive Party, only to be assassinated on December 19, 1912 at the Chicago Union Stockyards by the sharpshooter and exhibition shooter Annie Oakley, before he took office, when personally breaking a labor strike with the help of the Rough Riders. Following this, his running mate, Charles Foster Kane takes power, and gradually leads the United States into greater levels of oppression, class division and bureaucratic incompetence and corruption, which eventually leads to the Second American Civil War and Second American Revolution and the transformation of the United States into the United Socialist States of America. Roosevelt serves as the timelines equivalent of Russian Tsar Alexander II while Kane serves as the timelines equivalent of Nicholas II. Roosevelt appears in the Civilization video game series as a leader of the United States. In season five of Epic Rap Battles of History, Roosevelt appears in a rap battle against Winston Churchill. Roosevelt, in his career as New York City Police Commissioner, appears as a major character in the 1997 novel The Alienist, well as its sequel The Angel of Darkness.

Early life Priscilla Holmes Buell Drake was born in Ithaca, New York, on June 18, 1812. She was the youngest child of Judge Samuel/Salmon Buell (1764-1828) and Joanna Sturdevant, both of Cayuga County, New York. Judge Buell was a man of much intellectual vigor and marked attainments. He held several important offices in his State, and as senator served more than one term with De Witt Clinton, Martin Van Buren and others of distinction. Judge Buell moved with his family from New York to Marietta, Ohio, where he was held in great esteem. Career Drake and her husband worked with Robert Dale Owen during the Indiana Constitutional Convention of 1850 and 1851 to remove the legal disabilities of women. Before the sections were presented, which worked such benefit to women, they were discussed, line by line, in Drake's parlor. She had an acute legal mind, and Owen was not slow to recognize her valuable aid in the construction of the important clauses. It was she who suggested a memorial to Robert Dale Owen from the many noble mothers who comprehended the scope of his work for women. When Lucy Stone delivered her first lecture in Indianapolis, Drake was the only woman in attendance. She was also present at a notable meeting, shortly afterward, when Lucretia Mott presided. The acquaintance thus formed led to an interesting correspondence. Drake was in possession of main valuable letters from distinguished men and women, addressed to herself and husband. Personal life Priscilla Holmes Drake became the wife of James Perry Drake (1797-1876), a native of North Carolina, at Lawrenceburg, Indiana. He had held office under President Monroe and was then receiver of public moneys in Indianapolis, Indiana, appointed by President Jackson. While a resident of Posey County, Indiana, he had been brought into intimate business and social relations with the New Harmony Community, under the Rapps, father and son, and when their possessions were transferred to the Scotch philanthropist, Robert Owen, he naturally held the same relations with the Owen association. Those two communities, although striving in different ways to benefit humanity, had much to do with broadening his views and making his after-life tolerant and charitable, and probably had an influence in developing his young wife's interest in the laws relating to women. Their home was the center of happiness and progress, and it was only widening the circle of early associations to find therein a hearty welcome for David, Richard and Robert Dale Owen, the distinguished soils of Robert Owen. In 1861 they moved to Alabama, near Huntsville, where they continued their interest and work in the cause of woman's suffrage. Drake was left a widow in 1876 and died at her residence, on February 11, 1892, and is buried at Maple Hill Cemetery (Huntsville, Alabama). She was the mother of seven children, among whom Annie Buell Drake Robertson (1841-1930), four of whom survived her.

During the Nazi years he became a resistance activist and political exile.  Life   Early years  Walter Max Fabian was born in Berlin. Richard Fabian, his father, was a self-employed interior architect who would have much preferred to be a musician. Visitors to the house included Bruno Walter. Powerfully progressive political currents in the family home came primarily from his mother, born Else Hosch. The Fabians' social circle also included leftwing intellectual heavyweights such as Hugo Haase and Kurt Rosenfeld. He attended what was then the Mommsen Gymnasium (secondary school) in Berlin's Charlottenburg quarter. He was not quite twelve when war broke out, and by the time he left school he was already a vocal backer of those calling for peace.  Weimar Germany  After leaving school he went on to study Philosophy, Pedagogy, History and Economics at Berlin, Freiburg iB., Gie√üen and Leipzig. In 1924 he concluded his studies with a doctoral dissertation on the philosopher Friedrich Wilhelm Foerster, entitled \\"Das Problem der Autorit√§t bei Friedrich Wilhelm Foerster\\". He had been contributing to SPD newspapers since 1920. After receiving his doctorate he became a committed member of the German Peace Society (\\"Deutsche Friedensgesellschaft\\" / DFG) and of the Association of Committed School Reformers (\\"Bund Entschiedener Schulreformer\\" /BESch). In addition he joined the Saxony branch of the Social Democratic Party (\\"Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / SPD) itself. It was also in 1924 that he married the brilliant author-journalist Dora Fabian. The marriage, described by one thoughtful writer as \\"brief but friendly\\", would be over by the time of Dora's death in London, under circumstances that have never been entirely clear, during the early summer of 1935. In 1924 he also became an editor at the Ernst-Oldenburg Verlag (publisher) at Leipzig, supporting the party's educational work. The next year he took on the responsibilities of political editor with the party newspaper, \\"Chemnitzer Volksstimme\\". Unlike Dresden, the home of the Royal Saxon Court and Saxony's traditional administrative capital, he saw Chemnitz as a workers' city, without the liberal intellectual pretensions of Leipzig, but rather Saxony's equivalent to the Manchester of a few decades earlier, when Engels undertook his socio-political researches in England's cotton capital. He perceived Chemnitz as a more appropriate fulcrum for his own interests in the promotion of the labour movement and pacificst politics. In Chemnitz Fabian also became a member of the SPD's regional party executive. Additionally, from 1928 he was producing two Dresden based SPD opposition news sheets, \\"Sachsendienst\\" and \\"Sozialistische Information\\". He used these \\"pulpits\\" to attack the Coalition Chancellor, Hermann M√ºller, over the government re-armament programme, producing slogans such as \\"school meals before battle ships\\" (\\"Schulspeisung statt Panzerkreuzer\\"). (Hermann M√ºller was, like Fabian a member of the SPD.) Fabian had relocated to Dresden in 1928. There he was increasingly in demand as a lecturer and speaker, notably among the city's Young Socialists. His uncompromising pacifism and his talent for public speaking meant he was always seen as a leftwing comrade within the party, and viewed with suspicion by many in the party hierarchy. He also attracted a growing band of mostly young leftwing followers from inside the party. In the end the leadership lost patience. He was subjected to a \\"speaking ban\\" at the end of 1930, and in September 1931 he was excluded from the SPD. Along with around 1,000 Young Socialists in Saxony, Walter Fabian now joined the Socialist Workers' Party (\\"Sozialistische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands\\" / SAPD) launched, formally, shortly afterwards. Both the Communist Party and the SPD had, by the later 1920s, become increasingly shrill in their mutual antagonism and contempt, to the point where by 1931 both party leaderships had expelled large numbers of their \\"extremist\\" members. Meanwhile, the seemingly unstoppable rise of populism persuaded many of the expelled party members, (as well as some of the more thoughtful party activists who had not been expelled) that the only way to avert a Nazi government was for the political left to unite in opposition to the Nazi tide. The SAPD was born of that conviction even though, with the benefit of hindsight, its emergence is frequently seen simply as a further example of the way the Nazis were able to encourage and exacerbate fragmentation of Germany's political left during the run-up to their own successful power-grab. Within the SAPD Walter Fabian was elected regional chair for East Saxony. Then, in March 1932 at the party's launch conference in Berlin, he was elected to the party national executive. Despite being set up as a national party, the SAPD in reality depended on two regional power bases. Due in part to the reputation and actions of Walter Fabian, one of these was East Saxony. The other, also a major industrial region (and also an area where the Nazis enjoyed strong support), was in the western part of Silesia, in and around Bresalau (as Wroc≈Çaw was then known). Fabain and August Enderle set about creating a party newspaper: the \\"Sozialistischen Arbeiter-Zeitung\\" (SAZ) was launched in September 1932 with Walter Fabian its editor-in-chief. The first few editions were produced in Berlin after which the SAZ operation was transferred to Breslau.  Nazi Germany  At the second general election of 1932, in November, the \\"Nazi\\" vote share fell back from 37% to 33% suggesting that, under the democratic procedures then in place, the Nazi wave might have peaked. Nevertheless, the combined vote share of the Nazis and Communists ensured that the Reichstag remained deadlocked, with no obvious way that any coalition could emerge with sufficient parliamentary backing to support a stable government. Despite the parliamentary stalemate, however, following deft political machinations the Nazis, with the conditional agreement of President Hindenburg, took power at the end of January 1933 and lost no time in transforming Germany into a one-party dictatorship. Many on the left remained confident that the \\"terrorist government\\" launched at the end of January 1933, though tolerated or in some cases supported by other \\"conservative\\" forces, would be short-lived. However, Fabian calculated that it would be foolish to place much confidence in the prospect of a rapid collapse of the Nazi r√©gime. Although political activity was not actually banned until March 1933, the broad ground rules for the government's approach to political opposition were already on display by the end of January. He moved from Breslau to Berlin where, using the name Kurt Sachs, he managed to live in \\"relative anonymity\\" and continue with his (now illegal) political activities. Meanwhile, Dora Fabian, who had been campaigning alongside her husband for a united left to confront the Nazi menace since at least as far back as 1931, despaired of the continuing bickering between the leftwing political forces and resigned from the SAPD during the first few weeks of 1933. She was arrested in Berlin in March 1933, but released a few days later. Her belief that plans existed for her imminent re-arrest was almost certainly correct, and her decision to forestall re-arrest by escaping to Prague well founded. By September 1933 she had ended up in London. At a clandestine \\"party conference\\" in March 1933 Walter Fabian was re-elected to the SAPD party executive. By 1934, many party comrades, having been arrested, he had emerged as leader in Germany of the underground party. He succeeded in continuing to live in anonymity, as far as the authorities were concerned, and during that year he travelled regularly between Berlin and Paris which, together with Moscow, was becoming the destination of choice for Germany's exiled opposition politicians. It was also during this period that Fabian began a long period of political cooperation with the man who later became the SAPD's most famous member, Willy Brandt.  Paris exile  In January 1935 Fabian was lucky to avoid arrest after a party comrade passed him a message that, under torture, the comrade had found himself unable to remain silent as to Fabian's whereabouts and false identity. Unable to return to his own apartment, he managed to avoid the Gestapo and a few days later crossed the snow-covered mountains into Czechoslovakia, still, at this point, an independent country. He was accompanied by his second wife, Ruth. They made their way to Prague and from there, via Austria and Switzerland, to Paris, where by now the SAPD had established their exiled leadership team which Walter joined. Ruth also worked with the party and during 1935 was deprived, in her absence, of her German citizenship by the government back in Berlin. It not clear why Walter Fabian suffered the same sanction only on 5 August 1937. In Paris he was involved, above all, in the party's press section. As part of this he set up the SAPD's \\"Documentation Office\\" which gathered, collated and collected helpful cuttings from newspapers. As a member of the leadership of an illegal (in Germany) opposition party exiled in Paris, Walter Fabian was also part of the antifascist \\"Lutatia Circle\\" (named after the Paris hotel where they held their meetings). This was the context within which, in 1936, he was one of a number of prominent socialists, inspired by the French prime minister L√©on Blum, who tried to put together a German Popular Front (in exile) in order more effectively to oppose the Nazis. Others involved included Heinrich Mann, Rudolf Breitscheid and Willi M√ºnzenberg. The idea came to nothing, however. Meanwhile, the exiled leadership of the SAPD, by now headed up by Jacob Walcher, was moving decisively to the political left and, possibly more importantly, to a pro-Stalin line, taking their lead from the Soviet Communist Party in Moscow where Stalin was embarking on an industrial scale purge of his political opponents, whether actual, potential or merely suspected. Walter Fabian was still contributing as a journalist in the German language news publications produced in Paris, and as stories seeped out about the developments in Moscow he was disinclined to avoid reporting them. He also wrote critically about Moscow's attacks on the POUM (\\"Partido Obrero de Unificaci√≥n Marxista\\"), a Spanish Marxist party and quasi-military movement that came to prominence in the Spanish Civil War and, having fallen foul of Stalin, saw several of its leaders tortured and/or killed by emissaries sent from Moscow. Because of his criticism, in 1937 Fabian was expelled from the SAPD. It was the second time in five years that he had been expelled from a political party, and for the rest of his life he avoided further membership of any party. He did, however, form a \\"resistance group\\" under the title \\"Neuer Weg\\" (\\"New Way\\"), and devoted himself to producing the movement's eponymous news-magazine. Others involved in \\"Neuer Weg\\" included Peter Blachstein and Erwin Ackerknecht, two former SAPD comrades who had been expelled from the party at the same time as Fabian.  War years  The Germany army invaded Poland in September 1939: The French and British governments responded by declaring war on Germany a few days later, although military assistance to Poland was not significant. For most of the residents of Paris and London there was little immediate impact before May 1940 when the Germany army invaded France. By that time thousands of people who had been forced to escape from Germany to Paris for reasons of political activism and/or race had been identified as enemy aliens and arrested. (Similar steps were taken by the London government.) Walter and Ruth Fabian were briefly held in Paris and then moved to a detention centre at Marolles, a run down village near Blois. Walter Fabian was able to use his time here to read Nausea, a prescient and subsequently well regarded novel by a then little known novelist called Jean- Paul Sartre. He was also able to produce a few articles for newspapers in Switzerland. Some 25,000 German and Austrian political internees were by now being transferred to vast internment camps in the southwest of the country. In order to avoid that fate Walter Fabian volunteered for service in the French Foreign Legion at the start of January 1940, which involved service in North Africa. Ruth seems to have returned briefly to Paris where Annette, the couple's daughter, was born early in March 1940. She then headed back south with her baby and settled in the \\"Free zone\\", administered from Vichy by a puppet government and still, at this stage, permitted a significant measure of autonomy by the Germans. His commitment to pacifism and his intellectual approach meant that Walter Fabian was very far from being an ideal recruit for the Foreign Legion. In the end he spent three months imprisoned in a \\"military library\\": he later spent two months in a \\"small hospital\\". There was plenty of time for reading and writing. He wrote - according to his own recollections 40 years later - \\"hundreds of letters to Ruth and to his friends\\", and also kept a diary. However, his unsuitability for military service having been conclusively demonstrated, Ruth Fabian was able to extract her husband from the French Foreign Legion by the end of the year. He returned from North Africa, disembarking at Marseilles on 8 December 1940. During 1941/42 the Fabians worked in Marseilles and in Aix-en-Provence with the Emergency Rescue Committee set up by Varian Fry on the initiative, some said, of Eleanor Roosevelt. The work, apparently unpaid, involved organising emigration from France to the United States of America for refugees from Nazi persecution. Jewish sources stress the extent to which those rescued were Jews while leftwing political sources stress they extent to which they were political refugees. Many, like Walter Fabian himself, were both, but those charged with prioritising whom to help first always insisted that the only criterion was the extent of the danger which each individual would be in so long as he or she remained in Europe. Organising entry visas for the United States, transit visas for Spain and Portugal and - often most difficult of all to obtain - French exit visas was hugely time consuming, especially because victims of Nazi persecution often arrived in Marseilles without identity papers. From his own diary it appears that as early as December 1940 Walter Fabian received notification that the family's own tickets from Lisbon to New York were \\"paid for\\", but in February 1941, still in Marseilles, he received a letter from his father's old friend, Kurt Rosenfeld now in New York, warning that there was hardly any work for German emigrants arriving stateside. It is not clear whether Fabian himself ever seriously considered moving to America. The family settled in southern France. Ruth, once a junior lawyer in Berlin, now earned money by teaching German to French school children. Walter Fabian combined journalism with his other activities but money was short. He undertook writing and translating contracts for publishers in the US and in Switzerland. There was talk of taking a job selling lottery tickets in the local library and there were times when, reportedly, he seriously considered volunteering for a return to North Africa and service in the French army. Meanwhile, the Germans were progressively tightening their grip on the \\"Free zone\\". The police - with honourable exceptions - were increasingly operating according to instructions received from the Gestapo: Gestapo officers were a growing presence on the city streets. Obtaining French exit visas for refugees seeking to emigrate across the Atlantic was becoming harder. Acting on the instructions of the Gestapo, during the Summer of 1942 the French police closed down the escape programme operated by Varian Fry's Emergency Rescue Committee out of Marseilles. As Jewish socialists the Fabians were doubly at risk from the Nazi persecution programme. As the risk of arrest and internment (and, from 1942, deportation to a death camp in Germany) intensified, they undertook a dramatic escape to Switzerland in October 1942.  Sanctuary in Switzerland  Through his international journalistic contacts Walter Fabian already had contacts in Switzerland. Nevertheless, it is possible that he was only on account of his daughter that he was permitted to cross the frontier into the country. According to a rule provided by the Swiss Justice and Police department and dated 18 June 1940, \\"fleeing civilians [were] to be turned back with the exception of women and children up to 16\\". Nevertheless, all three of them were able to cross the border, and after brief internment in a transit camp near Geneva they were placed in a refugee camp at Adliswil, just outside Z√ºrich. Conditions in the refugee camp were poor, and it was only with help from the local religious community that Fabian was able to extricate his family from the place, after he had written a letter pleading for help to the Swiss education reformer, Elisabeth Rotten. It was in Adliswil that the marriage between Walter and Ruth Fabian broke apart. Walter Fabian relocated up the road to Z√ºrich at the start of 1943 and relaunched his journalistic career. He and Ruth would remain lifelong friends. A brief tempestuous marriage to Charlotte \\"Carlotta\\" Gries appears to have been over by March 1944 (according to a diary entry) although a formal break was deferred to 1947. Meanwhile, Switzerland itself still felt under dire threat of a German invasion, at least until the destructive extent to the German military machine had been subjected in the decisive Battle of Stalingrad became apparent during the course of 1943. Walter Fabian was initially banned from writing for the Swiss press as the authorities in Bern sought to avoid antagonising the northern neighbour. However, with the help of Walter B√∂sch, a senior editor at the Z√ºrcher Tagesanzeiger (newspaper), he was able to work both as a translator and as an author under the pseudonym \\"Theo Prax\\" (a conscious contraction of the words \\"Theorie\\" and \\"Praxis\\"). He also embarked on a parallel career as a translator of French literature, with translations of works by Victor Hugo, Charles Baudelaire, Romain Rolland, Fran√ßois Mauriac and Eugen Tarle to his credit. In Switzerland he also worked at one point as a music critic. He was an active member of the exiled German PEN International group and of the Society of the protection of German authors (\\"Schutzverband deutscher Schriftsteller\\" / SDS). At one point he led the SDS group in Switzerland, focusing his efforts on trades union training and the refugee organisation \\"ProAsyl\\".  Return to (West) Germany  War for Germany ended in May 1945. In 1947 his comrade of old, Peter Blachstein, came to visit Fabian in Switzerland. Blachstein, as he later wrote, had always thought that Walter Fabian would return to Germany as soon as possible, and greatly regretted that his old friend chose to live in Switzerland till 1957. However, Fabian was by this time well settled in Switzerland, and not at all convinced that democracy imposed by \\"the bayonets of occupying armies\\" or the events unfolding in the Soviet occupation zone were taking his home country in a positive direction. According to one source, at the heart of Fabian's hesitation about returning home was Marx's precept \\"Liberation of the working class can only be achieved through the efforts of the working class\\" (\\"Die Befreiung der Arbeiterklasse kann nur das Werk der Arbeiterklasse selbst sein!\\"). In postwar Germany the focus was on survival, and then on reconstruction, rather than on the unfolding of a Marxist socio-political trajectory. Fabian received and repeatedly turned down a succession of apparently attractive job offers from Germany. On 8 October 1946 he rejected an offer from the former head of the socialist regional government in Saxony of 1923, Erich Zeigner, whom the Soviets had now appointed Lord Mayor of Leipzig. Zeigner wanted him to become editor in chief of the mass-circulation Leipziger Volkszeitung (newspaper). Fabian also turned down an offer from the US occupation zone to take over the editorship of the Frankfurter Rundschau from Emil Carlebach whose publisher's license was revoked by the US military administration for what were described at the time as unexplained reasons. (However, Carlesbach was a Communist Party member.) Fabian turned down a job offer from Radio Bremen in 1951 and, at the start of 1956, a job as political editor with Norddeutscher Rundfunk. Walter Fabian's first visit to postwar Germany took place only on 10 October 1949. When he finally settled in West Germany in 1957, he did so without giving up his right of abode in Switzerland. During the 1940s and 1950s he had built up excellent contacts with the Swiss trades union movement, and this opened the door to the German Trade Union Confederation (\\"Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund\\" / DGB) which emerged after 1949 and the lifting of the Nazi ban on trades union activity. In 1957, at the instigation of Otto Brenner, Walter Fabian was appointed editor in chief of the DGB's Gewerkschaftliche Monatshefte (\\"Trades Union Monthly\\"/ GMH) publication, a role which he held till 1970. Between 1958 and 1964 he also chaired the Deutsche Journalistinnen- und Journalisten-Union (Journalists' Union). Working with the DGB came with its own challenges. The SAPD had lost its principal purpose after 1945 and most of its former members had switched to the more mainstream SPD: Walter Fabian had not. He remained true to his left wing \\"Luxemburgisch\\" convictions and rejected union attempts to pressure the \\"Gewerkschaftliche Monatshefte\\" into always backing the union line. It was as a result of continuing differences of approach that in 1970 Heinz Oskar Vetter, recently elected to chair the DGB, relieved Fabian of his responsibilities at the journal after thirteen years. Since returning in 1957 Walter Fabian had engaged in the West German peace movement. He spoke out against the Viet Nam War, in support of rapprochement with Poland and in opposition to the various Emergency Powers Acts. After his work on the GMH ended he became a leading figure in the German Humanist Union, which he chaired from 1969 till 1973, and of the West German German-Polish Society (of which he became honorary president in 1977). In 1966 he also accepted an honorary professorship in Pedagogy from Frankfurt University.  Awards and honours  * In 1970 Walter Fabian was a winner of the Carl von Ossietzky Medal from the International League for Human Rights. * In 1991 he received a special honour from the prize committee of the Bert Donnep Prize, awarded by the Grimme Institute.

It is administered by the Masalembu Subdistrict of the Sumenep Regency which is centered on the island of Madura and is made up of two administrative villages of Sukajeruk and Massalima. Geography The island measures about 7 km west-east and 6 km north-south, with a total land area of 23.86 square kilometers. It is located halfway between Borneo and the island of Madura, with a distance of about 150 km from either. It is largely flat, with the highest elevation reaching 12 meters above sea level. The interior of the island has largely been taken over by local agriculture. The island has no natural surface freshwater sources and is reliant on groundwater. Demographics 18,485 individuals (Statistics Indonesia, 2015 estimate) live on the island in 9,158 households, and the population has a sex ratio of 98.19. Administratively, the locals live in two villages of Massalima (pop. 10,325) and Sukajeruk (pop. 8,160), although the main settlement on the island lies across the two's administrative boundaries. Economy Fisheries employ a workforce of about 3,100 and agriculture employs about 1,800. Coconuts and corn are the primary crops taking up most of the island's land, with an assortment of vegetables being cultivated as well. Electricity on the island is supplied by diesel generators. 290 families are classified as poor families (i.e. incapable of fulfilling basic needs). Facilities State- funded public schools and madrasas are present on the island, providing elementary and high school level education (SD, SMP, and SMA). The only puskesmas of the subdistrict is also located on the island. The island is mainly accessible by boat and ship, requiring a 12-hour trip from Sumenep. Boats also provide transportation to other islands in the subdistrict such as Karamian and Masakambing. A government-subsidized pioneer ship service carries passengers and various goods in and out of the island, although service interruptions happen occasionally. An airfield is currently under the process of construction on the southern part of the island, with plans for routine service to and from Trunojoyo Airport in Sumenep.

The award announcement acknowledged the fact that \\"the world's nine nuclear-armed powers and their allies\\" neither signed nor supported the treaty-based prohibition known as the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons or nuclear ban treaty, yet in an interview Committee Chair Berit Reiss-Andersen told reporters that the award was intended to give \\"encouragement to all players in the field\\" to disarm. The award was hailed by civil society as well as governmental and intergovernmental representatives who support the nuclear ban treaty, but drew criticism from those opposed. At the Nobel Peace Prize award ceremony held in Oslo City Hall on December 10, 2017, Setsuko Thurlow, an 85-year-old survivor of the 1945 atomic bombing of Hiroshima, and ICAN Executive Director Beatrice Fihn jointly received a medal and diploma of the award on behalf of ICAN and delivered the Nobel lecture. Award A global civil society coalition of 468 peace, human rights, environment, development and faith groups as of 2017, ICAN was recognized for its decade-long consensus-building support for the Humanitarian Pledge and the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Nobel Committee Chair Berit Reiss-Andersen described ICAN's work as having \\"brought the debate forward by focusing so heavily on the humanitarian consequences of using nuclear arms.\\" The Peace Prize announcement came in the midst of the 2017 North Korea crisis, uncertainty over certification of Iran's compliance with the 2015 accord that limits Iran's nuclear program, the Doomsday Clock assessment in January 2017 of the highest threat of nuclear war since 1953, heightened rhetoric between Indian and Pakistani military officials to target each other and retaliate with the early use nuclear weapons, Russia's strategic doctrine calling for early use of nuclear weapons against any \\"major NATO assault\\" on its territory, and opposition by nuclear powers to the nuclear ban treaty and its ratification. In a telephone interview immediately after the announcement, ICAN Executive Director Beatrice Fihn said that, the Cold War being long over, possession and use of weapons of mass destruction \\"is no longer acceptable\\" in the 21st century. In a formal statement, ICAN called the 2017 prize a tribute to \\"the tireless efforts of many millions of campaigners and concerned citizens worldwide who, ever since the dawn of the atomic age, have loudly protested nuclear weapons\\" and to \\"the survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki‚Äîthe hibakusha‚Äîand victims of nuclear test explosions\\". Holding a press conference at UN Headquarters, in New York, the ICAN executive director said that disarmament campaign efforts of a \\"new generation,\\" of \\"people who grew up after the Cold War and don't understand why we still have the [nuclear] weapons,\\" were in effect also being recognized by the award. Nominations for the prize numbered 318, including 215 individuals and 103 organizations, second highest to the record 376 nominations considered in 2016. Though the Nobel Committee does not release names being considered for 50 years, reportedly they included: Tong Jen and Onodera Toshitaki seeking justice for Chinese victims of wartime atrocities during World War II; organizers Iran Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini of the 2015 Iran Deal negotiations; UNHCR and High Commissioner Filippo Grandi for their work on the rights and dignity of refugees; Turkish journalists Cumhuriyet and Can D√ºndar; The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) for their work securing Gambia's political transition; and the humanitarian White Helmets, also known as the Syrian Civil Defense, and Raed al Saleh. Congratulatory reactions Congratulatory messages in the days following the award announcement came from individual disarmament supporters as well as ICAN coalition organizations, other civil society groups, public figures, governments and the United Nations, including: survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings (hibakusha), The ATOM Project, Peace Boat, Nuclear Threat Initiative, Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, Human Rights Watch, Oxfam, Ploughshares Fund, Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, Germany, EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, UK Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas, Austria, Canada's New Democratic Party Critic for Foreign Affairs H√©l√®ne Laverdi√®re, Mexico, and Nigeria. Twenty- three countries included congratulatory remarks in their statements at the UN General Assembly First Committee on Disarmament and International Security, including Sweden and New Zealand. Pugwash President Sergio Duarte wrote that the award designation reflects \\"growing public recognition\\" of banning nuclear weapons as part of the international humanitarian norm to abolish weapons of mass destruction, citing examples of the abolition of bacteriological weapons in the 1970s and chemical weapons in the 1990s. He also called on State parties to make further progress at the UN High Level Conference on Nuclear Disarmament slated for 2018, noting the role of civil society organizations such as ICAN in supporting such multilateral disarmament processes. UN Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres relayed in a press statement that the award \\"recognizes the determined efforts of civil society to highlight the unconscionable humanitarian and environmental consequences that would result if they [nuclear weapons] were ever used again,\\" noting that the first UN General Assembly resolution, in 1946, had \\"established the goal of ridding the world of nuclear weapons and all weapons of mass destruction.\\" The UN's top disarmament official Izumi Nakamitsu in a statement said that the 2017 Peace Prize \\"recognizes once again the vital and indispensable role of civil society in advancing our common aspirations peace, security and a world free of nuclear weapons.\\" Former Soviet Union President Mikhail Gorbachev in a statement said the award designation was \\"a very good decision\\" and signified that \\"a world without nuclear weapons‚Äîthere cannot be any other goal!\\", also recalling a joint statement with then US President Ronald Reagan at the 1986 Reykjavik Summit that \\"a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.\\" Welcoming the implications of the Peace Prize announcement in an interview with RT, \\"whistleblower\\" William McNeilly defended his WikiLeaked report in 2015 that claimed Trident nuclear programme safety and security failures and that sparked nuclear-deterrent debates in the UK the same year. New Zealand's Green Party Spokesperson for Social Development, MP Jan Logie, said that \\"Our Pacific Ocean and its peoples have suffered the terrible effects of nuclear explosions and today we acknowledge the survivors of nuclear weapons use and testing. This Nobel Prize honours them.\\" Aging survivors of the 1945 Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombings, known as hibakusha, have long campaigned to abolish nuclear weapons, often recounting the horrific suffering they endured and from which many more died. At gatherings to watch the broadcast Peace Prize announcement and in other press interviews, their reactions included: * Toshiyuki Mimaki, 75, of the Hiroshima Prefectural Confederation of A-Bomb Sufferers Organizations: \\"The young people's activities have been recognized.\\" * Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Survivors Council members, with a photograph of Sumiteru Taniguchi, who died in August 2017 at the age of 88, said it gave them new motivation to continue their work. * Terumi Tanaka, former secretary- general of Nihon Hidankyo: \\"We told the world about the inhumanity (of nuclear weapons). We laid the foundations for ICAN to do its work.\\" Toshiki Fujimori, assistant secretary-general of the group, expressed hope that the award would \\"speed up the flow of countries joining the treaty.\\" * Peace Boat founder Tatsuya Yoshioka said the award \\"has the same value as if it were given to every hibakusha.\\" * Separately, the older brother of iconic Sadako Sasaki said he felt a sense of pride. * Masahiro Sasaki, 76: \\"It's wonderful that these low-profile, often unseen activities have been recognized.\\" * Sunao Tsuboi, 92: \\"Together with ICAN and many other people, we hibakusha will continue to seek a world without nuclear weapons as long as our lives last.\\" * Shigemitsu Tanaka, head of the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Survivors Council: \\"We want to take great delight as it helped build up a treaty banning nuclear weapons. We want to work together so that the nuclear disarmament treaty can be signed as soon as possible.\\" Speaking at Bowling Green University with fellow Hiroshima bombing survivor Keiko Ogura, who founded Hiroshima Interpreters for Peace, Setsuko Thurlow likened ICAN's work to other social movements eventually embraced by nations, saying \\"it is our moral imperative to abolish nuclear weapons\\" and that the Peace Prize for ICAN \\"represents a break from the typical state perspective.\\" Supporters from faith communities issued congratulatory statements, including: the Dalai Lama, Daisaku Ikeda, Father Shay Cullen, the Holy See, Pax Christi International, and the World Council of Churches. Critical reactions While the majority of reactions from the international community hailed the Nobel Committee's decision, other reactions were critical about the announcement's implications. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said that NATO has in common with ICAN the goal of \\"preserving peace and creating the conditions for a world without nuclear weapons\\" and welcomes the attention drawn by the award announcement to nuclear non-proliferation issues, but that the nuclear ban treaty supported by ICAN \\"risks undermining the progress we have made over the years,\\" citing the existence of nuclear arms as the reason to maintain nuclear arsenals and for NATO remaining a nuclear alliance since the Cold War. In a press release Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg praised ICAN for promoting their common goal of a world free of nuclear weapons but reiterated that Norway will not sign the ban treaty, echoing NATO's stance. Similarly, spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters that the Kremlin believes the award decision should be respected and that Russia as a member of the nuclear club both supports nuclear non-proliferation and maintains its position expressed by President Vladimir Putin that \\"there is no alternative to nuclear parity\\" in global security measures. The government of Australia as of October 9, 2017 did not comment on the award designation but, through its spokesperson, acknowledged \\"the commitment of ICAN and its supporters to promoting awareness of the humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons\\" and restated the government's position that \\"so long as the threat of nuclear attack exists, US extended deterrence will serve Australia's fundamental national security interests.\\" The USA reacted by saying in its statement that the award announcement \\"does not change the U.S. position on the treaty\\" which in its view \\"risks undermining existing efforts to address global proliferation and security challenges,\\" and that \\"no state possessing nuclear weapons or which depends upon such weapons for its security supports\\" the ban treaty. When asked to clarify whether Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau wanted to congratulate ICAN, the prime minister's office did not respond, though in a June 2017 statement Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland's press secretary said that \\"Canada remains firmly committed to concrete steps towards global nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation.\\" Commentaries The Economist questioned the appropriateness of ICAN's winning of the prize, arguing it was doubtful their nuclear-ban treaty effort would do anything to advance global peace due to its rejection by the world's nuclear powers. Award funding On October 20, 2017, Euronews reported that, through research with German broadcaster ZDF into Nobel Prize Foundation index funds investments, German campaign group Facing Finance had determined that the Peace Prize award was funded in part by Foundation investments in companies contributing to nuclear weapons programs, including Textron, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, and urged ICAN not to accept the 9 million SEK award money. According to Agence France-Presse, the head of the Nobel Institute Olav Njolstad was confronted on October 26, 2017 with the revelation confirmed by environmental group The Future in Our Hands, and Foundation director Lars Heikensten said the following day that \\"[a]t the latest, by March next year [2018] we will have no investment in anything that is connected with any kind of production which is classified as connected with nuclear weapons.\\" Award ceremony A day ahead of the December 10th award ceremony at Oslo City Hall, ICAN installed outside the Norwegian Parliament building 1,000 red and blue paper cranes made by children in Hiroshima. Past Award recognition of disarmament efforts After the first wartime use of nuclear weapons, in 1946, the Peace Prize began to recognize nuclear disarmament efforts: * (1959) Philip Noel-Baker * (1962) Linus Pauling * (1974) Eisaku Sat≈ç * (1982) Alva Myrdal and Alfonso Garcia Robles * (1985) International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War * (1990) Mikhail Gorbachev * (1995) Joseph Rotblat and the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs * (2005) International Atomic Energy Agency and Mohamed ElBaradei In the award presentation speech on December 10, 2017, Nobel Committee Chair Berit Reiss-Andersen recalled that \\"twelve Peace Prizes have been awarded, in whole or in part,\\" to honor \\"efforts against the proliferation of nuclear weapons and for nuclear disarmament,\\" and included 2009 Nobelist Barack Obama.

The company's annual production capacity reached 301,513 tonnes of aluminum in 2007. In March 2011, Hongqiao was listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange at a price of $7.20 per share. The IPO reached raised $2.2. In the meantime, the company's annual production capacity reached 1.1 million tonnes per year. According to the company's own data, the annual aluminum production exceeded four million tonnes in 2014. In March 2016, Hongqiao declared its capacity increase of 16%, reaching 5.2 million tonnes. China Hongqiao Group Ltd. announced that it would expand capacity to six million metric tons per annum, or sixteen percent, by the end of 2016, depending on market conditions. Since its creation, China Hongqiao has been building its future on innovation, education, and sustainability at national and global levels with the vision to build a world-class, globally competitive enterprise and the Mission to become sustainable, innovative and people- oriented. China Hongqiao further increased its investment in environmental protection in 2018 with key projects that include upgrading and renovating both the electrolytic aluminum and alumina production process. View within Hongqiao Company In the first half of 2020 the Group's revenue was approximately RMB39,938,675,000 representing a year- on-year decrease of approximately 3.6%. Gross profit was approximately RMB6,468,399,000, representing a year- on-year decrease of approximately 15.4%, while net profit attributable to owners of the Company was approximately RMB2,831,849,000, representing a year-on-year increase of approximately 14.3% (company‚Äôs 2020 Interim Report).  Sustainability  Over the years, China Hongqiao group has integrated sustainability into its overall strategy while managing the company‚Äôs core business. In particular, the group has been committed to facilitating green development industry and protecting the environment since 2018. The actions undertaken by China Hongqiao to promote sustainability include: pollution prevention and control, namely the integration of environmental protection facilities into its production management system; energy conservation, a goal to be achieved along with consumption reduction; green office, namely the incentive towards all the employees to keep their office green. 244x244px  Company operations   China  268x268px 269x269pxThe Group's main production facility is located in Binzhou, Shandong province, China. All of Hongqiao‚Äôs smelting capacity is currently located in the city of Binzhou in Shandong and relies on coal-fired power for the electricity-intensive smelting process. To swap coal for cleaner hydropower Hongqiao plans to move 2 million tonnes of capacity in two phases to Wenshan prefecture, in the southeast of hydropower-rich Yunnan province near the border with Vietnam. The first phase of the project was put into production in September 2020 with a total project investment at 40 billion yuan ($5.91 billion).  Indonesia  In 2013, China Hongqiao Group and Indonesia's Khaleda Group, Weili Investment (Hong Kong) Co., Ltd. jointly established Hongfa Weili Alumina Co., Ltd., with a joint investment of 1 billion U.S. dollars to build an annual output of 2 million tons of aluminum production in Indonesia's West Kalimantan Province. In 2016, the company opened its first production facility in Indonesia with an output of one million tons per year. Hongqiao holds 56% stakes in PT Well Harvest Alumina. This was both the first Chinese investment in an alumina refining plant and the first aluminum factory built in Indonesia. Consisting of a power plant and a seaport in Ktapang in the Kalimantan region, the factory converts bauxite into alumina. Sun Xiushun, president of the shipping company Winning International Group as well as shareholder of the joint venture, explained that the treated alumina will mainly be used to meet the local demand for raw materials and the remaining aluminum oxide will be exported to China, the Middle East and other regions.  Guinea  China Hongqiao Group, in conjunction with China Yantai Port Group, Singapore Weili Group and Guinea UMS Company, formed the winning alliance SMB WINNING CONSORTIUM, registered in Guinea to set up a joint development with a local company primarily engaged in bauxite mining with a $200 million investment in the first phase of the project. China Hongqiao Group, in conjunction with China Yantai Port Group, Singapore Weili Group and Guinea UMS Company, formed the winning alliance SMB WINNING CONSORTIUM, registered in Guinea to set up a joint development with a local company primarily engaged in bauxite mining with a $200 million investment in the first phase of the project. The company in question has a construction subsidy in Guinea of an estimated 2.2 billion tones, with a duration of 25 years. The main purpose is to access to new bauxite reserves to meet growing demand in China. In March 2015, the company confirmed that it had reached an agreement on various mining and port investments amounting to US$120 million to promote the development and export of bauxite. In November 2015, 170 000 tonnes of bauxite were shipped from Guinea to China. In March 2016, China Hongqiao Group announced that it would export approximately 15 million tons of bauxite for 2016 as a whole. For the year 2017, 30 million tons are targeted.  Criticism   Overcapacities  Despite the efforts of the Chinese government to reduce the production surplus in the domestic bauxite industry through reforms, Hongqiao announced in March that production would be increased by 16% to six million tonnes by the end of 2016. According to Peter Thomas, vice president of Zaner Group LLC (a metal broker based in Chicago), it would cause a 1% to 2% drop in aluminum prices. The issue of overcapacity in the Chinese aluminum industry is a result of government policies, such as cheap loans and government subsidies meant to reduce the production costs of companies. In the case of Hongqiao, the company's growth was driven by a US$2.1 billion loan in 2015. In August 2016, Hongqiao CEO Zhang Bo dismissed fears of overcapacity in the aluminum industry, emphasizing instead the industry's stability. The production capacity increased to 5.2 million tonnes from 1.1 million since the IPO (March 2016). Action taken In August 2017, the company announced to cut two million tonnes of outdated aluminum production capacity, amid a renewed governmental crackdown on illegal production.  Environmental issues  The production of aluminum is an energy intensive process. Hongqiao's aluminum factories are heavily dependent on coal-generated electricity. Due to the high energy consumption, Hongqiao's production plants generate more than 100,000 kt CO2 emissions per year. In 2012, a Chinese journalist reported the deteriorating living conditions of people near factories due to air and water pollution. That same year, the company announced it will switch to coal ash for aluminum production, however, satellite images of the factory in Shandong showed large amounts of red mud, a toxic waste product of the bauxite production process. Since the production of aluminum from coal ash is very expensive, the company opted instead for bauxite. Toxic waste was then stored in the vicinity of agricultural areas, which led to fears that alkaline substances such as iron oxide, silicon oxide and titanium oxide could be released into the atmosphere. In 2016, Hongqiao was charged with operating unlicensed mills with a capacity of 2,000kt, as well as environmental fraud by ignoring Chinese emissions standards. In October 2016, the South China Morning Post reported that Hongqiao's aluminum smelter capacity in Binzhou was threatened after the city ordered a production stop of the local production lines with an annual total capacity of 3.61 million tonnes. In addition to financial penalties, the company also had to close sites because it \\"disregard for environmental protection permits before construction and operation of the plants\\". At the same time, the construction of an aluminum hut with an annual production capacity of 1.32 million tonnes was stopped because of missing environmental assessment. Hongqiao did not release any office announcements regarding the issue. Action taken Since the Chinese government passed tighter environmental requirements, Hongqiao began to switch to renewable energies and to close small and polluting power plants.  Power generation  China Hongqiao Group invented the \\"Weiqiao model\\" which means that aluminum plants are supported by self-built, coal-fueled power plants. This organizational model is now widely used in the Chinese aluminum industry. CCP media reported in 2012 that the company infringed the regulations of electricity generation by producing cheap electricity outside of the national electricity grid. The State Commission for Development and Reform indicated that the electricity produced by Hongqiao contributes significantly to air pollution, since the environmental protection equipment of the factories was removed in order to reduce production costs. Hongqiao denied the repeated reproaches of the government. Action taken In 2015, the company switched off their smaller electricity plants to demonstrate its commitment to clean aluminum production.  Anonymous Report  In November 2016, an anonymous short-seller published a report declared that Hongqiao has deliberately disguised its true profitability, by miss counting its profit margin and debts. A further report from Emerson Analytics, which seemingly confirmed the allegations, prompted the company to suspend its stock trading on 1 March 2017 after Hongqiao's stock value had fallen by 8.3% within 30 minutes. On March 21, Hongqiao announced a \\"possible delay\\" in the publication of its annual results and annual report for the year ended December 31, 2016 due to disagreements raised by auditor Ernst & Young. The following day, China Hongqiao shares were stopped again. The continued delay in the publication of company results, as well as accounting irregularities, led to a credit downgrade in July 2017.

One of the two DUF1646 RNAs in Enterococcus faecalis was independently detected by term-seq. Data from both discoveries suggest that DUF1646 RNAs are cis-regulatory RNAss, and that at least some DUF1646 RNAs use Rho-independent transcription terminators as their mechanism to regulate gene expression. The genes apparently regulated by DUF1646 RNAs are often related to the transportation of sodium ions. Among the two most commonly regulated gene classes are those encoding sodium/proton antiporters whose relationship to sodium ion transport is obvious. The other highly common gene class encodes proteins containing a DUF1646 domain, whose biochemical and biological function is unknown. Also regulated are genes encoding proteins that transport sodium using ATP, as well as genes encoding oxaloacetate carboxyltransferase. The reaction catalyzed by oxaloacetate carboxyltransferase is tied to transporting a sodium ion across the membrane. DUF1646 RNAs rarely occur upstream of c-di-AMP riboswitches, and in these cases they apparently regulate genes that are typical for c-di-AMP signalling. In these cases, the association to sodium is at least not direct. A DUF1646 RNA occurs upstream of an operon in Enterococcus hirae that was shown to regulate the downstream genes based on sodium ion concentrations.

Costello made his fortune as a builder and contractor during the gold rush, and built a large home in Carlton. He was elected to the Melbourne City Council in 1855. Costello ran for the Victorian Legislative Assembly in 1859 and 1861, standing in the seat of North Melbourne and running on a liberal platform which included support for secular education and opposition to the Masters and Servants Acts. He was successful on his second attempt. Costello was sworn into the Legislative Assembly on 31 August 1861, but was expelled two months later on 1 November after being convicted of electoral fraud. This was not in relation to his own election, but rather his actions in the Mornington seat, where he organised personation. Costello was sentenced to twelve months in prison, but received an early release on 31 March 1862. His business interests suffered as a result of his conviction, and he was declared insolvent in 1866. He did not become solvent again until 1891, but in the same year was elected to the North Melbourne Town Council; he served as mayor from 1892 to 1893. Costello died in 1896, aged 72. He married Catherine Donovan in 1847, and had three children, but was widowed in 1866. His descendants include Peter and Tim Costello, both great-great- grandchildren.

Some examples of Field-Shooting disciplines are: * Nordic Handgun Field-Shooting competitions are shot with pistol and revolver in different classes depending on equipment, with classes up from small-bore .22 LR to large-bore .500 S&W; Magnum. Mathces are held outdoor throughout the year with varied shooting targets and distances, and are arranged by the Norwegian Shooting Association (NSF), the Danish Gymnastics and Sports Associations (DGI Shooting) and the Swedish Pistol Shooting Association (SPSF). * Nordic Rifle Field-Shooting are shot with either small-bore .22 LR cartridge at 100 meters, or intermediate (such as .223 Remington or 6mm BR) or battle rifle cartridges (such as the 6.5√ó55mm, .308 Winchester or the .30-06 Springfield) at distances from 100 to 650 meters. With 200 and 300 meters being ordinary shooting distance in Nordic Bullseye Rifle-Shooting, those targets placed well beyond 300 meters in Rifle Field-Shooting means that the competition format also can be classified as a long range shooting discipline. Matches are usually held in the winter season with varied targets, and are arranged by the National Rifle Association of Norway (DFS), the Danish Gymnastics and Sports Associations (DGI Shooting) and the Swedish Shooting Sport Association (SvSF). * Swiss field shooting under the Swiss Shooting Sport Federation. The annual championship has been held for over 130 years, and is shot at the same time in several decentralized locations gathering up to 135,000 participants, perhaps making this event the largest shooting competition in the world * Precision rifle competitions, like the Precision Rifle Series (PRS), is both a field and long range shooting discipline where rifles with intermediate or battle rifle cartridges are shot in the terrain at varying distances from about 10 to 1000 meters. * Field Target is an outdoor air gun discipline originating in the United Kingdom, but gaining popularity worldwide.

On 25 February 1634, a group of Irish and Scottish officers acting under the approval of Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor, assassinated generalissimo Albrecht von Wallenstein and a group of his companions in the town of Eger (today Cheb, Czech Republic). The assassins were equated to executioners by a royal decree and rewarded with property confiscated from the families of their victims. The purge continued through the persecution of other high-ranking military personnel who were seen as Wallenstein's supporters. Background Portrait of Wallenstein by Michiel Jansz. van Mierevelt. Albrecht von Wallenstein was born on 24 September 1584, into the noble Bohemian Waldstein family. On 28 August 1599, he enrolled into the University of Altdorf but was soon expelled due to his involvement in brawls. He spent the next couple of years traveling around Europe. In 1604, he enlisted as an ensign into the military of the Holy Roman Empire. He fought during the closing stage of the Long Turkish War, rising to the rank of colonel by the outbreak of Bocskai uprising during which he commanded a unit of Bohemian Estates militia. In 1607, he became the chamberlain of Ferdinand of Styria, future Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor. In May 1609, he married Lucretia Viƒçkov, a widow of considerable means who died in 1614 granting Wallenstein her property. Wallenstein had previously secured his fortune by converting from the Protestant Unity of the Brethren denomination to Catholicism during the ongoing Recatholicazation campaign in Bohemia. At the outbreak of the 1618 Bohemian Revolt he demonstrated his loyalty to the crown by fighting his former coreligionists represented by the Bohemian Estates. A unit of cuirassiers whom he had recruited at his own expense fought at the decisive Battle of White Mountain which ended the revolt in the crown's favor. In 1623, Wallenstein married Elizabeth von Harrach the daughter of Karl von Harrach an influential member of emperor Ferdinand's Geheimrat (Privy Council). Harrach's two other daughters married Adam Erdmann Trƒçka von L√≠pa and Wallenstein's cousin Max von Waldstein. Wallenstein's newly acquired connections and riches enabled him to purchase vast estates formerly belonging to rebel barons, loan the emperor vast sums of money and raise thousands of troops. He campaigned extensively during the Thirty Years' War repelling incursions by the pretender to the Hungarian throne Gabriel Bethlen, defeating the Mansfeldian army in the Palatinate campaign of 1623. Those successes were followed by victories against the Danes between 1626 and 1628 which ended their intervention into the war. In February 1628, Wallenstein wrote off 4,750,000 florins of debt to the imperial treasury, in exchange he was elevated into an imperial prince and received the Duchy of Mecklenburg. While his army was now triple the size of that of the Catholic League, the empire's biggest ally. His meteoric rise to power was unprecedented in its scale became increasingly controversial among the members of the League who feared that their own possessions might be confiscated shall they disobey the emperor's command. In July 1630, the Catholic League used the opportunity of the Regensburg Electoral Congress to demand Wallenstein's dismissal. Wallenstein's reluctance to participate in the life of the court allowed his opponents to spread malicious rumors about him, such as his supposed ambitions to take the imperial throne for himself. Notably the Habsburg Spanish faction of the court was enraged at his failure to intervene into the Eighty Years' War. Bowing to outside pressure Ferdinand dismissed the general on 13 August. The Swedish intervention in the Thirty Years' War that took place on the same year swung the balance of power against the empire. Many still saw the former generalissimo as the only military commander capable of maintaining a balance among the opposing forces, his reinstatement was thus formalized on 13 April 1632. Wallenstein spent most of the following year campaigning separately from his senior officers who operated autonomously, many of whom avoided him for fear of his rage outbursts. An axis of his opponents within the army began corresponding in encoded messages, criticizing his passive approach and the lack of opportunities for promotion stemming from it. Ferdinand found his responses to criticism inadequate and the two disagreed on the number of issues such as the unsanctioned release of the captured Protestant general Jind≈ôich Maty√°≈° Thurn and Wallenstein's refusal to conduct offensives during the winter months. Massacre Assassination of Wallenstein's inner circle. Wallenstein's assassination. Wallenstein was increasingly criticized for his passivity in face of a Swedish incursion into Bavaria and the collapse of Lorraine under French pressure. His dislike of courtly life and the influence exerted by the church upon the emperor created an axis of undercover opposition that launched a smear campaign against him. On 11 January 1634, Gundakar, Prince of Liechtenstein sent Ferdinand II an official request, recommending Wallenstein's liquidation. A day later, Wallenstein summoned his colonels to sign the First Pilsner Reverse, a declaration of personal loyalty, 49 of them signed immediately while Hans Ulrich von Schaffgotsch and Johann Ernst Freiherr von Scherffenberg gathered signatures in Silesia and Upper Austria respectively. Numerous commanders signed the Reverse so as not to arouse suspicion, while at the same time a party centered around Ottavio Piccolomini began circulating an anonymous tract that summarized the army's grudges against Wallenstein. On 17 February, Scherffenberg was arrested in Vienna. On 18 February, a second patent was released accusing Wallenstein of conspiracy and condemning him to death, its publication was delayed so as not to split the army in two. Wallenstein's letters refuting the accusations against him remained unanswered, after realizing that the emperor was positioning troops in such a manner as to surround him he decided to flee to the Swedes. Wallenstein, Christian von Ilow and other loyal officers departed from their headquarters on 22 February along with 1,300 men. Irish colonel Walter Butler, the leader of a group of Irish and Scottish officers hired by Piccolomini to assassinate Wallenstein, was ordered by the unsuspecting general to follow them with his 900 dragoons. On 24 February, Wallenstein reached Eger, most of the trusted troops camped outside of the town as it was already garrisoned by Butler's dragoons and other anti-Wallenstein elements.. The following day Ilow held a series of meetings with the would be assassins trying to persuade them to remain loyal to their commander. They made the decision to go on with Piccolomini's plan, fearing that they would be branded as rebels should they fail to do so. At 6.00 p.m., Wallenstein's inner circle consisting of Ilow, Trƒçka von L√≠pa, Vil√©m Kinsk√Ω and Captain Niemann were invited by the conspirators to the city's castle for a formal dinner. During the course of the dinner a servant nodded indicating that the conspirators were ready. Six dragoons burst into the dining hall shouting \\"Who is a good Imperialist?\\", Butler, John Gordon and Walter Leslie rose from the table yelling \\"Long live Ferdinand!\\". Kinsk√Ω was killed immediately, although he made a desperate attempt to fight back. Ilow grabbed his sword and charged at Gordon; before being able to strike he was knocked to the ground by the dragoons and killed, others met a similar fate. Wallenstein was killed in his residence at 10.00 p.m. An imperial decree equated the perpetrators of the Eger Bloodbath with executioners. On 1 March, the commander of the Troppau garrison (an officer under Schaffgotsch's command) declared his allegiance to Wallenstein, unaware of what had previously happened. An investigation into the incident proved that Schaffgotsch was not implicated in the uprising. In the second half of April, he was sent to Vienna upon his request, where he continued to be interrogated. On 31 March 1635, Schaffgotsch was convicted of conspiracy to overthrow the emperor and sentenced to death.

Originally named The Black World History Wax Museum, the organization changed its name to The Griot Museum of Black History (‚ÄúThe Griot‚Äù) in 2009. In some west African countries, the griot, is a historian, storyteller, praise singer, poet and/or musician. The griot is a repository of oral tradition and is often seen as a societal leader who preserves and shares cultural traditions of a community. Likewise, the museum collects, preserves, and shares the stories, culture, and history of Black people with a focus on those with a regional connection to St. Louis.  History  The Griot is the second African American wax museum in the country, the first being National Great Blacks In Wax Museum in Baltimore. Founder Lois Conley was born in St. Louis and attended Saint Louis University for both her B.A. in Communications and M.A. in Education. She also completed a graduate certificate in Museum Studies at University of Missouri‚ÄìSt. Louis. In 2009, the Missouri Humanities Council formed the Urban Museum Collaborative with the Griot and two other St. Louis museums, Eugene Field House Museum and Campbell House Museum, to share resources and collaborate on educational programs following a \\"museum without walls\\" model to connect museum exhibits with their surrounding urban environments.  Exhibits and Programs  One of the \\"cakes\\" from the St. Louis 250 anniversary installed in front of the Griot Museum of Black History.

Over time Greek and Serbian civilians joined their ranks reaching 19,000 at its peak. From 1916 until its dissolution in 1918 then camp served as a punitive institution. Internees suffered from the lack of proper housing conditions, typhus, malnutrition and ill treatment from their guards. This led to the deaths of over 6,000 prisoners. Background The 28 June 1914 assassination of Austro-Hungarian heir presumptive Archduke Franz Ferdinand precipitated Austria-Hungary's declaration of war against Serbia. The conflict quickly attracted the involvement of all major European countries, pitting the Central Powers against the Entente coalition and starting World War I. After the entry of the Ottoman Empire into the war on the side of the Central Powers (November 1914), the decisive factor in the Balkans became the attitude of Bulgaria. Bulgaria occupied a strategically important position on the Serbian flank and its intervention on either side of the belligerents would be decisive. Bulgaria and Serbia had fought each continuously in the previous thirty years: following the Serbo-Bulgarian War of 1885 hostilities continued in the form of an undeclared war during the Macedonian Struggle. The area of north-western Macedonia then belonging to the Ottoman Empire became the arena of the ethnic violence between the ethnic Serb population represented by the Serbian Chetnik Organization and ethnic Bulgarians from the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO). IMRO also engaged in hostilities with ethnic Greeks and their supporters in the rest of Macedonia. In 1913, Serbia, Greece, Romania and the Ottoman Empire defeated Bulgaria in the Second Balkan War and the Bulgarian government and people generally felt that Serbia and Greece had stolen land which rightfully belonged to Bulgaria. The preceding waves of tit for tat war crimes committed by both parties, left relations strained. Starting from December 1914, at least 18 articles appeared in Bulgarian newspapers accusing the Serbian army of perpetrating massacres, mass rapes and other crimes towards the Bulgarian populations of Vardar Macedonia. At the same time IMRO stepped up its attacks in Serbian controlled territories. While the Allies could only offer Bulgaria small territorial concessions from Serbia and neutral Greece, the Central Powers' promises appeared far more enticing, as they offered to cede most of the land which Bulgaria claimed. With the Allied defeats at the Battle of Gallipoli (April 1915 to January 1916) and the Russian defeat at Gorlice-Tarn√≥w (May to September 1915) demonstrating the Central Powers' strength, King Ferdinand signed a treaty with Germany and on September 21, 1915 Bulgaria began mobilizing for war. After the victory of the Serbian army in the Battle of Kolubara in December 1914, the Serbian front saw a lull until the early autumn of 1915. Under the command of Field Marshal August von Mackensen, the Austro- Hungarian Balkan Army, the German 11th Army and river flotillas on the Danube and the Sava began an offensive on 6 October 1915, the largest offensive against Serbia. By September 1915, despite the extreme sacrifice of the Serbian army, the Austro-Hungarian Balkan Army, having crossed the rivers Sava and Drina and the German 11th Army after crossing the Danube, occupied Belgrade, Smederevo, Po≈æarevac and Golubac, creating a wide bridgehead south of the Sava and Danube rivers. This, combined with the successful Bulgarian offensives at Morava, Ovƒçe Pole and Kosovo forced Serbian forces to withdraw to neutral Greece. France and Britain to transferred troops from the Gallipoli Campaign to Greek Macedonia. The Macedonian front was thus established in an effort to support the remnants of the Serbian army to conquer Vardar Macedonia. On 17 August 1916, in the Struma Offensive Bulgaria invaded Greece, easily conquering all Greek territory east of the Struma, since the Greek Army was ordered not to resist by the pro-German King Constantine. The surrender of territory recently won with difficulty in the Second Balkan War was the last straw for many supporters of Liberal Party politician Eleftherios Venizelos. With Allied assistance, they launched a coup which secured Thessaloniki and most of Greek Macedonia, causing the National Schism. In June 1917, the Venizelists gained full control of the country, immediately declaring war on the Central Powers and joining the Allied Army of the Orient operating on the Balkan Front. The Greek entry into the war along with the 24 division reinforcements that the Army had received in the spring of the same year had created a strategic advantage for the Entente. On 29 September 1918, the Bulgarians were granted the Armistice of Salonica following a decisive defeat in the Vardar Offensive. During the course of the Balkan Wars Bulgaria had captured a relatively small number of prisoners, therefore their internment was limited to cities. Bulgaria entered the First World War, having no previous experience of running prisoner of war camps. Arrangements were improvised on the spot, causing major logistical issues. A document titled \\"Regulations for Prisoners of War\\" was issued on 9 October 1915, it officially endorsed the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907. Nevertheless many regulations were characterized by their ambiguity, thus granting the camp commanders disproportionate power in the decision making process. While the Plovdiv camp stood next to the Arda river and the weather was mild, the Haskovo lacked a supply of clean water. The reports issued by the camp commanders were filled incorrectly and rarely described humanitarian conditions. Furthermore inspections to the camps were scarce and irregular. Regulations were overhauled in 1918 when the Bulgarian government acknowledged the existence of disparities between the camps. Yet the lack of an adequate enforcement mechanism and the hardships faced by Bulgaria during that time frame prevented them from being implemented. Camp Allied prisoners of war in Bulgaria. The Sliven prisoner-of-war camp was established in 1915 with the intent of housing captured Serbian troops. Starting from 1916, its population was bolstered with Serbian civilians who were held in mixed groups with the military personnel. At its peak 19,000 prisoners were assigned to Sliven, being the biggest P.O.W. camp in Bulgaria. However 1,800 at most resided within the camp, the rest being house near their place of employment. At the same time the camp was transformed into a punitive institution. In July 1917, it began receiving Greek civilians from the occupied Western Thrace region, the Greeks were treated the same way as the Serbs. A parallel influx of Serbian civilians from Morava necessitated the construction of a lesser camp, numbering 28 barracks. Each barrack held 80 to 100 internees while its intended capacity was 20. The prisoners slept on the floor, it did not contain bed, hay or blankets or windows. The faulty construction meant that water often leaked in. The barrack had no toilets and sanitation and disinfection were rare, prisoners still defecated within them as those who attempted to venture outside the barracks during the night were shot or beaten. The prisoners held there were fed 300 to 800 grams of black bread per day, a pepper soup three times per week and meat once per week. The prisoners grew increasingly hungry eating grass and stealing hay from the cattle. The internees were held without clothes, shoes or underwear. On average only 20 people per barrack survived until the end of the war. Between August and December 1917, 2,709 deaths were recorded of them 1,490 were from malnutrition. In the winter of 1917, the camp was struck by an epidemic of typhus. In January 1918, a quarantine was put in place by the three prisoner of war doctors practicing at the camp. Of the 5,036 prisoner, 1,548 were declared unfit for work, 314 were sick, 2,379 were working outside the camp and 623 were held as regular prisoners. An inspection by major general Mitiev in the same month led to the enactment of a 21 day incubation period in barracks where a sick prisoner was found. From then on the healthy prisoners were separated from the sick by an armed guard. Mitiev's inspection also uncovered the deaths of 99 and 66 prisoners in December 1917 and January 1918 at the camp's Yambol depot. The depot's commander second lieutenant Hristozov had not filled the necessary forms properly and claimed to be oblivious to the cause of the deaths, while having taken no precautionary measures against the epidemic. When threatened with a court-martial Hristozov emphatically dismissed the warning. A post war Inter‚ÄìAllied War Commission estimated that 4,142 Serbian nationals died in the camp and 2,000 more died while performing hard labor outside its limits. On 21 May 1921, Sliven's local council lamented the condition of the camp's graveyard, which held the remains of Serbian prisoners of war and interned civilians. Aftermath The Paris Peace Conference, 1919, separated war crimes into 32 specific classes, forming the basis for the future persecution of war criminals identified in previous national and inter‚Äìallied commissions. However the question was subsequently forsaken and the responsibility for the trials fell upon the national courts of the Central Powers. A post war Inter‚ÄìAllied War Commission investigated allegations levelled against Bulgaria, concluding that Bulgarian occupational authorities in Serbia and Greece had breached every single article of the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907. The kingdom of Serbia presented a list of 500 Bulgarians it suspected of war crimes, based on the commission's findings. Bulgaria's official response to the enquiry stated that 3 people were arrested and 2 executed for their involvement in various violations of the rules of war. This was later proved to be false, none of the accused were ever convicted of their crimes.

Biography  Born in Albi, he became blind at the age of 2.5 years old. He entered the Institut National des Jeunes Aveugles of Paris in 1874 and worked the organ with Louis Lebel (1831-1888). From 1884 to 1886, he followed courses in music composition with Ernest Guiraud and pipe organ with C√©sar Franck at the Conservatoire de Paris (CNSM) where he won the first prize of organ in 1886. He was the first blind man to achieve this feat at the CNSM. In 1888, he succeeded Louis Lebel as organ teacher at the Institut National des Jeunes Aveugles where he taught until 1930, notably to Louis Vierne, Augustin Bari√©, Paul Allix, Andr√© Marchal, Jean Langlais and Gaston Litaize.

It was built in 1834. It has been used at times for various other purposes: as a bank, multiple restaurants, a guesthouse and a bookshop. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Indigenous occupation The lower Hawkesbury was home to the Dharug people. The proximity to the Nepean River and South Creek qualifies it as a key area for food resources for indigenous groups.Proudfoot, 1987 The Dharug and Darkinjung people called the river Deerubbin and it was a vital source of food and transport.Nichols, 2010 Early European colonisation Governor Arthur Phillip explored the local area in search of suitable agricultural land in 1789 and discovered and named the Hawkesbury River after Baron Hawkesbury. This region played a significant role in the early development of the colony with European settlers established here by 1794. Situated on fertile floodplains and well known for its abundant agriculture, Green Hills (as it was originally called) supported the colony through desperate times. However, frequent flooding meant that the farmers along the riverbanks were often ruined. The side of Loder House was first alienated for European purposes in a 1794 grant made by Francis Grose of thirty acres to Samuel Wilcox, who named it Wilcox Farm. It is likely that land clearance and agricultural activities as well as some building works took place during this period and during the subsequent of occupation. Wilcox Farm was incorporated into a larger holding of 1500 acres known as Peninsula Farm in the early 19th century. On 1 January 1810, Lachlan Macquarie replaced William Bligh as Governor of New South Wales. Under Macquarie's influence, the colony prospered. Macquarie's vision was for a free community of white people, working in conjunction with the penal colony. He implemented an unrivaled public works program, completing 265 public buildings, establishing new public amenities and improving existing services such as roads. Under his leadership Hawkesbury district thrived. On 6 December 1810, Macquarie recorded in his journal that on that day he had named what were to become the five Macquarie Towns in the Hawkesbury district. Following Macquarie's proclamation, Windsor became a more permanent township with streets, a town square and public buildings. Loder House Loder House was built in 1834 for George Loder Jnr., a prosperous farmer and merchant. Loder was the son of a soldier who came to Australia from India. In 1819, George Jnr., married Mary Ann Howe. They were successful in their farming pursuits, and decided to move to the township of Windsor and open a butcher's store. They commenced to build a grand townhouse shortly after establishing their business. They built Loder House in the main street of Windsor to house their large young family. In addition to his farming activities, George Jnr had accompanied his father George Snr and his younger brother Andrew on a number of explorations of the Hunter District, discovering and exploring the Singleton district. They were also given several grants of land at Singleton. Loder died in 1834, aged 38, never having lived in his grand house. He was buried in the family vault at St Matthew's Anglican Church. He left the house in trust to Mary Ann and his younger brother. In 1835 Mary Ann married her widowed brother in law Thomas Dargin II who also had a large young family and together they took up residence in the George Street house, which became known as Loder's House. Thomas Dargin died in 1843 and Mary Ann remarried in 1846 to Laban White, an auctioneer and prominent citizen of Windsor. They continued to live at Loder House until the death of White in 1873, whereupon Mary Ann went to live with relatives in Singleton, where she died in 1882. The house was subsequently used as a branch of the Commercial Bank of New South Wales from 1874 to 1889, with the upper and rear section used as a residence for the manager. The building was purchased in 1889 by Benjamin Richards and once more became a family residence. In 1893 Richards sold the property to Daniel Holland, another prosperous merchant in the town. He and his family lived there for some years and were responsible for the handsome cast iron lacework and stone walling which replaced an earlier pallisade fence. Holland conducted a successful drapery business in Windsor but eventually left the district in 1906. From 1923 to 1940 the building was used as a boarding house by Reginald Wilbow. In 1955 the property was transferred to Thomas Ogden, Thomas Cragg and William John and in 1962 to Norbert Cleary who held it until 1973 when it was partially gutted by fire. It was then purchased by Pacific Investments who applied to demolish the building and redevelop the site with a modern office block. The proposal met with such strong public opposition that the Department of Planning and Environment purchased the property in 1975 to ensure its conservation. The building has been associated with several prominent local identities including members of the Loder, Dargin, White, Richards and Holland families.Edds, 2015, 2 The building was restored under a National Estate Programme Grant by architects Fisher Lucas and leased to Hawkesbury Shire Council. A Permanent Conservation Order was made over the property in 1978 by the Minister for Planning and Environment under advice from the Heritage Council of NSW and the order was gazetted on 14 December 1979. This covered the land, the house, the brick outbuilding and boundary fence and it was only the 3rd made in New South Wales under the Heritage Act 1977. It has been used for a variety of uses since its acquisition by the state government, including various now-closed restaurants (\\"Lachlan's Restaurant\\", \\"Governor's Choice\\" and \\"The Linden\\"), as a boarding house, and for many years as a bookshop. It was sold in November 2006, and was vacant and advertised for lease in August 2017.  Description  Loder House is an 1834 two storey brick Georgian townhouse with attic and later Victorian two storey timber verandah with cast iron lacework balustrades and verandah brackets. The upper floor has five symmetrically placed French Doors with stone voussiors, opening onto the verandah, whilst the ground floor has paired windows with stone voussoirs and sills, flanking a central entrance with an arched fanlight. The main facade is of face sandstock whilst the side walls have been rendered. The 1975 National Trust (NSW) listing said that at that time the street facade was stuccoed, the remainder of the external walls face brick. The corrugated iron roof has been replaced when the building was restored. The verandah is stone flagged. The grounds contain an 1830s boundary wall and an unusual square outbuilding which dates from the time of construction of Loder House. Some stone flagging survives in the rear yard. The townhouse today has frontage to the WIndsor pedestrian mall.Edds, 2015, 2 The building appears to be in excellent condition and was restored in 1975. The site has some archaeological potential, particularly in the grounds surrounding the outbuilding, whose original purpose is unclear. The house is substantially intact, despite it nearly being burnt down.  Heritage listing  Loder House is a rare intact two storey brick Georgian townhouse, located in the main street of Windsor. The building has been associated with several prominent local identities including members of the Loder, Dargin, White, Richards and Holland families. The grounds of the house contain an 1830s boundary wall and an unusual square outbuilding which dates from the construction of the house. Loder House was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.

He was a prolific author and a member of many learned societies. In the last years of his life he was a Senator for Alpes- Maritimes. Life Joseph Garnier was born in Beuil, Alpes Maritimes, on 3 October 1813, son of a farmer. He studied at the Draguignan, then in 1829 entered the Ecole sup√©rieure de commerce de Paris. On the recommendation of the director of the school, the economist J√©r√¥me-Adolphe Blanqui, he was appointed assistant professor and then director of studies. At the same time he published articles on political economy. In 1835 he became an editor at Le National. In 1838 he founded a vocational education center, which he managed until 1843. Garnier was one of the founders of the Journal des Economistes in 1841, of which he became director in 1845. Joseph Garnier and his friends Adolphe-Gustave Blaise (1811‚Äì86) and Gilbert Guillaumin (1801‚Äì64) decided to form a society that would meet once a month to dine and discuss political economy. The first meeting of the Soci√©t√© d'√©conomie politique with five people was held on 15 November 1842 including Blaise, Garnier, Guillaumin and Eug√®ne Daire (1798‚Äì1847). The numbers grew with successive meetings. The society was open to men with very different positions in life and diverse political views, most of them influential either through their position or their writings. They could meet on neutral scientific grounds to exchange views on subjects such as the functions of the state, land rents, commercial freedom, public finances, the Cr√©dit Foncier, regulations and socialism. The central theme was always political economy. Garnier was made permanent secretary of the Soci√©t√© d'Economie Politique. In 1846 Garnier cofounded the short-lived Association pour la libert√© des √©changes, with others such as Fr√©d√©ric Bastiat and Wolowski. Also in 1846 he was named professor of political economy at the √âcole des Ponts et Chauss√©es. He was one of the organizers of the Congress of Friends of Peace, held in Paris in 1849, Frankfurt in 1850 and London in 1851. He founded and directed the Nouveau Journal des Connaissances utiles (1853‚Äì1860) and contributed to the Dictionnaire de l'Economie Politique of Charles Coquelin and Gilbert-Urbain Guillaumin. Garnier was a member of almost all the societies of statistics and political economy of Europe. Garnier ran for election in the supplementary elections of 1871, but did not succeed. In 1873 he was elected a member of the Acad√©mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques in place of Charles Dupin. Garnier was elected senator of Alpes-Maritimes on 30 January 1876 with 121 out of 207 voters. He sat on the left, and consistently voted with the Republicans until his death. Joseph Garnier died in Paris on 25 September 1881. He had been made a Knight of the Legion of Honour in August 1860. Publications Besides his economic articles in the Presse, National, Si√®cle and Journal des D√©bats, Garnier published a great number of works. The best known include the Trait√© d'√©conomie politique, which was often reprinted, his Trait√© de finances, the Annuaire d'√©conomie politique et de statistique, which he published from 1844 to 1855 in collaboration with Guillaumin, a revised edition of Malthus and a Trait√© sur le principe de population.

They were members of the superfamily Mycteropoidea. Hibbertopterids were large, broad and heavy animals unlike virtually every other group of eurypterids, which are commonly streamlined and lightweight. Their bizarre morphology is so unusual that they in the past have been thought to represent an entirely distinct order of chelicerates. Fossils of the family first appear in deposits of Middle Devonian age and the last known fossils representing hibbertopterids are known from deposits of Late Permian age. The hibbertopterids represent the last known living eurypterids, going extinct during the Permian‚ÄìTriassic extinction event or shortly before. Although eurypterids are commonly known as \\"sea scorpions\\", hibbertopterids inhabited freshwater swamps and rivers and were unable to swim since they lacked swimming paddles, a feature they shared with their entire suborder, the Stylonurina. Hibbertopterids fed using a method referred to as sweep-feeding, in which the animal would rake through the soft sediment of their substrate with specialised blades on their forward-facing appendages to capture small invertebrates. Though this method of feeding was present in other mycteropoids and in stylonuroids, it was at its most advanced stage within the derived Hibbertopteridae. The hibbertopterids were the largest of all stylonurine eurypterids, with both Hibbertopterus at 180‚Äì200 centimetres (5.9‚Äì6.6 ft) and Campylocephalus at 140 centimetres (4.6 feet) representing giant eurypterids in their own right. Though longer eurypterids are known from the eurypterine suborder, notably the largest known arthropod of all time, Jaekelopterus, at 230‚Äì260 centimetres (7.5‚Äì8.5 ft), hibbertopterids were far bulkier than any of the largest eurypterine eurypterids and as such likely represent the overall heaviest animals in the order.  Description  Restoration of Campylocephalus. Hibbertopterids were large mycteropoid eurypterids characterised by their broad prosomas (heads), hastate (e.g. shaped like a gladius, a Roman sword) telsons (tail spikes) with paired keels and a covering of ornamentation in the shape of scales across their exoskeletons. More shared features are the presence of tongue-shaped scales on the margins of the tergites of the opisthosoma (the abdomen) and that the fourth pair of appendages were covered in spines. The prosoma of the hibbertopterids possessed lobes that were positioned posterolaterally (posteriorly on both sides). Although Vernonopterus has been estimated to have reached lengths of \\"just\\" 50 centimetres (19.7 inches), both Campylocephalus and Hibbertopterus represent true giant eurypterids. The largest specimens of Campylocephalus suggests a size of 140 centimetres (4.6 feet) and at 180‚Äì200 centimetres (5.9‚Äì6.6 ft), Hibbertopterus scouleri was the largest eurypterid in the entire stylonurine suborder.Lamsdell, James C.; Braddy, Simon J. (2009). \\"Cope's Rule and Romer's theory: patterns of diversity and gigantism in eurypterids and Palaeozoic vertebrates\\". Biology Letters: rsbl20090700. doi:10.1098/rsbl.2009.0700. ISSN 1744-9561. PMID 19828493. Supplementary information That hibbertopterids were so broad and compact probably means they were the overall heaviest eurypterids, surpassing longer forms, such as the light-weight pterygotids, in weight. Compared to other eurypterids, hibbertopterids were highly unusual. Their broad and heavy bodies go against the general eurypterid trend of being streamlined and lightweight and like all other stylonurine eurypterids, they lack swimming paddles. Out of their six pairs of limbs, the second, third and fourth pairs were forward-facing and specialised for gathering food. The leg segments of these limbs were covered with long spines and their ends were covered with sensory organs. The fourth pair of limbs, although also used in feeding, was also used for locomotion, as were pairs five and six. As such, hibbertopterids would have been hexapods (walking on six legs).Jeram, Andrew J.; Selden, Paul A. (1993). \\"Eurypterids from the Vis√©an of East Kirkton, West Lothian, Scotland\\". Earth and Environmental Science Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. 84 (3-4): 301‚Äì308. doi:10.1017/S0263593300006118. ISSN 1755-6929. Due to the fragmentary nature of both Campylocephalus and Vernonopterus, confidently establishing distinguishing features between the three genera is difficult. Distinguishing Campylocephalus from Hibbertopterus is primarily the fact that the carapace (exoskeleton covering the head) of Campylocephalus is slightly narrower and is broadest at its midsection, rather than at the part which connects to the rest of the body (as it is in Hibbertopterus). The fragmentary Vernonopterus can be distinguished from the others by its distinctive and unique ornamentation.Hughes, Emily Samantha (2019), \\"Discerning the Diets of Sweep-Feeding Eurypterids Through Analyses of Mesh-Modified Appendage Armature\\". Graduate Theses, Dissertations, and Problem Reports. 3890. Preserved cuticle of hibbertopterids is thinner than what is expected of arthropods of their size, though this might be explained by the possibility that only an outer exocuticular region has been preserved in their fossils.  Classification  Restoration of Hibbertopterus. The hibbertopterids are classified as part of the superfamily Mycteropoidea within the eurypterid suborder Stylonurina. The family includes the three genera Campylocephalus, Hibbertopterus and Vernonopterus. Up until recently the two genera Cyrtoctenus and Dunsopterus were also recognised as valid and distinct hibbertopterid genera, but the modern consensus is that they represent ontogenetic stages (different developmental stages of the animal throughout its life) of Hibbertopterus.Dunlop, J. A., Penney, D. & Jekel, D. 2018. A summary list of fossil spiders and their relatives. In World Spider Catalog. Natural History Museum Bern The genus Hastimima, sometimes classified as part of the Hibbertopteridae, has been recovered as part of the Mycteroptidae (the closest relatives of the hibbertopterids) in recent analyses. The morphology of the hibbertopterids was so unusual that they have been thought to be an order separate to Eurypterida. Recent work however confirms them to be derived members of the suborder Stylonurina, closely related to Drepanopterus and the Mycteroptidae. The features of genera Campylocephalus and Vernonopterus makes it clear that both genera represent hibbertopterid eurypterids, but the incomplete nature of all fossil specimens referred to them make any further study of the precise phylogenetic relationships within the Hibbertopteridae difficult. Both genera could even represent further synonyms of Hibbertopterus itself, which would make the family monotypic (containing only one immediately subordinate taxon), though the highly incomplete nature of their remains again makes that hypothesis impossible to confirm. The cladogram below is adapted from Lamsdell (2012), collapsed to only show the superfamily Mycteropoidea.  Palaeoecology  The hibbertopterids were derived sweep-feeders, inhabiting freshwater swamps and rivers and feeding by raking through the soft sediment with blades on their anterior appendages to capture small invertebrates. Sweep-feeding strategies evolved independently in two of the four stylonurine superfamilies, the Stylonuroidea and the Mycteropoidea. In both superfamilies, the adaptations to this lifestyle involves modifications to the spines on their anterior prosomal appendages for raking through the substrate of their habitats. Stylonuroids have fixed spines on appendages II-IV which could have been used as dragnets to rake through the sediments and thus entangling anything in their way. Mycteropoidea show even more extreme adaptations towards a sweep-feeding lifestyle. These adaptations are taken to an even further extreme within the Hibbertopteridae, with appendage IV possessing a blade alongside the appendages II-III (which also have blades in other hibbertopteroids). The coxae in Hibbertopterus are reduced, leading to part of the food masticatory process being assumed by the laden (plates overlaying the coxae). Some of its species have even further adaptations towards sweep- feeding than other mycteropoids, with its blades modified into comb-like rachis that could entrap smaller prey or other organic food particles. With its coxae being large, it is likely that some species of Hibbertopterus would also feed on relatively large invertebrates when able to.

She spent the majority of her career at Oxford University, and has been credited with helping to establish haematology as a distinct medical discipline. Early life and education Callender was born on 5 April 1914 in Sidcup, Kent, to Thomas Marshall Callender, a general practitioner, and Charlotte Elizabeth Marie Rose (n√©e Hoysted). Her mother and father were of Irish and Scottish descent respectively. She attended secondary school at the Godolphin School in Salisbury. She attended the University of St Andrews from 1932, earning a BSc in 1935 and an MBChB in 1938. Upon her latter graduation, she received a gold medal recognising her as the best student of her year. She graduated with an MD in 1944 for her research on anaemia during pregnancy. Career Callender began her career as a junior doctor at Dundee Royal Infirmary. In 1940, she was appointed to the Scottish Blood Transfusion Service as an assistant in pathology and medical officer. She worked at Oxford University from 1942 to 1946 as a house officer and research assistant. In 1946, she received a fellowship from the Rockefeller Foundation to conduct research in haematology in St. Louis, Missouri, until 1948. Upon her return to the United Kingdom, she was appointed reader and later a consultant physician at Oxford's Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, where she spent the rest of her career. She was made a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1962 and awarded a DSc by Oxford University in 1970. She has been recognised as one of a group of physicians in the United Kingdom and North America who helped to establish haematology as a distinct discipline of medicine. Callender's contributions to haematology included research on iron absorption and the effects and management of iron overload. She studied some of the most common causes of anaemia: iron deficiency, vitamin B12 deficiency, and folate deficiency. She also worked with Rob Race to develop a new method for determining the lifespan of red blood cells, and helped Leslie Witts on early studies of chemotherapy regimens for treating leukaemia. She and her colleagues at Oxford designed one of the first whole-body counters to measure radioactivity within the body. Personal life Callender married Ivan Gyula √Årp√°d Monostori, a Hungarian refugee studying medicine at Oxford, in 1957; they lived together in Oxford and Scotland with \\"a collection of rather terrifying mastiffs\\".

It was designed and built in 1841 by Michael Byrne. It is also known as Glenalvon and Glenalvon and Stables. The property is owned by Department of Planning and Infrastructure, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. Glenalvon House and farm was the family home of Michael Byrne, a publican. The homestead in the Victorian Georgian style was built in 1840. The homestead is managed by Campbelltown and Airds Historical Society Inc. as a museum that is open to the public for a modest fee.  History  The outline of the house is first shown on two town plans dated November 1840, although the stables are not shown at this time. It is thought that Michael Byrne, a publican, built the house around this time on the grant of 1 acre and 32 perches which was taken up in 1831. Although it is possible that the outbuildings were not shown, it is more likely that the stables were constructed later (which would be supported by the differing styles of the two buildings). Michael Byrne was born in County Wicklow, near Dublin in 1800, the son of Hugh and Sarah Byrne. Hugh Byrne was convicted without trial and transported to Australia, with his family, in 1802 for treasonous practices in the 1798 Irish Rebellion. Michael Byrne was made an apprentice to Lawrence Butler, Irish overseer of the NSW Government Lumber Yards, Sydney. Michael Byrne went on to own seven pubs in Campbelltown. He was trialled, though not found guilty, of kicking a man to death for non-payment of a debt. Byrne himself was made insolvent in 1844, after having built in 1841, Glenalvon, the finest stone house in the town.Lucas & McGinnes, 2012. He died in 1878 and is buried in the Irish corner of the Roman Catholic Cemetery in Campbelltown.Oakman, W., in Broadbent, Clarke & Oakman, 2008 By the 1840s various members of the Byrne family were experiencing financial difficulties, including Michael who by 1844 owed his brother-in-law, John Keighran (publican) the sum of A¬£880 17s 3d. As partial payment of the debt John accepted the property in Lithgow Street and a farm also owned by Byrne. Keighran is believed to have taken up residence in Glenalvon, along with his wife Catherine Byrne, sometime in 1853. They would eventually have thirteen children there. Upon the death of both parents little more than a year apart in 1858, the property passed to two of their sons John and Patrick. The property was mortgaged to pay the debts of the estate and the house was let to J. Kidd, JP, who remained in tenancy until 1878 when the property was sold to the Fieldhouse brothers. The Fieldhouse brothers were prominent businessmen in Campbelltown who owned over 44 properties within the town by 1884. From 1878-1891 \\"Glenalvin Hall\\" was the residence of Edwin Fieldhouse and his family. From 1891-1904 the property remained in the joint ownership of the brothers at the end of which time they divided their assets with Edwin retaining Glenalvon.Lot 91 Edwin vacated the house shortly after and it was variously tenanted until 1920 when it was sold to the Bursill Family. Glenalvon remained in the ownership of the Bursill family until 1965 when it was acquired by the (then) State Planning Authority (SPA) for $35,000.Lucas interview, 2011 In 1969 architect John Fisher (member of the Institute of Architects, the Cumberland County Council Historic Buildings Committee and on the first Council of the National Trust of Australia (NSW) after its reformation in 1960) was commissioned by the State Planning Authority to restore the first five houses in Campbelltown, which had been resumed under the Cumberland County Planning Scheme. They included Glenalvon.Lucas & McGinness, 2012 In 1970 the house and stables were restored by Clive Lucas at Fisher Jackson and Hudson and Lucas recalls this property as the conservation project where he first used the then innovative heritage principle of researching and understanding the fabric of a place before attempting conservation, including the use of paint scrapes to establish original paint schemes. The house was tenanted by the Oakham family from 1970 to 2010 and the stables are used as a resource centre by the Campbelltown and Airds District Historical Society. The State Planning Authority sold Glenalvon to Campbelltown City Council and the Campbelltown & Airds District Historical Society now manage the building and garden, running displays, meetings, events.Nicholas, pers.comm., 8/10/2013  Description  ;Garden: The house is set in a mature garden, which contains some historic plantings including tall columnar Cook's pine (Araucaria columnaris), silky oak (Grevillea robusta) and Californian desert fan palm (Washingtonia robusta). ;House: A two-storey Georgian finely cut sandstone residence with symmetrical facade. The front verandah is stone flagged and is supported by turned stone Doric style columns. The hipped roof, originally shingled, is now clad in corrugated iron. The main entrance is located centrally on the southern elevation and double verandah posts on either side emphasise the point of entry. There are shuttered French doors either side of the main entry, opening onto the verandah. The five windows to the upper floor are double hung, timber sashed and of 9 panes to both the upper and lower sashes. The rear of the house has a verandah supported by flat timber columns. To the rear (north) of the house is located the former stables consisting of a symmetrical rectangular sandstone building with central gable on the eastern facade containing the entry doors and loft doors above. The hipped and gabled roof is clad in corrugated iron sheeting and has decorative timber barge boards. The roof framings were noted in 1973 as being jointed, dowelled, pegged and numbered without the use of nails (NT Listing). The verandah and eaves have timber soffits. Cellars are located below the house. ;Interior: Original cedar joinery, inc. six panelled doors, splayed panelled jambs to the windows and chimney pieces to the first floor; marble ground floor chimney pieces with sandstone mantlepieces; original geometric stair.  Condition  As at 1 February 1999, The building and grounds are in excellent condition, having undergone extensive conservation works in 1969. The property has been very well maintained since that time, although the garden is currently somewhat overgrown. Glenalvon has survived with much of its significant 1840s fabric intact and the original curtilage and setting of the property can still be interpreted. The property has high overall integrity.  Modifications and dates  *1969 - conservation and restoration of the building and grounds. The site is currently being evaluated through the preparation of a detailed conservation management plan (CMP). A CMP has been finalised and endorsed by the Heritage Council on 24 July 2000.  Heritage listing  As at 27 November 1998, Glenalvon is historically, aesthetically and socially significant as one of the oldest urban townhouses in the township of Campbelltown. The house and stables of Glenalvon are a significant landmark element. Glenalvon has been used continuously as a residence for almost 160 years and although some changes have been made to the house, much of the original fabric, dating from 1840, has survived intact. The landscape setting of the house is also important as it represents part of the original curtilage of the property and makes a major contribution to the historic townscape of Campbelltown. Glenalvon House was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Glenalvon is of historical significance as one of the oldest uurban townhouses surviving in the township of Campbelltown. It is of further historical significance for it association with early and prominent families of the Campbelltown district and for its links to a way of life which has long since disappeared. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Glenalvon is of high aesthetic significance as a particularly fine Colonial Georgian sandstone residence retaining much of its 1840s fabric intact. The stables buildings are also of high aesthetic significance as are the grounds which give an indication of the early curtilage of the property. The house combined with its grounds are important as reminders of the setting of early town houses with their generously landscaped grounds. Both the building and grounds make a considerable contribution to the historic townscape of Campbelltown. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Glenalvon is of high social significance for its association with several prominent Campbelltown families and for its demonstration of the early pattern of life in the original township. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Glenalvon is of high technical/research significance for its demonstration of colonial building techniques and for its use of local building materials and craftsmen, particularly the stonemasons, some of whom were convicts. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Glenalvon is a rare surviving example of an 1840s townhouse to survive with much of its 1840s fabric and grounds intact, indicating the stature of such houses at the time of their construction. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Glenalvon is an excellent example of an 1840s townhouse in the Colonial Georgian style.

This phase of conflict began after an incident on 12 May 2017, when a child and a Pakistani man were shot and killed. The detention of Qatif human rights activist Israa al-Ghomgham and her husband and the possible beheading of al- Ghomgham as the first Saudi woman to be executed for her human rights activities gained international attention during 2018. On 31 January 2019, the Saudi authorities confirmed in a public statement that they would not seek the imposition of the death penalty against al-Ghomgham.  Background  On 15 October 2014, Nimr al-Nimr was sentenced to death by the Specialised Criminal Court for \\"seeking 'foreign meddling' in Saudi Arabia, 'disobeying' its rulers and taking up arms against the security forces\\". Said Boumedouha of Amnesty International stated that the death sentence was part of a campaign by the authorities in Saudi Arabia to crush all dissent, including those defending the rights of the Kingdom's Shi'a Muslim community. Nimr al-Nimr's brother, Mohammad al-Nimr, tweeted information about the death sentence and was arrested on the same day. The head of Iran's armed forces warned Saudi Arabia that it would \\"pay dearly\\" if it carried out the execution. In March 2015 the Saudi Arabian appellate court upheld the death sentence against al-Nimr. On 25 October 2015, the Supreme Religious Court of Saudi Arabia rejected al-Nimr's appeal against his death sentence. During an interview for Reuters, al-Nimr's brother claimed that the decision was a result of a hearing which occurred without the presence or notification of al-Nimr's lawyers and family. Al- Nimr's brother still remained hopeful that King Salman would grant a pardon. Nimr al-Nimr was executed along with 46 others on 2 January 2016.  Low-level conflict  From May 2017 through to 2018 and 2019, several incidents occurred in which Qatif residents and/or Saudi policemen were killed.  Awamiyah residential area destruction  Around May 2017, Saudi authorities erected siege barricades in Awamiyah and attempted to bulldoze the al-Musawara residential area. Adam Coogle of Human Rights Watch (HRW) described the conflict as surprisingly intense for Saudi Arabia, stating, \\"I've documented conflict in Saudi Arabia before but nothing like this. I've seen protests, but nothing this militarised.\\" He considered it unprecedented for there to be \\"heavy clashes going on between the state and its citizens in a Saudi city.\\" About 12‚Äì25 people were killed in shelling and sniper fire during May and the following few months. Streets of Awamiyah were described by The Independent as \\"covered in rubble and sewage\\" and \\"[looking] more like a scene from Syria than an oil-rich Gulf city.\\" One protestor stated that he switched from peaceful protesting to methods to armed methods as a result of government repression, including an assault against his wife and frightening his children.  Legal cases  In early December 2017, Israa al-Ghomgham and her husband Moussa al-Hashem were arrested in their home and detained in the Dammam al-Mabahith prison. They were charged for their activities in relation to participation and documentation of the Qatif political protests. On 6 August 2018, the prosecutor in their case recommended that they be executed, making al-Ghomgham the first Saudi women to be sentenced to death for human rights campaigning, according to Saudi activists. Al-Ghomgham and her husband's potential death sentence gained international attention, with support for their case from Shia Rights Watch, the European Saudi Organisation for Human Rights, Amnesty International, and Global Affairs Canada. Al- Ghomgham's final sentencing for confirming or rejecting the proposed death penalty was planned for 28 October 2018. Legal proceedings, including arrests, investigations, trials and executions, of 24 people were referred to as the \\"Qatif 24 case\\". Most were convicted on false confessions based on torture. Fourteen of these were executed as part of the 2019 Saudi Arabia mass execution.

He was a faithful confidant of Coloman, King of Hungary and the initiator of large-scale church organizational and canon law reforms in the Kingdom of Hungary. Career Lawrence was born into an unidentified illustrious noble family. He was a member of the royal chapel as one of the court clergymen during the reign of Ladislaus I of Hungary. According to historian N√°ndor Knauz, he was mentioned in this capacity on 17 April 1093. Literary historian L√°szl√≥ Mezey argued Lawrence studied at Laon, France during his youth. A royal charter from 1111 refers to Lawrence's influence and widespread literacy, who \\"gladly dealt with sciences\\". During Coloman's rule (who was initially prepared for a church career), Lawrence served as royal chaplain. 17th-century Jesuit scholar S√°ndor Sz√∂r√©nyi claimed Lawrence served as Bishop of Eger from 1104 to 1105 prior to his election as metropolitan of Esztergom, but there is no contemporary record of that. Nevertheless, numerous authors, including M√°rton Szentiv√°nyi, Gy√∂rgy Pray and Mikl√≥s Schmitth accepted the data in the upcoming decades. After the death of Seraphin in 1104, Lawrence became Archbishop of Esztergom. He first appeared in that capacity around 1105 or 1106. Under his tenure, he was a strong confidant of Coloman and advocated his foreign policy in the assistance of Pope Paschal II in the long struggle with the Holy Roman Emperors over investiture. Nevertheless, Coloman sought to keep the country's independence also against the Church, with which the archbishop agreed. As a result, Lawrence supported the military campaign against Dalmatia, which violated the Pope's interests. Provost Theobald represented Lawrence and his monarch in the Synod of Dalmatia in 1106. Lawrence consecrated the monastery at D√∂m√∂s around 1108, erected by King Coloman's rebellious brother, Duke √Ålmos. On the occasion of its consecration, where Coloman was also present, √Ålmos was‚Äîfalsely, according to the Illuminated Chronicle‚Äîaccused of an assassination attempt on the monarch. Coloman decided to have his brother arrested, but \\"the most reverend bishops and other well-disposed dignitaries\\" with the leadership of Lawrence, intervened on √Ålmos's behalf and \\"thus reconciliation was solemnly sworn\\" between Coloman and his brother. Lawrence's name appeared in a royal document in May 1108, when Coloman confirmed the privileges of Trogir. Lawrence escorted Coloman along with six bishops and several secular barons to Dalmatia, when the king reaffirmed the privileges of Split, Trogir, and Zadar in 1111. A non-authentic royal charter from that year confirms the assumption that Archbishop Lawrence simultaneously functioned as royal chaplain and was responsible for issuing royal diplomas. He was mentioned as the first within Coloman's companion by the two establishing charters of the Zobor Abbey, issued in 1111 and 1113. According to the Annales Posonienses, Lawrence died in 1114, however the years of annals often proved wrong, a few years difference detected in the majority of cases. In fact, Lawrence survived Coloman, who died on 3 February 1116, and his funeral at the Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r Cathedral was celebrated by Lawrence. In the same place, Stephen II was crowned king by Archbishop Lawrence within thirty days of his father's death. The contemporaneous Cosmas of Prague referred to Lawrence as a living person at the beginning of the Stephen's reign, when the young king provocated a war against Vladislaus I of Bohemia, as the Czech chronicler narrated in his work Chronica Boemorum. Accordingly, Lawrence and his troops rescued Stephen from the battlefield near the river Ol≈°ava, where the Bohemian army inflicted a serious defeat on Stephen's army on 13 May. Lawrence died soon, possibly in either 1116 or 1117. Church reforms Large-scale church organizational reforms took place during the episcopate of Archbishop Lawrence. It is presumable that the so-called First and Second Synods of Esztergom, decrees of which was preserved at the earliest by the Pray Codex, were convened at the beginning of Lawrence's service as Archbishop of Esztergom. G√°bor Thoroczkay argues the first synod occurred around 1106 or 1107, which Lawrence and his ten suffragan bishops attended, according to the 15th-century Johannes de Thurocz's Chronica Hungarorum (despite that, formerly, historian Gyula Pauler rejected this and put the date of the first synod to the reign of Ladislaus I). According to Monika J√°nosi, the first synod summoned by 1112 at the latest, just before the establishment of the Diocese at Nyitra (Nitra), when the numbers of Hungarian bishops raised to twelve. As Thoroczkay notes, the description of the Chronica Hungarorum (ten bishops) is exaggerated, which reflects the Archdiocese of Esztergom's aspirations to become the only Metropolitan province. The first Zobor charter, issued by Lawrence's chancellery at the royal court, also styled Paul, the Archbishop of Kalocsa as simply \\"bishop\\". Lawrence had an important role in the convocation of the synod to provide and outline his efforts as newly elected archbishop. Excluding secular participants, the synod and its organizing method reflected the spirit of the Gregorian Reforms. Its seventy-two theses, for instance, contained the regulations of ecclesiastical jurisdiction, the way of life of the clergy and the definition of church property. The theses also proveed that canonical literature has spread during the primacy of Lawrence. The First Synod of Esztergom was influenced by the resolutions of the Councils of Piacenza (1095) and Poitiers (1100), while Lawrence and his prelates also utilized the texts of the Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals and the Collectio Dionysio-Hadriana. The liturgy rulebook Benedictionale Strigoniense () was written under the reign of Lawrence, sometime after 1108, according to historian Dorottya Uhrin, who also argues there was no a single \\"first council\\" at Esztergom, and its 68 or 72 decrees were adopted continuously in the occasions of several synods, throughout the years of the archiepiscopal tenure of Lawrence. Thereafter, the decrees were compiled in a single document. The Second Synod of Esztergom most probably took place in March 1112, when papal legate Cuno of Praeneste resided in Hungary on his way from Constantinople to Rome. Medievalists L√°szl√≥ Koszta and G√°bor Thoroczkay identified the synod with that meeting in Esztergom, where Cuno excommunicated Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor for the brief imprisonment of Pope Paschal. The sixteen theses of the second synod marked the strong influence of the Gregorian directives. The first three points strengthened the royal power in order to support Coloman against his claimant brother √Ålmos, who took assistance from the Holy Roman Empire. Other historians, such as Korn√©l Szov√°k and Dorottya Uhrin, deny the connection between the second synod and papal legate Cuno's activity in Hungary. Uhrin says, the so-called second synod was held during the last regnal years of King Coloman. Under Archbishop Lawrence, the formation of the church organization extended to Upper Hungary. The two documents of the Zobor Abbey show that Coloman set up the bishopric at Nyitra between 1111 and 1113, or a few years earlier. Its first bishop Gervasius' acts in lawsuits prove that he was considered Lawrence's suffragan bishop, as he functioned as a court of appeal in the cases involved by the Diocese of Nyitra. Since Lawrence's episcopate, tensions appear to have emerged between the sees Esztergom and Kalocsa. When Pope Paschal sent pallium to Ugolin around 1105‚Äì06 and demanded oath of fealty from him, Lawrence tried to prevent it. This rivalry also appeared in the coeval Life of King Stephen of Hungary, compiled by Hartvik, Bishop of Gy≈ër (thus a subordinate to Lawrence), when it derived the title of the superior of Kalocsa from Esztergom, emphasizing its subsidiarity. Lawrence refused to recognize the Archdiocese of Kalocsa as an equal see in the ecclesiastical hierarchy.

It is set in England and Northern Europe during the reign of Mary I and covers the period February 1555 to November 1558. Plot Summary The story opens in Warwickshire where 19 year old Francis Cludde lives with his uncle Sir Anthony and cousin Petronilla. He was left there eight years earlier by his father Ferdinand who then disappeared. His outspoken views get Francis into trouble during a visit from Mary's powerful Chancellor Stephen Gardiner, who advises him to leave England for his own good. Francis makes his way to London where he meets Catherine, Duchess of Suffolk who is being hunted by Gardiner's men. With Francis' help, she and her husband Bertram escape first to the Spanish Netherlands, then Wesel in Germany still pursued by a man called Clarence, Gardiner's chief agent. They eventually evade their pursuers and end up in what was then the Polish- Lithuania Commonwealth. The novel passes over the next two years resuming in autumn 1558 when Francis and Bertram return to England to join a conspiracy against Mary. Francis recognises Clarence posing as one of the plotters and denounces him only to discover 'Clarence' is actually his father Ferdinand. At this point, Mary's death brings her Protestant sister Elizabeth I to the throne, allowing Francis to return home. He releases Ferdinand who travels to Warwickshire and incites his brother Sir Anthony to resist the new regime. By doing so, he hopes his brother will be condemned as a traitor and to gain his property as a result. The story ends with Francis foiling this plot and marrying Petronilla, while Ferdinand disappears for good. This is one of Weyman's earlier works and reflects his typical strengths and weaknesses. As ever, the historical details are well researched, especially the character sketches of real figures like the Duchess of Suffolk and Bishop Gardiner and the portrayal of life in 16th century Holland both vivid and relatively uncommon. The plot moves along at a good speed but many of the characters are one dimensional and even by the standards of the time, the dialogue can seem contrived. Reception While it was reprinted in 1891, 1895 and 1911 Weyman's second novel was less successful than his previous effort 'House of the Wolf.' It was positively reviewed by Andrew Lang in the New Review and the US magazine Literary World; This historic novel is full of spirited adventure. Its boldness and bloodiness are sure to win it a welcome from young people. Its humor and faithful observance of old English style and careful adherence to historic events and localities will recommend it to all who are fond of historic novels.

It is the only Jacobean play to survive in manuscript form. Its first printing appears to be by A. H. Bullen in his A Collection of Old English Plays, Volume II (page 167 on). Bullen gives this text the title The Distracted Emperor, but on Egerton it is entitled simply, Charleymayne. Although in manuscript the play is anonymous, the script shows signs of a collaborative effort, with Act One possibly by George Chapman, and the rest by a young John Fletcher (or the usual suspects, Greene, Kidd, Lodge). It was printed for the Malone Society by John de Monins Johnson at the Oxford University Press in 1937. The play is animated by a myriad of political intrigue, suspicion and conspiracy in the medieval court of the ageing Charlemagne. Act I opens with news that Charlemagne has married Theodora, and at the heart of the play's machinations are the new empress's siblings, the Machiavellian Ganelon and Gabriella (in love with courtier Richard). In recognition of his help in arranging the royal marriage, Ganelon is promoted as Constable of France, and amid the euphoric atmosphere there comes news of Prince Orlando's conquests in Spain. In Act Two, a triumphant Orlando has reached the outskirts of Paris where his reflections on his love of Theodora are devastated by news of the birth to her of a son. Worse, she has died in childbirth, followed by the death of Charlemagne's mother. The emperor is utterly distraught, carrying his wife's corpse around - until that is, Richard discovers and removes a strange ring beneath her tongue. The effect is profound and immediate. Charlemagne becomes utterly focused and businesslike, yet, mysteriously falls in love with Bishop Turpin. Meanwhile Ganelon is placed under house-arrest for the attempted murder of Orlando. Act Three sees the emperor now in sharp mental decline, relying on the advice of sycophants like Turpin. Ganelon is further punished, heavily fined, stripped of all honours and forbidden to communicate with Richard. Nevertheless, Ganelon blesses the proposed marriage of his son, La Busse. Gabriella is in despair that she is forbidden even to meet her Richard. In the following act La Busse petitions Charlemagne to have his father's former wealth and titles restored (amid rumours that these are actually to be bestowed on Richard). While at first rejecting his overtures, Charlemagne bizarrely promises to assent to La Busse's request on that day when he meets the young man on an ass in a deserted country lane. Most of these and other heady machinations find their faltering denouement in Act Five, which opens with a botched ambush in which Richard, conspiring on behalf of Prince Orlando, is murdered by Ganelon. A letter is discovered on Richard's body incriminating Ganelon in a plot and imputing, his sister, Gabriella's whoring. She in fact admits the letter as her own fabrication for which he murders her, and he is promptly arrested. La Busse abases himself, as required, before Charlemagne, with the result that Ganelon is briefly pardoned - that is until Orlando announces the truth of the 'witchcraft ring' and of Ganelon's crimes. In a more or less happy ending, Charlemagne orders Ganelon to be 'broken on the wheel' and Orlando is rewarded with the governorship of Spain. Though not claiming anything like chronicle accuracy, the play does demonstrate a clearly assured dramaturgy in coping with its many plot twists. There is also a curious 'chaining' effect as characters replace each other in turn within a setting. The tentative dating of the play as 1600 is undermined by the many liftings from Shakespeare's Hamlet, Macbeth and King Lear. Curiously too it anticipates strong thematic elements of James I/VI court and reign. Act One's highly regular blank verse suggests Chapman's mighty line, but clearly there are other quills at work here.A. H.

Life  Born in 1906 in D√ºsseldorf, Mertens came from Catholic working-class roots in the Rhineland. His father was a steel worker and his mother came from a family of Jewish craftsmen. He was denied access to the Gymnasium for financial reasons. After commercial studies (1919-1922) and about six months in the missionary school of the Franciscan Order in Moresnet in 1923, he headed to Vienna to join the \\"Herrgottsknechten\\". These were young Catholics who did social work free of charge while renouncing official titles and organizational structure and leading a consciously modest life. In 1925, Mertens published the book \\"Ruf zur Wende ‚Äì Bl√§tter zur katholischen Erneuerung\\" (Call for a Change - Guide to Catholic Renewal). In Vienna he also joined a group affiliated with Catholic social reformer Anton Orel (1881-1959) publisher of the weekly \\"Das neue Volk\\" (The New People). Mertens however came to regard Orel's social-romantic anticapitalism as out-of-date and unsuitable for everyday living and, while preferring socialism to capitalism, nevertheless rejected the materialistic and atheistic elements of Marxist doctrine. Mertens was also repelled by Orel's anti-Semitism. In 1926, through the intervention of the People's Association for Catholic Germany, Mertens found a position in the mission department of the D√ºsseldorf office for the Union of Catholic Youth (Katholischen Jungm√§nnervereine). Because of his public support for socialism, he was soon dismissed at the instigation of General-President Ludwig Wolker (1887-1955). He then joined the editorial board of the Social Democratic \\"Rheinische Zeitung\\" on the recommendation of Wilhelm Sollmann (1881-1951) and became the editor of the supplement \\"The Tribune\\", an ongoing dialogue between Christians and socialists. He likely joined the Social Democratic Party at this time, though he remained a critic. In 1928 he founded the \\"Association of Catholic Socialists of Germany\\" and gave it a voice with the monthly publication \\"Red Book of Catholic Socialists\\" (Roten Blatt der katholischen Sozialisten). The association's headquarters was located in Cologne and members came mainly from the ranks of the Social Democrats. Some young chaplains also contributed under pseudonyms. The Red Book, which was published from January 1929 until November / December 1930, had about 1800 subscribers, predominantly Catholic corporations, intellectuals, and Catholic and Protestant theologians. In January 1931, the \\"Red Book\\" was merged with the \\"Newspaper for Religion and Socialism\\", a voice for Protestant socialists, published by Georg W√ºnsch in 1929. The publisher was W√ºnsch, and Heinrich Mertens took the lead. A prominent member of the association was Ernst Michel, head of the \\"Academy of Labour\\" founded by the unions in Frankfurt in 1921. Their goal of combining Catholic faith with socialist thought was, however, achieved only to a limited extent. The Social Democratic Party showed little interest in the organization because it could not demonstrate significant growth in party membership, and on the Catholic side, the 1931 papal encyclical \\"Quadragesimo anno\\" emphasized the fundamental incompatibility of Christianity and socialism. As a scholar supported by the Abraham Lincoln Stiftung (endowed by the Rockefeller Foundation), Mertens studied philosophy, economics, pedagogy and psychology during the summer semester of 1932 in Frankfurt. On the basis of his high examination scores, he was admitted to university in the spring of 1932 without a certificate of matriculation. In the Mainmetropole, he worked especially at the Institute for Social Research, where he also made contacts with Theodor W. Adorno and Max Horkheimer. However, after the Nazi seizure of power in 1933 and the subsequent cancellation of the Lincoln scholarship funds for political reasons, he was forced to leave early. Later Mertens got a job at the Frankfurter Sender newspaper. While in this position he even joined the Sturmabteilung and hoped vainly for a \\"second revolution\\" within National Socialism, of socialists against nationalists. In February 1936, Mertens was arrested by the Gestapo as part of the trial of the Catholic priest Joseph Rossaint (1902-1991) on the charge of high treason. Mertens was accused of having illegal Marxist ambitions, but he was released again after a month-and- a-half. During the Second World War, Mertens found a job at the office of the Berliner publishing house. He made contact here with various resistance groups and provided assistance to Jews living undercover. With the end of the war, Heinrich Mertens was appointed mayor of Eisleben by the US armed forces on April 14, 1945, a position which he held until 31 October. He participated in the founding of the Liberal Democratic Party of Germany (LDP). As the LDP candidate he succeeded Theodor Lieser as mayor of Haale, and after the local electoral victory by the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, became on 26 September 1946 the mayor of by Jena. In 1947, he fled with his wife Maria and two daughters to the West. Among other roles, he was a correspondent for Die Welt, head of the press department for the German Trade Union Confederation, employee at Westdeutscher Rundfunk Cologne; publisher of the newspaper \\"Ost- West-Handel\\" (East-West Trade). At this time, he was once again active in the SPD. He was close to the future Minister President of North Rhine-Westphalia, Heinz K√ºhn (SPD). He died in 1968 in Austria in a traffic accident.

The Cordillera autonomy movement in the Philippines refers to the campaign for greater autonomy for the Cordilleras. The 1986 Constitution allows for the establishment of two autonomous regions in the country; Muslim Mindanao and in the Cordilleras. Two plebiscites (1990 and 1998) were conducted in the Cordillera to legalize the autonomous status of the area where majority of the voters rejected autonomy. The area is currently under the jurisdiction of the Cordillera Administrative Region. There are still efforts from some local sectors to establish an autonomous region in the Cordillera. Background An old U.S. Army map showing Mountain province covering the present areas of Benguet, Ifugao, Kalinga and Apayao During the Spanish colonial era, the Spaniards referred to the inhabitants of the Cordilleras as the Ygorrottes or the Igorots while the Americans starting 1908 have governed the area as part of a single locality called as the Mountain Province. People from outside the region, or the lowlanders as they are known in the Cordillera, often referred all ethnic people in the area under the single label, Igorot. Unlike the people in the southern Philippines, the Moro who organized themselves in large polities such as sultanates, the Cordilleran people had independent tribes governed by tribal councils. These are among the facts use to argue for a pan-Cordillera identity. Cordillera conflict There is a movement for self-determination among the people of the Cordilleras in Luzon, however there were no secessionists in the region calling for the independence of the Cordilleras from the Philippines. The armed Cordillera struggle was derived from the CPP- NPA-NDF conflict during the regime of President Ferdinand Marcos. The Communist Party of the Philippines and the New People's Army's goal was to overthrow the Marcos, fight what they perceive as imperialism of the United States, after which they plan to establish a people's democratic republic. The affiliate of the National Democratic Front, the Cordillera People's Democratic Front aimed for the \\"liberation\\" of the country along with the Cordilleras from these twin challenges according to its 1981 eight-point general program. The Cordillera People‚Äôs Liberation Army, a group which separated from the NPA in 1986, along with the Montanosa National Solidarity and the Cordillera Bodong Administration fought for greater autonomy in the Cordillera and against what it perceive as internal colonialism by the Philippine central government. The CPLA advocated utilization and stewardship of lands by communes as opposed to private proprietorship and the direct democracy through village assemblies and council of elders. It also promoted the bodong system as a \\"supra-tribal expression\\" of the \\"spirit of social cooperation\\". They also proposed the conversion of the country into a federal republic as an alternative with each state having co-equal status. On September 13, 1986 the CPLA and the Government of the Philippines made a \\"sipat\\" or cessation of hostilities in Mt. Data Hotel, in Bauko, Mountain Province. The agreement between the two entities were dubbed as the 1986 Mount Data Peace Accord. Furthermore, the Manabo pagta or covenant was signed on December 1, 1986 in Manabo, Abra by local tribal elders. Establishment of the Cordillera Administrative Region The Mount Data Peace Accord and the Manabo Pagta lead to the establishment of the Cordillera Administrative Region through the issuance of Executive Order 220 on July 15, 1987 by then President Corazon C. Aquino with the intention of converting the region to an autonomous one. The provinces of Abra, Benguet and Mountain Province (of the Ilocos Region), and Ifugao and Kalinga-Apayao (of the Cagayan Valley) were annexed as part of the newly created region. Several attempts at legalizing autonomy in the Cordillera region have failed in two separate plebiscites. An affirmative vote for the law on regional autonomy is a precondition by the 1987 Philippine Constitution to give the region autonomy in self-governance much like the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao in southern Philippines. The first law Republic Act No. 6766, took effect on October 23, 1989 but failed to muster a majority vote in the plebiscite on January 30, 1990. The second law, Republic Act No. 8438 passed by Congress of the Philippines on December 22, 1997, also failed to pass the approval of the Cordillera peoples in a region-wide referendum on March 7, 1998. In 2018, referendum and political analysts have stated that \\"people‚Äôs lack of understanding of the autonomy issue, compounded by misinformation drives by some sectors\\", was the primary factor against Cordillera autonomy.https://news.mb.com.ph/2018/08/26/cordillera-autonomous- regions-time-has-come-1/ Continued campaign for Cordillera autonomy A closure agreement between the CPLA and the Government of the Philippines was signed on July 4, 2011 at the Rizal Hall in Malaca√±an Palace. The agreement calls for the disarmament of the group, the reintegration of the militants into mainstream society and the conversion of the militant group into a socio- economic organization. While the group has stopped armed confrontation, the CPLA remain extant as of 2013 still campaigning for greater autonomy in the Cordilleras with about 1,000 members. There are efforts to make a third bid to legalize autonomy in the Cordillera. Bills to establish an Organic Act for an autonomous region in Cordillera was filed; House Bill No. 5595 filed during the 15th Congress and House Bill No. 4649 in 2014 during the 16th Congress both of which failed to pass. The latest attempt is House Bill No. 5343, \\"An Act Establishing the Autonomous Region of the Cordillera (ARC)\\" which was filed on March 20, 2017 during the First Regular Session of the 17th Congress. The latest bill is supported by all House representatives from the Cordilleras.https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1084458/gauge-views-on-autonomy- cordillera-leaders-askedhttps://pia.gov.ph/news/articles/1011735 Additionally, for the first time in history, all provincial and city governments throughout the Cordilleras also support Cordilleran autonomy.http://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1041439http://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1041552 A declaration to expressed support for the establishment of the Autonomous Region of the Cordillera (ARC) as part of the President Rodrigo Duterte-led process of shifting the form of governance of the Philippines to federalism from the presidential setup to federalism was signed on April 24, 2017 by about 200 local officials, tribal leaders, and civil society organizations at Mount Datu. There has also been a campaign to include Nueva Vizcaya into the Cordilleras as the province is culturally and geographically part of the Cordilleras and not the Cagayan Valley.

Themes and Motifs   Death  The role of the supernatural, specifically pertaining to death, is heavily explored through the stories' spiritual connotations. For example, Ward G4 surrounds the Ghanaian belief of Azara-il, the female embodiment of death. Yaro's belief in Azara-il and his ability to predict death allude to the Ghanaian spirituality and African Folklore embedded within the novel.  Immigration into Western Culture  A major theme in this book involves the struggle for Ghanaian immigrants who are moving to a Western society, which is generally for financial benefit or further opportunity for education or work. An example of this theme is demonstrated in Rachmaninov when Felix moves to Manhattan to pursue a career in art. However, when he becomes entangled in the social aspects of Western culture, he finds himself failing financially and his career stalls. Similarly, the theme of immigration to Western culture is evident within Ali's writing style. In Mallam Sile, Ali explains Ghanaian terminology such as \\"juju\\" to aid in the Western reader's understanding of the novel.  Race, Religion, Historical Context  Mohammed Ali's book is heavily influenced by race, religion and historical context. In his book, many of the characters, specifically Ghanaian Americans, struggle with understanding and exploring their Islamic identity and beliefs, while also combatting assimilation into Western-American culture. This is exemplified in Faith, when Suf-yan's life in Brooklyn continues to distance him from his culture and the values he was taught. Race and its significance in terms of social hierarchy are also brought to the readers' attention in the story, Live In, when Shatu is forced to live and work in America in order to send money home. The job she receives, however, is of a low ranking quality in the eyes of Westerners and puts her at a much lower pay grade than other jobs.  African Diaspora  This book illustrates the African Diaspora, which refers to the movement of peoples from Africa into the West, throughout various stories in the book. Examples of African diaspora can be found in the story Live In through Shatu's work as a maid for an American woman as a means to send funds to her family in Ghana. A second example of African diaspora can be seen in the story Faith, when Suf- yan abandons his culture and religion after immigrating to the U.S. Mohamed Naseehu Ali's book examines two forms of immigration, leaving home and returning home.

It is situated on the oldest existing bridge site across the Rhine, between Lake Constance and the North Sea. The Modern Bridge Old Rhine Bridge before 1903 Temporary bridge - 1903-1905 Between 1903 and 1905, the old bridge underwent a renovation project during which it was rebuilt entirely out of stone. The new construction was named ¬´Middle Rhine Bridge¬ª. The old bridge was simply named the ¬´Rhine Bridge¬ª back when it was the sole bridge in Basel crossing the river; later, when the Wettstein and Johanniter bridges were built, it became known as the ¬´Old Rhine Bridge¬ª. The name ¬´Middle Rhine Bridge¬ª was chosen because three bridges spanned the Rhein in Basel at the time,The 2 other bridges spanning the Rhine were the Wettsteinbr√ºcke and the Johanniterbr√ºcke. the rail bridge was located further outside of the city at the time and thus was not considered when the Middle Bridge was being named. and this one was situated in the middle of the other two bridges.www.ralu.ch The bridge is 192 meters long and 18.8 meters wide and is built out of granite from the north face of Saint-Gotthard Massif. The construction was undertaken by Albert Buss & Cie. from Pratteln and Philipp Holzmann from Frankfurt am Main, and cost 2.67 million Francs. The bridge features seven arches - six of which stretch across the Rhine, and one which stands over the riverside footpath on the New Town side. A reproduction of the bridge's Br√ºckenkapellea small chapel building traditionally built near a bridge known as the K√§ppelijoch, was built over the central support of the bridge. The bridge is a great work of historic bridge construction in Switzerland. Architectural and city planning deliberations played a decisive role in the choice of building materials and general design to be used for the bridge: in order to avoid interfering with the image of the old town, Emil Faesch from Basel was chosen to build the stonework of the bridge, while Friedrich von Thiersch from Munich was chosen to build its modern iron truss skeleton. Construction In order to avoid disrupting traffic over the Rhine, a temporary replacement bridge was constructed over twelve wooden truss supports a few meters away from the original bridge. The completed Bridge was unveiled to the public on the 11. November 1905 during a fair. Renovation Modern Middle Bridge - BaselThe bridge was refurbished with no alterations made to its appearance in 2002. The bridge has been closed to private motor vehicles as part of the car free city centre since the start of 2015. The pavements were widened by 40cm at the cost of road space in the summer of 2017. Art =¬´Amazone¬ª= Carl Burckhardt AmazoneThe Amazon sculpture by Carl Burckhardt, shown leading a horse, can be found by the Old Town Bridgehead. It was commissioned by the Basel art society and depicts a striding Amazon leading a horse. Burckhardt completed the plaster model for the statue, but succumbed to a short illness in 1923 before it was cast. The bronze cast was finalised after his death. There are visible trowl marks left over from the plaster model which Burckhardt likely would have removed had he not died before its completion. The Amazon would have also held slack reins in her hands. It is assumed that the sculpture remains uncompleted. The Amazon was Burckhardt's last work. It was originally intended to be installed in the garden of the Kunsthalle, but due to the sudden unexpected death of its artist, the arts society donated it to the canton, which installed it in its present location. The piece has no relation to its current location and is purely considered a public art installation, sometimes mockingly referred to as Street furniture.www.altbasel.ch =¬´Helvetia auf der Reise¬ª= Helvetia auf der ReiseThe sculpture Helvetia auf der Reise by Bettina Eichin was originally a 1980 entry in the Kunstkredit, an art competition in Basel. It depicts a woman who has laid her suitcase down, sitting pensively on a wall on the New Town bridgehead and looking out across the Rhine. The tablet mounted on the wall next to the figure reads \\"One day, Helvetia leaves the two franc coin, walks among the people, and embarks upon a long journey. On the way she travels through Basel. After a tiring walk through the city, she takes her coat off, lays down her suitcase and her spear and shield, and rests upon a pier on the Middle Bridge, looking thoughtfully up the Rhine‚Ä¶\\"www.ralu.ch Bettina Eichin, whose art has always been politically conscious, said in an interview in 2010 \\"With the Helvetia allegory, I wanted to make the Helvetia allegory on our coins a woman again, to lift her from her embossing, for her to free herself - exactly how we women did. Only a few people 30 years ago understood what I wanted to express with the Helvetia sculpture. [‚Ä¶] She steps out from the embossing of the coin - from money, goes on her way and rests upon her pedestal, tired, thoughtful, and distant - qualities that are not valued in women.

While on the Seneca, Jennings took care of hundreds of wounded and ill patients despite an almost complete lack of medical resources. __TOC__  Background and Early Life  Janet Jennings was born in 1842 in Green County, Wisconsin, where she grew up in a family of twelve children. Jennings started her career as a teacher in Monroe, Wisconsin, but she later left for Washington, D.C. to join the American Red Cross and help care for one of her brothers, who was wounded in the war. As a member of the Red Cross, Jennings was an associate of Clara Barton, and aided other wounded soldiers in the American Civil War. Jennings stayed in Washington D.C. after the end of the Civil War to work as a reporter at the United States Department of the Treasury, later reporting for various newspapers.  Nursing in the Spanish American War  After the outbreak of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Jennings searched for ways she could support the war effort as a nurse. She left for Cuba as part of the Red Cross in June 1898. After fighting in Santiago, the medical ship Relief was supposed to leave to bring wounded to the U.S., but with more fighting expected, the ship was told to stay in Santiago. Instead of the Relief with its updated and adequate medical supplies, the Seneca was chosen to transport the injured troops back to the United States. On July 13, Jennings volunteered to help on the Seneca and tend to the wounded as they were brought back to the U.S. The ship was over capacity with injured soldiers, understaffed with doctors and nurses, and without adequate medical equipment. Due to the lack of doctors and nurses on board, Jennings worked around the clock in an attempt to help as many patients as possible. After six nights at sea, the ship finally made port near New York City. Forty of the soldiers on the ship wrote her a letter, thanking her for the heroism she showed in the dire situation. Newspapers across the country heralded her as the ‚ÄúAngel of Seneca‚Äù for saving numerous lives during her week aboard the Seneca.  Journalism  A picture from Abraham Lincoln - the greatest American (1909) After leaving the Treasury Department, Jennings began working as a reporter. Jennings was a journalist for several newspapers including the New-York Tribune, the Independent (New York City), and the Chicago Herald - Tribune. When Jennings volunteered to go with the Red Cross to Cuba, her intention was to travel to Cuba as a reporter for the Red Cross‚Äôs work, despite the restrictions on female reporters at the time. After returning from Cuba on the Seneca, Jennings wrote a statement about the injustice of sending wounded soldiers back on ships with insufficient medical and other resources. In addition to her work writing for newspapers, Jennings wrote two books, Abraham Lincoln, the Greatest American and The Blue and the Gray.  Death  Jennings died in 1917 of a stroke. She is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Green County, Wisconsin next to her parents and siblings.

Fernand Faure became director of the journal from 1901. He held this position until 1911. In the early 1900s the journal published the competing views of Ferdinand Buisson, Charles Dupuy and Ren√© Goblet on the role of the church in education.

Description  Carvings on the side of the Govan sarcophagus The stones are thought to have been created to commemorate the power and wealth of the rulers of the lost Kingdom of Strathclyde. Forty-five stones existed as late as the 1980s. However, many were destroyed when the neighbouring Harland and Wolff shipyard was demolished in 1973 and the stones were mistaken for debris. One was rediscovered by a fourteen-year-old schoolboy in 2019, working as part of a ‚ÄòStones and Bones‚Äô archaeology and heritage programme, prompting hopes that more of the stones had survived. The remaining stones are a sarcophagus, five hogback stones and thirty-one recumbent gravestones. Each stone weighs half a ton. and is carved with elaborate designs of carved crosses and cross shafts. The Govan sarcophagus The centrepiece of the collection is the sarcophagus, which is thought to commemorate St. Constantine, the son of Pictish king Kenneth MacAlpin. It features carvings of hunting scenes and warrior figures. Carved from solid stone, the sarcophagus is the only one of its kind from pre-Norman, Northern Britain.  History  The stones have been dated back to the 9th‚Äì11th centuries when the Vikings raided the Clyde region. The Vikings destroyed Dumbarton, at the mouth of the Clyde, in 870 AD. This fortress, known as Alt Clut, was the centre of an ancient kingdom of Britons. With the king of Alt Clut, Artgal, either killed or enslaved by the Vikings, Govan, further up the river, gained great strategic importance as a new dynasty was established in the Kingdom of Strathclyde. Govan Parish Church became an important ecclesiastical centre for this new kingdom. The presence of the five hogback stones in Govan suggests the area was settled, or at least partly settled, by Vikings. These large sandstone blocks were found exclusively in areas of Northern Britain where the Vikings settled and were used to make tombs look like mighty buildings in the Norse style. Nowhere else are there hogback stones quite as large as the five in Govan. Hogback stones within the nave > \\"It underpins this idea that this British kingdom of Strathclyde has some > strong connections with the Scandinavian world. My feeling is that this is > meant to represent a lord's hall or a chieftain's hall.\\" - Stephen Driscoll, > professor of historical archaeology at Glasgow University. The sarcophagus was discovered in the graveyard in 1855 when a grave was being dug to the south east of the church. Recognising their significance and to protect the stones from the elements, they were moved from the surrounding graveyard and placed on display within the church itself in 1926. Until that point, the stones had lain undisturbed for over a thousand years.  Scotland's hidden gems  The British Museum affirmed the importance of the collection when they took one of the hogback stones to London as part of the exhibition Vikings: Life and Legend (March 2014 to June 2014). In August 2017, the Govan Stones were voted Scotland's best 'hidden gem' in a nationwide competition, receiving more than two thousand votes in the nationwide poll. They have been described as of international significance.

History The medieval gate The hospital was built on a site previously occupied by Greyfriars, Stamford and donated by the Marquess of Exeter. It was funded by a bequest from the will of surgeon Henry Fryer, designed by John Peter Gandy and opened in 1828. Between 1876 and 1879 the hospital was expanded with the addition of three fever ward blocks, under architect Edward Browning with input from surgeon Dr William Newman. The wards incorporated a number of features such as centralised ward interiors and glazed internal walling, and were cited as an exemplar of single-block planning for small hospitals, particular by Henry Burdett. The fever wards are Grade II listed and are a testament to how voluntary hospitals dealt with nineteenth century epidemics of contagious disease. A substantial redevelopment of the hospital was completed in July 2017, which included new imaging facilities, including a permanent MRI scanning suite, and cancer treatment facilities. Services The hospital provides a minor injuries unit, large scale outpatient services and day-case surgery, with the largest pain management centre in the region. It also has a medicine for the elderly ward with 22 intermediate care beds. The trust's largest hospital, Peterborough City Hospital, provides the majority of emergency and inpatient services in the area; the two together thus provide a comprehensive suite of services in a predominantly \\"hot\\" and \\"cold\\" split.

The researcher noticed a flaw in the authentication process, which allowed the researcher to hijack an account by trying to login with another phone number and intercepting the verification SMS text message that, under specific conditions, remained in the outbox of the Symbian phone after the WhatsApp client would attempt to send it to itself. On Android, the verification message could be obtained through reading the \\"radio\\" with a tool named \\"logcat\\". The researcher would then copy and send the intercepted verification message to the real number of the phone, using an SMS gateway to spoof the \\"sender\\" phone number to the number the researcher tried to maliciously login with. This method worked, and WhatsApp issued a patch within one day after publication of the articles, to both the Android and Symbian clients. WhatsApp did have a security mechanism, by design, which would disable the account on the phone of the original owner of the phone number, when they had a WhatsApp account. In May 2011, another security hole was reported which left communication through WhatsApp susceptible to packet analysis. WhatsApp communications were not encrypted, and data was sent and received in plaintext, meaning messages could easily be read if packet traces were available. 2012 In May 2012 security researchers noticed that new updates of WhatsApp no longer sent messages as plaintext, but the cryptographic method implemented was subsequently described as \\"broken\\". In August 2012 the WhatsApp support staff said that messages were encrypted in the \\"latest version\\" of the WhatsApp software for iOS and Android (but not BlackBerry, Windows Phone, and Symbian), without specifying the cryptographic method. On January 6, 2012, an unknown hacker published a website that made it possible to change the status of an arbitrary WhatsApp user, as long as the phone number was known. To make it work, it only required a restart of the app. According to the hacker, it was only one of many security problems in WhatsApp. On January 9, WhatsApp reported that it had resolved the problem, although the only measure actually taken was to block the website's IP address. As a reaction, a Windows tool was made available for download providing the same functionality. This problem has since been resolved in the form of an IP address check on currently logged-in sessions. German Tech site The H demonstrated how to use WhatsAPI to hijack any WhatsApp account on September 14, 2012. Shortly after, a legal threat to WhatsAPI's developers was alleged, characterized by The H as \\"an apparent reaction\\" to security reports, and WhatsAPI's source code was taken down for some days. The WhatsAPI team has since returned to active development. 2013‚Äì2015 On March 31, 2013 the Saudi Arabian Communications and Information Technology Commission (CITC) issued a statement regarding possible measures against WhatsApp, among other applications, unless the service providers took serious steps to comply with monitoring and privacy regulations. In February 2014, the public authority for data privacy of the German state of Schleswig-Holstein advised against using WhatsApp, as the service lacked privacy protection such as end-to-end client side encryption technology.ULD empfiehlt nach dem WhatsApp-Facebook-Deal: ‚ÄûWechseln‚Äú (German) WhatsApp started implementing end- to-end encryption in late 2014 and finished in April 2016. A major privacy and security problem has been the subject of a joint Canadian-Dutch government investigation. The primary concern was that WhatsApp required users to upload their mobile phone's entire address book to WhatsApp servers so that WhatsApp could discover who, among the users' contacts, was available via WhatsApp. While this was a fast and convenient way to quickly find and connect the user with contacts who were also using WhatsApp, it meant that their address book was then mirrored on the WhatsApp servers, including contact information for contacts who were not using WhatsApp. This information, which consisted solely of phone numbers without any additional information such as the name of the contact, was stored in hashed, though not salted, form. Late 2015, the Dutch government released a press-statement claiming that WhatsApp had changed its hashing method, making it much harder to reverse, and thus now fully complies with all rules and regulations. A user does not need to send a friend request to send messages to another user, due to the contact discovery mentioned above. In November 2014, WhatsApp introduced a feature named Read Receipts which alerts senders when their messages are read by recipients. Within a week, WhatsApp introduced an update allowing users to disable this feature so that message recipients do not send acknowledgements. On December 1, 2014, Indrajeet Bhuyan and Saurav Kar, both 17 years old, demonstrated the WhatsApp Message Handler Vulnerability, which allows anyone to remotely crash WhatsApp just by sending a specially crafted message of 2kb in size. To escape the problem, the user who receives the specially crafted message has to delete his/her whole conversation and start a fresh chat, because opening the message keeps on crashing WhatsApp unless the chat is deleted completely. In early 2015, after WhatsApp launched a web client that can be used from the browser, Bhuyan also found that it had two security issues that compromised user privacy: the WhatsApp Photo Privacy Bug and the WhatsApp Web Photo Sync Bug. In February 2015, a Dutch university student named Maikel Zweerink published an app that set out to prove that anyone could track a WhatsApp user's status and also keep an eye of their changing profile pictures, privacy settings or status messages regardless of their privacy settings. 2016 On March 2, 2016, WhatsApp introduced its document-sharing feature, initially allowing users to share PDF files with their contacts. However, WhatsApp's default state of automatically downloading attachments raised some concerns in the press about risk and security once support for document sharing expanded beyond PDF files. In August 2016, WhatsApp announced that it will start sharing account information with Facebook, consisting of the phone number of the account owner and aggregated analytical data. The address books and metadata of users are not shared. According to WhatsApp, this account information is shared to \\"track basic metrics about how often people use our services and better fight spam on WhatsApp. And by connecting your phone number with Facebook's systems, Facebook can offer better friend suggestions and show you more relevant ads if you have an account with them.\\" This means that Facebook can target advertisements on the Facebook Platform better by making links between users based on the phone numbers, and make \\"friend suggestions\\" to its users based on WhatsApp's data. User data will not be shared with advertisers, and is only used internally on the Facebook services. WhatsApp emphasizes the content of user messages is still kept private thanks to its end-to-end encryption, which means WhatsApp cannot read the content of chats. However, users are given the choice to opt out of sharing this data with Facebook for advertisement purposes. In October 2016, Article 29 Working Party stated that it has serious concerns regarding the manner in which the information relating to the updated Terms of Service and Privacy Policy was provided to users and consequently about the validity of the users‚Äô consent.https://www.cnil.fr/sites/default/files/atoms/files/20161027_letter_of_the_chair_of_the_art_29_wp_whatsapp.pdf From April 5, 2016, end-to-end encryption for all users' communications, including file transfers and voice calls, is supported for users of the latest client, encryption being enabled by default. It uses Curve25519 for key exchange, HKDF for generation of session keys (AES-256 in CBC mode for encryption and HMAC-SHA256 for integrity verification) and SHA512 for generating the two 30 digit fingerprints of both users' identity keys so they can verify each other as needed. Even the company would be unable to decrypt users' communications. Amnesty International and security professionals praised the move; the US Federal Bureau of Investigation criticised it as threatening the work of law enforcement. Telegram, another messaging service, is reported by the BBC to be used by \\"Islamic State\\" extremists. WhatsApp is not the only messaging service that provides end-to-end encryption; among others, Threema, Wickr, Signal, Silent Phone, and Line also provide such encryption by default. iMessage and Viber provide it under special circumstances. Telegram provides end-to-end encryption as an opt-in feature, but does not support end-to-end encrypted group messaging. , WhatsApp has a score of 6 out of 7 points on the Electronic Frontier Foundation's \\"Secure Messaging Scorecard\\". It has received points for having communications encrypted in transit, having communications encrypted with keys the provider doesn't have access to, allowing users to verify contacts' identities, having past messages secure if the encryption keys are stolen, having completed a recent independent security audit, and having the security designs properly documented. It is missing a point because the code is not open to independent review. 2017 On January 13, 2017, The Guardian reported that security researcher Tobias Boelter had found that WhatsApp's policy of forcing re- encryption of initially undelivered messages, without informing the recipient, constituted a serious loophole whereby WhatsApp could disclose, or be compelled to disclose, the content of these messages. WhatsApp and Open Whisper Systems officials disagreed with this assessment. A follow-up article by Boelter himself explained in greater detail what he considered to be the specific vulnerability. This article has since been removed by The Guardian due to the inaccuracies in Boelter's representation of the facts. After complaints from 73 renowned security researchers, The Guardian was forced to substantially revise and correct their own articles as well. Therefore, in June 2017, The Guardian readers‚Äô editor Paul Chadwick wrote that \\"The Guardian was wrong to report in January that the popular messaging service WhatsApp had a security flaw so serious that it was a huge threat to freedom of speech.\\" Chadwick also noted that since the Guardian article, WhatsApp has been \\"better secured by the introduction of optional two-factor verification in February.\\" However, it is important to note that this feature was already introduced in public beta versions of WhatsApp as early as November 2016, which was months before The Guardian wrote about the alleged issue. On January 15, 2017, a research team from Ruhr University Bochum published a security analysis of group messaging protocols in WhatsApp, Signal, and Threema. Among other deficiencies, they found out that WhatsApp's servers effectively control the membership in groups. Consequently, the server can add arbitrary other phone numbers to groups (including itself) such that future communication becomes insecure. Even though such manipulations could be detected, it weakens the end-to-end security guarantees. In October 2017, the German software company Open-Xchange criticised WhatApps and Slack for using proprietary software and stated plans to create an open source alternative.https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/10/12/openxchange_imap_chat_killer_app/ 2019 In May 2019, it was revealed that there was a security vulnerability in WhatsApp, allowing a remote person to install a spyware just by making a call which does not even need to be answered. Later, in June 2019, another vulnerability was revealed, allowing a user to transform an audio call into a video call, without the victim consent and without the victim noticing. A bug bounty of 5000 USD was offered for this bug. In June 2019, WhatsApp announced that it would take legal action against users who send disproportionately high number of messages using their communication platform. The company reiterated that its platform was meant for private messaging or for businesses to interact with their customers through their business app. In a notification on their website the company stated \\"Beginning on December 7 2019, WhatsApp will take legal action against those we determine are engaged in or assisting others in abuse that violates our terms of service, such as automated or bulk messaging\\".

Albert G√ºnther described it as Cacophis modesta in 1872, from specimens collected in northwestern Australia. The specific name modesta is the Latin adjective \\"unassuming\\", \\"orderly\\", or \\"well-behaved\\", regarded as apt by toxicologist Struan Sutherland, as the snake generally does not bite people. Meanwhile, Charles Walter De Vis described Brachysoma sutherlandi from Carl Creek, Norman River in northwestern Queensland in 1884, and William Macleay described Furina ramsayi, naming it after Edward Pierson Ramsay, in 1885 from a collection from Milparinka in northwestern New South Wales. All three are the same species. Reaching around 50 cm (20 in) in length, the ringed brown snake has grey-brown to red-brown upperparts with a black head and neck split by a cream band, as well as four to seven black bands with cream margins at regular intervals down the length of its body. Its underparts are cream to yellow splotched with orange. The upper dark bands may fade markedly with age. Its colour and markings, particularly its black head and neck band, resemble the juvenile eastern brown snake. The ringed brown snake is found in arid regions across inland Australia (except Victoria). It lives in arid shrubland or grassland, where it hides in spinifex or under fallen timber.

This classification has been followed by subsequent authors. Genetic analysis indicates that Ingram's brown snake is a diverged from the ancestor of all other brown snakes except the more basal ringed brown snake (P. modesta) and speckled brown snake (P. guttata). Description Ingram's brown snake grows to long. It has a grey-brown to dark brown head and nape, black-brown to golden brown upper parts. It has 17 rows of dorsal scales at midbody, 190 to 220 ventral scales, 55 to 70 divided subcaudal scales (occasionally some of the anterior ones are undivided), and a divided anal scale.Cogger HG (2014). Reptiles and Amphibians of Australia, Seventh Edition. Clayton, Victoria, Australia: CSIRO Publishing. xxx + 1,033 pp. . (Pseudonaja ingrami, p. 925). Distribution and habitat P. ingrami is native to a broad swathe of inland Australia, from northwestern Queensland to northeastern Western Australia. It lives in tussock grasslands on black soil, retreating into earth crevices. Feeding Ingram's brown snake eats small birds and mammals. Reproduction P. ingrami is oviparous, with clutches ranging between 12 and 18 eggs.

Early life Nellie McAleney was born in Riverton, Illinois, the daughter of Hamilton Hugh McAleney and Mary Elizabeth Evans McAleney. Her father was an Irish-born Civil War veteran;Report of the Board of Managers of the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers for the Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 1894 (US Government Printing Office 1894): 498.

She is one of the founders of El Pueblo in the current city of Pueblo, Colorado. She managed a ranch, the Doyle Settlement, in her later years. Early life and relationships Sandoval was born in 1811 at Taos, New Mexico to Gervasio Sandoval and Ramona Barela. Around 1824 or 1828 Teresita Sandoval married Jos√© Manuel Suazo and they had four children, Juana \\"Juanita\\" Mar√≠a Suazo (1828-1916), Mar√≠a de la Cruz, Jos√© Thomas, and Rufina. The family moved to Mora, New Mexico. Sandoval met Mathew Kinkead, a Kentucky native, about 1835. They had an affair, thus ending her marriage with Suaso. Sandoval and Kinkead had two children together named Juan Andr√©s (born November 29, 1835) and Rafaela.Baca (1998), p. 9 Juan Andr√©s, also called Andrew, was born while Sandoval was still living with her husband. When it was known that the baby was the son of Kinkead, Sandoval moved out of the house and lived with Kinkead. Suaso died in 1844. In 1838, Kinkead owned three hundred sheep and a yoke of oxen, which he obtained from the sale of his house and land. The sheep grazed in pasture land along the Mora River. There was increased anti-American sentiment due to rumors that soldiers from the Republic of Texas were going to attack New Mexico. Kinkead began to fear both New Mexican people and Texans, who were described as a desperate band of men. Pueblo area settlements In 1841, Kinkead established a farm in Rock Canyon along the Arkansas River, six miles above the mouth of Fountain Creek, at future site of the Goodnight Rock Canon Ranch near the present-day Pueblo Reservoir. He had Dick Wooten trade his sheep for milk cows in Kansas City and deliver them to the farm, where he began to raise buffalo after taking calves from herds. Buffalo calves would suckle on cows and grew to be stronger than oxen. Wooten was probably his employee at the ranch, and Francisco Conn was likely his partner. Sandoval and her daughters were among the first women of European descent in the Arkansas Valley. The others were Louisa Sandoval and Rumalda L√≥pez Fisher.Lecompte (1980), p. 44. Sandoval and Kinkead followed buffalo herds on the plains and captured newborn calves. They were in danger of attack from the buffalo and Native Americans. Sandoval was known for her courage.Lecompte (1980), pp. 67, 73. Once they were about a year old, they were sold in Missouri for $100 each. He sold 44 buffalo in the spring of 1842. El Pueblo was believed to have looked like the Mexican Ranch by Colonel Henry Inman, published in The Old Santa Fe Trail, 1897Lecompte (1980), p. 51. Sandoval and Kinkead were among the founders of El Pueblo trading post, the present Pueblo, Colorado. Sandoval helped build and manage the fort. She played an instrumental role in the daily operations of the post, interacting with Native Americans, trappers, residents, businessmen, and famous American West characters. Goods traded at the fort included buffalo fur and leather, food, jewelry, and tools. The life included hard work and defense against Native Americans who defended their ancestral hunting grounds. She lived at the trading post with her children and parents. Two of Sandoval's daughters were married at a young age. Juana was married before her 15th birthday to George Simpson by November 1842; Cruz married Joseph Doyle. Both men were residents of El Pueblo. Alexander Barclay Later, around 1843, Sandoval met Alexander Barclay, a British trader. In 1844, Sandoval, a 33-year-old grandmother, moved with Barkley to Hardscrabble,Lecompte (1980), p. 125. where Barclay and Sandoval's son-in-laws built the settlement. Sandoval helped establish the settlement at Hardscrabble and Greenhorn. At Hardscrabble, they operated a store, raised horses and cows, and grew crops. Native Americans and wolves depleted their stock, and they had difficulty with most of their crops. Kinkead had moved to California with their son, Juan. Barclay reportedly moved to New Mexico to built a permanent house for Sandoval. In 1848, Barclay and Doyle built Fort Barclay in northern New Mexico, which he wanted to sell to the U.S. government. Prior to 1848, when the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War ended, Mexican law allowed women to inherit and purchase land and livestock, to share ownership with their husbands, to establish their own businesses, and to begin divorce proceedings. After 1848, the new United States laws deprived women of these rights. Doyle Settlement Schoolhouse at Doyle Settlement, southeast of Pueblo on Doyle Road, listed on the National Register of Historic Places In 1853,Lecompte (1980), pp. 233-234. or after Barclay's death in 1855, Sandoval lived in a one-room house on the ranch of her daughter, Maria De La Cruz \\"Cruzita\\" Suaso Doyle (b. 1831), and son-in-law, Joseph Doyle. Doyle established a 1,200-acre ranch and settlement, called Doyle Settlement, along two miles of the Huerfano River in what is now Pueblo County. The land was from the Vigil and St. Vrain Land Grant. Doyle died unexpectedly in 1864 and left the ranch to his wife. Sandoval managed the ranch from 1864 to the 1890s. Doyle Settlement remained in the family for decades.

Taxonomy English zoologist Hampton Wildman Parker described the speckled brown snake as Demansia guttata in 1926 from a specimen collected in Winton, Queensland. The brown snakes were moved to Pseudonaja by Australian naturalist Eric Worrell in the early 1960s on the basis of skull morphology, and reinforced by American herpetologist Samuel Booker McDowell in 1967 on the basis of the muscles of the venom glands. This classification has been followed by subsequent authors. A 2005 analysis using mitochondrial DNA found that the speckled brown snake was an early offshoot of the genus, with the taipans as more distantly related. A 2016 genetic analysis showed that the speckled brown snake was an early offshoot of a lineage giving rise to the taipans, rather than the other brown snakes. Description The speckled brown snake grows to long. It has a small head, straw-yellow to orange upper parts, white throat and lips, and cream, yellow, or white under parts blotched with orange. Its scales have black edges that become visible when the snake bends or moves. Some snakes have wide, darker bands. It has 19‚Äì21 rows of dorsal scales at midbody, 190 to 220 ventral scales, 44 to 70 divided subcaudal scales (occasionally some of the anterior ones are undivided), and a divided anal scale. It is found in the eastern Northern Territory, western Queensland, and far northern South Australia. It lays a clutch of six eggs on average. Distribution The speckled brown snake occurs in the Channel Country, Mitchell Grass Downs, and Mount Isa Inlier in Northern Territory, Queensland, and South Australia. Trophic relations Frogs and lizards make up a large proportion of its diet, though it also eats small birds and mammals. Its venom is 1.6 times as toxic as that of the Indian cobra (Naja naja).

Only one was built. Design and development The Albert A-20 had a cantilever, one-piece, thick section, high wing with a convex leading edge and a straight, unswept trailing edge, similar to the wings of the Albert TE.1 and Albert A-10. Narrow-chord ailerons occupied all the trailing edge. The wing structure included multiple spruce and plywood box-spars and variable thickness ply skin. It was powered by two wing-mounted Walter NZ 60 five- cylinder radial engines with their mountings enclosed in streamlined aluminium fairings. Fuel tanks were in the wings. The A-20's fuselage was flat-sided, with a rectangular section throughout, though in plan the extreme nose was rounded as its section decreased. It was wooden, with four longerons and plywood skin. The cockpit was under the wing with a windscreen at the leading edge providing good views ahead and below. There were two side-by-side seats with opening side-windows, the pilot on the left and navigator on the right. A windowed starboard-side door gave access both to the cockpit and to an under- wing cabin behind the crew which could accommodate two passengers or of mail. It was lit by a large window opposite the door. Like the wing, the empennage was wood framed and ply covered. In plan the horizontal tail was roughly elliptical, with an in-flight adjustable tailplane and single-piece elevator.

The species is native to South Australia, New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria. P. aspidorhyncha is part of a species complex that also includes P. mengdeni and P. nuchalis; all were formerly included in the latter species. Taxonomy Frederick McCoy described the species in 1879 as the shield-fronted brown snake, distinguishing it from the eastern brown snake (P. textilis) by its narrow head, truncated snout and large rostral plate over the back of its head, He noted its similarity to the western brown snake (P. nuchalis). Heber Longman described Diemenia carinata in 1915 from a specimen from Cane Grass Station near Charleville in southwestern Queensland. it was known locally as \\"tiger snake\\". Francis J. Mitchell of the South Australian Museum described Demansia acutirostris from an island in Lake Eyre, noting its depressed snout distinguishing it from other brown snakes. Australian herpetologist Richard W. Wells divided P. nuchalis into eight species, recognising P. aspidorhyncha, P. carinata and P acutirostris as distinct. These additional species have not been recognized by other authors, and Wells has been strongly criticized for lack of rigour in his research. For many years, the taxon was regarded as a southern population of a broadly defined P. nuchalis despite the diverse nature of populations included within. The scientific name was resurrected in 2009 as genetic and morphological data confirmed it as a distinct lineage, and it was the oldest binomial name that had been applied to the taxon - hence it had priority. Description Generally up to 1.5 metres long, the strap- snouted brown snake is a long thin snake, with no demarcation between its head and neck. The snout has a distinctive chisel shape. It has light- to medium brown upperparts. Scalation The number and arrangement of scales on a snake's body are a key element of identification to species level. The eastern brown snake has 17 rows of dorsal scales at midbody, 207 to 226 ventral scales, 47 to 63 divided subcaudal scales, and a divided anal scale. Its mouth is lined with six (rarely five) supralabial scales above and seven (rarely eight) sublabial scales below. Its nasal scale is undivided. Its eyes have two postocular scales.

He attained the rank of brigadier general by brevet as a member of the Union Army during the American Civil War. Born in Kingston, New York and the son of Congressman and Judge John Van Buren, Daniel Van Buren was educated in Kingston, and graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1847. He served in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, and remained on duty until resigning after his father's death in 1855. Returning to Kingston to administer his father's estate, Van Buren studied law, attained admission to the bar, and practiced. In addition, he worked as an engineer and surveyor, and served as an engineer officer in the state militia. Van Buren returned to the Army for the American Civil War, serving primarily as chief of staff to John Adams Dix as Dix carried out a series of senior commands; Van Buren advanced through the ranks to colonel, and received a brevet promotion to brigadier general in recognition of his superior service during the war. After the war, Van Buren worked as an engineer and surveyor, first in Kingston, and later in Plainfield, New Jersey. He died in Plainfield, and was buried at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn. Early life Daniel T. Van Buren was born in Kingston, New York on January 15, 1826; his mother was Laura Hardy Van Buren (1800-1874), and his father was John Van Buren (1799-1855), a Kingston attorney and judge who served terms in the New York State Assembly and United States House of Representatives. Van Buren was educated in Kingston and graduated from Kingston Academy. In 1843 he began attendance at the United States Military Academy; he graduated in 1847 ranked 6th of 38 in his class, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the artillery corps. Start of career After receiving his commission, Van Buren was appointed to the 2nd Artillery Regiment. He took part in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, including the Battle for Mexico City and the occupation of the city after the war. Van Buren was promoted to first lieutenant in 1849. Following his service in Mexico, Van Buren was appointed to the West Point faculty as an assistant professor of natural philosophy and experimental philosophy. He remained at West Point until being reassigned in 1852. Van Buren's next posting was with the Office of Coast Survey, where he took part in topographical surveys and map making duties at several U.S. ports. In 1855, John Van Buren died; Daniel Van Buren left the Army in order to return to Kingston and administer his father's estate. While in Kingston, he studied law, attained admission to the bar, and began to practice. He also carried out an appointment as Ulster County's civil engineer and surveyor. In 1858, he was commissioned as a colonel in the New York Militia, and appointed as engineer officer of the militia's 3rd Division. American Civil War After the American Civil War started in early 1861, the New York Militia's 20th Infantry Regiment was among the units mobilized for three months' service; Van Buren joined as regimental engineer officer with the rank of captain, and served in and around Annapolis Maryland until the regiment's demobilization that Summer. Van Buren remained on active duty after the 20th Regiment completed its initial period of service, and in August 1861 he joined the staff of John Adams Dix, then a major general, who commanded the Departments of Maryland and Pennsylvania. Initially assigned as Dix's adjutant and chief of staff with the rank of major, Van Buren was promoted to lieutenant colonel later that month; in June 1862, he was promoted to colonel an assigned as Dix's aide-de-camp. Van Buren remained with Dix as Dix successively commanded a division of the Army of the Potomac, the Middle District (headquartered in Baltimore), the VII Army Corps, and the Department of the East. He later served as assistant adjutant of the Department of the East under Joseph Hooker, and in March 1865 he was promoted to brigadier general by brevet in recognition of his superior service during the war. After the war, Van Buren was active in the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. Later career Following his Civil War service, Van Buren worked as a surveyor and civil engineer, first in Kingston, and later in Plainfield, New Jersey. He was also active in several business ventures, including a bluestone quarry near Kingston, which he leased to various operators, and which was the source for many of the paving stones used in New York City in the mid to late 1800s. Death and burial Van Buren died in Plainfield on July 16, 1890. He was buried in Brooklyn's Green-Wood Cemetery, Section 175, Lot 26671.

Early life Virginia Evelyn Conlee Ross was born in Galena, Illinois, on February 1, 1857. She was the youngest of twelve children of John H. Conlee and Marie Crowder. She came of a hardy pioneer class of genuine Americans. She moved with her parents to Charles City, Iowa, in 1864, but the restless spirit of the pioneer settler carried them to Johnson County, Nebraska, in 1869, where Ross passed the greater part of her early life. Career She received only the rudiments of a text-book education, but her talent sprang into activity, like the crystal flow from a mountain spring. Not being possessed of a strong physical body, she taxed herself severely. Her series of articles entitled \\"To Brides, Past, Present and Future,\\" and \\"Hints to Husbands,\\" were extensively copied. Her literary work was confined to newspapers and magazines, and her publishers kept their demand for material far ahead of her ability to produce. Her numerous poems showed a high order of talent. Personal life Virginia Evelyn Ross became the wife of Alderman Thomas J. Ross, in 1879 and had two children, Mrs. A. W. Hickman and Harry W. Ross, managing editor of the Wisconsin State Journal. She was a model housekeeper, wife and mother, and found time, with all her home and society duties, to execute some beautiful paintings. She lived in Omaha, Nebraska. In 1896 they moved to 190 W. Gilman St., Madison, Wisconsin. She died on June 10, 1923, in Madison, Wisconsin, and is buried at Forest Hill Cemetery (Madison, Wisconsin).

It followed up with American animated television series Ozzy & Drix which originally aired on Kids' WB from 2002 to 2004, shows a white blood cell police officer team up with a cold pill to defeat many germs and viruses. The series had twenty-six episodes in two seasons. Main characters Osmosis \\"Ozzy\\" Jones Voiced By Chris Rock (film), Phil LaMarr (series) Osmosis Jones is a white blood cell cop who wants to track down germs and viruses. Drixenol \\"Drix\\" Koldreliff Voiced By David Hyde Pierce (film), Jeff Bennett (series) Drix is a cold pill and Ozzy's best friend that is designed to soothe irritation within the cities of Frank and Hector. Allies Leah Estrogen Voiced By Brandy Norwood Leah Estrogen is the secretary of the mayor of Frank. She was also a romantic partner to Osmosis Jones. Maria Amino Voiced by Tasia Valenza Maria Amino is a female Hispanic white blood cell cop who is highly skilled at fighting and the replacement for Leah. Despite showing her midriff, she‚Äôs not drawn with a bellybutton. Tom Colonic Voiced By Ron Howard Tom Colonic was the political opponent of Charles Phlegmming who wanted to be the next mayor of Frank so that the city will be healthy from a better diet. After Ozzy and Drix defeated Thrax and prevented his plan to kill Frank, resulting in Phlegmming's impeachment, he eventually won the bid for the mayor of Frank in a landslide. However, it is implied that he got impeached thanks to Frank's relapse to his unhealthy diet. Mayor Paul Spryman Voiced By Alanna Ubach Mayor Paul Spryman is the immature mayor of the City of Hector. Ellen Patella Voiced by Vivica A. Fox Ellen Patella is the attorney-at-law and helps cells find homes in the City of Hector. Cilia Tyson Voiced by Dawnn Lewis Cilia Tyson is a cop in Christine who helped Ozzy stop the Pneumoniac and prove that Maximus is a traitor to the city.

She even said that everyone in Christine are fans of Hector. Drixeen Voiced by Miriam Flynn Drixeen is a friend to Cilia and she used to a cold pill. She looks a bit like Drix except she's green, has hair, and a right hand and left cannon, while Drix is red, has no hair, and his arm positions are the other way. Dander Vocal Effects By Frank Welker Dander is a dog germ formed from the saliva of Hector's dog Uno and Drix's pet. Police chiefs Chief Voiced by Joel Silver (uncredited) The Chief is Ozzy's boss in the City of Frank. Chief Gluteus Voiced by Jim Cummings Chief Gluteus is a gruff old muscle cell and the police chief of the City of Hector. Rogues Thrax Voiced By Laurence Fishburne The main antagonist of Osmosis Jones. Thrax is a vile and sadistic virus determined to kill Frank DeTorre within 48 hours, so that he can set a record for the virus to kill a man the fastest and be written about in medical books, annoyed that his previous killings had gone uncredited; among them being a young girl who refused to regularly wash her hands. Thrax kills his victims by stealing their hypothalamus, which he stores inside a chain. He has the ability to cause cells, germs, and objects to catch fire with his claw. After arriving via Frank eating a hard boiled egg contaminated by chimpanzee saliva, Thrax murders the two workers that found him and sets their boat ablaze. Thrax then confronts local crime boss Scabies, and murders him and takes control of his gang after being mocked. After causing a runny nose by breaking the dam, Thrax attempts to expand his mob at a meeting at the Zit. Osmosis and Drix blow up the Zit and Thrax is presumed dead, but actually manages to escape. Despite being fired from the force by Mayor Phlegmming in spite of their warnings, Ozzy and Drix defy his orders to stop Thrax. Thrax murders his remaining gang and steals Frank‚Äôs hypothalamus and escapes Frank‚Äôs body, with his daughter, Shane, being his next hopeful target. However, Osmosis followed him and the two battle on Shane‚Äôs fake eyelash. Osmosis steals the chain and traps Thrax on the fake eyelash, which falls into a beaker of rubbing alcohol, incinerating Thrax. Ozzy later returns the DNA bead to its rightful place and Frank recovers from his fever, resulting in him getting his job back and making Drix his new partner. Charles Phlegmming Voiced By William Shatner The former mayor of the City of Frank and the secondary antagonist of Osmosis Jones. Responsible for Frank's unhealthy eating habits, he wanted to be reelected for his own selfish benefits, but in the end, he lost to his political opponent, Tom Colonic. Whenever reporters enter his office, he would always deny all the various problems in Frank's body, trying to assure them that his body is in perfect shape. After Frank ingested the tainted hard-boiled egg that caused him to contract Thrax, Phlegmming went out of his way to ignore and downplay the issue as nothing more but a cold, but Ozzy tried to warn him it was a lot serious than that, let alone deadly, with Phlegmming threatening to put him in the next nosebleed if he ever spoke of it. He would also illegally control Frank's thoughts on a few occasions and made him take a cold pill against the wishes of his secretary, Leah, which is how Ozzy met, and joined forces with, Drix to stop Thrax's plan. After Ozzy and Drix uncovered Thrax's scheme after destroying a nightclub inside a zit on Frank's forehead, Phlegmming continued to ignore the warnings and fired Jones from the police force and ordered Drix to leave Frank's body by being peed out. Ozzy and Drix later reconciled and defied Phlegmming's orders to stop Thrax. After Leah tells him off for not caring about Frank's health and only caring about himself and his own selfish interests, including the election, Thrax infiltrates Frank's brain and steals a DNA chromosome from his hypothalamus gland, causing his body temperature to reach to a hazardous 108 degrees and sending him into a deadly coma. A trip to a chicken wing festival in Buffalo, New York, was Phlegmming's only shot of being reelected, but due to Thrax destroying the city and causing Frank's coma, it was quickly shot down when Frank was rushed to the hospital and all he could do was look on as the city burned to the ground. Ozzy later chases Thrax onto Frank's daughter, Shane's fake eyelash, where he recovers the DNA bead and traps Thrax on the eyelash, which falls into a vial of rubbing alcohol, dissolving Thrax to death, at which point he returns the stolen bead to its rightful place and Frank recovers from his fever, resulting in him getting his job back and making Drix his new partner. As for Phlegmming, Thrax's rampage resulted in a massive scandal that led up to his impeachment and removal from office, with Colonic winning the election in a landslide. Following his impeachment, Phlegmming was reduced to working as a custodian in Frank's bowels and while doing so, he accidentally presses a button that ejects himself from Frank's body via flatulence, causing his own implied demise. Scarlet Fever Voiced By Tim Curry Scarlet Fever is a dangerous bacterium who has been pursued for years by Ozzy throughout the City of Frank. With new germs moving in as a result of Frank‚Äôs bad habits, Scarlet Fever intends to leave and find new territory. During a confrontation with Ozzy and Drix, the three are sucked up by a mosquito and placed in Hector when the mosquito drinks his blood. Realizing Hector‚Äôs youth will rejuvenate him, Scarlet Fever consumes a water-like substance that transforms him into a more powerful form. He begins attacking the city, planning to kill Hector. Although he manages to fend off the local white blood cells, Ozzy and Drix fend him off and Scarlet Fever hijacks an attack helicopter, intending to go to the heart. Osmosis takes control of the helicopter and redirects it to the spleen. Scarlet Fever takes back control of the helicopter and forces Ozzy out, but he is unable to escape the spleen and torn apart. He is partially based on Thrax, with his abilities being very common. Nick O'Teen Voiced By Tim Curry Nick O'Teen serves as the main antagonist of the season one episode \\"Where There's Smoke\\". He is the nicotine of the cigarette that Hector smoked. He is accompanied by his allies Tar (Voiced by Frank Welker), Butane (Voiced by Jeff Bennett) and Carbon Monoxide (Voiced by Tara Strong).

Due to the loss of the Prussian Army Archives in World War Two, it has become the main source for the biographies of Prussian generals. History Johann Friedrich Seyfart had made the first attempt at a systematic catalogue of Prussian generals - as part of the research for his 1767 series of Prussian regimental histories he collected biographies of all these regiments' officers. Priesdorff was a lieutenant and battalion-adjutant in the Grenadier-Regiment ‚ÄûK√∂nig Friedrich Wilhelm IV.‚Äú (1. Pommersches) Nr. 2, whose commander oberst Georg Bock von W√ºlfingen commissioned him to create a master-list of the commissioned officers in the history of the regiment. He completed it in 1906 and his research gave Priesdorff access to the personnel records in the archives of the Geheime Kriegskanzlei (Secret War Chancellery), the Prussian Ministry of War and the Gro√üen Generalstabes. After leaving the Prussian military and civil service, from 1922 Priesdorff was the first (and as it turned out last) military historian to systematically use those archives to research biographies of Prussian generals. From 1937 to 1942 only ten of Priesdorff's planned fifteen volumes were published by the Hanseatische Verlagsanstalt, based in Hamburg. The manuscripts for volumes 11 and 12 had been sent from Hamburg to Leipzig for printing, but these were destroyed by an air-raid on Leipzig, though some pages Priesdorff had held onto survived, as did the manuscripts for volumes 13, 14 and 15. All the manuscripts for the work were moved to the Geheime Staatsarchiv in Berlin-Dahlem soon after the Second World War. The Bundesarchiv-Milit√§rarchiv wished to publish them, containing as they did around 1300 biographies of Prussian generals between 1908 and 1918. They contacted a publisher and found a new editor in the form of the military writer Hanns M√∂ller-Witten, author of the 1935 Geschichte der Ritter des Ordens pour le m√©rite and several short biographies. This sequel was to be known as the Neuen Reihe Soldatisches F√ºhrertum, but this came to nothing after M√∂ller-Witten's death in 1966. The personnel records of the Geheime Kriegskanzlei were then in the Prussian Privy State Archives in Berlin-Dahlem, but under the Nazi regime they were moved to the Heeresarchiv Potsdam (Potsdam Military Archive) in 1936 by Friedrich von Rabenau. They were destroyed there in an air raid in April 1945, leaving Priesdorff's work as the most important source on the topic. Information on Clio-online about the history of the records. The publisher also issued a 231-page index to volumes 1 to 8, including a short index of all generals and an index of the names of all other figures. In 1980 the Milit√§rgeschichtliches Institut of the DDR in Potsdam issued another register of the names in Priestdorff's volumes.

In 2004, a dilapidated area located at 14 Kazinczy Street that used to be homes and a stove factory was set to be demolished. The four owners of the Szimpla Kert decided to save the area from demolition and move the pub to this location. The group of owners made this decision because the structure provided more space and the environment they were looking for. The new location opened as Szimpla Kertmozi (kertmozi translating to open-air cinema in Hungarian) because of the large courtyard on the premises that was used to watch underground and indie films.

She was a founding member of the British Women's Temperance Association (BWTA) in 1876, and served as its first president. Born in England, Parker resided in Scotland. She was a delegate to the 1876 International Organisation of Good Templars (IOGT) meeting which led to the formation of the BWTA. She was also instrumental in founding the World Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WWCTU). In 1881, she founded another type of women's association, one which focused on horticulture and supply, but it did not flourish. Parker described her travels in the Eastern United States in Six Happy Months amongst the Americans (1874). Early years Parker was born in England, of an old Tory or Conservative line. Career Her beneficent activities began in that department of church work where women have always been allowed an \\"equal right\\" with men, viz.: that of paying off church debts and raising funds for \\"church extension.\\" Nothing succeeds like success, and Parker was never associated with a losing enterprise. \\"An orthodox of the orthodox,\\" she worked for woman suffrage side by side with the party of John Stuart Mill. A wife, mother, and housekeeper of the New England school, she addressed the British Social Science Congress on the question of capital and labor. A modest, soft-voiced woman, she marshaled \\" the bonnets of bonny Dundee,\\" leading a procession of 60 of her townswomen to the headquarters of the magistrate, where they presented a no-license petition with 9,000 names of women ‚Äî all this in the days of the Women's Christian Temperance Union \\"Crusade,\\" and under its inspiration. Parker was a great admirer of the U.S. She and her husband were converted by John B. Gough after one of his lectures in Dundee, becoming total abstainers. In their zeal, they banished not only wine bottles, decanters, and glasses from their sideboard, but, forgetting that they should continue to drink \\"Adam's ale,\\" sent away their tumblers also. Concerning her appreciation of \\"Yankee Notions,\\" Parker once wrote: \\"I have an American cook stove in my kitchen, an American sewing-machine in my sitting-room, and all the American books I can get in my library, and now I must have your wide-awake American paper, the Boston Woman's Journal.\\" Active as she had always been in reforms, the Crusade movement stirred Parker as nothing else had ever done. The presentation of her temperance petition to the authorities of Dundee struck the key-note for the United Kingdom, aroused Christian women to a sense of their responsibility, and led to the organization of temperance unions in Dundee and many other towns. The press having brought to her the name of Mother Stewart of Ohio, as prominently connected with the Crusade, Parker invited her to Scotland, and arranged a temperance trip for her which greatly enlisted the public interest, and from which resulted a meeting in April 1876, at Newcastle-on-Tyne. Delegates from all parts of the UK were present. Women who had never spoken on a platform before spoke with fluency and convincing earnestness, and proceeded, with all due observance of parliamentary forms, to organize the \\"British Women's Christian Temperance Union.\\" Parker was elected president of this new society, and was sent as a delegate to the Woman's International Temperance Convention which met in the Academy of Music, Philadelphia, in June 1876. There, Parker was unanimously elected President of the Woman's International Christian Temperance Union, the avowed object of which was \\"to spread a temperance Gospel to the ends of the earth.\\" Twice after the Crusade, Parker visited the U.S. to study the spirit and methods of the WCTU work. A book, entitled Six Happy Weeks among the Americans, recorded her impression of the land she had so long desired to see. A reception was given her by Sorosis, and she was elected a member of that society and of the World's Congress of Representative Women. Parker was not an orator, but her refined manners and gentle presence, combined with her strong sense and ready wit, made her one of the favorite speakers at the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893, called by the National Temperance Society, of which John Newton Stearns was Secretary. Nowhere was her influence so great as in her own city. Twice she was offered a place on the School Board of Dundee, which she declined only that she might give her time to the work of the local Woman's Temperance Union, of which she was President since its organization, and to the duties of her more distinguished but hardly more onerous office as President of the international temperance union. Personal life She married Edward Parker, proprietor of an extensive manufactory in Dundee. He was a member of a prominent Wesleyan Methodist manufacturing family of that city. They had six children ‚Äî five sons, one daughter. Their residence, The Cliff, \\"looked off upon the German Ocean and old St. Andrew's of classic memory.\\" It was a model Scotch home. After Margaret Bright Lucas succeeded her as president of the BWTA, Parker and her family lived in England, working side by side with her successor. Like Lucas, Parker was a Quaker. She died in Dundee in November 1896.

In Edmonton, almost every residential community has a corresponding community league (for a total of 157 community leagues as of 2017). The federation's intentions are to support these community organizations though funding assistance, running seminars/workshops, sport/activity organization, running events/contests, providing a common code of ethics, advocating to the municipal government on behalf of all community leagues, and providing a unified structure for the sales of Edmonton community league memberships, among other things. The community league code of ethics is composed of moral obligations with the purpose of upholding the integrity of all community leagues in Edmonton, defining community league obligations and assisting the operating efficiency of all leagues. The EFCL board of directors is composed of community league representatives from eight districts within the city.  Community leagues in Edmonton  While supported by the Edmonton Federation of Community Leagues, each community league in Edmonton is an independent nonprofit volunteer organization of its own with its own governing bylaws, policies, and procedures of which the EFCL has no control over. Like the community leagues present in some other jurisdictions, the community leagues in Edmonton are composed of residents in their communities voted into positions on the organization's board. They advocate for change to the municipal government on behalf of the citizens of their community and often provide a community newsletter to residents. In addition to this, however, community leagues in Edmonton are often known in their communities for providing additional amenities and services, including community halls, sports facilities (commonly spray parks, outdoor ice rinks and tennis courts, among others) and community gardens. Community leagues in Edmonton are funded through EFCL and government grants, casino volunteer fundraisers, income from community hall (or other amenity) rentals, individual donations, and sales from EFCL memberships. EFCL's standardized memberships are sold by the majority of community leagues as a way to obtain funds. The community league representing the area in which the buyer lives gets 100% of the profits from the membership; however, the EFCL adds an administration fee if one purchases the membership through their website and not through your community league itself. Every community league sells EFCL memberships for different prices, and the community league that received the funds from the membership sale appears on the membership card. What the community resident gets in return for buying a community membership varies based on the community in which they live. While all Edmonton community league memberships offer discounts at City of Edmonton recreation centres and free or reduced skating at community league rinks, every individual community league is free to create programs, amenities, or events restricted to EFCL membership holders of their specific community league. Many community leagues pay for or negotiate free skate or swim times solely for members of their community league or a combination of nearby leagues.  History  The first community league in Edmonton (the Crestwood community league, formerly the 142nd Street District) was formed in 1917 to attempt give citizens a greater voice in the decisions made by the municipal government given the increasing political pressures of businesses and developers. The Edmonton Federation of Community Leagues was formed a few years later in 1921, when nine different community leagues operated in the city, as a mechanism for the organizations to work together on common issues affecting all of their communities. During the near century that the federation has been active it has formed several committees that eventually became fully independent and self-sufficient, including the Edmonton Minor Hockey Association, the Edmonton Minor Soccer Association, the Edmonton Federation Skating Club, the Edmonton Youth Basketball Association, the Edmonton Youth Softball Association, the Edmonton Baseball Association and the Edmonton Neighborhood Watch, among others. The first woman to join the EFCL board and also the first woman to be elected an Edmonton community league president was Dorothy Adair, president of the Garneau community league which was founded in 1921. She was honored by the city for her community support in 2002. The federation assisted in World War II preparations, notably in the installation of air-raid sirens in Edmonton. They also pushed for the creation of the first Edmonton kindergarten program in 1969. The federation continues to voice concerns over many issues, some of which have included: re-instating community sandboxes, protecting boulevard trees during construction, lowering community speed limits, and clearer rules regarding the amenities required to be added into new and existing neighbourhoods by developers.

(1843‚Äì1919) served four Maharanas, as Prime Minister of Mewar state in former state of Rajputana (now Rajasthan) in India. Rai Pannalal Mehta carried out the duties of Munshi (Secretary) Mahakma Khas (Executive Council) from 1869 to 1878 AD. De facto he was carrying out the duties of Pradhan (Prime Minister), as most of the time the post of Pradhan was either not filled or their powers were diluted. In 1878, he was formally appointed as Pradhan. In 1894, on the advice of Agent to the Governor General, Col GH Trevor, Pannalal proceeded on long leave and whilst on a pilgrimage, he resigned. During his tenure as Pradhan, Rai Pannalal Mehta was instrumental in conceiving and promoting various reforms and public interest projects: * The Separation of judiciary from executive and the publication of the first regular Gazette cum Journal. * Land and fiscal reforms and introduction of financial budget. * In 1885, Lord Dufferin, then Viceroy of India, laid foundation for New Walter Zanana Hospital (now Ayurvedic Hospital at Moti Chohatta, Udaipur) * In 1889, Prince Albert Victor, inaugurated the marble statue of his grandmother Empress Victoria in Gulab Bagh. * In 1889, Lord Lansdowne, then Viceroy of India, inaugurated public library (now Sarasvati Sarvajanik Pustakalya) in Gulab Bagh, Udaipur. * In 1889, Duke and Duchess of Connaught, laid foundation of Connaught Dam (now called Fateh Sagar Paal). * In 1889, Marwar-Mewar railway line project (1885‚Äì89) completed. * In 1889, amicably resolved century-old border dispute between Marwar and Mewar at Pagliya-ki-Naal (Desuri), directly with Maharaja Jaswant Singh of Jodhpur, Marwar. * In 1891, proposed construction of railways line to connect Udaipur with Chittor, but it was stalled by vested interests.  Upbringing  Rai Pannalal Mehta was born in 1843 AD (Vikram Samvat 1900, Bhadava sud 2; Indian Lunar calendar) at Udaipur to Murlidhar Mehta, a trusted emissary of Maharana Swarup Singh. Rai Pannalal Mehta (1843‚Äì1919) writes in his autobiography, ‚ÄòSwa-jeevni‚Äô, This impressed Maharana Swarup Singh and he started keeping watch on Pannalal. During 1857 revolution English ladies were put up in Jag Mandir, an island garden palace in Lake Pichola at Udaipur for safety. The young Pannalal was sent there to take care of hospitality, as he knew English fluently. Later in 1857, Pannalal was married at the age of 14 years to the daughter of Chaganlal Kothari, younger brother of Kesri Singh Kothari, who also held post of Pradhan for short duration and interim periods.  Administrative career  Maharana Fateh Singh with Pradhan Pannalal Mehta on his right, and Fatehlal Mehta (son of Pannalal) behind the bolster on right in Durbar at Mor Chowk (1884) - Courtesy Museum Archives of the Maharanas of Mewar Young Pannalal started his administrative career in 1860 at Nimbahera, at Rupees 25/- per month. He assisted his uncle and former Pradhan (1827‚Äì29, 1831‚Äì39 and 1844‚Äì56) of Mewar and then Hakim (Administrator) at Nimbahera, Sher Singh Mehta. During a short apprenticeship at Nimbahera, his administrative acumen and negotiation skills were noticed by Maharana Swarup Singh. He was asked to report to political officer's office at Choti Sadri and then to Udaipur in 'Dewani Office' (office of Pradhan). On 23 December 1869, the Maharana announced establishment of a new executive council called ‚ÄòMahakma Khas‚Äô (Executive Council; ‡§Æ‡§π‡§ï‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§ñ‡§æ‡§∏) and appointed Pannalal Mehta as its Munshi (Secretary; ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§Ç‡§∂‡•Ä). Subsequently, various important administrative reforms in the Mewar State, such as land reforms, revenue settlement, sati- pratha, salt trade agreement, reconstitution of state council, etc., were carried out under the guidance and leadership of Pannalal, who was de facto Pradhan of the state.

Rawat Publications  Golden period of Mewar history: reforms and projects  The Separation of judiciary from executive and publication of the first regular Gazette cum Journal are two illustrations of the pioneering efforts of Rai Pannalal Mehta. As a principal advisor to Maharanas, Shambhu Singh and Sajjan Singh, he could achieve all this by the tactful way in which he handled his triangular duties ‚Äì loyalty to the Maharanas, coordination with the British political department and bringing about the good of the people of the state which was dearest to his heart. Maharana Shambhu Singh (1874‚Äì84), on advice of Rai Pannalal Mehta, decided to take measures to make regular settlement of the land revenue in the Khalsa (state owned land; ‡§ñ‡§æ‡§≤‡•ç‡§∏‡§æ). Maharana was embroiled not only in administrative problems, but also disputes and insubordination from his close relatives and nobles. Therefore, Pannalal concentrated on reorganisation and fiscal reforms in the administration and to bring together all stakeholders on board for smooth running of the affairs of the state. Under able guidance of Pannalal, Maharana Sajjan Singh could win back the trust of his kin and nobles (‡§†‡§æ‡§ï‡•Å‡§∞ ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§∏‡§ø‡§∞‡§¶‡§∞) and the public at large. Among the major administrative reforms, was making financial budget for various expenditures and revenues. Pannalal took steps that introduced Mewar to modernity. He widened roads and built new ones. He ordered the reforestation of the surrounding hills, laid new water pipelines and repaired existing water tanks. Portrait of Laxmilal Mehta - Military commander and Hakim Jahajpur (1876-88). Painted in 1904 by Artist Pannalal Chatur. Pannalal modernised the police force and established settlement department, which recorded correct boundaries for agricultural fields and villages. Mewer's judicial system was also upgraded. Maharana Sajjan Singh inaugurated a separate civil court and a criminal court where a committee, like the modern jury system, made the decisions. Mahadraj Sabha, like a High Court was also established, along with new government departments. He also established an Education Committee and set up first government printing press in the state. This is also known as the 'golden period' in the history of Mewar. Mehta Pannalal writes in his book Swa-Jeewani (Autobiography), Laxmilal was the younger brother of Pannalal. During the reign of Maharana Fateh Singh, Pannalal was instrumental in conceiving and promoting various public interest projects. On the recommendations of Pannalal, it was also decided to raise the paal (dam; ‡§™‡§æ‡§≤) of Devali-ka-Talaab (‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡§æ‡§≤‡•Ä ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§§‡§æ‡§≤‡§æ‡§¨) by 20 feet. The foundation stone was laid by Duke of Connaught in 1889. The paal was christened as ‚ÄòConnaught Bandh‚Äô and lake was renamed as ‚ÄòFateh Sagar‚Äô. Later a canal connecting Swarup Sagar with Fateh Sagar, suggested by Pannalal and named Thompson canal, after Mr Thompson, the engineer behind the project was constructed. Similarly, the projects for setting up of Zanana (Women) Hospital, in 1885, at Moti Chohatta and Sarasvati Sarvajanik Pustkalay, (public library; ‡§∏‡§∞‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§§‡•Ä ‡§∏‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§ú‡§®‡§ø‡§ï ‡§™‡•Å‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡§ï‡§æ‡§≤‡§Ø) in 1889 at Gulab Bagh were completed. The project of Marwar-Mewar railway line were conceived in 1885 and completed in 1889 by Pannalal. The century-old border dispute between Marwar and Mewar about Pagaliyon-ki-Naal (valley pass at Desuri; ‡§™‡§ó‡§≤‡§ø‡§Ø‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§®‡§æ‡§≤) was tactfully resolved directly by Pradhan Rai Pannalal Mehta with Maharaja Jaswant Singh of Jodhpur in 1891. However, in 1891, proposal for construction of railway line to connect Udaipur with Chittor by Pannalal was stalled by vested interests and his detractors.  Conspiracy and displeasure  Since the welfare and well being of Mewar state was always foremost with Rai Pannalal Mehta, certain Sirdars & Umraos (the nobility) were envious of his growing popularity and began to conspire against him. He faced court displeasure, attack on his life and exile from the state. However, each time he returned more determined and powerful. Eminent historian BK Gupta writes in his book, ‚ÄòStudies in Indian History: Rajasthan Through the Ages‚Äô, BK Gupta continues, Earlier, on the suspicion of poisoning Maharana Shambhu Singh, Pannalal was dismissed as Secretary. He was at once arrested and imprisoned on 9 September 1874 and kept in Karan Vilas Palace (popularly known as kitchen; ‡§∞‡§∏‡•ã‡§°‡§º‡§æ). The security guards were also placed at his residence and those of his brother Takhat Singh Mehta and few others. A few days before his arrest, Gopal Singh (Kataria) Mehta (his brother-in-law) had sent a message to Pannalal that he is likely to be arrested soon and he should escape incognito. But Mehta Pannalal replied, His detractors continued to invent other charges, such as corruption but failed. However, Pannalal continued to remain in custody. Lt Col Wright, the Political Agent at Udaipur counseled the Maharana not to punish Pannalal and others until an open and fair trial had been held.  Attempt on life and exile  Maharana Shambhu Singh could not recover from his illness and breathed his last on 7 October 1874. Maharana was only 27 years old when he died. Rai Pannalal Mehta, who was under close custody, requested permission to accompany the funeral procession of late Maharana Shambhu Singh. His request was granted with two security guards attending on him. At Mahasatyaji (royal cremation ground at Aayad in Udaipur), he sat under a tree to take some rest. He was brutally attacked thrice with sword by unknown persons, believed to be at the instigation of his detractors. He received two wounds on the head and one on the shoulder. Because of head-gear (pagdi; ‡§™‡§ó‡§°‡§º‡•Ä) his life was saved. Later, under Maharana Sajjan Singh, Pannalal was called by Political Agent Lt Col Wright and told, ‚ÄúThe Charges against you have been dismissed, except for corruption Charge.‚Äù Though Pannalal vehemently denied the corruption charge but Agent said that since he has large number of detractors in the state, it would be advisable for him to leave Mewar for some time. Pannalal left for Ajmer in October 1874. In view of safety, Political Agent, Lt Col Wright provided five riders from Ashind and Shahpura villages, to accompany the carriage of Pannalal to Ajmer. Shahiwal Arjun Singh, was appointed as Secretary to Mahakma Khas in place of Pannalal. He could not fit himself in the new system of work and atmosphere dominated by the Political Agent, so he resigned after a few months from Mahakma Khas in 1875. Kothari Chaganlal who was working as the head of Finance department was appointed as the Secretary in place of Sahiwal and he too could not work satisfactorily. After about eight months in 1875, new Political Agent Col Herbert wrote to Pannalal Mehta, then at Ajmer, Maharana Sajjan Singh directed that Pannalal be sent to take charge of Mahakma Khas and was re- appointed on 8 September 1875 as Munshi to Mahakma Khas. Although he was not designated as Prime Minister, but he has been referred to as Pradhan both orally and in letters. He was also restored with jagir (a feudal land grant; ‡§ú‡§æ‡§ó‡•Ä‡§∞) and other allowances.Pratibha Jain, Sangita Sarma (2004). Honour, status & polity. Rawat Publications, Jaipur.City Clock Tower - symbol of communal harmony. Constructed in 1887 by Pradhan Rai Pannalal Mehta  Appointed as Pradhan  In 1878, Rai Pannalal Mehta was formally appointed as Pradhan (Prime Minister) of Mewar upon demise of Pradhan Gokal Chand Mehta (1856‚Äì59, 1861‚Äì67, 1874‚Äì78). Although, Gokal Chand was Pradhan but de facto Pannalal was running the affairs of the state as Munshi to Mahakma Khas.  City Clock Tower ‚Äì symbol of communal harmony  In 1887, there was a street fight with bricks and batons between Mahajans (a Hindu/Jain trader sect) and Bohras (a Muslim sect), over taking a male goat through Maldas street at Udaipur for sacrifice during holy festive month. The proactive Pradhan, Rai Pannalal Mehta immediately summoned a company of military to control the people of two communities. The prompt action of Pradhan to contain the riot was well appreciated by both Maharana and the Resident. The British Resident conducted the enquiry and fined Rupees 5000 to each community. Upon which Pannalal proposed to Maharana Fateh Singh, The fine so collected was also added towards grant from Durbar. The Clock Tower was constructed under the supervision of Pradhan Rai Pannalal Mehta. It stands tall even today, with the same Kotwali in the background.

In August 1894, Agent to the Governor General (AGG) Col GH Trevor came to Udaipur from Abu. When AGG Col Trevor met Maharana, the latter expressed his desire to dismiss Pannalal from the post of Prime Minister, as in his opinion Pannalal was the evil spirit conspiring in everything against him and was corrupt to the core. The Maharana further stated that he would have dismissed Pannalal long ago, but for fear of the interference by the British Government. Trevor did not like Maharana's idea, however, he found him firm on his decision to remove Pannalal. Trevor, before leaving, called Pannalal aside and advised him to take long leave and proceed out of Udaipur. It was decided that Pradhan Rai Pannalal Mehta will be allowed to take paid leave and then resign. In September 1894, Pannalal took leave for six months and handed over the charge of Mahakma Khas to Sahiwala Arjun Singh and Kothari Balwant Singh. Pannalal submitted his resignation after a few weeks on leave. He spent the remaining years of his life in Mewar as a close observer of the affairs of the state. During the above meeting with the Maharana, Col Trevor, however, achieved an Imperial objective, while conceding to the Maharana's demand to dismiss Pannalal, he could persuade Maharana to agree to construct the long pending railway line from Chittor to Udaipur. The Maharana was then counselled by the British government to appoint someone as the Prime Minister which the former declined to do. Maharana Fateh Singh was not prepared to part with his ruling powers. Once Pradhan Rai Pannalal Mehta resigned, he never, throughout next thirty years of his reign, employed an official as the Prime Minister. Though Pannalal did not receive official acceptance of resignation but he received an appreciation letter from AGG Col GH Trevor at Abu: > Rai Pannalal Mehta, CIE, has been the Chief official of the Udaipur Durbar > for I believe about 25 years and has been highly praised for his abilities > by successive Residents. He now retires from office having been held in high > estimation by the Government and to the regret of many friends in Mewar. > My best wishes to him.

They then completed his portrait at Travancore (Trivandrum). Varma writes in his book (25 June 1901). > \\"Rai Pannalal Mehta, our friend‚Äôs father, sat to us this evening for his > portrait which we intend finishing at home, as our departure is approaching. > His features are very regular and his complexion is fair.

Rai Pannalal Mehta passed away at Udaipur in December 1919. He was cremated with full state honours at Mahasatiyaji in Oswal nobles‚Äô (Musaddi‚Äôs) cremation area. A cenotaph (Chatri) in the memory of Pradhan Rai Pannalal Mehta was constructed by his son Mehta Fatehlal in 1920. At the time of his death he was survived by his son Fatehlal, grandsons Devilal and Udailal, who all distinguished as able high-profile administrators in the state of Mewar. Pannalal‚Äôs younger brother Laxmilal predeceased him in 1906 and youngest brother Takhat Singh passed away in 1924. Pannalal was the last Pradhan of Mewar state and also from Bachhawat clan, who held this exalted position in the reign of four successive Maharanas, starting with Swarup Singh, Shambhu Singh, Sajjan Singh and ending with Fateh Singh. Pannalal maintained a diary along with important correspondence and documents in his life time but he formally commenced collating and writing his memoirs in 1916.

His paternal family, the Cuzas (Cuzeas), were landowners of uncertain origin who, by the time of Ioni»õƒÉ's birth, had been established into the boyardom, being under the patronage of Doukas and Sturdza aristocrats. Ioni»õƒÉ's mother was a direct descendant of the statesman-chronicler Miron Costin; his father, Miron Cuza, had been involved in the pro-Habsburg conspiracy headed by Fran√ßois Ernaut, while his grandfather, Dumitra»ôco Cuzea, had been hanged during the clampdown. As boyars, both the Cuzas and the Costins opposed the Phanariote regime and devised other schemes to emancipate Moldavia from the Ottoman Empire. Ioni»õƒÉ was at the forefront of this fight in 1759, when he managed to contain the actions of Prince Ioan Teodor Callimachi and his courtier Iordaki Stavraki, expelling the latter from Moldavia. He was propelled to high office, serving for years as the Moldavian Stolnic. In 1767, Cuza also had a standoff with Grigore III Ghica, who finally agreed to grant him and other native boyars access to higher offices, and thus earned Cuza's enduring political support. He was Paharnic before and during the Russo-Turkish War of 1768, returning as Spatharios, or commander of the Moldavian military forces, during Ghica's second and final reign. While conserving his standing in regional politics, Cuza built a large estate of his own, with clusters of villages in both FƒÉlciu County and Bessarabia. Cuza was finally executed, with Manolache Bogdan, after both were caught up in the intrigues against Prince Constantine Mourouzis. He was survived by five sons. Through one of them, Ioni»õƒÉ was the great- grandfather of Alexandru Ioan Cuza, Romanian nationalist campaigner and Domnitor of the United Principalities. His reign saw several rapprochements between the Cuzas and the Mourouzis, all of which created controversy and returned focus on Ioni»õƒÉ's rebellion. Another one of Ioni»õƒÉ's sons was the great-grandfather of A. C. Cuza, the antisemitic doctrinaire. Biography Origins Ioni»õƒÉ Cuza's ethnic origins and ancestry are largely uncertain, subject to several competing theories. Some early hypotheses, centered on the name's resonance, have proposed that the Cuzas were Italians or Lorrainers.Gorovei, pp. 10‚Äì11 Historian N. Stoicescu believes that they were possibly ethnic Greeks.Gorovei, p. 11; Stoicescu, p. 392 According to genealogist »òtefan S. Gorovei, Ioni»õƒÉ's ancestry is entirely local and can be traced back to January 1588, with the first mention of a \\"Cozea\\" from Ro»ôiori. This figure, identified by Gorovei as the Cuza patriarch, made lucrative land deals in other parts of Neam»õ County, leaving a fortune to his sons. One of these may be Toader Cuza, who is shown to be engaged in commercial exchanges with the boyar Toader Jora.Gorovei, p. 11 Another genealogist, Gheorghe G. Bezviconi, proposes that the Joras and the Cuzas had a common ancestor, the Vornic BƒÉisan.Bezviconi I, p. 95 & II, p. 49 The family may have branched out into Bessarabia at an early stage, with records showing them as founders and owners of the village Coze»ôti.Gorovei, p. 11 Unusually among Moldavian boyars, the Cuzas seem not to have adopted a coat of arms of their own,Sorin Iftimi, Vechile blazoane vorbesc. Obiecte armoriate din colec»õii ie»ôene, p. 169. Ia»ôi: Palatul Culturii, 2014. although a tierced per fess shield is attributed to them in Emanuel Hagi-Mosco's album.Emanuel Hagi-Mosco, Steme boere»ôti din Rom√¢nia, Bucharest: Socec, 1918 The first Cuza to reach high office may have been a Vistier Coza, serving in the 1630s. According to Stoicescu, he was father of the better-known Dumitra»ôco Cuza (or Cuzea).Stoicescu, p. 392 Contrarily, Gorovei argues that there is \\"no certain connection\\" between the Vistier and Dumitra»ôco, who was the known heir of Toader Cuza.Gorovei, pp. 10‚Äì11 It is also known that Dumitra»ôco married Safta, daughter of Toader Jora and sister-in-law of the Great Vornic Ioan Sturza (of the Greek Sturdzas).Stoicescu, p. 392. See also Bezviconi I, p. 111; Gorovei, p. 11 One period writ describes him as the son of Safta Jora.Bezviconi I, p. 111 This dynastic arrangement also made Cuza a relative of the powerful Doukas and brought him a large dowry, including 15 estates in Moldavia-proper and Bessarabia.Gorovei, p. 11 He had a steady climb at the court, being first mentioned in June 1677 as Comis for Prince Antonie Ruset, granted ownership of VlƒÉicenii village in recognition for his service.Gorovei, p. 10 He became Spatharios in 1679, under George Ducas, returning as Great Stolnic and Great Spatharios under Constantine Ducas.Stoicescu, p. 392. See also Gorovei, p. 11 Dumitra»ôco also cultivated a close relationship with the Costin boyars, and in particular with Hetman Ioni»õƒÉ Costin, orphaned son of the writer and politician Miron Costin. Cuza's own three sons, Miron, Toader and Velicico, were involved in cementing such links. Miron Cuza (fl. 1680‚Äì1742)Popa & Rotaru, p. 139 may have been named after Ioni»õƒÉ's father.Gorovei, p. 11 Holding office as Logothete, he married Ilinca, daughter of Ioni»õƒÉ Costin, granddaughter of his namesake and niece of Nicolae Costin.Stoicescu, pp. 391, 393. See also Atanasiu, p. 77; Gorovei, p. 12; Popa & Rotaru, p. 140 The Costins had been one of the most powerful players after the Moldavian Magnate Wars, keeping Princes as the \\"instruments of [their] party\\".Djuvara, p. 346 Through her mother Ileana, Ilinca also descended from Movile»ôti royalty.Bezviconi I, p. 185 In 1701‚Äì1702, Cuza Sr and the Hetman tried to mediate a conflict between Prince Ducas and his Spatharios, Mihai Racovi»õƒÉ.Atanasiu, p. 73; Gorovei, p. 11 Instead, they came to be detested by the latter. Cuza was sidelined later that year, when Racovi»õƒÉ managed to topple and replace Ducas.Gorovei, p. 11 Over the following decades, Phanariote bureaucrats acting under the supervision of the Ottoman Empire instituted a regime which cut back on the privileges of established boyar families. Racovi»õƒÉ participated in its creation, returning to rule as a Phanariote in December 1715. However, in 1716, Moldavia was dragged into the Austro‚ÄìTurkish War. Racovi»õƒÉ and his Seimeni \\"put up no resistance\\" to the Imperial Army, which then imposed terror on the city of Ia»ôi.Vogoride-Konaki, pp. 17‚Äì18 Following this regime change, Miron and Velicico involved themselves in a plot to topple Racovi»õƒÉ, alongside boyar Vasile Ceaurul and the mercenary Fran√ßois \\"Fran»õƒÉ\\" Ernaut.Gorovei, pp. 11‚Äì12. See also Vogoride-Konaki, pp. 16‚Äì20; Xenopol, pp. 37‚Äì40 In January 1717, the Seimeni defeated Ernaut, and resumed control of the country. Racovi»õƒÉ ordered Cuza Sr's hanging,Stoicescu, p. 392; Vogoride-Konaki, p. 20; Xenopol, p. 39 in what was seen by chronicler Ion Neculce as a blind retaliation for his sons' doings.Gorovei, p. 12 His body was dropped in a mass grave by the side of CetƒÉ»õuia Monastery.Xenopol, p. 39 The three younger Cuzas escaped vengeance, but were kept out of political affairs; Toader's sons declined socially, losing their boyar status.Gorovei, p. 12 Career =Rise= The son of Miron and Ilinca, Ioni»õƒÉ was born at an unknown date, referred to by historians as \\"before 1720\\"Popa & Rotaru, p. 139 or \\"around 1715\\".Gorovei, p. 12 He is known to have had a brother, Mihalache, who is recorded as deceased before 1760.Popa & Rotaru, p. 138 His grandfather Costin died late in 1729, leaving Miron an heir to much of his estate.Atanasiu, p. 77 In 1742‚Äì1748, Ioni»õƒÉ was a Postelnic, and then a Pitar to 1752,Popa & Rotaru, p. 139 being consulted by Prince Constantine Mavrocordatos during the abolition of Moldavian serfdom (April 1749). The same year, he and other boyars sent three letters of protest to Abdullah Pasha, the Ottoman Grand Vizier, demanding less taxation and fewer privileges for the foreign merchants.Gorovei, p. 12 According to Gorovei, these letters should be seen as early documents of Romanian nationalism, with Ioni»õƒÉ Cuza included on \\"something one may call the 'national party', or the homegrown party\\".Gorovei, p. 12 The Pitars anti-Phanariote sentiments were recorded under the reign of Ioan Teodor Callimachi, whose Spatharios, Iordaki Stavraki, blacklisted Cuza.Gorovei, p. 12 In 1759, the same Stavraki devised a plan to have Cuza and other 11 boyars removed, sending them on diplomatic mission to the Crimean Khanate, where they were to be kidnapped. The plan was uncovered and the boyars rebelled: as noted by Cuza himself, they had support \\"from the whole country\\", obtaining Stavraki's removal and exile; Cuza then reconciled with the Prince, taking over as Stolnic.Gorovei, pp. 12‚Äì13. See also Xenopol, pp. 105‚Äì109 He was simultaneously Stolnic and Vistier to 1763, also serving as the Ispravnic of Vaslui from 1761 to 1767.Popa & Rotaru, p. 139 As the head of his house, Ioni»õƒÉ was ktitor of the Moldavian Orthodox church in Negre»ôti. Recognized for his philanthropy, in 1762 he received from the widow Safta Racle»ô the neighboring village of B√¢rze»ôti.Popa & Rotaru, pp. 138‚Äì139 After 1770, Cuza also became implicated in more controversial credit ventures, earning the reputation of a usurer.Paul Cernovodeanu, \\"Elemente incipiente ale burgheziei √Æn societatea rom√¢neascƒÉ sub fanario»õi\\", in Revista de Istorie, Vol. 40, Issue 5, 1987, p. 484 The deeds he held in Negre»ôti and B√¢rze»ôti became the basis for a large Cuza domain, which also included ZƒÉpodeni and Rebricea; he had inherited additional land in CuzlƒÉu, as well as townhouses in Vaslui and Ia»ôi.Popa & Rotaru, p. 140 Cuza married a daughter of Pitar Toader R√¢»ôcanu, Tudosica, with whom he had five sons.Popa & Rotaru, p. 140 Of these, four are known to have survived into maturity: Nicolae (or Neculai), Arghirie, Gheorghe and Constantin.Gorovei, p. 13 All were educated at home, by tutors from Golia Monastery.Popa & Rotaru, p. 140 By 1767, Cuza was again in conflict with the Phanariote regime, which at the time was personified by prince Grigore III Ghica. He and other boyars declared themselves outraged at being sidelined from major offices, and left the country on voluntary exile. The Ottoman envoy, or Kapucu, intervened as mediator; the protesters returned after being promised reparations.Gorovei, p. 13 Thus, Cuza himself returned to prominence. From 1769 to 1773, he served as Paharnic,Popa & Rotaru, p. 139 ending his term under the early stages of a Russian occupation. The latter period saw Cuza working with other boyars to limit Phanariote abuses by resorting to Russian and Ottoman arbitration under the terms of K√º√ß√ºk Kaynarca. In August 1774, the boyars, gathered at Foc»ôani, nominated Cuza and Enachi Chirica as their envoys to Istanbul, where they were to ask for Ghica's return as Prince. Sultan Abdul Hamid I confirmed Ghica for the throne before they left, rendering their mission redundant.Gorovei, p. 13 =Rebellion and execution= The citadel of Ia»ôi, as imagined in 1686 by Gabriel Bodenehr Cuza was appointed as Ghica's Spatharios later in 1774.Popa & Rotaru, p. 139 The reign was nevertheless one of major setbacks, beginning with the forced cession of northern Moldavia, annexed by the Habsburg Monarchy and administered as an Austrian duchy. The Prince was assassinated in 1777,Gorovei, p. 13 with Constantine Mourouzis taking his throne. Cuza preserved his rank and office, but began conspiring against the new monarch. Various foreign sources indicate that the project was of a Masonic inspiration, which would push the history of Freemasonry in Romania to 1770 or even before, to 1740.Djuvara, p. 317 According to Gorovei, Cuza's scheme involved deposing Mourouzis and placing Vornic Manolache Bogdan on the throne.Gorovei, p. 13 Another historian, Nicolae Iorga, attributes the initiative to a low-ranking boyar, Iordachi DƒÉrmƒÉnescu, Cuza and other boyars being only drawn in by their \\"politicking\\".Iorga (1928), p. 301 Various other researches have also noted that DƒÉrmƒÉnescu was a key figure in the import of Enlightenment philosophy and modernizing political literature to Moldavia.Grigoru»õƒÉ, p. 39 Mourouzis was informed of the Bogdan‚ÄìCuza‚ÄìDƒÉrmƒÉnescu conspiracy, and retaliated: Bogdan and Cuza were apprehended and interrogated under torture by another Spatharios, Constantin Caragea. Exposed to a similar treatment, DƒÉrmƒÉnescu admitted to having sent a letter to the Ottoman authorities in Bender, asking for arbitration against Mourouzis. He also incriminated Cuza, who was one of the boyars to have signed that document.Grigoru»õƒÉ, p. 39 Historian A. D. Xenopol notes that Cuza was mainly targeted not for actually siding with Bogdan, but for having protested against the Ottoman army's raids in Moldavia. Prince Mourouzis had also found the Ottoman presence unpalatable, but, Xenopol writes, regarded Cuza's additional complaints as dangerously excessive.Xenopol, pp. 182‚Äì183 Cuza and Bogdan were decapitated on August 18, 1778.Gorovei, p. 13; Grigoru»õƒÉ, pp. 38‚Äì39. See also Djuvara, p. 317; Iorga (1928), p. 301; Popa & Rotaru, p. 140; Xenopol, p. 182 Contemporary records suggest that they were killed at night in Ia»ôi's princely court, \\"in the tower that's facing the Bahlui\\"; their executioner was a Captain PavƒÉl from CosƒÉu»õi, who then left the severed heads exposed for public viewing, \\"on a rug by the gate of the court\\".Grigoru»õƒÉ, p. 39 DƒÉrmƒÉnescu received more clemency from the Prince: originally sentenced to have his right arm amputated, he was eventually dispatched to a monastery in T√¢rgu Ocna.Grigoru»õƒÉ, p. 39; Iorga (1928), pp. 301‚Äì302 Released before 1783, he dedicated himself to translating Masonic literature.Iorga (1928), pp. 301‚Äì303 Other participants were also given less violent punishments, following requests from the clergy: some, such as the boyars' physician Dracache Depasta, were exiled and had their estates confiscated.Grigoru»õƒÉ, p. 39 Legacy Romanian folklore commemorated the Spatharios with a lengthy ballad, which was probably composed shortly after his execution.Gorovei, p. 13 The fatherless family, including a nine-year old youngest son Ioan,Gorovei, p. 13 was again left exposed to poverty and persecution. Gheorghe Cuza (1762‚Äì1831), who inherited B√¢rze»ôti, also held the office of Spatharios in 1813; married to Ralu Alcaz, he had a daughter, Ecaterina Cuza-V√¢rnav (died 1872).Popa & Rotaru, pp. 140, 142‚Äì143, 146‚Äì150 Gheorghe and his brothers were instrumental in the process which led to the removal of Phanariote Princes, endorsing the nationalist memorandum of Ioni»õƒÉ Sandu Sturdza, who then became Prince.Gorovei, p. 13; Popa & Rotaru, pp. 140‚Äì141 A forerunner of Romanian liberalism, Gheorghe then had a conflict with Sturdza: supporting the constitutionalist IonicƒÉ TƒÉutu, he was detained for a while at P√¢ngƒÉra»õi.Gorovei, p. 13 The Cuza properties suffered damages in 1821, when the Ottoman army followed the Sacred Band on Moldavian territory. They were later passed on to Gheorghe's son-in-law, Vornic Costachi V√¢rnav (distantly related to the politician Scarlat V√¢rnav).Popa & Rotaru, pp. 141‚Äì150 Arghirie (1758‚Äì1826) and his wife Ileana Kostaki were based in Hotin County, from 1812 annexed to Russia, alongside other parts of Moldavia, as the Bessarabia Governorate. The couple's two daughters married, respectively, into the Rosetti and Miclescu families.Bezviconi I p. 119 & II, p. 31 Constantin, who remained in Vaslui, became through his marriage the uncle of poet Vasile Alecsandri.Bezviconi I, p. 34 Gheorghe, Arghirie and Constantin's male lines were extinguished before 1850, but the one starting with Nicolae Cuza (1755‚Äì1806) survived into the 20th century. With his Greek wife Nastasia Ziloti,Bezviconi II, p. 49 Nicolae had sons Gheorghe (1780‚Äì1835) and Ioan (1785‚Äì1848); a third, Grigore (1800‚Äì1869), died childless.Gorovei, pp. 13, 14 Ioan and Grigore both held offices as Ispravnici under the Regulamentul Organic regime, but were liberals, deeply involved in the Moldavian revolution of 1848.Gorovei, pp. 13‚Äì14 The former married a Phanariote lady, Sultana Cozadini (1785‚Äì1865),Gorovei, p. 13 impoverished heiress of the Gozzadini and Scanavis families, with roots leading back into the Duchy of the Archipelago.Sturdza, pp. 15‚Äì17 Ioan and Sultana were parents to the most distinguished Cuza of the 19th century, Alexandru Ioan. A Colonel in the Moldavian military forces and participant in the 1848 revolt, he became friends and fellow inmates with Alecu Moruzi, who was a grandson of Prince Constantine.Iorga (1938), pp. 125‚Äì127 Cuza sided with the National Party in the ad-hoc Divan.Gorovei, p. 13 That assembly elected him Moldavian Prince, then Domnitor of the United Principalities (nucleus of modern Romania), in 1859. In its validation of the election, the Moldavian deputies informed Cuza that the country had a \\"debt of honor to your family\\", and that they wished to \\"compensate the blood your ancestors have shed for the noble liberties\\".Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu, \\"Cuv√Æntu √Æn contra alegeriƒ≠ »ôi a eligibilitƒÉ»õiƒ≠ D-luƒ≠ Alecsandru C. MorudÃ¶i\\", in Rom√¢nul≈≠, December 26, 1861, p. 1136 In late 1861, Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu reminded them of this pledge, as part of a speech against Alecu Moruzi, who was at the time Moldavia's Prime Minister, and who, KogƒÉlniceanu alleged, was not a Moldavian national. The allusion was picked up by Rom√¢nul≈≠ newspaper, who noted that KogƒÉlniceanu was directly referring to Ioni»õƒÉ's killing. A dispute erupted between KogƒÉlniceanu and Grigore Cuza, who defended Moruzi's nationality rights‚Äîthis paradox was also highlighted in Rom√¢nul≈≠.S***, \\"Corespondin»õƒÉ particulariƒÉ a Romanuluƒ≠. Jassƒ≠, 9 Decembre\\", in Rom√¢nul≈≠, December 20, 1861, p. 1110 According to historian Gheorghe GhibƒÉnescu, Ioni»õƒÉ and his sons were \\"planted\\" in the Moldavian soil, a \\"trunk\\" for Alexandru Ioan's growth.Popa & Rotaru, p. 139 However, shortly before the 1866 coup which toppled him, the Domnitor surrounded himself mostly with his Cozadini relatives, who became a camarilla;Sturdza, pp. 16, 18 Alecu Moruzi also remained close to this circle.Iorga (1938), pp. 367‚Äì368, 396‚Äì397 Alexandru Ioan Cuza's line existed for one more generation after his death in exile, ending in 1889, when his surviving son, the pretender Alexandru \\"Sa»ôa\\" Cuza, died in Madrid.Constantin Chiper, \\"Elena Cuza √Æn memoria rom√¢nilor (2)\\", in For»õele Terestre.

Before the French Revolution he served in the French expedition that supported the American Revolution. He continued to serve with the army after the revolution, although he arranged to be a prisoner of the enemy during the Reign of Terror. After being exchanged, he became chief commissary in the French Army of Italy led by Napoleon, who was impressed by his performance. He continued to serve as a senior commissary to Napoleon's armies until 1809, when he retired and was made a Senator and later a Count of the Empire. After the Bourbon Restoration of 1814 he was made a Peer of France. Ancien R√©gime (1751‚Äì89) The Orillard family originated in the Amboise region. Thimoth√©e Orillard bought the fief of Villemanzy, a hamlet east of the city of Blois, on 20 October 1728. A few years later his son, Pierre, took the name \\"Orillard de Villemanzy\\". Pierre Orillard de Villemanzy was lieutenant-general of the bailliage of Amboise. Jacques-Pierre Orillard de Villemanzy was born on 5 January 1751 in Amboise, son of Pierre Orillard de Villemanzy. He began his military career at the age of 16 in 1768. He spent a 9-year internship as a student commissary from September 1768 to 5 September 1777, where he was taught the practice and problems of military administration. He was an able student and attracted the attention of the head of service. On graduating he was named Quartermaster - Chief Inspector (Commissaire Inspecteur en chef) to the Army of the Coast. He was posted at the Camp of Vassieux in 1778 and the Camp of Saint-Omer in 1779. During the American Revolution Villemanzy served with the Exp√©dition Particuli√®re commanded by the Count of Rochambeau in America between 1780 and 1783. The French troops reached Pompton Township, New Jersey on 26 August 1781. Villemanzy was ordered to set up baker's ovens and obtain supplies for the ovens. Villemanzy was told that the bread would feed the army in its march to Philadelphia, but the enemy should be deceived into thinking the plan was to attack Staten Island. He succeeded: when he tried to collect bricks from the mouth of the Raritan he was fired upon by English guns on Staten Island. After returning to France he was stationed at the camps of Saint-Omer and Cherbourg in 1788. Revolution and Empire (1789‚Äì1814) After being posted to Metz and Lun√©ville Villemanzy was sent to Paris to assist the War Committee of the Constituent Assembly until 1 October 1791. He was transferred to the Inspectorate General of Accounting, then made Ordonnateur and Grand Military Judge in Strasbourg where he sat through 1792. Villemanzy was then appointed commissaire, or quartermaster general, to the Army of the Rhine. At the Battle of Metz (1793) the army surgeon Dominique Jean Larrey successfully demonstrated the value of field ambulances. Villemanzy ordered prototypes to be built, after which ambulances would be supplied to all the Republic's armies. The politicians heard of this, and ordered a national contest to find the best design, thus delaying their delivery by over two years. At the end of 1793 Villemanzy was increasingly worried about the radical direction being taken by the French Revolution, and let the enemy take him prisoner. He thus avoided the chaos of the Reign of Terror and the Thermidorian Reaction. Villemanzy was exchanged on 2 April 1796 and appointed Commissaire Ordonnateur en chef to the Army of Italy, where he served until September 1798. In this role he helped ensure supplies and pay for the troops of the young General Napoleon. He was then posted to the Committee of General Officers in Paris until 28 August 1799, when he was transferred to the Army of the Alps. After the coup of 18 Brumaire (9 November 1799) in which Napoleon seized power, Villemanzy was made Chief of the Accounting Office at the Ministry of War. He was appointed Inspecteur g√©n√©ral aux revues with the rank of divisional general, and assigned to the Army of the Rhine until the end of 1801. He became a member of the Legion of Honour on 4 February 1804, an officer on 17 January 1805 and commander on 11 July 1807. At the start of the War of the Fourth Coalition in 1806 Villemanzy was replaced as Intendant- General of the Grande Arm√©e by Pierre-Antoine Daru. Villemanzy served as a commissary in the campaigns of 1806‚Äì09. After the Treaty of Sch√∂nbrunn (14 October 1809) ended the war with Austria, Napoleon made Villemanzy Intendant General of the Grande Arm√©e in Germany. Villemanzy asked for leave due to his age. Napoleon named him a member of the Senate of Empire in 1810, Baron of the Empire and then Count of the Empire in 1813. Bourbon Restoration (1814‚Äì30) After the first Bourbon Restoration of 6 April 1814, Louis XVIII of France named Villemanzy a Peer of France on 4 June 1814. Villemanzy supported the overthrow of Napoleon, so was unemployed during Napoleon's return of the Hundred Days (20 March ‚Äì 8 July 1815). Villemanzy voted for death at the 4 December 1815 trial of Marshal Ney. On 10 January 1816 he was appointed to the Grand Administrative Council of Les Invalides, and then to the Sinking Commission on 8 May 1817. He was appointed president of the newly created Caisse des D√©p√¥ts et Consignations. In the Upper House he defended constitutional freedoms and opposed emergency laws. He was made a Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour on 22 May 1823. He died at Versailles on 3 September 1830. Orillard de Villemanzy's name is on the Arc de Triomphe among those of Napoleon's generals.

Price Landfill is also known as Price Sanitary Landfill, Prices Pit, Price Landfill No.1 and Price Chemical Dump. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) added Price Landfill to the Superfund National Priorities List on September 20, 1983 because of the hazardous chemicals found on the site and in the groundwater. The site was originally owned by Mr. Charles Price and was used to mine sand and gravel, which was shut down in 1968. The site was then turned into a private landfill in 1969 and then a commercial solid waste landfill in 1971. At this point the landfill was used to dispose of liquid waste by companies, specifically Atlantic City Electric Company. The liquid waste consisted of industrial chemicals, oils and greases/sludges, septic tank and sewer wastes, which were disposed on the site for 8 years, ending altogether in 1976, but in the meantime, having contaminated the groundwater, soil, air, and nearby creeks, specifically Absecon Creek. Chemicals dumped on the site are believed to be 1,2-Dichloroethane, arsenic, benzene, chloroform, lead, and vinyl chloride, all of which contaminated the groundwater, soil, air, and nearby creeks. The USEPA originally got involved in 1982 by beginning to correct the damage. Currently the USEPA states that they are continuing to monitor and treat the groundwater and land, and that hazards to humans are controlled.  Origins  Price Landfill is located in the city of Pleasantville, New Jersey. Pleasantville is a small city in the Township of Egg Harbor that lies along the coast of southern New Jersey, just five miles from Atlantic City, New Jersey. The site of Price Landfill was contaminated with many hazardous chemicals from many companies, specifically Atlantic City Electric Company.  Town history  Price Landfill is a 26-acre site located in the city of Pleasantville, New Jersey. Pleasantville is a small city in Atlantic County, NJ, which according to the United States Census Bureau is 5.69 square miles as of 2010. Pleasantville was originally a borough and was officially announced as a city on April 14, 1914. Dr. David Ingersoll named this city Pleasantville because of its surroundings, as stated in the book, The Origin of New Jersey Place Names. The City of Pleasantville consists of stores, houses, schools, beaches and people, just like most cities around the United States. Pleasantville's mayor is Jesse L. Tweedle, Sr., accompanied by Linda D. Peyton, City Administrator, and the rest of their team. The community consists of 20,249 diverse people who reside within 6,699 homes, as stated in the United States Census of 2010. The town is just 5 miles from downtown Atlantic City, where the famous New Jersey shoreline and casinos are located. Also located nearby are Abescon, Northfield and Ventnor City.  Company history  Atlantic City Electric Company was founded in 1924 and is a part of Exelon Corporation. Atlantic City Electric Company, Inc. was the respondent to the administrative settlement agreement proposed by the USEPA in order to comply with the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) in 2011. This means that Atlantic City Electric Company, Inc. was the one being held liable for the overall damage to the Price Landfill Site. Although, 36 other companies and people also dumped at this site, the companies were mostly in connection to Atlantic City Electric Company, Inc. Before being used by Atlantic City Electric Company, Price Landfill was used as a sand and gravel excavation site owned by Mr. Charles Price, which was closed in 1968. The site was dug up to within 2 feet of the water table, which is the area of the ground that is above the area of groundwater. The site, which is now considered an inactive landfill, used to accept tons of chemical waste, whether in barrels, some of which have been punctured, or just poured directly onto the site.  Superfund designation  In the early 1980s, residents of the area surrounding Price Landfill became aware of the contaminants in their personal well water, as well as the Atlantic City Well Field. Price Landfill was placed on the National Priorities List on September 20, 1983.  State intervention  Many people in the area of Price Landfill own residential wells, which were found to be contaminated with volatile organic compounds, including benzene & chloroform, and arsenic in 1980. In 1980, officials of the state and locals came to the conclusion that the contaminated groundwater from the landfill was present in nearby private wells, as well as the Atlantic City Well Field, which is one mile from the landfill, and that this was a threat to the health of the community.  National intervention  The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) originally became involved in the site in 1982. The EPA placed the Price Landfill on the National Priorities List of Superfund Sites in 1983 in response to the results from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study to determine the significance of the contamination and how to clean it up. The EPA issued a Record of Decision in 1983, which moved the Atlantic City Well Field to another location, which took 2 years. The EPA also provided people affected by the contamination with public water supplies, such as bottled water. One year after work was complete, in 1986, the EPA issued a second ROD that stated their next moves for Price Landfill, which included: The EPA plans to build a fence around the site, build a system on the site to pump out the contaminated groundwater, clean and pretreat it, and send it to the Atlantic County Wastewater Treatment Facility to be further cleaned. At the end of the groundwater cleanup, the landfill will be capped, and the EPA will monitor the effects of this process within the next 25 years, which will cost a total of $9,050,000. The EPA later changed this plan because the Wastewater Treatment Facility changed their policies and would no longer accept the water from the landfill. The EPA and the NJDEP decided to build an on-site system which would clean the water of the chemicals, treat it and move it away from the site. The system was completed in 2000 and cleans and treats approximately 100,000 gallons of groundwater daily. This cleaning and treatment system was monitored for the following two years, and in 2002 the NJDEP began designing plans for the landfill cap and a better water cleaning and treating system. Completion of the design was expected in 2004. Construction of the groundwater treatment system was expected to be complete in late 2012, a year after the design for the landfill cap was complete. The final step of the second Record of Decision, the construction of a cap on the landfill, was originally expected to be finished in 2014, though as of December 2017, the cap is not complete.  Health and environmental hazards  The site is suspected to have 9 million gallons of industrial waste, which has caused groundwater to become contaminated with the chemical wastes, causing multiple people who neighbor the site to not be able to use the water. The chemicals dumped are 1,2- Dichloroethane, arsenic, benzene, chloroform, lead, and vinyl chloride. All of which contaminated either the groundwater, soil, air, or nearby creeks.  1,2-Dichloroethane  1,2-Dichloroethane is recognized as a carcinogen, meaning it can cause cancer if one is exposed to it for a long period of time. This chemical is highly flammable and has a strong, harsh scent and no color. There are eight tests that can be conducted to identify this chemical in a lab. It is ranked in the top 10% of the most hazardous compounds to human health and the environment, based on how toxic it is when ingested or inhaled, how it affects human health, cancer and noncancer risk scores through air and water, and how toxic it is to the environment. The overall hazard value of the chemical is 39, which puts it within the 100th percentile of other chemicals, making it in the top 10%. This chemical was found in the groundwater of the Price Landfill. 1,2- Dichloroethane can negatively affect health in these areas: Cardiovascular or Blood Toxicant, Developmental Toxicant, Gastrointestinal or Liver Toxicant, Kidney Toxicant, Neurotoxicant, Reproductive Toxicant, Respiratory Toxicant, and Skin or Sense Organ Toxicant. This means it can: cause blood diseases or abnormal heartbeat; affect the development of an unborn child; liver damage and disease; cause kidney disease which can lead to cancer; affect how the nerves carry information through the bodies peripheral nervous system which weakens the lower half of the body causing a tingling sensation and loss of coordination; affect fertility and may even cause the loss of a fetus during pregnancy; cause respiratory damage which can led to cancer; cause hearing loss or other damage of the 5 senses.  Arsenic  Arsenic is described as a metal, or a metal-type, meaning it is not usually found as pure metal. Arsenic can be found in wood preservatives, pesticides or in the manufacturing of some glass. Arsenic was found in groundwater and surface water at the Price Landfill site. Arsenic is recognized as a carcinogen, meaning it can cause cancer if one is exposed to it for a long period of time. It is also ranked in the top 10% of the most hazardous chemicals to human health and the environment, based on how toxic it is when ingested or inhaled, cancer and noncancer risk scores through air and water, and how toxic it is to the environment. The overall hazard value of the chemical is 30, which puts it in the 100th percentile of other chemicals, making it in the top 10% of hazardous compounds. The chemical can negatively affect health in these areas: Developmental Toxicant, Cardiovascular or Blood Toxicant, Endocrine Toxicant, Gastrointestinal or Liver Toxicant, Immunotoxicant, Kidney Toxicant, Neurotoxicant, Reproductive Toxicant, Respiratory Toxicant, Skin or Sense Organ Toxicant. This means it can: affect the development of an unborn child; cause blood diseases or abnormal heartbeat; weaken the endocrine system leading to diabetes, hormone imbalances, reproductive disorders or cancer; cause liver damage and disease; weaken the immune system which can lead to disease or cancer; cause kidney disease which can lead to cancer; affect how the nerves carry information through the bodies peripheral nervous system which weakens the lower half of the body causing a tingling sensation and loss of coordination; affect fertility and may even cause the loss of a fetus during pregnancy; cause respiratory damage which can led to cancer; cause hearing loss or other damage of the 5 senses.  Benzene  Benzene is a clear liquid and can be described as being sweet smelling. It was once one of the top 20 used chemicals in the United States, being found in gasoline, rubber, plastics, oils, and even explosives. Benzene is also a carcinogen, meaning it can cause cancer if one is exposed to it for a long period of time. It is ranked in the top 10% of the most hazardous compounds to human health and the environment, based on how toxic it is when ingested or inhaled, how it affects human health, workers exposure to the chemical, cancer and noncancer risk scores through air and water, and how toxic it is to the environment. The overall hazard value of the chemical is 48, which puts it within the 100th percentile of other chemicals, making it in the top 10% of hazardous compounds. This chemical can cause the following negative health effects: Developmental Toxicant, Reproductive Toxicant, Cardiovascular or Blood Toxicant, Endocrine Toxicant, Gastrointestinal or Liver Toxicant, Immunotoxicant, Neurotoxicant, Respiratory Toxicant, Skin or Sense Organ Toxicant.

It has been in this process since the 1980s, when the USEPA first got involved in 1982. Originally the USEPA ran tests with the NJDEP and began to take steps in order to make it safe for people and stop the spread of the contamination as well as begin to rehabilitate the site.  Initial cleanup  After two years of the people around Price Landfill having found that their water was contaminated, the USEPA got involved. The agency provided a water alternative, such as bottled water, to around 37 of the affected neighbors of the Price Landfill site. The USEPA and the NJDEP conducted studies and collected samples of the soil and other substances at the site in order to find out how contaminated the area really was. To guarantee that the contamination didn't spread to the Atlantic City (ACMUA) public water supply well field, the USEPA and the State of New Jersey began construction to connect to the New Jersey Water Company (NJWC) system, updated three wells of the ACMUA, set up filter systems and began to conserve water through a program.

The show is itself based on the characters created by DC Comics set in the Batman mythology. The episode was written by Tze Chun and directed by Scott White. It was first broadcast on October 19, 2017. In the episode, after Alex's funeral, Bruce discovers Ra's has a likely possibility to be released from prison and sets to go and kill him himself using the knife. Gordon and Alfred become worried about what Bruce could do and set to find him. Meanwhile, Butch Gilzean's body is dropped from the hospital to a swamp where he is reborn under a new identity, \\"Solomon Grundy.\\" He is soon discovered by Nygma who is also suffering from a severe identity crisis. Cobblepot and Sofia also meet to discuss business. The episode received mostly positive reviews, with critics praising Siddig's and Mazouz's performances as Ra and Bruce. However, Penguin's subplot received criticism. Plot After being in a coma for six months, Butch Gilzean's (Drew Powell) body is taken out of the hospital in order to make room. Afterward, he is dumped into Slaughter Swamp where his body is dropped into a lake that also contains toxic chemicals left over from Indian Hill. Bruce (David Mazouz) decides to use the knife to kill Ra's (Alexander Siddig) as revenge for Alex's death. During Alex's funeral, Alfred (Sean Pertwee) is warned by Gordon (Ben McKenzie) that Ra's has diplomatic immunity and will be released from incarceration. Meanwhile, Barbara (Erin Richards) visits Ra's in Blackgate Penitentiary in an escape attempt but Ra's states that he just wants to say goodbye. When they touch hands through the glass, light passes between the two of them, to Barbara's surprise seemingly giving her an unknown power. She asks him what he did, to which Ra's says she would see very soon. Back on Slaughter Swamp, Butch suddenly wakes up in a zombie-like state. He wanders around the area to find a group of campers. He attacks the campers with a superhuman resistance and strength. Suffering amnesia, he adopts the name of a nursery rhyme, Solomon Grundy. Nygma (Cory Michael Smith) robs a pharmacy in search of a cure for his mental condition, but the pharmacist (Albert M. Chan) injures Nygma and escapes, calling the police. Making his escape, Nygma literally runs into Grundy. Bruce arrives at Blackgate and manages to enter Ra's cell, ready to kill him. However, he hesitates and decides to leave only to be ambushed by Ra's and assassins from the League of Shadows posing as guards. They take him to the underground of the penitentiary while Gordon and Alfred investigate upstairs. Ra's tells Bruce that the knife was brought to him for his resurrection, having a vision of him as his heir and he is the only person who can kill him. Gordon and Alfred manage to defeat the guards and reach the room. Ra's begin taunting Bruce, threatening to kill his loved ones in the future, prompting an angry Bruce to finally stab him in the chest. This causes Ra's to age in the pace of a few seconds until becoming a decaying corpse. In the aftermath, Gordon decides not to report Bruce murdering Ra's. Bruce decides to leave his vigilantism and leaves the suit for Alfred. Meanwhile, pretending that he was his friend before his rebirth, Nygma takes Grundy to a fight club headed by a woman named Cherry (Marina Benedict). Cherry sends Butch to the medic for inspection, where it is revealed that Lee (Morena Baccarin) is secretly working there as the new doctor. Production Development In September 2017, it was announced that the fifth episode of the season would be titled \\"The Blade's Path\\" and was to be written by Tze Chun on his writing debut and directed by Scott White. Casting Camren Bicondova, Jessica Lucas, and Chris Chalk don't appear in the episode as their respective characters. In September 2017, it was announced that the guest cast for the episode would include Kelcy Griffin as Detective Harper, and Marina Benedict as Cherry.

This was on par in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 2.75 million viewers with a 0.9/3 in the 18-49 demographics.

Critical reviews \\"A Dark Knight: The Blade's Path\\" received mostly positive reviews from critics. Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a \\"good\\" 7.7 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict, \\"Bruce's endgame (and seemingly final confrontation) with Ra's made for a pretty good central story as Gotham often operates at its best when it's beholden to nothing except the 'Batman' lore it wants to use for its own purposes. If this was the true final stand of Ra's in this iteration of the story, then so be it. He already tried to destroy the city and play head games with Bruce. Done and done. Also, Solomon Grundy was a goofy good time. It will always be odd having Butch, after three seasons, transform into Grundy, but it's working.\\" Nick Hogan of TV Overmind gave the episode a 4-star rating out of 5, writing \\"Overall, this was a solid episode of Gotham. It wasn't perfect, but it was fun to explore these different dynamics. And I was definitely excited to find Lee Thompkins back on my TV.\\" Sydney Bucksbaum of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \\"Is that really the end of Ra's on Gotham? Or will he resurrect somehow and this is the start of a new kind of reign for him? And what does killing Ra's mean for Bruce? Will he now have to take over Ra's' reign? And what 'gift' did Ra's give to Babs (Erin Richards) before he died? There are so many questions left to be answered!\\" Vinnie Mancuso of Collider wrote, \\"Tonight's episode of Gotham, titled 'The Blade's Path,' was one of those rare Balloonman specials: an entry so beautifully absurd that it transcends the show's regular status of silly fun to become something more, like a child accidentally finger-painting the Mona Lisa. I'm not even sure where to begin, to be honest.\\" Lisa Babick of TV Fanatic gave the series a perfect 5 star rating out of 5, writing \\"Bruce broke his one rule when Ra's al Ghul pushed him to his limit, and Sofia Falcone tried to weasel her way into Penguin's heart, but the highlight of Gotham Season 4 Episode 5 was when Ed Nygma met the new and improved Butch Gilzean.

The show is itself based on the characters created by DC Comics set in the Batman mythology. The episode was written by Kim Newton and directed by Mark Tonderai. It was first broadcast on October 26, 2017. The episode revolves around Gordon and Bullock tracing to a serial killer who has been targeting corrupt police officers. The killer, also known as \\"Professor\\", has been targeting the officers and put pig masks on their heads. Gordon confronts the killer and discovers more information regarding Bullock. Meanwhile, Nygma uses Butch for personal gain in the fight club to win money. He also tries to get Lee to help him deal with his problems but he also finds more about her. Also, Cobblepot begins following Sofia as it seems she's hiding something. The episode also marks the live-action debut of Professor Pyg. The episode received positive reviews from critics, who praised Michael Cerveris' performance as Professor Pyg as well as Nygma's storyline, but Cobblepot's subplot received criticism. Plot At the fight club, Nygma (Cory Michael Smith) talks with Lee (Morena Baccarin) for help in order to fix his identity crisis but she angrily refuses to help him following his previous actions. Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor) and Sofia (Crystal Reed) meet in order to fully acknowledge each other's partnership. In another part of the city, a police officer investigates a gunshot. While searching the area, he is butchered by a man wearing a pig mask. Gordon (Ben McKenzie) and Bullock (Donal Logue) investigate the murder, finding the killer put a pig's head on the officer's head. The officer also was a bagman on Cobblepot's payroll. After interrogating Cobblepot, Gordon gets a clue from a man, Wally Clarke (Will Janowitz), who applied for a license, discovering a headless pig in his apartment. Wally states that he just retrieved the pigs from a butchery and left it for a man known as the \\"Professor\\". Cobblepot meets for dinner with Sofia but when she fails to show up, he has Zsasz (Anthony Carrigan) to follow her. In the fight club, Grundy (Drew Powell) manages to beat another fighter for money, much to Nygma's delight. Nygma then finds out that Lee is leading a clinic in her apartment to help people. Gordon and Bullock get a clue from an informant about dirty cops that may be affiliated to the Professor. They find them dead on a bench with their pig masks on but get a lead that a white van left the bodies. Another officer is also kidnapped by the Professor. They follow to a warehouse where they find the officer. However, he has a grenade in his stomach, killing him and knocking Gordon and Bullock out. Gordon wakes up tied to a chair where he is confronted by the Professor (Michael Cerveris). The Professor states that he was once a cop but decided to end the corruption by killing any corrupted officer. The Professor leaves to kill Bullock in another room. Gordon manages to free himself, but the Professor cuts Bullock's throat and escapes. Cobblepot is told by Zsasz that Sofia seemingly bought an abandoned hospital and was seen meeting with many businessmen. However, she shows him that in fact, she has opened an orphanage and is forgiven for his misstep. Lee, after finding her medicine is running out in the clinic, decides to accept Nygma's money and help him with his identity crisis. She also states that she's only remaining in Gotham because she feels responsible for the Tetch virus. Bullock wakes up and is confronted by Gordon, who tells him he knows that he has been on Cobblepot's payroll. Bullock finally admits he has been on his payroll since the licenses began, saying his debts were the main reasons. Gordon tells him it will stop. The Professor, now dubbed by media as \\"Professor Pyg\\", is seen taking care of pigs in an undisclosed area.

On September 2017, Michael Cerveris joined the show as Lazlo Valentin / Professor Pyg, in a multi-episode role. Cerveris stated, \\"Professor Pyg is a brilliant and chameleon-like person who has a highly developed sense of what's right and wrong ‚Äî it just might not be a sense of right and wrong that corresponds with everybody else's.\\" He also added that, \\"When they [the writers] had somebody who played Sweeney Todd, they knew the direction they wanted to go... [Broadway fans who don't watch Gotham] might give it a look simply because of that, and find that they have a new favorite show.\\" Donal Logue stated, \\"We have Michael Cerveris coming in and playing Professor Pyg and he's such an incredibly gifted actor and, as happens a lot, the gentlest and most gifted of artistic souls can play the darkest, creepiest human beings known to literature or film.\\" David Mazouz, Sean Pertwee, Erin Richards, Camren Bicondova, Jessica Lucas, Chris Chalk, and Alexander Siddig don't appear in the episode as their respective characters.

Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a \\"good\\" 7.3 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict, \\"The first live-action Professor Pyg certainly looked and sounded cool, but the attempt to weave him into the ongoing plot involving the corrupt GCPD only diluted his demented nature and turned him into a drag. From the ashes though came Harvey Bullock's biggest, and saddest, moment in years.\\" Nick Hogan of TV Overmind gave the episode a 4.5 star rating out of 5, writing \\"I don't know if this is the best episode of the season, but it's very close (I'm rather fond of the episode that Ben McKenzie directed). There was a compelling villain and it really reminded me of all the reasons I love the show.\\" Sydney Bucksbaum of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \\"What does this mean for their friendship and working relationship moving forward? Can Bullock redeem himself? Will Gordon ever forgive him? Either way, Pyg is still on the loose, so Bullock's in danger of him finishing the job unless Gordon can find and arrest the pig-obsessed killer first.\\" Vinnie Mancuso of Collider wrote, \\"The episode, which was in fact 'Very Good.' That wondrous title refers to the arrival of Batman rogue Professor Pyg, played with terrifying enthusiasm by two-time Tony-winner Michael Cerveris. Cerveris commits, man. It's the difference between a grown- ass man saying 'oink, oink, little piggy' being hilarious and being horrifying. In the grand Gotham tradition, this character is both at once.\\" Lisa Babick of TV Fanatic gave the series a perfect 5 star rating out of 5, writing \\"Professor Pyg has arrived, and he's as gruesome as ever. He didn't have a lot of screen time on Gotham Season 4 Episode 6, but when he was on screen, it was creepy as hell. And the most amazing part of his whole performance was when he spared Jim's life because he believed Jim was one of the good guys. I'm not going to go off on another long Jim tangent, but Pyg hasn't been paying attention.\\" Marc Buxton of Den of Geek gave wrote, \\"Last week I asked, when did Gotham become a guided tour anthology series about the DC Universe? Take a look at this week's episode. We have a debut of a very modern DC villain, a weird Of Mice And Men riff centering on an underground fight club and a budding romance for the Penguin. How do all these diverse aspects fit together? They don't. At all. But for some reason on some batshit strange level, it all still works.\\" References  External links  Gotham (season 4) episodes 2017 American television episodes ","title":"Hog Day Afternoon (Gotham)"},{"id":"55466032","text":"Fan Xuefei (born 9 October 1990) is a Chinese lightweight rower.

Witches, demons and ghosts are thought to appear and to be at their most powerful. Black magic is thought to be most effective at this time. In the Western Christian tradition, the hour between 3 and 4 a.m. was considered a period of peak supernatural activity, due to the absence of prayers in the canonical hours during this period. The phrase \\"witching hour\\" was first recorded in 1793. The New Zealand Oxford Dictionary identifies midnight as the time when witches are supposedly active. Psychological literature suggests that apparitional experiences and sensed presences are most common between the hours of 2 and 4 a.m., corresponding with a 3 a.m. peak in the amount of melatonin in the body. The term may be used colloquially to refer to any period of bad luck, or in which something bad is seen as having a greater likelihood of occurring. In investing, it is the last hour of stock trading between 3 pm (when the U.S. bond market closes) and 4 pm EST (when the U.S. stock market closes), which can be characterized by higher-than-average volatility. In American Football it is the time towards the end of the 4th quarter where losses become wins and wins become losses.

He is well-regarded as the First Ayurvedic practitioner in Kerala to be awarded with the title of \\"Vaidyaratna\\", given to the native medical practitioners in India, by the erstwhile British Raj in India. Vaidya, in Indian language means a medical practitioner, and ratna means jewel. Only three such awards were ever given by the British Raj in the state of Kerala, which was part of Madras Presidency then . The second award was given to E.T.Narayanan Mooss of Thaikkattussery , in the year of 1923 and third was given to Vaidyaratnam P. S. Warrier of Kottakkal in the year 1934. The second and third Vaidyaratna awardees had business acumen as well and they had established their Ayurvedic hospitals which are being run by their successors even today. In contrast, the first awardee, Triprangode Parameswaran Moossad had not established any commercial institutions. He had taken a lead role in establishing the Keraleeya Ayurveda Samajam, an organization founded by several scholars of those times, with the objective of making the benefits of Ayurveda system of treatment available to all the sections of the society, irrespective of the caste, creed and religion. It is notable that T.P. Moossad had lived during troubled times, wherein India was still under colonial rule of the British Raj, and the country was highly caste-driven,orthodox and very poor. Moossad, along with his several associates had established the Samajam, breaking several social barriers in their efforts to give relief to many from various diseases. Life and career Vaidyaratnam T P Moossad with disciples and family members - photo dated 1914 Triprangode Kizhakkempullath Parameswaran Moossad was born in 1847 in Triprangode in Malappuram district in Kerala, India, in a family of Sanskrit and Ayurveda scholars belonging to the Moossad community . He learned his lessons in Sanskrit and Ayurveda system of medicine under his own paternal uncle, Kizhakkempullath Sankaran Moossad (alias Kunjunni Moossad) who was a renowned scholar of his times. Information on his life and career can be traced only through documents written in Malayalam. An old Malayalam book, published in the year 1920, and reproduced in a recent Malayalam book gives a very brief account of his life and career. According to this, he was a scholarly practitioner of Ayurveda and also a social reformer, highly acclaimed for his pro-people attitudes. He was part of the administration as Taluk Board Member and District Board Member for several years. He had been a medical adviser at several palaces - Kollenkode Palace, Kadathanadu Palace, Chirakkal Palace, Mankada Palace etc. He died in 1919 at the age of 72. He was succeeded by his son Kizhakkempullath Narayanan Moossad, who was also a practitioner of Ayurveda, but could not reach the professional excellence as achieved by his father. Major awards and Recognitions Citation of the Vaidyaratna title In 1914, in recognition of his services to humanity, Triprangode Parameswaran Moossad was conferred the title of 'Vaidyaratna' by His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor General of India.. Prior to this he was given various awards by the kings of Kingdom of Kochi and Travancore including jewel-studded gold bracelets known as 'Veerashringala'. Sometime around 1910, he was invited by the then Judge of Bombay High Court, Sir Narayan Chandavarkar, for treating a chronic disease in his family. Moossad could completely cure the ailing patient which was a great surprise for Sir Chandavarkar and more so for the Chief Justice of Bombay High Court,Sir Basil Scott. This incident paved the way for recommending Moossad's name for the award of the title of Vaidyaratna by the Viceroy of British Raj in India, which was eventually awarded to him on 1 January 1914. According to a Newsclip Souvenir available with the descendants of Moossad, he was the third awardee of Vaidyaratna in the Madras Presidency.

She had studied medicine to escape a scandal after she eloped with and then killed her first husband. He had agreed it was self-defence before he died. She married again only to find out years later that her husband had two complete families and two wives. Early life Lucy Virginia \\"Dockie\\" Meriwether was born in Huntsville, Alabama, on April 18, 1862. The daughter of Lide Parker Smith and Niles Meriwether, she took a personal independence naturally. In 1882 she graduated from the Augusta Female Seminary in Stanton, Virginia. Career Virginia Meriwether Davis There was a lot of gossip after she shot and killed her husband even though everyone including the victim agreed it was self- defence. To avoid this, Virginia Meriwether Davis did not go home but went to New York to study medicine at the New York Infirmary for Indigent Women and Children of which Dr. Emily Blackwell was founder and dean. She was graduated in 1886 from the Woman's Medical College with the honors of her class, becoming one of the first female doctors in the United States, and remained in New York to practice. Her medical work has been almost exclusively in connection with the New York Infant Asylum, where she served as resident physician for four years. The institution had at the time the largest lying-in service conducted by women in the United States, and the lowest mortality and sick rates of any lying-in wards in the world. Personal life Virginia Meriwether Davies and son Four months after her graduation in 1882, Virginia Meriwether and her sister both eloped on the same night. She eloped with Lowe Davis and married him. After the honeymoon she discovered that he was an opium and gambling addict and she left him and returned to the care of her mother. She took her daughter away to the spa of Rhea Springs to recover. Lowe Davis agreed to let her alone but he visited her with a gun which Meriwether's mother persuaded him to relinquish. He left but returned later with another gun with which he threatened Meriwether. She now had the first gun and shot him in the abdomen. Her husband left and before he died he admitted that she had shot him in self-defense and he deserved it. Meriwether showed little emotion at becoming a widow. In 1892 she married Arthur Bowen Davies (1862‚Äì1928), an unsuccessful, but later renowned, artist, whom she met in 1890 while chief resident physician at the New York Infant Asylum. Her parents bought her a farm which they had discovered together, although at one point she had considered buying the property with a woman called Lucile du Pre who was very attracted to Meriwether. Arthur and Meriwether had two sons, Niles Meriwether Davies, Sr. (b. 1893) and Arthur David Davies (b. 1895). When her husband died in 1928, she discovered that he had kept hidden a second life, with another common-law wife, Edna, and family. Edna discovered that she was given a subsistence allowance by Arthur, despite his financial success as an artist. She died on April 17, 1949, at the farm in Congers, New York, she owned. At 87, she was the oldest practicing woman physician in New York State. Legacy The Virginia M. Davies Correspondence, 1891‚Äì1935 is preserved at Helen Farr Sloan Library & Archives, Delaware Art Museum. Davies Farm, the only working farm left in Congers, is owned by Niles Meriwether Davies Jr., grandson of Virginia Meriwether Davies. The farm was a wedding present of Virginia Meriwether Davies's father to his daughter. The 110-acre farm on the eastern side of Lake DeForest produces corn, squash and 20 varieties of apples. Every summer, the Davies Farm hosts the \\"Pick Your Own\\" apple sales.

It was operated by the Ministry of Prison Systems, most recently under minister Iris Varela, from 1958-2013. Typical of a Venezuelan prison, it was severely overcrowded, with inadequate access to medical care, food, and clean water, and violence among prisoners was common. Gangs of inmates had control over the prison, and were led by a \\"pran\\" (inmate leader). The prison was closed after 55 years of operation due to government intervention and is now being converted into a museum.  Facilities   Prison life Home of 3,700 inmates, the overcrowded prison was built to occupy 700 prisoners as of 2013. Of this number, an estimated 192 of them were children of the inmates. The prison was run by prisoners themselves, following the trend of 80% of Venezuelan prisons which are run by their prisoners. As the population continued to grow inside Maracaibo National Prison, it far exceeded its intended population.  Structure  Throughout its construction in 1958, Maracaibo National Prison was split into 4 main areas. The first of which Procemil was formed to house military officers and police agents. Reeducation hosted criminals with light charges. Prison contained a variety of standard prisoners. Maximum housed the criminals with the most serious charges.  Notable incidents   1994 Riot and Fire  On January 3, 1994, a riot broke out in the prison as a result of ongoing gang activity. A fire was started by a group of inmates, and then they subsequently shot or stabbed other inmates who tried to escape the fire. While there is some dispute over the number of casualties and injuries during the incident, many more prisoners were killed when security personnel attempted to take control of the prison, with some sources claiming over 150 casualties. This riot brought attention to the poor conditions in Venezuelan prisons, and is often cited as one of the deadliest prison incidents to date.  Other riots  Smaller riots also occurred regularly in Maracaibo National Prison, with authorities claiming it to be gang violence among prisoners. In 2012 it was reported that as few as 8 wardens were on duty at any time, with an additional 32 Venezuelan National Guard officers patrolling the outside. Due to this lack of security personnel, gang violence was common, with 69 prisoners killed in 2013 alone.  Raids  While the governmental control over the prison was weak, raids by government forces frequently yielded massive amounts of weapons and drugs. One raid even discovered a collection of jungle animals housed in the prison, including a few endangered species.  Notable inmates  Mocho Edwin was the \\"pran\\" in Maracaibo National Prison at the prison's closing. He was first imprisoned in 2006, but was soon after released in 2007. Since then, he was sent to Maracaibo for committing triple homicide. Edwin was known for drug sales and prostitution throughout the prison and connections with the outside world after being seen with Iris Varela.  In media  Maracaibo National Prison is often viewed as a place of terror. With constant gang violence and death, reporters have placed a veil of violence over the prison.

From the age of five months to six years, she was kept strapped down in the attic of her home, malnourished and unable to speak or move. She was discovered and rescued in 1938, but died at the age of ten before she was able to fully recover from hemorrhagic jaundice. Anna is often compared to the feral children cases of Isabelle and Genie. Family Anna was born March 6, 1932, In Perryopolis, Pennsylvania, about outside of Uniontown. She was the second illegitimate child of her mother, Martha Harris, who was 27 at the time of Anna's discovery. She lived with Anna's grandfather, David Harris, a widowed farmer who strongly disapproved of her mother's indiscretions. After Anna was found, Martha married a man by the name of George I. Eisenhauer. Martha died in Philadelphia in 1959. David Harris died at the age of 72 in 1948. He was the son of the late Jacob and Catherine Cochran Harris. His children included daughters Martha and Catherine Elwell and sons Jacob and Harold.  Early life  Anna was born in a nurse's private home and was brought to the family farm, but shortly after was sent to live at her mother's friend's house. A local minister considered adopting Anna, but decided against it when he discovered she had vaginitis. At the age of three weeks, Anna was sent to live in a children's home. There, she was said to be \\"terribly galled and otherwise in very bad shape\\". After eight weeks in the home, Anna's mother was called to come collect her. In her place, she sent a man and his wife to see Anna in hopes of adopting her, but the agency refused to give permission because they disapproved of the couple. Later, the mother came herself and gave Anna to the couple. A short time after, a social worker found Anna at this home and attempted to convince her mother and grandfather to take her back. At this time, Anna was over four months old. She was taken to another children's home where a medical examination revealed she had vaginitis, umbilical hernia, and a skin rash. Anna was sent to a private foster home after three weeks in the children's home. Due to the fact that the mother and the grandfather could not pay for the child's care, she was sent back to live on the family farm at the age of five and a half months. In an attempt to avoid her father's anger, Martha kept her in an attic-like room on the second floor. Her mother was busy working on the farm during the day and occasionally went out at night. Anna was given only enough care to keep her alive and received no instruction or positive attention. She was fed virtually nothing else except for cow's milk and was strapped down to a chair or a cot for the majority of her early life. An article in the New York Times stated that Anna had been kept in the attic room, which was without windows or ventilation, for two years, and then kept for three years more in the storage room in the second floor. However, a later report in the American Journal of Sociology by Kingsley Davis considers it ‚Äúdoubtful that the child's hands at the time of discovery were tied. It is more likely that she was confined to her crib in the first period of life and at all times kept locked in her room to keep her from falling down the steep stairs leading immediately from the door and to keep the grandfather from seeing her. It is doubtful if the child was ever kept in the attic, as the report also stated‚Äù. When interviewed by officers, David Harris was quoted saying: \\"I made her keep it up there, care for it and feed it as a sort of punishment. I forgave her first [illegitimate child], but not the second\\". The same New York Times article quotes Martha: \\"My father wouldn't let me bring it downstairs. He said he didn't want to see it around. I had to run up and down, up and down, to feed and take care of it. I had to feed it all the time. It was awfully hard\\". The name of the father was withheld, but Martha said the girl's father was a well-to-do farmer.  Rescue  Anna was discovered around February 6, 1938 by E. M. Smith of the Western Pennsylvania Humane Society about seventeen miles from Uniontown, Pennsylvania. The humane officer found the child after a report had been filed from the Woman's Club of Star Junction. Other reports had also been spread that a child was kept in the house, yet she was never seen by visitors. When Anna was found, the Humane officer reported that: \\"The child was dressed in a dirty shirt and napkin. Her hands, arms and legs were just bones, with skin drawn over them, so frail she couldn't use them. She never grew normally, and the chair on which she lay, half reclining and half sitting was so small the child had to double her legs partly under her\\". The chair that she was found in was tilted backwards to lean on a coal bucket with her arms tied above her head, leaving her unable to talk or move. Charges of negligence to a minor were brought up against Harris and Martha. The grandfather was freed after Judge J. Russell Carr dismissed the case for lack of evidence. Dr John Kerr of Connellsville testified at the trial. He declared: \\"it was about the most deplorable condition I have ever seen in all those years\\". He testified she had a severe lack of muscle, abnormal bones, and that she couldn't see or hear. He believed that, had she been properly nourished, she would have been a \\"normal\\" child. Martha, her mother, claimed that she tried feeding her child meat and other solid foods but that they made her gag. She denied the statements that the child had been kept imprisoned in an attic.  Recovery  When Anna was first rescued, Drs. J. F. Kerr and D. F. Newell assessed that she was undernourished, that the bones in her legs were softened and twisted out of normal shape and that she was suffering from rickets. She was also believed to be deaf as she didn't respond to others. It was later discovered as she recovered that the deafness was organic rather than functional. She additionally could not walk, talk, and showed little signs of intelligence. Once she was determined a ward of the county and placed in the Fayette County Home, Anna began improving rapidly. She had gained seven pounds by the end of the summer in 1938 but continued to struggle with simple speech and walking. She was enrolled in the Margaret Duer Judge school for \\"sub-normal\\" children. By the age of 9, she began developing signs of speech and was approaching social norms. She could respond to simple commands, feed herself, and remember some people, but she still could not speak, and had the approximate intelligence of a 1-year-old child. A report filed in November 6, 1939 describes her state as follows: \\"Anna walks about aimlessly, makes periodic rhythmic motions of her hands, and, at intervals, makes guttural and sucking noises. She regards her hands as if she had seen them for the first time. It was impossible to hold her attention for more than a few seconds at a time-not because of distraction due to external stimuli but because of her inability to concentrate. She ignored the task in hand to gaze vacantly about the room. Speech is entirely lacking. Numerous unsuccessful attempts have been made with her in the hope of developing initial sounds. I do not believe that this failure is due to negativism or deafness but that she is not sufficiently developed to accept speech at this time .... The prognosis is not favorable\\". Her teachers described her as having a pleasant disposition, but unfortunately, Anna died soon after.  Death  After a life of just over ten years, Anna died on August 6, 1942. Her death was caused by hemorrhagic jaundice, a form of jaundice in which injury and anemia are present. There is no cited evidence that her condition was linked to her isolation. The Fayette County commissioners paid for the funeral and burial of Anna in Delaware Cemetery, near the Judge School in Milford where she had last lived.  Comparisons to other cases  Anna's case is commonly compared to the study of another feral child, Isabelle, because of their similar upbringings. Anna and Isabelle were both raised in isolation for a similar amount of time, but Isabelle was able to recover much faster and achieve greater mental development. Isabelle was born one month after Anna and was discovered nine months after Anna. Similarly to Anna, Isabelle was forced into isolation because she was an illegitimate child. During her six and a half years of isolation, Isabelle lived with her deaf and mute mother. She had no concept of relationships, no verbal skills, and was malnourished. Following Isabelle's discovery, she was hospitalized and her apathetic behavior was closely monitored. She was then transferred to a ward with children where she became socialized and learned to imitate the other children. She also began language training with a skilled team of doctors and within eighteen months had gained the understanding and use of an estimated 1500‚Äì2500 words, enabling her to produce complex sentences and correctly use inflection morphology, pronouns, and prepositions by the age of eight. As soon as a year and a half after her discovery, Isabelle was energetic and fully mobile. By fourteen, she was excelling in public school. The recovery of Isabelle is clearly different than Anna. In both cases they had very low intellectual abilities when they were discovered and introduced into the world. Their differences arise, however, when one considers that two years after Isabelle's discovery she was deemed to be recovered and a fully functioning girl, but prior to Anna's death she only ever reached the level of socialization of a two or three-year-old child. The varying recovery between Anna and Isabelle is suspected to be the result of Anna having less initial mental capacity prior to isolation or to her receiving a lesser standard of care and verbal training during her recovery than Isabelle's team of skilled doctors and physiologists offered her. Some also account Isabelle's recovery to the fact that she was in isolation with her mother. However, the exact reason is hard to pinpoint because Anna died at the age of ten before this could be investigated any further. Another case Anna is commonly compared to is feral child Genie. While growing up, Genie's father became convinced that Genie was severely mentally retarded, causing him to withhold from her care and attention. At approximately the time she reached the age of 20 months, this belief of Genie's father caused him to keep her as socially isolated as possible and until she reached the age of 13 years and 7 months he kept her locked alone in a room. During this time, Genie was strapped to a child's toilet or bound in her crib. This caused Genie's arms and legs to remain completely immobilized. Her father forbade anyone from interacting with her, provided her with almost no stimulation of any kind, and left her severely malnourished and unable to mobilize. The extent of her isolation prevented her from being exposed to any significant amount of speech or human interaction, and as a result she did not acquire language during her childhood, similar to Anna. Her abuse came to the attention of Los Angeles child welfare authorities on November 4, 1970 and this caused a media frenzy. Following her discovery, Genie was followed by scientists, physiologists, and linguists. Genie has lived much longer than Anna and is believed to be 60 or 61 years old (as of 2017), but she has yet to acquire a functional first language. Unlike Anna, psychologists and linguists continue to frequently discuss Genie to this day, and there is considerable academic and media interest in her development and the research team's methods, since Genie's case has demonstrated the necessity of early language stimulation in the left hemisphere of the brain to start. The discoveries made through Genie's following and scientific testing relate to Anna because it explains that Anna's lack of language stimulation during her isolated childhood are the basis for why she was never able to acquire the verbal communication skills expected of her age up until the time of her early death. Her death was most likely linked to her isolation earlier in her life.  Ethical dispute  The difficulty in treating feral children cases like Anna is that the line between care and therapy is blurred. As seen with Genie's case, putting scientific advancement over her personal care is a pitfall that all scientists were guilty of to some degree. Families that had no background in abused child psychology were not equipped to care for her, and scientists that were equipped also were invested in researching how to better treat future children. Additionally Paul Lutus argues that psychology is not a real science because the outcome is not determined by the treatment. And all successes become research somewhere down the line. This is especially true in any feral child case as there is no ethical way to perform social isolation experiments on children to the extent of someone like Anna. Psychological treatment relies on a code that ensures professionalism and quality care necessary to gain the trust of the child. The goal is to support the patient so that they can pursue development and autonomy while the psychologist resists potentially controlling or coercing compliance. Treating feral children is understandably difficult as they have little to no means of communication, and are ineffective at communicating wants and desires in a meaningful way. Ethics comes into dispute when the line between teaching and parenting becomes thin.

In 1801 she assumed British registry and her name was changed to Juliana. Her owners sold her to the Transport Board but in 1804 the government resold her and she was sailing as a West Indiaman between London and Antigua. She then made two voyages for the British East India Company (EIC), and one voyage to Hobart, Van Dieman's Land, transporting convicts. On her return from this voyage she wrecked in 1821 on the English coast. Career Juliana was accepted into the Registry of Great Britain on 14 December 1801.

ElectroData originated as a part of Consolidated Electrodynamics Corporation (CEC), which manufactured scientific equipment. Clifford Berry and Sibyl M. Rock developed an analog computer to process the output of CEC's mass spectrometer. Berry then urged CEC to develop a digital computer as a follow- on. In 1951 CEC enlisted Harry Huskey, who managed the development of the SWAC computer on the project. In May, 1952, CEC pre-announced the \\"CEC 30-201\\" computer, a vacuum tube computer with a magnetic drum memory. That same year CEC reorganized computer development into a separate Computer Division. In 1954 the division was spun off into a separate public company named ElectroData. In 1954 the first model of the computer, now named the Datatron 203 shipped to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. The purchase price was $125,000. The company shipped seven more 203 systems in 1954 and thirteen in 1955. By 1956 ElectroData was the third-largest computer manufacturer in the world, but was unable to generate enough revenue to meet the demands of growing the business. That year Burroughs Corporation, at that time a manufacturer of electro-mechanical office equipment, made a deal to acquire ElectroData in a stock swap, and renamed it the ElectroData Division of Burroughs Corporation.

Early life Pei was born in 1989 in Beijing, China, shortly after which he along with his parents moved to the United States. A couple of years later, his family moved to Sweden, where Pei grew up. Pei pursued a Bachelor of Science degree in 2008 at the Stockholm School of Economics, but dropped out in 2011 to work full-time in the Chinese smartphone industry. Career Pei joined Nokia in 2010, and worked at the company for three months. After Nokia, the fan website Pei had created about Meizu had caught the attention of the company's Hong Kong branch, where Pei started working in Meizu's marketing team in 2011. In November 2012, Pei joined Oppo as its international markets manager, where he worked directly under Pete Lau. OnePlus Pei co-founded OnePlus with Pete Lau in December 2013. Their first OnePlus device, the OnePlus One, sold close to a million units in 2014, despite a sales target of only 50,000, according to Pei. In July 2015, Pei presented the OnePlus 2 through a virtual reality video on YouTube. It was claimed to be the first product launch in virtual reality, and the video has been viewed over 294,000 times as of April 2020. After the unveiling of the OnePlus 3 in June 2016 Pei claimed it was the company's most popular smartphone, based on the Net Promoter Score tracked by OnePlus. When asked about the reasoning about releasing the OnePlus 3T only a few months later in November 2016, Pei said the reason for the upgrade from the OnePlus 3 to the OnePlus 3T was because they did not want to wait to improve the hardware. Pei claimed the OnePlus 5 to be the fastest-selling OnePlus device to date shortly after its release in June 2017. Pei left the OnePlus company on October 13, 2020 for new hardware ventures. Publicity In July 2015, during an interview by The Wall Street Journal about how OnePlus was created, Pei stated, \\"One of the reasons why we started this company was we looked at all the Android phones on the market and there wasn't one phone that was good enough for us ourselves to use.\\" In 2014 and 2015, Pei told The New York Times and Forbes about the growth and globalization of OnePlus, \\"OnePlus wasn‚Äôt meant to become a global company at the beginning. The main focus was taking on the Chinese market. When we started the company, we built a management team with a lot of experience in the Chinese market. But for the global markets team, we are a bunch of young people without a lot of experience. It was just like an experiment, 'Hey, do the global markets and see what happens. Do whatever you want.' We call our group 'a Shenzhen within our company', or a start-up within a bigger company.\\" and \\"Very soon our sales outside of China will surpass sales in China.\\" Awards In April 2016, Pei was included in the 2016 edition of the Marketing Week Vision 100 list for his marketing achievements.

As a two-year-old in 2013 he was beaten in his first two starts but then ran up three consecutive victories including the Railway Stakes and the Phoenix Stakes. He also finished second in the National Stakes later that year. He made little impact in two starts as a three-year-old. Background Sudirman is a bay horse with no white markings bred in Kentucky by Kathryn Nikkel & Jeanne Canty. In 2012 he was sent to Englnad and put up for the auction at the Tattersalls October Yearling Sale where he was bought for 200,000 guineas by the bloodstock agent John Warren on behalf of the Coolmore Stud. During his racing career he was trained by David Wachman at Goolds Cross, County Tipperary. Like many horses associated with Coolmore the details of his ownership changed from race to race: he sometimes raced in the colours of Mrs Fitri Hay while on other occasions he was described as being owned by a partnership of Hay and Susan Magnier. He was ridden in all but one of his races by Wayne Lordan. He was sired by Henrythenavigator who won the 2000 Guineas, Irish 2000 Guineas, St James's Palace Stakes and Sussex Stakes in 2008. As a breeding stallion he was not a conspicuous success and was eventually exported to Russia, but he did sire several other good winners including George Vancouver (Breeders' Cup Juvenile Turf) and Pedro the Great. Sudirman's damShermeen was a useful racemare who won three minor races in Europe before being relocated to the United States where she won the Luther Burbank Handicap. She was descended from Fair Astronomer who finished second in the 1000 Guineas and was the female-line ancestor of Malhub, Deputy Commander, Donna Blini and Gentildonna. Racing career 2013: two-year- old season Sudirman made his debut in a minor race over six furlongs at Naas Racecourse on 15 May in which he started at odds of 10/1 and finished last of the five runners behind Big Time. Eleven days later, in a maiden race at the Curragh he produced a much better effort as he came home in third place, beaten a length by the Aidan O'Brien-trained winner Sir John Hawkins. On 20 June at Leopardstown the colt started odds-on favourite for a maiden and recorded his first success as he took the lead a furlong out and pulled away to win \\"comfortably\\" by four and a half lengths from nine opponents. Nine days after his win at Leopardstown the colt was stepped up in class and started 5/1 third favourite in a five-runner field for the Group 2 Railway Stakes at the Curragh. The Aidan O'Brien-trained Coach House headed the betting on 8/15 after wimnning the Marble Hill Stakes and finishing second in the Norfolk Stakes, with Big Time the 9/2 second choice. Sudirman raced in third before moving up to challenge Big Time for the lead approaching the final furlong. He gained the advantage in the closing stages and won by half a length, with a gap of over four lengths back to Coach House in third. On 11 August at Leopardstown Sudirman was moved up to Group 1 class for the Phoenix Stakes and tarted second favourite behind the Coventry Stakes winner War Command. The other three runners were Big Time, Ambiance [sic] (winner of the Dragon Stakes) and the outsider Sniper. Ambiance set the pace with Lordan settling his mount in third before making a forward move in the last quarter mile. Sudirman took the lead a furlong out and stayed on well under strong pressure to win by half a length from Big Time. After the race Wachman said: \\"He's a good tough horse, he won't do too much when he gets there, he idles in front. He did it well, he's tough and keeps finding. There was a good bit left in the tank. I'm delighted for Wayne, we have been waiting on one of these for a while and have been knocking on the door. We'll probably step up to seven furlongs, he's been crying out for that trip.\\" Sudirman attempted to record a second Group 1 success when he was stepped up in distance for the National Stakes over seven furlongs at the Curragh on 15 September. He proved the best of the four Irish runners but was no match for the British-trained favourite Toormore and was beaten two and three quarter lengths into second place. In October he was sent to England and started second favourite for the Middle Park Stakes over six furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse. He tracked the leaders but failed to quicken in the closing stages and finished fifth of the ten runners behind Astaire. 2014: three-year-old season Sudirman did not race in the early part of 2014 and only made his reappearance on 2 June in the Listed Lacken Stakes over six furlongs at Naas. Euipped with blinkers for the first time he raced in second place for most of the way before fading into fourth place behind the favourite Due Diligence. Billy Lee took the ride when the colt was sent to Royal Ascot and started a 20/1 outsider for the Jersey Stakes on 18 June. Carrying a five pound weight penalty for his Group 1 success he chased the leaders before dropping away quickly and being eased down by Lee in the closing stages to finish 20th of the 23 runners.

She started her career at a very young age singing in her family's son septet, which she left to settle in Havana in 1935. There she performed with several female orchestras such as Anacaona and Orquesta Ilusi√≥n, before joining Alfaro P√©rez's Orquesta Siglo XX in 1938. With the Siglo XX Verges became a popular danz√≥n singer, making several recordings in the 1940s. She also sang with Justa Garc√≠a's quartet, Orquesta Almendra and the Charanga T√≠pica Cubana, among other groups, before retiring in 1982. Life and career Dominica Verges Gonz√°lez was born on September 19, 1918, in the village of Tapaste, in the municipality of San Jos√© de las Lajas, near Havana. Her grandfather was a violinist from the Philippines, and many of her relatives were also musicians, which led to her being interested in music from a very young age. She gained experience as a singer by joining her uncles' and grandfathers' son group, founded in 1929 as the Sexteto Cubano. She then started to travel daily to Havana to play with the orchestras at the Paseo del Prado, before relocating to the city in 1935. In Havana, Verges became a member of various female groups such as Concepci√≥n Castro's Anacaona, Alicia Seoane's Orquesta Ilusi√≥n, and Orquesta Imperio, among others. The year 1938 saw the formation of the charanga Orquesta Siglo XX, directed by bassist Alfaro P√©rez, who chose Verges as the singer for the group. With the Siglo XX Verges recorded several songs in 1940 and 1941, and became famous as vocalist, being nicknamed \\"La Danzonera\\" due to the popularity of her sung danzones. After Paulina √Ålvarez, \\"The Empress of the Danzonete\\", Verges became the second most popular singer in the genre. In 1941, she recorded two tracks in New York credited to Orquesta Dominica Verges: Osvaldo Farr√©s's bolero \\"Ac√©rcate m√°s\\" and Rafael Hern√°ndez's danz√≥n \\"Rebeca\\". While a member of the Siglo XX, Verges also performed with Justa Garc√≠a's trova quartet as lead singer, as well as Orquesta Modelo, making one recording in 1941.

He held the office of suffect consul in 67 with Lucius Verulanus Severus as his colleague.Giuseppe Camodeca, Bolletino del Centro internazionale per lo studio dei papyri ercolanesi, 23 (1993), 109-119 The suffect consul of 67 is commonly identified as the general who supported Otho during the Year of the Four Emperors. Except for his tenure as suffect consul, Gallus' life prior to the year 69 is a blank. In that year, the ephemeral emperor Otho selected him to be one of his generals. Gallus, along with Gaius Suetonius Paulinus and Aulus Marius Celsus, led the assembled troops north from Rome to confront the legions supporting Vitellius near the Po river.Tacitus, Histories, I.87 Tacitus notes that Gallus took command of the lead elements along with Titus Vestricius Spurinna.Tacitus, Histories, II.11 Once they reached the Po, Otho sent Spurinna on to occupy Placentia while he marched to Verona. Upon hearing that Spurinna's men were encircled by soldiers loyal to Vitellius, Gallus moved to assist his associate, but stopped at Bedriacum when word reached him that the enemy was driven off after an unsuccessful assault.Gwyn Morgan, 69 A.D.: The Year of Four Emperors (Oxford: University Press, 2006), pp. 113ff Gallus was not present at the Battle of Bedriacum that followed, because he had been injured by a fall from his horse.Tacitus, Histories, II.33 Along with Suetonius Paulinus and Marius Celsus, he opposed engaging Vitellius' men immediately, concurring with their advice that Otho would do better to wait until the legions from the Balkans arrived. Nevertheless, Emperor Otho ignored their advice and his men were defeated at Bedriacum. When Vedius Aquila, the commander of one of legions supporting Otho, returned to camp and found himself the potential victim of a murderous group of defeated soldiers, Annius Gallus intervened and saved his life.Tacitus, Histories, II.44 Despite having supported one of the unsuccessful rivals for the imperial insignia, Gallus managed to avoid becoming a victim of the ensuing proscriptions. He is next found as a general under Vespasian, assigned to assist in suppressing the Sequani, who had risen in revolt along with the Batavians.Tacitus, Histories, IV.68; V.19 Werner Eck sees this as evidence that Gallus had been appointed governor of Germania Superior near the end of the year 69, and continued in this position until 72 when he was replaced by Gnaeus Pinarius Cornelius Clemens.Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten der senatorischen Statthalter von 69/70 bis 138/139\\", Chiron, 12 (1982), pp. 284-291 His actions after returning to Rome from Germania Superior are not known.

History Turn Joe, ‚Äúa bold enterprising Fellow,‚Äù commanded a trio of ships under commission from a Spanish Governor in the Caribbean. Off Long Island in the Bahamas in late 1718 his ships were attacked by three pirates led by John Auger and Phineas Bunce, who mistook the Spanish vessels for salt-trading sloops. The pirate vessel commanded by Bunce approached and demanded the Spanish ships surrender but was met with a hail of small arms fire, killing or wounding many of the pirates. The survivors leapt overboard and swam ashore. The second pirate ship mistook the gunfire as Bunce‚Äôs and approached the anchored ships, only to be met with gunfire. Again many of them were wounded and the remainder swam ashore. The third pirate ship repeated the mistakes of the first two and was captured immediately afterward. Turn Joe‚Äôs Spanish ships suffered no casualties. After questioning his prisoners, Turn Joe put the wounded men and those he‚Äôd determined to have been forced into piracy aboard a spare boat and released them to sail back to New Providence. Bunce died of his wounds soon after arriving. Woodes Rogers had been tasked with pacifying the pirates plaguing the Bahamas. When word reached New Providence that a number of pirates were nearby and likely vulnerable, Rogers sent pardoned pirate Benjamin Hornigold to retrieve them.

Grand Dames The three Grand Dames of St. Louis were Mrs. Scanlan, Mrs. Peter L. Foy, and Mme. Armand Peugnet. They were invited to act as official hostesses for many noted personages who were entertained by the city. They used a white stone mansion on Grand and Lucas Avenues, where Mrs. Scanlan presided for many years with the dignity of a queen. The mansion is no longer extant. Founding of St. Louis Virginia Sarpy Peugnet was descendant of Pierre Lacl√®de and Marie-Th√©r√®se Bourgeois Chouteau. Pierre Lacl√®de was born in 1724 and came from Bedous, France, when thirty-one years old, reaching Louisiana in 1755. Marie-Th√©r√®se Bourgeois Chouteau, a daughter of a French officer, and a lady- in-waiting from the court of Cadiz, Spain. Shortly after the Bourgeois, Nicolas Bourgeois and Marie Joseph Tarare, arrived in New Orleans, where Nicolas Bourgeois' brother had established himself in business, Marie-Th√©r√®se Bourgeois was born, and a few months later the father died. When Marie-Th√©r√®se Bourgeois was six years old, her mother, a woman who stood high in the Catholic Church, died, and the child was placed in the Ursuline Convent in New Orleans, where she was reared. When very young she was married to Ren√© Auguste Chouteau, a New Orleans business man, who was born in Bearne, France, in 1739. To them was born a son, Auguste Chouteau, September 17, 1750. Her second marriage was with Pierre Lacl√®de, to whom she was evidently deeply attached. She was a woman of remarkably strong character and much fortitude, as she underwent great hardships in pioneering with him. Marie-Th√©r√®se Bourgeois Chouteau died in St. Louis, on August 14, 1814, at the age of eighty-one years, leaving many, many descendants who have fulfilled the prophecy of Lacl√®de in building one of the finest cities in North America. Pierre Lacl√®de was a member of the firm of Maxent, Laclede & Co., of New Orleans. He was sent up the Mississippi River to establish a permanent trading post by his firm. Lacl√®de, with Chouteau and their four children - and her oldest son, Auguste ‚Äî left New Orleans in crude boats, on August 3, 1763, and three months later reached Ste. Genevieve, Missouri, where there was no building large enough to store the goods brought by them. In 1763 the country east of the Mississippi had been ceded to the English. The commandant at Fort Chartres, about twenty miles above Ste. Genevieve, offered storage room until the English should arrive to take possession. This fort had been built by the French in 1720 for defense against the Spaniards. It was the best-built fort in North America. The offer was accepted by Lacl√®de, and they reached there on November 3, 1763. The winter was passed at Fort de Chartres by Chouteau and her children, but Lacl√®de and Auguste Chouteau went as far north as St. Charles, Missouri to find a location on the west bank of the Mississippi where they could establish a settlement. The spot was selected and trees marked, and they returned to Fort de Chartres to await the breaking up of the ice on the river. In the words of Lacl√®de to Chouteau , \\"You will proceed to the site on the left bank of the river, where we blazed the trees, and erect a house to store the tools and shelter the men. I give you two men on whom you can depend to aid you, and I will join you before long.\\" Chouteau wrote the account of this expedition, his original manuscript in French now being in the Mercantile Library of St. Louis. It was translated and published by the library in 1858. It is, however, very short‚Äîonly a few pages. Chouteau went in the boat with thirty men, arriving on February 14, 1764, and Lacl√®de, on horseback, accompanied Marie- Th√©r√®se Bourgeois Chouteau, who rode in a cart with her children, and with Antoine Riviere, Sr., as driver, to Cahokia, Illinois, where she waited until a house was built for her on the site of St. Louis. History tells of the growth of the city. Pierre Lacl√®de died in June, 1778, while en route from New Orleans to St. Louis, where it was his custom to spend the winters in the interest of Lacl√®de, Maxent & Co. His body was buried about two hundred yards back from the banks of the Mississippi at the mouth of the Arkansas, near a town called Napoleon, Arkansas, in a beautiful spot which was afterwards a cemetery until washed away by the river. The castle where the family of Lacl√®de lived in France has been visited by some of his descendants. The name was originally \\"de Lacl√®de\\", but the prefix was dropped. George Julian Zolnay, who made a statue of Lacl√®de, visited Bedous, the birthplace of Lacl√®de, studying the features of members of the family living there, one of whom, Dr. Madamet, was Mayor of Bedous. His mother was a Lacl√®de, and in him Zolnay found a great resemblance to the portrait of Pierre Lacl√®de. The statue was a gift to the City of St. Louis from the Centennial Association. Auguste Chouteau was thirty-eight years old at the time of Lacl√®de's death. He married Marie Therese Cerre, of Kaskaskia, Illinois, in 1769. She died in St. Louis in 1842. He died in 1825. They had seven children: Auguste A., Henri, Edward, Gabriel Sylvestre, Eulalie, Louise and Emilie. Family Virginia Sarpy Berthold Peugnet by Matthew DeRoche By the union of Marie-Th√©r√®se Bourgeois Chouteau with Pierre Lacl√®de four children were born. Pierre Chouteau was born in New Orleans in 1758, and died July 9, 1849. There were three daughters, Marie Louise, who married Marie Joseph Papin; Victoire, who married Charles Gratiot, and Pelagic, Mrs. Sylvestre Labaddie. Pierre Chouteau was married first to Pelagie Kiersereau, and secondly to Brigite Saucier. Victoire married Charles Gratiot, a Canadian, and their daughter, Julia Gratiot, born 1782, died 1852, married John Pierre Cabanne, and their daughter, Jeanne Victorare Adele Cabanne (1803-1832), married John Baptiste Sarpy (1798-1857), whose daughter was Virginia Sarpy. Virginia Sarpy was born on July 4, 1827. Adele, the first wife of John Sarpy died when their only child, Virginia, was four years old. Later he married a second time, to Martha Jane Russell (1817-1844), of the Irish family of O'Bannon, by whom he had two children, one the wife of James L. D. Morrison, who figured in the political and land-dealing history of Illinois. After the death of Sarpy's second wife, Virginia brought up the family of stepsister and stepbrother, assisted by her Grandmother Cabanne, who was her own mother's mother, but the children were never taken out of their own home which was then where later the Carleton Building stood, on Sixth and Olive Streets. Virginia's first schooling was with Mme. Vitalis, who undertook the education of a limited number of girls, followed by a year in the Sacred Heart Convent; and, later, a short course at a female academy at Steubenville, Ohio, from which she was called on account of the last illness of her stepmother. Just before her death Virginia's father was induced to take the family to Ste. Genevieve, where his wife could have the benefit of treatment by Father Celeni, a venerable priest, who was noted for his skill in making cures with herbs and nature's remedies. However, after remaining there for some time it was found to be futile; she died of consumption very soon after. The journey to the oldest settlement in the State was a delightful childish remembrance to Virginia Sarpy Peugnet. At that time relatives of the family were living in Ste. Genevieve, engaged in the milling business under the name of Chouteau, Harrison & Valle. The old Chouteau mansion was still standing two miles above the town on the river bank, where the mill also stood, but which was later destroyed by fire. Virginia Sarpy Peugnet's father was a member of the American Fur Trading Co., the other members being relatives of Virginia Sarpy Peugnet's father's first wife ‚Äî Mr. Sire and Mr. Chouteau. Their dealings were with the Native Americans, trading goods for furs. Virginia Sarpy married first Frederick A. Berthold (1821-1868), son of Bertholomew Berthold, and Pelagie Chouteau, who was the daughter of Pierre Chouteau and his second wife, Brigite Saucier. Her second marriage was to Armand Bernard Peugnet (1833-1894), a member of the French diplomatic corps. She had one son, Maurice Bernard Peugnet (1871-1914), a widower with seven children, and two daughters, Claire Pelagie Berthold (1866-1950) and Eugenie Berthold (1868-1962), who never married. Other two children are: Amedee Bartholomew Berthold (1849-1864) and Louisa Berthold Weinmann (1850-1910). After her second marriage, Virginia Sarpy Peugnet traveled abroad considerably during her husband's office of Consul in Germany, Spain and France. Virginia Sarpy Peugnet died on August 11, 1917. She is buried at Calvary Cemetery (St. Louis).

In the late 80-s of the 19th century Oleksiy Butovsky became one of the most popular experts in the field of physical education, his name was well known abroad. After one of the trips abroad, he noted with regret that in many countries the problem of physical education understood and supported in the power echelons, and in Russia, these issues have been neglected. Oleksiy Butovsky and Pierre de Coubertin periodically met and regular corresponded in French, which Oleksiy knew very well. They met in 1892 in France, where on orders of military departments of Russia, Butovskiy studied the training of gymnasts and fencers. Convened de Coubertin Congress defined the timing and venue of the first two modern Olympics - Athens and Paris, 1896 and 1900 - and chose the first members of the IOC. Naturally, from Russia to it came General Butovsky. In 1896 Oleksiy Butovsky attended as a member of the IOC at the Olympic Games in Athens.

Brown is an American composer whose works have been performed across the United States and Europe, including Carnegie Hall in New York City, Cadogan Hall in London, and the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam. His commissions for vocal ensemble New York Polyphony have been heard on American Public Media's Performance Today, BBC Radio, Minnesota Public Radio, Kansas Public Radio, and Danish National Radio. Brown is best known for his \\"Missa Charles Darwin\\", a work combining the structure of the standard mass with texts from Charles Darwin, which is featured in his brother Dan Brown's novel Origin.  Early life  Gregory Brown grew up in Exeter, New Hampshire. He is the son of a mathematician father and church organist mother. He attended Phillips Exeter Academy, and as an Amherst College undergraduate, he initially majored in geology, then switched to pursue music instead, becoming a composer and conductor. He holds degrees from the Hugh Hodgson School of Music (University of Georgia), Westminster Choir College, and Amherst College, where he studied with the Pulitzer Prize-winning composer Lewis Spratlan. His older brother is the noted author Dan Brown.  Missa Charles Darwin  \\"Missa Charles Darwin\\" is a multi-movement composition by Gregory W. Brown that is scored for unaccompanied male vocal quartet, using texts from Darwin compiled and edited by New York Polyphony bass Craig Phillips. Based on the standard five-movement structure of the Mass, the \\"Missa Charles Darwin\\" honors the compositional and harmonic conventions of its musical antecedents. Unlike traditional Mass settings, however, the sacred texts have been replaced with excerpts from On the Origin of Species, The Descent of Man, and Darwin's extant correspondence. Brown's brother also credits this piece as the inspiration for his best selling novel Origin.

This 100 centimeter long, 108 kilogram bronze cannon was discovered in a cellar in Wuwei, Gansu Province. It bears no inscription, but has been dated by historians to the late Western Xia period between 1214 and 1227 through contextual evidence. The gun contained an iron ball about nine centimeters in diameter, which is smaller than the muzzle diameter at twelve centimeters, and 0.1 kilograms of gunpowder in it when discovered, meaning that the projectile might have been another co-viative. Ben Sinvany and Dang Shoushan believe that the ball used to be much larger prior to its highly corroded state at the time of discovery. While large in size, the weapon is noticeably more primitive than later Yuan dynasty guns such as the Xanadu Gun and Heilongjiang hand cannon, and is unevenly cast. A similar weapon was discovered not far from the discovery site in 1997, but is much smaller in size at only 1.5 kg. Chen Bingying disputes the impact of these discoveries, and argues there were no guns before 1259, while Dang Shoushan believes the Western Xia guns point to the appearance of guns by 1220, and Stephen Haw goes even further by stating that guns were developed as early as 1200. Sinologist Joseph Needham and renaissance siege expert Thomas Arnold provide a more conservative estimate of around 1280 for the appearance of the \\"true\\" cannon. Whether or not any of these are correct, it seems likely that the gun was born sometime during the 13th century.

The International Harp Archives (IHA) is a collection of archives from the World Harp Congress, American Harp Society, and individual harpists. It is located at the Harold B. Lee Library in Brigham Young University (BYU). The archives began as a collection established by Samuel and Rosalie Pratt, and it may be the largest collection of harp materials in the world.  History  Harpists Samuel and Rosalie Pratt had their own personal collection of harp- related materials. Samuel designed the original Troubadour harp and owned a harp repair business. His wife Rosalie was a professor of music at BYU. They donated their collection of harp-related materials to BYU in 1985. After the Pratt's initial donation, additional major donations arrived at the university, including one from the Victor Salvi Foundation. The International Harp Archives was formally established in 1994 due to the collection's growth.  Holdings  The archives consist of over 11,000 scores and recordings that use the harp. Items such as \\"manuscripts and recordings, photographs, correspondence, programs and other documents\\" are included in the collection. Additionally, the IHA serves as a central hub for any information regarding the harp, its music, and harpists. Nearly 60 major contributors donated materials to the collection. All archived items are housed in the Harold B. Lee Library on BYU's campus. The archives and its materials are organized by the general collection and the non-circulating special collections. The IHA partners with the Archives of the American Harp Society to offer a lending library through BYU's library. Only American Harp Society members are permitted to request archived materials offsite. Other library patrons can view materials in person. In 1987, the American Harp Society began an interview series with notable harpists, including Lucile Lawrence and Alice Chalifoux. These interviews can be accessed via the AHS lending library. The IHA aims to preserve the harp's history and make the collected materials available to through their Internet Archive. A project to scan and make all pre-1923 published scores available online is ongoing. Over 2,400 public domain records have been scanned for public access through the online archive.

The oldest extant gun bearing a date of production is the Xanadu Gun, so called because it was discovered in the ruins of Xanadu (Shangdu), the summer palace of the Yuan dynasty in Inner Mongolia, China. The Xanadu Gun is 34.7 cm in length and weighs 6.21 kg, its muzzle is flared outwards, slightly bowl- shape, and called by Chinese as Á¢óÂè£Èì≥ (W«én k«íu ch√≤ng). Its dating is based on archaeological context and a straightforward inscription containing an era name and year that correspond with the Gregorian Calendar at 1298. Not only does the inscription contain the era name and date, it also includes a serial number and manufacturing information which suggests that gun production had already become systematized, or at least become a somewhat standardized affair by the time of its fabrication. The design of the gun includes axial holes in its rear which some speculate could have been used in a mounting mechanism. Like most early guns with the possible exception of the Western Xia gun (the Wuwei bronze cannon), it is small, weighing just over six kilograms and thirty-five centimeters in length. Although the Xanadu Gun is the most precisely dated gun from the 13th century, other extant samples with approximate dating may be older.

The system is in wide use globally, partly owing to IKEA using some of its elements (principally the 32 mm shelf support holes) in its furniture. Characteristics are the columns of 5 mm holes on 32 mm centers. In addition to the 32 mm standard, there are other but less frequently used systems (System 25, ip20 etc.).Wolfgang Nutsch: Handbuch der Konstruktion: M√∂bel und Einbauschr√§nke. DVA, Stuttgart M√ºnchen, 2. Auflage 2003, , Seite 50 The system was developed by fitting, machine and furniture manufacturers, and serves to standardize both component dimensions and production processes. The design features are: * Distance of the holes in the row of holes = 32 mm * Diameter of the holes = 5 mm and 8 mm * Distance of the front row of holes to the front edge = 37 mm The system includes matching fittings, with which furniture sides can be secured to floors, walls, and adjacent cabinets. Other fittings are available for doorbands, drawer guides, clothes racks, floor racks, and other features, and typically mount into one or more of the 5 mm holes otherwise used to support shelf brackets. Advantages of this system include: * Distance from the first hole to the bottom side of the cabinet = Distance from the last hole to the top of the cabinet top: Simplification of setting up single row drilling machines * Distance of the rear row of holes to the rear edge = 37 mm, which does not require retooling of the drilling machine * Distance of the rear row of holes to the inner edge Back wall = 37 mm, which facilitates the assembly of rear wall supports * Distance between the two rows of holes = multiple of 32 mm, which facilitates the assembly of drawer guide  History  It is claimed that the system was developed after the end of World War II in order to help speed reconstruction of the vast number of buildings destroyed during the war, that the spacing was decided upon because that was the closest that multiple drill bits on a line boring machine could be placed, because of the size of the gears then available.

Early life and career He was born Pryse Loveden, and was the son of Edward Loveden Loveden of Buscot Park, who was also a Member of Parliament, and Margaret Pryse, daughter of Lewis Pryse of Woodstock and Gogerddan. Through his mother, he inherited an estate of 30,000 acres in upland Cardiganshire. Possession of Gogerddan, which dominated the borough of Aberystwyth, gave him a strong claim to a parliamentary seat. Upon inheriting the estate he adopted the name Pryse Loveden Pryse, and was usually referred to in later life as Pryse Pryse. Pryse served as High Sheriff of Cardiganshire in 1799. Parliamentary career 1818-32 The Gogerddan interest had for generations played a prominent part in the politics of Cardiganshire, and the borough of Aberystwyth was regarded as being controlled by Gogerddan, in contrast to the county town of Cardigan which fell under the influence of the Lisburne family. As early as 1796 there was speculation that Pryse would seek election to the Commons but his father wrote in 1801 that he did not appear interested. By 1812, he became involved in the contest for Cardigan Boroughs, and proposed Herbert Evans as candidate against the sitting member, John Vaughan of Crosswood. Roland Thorne suggests that had Pryse, as heir to the Gogerddan interest, wished to stand himself, Evans would have withdrawn in his favour. Evans was defeated by a narrow margin and Pryse was now regarded as a future candidate himself. Soon after, his first wife died in tragic circumstances (see below) and Pryse withdrew temporarily from public life. By 1816, however, he was a prospective candidate for the Cardiganshire county seat following the death of Thomas Johnes of Hafod. A county meeting was held at Cardigan and a vote taken between the two candidates, Pryse and William Edward Powell of Nanteos. The vote went in Powell's favour. In order to 'preserve the peace of the county', Pryse then withdrew on the understanding that Powell would support his candidature when a vacancy arose in Cardigan Boroughs. This was regarded as a political as well as a personal compromise, since Powell was a Tory and Pryse a Whig. In 1818, Pryse was returned unopposed for the boroughs seat. His father, Edward Loveden, died on 6 January 1822, and Pryse inherited a life interest in his Berkshire estates. These, however, continued to cause financial difficulties. During his thirty-year parliamentary career, Pryse was regarded as a supporter of moderate reform who advocated Liberal principles. Pryse was a supporter of parliamentary reform. On 22 March 1831, supported the First Reform Bill and voted against Isaac Gascoyne's wrecking amendment. This brought down the government and resulted in a General Election in which Pryse was returned unopposed. Later parliamentary career 1832-49 In 1835 it was rumoured that efforts were being made to replace Pryse as member for the boroughs with John Jones of Ystrad, former member for Carmarthen Boroughs. The 1841 election In 1841, Pryse faced a challenge for his seat, although the initial suggestion of Lieut-Col. Copland of London was not considered a serious threat. The emergence of John Harford, who owned considerable property in Lampeter was a different matter. Harford had inherited the Peterwell estate in 1821, and although he never actually resided in Cardiganshire, he invested heavily in the improvement of the estate and the provision of water supply for the town of Lampeter. He also donated the land where St David's College, Lampeter, was established. The campaign in Aberystwyth was reported to be strongly in favour of Pryse, where the \\"overwhelming feeling [was] the injustice of turning out a long tried representative to make room for a thorough stranger\\". In Cardigan too, Pryse was greeted by crowds of supporters and his colours were flown from the masts of ships in the harbour. Harford, however, was a formidable opponent and proceeded to poll heavily in the southern boroughs. However, the election terminated in an \\"extraordinary and anamalous manner\\" after the poll books from Aberystwyth went missing. Harford had a majority of 69 in Cardigan and 16 at Lampeter. In turn, Pryse had a majority of 20 at the small borough of Adpar and was also reported to be 83 votes ahead at Aberystwyth. Overall, this gave him a majority of 20 votes. However, the poll books for Aberystwyth were found to be missing. It was the responsibility of the Mayor of Aberystwyth to deliver the poll books to the count at Cardigan and controversy arose from the fact that the Mayor, R.O. Powell, was not only a supporter of Harford but also the brother of Colonel Powell, the Conservative member for Cardiganshire who had recently been returned unopposed. In the absence of the poll books, the election could nor be called and neither candidate took a seat in the Commons. There were accusations of coercion and Pryse subsequently voted in favour of the ballot in the Commons. Despite this close contest in 1841, Pryse held the seat until his death. Family Shortly after inheriting the Gogerddan estates, he married Harriet Flower on 20 July 1798. She was the daughter of William Flower, 2nd Baron Ashbrook (1744‚Äì80) and the widow of John Ellis Agar. His wife died on 14 January 1813 following a fire at Gogerddan. Subsequently, Pryse married Jane Cavallier, daughter of Peter Cavallier of Guisborough, Yorkshire on 29 April 1815. They had three sons, the eldest of whom, Pryse Pryse, succeeded his father as MP for Cardigan Boroughs.

Career Born into the native nobility, he was of Hungarian origin. As he did not adopt a Christian name, he was not a member of the Benedictine Order, in contrast to most contemporary prelates. It is possible that, as his successors, he was one of the court clergymen during the reign of Ladislaus I of Hungary. A document from 1134, which contains a verdict of Archbishop Felician, narrates the circumstances of the foundation of the Diocese of Zagreb, where Acha was mentioned as Archbishop of Esztergom, thus he held the dignity around then, when Ladislaus set up the episcopate. According to historian L√°szl√≥ Koszta, it is presumable that Acha already served as archbishop during the canonization of Stephen I in 1083. 17th-century Jesuit scholar Melchior Inchofer argued Ladislaus sent his envoy, Archbishop Acha to Pope Urban II in 1088 in order to prepare his invasion of Croatia and ask the pope's consent. Based on historian B√°lint H√≥man's research, the Diocese of Zagreb (in Slavonia, which was \\"no- man's land\\" between Hungary and Croatia) was founded in the late 1080s, just before Ladislaus' invasion. If the establishment took place after the war, Acha functioned as Archbishop of Esztergom after 1091 (at the latest in 1093 and 1094). According to a scholarly theory, the sees of the dioceses of Kalocsa and Bihar were moved to B√°cs (now Baƒç, Serbia) and Nagyv√°rad (present- day Oradea, Romania), respectively, during Acha's primacy. It is possible that the erection of the second Gyulafeh√©rv√°r Cathedral also occurred then, in addition to the foundations of the Kolozsmonostor and B√°ta abbeys. As he was not present at the establishment of the Somogyv√°r Abbey in 1091, presumably he was dead by then.

More generally, the term may be used to denote mutual opposition between sexual ideologies. Metaphorical symbolism of sexual polarity is deeply intertwined in cultural understandings of nature. Conceptions of male and female poles are developed through history in relation to each other. Measurement Researchers at the University of Connecticut devised a scale of sexual polarity between right-wing and left-wing sexual ideologies. In a study of 140 undergraduates, correlations along this scale were shown between right-wing sexual ideologies and both church attendance and sex-guilt. Bacterial conjugation Sexual differentiation may be seen between pairs of bacteria cells engaged in bacterial conjugation. The genetic-element donor may be characterized as having a 'male' sexual polarity and the recipient a 'female' sexual polarity.  Feminist literature  Historical blurring of boundaries between male and female poles has necessitated debates regarding maintenance of social order, particularly during periods of rapid change. Shulamith Firestone's The Dialectic of Sex presents a vision of radical feminism calling for division of culture into two modes, Technological and Aesthetic, married by a 'union of opposites'. Chris Middleton argues that this dual organization is intended to reflect and replace the existing sexual polarity of culture. In Alternative Shakespeare, Cotherine Belsey uses sexual polarity as lens for both interpretation of William Shakespeare's comedies and in critique of second-wave feminism.  Self-help  Sexual polarity is sometimes presented in New Age spirituality and self-help materials. In The Way of the Superior Man, David Deida discusses challenges related to the ethical expression of masculine polarity.

Biography Sir William Neville was a knight of the chamber to King Richard II of England and was named constable of Nottingham castle. He was son of Ralph Neville, 2nd Baron Neville. Robin Hood legend Nottingham historian Tony Scupham-Bilton has suggested that there is a gay undertone to the Robin Hood legend. The link with Robin Hood dates back 700 years and it is due to the relationship between Sir William Neville and Sir John Clanvowe. The two shared a special bond, despite the fact Sir William had a wife, firstly Elizabeth Le Waleys and secondly Alice de St. Philbert. Clanvowe, a poet, wrote a ballad in honor of a visit of King Richard II to Nottingham castle, \\"The Jest of Robin Hood\\". According to Scupham- Bilton, the background of the ballad was Clanvowe's own relationship with Neville. The two of them had a ceremony of \\"wedded brotherhood\\". Neville and Clanvowe died on pilgrimage near Constantinople, Neville two days later than Clanvowe. In an entry for 1391 in the chronicle compiled in the XIV century by the monks of Westminster Abbey, it is written that William Neville died of grief for the death of John Clanvowe: \\"It was also on October 17, that in a village near Constantinopole in Greece the life of Sir John Clanvowe, a distinguished knight, came to its close, causing to his companion on the march, Sir William Neville, for whom his love was no less than for himself, such inconsolable sorrow that he never took food again and two days afterward breathed his last, greatly mourned, in the same village.

In their second competitive outing of the 2018 international season in an Australian selection eight and racing as the Georgina Hope Rinehart National Training Centre, after Rowing Australia patron, Gina Rinehart, Werry won the 2018 Remenham Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta. Without Werry the four won gold at two WRCs in Europe but by the time of 2018 World Rowing Championships Popa was out of the four with an injury and Werry back in the two seat. Seated as they had been in 2017, the Australian four won their heat, were surprised by a new combination USA crew in the semi and then in the final placed second to the USA and finished with world championship silver. In 2019 Werry was again picked in Australian women's sweep squad for the international season. For the two Rowing World Cups in Europe Werry was seated at two in the Australian coxless four and rowed to a bronze medal at RWC II in Poznan and to a gold medal at WRC III in Rotterdam. Werry, Aldersey, Hawe and Stephan were selected to race Australia's coxless four at the 2019 World Rowing Championships in Linz, Austria.2019 WRC entry list The four were looking for a top eight finish at the 2019 World Championships to qualify for the Tokyo Olympics.2019 World C'ship selections They won their heat and semi-final, thereby qualifying the boat for Tokyo 2020.

Description The lagoon formed about 2,000 years ago. It was once a large cavern that collapsed following an earthquake. The outline of the collapsed cavern roof can be clearly discerned from a distance. The lake has quite unique environmental conditions: it is supplied with warm seawater (28-35¬∫Celsius) via an underground channel spreading through a network of flooded caves, so its temperature never drops below 18 ¬∞C (usually ranges around 21-24 ¬∞C), whereas a freshwater spring reduces its salinity to brackish levels (14.5-18 psu). It continues deep inside the mountain in an underwater cave never fully explored, as its end seems impossible to trace even by employing sonar detection. Many underwater expeditions have been carried out in order to chart it, and a few amateur divers have drowned trying. Because of its constant warm water temperature and its rich content in hydrogen sulphide, the lake functions as a spa since the end of the 19th century. Ecology The lake hosts the only existing population of a species of sea anemone, Paranemonia vouliagmeniensis. It has been declared a natural monument by the Greek State and is part of a Natura 2000.

It is unusual for the fact that the main fort contains a smaller, more heavily defended fort, complete with its own distinct defences and entrance, with no obvious means of access between the two. The construction date of the original fort is still unknown, but recent excavations have revealed evidence of occupation as early as the 6th century BC, whilst the smaller fort can be dated with reasonable certainty to around the 4th century BC. Whilst the forts were constructed in different periods, archaeologists have uncovered evidence of concurrent occupation, seemingly up until around the 2nd century BC. The larger fort contained around 50 roundhouses during its lifetime, whereas examinations of the smaller fort have turned up no more than six. The site was traditionally associated with Maelgwyn Gwynedd (c. 480 ‚Äì c. 547 AD), but there is no evidence pointing to a 6th-century occupation. The fort and wider area beyond its boundaries have been said to retain significant archaeological potential, and are protected by law as a scheduled ancient monument.  Description  Annotated plan of Caer Seion.The fort is on the summit of a ridge of rhyolite at an altitude of approximately and is enclosed by a single rampart, with more complex works protecting a smaller fortified area at the western end. The northern side of the ridge is steep enough to offer a natural defence meaning that no outer wall was needed for the first phase of construction. The smaller fort was built inside the western margins of the larger fort sometime around the 4th century BC; it was completely enclosed, and defended by thick stone walls on all sides, with defensive ditches running along the eastern and north-eastern boundary and a defensive outwork to the southeast. The site has a commanding position overlooking Conwy Bay, and is situated close to a major trackway that follows the coastal ridge. The total area of the fort is , it is roughly long, and at its widest measures around from the southern ramparts to the cliffs on the northern boundary. Confusion surrounding name Writing in Archaeologia Cambrensis, W.E. Griffiths and A. H. A. Hogg identify 'Caer Seion' as the older and more genuine name of the hillfort, for which they cite evidence dating as far back as the 9th century. The alternative name 'Castell Caer Lleion' seems to date to the late 17th century and probably came about due to a mistranslation. Indeed, 'Castell Caer' is somewhat of a tautology, translating into English as \\"Castle Fort\\". Because there is no standardised name for the site, it is referred to variously as 'Caer Seion', 'Castell Caer Seion', 'Castell Caer Lleion', 'Castell Caer Leion' and 'Conwy Mountain hillfort'. An antiquated name, no longer in popular use but recorded by John Leyland in his 1530s Itinerary in Wales, is 'Sinnodune'. Archaeological excavations There have been three principal excavations at the site: first in 1906 and 1909, then in 1951 and 1952, and finally in 2008. The dearth of dateable finds meant that, until the early part of the 21st century, the dating of the site was largely inferential. Each excavation has revealed a little more about the site, with modern techniques enabling archaeologists to date the earliest known occupation of the fort to within 200 years. First excavation: 1906, 1909 The first recorded excavations ‚Äì carried out by Harold Picton and W. Bezant Lowe ‚Äì were begun in 1906, before a delay caused them to briefly abandon the project and resume it in 1909. Their excavations revealed little, but they are the first to record finding sling stones at the site, and they also turned up a rubbing stone. Bezant Lowe noted the possible existence of a semi-circular defence facing the entrance to the smaller fort. In one of the huts at the south-western end of the small fort they uncovered a stone floor, haphazard for the most part, but carefully laid and fitted together at one side of the hut. Picton notes that there was no evidence of the floor being used as a hearth, but does not speculate further as to the nature of the feature. Second excavation: 1951, 1952 Plan of later fort at western margin of Caer Seion.By far the most extensive of the excavations were those conducted on behalf of the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales. Most of what we now know about the site stems from these digs, carried out by W.E. Griffiths and A.H.A. Hogg. They concluded that the site showed two periods of fortification, both within the latter part of the pre-Roman Iron Age. Whilst we now know that the fort was occupied as early as the Early to Middle Iron Age, the archaeologists did note at the time that their evidence for dating was slight; and for structural development was 'largely inferential'. They were the first to provide evidence that the two forts were designed to be used concurrently, based on the layout of the walls at the juncture of the two enclosures, and also speculate that the two separate enclosures were accessible to each other via some form of moveable ladder. No direct evidence exists to support this, but Griffiths and Hogg thought it likely because of the existence of a level causeway leading through the eastern defensive ditch to the northern corner of the small enclosure, where there were no entrances. (See F1 on the annotated plan; this feature is also clearly visible on the image in the infobox.) Third excavation: 2008 The third excavation was small in scale, but important for being able to offer definitive dating evidence pertaining to the occupation of the two forts. It was carried out by George Smith of the Gwynedd Archaeological Trust, on behalf of Cadw, with environmental reports by Astrid E. Caseldine and Catherine Griffiths from the University of Wales. They were inspired to carry out this undertaking because of a 1991 survey (and subsequent report) by the Snowdonia National Park Authority, which remarked that the 1956 excavation had identified charcoal-rich layers that could be targeted for future research. The excavation and radiocarbon analysis of this charcoal allowed the team to place the earliest known occupation of the original fort at somewhere between the 6th and 4th centuries BC, and the construction of smaller fort around the 4th century BC. These investigations were not able to date the construction of the original fort, but did put the known occupation of the site back by a number of centuries, whilst also suggesting it was abandoned sometime before the 2nd century BC. This would render a popular theory, that the fort was torn down as a result of the Roman invasion of Wales in 48 AD, unlikely. Analysis of pollen, grain and wood also allowed reasonable speculation to be made as to the likely diet and occupation of the fort's inhabitants, and also to the make-up of the wider landscape. (See \\"Environment\\" for further details.) Huts Only a small number of the more than 50 roundhouses known to have existed on site have ever been archaeologically excavated. The style of these huts seems largely contiguous throughout the two periods of the fort construction, with a general similarity in size and material found within. This contrasts with other sites which had occupation (or reoccupation) throughout the Roman period and beyond, where a distinct mix of architectural styles and hut shapes can often be observed. The roofing arrangements do, however, show some development on the site, with the dearth of post holes in the huts dated to the first period (Huts 1 and 3) suggesting some kind of wigwam roofing, whereas the hut that was examined from the later period (Hut 4) shows evidence of two systems of roof timbering involving internal posts. Many of the huts lay along a terrace behind the main southern rampart, where it has been speculated that the inhabitants would have been protected from the wind. Entrances Three definite entrances were identified at the site, with another possible one speculated, but not confirmed. The only one to be examined fully was the main entrance to the earlier fort, whilst the other two were cleared of recent additions and surveyed in less detail. Main entrance The main entrance, located in the southern rampart slightly to the east of Hut 1, was 17 feet long and 8.6 inches at its narrowest point (see 'first fort entrance' on the annotated plan). The entrance appears to have been paved at one time, but the stones have now eroded and only slight traces remain. The thickened rampart of the outside entrance was supported by a plinth of large, flat blocks, set into a foundation trench, which extended 17 feet to the East; and sat flush with the surface of the subsoil, suggesting it would have been invisible when in contemporary use. This plinth was necessary to support the heavier parts of the rampart on the slope of the ground to the south. It is likely that four large, square post holes found at the East and West sides of the entrance passage, belonged to a wooden bridge over the gateway; and would have supported the (likely timber) gate itself, probably on a pair of outer posts. The gate opening was 6 feet wide and could therefore have been secured by a single door. Entrance to the smaller fort Little is known about the entrance to the smaller fort as it has not been fully excavated, but the existence of large, square post holes similar to those found in the main entrance suggest that they probably served the same function as those found in the entrance to the main fort. The only notable difference was their location, with the post holes being situated not inside the passage itself, but around the corner of the passage, against the inner rampart. Outwork entrance The third entrance was in the defensive outwork structure located at the south-east of the site, (see 'blocked entrance to outwork' on the annotated plan). Minimal investigation was made of this feature, but enough to establish that it formed a passage about 19 feet wide and 23 feet long, set between the overlapping ends of the ramparts and faced with orthostats (a large stone with a more or less slab-like shape), some of which have been described as 'almost megalithic in character'. The North side had collapsed, blocking the entrance, but the archaeologists speculated that it must have been an impressive structure in its original form, and possibly designed with this effect in mind. Defences The main defences of both forts were stone-built walls of varying construction, sometimes accompanied on their outer side with a ditch. The larger fort remained almost unchanged during its lifetime and was protected by a single wall which enclosed the site on the three accessible sides, following the best natural line for defence. The smaller fort had two distinct periods of construction and was more strongly fortified than the main enclosure; its original incarnation being larger and more elaborately fortified, than its latter. Whilst most structural details of the site were simple, the defences of the small fort were particularly unusual in the context of other Iron Age hillforts, as they were designed to be defended against the inside of the main enclosure, as well as from outside attack. Primary rampart The primary rampart which enclosed the site on three sides (East, South and West), was said to follow a 'sinuous' course along the hill top, 'selecting the line most suitable for defence'. The outer southward face of this rampart was described as being much ruined, about 10 feet thick, built of fairly large stones, and potentially containing a number of slabs laid on edge. The inner face was built partly of laid masonry and partly of slabs laid on edge; the slabs were differing sizes but some are described as 'very large'. Around the entrance to the larger fort the rampart is noted as having double-facing, and further along to the east the outer face of the rampart is described as being well-preserved, with a pronounced batter (meaning it was deliberately constructed with a receding slope for stability). The steep cliffs to the North and north-east meant that no extra defences were needed on that side of the fort, but where the incline is shallower to the north-west, the remains of a rampart could be traced. It was described as much ruined and overgrown with turf, and the investigators could not make out its construction, although they did note an additional defensive ditch along its outside face (marked on the annotated map as D1). This ditch extended the length of the rampart and continued to the south-west, around a rocky outcrop at the extreme West of the site (see D2). Small fortress The south wall of the small enclosure was measured as being wider than that of the original rampart, being estimated at 12‚Äì16 feet thick; and built of laid masonry. Outside the south-west wall of the small fort, an additional defensive wall was examined and found to end on a rock outcrop at the westernmost point of the site (see R1 on map). The defensive ditch which followed the north-west rampart of the main fort, carried on around this wall, and where it rounded the western outcrop, there was clear evidence that a smaller, additional ditch had been cut (see E1). The larger of the ditches continued parallel to the southern wall of the smaller fort, ending just in front of the defensive outwork (see D3). Inside the large fort, and running parallel to the eastern wall of the small fort was an additional bank-and-ditch defence combination, which was interrupted by low causeways (see F1). Outwork The outwork was notable for the fact that it was constructed in a different fashion to the other walls on the site, being faced by large blocks laid flat ‚Äì or as was the case near the entrance ‚Äì with slabs on edge; and filled with small stones and earth. Huts associated with defence Two huts were also associated with the defences; hut 1 because of its location just inside the entrance to the larger fort, and also the hut adjoining hut 3 on its east, for the same reason. Bolstering this theory is the fact that in hut 1 the investigators found 612 sling stones, half of which lay stacked in a neat pile against the inner face of the south-east wall, suggesting their likely use as a defensive arsenal. Whilst the hut immediately to the East of hut 3 was not actually examined by the archaeologists; the discovery of a number of sling stones by Picton and Bezant Lowe at this site in 1909, somewhat corroborates this speculation. Material finds Various finds.The site has yielded many small material finds which helped early archaeologists date the fort to the Iron Age period, in the absence of any datable pottery. Among the more notable finds were 1,141 sling stones, in the shape of smooth, oval beach pebbles, 1‚Äì2 inches long (about half of which were found together in a neat pile against the inner face of the hut wall) ‚Äì a possible pair of iron tweezers, and a probable lignite spindlewhorl; which are found rarely in Britain. A small fragment of corroded iron has also been suggested as a possible lancehead, or knife. A number of stone spindlewhorls were also found, along with a total of four saddle querns, some rubbing stones, hones (or whetstones), various pot boilers and some stones of uncertain use. Among the identifiable bone fragments uncovered, were those of ox, horse and sheep. Environment Analysis of pollen indicated that the area in and immediately around the fort was a heath and grass dominated environment, much the same as is in existence today; whilst pollen and charcoal analysis suggest it likely that the site existed close to a woodland containing hazel, birch and alder.

It is located in the Medina and consists of three narrow winding alleys. There are rooms on both sides of the alleys where girls try to attract clients. Only men (apart from the women who work there) are allowed in the alleys. Location The dead end alley is located at the entrance to the Medina, a few hundred meters from the Al-Zaytuna Mosque and the souks. This narrow and discreet alley - fifty meters long and in some places only one meter wide  hardly differs from the surrounding lanes. It is located between the old Jewish quarter, the Hara, and the French quarter. On both sides of the alley there are small rooms in front of which the girls wait for their customers. History Tolerated and then recognised by the authorities in 1942, the alley was mainly frequented by Tunisians, Muslims or Jews during the French protectorate. The women who worked there often come from underprivileged backgrounds, their clients also being for the most part poor men, many coming from Algeria. For decades, this street was the only place where Jewish prostitutes could work. In 1942 the Tunisian Government legalised prostitutes as \\"fonctionnaires\\" (civil servants). They were required to register and strictly regulated. One of the regulations was that they could only operate from designated areas. Sidi Abdallah Guech was the area designated in Tunis. The nature of this area has continued until current times. Jasmine Revolution Following the 2011 Jasmine Revolution, the Islamist government turned a blind eye to fundamentalist action against the red light districts. Many were burnt down, in others the prostitutes were turned out and the buildings wrecked. On 18 February 2011 a large group of fundamentalists, estimates vary between less than 100 and nearly 2,000, approached the entrance of Sidi Abdallah Guech loudly demanding moral cleanliness and armed with sticks and torches. Locals barricaded the entrance to the alleys until police and military arrived. Police fired warning shots into the air to disperse the rioters. This event came within the framework of a campaign led by Salafists who demanded the closure of red-light districts and lead to the closure of the red-light districts in B√©ja, Kairouan, M√©denine, Sfax and Sousse. Since then the street sign has been removed and a notice put up 'Closed on Fridays and during Ramadan' to try and appease the fundamentalists. Status Prostitution practised in this authorised location, supervised by the State, is not an offence. As a result, the prostitutes of Sidi Abdallah Guech, who have the status of civil servants, are placed under the control of the services of the Ministry of Public Health and pay taxes. In 2011, a total of 238 prostitutes were registered of which nearly 50 visited the local health centre daily. Literature Sidi Abdallah Guech is mentioned by several authors of Tunisian literature. B≈´rƒÅwƒ´ ·π¨arƒÅbulusƒ´ mentions the alley several times in Thunis Thanatos. Abdelmajid Bouslama, in Les portes du Menzel, described it as a place of initiation for the young narrator given that extramarital relationships are very frowned upon by society. Tahar Fazaa includes it in Chroniques hebdo as part of the history of prostitution in Tunisia, pointing out that Jewish prostitutes were located there.

History of Morelos, Conquest and Revolution (1929-1930) was a fresco painted by Mexican artist Diego Rivera in Cuernavaca's Palace of Cort√©s. The piece was commissioned by Dwight Morrow, U.S. Ambassador to Mexico at the time. Rivera chose the history of Mexico's conquest for the subject of the mural. The mural begins with the invasion of Mexico by the Spanish, going in chronological order of Mexico's history from that invasion. Rivera chose to focus on the region of Cuernavaca, as that was the mural's location, and the native Indian people of that region, showing their reactions towards the Spaniards' invasion and the events that took place afterwards. It is still available for viewing inside the Palace of Cort√©s in Cuernavaca today.  About the artist  Diego Rivera with wife Frida Khalo (left), 1932 Diego Rivera was a well-known artist from Mexico. He was born in Guanajuato, Mexico and began studying art at the Academy of San Carlos in Mexico City by the age of ten. In his adult years, Rivera spent time studying art in Europe both in Madrid, Spain and Paris, France. While there, he spent time with other artists, such as Ilya Ehrenburg and Max Jacob, learning new styles of art. Rivera returned to Mexico in 1921 and then began his career in muralism. Coming back to Mexico during the middle of its political revolution, Rivera was drawn in by then Mexican Secretary of Education, Jos√© Vasconcelos, who called him to create paintings on the walls of prominent state buildings. Rivera then began to partake in the muralist movement, creating works dealing with the political issues of the time - revolutionary nationalism - in relation to Mexico's past and quickly becoming one of the most well known artists of the Mexican muralism movement, with many considering Rivera's pieces to be unforgettable, as they stick within the minds and hearts of those that see them. There are many murals that Rivera is known for. Some of his earlier murals include those at Chapingo Chapel and those at the Ministry of Education (Secretariat of Public Education). Both of these works focused on revolutionary ideas of the time and the timeline of the Mexican revolution itself. One of his later works, located at the National Palace in Mexico City and titled History of Mexico, incorporates an illustration of Mexico's history with an illustration of the revolution currently taken place. Rivera also incorporated communist and socialist imagery into the mural, as he became a member of the Mexican Communist Party after returning to Mexico. Later, however, he was told to leave the party due to his affiliations and workings with the United States and the Mexican government.  Palace of Cort√©s  Palace of Cort√©s in Cuernavaca, MexicoThe Palace of Cort√©s was built as a place of refuge for Conquistador Hern√°n Cort√©s and his family after the conquest of Mexico by the Spanish. The land was gifted to Cort√©s which he then used to build his secondary palace. Construction dates are estimated between the late 1520s and early 1530s. It was used as the Cort√©s family's personal home for some time and then was transformed into a prison, state legislature, and eventually into a museum, which it remains as currently.  Commission  Dwight Morrow, United States Ambassador to Mexico Dwight Morrow, U.S. Ambassador to Mexico from 1927 to 1930, commissioned Rivera to do the piece in 1929. It was meant to represent an act of good will and good intention towards Mexico and the city of Cuernavaca. However, some believe it to be a strategic move of diplomacy after Morrow had worked with Mexican president, Plutarco Calles, to amend Mexican legislation in favor of American investors. Rivera agreed to complete the commission, on the condition that he be granted free rein over the subject chosen for the mural.

Because of the chronological sequence Rivera painted it in, the mural must be read from right to left. It takes up three walls and other smaller sections of an open corridor on the second floor of the palace, totaling to be 148.6 square meters of painted space. The mural ultimately has two different sections - the upper half, being the nine panels in color, and the lower half, being the eleven grisailles in black and white or grey. The History of Cuernavaca and Morelos - Zapata's Horse The grisailles pieces underneath tell the story of Cort√©s' disembarkation and his initial meetings with the Indian locals and emissaries sent out by Moctezuma, as well as a paralleled representation of the story shown above. The remaining portions of the mural, in vivid color, go in detail about the actual conquest of the Mexican people in Cuernavaca as well as the fights and societal changes which took place after the conquest. Starting from the first panel, Rivera shows the fights which took place during the Spanish conquest. He portrays Aztec warriors and Spanish soldiers in their traditional war gear, showing the stark contrast between the metal uniforms of the Spaniards and the colorful war costumes of the Aztecs with their spiked wooden clubs. The mural moves on the show the defeat of the Indians in Cuernavaca and the events which took place afterwards, during Spanish rule. Rivera depicts the building of the Palace of Cort√©s by Indian slaves and then shows them as laborers for the Spanish ruled state of Morelos, in which they were predominantly sugarcane cutters. Rivera then proceeds to show the religious history and details the conversions by Catholic priests which took place throughout Mexico. The conversions are shown to be seemingly peaceful but also show the cruelty behind such conversions and what happened to the Indians throughout them. In the smaller piece above the doorway towards the end of the corridor, Rivera depicts persecutions and burning of Indian heretics by the Spanish, which mirrors the Aztec sacrifices that Rivera placed at the beginning of the mural. The very last panel, then, shows an image of Emiliano Zapata - a main and important figure in the Mexican revolution - depicting liberation from Spanish colonial rule.  Interpretation  Rivera made sure that he could choose the subject of this mural. Because he was working on his mural for the National Palace at the time, he decided to continue with his theme of Mexico's history in relation to Spanish conquest and the hardships natives endured because of it. Rivera portrays the dominance of the Spanish over the Indians in warfare and the violence which the Indians endured. Although the mural focuses on the accurate depiction of Mexico's history and its people's experiences with European conquest, it also is meant to show the nationalism of the Mexican people who were affected by such conquest. Through Rivera's idealistic depiction of Mexico and a darker, more negative depiction of the European world, one can see a message of Mexican integrity. In Rivera's opinion, the indigenous peoples were a perfect picture of resistance against colonialism and Mexican independence. Due to the subject of the mural and the backstory of its commission, there are many political interpretations of Rivera's work. A major political message throughout the mural is that of European invasion of Mexico and its culture. Rivera uses the influence of Italian renaissance compositional form, such as the grisailles, to show that European existed in the past and still currently exists. Rivera placed a small painting of an Aztec human sacrifice at the beginning of the corridor in order to allude to the brutalities committed by Spanish invaders, showing the exchange of Mexican culture's cruelty for the cruelty of Spanish culture. However, the final images of Zapata symbolize Mexico's liberation from Europe and colonialism.  Controversy and irony  Prior to working on this piece, Rivera was a steady member of the Mexican Communist Party. He was a strong supporter of Karl Marx and a strong nationalist and anti-imperialist. Rivera's murals were known for having heavy political connotations with references to Marx and other revolutionary figures. Despite this, Dwight Morrow, the U.S. Ambassador and an American capitalistic, commissioned Rivera for the piece. Because of Rivera's agreement to complete this project and others within the United States and for the Mexican government, the Mexican Communist Party began to doubt his loyalty to their cause. They ultimately kicked Rivera out of the party and he later went to the U.S. in order to work on other pieces.

The company works with vehicle for hire companies, scooter sharing, and bicycle-sharing systems to improve the safety and reliability of their vehicle fleets. Superpedestrian is also the manufacturer of a consumer- facing product known as the Copenhagen Wheel, an electric bicycle wheel that transforms a traditional bicycle into a hybrid e-bike. History Superpedestrian's first product, The Copenhagen Wheel, was developed at MIT‚Äôs Senseable City Lab in 2009 in partnership with the city of Copenhagen, and unveiled at the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference. In December 2012, Assaf Biderman, a co-inventor of the Wheel and Associate Director of the MIT Senseable City Lab, founded Superpedestrian to commercialize the Wheel. After several years of engineering, testing, and validation, the Copenhagen Wheel officially launched in April 2017. In December 2018, the Boston Business Journal reported the company will be shifting their focus and start building electric scooters and supplying the scooter sharing fleet operators such as Bird and Lime.  Products   Fleet Vehicles  Superpedestrian works with vehicle for hire companies, scooter-sharing, and bicycle-sharing systems worldwide to provide fleets of small electric vehicles optimized for safety, reliability, and seamless riding experiences. Fleet operators contend with the challenges of managing and maintaining large numbers of motorized vehicles including electric bicycles, motorized scooters, and mopeds. Building on sensing, monitoring, and control systems developed for the Copenhagen Wheel, Superpedestrian's fleet vehicles and Vehicle Intelligence platform offer solutions to common fleet operation problems. Their platform allows operators to remotely monitor fleet health, boost maintenance efficiency, manage user accounts, and improve customer experiences, leading to lower operating costs and increased revenue.  Copenhagen Wheel  The Copenhagen Wheel is a rear wheel electric bicycle system that fits most existing bicycle frames - requiring a metal frame and V-brakes. It replaces an existing rear wheel, transforming the bicycle into a smart electric hybrid/pedelec. The Copenhagen Wheel contains a custom brushless motor, advanced sensors, control systems, and a lithium-ion battery, all contained within the hub of a single rear bicycle wheel. Combining actual torque, power, cadence, pedal position, and acceleration sensing with high-speed controllers and actuators, the Wheel generates power that is seamlessly synchronized with a rider's pedaling. Bluetooth connectivity enables riders to personalize their cycling experience from their smartphone with ride modes such as Turbo, Eco, and Exercise. A smartphone also acts as a digital key, activating the Wheel automatically when ready to ride, and communicating with the cloud in real time. A self- diagnostic safety system monitors components within the Wheel and proactively responds to events within milliseconds, protecting both rider and Wheel. Electronic Braking Assistance allows riders to brake and recharge the battery simultaneously, simply by backpedaling. Finally, with over-the-air updates, the Wheel improves with new features over time. The Copenhagen Wheel is currently available in the continental U.S.. Superpedestrian works with over 260 independent bicycle retailers across the United States to provide demos, maintenance, and installation services.  Link  Link is a shared electric scooter-sharing service made by Superpedestrian Inc. The trial period started in early 2020 in a small town in Florida. It will launch in four cities in the US and in Europe.  Funding  Superpedestrian has raised more than $63 million in venture capital investment from firms including Cambridge-based General Catalyst and Spark Capital. Additional investors include Tony Fadell, Charles Kim, Jared Leto, Xavier Niel, Paul Sagan, and Christian Klingler.

The residence was purposely built, and used, by Catholic clergy as a residence and for general community services. It was built and completed in 1870 by the Mdina Cathedral. It was used for its original purpose for less than two decades, after which went through adaptive reuse. Today the townhouse lies in the Urban Conservation Area (UCA). It is considered a historic house, however has been the subject for demolition due to its site being of high economic interest for high rise development. It is currently in good condition but left neglected. An application to develop the site into flat has been refused in March 2019. History Sliema developed into a town during the British Crown Colony of Malta, when several townhouses were built both by the British and by the Maltese. It was common for the Maltese to build their houses in the vernacular style, mixed with some influence of the period. The Mdina Cathedral took the decision to built a modest building at 33, Cathedral Street, to serve as residence for Roman Catholic clergymen who had the purpose to serve the ever-growing community in Sliema. The townhouse was completed and started to be used from 1870. It served for its original premise for about sixteen years, when in 1886 it changed purpose. A coat-of-arms in the entrance is representative of its original use. It later went under different adaptive reuse and changed ownership several times. At one point it was the home of an elderly woman who was renting it from third parties. As the woman required more dependence on carers due to age, she moved to an elderly home care. She left the house vacant but continued to pay the low rent based on her contract, which was agreed upon several years before. The contract also implied that she was to use the property as a residence, but after moving out, it was claimed by the owners that she no longer uses the building as per contract as officially she was living elsewhere. The owners used this reason in order to get their valuable property in their hands, using the clause of contract in their favour. Over the years, several townhouses in the area were demolished, were partially demolished or were subject to redevelopment for several reasons. The building lies in the core of high commercial and other economic interests, and has become subject to be completely demolished to built a high rise building on its site. The building is a landmark and lies in the Urban Conservation Area (UCA) of Sliema. The iconic and sentimental building is a historic house but enjoys no significant protection, such as other immediate vicinity buildings that are either scheduled, listed as National Monuments or both. The Planning Authority (PA) has received a demolition application in 2017, which is now subject to a board decision over the matter. General opinion, from people not connected to the economic interest, is in favour of conserving the building, and to avoid a domino effect for other buildings in the area. It is also argued that further development in the area would increase congestion and impact on the people already residing in the area. On a political level, the Partit Demokratiku (Democratic Party) has advocated for its conservation and showed its concern if the demolition would be given the go ahead. The spokesperson for the party said that: Architecture Details on fa√ßade At some point the house was named Carmen. The building is two stories high, with a groundfloor and a first floor. It has a vernacular baroque fa√ßade, generally described simply as being vernacular, with a balanced facade and front terrace. The fa√ßade is characterized by a main door, with one window on each side on the groundfloor. The part of the fa√ßade on the upper floor has a traditional closed timber balcony, supported by detailed decorative corbels the middle of which having a sculpted head of a lion. Similar to the groundfloor, the upper floor has a window on each side however are complemented by a corbel above each. The interior of the house is rich in architecture and has been described by the Planning Authority as ‚Äúconsist[ing] of a symmetrical double fronted town-house having a restrained neo-classical exterior with a more lavish internal layout accentuated by fine architectural detailing concentrated in the main hall and main staircase, together with its centralised axis leading from the front door to the ‚Äònympheum‚Äô at the back of the garden. The town house under consideration is the last in this row of houses which abut it on the left, whilst on the right it is abutted by a single fronted Art Nouveau town house, attributed to Architect Giovanni Psaila who worked prolifically in the Sliema area during the first part of the 20th century and whose most noteworthy work is Balluta Buildings.‚Äù The townhouse has a large back garden, with trees that were planted years ago which are sparse over its grounds. An elaborate niche is found at the very end of the garden.https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/environment/townscapes/73177/faa_accuses_architects_of_hiding_heritage_value_of_properties_in_pa_applications#.XJZXchrTWhA Since December 2017, the house has been designated as a Grade II building.

One of the founding members of the Finnish Salvation Army, she became aware of the effects of poverty and unsanitary conditions for new mothers. She established the first maternity home in Porvoo, published materials to educate women on childbirth and sanitation, and provided counseling for new mothers. Recognizing the needs of unwed mothers, she established one of the first homes to offer single mothers training and follow-up care so that they were able to provide for both the health and economic welfare of their families. Raising three foster daughters, as a single parent, she dedicated her time to helping mothers and children. In later life, she established a private retirement home for women. Early life Alva Forsius was born on 24 May 1866 on a farm in Porvoon maalaiskunta in what was the Grand Duchy of Finland of the Russian Empire to Hulda Aurora Hollm√©rus and Johan Wilhelm Forsius. She was the second child in a family of twelve children. She attended the Porvoo Girls' School, completing her certificate in 1884 and then entered a two-year course in handicrafts at the Helsinki Teacher Training Center, as well as a course at the Helsinki School of Chemistry. Career Forsius began her career at the Porvoo Women's Crafts School, teaching sewing machine use. She moved to Helsinki and grew concerned about the poverty in her neighborhood. Having a strong desire to help others, she became a pioneer in establishing the Finnish Salvation Army. The original idea of the organization came from Baroness Louise af Forselles, who recruited Forsius, Hedvig von Haartman, and Constantin Boije af Genn√§s and his wife to help her organize a Finnish branch in late 1888. The group left in April 1889 to travel to England and study to become rescue officers and returned after a six-month training period. Forsius spent a decade in the service and trained as a midwife before she resigned from the organization to focus on obstetrics in 1898. On 17 April 1895, Forsius had graduated as a midwife from the Helsinki Obstetrics Hospital and began working throughout the countryside surrounding Porvoo. On 10 September 1898 she graduated from a technical course on the use of equipment to facilitate births and decided to open a private maternity clinic in Porvoo which offered safe and hygienic conditions for expectant mothers. Her facility offered five beds, and received a city subsidy for providing services to the women of the community. It was the first maternity hospital in Porvoo. Quickly she outgrew the facility and began planning a larger maternal home, which opened in 1902. The new facility had twelve beds and the city subsidy was increased accordingly. In addition to a safe birthing environment, mothers were given instruction on childcare and hygiene. Each mother who left the facility received information on formula for increasing baby-birth weights and sterilized bottles. In spite of the help she was able to give, Forsius felt that inadequate help was given, as there was not enough time in a lying-in facility for sufficient counseling or training, and she was moved by the plight of unwed mothers who were rejected by society. She also took in three of the children born at her facility, Anna Sofia (1900‚Äì1924), Marta Bernhardine (1905‚Äì?) and Eva Elisabet (1912‚Äì2014). She took in Anna as a foster child, but legally adopted Marta and Eva in 1929. In 1910, Forsius put the maternity hospital up for sale, but it was two years before a buyer was actually found. In the meantime, she began work on developing an unwed mother's home. Her plan called for expectant mothers to receive nutritional help before the birth and then remain at the facility for up to six months after their child's birth so that they could receive education and training to provide for their family welfare during their stay and follow-up visits for up to three years after the child's birth to offer additional assistance. She purchased a lot and built a large building which had four bedrooms, a parlor, a children's playroom, a dining room, office, kitchen and three balconies. Though she solicited donations, she was unable to furnish the structure and negotiated with the Salvation Army to run the home. She named the facility \\"Solhem\\" and it opened in 1914 at the beginning of World War I, as one of the first facilities of its kind in the country. Mothers were charged a small fee, but most could not pay and were taught to make handicrafts and sell them to cover the costs. They grew their own food and shared communally in the chores to keep the home running. Over the next several years, Forsius focused on raising her daughters and continued publishing. She had published her first work, I v√§ntade dagar, n√•gra enkla r√•d f√∂r blifvande m√∂drar (In coming days, some simple advice for future mothers) as a guide for expectant mothers in 1899. It was reprinted in 1900 and 1901 with variations in the title, and was a detailed and practical guide giving information on abortion, breast care, childbirth, exercise, illness, miscarriage, nutrition, and sanitation. In 1922, she published a volume of poetry, Fosterbarnen (Foster children) dedicated to her children. Both the Finnish and Swedish language versions quickly sold out and it was reprinted the following year. Two years later, in 1924, her first daughter, Anna, who had trained as a nurse, died. She published many articles on childbirth and an annual report Barnb√∂rd shuset i Borg√• (Childbirth statistics in Porvoo), which gave the numbers of patients treated, length of treatment, illnesses and number of babies born. In 1925, Forsius founded a facility to care for aging women called sivistyneiden naisten vanhainkotia (Sophisticated Aging Women's Home) as there were very few private retirement homes in Finland. Some existed to care for those who were too poor to maintain themselves, but there were no facilities for those who could care for themselves but were unable to live totally independently in Porvoo. Death and legacy Forsius died on 14 July 1935 in Porvoo, Finland and was buried in the N√§sin Cemetery. In 2013, the Alva Forsius Memorial Association was founded to preserve her memory and foster scholarship on her work. In 2016, the City of Porvoo held multiple events in honor of the 150th Anniversary of her birth. As part of those festivities, a statue in her honor was erected in Porvoo in 2016. \\"Solhemi\\", the home she established for unwed mothers, was turned into a kindergarten in 1957 and is one of the three surviving farms which had been operated by the Salvation Army in the country.

She served as Executive Director of the Seattle-King County chapter of Planned Parenthood for 27 years, and was instrumental in Washington State Referendum 20, a referendum in 1970 that successfully legalized early pregnancy abortion in the state of Washington.  Early life and education  Minto was born October 11, 1927, in Hamilton, Montana. Her grandparents had moved to Montana from Virginia in 1890; Minto's grandfather was the personal attorney of \\"Copper King\\" Marcus Daly and had helped form Montana's first legislature. Minto met her husband, B-29 pilot Robert Minto, during her sophomore year at the University of Montana, and they married three months later. The couple moved to Washington soon after their marriage, and Minto finished her education at the University of Washington. They had three children ‚Äì two daughters and a son.  Career  Minto's first paid position was a job at the UN Pavilion at Seattle's World Fair in 1962.  Planned Parenthood  In the late 1950s, a friend had asked Minto to join the local Seattle-King County board of Planned Parenthood. Concerned by the lack of practical sex education in schools, and by the absence of birth control and women's health issues in media coverage, Minto began teaching sex education in schools and giving speeches locally in her role as a Planned Parenthood volunteer. She developed a sex education association for King County. The Seattle-King County Planned Parenthood had been largely run by volunteers up to this point, but in 1967 the organization wanted to expand its services into other parts of Washington, and Minto was hired as the full-time executive director. = Washington State Referendum 20 = In 1967, Washington psychologist Sam Goldenberg organized a meeting of medical, legal and religious professionals to discuss the health crisis created by lack of access to safe abortions, and Minto was invited to attend. Aside from her work at Planned Parenthood, Minto was already aware of the need for safe abortions through administrative work at the University Unitarian Church, where she had encountered young pregnant women ‚Äì and their male partners ‚Äì searching for assistance. Sam Goldenberg's group continued its discussions and debates, formally becoming the Citizens' Abortion Study Group (later renamed the Washington Citizens for Abortion Reform). Despite being supportive of a woman's right to choose, Minto later recalled that the group was primarily focused on the healthcare issues involved: > Those of us who worked on this, I guess it would be fair to say we were less > concerned about women's rights than women's health. The medical people who > were involved had all had direct experience with the very harmful effects of > back alley abortions. The group concluded that the state needed to legalize abortions, and they subsequently drafted a bill to submit to legislature. Despite the endorsement of the bill by dozens of groups, including the Washington State Medical Association and the Washington Citizens' Committee on Crime, and the support of Republican Governor Dan Evans, the bill was not passed by legislators. Minto and the others decided to pursue a state referendum instead, seeking support from individuals and organizations all over Washington, and Minto gave over 100 public speeches and presentations leading up to the referendum. They received endorsements from over 62 organizations such as the Washington State Bar Association, the State Council of Churches, the Washington State PTA, the Washington Environmental Council and the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. When the referendum took place on November 3, 1970, Washington voters approved state legalization of abortion ‚Äì with certain conditions attached ‚Äì passing it with 56.5 per cent of the votes. Washington was the first U.S. state to legalize abortion through a vote of the people. After the referendum, Minto worked to further improve abortion accessibility, working with organizations such as the University of Washington YWCA branch to compile lists of medical doctors who were available to help women seeking an abortion. = 1980s = During the 1980s, Minto initiated discussions with Seattle Archbishop Raymond G. Hunthausen, trying to find common ground between her organization and the Catholic Church; although the discussions were ultimately unsuccessful, Seattle stood as one of the only U.S. cities in which the Catholic Church entered into serious talks with Planned Parenthood. = 1990s = In 1991, Minto appeared before the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources to denounce new Title X regulations introduced in 1988 that prevented family planning clinics from giving any information about abortions to patients. Speaking as part of a panel alongside Senator Rhoda E. Perry and Beth Quill, director of ambulatory services of the Women and Infants Hospital of Rhode Island, Minto argued that family planning clinics could not provide effective healthcare services without the freedom to properly inform their patients of all options: > Family planning is all about planned and wanted children, and I really want > to make this statement because I care a lot about that. It's about healthy > mothers rearing healthy children ... Family planning is about having the > information you need before you make decisions. It's about taking control of > your own life and being responsible for your own body ... I've lived too > long to think we can ever solve all the problems of women's healthcare ‚Äì > it's a moving target ‚Äì but we can and we've got to look beyond the blinders > of our own experience, our own religious beliefs, our own upbringing, > sometimes our own cherished values, and see and appreciate the differing > realities of other peoples' lives.  Retirement  In 1993, after serving as executive director for 27 years, Minto retired from Planned Parenthood. She joined the Brush Foundation board of directors, which she chaired for three years before finally stepping down at the age of 80.

Losses were heavy. These formations, composed of Spanish Republicans and Jews from Central Europe in majority, combat engaged with such a determination, that on June 5,6,7, while being completely surrounded at Villers-Carbonnel, near P√©ronne, and heavily bombarded by artillery and aviation, the regiment resisted during 48 hours to all the attacks.

As part of his work with CIP, he has been involved in many cases involving the exoneration of previously-convicted prisoners, working closely with the organization's director, Justin Brooks, and also preparing petitions for many of CIP's clients. After working at CIP while still a law student at California Western School of Law, following graduation in 2010 he became an investigator and then a staff attorney there. He was involved in the high-profile case of star linebacker Brian Banks, and was instrumental in Banks' exoneration in 2012 from a wrongful 2002 conviction as a sex offender, which had destroyed Banks' promising career as a high-school athlete. As a result of his work on this case, the (now defunct) California Lawyer Magazine named Semanchik Attorney of the Year in 2013. In the Spring of 2013, Semanchik and two other CIP attorneys walked over 700 miles from San Diego to Sacramento in an event called The Innocence March, a public protest against the incarceration of twelve California inmates they considered innocent, which also served to bring awareness to the problem of wrongly convicted prisoners. They also presented twelve petitions to California Governor Jerry Brown, demanding clemency for the twelve. Semanchik has spoken at a number of conferences relating to investigations and his work with the California Innocence Project. He has appeared in the media relating to this work over three dozen times. He has also authored essays relating to the criminal justice system, advocating for reform. In 2014, the San Diego Daily Transcript recognized Semanchik in its list of \\"Top Attorneys.\\" Legal training In 2008, while still attending CWSL, he joined CIP as a clinic student, through which he investigated claims of innocence under staff supervision. Following his year as a clinic student, Semanchik assisted director Justin Brooks in drafting the first Wrongful Conviction Casebook. In 2010, Semanchik graduated cum laude from California Western School of Law. CIP work Responsibilities As Managing Attorney of the California Innocence Project, Semanchik's responsibilities include drafting, filing and litigating habeas petitions and motions for DNA testing in California State courts. He also supervises and oversees law students in the clinical program. He has interviewed and hired as many as 60 interns a year. He also manages CIP's social media presence and website, and produces film and videos for promotional materials. He coordinates with news agencies around the world to maximize CIP's media exposure. He locates, around the U.S., witnesses for cases, and interviews potential clients in prisons all over California. Prominent cases =Brian Banks= The 2002 conviction of All Star linebacker Brian Banks on false charges of rape and kidnapping was dismissed in 2012, directly due to the efforts of the California Innocence Project. Following his initial arrest for the alleged crimes, Banks, despite his protestations of innocence, faced a possible conviction, if the case had gone to trial, of 41-years-to-life, and reluctantly agreed to a plea bargain. He was then given an unexpectedly harsh sentence of six years in prison (of which he served five years and two months), followed by five years' probation and registration as a sex offender. After his release on probation, he arranged for a meeting with his accuser, Wanetta Gibson (who had contacted him through Facebook), at which she admitted on video that there had been no rape or kidnapping in 2002, and that their encounter had been completely consensual. The video evidence was not admissible in court, because the video had been made without Gibson's knowledge or consent and was not accompanied by a signed confession from the young woman. However, Semanchik was instrumental in putting together additional evidence supporting Banks' story, which led the district attorney to dismiss all charges against him and release him from sex- offender status, allowing him to resume his aborted sports career. Banks supports CIP in its efforts on behalf of the wrongly-convicted, including participating in CIP's 2013 Innocence March (see below). He often wears a shirt with the lettering \\"XONR8\\" (\\"exonerate\\"). Semanchik, as a result of his work on this case, was named by California Lawyer Magazine as Attorney of the Year in 2013. =Guy Miles= Semanchik helped defend Guy Miles, who was wrongly convicted of robbery. Semanchik explained in a television interview why the eyewitness identifications in this case were unreliable, and why standards regarding such testimony must be strengthened. \\"The detective [in the case] took six-pack lineups‚Ä¶ and he put more than one suspect in the six- pack, which is an absolute no-no‚Ä¶ he also put various sizes of people in the same six-pack, various hair styles‚Ä¶ the five fillers [non-suspects] are supposed to look somewhat similar to what the suspect looks like,\\" but in this case, they did not. However, despite the fact that Miles had numerous witnesses to provide an alibi for his whereabouts at the time of the crime, and the fact that the two men indisputably guilty of the robbery confessed that Miles had had absolutely nothing to do with the crime, the judge in the case refused to exonerate Miles, maintaining that the eyewitness identifications were strong and rejecting the argument of California Innocence Project attorneys that they were not. Miles was finally freed in June 2017 after 18 years in prison, following a second hearing that reversed his earlier conviction. =Kimberly Long= Kim Long was convicted of murdering her boyfriend in 2003, and her case was received by the California Innocence Project in 2009. After many years of extensive investigation, research and forensic testing, the CIP became certain of Kim's innocence. The case was assigned to CIP attorney Alissa Bjerkhoel. The prosecution's case hinged on the testimony of a single witness, a friend of Long's, who had claimed that, on the night of the murder, he had dropped Long off at the apartment that she and the victim shared, at a time which the prosecution claimed would have allowed Long a window of opportunity sufficient to have committed the crime ‚Äì and concealed her involvement ‚Äì before calling 911 to report the death. (Since the witness himself had died in an unrelated accident shortly after providing his testimony, he could not be cross-examined.) However, the CIP provided forensic proof that the victim had been killed prior to the witness' alleged drop-off time for Long (that is, before the earliest possible time of her return to the apartment), and that, even if the victim had actually been killed after that point in time, Long would not have had enough time to murder her boyfriend and hide evidence of that fact from police. DNA from an unknown male was also recovered at the crime scene. The evidence of her innocence was so compelling that the very same judge who heard the original case reversed the conviction in June 2016. =William Richards= William Richards was convicted in 1993 for murdering his wife Pamela and served 23 years in prison. Part of the reason he was convicted of the murder was because an expert testified that an apparent bite mark on the victim's body was made by Richards. The expert later recanted his testimony. In addition, testing revealed that the DNA on the murder weapons and the hairs under the victim's fingernails belonged to neither Richards nor the victim. When he was released, Richards, 67, was broke, homeless, without a job and suffering from prostate cancer. Wendy Koen, a student who had worked on Bill's case and subsequently became a lawyer, offered to give Bill a place to stay upon his release. Semanchik and CIP have since tried to obtain compensation from the state for the decades he spent wrongly incarcerated. =Reggie Cole= In 1994, Reggie Cole was convicted of the shooting of Felipe Angeles after being misidentified by an eyewitness, a local brothel owner. The police allege that the killer was shot in the leg upon leaving the scene and, after finding a gunshot wound in Cole's leg, concluded that he was the perpetrator. However, despite the fact that medical records were produced that proved Cole had actually received his leg wound six years prior, he was convicted. In 2010, due to the efforts of the California Innocence Project, Cole's conviction was thrown out due to ineffective assistance of counsel, and five years later he was found \\"factually innocent.\\" Semanchik appeared in the 2018 documentary, Survivors Guide to Prison, in relation to his work on the Reggie Cole case. =Michael Hanline= In November 1978, the body of truck driver J.T. McGarry, who had been shot multiple times, was found over 25 miles from his Ventura County home. Michael Hanline was suspected of having murdered him, with the help of an accomplice, because he and McGarry had both been involved with the same woman. Largely on this woman's testimony, Hanline was sentenced to life without parole in 1980. CIP eventually discovered that a since-deceased attorney named Bruce Robertson had attempted to implicate Hanline in order to direct suspicion away from his own clients, and had intimidated potential witnesses. A witness had even placed Robertson at McGarry's home on the night of his murder. In addition, DNA testing pointed to Hanline's innocence, and it was established that the woman who testified against him had been on drugs, both on the night of the murder and at the time of her testimony. On November 24, 2014, Hanline was released from Ventura County Court a free man, and in April of the following year, a judge dismissed all charges against him, as the district attorney had decided not to retry the case. Having served 36 years behind bars, Hanline was the longest-incarcerated person whose conviction was reversed in the history of the State of California until Craig Coley was exonerated in 2017. =Scott McMahon= Scott McMahon is a United States citizen who was wrongfully imprisoned in the Philippines from April, 2011 to August, 2016. Dolores San Pablo Vermeulen, the wife of an acquaintance, had previously called in the police to raid McMahon's home in search of her husband, an action that had an extremely traumatic effect on McMahon's son. McMahon then brought a lawsuit against Vermeulen for child abuse. Vermeulen in turn accused McMahon of having raped her in February 2010, though she had brought no charges until six months after the alleged rape. A medical examination of Vermeulen showed no sign of rape, and McMahon could prove that he was on vacation hundreds of miles away with his family at the time of the alleged assault. Despite lack of evidence of any crime, McMahon was arrested. The California Innocence Project partnered with the David House Agency to represent McMahon, who was held in prison without bail in conditions described as \\"filthy and overcrowded with an overpowering stench.\\" Semanchik, who attended some of McMahon's bail hearings, commented, \\"If the authorities in the Philippines would have done even a shred of an investigation, they would've quickly realized that Scott couldn't have done this.\\" Finally, on August 2, 2016, a Filipino judge acquitted McMahon of all charges. However, McMahon could not leave the country, because the Filipino Bureau of Immigration demanded that he pay them $1000 for every year since his visa expired, despite the fact that the only reason he let it expire was because he had been imprisoned for a crime he didn't commit. Due to heavy U.S. government pressure, McMahon was allowed to return home to Seattle on September 4, 2016. =Horace Roberts= Horace Roberts, a supervisor at a diagnostic lab, was convicted, after three trials, of second-degree murder in the 1998 strangulation death of Terry Cheek, a co-worker with whom the married Roberts had been having an affair. The victim herself had been married to Googie Harris, Sr., who knew about the affair, had filed a restraining order against Cheek and had demanded custody of their daughters. The evidence that had swayed the jury at the third trial was the presence, about a mile from the murder scene, of Roberts‚Äô truck (which Cheek had frequently borrowed), the fact that he had initially lied about the affair with Cheek to police and, above all, the presence near the body of a watch that Roberts had mistakenly identified as his. (Roberts‚Äô watch was later found at his home.) Harris, the victim‚Äôs husband, testified against Roberts at each of his three trials and later opposed Robert‚Äôs release from prison at his parole hearings. \\"In this case,\\" said Semanchik, \\"what stood out was it didn't make sense why somebody that would have committed the crime would have then just left their perfectly operable truck at the scene. Why not get in your truck and drive away?\\" Roberts also had an alibi: on the day of the murder, he had placed multiple calls to Cheek from a pay phone near his home. The CIP decided that the evidence that convicted Roberts was circumstantial and decided to take on the case. In 2016, a request by the CIP for new DNA testing, more sophisticated than what was done in 1998, was granted. DNA from the victim‚Äôs left-hand fingernails and clothes matched to Harris‚Äô nephew, Joaquin Leal, who had served prison time on a molestation case against the child of a woman with whom Harris was then having a relationship. Meanwhile, the CIP lobbied the legislature, in line with other states, to reduce the legal evidentiary standard, which would make the original 2014 DNA evidence to the judge sufficient to exonerate Roberts. The legislature passed this reform in September 2016. All this evidence was brought to the attention of Riverside District Attorney Mike Hestrin‚Äôs Conviction Review Committee. Because of the DNA match, Leal and Harris then became the focus of a new probe. On October 2, 2018, the office agreed to reverse Roberts‚Äô conviction. Ten days later, all charges against Roberts were dismissed, and on October 15, the D.A.‚Äôs office agreed to a Finding of Factual Innocence in Roberts‚Äô case. On the same day, it filed charges in the murder of Terry Cheek against Harris and Leal. \\"We've never seen anything like this,\\" said Semanchik. \\"We've never had a case where the prosecution has gone and made arrests [i.e., of Harris and Leal] after the fact, after we've proven our person innocent. So this is a very unique case.\\" Under the law, wrongfully convicted inmates such as Roberts are entitled to receive $140 for each day incarcerated, which would add up to over $1 million for his nearly 20 years in prison. The Innocence March From April to June 2013, Semanchik, CIP director Justin Brooks and attorney Alissa Bjerkhoel, along with many Canlifornia Innocence Project exonerees and supporters, participated in an event they called The Innocence March. Determined to gain clemency from Governor Jerry Brown for twelve convicted prisoners whom they deemed to be \\"100 percent innocent\\" (including Guy Miles, Kim Long, William Richards and Michael Hanline, who were, at the time, still incarcerated), as well as to gain public awareness of the plight of wrongfully convicted prisoners, they walked a 700-mile route from the CIP's offices in San Diego to the Capitol at Sacramento to formally present their petition on behalf of the twelve to the governor. Semanchik said at the time, in a television interview, \\"I think it's important to have this walk because we need to raise awareness about wrongful convictions. I think there's a lot of people out there that ‚Ä¶ think the criminal justice system is doing its job and doing a great job, and that's just not the case. And so in addition to trying to secure the release of these twelve people, we're also trying to get the word out that criminal justice could use some reform.\\" The trio of lawyers trained extensively for weeks prior to this march. The marchers usually began each day's trek at about 5:30 am and covered about 20 miles by the end of each day, often in inclement weather and sometimes walking along railroad tracks and even through forests. Guy Miles' 80-year-old uncle marched twelve miles of the route with the group despite a leg injury. Semanchik said, \\"To see the kind of support that his family still has for him, that makes you want to walk 10,000 miles ‚Äì whatever it takes.\\" The team of attorneys met Miles himself at San Quentin prison during their journey. Adam Riojas, a CIP client freed after 14 years in prison, accompanied the marchers from San Diego to Oceanside, where he is now the pastor of a local chapel. Brian Banks joined the march at Malibu to lend his support so that other wrongfully-convicted prisoners could be released. The march reached its destination in fifty-one days, four days earlier than the original 55-day schedule. In December of the same year, the California Innocence Project recreated the final (Sacramento) leg of the original march, from Raley Field to the governor's office at the Capitol. Although Gov. Brown did not grant clemency to any of the twelve, the march resulted in extensive press coverage. The Innocence March was selected by San Diego Magazine as one of the \\"27 Reasons to Love SD [San Diego] Now.\\" Five of the twelve prisoners named in the petition (including Miles, Long, Richards and Hanline) have subsequently been freed through CIP's efforts. Legal positions and personal views Semanchik has often given print and broadcast interviews to make the case for criminal justice reform. For example, in a television interview, he criticized an existing law which states that a person accused of a crime must assert his or her innocence immediately, and cannot be exonerated if he or she does so only later on. Semanchik indicated that he has provided facts to lawmakers to encourage them to repeal this \\"timeliness\\" rule. One of his ongoing causes is to obtain adequate compensation for long- term prisoners who have since been found legally innocent and freed from prison. Responding to a question about the case of William Richards (see above), a man who spent 23 years behind bars for a murder he didn't commit, Semanchik spoke on behalf of him and all his freed clients when he said, \\"The compensation process has been nothing but a nightmare for us and for our clients.\\" In a 2015 radio interview relating to the use by police of familial DNA to track down and identify a sexual predator of young children in California, Semanchik suggested that there were serious potential privacy issues in using familial DNA in law enforcement. While conceding that the outcome of the particular case described was a positive one (that is, the predator was apprehended), Semanchik said, \\"We have to do a balancing act, where we have to say, 'keep law enforcement in check, do not allow them to get further down the road and expand upon their use of this.' And that's always going to be an issue, any time you have any kind of technology and ability for law enforcement to pry into‚Ä¶ individuals' lives.\\" In an article about flaws in the science of DNA testing, an incident was described in which CIP asked a large private lab to test evidence that they believed could exonerate a man convicted of murder. After that lab reported that the DNA test was inconclusive, they took the same data to another analyst, who said that the DNA evidence proved the convict was innocent. Semanchik claimed that he had no hesitation about asking more than one analyst to examine the same data, but was troubled by the implications. \\"How can two labs get entirely different answers from the same DNA tests?\\" he was quoted as saying. The CIP has supported efforts to modify or repeal California's so-called Three Strikes Law. In 2012, California referendum Proposition (Prop) 36 ‚Äì which modified the law so that minor felony crimes (such as drug possession) wouldn't count as the third \\"strike\\" if a two-time felon gets convicted for the third time ‚Äì passed by an overwhelming majority of voters. CIP accepted the case under the Institute for Criminal Defense Advocacy (ICDA), an organization that helped found CIP. In November 2012, Kenneth Corley, became the first person, after he petitioned the court, to be released under the new law, after 16 years in prison. Semanchik said, \\"It just didn't make sense for him to be serving any more time‚Ä¶ I was really confident that Kenny was going to make it [after being released from prison].\\" His confidence stemmed in part from Corley's exemplary record as a prisoner. Semanchik supported the 2015 decision of the Los Angeles District Attorney's office to set up a team of veteran prosecutors to review the cases of incarcerated persons who present new evidence that they were wrongfully convicted. \\"The DA has a duty to re-examine these cases,\\" Semanchik said. \\"We always hoped they would. Hopefully, this will give [the California Innocence Project] a greater opportunity to make our cases to them.\\" Semanchik has stated in a video interview that one of his toughest personal challenges as a member of the California Innocence Project occurs when, following a review of the case of a person he believes was wrongfully convicted, he is forced to close that case because he knows that the evidence of innocence would not be considered sufficient by a judge to reverse the incarcerated person's conviction. Honors, presentations and publications Semanchik was one of 60 lawyers honored by California Lawyer magazine as one of its 2013 Attorneys of the Year. In 2014, he was chosen as one of San Diego's Top Attorneys, Criminal Division, by the San Diego Daily Transcript. He has made public presentations about the wrongfully convicted and the Innocence March at, among many other venues, the USC School of Social Work, the SDSU School of Public Affairs, the UCSD Community Law Project, Point Loma Nazarene University, the Greater Inland Empire Municipal Law Association and the Defense Investigators Association Conference. In an opinion piece published on the California Innocence Project website (representing his own views, rather than those of the organization), Semanchik argued strongly for prison reform, beginning with correcting America's \\"insane sentencing laws,\\" and establishing \\"adequate (and relevant) job training, actual jobs upon release, and reentry programs to help inmates stay out.\\" In another opinion piece on the CIP website, he noted that, though politicians often claim to be \\"tough on crime,\\" he believed that the criminal justice system would be improved if politicians and officials were \\"smart on crime\\" instead, because of the increasing costs of incarceration and the fact that \\"we don't have unlimited resources.\\" In the article, he mentioned 16 CIP clients whom he believes are factually innocent, including some who remained incarcerated despite having their convictions overturned by a judge. \\"If these inmates were to be released, it would save the state $720,000, annually,\\" Semanchik claimed. In a 2015 article in Riverside Lawyer magazine, Semanchik maintained that the legal evidentiary standard in California to reverse convictions was too high. He argued that that standard should be brought into line with those in other states, which have ruled that it is only necessary to prove that new evidence would probably have resulted in a different verdict if introduced at time of trial. Personal life Semanchik is a Pittsburgh native. In his youth, Mike achieved the rank of Eagle Scout with the Boy Scouts of America. After graduating from North Allegheny High School in 2003, he received a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (BSBA) degree from the A.J. Palumbo School of Business at Duquesne University in 2007, with a focus on economics and finance. He currently lives in San Diego with his wife and son.

World War II  For the duration of World War II, Teryokhin remained in the Far East, commanding the 2nd Red Banner Army, which guarded the Manchurian border. It also formed units that were sent to the front. In early August 1945, it was transferred to the 2nd Far Eastern Front. He led the army during the Soviet invasion of Manchuria, which began on 9 August. Forward detachments from the army crossed the Amur on 9 and 10 August, capturing three bridgeheads. On 11 August, the army began crossing the Amur with assistance from the Amur Military Flotilla, and attacked the Japanese fortifications on the opposite bank. It fought in heavy fighting for the fortified regions of Sakhalian, Aihun, and Sunwu. On 17 August the Japanese troops surrendered, and around 17,000 men of the Japanese 123rd Infantry Division were captured. In the surrender ceremony, Japanese Lieutenant General Kitazawa Teijiro handed over his samurai sword to Teryokhin. After breaking through, the army crossed the Lesser Khingan and advanced to Qiqihar, where it linked up with the Transbaikal Front on 21 August, surrounding the Japanese Fourth Army. For his leadership, Teryokhin was awarded the Order of Kutuzov, 1st class on 8 September 1945.  Postwar  Postwar, Teryokhin commanded the army until December 1945, then became commander of the 36th Guards Rifle Corps from July 1946 to 20 May 1948.

It has recently been relocated from its first Ferrarese site (Dosso di S. Agostino) to a new site located in a former Lamborghini factory in Argelato. In 1995, the first Ferruccio Lamborghini Museum was inaugurated next to the Lamborghini Calor plant, nestled in the Ferrara countryside birthplace of Ferruccio Lamborghini. After 19 years and thousands of visitors from all over the world, his son, Antonio (Tonino) Lamborghini, with the entrepreneurial spirit and avant-garde character that distinguishes his every project, decided to bring the Museum closer to the city of Bologna and to give more emphasis to the history of his father, genius of mechanics and Cavaliere del Lavoro, dedicating him a new exhibition space. It collects all the industrial productions of the Doctor of Engineering (Hon. Causa) Lamborghini, from the first Carioca tractor which started his company in 1947, to the sports cars of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. Ferruccio Lamborghini's personal collection in the museum includes the Miura SV, the Fiat Barchetta Sport, modified to participate in the 1948 Mille Miglia competition, the Countach, the Jarama models, the Urraco and the Espada.

History The Persqopi settlement can be dated to the second half of the 4th century BC. No ancient author mentions it by its Perqopi current name. It is thought to have been lived by the Illyrian tribe of the Parthini. The ancient city is on one side of the Vila Mountain, which is the last peak of the Krrab√´ mountain range. At 590 m over the level of sea, its strategic position facilitated the control of a large territory of the roads around the mountain. Its fortifying wall is one of the best preserved in the Albanian territory, and is 60 m long and 7 m high. There are 10 lines of stones. The entrance is 2.6 m large and is the only one that can still be seen today. There are two adjacent walls (an external and an internal one). The external wall is 2m thick and the internal one 1m thick. The connection of the two walls to one another is through perpendicular additional walls, built at a 5.6 ‚Äì 6.1 m distance from each another. The empty spaces created between the walls are filled with soil and stones of different dimensions, which creates an emplecton type of wall. Besides the ancient walls, in Persqop are conserved traces of multiple dwellings, as well as remains of an ancient tomb. In addition, there is an aqueduct, which provided water from the Vila Mountain. Preservation efforts Funding became available to the Albanian Fund for Development in 2011 for a feasibility study to build a road to the site, as well as to make the site an archaeological attraction, however until now neither project has been completed.

Biography Louise Adelborg was born in Ludgo, S√∂dermanland County, Sweden, a member of the noble Adelborg family. She was the daughter of Jacquette De Geer and Otto Ehrenfrid Adelborg, a Swedish Army captain. Her brother Fredrik became a diplomat, and her brother Gustaf-Otto became a writer. She graduated from the Technical School in Stockholm, following up with study trips to Italy and France. She began exhibiting ceramics and embroidery in 1916, and around the same time was tapped as a designer of patterns for the R√∂rstrand porcelain factory. She continued working for them until 1957, developing into a highly respected designer known for \\"an understated yet graceful modernism\\". Patterns she developed include Vase (1923) and the National Service (ca. 1930). National Service, later renamed Swedish Grace, features a wheat-ear motif and was exhibited at the Stockholm exhibition of 1930. Swedish Grace is still in production and considered an iconic design. She was also greatly interested in embroidery and textile art. She created a number of textiles with religious motifs for church use, including an antependium for the Riddarholm Church. She also designed patterns for fabrics from Almedahl-Dalsj√∂fors. Adelborg's work is held by the National Museum in Stockholm. She is buried at the northern cemetery outside of Stockholm.

The Dipylon Amphora (also known as Athens 804) is a large Ancient Greek painted vase, made around 750 BC, and now in the National Archaeological Museum, Athens. Painted amphorae of this size were made as grave markers. The intact clay pottery vessel was found at the Dipylon cemetery, near the Dipylon Gate, in Kerameikos, the ancient potters' quarter on the northwest side of the ancient city of Athens. It is one of around 50 examples attributed to an unknown artist given the notname of \\"the Dipylon Master\\", one of the earliest individually identifiable Greek artists. The amphora was made on a potter's wheel in three sections that were joined together to form a single large vessel, high. The base has a hole to allow libations to be poured for the dead, and it has small handles on the shoulders of the ovoid body. The outer surface of the amphora bears horizontal bands of painted decoration in the Late Geometric style, including single, double and triple meanders. The tall cylindrical neck, half the height of the body, includes friezes of repeated stylised deer and of goats. A rectangular panel between the handles on one side depicts a prothesis scene, the lying in repose of a draped dead woman on a bier, with a checkered shroud above the body, and stylised figures of male and female mourners to either side, each with lines for their arms raised to their blob head, a triangular torso, and hips and legs that are modelled, and swell abruptly from a wasp waist.

A topshop has three storeys. It is unusual in that the lower two floors are living accommodation, and that the top floor is a workshop containing a weaver's loom. The windows on the top floor are larger than those on the lower two, to let in more light. The idea of the topshop may have originated locally. Huguenot refugees from France had settled in Coventry and Bedworth. Some were silk weavers. They adopted the Jacquard loom, invented in France in 1804. Coventry and Bedworth became known for their ribbon weavers. That trade required close attention to detail; and therefore, in times before artificial lighting, the best possible use of daylight. The lower floors in a topshop had to be reinforced to support the weight of the loom. The idea was also taken up by local watchmakers. The best surviving example of topshops may be at Cash's former factory in Coventry - \\"Cash's Topshops\\". At that site, a beam engine supplied power by lineshaft to a community of topshop weavers. Other examples in Coventry may be found on Far Gosford Street. Some surviving topshops are listed buildings.

The caves are situated on the west side of Keshcorran Hill (part of the Bricklieve Mountains) and consist of sixteen simple chambers, some interconnecting. The caves have been used by man over several millennia, and it has long been suggested that they were the site of ancient religious practice or gathering such as Lughnasadh.MacNeill, M√°ire (1962), The Festival of Lughnasa Excavations carried out in the early 20th century, particularly those by Robert Francis Scharff, discovered significant animal remains. Among others, these included bones of brown bear, arctic lemming, Irish elk, and grey wolf.Dowd, Marion (2013), Dedicated to Sligo: 34 Essays on Sligo's Past, pp. 75‚Äì80. Geology The sixteen interconnecting caves of white cherty limestone are found at the base of a line of low cliffs, on the western slope of the hill.Aretz, Markus (2010), Rugose coral biostromes in the late Vis√©an (Mississippian) of NW Ireland They were formed from the atmospheric weathering of carboniferous limestone, and run perpendicular to the rock face. Quartz crystals are abundant, and glacial boulder-beds can be found at the mouth of some of the caves, showing that Keshcorran was at one time buried beneath an ice sheet.Scharff, Robert Francis (1903), The Exploration of the Caves of Kesh, County Sligo] The caves bear evidence of being washed out by water, and a layer of breccia containing limestone blocks can be found in many of them. Stalagmite floors are rare, and when present appear to have been burrowed into by foxes and badgers.Gwynn, Arthur Montague (1940), Report on a Further Exploration (1929) of the Caves of Keshcorran, Co. Sligo History of exploration The sixteen entrances to the Kesh Caves Praeger's 1903 plan of the caves The first thorough exploration of the caves at Keshcorran occurred during five weeks in 1901, and was initiated after a portion of a bear's skull had been discovered some years earlier. These excavations, headed by Robert Francis Scharff, R. J. Ussher, and Robert Lloyd Praeger, recovered bones of deer, ox, goat, pig, bear, horse, sheep, donkey, hare, mouse, rat, badger, fox, dog, wolf, and stoat. For the first time in Ireland, evidence of the Arctic lemming was also discovered, drawing headlines around the country. Another important recovery was that of a metacarpus of reindeer, discovered above an area of burnt charcoal. This suggests that reindeer in Ireland survived until the human period. Also recovered from the excavations were the four oldest species of molluscs found in Ireland at the time, the remains of several fish, and numerous species of bird, most notably the ptarmigan, smew, and little auk. Another recovery of note was that of several fossilised frog bones found in the lowest stratum, which disproved a common belief that the species had only been introduced in 1699. Finally, the excavations found evidence of occasional human habitation going as far back as the Neolithic, with more regular occupation being identified from the 10th century onward. Five human teeth and the humerus of a male were found in the caves, and man- made artefacts that were recovered include two bone needles, a bone comb, a stone celt, an iron saw, two bronze pins, and a stone axe of adze type. Shells of mussel and oyster were also found, further supporting human settlement. Further explorations took place in 1929 and 1930, and these led to the recovery of more bones of lemming, reindeer, mouse, pig, hare, horse, frog, rabbit, sheep, fox, stoat, bear, dog, ox, badger and rat. The excavations also discovered remains of elk, cat, shrew, and duck. In more recent times, some of the mammal bones recovered from these excavations have been re-analysed with radiocarbon dating, confirming a late-glacial estimate for the bones found in the lower layers. Those of the bear, deer, hare, and wolf were dated to around 10,000 BC, while those of the stoat and horse were dated to around 6000 BC and 400 BC respectively. The most recent discovery from the caves occurred in 1971, when a left tibia of an adult was recovered in a pool of water. It has subsequently been dated to the turn of the 11th century, coinciding with an entry in the Annals of the Four Masters for 1007 AD; : \\"Muireadhach, a distinguished bishop, son of the brother of Ainmire Bocht, was suffocated in a cave, in Gaileanga of Corann.\\" Folklore and mythology The Kesh Caves featured prominently in medieval myths and stories, with folk versions of these tales continuing in oral transmission until the 20th century. The caves are often presented as being associated with the otherworld, and as places to be respected and feared. Cath Maige Mucrama tells of the birth of Cormac mac Airt at the foot of Keshcorran. He is reputed to have been raised by a wolf in the caves, in a tale reminiscent of Romulus and Remus. The caves also feature in three stories about Fionn mac Cumhaill. The first, found in Duanaire Finn, relates a journey by Fionn to an otherworld smithy located inside the caves. The second tale, known as Bruidhean Cheise Corainn, tells of the warrior being captured and bound in the caves by the Tuatha D√© Danann. Another tale, the Death of Diarmuid in the Boar Hunt, mentions Diarmuid and Gr√°inne as taking refuge in the caves from a vengeful Fionn. A more modern tale regarding the caves of Keshcorran can be found in a 1779 diary of Gabriel Beranger; : \\"This cavern is said to communicate with that in the county of Roscommon ... called the Hellmouth door of Ireland [at Rathcroghan], of which is told (and believed in both counties) that a woman in the county of Roscommon having an unruly calf could never get him home unless driving him by holding him by the tail; that one day he tried to escape and dragged the woman, against her will into the Hellmouth door ... and continued running until next morning. She came out at Kishcorren [sic], to her own amazement and that of the neighbouring people. We believed it rather than try it.\\" Wilde, William (1880), The Memoirs of Gabriel Beranger, p. 48.

Sabina has been instrumental in the development of X-ray diffraction as a means of identifying minerals. She is credited with the discovery of a variety of different minerals and currently has one named in her honor: Sabinaite. a string of educational books and guides that focus on the study of numerous minerals throughout Canada, and has been important in the creation of a number of geological associations.  Life  Ann Phyllis Sabina was born in Lemberg, Saskatchewan on January 28, 1930. Sabina attended and graduated from the University of Manitoba with a Bachelor of Science degree in Geology in 1952. Later that same year, she was taken aboard the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) in Ottawa, and was hired as a specialist in X-ray diffraction analysis. During her more than 50-year career with the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) Sabina was instrumental in developing a catalog of diffraction spectra and representative specimens for many hundreds of minerals that would come to be used by researchers around the world. With geology budding into the limelight of the modern day masses, Sabina wrote guidebooks of the different minerals maintained along Canada's major highways and what geological attributes to expect when driving on them. In addition to her mineralogical work, Sabina was author of the popular \\"Rocks and Minerals for the Collector\\" and \\"Rock and Mineral Collecting in Canada\\" book series. These were intended as guides for the general public and were published by the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC), in both English and French, as part of the organization's report series. Ultimately, the two collections comprised 17 individual regional guides and have been credited with having \\"inspired many to-go rock, mineral and fossil hunting.\\" Ann retired in the late nineties but continued to work in the field of mineralogy up until August 2015. She later died on September 29, 2015, at the age of 86.  Discoveries  Sabinaite, a carbonate mineral named for Ann Sabina in 1980As part of her research, Sabina and a student assistant visited the Francon quarry located in Montreal on July 19, 1966 in order to study and contribute information for the Ontario to Lac St. Jean Quebec guidebook (GSC Paper 67-51). Women were not allowed to use the quarry due to security and insurance reasons, so Sabina took liberty and paid a young man working in the quarry 5 dollars and asked that he bring her samples. In her research, she noticed some small, yellow crystals in the retrieved samples and upon further testing she discovered that the mineral was not contained within her X-ray powder diffraction database; thus she had discovered an entirely new mineral. Sabina named this new mineral Weloganite, named after the founder of the GSC, Sir William Logan. The local news later reported the discovery but Sabina was not initially appropriately credited with the discovery. Ann continued to frequent the quarry for research and quickly discovered four more previously unknown minerals. By the end of her examination of the Fracon quarry, Ann Sabina was recognized for collecting 9 of 10 new mineral specimens by 1990: Weloganite, Dresserite, Hydrodresserite, Strontiodresserite, Sabinaite, Franconite, Doyleite, Hochelagaite, Montroyalite and Voggite. In 1980, the mineral Sabinaite, was named in her honor.  Awards  Sabina was the recipient of The International Centre for Diffraction Data (ICDD) award in 2016 and was nominated for the same award in 2002. In 1977, Sabina received the Queen's Silver Jubilee Medal, recognizing her actions in the scientific community. In 1994, she received the Leonard G. Berry Medal from the Mineralogical Association of Canada. The medal is awarded every year to a successful service to the Mineralogical Association of Canada in a selected role. Sabina was a treasurer at this society for more than 25 years. The Mineralogical Association of Canada also established the \\"Ann Sabina Award\\" in her honor. The Mineralogical Association of Canada decides on the greatest collection that is self-collected and displayed at the annual show competition, who receives this award. In 2009, Sabina was acknowledged for her excellent mineralogy contributions in Canada and received the ‚ÄúElsa and L√°szl√≥ Horv√°th Prize‚Äù award from the Club de min√©ralogie de Montr√©al.

It was built by Frederick Sehring in 1892 beside his brewery to house him and his family. Through the course of its life it has had many different occupants and purposes. It stands to this day at 310 Bridge Street, Joliet, Illinois.  Architecture  Sehring Castle was modelled after feudal Germanic architectural motifs. The German influence comes from Frederick Sehring's cultural roots. Built entirely from limestone found in the Joliet area, Sehring Castle also boasts a main tower turret to the left of its main entrance. Three other mini turrets are placed at each corner of the building. The balcony that hangs over the main entrance is supported by an arch that frames the main doors. Narrow windows wrap around the building in a uniform pattern. Tunnels are found running from one building to another on the property. These tunnels were used for storing the products of Fred Sehring Brewing Co. Recently, developers have excavated the foundation of Sehring Castle and found even more limestone that will benefit the restoration of the building.  Fred Sehring Brewing Co.  Frederick Sehring was born December 19, 1834, in Hesse-Darmstadt, Germany. His family relocated in the United States when he was 13. He began his own brewing company in 1883, after being a shareholder in the brewing firm of Joseph Braun & Co. He appointed his family the administrative positions so as to keep the business within the family. He built Sehring Castle beside his brewery, where he lived for 6 months before passing.  The University of St. Francis  Sehring Castle was repurposed as student housing in the 1940s to accommodate the influx of students attending the University of St. Francis. The Catholic university acquired three buildings on Bridge Street, one of them being Sehring Castle. The building accommodated 14 students and 2 sisters.  Diocese of Joliet  In 1963 the Sisters of St. Francis of Mary Immaculate offered Sehring Castle to the newly formed Diocese of Joliet. Bishop Martin D. McNamara moved into Sehring Castle during the process of his formal entry into the Diocese of Joliet as a bishop. Father Romeo Banchette shared the living space with Bishop McNamara until he became the second bishop of the Joliet Diocese. Afterwards Sehring Castle was used as an office space of the Chancery, and other Tribunal proceddings. In 2013 The Diocese of Joliet moved their Chancery and Tribunal to 425 Summit Street, Joliet, IL.  Future plans  The plans listed are subject to change until further notice. Sehring Property Holdings, referencing Fred Sehring, has acquired the building with plans to develop it into a winery. The group consists of Phillip Soto, Damon Zdunich, Doug Zdunich, and Frank Miloslavich. The company is in the process of rezoning properties so that they may begin renovations. They plan to have Sehring Castle function as the \\"tasting room\\", wherein the many rooms will be separated into different environments (i.e. bar, kitchen, office, etc.). The tunnels will function as the production site for wine, spirits, and whiskey.  References  Historic houses Joliet, Illinois ","title":"Sehring Castle"},{"id":"55467988","text":"Saul H.

Carter, also known as J. O. Carter and Joe Carter, was a legal advisor to Queen Lili ªuokalani, serving on her Privy Council of State. He served in the Provisional Government of Hawaii after the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii and was an opponent to annexation by the United States. Carter was trustee of many large estates in Hawaii and was one of the first directors of the Bishop Museum. During the reign of King KalƒÅkaua, Carter was Acting Commercial Agent for Japan and served two terms as representative in the Legislature of the Kingdom of Hawaii. He was president of C. Brewer & Co. in Honolulu.  Early life and family background  Carter was born December 20, 1835, in a grass house in Honolulu, the first of six children of Massachusetts sea captain Joseph Oliver Carter (1802‚Äì1850) and his wife Hannah Trufant Lord (1809‚Äì1898). Captain Carter was a trader of Chinese commodities to Hawaii and California, and was the first-generation Carter family immigrant in the Kingdom of Hawaii. Hannah Trufant Lord of Hallowell, Maine immigrated to Hawaii in 1832 and married Capt. Carter in 1833, spending the first few years of their married life accompanying him on his voyages. According to Territorial Governor of Hawaii George R. Carter, son of Joseph's brother Henry A. P. Carter (1837‚Äì1891), no one in the family was named Joseph Oliver Carter Sr., and the only Jr. was a grandson of the sea captain. Sons Henry and Samuel Morrill Carter (1838‚Äì1893) were also born in Honolulu. Son Alfred Wellington Carter (1840‚Äì1890) was born aboard the ship Caliope off the coast of Tahiti. Their two youngest children Frederick William Carter (1842‚Äì1860), and Catherine Rebecca Carter Lewers (1844‚Äì1924) were born in Honolulu. Governor Carter recalled being told by his uncle Joseph that after his birth in Honolulu, he and his mother Hannah accompanied Capt. Carter on a trip to Hong Kong where the young Joseph was baptized by a British sea captain. On November 28, 1859, he wed Mary Ladd, daughter of William Ladd who formed the sugar cane partnership Ladd & Co.. Mrs. Carter was a lady-in- waiting to Lili ªuokalani. The couple had six children.  Early career and politics  One of Carter's earliest jobs was as a journalist with the Pacific Commercial Advertiser. He was secretary of the local fire department and then elected as \\"Delegate to the Fire Department\\".; Carter was collector of special tax for roads and bridges, and eventually set up his own office as a tax collector. Shortly before the election of King KalƒÅkaua, Carter began to rise in the political arena. He served two terms with the House of Representatives in the Legislature of the Kingdom of Hawaii, for sessions April 30 ‚Äì July 29, 1872 and January 8 ‚Äì 20, 1873. During the 1874 Honolulu Courthouse riot provoked by the Legislative Assembly electing KalƒÅkaua over Queen Emma, former representative Carter sustained injuries when he became a target of mob harassment and violence while helping to rescue legislators. When he refused to leave the scene, the rioters carried him off. He was subsequently appointed as Commercial Agent for Japan on September 1880, succeeding J. D. Brewer, and served until the establishment of the Japanese Consulate in 1885 and appointment of Jiro Nakamura. Carter also served as registrar for public accounts. He began at C. Brewer & Co. in 1880 as treasurer and secretary, and worked his way up to being elected president and manager of the company.  Adviser to Lili ªuokalani and annexation  Carter managed Lili ªuokalani's personal real estate holdings and had been her friend and confidant for years before she ascended to the throne on January 29, 1891. When Lili ªuokalani became regent, Carter was appointed royal adviser on the Privy Council of State. At a June 23, 1892 ceremony at Iolani Palace when Japanese Consul-General Taigo Masaki bestowed Liliuokalani with the Grand Cross of the Imperial Japanese Order of the Crown, Carter was bestowed with Third Class Order of the Sacred Treasurer. Lili ªuokalani's proposed 1893 Constitution provoked protests, but Carter advised against her cabinet's suggestion of requesting American intervention to maintain civil order. He prepared a proclamation signed by the Queen and her cabinet that promulgation of a new constitution had been abandoned, but it was not enough to stave off the overthrow and installation of a provisional local government. Carter counseled her to resign under protest, and on January 17 she temporarily ceded her power to the United States. Following the overthrow, Carter was part of a group sent to Washington D. C. by the provisional government to plead its case for annexation. He was appointed by provisional president Sanford B. Dole to the Board of Health. President Grover Cleveland attempted a restoration of the monarchy, with the stipulation that Lili ªuokalani grant amnesty to everyone responsible. Over her demands of beheadings for all involved, Carter obtained her written assent to amnesty. Dole refused to re-instate the Queen, and the Republic of Hawaii was declared on July 4, 1894. Carter's standing in the business community suffered from his association with the Queen. According to Boston author Julius A. Palmer Jr., Carter's loyalty to her resulted in his being voted out of his position at C. Brewer & Co. The Queen was put on trial and under house arrest for her alleged part in the 1895 Robert Wilcox rebellion attempt to restore her to the throne. She was granted a full pardon in October 1896. When she left Hawaii for the United States in December, seeing her off at Honolulu Harbor were Carter, on whose arm she leaned as she walked up the gangplank, Robert Wilcox, and her former Minister of Foreign Affairs Samuel Parker. At an October 1897 gathering of 2,000 anti- annexationists, Carter was the main speaker. He traveled to Washington D. C. in January 1898 to lobby against annexation. Newspaper coverage alleged he made the trip at the request of sugar plantation owner Claus Spreckels. When Hawaii was annexed in 1898, the Crown Lands were seized by the United States government. Lili ªuokalani spent the next several years unsuccessfully lobbying the government for return of the Crown Lands, during which she relied on Carter for legal consultation. Trustee-estate manager business Toward the end of his life, Carter was handling all Lili ªuokalani's financial affairs. Carter was trustee and/or executor of the estates of several members of the Hawaiian nobility, including King Lunalilo. Most notably, the trusteeship that occupied much of Carter's final years was the Bernice P. Bishop estate. In addition to being one of the estate's trustees, he was one of the early directors of the Bishop Museum. Native Hawaiian politician John Adams Cummins, son of High Chiefess Kaumakaokane Papali ªai ªaina, made Carter trustee of his estate. He was one of the executors of the estate of James Campbell, husband of Abigail Kuaihelani Campbell who was a descendant of the Kalanikini line of Maui chieftains. At the time of his death, Campbell was one of the largest landholders in the Territory of Hawaii and left an estate estimated at $3,000,000. He was designated as trustee and/or estate manager of numerous non-nobility trusts, including that of his brother Henry A. P. Carter, and as a trustee of Central Union Church. Samuel C. Allen, Kauai businessman, developer and financial backer of Port Allen, Hawaii, left an estate in excess of $2,000,000 in 1903, naming Carter as one of his executors. Death Mary Carter died December 15, 1908, after an extended illness. Her obituary noted her close friendship with Lili ªuokalani. Joseph O. Carter died of pulmonary edema on February 27, 1909. His sister Catherine Rebecca Carter Lewers was his only surviving sibling. The Carters were survived by their children Joseph Jr., Henry, Charlotte, Mary, Rachel and Sara.

The long cast was displayed between 1905 and 2017 in the Natural History Museum in London, becoming an iconic representation of the museum. It began a national tour of British museums in February 2018. Background The genus Diplodocus was first described in 1878 by Othniel Charles Marsh. The fossilised skeleton from which Dippy was cast was discovered in Wyoming in 1898, and acquired by the Scottish-American industrialist Andrew Carnegie for his newly-founded Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh. The bones were soon recognised as a new species, and named Diplodocus carnegii. King Edward VII, then a keen trustee of the British Museum, saw a sketch of the bones at Carnegie's Scottish home, Skibo Castle, in 1902, and Carnegie agreed to donate a cast to the Natural History Museum as a gift. Carnegie paid ¬£2,000 for the casting in plaster of paris, copying the original fossil bones held by the Carnegie Museum (not mounted until 1907, as a new museum building was still being constructed to house it). Natural History Museum Unveiling ceremony at the Reptile Gallery of the Natural History Museum in 1905 1922 illustration, with trailing tail Early history The 292 cast pieces of the skeleton were sent to London in 36 crates, and the long exhibit was unveiled on 12 May 1905, to great public and media interest, with speeches from the museum director Professor Ray Lankester, Andrew Carnegie, Lord Avebury on behalf of the trustees, the director of the Carnegie Museum William Jacob Holland, and finally the geologist Sir Archibald Geikie. Reptile Gallery The cast was mounted in the museum's Reptile Gallery to the left of the main hall (now the gallery of Human Biology) as it was too large to display in the Fossil Reptile Gallery (to the right of the main hall; now the gallery of Creepy Crawlies). Carnegie paid to have additional casts made for display in many European capitals ‚Äì including Berlin, Paris, Vienna, Bologna, St Petersburg and Madrid; one sent to Munich was never erected ‚Äì as well as Mexico City and La Plata in Argentina, making Dippy the most-viewed dinosaur skeleton in the world. The cast in London quickly became an iconic representation of the museum, and has featured in many cartoons and other media, including the 1975 Disney comedy One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing. Dippy was taken to pieces and stored in the museum's basement during the Second World War to protect it from bomb damage, and reinstalled in the Reptile Gallery after the war. The original presentation of the cast was altered several times to reflect changes in scientific opinion on the animal's stance. The head and neck were originally posed in a downwards position, and were later moved to a more horizontal position in the 1960s. Move to Hintze Hall Dippy was removed from the Reptile Gallery in 1979 and repositioned as the centrepiece of the main central hall of the museum, later renamed the Hintze Hall in recognition of a large donation by Michael Hintze. Dippy replaced a mounted African elephant, nicknamed George, which had been on display as the central exhibit in the main hall since 1907, with various other animal specimens. The elephant had itself replaced the skeleton of a sperm whale which was the first significant exhibit in the hall and had been on display since at least 1895: earlier, the hall had been left largely empty. Dippy was originally displayed alongside a cast of a Triceratops skeleton, which was removed around 1993. The tail of the Diplodocus cast was also lifted to waft over the heads of visitors; originally it drooped to trail along the floor. After 112 years on display at the museum, the dinosaur replica was removed in early 2017 to be replaced by the skeleton of a young blue whale, long, dubbed \\"Hope\\", suspended from the ceiling. The whale had been stranded on sandbanks at the mouth of Wexford Harbour, Ireland in March 1891. Its skeleton was acquired by the museum and had been displayed in the Large Mammals Hall (originally the New Whale Hall) since 1934. Removal and tour The work involved in removing Dippy and replacing it with the whale skeleton was documented in a BBC Television special, Horizon: Dippy and the Whale, narrated by David Attenborough, which was first broadcast on BBC Two on 13 July 2017, the day before the whale skeleton was unveiled for public display. Dippy started a tour of British museums in February 2018, mounted on a new and more mobile armature.

The Perpetrators of this massacre were members of Dinara chetnik Division under the command of chetnik commander (vojvoda) Petar Baƒáoviƒá, Momƒçilo ƒêujiƒá and Mane Rokviƒá.  Background  By the end of September 1942, Yugoslav partisans in Dalmatia intensified their actions against the axis forces, which caused disturbance among Italian officers who were in charge of that region. Italian General Umberto Spigo, commander of the XVIIIth Army Corps was particularly frustrated with Independent State of Croatia's authorities because he considered that they are not cooperating sufficiently with the Italians and because they weren't able to obtain information about recent communist sabotages from the local Croatian population. Italians therefore devised plan of action against communist activities in area of Omi≈°. As additional reinforcements, some 150 chetniks were brought by Italian transport trucks. Around 6 am, on 1 October 1942, elements of chetnik forces started moving towards Dalmatian village of Gata.  The Massacre  Just before entering the village, chetniks met group of Croatian women who were carrying milk to Omi≈°. The women were killed by slitting their throats. Gata was then surrounded by the Italian and chetnik forces after which chetniks started massacring locals. Then nine year old boy Maksim spotted his cousin Ante who was running away covered in blood, with a knife sticking out of his throat. He then alarmed rest of his family which started escaping towards mount Mosor. Then 12 year old survivor Andrija Pivƒçeviƒá recalled witnessed events: > \\" I was in a group of twelve. I've seen with my own eyes how they killed > people. I saw them slaughtering Danica Milo≈°, her 10 year old son and how > they tossed her 1 year old daughter in the air and impaled her on a bayonet. > At first they shot me with a rifle in my buttock, then one chetnik > approached me and asked me if I prefer being finished by a bullet or a > knife. I was begging him not to kill me because I was my mom's only son. He > then started stabbing me with his knife. He stabbed me 9 times.\\" Pivƒçeviƒá survived the massacre by pretending to be dead and after the war, he testified on a trial of Dra≈æa Mihajloviƒá. After the mass killings were over, most of the village houses were set alight by the chetniks. The youngest victim of this carnage was nine months old baby, while the oldest was 87 year old woman.  Remembrance  On 70th anniversary of the massacre, commemoration was held. Among notable people present was the Croatian president Ivo Josipoviƒá. Elementary school in Gata is named \\"1st October 1942.\\" in remembrance of this event.

Currently it is on view at The Metropolitan Museum of Art Fifth Avenue in Gallery 300. When it was discovered, the interior cup of the chalice was initially considered to be the Holy Chalice, the cup used by Christ at the Last Supper. Recently, it has been concluded that it may have been a standing oil lamp and not a chalice.  Description  The Antioch chalice is a silver cup that is encased within an elaborate open-work gilded silver footed shell. It measures 19.6 x 18 x 15.2 cm with a 7.4 cm base. The body of the cup, originally ovoid, has been bent out of shape. When it was discovered, the chalice was covered in a heavy oxidation, which was cleaned off during the restoration process. Internal corrosion has rendered the interior cup extremely brittle. On the base of the chalice there are lotus petals, with a palm wreath above it on the bulb of the short stem. Surrounding the rim of the shell is a row of rosettes and one star. The bottom of the outer shell has an open lotus flower, and the upper areas of the outer shell contain a fruited grapevine wrought into twelve loops, each of the loops containing a figure. Two of the figures portrayed in the loops are images of Christ, one showing Christ holding a scroll and the other showing Christ sitting beside a lamb, above a spread-winged eagle perched on a basket of fruit. The other ten figures were initially thought to be ten of the apostles but they have been variably identified as classical age philosophers, who had foretold the coming of Christ. On the outer shell there are also snails, doves, a butterfly, a grasshopper, and a rabbit.  History  The Antioch chalice was found in Syria 1910 with several other items, including a large cross and three bookcovers. It was believed to have belonged to a church in Antioch, one of the five cities that led the early Christian church along with Rome, Constantinople, Jerusalem, and Alexandria. When it was discovered, the inner cup was thought to be the Holy Chalice, with the gilded, footed shell being added within the first century after the death of Christ to honor the grail. It was displayed as the Holy Grail at the Chicago World's Fair in 1933 and was later sold to The Cloisters in New York in 1950.  Recent events  Recently the Antioch chalice has been identified as having the shape of a standing lamp commonly used in churches in the first half of the sixth century. Potentially, it is decorated in recognition of Christ's words \\"I am the light of the world\\". It has also been determined recently that the Antioch chalice could have been a part of a larger group of silver objects that belonged to the Church of Saint Sergios in the small town of Kaper Koraon.

Biography Born at Ettingshall in Staffordshire (now part of Wolverhampton) on 23 November 1840, Waller was the eldest son of Stephen R. Waller, vicar of Ettingshall. His grandfather, the Rev. Harry Waller of Hall Bam, Beaconsfield, was descended from Edmund Waller, a seventeenth-century English poet. His mother was eldest daughter of the Rev. Charles Richard Cameron and Lucy Lyttelton Cameron, writer of religious tales for children, whose elder sister was Mary Martha Sherwood, an author. Educated at Bromsgrove School, he matriculated on 4 June 1859 at University College, Oxford, and held a scholarship there (1859‚Äì64). He took a first class in classics and a second in mathematical moderations in 1861, and a second in literae humaniores, and a third in mathematical finals in 1863, graduating B.A. in 1863; M.A. in 1867; B.D. and D.D. in 1891. He also won the Denyer and Johnson theological scholarship on its first award in 1866. Ordained deacon in 1864, and priest in 1865, he became curate of St. Jude, Mildmay Park, under William Pennefather. In 1865, on the recommendation of Canon A. M. W. Christopher of Oxford, he began his long service to the theological college, St. John's Hall, Highbury, as tutor under Dr. T. P. Boultbee. He served in addition as reader or curate on Sundays at Christ Church, Down Street (1865-9), and at Curzon Chapel, Mayfair, in 1869, under A. W. Thorold, and was minister of St. John's Chapel, Hampstead from 1870 to 1874. He became McNeile professor of biblical exegesis at St. John's Hall in 1882, and principal from 1884, on Boultbee's death, until his retirement on a pension in 1898. Of some 700 of his pupils at St. John's Hall, the majority entered the ministry of the Church of England. A pronounced evangelical, he acted as examining chaplain to Bishop J. C. Ryle. At Oxford he had come under the influence of John William Burgon, and through life his main interest lay in the conservative study and interpretation of the Scriptures, on which he wrote much. He married, at Heckington, Lincolnshire, on 22 July 1865, Anna Maria, daughter of the Rev. James Stubbs and together they had four sons (three in holy orders) and three daughters (one a C.M.S. missionary at Sigra, Benares). He died on 9 May 1910 at Little Coxwell, Faringdon, Berkshire, and was buried there.

At the 1993 World Rowing Championships in Raƒçice, Czech Republic, the lightweight men's eight won a bronze medal. At the 1994 World Rowing Championships in Indianapolis, USA, the Italian lightweight men's eight again won bronze. After it was announced that men's lightweight double sculls and men's lightweight coxless four would be Olympic boat classes at the 1996 Summer Olympics, many nations put their best sweep-oar rowers in their lightweight men's four for the 1995 World Rowing Championships in Tampere, Finland. Accordingly, Re changed to the lightweight men's four and his team won gold. As the reigning world champions, the Italian lightweight four disappointed at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, USA, and the team missed the A-final for an eventual eighth place. At the 1997 World Rowing Championships in Aiguebelette, France, the lightweight men's four came fourth. Re competed at two of the World Rowing Cups in 1998 before he retired.

There have been other methods for controlling web page layout methods, such as tables, the box model, and CSS flex box. CSS grid is currently not an official standard (it is a W3C Candidate Recommendation) although it has been adopted by most major browsers.  Motivation  CSS floats. CSS grid can create more asymmetrical layouts than the previous grid and layout options like CSS floats. It also allows for more standardized code that works across browsers. This is in contrast to relying on specific browser hacks or complicated workarounds. One issue with exploiting floats in CSS is that if content gets added to one portion of the page it could disrupt the flow of the page and break the layout. This is due to the varying heights for layout elements. Though CSS flex box supports flexible layouts and provides the flexibility of creating complex layouts, it fails when the need for creating responsive layouts in 2-dimensional space arises.  Browser support  As of October 2017, Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge all support CSS grid without vendor prefixes. IE 10 and 11 support CSS grid but with an outdated specification. On mobile, all modern browsers support CSS grid except for Opera Mini and UC Browser. Web developers targeting older browsers can utilize Modernizr 3.5.0 to detect and gracefully degrade the webpage as needed.  Utilization in frameworks  There are no current web frameworks that incorporate CSS grid in contrast with CSS flex box which is used in frameworks such as Bootstrap 4 and Foundation 6.  the fr unit  The \\"fr\\" unit is often used with CSS grid layout. \\"CSS Grid Layout: The Fr Unit\\". \\"Fractional.\\". \\"An Introduction to the \`fr\` CSS unit\\" The \\"fr\\" unit, part of the CSS grid layout specification, represents a fraction of the leftover space in the grid container. \\"Flexible Lengths: the 'fr' unit\\"  Examples  Here is an example of the holy grail layout: right The header The footer The left panel The main content area The right panel Here is an example of a table of values: A simple implementation of the CSS Grid layout demonstrating a table layout ### Header1 ### Header2 ### Header3 value11 value12 value13 value21 value22 value23 value31 value32 value33 value41 value42 value43 value51 value52 value53 value61 value62 value63 value71 value72 value73  References  External links *CSS Grid Layout Module Level 1 Cascading Style Sheets World Wide Web Consortium standards Web design ","title":"CSS grid layout"},{"id":"55469377","text":"Ben Clark is an American politician who has served in the North Carolina Senate from the 21st district since 2013.
