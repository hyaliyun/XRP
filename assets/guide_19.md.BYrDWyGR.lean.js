He was frequently described as a \\"principal chief\\", \\"head chief\\", or \\"sachem\\" by the Oneida but held no hereditary position and was not an officially condoled chief. Bread was a pragmatist who found ways to compromise between \\"promoting tribal sovereignty and treaty rights\\" and cooperating with federal and state officials. He played a major role in adapting the Iroquois Condolence Council ritual into a July 4 celebration that recognized the alliance of the Oneida with George Washington during the American Revolution. At age 14, Bread was part of the defense of Sackets Harbor during the Battle of Big Sandy Creek. Early life Daniel Bread was the son of Dinah Bread and an Oneida named Williams; however his biological father died. He was renamed after his stepfather, Daniel Bread. He had at least one sister. Little is known about Daniel Bread's early life, but historian Laurence Hauptman reports he spent time in the Oneida reservation's Presbyterian mission school founded by Samuel Kirkland, learning to read and write English, arithmetic, and the Christian catechism. Bread also likely learned a great deal from tales told by Oneida council leaders. He would also have had the opportunity to observe the spokesman for the First Christian party, Skenandoa, lose influence among the Oneida by signing away many of the Oneida lands over to the state in the 1780s and 1790s. Bread's tribe was subject to yellow fever, tuberculosis, and alcohol-related problems during his youth. Oneida resettlement to Wisconsin A Canadian clergyman of Mohawk descent, Eleazer Williams, became an Episcopalian missionary to the Oneida in 1817. Williams proposed that the Iroquois move from New York to Michigan Territory, and led delegations to Green Bay to negotiate treaties with the Menominee and Ho-Chunk (Winnebago) tribes that secured land along Duck Creek, Wisconsin and in the Fox River Valley at Little Chute. It was in this context that Daniel Bread worked to find consensus among a highly divided Oneida community and prevent the Oneidas from being moved again. Historians Laurence Hauptman and Gordon McLester credit him with being \\"the Indian most responsible for the overall administration of the move to Michigan Territory\\". In 1831, Bread and other Indians travelled to Washington to challenge reductions in Oneida lands brought by the 1827 Treaty of Butte Morts and the 1831 Treaty of Washington. There they met with Secretary of War Lewis Cass, former governor of Michigan Territory. Along with George B. Porter, governor of Michigan Territory, they met with President Andrew Jackson at the White House, where Bread explained the 1831 treaty's provision for the Oneida was not \\"sufficient in quality or quantity\\" for the tribe. Jackson accepted Bread's alternative proposal to exchange lands for other, \\"more fertile\\" lands in the southern part of Menominee Territory. In the 1830s, Bread continued his efforts to collaborate within his tribe and find compromises between tribal and federal agendas. In 1834, Oneida chief Jacob Cornelius arrived in the area with his followers (the Orchard Party) and became a political rival to Bread. Bread's party (the First Christian party) and the Orchard Party operated separately on the Oneida reservation, with their own chiefs, church, schools, and lacrosse teams, but the two men allied to argue for federal payments due from the Treaty of Canadaigua, Treaty of Buffalo Creek, and state relief funds from New York State. In 1836, the two men signed the Oneida Treaty of Washington which claimed separate treatment for the Oneida from the Menominee and granted the Oneida a distinct 65,420-acre tract. Principal chief Portrait of Bread from History of Brown County, Wisconsin, Vol. 1 Bread became principal chief of the Wisconsin Oneidas in 1832. He was an active member of the Hobart Church (Episcopal), serving as choir member and lay reader. He achieved financial success running a blacksmith shop, shoe shop, and merchandise store, and lived in a three-story house. Bread led the tribe to adapt the Iroquois Condolence Council ritual into an annual commemoration of Independence Day, to which Oneida chiefs invited guests from the white community. The day's events featured speeches by Oneida chiefs, lacrosse matches, social dancing, fireworks, and meals served by both the Methodist and Episcopal churches. The annual Oneida pow-wow is still celebrated on July 4 to this day. Critics Bread was criticized for being too friendly to the white man because of his support for missionary schools, acculturation, and for becoming a U.S. citizen. Some accused Bread of using political connections and power to benefit himself financially, taking payments from the government. Later life After the American Civil War, Bread helped Indian families apply for pensions, and aided widows and orphans. In 1867, he became guardian to a teenager, Sallie Anthony, whose father had died in military service. Chief Bread's leadership had largely collapsed by the fall of 1869. Historians Hauptman and McLester ascribe this to losing influence with federal Indian agents and with the Episcopal Church hierarchy in Wisconsin. According to the federal Indian agent W. R. Bourne, Bread had stopped attending church and \\"deserted his party\\". Bread's friend bishop Jackson Kemper died in 1870, and the Episcopal missionary Edward A. Goodnough had become more powerful in Oneida Nation politics. In 1865, Bread and First Christian Party Chief Adam Swamp had written to Washington asking for Goodnough's dismissal. Furthermore, Bread had renewed attempts to cooperate with Chief Jacob Cornelius and the Orchard party to protect the tribe's timber resources. Meanwhile, hereditary Oneida chief Cornelius Hill, who was allied with Goodnough, was growing in power. Bread died of \\"bilious fever\\" on July 23, 1873. His granddaughter, Laura Cornelius Kellogg, would go on to found the Society of American Indians and continue to advocate for the Oneida and Haudenosaunee people.

It was built 1807-10 and rebuilt in the 1880s.Hinde Street Methodist Church. Methodist Heritage. Retrieved 25 April 2015. A full account of the history of the church is to be found in Alan Brooks' West End Methodism: The Story of Hinde Street, Northway Publications 2010. History ;The First Chapel of 1810 Methodists had a presence in London's West End from the earliest days of the Methodist movement. A leased chapel in West Street (which can still be seen, just off Cambridge Circus) was used from 1743, and John and Charles Wesley themselves preached there. From 1761, or earlier, there was also a centre in Mayfair, the western geographical extremity of London at that time. From 1785 to 1801 a preaching room in Davies Street was leased, after which, with membership growing rapidly, the Society took over and rebuilt a nearby chapel in Chandler Street (now Weighhouse Street). In 1808 land close by in Marylebone was acquired to build an even larger chapel, on part of the site now occupied by the present Hinde Street building. It was then a swampy piece of ground by the Tyburn stream which ran down the present route of Marylebone Lane. The architect, Rev. William Jenkins, was one of Wesley‚Äôs itinerant preachers who combined preaching with chapel design. The chapel, opened in 1810, held around 900, had two galleries and acquired the nickname ‚ÄòThe Dutch Oven‚Äô because of its shape. Charles Wesley had lived nearby in Chesterfield Street, Marylebone (now Wheatley Street), and a son and daughter were members of class in the new chapel. Hinde Street's West End location attracted the foremost preachers in Methodism, and its pulpit gained a formidable reputation. Membership peaked at 1,100 in 1844 at a time of intense evangelism.Historic membership figures are found in Quarterly Meeting minutes and Schedules under Accession 594 in the City of Westminster Archives ;The Sunday School One of the church's principal areas of service to the local community was the Sunday School. Established when the first chapel was built in 1810, it was the first Sunday School in Marylebone and attracted 758 members by 1817, with some 500 children attending in the basement schoolroom on a typical Sunday. In its early days it provided invaluable instruction in reading and writing especially for the poorer children of the neighbourhood, prior to the provision of universal state education. ;The Present (1887) Chapel The old chapel was demolished and the present chapel, built to the designs of James Weir, a Wesleyan architect, opened on 29 September 1887.The Methodist Recorder, 6 October and 20 October 1887, has accounts of the opening ceremonies It has a classical frontage, a high spire and an interior that remains largely unaltered save for removal of the original downstairs pews. It is regarded as Weir‚Äôs finest building and is listed, Grade 2. The semi-circular gallery and high central pulpit are typical of Methodist preaching chapels of its time. The east window (1929) is by Francis Spear and the organ is basically the original 1864 instrument by Bishop and Sons, rebuilt in 1910 and 1983. Today the minister conducts the service from the lower dais to be closer to the congregation. To open up the entrance lobby and make it more visible from the street, a new entrance with glass doors was built in 2014 to replace the more constrictive original space. ;A Changing Congregation As the local population of the West End changed, families tended to move further out and the local neighbourhood was increasingly characterised by an often somewhat transient young adult population. In the twentieth century this became a defining feature of the Hinde Street constituency, and the church attracted large numbers of students and young people in the early stages of their working life. In 1945 the church became the focal point for the University of London Methodist Society, which peaked at around 700 members in the 1950s and existed for 50 years. The church retains many young adult members, some of whom live in two residential communities maintained by Hinde Street. ;The Church and the West London Mission Up to the 1970s the three great Methodist preaching centres in Central London were Central Hall Westminster, Kingsway Hall in Holborn (where Donald Soper was based as the superintendent of the West London Mission), and Hinde Street Church. In 1972 the lease of Kingsway Hall was sold and plans were made for the West London Mission to move to Hinde Street. A partial redevelopment of the Hinde Street site from 1980 (when the Kingsway congregation moved to Hinde Street) introduced new office accommodation for the Mission from which its extensive programme of social work could be run. The West London Mission now has its headquarters at 19 Thayer Street, linked to the Hinde Street chapel, and its social work programme continues actively today with projects in different parts of London, sustained by the worshipping community at Hinde Street. The church today The church provides three services of worship on Sundays (at 10am, 11am and 6.30pm). It adheres to an open, questioning and socially aware Christianity concerned with the perennial task: ‚Äòto serve the present age‚Äô, as once described by Charles Wesley.See Hinde Street Church website King's Cross church with its flourishing Chinese congregation, joined Hinde Street and the West London Mission in the Circuit in 2000. The church supports two Christian communities attached to it, and a programme of work with students and young adults. It runs a weekly drop-in for homeless people, a Winter Night Shelter, a social and study group and a lunch hour meditation, and is part of the West London Mission, running seven social work projects working with the homeless and marginalised. It became, in 2015, a member of the Inclusive Church movement. Its building is used during weekdays by 69 different 12-step groups, with around 800 people coming for support and spiritual guidance every week. Further reading *Brooks, Alan.

The Moriarty were a clan who inhabited the southern side of Tralee Bay in County Kerry led by Owen McDonnell O'Moriarty. The Moriarty's property stretched from Loch Lein to The Blasket Islands and they were direct descendants of the Eoghanacth. Moriartys were also closely related to the Earl of Desmond and also the O Donoghues and Ferriters. Following a series of defeats and a sustained campaign against his forces, the Earl of Desmond had gone into hiding in western Kerry. In November 1583 a raiding party of Desmond's men attacked a group of O'Moriartys, stealing their cattle and robbing women and children.Falls p.150 The O'Moriarty's sought permission from a local Royal commander Sir William Stanley to take revenge.Falls p.150-51 Accompanied by several government soldiers, a party of warriors led by Owen pursued Desmond into the Slieve Mish Mountains. They discovered the Earl sheltering without any guards in a cabin. O'Moriarty attempted to take Desmond prisoner, seizing him and arresting him in the name of the Queen and the Lord General Ormond. However fearing that some of Desmond's men were approaching, they cut off the Earl's head and abandoned the remainder of his body. The reward paid out for Desmond's head by the government was a thousand pounds. The descendants of Owen Moriarty still reside in Annascaul and many of the Moriarty families in Kerry today trace their ancestry to this branch, One branch still keeps an ancient chalice bearing the arms of Moriarty said to be made with silver given by Queen Elizabeth. In later times Timothy Moriarty and his son Timothy were hereditary Seneschals of Corca Guibhne or Barony Constables. Berleth p.203 References Bibliography * Berleth, Richard J.

The government wanted to urgently rebuild the province and using earlier, smaller plantations as a model intended to bring in settlers from England and other parts of Ireland. Peyton was charged with making a circuit of Munster, collecting evidence about lands which had recently been confiscated from local owners (largely Old English but with a significant minority of Gaelic Irish) and were at the disposal of the Crown to distribute to new owners.MacCarthy-Morrogh p.4-16 Due to the brief time available before settlers were due to begin arriving, the survey was conducted very hastily. This led to a series of errors which in turn caused complex disputes between different settlers and the existing inhabitants which dragged on for many years despite later revising investigations. A similar Bodley Survey took place in 1609 for the Plantation of Ulster. A more comprehensive Down Survey in the 1650s covered the whole of Ireland.

Although primarily a battle for local power amongst rival Gaelic factions it had wider ramifications. The defeat was a blow to the current Lord Lieutenant of Ireland Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex who had strongly supported Thomond and had led Crown troops into the area the previous year to install the Earl in power.Brady p.98 By contrast the Irish opponents of Sussex were known to be sympathetic to Sir Donnell and used his victory as evidence of Sussex's incompetence. In turn these two factions were allied with rival power groups at the English Court. Sussex was forced to dispatch a fresh expedition of Royal forces into the area in 1560 to protect Thomond. Eventually a compromise was reached in which Sir Donnell was granted a status independent of Thomond's overlordship which brought peace to the area.Brady p.99 References Bibliography * Brady, Ciaran.

Background √ì Briain was the son of Conchobhar mac Toirdhealbaig √ì Briain, King of Thomond and his wife, Anabella Burke. Domhnall's brother was Donough O'Brien, 2nd Earl of Thomond. Domhnall challenged the succession of his nephew Connor O'Brien, 3rd Earl of Thomond to the Lordship of the O'Brien clan.

He was unsuccessful in his attempts to be made an Earl, but he was given a knighthood as a sign of royal favour.

Capture British account On 9 May 1795 Strachan, in , was in command of a squadron that attacked and destroyed a French convoy in Cartaret Bay. The British squadron spotted a convoy of 13 vessels and immediately gave chase. Twelve of the quarry escaped and got close to the shore where a small shore battery, their own armed escorts, and a brig and a lugger offered some protection. Strachan sent in the boats from the vessels in his squadron while Melampus and the ships provided covering fire. The French crews abandoned their vessels at the approach of the British and eventually the shore battery also stopped firing. The cutting out party retrieved all the vessels, save a small sloop, which was hard ashore and which they burnt. Melampus had eight men wounded and in all the British lost one man killed and 14 wounded. They captured a gun brig and a gun lugger, each armed with three 18-pounder guns. They also captured the convoy, which consisted of: Prosperitte (80 tons and carrying cordage), Montagne (200 tons and carrying timber, lead and tin plates), Catharine (200 tons and carrying ship timber), Hyrondelle (220 tons and carrying ship timber and pitch), Contente (250 tons, carrying powder), Nymphe (120 tons carrying fire wood), Bonne-Union (150 tons), Fantazie (45 tons carrying coals), Alexandre (397 and carrying ship timber, cordage, hemp and cannon), and Petit Neptune (113 tons and carrying ship timber).

The convoy tried to reach Carteret, but was forced to take shelter at Surtainville, where there was a fort. The convoy reached the fort by 7:15. There her crew attempted to scuttle Crachefeu, but were only able to run her ashore. All the crew got ashore safely around 9:30, including her officers and her commander, M√©nage. They continued to resist from shore with small arms fire, but the British were able to retrieve all the vessels. Two Frenchmen, one a customs official and one a farmer, were killed assisting the guns of the fort, which amounted to three 24-pounders, one of which was dismounted during the action. Association Historique Surtainvillaise Edouard Denis-Dumont, - accessed 24 April 2015. Royal Navy The Navy commissioned Crachefeu (or Crache feu) in July 1795 under the command of Lieutenant Lewis Mortlock, who moved from . On 17 December Crachefeu came into Milford. She had carried away her rudder head and to get back into port the crew had to tie one of her sweeps to the after part of her rudder and use tackles to move it. On 12 April 1796 he sailed her to the Leeward Islands. Crachefeu sailed for the Leeward Islands on the same day as Eclair, and so possibly in company with her. Fate Some sources state that Crachefeu was broken up in 1797. On 16 April 1798, the newly promoted Commander Lewis Mortlock assumed command of ; he was killed in action on Wolverine on 3 January 1799. Crachefeu may not have been broken up in 1797, however. Admiralty records hold a letter dated 4 February 1802 that states that \\"The Crachefeu, formally a gun vessel which was used for many years about moorings and anchors in Martinique, has been frequently sunk and is riddled with worms. Rear Admiral Sir John Duckworth has given orders that she be destroyed.\\"ADM 354/203/335 Citations and references Citations References * Fonds Marine.

In 2001, his company Low Profile Group purchased UK shirt maker Hawes & Curtis, and in 2002 he purchased UK fashion label Ghost. Since then, he has invested in a number of start-up companies including Bikesoup and Huxley & Cox. Since 2015 he has been a dragon on Dragon's Den. In 2015, The Sunday Times listed Suleyman as 637th in its Rich List, estimating his fortune to be in excess of ¬£200 million.  Early life  Suleyman was born in Famagusta on 4 August 1953, into a Turkish Cypriot family. In 1958, he moved to England with his family and settled in Bermondsey, South London. He arrived not speaking English and attended Peckham Manor secondary school. At age 10, he suffered a serious hand infection that resulted in him missing a year of school and at risk of an amputation of his left hand. Suleyman helped out working at his family's restaurant in Camberwell. He credits his father for being his inspiration to start his own business.  Career  After graduating from school, Suleyman joined a chartered accountancy firm in Southampton Row, London, heeding to his father's wishes that he enter a secure profession. He worked as an articled clerk earning ¬£5.50 a week.https://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-07-12/meet-the-new-dragons-sarah- willingham-touker-suleyman-and-nick-jenkins/2/ Speaking of his experience there he states \\"I did the accounts for small clients like dentists and doctors, other accountants and small businesses. In a way it was educational, but quite boring. I saw that there were three ways to make money. You were either a pop star, in the fashion business, or in property.\\" While doing an audit for a clothing company, Suleyman took home some crimplene garments for his grandmother who later told him that her friends wanted the same. He purchased more which she then sold on his behalf for about a year. He describes this incident as his introduction to the fashion business. Suleyman went in to a partnership with the manufacturer operating out of a factory in East London before going on to form Kingsland Models which supplied clothing to the likes of C&A;, Dorothy Perkins and Top Shop. In the early 1980s, after being advised by a stockbrocker, Suleyman took a 29.9% stake in clothing business Mellins. He was later persuaded by Laing & Cruickshank that Mellins should buy a stake in retailer Bamber Stores \\"because it offered synergy‚Äîwe make it and we sell it.\\" After Suleyman asked accountants Coopers & Lybrand to do a review, they discovered that the business had falsified their records and was ¬£20‚Äì26 million in deficits. A board meeting was held the following Monday where Suleyman resigned, the company's shares were suspended, and receivers Cork Gully were called in. The collapse of Bamber Stores now forced Suleyman to find a way to raise money or see Mellins collapse too but he was unable to find investors. Suleyman was now stuck with debt and sold his house to repay money he owed to the bank.  Low Profile Group  In 1984, Suleyman acquired a small cash-and-carry business which subsequently became Low Profile Group, a clothing manufacturer supplying UK retail stores including Marks & Spencer. The company‚Äôs factories are based in Turkey, Bulgaria, and Georgia.  Hawes & Curtis  In 2001, Low Profile Group acquired Hawes & Curtis for ¬£1. The company was ¬£500,000 in debt and was about to go into administration. Turnover at Hawes & Curtis rose from ¬£600,000 in 2001 to ¬£30m in 2014, whilst Suleyman retained the Chairmanship of Hawes & Curtis. As of 2014, Hawes & Curtis operates from 30 branches in the UK and one in Cologne, Germany. In 2013, UAE investment group Korath Holding signed a $5m deal to open 26 Hawes & Curtis stores across the Gulf over a period of five years.  Ghost  In 2008, Suleyman purchased UK fashion label Ghost after its owner, KCAJ, an Icelandic investment fund, cut investment following the collapse of the Icelandic banking market. The acquisition safeguarded 142 jobs across the company. In 2009 the label announced its first collaboration with design duo Modernist.  Other investments  Alongside Ghost, Touker Suleyman has invested in Tru-Tension, an innovative motorcycle and cycling brand; Docks Rio, a casual boat shoe brand; Intelligent Futures, an online advertising start-up; Personify XP, an AI personalisation start-up; Huxley & Cox, a manufacturer of luxury handbags; and Bikesoup, an online marketplace for bicycles in which he invested ¬£100,000 for an undisclosed stake. Dragons' Den In 2015, Suleyman was chosen to join the investors' panel on the thirteenth series of BBC television programme Dragons' Den, alongside Nick Jenkins and Sarah Willingham. Suleyman is the only dragon out of the three to have remained on the show since.  Personal life  Suleyman lives in London and has two daughters.

The partnership was quite successful until Mendik divorced his wife in the late 1970s and the partnership ended. Mendik also cited disagreements over real estate strategies, with Mendik wanting to buy buildings while Silverstein wanted to build. They hired Jerry Speyer to assist in dividing the assets. Mendik then founded the Mendik Company. In 1982, he joined the Real Estate Board of New York and in 1992, he served as its chairman until his death.

About 1,400 of the 2,100 inhabitants of Friedenweiler live in R√∂tenbach.  Geography  R√∂tenbach (2004) R√∂tenbach lies about 7 km east of Titisee- Neustadt in the southeast of the Black Forest where it transitions to the Baar, at a height of 780 to 950 metres above sea level. The R√∂tenbach flows through the village from north to south and continues through the R√∂tenbach Gorge (R√∂tenbachschlucht) before emptying into the Wutach.  History  The church in R√∂tenbach The village was first mentioned under the name of Rotinbah on 19 January 819. The deed was preserved in St. Gallen. A local nobleman called Ruadger gave a gift to St Martin's Church in L√∂ffingen. Since 1563 the parish was in the sole ownership of the House of F√ºrstenberg. Previously there is evidence of ownership by the following ecclesiastical bodies: * The church in L√∂ffingen * Friedenweiler Abbey * Maria Abbey, Neudingen * Freiburg Charterhouse * St. Blaise Abbey Following the dissolution of the Principality of F√ºrstenberg, R√∂tenbach went in 1806 to the Grand Duchy of Baden. In the 18th and 19th centuries, R√∂tenbach was home to a cottage industry, mainly involved in the following activities: From 1770, clock and watchmaking expanded. For example, since 1782 R√∂tenbach families ran a clock business in London. In R√∂tenbach clockface painting (Uhrenschildermalerei) developed into verre √©glomis√© (Hinterglasmalerei). The Winterhalder family of artists were particularly famous for this, especially Benedikt Winterhalder, who was born on 20 March 1813. Luthiers worked in R√∂tenbach, presumably coming to the Black Forest from the Tyrol and Italy. Famous R√∂tenbacher violin makers were Franz Straub and Josef Bier.  Economy and infrastructure   Transport  The H√∂llental Railway (from Freiburg via Titisee to Donaueschingen) runs through the village. The section from Neustadt to Donaueschingen was built from 1898 to 1901. In the vicinity is the B 31 federal highway from Freiburg to Lindau.  Culture and sights  Rathaus  Structures  The village hall (Rathaus) was built in 1867 and serves today as the municipal hall for Friedenweiler.  People linked to the village  The father of Padre Rupert Mayer from R√∂tenbach. Padre Rupert Mayer was a priest in Munich who opposed Nazism and was imprisoned as a result. He died shortly after the end of the Second World War and was beatified by Pope John Paul II on 3 May 1987 in Munich.

A flip-flop, or latch, is a circuit that has two stable states and can be used to store state information. Motivation In most VLSI devices, maximum power dissipation is due to the clock network and clocked sequential elements. It can account to anywhere between 25% - 40% of the total power according to the variation of parameters like clock frequency, deeper pipelining etc. in a design. Sequential elements, latches and flip flops dissipate power when there is switching in their internal capacitance. This may happen with every clock transition/pulse into the sequential element. Sometimes the sequential elements need to change their state, but sometimes they retain their state and their output remains the same, before and after the clock pulse. This leads to unnecessary dissipation of power due to clock transition. If flip flops are designed in such a way that they are able to gate the clock with respective to their own internal data path, only to use the clock when needed, power dissipation can be brought down. Types Of Low Power Flip-Flops Techniques Conditional Clocking Flip Flop Techniques =Conditional Pre-charging Technique= Fig1.Conditional Pre-charge Technique This technique is used for controlling the internal node in the pre charging path in a sequential element. It has been seen to reduce the system power. Referring to Fig1, we can see that the D input is given to the first NMOS in the PDN network (CMOS). When this input is high, the output should be high too. The clk input to the PMOS will charge the output node to high when clk is low. If D input is already high, there is no need to charge the output to high again. Thus, if one can control this behaviour there can be a power reduction in the flop. To control the internal node in the precharge path, a control switch is used as shown in Fig 1. Only a transition that is going to change the state of the output is allowed. As one of the input to flops is the clock, considering the clock (Clock signal) is the element that makes the most transition in a system, a technique such as conditional precharging can significantly help reduce power. =Conditional Capture= This technique looks to prevent any necessary internal node transition by looking at the input and output and checking to see if there is at all a need to switch states. From Fig2, we can see there is a control signal that is applied to control the switching of the internal nodes. We can see the clock is supplied to two NMOS in series. The discharge path will not be complete till the control signal allows the last NMOS to be on. This control signal could be generated by a simple circuitry, with its inputs being the present output, input and the state of the clock (high or low). If the output of the flop is low, and high clock pulse is applied with the input being a low pulse, then there is no need to cause a state transition. The extra computation to sample the inputs cause an increase in setup time of the flop, this is a disadvantage of this technique. A further insight into this technique has been explained well in the journal \\"High-Performance and Low- Power Conditional Discharge Flip-Flop\\" by Tarek K. Darwish and Magdy A. Bayoumi. Fig2 Conditional Capture Technique Data Transition Look-Ahead Flip-Flop In Fig3, the circuit shows how data transition technique can be beneficial for power saving. The XNOR logical function is performed on the input of the D Flip-Flop and the output Q. When Q and D are equal, output of the logical XNOR will be zero thereby gating the internal clock and generating no internal clock. Referring to Fig3, we can see that the circuit can be broken down into 3 parts, namely data-transition look ahead, pulse generator, clock generator. The pulse generator output is given into the clock generator which is used to clock the D flip Flop. Based on the input and output signals, if there is a need to change the state of the D flop then the clock is allowed to switch to cause a transition else the clock is not allowed to transition. When the clock is not to make a transition, some time has been already spent in computing the logic and data from the D input may make it through the first stage of the D flop and some power is consumed. This power consumption is still less than what an ordinary flop would have consumed with a clock transition and no change in output. As it can be noticed the pulse generator is still generating pulse at every external clock edge. This too can be controlled and a technique that controls this part of the circuit is Clock On Demand. Fig3 Data Transition Look Ahead Technique Clock On Demand Flip Flop Fig4 shows the COD (Clock On Demand) technique. The clock generator and pulse generator are combined together in this implementation. The advantage of this is that there is reduction in areas and thus more energy efficiency. If the XNOR output is zero then the pulse generator will not generate any internal signal from derived by the external clock. If the output Q and input D do not match then the pulse generator will generate internal clock to aid state transition and change value of output. Fig4 Clock On Demand Technique References 6. V. G.

Saltveit's interest in wordplay goes back to his childhood, when he and his young brothers would discuss palindromes to stave off boredom during long family road trips. In his 20s, he began composing lengthy palindromes of his own. His first (\\"Resoled in Saratoga, riveting in a wide wale suit, I use law, Ed. I, wan, ignite virago, tar a snide loser.\\") is remarkable for its length, but took only a matter of hours to compose. In 1996, Saltveit founded The Palindromist, a biennial magazine devoted to palindromes and closely related forms of wordplay. On March 16, 2012, Saltveit won the first-ever World Palindrome Championship. The contest, held in Brooklyn before a live audience of 700, was organized by enigmatologist Will Shortz. Saltveit's winning entries beat out those of the six other contestants, including cartoonist Jon Agee and biostatistics professor John Connett. Saltveit is the subject of a documentary short, A Man, a Plan, a Palindrome, which premiered at the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament in 2015.

He was the first Bosnian-American who served as high- ranking official in the Government of either of the two Bosnia and Herzegovina entities, when he was appointed as Minister of Energy, Mining and Industry of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the first cabinet of Fadil Novaliƒá in 2015. His tenure as the Minister was shaped by his decision to send Financial Police to all state owned enterprises, especially those in the highly corrupt energy sector. Bajroviƒá resigned his position after the Federation BiH Government blocked his attempts to disrupt the patronage system and appoint independent experts to key management positions in state owned companies. In April 2016, Bajroviƒá created a new civically-oriented party called Civic Alliance. At October 2016 local elections, Civic Alliance won the mayorship in Bihaƒá and council seats in other parts of the country. Bajroviƒá resigned as the party president and supported the appointment of new leadership at the party congress in September 2017, citing the need for new faces in the country's political life. Previously, Bajroviƒá led the Emerging Democracies Institute, a think tank in Washington, DC. Also, Bajroviƒá was one of the architects of SDP BiH's election victory in 2010 as close advisor of Zlatko Lagumd≈æija. Bajroviƒá supports the American Democratic Party and publicly campaigned for Hillary Clinton in 2016.  Biography  Bajroviƒá escaped with his family from Sarajevo on 11 April 1992, in the early stages of the Bosnian war, as a refugee to his father's cousin in the Vraƒçar municipality of Belgrade, the capital of neighboring Republic of Serbia. He later mentioned that he came came to the United States as a refugee in 1994. Mr. Bajrovic had spent only 2 days in Belgrade, before he was forced to leave to Turkey (Istanbul) under pressure of Serb extremist, that have roamed streets of Belgrade at the time. He had been two years in Turkey, before leaving to the USA in 1994. He attended Seneca High School and the University of Louisville in Louisville, Kentucky. He completed an MA in European Integration at the University of Bologna in 2002. Father of Mr. Bajrovic, Remzija has stayed in Sarajevo from 1992 to 1994 performing complex operation on severely wounded citizens of Sarajevo as renowned medical professional (orthopaedist). He was remembered as one of the many \\"Heroes in white\\" deserving gratitude of the clinic and colleagues he was working with, as well as many citizens of Sarajevo. He has made numerous media and public appearances. He has participated in several briefings at the United States Congress related to the Western Balkans and testified before the Joint Committee on European Affairs of the Oireachtas, Ireland's National Parliament.

Keech was known for being the announcer for several popular old-time radio programs including The Eveready Hour, Bill and Betty, Popeye the Sailor and Terry and the Pirates. Keech was also known for remaking and redistributing the banjolele with his brother Austin Britton in 1917. Early life Kelvin Kirkwood Keech was born on June 28, 1895 in Honolulu, Republic of Hawaii to parents Alvin Welty Keech and Isabella Keech (n√©e Weir). He had an elder brother Alvin Danglada Keech (1890 - May 22, 1948) who was also an expert banjo player. Kelvin Keech went to and graduated from Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania before concluding his studies in Boston. Career The Keech Studios In 1915, the Keech brothers founded The Keech Studios which was located at 435 Powell Street in San Francisco, California. The studio was responsible for the signing of employees to the Hawaiian company Matson, Inc., organizing concerts in California, tours in the Midwest and even manufacture. World War I career and Europe Keech served in the United States Army Signal Corps during World War I. Keech was a radio engineer in France. Keech was wounded in action in September 1918 and while recovering at the American Hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France, Keech met Bill Henley and after Keech was discharged from the hospital, the two formed a jazz orchestra band entitled \\"The White Lyres\\". The group traveled throughout various parts of France and neighboring countries. In April 1919, Keech moved to Paris where he showed off his banjo playing skills. The White Lyres performed at the Savoy Dancing Club and had a two-month engagement at the London branch of the Ciro's nightclub from October‚ÄìDecember 1919. While in London in the 1920s, Keech befriended the at that time Prince of Wales Edward Windsor and even taught him to play the ukulele. The Banjolele In 1916, San Francisco resident John A. Bolander patented the first banjolele. The banjolele was a four-stringed musical instrument with a small banjo-type body and also had a fretted ukulele neck. In 1922 after Alvin joined Keech in Paris, the brothers distributed, made and sold several variations of what would become known as Keech Banjoleles. The instrument was very popular in Europe, specifically France, Italy and England, and even were sold in parts of Hawaii and Dallas. The Keech brothers along with their studios ceased manufacturing the banjoleles in 1939. The instrument itself has sharply declined in popularity however, several manufacturing companies in the United States that make the banjolele still exist. Radio Keech's career in radio began in the mid-1920s on 2LO, a syndicate of the British Broadcasting Company. Keech was a performer on various programs of the station. Keech could usually be found playing either the ukulele or the banjo when he performed on radio. He performed on 2LO for several years before he moved back to the United States in 1928. After announcing roles on several radio programs, he earned an audition for the NBC affiliate WEAF in New York. Despite numerous roles on the radio, Keech caught a case of mike fright. However, a second audition several weeks later earned Keech a spot on NBC's board of announcers. Keech was most noted for announcing The Eveready Hour, Bill and Betty, Popeye the Sailor and Terry and the Pirates all on NBC during the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s. Personal life In the historic city of Constantinople, Keech met his future wife Marie. Marie was born in Russiahttp://www.archives.com/1940-census/kelvin-keech-ny-54670994 in 1896 and did not understand a word of English and at the same time Keech did not know a word of Russian. The two fell in love and were married. The two had no children. Keech died on May 22, 1977 in Jackson Heights, Queens, New York at the age of 81. Keech is buried with his wife in Roslyn Cemetery in Roslyn, New York. Marie preceded Kelvin in death by 4 years.

History The hospital was designed by John Lamb Murray to accommodate 500 patients and opened as the Lanark District Asylum in 1895. The complex included staff-houses, gardens, a farm, a power-plant, a reservoir, a railway-line and a cemetery. Two large separate blocks were added in 1898, a tuberculosis sanatorium was completed in 1906 and a nurses' home was opened in 1931. Its first medical superintendent was Dr Campbell Clark. Its sister facility, the Hartwoodhill Hospital, which was designed by James Lochhead as a 'mental deficiency' hospital, was erected on the east side of Hartwood Road in 1935. However during the Second World War psychiatric patients from Bangour Village Hospital were evacuated there. The Scottish Union of Mental Patients was set up by mental patients at Hartwood Hospital in July 1971. At that time some 27 patients signed a petition to \\"redress of grievances and better conditions\\" at the hospital. After the introduction of Care in the Community in the early 1980s, the hospital went into a period of decline and closed in 1998. Although briefly used by Lanarkshire Television as a film studio, the Hartwood Hospital buildings subsequently fell into disuse. There were major fires in 2004 and 2016 leaving the building substantially damaged. Hartwoodhill Hospital, the sister facility, subsequently closed as well in February 2011.

A native of Westmoreland County, Virginia, she worked in Paris and Washington, D.C. before becoming, in 1924, a member of the Taos Society of Artists, the only woman ever elected to that body. Biography Critcher was the daughter of Judge John Critcher and Elizabeth \\"Lizzie\\" Thomasia Kennon (Whiting) Critcher; she was their fourth daughter and the youngest of their five children. She grew up on the family plantation, Audley, in Oak Grove, Virginia, and showed an early interest in equestrianism and painting. Critcher's first studies came at the Arlington Institute in Virginia. She then studied at Cooper Union in New York City for a year, with Eliphalet Frazer Andrews at the Corcoran School of Art in Washington, D.C., and also with Richard Emil Miller and Charles Hoffbauer. She soon began receiving commissions, producing a number of portraits of members of prominent Virginia families. In 1897 she was occupying studio space in the former Minor house in Alexandria, located on North Alfred Street. She traveled to Paris in 1904, remaining in that city for several years. Initially she enrolled at the Acad√©mie Julian, where she studied under Charles Hoffbauer and Jean-Paul Laurens; her time there was made difficult due to troubles with the French language. She founded the Cours Critcher in 1905 in an attempt to aid American artists in gaining admission to French schools, an enterprise in which she had the assistance of Miller and Hoffbauer. Mindful of her previous linguistic troubles, she designed a school where instruction was offered in English. To make extra money she acted as a tour guide for Americans visiting Europe during the summer months. Critcher exhibited at the Paris Salon during her time in the city, and served as president of the American Women Painters in Paris. In 1909 Critcher returned to the United States and began teaching at her alma mater, the Corcoran, where she remained on the faculty until 1919. In that year she founded another school, this time in Washington, called variously The School of Painting and Applied Arts or the Critcher School. There instructors offered one- and two-year courses in fine and commercial art, teaching a variety of styles and disciplines. She ran the school until 1940, when she decided to devote herself to painting full-time. In 1922 Critcher began teaching with sculptor Clara Hill. During the 1930s she ran the Red Rock Cove Art Camp on property which she rented near Saltville, Virginia. During the 1910s and 1920s she lived at The Woodley in Washington. Her studio was located on St. Matthew's Court; this is also given as the first address of her school, which later moved to a location along Connecticut Avenue. Among the institution's pupils was Sarah Blakeslee, whom Critcher encouraged to enroll in the Chester Springs branch of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts upon graduation from high school. Critcher was assisted in running the school by her sister Louisa Kennon Critcher, known as \\"Lulie\\", who was also an artist. Critcher paid her first visit to Taos, New Mexico in 1920, and would return for many summers. She was quite taken with the town, saying, \\"no place could be more conducive of work. There are models galore and no phones.\\" In 1924 the all-male Taos Society of Artists unanimously voted her in as a member, accepting the candidacy of E. Martin Hennings at the same meeting. The honor brought her great pleasure; she wrote to her friend, C. Powell Minnigerode, \\"You will be pleased, I know, to hear that a letter just rec‚Äôd from Mr. Couse informs me that I have been unanimously elected to active membership in the Taos Society of Artists. It is nice to be the first and only woman in it. I am feeling very good about it.\\" Unlike many members of the Taos Society, Critcher never lived in New Mexico permanently, choosing to summer there instead for several years; it was said of her that she would return to Washington \\"with a wrinkled, deeply suntanned skin in the 1920s when that was not fashionable\\". She traveled widely elsewhere as well in search of subjects, visiting the Laurentian Mountains of Canada and spending time in Mexico and in Gloucester, Massachusetts; she also passed several summers in Provincetown, Massachusetts, where she was a member of the local art association. In 1928 she spent two months on the Hopi Reservation in Arizona. In the 1940s and 1950s she lived in Charles Town, West Virginia, completing at least forty-two portraits during her residence there. Critcher's grave marker; note the misspelling on the stone. Critcher never married, although she was courted by a number of men including John Mosby. Late in her career, her health began to fail, and she moved to Norfolk, Virginia, to live with a niece. She died in a nursing home in Blackstone, Virginia; the place of her death is given in some references as Washington, D.C. Critcher's body was returned to Alexandria for burial; she was interred beside her parents and sister Louisa in the family plot at Ivy Hill Cemetery, where her name is misspelled as \\"Catherine\\" on her grave marker. Work Critcher's early academic style has been described as \\"dark but pleasing\\", but it later developed into something powerfully expressive, with a vivid sense of color; in this regard it was greatly similar to the work of other Taos Society painters. She has been called \\"a respected artist in the European avant-garde\\", with an interest in symbolism and abstraction; in this regard, some of her work prefigures that of Georgia O'Keeffe. Exhibits of her art were held in 1928, at the Women's University Club of Washington, D.C.; in 1938, at the Studio Guild of New York; in 1940 at the Corcoran Gallery of Art; and in 1949 at the Washington County Museum of Fine Arts in Hagerstown, Maryland. Her work appeared in various group exhibitions as well, including at such locations as the Albright Art Gallery, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts; the Maryland Institute, the National Academy of Design, and the Art Institute of Chicago; she also exhibited in the Greater Washington Independent Exhibition of 1935. Critcher was a member of numerous arts organizations, including the Southern States Art League, the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors, and the Washington Water Color Club. She was a founding member of the Arts Club of Washington, and from 1911 until 1931 served on the executive committee of the Society of Washington Artists, to which organization she had initially been elected in 1896, among the earliest women to achieve membership. Critcher received a handful of awards for her work, including a bronze medal from the Cooper Union and a gold medal from the Corcoran School, and an honorable mention at the Acad√©mie Julian. In 1914 she received a bronze medal from the Witte Museum; the same organization awarded her a silver medal in 1922, and an honorable mention in 1935. She also received three prizes from the Southern States Art League, including a first prize of $500 for her painting Taos Farmers in 1929; this painting was later included in the inaugural exhibition of the National Museum of Women in the Arts, American Women Artists 1830‚Äì1930, in 1987. Crichter painted a large number of portraits during her career, working in a traditional and realistic style. Two of these, those of James Leal Greenleaf and Oscar E. Berninghaus, are in the collection of the National Academy of Design. Princeton University owns her portrait of Woodrow Wilson. Other notables who sat for her over the years include Senator Harry F. Byrd and twenty generals, among them George Marshall and Mark W. Clark. In April, 1896 she presented for exhibition a portrait of her father at the Essex County Courthouse in Tappahannock; this was hanging in the Westmoreland County Courthouse in Montross in 1934. One of Critcher's Taos paintings ‚Äì Indian Women Making Pottery of c. 1924, donated by Adolph Gottlieb ‚Äì is in the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Her pieces may also be found in the collections of the San Antonio Art League, the New Mexico Museum of Art, the Museum of the Southwest, and the Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art. Her painting The Young Hunter is owned by the Taos Art Museum, while Portrait of Star Road is part of the Haub Family Collection of Western American Art at the Tacoma Art Museum. The artist herself donated an oil painting of Zinnias to Randolph-Macon Woman's College in 1926. A portrait of John Mosby dating to before 1901 is owned by the University of Virginia, while a portrait of Abraham Lincoln, dating to 1939 and based on a work by George Peter Alexander Healy, is held by the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library. Other paintings remain in private hands. In 1927 Critcher produced a copy of a portrait of George Wythe which she presented for display in the George Wythe House in Colonial Williamsburg.

It satirises the French Revolution through the story of a man who poses as a revolutionary in order to con a rich peasant out of a meal. The deception causes a brief panic before a nobleman steps in to expose the perpetrator, mete out justice and restore order. Goethe wrote the play in only three days and staged it at the Weimar Court Theatre, of which he was director. Synopsis Schnaps, the protagonist, is a rascally barber who poses as a revolutionary general using an outfit stolen from a dying French prisoner of war: a French National Guard uniform, a liberty cap, a tricolour cockade and a sabre. He pretends to be part of a conspiracy working towards an imminent revolution, in order to trick M√§rten, a wealthy but elderly peasant, into providing him with a free meal of bread and milk. M√§rten's son-in-law G√∂rge and wife R√∂se see through the imposture and attack Schnaps with a cudgel. The magistrate becomes involved and the household is suspected of involvement with the revolutionary Jacobins. However, the truth is eventually established by the local member of the landowning nobility. Schnaps is treated with mercy as the nobleman recognises that the barber poses no real danger to society, and the threat of revolution is defused. Background In January 1791, Goethe was appointed to the post of Director-General of the Court Theatre in Weimar.Boyle, p. 92 While in Weimar he wrote Der B√ºrgergeneral in only three days, between 23‚Äì26 April 1793, and it was first performed at the theatre only a few days later on 2 May. The play was a sequel to two earlier productions at the theatre, Die beiden Billets by French author Jean-Pierre Claris de Florian and its sequel Der Stammbaum by Christian Leberecht Heyne (using the pseudonym Anton Wall). Both plays had been sufficiently well-received to prompt Goethe to write another sequel which, although it references its predecessors, was intended to function as a stand-alone play. The actor Johann Christoph Beck had been a success in the role of Schnaps and returned to the same part in Der B√ºrgergeneral. After its Weimar premiere, it was also performed in Lauchst√§dt and Erfurt; by 1805 it had been performed fifteen times.Boyle, p. 93 Themes The play has been characterised by Anthony J. Niesz as \\"a sort of conservative propaganda play\\" in response to the French Revolution. As Patrick Fortmann puts it, the play aims > to ridicule the revolution, to show how utterly out of place it is in rural > Germany, how misleading its promises of liberty and equality, how self- > serving its enthusiasts, how amateurishly the cabals plotted in secret, and > how unnecessary the whole undertaking, if the social classes are willing to > cooperate and to meet each other half-way. Goethe sets out to ridicule the symbolism of the French Revolution ‚Äì the uniform, cockade, cap and sabre (all of which, in the 1793 Weimar production, were the genuine articles, having been brought back from France by Goethe as spoils of war) ‚Äì by having the peasant M√§rten critique them by the standards of contemporary German peasant dress. Neisz traces the play's heritage to the type of peasant satires popularised by Christian Weise and Hans Sachs. He notes that it \\"contains very little in the way of reflections on the nature of drama or literature\\" and avoids using theatrical terms. Goethe's assistant Anton Genast said that the play was viewed by the people as a \\"kleine Schlacht\\" (little battle) of Weimar against France. Goethe himself expressed the hope that it would have \\"some aesthetic value\\" and called it a \\"shibboleth to identify foolish or wicked unpatriots in Germany\\".Boyle, p. 149 Der B√ºrgergeneral is also notable for introducing one of Goethe's most notable themes in his subsequent plays: the virtues of marriage and married love \\"as a moral and poetic sign of contradiction to the corruption of the times\\", as Nicholas Boyle puts it. The peasant couple G√∂rge and R√∂se have been married for twelve weeks but are still madly in love with each other; while M√§rten broods over newspaper reports from France, his daughter and son-in-law plan their future together. Their love inspires the nobleman to marry his own sweetheart and to promise that their future children will play together.Boyle, p. 150 References External links * Original 1793 publication of Der B√ºrgergeneral * HTML copy of Der B√ºrgergeneral 1793 plays Plays by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe ","title":"Der B√ºrgergeneral"},{"id":"46520083","text":"Kirkham is a surname.

The origins of the name date back to the tales of the Viking, Orm, around the year 1050. Orm became famous during a particular raid on Scotland. Before the raiding party had left the Jarl had declared that the first man to set foot on Scottish soil would have first claim to the land. As the Vikings neared the Scottish coast, they were intercepted by the natives & a sea battle ensued. During the battle, Orm's leg was severed from his body. This did not stop him from fighting though, & as the days battle came to an end, the Vikings were victorious & made their way towards the coast. As his ship drew near the beach, Orm picked up his severed leg & hurled it at the beach. This signified he was the first man to set foot on Scotland & therefore earned the claim of the land.

Early life Stearns was born October 23, 1825, in Billerica, Massachusetts, the seventh generation of an old New England family which traced its ancestry back to Isaac Stearns, who settled in Watertown, Massachusetts from England in 1630. He attended Phillips Academy for two years, then worked as a shoemaker and as a clerk in a general store until he was 20 years old. Before long, Stearns moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, to join his brother George S. manufacturing cotton wadding, in the first such factory west of the Allegheny Mountains. Wandering years In 1850, Henry, feeling wanderlust, sold out his interest in the cotton wadding factory to his brother, and headed to California to join in the gold rush. He decided he would transport a steam boiler and machinery, with the intent to start a steam laundry in San Francisco. This required a land transport across the isthmus of Panama on the backs of men, then a sea voyage on an old whaling ship which sprang a leak, became disabled and set adrift. By the time the crew arrived in San Francisco four months later, the Stearns and the crew were near-starving. A doctor told Stearns he would not live. However, Stearns did recover. He set up the first steam laundry in California, became very successful, and then sold his share. He then moved on to operate a steam ferry boat named \\"Hector\\" between San Francisco and Oakland. He then moved on to the redwoods district and opened a steam sawmill. In 1853, Stearns returned to Cincinnati, then moved a few more times, including Buffalo, New York and then Sangamon County, Illinois. Rhode Island In 1861, Stearns moved to the state where he would remain the rest of his life: Rhode Island. There, he teamed with Pawtucket industrialist Darius Goff, manufacturing cotton wadding at the Union Wadding Company. Stearns became superintendent of the company in 1870, and president in 1891. Political life Stearns was a lifelong Republican. He represented Lincoln in both houses of the State Legislature; first from 1878 to 1881 and again from 1887 to 1888. He was Lieutenant Governor of Rhode Island from 1891 to 1892. Personal life Stearns married Kate Falconer of Hamilton, Ohio in 1856. Their children were: Deshler Falconer, George Russell, Walter Henry, Kate Russell, Justice Charles Falconer Stearns, Henry Foster, Anna Russell, who died in infancy, and Caroline. After 1862, the Stearns family lived in Central Falls, Rhode Island. His personal library was said to be among the finest in the state. Stearns was a Mason; a member of the Sons of the American Revolution; and a member of the Society of Colonial Wars. He was also a member of the Central Falls Congregational Church.

The conference was one of the first bi- partisan supported conferences that involved three presidential administrations, and more than three hundred national experts on the sexual exploitation of children, gangs, and trafficking of children. The 1993 conference focus was The Sexual Exploitation of Children: Creating an Investigative and Research Agenda for the 21st Century. The 1994 conference focus was \\"The Physical and Sexual Exploitation of Children: Evolving Strategies & Challenges to Research, Investigation and Prosecution\\". The conference founder and director was Randel (Randy) H. Skinner, a consultant to federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. Skinner continues his work in this arena in over forty states with a major emphasis in Georgia, California, Mississippi (historic civil rights cases) and Texas. The conference included noted speakers from the Reagan, Bush, and Clinton administrations, and nationally recognized scholars on child advocacy. The conferences were also instrumental in the advocacy of the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children Sex Offender Registration Act which passed in 1994. History In 1989, Skinner coordinated a group of fifteen concerned law enforcement agencies from across Georgia, who met to explore the connection between white supremacist groups and the increase in crimes against African American youth. They also explored the increase in aberrant religious belief systems tied to familial homicides and the use of Santeria and Palo Mayombe in drug trafficking cases. This collaborative work developed into an educational component used to train law enforcement agencies nationwide throughout the 1990s. Skinner, concerned about the amount of violence against children, notably the increase in inner-city gang violence across the nation; increase in trafficking of children and rise in the sexual exploitation of children, decided to bring together the leading authorities on prosecution, investigation, and public policy to combat crimes against children. This led to the formation of the 1993 and 1994 Conference on Crimes Against Children. In 1995, the focus turned to crimes against children across Mississippi and California, leading to work in both those states with national experts to increase the protection of Children. In Mississippi, Skinner traveled in 1996 ‚Äì 1999 over 100,000 miles expanding his work on historic civil rights cases whose murders were unsolved. Skinner worked with statewide groups on racial reconciliation and restoration calling for justice in unsolved cases. By 1999, over twelve civil rights murder cases were solved with convictions, led by courageous prosecutors. Speakers The conference speakers included United States Attorney General Ed Meese and nationally known advocate Miss America Marilyn Van Derber.

It could carry six passengers. Design and development Between 1919 and 1922 Caudron built a series of multi-engined civil passenger transport biplanes of similar design but increasing size and engine power, the C.33, C.37, C.39, C.43 and C.61. The C.37 was the first trimotor in this series. The C.37 was a three bay biplane with fabric-covered, rectangular-plan wings mounted without stagger. The lower wing had dihedral outboard of the engines, and the upper carried the ailerons, which were not balanced as they were on the later aircraft. The wings were joined by vertical pairs of interplane struts, the forward members attached near the leading edges, and the centre section was supported by similar, shorter cabane struts from the upper fuselage. Each inner bay was defined by two close pairs of leaning interplane struts, supporting an Le Rh√¥ne 9C nine-cylinder rotary engine about halfway between the wings. Each wing-mounted engine was in a long, tapered cowling, open at the rear. There was a third cowled Le Rh√¥ne in the nose. The airliner could fly on only two engines when carrying six passengers. Behind the engine the fuselage was flat-sided, with a wide, open cockpit with its windscreen immediately under the upper leading edge. With a useful load of the C.37 was capable of carrying six passengers, though it is not certain if windows or seats were fitted. Behind the wings the fuselage tapered gently to a broad, triangular fin which carried a vertical-edged rudder that reached down to the keel. The tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage so its elevators had a notch for rudder movement. The C.37 had a fixed tailskid undercarriage. There were pairs of main wheels mounted on single axles attached at their centre to a longitudinal bar held under the engine at each end on short, forward-raked V-struts. To prevent nose-overs, there was a fifth wheel mounted under the nose.

The crisis has indeed led regulators but also the academic world to ask new questions about the effectiveness of regulation policies. To answer these questions, the French laboratory of excellence on financial regulation (Labex ReFi) was established at the initiative of the Conservatoire national des arts et m√©tiers (CNAM), the Ecole Nationale d'Administration (ENA) and Pantheon-Sorbonne University and ESCP Europe (project leader) in the framework of the ‚ÄúGrand Emprunt‚Äù. Financed over 10 years, Labex ReFi will be evaluated by the National Research Agency (ANR). Purpose Governance LABEX ReFi is organized around a Scientific Council under the leadership of Prof. Christian de Boissieu, a Strategic Orientation Committee, chaired by Mr. Augustin de Romanet de Beaune, composed of regulators and professionals, as well as academic personalities and an Executive Committee, led by Dr. Raphael Douady and Mr. Fran√ßois-Gilles Le Theule, with representation from each partner institution. Labex ReFi is a research center dedicated to the evaluation of regulatory policies. It aims both to advance knowledge of the functioning of financial systems and their regulation, and secondly, to \\"advise\\" and \\"guide\\" the independent action of public authorities in the implementation of policies regulation by providing academic expertise. Labex ReFi is a multidisciplinary laboratory where specialists in economics, accounting, finance and management, financial mathematics and law, from several institutions, collaborate. All these disciplines are concerned with financial regulation but from different angles, with tools, language, incentives and evaluation systems of their own. One objective of the Labex ReFi is to bring together researchers from various backgrounds to produce this set of \\"useful\\" research for the implementation of regulatory policies. This is an important issue because regulation has often been characterized by \\"silo\\" logic. Each discipline works separately and develops its own doctrine, without fully understanding questions raised by the interaction with other disciplines, which sometimes leads to erroneous visions and consequently unwelcome decisions or with consequences opposite to the effect sought after.http://www.anc.gouv.fr/files/live/sites/anc/files/contributed/Articles%20et%20discours/2011/2011_11_17_Discours_LABEX.pdf  Missions  Labex ReFi activities articulate around three areas: research, valorization and education.  Research Projects  The research is organized into working groups driven by academic professors or researchers from partner institutions. Labex researchers are interested in major issues of financial regulation, such as asset allocation and evaluation, market (in)efficiency, history of financial crises, interaction with the economy real, financial information, credit rating agencies, banking and insurance regulation, regulating financial activities and capital markets, systemic risk, the valuation of long-term assets, etc. Calls for projects are launched every year since 2012. Doctoral fellowships and postdoctoral contracts are also awarded each year. Partner institutions (University of Paris I, ESCP Europe, CNAM, ENA, ENASS) also animate research seminars dedicated to the regulation.  Policy Papers Valuation  Valorization primarily happens through \\"policy papers\\",http://www.gaelgiraud.net/wp- content/uploads/2012/12/renationaliser-la-dette-policy-paper-REFI.pdf dealing with current regulatory topics and express academic views on these matters. Different types of events are organized, including breakfasts every two months putting together professionals, regulators and academics to discuss various topics. Since November 2011, breakfasts addressed questions related to assessing sovereign debts, the role of rating agencies and the separation of banking activities, market efficiency, the asset quality review, the content of risk reports, etc. Several conferences for large audiences were organized on main regulation themes including a major conference in June 2013 in collaboration with FEBS on \\"Financial Regulation and Systemic Risk\\", which brought together over 350 participants, as well as other events, e.g. \\"Rethinking the finance standards\\" (October 2011), \\"Shareholder activism\\" (January 2012), \\"4th edition of the European Days of control\\" (February 2012), \\"The new prudential standards: what effects banking sector, what effects on financial stability?\\" (March 2012), etc. Senior researchers from Labex ReFi author a monthly column in Revue Banque on topical subjects. A collective work \\"How Financial Regulation Can get Europe out of the Crisis\\" was published in 2014.  Development Program  Labex ReFi is also aimed at developing programs dedicated to financial regulation. A seminar entitled \\"5 lessons on regulation\\" organized in collaboration with the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH) bring together students from partner institutions in the context of lectures delivered by international lecturers. Other courses are provided involving professionals with extensive practical market or accounting information experience, collectively addressing students from all partner institutions and even from executive education. Ultimately, the aim is to create a \\"school of regulation\\" with European scope.

Objectives Secours Populaire Fran√ßais is a non-profit organization operating on donations and legacy funds, and is dedicated to fighting poverty and discrimination in France and the world. It aims to bring together people of all opinions, origins, and walks of life who wish to live in solidarity. In France, SPF is particularly focused on providing victims of discrimination with emergency shelter, food, clothing, and referrals to health care facilities. The organization also supports equal access to housing, health, vacations, cultural, sports and leisure activities, and job placement ‚Äî stressing that even in non-emergencies, equal access to services is a matter of personal dignity. Secours Populaire Fran√ßais also works globally, providing both emergency aid and ongoing development projects, working closely with expert associations capable of identifying local needs. These local partners provide long-term monitoring of program impact on local cultures. Secours Populaire Fran√ßais is partnered with numerous private and government associations in the French, European, and global spheres. History and Operations French Secours Populaire grew out of an earlier organization, the Secours Rouge International, founded in 1926 with the aim of providing a relief effort similar to the International Red Cross, with an emphasis on Communist and antifascist ideals. Communist intellectuals such as Henri Barbusse and Romain Rolland were associated with the organization. The SRI provided outreach to prisoners and deported persons. In 1936, the organization changed its name to Secours Populaire de France et des Colonies. The organization was dissolved in 1939 for the duration of the War in Europe, with half of the organization's officers either shot or dead from the pressures of forced deportation. The effort resumed in 1944 with the liberation of France, with relief operations primarily aimed at children and prisoners of war. The organization adopted its current name in 1945 and its remaining members had direct personal experience with the deportation camps, prisons, and vagaries of clandestine life in occupied France. Over the years Secours Populaire Fran√ßais has become pre-eminent among French organizations aligned against poverty and discrimination. Its work with children has led to its recognition by French national educational organizations. It continues to engage in charitable projects with strategic partners working to fight discrimination, child abuse, and anti-social behavior. The organization maintains a publication called Convergence for its charitable donors and fundraising partners. The organization has campaigned in France for laws requiring supermarkets to preserve their unsold food if it is deemed to be unsaleable before its expiration date ‚Äî for distribution to the poor and homeless ‚Äî and prohibiting stores from contaminating the food with chemicals such as bleach to render it unfit for human consumption. A petition circulated by the group garnered 179,000 signatures. An industry spokesman proposed collecting donations from customers as an alternative, and defended the practice of bleach treatment as necessary to prevent inevitable food poisoning in homeless people eating spoiled food. On April 21, 2015, the SPF staged an event for poor French children, providing admission for over 7,000 children to Park Asterix, an amusement park in Plailly, Oise, France, based on the popular comic-book character Asterix the Gaul.

In the first phase of the war, the Boer Republican Forces mounted pre-emptive strikes into British-held territories in Natal and the Cape of Good Hope, and besieged the British garrisons at Ladysmith in Natal and at Mafeking and Kimberley in the Cape of Good Hope. The siege of Kimberley began on 14 October 1899 and lasted four months, until the town was relieved on 15 February 1900. Official military recognition for the defence and relief of Kimberley took the form of two clasps to the Queen's South Africa Medal, the British campaign medal which was awarded to British and Colonial military personnel, civilians employed in official capacity and war correspondents, who served in the Second Boer War.The Queen's South Africa Medal 1899 - 1902 (Access date 13 March 2015) * \\"DEFENCE OF KIMBERLEY\\" - This clasp was awarded to all troops in the garrison of Kimberley between 14 October 1899 and 15 February 1900 inclusive.AngloBoerWar.com - Queen's South Africa Medal (Access date 13 March 2015) * \\"RELIEF OF KIMBERLEY\\" - This clasp was awarded to all troops in the relief column under Lieutenant General French who marched from Klipdrift on 15 February 1900, and all the 6th Division troops under Lieutenant General Thomas Kelly-Kenny who were within 7,000 yards of Klipdrift on 15 February 1900. Institution In addition to the military honours and to also honour non- military townsfolk who took part in the defence of the town during the siege, Mayor of Kimberley H.A. Oliver instituted the Kimberley Star in 1900. The medal was awarded to all men who were engaged in the defence of Kimberley as well as to members of the British Forces in the Kimberley Garrison. These included, amongst others, the Kimberley Town Guard, the Kimberley Regiment, the De Beers Maxim Battery, the Cape Police, the Loyal North Lancashire Regiment and the Diamond Fields Artillery.

During World War I he served in numerous public capacities, including as a labor strike negotiator and as director of the Massachusetts Committee on Public Safety. He was born in Dedham, and died of spinal meningitis at the Brooks Hospital in Brookline. He was born poor but died a multimillionaire, one of the richest men in the world, and was called \\"a typical Horatio Alger type.\\" The village of Endicott, New York was named for him. Personal life Henry Bradford Endicott was born in the family homestead in Dedham, the son of Augustus Bradford Endicott, a businessman and state and local official, and Sarah Fairbanks. He was a descendant of John Endecott, the first governor of Massachusetts, on his father's side and direct descendant of Jonathan Fairbanks on his mother's. He was graduated from Dedham High School after three years. He had two children, Henry Wendell and Gertrude Adele, with his first wife, Caroline Williams Russell, whom he married on May 23, 1876. They divorced in 1904. He remarried in Rye Beach, New Hampshire to fellow Dedhamite Louise Clapp Colburn, a widow with two children from her first marriage to Isaac Colburn (1853-1914), Samuel Clapp Colburn and Katherine Farwell Colburn. He adopted the Colburn children in 1916. Endicott liked to hunt and he enjoyed cigars. When about to smoke in the company of a close friend, it was characteristic of him that he would pull a cigar from his vest pocket, clinch it with his teeth and, taking another perfecto from his vest, he would vigorously thrust it into the mouth of his companion. Business career Endicott spent his boyhood on the farm of his father where his first venture into business was to sell the milk of the farm, the profits of which be divided with his mother. He then went to work for a short time in a plumber's shop, but lost his job because he went to the Massachusetts State Fair in Reading after his boss told him he would be fired if he did so. He was 22 when he went in business for himself. He had obtained work in the leather district and having acquired a little experience and a modest capital he launched the firm of H.B. Endicott & Co. The company, which dealt in sheepskins, was headquartered at 27 High Street in Boston, a few doors down from the offices of the later Endicott Johnson Corporation 10 High Street. He became treasurer of the Commonwealth Shoe & Leather Company, and it was through his connection with this firm that he entered the shoe manufacturing business. Endicott went to the factory of the Lestershire Boot & Shoe Company near Binghamton, New York, to investigate an order of leather his company had made from them. he was their principal creditor, and the company had fallen into financial difficulties in 1890. Recognizing the potential of the company, he bought it. Under his ownership, the renamed Lestershire Manufacturing Company grew to many times its original size. He sold half of the company to the company's foreman, George F. Johnson, but as Johnson did not have enough any money Endicott loaned him $150,000. Their company became the Endicott Johnson Corporation. He operated factories in New York and had tanneries in Maine and Massachusetts. He was one of the largest employers in the country but there was never a strike at any of his factories, and he did not hesitate to fraternize with his employees. He once stepped into the lunch room at a factory and, sitting beside a group of his employees, he ate a frugal meal which did not cost more than 15 cents. He chatted with the men at his side and spoke complimentary of the meal. During World War I he made a million dollars or more in profit. Endicott also served as director of the Chase National Bank of New York, the United Shoe Machinery Corporation, the State Street Trust Company, and of the United States Smelting and Refining Company. He joined the board of Shawmut Bank after the Third National Bank closed merged with it. In 1920 he called on workers to speed up production, but said that employers must make \\"the conditions under which the work is speeded up as bright, sunny, comfortable and attractive as possible in all ways.\\" When the US Government brought a suit against United Shoe pursuant to the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, it named Endicott as a defendant. One of the chief antagonists the case was his fellow Dedhamite, Louis Brandeis. Charities and public service Within 12 hours of the 1917 Halifax Explosion, Endicott organized and sent a relief train to help with the recovery. It was an accomplishment which testified to his remarkable executive ability and power as an organizer for the train left the North Station bearing a large force of doctors and nurses that was assembled in haste from all over the state, as well as supplies. He served as chairman of the Massachusetts-Halifax Relief Commission. He was also chairman of the Emergency Public Health Committee during the influenza epidemic of 1918. During this epidemic he rallied the forces of the state for combating the disease and it is estimated that the service of this committee saved 10,000 lives. He also regularly gave out free shoes to those in need. He showered gifts upon the little New York town in which his big shoe factory was located and has been generous in providing means for public improvement in his native town of Dedham. A few years before he died Endicott gave the New York town where his factory was located a $50,000 clubhouse. Every Christmas for many years he gave \\"a small sized fortune to the poor people of that town.\\" In 1919 it was for $10,000. World War I He was appointed by Governor Samuel W. McCall as food administrator and the executive manager of the Massachusetts Committee on Public Safety during World War I. His activities in these two posts kept him constantly in the public eye and it was through his interest in seeing that Massachusetts and New England kept its resources unremittingly behind the government in the prosecution of the war that he first entered the industrial field as an adjuster of disputes. As executive manager of the public safety committee he first directed a general inventory of the state s resources available to aid in the war. As food administrator he laid out a program of food conservation and regulation which was imitated throughout the nation. During this time he was a dollar-a-year man, taking only $1 in salary, and he tore up the lawn on the Sanderson Street side of his estate to grow potatoes and other vegetables in order to support the war effort and show the need for Victory Gardens. Endicott also took out $1 million in liberty bonds from his personal account, and an equal amount from his company's. When Endicott resigned from his war commission appointments, Governor McCall stated: > Let me say here that nothing could exceed the patriotism and efficiency of > the work you have rendered. I understand that from the time you were > appointed until yesterday, a period of 23 months, you have not once been to > your place of business. I know that you have devoted yourself wholly to the > patriotic work of rendering service to the country in the sore time through > which we have passed. Endicott himself said that > I am not a politician. I do not want any public office in this State or in > the nation. My sole object in doing the work I am engaged in is to render > the public such service as I am capable of--a duty I feel incumbent on every > citizen of this country in this crisis. I am enlisted for the war. All my > energies, all my time, my business experience, and knowledge of affairs I > willingly and gladly give the State and nation. I shall feel amply repaid if > I can convince myself that I have been able to contribute something in > behalf of the common cause in which the United States is engaged--the defeat > of Prussianism and autocracy and the triumph of democracy as we understand > it in America. In his war work Endicott never hesitated to cut red tape when by so doing he made the work of his department more efficient and brought speedier and more satisfactory results. He said \\"This is the way that private business is run. No private business could be run the way the government conducts its business. It would be in the hands of a receiver in no time.\\" Labor disputes Endicott enjoyed the confidence of both labor and capital, and he was called upon over and over again to adjust disputes which had engendered much bitter feeling on both sides. Endicott was also appointed by the governor as a strike mediator and settled over 100 strikes, including ones at the Boston and Maine railroad, the elevated Boston railroad companies, and in factories around New England. In a single year he settled disputes affecting over 100,000 workers. He said that when attempting to end a strike \\"The first principle is to give a square deal to both employer and employee.\\" When asked for a specific case, Endicott cited the Boston Elevated Railway strike, saying the carmen demanded 73 cents an hour and that the trustees were only willing to give 53 cents. After investigating the wages paid to the carmen in other large cities, he settled on 60 cents an hour, saying that it was only a fair wage when the importance of the men's work was considered. His reputation brought him appointment by President Woodrow Wilson as one of 15 public representatives at the National Labor Conference in Washington, D.C. in October 1919. He was disappointed with the results of the conference. Endicott Estate The Endicott Estate On January 12, 1904, Endicott's home burnt to the ground while he and his family were away. The fire department was not able to get to the estate in time as they were dealing with three other fires simultaneously, including one at the fire house, and deep snow. The fire was discovered around 10 p.m. by a caretaker who lived in the house. It took several hours to extinguish the flames. The house and furnishings were valued at more than $15,000. It is said that \\"Henry took the burning of the homestead as a divine command to rebuild, and rebuild he did, although not without incident.\\" He cleared the ashes away and built a new homestead on the parcel, today known as the Endicott Estate, and bought a new fire truck for the Town. The three story building he constructed has nine bathrooms, eight bedrooms, a library, a music room, a ballroom, a mirrored parlor, a butler's kitchen, a linen room, and servants' quarters. When a radiator burst during the construction, \\"causing a raging river to crash down the main stairway,\\" he tore down one end of the house and burned a pile of beautiful wall paneling, parquet floors, and elegant woodwork, much to the dismay of his neighbors. An additional 70 feet was then added onto the house. While he was building his mansion, his distant cousins were living in the Fairbanks House just away without electricity or indoor plumbing. When he died in 1920 he left the building to his wife, who in turn left it to her daughter Katherine in 1944. Katherine died in 1967 without any children and willed the land and the estate to the town for \\"public educational purposes, public recreational purposes, or other exclusively public purposes.\\" At the time \\"town didn't know quite what to do with it\\" and it was given to the Commonwealth to be used as a governor's mansion, but those plans were scuttled.Chapter 471 of the Acts of 1969 What was a nine car garage on the Mt. Vernon Street side of the property today serves as the Endicott branch of the Dedham Public Library. End of life Henry B. Endicott‚Äôs grave Death and funeral In January 1920, while on a hunting trip in North Carolina with other Boston men, which was meant to be a vacation from his public and business affairs, he came down with influenza. The frequent and intense headaches he suffered on the return trip caused him to take up residence at the Hotel Touraine rather than at his home in Dedham so to be closer to his doctors. He was taken to the hospital on February 10 where he was operated on, but remained delirious until his death on the 12th. His family was at his bedside. The funeral services were extremely simple, and took place in the home of Clarence W. Barron at 334 Beacon Street in Boston. A number of prominent men, including Harvard president A. Lawrence Lowell, served as pallbearers at his funeral, with Governors Calvin Coolidge and McCall serving as the head pallbearers. The funeral was led by James Hardy Ropes, dean of the Harvard University Extension School. He was buried in the Forest Hills Cemetery. McCall and Coolidge issued statements upon his death, with the former saying that he would \\"take rank with the great patriots of Massachusetts.\\" President Woodrow Wilson telegramed his condolence to Louise Endicott, saying \\"Permit me to express our heartfelt sympathy with you in your bereavement. Mr Endicott's disinterested and public spirited services have made the country his debtor. His loss is a real one.\\" The presidential message of sympathy was only one of scores from all parts of the United States. The Wall Street Journal ran an editorial praising him saying that it was rare to find someone so adept at both business and statesmanship. Legacy The two executors of his will each posted $18 million bonds, the largest ever in Norfolk County. The \\"shoe king's\\" estate was worth $11,674,976 in personal property and $92,500 in real estate, including $3.9 million in 'liberty bonds and $6.2 million in Endicott Johnson stock, large amounts of other stock and bonds, and $873,990 in cash. He left nearly the entire amount to his immediate family, with some friends and old servants receiving small bequests. His obituary ran in newspapers across the country. After news of his death reached the stock market, the stock price of the Endicott Johnson Corporation tumbled. In 1928, his estate received a tax refund of $546,599, one of the largest in the country. In 1921 Endicott's widow Louise gave $35,000 to the American Legion to build a clubhouse nearby the family Estate on Whiting Ave. His daughter Gertrude pre-deceased him.

It is not used frequently any more, since the introduction of belay devices. In the D√ºlfersitz, the rope is wound around the body, and the speed of descent is controlled using the friction of the rope against the body. The advantages of the D√ºlfersitz are that one can descend without a climbing harness or belay device, and because the rope is not kinked or subjected to concentrated forces, it does not experience as much wear. The major disadvantage of this method is that intense heat is generated by the friction on the shoulder, neck and thigh, which can be painful, and can damage clothing. Abseiling by means of the D√ºlfersitz (not free-hanging)  Abseiling by means of the D√ºlfersitz  *The doubled rope is passed between the legs *The rope is passed behind one thigh *Crossing the chest, the rope is taken to the opposite shoulder *From the shoulder, the rope is passed diagonally across the back to the braking hand (the hand on the same side as the thigh around which the rope has been passed) *The rope is placed under load *The free hand is held forward, maintaining the balance *The braking hand controls the movement of the rope: to allow the rope to move, the braking hand moves backwards; to arrest movement, it moves forwards. Although the D√ºlfersitz is an effective method of abseiling when practised correctly, it is less safe than some modern methods: if the braking hand releases the rope (due to panic, impact from a falling stone, or cramp), a fall is unavoidable if no additional means of security, such as prusik cords, is used.G√ºnter Sturm/Fritz Zintl: Alpin-Lehrplan 2, Felsklettern, BLV M√ºnchen, Bern, Wien 1979, , S. 64 f.

Roosevelt‚Äôs \\"brain trust\\" which developed and wrote legislation such as the Railway Labor Act of 1934. Biography Born in 1883, in Reval, Tsarist Russia (in an area later to become the nation of Estonia), William Morris Leiserson came to the United States at the age of seven with his mother and two brothers. As a student at the University of Wisconsin, he studied under Professor John R. Commons, whose life and work inspired Leiserson to pursue the fields of economics and labor relations. After graduation, he continued at Columbia University where he earned his Ph.D. under Henry Rogers Seager in 1911. Leiserson then began a distinguished career as a research scholar, professor and public administrator that was marked by four decades of high level service in an era of profound economic, political and cultural change. Shortly after receiving his Ph.D. he returned to Wisconsin where he originated the State Employment Service. Returning to academia, he held professorships at the University of Toledo and Antioch College.

This organization became the U.S. government's administrative arm for implementing the Railway Labor Act, which Leiserson was instrumental in writing for the U.S. Congress. The Act later was amended to include the airline industry. This, also seminal, legislation provided thorough, and effective procedures (carefully not requiring lawyers) for solving labor-management disputes among transportation workers and industries providing essential services to the U.S. economy. To this day the legislation provides a prototype for resolving disputes that involve essential services. Most of the foregoing positions were appointments by President Franklin D.

Domingo and Viernes were both shot on the afternoon of June 1, 1981 inside the Local 37 offices in Pioneer Square in downtown Seattle. Viernes died on the spot. Domingo, shot four times in the abdomen, managed to struggle to the street. The union hall was only a block from a fire station; two firefighters arrived within minutes, and Domingo managed to tell them the names of the killers, \\"Guloy and Ramil\\". Taken to Harborview Medical Center, Domingo underwent multiple operations, but died the next day. Pompeyo Benito Guloy and Jimmy Bulosan Ramil, both members of Local 37 and of the Tulisan gang, were found guilty of first degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. During the investigation, the murders were further linked to Fortunato ‚ÄúTony‚Äù Dictado, leader of the Tulisans. The murders were originally thought to be an isolated act of violence, but friends and family organized a Committee for Justice for Domingo and Viernes (CJDV) eventually found links between the murders to Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos and his wife Imelda, who had ordered the murders in retaliation for the victims‚Äô anti-Marcos organizing. In 1989, and a federal jury agreed with the CJDV, finding Marcos guilty of the murders. In 1991, former Local 37 president Constantine ‚ÄúTony‚Äù Baruso (1928-2008) ‚Äî a supporter of the Marcos regime ‚Äî was also found guilty of aggravated first-degree murder in the death of Viernes but not Domingo.  Legacy  In 2011, the Inlandboatmen's Union, Region 37, created an annual scholarship to honor the memory of Domingo and Viernes. The scholarship is available via the Harry Bridges Center for Labor Studies, University of Washington. Silme Domingo and his fellow Local 37 labor activist Gene Viernes were among the 14 Marcos Martial Law era martyrs to be honored at the Bantayog ng mga Bayani memorial wall on November 30, 2011. Since 1982, an annual event associated with the organization LELO - Legacy of Leadership, Equality and Organizing is held in Seattle to honor Silme Domingo and Gene Viernes and an award is presented to an organization or individual who exemplifies the values and principles of the two.

He died on April 25, 2015, of head injuries incurred in an avalanche at Mount Everest's South Base Camp triggered by the April 2015 Nepal earthquake.California Birth Index, 1905-1995. Accessed March 28, 2015. Early life Fredinburg grew up on a farm in Norfork, Arkansas, and left home at the age of 15 to attend the Arkansas School for Mathematics, Sciences, and the Arts in Hot Springs. He graduated from the University of California, Irvine in 2004, earned a master's degree in intelligent robotics from the University of Southern California, and completed other graduate coursework at Stanford University and the University of California, Berkeley. He began working for Google in 2007. Career Fredinburg was head of privacy at Google X,Google Exec Dies In Quake-Triggered Avalanche Sky News. 26 April 2015 an advisor on Project Loon, and the co-founder of The Laundry SF and Save the Ice. He launched Google Adventure Team, an effort to map geological areas and formations on Earth at a similar level of detail to Google Earth's street- level view of cities, towns, and other populated areas (including the Great Barrier Reef, the floors of the oceans, and high and/or remote mountains and mountain ranges, including the Himalayas). Fredinburg was co-inventor of more than a dozen software technologies that were patented by Google. Prior to working at Google, Fredinburg worked on future combat systems in the defense industry at Boeing. Expeditions Although non-disclosure agreements prevented Google from commenting on the \\"two or three different Google projects‚Äù related to Fredinburg's expedition work, at a minimum, he was one of four company employees documenting Mount Everest ascent routes for a Google Earth-type project. In a 2013 interview for Time magazine, Fredinburg explained the company's goal as \\"Different adventurers and people who want to explore from the comfort of their homes have the opportunity to explore and see these different corners of the world.\\" According to The Independent, Fredinburg's job title at the time was \\"Google 'I' adventurer\\", and the project goal was to offer the experience of climbing the world's highest mountains to people who, \\"lack the willingness to actually, like, climb a mountain.\\" On April 24, 2015, Fredinburg unrolled a banner on top of Kala Patthar, for the climate change cause SaveTheIce.org. Fredinburg, who had been on the mountain for three weeks and who had spoken of his narrow escape from the 2014 Mount Everest avalanche which killed 16 Nepalese guides, was one of four American citizens killed in the 2015 Mount Everest-South Base Camp disaster, following the 2015 Nepal earthquake. Five Sherpas carried Fredinburg's body down the mountain, to a U.S. Army Special Forces helicopter evacuating climbers several days after the avalanche. Although he had not yet reached the summit of Everest, the highest peak in Asia (and the world), Fredinburg had topped four of the Seven Summits using the same pair of hiking boots, including Mount Elbrus in Europe, Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa, and Aconcagua in South America, all three of which he had photographed for Google. Fredinburg likened Aconcagua to a \\"gates of hell\\" experience, telling Time there were mule skeletons sticking up out of the ground. Fredinburg also climbed the difficult and relatively inaccessible Puncak Jaya (Carstensz Pyramid), the highest peak in Oceania, and was briefly jailed after descending into the nearby Grasberg mine. Social causes In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, Fredinburg organized a relief effort in New York City, Staten Island, with the aim to support victims of the storm who became homeless. A 2014 SaveTheIce.org project in the Baltic states was featured in the Discovery Digital Networks production In the Making. Fredinburg founded The Laundry, a San Francisco-based business incubator geared towards building a community and productive environment for social impact. Personal life Fredinburg dated actress Sophia Bush from 2013 to 2014. The two remained close friends after breaking up. Upon learning of Fredinburg's death, Bush stated, \\"There are no adequate words. Dan Fredinburg was one-of-a-kind. Fearless. Funny.

Biography  Tamako Kataoka was born in Sapporo, Japan in 1905. In 1923, she enrolled to study the traditional Japanese painting style Nihonga at the Women‚Äôs Special School of Art in Tokyo. She decided to further her studies and acquired a teaching post at Ooka state primary school in Yokohama for the next thirty years, and at the Women‚Äôs University of Fine Art for another fifteen. In 1962, Kataoka traveled to Europe, visiting France, Italy, and the UK. It was during this forty-day excursion that the western influence in her work stemmed. Art critic Sarah Custen describes Kataoka's unique response to the influence of popular American artists: \\"Kataoka‚Äôs landscapes evoke Georgia O‚ÄôKeeffe, and her ‚ÄòCountenance‚Äô series is undeniably reminiscent of Warhol‚Äôs pop art, yet her work is far from imitative. While much of Japanese art is dedicated to faithful replication, Kataoka‚Äôs paintings sing as true, individual expression.\\" For example, Kataoka often uses gold leaf and silver to highlight portions of her prints, a technique seen in many Nihonga paintings before her. ‚ÄúBy painting a picture of a traditional scene‚Ä¶one can participate in a process of defining what a tradition is.‚ÄùWeston, Japanese Painting and National Identity, 17. By the mid sixties, she became the department head of the Aichi Prefectural University of the Arts. It was here that she taught students who were eager to modernize the style of traditional Japanese art. After seeing her work, a fellow artist by the name of Kobayashi Kokei recognized the greatness in it. He exclaimed that her work straddled ‚Äúthe line between being inferior and an authentic masterpiece‚Äù and encouraged her to continue.

He was Senior Vice President of Trading and Strategic Initiatives at TD Ameritrade. Sosnoff promotes option trading as an important financial strategy for the individual investor. He has promoted this view by founding an online financial network, tastytrade, and by developing software products to support individual investor options trading. Early life and education Sosnoff, a native New Yorker, got his first job as a caddie at the age of 13. In 1979, Sosnoff received a BA degree in political science from University at Albany, SUNY and immediately began working for Drexel Burnham Lambert. Career Starting in the early 1980s, Sosnoff, through the Sosnoff Sheridan Group, was a lead market maker at the Chicago Board Options Exchange. By 1999, Sosnoff believed that option trading would largely move online and that individual investors would become interested in trading options if they had the software tools to do so. This led to his co-founding of Thinkorswim in 1999. In 2009, Thinkorswim was sold to TD Ameritrade for approximately $606 million and Sosnoff personally received $84 million. In 2011, Sosnoff announced that $20 million in venture capital had been raised to support his idea for a financial network called tastytrade. His aim in founding tastytrade was to create a financial news show focusing on options, which mixes content with comedy somewhat like the \\"Daily Show\\". In 2014, a Silicon Valley venture fund, Technology Crossover Ventures, invested $25 million into Dough Inc., also founded by Sosnoff, which includes tastytrade. In 2014, Sosnoff was co-winner of the EY Entrepreneur of the Year Midwest Award. Options trading Sosnoff advocates options trading as a viable long-term financial strategy for individual investors. He argues against financial experts who claim that options trading is too risky for individual investors. According to Sosnoff, the use of call options and put options can reduce the risk of owning stocks, and options trading is a portfolio management strategy that is well-suited for the individual investor. He devotes considerable time on his financial network, tastytrade, and in seminars demonstrating the mechanics and strategies of options trading. According to Sosnoff, the two main keys to successful options trading are the market liquidity of options and understanding volatility and, in particular, implied volatility and implied volatility rank. Options trading can be successful in liquid underlyings, when volatility is properly assessed, and options strategies appropriate to an individual investor's risk and financial resources are used. For example, for an investor with a sufficiently large margin account, with stocks with liquid options and high implied volatility rank, selling a straddle or strangle might be a viable strategy. Similarly, for an investor with a smaller margin account, selling an iron condor or iron butterfly (iron fly) might be more appropriate. When implied volatility is low, a calendar spread might be a better option. Sosnoff argues that, while liquidity, implied volatility, and implied volatility rank are crucial to successful options trading, there are other key elements. It is important to trade small, by which he means that individual investors should invest only a small percentage of their portfolio in any given stock, options, or futures position (e.g., selling only one or a few option contracts). By investing in many small positions, losses can be minimized, as long as positions are uncorrelated. While liquidity, understanding volatility, trading small in uncorrelated positions, market awareness, and delta neutral portfolios are essential for successful trading, according to Sosnoff, trading mechanics are also essential. Trading mechanics are heuristics that an option trader learns when applying option strategies. For example, rules of thumb for when to roll call and put option contracts as a function of time to expiration and moneyness of a position are examples of trading mechanics (heuristics). In Sosnoff's view, the introduction of electronic trading platforms created new investment opportunities for individual investors, but the software tools required to take full advantage of online trading are lacking. He views the continued development of options trading software as critical for individual investor success. For individual investors to be successful, they need graphical user interfaces that instantly bring together relevant information so that investors can use the best strategies and mechanics for options trading. To this end, Sosnoff has devoted considerable effort to the development of software platforms for the individual options investor.

Spoofers feign interest in trading futures, stocks and other products in financial markets creating an illusion of the demand and supply of the traded asset. In an order driven market, spoofers post a relatively large number of limit orders on one side of the limit order book to make other market participants believe that there is pressure to sell (limit orders are posted on the offer side of the book) or to buy (limit orders are posted on the bid side of the book) the asset. Spoofing may cause prices to change because the market interprets the one-sided pressure in the limit order book as a shift in the balance of the number of investors who wish to purchase or sell the asset, which causes prices to increase (more buyers than sellers) or prices to decline (more sellers than buyers)Cartea, Jaimungal, Wang \\"Spoofing and Price Manipulation in Order Driven Markets\\" SSRN (spoofing in electronic markets) Spoofers bid or offer with intent to cancel before the orders are filled. The flurry of activity around the buy or sell orders is intended to attract other traders to induce a particular market reaction. Spoofing can be a factor in the rise and fall of the price of shares and can be very profitable to the spoofer who can time buying and selling based on this manipulation. Under the 2010 Dodd‚ÄìFrank Act spoofing is defined as \\"the illegal practice of bidding or offering with intent to cancel before execution.\\" Spoofing can be used with layering algorithms and front-running, activities which are also illegal.

The CME was described as being in a \\"massively conflicted\\" position as they make huge profits from the HFT and algorithmic trading. Definition In Australia layering and spoofing in 2014 referred to the act of \\"submitting a genuine order on one side of the book and multiple orders at different prices on the other side of the book to give the impression of substantial supply/demand, with a view to sucking in other orders to hit the genuine order. After the genuine order trades, the multiple orders on the other side are rapidly withdrawn.\\" In a 2012 report Finansinspektionen (FI), the Swedish Financial Supervisory AuthorityWho we are defined spoofing/layering as \\"a strategy of placing orders that is intended to manipulate the price of an instrument, for example through a combination of buy and sell orders.\\" In the U.S. Department of Justice April 21, 2015 complaint of market manipulation and fraud laid against Navinder Singh Sarao, ‚Äî dubbed the Hounslow day-trader ‚Äî appeared \\"to have used this 188-and-289-lot spoofing technique in certain instances to intensify the manipulative effects of his dynamic layering technique...The purpose of these bogus orders is to trick other market participants and manipulate the product's market price.\\" He employed the technique of dynamic layering, a form of market manipulation in which traders \\"place large sell orders for contracts\\" tied to the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. Sarao used his customized computer-trading program from 2009 onwards. Milestone case against spoofing In July 2013 the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) brought a milestone case against spoofing which represents the first Dodd-Frank Act application. A federal grand jury in Chicago indicted Panther Energy Trading and Michael Coscia, a high-frequency trader. In 2011 Coscia placed spoofed orders through CME Group Inc. and European futures markets with profits of almost $1.6 million. Coscia was charged with six counts of spoofing with each count carrying a maximum sentence of ten years in prison and a maximum fine of one million dollars. The illegal activity undertaken by Coscia and his firm took place in a six-week period from \\"August 8, 2011 through October 18, 2011 on CME Group‚Äôs Globex trading platform.\\" They used a \\"computer algorithm that was designed to unlawfully place and quickly cancel orders in exchange-traded futures contracts.\\" They placed a \\"relatively small order to sell futures that they did want to execute, which they quickly followed with several large buy orders at successively higher prices that they intended to cancel. By placing the large buy orders, Mr. Coscia and Panther sought to give the market the impression that there was significant buying interest, which suggested that prices would soon rise, raising the likelihood that other market participants would buy from the small order Coscia and Panther were then offering to sell.\\" Britain's FCA is also fining Coscia and his firm approximately $900,000 for \\"taking advantage of the price movements generated by his layering strategy\\" relating to his market abuse activities on the ICE Futures Europe exchange. They earned US$279,920 in profits over the six weeks period \\"at the expense of other market participants ‚Äì primarily other High Frequency Traders or traders using algorithmic and/or automated systems.\\" Providence vs Wall Street On 18 April 2014 Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of the city of Providence, Rhode Island in Federal Court in the Southern District of New York. The complaint in the high frequency matter named \\"every major stock exchange in the U.S.\\" This includes the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq, Better Alternative Trading System (Bats) ‚Äî an electronic communication network (ECN) and Direct Edge among others. The suit also names major Wall Street firms including but not limited to, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, JPMorgan and the Bank of America. High-frequency trading firms and hedge funds are also named in the lawsuit. The lawsuit claimed that, \\"For at least the last five years, the Defendants routinely engaged in at least the following manipulative, self-dealing and deceptive conduct,\\" which included \\"spoofing ‚Äì where the HFT Defendants send out orders with corresponding cancellations, often at the opening or closing of the stock market, in order to manipulate the market price of a security and/or induce a particular market reaction.\\" Dodd‚ÄìFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act CFTC‚Äôs Enforcement Director, David Meister, explained the difference between legal and illegal use of algorithmic trading, It is \\"against the law to spoof, or post requests to buy or sell futures, stocks and other products in financial markets without intending to actually follow through on those orders.\\" Anti-spoofing statute is part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act passed in July 21, 2010. The Dodd-Frank brought significant changes to financial regulation in the United States. It made changes in the American financial regulatory environment that affect all federal financial regulatory agencies and almost every part of the nation's financial services industry. Eric Moncada, another trader is accused of spoofing in wheat futures markets and faces CFTC fines of $1.56 million. 2010 Flash Crash and the lone Hounslow day-trader On April 21, 2015, five years after the incident, the U.S. Department of Justice laid \\"22 criminal counts, including fraud and market manipulation\\" against Navinder Singh Sarao, who became known as the Hounslow day-trader. Among the charges included was the use of spoofing algorithms, in which first, just prior to the Flash Crash, he placed thousands of E-mini S&P; 500 stock index futures contract orders. These orders, amounting to about \\"$200 million worth of bets that the market would fall\\" were \\"replaced or modified 19,000 times\\" before they were cancelled that afternoon. Spoofing, layering and front-running are now banned. The CTFC concluded that Sarao \\"was at least significantly responsible for the order imbalances\\" in the derivatives market which affected stock markets and exacerbated the flash crash. Sarao began his alleged market manipulation in 2009 with commercially available trading software whose code he modified \\"so he could rapidly place and cancel orders automatically.\\" Sarao is a 36-year- old small-time trader who worked from his parents‚Äô modest semi-attached stucco house in Hounslow in suburban west London. Traders Magazine correspondent John Bates argues that by April 2015, traders can still manipulate and impact markets in spite of regulators and banks' new, improved monitoring of automated trade systems. For years, Sarao denounced high-frequency traders, some of them billion-dollar organisations, who mass manipulate the market by generating and retract numerous buy and sell orders every millisecond (\\"quote stuffing\\") ‚Äî which he witnessed when placing trades at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). Sarao claimed that he made his choices to buy and sell based on opportunity and intuition and did not consider himself to be one of the HFTs. The 2010 Flash Crash was a United States trillion-dollar stock market crash, in which the \\"S&P; 500, the Nasdaq 100, and the Russell 2000 collapsed and rebounded with extraordinary velocity.\\" Dow Jones Industrial Average \\"experienced the biggest intraday point decline in its entire history,\\" plunging 998.5 points (about 9%), most within minutes, only to recover a large part of the loss.

The basic configuration of a vertebra varies; the large part is the body, and the central part is the centrum. The upper and lower surfaces of the vertebra body give attachment to the intervertebral discs. The posterior part of a vertebra forms a vertebral arch, in eleven parts, consisting of two pedicles, two laminae, and seven processes. The laminae give attachment to the ligamenta flava (ligaments of the spine). There are vertebral notches formed from the shape of the pedicles, which form the intervertebral foramina when the vertebrae articulate. These foramina are the entry and exit conduits for the spinal nerves. The body of the vertebra and the vertebral arch form the vertebral foramen, the larger, central opening that accommodates the spinal canal, which encloses and protects the spinal cord. Vertebrae articulate with each other to give strength and flexibility to the spinal column, and the shape at their back and front aspects determines the range of movement. Structurally, vertebrae are essentially alike across the vertebrate species, with the greatest difference seen between an aquatic animal and other vertebrate animals. As such, vertebrates take their name from the vertebrae that compose the vertebral column. Structure In the human vertebral column the size of the vertebrae varies according to placement in the vertebral column, spinal loading, posture and pathology. Along the length of the spine the vertebrae change to accommodate different needs related to stress and mobility.McGraw-Hill Science and Technology Each vertebra is an irregular bone. Side view of vertebrae Every vertebra has a body, which consists of a large anterior middle portion called the centrum (plural centra) and a posterior vertebral arch, also called a neural arch. The body is composed of cancellous bone, which is the spongy type of osseous tissue, whose micro- anatomy has been specifically studied within the pedicle bones. This cancellous bone is in turn, covered by a thin coating of cortical bone (or compact bone), the hard and dense type of osseous tissue. The vertebral arch and processes have thicker coverings of cortical bone. The upper and lower surfaces of the body of the vertebra are flattened and rough in order to give attachment to the intervertebral discs. These surfaces are the vertebral endplates which are in direct contact with the intervertebral discs and form the joint. The endplates are formed from a thickened layer of the cancellous bone of the vertebral body, the top layer being more dense. The endplates function to contain the adjacent discs, to evenly spread the applied loads, and to provide anchorage for the collagen fibers of the disc. They also act as a semi-permeable interface for the exchange of water and solutes. Anatomy of a vertebra The vertebral arch is formed by pedicles and laminae. Two pedicles extend from the sides of the vertebral body to join the body to the arch. The pedicles are short thick processes that extend, one from each side, posteriorly, from the junctions of the posteriolateral surfaces of the centrum, on its upper surface. From each pedicle a broad plate, a lamina, projects backwards and medialwards to join and complete the vertebral arch and form the posterior border of the vertebral foramen, which completes the triangle of the vertebral foramen. The upper surfaces of the laminae are rough to give attachment to the ligamenta flava. These ligaments connect the laminae of adjacent vertebra along the length of the spine from the level of the second cervical vertebra. Above and below the pedicles are shallow depressions called vertebral notches (superior and inferior). When the vertebrae articulate the notches align with those on adjacent vertebrae and these form the openings of the intervertebral foramina. The foramina allow the entry and exit of the spinal nerves from each vertebra, together with associated blood vessels. The articulating vertebrae provide a strong pillar of support for the body. There are seven processes projecting from the vertebra; a spinous process, two transverse processes, and four articular processes. A major part of a vertebra is a backward extending spinous process (sometimes called the neural spine) which projects centrally. This process points dorsally and caudally from the junction of the laminae. The spinous process serves to attach muscles and ligaments. The two transverse processes, one on each side of the vertebral body, project from either side at the point where the lamina joins the pedicle, between the superior and inferior articular processes. They also serve for the attachment of muscles and ligaments, in particular the intertransverse ligaments. There is a facet on each of the transverse processes of thoracic vertebrae which articulates with the tubercle of the rib. A facet on each side of the thoracic vertebral body articulates with the head of the rib. There are superior and inferior articular facet joints on each side of the vertebra, which serve to restrict the range of movement possible. These facets are joined by a thin portion of the vertebral arch called the pars interarticularis. The transverse process of a lumbar vertebra is also sometimes called the costalPlatzer (2004), pp 42‚Äì43Latin costa refers to either a \\"rib\\" or \\"side\\" of the body. (Diab (1999), p 76) or costiform process because it corresponds to a rudimentary rib (costa) which, as opposed to the thorax, is not developed in the lumbar region.Tweedie, A. The library of medicine p. 31Heinz Feneis, Wolfgang Dauber (2000) Pocket Atlas of Human Anatomy: Based on the International Nomenclature p. 2 Regional variation Segments of Vertebrae Vertebrae take their names from the regions of the vertebral column that they occupy. There are thirty-three vertebrae in the human vertebral column‚Äîseven cervical vertebrae, twelve thoracic vertebrae, five lumbar vertebrae, five fused sacral vertebrae forming the sacrum and three to five coccygeal vertebrae, forming the coccyx. The regional vertebrae increase in size as they progress downwards but become smaller in the coccyx. = Cervical vertebrae = A typical cervical vertebra There are seven cervical vertebrae (but eight cervical spinal nerves), designated C1 through C7. These bones are, in general, small and delicate. Their spinous processes are short (with the exception of C2 and C7, which have palpable spinous processes). C1 is also called the atlas, and C2 is also called the axis. The structure of these vertebrae is the reason why the neck and head have a large range of motion. The atlanto-occipital joint allows the skull to move up and down, while the atlanto-axial joint allows the upper neck to twist left and right. The axis also sits upon the first intervertebral disc of the spinal column. Cervical vertebrae possess transverse foramina to allow for the vertebral arteries to pass through on their way to the foramen magnum to end in the circle of Willis. These are the smallest, lightest vertebrae and the vertebral foramina are triangular in shape. The spinous processes are short and often bifurcated (the spinous process of C7, however, is not bifurcated, and is substantially longer than that of the other cervical spinous processes). The atlas differs from the other vertebrae in that it has no body and no spinous process. It has instead a ring-like form, having an anterior and a posterior arch and two lateral masses. At the outside centre points of both arches there is a tubercle, an anterior tubercle and a posterior tubercle, for the attachment of muscles. The front surface of the anterior arch is convex and its anterior tubercle gives attachment to the longus colli muscle. The posterior tubercle is a rudimentary spinous process and gives attachment to the rectus capitis posterior minor muscle. The spinous process is small so as not to interfere with the movement between the atlas and the skull. On the under surface is a facet for articulation with the dens of the axis. Specific to the cervical vertebra is the transverse foramen (also known as foramen transversarium). This is an opening on each of the transverse processes which gives passage to the vertebral artery and vein and a sympathetic nerve plexus. On the cervical vertebrae other than the atlas, the anterior and posterior tubercles are on either side of the transverse foramen on each transverse process. The anterior tubercle on the sixth cervical vertebra is called the carotid tubercle because it separates the carotid artery from the vertebral artery. There is a hook-shaped uncinate process on the side edges of the top surface of the bodies of the third to the seventh cervical vertebrae and of the first thoracic vertebra. Together with the vertebral disc, this uncinate process prevents a vertebra from sliding backwards off the vertebra below it and limits lateral flexion (side-bending). Luschka's joints involve the vertebral uncinate processes. The spinous process on C7 is distinctively long and gives the name vertebra prominens to this vertebra. Also a cervical rib can develop from C7 as an anatomical variation. The term cervicothoracic is often used to refer to the cervical and thoracic vertebrae together, and sometimes also their surrounding areas. =Thoracic vertebrae= A typical thoracic vertebra The twelve thoracic vertebrae and their transverse processes have surfaces that articulate with the ribs. Some rotation can occur between the thoracic vertebrae, but their connection with the rib cage prevents much flexion or other movement. They may also be known as \\"dorsal vertebrae\\" in the human context. The vertebral bodies are roughly heart-shaped and are about as wide anterio-posteriorly as they are in the transverse dimension. Vertebral foramina are roughly circular in shape. The top surface of the first thoracic vertebra has a hook-shaped uncinate process, just like the cervical vertebrae. The thoracolumbar division refers to the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae together, and sometimes also their surrounding areas. The thoracic vertebrae attach to ribs and so have articular facets specific to them; these are the superior, transverse and inferior costal facets. As the vertebrae progress down the spine they increase in size to match up with the adjoining lumbar section. = Lumbar vertebrae = Lumbar vertebra showing mammillary processes A typical lumbar vertebra The five lumbar vertebrae are the largest of the vertebrae, their robust construction being necessary for supporting greater weight than the other vertebrae. They allow significant flexion, extension and moderate lateral flexion (side- bending). The discs between these vertebrae create a natural lumbar lordosis (a spinal curvature that is concave posteriorly). This is due to the difference in thickness between the front and back parts of the intervertebral discs. The lumbar vertebrae are located between the ribcage and the pelvis and are the largest of the vertebrae. The pedicles are strong, as are the laminae, and the spinous process is thick and broad. The vertebral foramen is large and triangular. The transverse processes are long and narrow and three tubercles can be seen on them. These are a lateral cosiform process, a mammillary process and an accessory process.Postacchini, Franco (1999) Lumbar Disc Herniation p. 19 The superior, or upper tubercle is the mammillary process which connects with the superior articular process. The multifidus muscle attaches to the mammillary process and this muscle extends through the length of the vertebral column, giving support. The inferior, or lower tubercle is the accessory process and this is found at the back part of the base of the transverse process. The term lumbosacral is often used to refer to the lumbar and sacral vertebrae together, and sometimes includes their surrounding areas. =Sacrum= Sacrum There are five sacral vertebrae (S1‚ÄìS5) which are fused in maturity, into one large bone, the sacrum, with no intervertebral discs.Drake et al, Gray's Anatomy for Students, Churchill Livingstone/Elsevier (2010), 2nd edition, chapter 2 The sacrum with the ilium forms a sacroiliac joint on each side of the pelvis, which articulates with the hips. =Coccyx= The last three to five coccygeal vertebrae (but usually four) (Co1‚ÄìCo5) make up the tailbone or coccyx. There are no intervertebral discs. Development Development of vertebrae Somites form in the early embryo and some of these develop into sclerotomes. The sclerotomes form the vertebrae as well as the rib cartilage and part of the occipital bone. From their initial location within the somite, the sclerotome cells migrate medially towards the notochord. These cells meet the sclerotome cells from the other side of the paraxial mesoderm. The lower half of one sclerotome fuses with the upper half of the adjacent one to form each vertebral body. Walker, Warren F., Jr. (1987) Functional Anatomy of the Vertebrate San Francisco: Saunders College Publishing. From this vertebral body, sclerotome cells move dorsally and surround the developing spinal cord, forming the vertebral arch. Other cells move distally to the costal processes of thoracic vertebrae to form the ribs. Function Functions of vertebrae include: #Support of the vertebrae function in the skeletomuscular system by forming the vertebral column to support the body #Protection. Vertebrae contain a vertebral foramen for the passage of the spinal canal and its enclosed spinal cord and covering meninges. They also afford sturdy protection for the spinal cord. The upper and lower surfaces of the centrum are flattened and rough in order to give attachment to the intervertebral discs. #Movement. The vertebrae also provide the openings, the intervertebral foramina which allow the entry and exit of the spinal nerves. Similarly to the surfaces of the centrum, the upper and lower surfaces of the fronts of the laminae are flattened and rough to give attachment to the ligamenta flava. Working together in the vertebral column their sections provide controlled movement and flexibility. #Feeding of the intervertebral discs through the reflex (hyaline ligament) plate that separates the cancellous bone of the vertebral body from each disk Spinal cord direv.svgThe spinal cord nested in the vertebral column. Gray298.pngVertebral joint Gray313.pngCostovertebral joint Gray90.pngA facet joint between the superior and inferior articular processes (labeled at top and bottom). Clinical significance There are a number of congenital vertebral anomalies, mostly involving variations in the shape or number of vertebrae, and many of which are unproblematic. Others though can cause compression of the spinal cord. Wedge-shaped vertebrae, called hemivertebrae can cause an angle to form in the spine which can result in the spinal curvature diseases of kyphosis, scoliosis and lordosis. Severe cases can cause spinal cord compression. Block vertebrae where some vertebrae have become fused can cause problems. Spina bifida can result from the incomplete formation of the vertebral arch. Spondylolysis is a defect in the pars interarticularis of the vertebral arch. In most cases this occurs in the lowest of the lumbar vertebrae (L5), but may also occur in the other lumbar vertebrae, as well as in the thoracic vertebrae. Spinal disc herniation, more commonly called a slipped disc, is the result of a tear in the outer ring (anulus fibrosus) of the intervertebral disc, which lets some of the soft gel- like material, the nucleus pulposus, bulge out in a hernia. This may be treated by a minimally-invasive endoscopic procedure called Tessys method. A laminectomy is a surgical operation to remove the laminae in order to access the spinal canal. The removal of just part of a lamina is called a laminotomy. A pinched nerve caused by pressure from a disc, vertebra or scar tissue might be remedied by a foraminotomy to broaden the intervertebral foramina and relieve pressure. It can also be caused by a foramina stenosis, a narrowing of the nerve opening, as a result of arthritis. Another condition is spondylolisthesis when one vertebra slips forward onto another. The reverse of this condition is retrolisthesis where one vertebra slips backwards onto another. The vertebral pedicle is often used as a radiographic marker and entry point in vertebroplasty, kyphoplasty, and spinal fusion procedures. The arcuate foramen is a common anatomical variation more frequently seen in females. It is a bony bridge found on the first cervical vertebra, the atlas where it covers the groove for the vertebral artery. Degenerative disc disease is a condition usually associated with ageing in which one or more discs degenerate. This can often be a painfree condition but can also be very painful. Other animals Regions of vertebrae in the goat In other animals the vertebrae take the same regional names except for the coccygeal ‚Äì in animals with tails the separate vertebrae are usually called the caudal vertebrae. Because of the different types of locomotion and support needed between the aquatic and other vertebrates, the vertebrae between them show the most variation, though basic features are shared. The spinous processes which are backward extending are directed upwards in animals without an erect stance. These processes can be very large in the larger animals since they attach to the muscles and ligaments of the body. In the elephant the vertebrae are connected by tight joints, which limit the backbone's flexibility. Spinous processes are exaggerated in some animals, such as the extinct Dimetrodon and Spinosaurus, where they form a sailback or finback. Vertebrae with saddle- shaped articular surfaces on their bodies, called \\"heterocoelous\\", allow vertebrae to flex both vertically and horizontally while preventing twisting motions. Such vertebrae are found in the necks of birds and some turtles. An example of procoelous vertebrae dissected from a rattlesnake. \\"Procoelous\\" vertebrae feature a spherical protrusion extending from the caudal end of the centrum of one vertebra that fits into a concave socket on the cranial end of the centrum of an adjacent vertebra. These vertebrae are most often found in reptiles, but are found in some amphibians such as frogs. The vertebrae fit together in a ball-and-socket articulation, in which the convex articular feature of an anterior vertebra acts as the ball to the socket of a caudal vertebra. This type of connection permits a wide range of motion in most directions, while still protecting the underlying nerve cord. The central point of rotation is located at the midline of each centrum, and therefore flexion of the muscle surrounding the vertebral column does not lead to an opening between vertebrae. In many species, though not in mammals, the cervical vertebrae bear ribs. In many groups, such as lizards and saurischian dinosaurs, the cervical ribs are large; in birds, they are small and completely fused to the vertebrae. The transverse processes of mammals are homologous to the cervical ribs of other amniotes. In the whale the cervical vertebrae are typically fused, an adaptation trading flexibility for stability during swimming. All mammals except manatees and sloths have seven cervical vertebrae, whatever the length of the neck. This includes seemingly unlikely animals such as the giraffe, the camel, and the blue whale, for example. Birds usually have more cervical vertebrae with most having a highly flexible neck consisting of 13‚Äì25 vertebrae. In all mammals, the thoracic vertebrae are connected to ribs and their bodies differ from the other regional vertebrae due to the presence of facets. Each vertebra has a facet on each side of the vertebral body, which articulates with the head of a rib. There is also a facet on each of the transverse processes which articulates with the tubercle of a rib. The number of thoracic vertebrae varies considerably across the species. Most marsupials have thirteen, but koalas only have eleven. The norm is twelve to fifteen in mammals, (twelve in the human), though there are from eighteen to twenty in the horse, tapir, rhinoceros and elephant. In certain sloths there is an extreme number of twenty-five and at the other end only nine in the cetacean.Hyman (1922), p. 124 There are fewer lumbar vertebrae in chimpanzees and gorillas, which have three in contrast to the five in the genus Homo. This reduction in number gives an inability of the lumbar spine to lordose but gives an anatomy that favours vertical climbing, and hanging ability more suited to feeding locations in high-canopied regions. The bonobo differs by having four lumbar vertebrae. Caudal vertebrae are the bones that make up the tails of vertebrates. They range in number from a few to fifty, depending on the length of the animal's tail. In humans and other tailless primates, they are called the coccygeal vertebrae, number from three to five and are fused into the coccyx.

The movement's name derives from the fact that its core and origins lay in the city of Aligarh in Northern India and, in particular, with the foundation of the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College in 1875. The founder of the oriental college, and the other educational institutions that developed from it, was Sir Syed Ahmed Khan. He became the leading light of the wider Aligarh Movement. The educational reform established a base, and an impetus, for the wider Movement: an Indian Muslim renaissance that had a profound implications for the religion, the politics, the culture and society of the Indian sub-continent. Education Aligarh Muslim University is the creation of the movement. The Aligarh Movement had a profound impact on the Indian society, particularly on the Muslim society compared to the other powerful but less adaptable movements of the 19th century. It influenced a number of other contemporary movements to a great extent that it caused the emergence of other socio-religious movements during the 19th century. The impact of Aligarh Movement was not confined to the Northern India only, but its expansion could be seen on the other regions of the Indian sub-continent during the 20th century. The Aligarh Movement has made a weighty and lasting contribution to the political emancipation of Indian Muslims. The Deoband school was opposed to the movement as Aligarh Movement. The Aligarh Movement introduced a new trend in Urdu literature. Sir Syed Ahmad Khan and his association left the old style of writing in the Urdu language, which was rhetorical and academic, and started a simple style which helped Muslims to understand the main purpose of the movement. Sir Syed Ahmed was the central figure behind this awakening.  References  Further reading *Ashirbadi Lal Srivastava, The Aligarh movement; its origin and development, 1858-1906 by Ema.

The subsequent investigation concluded that somatogravic illusion most likely lead to in-flight loss of control and the resulting crash. Accident On the day of the accident, the Short 360-100, operated by Skyway Enterprises on a FedEx charter flight, took off from Princess Juliana's runway 28 at 18:35 local time (22:35Z). During the initial climb-out, approximately 30 seconds after takeoff and at an altitude of about , the air traffic controller gave instructions to change heading to 230¬∞. Shortly afterwards, the aircraft crashed into the sea approximately a mile from Maho Beach. The pilot and co- pilot suffered fatal injuries. Aircraft and crew The accident aircraft, registration N380MQ , was manufactured by the Short Brothers aerospace company in the United Kingdom in 1986 with manufacturer's serial number SH3702. It was powered by two Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-65AR turboprop engines rated at 1,424 shp (1,062 kW) each.. The aircraft was originally ordered as a passenger airliner for Simmons Airlines. It soon after became a part of American Airline's regional carrier American Eagle. It operated for American Eagle until the mid to later part of the 1990s. In the early 2000s, it was purchased by Skyway Enterprises and converted to carry cargo. Up until the crash, the aircraft was still painted in its former American Eagle livery with their logo and titles removed. The crew consisted of a 49-year-old German national carrying a valid United States green card as captain and a U.S. citizen from Puerto Rico as first officer. Recovery At 20:30 local time on the day of the crash, large volumes of debris were reported washing up on shore between Mullet Bay and La Samanna. Rescue efforts were hampered by bad weather, with lightning and heavy rain. At approximately 21:20 the battered body of the pilot Eric Schnell was recovered between Mullet Bay and Cupecoy by the Coast Guard, working with the Royal Marines. On November 5, 2014 a team of experts arrived from Puerto Rico to assist with recovery of main fuselage from the seabed. A Global Positioning System (GPS) set that was found during the search and rescue operation was sent to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to assist in narrowing the search area. On November 10, 2014 the fuselage and a wing were located at a depth of 75 feet by the rescue team in cooperation with the Coast Guard. The missing co-pilot and his seat were not found inside the cabin. During a search of the wreckage site and surrounding area on November 11, 2014, scuba divers found the body of the co-pilot, still strapped to his seat. Investigation Details investigators examined include: Weather At 19:00 local time, 25 minutes after the crash the weather was reported as \\"Wind 210 degrees at 8 knots, varying in direction between 160 and 250 degrees; Visibility: 10+ km; light rain; few clouds at 1300 feet; broken clouds at 3500 feet; Temperature: 27¬∞C; Dew point 25¬∞C; Pressure: 1011 mb\\". Prior incident \\"The crash follows another incident at SXM Airport just two days prior in which the same aircraft is understood to have been involved. The aircraft is said to have developed a problem during landing and to have veered to the left on the runway, nearly hitting the airport‚Äôs SOL jet fuel bunker, after which it had to be removed by the Fire Department. The aircraft had undergone repairs during the last two days.\\" Technical problems \\"Unconfirmed reports stated that the girlfriend of one of the pilots has said that her partner told her he felt uneasy about flying the plane after its recent near miss with technical problems, when it nearly crashed into a SOL fuel tanker on landing two days earlier.\\" The Sint Maarten Civil Aviation Authority released an aircraft accident report on September 23, 2016 stating: \\"The investigation believes the PF experienced a loss of control while initiating a turn to the required departure heading after take-off. Flap retraction and its associated acceleration combined to set in motion a somatogravic illusion for the PF. The PF‚Äôs reaction to pitch down while initiating a turn most likely led to an extreme unusual attitude and the subsequent crash. PM awareness to the imminent loss of control and any attempt to intervene could not be determined. Evidence show that Crew resource management (CRM) performance was insufficient to avoid the crash.\\" \\"Contributing factors to the loss of control were environmental conditions including departure from an unfamiliar runway with loss of visual references (black hole), night and rain with gusting winds.\\" References External links * Aviation accidents and incidents in 2014 Accidents and incidents involving the Short 360 Aviation accidents and incidents involving ditching Aviation in Sint Maarten 2014 in Sint Maarten October 2014 events in North America ","title":"Skyway Enterprises Flight 7101"},{"id":"46521274","text":"Molotov Cocktail Party is the debut studio album by post-hardcore band Frodus, released in 1994 through Gnome Records, initially released exclusively on cassette format, limited to 1,000 blue copies.

Cohen from Stephen King's 1986 novel of the same name. The story revolves around a predatory monster which has the ability to transform itself into its prey's worst fears, allowing it to exploit the phobias of its victims. It mostly takes the humanoid form of a darkly comedic clown called Pennywise. The protagonists are The Lucky Seven, or The Losers Club, a group of outcast kids who discover Pennywise and vow to kill him by any means necessary. The series takes place over two different time periods, the first when the Losers first confront Pennywise as children in 1960, and the second when they return as adults in 1990 to defeat him a second time after he resurfaces. A special of the November sweeps month of 1990, It was still a big risk for ABC due to horror's lack of popularity in television, declining network viewership decreasing the impact of big events like miniseries, while theatrical versions of King's work being box office bombs. However, they chose to produce it due to the success of Stand by Me (1986) and other television programs based on long books. In order to increase likely viewership, the producers exaggerated the novel's more positive themes of loyalty and friendship and cast performers most well known outside the horror genre. These included Pennywise actor Tim Curry and Losers Club actors Richard Thomas, John Ritter, Annette O'Toole, Harry Anderson, Dennis Christopher, Tim Reid and Richard Masur. The miniseries' child cast includes early roles for Jonathan Brandis, Seth Green, Emily Perkins, Gabe Khouth, Laura Harris, and Chelan Simmons. Produced by Green/Epstein Productions, It was filmed over a period of three months in New Westminster, British Columbia in mid-1990 with $12 million, double the usual television budget. The effects and the designs of the titular antagonist's forms, including Pennywise and the creature's true form of a humanoid spider, were produced on a 12-week deadline by Gene Warren's Fantasy II, who had a previous portfolio in theatrical work before working on It. Broadcast Standards and Practices constricted the amount of blood and gore it could show, resulting in an unusually psychologically- horrific and character-driven horror production for its time. Despite the risk factors, mixed pre-airing critical reviews, and coverage of George H. W. Bush's foreign trips cutting into the program; It managed to be ABC's biggest success of 1990, pulling through with 30 million viewers for its two parts. When it came to awards, It was nominated for two Emmy Awards, one Eddie Award, one Youth in Film award, and a best miniseries recognition from the People's Choice Awards; it won two of the nominations, an Emmy Award for Outstanding Music Composition for Richard Bellis' score and an Eddie Award for the miniseries' editing. While divided critical perspectives towards It have continued in later years, the miniseries has become most known for Curry's version of Pennywise. In fact, his portrayal has been considered by several publications to be one of the scariest clown characters in film and television. It has also spawned an Indiegogo-funded documentary film about the miniseries' production, titled Pennywise: The Story of IT (2020); and an alternate history sequel short named Georgie, also by the producers of the documentary and bringing back original Georgie actor Tony Dakota. Plot During a heavy rainstorm in Derry, Maine in the spring 1960, Georgie Denbrough plays in the streets with a paper sailboat made by his stuttering older brother Bill. It goes down a storm drain, where Georgie encounters an eccentric man who introduces himself as Pennywise the Dancing Clown. Pennywise entices Georgie to reach in to retrieve his boat, only to tear his arm off and leave him to bleed to death. A few months later, Bill and asthmatic Eddie Kaspbrak befriend the chubby new kid Ben Hanscom. They are later joined by Beverly Marsh, who lives with her abusive father, and she and Ben are introduced to Bill and Eddie's other friends: the comical Richie Tozier and Jewish boy scout Stan Uris. As they begin to know each other, Ben develops feelings for Beverly, but discovers she has feelings for Bill. Besides being bullied by Henry Bowers and his gang, the children all have encounters with Pennywise. In July, the group is joined by Mike Hanlon (Marlon Taylor), an African American kid being pursued by Bowers' gang. The children, dubbing themselves as the Losers Club, chase them off with a rock fight. While looking through Mike's history scrapbook, the Losers realize that Pennywise, whom they refer to as \\"It\\", is not a human being but rather a demon who awakens every thirty years to murder and devour children. Bill realizes It murdered Georgie, leading the Losers into Derry's sewers to kill the creature. Stan becomes separated from the group and is ambushed by Bowers and his friends Victor Criss and Belch Huggins, but the latter two are killed by It. Henry is left traumatized, his hair turned white. Stanley regroups with the Losers, but is grabbed by It. The Losers take advantage of It's ability to access their imaginations and use it against him. Eddie imagines his inhaler is full of battery acid, melting half of the creature's face. Beverly fires silver earrings at It, the Losers believing it can kill the demon. It retreats in a drain before grabbing Bill's arm. It's glove rips off and reveals a large three-fingered claw that disappears through the drain. After concluding It is dead, the group exits the sewers and makes a promise to return if It should ever resurface. Bowers, driven insane by seeing It kill his friends, falsely confesses to the murders and is institutionalized. 30 years later in October 1990, It reawakens and kills a little girl in her backyard, prompting another child-killing spree. Several months later in July, Mike, who was the only one to stay in Derry, contacts his old friends to fulfill their vow after hearing reports of missing children. All of the Losers, who have gone on to have successful careers, return, except Stan, who commits suicide. The other Losers return to Derry and reunite, later learning of Stan's suicide. Upon returning, they are all terrorized by Pennywise. Bowers escapes from the asylum, with help from It, to murder the Losers. Bill's British wife, Audra, travels to Derry but is captured by It, hypnotized by the monster's \\"Deadlights\\". Bowers attacks and stabs Mike, but in return is killed by Eddie. Mike is hospitalized, giving Bill the two silver earrings he retrieved from the sewers. The five remaining Losers return to the sewers to confront It, and Bill discovers Audra has been taken prisoner. They reach It's inner sanctum, find the catatonic Audra, and discover It's true form of a gigantic, otherworldly spider. Bill, Ben, and Richie are entranced by the Deadlights, while Beverly retrieves the silver earrings after misfiring them. Eddie attempts to repeat the wound he inflicted on It as a child, but is mortally wounded. Beverly frees her friends, but Eddie dies. The others chase the injured demon, ripping out its heart and killing It. They remove Eddie's body and the catatonic Audra from the sewers. The Losers go their separate ways once again, their memories of It and each other fading over time. Mike recovers in the hospital, Beverly and Ben get married and are expecting their first child, and Richie is cast in a film. Bill is the last to leave Derry, coaxing Audra out of her catatonia by riding down a street on his childhood bike \\"Silver\\". Audra recovers and she and Bill kiss in the middle of town.  Cast and characters  It's main ensemble features actors not very well known in horror, such as John Ritter, Tim Reid, Harry Anderson, and Tim Curry. Thomas' only previous horror venture was Tales From the Crypt; and Anderson's experience in the genre include an episode in the series and his magician shows, where he would eat live animals, put a nail up in his nose, and catch a gun bullet with his teeth. This casting was unusual for a horror production at the time, but producer Jim Green reasoned that it was in order to increase eyeballs from more easily frightened casual viewers. The majority of the adult actors in the film, including Ritter, Dennis Christopher, Reid and Anderson, were hand-chosen by Wallace and Cohen for their roles. Emily Perkins and Marlon Taylor, who played the young Beverly Marsh and Mike Hanlon, were cast out of Vancouver, while Seth Green and Jonathan Brandis were cast out of Los Angeles for the parts of young Richie and Bill.  It  \\"What's fun about [Pennywise] is that a clown is traditionally a very cozy, comforting image, and Pennywise is none of those things.\\" ‚ÄîTim Curry in an interview published during It's production It is the titular shapeshifting antagonist of the miniseries whose primary form is a wisecracking clown named Pennywise, played by Tim Curry. Curry used Robin Williams-esque natural improvisation when playing Pennywise, giving the character a Bronx accent in order to sound like, as Curry put it, \\"an old-time Catskills comic.\\" While the original novel showcased It taking on many other incarnations, the miniseries only features four of them (not counting the forms of Georgie, Stan, and Al Marsh): an elderly lady Beverly meets named Mrs. Kersh, portrayed by Florence Paterson; Ben's dead father Captain Hanscom, played by Steve Makaj; a werewolf Richie encounters after viewing I Was a Teenage Werewolf (1957) played by an unknown actor (A 1991 Fangoria feature states an actor played the werewolf, but it didn't specify who and the actor isn't credited in the miniseries); and It's true spiderlike form, portrayed by Brent Baker. According to writer Lawrence D. Cohen, he had written the script for the series without a specific actor in mind for the role of Pennywise. Malcolm McDowell, Roddy McDowall, and Alice Cooper were in consideration to play Pennywise, but director Tommy Lee Wallace wanted Curry for the role. King recalled that there was doubt from the crew about Curry playing Pennywise, perhaps due to the actor previously being known for comic roles in films like The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975) and Clue (1985). However, Wallace wasn't a fan of the other choices, particularly McDowall, as Wallace found him to have too much \\"sweetness\\" to play a part like Pennywise. Curry took the role for the clown's \\"subversive nature,\\" being \\"both beguiling and murderous\\" and \\"a smile gone bad.\\" He was also originally planned to play all of It's forms, not just the clown; however, the crew thought it was quicker to have different actors play the other forms so they didn't have to take up so much time dealing with makeup changes. Because of the amount of makeup Curry had to have, he had the earliest call time of all of the actors. On each shooting day, it took at least three hours for him to take off his make-up and get out of his costume. Curry himself had a fear of clowns, so his contract for working on the miniseries required the crew to not use or have any reflective material where Curry could see his own face. In fact, a member of the technical staff of It was almost fired for using a hand mirror while Curry was having his makeup put on. Curry's performance unnerved the cast and crew so much they avoided him as much as possible while on set. While waiting between shots, Curry would be chain-smoking and showing his sharp teeth if one of the child actors got too close to him; as Perkins recalled, \\"He really tried to intimidate us, because he wanted the fear to be real in our performances.\\" However, Wallace recalled having a favorable time working with Curry: \\"Tim was always well-prepared, easy on set, patient and low-key.\\" Aside from one Fangoria interview in 1990, Curry never publicly acknowledged his involvement in It until an interview with Moviefone in 2015, where he called the role of Pennywise \\"a wonderful part\\", giving his blessing to successor Will Poulter; Poulter was set to play the character in the reboot, although ultimately dropped out. Bill Skarsg√•rd replaced him and while being interviewed at Fan Expo Canada Curry gave his approval, saying that \\"I like [Bill] Skarsg√•rd. I think he's very clever. It'll be interesting to see what sort of clown face he puts on. because it's not an obvious clown face at all.[..] So I'm fascinated to see it.\\" For more information about the make-up and designs of It's incarnations, see Special effects.  The Losers  Ritter had made several attempts to appear in a King adaptation before he worked on It. * Richard Thomas plays Bill Denbrough, the stuttering founder of the Losers Club whose desire to kill Pennywise is heavily influenced by the death of his younger brother Georgie. As an adult, he is a bestselling horror writer who lives in the United Kingdom before returning to Derry to face It in the present time. Stephen King fan himself, Thomas easily related with the character he portrayed, as he was easily frightened kid and had his imagination \\"so vivid that I could scare myself about just about anything. And I've never been particularly fond of snakes.\\" Jonathan Brandis, who played young Bill, described his role the hardest he'd ever done, especially when it came to performing the stuttering. * Annette O'Toole plays Beverly Marsh, the only female member of the Losers Club, and a fashion designer who has lived both in an abusive family and an abusive relationship. O'Toole was cast in the film at the suggestion of Ritter, with whom she had recently shot The Dreamer of Oz, and she recalled the process happening very quickly. As O'Toole described the character, What I loved about the character was the way she dealt with this terrible, lonely and abusive childhood she had and the way she found a family with these other kids. She kind of gets into this club, and it doesn't really matter that she's a girl. They accept her, and she finds a group of really kindred souls.\\" As Ritter explained the experience of being with O'Toole between breaks, \\"It was fun to refer to Annette as the 'it' girl when we went to restaurants together. She was the only woman with us and people thought it was kind of strange for six men to be out with one woman.\\" Emily Perkins portrays young Beverly Marsh. * John Ritter portrays Ben Hanscom, an architect who also became a bodybuilder after being obese as a child. Ritter had previously worked with Thomas on The Waltons. Ritter related to the role of Ben; as a child, he also called his friends \\"losers\\" during his most depressed moments. This was Ritter's first horror production, which excited him: \\"The thing I like about horror is you have to ask: Can I take it? It's like going on a roller-coaster ride. How far can you hang over the edge before you have to pull back? It's the idea that there is this dark side.\\" A huge King fan after the novel Carrie was released, Ritter made multiple attempts to appear in a King screen adaptation before It, all of which failed; his most recent of these was trying to get in touch with George A. Romero to star in a later- rejected theatrical version of The Stand Romero was planned to direct. Ritter then heard about a feature-length version of It in development and asked his manager, \\"Tell them [ABC] I'll play any part they want me to. I'll play the girl.\\" Initially, Ritter was unable to appear in the miniseries as casting began just as he started filming The Dreamer of Oz: The L. Frank Baum Story (1990). However, the casting was postponed following Romero's leave of the It project (see Development), which opened space for him to get the part of Ben. The young version of Ben is played by Brandon Crane, who, like Ritter, also connected with the character he played; he was raised without a dad and bullied for being fat at school in real life. Crane would later cameo in It Chapter Two (2019) as a working assistant for the adult Ben Hanscom, who was played by Jay Ryan in the film. * Harry Anderson is Richie Tozier, the comedic relief of the group who works as a late night television comedian and did funny impressions of real-life figures as a child. Anderson used improvisation with delivering one-liners for his character, and even made a directing suggestion to Wallace for a moment where all the Losers Club members hug Bill except for Richie; Wallace wasn't sure about the decision at first, but Anderson's idea was executed in the final cut as Richie was the only cynical member of the group after Stan's death. Seth Green plays young Richie. * Dennis Christopher is Eddie Kaspbrak, an asthmatic limousine service runner who has lived with his overbearing mother into his adult life. Jim Carrey was originally considered for the character before Christoper was chosen. Adam Faraizl plays Young Eddie. * Tim Reid portrays Mike Hanlon, the only black person in the Losers Club, as well as the only one to remain in Derry following the Losers Club's first defeat of It in 1960. Working as a librarian in the town, he calls all of the Losers to return to Derry 30 years later. David Alan Grier was initially considered for the role of Mike before Reid was cast. The young version of Mike is portrayed by Marlon Taylor, who recalled going through \\"two auditions and three or four callbacks before I was told that I had the part of young Mike.\\" * Richard Masur is Stanley Uris, a real estate broker who was a Jewish boy scout as a kid. Due to the character's early death, Masur has far less screen time than the other Loser actors. Ben Heller, who played young Stan, only had local theatre experience, small parts in 21 Jump Street and Wiseguy, and no commercial or modeling experience before auditioning for It. He got the role after his third read to the casting director, receiving the call claiming he got the part just after his seventeenth birthday. Given that the shooting entailed an adult cast with child counterparts, Wallace sought to have the adult actors meet with the children playing the younger versions of their characters: \\"We made a point of bringing the adult and children actors together for a couple of days, even though it was costly, since the adults and the kids have no scenes together.\\" For Ritter and Crane, the two looked very different, which meant they had to make similar the young and adult versions of Ben through actions and facial expressions.  Supporting cast  Olivia Hussey portrays Bill Denbrough's wife Audra. Because It was filmed in Vancouver, most of the supporting cast consists of actors well known in Canadian media and theater; exceptions include British actress Olivia Hussey as Bill's wife Audra, Tony Dakota as his brother Georgie Denbrough, and Michael Cole as Henry Bowers. Jarred Blancard played the young version of Henry; he hated having to call the character Mike Hanlon the n word, often apologizing to the actor playing young Mike, Marlon Taylor, for repeatedly using the word during practice. The amount of the Bowers Gang are reduced from seven in the novel to five for the miniseries: Gabe Khouth as Victor Criss and Chris Eastman as Belch Huggins, while the actors of Peter Gordon and Moose Sadler go uncredited. Other relatives of members of the Loser Clubs include Sheila Moore as Eddie's mother Ms. Kaspbrak; Michael Ryan as Beverly's abusive boyfriend Tom Rogan; Frank C. Turner as her just-as-abusive father Alvin Marsh; Caitlin Hicks as Stanley's wife Patti; Steven Hilton and Sheelah Megill as Bill's parents Zack and Sharon respectively; Noel Geer as Cousin Bradley; Susan Astley as Aunt Jean; and Claire Vardiel as Ben's girlfriend Arlene Hanscom. Chelan Simmons, who played Pennywise's first victim Laurie Ann Winterbarger, had her first non-commercial experience with It; she would later be known for appearing in several 21st- century budget horror films and a 2002 telefilm version of Carrie. Due to her fear of clowns, she has admitted to never seeing the miniseries or reading the original novel. The girl's mother is portrayed by Merrilyn Gann. Two Gemini Award winners, Nicola Cavendish and Venus Terzo, appear as a desk clerk and a woman named Lyndi respectively. Terence Kelly, who portrays officer Nell, was nominated for a Gemini for another role as an officer in Reg Serge. Two veterans of The X-Files appear in It: William B. Davis as Mr. Gedreau, and Megan Leitch as a library aide Richie talks to while being taunted by Pennywise. Other well-known Canadian actors in the miniseries include Laura Harris as Loni; Garry Chalk, most known for voice acting, as Eddie's gym class coach; Jay Brazeau as a taxi driver; Paul Batten as Eddie's pharmacist; Donna Peerless and Tom Heaton as teachers Miss Douglas and Mr. Keene; and Kim Kondrashoff, Helena Yea, and Charles Siegel as the Losers' classmates, Joey, Rose, and Nat respectively.  Context  King held strong dismay for television's limiting market of horror, and had low expectations once the miniseries was greenlit. There was only one television version of a Stephen King story before It, that being the 1979 adaptation of 'Salem's Lot (1975), directed by Tobe Hooper. Although critically acclaimed,. Retrieved November 10, 2019. it didn't change King's negative view on horror television as he still believed that the format was \\"too institutionally fainthearted and unimaginative to handle real horror\\" in 1983. This skepticism continued in the mid-1980s when he wrote and published It (1986), and he never thought a television version of the book would happen despite its success. His reason was that it was a censorship rule not to show children in jeopardy, a major theme in It. It was written over four years by King with inspirations from the story \\"Three Billy Goats Gruff\\" and legends about Bangor, Maine's sewer system. Despite garnering a polarized critical response for its huge amount of pages and bizarre sexual sequences, It was the best-selling hardcover fiction book in the United States in 1986, according to Publishers Weekly; and a British Fantasy Award winner. King's predictions about a TV version of the book not happening, while false, were also justified according to newspaper critic Matt Roush. At the end of the 1980s, a horror product of any kind was an unlikely gamble for a network. The television market was dominated by sitcoms, soap operas, and fictional presentations of real life events; there were series like Freddy's Nightmares (1988‚Äì90) and Friday the 13th: The Series (1987‚Äì90), but they were often hampered by network censorship, commercial breaks, low budgets, and \\"cheesy execution.\\" Other factors increased the risk of a network doing a film or miniseries version of a King story in the late 1980s to 1990; theatrical King screen transfers were performing poorly at the box office, and big TV events like miniseries or films were becoming far less important to viewers due to a rise in VCR ownership by 20 percent from 1985 to 1990. This resulted in channels like ABC taking several cost-cutting measures, such as adding more regular series to its lineup. Some critics also questioned the airing of a horror film like It on television, a format much easier for children to access than theaters due to less parental and government restrictions. King described his expectations of the miniseries being \\"in the basement. Here was a book that sprawled over 1,000 pages, and they were going to cram it into four hours, with commercials.\\"  Pre-production   Motive  Hollywood significantly increased their interest in screen adaptations of King's work after the box office success of Pet Sematary (1989), and several of went into development; around this time, ABC had acquired the rights to a television miniseries of It and green-lit it to be an eight-to-ten-hour miniseries. One reason, according to Lawrence D. Cohen, was that it was \\"the heyday of networks adapting lengthy novels for TV.\\" ABC film chief Allen Sabinson explained that they chose to produce It as a previous film based on a King story about children, Stand by Me (1986), was a success. The producers were also focused on the story's drama aspects, likely due to most viewers leaning towards drama productions in 1990. It was also being made in a time when the television landscape was making a slight change into unusual styles, as indicated by the popularity of shows like David Lynch's Twin Peaks (1990‚Äì91) and Tales from the Crypt (1989‚Äì96). In fact, Twin Peaks was constantly referenced in discussions between the cast and crew of It during shooting. As Tommy Lee Wallace recalled, \\"It brought everyone's attention to the fact that it doesn't have to be like and look like and act like everything else to succeed. You can break new ground ‚Äì not with hard-core violence or nudity, necessarily ‚Äì but just by being different and strange, which I certainly am trying to bring to It.\\" At the same time, CBS was taking similar chances with the horror film Psycho IV: The Beginning (1990), which aired in the same month as It and also featured Olivia Hussey, who played Audra in It.  Development  George A. Romero was originally planned to be It's director, but his scheduling conflicts and the miniseries' length decrease influenced him to drop out of the project. George A. Romero had originally been signed on to direct the project, which at the time ABC had planned for an eight-to-ten-hour series that would run over four two-hour blocks. On June 1, 1989, ABC announced that the miniseries would be six hours and directed by Romero, with no cast planned. A July 1989 announcement published in the Houston Chronicle indicates that the miniseries was originally planned to be set in \\"small-town Massachusetts\\" instead of Derry. In an interview published in January 1990, ABC's Dan Doran described It as a \\"long-range development project, and it's not even a firm, 100% commitment yet.\\" He also revealed Romero's involvement to be \\"tentative.\\" However, Romero described himself as being incredibly involved in the project: \\"I worked with the effects guys. I did [story] boards. I must have thousands of pages of scripts and notes.\\" However, a scheduling conflict with his 1990 remake of Night of the Living Dead (1968) resulted in him having to leave the project just after ABC decreased the length of the miniseries to four hours. His exit initially upset him because it reminded him of his time being dropped from Pet Sematary. However, he stated in 1993 that he appreciated his leave, feeling that the length decrease lessened the likely \\"impact\\" of the miniseries' final product. The producers were also worried about Romero making the miniseries too graphic for television. The producers \\"lost their nerve\\" from how much work they could be faced doing an eight-to-ten hour miniseries. Thus, ABC condensed it to a three-part series, before shortly after making it a two-part miniseries once Tommy Lee Wallace was signed on to direct after reading a draft of the first part of Cohen's script.  Writing  Cohen, who had previously written the film adaptation of Carrie in 1976, was hired to write It, receiving a manuscript of the novel that was sent to his New York apartment in 1986 before the book was published. Although King had multiple drafts of the script sent to him by Cohen, he had little to no involvement in the writing of the miniseries. Cohen's early drafts rejected the flashback format of the book, where the first night would show the Losers as kids and the second part as adults. He originally planned for the spider form to be hinted at in part one when Pennywise was hit by the rock, but the idea was scrapped. Cohen also initially wrote the second episode as, according to Wallace, \\"a very interior melodrama\\" that differed heavily from the novel and where Tom Rogan played a much bigger role in the plot. In reading Cohen's draft, Wallace initially avoided reading the book to get an objective view of it: \\"I knew I was dealing with people who had been intimately involved with the book for years.\\" After noticing many issues in the script, especially in the second part, Wallace give Cohen an offer to rewrite his drafts; however, that would've required Cohen to take a three-week trip to the miniseries' Vancouver production location, which his schedule wouldn't permit as he was involved in other projects. This led Wallace to have to re-write the script himself and use the book as reference, which turned out to fix all of the original drafts' issues. As Wallace explained, \\"One of the things I believe I contributed in my rewrite was just packing in as much of what was memorable about the book.\\" He added the flashback structuring from the book into the script and made sure the screenplay for the second part \\"maintain[ed] some of the rhythm\\" of the first.  Changes from the novel  Given the length of the King novel, which runs 1,138 pages, a great deal of material was left out of Cohen's 215-page screenplay, including subplots concerning the personal lives of the adult characters, one of which had the main male characters each losing their virginity to Beverly. Cohen, while upset about the material that didn't make it in the final cut, also opined, \\"the best moments from the book made the cut and the rest are casualties of war.\\" Themes of friendship and loyalty were distorted in the miniseries in order to appeal to non-horror TV viewers. O'Toole has admitted to disliking the removal of the Losers' orgy scene: \\"This was their greatest attachment to one another ‚Äì she thought they were all going to die, and this was a gift she was giving to each one of them, and I thought it was the most beautiful, generous love-filled gift, and it tied them all together in such an amazing way.\\" Cohen retrospectively admitted that he wished he was permitted to write an ending different from the novel's: \\"If I had to do it over again, my instinct would be to find a way to have the adults confront Pennywise in another way, in all his shapeshifting glory.\\" One major change King disliked but had to deal with was the decreased amount of depth of the main characters, particularly Richie Tozier, who was altered from a Los Angeles DJ into a television show comedian. He found the miniseries' version of Richie to have only two dimensions: \\"scumbag\\" and \\"sort of a kindhearted Buddy Hackett.\\" However, Wallace and Cohen retained the centrality of Pennywise in the source novel; as noted by film scholar Tony Magistrale in Hollywood's Stephen King, the made-for-television movie retains the \\"association between the adult world of Derry and It [which] is further established in the masterful choice of a carnival clown as a unifying symbol for the various creatures representing the monster.\\"  Production   Filming  The Lost Lagoon served as It's filming location for the Captain Hanscom scene. It was shot over a three-month summer period in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Green set the budget at $12 million, double the usual television film, to give It a major motion picture feel. Filming locations in Vancouver included Stanley Park, Beaver Lake and Saint Thomas Aquinas High School Convent in North Vancouver. The Buntzen Lake Hydro Plant, in particular, was used as the miniseries' sewer plant. For the opening scene where Laurie Winterbarger is murdered by Pennywise, Simmons' shots were done while Curry wasn't on set; Wallace stood at the laundry area of the backyard giving her simple directions for emotions. However, she still met Curry via read-throughs and while in her trailer after the shot: \\"while walking down the sidewalk Tim walked by in the full clown costume--make up and all. He turned to me and said \\"Hi!\\" in a very friendly voice, but it still scared me half to death!\\" Similarly, the scene where Patti Uris finds her husband dead in the tub (done on the first shooting day) involved Uris not being on set for shots of Caitlin Hicks' reaction. The Captain Hanscom sequence in the first part was shot at the Lost Lagoon, which involved Makaj on a platform just below the water surface to give the illusion of the character standing on water. The shots of the captain's corpse were done when Crane wasn't on set. Filming It was not without difficult sequences. The scene where the blood-filled balloon explodes in Beverly's bathroom required multiple takes due to how difficult it was to get the timing of the explosion right. The theater scene took many retakes and much waiting, so Curry went on the stage and entertained the child extras with singalongs, all unaware he was playing a monster character in the miniseries. Shooting the last sewer scene was tough for the adult actors, as they had to deal with walking in an area filled with rust likely infected with tetanus. The final scene with Bill and Audra Denbrough took days to rehearse, a library scene with all the adult actors involved some slight injuries due to the amount of objects randomly flying around the place, while the photo album scene where Pennywise comes to life was the hardest scene to shoot for Wallace.  Directing  Tommy Lee Wallace previously worked with John Carpenter (pictured), and much of Wallace's directing for It was inspired by Carpenter's work. In explaining why directing a screen version of a King story was difficult, Wallace summarized, \\"Stephen King is so good with language that he can make almost anything sound incredibly scary. Some of King's images translate to film. Some are simply ethereal, like smoke.\\" A lot of Wallace's directing was influenced by films he worked on with John Carpenter, such as Halloween (1978) and The Fog (1980). He made several technical and staging decisions just to make each scene scarier or weird. These included interesting camera tricks, such as the Chinese restaurant scene being shot with a handheld camera; and shots where It goes through pipes filmed as if they were from It's point of view, a decision inspired by Wallace's past experiences working with Carpenter. The Chinese restaurant sequence was shot in only one take and involved the actors not being aware what was going to happen so that \\"our expressions were all real,\\" explained Reid. As Wallace explained, \\"The fortune cookie scene is an example of how to get great scare-power out of fairly humble, low-budget special effects. A trick table, puppeteers underneath, a handful of creepy little cookie models, a group of characters taken by surprise. So much depended on the details.\\" When it came to the Ms. Kersh scene, Wallace place several incidental details, such as Mrs. Kersh's teeth being rotten like Pennywise's, to give the audience a clue something was up; the scene also ends with Beverly Marsh in the middle of the street, with intentionally no extras around to add to the creep factor. Wallace also chose to make the furniture in Stanley Uris' house odd to signify something being wrong with the character.  Special effects  Gene Warren's effects company Fantasy II were in the middle of working on Predator 2 (1990) when ABC assigned the company to work on It with a deadline of 12 weeks. The effects team of It included Warren, who handled the visual effects; Bart Mixon, who coordinated the makeup effects and Pennywise's animated deadlights; Jo-Anne Smith, who previously worked on Curry's make-up for his role in Legend (1985); Salty Ray; J.C. Matalon; and the Fantasy II effects team run by Warren's son, Gene Warren Jr., and including Jim McLoughlln, Aaron Sim, Brent Baker, Norman Cabrera, and Joey Orosco. Fantasy II previously worked on a feature also directed by Wallace named Fright Night Part 2 (1988) and another King adaptation named Pet Sematary (1989). The majority of the special effects were done practically without digital alteration, such as puppeteers being used to animate the fortune cookies in the Chinese restaurant scene. Some scenes was done with replacement animation, an animation technique similar to stop motion animation. Replacement animation was used for when Pennywise came out of the drain, killed Belch in the sewers, and did a somersault in the air. A lot of the effects Wallace planned to use while storyboarding didn't make it into the final version for budget reasons, such as the roots writhing around Pennywise in his ghostly encounter with the adult Losers in the sewer. Lindsay Craig, an artist who made a living doing prop work in film and television, created some of the blood for It using food coloring, water, and methacyl. While It's lair features many cocooned humans, Sally Ray and J.C. Matalon sculpted only six of them, four children and two adults, for close-up shots. To work with the deadline, Mixon divided the design team of each It creature into four artists: \\"Each artist was given a considerable amount of freedom with his creations, with occasional input from Warren or myself to make sure we were adhering to Wallace's vision.\\" = Pennywise = The appearance of Pennywise was based on Lon Chaney in The Phantom of the Opera (1925). When designing Pennywise, Mixon focused on making him look as \\"friendly\\" as possible: \\"This creature is trying to lure children in, so he's not going to be a monster at first.\\" He began drawing concepts for how Pennywise would look before Curry was cast, researching the looks of most other clowns in the process. Original storyboards for Pennywise featured exaggerated cheekbones, a sharp chin, and bulbous forehead. The Losers Club watch as Pennywise goes down the drain after his head was cracked open. Multiple effect techniques can be seen in this shot, such as rotoscoping for Pennywise's deadlights, the incorporation of a stop-motion puppet into a live-action shot, and a visual of one of Mixon's original head designs for the clown that only can be seen on the puppet. Mixon began working on a head cast for the Pennywise character after Curry was cast in the role; he also designed three clay molds for testing. According to Mixon, he based the shape of Pennywise's head on Lon Chaney in The Phantom of the Opera (1925), \\"stylized into a clown.\\" Three different versions of the clown's face were created, one of which resembled a hobo clown, another that was \\"a little meaner,\\" and the final one seen in the series. Mixon then worked with Curry on the makeup and tested two concepts: one with just a nose, headpiece, and a make-up pattern Curry suggested; and another one that was closer to the original designs. The former was chosen, although the other make-up choice is featured in the final cut when Pennywise is sprayed with battery acid. Instead of traditional clown make-up, PAX paint was used for makeup that made Pennywise look \\"almost like a living cartoon.\\" According to director Wallace, \\"Tim [Curry] objected strongly to all the rubber. He had recently been in several movies which covered him in prosthetics and I'm sure he felt all the glue and latex would just get in his way. He was right, of course. With those eyes, and that mouth, and his crazy, sardonic sense of humor, less turned out to be more in the makeup department.\\" However, the bulbous forehead was kept to give the character \\"a supernatural aspect without getting in the way.\\" Getting the clown faces rights also depended on some of the actor's own efforts, to the point where he had to do a day of training of not only getting into the character but also practicing the faces. Small adjustments to Pennywise's face, such as on his mouth and the eyebrows (\\"the hardest thing to get right\\" according to Curry), were still being made in the first five days of shooting. In the scenes when the clown became vicious, Curry wore yellow lenses and two sets of sharp teeth throughout shooting: a smaller set he could talk while wearing, and a less flexible but far bigger set for more horrifying shots. The teeth was designed by Jim McLoughlin. Wallace originally didn't want Pennywise to switch into a \\"horror\\" look but rather maintain the \\"nice\\" clown look throughout the miniseries, but this idea was dropped. Dan Platt sculpted a puppet replication of Pennywise specifically for the stop motion scenes, with painting done by Mixon and the hair by Jack Bricker. Rotoscoping was used for Pennywise's \\"dead light\\" effects in the first part of the miniseries. = Werewolf = Norman Cabrera sculpted the design of the werewolf. Because Wallace didn't want it to look like a usual \\"Howling type of creature,\\" Mixon instructed Cabrera to make \\"a slicker, '90s version\\" of the wolf from the 1950s film Richie viewed. The makeup used for the werewolf character was kept simple, consisting only of a spandex hood mask, gloves, and hair tied around the neck all put together through KY Jelly; this was done to suit the limited application time and \\"the nature of the shots.\\" Jack Bricker created the wolf's hair, and Mimi Cabrera made stylistic additions. Aaron Sims painted three sets of false eyes for the wolf; a \\"beauty pair\\" for close-up shots, a \\"stunt pair\\" that had the pupils \\"drilled out,\\" and a set of glowing eyes. Only the \\"stunt\\" and \\"beauty\\" pairs are seen in the final miniseries. = Mrs. Kersh = For the part when Mrs. Kersh is revealed to be Alvin Marsh's corpse, Florence Peterson was still playing the character. Cabrera was responsible for the Marsh part of Kersh's make-up, composed of two face pieces, one teeth piece, false fingernail pieces, one neck piece, two pieces on the back of the hands, and an \\"empty eyesocket\\" piece. Mixon handled a PAX paint layer of the makeup. As Mixon explained, \\"Director Wallace wanted an empty eyesocket look for Al, so Cabrera sculpted rot inside the sockets and then burned tiny holes through the foam for the actor to see through.\\" = Stanley's refrigerator head = The scene when the Losers find Stanley's decapitated head in the refrigerator was done via a split screen effect; it consists of one shot of Masur wearing a Jim- McLoughlin-designed \\"severed neck\\" with black areas filled in by another shot of the refrigerator without the actor. McLoughlin also created a dummy head of Stan used for wide shots. = The spider = Producing and shooting It's final spider form required a budget of $200,000 and 13 weeks of time. It began with Mixon coming up with the idea of a \\"soft and fleshy\\" spiderlike creature. Joey Orosco, with some help from Henry Mayo, used his idea to create a design that included the abdomen and multiple limbs of a spider; and shoulders, hips, and torso-attaching legs of a human; the body parts went through more than 16 concept sculptures. In addition to painting the entire creature, Orsco mold the torso, arms, and head; while the spider's legs and abdomen were sculpted by Sims. Sims also molded a stop-motion replica of the spider, with an armature built by Mike Joyce, used for nine split-screen, rear projection, and tabletop shots supervised by Warren. As Wallace explained, the spider was far less \\"beefy and muscular\\" and more \\"lean and mean\\" then what was in the concept drawings; its face was also not suppose to be as visible as it was in the final cut, although he blames himself for letting that happen. As Mixon described the 500-pound, 250-foot radio-controlled spider, \\"They've had some other creatures on TV but I can't think of anything just this big or this neat.\\" It's odd design and unusually large size caught the attention of Canadian customs officials when it reached the US-Canada border of White Rock during its relocation from Los Angeles to a sound stage at The Bridge Studios; the officials delayed the operation. Brent Baker was inside the spider, previously going through three months of training in using it, where there was a video monitor showing him how the spider was moving: \\"It got a little stuffy, but they had a place where they could stick in a little hose if I wanted water or some fresh air.\\" Baker got really uncomfortable when the spider had to do multiple shots of the roll-over movement, as he would have to lay on his side while the crew set up another shot. Dave Kindlon's mechanics of the spider required control by various operators for different body parts; the head was radio-controlled by three people, the legs were operated by six people, one person operated the arms, one handled the deadlights, and others handled the movement of the entire spider. As Mixon described controlling the spider, \\"We used a certain amount of animatronics for the head, and the body had some of my crew members inside it. Once we got it into place, we couldn't move it around too much, because it was pretty unwieldy. For some reason, they shot it in super slow motion, so it's no wonder it looks like it's not moving! It was capable of more than what you saw onscreen.\\" The final spider figure disappointed both the cast and Wallace.It DVD Commentary (2003). On set, Thomas called the spider a \\"diva,\\" Ritter mocked it as a \\"muppet from hell,\\" and O'Toole recalled most of the cast calling it the \\"Alaskan king crab.\\" King also disliked the spider, mocking it as \\"three Chevy headlights on the bottom of a wheelbarrow.\\" The effects artists made touches after King revealed his disappointment during production. As the producers were about to throw away the spider, Bart's father Tom rushed to Fantasy II to obtain it; as of January 1993, the spider resided in a Houston, Texas warehouse owned by Bart's parents Tom and Barbara.  Music  The use of a hair dryer gave Bellis the idea to use a major seventh as the first interval for It's title theme. It was composer Richard Bellis' first score since his career \\"came to a screeching halt for some unknown reason\\" in 1984. He was in the fourth year of owning a woodwork business when getting the call to score the miniseries. The score took five weeks to compose and produce. Bellis recorded four-days worth of orchestra parts performed by various ensembles that had 55 players at most, and the electronic instruments were tracked at Ray Colcord's home studio. Bellis' use of motifs and ostinatos in It were inspired by the works of Bernard Herrmann. The music features motifs of not only each Loser and Pennywise but also themes of nostalgia and the difference between the past and the present. In presenting the story's varied tone, the score mixes together adventurous orchestra motifs (especially so for the music of the last showdown between It and the Losers), horror synthesizer pieces, circus music, big band jazz, creepy sound design touches, and trumpet-heavy music accompanying the setting of Derry. Bellis took a long time figuring out the first interval of the title theme, since he considered the use of a tritone overused in horror. Then, one day, he spontaneously chose the interval to be a major seventh after he heard it on the hairdryer he was using. The scrapbook seen in the title sequence influenced how he composed the theme: \\"I do remember being struck by the fact that it was not like other scrapbooks, filled with happy memories. The pages were sparse and the sequence mostly in black & white.\\" The producers and Wallace initially intended The Impressions' cover of \\"The Way You Do the Things You Do\\" to be the title song, but it's instead played in the sequence where the Losers build a dam in the final cut. For Pennywise's circus theme, the choice of calliope, drums and bells performing it was obvious to Bellis; however, how he would use the bright-toned circus instruments was challenging in composing the theme for an evil clown. As Bellis described his thinking process, \\"does the music have to be evil too? Besides, calliope music is usually very busy‚Äî I use this instrument as a scoring instrument or will that just be distracting? Maybe I can use it in a register lower than an actual calliope is capable of playing and just with single notes. And what about a sort of \\"demented\\" carousel? Maybe I can create something that uses my major seventh interval?\\" In the beginning of It, Winterbarger sings \\"Itsy Bitsy Spider\\" while riding on a bike, which foreshadowes the titular antagonist's spider form. Wallace and the producers disliked the score (particularly the title music) according to Bellis. The first release of the score was in February 1996, but only as a 16-minute suite on the album Richard Bellis: Film Music Volume 1. Then, a 2-CD release of the TV movie's complete score by Richard Bellis was released on November 15, 2011 by Intrada Records, and is volume 184 of the label's special collection. On October 31, 2016, Warner Brothers, as part of their Archive Collection Series, issued the score in a shorter, one-tracklist version on CD and Spotify. In 2017, Waxwork Records issued the entire score for the first time on vinyl. A six-minute suite of the score, along with a six-minute outtake recording of an orchestra session, can be heard on Bellis' website. On October 18, 2016, guitarist Eric Calderone released his electric guitar cover of Bellis' circus theme for It.  Track listing   It's content in relation to television restrictions  AllMovie suggested It pushed the television barriers not only with its amount of blood, but also with its themes of child endangerment. As It was a television production, its content had to follow Broadcast Standards and Practices. This limited the amount of violence, gore, and blood displayed, and how it was presented. For instance, since blood couldn't come out of body orifices, blood instead had to come out of physical objects such as sinks and photo books. Mixon re-called that, when designing the skeleton Ben encountered, ABC didn't want the skeleton to be wet and have muscles hanging off of it. However, the skeleton was supposed to be wet cause it jumped out of a river. To get around the problem, Mixon decided to replace the skeleton meat with seaweed. As Mixon explained, \\"They just didn't want any [wet] gore, although rot and decay was okay.\\" The biggest broadcast rule the makers of It had to loophole around was not to show kids in jeopardy, which was a major issue as kids facing deadly situations was a prominent theme of the story. An example of this is Georgie's death; he couldn't have his arm shown to be ripped off, so it had to only be implied through dialogue. The censorship It dealt with made it more of a psychological horror product, something different from most popular horror productions at the time. Most of this horror is executed through the titular villain and the scared expressions of the Loser Clubs actors. Phil Rosenthal wrote that in order to be scared of It, \\"it is necessary to embrace the fantasy that such an evil entity could exist and cloud minds the way It does.\\" The lack of graphic content It could display also resulted its story to be very character-orientated for its genre. Like the original novel, It deals with multiple themes related to childhood: children's safety issues, trauma adults unconsciously place on kids, the importance of friendship, and childhood fears that continue into adulthood. The Losers, as children, face problems of bullying, abusive parenting, racism, and adults not paying attention to a sudden increase of child deaths. They're connected together all by being outsiders dealing with similar levels of traumatic situations, and work together to overcome those traumatic feelings by defeating \\"It,\\" a symbol of their inner fears. It also features comic touches to its otherwise scary plot and was labeled by a 2019 retrospective review as being a campy production for its \\"fake-looking\\" It forms, the main cast's over-the-top performances, and bizarre story elements, such as adults being afraid of balloons. Most of the goofy vibe comes from Curry's performance of Pennywise. which mixes together elements of horror, black comedy, and cheeriness. In addition to his odd methods of transportation, such as popping out of sinks, storm drains, and shower heads; Pennywise shows more of the look and behaviors of a regular circus clown than an extraterrestrial being. However, the clown is made terrifying through his corny lines, specifically how he delivers and adds subtext to them.  Reception   Broadcast  Part Two of It was the most VCR-recorded television production of November 1990. ABC originally did not want King seeing the footage of It until after it was broadcast; however, the author threatened the network that he would not do any promotional interviews if he did not see it first. King explained in a September 1990 Fangoria interview that he had seen the first hour of the miniseries, and that the rest was currently being edited. His reasoning for checking on the miniseries' progress was, \\"It's my damn book and I worked on it for three years.\\" It was initially planned to air on ABC in May 1990 before being moved to the \\"sweeps month\\" of November, specifically the nights of November 18 and November 20. That weekend, It and other network programs had to contend with many cut-ins of coverage of president George H. W. Bush's European trips, such as meetings with Vaclav Havel and Helmut Kohl; and his visit with troops in the Persian Gulf. Just before the broadcast, a variety of predictions were made by television writers about how big It's ratings would be. Journalist Janos D. Froelich analyzed the final product of It as looking cheaper than ABC's previous sweeps month big events, which made her less faithful about it being successful. Mike Drew suggested that while the star power could increase the miniseries' chances of succeeding, its content was \\"probably too tamed- down by TV requirements\\" to gain its primary target horror demographic. However, Joan Hanauer suggested the program would be \\"a natural ratings grabber\\" for its \\"good clean horror fun,\\" and Greg Paeth forecasted that it could bring in curious King fans. It turned out to be the biggest success of 1990 for Capital Cities, owner of ABC, garnering nearly 30 million viewers over its two-night premiere. Part 1 was the fifth highest rated program of the week with an 18.5/29 rating/share, and being watched in 17.5 million households. Part 2 was the second highest rated program of the week with a 20.6/33 rating/share, and watched in 19.2 million households. During a time when recording television programs on tape with VCR was becoming a commonly- practiced activity in family homes, the second part of It was the most taped program of the month of November, with 1.96 million tape machines detected by A.C. Nielsen to be recording it. In a year where traditional television films like Decoration Day (1990) and The Incident (1990) garnered the most viewers, It was the only non-safe fare on 1990 to obtain the high ratings it received. In France, the miniseries aired on M6 on October 16, 1993 under the title Il est revenu, French for He Came Back. When it aired on BBC One in the United Kingdom in 1994, part one garnered 6.6 million viewers; and the second part became the eleventh-most viewed program of the period of May 29 to August 14, 1994 by attracting 7.6 million watchers.  Pre-broadcast reviews  Television experts reported \\"rave\\" and not-so-fond reviews of It from television critics. Farrell Peter The Oregonian honored It as \\"the best horror show ever made for network television, and among the better miniseries of any genre offered this year,\\" praising its multi-layered story and performances. Some critics called it one of the far better King films. The Cincinnati Post labeled it \\"one of the creepiest productions put together for broadcast TV\\" (although opined it to be nothing more than for \\"thrills and chills\\"), and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch writer Eric Mink cherished it as \\"a gripping, bloody horror romp that will leave most of your major muscle groups aching from long stretches of constant tension.\\" Matt Roush of USA Today categorized It as \\"the mini-series equivalent of those Saturday matinee shockers that merrily warped a generation before Freddy and Jason began stalking their more graphic turf.\\"Quoted in Beam 1998, p. 108 Both David Zurawik of The Baltimore Sun and Ron Miller of the Press-Telegram enjoyed It for working both as a straightforward scary miniseries and a very deep story, Zurawik highlighting its many \\"finely crafted\\" mythic and religious undertones. Some critics highlighted its priority on character development over the typical horror traits of blood and gore, Richmond elaborating it was \\"all the more disturbing and believable by the fact that we are forced to care about these people as individuals.\\" Many reviewers spotlighted some of the scare moments of the miniseries, often using the Chinese restaurant sequence as an example. A couple reviews particularly appreciated the miniseries' horrification of everyday objects and scenarios, such as shower heads and photo galleries. Times Union writer Steve Bornfeld recommended it for its freaky visuals and \\"effective cast,\\" particularly Curry: \\"With his razor-sharp teeth and bloody balloons, Curry delicately balances clown-like cheer and pure evil, exploiting the freak show side of clowns that can terrify children.\\" Julia Keller of The Columbus Dispatch applauded the \\"solid production values\\" and \\"crisp direction,\\" where \\"each moment is crafted and distinct as, layer upon chilly layer, an edifice of terror is painstakingly created.\\" Reviewers also described the special effects as \\"exceptionally effective,\\" \\"jaw-dropping,\\" and \\"rival[ing] anything you've seen on the big screen.\\" However, many writers also panned It's long length and padding, The Washington Times writer Rick Martin criticizing its lack of scary moments over a four-hour running time. The Miami Herald critic Hal Boedeker wrote that It was padded with the leads dickering around with confronting It, as if it was \\"a monster movie without the heroes confronting \\"the thing;\\"\\" and \\"trite\\" and \\"tasteless\\" dialogue, such as slurs targeted toward the black Mike and the Jewish Stan. Virginia Mann of The Record attributed the long length to the story's repetitive structure, where there are multiple scenes involving one Loser encountering the same villain: \\"After a while, even the scary stuff starts to seem silly.\\" Some reviewers also criticized its out-of-nowhere undeveloped subplots and unexplained concepts, such as the lack of explanation for why only the Loser Clubs and none of the other adults see It's incarnations. Martin noted one plot error in particular: \\"[Bill] still feels responsible for his kid brother's being snatched by Ronald McDeath, and though he wasn't there at the time manages a detailed flashback of his brother's last moments.\\" Some reviewers felt the miniseries failed the capture King's horror style, one of them included Dusty Saunders; he wrote that its terror wasn't \\"unrelenting\\" enough, as some of \\"the scenes and the special effects come across as routine, familiar work from predictable monster movies.\\" He also was an outlier in dismissing the character of Pennywise, writing that he \\"comes across as a berserk, somewhat laughable circus character.\\" = Part one = The most praise came towards It's first part, a common highlight being the performances of the child actors and its development of the Losers. Jonathan Storm described Crane as \\"awkward but adorable\\" and Perkins as having \\"a subtlety to the role that belies her years; her sidelong stare can be full of fear one second, contempt the next.\\" The part had the most \\"impact\\" of the miniseries because it focused on children, a very \\"vulnerable\\" demographic of people, analyzed The San Diego Union writer Robert P. Laurence. Ed Bark of The Dallas Morning News wrote that, \\"We yearn to recapture what they had, and we also wince at the indignities they endured as members of their self-proclaimed \\"Losers' Club.'\\" Tim Funk of The Charlotte Observer explained, \\"Watching them, we can't help but recall our own childhood hurts and fears. But we're also reminded what a soothing salve friendship was.\\" Keller wrote the Losers' bonding \\"never lurch into the sentimental, but are deeply, powerfully moving all the same,\\" also finding the back-and-forth flashback technique to be the miniseries' \\"most effective\\" aspect. However, Bodeker was less favorable towards the story's presentation of juvenile endangerment, made only more \\"distasteful\\" by its \\"hack filmmaking.\\" Mink also called the introduction to the adult losers in the first part \\"ridiculously trite\\" and Bodeker a \\"monotonous\\" setup. = Part two = The second part garnered more criticism, a recurring con being the adult actors. Laurence opined the adult actors were \\"more willing to accept the story on its own terms,\\" thus making the second half less interesting. Storm explained that the adult characters' \\"foolish\\" and \\"spoiled\\" behavior made their problems look more \\"trivial\\" than their younger counterparts, and called their activities less \\"interesting\\" as well: \\"The adults just sit around and eat Chinese food or whine through strange attempts at romance.\\" Mal Vincent felt the adult characters unintentionally looked like \\"psychopaths\\" seeing It's mind images, but also liked the performers of the grown-ups more than most other critics: \\"they do manage, just as importantly, to suggest camaraderie and friendship which, considering they are mostly stars of competing TV series, is an achievement in itself.\\" He also called the premise of adults keeping to a vow they held for thirty years to kill a monster \\"silly.\\" Chapman called Christopher's performance of Eddie \\"embarrassing,\\" while Tucker panned Thomas' performance for being more like his character for The Waltons than a horror novelist. Funk opined the miniseries' final half to be somewhat inferior for being \\"a bit silly at key points,\\" and Tucker disfavored the second part's predictable plot. The ending of the miniseries garnered the most disappointment with critics, even those most favorable toward the miniseries. Bark dismissed it as a \\"hokey, feel-good\\" resolution, Keller called it \\"trite,\\" and Chapman described it as a \\"cop-out\\" as it ruined the \\"epic mind game\\" notion of It being in the characters' heads. It's spider form was particularly derided, called by Chapman a \\"cheap Alien imitation,\\" described by Mann \\"as if it crawled out of a low-budget Japanese monster movie,\\" and by the Richmond Times-Dispatch \\"more laughable than frightening.\\"  Accolades  It was ranked the tenth best television miniseries/film in 1990 by The Orange County Register; and USA Today honored Pennywise the best television clown of 1990, alongside Homey the Clown from In Living Color. Bellis won an award for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Achievement in Music Composition for a mini-series or a Special for his score for It, the first time a composer won the award for a horror production. David Blangsted and Robert F. Shugrue was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Editing for a Single-Camera Miniseries or Special, losing to the Hallmark film Sarah, Plain and Tall (1991). Blangsted and Shugrue did, however, win an Eddie Award for Best Edited Television Work on a Miniseries. Crane was nominated for a Youth in Film award for \\"Best Young Actor Starring in a TV Movie, Pilot, or Special,\\" but lost to Stephen Dorff in Always Remember I Love You. It was nominated for a People's Choice Award for Favorite TV Mini-Series, being defeated by The Civil War (1990).  Later years   Home media  = VHS and LaserDisc = Cover for the mininseries' home release. It first appeared on the VHS release and later DVD and Blu-ray versions. It was released on VHS and LaserDisc in 1991. Warner Home Video released the VHS version in the United Kingdom on August 22, 1991; Samhain, Britain's longest running horror magazine, promoted it with a five-copy giveaway for readers who sent in when the original novel was published. In January 1992, a high-quality, digital-stereo LaserDisc version of It was released in Japan. On February 10, 1993, Warner Home Video released two VHS versions of It: a standard-play-speed set consisting of two tapes, as 193 minutes was too much time for a standard play tape to hold; and a one- tape, lower-quality, extended play-speed version. Houston Chronicle writer Bruce Westbrook considered this a questionable business decision for Warner: The versions were being sold at a high rental price ($79.99); and many retailers were un-equipped to display \\"cumbersome two-tape\\" products or worried about customers not wanting to rent a long two-tape set for just one night. The VHS and LaserDisc releases feature It as originally aired. In 1998, It was re-released on VHS on a single cassette tape and was altered, removing the end credits from part 1 and the opening credits of part 2. These edits carried over to all future releases of the miniseries. = DVD = The 480i DVD version of It was released on October 1, 2002 in the United States, Japan and Mexico; and on September 8, 2017 in Taiwan. It was released on 576i PAL DVD in Denmark on October 4, 2002, Australia on October 22, 2002, Sweden on February 26, 2003, Spain on March 11, 2003, the United Kingdom on August 7, 2006, and Poland on October 17, 2018. Most international DVD versions only include English audio tracks and have subtitles in their respective languages. Exceptions are the Spain release, which includes Spanish and German soundtracks in addition to the English audio; and the Polish edition, which features an audio track of its native language. The Japan and Taiwan releases include subtitles in Japanese, English, Portuguese, Spanish, Korean, traditional Mandarin, and Thai; while the American and Mexican versions include Spanish, English, and French subtitles. The UK DVD features English, French, Italian, Arabic, and Dutch subtitles; the Spain release including those plus Spanish, German, and subtitles for the deaf or hard-of-hearing in English and German languages. The Australian, Danish, and Polish DVDs contain the most subtitle language presets, featuring subtitles in English, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Finnish, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Icelandic, Norwegian, Polish, Romanian, Swedish, Turkish, and a hard-for-hearing set in English. = Blu-ray and digital releases = On April 1, 2012, a full, 720p 193-minute version of It was released to Prime Video.

A limited edition Digibook came out in Germany on January 19, 2018 and included a Blu-ray and DVD disc of It. In the United States and Australia, steelbook editions were released as retailer exclusives. JB Hi-Fi issued It exclusive steelbooks in Australia on January 4, 2017 and September 4, 2019; and Best Buy release exclusive steelbooks in the United States on October 2, 2018 and August 29, 2019. On June 7, 2019 in Italy, the Italian company Cinemuseum issued 400 copies of a Blu-ray of It that included an exclusive lenticular slip, a 44-page booklet, and 5x5 postcards. On July 30, 2019, a Blu-ray version of It including a lenticular slip cover and an offer of cash for purchasing a ticket to see It Chapter Two (2019) was released. All Blu- rays of It at least include an English DTS-HD Master Audio track.

It was also part of an expanded DVD version of the collection that added The Shawshank Redemption (1994), Dreamcatcher (2003), The Green Mile (1999), and Creepshow (1982).  Retrospective opinion and legacy  , on Rotten Tomatoes, the miniseries holds an approval rating of 67% based on , with a weighted average rating of 5.59/10. The site's consensus reads, \\"Though hampered by an uneven second half, It supplies a wealth of funhouse thrills and an idelible turn from Tim Curry as Pennywise.\\" It topped The New York Observer's 2014 list of the best Stephen King miniseries; the source explained that while it was \\"two hours too long,\\" it was still the scariest King miniseries of all time. Many retrospective pieces have spotlighted Curry's version of Pennywise, being called by several publications and scholars as one of the most terrifying clown characters in film and television. In fact, it is \\"widely considered the archetype of the [evil clown] genre,\\" wrote Jessica Glenza. As The Atlantic summarized the terror of the performance and character, \\"He speaks in a kind of singsongy, guttural growl, his teeth are sharp fangs, and the contrast between his comical yellow dungarees and his penchant for ripping off children's limbs is fairly stark.\\" Rolling Stone writer Sean T. Collins described it as \\"the stuff sleepless nights are made of. He gloats, he giggles, he taunts, he devours the scenery like the monster himself devours middle-schoolers ‚Äì and he generally sears his way right into the brain of the viewer.\\" Collins and James Smythe of The Guardian claimed the miniseries to have a cult status, Smythe using Curry's portrayal as the main reason: \\"To this day, it's Pennywise that people turn to if you ask them to picture a scary clown. Far more people than ever read the book have seen pictures of Curry's Pennywise, or have watched clips, or remember their siblings forcing them to watch it with them.\\" Curry's portrayal of the character turned him into a horror icon. As Bloody Disgusting explained, \\"His mixture of pleasant charm with gleeful terror has cemented the character in our minds, filling our slumbers with nightmares.\\" In 2015, the source ranked his version of the clown the best Stephen King villain. Perkins recalled being at Hal-Con \\"and a lot of people wanted to talk about It with me, especially women who really loved Beverly and wanted to be her because they felt like an outcast, and saw her as a character with a lot of strength.\\" However, the other parts of the miniseries have faced more divided opinions. Smythe, while finding the miniseries enjoyable overall, also found the writing to be \\"clunky\\" and the other performances to be \\"soapy.\\" Sandra Harris of Moviepilot noted the miniseries' \\"gorgeous scenery\\" and \\"nice interweaving of flashbacks with the regular scenes,\\" while Ian Jane of DVD Talk and John Campopiano of Bloody Disgusting praised the combination of childhood nostalgia with horror elements. Dan Stephens from the UK website Top 10 Films praised the first part of the miniseries for its story, character development, and suspense. However, he found the second part disappointing, disliking the lack of \\"friendship and togetherness\\" of the main characters that was present during the first part as well as the clich√©d ending. The Mary Sue critic Kate Gardner appreciated It for its camp value, but was disappointed with how the miniseries rejected the \\"character study\\" aspects of the novel to fit the three-hour running time. Rozsa was also one of the few reviewers to dislike the child performers, describing their line delivery as \\"unconvincing.\\" Jonathan Barkin, in a 2016 review, wrote that the first part, while the best of the miniseries, suffered from \\"awkward attempts to tie everything together,\\" where what's only shown is \\"the smallest of snippets and there aren't really any solid connecting lines.\\" He also panned the second part for padding it with uninteresting presentations of the adult Losers. His overall criticisms includes its flashback structure and cheap television look, especially when it came to the spider and the \\"lazy\\" choice of close-up shots for Pennywise's scary faces. There have been several internet memes using gifs of the scene where Pennywise meets Georgie. While King has admitted to enjoying the miniseries, calling it a \\"really ambitious adaptation of a really long book;\\" Wallace, who only read the novel years after finishing It, stated in 2003 that he found the miniseries to be inferior to its source material. In 2015, however, he stated that he \\"was, and am, very, very proud of It.\\" Its commercial success began a wave of miniseries adaptations of Stephen King works, such as The Tommyknockers (1993), another miniseries where Cohen wrote the script; Under the Dome (2013‚Äì15); 11.22.63 (2016); and Rose Red (2002). It also was a heavy part of ABC's later decisions of allowing King to write screenplays of miniseries versions of his works, such as The Stand (1994) and The Shining (1997).  In other media  In 2013, Pennywise made an appearance in an advertisement for organic food company Herbaria that was produced by Andreas Roth with Jung von Matt/Neckar and Tempomedia. The two-part late 2010s film version of It (Chapter One and Chapter Two) feature references to the miniseries. A doll replica of Curry's Pennywise is seen in Chapter One in the scene where Richie encounters a room of clown dolls in the house on Neibolt Street; the doll was also included in the film's trailer. Chapter Two not only features a cameo from Crane, but also Pennywise (portrayed by Bill Skarsg√•rd) reiterating the miniseries line \\"Kiss me, fat boy\\" and the designs of the clownhouse's clown bags having the same pattern as the attire of Curry's Pennywise. Skarsg√•rd stated in an interview about the miniseries, \\"I watched the whole thing, and...it's cute. It's very dated, you know?\\" The 2017 film's Henry Bowers actor Nicholas Hamilton and editor Jason Ballantine admitted to using the miniseries as reference when working on the 2017 version.  Documentary and short film  In May 2017, an Indiegogo campaign was created for ', an independent documentary film about the production and lasting impact of the It miniseries. The project met its crowdfunding goal in June 2017, with production beginning the following month. The film, directed by Chris Griffiths and produced by John Campopiano and Gary Smart, will feature interviews with members of the miniseries' cast and crew, including Tim Curry, Tommy Lee Wallace, Bart Mixon, Seth Green, Richard Thomas, and Emily Perkins. From October 27 to October 28, 2018, at the Scotiabank Convention Centre's 2018 Frightmare in the Falls event, Campopiano held an exhibit of the props, costumes, memorabilia, and behind-the-scenes of It to promote the documentary. On February 22, 2019, an extended trailer for the film was uploaded to YouTube. In August 2018, it was announced that Pennywise: The Story of IT co-producer Campopiano was producing a short alternate history sequel film to the miniseries titled '. The short, directed by Ryan Grulich, features Tony Dakota reprising his role as Georgie Denbrough from the It miniseries, and centers on the idea of how the narrative could have continued had Georgie not been killed by Pennywise. The short also features Ben Heller, who portrayed young Stanley Uris in the miniseries. On August 27, 2018, a teaser trailer for Georgie was uploaded to YouTube. The short premiered at the Boston Underground Film Festival on March 22, 2019 and made its debut online on June 10, 2019 on the Fangoria Facebook page.  Merchandise  From May 22 to May 29, 2015, the company Horror Decor sold Pennywise dolls as part of their Killer Carnival Punks collection that also featured doll versions of the clown from Poltergeist (1982) and Gunther from The Funhouse (1981). Factory Entertainment has released several products based on the miniseries: a lunchbox, a 15\\" Premium Motion Statue of Pennywise with an audio card playing some of Curry's lines, and a plush doll of the clown. The company's Pennywise figure and lunchbox was previewed at the 2017 American International Toy Fair. As part of Mezco Toyz' Living Dead Dolls line, the company sold copies of a 10\\" doll replication of Pennywise from November 2017 to January 2018. On July 25, 2017, HalloweenCostumes.com, in collaboration with Hollywood effects company Immortal Masks, produced and released a 100%-silicone mask of the 1990 version of Pennywise, selling it at a very high price of $899.99. On February 16, 2018, the National Entertainment Collectibles Association released various toys of the miniseries' Pennywise, such as a 2\\" tall scaler mini of Pennywise, an 8\\" bobble head of the character, a 6.5\\" battery-powered Pennywise that moves when exposed to light. The next day (per customer requests), it released a 7\\" \\"ultimate\\" action figure of Pennywise that featured interchangeable hands and four heads as well as balloons and a paper boat for the character to hold. Two more Pennywise figures were released exactly a year later: a second version of the figure that added three new interchangeable heads, a three-dimensional \\"emerging hand\\" book object, and a balloon featuring text saying \\"Turn Back Now;\\" and a 6\\" figure of a Saturday morning cartoon-style design of the clown, included as part of a collection that included similar-looking cartoon figures of Freddy Kreuger, Jason Vorhees, and the 2017 film version of Pennywise. In January 2020, NECA will release an 8\\" \\"clothed action figure\\" of Pennywise where he'll wear a sewed version of his costume; it will have two interchangeable heads and interchangeable hands that includes glove and monster hands. In March 2020, Japanese company Kotobukiya, as the first product of their Dokodemo horror statue series, will release a 3\\" ARTFX figure that replicates It's shower scene, specifically the part when Pennywise comes out of the drain.  Remakes  In 1998, a 52-episode Indian television adaptation of the miniseries, Woh, was broadcast. In September 2004, The WB announced a two-hour telefilm remake of the It miniseries written by Peter Filardi and produced by Mark Wolper, both of whom previously worked on the 2004 version of Salem's Lot. On June 7, 2006, the plan for the project changed into a four-hour miniseries remake of the 1990 adaptation that would air on The Sci-Fi Channel. There were no further announcements.

According to the 2011 census, it had 32 residents.  History  The village grew around the manor, which was first mentioned in 1586 and belonged to the Kƒôstaviƒçiai family. A chapel for the victims of the 1710 plague was built in the cemetery in 1715. The manor was inherited by Jonas Antanas ≈†andys-Rimgaila, who in 1738 bequested his landholdings to the Brotherhood of Saint Roch. According to a legend, he was requested to do so in a dream of his only son, who wanted to become a priest but died young. The Brotherhood established a small monastery, a hospital/shelter for the poor and the disabled, and a church dedicated to Saint Roch. The hospital was intended for 24 people (12 men and 12 women). The village received royal privileges from Augustus III of Poland allowing it to hold regular markets and fairs. Pope Pius VI allowed the village to hold festivals () of Saint Roch and Saint Fabian and even sent relic of Saint Roch. The first church burned down in 1808, but it was rebuilt in 1820. As a reprisal for the Uprising of 1831, Tsarist authorities confiscated majority of the landholdings of the Brotherhood in 1842. No longer able to finance its activities, the Brotherhood dissolved and the hospital was converted into a home for elderly priests. After the Uprising of 1863, Alexander III of Russia signed the order to close the Church of St. Roch and transfer its property to a newly built Orthodox church in Skuodas. Local residents raised money to send 5 men with a petition, signed by 300 people, to Saint Peterburg to convince the Tsar to keep the church open. For a couple of months they organized a constant guard of up to 100 locals to defend the church from Russian policemen. On October 19, 1886, a group of Cossacks, personally commanded by Governor of Kaunas, forcefully captured the church and devastated it. Many were injured and 43 people were arrested. Few of its valuables were taken to Tel≈°iai and Alsƒód≈æiai. The church and adjoining buildings were leveled in 1887. It was the first instance of local resistance to Russification policies, 5 years before the better known Kra≈æiai massacre. The located of the former church is now marked by several crosses carved by local artists in 2006. The village had 132 residents in 1923, 104 residents in 1959, and 38 resident in 1989.

On 25 April 2015, the aircraft rolled sharply just before landing causing a very hard touchdown resulting in substantial damage to the starboard wing and a fire. A go-around was initiated and the aircraft positioned for a second approach attempt but veered off the runway on the second landing. All 102 passengers and crew survived unharmed. Accident At 10:23 local time (07:23 UTC) on 25 April 2015, the A320 operating flight 1878 rolled to the right just before landing on runway 05 at Istanbul and touched down hard from a height of .

The aircraft made a go-around, climbing to an altitude of . During the approach to land on runway 35L, a passenger noticed the damaged wing was on fire. During the second landing, at 10:41 local time (07:41 UTC), the aircraft's right landing gear collapsed and the aircraft spun almost 180¬∞ off the runway. The airport's fire and rescue service attended the aircraft and the fire was extinguished. All on board evacuated the aircraft via the emergency slides. There were no injuries reported. The flight crew claimed that wake turbulence from a Boeing 787 Dreamliner which landed ahead of them may have been the reason for the initial roll and contact with the runway. Following the accident, the airport was temporarily closed, with flights being diverted to Sabiha G√∂k√ßen International Airport or other airports near IST.

He defined the specific technology type of his data centers in a 2010 white paper, coining the term micro modular data center (MMDC) and creating the specific technology. This technology has been used by numerous corporations (including AOL and Virgin Galactic) and governmental entities (including China, Vietnam, and the City of Avondale). Rohrich is also known for his participation in the Armored Combat League (ACL) along with the Society for Creative Anachronism's armoured combat tournaments and events. Early life and education Rohrich was born in 1975 in North Dakota. In 1981, his mother, Helen, divorced his father and the two moved to Minnesota when Rohrich was 7 years old. He was largely raised by his mother and was an only child. At the age of 13, he enrolled in an electronics class at a local junior college. In 1990, a 16-year-old Rohrich was sent to live with his father in Mesa, Arizona. He attended Red Mountain High School in Mesa and worked as a dishwasher at a local Shoney's restaurant. After graduating high school, Rohrich moved in with Sean Delaney, a music producer who had once worked with the rock band, KISS. Rohrich also attended Northern Arizona University for a year before dropping out to pursue a career in data center production. Business career Rohrich's career began when longtime friend and fellow inventor, Bill Woodbury, approached him with an entrepreneurial opportunity in 2004. Woodbury and Rohrich co-founded Elliptical Mobile Solutions in 2005 with Mike Chaput and Joe Robbins. The company was started in a garage in Phoenix, Arizona, but moved to a permanent location in Chandler, Arizona in 2009. Their primary goal was the production of micro-modular data centers that were both mobile and extremely durable. They also constructed items for computer and server safety and organization. The first \\"prototype\\" data center was built inside an RV that allowed Rohrich and his team to drive it around to investors. The S.P.E.A.R. (Self-Propelled Electronic Armored Rack) was the initial micro-modular data center produced by Elliptical Mobile Solutions. Rohrich and Woodbury collaborated on the construction, research, and schematics of the machine. The model was featured in a 2008 episode of the Discovery Channel series, Smash Lab where tests showed that it could withstand up to 1,900 degrees (Fahrenheit) of heat. The 27-inch wide S.P.E.A.R. was fitted with wheels and was also designed to hold 1,000 pounds of equipment while being completely waterproof. From left to right, R.A.S.E.R. HD, R.A.S.E.R. DX, C3-S.P.E.A.R., and S.H.I.E.L.D. Rohrich was also instrumental in the production of many of the company's other technologies, including: * S.H.I.E.L.D. (Structurally Hardened I/0 Locking Device) - a weatherproof connection panel for computers. * C-S.P.E.A.R. - a smaller version of the original S.P.E.A.R. * R.A.S.E.R. (Relocatable, Adaptive, Suspension, Equipment Rack) - a variation of the portable, rackable data center with internal cooling in a 42U, fireproof enclosure. * R.A.S.E.R. HD (Relocatable, Adaptive, Suspension, Equipment Rack, High Density) - a 42U enclosure capable of handling IT loads of 80 kW and equipped with a \\"warm-water\\" (65¬∞ to 85 ¬∞F) cooling system. The City of Avondale, Arizona was one of the first entities to purchase a device (the C-S.P.E.A.R.) from Elliptical Mobile Solutions. In 2010, Rohrich wrote a white paper detailing the data center technology and seeking a market for the S.P.E.A.R. units. The company also acquired its fourth patent in 2010. In that same year, Rohrich traveled with Woodbury and Elliptical CEO, Bill Stockwell, to Hanoi to give presentations at the Vietnam Internet Network Information Center. Vietnam's technology and communications ministry designated Elliptical as the company they'd use for micro-modular data centers. By 2011, most of the units the company had sold had gone to governmental agencies, including those in Canada and the Hopi Nation. In January 2011, Rohrich was a guest speaker at Data Center 2011, an annual conference held in Israel. In 2012, Rohrich helped oversee a partnership between Elliptical Mobile Solutions and AOL. AOL began using the R.A.S.E.R. HD units for its own outdoor micro data centers. In 2012, AOL's outdoor R.A.S.E.R. HD units were able to withstand the high winds and rain of Hurricane Sandy. Rohrich also helped facilitate a partnership between Elliptical, Virgin Galactic, and the Federal Aviation Administration to help test radiation levels for commercial spaceflight in 2013. The R.A.S.E.R. HD units were used because they could use more data without taking up space or requiring the construction of a new supercomputer.

Description Melaleuca subtrigona is a shrub which grows to a height of with branches that are covered with fine hairs. Its leaves are arranged alternately, long and wide. They are covered with fine, silky hairs, are linear to narrow oval shaped, oval in cross section and have distinct, slightly raised oil glands. The flowers are a shade of pink to purple and are arranged in heads on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering. The heads contain 2 to 6 groups of flowers in threes and are up to in diameter. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flowers and each bundle contains 3 to 7 (but mostly 3) stamens. Flowering occurs between August and January and is followed by fruit which are woody capsules long in loose clusters. Wagin Taxonomy Melaleuca subtrigona was first formally described in 1844 by Johannes Conrad Schauer in Plantae Preissianae. The specific epithet (subtrigona) is from the Ancient Greek word trigonos meaning triangular and the prefix sub- meaning ‚Äúunder‚Äù referring to the shape of the leaves as being almost triangular in cross-section. Distribution and habitat Melaleuca sieberi occurs in and between the Brookton, Stirling Range and Ravensthorpe districts in the Avon Wheatbelt, Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest, Mallee and Swan Coastal Plain biogeographic regions.

Maxwell was the co-owner of British International Pictures, which emerged as the largest British studio following the Film Act of 1927. Maxwell was a Scottish lawyer who first came into contact with the film industry in 1912. In 1927 he took over the newly- constructed British National Studios in Elstree after its founders ran into financial problems. Maxwell built a vertically integrated company incorporating film production, film distribution, initially through Wardour Films, and a large network of cinemas (ABC Cinemas) that enabled the company to compete with the leading German and Hollywood firms. Along with the facilities in Elstree, the company also acquired Welwyn Studios in Welwyn Garden City. With BIP (which was renamed Associated British Picture Corporation in 1933) John Maxwell began a major production programme. Maxwell imported top filmmakers from Europe as well as signing up leading British talent such as Alfred Hitchcock. Under Maxwell's leadership BIP produced several masterpieces of late silent cinema. With Hitchcock's Blackmail (1929) the company successfully made the transition to sound. While it continued to make some more expensive films, it increasingly relied on large numbers of medium or low-budget comedies and musicals aimed at the British rather than the international market. By the mid-1930s BIP had been overtaken by its rival Gaumont British as the largest British producer. Maxwell bought a stake in Gaumont, intending this as a first step to a takeover that would allow him to merge the two companies to create a giant firm. However, he discovered that he had acquired non-voting shares, which brought him no actual control over the company. He took legal action and a court case followed. Maxwell died in 1940. A giant British studio, similar to that envisaged by Maxwell, was created soon afterwards as J. Arthur Rank's Rank Organisation.

It was a single-seat, single-engined, pusher monoplane. A single prototype was under construction in 1940, but work was abandoned due to the German invasion. Design and development The Dutch shipbuilding company NV Koninklijke Maatschappij De Schelde of Vlissingen entered the aviation business in 1935, when it recruited most of the technical staff, including Chief Designer T. E. Slot, of Pander & Son, which had failed in 1934. Early designs built by De Schelde were the De Schelde Scheldemusch, a lightweight single-seater pusher biplane powered by a Praga B engine, and the Scheldemeeuw, a flying boat version of the Scheldemusch.Beeling Air International December 2015, pp. 73‚Äì74. In 1938, Slot started design work on two more advanced types which also followed Slot's preferred pusher configuration, the De Schelde S.20, a light cabin monoplane, and the S.21, a single-seat fighter, with construction of prototypes for both types beginning in early 1939.Beeling Air International December 2015, p. 74. The S.21 was a low-wing cantilever monoplane of all-metal construction. It featured an inverted gull wing, with the aircraft's tail carried on twin booms.Green 1961, p. 98. The compact fuselage nacelle carried the pilot, engine and the aircraft's armament. The pilot sat in a heavily glazed cockpit in the nose of the nacelle, with the engine, a Daimler-Benz DB 600Ga liquid-cooled inverted V12 engine rated at for takeoff and at at , driving a three-bladed propeller was situated immediately behind the pilot. Slot recognized that to allow the pilot to bail out from the aircraft, the propeller would have to be jettisoned. A mechanism for doing this had yet to be decided on when work on the aircraft stopped. The engine was cooled by a radiator in the nose of the aircraft below the cockpit. A nosewheel undercarriage was fitted. Its armament consisted of a single Madsen 23 mm cannon on a flexible mount in the nose, together with four 7.9 mm FN-Browning machine guns in the side of the nacelle. The cannon was intended to be fixed during air-to-air combat, and during ground strafing operations, it would be released and aimed manually by the pilot, with an automatic stabilizing system controlling the aircraft's ailerons and elevators to aid the pilot in keeping control of the aircraft while busy aiming and firing the cannon.Beeling Air International December 2015, p. 75. The prototype S.21 was almost complete when Germany invaded the Netherlands in May 1940, with the De Schelde factory and the prototype S.21 being seized by German troops. Development was abandoned, with the prototype being tested to destruction at Utrecht. Although abandoned, artist impressions of the S.21 were presented in the wartime aviation press as the fictional Focke-Wulf Fw 198.

Guitarist Gared O‚ÄôDonnell commented on the transition between labels, stating: \\"Right after Up in Them Guts [2004] came out, other labels expressed interest.

The tunnelling units were occupied in offensive and defensive mining involving the placing and maintaining of mines under enemy lines, as well as other underground work such as the construction of deep dugouts for troop accommodation, the digging of subways, saps (a narrow trench dug to approach enemy trenches), cable trenches and underground chambers for signals and medical services.The Tunnelling Companies RE , access date 25 April 2015 Background By January 1915 it had become evident to the BEF at the Western Front that the Germans were mining to a planned system. As the British had failed to develop suitable counter- tactics or underground listening devices before the war, field marshals French and Kitchener agreed to investigate the suitability of forming British mining units. Following consultations between the Engineer-in-Chief of the BEF, Brigadier George Fowke, and the mining specialist John Norton-Griffiths, the War Office formally approved the tunnelling company scheme on 19 February 1915. Norton-Griffiths ensured that tunnelling companies numbers 170 to 177 were ready for deployment in mid-February 1915.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 49. In the spring of that year, there was constant underground fighting in the Ypres Salient at Hooge, Hill 60, Railway Wood, Sanctuary Wood, St Eloi and The Bluff which required the deployment of new drafts of tunnellers for several months after the formation of the first eight companies. The lack of suitably experienced men led to some tunnelling companies starting work later than others. The number of units available to the BEF was also restricted by the need to provide effective counter-measures to the German mining activities.Peter Barton/Peter Doyle/Johan Vandewalle, Beneath Flanders Fields - The Tunnellers' War 1914-1918, Staplehurst (Spellmount) (978-1862272378) p. 165. To make the tunnels safer and quicker to deploy, the British Army enlisted experienced coal miners, many outside their nominal recruitment policy. The first nine companies, numbers 170 to 178, were each commanded by a regular Royal Engineers officer. These companies each comprised 5 officers and 269 sappers; they were aided by additional infantrymen who were temporarily attached to the tunnellers as required, which almost doubled their numbers. The success of the first tunnelling companies formed under Norton-Griffiths' command led to mining being made a separate branch of the Engineer-in-Chief's office under Major-General S.R. Rice, and the appointment of an 'Inspector of Mines' at the GHQ Saint-Omer office of the Engineer-in-Chief. A second group of tunnelling companies were formed from Welsh miners from the 1st and 3rd Battalions of the Monmouthshire Regiment, who were attached to the 1st Northumberland Field Company of the Royal Engineers, which was a Territorial unit. The formation of twelve new tunnelling companies, between July and October 1915, helped to bring more men into action in other parts of the Western Front. Most tunnelling companies were formed under Norton-Griffiths' leadership during 1915, and one more was added in 1916. On 10 September 1915, the British government sent an appeal to Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand to raise tunnelling companies in the Dominions of the British Empire. On 17 September, New Zealand became the first Dominion to agree the formation of a tunnelling unit. The New Zealand Tunnelling Company arrived at Plymouth on 3 February 1916 and was deployed to the Western Front in northern France.Anthony Byledbal, \\"New Zealand Tunnelling Company: Chronology\\" (online ), access date 5 July 2015 A Canadian unit was formed from men on the battlefield, plus two other companies trained in Canada and then shipped to France. Three Australian tunnelling companies were formed by March 1916, resulting in 30 tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers being available by the summer of 1916. Unit history Formation 175th Tunnelling Company was formed at Terdeghem in April 1915, and moved soon after into the Railway Wood-Hooge-Armagh Wood area of the Ypres Salient. From its formation until August 1917 the company served under Third Army.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 20. Hooge 1915 As part of their continued operations against the Ypres Salient after the Second Battle of Ypres and the Battle of Bellewaarde, the German forces kept seeking to gain the village of Hooge between 24 May and 3 June 1915.Battlefields 14-18, undated, accessed 16 February 2007 In the grounds of the Ch√¢teau de Hooge was a German strongpoint which was proving particularly troublesome to the British forces defending the area. The redoubt had in fact been started by the British but had fallen into German hands.http://www.webmatters.net/belgium/ww1_hooge.htm access date 24 April 2015 Major S. H. Cowan, commanding officer of 175th Tunnelling Company, described the situation at Hooge in June 1915: \\"There is some urgent [mining] work to be done at once in a village [Hooge] on a main road east of Ypres. We hold one half and the job is to get the G[ermans] out of the other, failing that they may get us out and so obtain another hill top from which to overlook the land. It is a significant fact that all their recent attacks round Ypres have been directed on hill tops and have rested content on the same, without trying really hard to advance down the slopes towards us.\\"Peter Barton/Peter Doyle/Johan Vandewalle, Beneath Flanders Fields - The Tunnellers' War 1914-1918, Staplehurst (Spellmount) (978-1862272378) pp. 148‚Äì154. In order to break the stalemate, the 175th Tunnelling Company (which was at the time operating with the 3rd Division) dug a tunnel about long under the German position and placed a mine there. This occurred during a time of relative quiet on the British part of the Western Front, when few major assaults were made. Nonetheless, the average casualty rate for the British and Commonwealth forces was around 300 per day.Hooge on ww1battlefields.co.uk, accessed 25 April 2015 The officer in charge of laying the mine at Hooge was Lieutenant Geoffrey Cassels. He wrote: \\"[Hooge] was a small village in ruins on top of the ridge, Hooge meaning height, astride the Menin Road. On the north side of the road was a chateau with a separate annex standing in its own grounds by a large wood. Behind the chateau was Bellewarde Lake. In front of the chateau and east of the village proper were the racing stables (...). The stables were at the very apex of the salient. They were actually in our front line. The trenches were shallow and primitive, even the front line ones, and to reach the front lines some tunnels had been driven under the road and part of the ruins. No Man's Land between us and the Germans was littered with blackened corpses (...) and the stink was abominable. (...) Our objective was to sink a shaft, then tunnel under the chateau and annex and blow them up.\\" The work was completed in five and a half weeks. The first attempt at tunnelling for the mine, starting from within a stable, failed because the soil was too sandy. A second shaft was sunk from the ruins of a gardener's cottage nearby. The main tunnel was in the end long, with a branch off this after about , this second tunnel running a further on. The intention was to blow two charges under the German concrete fortifications, although the smaller tunnel was found to be off course. The explosive ‚Äì used for the first time by the British ‚Äì was ammonal supported by gunpowder and guncotton, making the Hooge mine the largest mine of the war thus far built. The main difficulties for the tunnellers were that the water table is very high, and that the clay expands as soon as it comes into contact with the air. At 07.00 p.m. on 19 July 1915 the mine was fired. The explosion created a hole some deep and almost wide. The far side of the crater was then taken and secured by men from the 1st Battalion, Gordon Highlanders and 4th Battalion, Middlesex Regiment. Ten of the latter were killed by debris from the mine as they waited in advanced positions. The mine fired by 175th Tunnelling Company at Hooge on 19 July 1915 was only the second British offensive underground attack in the Ypres Salient. On 17 April 1915, 173rd Tunnelling Company had blown five mines at Hill 60 using gunpowder and guncotton, but none of these mines were even half as powerful as the Hooge charge.Peter Barton/Peter Doyle/Johan Vandewalle, Beneath Flanders Fields - The Tunnellers' War 1914-1918, Staplehurst (Spellmount) (978-1862272378) p. 148-154, in particular p. 152. The Germans tried to recover their lost position but were driven back by infantry and a heavy artillery bombardment. By 30 July the German units had managed to take control of the Ch√¢teau de Hooge and the surrounding area. In November 1915, 177th Tunnelling Company arrived at Hooge and continued mining there in the defence of Ypres until August 1917. Fighting in the area continued until 1918, with the Hooge Crater (craters being strategically important in relatively flat countryside) frequently changing sides. Messines 1916/17  Map of the mines laid before the Battle of Messines, 1917 Spanbroekmolen crater in November 2009. It was created in 1917 by one of the mines in the Battle of Messines. It is also known as \\"Lone Tree Crater\\" or \\"Pool of Peace\\". 175th Tunnelling Company was extended to the Hill 60 in July 1915, when 172nd Tunnelling Company moved into its place at The Bluff. Deep mining under the German galleries beneath Hill 60 began in late August 1915 with the 175th Tunnelling Company which started a gallery behind the British front line and passed beneath the German positions. The British underground works consisted of an access gallery (nicknamed Berlin Tunnel) leading to two mine chambers called Hill 60 A (beneath Hill 60) and Hill 60 B (beneath The Caterpillar). The 3rd Canadian Tunnelling Company took over in April 1916 and completed the galleries, the Hill 60 mine being charged with of explosives in July 1916 and a branch gallery under the Caterpillar filled with a charge in October. The 1st Australian Tunnelling Company took over in November 1916 and maintained the mines at Hill 60 over the winter. Meanwhile, the bulk of 175th Tunnelling Company had moved briefly to Spanbroekmolen in April 1916. Also in April 1916, 175th Tunnelling Company took over work on the deep mines at Kruisstraat from 3rd Canadian Tunnelling Company. 175th Tunnelling Company continued to drive the galleries forward and when the main tunnel reached it was handed over to 171st Tunnelling Company who were also responsible for Spanbroekmolen. As part of the prelude to the Battle of Messines, deep mine galleries were dug by the British 171st, 175th and 250th Tunnelling companies and the 1st Canadian, 3rd Canadian and 1st Australian Tunnelling companies, while the British 183rd, 2nd Canadian and 2nd Australian Tunnelling companies built dugouts (underground shelters) in the Second Army area. The mines at Messines were detonated on 7 June 1917, creating craters. Vimy Ridge Having handed over its share of the work at Messines, 175th Tunnelling Company moved to Vimy, an area of busy underground activity for much of the war. British tunnellers took over progressively from the French between February and May 1916.The Durand Group: Vimy Ridge online, access date 2016-08-03 Other units active around Vimy in addition to 175th Tunnelling Company were 172nd, 176th, 182nd, 184th, 185th\\"durandvimy\\" and 255th Tunnelling Companies. From spring 1916, the British had deployed five tunnelling companies along the Vimy Ridge, and during the first two months of their tenure in the area, 70 mines were fired, mostly by the Germans. Between October 1915 and April 1917 an estimated 150 French, British and German charges were fired in this sector of the Western Front. In May 1916, a German infantry attack, which forced the British back , was aimed at neutralising British mining activity by capturing the shaft entrances. From June 1916, however, the Germans withdrew many miners to work on the Hindenburg Line and also for work in coal mines in Germany. In the second half of 1916 the British constructed strong defensive underground positions, and from August 1916, the Royal Engineers developed a mining scheme to support a large-scale infantry attack on the Vimy Ridge proposed for autumn 1916, although this was subsequently postponed. After September 1916, when the Royal Engineers had completed their network of defensive galleries along most of the front line, offensive mining largely ceased although activities continued until 1917. The British gallery network beneath Vimy Ridge eventually grew to a length of . In October 1916, 175th Tunnelling Company moved away again from the Vimy sector and returned to the Ypres Salient. Lettenberg Bunkers 175th Tunnelling Company then deployed to Loker, about two miles west of Kemmel and near Wijtschate, where it constructed bunkers. Known as the Lettenberg Bunkers, they are located at the edge of a woodland along the road from Kemmel, climbing up a hill towards Loker. These fortifications were constructed in the spring of 1917, although the 175th Tunnelling Company had been digging to create underground headquarters here for some months before that. There are four bunkers, including a first aid post which has a red cross painted on the wall, and a command post located at the far end. There are information boards outside the bunkers. Hermies 1918 Destroyed the entrance inclines to Hermies catacombs in March 1918, as the enemy advanced from Cambrai. Somme 1918 Built bridges over the Ancre in the British advanced on the Somme in Autumn 1918.

Early years Mann was born in Rockhampton, Queensland, to parents William Joseph and his wife Janet (n√©e Low) and was educated at Mount Morgan Boys Central School. He worked at a variety of jobs including stockman, wharfie, meatworker, and cane cutter before moving to Brisbane during late years of the depression.The Speakers of the Queensland Parliament, 1957‚Äì1989 -- Australian National University. Retrieved 26 April 2015. Political career In January 1936, the Labor member for the state seat of Brisbane, Robert Funnell, unexpectedly died. Mann was chosen by the party to contest the April by-election which he easily won and went on to represent the electorate for over 33 years until his retirement from politics on 17 May 1969. Mann was Chairman of Committees from 3 Aug 1944 until 10 Oct 1950 at which time he was appointed Speaker of the Queensland Parliament. He ran the Office of the Speaker with forceful dignity and years later he advised \\"you never forget you're the boss, and you never let anyone else forget you‚Äôre the boss\\". Mann's time as Speaker ended with Labor's defeat at the 1957 state election. Mann's reputation as a drinker and gambler was legendary and his time in Parliament was not without controversy. Mann was once caught in a police raid on an illegal baccarat school in South Brisbane. After being attacked by his opponents in the Assembly over the issue, he explained to the House that as a conscientious member of Parliament he was monitoring the illegal casino with a plan to exposing its activities when the police arrived. Another incident occurred when his chauffeur-driven official limousine had an accident revealing the fact that he was using the vehicle to transport a racing greyhound. After his retirement from Parliament a former member of the Nicklin Ministry noted that \\"there were few crimes [Mann] has not, at some time committed\\". After allegations that Mann had been involved in a corrupt tendering process in relation to sewerage contracts at Redcliffe, A royal commission was established to investigate the matter but in the end, Mann was exonerated. Loyalty and mateship were important to Mann though. In 1972, he handed back his life membership of the Labor Party after they disendorsed sitting members Ed Casey, Col Bennett, and Merv Thackeray. Personal life Mann married Ellen Maria Hansen on the 25 June 1919 and together had one son and seven daughters. He was a member of the Royal Antediluvian Order of Buffaloes and head and life member of the Caledonian Society. A generous benefactor of the disadvantaged, Mann gave a substantial part of his parliamentary salary to the poorer residents of Spring Hill during the depression of the late 1930s. Mann died at Brisbane in early January, 1973.

The comedy series is directed by Sirous Moghaddam and Mohsen Tanabandeh is the author and the main actor of this series.Paytakht in the Tvdb Plot Paytakht Season 1 (2011) A family from the town of Aliabad in Mazandaran are planning to move to Tehran, the capital of Iran. After arriving, they find the previous owner of the home laying dead in his bed. Legal issues caused from his death prevent the family from settling into their home, forcing Naghi Mamouli and his family to live in his cousin Arastou's truck. During the time the Mamouli family live in the truck, they find themselves in strange and confusing events. Paytakht Season 2 (2013) Naghi goes to work one day and receives an assignment from his boss. Naghi must transport a newly made dome and two minarets to Qeshm Island in the south of Iran, to build a mosque there for the residents. He takes his family, his cousin Arastou, and a young woman named Miss Fadavi, who is an acquaintance of Naghi's boss. They all agree to take the dome and minarets to Qeshm in Arastou's truck. Miss Fadavi becomes a love interest for Arastou, resulting in many awkward but funny moments during the week long journey. Paytakht Season 3 (2014) Arastou 'falls in love' with a young girl by the name of Miss Tehrani. He wants to hold his wedding at Naghi's home but the home is still under construction. Naghi lets him hold the wedding there anyway, and ignores his worker Mousa's request to build a pillar underneath the house to prevent it collapsing. On the night of the wedding, disaster strikes and the house collapses during the celebrations. Many people are injured and this ends Arastou's short lived marriage. These series of events result in Naghi losing his job and falling into depression. Naghi and Musa are forced to live in the home of his sister, Fahimeh. To give him a boost, Naghi decides to enter a national tournament in wrestling, his greatest passion. He loses badly to an elderly man by the name of Sohanpaz, causing his depression to become worse and becomes the laughingstock of Mazandaran. During Naghi's cycle of depression, his cousin Arastou reveals to the family that he is engaged to a Chinese woman by the name of Cho Chung, or Raheleh after she converted to Islam. This centers the story around her, and how she travels all the way to Tehran in order to surprise Arastou, causing many troubles along the way. Although they have an argument after Arastou failed to tell her about his previous marriage, they are madly in love and plan to hold their wedding in Turkey. It is revealed that due to Sohanpaz becoming injured, Naghi is now the new contender for the international wrestling championship, to be held in Tehran in a matter of days. He rushes to the stadium to train and finds out he has to lose around 7 kilograms in order to compete in his weight class. Naghi shows determination that had not been seen from him in months. He loses the weight thanks to a very strict diet from his coach and qualifies for the tournament. Thanks to help of his family and friends, Naghi wins the championship finals, beating the United States, Russia, and China for 1st place. Paytakht Season 4 (2015) The Mamouli family face a new set of challenges after Arastou's wife Cho Chung dies in the MH370 plane crash. The season is set one year after the crash, however Arastou is still devastated and continues to mourn her death. Over the year, Arastou has grown out his beard and hair in mourning, alongside wearing black clothes. Naghi has done the same in support of his cousin. However, Naghi becomes tired of his appearance and urges Arastou to end his mourning, trim his beard, and begin to wear his colorful clothes once again. Meanwhile, Naghi's wife Homa becomes a city council member of Aliabad after winning a landslide election. Although Naghi is proud of her, he fears her work life may start to distance her from the family. He begins to despise the city council after Homa begins monitoring his behavior in order to prevent him from embarrassing her with his antics.

Ginny Ross, her cousin Pat Cron, and her best friend Jennie Mae Stevenson sneaked out to watch the takeoff of City of New York. However, the plane crashed, and Ginny was caught. Two days later, Jennie Mae, Llewellyn and Ginny went to search for the plane's owner's dog. They received the reward of a hundred dollars. Ginny let her papa take most of her share to pay for the store's next shipment. Ginny's mom forcefully took the rest for sewing supplies. Later that night, Ginny wrote a letter to Amelia Earhart explaining her situation. One day, Ginny and Jennie Mae decided to make a model of a plane's cockpit with paint and a wooden crate. After nearly two weeks, the model cockpit was completed, and Uncle Harry agreed to teach the girls the basics of aviation. Four weeks after, Ginny received a reply from Amelia Earhart. She went to tell her papa, but found him sleeping. She tried to wake him, but instead, he slipped off the chair. The doctor came, but it was too late. Papa had died. Five months have passed since papa's funeral. Ginny's dad had replaced papa in running the store. While the kettle boiled, Ginny read Amelia's letter again. When the kettle whistled, Ginny left the letter on the table. Her mom picked it up and ripped it, then threw it into the stove. Ginny was told she will quit school and work full-time to keep the family together. Early in the morning, Ginny packed and wrote a letter to Amelia. She borrowed money from Llewellyn and carried it along with the reward money she snuck back from her mom. She went on the train to Port aux Basques. On the train, Ginny met papa's ghost. Papa encouraged her to think some more, and told her she will never be alone. Ginny also met Elizabeth Harris, a friendly woman whose husband recently died. Elizabeth told Ginny she could stay at her house while waiting for the ferry. Ginny felt guilty of lies, and confessed to Elizabeth that she was going to see Amelia Earhart. Later, she met papa again, and told him about her decision. Papa smiled and said he was proud of her. Ginny boarded the ferry early on the seventh day after the train arrived at Port aux Basques. After the ferry arrived at North Sydney, she took the train to Boston. She asked the information desk lady for directions to Amelia's address, but got robbed on the way‚Äîthe lady had given her the wrong directions. On the way to Amelia's house, Ginny saw her other grandparents'‚ÄîMom and Pop Davis's‚Äîhouse. When she rang the bell, Mom Davis opened it and locked her in the bedroom. Ginny used the bedspread to escape. When Ginny arrived at Amelia's house, a lady told her Amelia has not been there for months, and gave her directions to Rye, New York. Ginny, robbed of her money, went to the information lady at the train station for help. The lady helped her sneak onto the train to New York City. In New York City, Ginny asked for directions to Rye, New York. With a map but without money, she had no choice but to walk. She walked for a few hours and slept in a culvert under the road. The next morning, an old lady with a chubby cat noticed Ginny and offered her a ride. Ginny arrived at Rye at two in the afternoon. After a long time of walking in the rain, Ginny finally arrived at Amelia's house. After a bath and clean clothes, she told Amelia her story. Amelia told her that quitting school would only delay her plans, not end them, and promised to be in touch soon. Ginny returned home to find her Nana having a nervous breakdown, her mom at her wit's end, and Billy crying and stealing. However, the atmosphere changed the next morning. Five days later, Uncle Harry announced the season's next flight. On May 20, Bernt Balchen, Ed Gorski, and a third person would fly to Harbour Grace. The name of the third person nor the final destination was announced. Ginny realized the secret person was Amelia Earhart. On the day of Amelia's arrival, Ginny was locked in her bedroom by her mom, but was saved with the keys by Billy. A while after meeting Amelia again, Ginny found her mom bursting into the hotel. Amelia convinced Ginny's mom that Ginny was capable of becoming a pilot. After Amelia departed for her solo transatlantic flight, Ginny anxiously waited for news. The next morning, Uncle Harry announced Amelia's successful landing in Paris. Ginny went to talk to her mom at the store. Her dad found unopened crates of supplies, and the store was in business again. Ginny confessed that she is not the kind of daughter her mom wants, but she will make money by flying and send it home. Her mom said she did not want to lose her, not her help. The Ross family faced every day as it came. Billy began to help at the store. Ginny was taught by her teacher three evenings a week, and was learning faster than Pat and Jennie Mae. She wrote to Elizabeth regularly, and her mom's lecturing and hitting have stopped. Amelia wrote a letter saying she was searching for ways to involve women in aviation, and wanted to partner with a school. Ginny showed the letter to her mom, and she smiled and said she may be proud of her someday.  Reception  Amelia and Me has received editorial reviews from The Telegram, Edwards Book Club, CM Magazine, Resource Links, and Canadian Children's Book News. The Telegram praised the background as \\"rich\\" and \\"solid\\", and Ginny Ross as a \\"great protagonist\\" that \\"brings gumption and momentum to the narrative\\".

He was a star player at Bowling Green from 1989 to 1993, playing under Coach Jim Larranaga. As a player at Bowling Green, Huger was named second-team all-MAC as a junior and first-team all-MAC as a senior. He is 6th all-time on BG's 3-point FG% list. He made two appearances in the National Invitational Tournament as a player. After Bowling Green, Huger played professional basketball in Europe from 1993 to 2005, including Finland, Holland and Belgium. He was the Dutch League MVP in 1996, scoring 25.3 points and adding 5.8 assists and later was First-Team All- Belgium for 2000 and 2004‚Äîboth seasons in which his teams won the Belgium Cup. Upon finishing his playing career, Huger began his coaching career at Longwood University with Mike Gillian, who had been an assistant at Bowling Green under Larranaga. After two years with the Lancers, Huger re-joined Larranaga at George Mason University as an assistant. The Patriots made the post-season in each season Huger coached there, including two NCAA tournament bids. The Patriots also won a regular-season Colonial Athletic Association title and a CAA tournament title. When Larranaga moved to the University of Miami, Huger followed him as an assistant. The Hurricanes won the Atlantic Coast Conference regular-season and tournament title in 2012-13 and advanced to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Basketball tournament. They also qualified for the NIT twice in his four years in Coral Gables, losing in the final of the 2015 tournament. In 2012-13, Huger was the Hurricane's defensive coordinator. The team was nationally ranked No. 39 in scoring defense (60.6) and No. 48 in field goal percentage defense (40.0). Huger was hired as the head coach of the Bowling Green State University men's basketball team on April 15, 2015. After spending his first three years rebuilding the Falcon program, Huger had his best year yet as a head coach. In 2018-19, Huger guided the Falcons to a 22-12 season, including finishing 3rd in the Mid-American Conference and going to the MAC Championship Game, despite the fact that his team had been picked to finish last in the MAC in the pre-season polls. That year, they also set a new record for the most home wins in the Stroh Center era, finishing with a 14-2 record at home. The highlight of the season was the 92-88 upset win over a ranked Buffalo team on February 1st in front of a sold-out crowd on national television. It was the first truly iconic win of the Stroh Center's short history, and it set the tone for the rest of the season. On February 25th, 2020, Huger led Bowling Green to their second straight season with at least 20 wins, a first for the school since 1947-48 and 1948-49.

Among the streetcar suburbs commissioned in 1891 by local businessman Lewis Ginter, Sherwood Park's original design was laid out in 1892 by the firm of acclaimed landscape architect Frederick Law Ulmsted. Due to economic, social and political factors during Ginter's lifetime, Olmsted's elegant design of gently curved streets was never realized. Development of modern Sherwood Park accelerated during the late 1920s and continued through 1940‚Äì1950. Today the community has evolved into a diverse upper-middle-class neighborhood of tree lined streets, bike lanes, a variety of architectural styles and sidewalks throughout.  Origins of the neighborhood  Lewis Ginter, Richmond Financier, Real Estate Developer and Philanthropist Following the Civil War, Lewis Ginter, one of the city's wealthiest residents, initiated several suburban beautification and development projects. He created the Sherwood Land Company in 1891 to promote his various projects. The name Sherwood was taken from an old estate along Brook Turnpike dating from the early 1800s that belong to a New York banker whom Ginter had partnered with after the war. Ginter purchased the Sherwood estate and incorporated it into the Sherwood Park development. Such early suburban street-car communities were created so that business men in downtown Richmond could retreat from the city to the countryside. The first electric street car in the city was installed in 1888. Other developments included Ginter Park, Laburnum Park (developed by the family of Joseph Bryan), and Bellevue (developed by John Pope, Ginter's younger associate and friend). As a respected philanthropist, Ginter notably donated land for the relocation of Union Theological Seminary from Farmville VA to Richmond on land adjacent to the future Sherwood Park. By the time Ginter had initiated these developments, Frederick Law Olmsted, Sr. had established himself as the preeminent landscape architect in the nation. Among Olmsted's notable and lasting achievements was the creation of the gardens at George W. Vanderbilt's massive Biltmore estate in Asheville NC. The Biltmore project led Olmsted to Richmond VA to procure trees, shrubs, and vines at the Franklin Davis & Co. nursery in Richmond. It was there on one of their regular forays through Richmond to Biltmore that an associate of Ginter in the Sherwood Land Company, Edward H. Bissell, met Olmsted in 1888. By then Olmsted was already an enthusiastic proponent of the newly developing suburbs throughout the country. The Sherwood Land Company engaged Olmstead's firm to assist in the development of \\"Brook Turnpike\\", now Brook Rd., which was a wide parkway that connected downtown to Ginter's suburban Northside properties. This initial collaboration between their respective firms established the relationship between Olmsted and Ginter. John Charles Olmsted, Olmsted's nephew, took the lead on the project because of Olmsted's preoccupation with the World's Columbian Exposition and the Biltmore Estate. Frederick Law Olmsted, Sr., American landscape architect By 1891, the Sherwood Park development was on Olmsted's firm's design docket. The earliest plans included a broad tree-lined parkway with irregular curves called Brookland Parkway that even today follows the plans set out in the firm's preliminary drawings. As originally conceived, the parkway would be large enough to accommodate a street-car line in the central median that would not disturb the nearby horse-drawn carriage traffic. The street-cars however were never implemented. The development lots along the development's curving roads varied in size with the largest sites reserved to face Brookland Parkway. There were smaller lots located on the western edge along Hermitage Ave. These smaller lots with easy access to the electric streetcars were part of Olmsted's efforts for people to provide people with modest incomes access to rural conditions. Its final design, with its winding roads, numerous public grounds, access to public transportation, secluded yards and varying lot sizes embodied many of Olmsted's suburban design principles as had been applied to other developments in other states. A number of factors would eventually undermine the creation of Sherwood Park as Olmsted's firm envisioned. The city of Richmond was a racially segregated city and Ginter insisted on a large surrounding fence to keep the large nearby black population out. Olmsted's firm redrew the borders so that a gated community could be built to wall off the site from its unwelcome neighbors. An engineer was hired in 1892 who did not appreciate the artistry of Olmsted's design and the streets were laid out in a more grid-like pattern rather than the more difficult to construct and less economical curves in the original design. Ginter was concerned that as much as 33% of the land was devoted to public use and therefore not salable. The number of large lots were reduced, the smallest lots were eliminated and a large public area in the southwest corner was removed. Apparently Ginter approved these changes and as a consequence there is no evidence of further cooperation between the Sherwood Land Company and Olmsted's firm after 1893. Ginter's health was failing and he appeared to have greater interest in the development of nearby Ginter Park. Moreover, it appeared that Ginter Park was more favored by wealthy whites moving into the suburbs who wanted to avoid the black community in nearby Douglas Court (the current site of Virginia Union University). The financial panic of 1893 contributed to the slow down of the project, and Ginter died in 1897. Development of Sherwood Park remained slow through 1917 while work progressed more rapidly in nearby Ginter Park. The first lot sales in Ginter Place occurred in 1898, more than twenty years before any building in Sherwood Park. Development in Sherwood Park did not begin in earnest until 1926, and only in 1929 was the first model home at 3320 Loxley Road offered for sale. Progress was further hindered by the Great Depression but new construction began during the period from 1930 to 1940. In the 1950s, further changes occurred with the construction of the Richmond‚ÄìPetersburg Turnpike which cut off the southwest corner of the development, an area the Olmsted firm originally planned as a common area with a clubhouse and tennis courts. Little remains in modern Sherwood Park resembling Olmsted's original design. The most notable similarity is the gently curving Brookland Parkway with its luscious crepe myrtle tree borders that dazzle commuters during the summer months. Landscape drawing of Frederick L. Olmsted firm's 1892 plan for Sherwood Park, Richmond VA Westwood Tract  History  In 1887, Dr. Hunter Holmes McGuire acquired a tract of land in the northeastern corner of modern Sherwood Park for his private country retreat. McGuire was personal physician to Stonewall Jackson, Lewis Ginter, and one of the founders of the Medical College of Virginia. In addition, McGuire served on the board of directors of Ginter's Sherwood Land Company. McGuire updated and expanded an existing frame and stucco house located on the site since the 1790s that became known as the McGuire Cottage. McGuire Cottage in 2017 McGuire purchased Westwood in March 1887, then a slightly larger tract in Henrico County, from William Pleasants for $13,500. The land purchased by McGuire had previously been owned by Captain Charles Meriwether, a Union Army Captain and Mexican War Veteran, who sold the parcel to Pleasants on July 21, 1862. By 1890, Ginter had begun plans for a new development to be called Sherwood Park and Westwood was incorporated into the original plan developed by the Sherwood Land Company. Following the death of McGuire in 1900, Union Theological Seminary acquired the cottage and adjoining property for future development. Three historic neighborhoods, Ginter Park, Laburnum Park, and Sherwood Park adjoin the 34-acre park-like tract which lies across the intersection of Brook Rd. and Westwood Ave. from the seminary complex. The historic McGuire Cottage, two abandoned dormitory complexes, and a few other buildings were located within the tract. Grassy lawns, recreational features such as athletic fields and tennis courts, many mature trees, a community walking track, and a meditation labyrinth added to the vibrance and vitality of the neighborhood and to the Seminary. Westwood marker on Brook Rd  Controversy  Following a significant decline in its endowment fund from 1997 to 2009, the Seminary in 2009 began a restructuring plan that involved changing its name to ‚ÄúUnion Presbyterian Seminary‚Äù, cuts in personnel, property and programs, and initiation of a large capital campaign. The western side of the Seminary campus was sold in 1997 to Baptist Theological Seminary Richmond and was subsequently acquired by Veritas School in 2013. In 2014, the Seminary announced a plan to develop the entire Westwood tract with single family housing and rental units. A zoning ordinance passed for the Westwood tract in 1953 by the Richmond City Council gave permission to the Seminary to build multifamily dwellings on the site, according to the standards of the time.Zoning Ordinance No. 53-21-31, City of Richmond, February 9, 1953. While the neighboring communities had enjoyed a cordial relationship with the Seminary since their mutual inception, the residents reacted swiftly to the pending disruption of the historic character of the neighborhood, the prospect of increased urbanization and congestion surrounding the development, and the loss of recreational facilities that were already scarce in the Northside region. Numerous formal community engagement meetings, individual meetings, and city council hearings were held with the local residents. The Seminary decided to limit its original plans by construction of a 300-unit apartment complex on just 15 acres on the eastern section of the site along Brook Rd and adjacent to Ginter Park. Nevertheless, the new plan called for inserting more households onto one block of Brook Road than had been built over a century in all of Sherwood Park, which proved to be unacceptable to the residents who claimed that the revised plan packed in too many dwelling units, would contributed to traffic congestion, and failed to take account of the historic patterns of the surrounding blocks. In April 2017, the president of the Seminary reiterated the Seminary's intention to revive a decades-old plan to develop the tract for the expansion of the Seminary. The plan called for the construction of luxury apartments that would in part provide student housing with the remaining part becoming public housing that would help to subsidize the housing for the Seminary students. The Seminary's stated position was that the development could have a positive effect on the community and provide housing alternatives to a younger generation of families. The final plan called for the remaining 19 acres to remain as community land, a portion of which was reserved for a charitable urban farm. The existing walking track used by a variety of people would be modified but preserved. Sherwood Park and other local residents were not reassured and, despite a last minute court suit and appeals by residents to the mayor and local officials, construction began on the site in the summer of 2017.

The first novel, The Raven Boys, was published by Scholastic in 2012, and the final book, The Raven King, was published on 26 April 2016. Plot The Raven Boys The Raven Cycle follows the story of Blue Sargent, Richard Gansey III, Adam Parrish, Ronan Lynch, and Noah Czerny as they attempt to find the sleeping Welsh king Glendower who is buried on the ley lines of Henrietta, Virginia. The story begins in The Raven Boys with an introduction to Blue and her psychic family members who live at 300 Fox Way. Blue accompanies Neeve, her half-aunt, to a ghost watch where Neeve sees the spirits of the people in Henrietta, Virginia who will die in the coming year. Blue sees the spirit of a boy named Gansey, and Neeve tells her that she will either be his true love or kill him. Later, Blue meets Gansey, Adam, Ronan, and Noah while she's working at Nino's pizzeria. She learns of their quest and, despite a bad introduction, joins them in finding Glendower. They discover a forest called Cabeswater that exists out of time and speaks to them in Latin. Adam sacrifices his free will to become the hands and eyes of Cabeswater and Ronan reveals that he can take things out of his dreams. The Dream Thieves The second book in the series, The Dream Thieves, focuses on Ronan's ability to take things from his dreams. A hit-man called the Gray Man, who killed Ronan's father, comes to Henrietta under the orders of a man named Colin Greenmantle looking for something called the Greywaren. It's revealed that the Greywaren is not an object, but a name for Ronan and his father, Niall Lynch who dreamed almost everything from Ronan's childhood, including Ronan's mother. Cabeswater vanishes, and another teenage boy called Joseph Kavinsky reveals that he can take things out of his dreams as well. Kavinsky abuses the ability to steal from his dreams, and with both boys taking things out of their dreams, they stress the energy of Cabeswater. Blue's mother, Maura and the Gray Man fall for each other, but the Gray Man runs from Henrietta claiming he stole the Greywaren so that Ronan will be safe from Greenmantle. Adam restores energy to the ley line with the help of Persephone, a psychic at 300 Fox Way. They bring back Cabeswater, and Ronan uses one of his night terrors to fight Kavinsky and his fire dragon, eventually ending Kavinsky's life. With his father's will stating that he cannot visit the home he grew up in, Ronan dreams up a new will so he can return to his sleeping mother. Blue reads a note saying that her mother is underground. Blue Lily, Lily Blue In the third book of the series, Blue Lily, Lily Blue, Blue's mother Maura leaves to look for Artemus, Blue's birth father in a cave. Persephone continues to help Adam learn how to fix the ley lines the way Cabeswater has asked. Calla, another psychic, tries to contact Maura with her abilities. She tells Blue and the boys of three sleepers in the caves and warns them not to wake the third sleeper. Colin Greenmantle becomes the Latin teacher at Aglionby, and Adam and Ronan plan to drive him out of Henrietta. Blue and Gansey find another cave in the backyard of a man named Jesse Dittley, who was one of the spirits Neeve saw in the graveyard and in the cave, they find a woman named Gwenllian, Glendower's daughter. Persephone dies in an attempt to find Maura, and Adam and Ronan blackmail Greenmantle into leaving. Greenmantle's wife Piper hires thugs and goes to Jesse Dittley's cave where she kills Dittley, captures the Gray Man, and enters the cave. The teens and Gwenllian go to the Cabeswater cave where they find animal skeletons that they collectively wake up. Blue and Ronan find a magic lake where after crossing the lake, Blue finds Maura and Artemus. Blue, Artemus, Maura, and the Gray Man escape, leaving Piper and the thug in the collapsed cave, where Neeve finds Piper who wakes up the third sleeper. The Raven King The fourth and final installation of The Raven Cycle is entitled The Raven King. Gansey, Adam, Ronan, Noah, and Blue continue their quest to find the Welsh King Glendower. While Piper wakes up the third sleeper, a demon with the power to \\"unmake\\", the boys and Blue race to save Cabeswater. Setting Much of the story takes place in the fictional town of Henrietta, Virginia, which sits directly on top of a powerful ley line. Adam, Ronan, Blue, Noah, and Gansey repeatedly return to the mysterious Cabeswater, a forest that exists out of its own time and that talks to the group in Latin. Adam, Ronan, and Gansey all attend school at Aglionby Academy, an all-boys school that is very expensive. Ronan's childhood home is called The Barns, and it's where he discovers his mother is one of his father's dream creations. 300 Fox Way is the home of Blue and the multitude of psychic women in Henrietta. Monmouth Manufacturing is the abandoned and gutted warehouse in which Gansey, Ronan, and Noah reside, as well as the place where Malory and his service dog stay during their visit. Some of the story takes place in the caves that are underneath Cabeswater where Glendower is supposedly sleeping.  Major characters   Blue Sargent  Blue Sargent is the daughter of a psychic named Maura, and lives with her and other psychic women at their home, 300 Fox Way. Despite not having psychic abilities of her own, Blue is able to amplify the energy of other psychics and supernatural beings. She works at a restaurant called Nino's and desperately wants to travel the world and help others. The psychic women that live with her have told her that if she ever kisses her true love, he will die.  Maura Sargent  Maura is the psychic mother of Blue and she typically uses Tarot cards to make her readings. She usually wears her trademark tattered jeans, and has a penchant for going barefoot. She falls in love with the Gray Man, and later disappears underground, supposedly in search of Artemus, Blue's biological father.  Richard Campbell Gansey III  Called Gansey by his friends, Richard Campbell Gansey III is a student at Aglionby who has been on a journey to find the sleeping Welsh king Glendower that he believes saved his life seven years prior. Gansey's allergy to bee stings caused him to die seven years ago from a hornet sting, but he was saved by Glendower. Gansey drives an orange Camaro called the Pig.  Adam Parrish  Adam Parrish is a student at Aglionby who struggles financially, but doesn't want Gansey's pity. At the beginning of the story, he lives with his mother and his abusive father in a trailer, but later he stands up for himself by pressing charges against his father and moves into an apartment above St. Agnes church. He sacrificed his free will to Cabeswater, promising to fix the ley lines and help restore Cabeswater. As of \\"The Raven King\\", he is in a relationship with Ronan Lynch. Adam is deaf in his left ear.  Ronan Lynch  Ronan Lynch is described as \\"dangerous as a shark and about as friendly.\\" Cabeswater calls him the Greywaren, which is revealed to be a person who can take things out of their dreams. Ronan uses this ability to try and help wake up his mother and the livestock from his childhood home, all of which are things that Niall Lynch took out of his own dreams. He helps Adam create fake evidence against Greenmantle in order to blackmail him into leaving Henrietta. As of \\"The Raven King\\", he is in a relationship with Adam Parrish. Ronan is the central character in a companion series called The Dreamer Trilogy, which takes places after the events of The Raven King and Opal.  Noah Czerny  Noah Czerny was a student at Aglionby, but Barrington Whelk, the old Latin professor, used him as a sacrifice in a failed attempt to wake up the ley lines. He relies on energy of the ley lines or Blue Sargent in order to stay substantial. Over the course of the series, it is revealed that his spirit is decaying and he needs more energy in order to look normal. On his final appearance he sacrifices the memories his friends have of him in order to save Gansey's life.  Colin Greenmantle  Colin Greenmantle is a collecter of mysterious artifacts and the employer of the Gray Man. He sent the Gray Man to kill Ronan Lynch's father and then sends the Gray Man to find the Greywaren. He comes to Henrietta under the guise of Aglionby's new Latin teacher so that he can find the Greywaren himself after the Gray Man betrays him. He leaves Henrietta and returns to Boston, leaving his wife Piper alone in Jesse Dittley's cave.  The Gray Man (Mr. Gray)  The Gray Man is a hit-man hired by Greenmantle initially to steal something called the Greywaren. While in Henrietta, he takes a liking to the town and falls in love with Blue's mother Maura, who likes him back. He leaves Henrietta to protect Ronan, but returns when he discovers that Greenmantle came back. He enjoys Anglo-Saxon poetry and recites poems from memory occasionally throughout the story. Glendower Glendower is the Welsh king that allegedly saved Gansey's life seven years before the story takes place. Throughout the story, the characters talk about and refer Glendower, even though they do not directly interact with him. If the teenagers find Glendower and wake him up, they believe he will grant them a favor. Other characters The Psychics At 300 Fox Way, a multitude of psychics come into play, including Orla, Neeve, Persephone, Calla, and Jimi. These women all use their abilities to help the group of teenagers find their way to Glendower, as well as using their abilities to make a living. Artemus One of Glendower's followers and Blue's biological father. Blue had never met him until she found and rescued him from the cave underneath Cabeswater. At 300 Fox Way, he shuts himself in a closet because he is terrified of Gwenllian. Gwenllian Gwenllian is the daughter of Glendower and is discovered face down in a stone coffin in Jesse Dittley's cave. She continuously speaks in riddles and sings randomly. She and Blue are alike in that they don't have normal psychic abilities but rather they mirror others abilities. Henry Cheng An Aglionby student of Korean and Chinese descent who is friends with Gansey and later befriends Blue, while Adam and Ronan don't seem fond of him. Throughout The Raven King his bond with Gansey and Blue is strengthened and he's present in various important passages. By the end of the series Henry, Gansey and Blue are out for an (at least) year long journey. Joseph Kavinsky Referred to as Kavinsky, he has the same power as Ronan to pull things out of his dreams. He uses this ability to steal from his dreams, whereas Ronan asks for things. Kavinsky likes to race Ronan and has a field full of replicas of the same car. He uses his ability for his own selfish purposes and eventually dies because of a fire dragon he took from a dream. Jesse Dittley A minor character, Jesse Dittley's name is on the list of people that Neeve saw at the beginning of the story in the graveyard indicating his death within twelve months. Later, Blue and Gansey meet him and convince him to let them explore his cave, even though Dittley tells them that his family is cursed by it. In the cave, they find Gwenllian, and later Dittley reveals that strange creatures have been coming out of the cave, sometimes coming into the house. Piper Greenmantle kills him in order to enter the cave. Piper Greenmantle The wife of Colin Greenmantle, she first appears to be a woman who simply wants to be entertained. When Colin moves her to Henrietta, she takes up an interest in psychics and Tarot cards, and eventually she decides to go out and get what they came to Henrietta for. She hires two thugs herself and kills Jesse Dittley, entering his cave. After a cave-in, she wakes up and enters a room where a mysterious, non-human creature is in a tomb and she tells it to wake up. TV adaptation On April 10, 2017, it was announced that a TV adaptation of the series is in production, with Catherine Hardwicke attached to direct and produce, and Andrew Miller as its showrunner and will be distributed by Warner Bros. Domestic Television. In November 2019, Stiefvater confirmed she had written a pilot. In spring of 2020 Steifvater confirmed production had stopped.

Technology The plant has two identical direct cycle turbines of 25 MW each. Each turbine is rated at 6.1 bars inlet pressure and a steam flowrate of 44.5 kg/s. The geothermal reservoir contains two-phase water. The reservoir temperature is 250-300 ¬∞C. Proven steam resources of are 172 kg/s. Fluid is extracted from 12 wells for a total steam flowrate of 156 kg/s. Wellhead pressures are 7-10 bars. Separation of the mixture is done at the plant. The steam/water mixture from wells is transported by individual and common pipelines. Separated water and waste heat are fed into injection wells. The decision about two-phase transportation was the result of administrative intrigues. Steam-water pipelines were built without hydraulic calculation until 2003. The optimal diameter of pipes sometimes was not determined. Some pipelines have experienced pressure loss, while some pipelines have experienced pulsations. Compensation of temperature extensions was implemented by curves in pipelines. Hydraulic calculations related to pipelines began in 2003. Old pipes were reconstructed and new ones were built. Bellows expansion joints were established and the non-functional local resistances were eliminated. At present, the total length of pipelines of steam-water mixture is more than 10 km. The longest well depth is 2.3 km.

In 1952, Corbett ran for Oregon's District 3 seat in the United States House of Representatives. He won the Democratic primary. In the general election, his opponent was Homer D. Angell, the incumbent Republican. During the campaign, Corbett accused Angell of being an isolationist because of several Congressional votes Angell made prior to the outbreak of World War II. The accusation made Angell so angry that he walked out of a public debate with Corbett.Harvey, Paul W., Jr, \\"Landslide for Ellsworth Predicted; Angell May Expect Close Election\\", The Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, November 24, 1952, p. 23.

In this position, Corbett played a leading role in the Johnson administration's war on poverty. When the Legal Services Corporation was created in 1974 by the Federal government to provide legal assistance to low-income people, Corbett joined the organization. He served as chairman of the corporation's Project Review Board, the group that reviewed funding applications for legal aid programs. Corbett worked to preserve legal services for the poor when the Nixon administration tried to disband the corporation. Corbett retired in 1978. After retiring, he moved to a cattle ranch near Tumalo in Central Oregon. Eventually, he and his wife moved to Camp Sherman, Oregon, where they lived through most of the 1990s.

Since then, he has become a perennial candidate for multiple statewide offices in Hawaii. Early life John Stanley Carroll was born in St. Marys, Kansas on December 18, 1929 to Hugh Stanley Carroll, who was a chemistry professor who later worked on the Manhattan Project. He initially began his education at Saint Mary's University, but in 1949 he moved to the Territory of Hawaii using a scholarship to play football for the University of Hawaii at Hilo. He later transferred to the University of Hawaii at Manoa and graduated with a Bachelor‚Äôs Degree in education. During the Korean War he served in the United States Army and later transferred to the United States Air Force. He graduated the Air Command and Staff College and the Air War College, became a staff judge advocate for the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard, and retired from the Air Force as a colonel. After military service, he worked as a pilot for Hawaiian Airlines. Career In 1966, Carroll ran for one of Hawaii's two at-large congressional district seats, but came in third place behind incumbents Patsy Mink and Spark Matsunaga. He briefly ran for House again in 1968, but dropped out and ran for one of the Honolulu City Council's six at-large seats and came in eighth out of twelve candidates. State legislature = House = On August 17, 1970, Carroll announced that he would seek the Republican nomination for one of three 12th state house district seats and later came in first out of six candidates. He was almost ruled as ineligible to run due to a residency challenge that argued he was currently living in the 13th district, but it was rejected by Lieutenant Governor Thomas Gill and Carroll was allowed to run. On July 24, 1972, he announced that he would seek reelection and came second out of six candidates. He was redistricted into the 11th House District which only had two seats and on July 31, 1974, he announced that he would seek a third term and placed first out of four candidates. On July 29, 1976, he announced that he would seek a fourth term and placed second out of five candidates. Carroll proposed a bill that would create the procedure for the state constitution's impeachment provisions for a governor or lieutenant governor as the state constitution only specified that the state legislature could do it, but not how to do it, the ability to recall elected officials, and also proposed a constitutional amendment for an environmental bill of rights. In 1971, the state legislature was rewriting the state's penal code with the possibility of repealing its sodomy laws. Carroll supported repealing the laws and he read a letter written by students from the University of Hawaii Gay Students Union asking for the state legislature to legalize homosexual sex between consenting adults. In 1973, he introduced a bill that would prevent marijuana possession from appearing on arrest records and would reduce the penalty for possession to a $25 fine. He and three other Republicans also supported a minimum wage bill that increased it from $1.80 to $2.40 later that year. In 1975, he proposed multiple bills that would create a voter initiative and referendum system with the referendum allowing voters to decide whether or not a bill would pass while an initiative would be proposed legislation that voters would choose whether or not to pass. He also proposed another bill that would allow for the recalling of elected officials and a Castle doctrine amendment to Hawaii's penal code although it was defeated. During his tenure in the House he served on the Judiciary and Environmental Protection committees. =Senate= In late 1977 Carroll stated at a fundraiser that he was considering running for a seat in the Hawaii Senate. On July 6, 1978 he announced that he would run for one of Hawaii's 6th Senate district four seats and came second out of seven candidates. During his tenure he served on the Judiciary, Agriculture, Consumer Protection and Commerce, Economic Development, and the Government, Operations and Efficiency committees He also introduced legislation that would ban public employees from striking and would result in their firing if they did strike, was against Hawaii expanding its fishing and asked Governor George Ariyoshi to ban lobster harvesting along the Leeward Islands, and voted against a resolution supporting the District of Columbia Delegate Act. The 6th district was redistricted from having four seats to two seats and in the 1980 election both of the incumbents, John Carroll and Anson Chong, narrowly lost reelection. Post-legislature In June 1981, he was elected as chairman of the Hawaii Republican Party with 341 out of 572 votes. During his tenure as chairman he attempted to change the party's Caucasian image and to organize the party in every precinct. On November 5, 1982, two party officers resigned in protest after Carroll refused to resign after the party's poor performance in the 1982 elections although he later chose not to seek reelection in 1983. In 1979, he invested in a diamond mine that later caused trouble between him and the IRS and in 1994 he filed for bankruptcy claiming that two business partners attempted to take over his company. In 1998, Carroll ran for Hawaii's 1st Senate district, but was defeated in the general election by Lorraine Inouye. On May 25, 2000, he announced that he would run in the Senate election against Senator Daniel Akaka and easily won the Republican nomination. When he announced in May he stated that he would need $1.5 million to launch a viable campaign against Akaka, but by late October had only raised less than $2,000 while Akaka had raised $430,000. During the campaign he made advertisements that started with \\"Aloha, I'm John Carroll, and in no way am I a racist\\" and in the general election he was easily defeated by Akaka. On November 10, 2001, he announced that he would challenge Linda Lingle for the Republican nomination for governor in the 2002 election and attacked Lingle as unelectable with her support in 1998 coming from anti-Cayetano voters that would remain Democratic in the 2002 election. However, he was defeated in a landslide in the primary and received less than 10% while Lingle received almost 90% and went on to win the general election. Carroll ran unsuccessfully for the United States House of Representatives in 2002. On May 27, 2009, he announced that he would challenge Lieutenant Governor Duke Aiona in the Republican gubernatorial primary, but received less than 5% of the vote. On September 21, 2011, he announced that he would run for the Republican nomination for Senate against Linda Lingle and campaigned against the Jones Act and a Native Hawaiian federal recognition bill. In the primary he was easily defeated by Lingle with her taking over 90% of the vote and Carroll later endorsed Democratic Representative Mazie Hirono in the general election. In 2016, he announced that he would run in the Senate election and eaisly won the Republican nomination against other perennial candidates, but was defeated in a landslide by incumbent Senator Brian Schatz. In 2017, he faced potential disbarment over two 2015 complaints of professional misconduct and agreed to give up his law license. Following the 2018 Hawaii false missile alert message sent by the State of Hawaii's Emergency Management Agency to hundreds of thousands of Hawaii residents via their phones on 13 January 2018, Carroll dubbed the incumbent Democratic governor David Ige \\"Doomsday David\\" and called on him to resign. In 2018, he announced that he would seek the Republican nomination for governor. In mid-March, Carroll was leading state House Minority Leader Andria Tupola in the Honolulu Star-Advertiser's statewide poll of likely 2018 Republican voters by a double-digit margin of 12 percentage points with 40% of potential Republican voters supporting Carroll as opposed to 28% supporting Tupola. Carroll was defeated by Tupola by a 20% margin in the August 11 primary. On June 14, 2019, he announced his candidacy for the 2020 Honolulu mayoral election.

He is known, especially in France for his works Bell's Theorem and The Sharks of Lagos published in the mid to late-1980s.  Life and work  Cover of English-language edition of Bell's Theorem #2: The Connection, originally published in 1988. Cover art by Matthias Schultheiss, copyright by Matthias Schultheiss and Catalan Communications Schultheiss was born in Nuremberg. He originally took an education in cabinet-making, then went on to study illustration at Hochschule f√ºr bildende K√ºnste Hamburg. His first graphic novel called Trucker appeared in 1981 as a serial in the German magazine Comic-Reader, and he published two comic adaptations of short stories by Charles Bukowski. His 1985 graphic novel Kalter Krieg (\\"Cold War\\") was indexed as harmful to minors by the Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons, not due to its depiction of sex and violence, but because of its bleak, pessimistic nihilism. His breakthrough came when Franco-Belgian comics magazine L'√âcho des savanes published his graphic novels Bell's Theorem and The Sharks of Lagos as serials from 1985 onwards. Both were reprinted in three volumes each by √âditions Albin Michel in France, Carlsen Verlag in Germany, and Bell's Theorem has been published in English by Catalan Communications. In 1986, he received the Max & Moritz Prize as Best German-Language Comic Artist. In the early 1990s, Schultheiss as one of several European comic artists was contacted by Kodansha for a new series of manga-style comics by European artists to be called Im Zentrum des Wahnsinns (\\"In the Center of Madness\\"). When a lot of work had already gone into the project, Kodansha suddenly cancelled its plans, and Schultheiss's 400 pages he had drawn so far were never released (up until in May 2001, the German mail-order publisher Hummelcomic began issuing one page of it per day on its website). Schultheiss next intended to get on the American market in 1993 with his own superhero series, entitled Propellerman. But this turned out a flop, and for the rest of the 1990s, Schultheiss withdrew from making comics, only teaching graphics illustration classes in Hamburg, his city of residence, and occasionally wrote scripts for telefilms. In 2008, he returned with two graphic novels originally published by Kodansha, \\"Woman on the River\\" and \\"Daddy\\", and in 2010, he published \\"Journey with Bill\\" at Gl√©nat. They present a much brighter, more colorful, and more optimistic style compared to his bleak and darkly disturbing work of the 1980s and early 1990s.

Ansud is known for warring against the Eblaites from a letter written by the later Mariote king Enna-Dagan. Reign Identity It has been proposed that a bead (reference M. 4439) discovered at Mari, was sent as a gift by Mesannepada of Ur to king \\"Hanusum\\" (Gansud) of Mari. This has now been corrected with new translations only giving Mesannepada as son of Meskalamdug:Description with photograph: It is unclear how this bead came to be in Mari, but this points to some kind of relation between Ur and Mari at that time. The bead was discovered in a jar containing other objects from Ur or Kish. The letter of Enna-Dagan is extremely difficult to read, and the word \\"Sa'umu\\" appeared in three passages of it. In the second and third passages, the word referred to Ansud's successor Sa'umu. However, in the first passage, \\"Sa'umu\\" was read as a verb by Giovanni Pettinato, who later read it as (Anudu). Alfonso Archi, recognized that this verb is a personal name of a monarch and read it as Anubu (motivated by the Sumerian King List which record a dynasty of Mari and king Anbu as the first monarch of the dynasty). However, the discovery of an intact (SKL) with the names of Mari's dynasty bearing no resemblance to second kingdom monarchs, eliminated the need for Archi's identification. According to Michael Astour, the name is Anusu (Ansud) and must be correlated with king Hanusum. Campaigns In the letter Ansud is recorded defeating the Eblaite vassal cities of Aburu, Ilgi and Belan. The king is also mentioned leaving ruins in the mountains of Labanan, which were identified by Pettinato with Lebanon. However, this identification was ruled as geographically impossible by Astour.

Marion M. Ganey, S.J., (1904‚Äì1984) was a Catholic priest, member of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits), and missionary to British Honduras, Central America, from 1937 to 1953, where he was instigator of the credit union and cooperatives movement. He became increasingly prominent in this movement, being invited to the Fiji Islands in 1953 and laboring to establish the movement there and throughout the South Pacific until his death in Fiji in 1984. Early life left Marion M. Ganey was born July 21, 1904, and entered the Society of Jesus on August 7, 1922. He studied for the priesthood at St. Louis University divinity school in St. Marys, Kansas, and was ordained in 1935. After a year of spiritual studies he arrived in British Honduras (Belize) in 1937. As assistant pastor at Holy Redeemer Cathedral in Belize City, he organized youth clubs and Golden Gloves boxing tournaments.Anderson, F.W. (April 1951). The golden gloves of Father Ganey. Jesuit Missions, 28f. Direct contact with the poor, along with the social encyclicals of Popes Pius XI and Leo XIII, launched Ganey on his career of founding credit unions and cooperatives. In his time at Holy Redeemer Cathedral, Ganey would fill the hall with \\"a thousand young men.\\" To found the credit union at Holy Redeemer, Ganey relied on a fellow Jesuit Fr. Henry Sutti, who grew up at Fr. Flanagan's Boys Town in Nebraska. Bishop Dorick M. Wright, in his preface to the history of the Catholic church in Belize, calls \\"the credit union and cooperative movements stalwart pillars in the country's economic development.\\"Woods, Charles M. Sr., et al. Years of Grace: The History of Roman Catholic Evangelization in Belize: 1524-2014. (Belize: Roman Catholic Diocese of Belize City-Belmopan, 2015). Punta Gorda In 1942 Ganey became pastor in Punta Gorda in the south of Belize. There he established the St. Peter Claver Credit Union in 1943. He then traveled from one village to another throughout the country preaching the Church's social doctrine and its relation to the establishment of credit unions and cooperatives. He conferred with authorities in the U.S. and Nova Scotia on methods to improve cooperatives in Central America.Jesuit Missions, 1944. He also taught the people agricultural practices that would produce a better yield on their plantations and he greatly enlarged the market for their produce. For that he enlisted two alumni of St. John's College: \\"Buster\\" Hunter used his two mail boats to carry produce from Punta Gorda to Belize City, where Edgar Gegg would sell it. From this beginning the cooperative began. Meanwhile, the Pallotine Sisters in Punta Gorda were teaching the girls weaving, and how to cook and preserve produce: \\"The domestic detail of the Cooperative is in the hands of the Sisters.\\"Wallace, F. (April 1944). \\"The Caribs Cooperate.\\" Jesuit Missions, 92f. What Ganey had begun soon inspired community-conscious leaders of all denominations throughout Belize to form credit unions.\\"Great Belizean credit union and cooperatives pioneer Father Ganey dies\\" (October 1984). The Christian Herald, 1. Jesuit Fr. Joseph Wade described the necessary steps in forming a co-op: study club, credit union, co-op. As he wrote, \\"a very timid- faced little co-op is moving shyly about my village\\" in Orange Walk.Wade, J.D. (September 1945). \\"To the road.\\" Jesuit Missions, 190f. Growing movement Bishop William A. Rice had encouraged Ganey in his efforts. His successor, Bishop David Francis Hickey, showed strong support also. Eight Jesuits were sent to the World Institute of Cooperatives in St. Louis to learn this aspect of missiology and Fr. William Moore, S.J., was assigned to full-time work in the cooperative movement. Moore became the first president of the Belize Credit Union League, while the Belizean government opened a special department of cooperatives and sent civil servants abroad for further study of the movement. Credit unions and cooperatives remain important elements in the national economy of Belize. In the latter part of the 1950s, two foreign-owned companies were purchasing lobster tails from Belizean fishermen at 40 cents a pound and whole lobsters at 16 cents a pound, then exporting them to the United States where they sold them for $2.40 per pound. In the early 1960s, some local fishermen established their own fish processing plant and marketing operation. The new operation, although inefficient, immediately realized significant savings, enabling the fishermen to double their income. Ganey wrote of his experience with empowerment: \\"During my ten years in British Honduras, experience has taught me, if nothing else, the great fact that I should not try to dominate the movement. This applies as well to my years of action in the Fiji Islands. It is a difficult lesson to learn and I learned by many mistakes. We hurt the people and the movement if we figure too positively in the program.\\"Considine, J.J., ed. (1958, 2012). The missionary's role in socio-economic betterment. , 43. Fiji and South Pacific islands Ganey's departure from Belize was at the instigation of Sir Ronald Garvey KCMG, who had served in the Fiji Islands before coming to Belize and felt that Ganey could do wonders for Fiji with cooperatives and credit unions. He convinced the Jesuit superior to send Ganey to the Pacific islands of Fiji and Samoa, where he spent the rest of his life. Ganey established the first credit union in Fiji in January 1954 and by July of the same year established the Credit Union Ordinance which later became the Fiji Credit Union Act, impacting also Tonga and Samoa where Ganey extended his work. He organised insurance underwriting for the Pacific credit unions through CUNA Mutual Group and developed the Bergengren Credit Union Training Centre in 1964, at the same time contributing to the formation of the South Pacific Association of Credit Union Leagues. Fiji, at its height, had a total of 39 credit unions with some 8,600 members. In 1961, Fr. Marion Ganey was invited to New Zealand to lead a seminar on the importance of a united credit union movement. Way before mobile banking became popular there was a mobile credit union, operating out the back of a landrover. The visit by Ganey and his executives was usually followed by feasting and celebrations. Ganey died in Fiji in 1984 and was gladly accorded his wish of being buried at the parish there. \\"Every year we celebrate the day he died like we're celebrating the life of a saint,\\" a villager said. Komave villagers from around the world returned to the village to celebrate the life of Fr. Ganey. \\"At that time the whole village would come together to celebrate mass and also prepare a feast in his honour.\\" He made Fiji his home and final resting place but only after he gained a place among them as a member of the Mataqali (clan) Waqanitabua. He visited Belize in 1969 and spoke at the 25th anniversary of the Holy Redeemer Credit Union. And when in 1977 the bishop blessed a US$1,250,000 addition to the Northern Fishermen Cooperative building, Ganey was invited to speak. This was his final trip to Belize. Recounting this occasion, as well as his death seven years later, The Christian Herald wrote: \\"The tall, lanky figure of Fr. Ganey was everywhere, advising, encouraging, giving of his talents to engineer the success of this economic effort that affected the root people.\\" Links to history of credit unions The German economist Franz Hermann Schulze-Delitzsch is credited with founding the world's first credit union in Delitzsch in the Free State of Saxony in Germany in 1850. In 1846 when crop failure and famine struck Germany he organised a mill and bakery cooperative and a \\"people's bank\\" that provided credit to farmers. By the 1890s they had spread through most of Europe and to India. In 1901, after much correspondence with European founders, Gabriel- Alphonse Desjardins founded the first credit union in Quebec, the forerunner of current North American credit unions. In 1908 he helped a group of French American Catholics organise the first credit union in the United States at Ste. Marie Church, Manchester, New Hampshire. The U.S. credit union movement became increasingly popular in the 1920s economy when Edward Filene, a wealthy Bostonian, hired Roy Bergengren to promote the cause in the U.S. and abroad. The movement grew to more than 7,000 credit unions in the U. S. representing 100 million members. Unlike the credit unions of Germany or Quebec, most in the U.S. emerged from an employer-based bond of association. In addition to the traditional information and enforcement advantages resulting from the fact that members shared the same workplace, the employer-based bond permitted credit unions to use future paychecks as collateral. In 1954 the World Extension Department was created to give international direct assistance to credit unions, often in collaboration with government programs. A World Council of Credit Unions was created in 1971 and it now represents 97 national credit union movements with more than 172 million credit union members.

It grows to the height of a small tree with small, scale-like leaves that are pressed against the branches, and has a papery bark and a weeping habit. Description Melaleuca tamariscina is a shrub to small tree tall with white to grey, papery bark and pendulous foliage. Its leaves are arranged alternately, long, wide, oval to egg-shaped, half-moon shape in cross section and tapering to a point. The leaves are pressed against the stem and there are indentations in the stem matching the outline of each leaf. The flowers are white, creamy white or mauve and are arranged in spikes on the sides of the branches, each spike containing 5 to 25 groups of flowers in threes and is up to in diameter and long. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flowers and each bundle contains 5 to 18 stamens. Flowering occurs at various times throughout the year and is followed by fruit which are woody capsules long.M. tamariscina flowers Taxonomy A formal description of Melaleuca tamariscina by English botanist William Jackson Hooker was first published in Thomas Mitchell's Journal of an Expedition into the Interior of Tropical Australia. Mitchell had collected the plant on 4 August 1846. The specific epithet (tamariscina) is a reference to the similarity of the leaves of this species to a member of the genus Tamarix. Distribution and habitat Melaleuca tamariscina occurs on the Great Dividing Range in and between the Torrens Creek and Jericho districts. It often grows in boggy places and sometimes on sandstone ridges.

The complete overthrow of the post‚ÄìWorld War II status quo, known as the Cold War, left two superpowers (the United States and the Soviet Union) vying for ultimate global supremacy. They created two camps, known as blocs. These blocs formed the basis of the concepts of the First and Second Worlds. Today, the terms first and third worlds are generally used to refer to developed and developing countries.  History   Cold War  Early in the Cold War era, NATO and the Warsaw Pact were created by the United States and the Soviet Union, respectively. They were also referred to as the Western Bloc and the Eastern Bloc. The circumstances of these two blocs were so different that they were essentially two worlds, however, they were not numbered first and second. The onset of the Cold War is marked by Winston Churchill's famous \\"Iron Curtain\\" speech. In this speech, Churchill describes the division of the West and East to be so solid that it could be called an iron curtain. In 1952, the French demographer Alfred Sauvy coined the term Third World in reference to the three estates in pre-revolutionary France. The first two estates being the nobility and clergy and everybody else comprising the third estate. He compared the capitalist world (i.e., First World) to the nobility and the communist world (i.e., Second World) to the clergy. Just as the third estate comprised everybody else, Sauvy called the Third World all the countries that were not in this Cold War division, i.e., the unaligned and uninvolved states in the \\"East‚ÄìWest Conflict.\\" With the coining of the term Third World directly, the first two groups came to be known as the \\"First World\\" and \\"Second World,\\" respectively. Here the three-world system emerged. However, Shuswap Chief George Manuel believed the Three Worlds Model to be outdated. In his 1974 book The Fourth World: An Indian Reality, he describes the emergence of the Fourth World while coining the term. The fourth world refers to \\"nations,\\" e.g., cultural entities and ethnic groups, of indigenous people who do not compose states in the traditional sense. Rather, they live within or across state boundaries (see First Nations). One example is the Native Americans of North America, Central America, and the Caribbean. Post Cold War With the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Eastern Bloc ceased to exist; with it, so did all applicability of the term Second World.

Pierce and directed by Franklin Adreon. Jeffrey Hunter and France Nuyen star as time- traveling secret agents. It was part of a series of nine low-budget films produced by United Pictures Corporation. The films were intended for TV distribution, but received a theatrical release. The time-travel premise had previously been used in the studio's film Cyborg 2087. Plot Justin Power (Hunter), agent for Espionage, Inc., returns from a mission in which he used a time-travel belt to steal secret plans. He is told by his superior, Cane (Donald Woods), he is to be teamed with a Chinese agent to combat an Asian crime ring, Dragon, headed by crime lord Big Buddha (Sakata). A sister agency has discovered Dragon plans to destroy Los Angeles if United States forces are not withdrawn from east Asia. Aware that Dragon has a primitive hydrogen bomb, but no way to deliver it, Espionage, Inc plans to interrogate a captured agent, Chang (Gerald Jann). Chang is being brought from Hong Kong by two agents‚ÄîSato (Robert Ito) and George (Robert Phillips)‚Äîso they might learn Dragon plans. Chang insists that Dragon will see to it that he will never talk. An assassination attempt occurs immediately. Though George is killed, Chang survives when a female agent shoots the assassin with a dart Informed of the incident, Power goes to Ontario Airport where he uses his time-travel device to \\"preview\\" the assassination. A man in a cowboy suit shoots Chang with a dart gun concealed in a camera, while Sato and the female agent watch helplessly. The shooter then escapes in a limousine with Big Buddha in the back seat. Powers then switches to the present, warns Sato by radio of the threat, and orders the limousine be prevented from following their taxi. Then he punches out the would-be killer, and the transfer is made successfully. At headquarters, the Professor (Jon Lormer), and his assistant, Miss Sweet (Deanna Lund), subject Chang to a truth machine that forces him to tell what he knows at the risk of brain damage. During the process, Chang switches to Chinese and Sato has to translate. The interrogation of Chang reveals that a hydrogen bomb is being delivered piece-by-piece and assembled in Los Angeles, to be exploded on Christmas Day, three months away. Power meets his new partner, Ki Ti Tsu (Kitty) (France Nuyen), the agent who aided during the Hong Kong assassination attempt. Power takes Kitty to a Cantonese restaurant run by an old friend, Kim Fong (Kam Tong). He asks Fong about the black market (Power's cover is an importer) and he offers to help, until Big Buddha is mentioned. Fong's hostess, Nancy Ho (Linda Ho)‚Äîa Dragon agent‚Äîrecognizes Kitty as a Chinese agent and forces Fong to give Power a bomb disguised as an owl- shaped incense burner. Kitty is suspicious because in China, an owl is symbolic of ill omen, and because she recognizes the hostess as an enemy agent. Power disregards her suspicions, and both happen to be out of the car when the bomb explodes. Later, Power visits Ho and confronts her, demanding the location of the bomb. Ho is killed by Kitty as the former tries to stab Power. Kitty then turns Power over to Dragon agent Stoneface. This a ruse; she has her own reasons to meet up with Big Buddha, and after she signals headquarters, Power is rescued. Power then demonstrates the time travel belt to Kitty, warning her that she must limit her travels to areas that she knows will still be there in the future or past. Power receives a message from Cane and learns the Ming company‚Äîthe maker of the owl-bomb and a front for Dragon‚Äîhas a warehouse in Long Beach, and is expecting a shipment from Hong Kong on the Osaka Maru in three weeks. Power and Kitty time travel ahead the three weeks, unaware that they are being watched. When Stoneface wants to kill them with a disintegrator, Big Buddha has him killed instead. Inspecting the warehouse in the future, Power and Kitty discover Uranium-238 in with the Christmas decorations, but are discovered by Big Buddha, who has been expecting them for the last three weeks. Limited by the restriction that he can only travel to locations he can see, Power bounces between barrels as Dragon agents hunt him. Kitty confronts Big Buddha, wanting revenge for his war crimes as executioner during the Nanking Massacre, including the death of her parents seven years earlier,(This is a plot hole, since the Nanking Massacre was in 1937‚Äì1938)The Nanjing Incident but she is captured. Power surrenders to Big Buddha to save her. Big Buddha plans to ship Power to Hong Kong to extract secrets from him. Unexpectedly, Big Buddha's mute servant girl tries to stab him. Power uses the distraction to turn on Big Buddha's bodyguard, Genghis, and a furious fight develops. Power is overpowered by the much larger Genghis. Finally Kitty manages to toss Power a gun, which he uses to shoot Genghis down. Big Buddha by now has forgot all about his servant girl, who has been waiting for her chance to stab him again. This time she kills him. Power and Kitty return to the present to use their knowledge to stop Dragon again without time travel, and let Cane's people do all the work. Cast * Jeffrey Hunter ...

It is one of the properties that arose during the henequen boom, and produced sisal for many years. The property, which was largely completed in 1909, is now an exclusive luxury hotel. History The first known owner of the estate was Benito Montero, a resident of Calkini who sold the estate that year to the brothers Jos√© Dolores and Encarnaci√≥n Guzm√°n. In 1870 the brothers parted ways and the estate fell solely to Jos√© Dolores. There are records which mention a powerhouse with a boiler and steam motor being added. In 1886 Santa Rosa de Lima was mortgaged to Manuel Zapata Bolio for $20,000, and then acquired by Jos√© Dominguez, who had to sell it to his brother Alfredo Maria de la Trinidad in 1889 due to economic reasons. Alfredo sold it three years later to the Urcelay family, led by Jos√© Antonio Urcelay Peniche, a notable hacienda owner. In 1897 the estate had 90 people living on it, with \\"363 heads of cattle, 236 cows, 90 bulls, 37 calves, 29 horses (including mares) and 39 mules\\". Following the land reform of 1937, which involved the expropriation of land and machinery, and then the decline in demand for natural fibers on the international market, the estate entered a period of precipitous decline; in a few years Santa Rosa de Lima saw production plummet from 3465 to just 276 hectares. It was owned by engineer Enrique Vales Monforte at the time it was taken over by a private company in 1996, which fully restored it as an exclusive luxury hotel. Architecture The hacienda is organized, like most Mexican estates of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, in an axis from north to south. The main house and the powerhouse border the main square. On one side of this square is the access path for the workers from their homes and the company store. The church and school complete the set. The current colonial style main house, the cellars and the keeper's house, date to 1909. They feature cornices and friezes. During the second construction stage in 1916, the powerhouse was added, which also accommodated the grain shredder. Various styles can be seen in its construction, including the Renaissance and neoclassical. The hotel suites of the hacienda all feature 18-foot ceilings with bare beams and rafters, with 10-foot-high wooden double doors. They are all furnished in dark tropical hardwoods, with tile floors. The 9.200 m¬≤ botanical garden is set amidst an old fruit plantation, and features over 200 species of plants, several of which are endemic to the Yucat√°n Peninsula.

The majority of results show that conditional changes (disease, cancer, etc.) in general do not change the expression levels of the gene. Function Researchers have studied the regulation of centriole duplication by centrosome components.E. N. Firat-Karalar, N. Rauniyar, J. R. Yates, T. Stearns, Proximity interactions among centrosome components identify regulators of centriole duplication. Curr. Biol. 24, 664‚Äì70 (2014). The individuals conducting this experiment have identified that centrosome duplication is regulated by the following proteins: PLK4, CEP192, CEP152, CEP63, and CPAP. Among these, they found that CEP63 interacts with satellite proteins, namely KIAA0753 and another protein called CCDC14, to play a role in regulating centriole duplication. Their findings conclude that KIAA0753 positively regulates CEP63 centrosome localization and centriole duplication. A second study has to do with the identification of hepatic microvascular adhesion- related genes of human colon cancer cells.J. M√°rquez et al., Identification of hepatic microvascular adhesion-related genes of human colon cancer cells using random homozygous gene perturbation. Int. J. Cancer. 133, 2113‚Äì22 (2013). This experiment was conducted with a variety of genes using a method called random homozygous gene perturbation. KIAA0753 was identified as a gene in a silenced state when screening for nonadherent cells. The article concludes that the identified genes, including KIAA0753, may contribute to understand the metastatic process of colon cancer and possible treatments. Interacting Proteins Ubiquitin C has shown an interaction with KIAA0753 in humans. Further analysis of this interaction reveals that it is not due to neighboring or co-occurrence, but has been discovered experimentally.

The strong bond of the flange (horizontal section) and the two webs (vertical members, also known as stems) creates a structure that is capable of withstanding high loads while having a long span. The typical sizes of double tees are up to for flange width, up to for web depth, and up to or more for span length. Double tees are pre-manufactured from prestressed concrete which allows construction time to be shortened. History The first application long-span double tees was on a two-story office building in Winter Haven, Florida, designed and built in 1961 by Gene Leedy. Leedy experimented when building his architectural office by using structural elements of prestressed concrete and designing the new \\"double-tee\\" structural elements. In their early days, the applications of double tees were limited to multi-story car park structures and roof structures of buildings, but they have now been used in highway structures as well. Manufacturing process Double tees are manufactured in factories. The process is the same as in other prestressed concrete manufacturing by building them on pretensioning beds. The beds for making double tees are of the typical sizes of the area that double tees will be used. In most cases, the lengths of the pretensioning beds are of about long. Applications Roofing Double-tee roof structure of an indoor swimming pool In non-residential buildings, the roof structure may be flat. Structural concrete is an alternative for flat roof construction. There are three main categories for such method: precast/prestressed, cast-in-place and shell. Within the precast/prestressed concrete roofing, the double tees are the most common products used for roof span up to . Parking structures Precast parking structure showing an interior column which supports two girders, left and right. Double-tee beams hang onto the girders. Modern multi- story parking structures are built from precast/prestressed concrete systems. The floor systems are mostly built from pre-topped double tees. This system evolved from the earlier use of tee systems where the flanges of the T-beams were connected. The concrete is then poured at the top of the tees during the construction to create the floor surface, hence the process is called field- placed concrete topping. In double-tee structures, the top concrete is usually made at the factory as an integral part of the precast double tee structure. Double tees are connected during the construction without topping with concrete to create the parking structure floor surface. A benefit of pre- topped double tees is a higher quality concrete for more durable surface to reduce traffic wears. Factories can produce the topping with minimum concrete strength of 5,000 psi. In some areas, the strength can be 6,000-8,000 psi. This compares to the field-placed concrete topping with the lower concrete strength of 4,000 psi. Typically, the double-tees are hung over a supporting structure. This is done by having dapped ends at the webs of the double tee (pictured). The dapped ends are sensitive to cracking at the supporting area. A recommendation to prevent cracking is to include reinforcing steel in the double-tee design to transfer the loads from the bearing area (the reduced- depth section) to the full-depth section of the web. In case that the cracks are developed after the parking structure is already in use, other methods to provide external support to the double-tees are needed. One of such alternatives is to use externally bonded carbon fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) to provide reinforcement. Bridges The first NEXT Beam bridge, in York, Maine, which uses four double tees to form a bridge span Prefabricated bridge designs have been used in many bridge constructions to reduce the construction time. In the United States, there are efforts to come up with Prefabricated Bridge Elements and Systems in many states. Double tee structure is an alternative for short to medium spans between . There are many standards such as double-tee beam of Texas Department of Transportation and the Northeast Extreme Tee (NEXT) Beam of the Northeast. A benefit of using double tees for bridge replacements is to shorten the construction time. Texas has a goal of shortening short-span bridge replacements to one month or less instead of 6 months in traditional bridge constructions. NEXT Beam development started in 2006 by the Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute (PCI) North East to update regional standard on Accelerated Bridge Construction (ABC). The NEXT Beam design was inspired by double-tee designs that have been used to build railroad platform slabs. The use of double tees with wide flange allows to have less number of beams and to have them stay in place to form the deck, resulting in a shorter construction time. The first design was introduced in 2008 called \\"NEXT F\\" with flange thickness requires topping. This was used for the construction of the Maine State Route 103 bridge that crosses the York River. The seven-span long bridge was completed in 2010 as the first NEXT Beam bridge. The second design was introduced in 2010 for Sibley Pond Bridge at the border of Canaan and Pittsfield, Maine. The design was called \\"NEXT D\\" with flange thickness that does not require deck topping allowing the wearing surface can be applied directly on to the beams. The combination of F and D called \\"NEXT E\\" was introduced in 2016. Concerns of using double tees in bridge constructions include bridge deck longitudinal cracks. As the connection points between the double tee beams are longitudinally along the traffic flow, any lateral movements of double tees can cause the road surface to crack longitudinally. These include differential rotation of double-tee flanges that can cause asphalt surface to raise or crack. A separation of the flanges can cause asphalt to sag into the gap forming a reflective crack. To reduce these problems, many methods have been developed to manage the lateral connections of the double tees. The materials used in the connections are backer rods, steel bars, welded plates, and grouts.

History The first European to sight Eddystone Point was the Dutch navigator, Abel Tasman. In December 1642, Tasman sailed along the entire east coast of Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania). He recorded that he tried to follow the coast around this headland, but he could not penetrate the wind wall. The howling westerly gale indicated that here was a strait, not a bay, so Tasman resumed his easterly course to continue his continent-hunting. The next European visitor was Tobias Furneaux in HMS Adventure during James Cook's second Pacific voyage, which took place during the period of intense Anglo-French rivalry that filled the twelve years between the Seven Years' War and the American Revolutionary War. In March 1773, Furneaux retraced Tasman's course up the east coast of the island to discover whether or not it was joined to New Holland. At 2 a.m. on 19 March, his ship was suddenly tossed 40 miles out to sea and lost its sails. Furneaux named the headland Eddystone Point, after the notorious Eddystone Rocks in the English Channel. Seal hunting took place here from at least 1827. Six applications were made to the colonial government to lease land for whaling stations at Eddystone Point in 1841. It is uncertain how many of these leases were taken up.

In this episode, Emma Swan reunites Lily with Maleficent, Isaac must find a new ally as Gold's heart grows darker, and Regina and Robin Hood must deal with Zelena's pregnancy. Back in the Enchanted Forest, Regina is reunited with Cora upon her return from Wonderland, but questions her mother's intentions as to why she wants to \\"help\\" her. Plot Opening Sequence The dragon form of Lily is featured in the forest. In the Characters' Past In the Enchanted Forest before the first curse, the Evil Queen Regina stumbles upon a wedding being held on land that is off limits on her palace grounds. She makes it clear that she does not tolerate this kind of intrusion, by pulling the heart out of the groom and crushing it in front of his bride, the families, and friends. Regina then noticed a flower on Daniel's grave, and spots Cora, who pays her a visit on the anniversary of Daniel's death. Cora says she is there to apologize and make things right, and that she wants to see Regina happy by finding her the love that Tinker Bell spoke of. But Regina, having been upset with Tinker Bell previously, says she'll believe it when she sees it. Later on, Cora heads to the bar to find Robin, where she learns from the Sheriff of Nottingham that Robin is a thief and is now married. This gives Cora the idea to make the sheriff the true love for her daughter, by conjuring up a tattoo that is similar to the one Robin Hood had, and dressing him up in clothing similar to Robin\\"s. Unfortunately, Regina catches on to what Cora did when she notices the fake magical tattoo, and temporarily makes the lion tattoo come alive and attack him, to make the sheriff confess to Regina that Cora was hoping Regina would fall in love and have a child. Regina ties the sheriff upside-down above a boiling pot in the dungeon as punishment, but Cora uses her magic to send him home and confronts Regina over her actions. Realizing what Cora did, in order to have her conceive a child so she can have an heir to the kingdom, Regina decides to sacrifice her hopes to bear any children, by taking a potion that will leave her unable to do so, in order to \\"hurt\\" her mother and to prevent Cora from manipulating her. Despite Cora's explanation that all she really ever wanted was for her to be happy, a pained Regina tells her mother that she just doesn't want to hear any more. Then, she tells Cora to return to Wonderland, and that she doesn't need her. Outside Storybrooke At the bar in New York City, Regina discusses with Robin, who had moved on with Zelena because she's pregnant with his child, and because he didn't realize until recently that \\"Marian\\" was Zelena in disguise. Robin tells Regina that Roland won't understand where his mother had gone, and Robin feels heartbroken to have lost his beloved Marian, because Zelena killed her back in the Enchanted Forest. As a result, Regina agrees to use a forgetting potion on Roland to make him forget about the time he spent with \\"Marian\\" after she was brought to Storybrooke by Emma Swan, so he won't have to go through the pain of losing his mother again. At Neal's apartment, Emma holds the dreamcatcher and tells Lily about Neal's having lived in the place and tells her that Zelena was responsible for his death. Zelena, who heard the conversation, feels the baby kick in her tummy, and taunts her by telling her not to trouble an \\"expectant mother.\\" Regina and Robin arrive back at the apartment, and tells Emma, Lily, and Zelena to pack up because, \\"We're going to Storybrooke tonight.\\" Emma drives her bug with Lily and Zelena, while Regina drives Robin's black minivan with Roland. In Storybrooke As Emma brings Lily back to Storybrooke, she is able to reunite her with Maleficent, while at the same time, Regina and Robin Hood must find a way to deal with Zelena, even if they can find a way to be together. During their get-together at Granny's, Lily asks her mother about what they are going to do about David and Mary Margaret, as she still has a grudge against them, but Maleficent states that she isn't up for revenge, and tries persuades Lily to stay in Storybrooke, begging her to stay because she won't be able to return if she leaves, and because Maleficent would turn back into dust if she tried to leave town with Lily. However, Lily still decides on leaving town, so Maleficent approaches Mary Margaret and David for help. Hook reminds Gold that he will do whatever it takes to keep Emma from going dark, but as Isaac tells Mr. Gold that they need Emma in order to produce the ink needed for the quill since Emma has yet to succumb to darkness. Hook then taunts Gold, saying he knows that each time he does a bad deed, his heart will grow darker, so he won't be able to do anything to stop Hook. After Hook leaves, Gold begins to falter, as his heart is growing darker, and he uses his magic to transport him and the Author to his shop to look up information on obtaining Blood Magic, in case they can't get Emma to turn dark. However, Gold's health is continuing to decline, due to his dying heart. Regina suddenly shows up, wanting Isaac's services since she was the one who wanted to find Isaac first, only to have Mr. Gold making an offer to Regina to help her find the Magic Ink for Isaac, to get both of their happy endings, displaying the magic quill. Regina, however, states that she'll find the Magic Ink on her own and get her happy ending by herself. Gold objects, saying that if his heart dies, \\"Rumplestiltskin\\" will die, along with all of his goodness, and warns her that she would not want to deal with a \\"Dark One\\" who is entirely evil. However, Regina is entirely unconcerned, saying that he is in no position to bargain, and takes Isaac and the quill with her, even as Gold passes out, due to his weakening heart. Back at her vault, Regina as she learns that the energies of Emma's impending darkness is needed to procure the substance. Isaac then tells Regina that he was working for Mr. Gold because he protected him. Regina then shows Isaac a picture of Regina being with Robin Hood; Isaac states that it was one of his \\"experimental writings,\\" which he was planning to write about it in a separate book, but never got the chance, which gives Regina an idea. Regina approaches Lily after she walked out on her mother at the diner (after Maleficent refused to help Lily carry out her revenge plans, option to restart their life as mother and daughter), and tells Regina that she wants Mary Margaret and David dead. Regina tells Lily that most of her darkness came from Emma, and that she needed it to be all worked up, which Lily responds to by telling her to buzz off. Unable to reason with her, Regina gives up on attempting to explain her actions to her, and then cuts Lily's hand to acquire her blood in order to obtain a sample of the darkness in her and turns it into magic ink. Then, she smiles and disappears while quoting \\"Welcome to Storybrooke.\\" After Regina leaves, Lily's eyes glow yellow and become reptilian, as she becomes consumed by rage. Shortly afterwards, Maleficent, Mary Margaret, and David later encounter Lily in her dragon form, but as Maleficent approaches her, Mary Margaret runs after Maleficent, convinced that she may not be safe around Lily. David shouts to Mary Margaret that Lily is out of control as she knocks Mary Margaret out, with Lily using her dragon flame to prevent David and Maleficent from reaching the unconscious Mary Margaret, before flying off. Emma shows up and immediately comes to her mother's aid, and uses her powers to heal her. Lily regresses to her human form, and Maleficent confronts Lily, giving Lily her baby rattle, which she never got the chance to give her. Lily claims that she destroys everything she touches ever since Snow White and Prince Charming put Emma's darkness in her, and that no one would want to be with her. Maleficent replies by saying that she wouldn't mind \\"a little darkness.\\" As Maleficent convinces Lily to stay for a week to teach her some tricks, Emma finally forgives Mary Margaret and David for what they did. After completing the task of extracting Lily's blood, Regina and Isaac visit Zelena's cell at the Storybrooke Hospital and states that she plans to write an ending for Zelena, and vows to have her written out of the story. Her half-sister replies by saying that she has gotten to know about Cora through Regina, claiming that she was exactly like Cora. As the Magic Ink is drying, Regina tells Zelena that Cora wasn't a better mother, and that she had wronged them both, as Robin Hood comes in. As Regina decides to spare Zelena for now, albeit locked up, this results in Regina's decision that she no longer needs the Author to find her happy ending. This gives Isaac the opportunity to write his way out of the hospital, and leaves a message that indicates a plan to write a new story that could change destiny. Isaac rendezvous with Mr. Gold at his shop, where upon meeting up with him, Isaac is instructed to start writing a new story in which villains win, in a new book, aptly titled Heroes and Villains, but Isaac already has a new chapter for in store for everyone involved, beginning with the phrase, \\"Once Upon A Time...\\" Reception Ratings The episode remained flat from the previous episode but had an increase with a 1.7/6 among 18-49s with 5.31 million viewers tuning in, retaining its lead among scripted programs in the 8 p.m. timeslot, although they were second among Sunday Night programs. Reviews The episode was met with positive reviews. Hilary Busis of Entertainment Weekly noted \\"The Once team sure loves an antepenultimate episode that neatly wraps up a half season's-worth of story arcs, then pivots at the last second to pave the way for a two-hour finale that's meant to feel like its own semi- standalone movie‚Äîdon't they? That strategy makes sense, of course; if you're going to spend the last two hours of a season writing alt-universe fanfiction about your own alt-universe fanfiction, you may as well make sure that it won't get bogged down with resolving issues like Emma's relationship with her parents and Maleficent's relationship with her daughter and Regina's relationship with her sister. (Pattern alert!) Getting all those things out of the way mean that next week's mega-sized blowout will be free to follow its own path, maybe even without having to waste time on a fairyback. Unfortunately, it also meant that this week's hour felt more like table setting than a main course.\\"\\"Once Upon a Time recap: 'Mother'\\" from Entertainment Weekly (May 3, 2015) Amy Ratcliffe of IGN said of the episode, \\"Tonight's Once Upon a Time melded the past with the present seamlessly and made Regina a more layered character. Even though we watched her crush a human heart with her bare hands, the flashback also managed to make her more relatable. She and others acted in unexpected ways but because it made sense and not merely for the sake of switching it up.\\" Ratcliffe gave the episode an 8.4 rating out of 10. In a review from Rickey.org, Nick Roman cites \\"‚ÄúMother‚Äù is a bit subdued when you consider this is the penultimate episode of the season. But taken in isolation, it's one of the best standalone episodes of Once Upon A Time this season, at least from a thematic standpoint. The notion that happiness is couched in the connections we make, and the love we foster through family ties, is significant enough, but it becomes far more profound when you consider that, ultimately, the only Author that can write our happy ending is us.\\"\\"‚ÄòOnce Upon A Time‚Äô Review: 'Lily' Brings Dragons, Fire, and Blood\\" from Rickey.org (May 3, 2015) Christine Orlando of TV Fanatic gave the episode a 4.7 out of 5 stars.\\"Once Upon a Time Season 4 Episode 21 Review: Mother\\" from TV Fanatic (May 3, 2015) References External links 2015 American television episodes Once Upon a Time (season 4) episodes ","title":"Mother (Once Upon a Time)"},{"id":"46523400","text":"James George Mattos (born January 25, 1932) was an American politician in the state of South Carolina.

The film stars Alexander Skarsg√•rd, Michael Pe√±a, and Theo James. Set and filmed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, it was screened in the Panorama section of the 66th Berlin International Film Festival. The film was released in the United Kingdom and Ireland on 7 October 2016 through Icon Film Distribution. Plot Terry Monroe and Bob Bola√±o, two corrupt cops, return to the Albuquerque police force after being suspended for assaulting a racist coworker. Bola√±o and Monroe regularly rob and extort criminals, accept bribes, and take drugs. While surveilling small time thieves, the two come to believe Jimmy Harris, a local criminal, is planning a heist. They contact one of Harris' former associates, Reggie, and coerce him into revealing information by threatening to falsely arrest him. Reggie and his friend, Irishman P√°draic Power, identify Clifford Reynard, a getaway driver, and tell them Harris' girlfriend, Jackie Hollis, used to dance at a strip club owned by Russell Birdwell. Birdwell, though suspicious, reveals Hollis' address. After bursting into Harris' house and knocking him out, they extort several expensive possessions. Meanwhile, Birdwell tells his boss, James Mangan, a knighted British businessman who is in charge of the heist, the cops have been asking about Hollis. Mangan tells Birdwell to intimidate both Hollis and the cops. Monroe returns to Hollis and gives her a replacement television. After flirting with each other, they have sex and begin seeing each other. While staking out Reynard's house to extort him, too, they hear a scream. In the house, they find that Reynard's wife has murdered him, though she is too hysterical to explain why. Irritated, the cops attempt to quiet her while they consider their next step. Reynard's teenage son flees, but they are unable to catch him. After a nightmare, Monroe becomes concerned and searches the city for the missing boy. As he does this, Birdwell scares Bola√±o's wife by smashing the window of her shop as she talks to Hollis. With Reynard dead, Reggie takes his place in the heist, though he misleads Bola√±o and Monroe into believing it will be taking place elsewhere. When the cops finally catch on to him, they discover Harris and his cohorts dead. Not knowing Mangan's involvement, they assume Reggie is responsible. Before going after Reggie, they learn about Birdwell's harassment and beat him so badly that he loses an eye. Knowing they have numerous enemies and believing themselves untouchable anyway, they do not bother asking who sent him. Reggie's friend Power, when offered a bribe, tells them Reggie fled to Iceland. Though they know nothing more than that, they leave for Iceland, reasoning that an African American man will stick out. To Monroe's amazement, the plan works, and they spontaneously find him in a crowd. Under pressure, Reggie reveals Mangan's involvement and agrees to split his take from the heist with them. Back in Albuquerque, Lieutenant Stanton says Birdwell has filed charges against them. Monroe and Bola√±o assure him that their investigation is nearing completion and will involve Birdwell. As Monroe and Bola√±o search for Mangan, they chance upon Reynard's child, who is living homeless on the streets. Monroe insists on becoming the boy's foster parent over the protests of Bola√±o, who, as a parent, believes Monroe unprepared for the responsibility. Hollis, who has temporarily moved in with Monroe after Birdwell's attack, also voices her skepticism, but the three eventually come to care for each other. Although Mangan's thugs kidnap and beat Monroe, he laughs off their attempt to intimidate him, saying he has already been raped. Not wanting to kill a cop, they release him. However, after Monroe and Bola√±o harass Mangan during a business meeting, Lieutenant Stanton finally fires them. Mangan beheads Power and contacts the cops, hoping to entrap them with an offer of sharing the money. Reynard's son, however, tells Monroe that his mother killed Reynard because she found out he was part of a child pornography ring run by Mangan. Enraged, Monroe enlists Bola√±o to help kill Mangan, having lost interest in the money. In the resulting shootout, Bola√±o is apparently killed but reveals he was wearing a bulletproof vest. The two shoot Birdwell as he begs for his life. Then they kill Mangan as he attempts to bribe them. Monroe, Hollis, Reynard's son, Bola√±o and his family, Reggie and Reggie's transgender girlfriend all party together on the beach in Iceland afterward.

And yet he does. When the script eases up on the rapid-fire quips, segueing into hilarious music cues (all that Campbell!) and slapstick violence, it brings its best game.

Both episodes served together as the fourth-season finale. In this episode, Isaac becomes a wild card in Gold's scheme to change everyone's destiny as Emma, Regina, Mary Margaret, Hook, and David attempt to stop them. When Gold and Isaac forge ahead with their plans, they alter the destiny of everyone involved. Now, it's up to Henry to reverse the outcome and restore the destiny of his family, after he is drawn into the chaos, before it is too late. Plot Opening Sequence The tower where Emma Swan is held is featured in the Forest in Part 1; a swan is featured in Part 2. In the Characters' past In our world, 1966, Isaac Heller (the Author) is working at a television shop as a struggling writer trying to sell color tvs, until he gets a letter from Star Publishing saying that he is wanted for hire. He arrives to find a mostly empty room, with the Apprentice at the desk, who then lays out a selection of different writing materials and demands that Isaac choose one as a test. Isaac picks the magic quill, which seems to approve of him in turn. The Apprentice creates a magic door to another realm, and both he and the Author go through it. In Storybrooke, before the alternate reality Emma, Hook, Henry, Mary Margaret, David, Regina and Robin are in the library of the mansion, searching for a way to stop Gold and Isaac from enacting a new reality with the newly activated ink. They are joined by August, who shows them a drawing of the Sorcerer's Apprentice, who might be able to help them. Hook remembers the Apprentice from when he and Gold trapped him in the sorcerer's hat. With the help of the Blue Fairy, they release the Apprentice, who immediately says that there‚Äôs no time to waste. He tells them that they must find the storybook page depicting the door, as well as the door's key, for only then will they be able to lock Isaac back into the book where he belongs. The group splits up, with Henry, Hook, David and Mary Margaret heading back to the loft for the book and key, while Emma, Regina and the Apprentice head to Gold's pawnshop. At the shop, Gold is clinging to life as Isaac finishes up writing the new book, titled Heroes & Villains. He plans on a new universe in the Enchanted Forest for the inhabitants of Storybrooke, while he writes a new ending for himself in the Land Without Magic. When he writes the final words, \\"The End,\\" magic appears out of the book and begins to distort space and time. The alternate reality Henry awakens with the key in his hand at the loft, but runs downstairs to find that Hook, David and Mary Margaret have disappeared, along with the rest of the people of Storybrooke. He then drives himself to a restaurant in search of help, but notices a best-selling book on a shelf: a paperback version of Heroes & Villains by Isaac Heller. Henry is able to locate Isaac at a book signing event, who is surprised to see him. Henry demands answers and Isaac reveals that his family is alive, but now exists in a different universe inside of his Heroes & Villains story, presenting Henry with the original storybook. Henry wasn't trapped along with the others because he wasn't born in a magical realm and he is also told that Emma wasn't either, as Isaac did not write a \\"savior\\" into the story. Isaac explains that he is also unable to alter events anymore, since he is no longer the Author after violating the Author's Code, which he did by writing himself a happy ending. After Isaac refuses to undo the events, Henry takes the key and uses it on a page of the book, transporting himself and Isaac into the altered Enchanted Forest. Henry and Isaac find themselves trapped in the setting of the final chapter of Heroes & Villains. After Henry finds out that a happy ending for a hero in this universe will return things to the reality that he knows, Isaac knocks him out and binds him to a cart, and leaves him to be killed by an ogre. However, Henry is rescued by the \\"Ogre Slayer\\" Rumplestiltskin, who is now a heroic knight. Using a copy of Isaac's book as a guideline, Henry seeks out Regina, who is living life as a bandit \\"Snow White\\" in this reality. He tries to convince her that he is her son, but Regina does not believe him, since she does not have her memories of her time as the Evil Queen, and throws the book into a fire. Convinced that a true love's kiss between Regina and Robin could solve the problem, he suggests that she seek him out, although Regina already knows him as a fellow thief and rival. Isaac, having escaped the ogres, searches for Henry, hoping that he is dead. He ends up falling into a trap and is found by the evil dwarves, led by Grumpy, who take him to Snow White, who is now the Evil Queen. Snow holds the heart that belongs to Prince Charming and uses it to command him with orders to behead Isaac, but Isaac schemes his way out of it by convincing them that he knows some of their secrets, since he wrote them in the first place. Isaac tells Snow that she can get her happy ending again (which was love with Prince James in this timeline), if she agrees to kill Henry along with Regina. Ignoring Henry's advice, Regina proceeds to rob the royal carriage, but when she opens the door, she is confronted by Snow. Regina is asked about Henry's whereabouts, but after she offers no intel, Snow prepares to kill Regina with a fireball, until Robin Hood shows up and rescues her at the last second on horseback. He takes her back to his pub and tends to her wounds. The two drink to becoming new friends and declare their mutual respect for one another as outlaws in the forest, with Robin offering her leadership of his Merry Men. Regina starts to fall for him, but he then admits that he's leaving the thieving business in honor of his bride-to-be, who turns out to be Zelena. As she leaves the bar, she runs into Henry and informs him about the impending nuptials, which he realizes will mark the permanence of the alternate universe when the church bells ring. She then suggests that he try finding his other mother, if he truly believes that the Heroes & Villains tale is real. When Henry mentions that his other mother was known as \\"the Savior,\\" Regina tells him of the legend of the Savior trapped in a tower in the middle of the ocean by the Evil Queen. Rumple returns home to his wife Belle and their newborn baby son. Unfortunately, Isaac is there waiting, and tells him that his happy ending will be taken away if a boy named Henry succeeds in his quest to reverse the events of the new book. As he is without his real memories, Rumple does not believe Isaac, thinking he must be a demon trying to corrupt him, until Isaac mentions Baelfire, a secret from Rumple's past that he has been keeping from Belle. Isaac then tells him that he must thwart Henry and Regina's plan to stop Robin and Zelena's wedding in order for him to keep his happy ending. Meanwhile, Henry goes to the Jolly Roger to recruit Hook and finds that the pirate is now employed by Captain Blackbeard. With this new Hook lacking in bravery, Henry has to take care of Blackbeard himself, before telling Hook that he must help him rescue his mother, Emma, from the tower. Henry and Hook sail to the tower and proceed to knock out the dark guard on duty. When Henry reaches Emma at the top, he is surprised to find that she has been able to keep her memories as part of a cruel curse. As the trio escape on the ship, Emma, while getting to know the new Hook, explains that the guard they knocked out was none other than Lily, who has the ability to transform into a dragon. Emma and Hook are able to shoot her down into the ocean with a cannon before she attacks. When they make a pit stop at a village, the three are caught by Snow and Charming, whom Lily had informed of their location. Since Snow does not recognize Emma as her daughter, she plans to kill both Emma and Henry. Hook, with no experience wielding a sword, tries to defend them. He battles Charming, and surprisingly defeats him by disarming him. After Hook is distracted, Charming is able to sneak upon him and fatally stab him in front of Emma. Henry and Emma return to Regina's cave. Emma asks to speak with Regina alone, and tells her that if she tells Robin the truth about how she feels, everything will be fixed and they can both get their happy endings with the men they love, acknowledging that she herself never got the chance to tell Hook how she really felt before it was too late. The trio arrive at the chapel to stop the wedding, but before they can do so, Rumple suddenly appears to stop them. Emma and Henry try to distract Rumple as Regina tries to work up the nerve to interrupt the ceremony. Emma engages Rumple in a sword fight, until he is able to knock her out temporarily. He then aims his sword at Henry, but Regina jumps in front of him just in time to take the hit herself, opting to save Henry instead of pursuing Robin. Moments later, Robin and Zelena exit the chapel and Robin rushes to Regina's side as Zelena's envy starts to take over, causing her to start turning green, and she runs off. Robin tells Regina that she won't have to die alone. Isaac reappears and Emma socks him in the face, and demands that he return everything to normal. However, because Isaac broke the Author's Code by writing himself a happy ending, the quill no longer works for him, as he is no longer the Author. Henry then picks up the quill and it activates, meaning that he has been appointed as the new Author. Using the blood of the \\"light savior,\\" Regina, Henry writes, \\"Thanks to the hero Regina‚Äôs sacrifice, Isaac‚Äôs villainous work was undone.\\" In Storybrooke, after the alternate reality As everyone awakens from the events back in Storybrooke, Emma runs to Hook and is relieved to find him alive, though she is still unable to admit her love for him. Gold also wakes up in his shop, back in his dying state. Isaac leaves him there to escape from town. Belle then enters the shop and finds him on the brink of death. She confronts him about his actions as of late and tells him that he already had his happy ending with her before he threw it all away for power. Belle admits that she does still care for him and Gold warns her to go far, far away, before his death is complete and only the Dark One remains. Meanwhile, as Isaac approaches the town line, he is stopped by Mary Margaret and David, who ask about his motives for messing with stories as the author. Isaac tells them that a lifetime of bad bosses and others who pushed him around inspired him to hate \\"heroes\\" and side with the villains, who he thought never got a break. The Sorcerer's Apprentice tells Henry more about his new powers as the Author, which do not include the ability to resurrect the dead directly, such as his father Neal, since he died in the real world. He urges Henry to resist the temptation of altering stories with the quill, and Henry responds by snapping it in half, saying that \\"no one should have that much power.\\" That night, the people of Storybrooke are all celebrating at Granny's diner. Lily tells Emma that she wants to find the identity of her father and plans on staying in Storybrooke during her search. Belle shows up to tell everyone that the last bit of humanity in Gold's heart is about to be consumed by the Darkness, and the group finds Gold unconscious in his shop. The Apprentice then removes Gold's nearly-black heart from his chest, and uses his power to pull the Darkness out of Gold's heart and transfer it into the Sorcerer‚Äôs Hat, which severs Gold's link to the Dark One's Dagger in the process. He then puts a pure white heart back into Gold, and casts a preservation spell on Gold, to keep him alive while they figure out how to help him recover. However, the hat is unable to contain the Darkness, and it breaks out, before attacking and entering the Apprentice. Emma uses her light magic to force the Darkness back out of the Apprentice, and the Darkness exits the shop. As the Apprentice lies dying, he tells Emma and Hook that, long ago, centuries before their births, the Sorcerer battled the Darkness and tethered it to a human soul with the Dark One's Dagger, and now that it's free, the only person who can prevent the Darkness from destroying all the realms is the Sorcerer himself: Merlin. The two then meet Mary Margaret, David, Regina, and Robin as they scour the streets of Storybrooke for the Darkness, which then reappears from above and attempts to possess Regina. Holding the Dagger, Emma volunteers to tether herself to the Darkness to prevent it from undoing all of Regina's progress, telling her loved ones that she trusts that they'll find a way to remove the darkness from her once again. She finally tells Hook that she loves him, after which she plunges the Dagger into the dark vortex. The Darkness violently surrounds Emma as she gradually absorbs it, before the Darkness lifts into the sky and condenses on Emma. When it dissipates, only the dagger is left behind. As the shot zooms in on it, the Dagger now reads the name of the new Dark One, \\"Emma Swan.\\" Cultural references *The opening scene (the television shop) features the ABC color logo on the screen, as 1966 was the year the network switched from black and white to color. *The setting (December 1966) was the same month and year that Walt Disney died.

However, the numbers were down from the previous season's finale, which had a 2.3 rating.\\"Ratings: ‚ÄòGood Wife‚Äô Hits Four-Month High in Finale\\" from Variety (May 11, 2015) Reviews The episode was met with excellent reviews. Hillary Busis of Entertainment Weekly said, \\"Tonight‚Äôs two-hour finale, though, indicates that Once is stepping away from that formula. Next season won‚Äôt center on our heroes rallying together to defeat some flashy, newly introduced foe based on a classic Disney villain.\\" She then noted, \\"The last thing Once ever needs is more characters, and Merlin notwithstanding, tonight‚Äôs cliffhangers indicate a show that‚Äôs trying to get back to basics. Expect to spend the bulk of next season‚Äîor at least its first half‚Äîwith the show‚Äôs main ensemble, rather than a new batch of screen-time-hogging allies and antagonists. (Well, unless everyone ends up taking an extended trip to Camelot.)\\"\\"Once Upon a Time recap: 'Operation Mongoose'\\" from Entertainment Weekly (May 10, 2015) Amy Ratcliffe of IGN said of the episode, \\"The Season 4 finale of Once Upon a Time relished in the lighthearted aspects of telling a story set in a fairy tale world while also hitting some emotional notes and developing characters in new ways. They also took a bold step forward by turning The Savior into the Dark One. The inventive twist opens the door to so many opportunities, and it's heartening to see the series continuing to change the game.\\" Ratcliffe gave the episode a 9.2 rating out of 10. In a review from Rickey.org, Nick Roman said, \\"Once Upon a Time topped itself in ways I didn‚Äôt expect with \\"Operation Mongoose\\": the two-hour movie event delivered a season finale that could have played out as a series finale, if the show had not already been renewed for Season 5.

History Claudico was designed by Carnegie Mellon professor Tuomas Sandholm and his graduate students. The name means \\"I limp\\" in Latin, a reference to limping into a hand without raising‚Äîa strategy the bot employs often. Rather than have a professional poker player attempt to explain his strategy to the programming team, Sandholm had the computer attempt to devise the best strategy on its own. The task was so complicated that it required a Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center Blacklight supercomputer with 16 terabytes of RAM to complete. In explaining his motivation for designing the bot, Sandholm said, \\"Poker is now a benchmark for artificial intelligence research, just as chess once was. It's a game of exceeding complexity that requires a machine to make decisions based on incomplete and often misleading information, thanks to bluffing, slow play and other decoys\\". Originally called Tartanian, a version of the program won a July 2014 tournament against other computer programs. The improved successor of Claudico is called Libratus. Like Claudico, Libratus is designed to compete against top human players. 2015 match against four human players From April 24 to May 8, 2015, Claudico participated in an event at Rivers Casino in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The bot faced each of four top human opponents‚ÄîDong Kim, Jason Les, Bjorn Li, and Doug Polk‚Äîin a series of heads-up matches. At the time, Polk was the world's number-one ranked heads-up player. Each day featured two 750-hand matches over eight hours (plus breaks) against each of the humans, for a total of 20,000 hands per player over the course of 13 days (with one rest day in the middle). For each 750-hand set, the same hands were dealt to one human taking on Claudico on the main casino floor and another battling the computer in an isolation room, with the hole cards reversed. This was done to ensure that card luck was not a factor in the outcome. The 80,000-hand sample represented the largest-ever human‚Äìcomputer data set. Claudico was able to adjust to its opponent's strategy as the matches progressed, just as the humans could. The match winner was determined by the overall chip count after 80,000 hands; although individual results were kept for the four pros, they were competing as a single team. If the final chip count had been too close for the difference to be statistically meaningful, the match would be declared a draw. The tournament carried a $100,000 prize pool, funded by Rivers Casino and Microsoft. The casino set up stands and video screens for the public to watch the action live. Additionally, the matches were broadcast online via Twitch. Highlights from the match will air throughout 2015 on CBS Sports Network's weekly show Poker Night in America. Entering the event, Sandholm estimated that Claudico had a 50/50 chance to win. Polk, however, was confident the humans had the edge. He acknowledged that computers would likely surpass human play eventually, but said, \\"I hope we can make them go a few more rounds after this before they do, like Kasparov did\\". He said his strategy would \\"change more so than when playing against human players ... I think there will be less hand reading so to speak, and [fewer] mind games\\". The blinds were 50 and 100 chips for every hand, and both the human's and computer's chip stack were reset to 20,000 at the beginning of each hand. Halfway through the match, the human team was ahead 458,000 chips versus Claudico. The humans went on to increase their lead, winning the match by 732,713 chips. Polk finished up 213,000, Li won 529,000, Kim beat Claudico by 70,000, and Les finished down 80,000. A total of 170 million chips were bet over the 80,000 hands. Polk said Claudico had played well in spots, but also made some bad plays. Overall, it played very differently than humans. \\"Where a human might place a bet worth half or three-quarters of the pot, Claudico would sometimes bet a miserly 10 percent or an over-the-top 1,000 percent\\", he explained. \\"Betting $19,000 to win a $700 pot just isn't something that a person would do\\".

The United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) has stated that the freedoms of expression and information under Article 19(2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) include the freedom to receive and communicate information, ideas and opinions through the Internet. An important clause is Article 19(3) of the ICCPR, which provides that: > The exercise of the right provided in paragraph two of this article carries > with it special duties and responsibilities. It may therefore be subjected > to certain restrictions, but these shall only be such as are provided by law > and are necessary: > (a) For respect of the rights or reputations of others; > (b) For the protection of national security or of public order, or of public > health and morals. The HRC has stated that \\"the same rights that people have offline must also be protected online\\" (mentioning, in particular, freedom of expression). It is widely regarded that this freedom of information must be balanced with other rights. The question is raised whether people's expectations of human rights are different in cyberspace. Public privacy Public privacy encompasses freedom of information and expression on the Internet on the one side, and security and privacy in cyberspace on the other side. In the context of cyberspace, privacy means using the Internet as a service tool for private purposes without the fear of third parties accessing and using user data in various ways without their consent. The right to freedom encompasses the right of expression and is stated in several international treaties. The right includes freedom to receive and impart information and ideas and to hold opinions without any state interference. It also includes the right to express oneself in any medium including exchanging ideas and thoughts through Internet platforms or social networks. Freedom means the right to political expression especially when it raises matters of public importance. Most democratic countries advance the installation of the Internet for economic and communication purposes; therefore, political expression is given some protection on the Internet. Some governments actively move to protect citizen's data on the Internet. However, these intergovernmental agreements can lead to misuse and abuse of private data, which in turn can affect many other fundamental freedoms and basic human rights. The challenge for governments is balancing private interests with rules against privacy and freedom rights for all. Governance in cyberspace German political scientist Anja Mihr says that cyberspace harbors more individuals than any other country in the world, yet it is without any government, legislative bodies, law enforcement or any other sort of constitution. Without these mechanisms difficulties arise in protecting and enjoying citizen's rights. International Governmental Organisations (IGO's), such as the United Nations (UN), the Organization of American States, the African Union or the European Union aim to set international standards for the use of cyberspace and the Internet to be enforced by national governments, but commonly fail to do so. The problem is that state powers and their mechanisms of enforcement do not extend past the state's borders. Because cyberspace has no borders, the ways and means to govern it are as-yet undefined. This leads to problems wherein those who are willing to commit crimes find it easier to cross borders through the web, as it is unclear where jurisdiction lies. If a governing regime was ever established, it would most likely consist of multiple stakeholders and actors including national, international, and private actors such as representatives of companies, social networks, nongovernmental organizations as well as individuals. Liability of Internet service providers A question arises when there is a breach of an individual's basic human rights. Should the liability fall only on the originator of the breached right, or should the burden also fall on the Internet service provider (ISP)? This is an especially relevant issue when it comes to balancing free speech against defamation. The increasing speed and limitless audience of the Internet pose a greater danger to individuals and their reputations. ISPs may not have the means to monitor content published on their websites, and may be unaware that a defamatory statement exists on their site. This was demonstrated in the case Cubby, Inc. v. CompuServe Inc. where it was found that the ISP was acting as a mere distributor and could not be liable for the content posted on its bulletin. However, in Stratton Oakmont, Inc. v. Prodigy Services Co. the New York Supreme Court held that Prodigy acted as a publisher with an editorial function, and so was found liable. These cases highlight the ambiguity surrounding the liability placed upon ISPs. A further question is whether ISPs will take it upon themselves to function as ‚Äúmoral guardians‚Äù of cyberspace. If over-fanatical ISPs start refusing to host certain Internet sites, this may, in turn, compromise rights for the freedom of speech and freedom of expression. In comparison, ambiguity about ISPs liability could mean ISPs permit content without regard to its potentially harmful effects. Cybersecurity Given the prevalence of hacking, viruses and zero day exploits, the World Wide Web (WWW) is a non-secure storage space for the storage of sensitive private information. Cyberspace is a tool where individuals can exercise their freedom rights, but cyberspace cannot guarantee our freedom. Today there are around 2.5 billion internet users. We are living in a world where everyone has a long data trail, so internet security is a high priority. Today more people than ever have a common understanding of privacy or freedom of expression therefore share common ideas as to how to protect and secure their private data. Still according to the Freedom in the Net Index issued in 2013, most countries in the world censor Internet freedom, some more than others. Countries will do this in various ways. For example, using Internet police. There are many methods of filtering and censoring the exercise of freedom rights. The EU has invested in many filtering projects such as NETprotect I and II, ICRAsafe and the PRINCIP programme. It has been stated that self-censorship Internet users impose upon themselves is probably the most serious threat to Internet freedom. Mass surveillance and fear of private communications being made public lead to self-censorship. This results in individuals no longer using search engines or social networks to express their personal beliefs, ideas or opinions, as certain keywords may trigger concerns with national security agencies, resulting in the Internet becoming a political tool of manipulation. Discriminatory behaviors Cyber bullying Discriminatory behaviors that occur ‚Äòoffline‚Äô also occur ‚Äòonline‚Äô One of these behaviors is ‚Äòcyber bullying‚Äô. Cyberbullying affects at least one in ten students in Australia. Cyberbullying can impact on a range of human rights including: the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health; rights to work and fair working conditions; the right to freedom of expression and to hold opinions without interference; a child or young person‚Äôs right to leisure and play. Cyber-racism Cyber racism can be in the form of individuals posting racist comments or participating in group pages specifically set up for a racist purpose. A well publicised example of this was an Aboriginal memes Facebook page that consisted of various images of indigenous people with racist captions. It was reported that Facebook classified the page as ‚Äòcontroversial humour‚Äô. Hate speech Article 20 of the ICCPR states ‚ÄúAny advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence shall be prohibited by law.‚Äù Hate speech is intended to disturb violence or prejudicial actions against a group of people based on their ethnicity, race, nationality or sexual orientation. Cyberspace has also been used in this way as a medium for destruction. The danger to human rights becomes apparent when terrorists form together to scheme and agitate people to commit violence towards a common good. ‚ÄúAl-Qaeda‚Äù moved to cyberspace, ‚Äúthe ultimate ungoverned territory‚Äù where schools were set up for promotion of ideological and military training and active propaganda arms. It has become a stated subject of importance that these situations are monitored to prepare for future generations of cyber-terrorists. Future of human rights in the Digital Age The future of human rights in cyberspace depends on the evolution of the law and its interpretation by national and international governing bodies. Jon Bing warns that once rules and regulations are automated, they become extremely arduous to subject to judicial review. Bing states that we face a situation in which ‚Äútechnology [is] implementing the law‚Äù. Roger Brownsword looked at some of the issues associated with developments in biotechnology and human rights alongside those raised by digital technologies and suggested three ethical positions on the issues: a utilitarian pragmatic stance, a defense of human rights, and a ‚Äúdignitarian alliance‚Äù. Of the three positions, Brownsword claims the first two are popular in the UK, stating that technologies are being developed that treat human subjects as if they lack autonomy and the capacity to choose for themselves. Recent official discussions have taken place as to the future of cyberspace. In April 2008, the Virtual Law Conference was held in New York. The conference included participants such as Microsoft, Sony, and the Walt Disney Company. The agenda included discussion of intellectual property enforcement, legal issues arising from virtual currency, legal issues arising from virtual property, ethical concerns for attorneys and executives in virtual worlds, and how to litigate a virtual lawsuit. The US Congressional Hearing on Virtual Worlds took place with the purpose of education and exploring the prospects of virtual worlds. The agenda included an analysis of concerns related to consumer protection, intellectual property protection, and child protection, among others. This hearing was one of the first legislative inquiries into virtual worlds. It remains to be seen whether either of these gatherings hold any lasting impact on the field, which continues to rapidly evolve in lockstep with advancing technology. On May 22, 2020, the UN Security Council in its discussion on Cybersecurity highlighted the need to recognize cyberattacks as one of the human rights issue. The course of action detailed that moves such as Internet shutdowns by government and hacking into devices of dissidents, can lead to serious violation of human rights. The idea was acknowledged by at least a dozen countries including Estonia, Belgium, the Netherlands, Ecuador, Japan, Switzerland, and others.

He attended, but did not graduate from, the University of Miami. He moved to New York City where he met his wife. He had several jobs at several companies, including Adjoined Technologies, Onboard Information, and Evalulogix, the latter which he co-founded. Fernandez underwent jaw surgery at the age of 30, which contributed to his idea for Klout due to his inability to speak. He started Klout in New York City, and the website launched on December 24, 2008. On March 27, 2014, it was announced that Lithium Technologies had purchased the website from Fernandez. Fernandez revealed on April 17, 2015 that he was stepping down from his position as CEO of Klout, which would then be manned by Lithium. He later joined Lithium as one of its board of directors. As a result of some of the changes made by Fernandez and his staff to the way Klout scores work, Fernandez came under criticism. Particularly, people were upset that their scores lowered after the way scores are determined changed. This led to Fernandez's cell phone number being leaked and him receiving death threats.  Career  Fernandez began his career working as a web developer for Adjoined Technologies from 2000 to 2001, but lost his job after the dot com bubble burst occurred. He met the co- founder by chance, who was a school psychologist, shortly after the No Child Left Behind act had passed. The co-founder took issue with how much paperwork he had to do and how it prevented him from helping children. The two of them worked to make the company in order to create software that helps schools deal with paperwork. At its peak, the company's paperwork software was being used in 80% of schools in the United States. While the startup was not a major success, the Arkansas-based company Computer Automation System paid Fernandez and his co-workers royalties for their product. His next job was as a director for research and innovation at Onboard Informatics. Fernandez was a standout at WorldLink media both as a computer programmer and at Cupball. A game created among Joe and three other employees. Joe's ideas and inspiration springboarded the games popularity during the Shaq/Kobe years in Los Angeles. Fernandez's idea for Klout came from being bedridden during his recovery from jaw surgery in 2007, as he had been using Twitter as his means for communication and came up with the idea of measurable influence through this experience. The name \\"Klout\\" came as he wrote it down on a piece of paper while delirious from pain relievers. After coming up with the idea for the website, Fernandez quit his job at Onboard Information in order to pursue it. He went to Singapore in order to start up the business, using his own money to hire a team to work on the website. Fernandez was in talks with the former owner of Klout.com to purchase the domain name, but was having difficulties coming to terms on price with him. He met with the domain name owner in person to offer him $5,000 for the domain, which he accepted. The website launched on December 24, 2008. Initially, Fernandez handled the scores of Klout users manually by himself. In 2012, Fernandez was able to raise $30 million in funding. On March 27, 2014, it was announced that Lithium Technologies had purchased Klout from Fernandez. On April 17, 2015, Fernandez announced that he has stepped down from his position at Klout after it was purchased by Lithium in order to pursue other business ventures. Following his decision to step down, Fernandez joined Lithium as one of its board of directors, replacing former board member Chi-Hua Chien (who also joined the board following the acquisition). In 2015, Fernandez became the co-founder and CEO of Joymode, a Los Angeles-based consumer internet startup.  Impact and reception  Fernandez received some criticism due to the perception that a recent change to Klout's score algorithm included a design that punishes users by reducing their Klout scores if they speak to people with \\"low influence.\\" There was also a public perception that Klout's algorithm was just a \\"vanity.\\" Following the change in the algorithm (which caused people's Klout scores to lower), a Twitter campaign called \\"#OccupyKlout\\" was created, his cell phone was leaked, and he received hundreds of death threats.

A portable extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) device is used as an adjunct to standard CPR. A patient who is deemed to be in cardiac arrest refractory to CPR has percutaneous catheters inserted into the femoral vein and artery. Theoretically, the application of ECPR allows for the return of cerebral perfusion in a more sustainable manner than with external compressions alone.Martin GB, Rivers EP, Paradis NA, Goetting MG, Morris DC, Nowak RM. Emergency department cardiopulmonary bypass in the treatment of human cardiac arrest. Chest 1998; 113: 743‚Äì51.Nagao K, Hayashi N, Kanmatsuse K, et al. Cardiopulmonary cerebral resuscitation using emergency cardiopulmonary bypass, coronary reperfusion therapy, and mild hypothermia in patients with cardiac arrest outside the hospital. J Am Coll Cardiol 2000; 36: 776‚Äì83. By attaching an ECMO device to a person who has acutely undergone cardiovascular collapse, practitioners can maintain end-organ perfusion whilst assessing the potential reversal of causal pathology, with the goal of improving long-term survival and neurological outcomes.  Concept  Similar to the concept of elective cardiopulmonary bypass, used in open heart surgery, oxygenation and perfusion can be maintained with an ECMO device in patients undergoing cardiovascular collapse. In the setting of cardiac arrest, ECPR involves percutaneous cannulation of a femoral vein and artery, followed by the activation of the device, which subsequently maintains circulation until an appropriate recovery is made. The theory behind this invasive approach is that the artificial restoration of oxygenation and end-organ perfusion allows treating physicians more time to mitigate and reverse pathology which contributes to cardiac arrest and refractory shock. It has been well documented that the likelihood of return of spontaneous circulation and furthermore eventual discharge from hospital, after ten minutes of CPR falls significantly.Hajbaghery MA, Mousavi G, Akbari H. Factors influencing survival after in-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Resuscitation. 2005;66:317-321..Peberdy MA, Kaye W, Ornato JP, et al. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation of adults in the hospital: A report of 14720 cardiac arrests from the national registry of cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

Once circulation is established, the patient is able to be transferred, for further investigation and intervention, to facilities such as a cardiac cath lab and an intensive care unit. Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) systems differ to traditional, theatre based, cardiac bypass machines in that they are portable and utilise percutaneous access as opposed to catheters which are surgically inserted into an open chest. The first access enters the femoral vein at the groin and is extended superiorly to the right atrium. The second line enters the ipsilateral or contralateral femoral artery and advanced to the distal aorta. Deoxygenated blood is removed from the right atrium prior to being pumped through the ECLS device where it is oxygenated and returned as retrograde flow to the distal aorta. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation   ECMO set ups  Depending on the indication for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation there are two common set-ups. Veno-arterial or VA and veno-venous or VV. In some instances the initial set up can be transferred to a hybrid set up.  The role of ECPR  ECPR is largely viewed as a rescue therapy, which is initiated in patients in cardiac arrest or profound circulatory shock, for whom all conventional therapies have been exhausted and death without further support is imminent. This is based on the assertion that the rapid application of ECPR can temporarily support patients with cardiovascular collapse, whilst permitting an assessment of potential options to maximise long-term survival.[Jaski BE, Ortiz B, Alla KR et al. A 20-year experience with urgent percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass for salvage of potential survivors of refractory cardiovascular collapse. J Thorac Cariovasc Surg 2010; 139: 753-7.] The American Heart Association cautiously surmises that in settings in which an experienced and accessible ECPR service is readily available, that it may be of benefit. The guidelines qualify this by advising that the patient should have had only a brief period without blood flow and that the condition resulting in the arrest be amenable to reversal i.e. hypothermia, intoxication or acute coronary insufficiency.Thiagarajan R R.

This factor has also been regarded as a major contributor of confounders to the numerous observational studies undertaken to assess to feasibility and appropriateness of ECPR. Edecmo.org provides a simple three step criteria for patient selection when it comes to ECPR. This includes: # The patient was generally healthy prior to the arrest. This requires a rapid yet thorough global assessment by an experienced critical care physician # Overall goals of therapy are curative. # The causal pathology of the cardiac arrest is thought to be reversible with an available medical or surgical intervention The ECPR guidelines produced by Alfred Health provides a more detailed series of indications which considers the specific indications for both out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OOHCA) and in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA).[Bernard S Extra- Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation During Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (E-CPR). Guideline: Version 10. AlfredHealth. 2013; Available from: http://edecmo.org/evidence-ecls/protocols/ .]  Note the following are specific to the above-mentioned site and are provided only as an example of an institution's guidelines. = Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest = Patients located within an appropriately equipped Accident and Emergency department with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest which is refractory to standard advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) treatment AND: * The patient meets ALL the following criteria: #The cardiac arrest is likely to be of primary cardiac or respiratory cause #The cardiac arrest was witnessed by a bystander or paramedic #Chest compressions were commenced within 10 minutes #The cardiac arrest duration (collapse to arrival at E&TC;) has been < 60 minutes #The patient is aged between 12‚Äì70 years # There are no major co-morbidities that would preclude return to independent living * The patient is profoundly hypothermic (<32 ¬∞C) due to accidental exposure * The patient has taken a significant overdose of a vaso-active drug(s) (i.e. Beta-Blocker, tricyclic acid, digoxin etc.) * Any other cause where there is likely to be reversibility of the cardiac arrest if an artificial circulation can be provided. = In-hospital cardiac arrest = Patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest, which is refractory to standard, advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) treatment AND in whom the cause may be reversible, such as: * The patient with suspected acute coronary syndrome who arrests in the E&TC; AND does not respond to standard ACLS AND the cause is likely to be reversible with treatment in the cardiac catheterisation laboratory * The patient in the cardiac catheterisation laboratory undergoing coronary angiography who suffers a cardiac arrest and who does not immediately respond to standard ACLS * The patient with suspected massive pulmonary embolism * Any other cause where there is likely to be reversibility of the underlying condition if an artificial circulation can be provided Contraindications No precise list of contraindications has been established, though numerous studies and guidelines have adapted a range of circumstance in which the use of ECPR would be inappropriate.[Bernard S Extra-Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation During Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (E-CPR).

The risk associated with the initial process of connecting a patient to an extracorporeal life support device is potentially exacerbated by the emergent nature of ECMO CPR. Four recent observational studies reported complications in approximately one quarter of patients.[Jones D, Hilton A, Bellomo R. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for inhospital cardiac arrests: the rise of the machines. Critical care and resuscitation 2015; 17: 3-5.] The studies included complication of the initial application and from remaining on the extracorporeal oxygenation circuit.[Haneya A, Philipp A, Diez C et al.

Resuscitation of non-postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest with extracorporeal life support: the role of bridging to intervention 2012; 83: 976-81.] The complications included: * Leg ischemia * Bleeding * Pneumonia * Sepsis * Acute kidney injury * Pressure areas  Initiating ECPR  The following protocol is an example of the site specific regime used as the basis of the CHEER trial[Stub D, Bernard S, Pellegrino V, et al. Refractory cardiac arrest treated with mechanical CPR, hypothermia, ECMO and early reperfusion (the CHEER trial). Resuscitation 2015; 86: 88-94.] based at the Alfred Hospital (Melbourne, Victoria).  Assessment  Once cardiac arrest is identified, cardiopulmonary resuscitation is commenced as per local resuscitation algorithms. With the assistance of emergency medical services and in hospital resuscitation teams, all patients with out-of hospital and in hospital arrests are assessed for their eligibility for ECPR. A set of criteria, specific to each ECMO site is applied whilst cardiac compressions are continued. The patients clinical history is reviewed to assess for a likely reversible cause associated with the arrest. Patients are also reviewed for the presence of contraindication such as pre-existing neurological impairment or significant limitation in ability to undertake activities of daily living. Patients who are deemed not suitable for ECPR continue on standard ALS protocols or in accordance to pre-existing advanced care directives.  Preparation  Once a patient is deemed appropriate for ECPR, the appropriate ECPR team is alerted. Patients in the CHEER trial[Stub D, Bernard S, Pellegrino V, et al. Refractory cardiac arrest treated with mechanical CPR, hypothermia, ECMO and early reperfusion (the CHEER trial). Resuscitation 2015; 86: 88-94.] had a mechanical compression device, the Autopulse (TM ZOLL Inc, MA USA) attached. Also specific to the CHEER trial is the infusion of 2L of ice-cold saline in an effort to induce hypothermia. The patient is intubated for ventilatory support, whilst they continue to be managed.  Cannulation  On confirming the appropriateness of the patient as a candidate for ECPR and once the complete ECPR has been assembled the process of cannulation begins. With a brief pause in chest compressions, a modified Seldinger technique is used to access both the femoral artery and femoral vein with the assistance of ultrasound. In the CHEER trial[Stub D, Bernard S, Pellegrino V, et al. Refractory cardiac arrest treated with mechanical CPR, hypothermia, ECMO and early reperfusion (the CHEER trial). Resuscitation 2015; 86: 88-94.] 15Fr arterial cannulae and 17Fr venous cannulae (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN USA) were used. The arterial cannula is advanced to the descending aorta, whilst the venous cannula is extended to the inferior vena cava. The positions of the respective guidewires is confirmed with a chest x-ray. ECMO Once successful cannulation is confirmed, 5000 units of intravenous heparin is administered. The patients cannula are attached to an ECMO circuit with blood flow targets of 3Lmin‚àí1 and oxygen blood flow of 3L min‚àí1 commenced. An arterial blood gas is used to assess for successful oxygenation and metabolic improvement following the commencement of ECMO. In the CHEER trial, mean arterial perfusion pressures of 70mmHg were targeted.[Stub D, Bernard S, Pellegrino V, et al. Refractory cardiac arrest treated with mechanical CPR, hypothermia, ECMO and early reperfusion (the CHEER trial). Resuscitation 2015; 86: 88-94.] Once the patient is stabilised on the ECMO circuit, they are transferred for further management of causal pathology, for example to the cardiac catheterisation laboratory for coronary angiogram or to radiology for thrombectomy. In an effort to avoid limb ischaemia, in some centres a third cannula is inserted. This third cannula, is extended distally into the femoral artery to ensure perfusion of the lower limb. It has been well established that maintenance of therapeutic hypothermia is arrest scenarios is beneficial.[Bernard SA, Gray TW, Buist MD, et al. Treatment of comatose survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with induced hypothermia. N Engl J Med. 2002;346:557-563.][Hypothermia after Cardiac Arrest Study Group. Mild therapeutic hypothermia to improve the neurologic outcome after cardiac arrest. N Engl J Med. 2002;346:549-556.] In view of this, a target temperature of 33¬∞C is maintained for the first 24 hours following commencement of ECMO, with gradual rewarming occurring thereafter.[Stub D, Bernard S, Pellegrino V, et al. Refractory cardiac arrest treated with mechanical CPR, hypothermia, ECMO and early reperfusion (the CHEER trial). Resuscitation 2015; 86: 88-94.]  Limitations  The current trend of increasing use of ECPR is very promising. However the pool of available research of efficacy is limited, with a number of retrospective observational studies and prospective case-controls studies providing the foundation of modern ECPR evidence. Due to the very nature of ECPR, the applications of a randomised control trial is largely unfeasible, thus limited the quality of data available[Jaski B E, Ortiz B, Alla K R, Smith SC et al. A 20-year experience with urge percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass for salvage of potential survivors of refractory cardiovascular collapse The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery 2010;139,3:753-57.][Thiagarajan, R R. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation to support cardiopulmonary resuscitation: Useful, but for whom?. Crit Care MEd 201;39,1:190-91.] Furthermore, in regards to logistics, ECPR is a highly sub specialised procedure which is both resource and skill intensive. As such it is expensive to initiate and to maintain and therefore has exclusively occurred in tertiary centres with a well-established ECMO service.[Dworschak, M. Is Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation for Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Superior Compared with Conventional Resuscitation? Crit Care Med. 2013;346:1365-66.]  ECPR in the paediatric population  For the past two decades ECPR has been used, in paediatric populations, to good effect. Data collected over the same period reports a rate of survival to discharge of 40%.[Ryan, J. Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for Pediatric Cardiac Arrest. CriticalCareNurse 2015;35,1:60-69.][Huang SC, Wu ET, Wang CC, et al. Eleven years of experience with extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation for pediatric patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest. Resuscitation. 2012;83(6):710-714.] In the pediatric population the indication for ECPR is primarily due to cardiac collapse, often associated with congenital pathology. Similarly as with adults ECMO is only indicated if reversal of the pathology for example with cardiac transplantation, is feasible.[Ryan, J. Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for Pediatric Cardiac Arrest. CriticalCareNurse 2015;35,1:60-69.] When it comes to the consideration of the withdrawal of ECMO, unlike in adult populations parents are encouraged to make the final decision with guidance from the treating physicians. The limitation associated with ECPR in the adult population, including a lack of evidence, resource intensity and the need for a well established and experienced ECPR service.

Colaba Woods is located near the President Hotel in South Mumbai. About 5 km from the CST railway station. The Colaba woods garden is located on C.T.S. No. 87A and 88B. It is spread over 31,000 m2. It is a beautiful wooded tree garden near to high sky scraper buildings. In the early 190's the Tata Electric Company took over an eight-acre plot of land from the MCGM. This was called as Colaba woods. It was a refuse dump. Today this green forest in the concrete jungle at Cuffe Parade is the lung of the locality. It has several facilities like joggers' track, an amphi-theater, a readers' corner for street children, basketball courts, children play areas and areas for relaxation. Colaba Woods won the Urban Heritage Award in 1989.  Tree enumeration study  In 2015, the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation revealed its plans to use up a quarter of the Colaba Woods for construction of the Colaba metro station. To save the garden by highlighting its biological diversity, the local residents sanctioned an elaborate survey of the area. A tree enumeration study was carried out by botanist Dr. Chandrashekhar Marathe during the month of April- 2015 to create an inventory of Tree species. Each tree was noted, identified, its girth (Stem circumference) was measured by measuring tape, the height and canopy diameter was noted approximately. A rough sketch of the Garden was made. The garden was divided into zones for convenience. The pathways were taken as zone boundary. During the study, a total of 803 trees were mapped and measured. Of the 803 individuals counted, 14 were dead. The 803 number of Trees that were observed during the survey belonged to 99 species. Out of total 803 tree species 543 trees are exotic while the remaining 260 are Native species. Out of 803 species about 284 trees are more than 10 m (30 feet) in height, which is rare in South Mumbai's densely populated urban area. Some of the unique tree species are as below: * Toona ciliata M. Roem: There are two very old trees of Toona ( Scientific name Toona ciliata M. Roem. synonym Toona hexandra (Roxb.) Roem.) . According to the Tree census report of MCGM in Year 2008, only one tree of Toona was found in Mumbai, again in Ward A of Mumbai. It clearly means it is the only tree left in Mumbai. * Nephelium chinensis (Lour.) Almeida- / LycheeThere is single tree species of Litchi ( 165 in Mumbai) found in the garden. Most of the Litchi trees do not bear fruits in Mumbai, but the tree in Colaba woods is fruiting well. This probably is only due to tall trees around, which help to keep climate cool and pollution-free. * Koelreuteria paniculata Laxm. Amazingly there is one very old small tree of Koelreuteria. It is also called Flame Gold tree. According to the Tree census report of MCGM in Year 2008, only two tree of Koelreuteria were found in Mumbai, again in Ward A of Mumbai. It clearly means it is one of the two trees left in Mumbai. In the entire Mumbai region, 368 tree species were identified in the tree census report. In Colaba woods alone, 99 species are found. Trees like Undi, Ambada and Variegated Wad, Mysore fig and Mabolo trees are unique to this Garden, this shows the richness of the garden in terms of variety of trees in 3 Ha of land. There are 104 fruit bearing trees. This amounts to 13% of the total trees. The fruit bearing trees play an important role in providing fruits and shelter for birds, bats and squirrels. The study cautioned against cutting down of these trees for the metro station, arguing that relocation of trees is not an option. Giant trees with more than 150 cm girth and 10 m height would not sustain the shock due to relocation. The present tree population would be subjected to major threat due to air pollution, rise in local temperature and water logging of the soil. The removal of trees in the garden area will remove the green cover around the garden; this would lead to rise in the temperature. The untreated slurry and muck if allowed to stagnate in the garden area would lead to percolate huge amount of water in the soil. This will hamper the respiration process of the roots of the giant trees. Almost all the trees are showing healthy growth now. However massive civil developmental work would disturb the local climate which would ultimately lead to destruction of trees. How to visit This garden is at 30 mins drive from CST railway station. Best means to reach from any part of the south Mumbai is by BEST buses . The garden is open for visitors from 7am to 10am and in the evening 4.30pm to 8pm. Photography and collection of plants and flowers is not allowed in the garden.

Montenegro's family were militarily aligned with the Somoza forces, but her feminist and Marxist studies moved her to join with the opposition to the regime. She fought in the Sandinista Revolution and though initially supportive of the Sandinista Party, later became an outspoken critic, saying it had moved to the right. She served as an editor of various divisions of the official Sandinista newspaper, Barricada, until 1994, when she founded the Center for Communication Research (CINCO) as an independent research organization free of government influence. She has written broadly on power, gender, and social interaction. Biography Sof√≠a Isabel Montenegro Alarc√≥n was born on 15 February 1954 in Ciudad Dar√≠o, Matagalpa Department, Nicaragua. Her father, Alfonso Montenegro, was a major in Anastasio Somoza Debayle's army. In 1968, to protect her from the violence in the country, Montenegro was sent to live with her sister in West Palm Beach, Florida where she finished high school and was exposed to feminist thought and Marxism for the first time. She returned to Nicaragua and though she passed the university entrance exams, her parents chose to send her brother to school abroad, rather than educating a woman. Initially Montenegro enrolled in the National School of Fine Arts to become a painter, but later changed to journalism at the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua and translated documents for foreign journalists to pay her way. She began writing articles for a Maoist newspaper published by the Movimiento de Acci√≥n Popular (Popular Action Movement). Despite her father's involvement with Somoza and her brother,\\"Randall (1994)\\", p 39 Franklin Montenegro, being a torturer and member of the National Guard, Montenegro joined the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) in 1978. She struggled to overcome the fear that her family name evoked in the Sandinista movement and became estranged from her mother when she refused to intervene in the death sentence of Franklin, when he was caught. Journalism When hostilities initially ceased in the Sandinista Revolution on 25 July 1979, she became the international editor of the official Sandinista newspaper, Barricada, but suffered a stress-related breakdown. When she returned to the paper, she had to work her way back up the ranks, but soon was fired for her criticism of the Sandinista Party. Montenegro was asked to return as the editor of the editorial page of Barricada in 1984. For her historical essay, \\"Memorias del Atl√°ntico\\" (Memoirs of the Atlantic) that was published in 1986, she won the Jos√© Mart√≠ Prize for Journalism in 1987 in Havana, Cuba. In 1989, she founded the weekly segment \\"Gente\\" (People) in the same newspaper, targeted to women and children's issues. She continued as the director of Gente until 1994. In 1995, she founded and became the executive director of the Centro de Investigaciones para la Comunicaci√≥n (CINCO) (Center for Communication Research) which evaluates how sex, gender, and power affect Nicaraguan society. The intent of the organization was to form an independent organization that is free from government bias to investigate and report on women's issues and the issues affecting the human rights of all marginalized people. In 1996, she participated in a short documentary film \\"Se le movi√≥ el piso: un retrato de Managua\\" (The Earth Moved: A portrait of Managua) produced by a French producer, Anne Aghion which won the Coral Award at the Havana Latinamerican Film Festival. In 2000, Montenegro completed a study and published a book, \\"La cultura sexual en Nicaragua\\" (Sexual Culture in Nicaragua) evaluating the high levels of violence against women. She concluded that misconceptions and misinformation about sexuality and the rooting of women's identity in motherhood led to inequalities and a culture of violence. She has published many articles evaluating political empowerment, communications, and social participation. Political criticism and feminism In 1986, Montenegro founded and became part of the faculty for the Department of Gender and Communication Studies at the American University of Nicaragua. That same year, she became one of the main organizers and founders of the Partido de la Izquierda Erotica, PIE (Party of Erotic Left) with lawyer Mil√∫ Vargas and poet Gioconda Belli. The party formed in opposition to the campaign, criticized as macho, run by Daniel Ortega for the 1990 presidential election. Their goals were to make women's and family issues, which had traditionally been ignored, part of the political platform. Montenegro was one of the women who participated in the consultations in 1986, managing to add ten articles that addressed women's rights to the 1987 Constitution, but prior to the election, the women threw their support in with the Sandinista Party and ceased to exist as a separate party. Around this same time, with fissures forming between the FSLN, its official women's organization, Asociaci√≥n de Mujeres Nicarag√ºenes Luisa Amanda Espinoza (AMNLAE) (Luisa Amanda Espinoza Association of Nicaraguan Women) and feminist groups Montenegro founded the Movimiento Autonomo de Mujeres (MAM) (Women's Autonomous Movement). She is currently a member of its policy coordination committee and its political coordinator. The organization was founded to fight laws that might be unconstitutional or restrict the rights of citizens. In 1995, when the Sandinista party split into the Sandinista Renovation Movement (MRS), composed of intellectuals who supported social democracy and the FSLN orthodoxy, who remained committed to the authoritarian policies of the revolution, Montenegra and Gioconda Belli aligned with the MRS faction. The push towards support of patriarchy and family-oriented definitions of women's roles, were seen as limiting women's economic and political rights. Montenegro was an outspoken critic of Daniel Ortega's administration citing the lack of transparency, nepotism, and fundamentalism as failures of the administration to meet the needs of women and human rights of all citizens. After Ortega's 2006 reelection and criminalization of therapeutic abortion, leftist dissidents and feminists felt betrayed thus became more marginalized as Ortega moved toward more fundamentalist traditions. Her outspokenness led to threats, attempts to discredit her, and government investigations of Montenegro and the other leaders in the women's movement for tax evasion. The ‚Äúcampaign to criminalize feminists for their struggle to reinstitute the right to therapeutic abortion\\" united feminists from Argentina, Belize, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Paraguay, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela, who sent an open letter to Ortega's administration denouncing the attempts to silence activists. Foreign aid has been jeopardized by attempts to silence critics. In spite of the investigations, Montenegro has continued to speak against Ortega.

The alliance comprises LAVI, Kumah and Doreinu.Alliance for New Zionist Vision website Positions The ANZV views Zionism as a revolutionary movement boasting momentous achievements (revival of the Hebrew language, ingathering Jewish exiles, liberating Palestine from British rule, establishing a political state, etc.) but having accomplished very little since the 1967 Six-Day War. ANZV leaders claim that Zionism has lost its revolutionary momentum and is no longer relevant or exciting to Jewish young adults. The movement emphasizes the need to advance Jewish history and criticizes what it refers to as the \\"outdated paradigms\\" it sees as standing in the way of identifying the next goals of Jewish liberation. During the course of its campaign for the WZC elections, the ANZV challenged Zionism's traditional paradigms by taking strong ideological positions superficially associated with the far left and right of Israel's linear political spectrum.Transcending the Political Spectrum > ‚Äú...the ANZV aspires toward Semitic unity, with a strong Jewish and > democratic Israel from the river to the sea existing as an organic part of > the greater Middle East.

LAVI, the ANZV's senior partner, currently runs several educational initiatives along these lines and hopes to sway the World Zionist Organization's Department of Diaspora Education to adopt its programs and methods. One of the major ANZV messages that attracted widespread attention and criticism from some circles was the insistence that Jews must cease trying to identify as white people and that the State of Israel must stop trying to present itself as a Western nation. The ANZV attacked what it called Israel's insistence on trying to be part of the West as being the primary psychological barrier to peace with Palestinians and the broader Middle East. LAVI activist Hila Hershkoviz posted a series of blogs during the ANZV campaign encouraging Israelis and Diaspora Jews to embrace a Semitic identity.Jews Check the \\"Other\\" Box > LAVI views many of the current challenges confronting the Jewish people ‚Äì > especially within the State of Israel ‚Äì as resulting from the fact that many > of our people have been conditioned to disregard their authentic Semitic > identities in exchange for a desire to become part of the West.

The alliance advocates shifting educational efforts to focus on and promote Jewish peoplehood, Semitic identity and indigeneity to the Middle East.

Cover art by Matthias Schultheiss, copyright by Matthias Schultheiss and Catalan CommunicationsBell's Theorem (original German title Die Wahrheit √ºber Shelby, lit. \\"The Truth about Shelby\\") is a three-volume science-fiction horror graphic novel by German comic artist Matthias Schultheiss that originally published between 1985 and 1988. It was Schultheiss's breakthrough work as a graphic novel artist. The title references Bell's theorem from quantum mechanics. It first appeared under the French title Le th√©or√®me de Bell in serialized form in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine L'√âcho des savanes from 1985 onwards, before being published as three standalone volumes in Germany and France. It has been published in English (with a translation by Tom Leighton) as Bell's Theorem by Catalan Communications, with the English-language volumes titled Lifer, The Connection, and Contact, respectively.  Plot   Lifer  In volume 1, Lifer, we're introduced to US American career criminal Shelby who has been sentenced to life imprisonment. The prison management makes him an offer to significantly reduce his sentence by volunteering for \\"mostly harmless\\" medical experimentation for a few years. Shelby agrees and is transported to the privately owned, high-security research facility, where it soon turns out that the experiments consist of new weaponry tested on criminals like him as targets, and he is informed that he can't withdraw his signature of consent retroactively. None of the criminals tested on so far is known to have survived long enough to be released. While Shelby is recovering from his first experiment where he has been severely injured by a laser gun, he is one night secretly visited by Frank, one of the facility's inmates, who himself is already too damaged to flee by himself, as he is already half dead, half consisting of bionic implants the scientists only gave him so they could experiment on him longer. He gives Shelby civilian clothes and tells him how to escape from the facility. Shelby flees into the desert and soon arrives at a highway where he can hitch-hike. But his wounds are starting to bleed again and he collapses near a rest stop, where he is found unconscious by a woman who takes him home and tends to his injuries. Once he has recovered from his wounds and the fever after a few weeks, he rapes the woman, steals her money and her car, and flees across the border, hiding in the wilderness near Canada's Arctic Circle for a few years until they won't be looking for him anymore. During his lone wanderings in Labrador, Shelby one day comes upon a deserted cabin by the Atlantic Ocean where he finds a man's corpse in a large- hooded parka and sleeping bag. Searching the body, he finds the man's identity papers to find out that the dead looked his spitting image and that he was German scientist Amselstein, which explains a lot of mysterious apparitions in the cabin mostly made of wood, strings, wire, and cans. (A short preface text to the volume informed us briefly of Amselstein's research in quantum physics and the nature of reality, and of his mysterious disappearance.) Amselstein's body itself is still wearing a set of fake earphones made ouf the materials, and Shelby finds out that noises come from them whenever whales appear in the sea near the cabin. Shelby decides to assume Amselstein's identity and go to Germany. With him, he takes Amselstein's notes and the mysterious set of earphones. He goes back to civilization, buys himself new clothes, and books a ticket for the flight, but as soon as he arrives at the airport, he is approached by two FBI agents who have identified him as a wanted criminal and tell him that they will send him back to the research facility. He kills them at the airport's men's room and boards his plane just in time, but as soon as he has a seat and the plane is going into lift-off, he has a frightening vision of Amselstein's rotting corpse in parka and sleeping bag sitting next to him. End of volume 1.  The Connection  Cover of English-language edition of Bell's Theorem #2: The Connection, originally published in 1988. Cover art by Matthias Schultheiss, copyright by Matthias Schultheiss and Catalan Communications Arriving in Hamburg, Germany, Shelby locates Amselstein's apartment by looking into the phonebook, but all he finds is an empty flat without any furniture in it. Shelby finds a different address written in the dust on one of the windows and leaves. Shortly after he has left, the flat is searched by a group of government agents in search of Amselstein as they have been informed by somebody at the airport that he has returned. One of the agents comes upon the address scribbled on the window, but before he can read it out, mysterious flashes like from Shelby's vision of Amselstein appear, the window bursts, and the agent dies from wounds to his guts and throat within seconds before he can tell the others what the address was. Shelby arrives at Amselstein's secret home, a house boat full of Amselstein's mysterious trademark contraptions, on the shore of the Elbe river, towered by Hamburg's darkly looming K√∂hlbrand Bridge. His tormenting nightmarish visions increase, as he further delves into Amselstein's mysterious notes on quantum mechanics, is being visited by Sarah, a prostitute who used to be Amselstein's girlfriend, and is on the run from government agents who wish to either ensure him resume his work for the US government, willing or otherwise, or make dead sure what they think is a brilliant scientist will not work for anybody else. Following advice by a homeless bum who knew Amselstein, Shelby visits Paul, a former co-worker of Amselstein's who has since gone mad and is now in a lunatic asylum. Throughout volume 2, we have seen shots of Paul in the asylum, causing some of the events helping Shelby, apparently by some means of telekinesis. Paul is not surprised to see Shelby, explaining to the disbelieving Shelby that Shelby really is Amselstein (or a variant of him) and that it is all part of a quantum experiment, which is also why he can't remember being Amselstein. Paul's incoherent speech resembles elements from Amselstein's notes in their continued reference to quantum mechanics and Amselstein's suspicions of being connected to an alternate version of himself, none of which Shelby takes as references to himself or even takes seriously as the science talk is just beyond him. Paul tells Shelby to later take a black tugboat that just now appears outside the room's window overlooking the Elbe river, and that Amselstein awaits Shelby \\"in the bowels of the earth\\", that is an old subterranean World War II bunker inaccessible for decades because of a broken lift as its only entry. End of volume 2, as Paul is maniacly attempting to convince Shelby that he is Amselstein and Shelby insisting that he is crazy.  Contact  Cover of English-language edition of Bell's Theorem #3: Contact, originally published in 1989. Cover art by Matthias Schultheiss, copyright by Matthias Schultheiss and Catalan Communications Shelby leaves the asylum disgruntled, thinking it was a bad idea to even just go there and talk to what is an apparent madman. Upon his departure, Paul asks him to kill the asylum staff wardens that torment him and keep him from helping Shelby, but Shelby just brushes Paul's plea off, as he doesn't take him seriously. As his visions further increase and with the government agents on his heels, he visits Sarah at her workplace at Herbertstra√üe and kills her pimp. The couple then flees from the police across St. Pauli Piers and, taking a motorboat, through the Port of Hamburg, followed by regular police and port authorities. Meanwhile, the hunt for Shelby turns into open warfare as the US government agents have determined that no money in the world can bribe the fake Amselstein and have snipers set up throughout the port to first kill all German security forces after him and intending to ultimately do the same with Shelby, and Paul from his asylum cell seemingly further influences the events by means of telekinesis. Paul pilots the mysterious black tugboat to ram the port authority's ship and sink it, as the US agents shoot down the police helicopter overseeing the hunt for Shelby and Sarah, and the wreck crashes onto the tugboat that Shelby has entered by now, setting it on fire. The tugboat rams a bridge with the US agents on it and apparently kills them. Desperate to find out who is piloting the mysterious tugboat, Shelby further wrecks the pilot cabin with an axe. The only person he finds on the tugboat at last is Frank, the part-cyborg inmate from the medical research facility from volume 1, severely injured when the helicopter crashed on the boat. He gives Shelby a bag, telling him that he'll need what's inside, and bloodily kills himself by ripping off his prosthetic skull cap. Paul in the asylum meanwhile has died from an apparent heart attack due to exhaustion. The tugboat brings Shelby to the old WWII bunker that Paul has told him about, with the broken lift entry now mysteriously working. Deep within \\"the bowels of the earth\\", Shelby finds a derelict hangar with a colossal WWII U-boat. Inside, he finds more of Amselstein's mysterious contraptions, and shouting angrily at Amselstein, asking where he is hiding, he breaks open a door, only to find the insides of Amselstein's cabin in Labrador. In shock and disbelief, Shelby steps through the door, whereupon the portal immediately closes behind him. The spot where Amselstein's body lay is empty. Left with no food, no sufficient clothing for the cold of the Labrador wilderness, and a several-weeks hike to the next outpost of civilization, Shelby checks on the bag Frank has given him, only to find a certain large parka and a sleeping bag inside of it, both of which he knows all too well from his continuing visions of Amselstein's corpse. Reciting Amselstein's final note about life as but a dream, he dresses in them, puts on Amselstein's mysterious tincan headphones, and lies on the ground to die, ending up as the corpse of Amselstein for his younger self to soon find.

Alice Ravenel Huger Smith (July 14, 1876 ‚Äì February 3, 1958) was an American painter and printmaker. She was one of the leading figures in the so-called Charleston Renaissance, along with Elizabeth O'Neill Verner, Alfred Hutty, and Anna Heyward Taylor. Family and education Smith was a native of Charleston, South Carolina, and had been born into one of the most prominent families of the city. Her parents were Caroline (Ravenel) Smith and Daniel Elliott Smith. Through her great-great- grandfather Daniel Ravenel (1762-1807), she was a distant cousin of the writers Harriott Horry Ravenel, Beatrice Ravenel, and Beatrice St. Julien Ravenel. Smith received some basic training, early in her career, at the Carolina Art Association, but otherwise remained largely self-taught throughout her life. She traveled rarely, only traveling once to Canada, and hated change; she disliked the automobile intensely, and preferred to walk. Art career Smith began her career as a portraitist, copying old family images and painting friends and relations; during this time she also painted fans and dance cards. In 1910 she began experimenting with woodblock printing and etching, seeing limited success in the latter field but much in the former due to her sense of color; even so she would teach etching during the 1920s, with Elizabeth O'Neill Verner becoming a notable pupil. After experimenting with oil paints and printmaking, Smith eventually settled on watercolor as her preferred medium, in which she would work for the rest of her life. Smith was also deeply involved in Charleston's artistic community; a founding member of the Charleston Etcher's Club and the Southern States Art League, she was also involved in the Historic Charleston Foundation, Carolina Art Association, and the Music and Poetry Society. Smith's work was influence by ukiyo-e and other Japanese styles, which she would have known from prints in the collection of her cousin, Harvard professor Motte Alston Read; this aesthetic was reinforced by exposure to the art of Helen Hyde, with whose work Smith became acquainted when Hyde visited Charleston. Another visitor who made an impact on her artistic development was Birge Harrison, whom she came to know when he spent an extended period of time in the city in 1908. Unlike many of her fellow South Carolina artists, Smith preferred the rural landscape of the Carolina Lowcountry to urban scenes of Charleston when searching for subjects. She was also interested in recording vanishing ways of life; her best-known work is the series of twenty-nine watercolors she painted to illustrate A Carolina Rice Plantation of the Fifties by Herbert Sass. Many of her mature watercolors depict scenes from rural salt marshes. Early in her career she also illustrated a volume by her father, D. E. H. Smith, a historian; titled The Dwelling Houses of Charleston, it was published in 1917 and sparked the historical preservation movement in the city. She illustrated another of her father's books as well, and contributed illustrations to several other volumes about South Carolina throughout her career. Smith exhibited widely throughout her career, both in South Carolina and elsewhere in the United States. Some of her work, including the Sass watercolors, is owned by the Carolina Art Association and may be seen at the Gibbes Museum of Art, which conserved the pieces with the assistance of the Harvard University Art Museums. Several of her watercolors are held by the Johnson Collection of Southern Art. A collection of pastels depicting the interior of the Joseph Manigault House is owned by the Charleston Museum. Other museums with her work include the Brooklyn Museum, the High Museum of Art, the Two Red Roses Foundation, the Ogden Museum of Southern Art, and the M. H. de Young Museum. One of her watercolors appeared on Antiques Roadshow in 2013, where it was appraised at $85,000. Smith's papers are held by the South Carolina Historical Society.

It gains its common name from its transparent appearance. Taxonomy William John Macleay described the Port Jackson glassfish as Pseudambassis jacksoniensis in 1881 from a specimen collected in Port Jackson, noting that the length was three and a third times the fishes' height. The species name relates to the location it was described. It was classified in the new genus Velambassis by Gilbert Whitley in 1935, on the basis of having weaker dorsal spines than other members of the family. Allen and Burgess found no reason for the species not to be in the genus Ambassis and reassigned it there in 1990. This species and the co-occurring estuary glassfish (A. marianus) are the only two members of the genus found in temperate waters. The others are found in the waters of northern Australia and southeast Asia. Description Reaching a standard length of , the Port Jackson glassfish has a silver and semi-transparent body and head covered with large cycloid scales. It has a short deeply-notched dorsal fin and forked tail fin. It is slimmer than the related A. marianus‚Äîits body depth is 33 to 38% of standard length compared to the latter species' body depth of 37 to 44% of standard length. The Port Jackson glassfish also has a lateral line running the length of its body, while that of its relative is partial. Distribution and habitat The Port Jackson glassfish is native to coastal eastern Australia, from Moreton Bay in Queensland through to Narooma in southern New South Wales. It lives in estuaries and protected brackish tidal streams that have mangroves growing along the margins. Feeding The Port Jackson glassfish feeds on zooplankton, foraging from the water surface to the substrate. It is a food item of the little pied and little black cormorants.
